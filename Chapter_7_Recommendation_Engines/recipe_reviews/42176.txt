I have been making my roast beef this way forever! It is perfection, IF you heed these basic tips: No other cut of meat will produce a REAL roast beef, but the eye roast!...Every oven is different, so know your ovens well. A three pound roast will cook faster in a new oven than it would in a twenty year old oven...INVEST IN A MEAT THERMOMETER, this is the best thing you can have when roasting a beef...Be mindful that when a roast comes out of the oven it will cook in its own heat and the temp will rise. Not everyone likes a bloody roast. WE DO, and I take mine out at 120, let it stand and it is about 130-135 when time to cut...ANOTHER IMPORTANT TIP: BEFORE COOKING LET YOUR ROAST SIT OUT ON THE COUNTER UNTIL IT REACHES ROOM TEMP. IT WILL MAKE FOR EVEN COOKING. So, their you have it, my advice to all of you bad reviewers. Roasting a beef is not an exact science nor are the cooking times exact...keep trying! This is the best roast beef!

This was wonderful. Please don't pass this up because of reviews saying cooking this way will result in a tough dinner - they surely didn't try it. As others have suggested, make sure your oven temp is accurate, a meat thermometer is a plus and the REAL secret is allowing the meat to rest, covered, for 15 or so minutes while you prepare the rest of your meal. (take the meat out before it reaches the desired temperature, as it cooks a bit more while it rests) Eye of round is a nice lean cut of meat - and it does NOT benefit from boiling it as some would suggest. You will not get a fall apart shreddy kind of roast - this will be a nice moist firm roast that slices nicely, and there is no waste. Stick to the recipe, use the right cut of meat and follow the directions and you won't be disappointed. And you'll have flavorful juice all over your cutting board to moisten the meat after you cut it. I added a bit of thyme to the seasoning mix, as my family loves beef with thyme, but i would not suggest any liquids be added. YUM!!!

The roast tasted really good, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  However, because the roast is not cooking in any liquid, it was a little tough (though it wasn't too bad).  I would recommend adding some water to the bottom of the pan while it is in the oven to make it a little more tender.  This roast, however, will not produce any gravy.  Also, I would suggest adding some onion to the top while it cooks for a little flavoring.  This is a great recipe for anyone who wants a simple pot roast that isn't too much work and doesn't have to cook too long, but if you are wanting a more tender and more flavorful one, i suggest trying a different recipe.

This is a very simple and good recipe. GRRRR. For those who say you must cook moist, or that this is dry, then I feel sorry that you have never experienced real roast beef. Ladies and gentlemen, there are (at a minimum) two distinctly different ways of cooking a beef roast and (surprise!) they come out differently and are used for different purposes. First, "Roast Beef" (this recipe) and second "Pot Roast." If your mother did not make the distinction clear, or did not know herself, I will clarify. --------- Roast beef is cooked dry. This is what you are served at the buffet where the chef cuts thin slices for you, plates, and ladles on some juice. This is what you need to make Roast Beef Manhattan. This is what you need for a French Dip. This, (with more seasonings and a few post-roasting steps) is the start of "Italian Beef 'sangwich'." ---------- OTOH, Pot roast is cooked moist, in a pot. The pot may be in the oven, on the stove, or a slow cooker. Vegetables, typically carrots and potatoes, frequently some onion, are cooked in water, broth, or tomato sauce. This produces a "one pot meal" and is often passed on a platter. Each diner takes vegetables and a chunk of coarsely cut meat. The moist heat causes the meat to be very tender (yet because of large cut may be fibrous), pieces may be pulled off with the fork and a knife is often not needed.

This is an awful way to cook a roast.  The seasonings are fine, but this rapid cooking without any liquid produces a tough, dry result.  Liquid and slower cooking are essential if people are actually going to enjoy this.

I was making roast beef fot the first time looking for guidance, and this was helpful, but flawed in my opinion. I used the cut suggested, eye of round, which I had to special order from my butcher but it was worth it. It's a nice, fairly inexpensive cut for feeding a crowd, and the simple seasoning used here is perfect. However, the oven temp and cooking time didn't work for me. I started my room-temp 5.5 lb roast at 375 as directed, and because I used a probe thermometer and watched the temp, I found it was cooking faster than I'd anticipated. I quickly lowered the heat to 300, then 200, and still it was done much earlier than I expected, the entire cooking time was under 90 mins. I think 375 at 20 mins/lb would produce a very well done piece of meat, so if that's what you like, go for it. But if you like your meat closer to medium-rare, I agree with the reviewer who said USE A MEAT THERMOMETER. Throw out your timer, watch the temp instead. Take your roast out of the oven when it's 10 degrees cooler than your desired final temp. Let it rest for 20 minutes before cutting it, it will cook that last 10 degrees on the counter while it rests. I'd use a lower oven temp than this recipe calls for, 300 or even 200, cook it slow and low. But the cut and seasonings in this recipe are great. I don't think any liquid is needed, just use a roasting pan with a rack so the meat is raised over the pan.

Helpful hint--Most likely everybody is getting a different temp reading after the same cooking time because of how cold the roast was when you put it in the oven.  I always let my roasts sit for 45 minutes on the counter before putting them in the oven.  It eliminates guess work, thermometers and hot/cold spots in the roast.  Great recipe, by the way!

This is a very good basic guideline for the perfect roast. I agree with reviewer tracycook that the oven temp has lots to do with the final result.Invest in a good meat thermometer and follow it. For those who like gravy, simply add a can of beef broth to the bottom of the pan while cooking.Pan drippings will combine with it and make a delicious gravy.My persoanl preference, I would use twice the garlic powder with the addition of some fresh minced garlic, as well. Thanks for sharing.

I made the All American Roast Beef tonight and thought it gave a fabulous flavor. I used table salt because I didn't have Kosher salt.  It was moist and cooked great at 375. Definitely I will make it again!

This was amazing. I seasoned a 3lb beef round top, round roast (Rancher Reserve, the grade is similar to Certified Angus Beef)liberally with the seasonings listed in the recipe. I didn't measure it, I just made sure I coated the entire roast. In addition, I also used dried thyme. Placed it on a racked roast pan and let it sit on the counter for 40-45 mins. I used red potatoes, carrots, and onions & tossed them in olive oil, kosher salt, black pepper, and a sprinkle of dried thyme. Cooked for 60 minutes @ 375 with 15 minutes rest gave us the perfect medium rare. It was divine, tasted like a prime rib that has been roasting all day. It was so moist and tender--I will have to have this once a week!

This is wonderful and correct way to prepare a beef roast.   For everyone who says to add liquid and this isn't the way to cook a roast...I think you need to understand cooking terminology.   A pot roast is a tough cut of meat that needs to be browned and then braised in liquid covered and slow cooked.   A beef roast is a tender cut of meat that you cook dry in the oven uncovered at a higher heat for a shorter period of time.

This is a good method to cook a roast. I gave it 4 stars because there is room for improvement on the seasonings. I like to cut cloves of GARLIC into chunks and make little slits all over the roast about and inch or two deep and insert the garlic chunks into the roast.  The garlic flavor that infuses throughout the middle of the roast is AMAZING! The garlic gets slightly sweet and mild when roasting.  Then season the ouside of roast and brown on the stove top in a touch of oil on med low heat until carmel brown and then deglaze the pan with broth(1/2 cup or more),red wine(1/2 cup or more), and add bay leaf and Thyme to flavor the gravy. Of course I add the onion,carrot,potatoes,mushrooms and sometimes celery at the last hour and baste them with the juices every now and then.  When roast is resting after pulled from the oven place vegetables in a bowl and reduce the pan juices on stove top. If gravy tastes to salty then add broth or water to dilute. Over medium high heat thicken the gravy with a slurry of flour mixed with water til smooth and whisk into drippings  until gravy thickens. Season with Salt n pepper if needed.

This recipe is wonderful and a classic way to cook a roast.  For those naysayers, please use the correct cut of meat (eye roast) and your cooking thermometer judiciously to monitor it.  If you follow the directions and DO NOT add water as many reviewers have done, you will have a fabulous meal. For a little more flavor, I double the spices and add thyme to the rub as it complements roast beef fabulously.  Thank you RCP80 for your submission!

The whole family loved this--it was tasty and quick and the timing was perfect--I did season ahead of time so it did marinate for a few hours giving it great flavor. I made an "au jus" sauce to go with it using the drippings from the meat (very little with a lean eye round) a can of low sodium beef broth and a dash of kitchen bouquet

Absolutely delicious. Don't listen to the people who said this comes out dry. It doesn't. They probably cooked it too long. You should use a thermometer, however, to avoid this. I pulled the roast out when the temp read 130, and it eventually climbed to 145, or medium rare. I did double the spices as I like lots of flavor. I will use this recipe again. Thanks so much!

This is a good quick way to make this roast. And just a note. 20 min. per pound is for medium rare. If you like your meat well, it would be 25 min. per pound. The one thing I don't like about this cooking method is that it creates a hard, dry crust on the outside of the meat. I like braising eye round in a dutch oven or baking it at 300 degrees in a little liquid for 30 min. per pound, which creates a more 'falling off the bone' texture.  Eye round has no fat, so there are no drippings to baste the roast with while cooking, so having some sort of liquid in the pan while baking creates a moister roast. This 'dry roasting' method is quick, but results are fair and the meat isn't as tender. We made this for French dip sandwiches. I did let the meat sit out at room temp. for 3 hrs. before I baked it to ensure more even cooking. Makes a big difference.

Alright, there are alot of people out their that just don't know how good a eye of round roast could be if they knew how to cook it right! I make a marinade- 1/3 cup tomatoe sauce, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup water, Seasoning ( I use a gourmet grill seasoning) it has garlic, rosemary, thyme, crushed peppers, etc.) Let marinate for 24-48 hours. I always cook my roast on the grill, 20 min. per pound. I also let my roast sit at room temp. before grilling. Very important, let rest at least 20-30 min. after cooking, all the juices will lock in. I will use this for sliced meat for wraps or any sandwich. It is much cheaper and way more delicious than deli meat. If cooking in oven, sit on a rack, cook on 475 for 12 min. turn down temp. to 325, cook 20 min. per pound. This will lock in all juices. This is one of the meats I cook for Christmas, everyone loves it.

I certainly agree with the reviewer who cautioned that there is a difference between "pot" roast and "roast beef".  This is recipe is for roast beef - not pot roast, which is cooked with liquids.  Also, one reviewer stated that you won't get the same results with beef purchased at Walmart; the same goes for Winco.  You need to purchase a good cut of meat to get the flavor and tenderness you want.  I, too invest in Angus beef, or Choice, the latter being available at Costco.  Look at the grading on the meat you are buying.  I also agree with another reviewer who says to not only use a oven thermometer to test the oven heat, but the reviewer also says to put the thermometer on the oven shelf you are using and set oven temperature accordingly, so that the temperature on that shelf reads 375 degrees on the thermometer.  Kudos to these reviewers - right on!  Good recipe!

I am amazed at the cooks who want to throw this in a crock pot or add veggies and potatoes to this. This is a Roast Beef, not Pot Roast, or a Crock Pot Roast. 2 totally different foods. This is an excellent recipe for Roast Beef. It should be cooked in the OVEN  to ROAST for best possible flavor.  In a crock pot your meats get steamed. That's why it falls apart when you take it out. Don't get me wrong. I love my crock pot, but when you want to make Roast Beef you use the oven.  Anyway made as written. Give 10 stars if I could. Excellent. I did use beef stock to make a gravy, because Eye of the Round is not usually used for gravy making. Very little fat. I cooked it, cooled it down and refrigerated it so I could slice the next day. YUMMY!

To those who want to add liquid to this recipe, you are not cooking a pot roast here.  This is a rare to medium rare roast. Not only can you use the Eye of the round roast, but a Sirloin tip roast works well too. You can also do a standing rib roast in a similar manner. This is the type of roast to cook and slice up for sandwiches, or as listed with mashed potatoes and gravy.  This is a great basic recipe. For a pot roast it will take a totally different cut and cook at lower temperatures with liquid for 4-5 hours.

Made this as directed with a six pound eye round.  Cooked at 375 F as directed until internal temperature reached 125 F, about 1 hour, 50 minutes.  Removed and covered loosely with aluminum foil while I baked the bread for 25 minutes.  Internal temperature reached 145 F. by the time I carved it, about 35 minutes after removing from the oven.  It was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  I was skeptical about using eye round because I have found it to be rather tough.  This was better than expected and my dinner guests and I loved it.  Served with mashed potatoes and green bean casserole, homemade baguettes and gravy.

Excellent roast! I had read in earlier reviews to add a little bit of liquid or put the roast on a rack. I did add a bit of beef broth and since I did not have a rack that would fit in the pan i was roasting in,  I made one with onion slices. It worked wonderfully.        
My cooking time was a bit longer (even for medium rare) but I think that may be due to the fact I used the wrong kind of pan (a high edged casserole dish).  Thanks again for the great recipe.

I stuffed our roast with a lot of sliced garlic by sticking a knife into the roast on top, bottom and sides, and pushing the garlic into the roast as I went along. I did the standard  rock salt & cracked pepper rub. 

We cooked the roast as others advised, using a thickly sliced onion (into 3 slices) as a rack, and a can of beef broth, at 20 minutes per pound at 375 degrees. I put some smallish potatoes in with the roast, too. About 20 minutes before the roast was to be done, I added sliced mushrooms & some cut carrots, too. When done,I set aside the roast to rest, removed the veggies, and made the most delicious gravy! 

Next, (drumroll, please!) my husband sliced into the roast . . . and it was PERFECT! The best ever, to be exact!

We definitely will always cook our beef roasts at 20 minutes per pound at 375 degrees, forevermore!

Thank you to all who left the tips - I couldn't find my rack OR my meat thermometer, so this was EXACTLY the recipe I needed.

We made this last night, and  enjoyed leftovers as sourdough sandwiches with horseradish, with sliced tomatoes, fresh carrots and grapes for lunch today.

Absolutely excellent!

Very good - the roast was moist and the seasonings were just right.  The only problem I had was that the roast was very rare using the timeline given so I will probably try 30 minutes per pound next time because we prefer our roast medium.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I had two 2.35 lb. roasts, which I tied, brushed with browning sauce and seasoned with the salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I roasted them both on the same rack on a rimmed baking pan.  They took approx. 70 minutes to roast in the 375 oven (I took them out to rest when my meat thermometer read 130), reaching a perfect medium-rare temperature.  Totally juicy,tender, and flavorful, I wouldn't have believed a cheap cut of meat like this could produce such great results.  I will roast my eye of the round roasts using this method from now on.  Thanks!

Cheers to Cindy, because simplicity is the key and knowing your oven is crucial.

I agree with the others that the seasoning is perfect . It may not seem like alot, but a little goes a long way. 
I used a 3 1/2 lbs. top round london broil, and roasted it at 375, and added an additional 10 minutes for the half pound, and i took it out and the meat read 140 which is way too hot for medium rare, because once the roast rests for about 20 minutes the meat will continue to cook and finish off at 150 to 155 which would make it well.   So, i immediately removed the roast and put it  on a plate and placed it in the fridge for a half hour, and this worked in halting the cooking process.  As a result, my roast beef was medium  to medium well, which means it was a light pink. Still very flavorful with the seasonings and tender, but not perfectly red medium rare.   The lesson here for me was that my gas oven cooks hotter and it's important to cook this roast on the bottom shelf; mine was on the middle rack, and next time, i'll remove the roast when the meat thermometer reads 120, which when done finishing outside the oven, will be about 135-140.
Again, thanks to cindy for coming up with a very simple and delicious recipe.

I followed the directions almost exactly.  The only changes I made were not to tie it, and also to cut 3 long slits across the top of the roast and stuff these with sliced garlic cloves (3 large cloves).  I thought that the cooking directions were spot on, the roast turned out perfectly and was delicious!  The spices were just right.  My hubby loved it too.  I don't think we will be making a roast any other way from now on.

Quite delicious!  The only thing I did differently was to sear the meat before roasting. I heated oil in a deep pan and let the meat sit for a few minutes until it was completely sealed. Made for a tender and delicious roast.

A good roast beef should not require "stewing" in liquid.  This is a fail safe recipe if, as others have suggested, you ensure that your oven temp is right and you use a good meat thermometer.  As someone else has suggested, a roast cooked starting at room temp will not only ensure even cooking, but will produce a nice tender roast.  Letting it rest for 20 or 25 minutes will also ensure that the juice is evenly distributed, which only adds to the tenderness.  Thinly slicing also helps.  I've been using this cut of beef for years with great success if you are careful to follow these basic steps and don't cut corners.  The only embellishments I would add to this recipe is to add your seasonings to about 3/4 cup of flour and lightly dredge the roast before putting it in the oven.  Gives it a nice light, flavorful crust.

The time and temperature of this recipe worked perfect. Here's a lil tip for those of you having problems with the cooking time. 
Invest in a stand alone oven thermometer, preheat your oven with the thermometer exactly where you will be placing your roast, if it does not say 375, than adjust your temperature accordingly. When I did this I had to lower the temperature to 300 degrees in order to maintain the 375. Every oven is different so dont trust that because you set it for 375 necessarily means it is actually 375 in the area of the oven you are cooking in. Heat rises, even in your oven, so the higher your rack is, the hotter the temperature you are cooking in.
This recipe was top notch! Best roast I have ever made.

I used a probe meat thermometer with an alarm and set it for 145 degrees. Next time I will set it for 130 degrees because the meat went from medium rare to medium while resting. I added dried thyme to the rub and it was very tasty. I added water to the pan drippings and poured them into the remaining sliced beef. I think I'll make beef pot pies with the leftovers.

I am sure this is a five star recipe because this is how i make mine, however new cooks PLEASE TAKE NOTE, not all brands of beef are the same! i ONLY use angus beef, if you are buying a cut at walmart you will be disapointed.  spend the little extra and buy a better brand of beef. also the more rare the temp the more tender it will be. certain cuts to not take well to well done. as another reviewer said use a thermometer

I put the roast in a ziploc bag and poured in enough red wine to cover it, put it back in the fridge and let it sit all day.  An hour before putting it into the oven, I took the bag out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter to bring the meat closer to room temperature.  I took the meat out of the bag and rubbed the garlic, salt, and pepper on the fat only and put it fat side up in the roasting pan.  Then I added a can of beef broth (the Campbell's double strength) and half a can of water to the roaster before sticking it in the oven.  I roasted it at 375 for about an hour and 10 minutes, and when I took it out of the oven, it was registering 120-125 degrees on the meat thermometer.  I let it sit for 15-20 minutes before slicing.  It was so juicy and cooked perfectly.  I don't think I'll use another recipe for roast beef ever again.

Tried it as is -- turned out great. Kept an eye on the thermometer --we like it rare, so we did about 45 minutes. Didn't need to add any water to the pan -- it came out nice and juicy -- we made a gravy from the drippings.

OK...the cut of meat you use can make this recipe a winner or an utter disaster!!!I made this recipe using 2 different cuts of beef, a top round roast that was tied into a neat little bundle and a ranch cut top round roast. I used a little beef stock in the pan for both roasts. The bundled top roast was like a brick of cardboard!!!! However, the ranch cut roast was the most delicious piece of juicy goodness I have ever had the pleasure of devouring!!!! Served it with horseradish sauce.....OH MY GOODNESS!!!!
So, I will definately use this recipe for as long as I have teeth to chew with....using the right cut of meat, of course!!!

If there were 10 stars to rate this recipe, it would get a 10 from me!  I've always disliked the traditional roasts... until now.  This was cooked to perfection (my version - just a bit pink inside and juice runs when you cut it).  I served with mashed potatoes/gravy and brussels sprouts.  Will definitely make again.  The spices were awesome... I just sprinkled on garlic powder and salt and ground fresh black pepper and rubbed it around.  Splendid! THANK YOU Cindy!  Definitely a keeper :D

This recipe saved my day! I promised a focus group that I would feed them a real meal in exchange for their time, but to my horror the recipe that I was using would have taken five hours, and I only had two. My only addition was basting lightly with a little sour cream and garlic, and it was the most beautiful beef I've ever made. Red in the center, brown crusty outside, garnered awe and wonder when I took the tinfoil off.

I had tried this recipe twice. Both times I kept it in the oven for the recommended 20 minutes oer pound, turned the oven off and had to remove the roast because it was heating up too much too quickly - I literally roasted a 2.5lb eye round from countertop (room temp!) to dinner table in and hour and 20 minutes. With that being said, I remove it from the oven at 120 and both times it was still way too far into the medium-medium well category. DO NOT OVERESTIMATE THE TEMPERATURE.  You want to take this out when the temp will not rise much more as it sits on the counter BUT you also want it to sit long enough to redistribute the juices.
Also, I learned that I like rosemary, onion powder, granulated garlic, salt and pepper in a fairly large quantity compared to what is suggested. My

Bravo!!!!!!
I was about to give up trying to cook beef until today!! I decided to try a  Roast Beef recipe I found on All Recipes. Before seasoning the roast I rubbed it with a light coat of Smart Choice oil, and a coursely grained steak seasoning. I used the onion slices for the rack according to the recipe. For the liquid I used approx.2 cups of water, and 1/2 cup of cooking sherry for for flavor. I had plenty of liquid for the Au Jus. Because my family likes beef well done I decreased the oven setting a bit (325)and increased the cooking time to 2 hours. The roast came out heavenly!! Thanks to the wonderful cooks at All Recipes. Again I say Bravo!!

I must say this was delicious. I also followed the time and temp. as directed and added a small amount of water as recommended by others. The result was perfectly tender Roast Beef.  The only adjustment I made was to allow the meat to sit out on the counter to become closer to room temp. for even cooking.  Also, I inserted sliced garlic into the roast in various places and that just added to the great flavor!  Definately a keeper. Thanks!

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I have served it several times now and it has been a hit amoung my family of six.  The cooking time and temp are key.  I coat ours like yours except I use fresh garlic, worcestershire, and a little brown sugar.  The combination is a great taste and the sugar provides excellent caramelisation.  We have it as the main dish the first night and the next night french dip sandwiches.

I thought this was so easy and really good.  I tend to like my roasts really rare and if so then I would suggest 15 minutes per pound instead of 20 minutes.

Very good seasonings....and tasty.  I really liked the way that this turned out, but the only complaint is that it turned out dry.  I tried this again...adding a cup of water to the bottom of the pan and made a gravy out of it.  I thank you for the recipe.

It came out great.  I rubbed the roast with salt, pepper, garlic, rosemary and a little cayenne pepper.  About 30 minutes before it was done I added thick sliced red potatoes tossed with olive oil, garlic powder, black pepper, salt and rosemary and put them around the roast.  While the roast was resting the potatoes finished cooking.  I'll definitely be making it this way again!

Very pleased with my results! Purchases 5lb,tied eye of round beef roast. After reading many reviews, I coated the entire roast with a seasoned rub -purchased at local grocery. I let the roast sit with rub on for 20 minutes then placed it on a rack (in roaster) in a pre-heated 375 degree oven. Cooked it to 120 degrees international temp and let it sit to rest after roasting.  It was PERFECT!  Beautiful pink center with more doneness to edges. I would go a little less on the rub 
Next time.  Very, very good!  Not dry. Not tough as other comments suggest.

This is fantastic. I have never cooked a jucier roast. Despite some reviews I had read, I followed the directions exactly. Ending with a 15 minute tent is what is key. So very lovely. Glad I know how to cook a roast properly now!

This is EXACTLY what I came to allrecipes looking for.  I'm not cooking roast beef often and forget the basic temp/timing info.  Note to self:  Take the roast out of fridge to come to room temp before putting in oven.

This Roast slices like deli roast, it does NOT shred into long tough strands.  I cooked it till the meat thermometer read 160 degrees Fahrenheit , so it would reach 170 for well done after it rested.  The only other thing I did differently was use garlic pepper in place of the pepper.  The best roast for slicing I have ever made. Just Wonderful!!!  Thanks for posting!!

This is the method my grandmother and mother taught me.  It never fails.  I'm making a 6 lb eye of round for Sunday dinner tomorrow.  I like to roast new potatoes and baby carrots with the meat.  Produces fantastic flavor and texture without adding any water!

This is a wonderful "classic" roast beef recipe.  I think those who don't like this method are wanting more of a pot roast, not Roast Beef.  I don't think anyone would cook a standing rib roast in water.  This is similar.  I wouldn't think it would be good if it is cooked well done either.  I found it to be a great recipe.

I've used this recipe several times and with different cuts of beef. It always turns out excellent. In addition to the listed ingredients, I also insert fresh garlic into the roast. I also lay the roast on a bed of onions and drizzle it with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and red wine. Part way through the cooking I add mushrooms, more onions and some peppers around the roast. It is so yummy!

Good recipe. I used this recipe for the cooking time & the type of beef to buy.  The cooking time is right on the money.  Instead of using the recipe's rub I just used a package of onion soup & then added a cup of water.  The roast came out medium/medium rare & tender. I did use the rub the recipe calls for once before & it was tasty...however I didn't add water & it was a little tough. All in all a good recipe as long as you add some water.

This is absolutely the best roast beef I have ever tasted  -  I've made it twice in the past 2 weeks.  With the exception of using an eye roast, I used a bottom round both times and followed the recipe exactly.  Perfecto!!!!!!!

Perfect.  We like some red in the middle, so I cut cooking time by about 10 minutes.  Other than preferred cooking time, don't change a thing.

I made this last Sunday with an eye round roast, and it was awsome!  It had a wonderful taste, and it wasn't dry, although eye roast is a good cut.  It smelled good as it was roasting, and my kitchen windows were open, and I hope all of my neighbors were drooling!!  From the drippings I made a gravy and served it with mashed potatoes, seasoned carrots and cole slaw.  Truly a wonderful meal.  Will be making this again!

I prepared this using a 2lb tri-tip as an alternative to grilling the tri-tip over indirect heat.  I seasoned the tri-tip per the recipe - 1/2tsp kosher salt, 1/2tsp garlic powder, 1/4+ tsp fresh ground pepper, and added a 1/3 cup beef stock in the roasting pan.  I browned the seasoned tri-tip in the roasting pan over high heat, then added the beef stock before putting it in the oven uncovered.  I must say that this formula of seasoning is perfect...not too salty as they have a tendency to be.  Also, the suggested cooking temp/time formula was dead-on for a perfectly done tri-tip.  Grilling a tri-tip is still fun, and traditional, but this is a great alternative which I'll use again.

A permanent entry in my recipe box, this roast cooks up perfectly every time I make it. Nice and perfectly rare.  I even add extra pepper to the outside and then slice the leftovers for tasty sandwiches later!

Excellent results. I have seared my roast 1st and also just put it in the hot oven. Either way it works very well. I mix the salt, pepper and garlic powder and then rub the roast. I have also crushed a clove of garlic and rubbed the roast b4 adding the salt and pepper.

I made this yesterday and it came out fantastic.  However, the 20 min/LB @375 was incorrect for me and would have probably been terrible.  I had an 8 Lb eye roast and it was well done at 2 hours when I checked it.  I probably could have pulled it out at an hour and 40 minutes or so.  So like the others say, use a meat thermometer and don't go with the time alotted. Great Roast though and I will make it many more times!

This is it. Your basic, simple, fool-proof Sunday roast.  I think the bad reviews are from people who were expecting POT roast instead of a rosy, thinly-sliced, roast beef. Although the directions are simplistic, they are important.  The cut matters, the time matters, the temp matters, the resting matters.  Too much beef for you? No problem because it's excellent the day after for sandwiches.

My roast was 2 1/2 lbs so I wasn't sure if this would turn out but I followed the directions exactly and got a perfectly cooked medium rare roast after cooking for 50 minutes.  And the gravy I was able to make from the wonderful meat juices was so very good, I didn't want to stop eating.

I'm not a great meat-maker and I had high hopes for this roast.  Used the eye of round roast and all seasonings but found the meat to be a bit tough.  Good flavor and used remainder for beef sandwiches, but not as tender as I had hoped.  Any suggestions?

We followed instructions to the T except that we changed the cooking time to 22 minutes per pound because we prefer our beef medium/well.  Delicious!

FOR dryness issues try adding 1cup of beef broth to the pan prior to cooking ..i do a variation on this where i sear all sides and cover with foil for entire cook time and use 1 cup beef broth and i never have problems with dry meat 
resting is key though you must let it rest

I've used this recipe a few times but usually change up seasoning every time.  Comes out great though I do coat the roast in olive oil and marinate it for a few hours before I throw it in the oven.

This turned out wonderfully.  I am giving it only four stars because the instructions should state that the use of a digital thermometer is very important so that you don't over or undercook the meat.  I used mine and took it out of the oven at 140F.  I let it rest for about 20 minutes before cutting and it had risen to 150F, turning it to a perfect medium rare.  Excellent recipe!

It was very good and very easy. I added a lot more spices and a jar of onion gravy. Covering it after it was taken out of the oven is really important. Don't skip this step :-). My family loved it.

This is good, BUT i highly suggest cooking it in a liquid to make it tender so it's not tough!! I personally cut slits in the meat and then pour a can of french onion soup over the roast and let it sit in the pan when it's roasting. It's good to let the roast marinate in the soup broth 24hrs BEFORE you cook it.  Not only does this give the meat great flavor and make it nice and tender & juicy...but when you're done roasting, use the remainder broth to make the gravy. You're guests will rave about this trust me!!

No matter the cut of the meat to be roasted, I always sear it on all sides in a hot oiled skillet.  I like the addition of a bay leaf or two.  As with others, I add LOTS of potatoes, carrots, onions and mushrooms toward the end of the cook time.  Delicious!!

Follow the way Tracycook makes the roast and never add any liquid to the pan as it will result in a tough mess.

This is, by far, the simplest and best way to do a nice cut of roast. I tried boiling as some suggested and it does not compare! It is imperative to use the cut as suggested to acheive the wonderful flavor of this recipe. YUM!!!!!

Delicious. I love roast beef. I don't add any liquid to the bottom of the roasting pan, basically you're steaming instead of roasting then... and you don't get the lovely bits of caramelized meat juices to creat the perfect gravy from. Throw some peeled par-boiled potatoes in around the roast if it doesn't crowd the pan too much. Heaven!

Thank goodness for this recipe - I accidently threw out the instructions for the beef roast that I bought for a dinner party for nine, but these instructions worked well!  Perfect medium rare - I left the beef in a little longer than the recipe stated, as I had 3 pieces of meat in one pan (each about 2 pounds) so figured it would need longer. Thanks!

enjoyed this roast, but next time will add more salt and will increase cooking time to 25 min. per pound as I like a medium done roast, not a medium rare.Will make again.

Awesome!  I've never made a roast beef before and it could not have turned out more perfect.  I followed the recipe, but didn't use garlic and added 1c. water to pan and 1/2 sliced onion on top.  Delicious!  My husband raved about it all night!

It was a very easy and tasty roast, but a little rare for some of the tastes at my party. I loved it nice and red, but if you like your roast a little more done add a bit in cooking time. Was a great hit, nevertheless!

Seasonings were so good. I have a hard time getting an eye of round roast done (we like medium well) but without drying out. I think next time I will go at 325 degrees for longer with water in the bottom of the roasting pan. Love slicing this up for sandwiches!

This is a fantastic recipe! The important thing to remember is the cut of meat is eye of round roast. (The poor review by cdbooksearch is way off base for this type of cut) I did add a cup of water and a chopped onion to the roasting pan and the aus jus is out of this world--watch it carefully, though it may get dried up, but just add more water if needed.  I've made this three times and it was perfect each time.  If I only had a slicer to slice it really thin like the restaurants do, it would be even better.  Thanks, Cindy, my search for the "holy grail" of roast beef making has ended successfully!

This really is a foolproof recipe...even the most novice cook can't mess this up. I was a little concerned about using the kosher salt before roasting the meat as salt tends to dry meat out. I used it anyway and followed the recipe almost exactly...I did add some oregano and basil. The result was a tender, juicy, perfectly cooked roast.
I'll be using this one time and time again and would recommend it to all to try!

An eye of round roast is one of the leanest roasts you can get. It is not a fatty pot roast and can not be cooked much past rare in my opinion. Then it will be dry. If you want well done beef then stick with a pot roast. This roast does not require liquid but you must keep an eye on the internal temp. I always pull mine at about 130 degrees as it will cook up to 140. But if you cook even 15 minutes too long, you will ruin it. Definitely invest in an instant read probe thermometer.

This is a good way to cook an eye roast. Suggestion: I read the debates on moist vs dry cooking. My husband taught me the best way to cook this meat using almost the same recipe except he used a hybrid of the moist vs dry. Put the meat on a rack and add water to the bottom of the pan but not touching the meat. Periodically check it, if the water has burn off add some more - do not add too much because it will water down gravy and you definitely do not want that because this makes great gravy.

It would be interesting to know which reviewers used electric vs. gas ovens.  Combustion of gas produces carbon dioxide and water vapor, which might contribute to a moister roast.  A separate pan of water in the oven might mimic this.  Starting with a room temp roast, preheated oven and meat thermometer are essential.

The cooking process was spot on! I had a 3 pound bottom round roast that I took out of the fridge several hours before I was ready to cook. It is important to let your roast get to room temp before cooking to ensure even cooking throughout. I cooked for 20/mins per pound at 375 degrees and it was a perfect 120 degrees when I took it out of the oven. I wrapped in foil and let sit for about 20-30 mins until I was ready to serve it. I gave this 4 stars because of not enough seasoning. I doubled the seasoning and it still wasn't enough. Next time I will use more salt and pepper, fresh garlic, and thyme and make a paste to rub all over the roast. I will wrap it in foil and refrigerate overnight to get more flavor into this roast. This is a tough cut of meat, so be sure you have a very sharp knife or an electric one to slice very thin. It is wonderful! Thanks for the great cooking technique!

I made this last night for dinner and it was awesome. I've never been too successful cooking a roast beef for slicing until this recipe.  Please use a meat therm instead of the standard 20 min/lb - my roast cooked much quicker. I pulled it out at 120 and I let it sit about 30 min before slicing. Perfectly pink throughout. No red. Thank you for posting

This was perfect! I was leery of cooking without water, but it turned out absolutely tender and delicious. TRACYCOOK's suggestions worked great. Definitely use a meat thermometer and not rely on the time given, take it out of the oven at 120, let it sit to remain cooking while you prep the rest of the meal. I will be making this often. Thank you for the great recipe!

It was as good as i expected. It was as easy as i expected. If your not sure of accuracy of your ovens temperature, keep an eye on the roast. Keep in mind the roast will continue to cook after you pull it from the oven

This is the best ROAST BEEF you will ever eat, if you want POT ROAST make a POT ROAST, but please don't rate this fine recipe poorly because it isn't a recipe for something other than ROAST BEEF. That said, I bought a slightly larger than 3 pound roast, seasoned it and cooked it according to directions, yes this does make a rare roast beef, if that isn't your thing add 5 minutes per pound to the timing. I did add thinly sliced onions to the pan and on top of the roast prior to putting it in the oven just as a personal preference. Be sure to slice as thin as possible and serve with a light gravy, mashed potatoes and a vegetable of your choice.

This was a very good, very simple recipe.  Note, however, if you are making a smaller roast, a meat thermometer is critical.  I did the recommended time of 20 minutes per pound, and my (1.75) roast did not even register on the thermometer.  It took about 45 minutes, plus the 15 minutes resting to be the perfect rare (but not raw).  Overall, simple, but very juicy and flavorful.

This really had a nice taste to it.  I thought for sure it would be dry, but to my surprise it was perfect.  Next time I am going to use an eye round.  I used a top round and it was a little tuff.

1st time roast cooker here! Had to go in for a little longer for us, we like our meat a little more well done. I took the advice of a couple other reviews and cooked the roast on a bed of diced onion in a little bit of water, and cut little slits in the roast to insert some cloves of garlic, and seasoned with fresh cracked garlic pepper and salt on with the fat side up. My boyfriend LOVED IT!! Said it was "just good as his moms" - haha i'll take that compliment!

Simple, quick and delicious!  My favorite kind of recipe.  Great as a quick weeknight dinner.  Throw it in the oven with a couple of baked potatos and carrots and you've got dinner.  Thanks!

Unbelievable how something so simple can be so delicious every single time I make it.  I always make sure I pick out the biggest roast (at least 3 lbs) so we can use the leftovers for french dip.  And the eye round is so inexpensive, you can't go wrong!  I'll never by an expensive beef roast again.

Deeelish!! I couldn't use my roaster with rack as it was too large. I made a "bed" with onions and carrot. I also added 1 can of beef broth to the shallow pan. I seasoned liberally ahead of time and put back in the fridge. Key is as others said. Bring it to rrom temp before cooking and let rest 15 minutes after. I also tied it as mentioned to promote even cooking. It definitely will keep cooking as it sits. Everyones oven is different but my 2 lbs. took 60 minutes for med-rare.

I fixed an eye-of-the-round (2 lbs) last night and was disappointed. Roasted the beef about 45-50 minutes at 375. The instructions said 20 min/lb=40 minutes and yet it was still a bit rarer than medium rare--red with bloody juices.
Also, the beef was tough even though I sliced it thinly with an electric knife.
I used a cooking thermometer but it didn't register properly. I also tried an instant meat thermometer after I took the beef out of the oven and I couldn't get an accurate reading.  I almost always have bad luck with thermometers and I am greatful for the pop-up on turkeys!!

I followed the recipe to a T, however, I added a few Teaspoons of water to the bottom just to give the juices a head start. Well I should have added more becuase there really weren't any juices till I started slicing the meat. While the meat was very juicy I didn't have any drippings to make the gravy. I made that from scratch using "D's Skillet Gravy" featured on here. I did find the meat to be a little tougher but I think it's because of the cut of meat (Eye Round)I would suggest using a 1/2 cup of water next time. I will make again for sure! Thanks for the EASY recipe.

I made only one change - When I roast anything in my oven, it is in an unglazed Romertopf clay pot.  EVERYTHING roasts better in that.  I have a medium sized one and a large one that can handle duck or small turkeys.  I highly recommend them!  Great recipe!

This was the first time I ever made a beef roast and it turned out great!  I added a cup of water as suggested by others.  It was moist, juicy and tender.  (I did make a rookie mistake of  bringing the meat straight from the refrigerator to the oven, so it took a little longer to cook.)  This got the highest compliment from our house:  an enthustiastic "We can have this again!"

This roast turned out absolutely delicious.  The cook time is right on for a perfect medium rare! I used sea salt instead of kosher and it turned out so flavorful.  Thanks so much for the recipe, my husband and I really enjoyed this and I'll definately make it again.

I always do add about a cup of water to the bottom of my pan before cooking and I like to add a bit of onion to it as well but this is by far the best recipe for roasting beef and it can be altered to anyone's taste-for example I noticed that someone used a bit of red wine, another person mushrooms, and so on. To me the best recipes allow you to add your own flair to it anyway. I vote this is a great recipe and it's a great one for beginners as it's pretty hard to mess this one up.

I did not believe that this roast would be moist, but I took a chance and will only make it this way now. It is moist and very flavorful, you must you kosher salt. I do not think it would be the same without it. It is truly a classic roast beef, even my non meat eating two year old could not stop eating it!

Before cooking, I rub the roast with a little oil (olive or canola), then I combine 2 tbsp flour with the garlic powder, salt & pepper and rub over the roast.  Sometimes I add dried thyme or oregano.  I use the 375/20 min per lb rule and it always comes out perfect!  Letting it rest before serving is a MUST though!

Made this last night and I must say it was good. I added a LOT of garlic by placing 1/2 glove under each of the strings and even more on the inside. Made a rub with steak seasoning and pepper. My husband said the garlic was strong, but since he said it as he was going for seconds, I didn't take that as too much of a complaint. Also, cooked it a bit longer than suggested because we like medium well/well rather than medium. Nice job! Thanks for sharing it.

This is really good.  I roasted it in my pampered chef rectangle baker.  I used carrots as a meat rack.  Also rubbed it with pressed fresh garlic combined with salt pepper and evoo.  They key is letting it come up to room temp before roasting.  I also added some water to the bottom of the pan and used the juices to make pan gravy.  Great with a little horseradish too.  YUMM-O!

I cook my eye round exactly the way the recipe called for.  I did put use beef broth and the onion as a rack.  It was wonderful.I must tell you it did not look "cooked" when I took it out of the oven after 60 minutes but I did cover it and let it sit for 15 minutes and it was perfect!

I wasn't sure about this recipe at first, it seemed almost too easy and the roast I bought was bottom round but I attempted it anyway.  My huband said this was the best roast I have made yet.  Cooked perfectly (med/rare) just the way we like it, juicy, full of flavor and surprisingly tender.  I will be making my roasts this way from now on.

I followed the temp instructions etc, and everything went smoothly! The meat was tender, medium rare, and overall a hit! 
I added beef broth and sliced shallots to the bottom of my roasting pan while cooking. This made for a great gravy once thickened. 
I served this with mashed sweet potatoes and baby peas. 
My husband kissed me and said he loves his cook! hahahah

I made this roast beef today.  I never made a roast beef so I search for a recipe and this is the one I got and decided to use it!  My meal came out great!  I did keep the roast in longer than suggested.  I had a 4lb roast and at 1hr 20 min I checked it with my thermoter and it read 110.  So I kept it longer until temp was 140 and it was great.  I personally like a touch less pink but my company raved about it.  I also put some beef broth in the pan after about 30 minutes and then some water twice more.  Definintely give this recipe a try!  I used eye round as suggested by my Dad and the recipe, it is the best cut for roast beef.

I altered the cooking method, but used the seasonings in this recipe.  The roast was delicious and completely tender.  I cooked the roast at 450 for 15 minutes, then I reduced the heat to 350.  After 30 minutes cooking, I sliced up an onion and added it to the roasting pan.  I removed the roast once the temperature hit 130 and let it rest under aluminum foil for 15 minutes.  My family loved dinner tonight.  Since I made a 3 lb roast we will be eating the other half tomorrow and my husband and boys can't wait.  Thank you for sharing!

This was really good.  It was the first roast I've made and it turned out great.  I like my roast a little more well done so I cooked it about 30 minutes per pound.  Turned out wonderful.

This was a very tasty combination of flavors.  I like to put thinly sliced pieces of fresh garlic into slits in the meat to infuse the entire roast with garlic.

I made a few changes, first I used a rump roast (sale this week), I followed one reviewer's advice and let the meat get to room temperature. I used all the seasonings as written. I was just about to put it into the oven when my husband came in and said, "I thought that we would order out tonight", I said, "no problem". I wrapped it up to save for the next night. I took it out to reach room temperature and cooked it a little over an hour. My family likes it medium well (no blood showing according to them)and it was absolutely delicious. The recipe will be used quite frequently. Thanks!!

My husband loved it so I would give it 3.5 stars...I like more of the crock pot, fall apart type pot roast so it wasn't my favorite.  The kids wouldn't touch it.

The spices created a very nice flavor for my eye roast.  I never quite know what to do with my roasts and will definitely be using this from now on.

This was soooo simple, so goood and it did cook to perfection. For the seasoning, I used Grizzly Joes Gourmet seasoning. The family said this is definitely a keeper. So whatever seasoning you use, as long as you follow this cooking time it will be cooked to perfection.

Although I do a lot of cooking, i've never made a roast beef because i'm always afraid it'll be dry.  Because this recipe got so many good ratings I thought I'd give it a try.  I searched for an EXACTLY 3 lb roast which I found.  I followed the recipe exactly except at the end I chickened out and cooked it an extra 15 mins.  What did I get?  A bloody way-to-rare roast.  I don't know why.  The oven was EXACTLY at 375.   The good thing was it was NOT dry and/or overcooked.  I flash fried it that night and it was okay.  A couple of days later I fried up the leftovers and they were good on sandwiches.  The other comment I have is that, despite following the recipe exactly, I felt it was a bit bland... maybe some fresh garlic and some other spices in the rub would have been appropriate?  If I could give the recipe 3.5 stars I would, but since I can't I'll give it 4.

I was looking for a recipe for a pot roast in the oven instead of the crock pot, because I had never done it that way before and was tired of the crock pot versions.  This turned out great!  I read the reviews and was worried about dryness so I put 1/2 cup of water in the bottom of the pan.  I also put 1/2 bag of baby carrots in with the raw meat before cooking.  I inserted slivered cloves of garlic into the roast.  Both the meat and carrots turned out tender and flavorful.  The meat wasn't dry.  I cooked it to well-done also.  Served with the carrots, mashed potatoes, asparagus, green salad and gravy that I made from the drippings.  Good, down-home cookin', I tell ya!

Whether you have a gas or electric oven . . . makes all the difference.  Whatever a recipe temperature says, if you're using a gas oven, lower 15 degrees . . . for everything.  Make sure the roast has been in the rack with aluminum foil underneath that has been coated with Crisco at room temp. for at least an hour. Using my gas oven, I prefer to preheat to 535 degrees and turn immediately to 350 degrees when putting the roast in.

This roast was delicious! Followed the directions exactly and was rewarded with a beautiful, medium-rare (more on the rarer side), flavorful and tender roast. You definitely need to cook this roast on a rack, so the heat can circulate freely around the roast & don't skimp on the resting time! It was a big hit with my family and tonight we will use the leftovers for French dips. Thank you for a fantastic & easy recipe!

Best recipe ever - I have tried tons of recipes and the beef is always over cooked.  This method cooked it exactly the way we like it. Finally found a way to enjoy roast beef.

Tried this last night with great success. I read a review mentioning adding water to the bottom of the roasting pan, which I did, but I think that was unnecessary.  The roast was plenty juicy on its own. I may add a bit more garlic powder next time just because I loved the garlic flavoring. I can't wait to make a sandwich with the leftovers! I will definitely make this again.

Ok.....really.....Just made this tonight and it was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!  You really just need to try it!  Don't do anything extra...just make as stated.  Used an internal thermostat for the roast....pulled it out of the oven when the temp got to 120....for my roast that was 3.12 lbs, it was about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Let it sit and the temp rose to 135.  Was PERFECT!  A little red, but just perfect for us!  I feel so accomplished right now.....Making a Roast Beef was always my biggest fear....Now I know I can make this for company w/o a panic attack!  :)

Angus is definitely the best cut; however, regardless of the cut I ALWAYS age my own beef. Put on a rack, gently cover with waxed paper, and let rest in the refrigerator for 6-8 days. Then I run in lots of Kosher Salt and black pepper. I roast at about 200 degrees for several hours -- even a nice rib cut. Experiment, and you will like it!

This is a great basic/classic recipe. I have always been a bit afraid to try a roast again. It always seems like they turn out overdone and tough. I followed this recipe to a "T" and it turned out quite nice. It was just a touch tougher than I was hoping, but still an awesome recipe that I will certainly keep. I will try letting it stand for a while before cooking the next time I make it. Perhaps, that will aid in making it more tender. As a side note...I highly recommend purchasing a meat thermometer that is ment to bake with the roast. I read in a review of this recipe to do so. It made a big diference for me. I felt confident that the meat was at the preferred level of doneness...it was just that...perfect.

I guess I was always under-seasoning my roasts because after trying this recipe my family raved about the flavor!  Really tasty, tender and yummy!  I have also used this on a pork roast with equally delicious results.

I made this recipe tonight. Even my 9 year old who isn't a meat lover, enjoyed the roast beef. I thought it was very easy to make, and came out delicious, tender and juicy. I hand rubbed the seasoning onto the meat as well as roasted the meat on top of sliced onion. I will certainly make this again. I was thrilled, as I'm not the best cook and have tried roasts before to little success. :)

Not bad, but not great either.  We cooked it 45 minutes extra and it was still extra rare.  We did let it sit for 15 minutes too.  I like red meat pretty rare, but it was too rare and it made it chewy.  I'm going to stick with my rotisserie for roast beef.

Very good. I added 1/3 C soy sauce and 1/3 C worcestershire sauce and water and cooked it in the crock pot for 5 hours. Next time I will get it out in 4 hours. It was very tasty.

Results may vary... If you want a tender, melt-in-your-mouth roast, cook in a covered Dutch oven. I dredge my roast in flour seasoned with salt & peper, brown in a bit of oil or shortening. Use a shaker to put 3 T of the remaining flour and seasoning of choice in 3.5 C of water and add to roast. Cover and bake @ 325F for 3.5 hrs. One hour before done, add cut potatoes and carrots. Viola! You have roast, veggies and gravy! If gravy is too think, remove roast, add water and boil on top of stove until correct. If too thin, add thickener and boil. My husband, who is a box-mix cook, loved the sense of accomplishment from his first award-winning roast/meal. Works with pork roast, too!

After having this, we bought a meat slicer. It comes out perfect...Just the right amount of cooking. My husband loved it so much...He passed a platter around the next day for our company of 5 to try...They had to have the recipe. He was so proud of the delicious meat I had prepared the night before.....NOW with the new slicer. We'll make it again and be able to slice it good as the deli for sandwiches through out the week...Thanks.

My husband was in heaven with every bite of this roast. Along with the salt and pepper, I also added minced garlic, and a bit of beef broth in the bottom of the pan.  It was a wee bit tough,but of course I couldn't help but taste it as I was slicing it, and I noticed that after slicing, I put it in a dish, poured the juices over and let it sit, it seemed to get very, very tender. We loved it with horseradish sauce! Thank you for the great recipe!

This was great! I have always loved roast beef, but this is the first time I have made it (since my husband hasn't eaten beef since long before I met him because of a food poisoning experience). I finally decided I was going to make a roast, even if I would be the only one to eat it. Well, my husband thought it smelled so good he decided to try a piece... and then had three more! He has actually requested this be added to our regular rotation! In short, this was good enough to hook someone who hasn't eaten beef for 8 years! Thank you!!!

The first beef I've ever cooked . I am an excellent cook and have been cooking and baking for years . My family is not a beef fan, we prefer healthier choices.Tried it for a change.  YUK the smell was horrible and no one ate it !-  I'm glad to be a vegetarian.

This was a good recipe.  I cooked mine longer for a more well-done roast.  It was easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.

This was excellent...tender, flavorful, cooked "right on" for the time suggested (20 min./pound).  I was seeking a successful roasting method, and I think I've found it.  I never had luck w/ Eye of Round before.  The only modification (to the recipe) I made was to use Wildtree Herbs' Steak Rub which contains a high percentage of sea salt, cracked black peppercorns, and select herbs & seasonings.  It was great!  Thanks!

Very tasty. Simple and you could really tase the beef which I like. It's so easy to overpower the meat with too much spice, but this is great!

This recipe was easy and very good.  After we carved the roast we used the juices as a dip and it really livened up the flavor.  I used fresh garlic and some additional seasonings.

I was worried that there wouldn't be much flavour in this roast - added 1/2 sliced onion and a bay leaf to the pan, didn't add water as some others did - the flavour came out great, but it was a bit overdone for my taste (we like rare roast beef) - I would cut the cooking time to 12 - 15 minutes per pound, but otherwise this was very tasty & so easy!!

The only beef I had in the freezer was sirloin and I needed a quick healthy dinner for my husband.   Instead of running to the store, I went ahead and used the sirloin.   I sliced the beef into 1/2 inch thickness and cooked 4 slices.  I followed the suggestion to brown it first stovetop with the seasoning (I used a tablespoon of olive oil), before putting it on a baking dish, and poured beef broth over it.   I then sprinkled freshly-minced garlic and baked it for 20 minutes at 375 deg.   It was delicious!   I served it with pan-fried asparagus and rosemary-flavored redskin potatoes.   The whole meal looked so fancy, and it took less than 45 minutes to prepare altogether.   My husband raved over it!!!  Thanks to the original poster of the recipe, and to everybody else who put in their modifications.   Thank you all!!!!

This roast turned out very good.  My roast was mostly frozen so I increased the bake time by 10 min. per pound.  I liked how brown the roast got at 375 and alot of pan drippings for gravey.  I think I will cook all my  beef roasts like this from now on.

Very good, the blend of spices was tasty. I seared mine in a pan first, then cooked it at 350 degrees instead of 375. It took about 2 hours to get to medium rare (for a 3 lb. roast.) I also added 1 C of water to the bottom of the baking dish so I could make gravy.

Followed the recipe as stated, and the eye round roast came out perfectly cooked. Just about medium.  We don't like our meat still mooing, so this recipe was perfect for us.

My husband thought the flavoring was good but it was a little tougher than my usual roasts in the crockpot.  Probably wouldn't make again unless I was pressed for time.

Perfect!  I did make a few changes. I was fortunate enough to have herb de Provence so I mixed a 1/4 cup of softened butter with 1 teaspoon of herb de Provence, and on teaspoon of black pepper.  Lathered the meat with it and applied a generous amount of kosher salt.  I was using a convection oven set to roast so cut the temperature down to 350 degrees. The timing was pretty accurate. but I use it only as a guide. The internal temperature rose to a little more than I like. I  usually roast to 120 degrees, but went to 126. I let it rest for 15 minutes tented,  and when cut was a beautiful pink. I had a very lean eye of round, but there were enough drippings to make a wonderful au jous. I added some red wine to the sauce. I don't use flour in my au jous for I feel that is gravy. not au jous.  Reduced it, and the dinner was just spectacular.

Perfection!! I used a 9.5lb tenderloin, rubbed it with Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb spices to save time. It was delicious even though I forgot to add the salt just before convection baking for 3 hours. Next time, I will remember that to see what the difference is. I found this recipe while searching for a "Perfection Roast" recipe where you cook for 5 minutes(?) per pound on 500 then keep the oven doors shut for 2 hours. I couldn't find that specific one, so I tried this and am extremely pleased. Not being stressed at all about it was a bonus!

This is a great way to make a very moist and delicious roast. People saying cook slow and in liquid are dead wrong. You can get a very dry roast while cooking in liquid. (Thats the way my mom cooked them all my life) The only thing I do different is I sear the roast on all sides in a stainless steel or iron skillet then put the skillet into the oven straightaway. Shortens cooking time by about 8 to 10 min. Great recipe!

I used to cook roast beef the way my mom did, with onions, carrots and potatoes in the pan, and (no offense Mom) but it was not my favorite thing - always dry, chewy beef. I think she put water in the roasting pan. 

Then I tried this recipe. I love it! So simple, and the beef comes out tender, deliciously flavoured and mouthwatering! Mmmmmmm. 
Where's the beef? In my oven right now!  :)

This is a Great recipe ! I doubled the spices, but cooked it exactly as directed. It was delicious! The family loved it! This recipe is a definite keeper! All the people that said that they needed to add liquid to the pan are crazy! I didn't add Any liquid to my pan and after I let the roast sit for 20 minutes there was plenty of natural juices in the pan for me to make an au jus sce as well! 
PERFECT RECIPE AS IS! ( my family prefer a lot of flavor, so I doubled the seasonings)

The kind of recipe I was looking for for a traditional roast beef. 
I doubled the seasoning per our taste and added fresh thyme and stuffed pieces of garlic cloves in about 8 slits. Roast turned out great.  Letting it get to room temp is important to cook properly.  Taking it out at  120°  Is perfect. Super easy recipe.

This recipe and method worked perfectly. I cooked two separate cuts as I had a few more people to serve. Both weighed 2.5 lbs and I kept it in the oven for 1hr and 10min. It came out perfectly juicy and just the right amount of tenderness. This is one of my first dishes I’ve cooked on my own and it worked to perfection and to everyone’s expectations!

I was very skeptical about roasting beef at 375 degree for 20 minutes per pound. Followed recipe as written, figuring cook time exactly for 3.68 lb roast. Wow! Came out perfectly medium rare which is exactly how I like it. Will follow this method from now on.

My mother used to make a roast this way.  It was like a Manhattan roast beef.  Sometimes she would get extra suet from the butcher and lay it on top of the roast.  As the suet melted it added and extra layer of beefy richness  so important for good gravy fixings.  Then, of course she discarded the suet when the roast was done.

6lb. roast, cooked it for an hour and forty minutes... the rub was so tasty... turned out perfectly juicy and kids even liked it. Side of garlic mashed potatoes with steamed green peas and smothered it all in 'canned' brown gravy... doesn't get any better!

The only thing I didn't do is tie it up.  I didn't have any string.  I did put extra spices on it and used Mrs. Dash in place of the garlic powder/salt.  I did put garlic cloves into various slits.

I will be making it again..

Made this twice now. Taste was good for an easy quick meal. I removed roast from the oven when internal temp reached 135 F and let it rest. Result was a good medium rare, with external slices being more along the lines of medium-well doneness. 2nd time making eye of round I changed the recipe a bit to try making italian beef, added herbs and more seasoning, let roast rest as I did before. Then, wrapped roast in foil and placed in fridge for 24 hours. Result was easy for slicing, but next time I'll remove from oven at 120 F to reach rare doneness after the rest time. If you use this meat to make Chicago Italian Beefs with your own au jus, ya gotta do a rare temp since the slices of meat will be placed in the jus and finish cooking. Anything above rare cook time would result in over cooked beefs--no one likes rubbery italian beefs--that's my opinion anyway. 5 stars for good, basic recipe as written with proper cooking time. Loved being able to follow cook temp in this recipe for da beefs! If only I could master the jus for the beefs, but that's a whole other recipe!

I made this with a 2 lb. roast, followed the direction of cooking for 20 minute/lb and resting for 20 minutes and the roast was still raw inside.  It didn't even register on my meat thermometer!  I will go back to my slower, roast at at a lower temp. recipe.

I think I just don't like this cut of meat as a roast. I used a meat thermometer. I let it sit after taking it out of the oven. It was done to a perfect medium/rare to medium. I cut across the grain. I just didn't care for the texture, too firm and chewy. The recipe instructions are very good, but I think I will save round for other cooking methods.

I've been making this recipe for a while now. The only variation I have is to sear the meat before roasting. I generously season it with a salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder blend. It is so juicy and tender!  The only draw back is the lack of escaped juices to make a gravy with.

I made this recipe yesterday and it came out perfect.  I used a top round - what I had on hand.  This is the classic "Beef on Weck" beef recipe. We couldn't stop eating it (with a little horseradish of course) Best fast beef roast recipe out there.

Very easy recipe. I did not tie roast and it came out fine. I did sear the exterior first and then cooked at 325. Meat was very juicy. Key to be generous with seasoning.

Great recipe! So easy! Just make sure to read other reviews here and use a meat thermometer! Do not rely on timing, particularly if you want a medium-rare roast!

I have made this twice now, and I find that for medium-rare I need to take the roast out when the centermost part of the roast reaches 120. Make sure you really are measuring at dead center where it is the coolest. You may need to try in several locations in the roast.  I check the temperature every 10 minutes after I reached the halfway point. Then I let it sit for 15 minutes before slicing. Slicing very thin is key - particularly if you use a cheap cut of meat.

Tastes great with a prepared package of Knorr brown gravy if you are looking for a shortcut!

If I could I'd give this a few more stars I would!! This is REALLY good. We all loved it especially my husband he raved about it. I think this is the best roast I have ever cooked and I am 54 yrs old. I used a bottom of the round because that's what I had in the freezer. I did follow the recipe to a tee. It was wonderful. I will be using this again and again.

Good basic solid recipe. I did have to substitute a sirloin tip roast as my butcher did not have any eye of round left. I also had to tinker with the cooking time but did use a meat thermometer and Tracycook's review was helpful. I like my meat medium rare and took my roast out of the oven when it hit 125 on the meat thermometer and let it sit for 15 minutes but I think her suggestion of taking it out at 120 is better if you like medium rare. My roast was beefy meaty deliciousness though a little more overdone than I would choose.

I scaled the recipe and cooked just one pound. But it ook 55 minutes to get to medium rare! Once it was finally done, the meat was just ok. I won't make this again.

Worked  great. The temperature was ideal, I did cook it longer, I like it medium well. Nice start to have a tender roast, not burnt.

I really wanted to give this at least four stars, but the flavor was not there.  Even my 9 year old said "it's bland". The cooking directions are dead on, the roast was moist and medium rare.  Nice and tender, but BLAND.

This was my first oven roast.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfect.  In fact I really didn't need the brown gravy.  Thanks for the help with my Christmas Dinner!

This was fantastic.  I follow the recipe added no water but was nervous because I have never done that.  Paid off however it did take a little longer, I think 15-20 more minutes.  THANKS for sharing!!

I made this yesterday for a belated Thanksgiving dinner with my family and everybody raved. I used the same seasonings listed and added a little bit of thyme and Worcestershire sauce and let the roast marinate for about 1 hour before putting it in the oven. I also added about 1 inch of water, Worcestershire sauce, garlic and 1 onion (quartered) to the roasting pan.     I would agree with previous posters and say that having a good digital meat thermometer is helpful so you can know when it's reached your desired level of cooking. My family prefers a well done roast and it was still very moist and juicy.     I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is the best roast beef, I have ever made!  It was moist and flavorful.  I did use suggestion from the other viewer like cook the roast on a bed of onions and cut slit in meat and place garlic cloves inside.

Awesome!  Made for the first time for Christmas dinner.  Turned out perfect!  I used Italian seasonings to on the beef and put stock on the bottom of pan.  Also let the meat rest on counter for at least an hour.  Took out at 135 degrees and it cooked until it reached 160.  Big hit, everyone loved!  Thanks!

This was my first attempt at a roast beef dinner and it was simply fantastic! The only alteration I made was adding a can of beef broth to the roasting pan. The roast turned out so tender and it had a fantastic flavour. I'm not a successful gravy maker so I used the packets and added some of the drippings from the roast. Thank you for an extremely simple and delicious recipe!

Thanks for submitting such a great recipe!  My roast came out PERFECT thanks to your advice about cooking at 375 degrees.  I had a tendency to overcook roasts, but not anymore!  Even the cheapest cut of beef comes out wonderful.

This is by far the BEST roast beef recipe. I made it last night for hubby and myself and it came out perfect! It was tender and juicy. I marinated it in worchestershire sauce, minced garlic, and garlic salt. My hubby who is a cooked to death meat kind of guy sure changed his tune. Now he loves his beef pink. Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was the most delicious rump roast I have ever eaten.  I have been trying to go organic with my meats and I bought and organic roast for the first time.  I don't know if it was the meat or the recipe but it was absolutely perfect.  I used Durkees Grill Creations Beef Seasoning as my rub.  Cooked it until it was 120 degrees on my meat thermometer and let it rest 20 min.  Sliced very thin with my electric knife.  Melts in your mouth and so easy I told my 20 year old college student son he could make it.  Thanks for sharing.

was looking for an economical cut that my picky son would like. Followed recipe, but it was too tough for his tastes. Guess we'll have to stick to higher quality cuts a little less often!

The cooking time was about 5 minutes too long, because my roast was a little dry, also, the dry rub was not enough for flavor, but in the future I will follow previous tips. It was my first time making roast and I made it in a college dorm kitchen, my friends were thrilled with the meat, and with a few minor alterations I'm sure I will be too.

The flavor was awesome. I took the advice of others and made add beef broth with shallots at the bottom of my roasting pan. I did make the mistake of taking the advice of the butcher and cooking it at 325 instead of what the recipe says. It turned out too tough, next time i will follow the recipe to a tee.

This recipe is a keeper! It's the first time I've ever made a roast beef meal. Took the advice of using a meat thermometer, cooking to 120 degrees with water in the bottom of the pan. I like a little blood tenderness. Next time I will cook at 275 instead of 200 degrees. Took too long. I made the mistake of not cooking a watery soup base dip or gravy for the beef. Will hunt for that next time. A great meal for company without the cost of  prime rib roast!

Excellent!!  Excellent!!  Served a 5 lb Eye of Round Roast according to cooking times posted and was rewarded with a mouthwatering dinner receiving compliments all around.  I added sliced onions and mushrooms to pan cooking the same amount of time.  For my first time, the meat wasn't overcooked.  Thank you Cindy for an easy, delicious recipe that will be used often.

This was delicious!  The beef was moist, tender and flavorful.  After working a long day, my husband came home and I had it on the table, ready for him (timing was right-on)and he raved about it until he fell asleep! It seems the way to a man's heart is STILL his stomach...and this recipe helped pave the way!  Way to go Cindy!

this always works out great - I use this as a basis for my cooking time and I usually add to my meat- olive oil, fresh rosemary, chop up a few cloves of garlic with salt and pepper and it turns out so yummy! :)

Excellent recipie if you have a good cut of beef and are looking for something simple to enhance the flavor of an already good piece of meat.  The combo of spices don't overpower the meat, but season it just right.  An added tip - if you have the time season meat and let it marinate overnight.

I doubled the seasoning has I had two different roasts to cook. I seasoned all the sides.  I did add a little water to the pan.  I cooked it at 375 as directed.  The flavor was really good.  Typically I just use salt and pepper. The garlic was a really nice addition.  I plan to make all my future roasts like this.  I do recommend adding a bit of water though.  If you buy roasts low in fat you will need additional liquid.  Also it gives you more liquid to use for gravy. YUM

I love salt, pepper and garlic as the inky spices. The outside is very yummy. The issue we have had is that we started our first one with the 20 mins/ pound timing and it came out mostly raw which 4/5 of us did not like. So we made. A second time with 22 mins/ pound and it still came out very rare. The third time we did 25 mins/ pound and it was rare at the ends about an inch in then raw middle. We can’t seem to get the timing down right so it’s rare in the middle vs. raw.  Tasty but if people don’t like very bloody meat, you need to cook it significantly longer.

In the Top 3 of roast beef dinners ever tried in the home kitchen.
Basic and easy to follow instructions.  Didn’t use garlic powder due to personal preference but still a winner, none the less!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was not cooked long enough. I cooked it 15 minutes longer and it was still not cooked or tender. Had to add it to a stew for another night. Would NOT recommend. Going back to making it in my crockpot so it's tender.

Very good recipe. I make little slits in my roast and stuff with fresh garlic. Make sure to rub some oil on the outside of the roast along with the seasoning. ***The photos in this recipe show the meat being cut with the grain instead of against the grain. Make sure you slice it correctly, as it makes a huge difference between in tenderness. You should not see long lines in the meat, but rather a marbled pattern.

Very good. My supermarket is now offering Prime cuts of roasts so it’s perfection. Super tender. I add onion powder and celery salt to taste in addition to the garlic, salt and pepper. Then I make au jus on the side.

My grandmother made this often in the 1960’s-1970’s  so this reminds me of my childhood :) 
Follow cooking time and temp !  I wanted to cook it more but glad I did not !!   It was not dry . I also made 4 holes in the top of roast and placed a garlic clove in each one .   Grandma did that, so I followed her lead ! 
I will make again,
Thank you

I made a 5 pound roast for Easter dinner.  Everyone loved it, but it took much longer to cook than the 20 minutes per pound.  I cooked it in foil for the recommended time and it was not even rare.  I turned the temperature up to 400 degrees and added 60 minutes and it turned out perfectly.   (Well).  Very tender.  I served it with sautéed onions and gravy and there were not a lot of leftovers.  I will definitely make this again, it’s super easy, cleanup is easy and it’s really really good.

This recipe was straight up magic. I didn't even tie my roast. Trust it. My roast was the most perfect medium rare and juicy I wanted to cry. Best piece of beef I've ever cooked. Amazing.

Incredibly simple recipe for an inexpensive cut of meat.  I followed suggestions by others and doubled the amount of seasonings  and added some thyme and onion powder.  Used a thermometer to cook it to 125, then covered with foil and let it sit for 20 minutes while I prepared the rest of dinner.  Will definitely make it again.

Must have the beef at room temp. This was so easy and I'm a hero for making it for dinner. If you have picky beef eaters because it used to "dry" out , this will be the best they've had. Crock pot does all the work , you get the love.

I made this for Sunday's supper, and it came out perfectly medium rare, which my family loves!  I added garlic mashed potatoes, green beans, salad, and mushroom gravy.

2.13.19  Well, the reviews are all over the place,  so I decided to totally follow the recipe.  My roast weighed 2.75 pounds, I cooked at 375ºF for 50 minutes at which time my  thermometer was reading 140º,  so I removed it from the oven, and let it sit covered with foil for 15 minutes before slicing.  Although the meat was perfectly cooked, it was tough as shoe leather.  And I’m not faulting the recipe for this because I’m finding more and more often, it’s the meat itself, not necessarily the cooking method.  We still enjoyed it even though we did a lot more chewing.  To finish off the leftovers, I made roast beef hash one evening, and some open-faced roast beef sandwiches another. After the thinly-sliced beef simmered in the hot gravy for a while, it did soften a bit.  I’m almost to the point where I’m about ready to give up roasting beef, because one time it’s tender and the next time with the same recipe, it’s tough.  This inconsistency drives me nuts because it’s always “hit or miss.”

Omg. I let the meat sit out to come to room temperature and it was still raw! So gross. Either your idea of cooked meat is way different than mine or my oven is way off. I will buy an oven thermometer tomorrow. If there’s nothing wrong with my oven, then there is something really wrong with this recipe.

20 minutes per pound worked for me! I rubbed olive oil on it before I seasoned it with garlic salt, sea salt, black pepper and garlic powder. I didn't measure those, I used generously.  A meat thermometer is your best friend. I took it out at 130 and covered it with aluminum. 20 minutes later, it was 140....PERFECT

It got the job done. Next time I will cut the time down to about 15min per pound. When I took it out of the oven it was already at 165 so quite overcooked for my liking. Also added some beef stock to bottom of the roasting pan before putting in the oven so we could make gravy from the drippings. Good starter recipe, though, and very easy.

I seasoned the roast (skipped the pepper and added ground orgeano) and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  I tied the roast and place in the peheated oven and cooked 20 mins per pound. I removed from the oven with 5 minutes left on the timer.  I removed the roast from the rack and wrapped it in foil and let it sit for 1 hour before tasting it. When I unwrapped it there was about 1/4 cup of jus under the roast. I cut the strings and turned the roast, and wrapped it again. 2 hours later we had super tender and VERY tasty roast.  Used the jus to make gravy.

I made this as written but did use a meat thermometer  as recommended by previous reviewers and I used more seasonings.  I let it sit to room temp before putting it in the oven. When it reached the temp I wanted, I  took it out, covered it with foil, and let it sit for 20 min.  This was the best roast beef I have ever made!  I sliced it thin and it was so juicy that I had to keep draining my cutting board.  My husband loved it too!  I've added it to my favorites.

It may have just been the quality of the roast. Nolan Ryan shoulder roast. This was super easy and turned out rare, tender  and flavorful. I always like to use lots of fresh cracked pepper.  I did marinate it for about 3hrs in grapefruit juice, soy sauce and Worcestershire.

I have a newly calibrated oven.  I followed the recipe exactly- brought the meat to room temperature, (20 minutes per pound at 375 degrees.  The roast was raw and the temperature didn't even register on my brand new meat thermometer.  VERY disappointed.

Followed instructions for recipe and it was really good. we'll probably end up doing our own mix of spices for the outside but overall the meat was juicy and delicious! Whoever said theirs was dry did it wrong!

Followed suggestions regarding cooking in lower temperature as we like our roast beef medium rare (closer to rare than medium), and it turned out amazing. My husband said it was one of the best roasts he ever had. Thanks for the recipe :)

Decided to try this as I didn't have the time to use a slow cooker. I was very pleased with the seasoning and cooking time suggestion was dead on. However the meat was tough despite a few reviews suggesting it wouldn't be.

As soon as I got it on the cutting board and tried to cut a slice was when I noticed and thought my knife was dull so I sharpened it and still it was very tough for a fresh knife. Now when we started eating everyone had one complaint, was very tough (even for restraunt steak knives.

I cooked it on a rack to keep it off the roast pan. Probably should of had beef broth in the bottom.

It is great recipe. The only thing I would do next time, put less salt. When I saw 4 tsp of salt, I put only 3. It was still salty. I had 3.5 lb NY streep. I Cooked at 350 Fr for 30 min, meat temperature reached to 120 Fr, added another 10 min, meat temperature reached to 140 Fr. The ends were well done, in the middle it was medium - rear. It was perfect.

yes, I will make this again!!  I agree it can be a little tough if you don't follow the time per pound and don't add gravy or seasoned water to it.  But, overall it is quick and easy dinner in the week or weekend supper for the family! My husband loved it!!!:)  Sometimes it was a juicy sandwich between bread and you can add a baked potato or mashed potatoes with it.

I wasn't sure what cut of beef it was that I dug out of the freezer, but these instructions worked wonders on it anyway. (Might have been a chuck shoulder...) Thanks to whoever posted this, basic as it may be.

I made it with a couple simple changes.  I chopped red potatoes and rolled them in olive oil and garlic salt in the bottom of the pan. Before cooking I layered the top of the roast with onions and center cut bacon. The bacon grease basted the roast while cooking so it wouldn't dry and the excess grease kept the potatoes nice and moist.  I also put a half a cup of water in the bottom of the pan before i started.  I cooked to 145 in the oven and let it finish on the counter at 150 before slicing.  Rave reviews from all the guests at my dinner party! Let the roast sit to room temperature on the counter before you start for nice even cooking.

I love the ease and idea of this recipe but I guess even with a new gas oven it doesn't fully work.  My 2 1/2 lb eye of round roast was rare,  not medium-rare and cold when I followed the directions.  It was very tender though and I was making a cauliflower rice dish as a side dish so I just stir fried the beef to medium and added it to the rice and thus was pleased with the final product.
I'll be playing with this to see how to make it work for my oven.  I have a 'keep warm' setting that I may try or simply turn the oven down to the lowest temp it has.  Thanks for the great idea, now I'll work to make it fit my oven.

I would definitely make it again. I used steak seasoning and paprika. I made gravy to go with it and mixed in the juices from the beef as recommended by the recipe. It was easy to make and my family loved it.

This is a winner. I had a 3 1/2 pound roast cooked it for 75 minutes. I seasoned it heavily. I did take the suggestion of others and inserted garlic in the roast. It was perfect, not bloody, just pink in the middle.

I added 2 cups of water to the bottom of the pan with a Knorr's beef cube.  I put the 3 lb roast on a rack (sprayed with Pam) and cooked it for 20 minutes per lb.. (1 hour) and it was RAW.  Seriously.  I cooked it another hour and it was still rare.  I don't  understand why you would only cook it for 1 hour.  The seasoning was a bit too much... I wouldn't measure the salt, pepper and garlic powder again, I'd just sprinkle it on.  So I would say this was not a good recipe for me.

The real beauty of this recipe is the simplicity.  The oven does most of the work.  The key is not to over cook and to let the roast rest, as it will continue to cook.  The only change I made was adding the same ratio of pepper to the salt and garlic.  Combine all in a little bowl and then rub on the meat.  Note:  ensure you buy the correct cut of meat.

Made this for dinner tonight.......holy yum!!! Anyone that has had problems with it being tough,the key is letting it sit covered & check with a meat thermometer. Made roasted carrots, peas and roasted garlic mashed potatoes & gravy to go along with it.

I have been making my roast beef ,this way for many years.  It comes out delicious. The only thing do differently is add soy sauce,in which I pour over the whole roast beef to marinate.

Came out perfect. Exactly the right temp and timing per pound for people who like rare to medium rare. Yum. Sitting the roast out for 20 mins at room temperature prior to cooking is also something I have learned before cooking (passed down from my French Mom).

1st let me say this is a recipe for roast beef not pot roast so you can add a small amount of water or broth to the pan but that's it. Cover the pan with foil which traps moisture in. I cook my roast beef the way my grandmother did...500 degrees at 12 mins per pound then turn the oven off & let the meat continue to cook for 2 hrs. Never open the oven! The inital high heat browns the meat sealing the juices in, the remaining time is low & slow. 2nd Never put cold meat in the oven! Pull the meat out of the frig & let it sit 2-3 hrs to come to room temp, otherwise you'll end up with tough dry meat. 3rd When pulling meat out of the oven always let it sit 15-20 mins. It'll continue cooking but you also won't lose any moisture by cutting into too early.

Just like my Nana used to make!  So juicy and tender. I rub roast down with a bit of (2T) grape seed oil before the seasoning. I also quarter new red potatoes and wedges of onion lightly coated in the same oil, s&p, and garlic and add around the roast. Crowd pleaser for sure.

This is the way I always make it except I slice fresh garlic and put it in little slits  here and there.
One thing to remember is to get a roast that has plenty of fat on the bottom. That may be why some roasts aren't turning out tender. 
Remember to have the oven preheated.

I've tried a couple of roast beef recipes from this site, but this recipe is the one I always go back to. It tastes just like my mom's roast beef from when I was younger. I sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper, then poke several holes in it with a steak knife and shove in small slivers of garlic. I cook it as directed, although we like it only slightly pink so I take it out when the meat thermometer reaches 135. Once it sits for 15 min, it is perfection. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Made this for the first time tonight (2/6/16).  Did what it said, 20 minutes per pound.  It came out the perfect medium rare!  My husband said it was the best roast beef I ever made. And yes, tying it up I think, made all the difference in the world, tender and moist.

Wow! This was really easy to do. I added a few sliced mushrooms around the roast along with about a half cup of red wine and a quarter cup water. By the end of the cook time almost all the liquid had evaporated and the flavor of the mushrooms was intensified. I let it rest for about 10 minutes and the juices flowed into the pan. Served the mushrooms on the mashed potatoes. The meat was tender and juicy. Wonderful! And my husband is looking forward to making Manhattan's with the leftovers tomorrow.

Be sure to set roast on counter for a few hours before cooking....I use pepper, garlic powder, ground thyme to season, with 1 lb carrots and 8 oz pearl onions. Preheat  to 475, roast for 12 minutes and reduce heat to 325. Roast 20 minutes per pound, until internal temperature is 1452. Took70 min for 3.4 lb. Removed from pan, covered with foil. In 30 minutes, int temp was 155. Sliced very thin, was faintly pink dead center, more done near ends, served with brown gravy and mashed potatoes. Delicious, said all.

Wonderful! My roast was only 2.4lb so I initially put it in the oven for 40mins, and then checked the temperature, and then put it back in for another 10mins. I took it out when the temperature was 120-125 degrees and then wrapped it in foil and let it sit for about 30mins. The temperature rose about 10 degrees and we ended up with a perfectly cooked roast beef; a little brown around the edges and pinkish internal meat. Like others suggested, I increased the garlic and salt a little, maybe to 3/4 of a teaspoon each, and also added about the same amount of dry thyme. Before eating, we also sprinkled it with a little truffle salt. Very moist and delicious!

Put eye round in plastic bag with ingredients listed plus olive oil (garlic infused), 4 cloves chopped garlic, and fresh chopped rosemary and thyme. Let sit for about 2 hours. Then baked as per directions. For gravy, used 1 chopped onion and lots of mushrooms, sautéed with butter and olive oil. Some kosher salt. Mixed in quick cooking flour, about a cup of beef broth and drippings from cooked roast beef.  Served with horseradish sauce and steamed carrots. Perfect.

Using this method does cause the beef to come out a bit dry but here's what I do...2 hours before cooking, place beef in ziplock bag with 1 cup of zesty Italian dressing (make sure to use regular dressing, NOT LITE because the oil in the regular will help to marinate the beef where the lite is water based and will steam off of the meat drying it out) to marinate. Keep in fridge for those 2 hours, turning meat about every 30 minutes. When placing meat in oven, pour juices from ziplock bag into pan with the beef. Baste beef with juices every 20 minutes during cooking and as stated in recipe, cover with foil (tent) if meat starts to brown too much on top.

This method yields a rare to medium rare roast.  Mine was flavorful and juicy, but I feel the method needs to add a searing step for better color and a little boost toward medium rare.

Amazing roast.  Very delicious. Also I did used little less garlic powder on a top and I also cut girlie cloves on halves and inserted them in the roast all over and baked it with some onion. If u want it to be more tender - bake it with the fat side up and u can bake in a foil, tuck the foil close to the roast creating a very tight form. That way juices from the roast would make it more tender and you don't have to add any water:)

This sure IS an all American roast beef! Very good! :) This is NOT a pot roast and is not meant to be cooked in any liquid. Follow the instructions as described IN THIS RECIPE and you really can't go wrong. Really. You can't. I did use a thermometer and took mine out when it reached 130.  I also added a photo and you can see there is nothing "dry" about it. Moist, juicy meat and a crust that's juicy too!

this is the way our butcher suggests roasting eye of round.  As a matter of fact, this is what he has in the deli for roast beef sandwiches -- no other roast beef, just his that is roasted in the store.  to those that say you need water and slow cooking, it depends on the cut of the roast! Different roasts require different methods of cooking. if folks are not sure, check with a butcher!

Recipe was simple and straightforward... I used a meat thermometer and echo recommendation to pull beef out at 120 degrees......
One note - the beef really lacked any special taste, pretty bland.    It's a solid faithful recipe, maybe consider tasty sauce to complement it.

This was very easy and came out perfectly. I had two roasts, one for med rare the other for medium. I wrapped the med rare in foil and let the other one cook a bit longer. They were very juicy and there was enough drippings for a great gravy. Thanks!

Great flavor!!  We followed our electronic meat thermometer to rare, which was 140 degrees and it ended up medium and a little dried out.  Next time will follow another reviewers advice and pull it out at 120.  We made gravy from the drippings and it was excellent.

It's time to throw away your slow cookers & cook a beef roast the way it was meant to be. I added more seasoning for our taste, but other than that followed this recipe to the letter. This very simple recipe turned out the best roast I've ever made, & I've been cooking for a very long time. Do not skip tying the roast for a very tender, moist roast. This really is so much better than boiling/steaming meat in a slow cooker.

I would give this a 4, my husband would give it a zero.  He doesn't really care for beef roast though so that wouldn't be fair.  This is just a basic simple roast recipe.  I liked it and I'll be eating all the leftovers!

This was very flavorful and tasty.  I bought my roast at Walmart and I guess you get what you pay for...if I had bought a nicer cut I'm sure it would have turned out a 5 star rating.  Thanks, this was very good!

This was just ok for me.  I cooked it at the exact temp. & time as noted in the recipe and left it sitting after cooking it for 15 minutes but the middle was still raw.  THe taste was good on the cooked parts though.

This turned out great!  I also laid the roast on some sliced onions.  I had to cook it a little longer than the recipe called for to get it to medium rare.  I used a meat thermometer.  It was one of the best roasts I have had in a long time!

I had never made a roast beef before, but when I saw how easy this recipe was I decided to try.  My family is so happy I did.  We have had it 3 times since Christmas.  My husband wants a meat slicer now to make sandwichs out of it.

I made a roast per this recipe last night and it turned out perfect!  The only thing I changed was adding a cup of water to the pan.  Thank you Cindy for a wonderful way to make roast beef.  My boyfriend can't wait to dive into the leftovers for sandwiches.

This roast was very easy and delicious. A bit on the rare side for my family, so next time I'll cook it a bit longer.
