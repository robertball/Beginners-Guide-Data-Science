I used the dough recipe from this to make a special occasion cookie. I pressed chocolate chips and chopped walnuts into the dough before baking it.

This was ok. It was quick and easy to make but the taste didn't stand out as much as I thought it would. I tasted the dough before baked and I liked it better then rather than after it was cooked.:-) Recommend if need something easy and it might be fun for a kid to help you with toppings.;-) Just a thought!

I use this recipe for all of my friends birthdays. Everyone gets super excited when they see me walk in with a giant cookie and it is the best thing to share with friends. We sit in a circle and just tear of pieces it's usually done within 5 minutes of being served!
