This was delicious. My husband, three young kids and I all loved it. I used all boneless chicken thighs, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Our house smelled amazing from all of the spices and if I prepped the chicken in advance, this would make for a quick weekday meal.

Perfect! Just added extra chili powder because we like it spicy!

Probably added all the Garamond masala to the Marinade. It was delicious!
