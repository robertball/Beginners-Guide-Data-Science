Two super-foods in one delicious dish!! What I did: made a full cup of quinoa but used only one bunch of kale. I doubled the seasoning (made Creole seasoning from AR) and the salt - that was a mistake! In fact, cut some of the salt - with the chicken broth, you don't need it! I felt that it was lacking some crunch... so I threw in toasted almond slivers and pine nuts - PERFECT! I can't wait to make this again!

We gobbled it up!  This was the first time I made quinoa for my daughters and myself, and the end result was very satisfying.  I used onions in place of shallots, and next time I will use twice as much creole seasoning and no salt.  The quinoa is quite filling.  A bowl full of this kale and quinoa was a meal for me.  Lots of health benefits too!

Good recipe.  We had fresh kale from the garden so I didn't do the blanching step, which was a nice time saver.  I didn't have onion so just saut√©ed the kale in garlic and coconut oil, which adds another level of flavor to greens.  I think onions would have been a nice addition.  I also didn't have creole seasoning and after a little research ended up using cajun seasoning with some extra basil, thyme and oregano, which tasted good.  Added some almonds as some other reviewers suggested but probably would not do that next time since it didn't seem to add much for us, but left it on the stove due to some timing issues so the nuts didn't add the crunch factor others mentioned, so that could be it.  Wanted to add the lemon others suggested, but also didn't have any (hmmm, looks like we have a theme developing!); so I added a splash or two of white wine vinegar to give it a little zip.  That was good, but I still think lemon would be better.  Will definitely try again when I have lemons and onions!

I used blanched and shocked endive instead of kale, and it was a bit too bitter.  Season with Creole seasoning first and use low sodium chicken broth.  Mine was too salty.

I added a clove of garlic and doubled the seasoning and still thought it was bland. I'd recommend tripling the seasoning and added some red peppers or something else to give it some more flavor.

Delicious! I added shrimp, a little garlic, used vegetable broth and omitted the salt. The only problem... we enjoyed it so much that there wasn't enough! I'll definitely make it again.

This was absolutely amazing! This was my first time having quinoa.  I didn't have shallots so I substituted with scallions... wonderful flavor. I made this with Pork tenderloin and mango salsa. Such amazing flavors combined. A winner in our home!

This was absolutely delicious. I used Roland garlic quinoa and vegetable stock instead of plain quinoa and water. This was very flavorful, I thought it would be bland but it was not. I could not find creole seasoning so I substituted Emeril's Bayou Blast. If you like flavor try my version I think you will like it. Great recipe!

A winner that I'll definitely make again! The creole seasoning and shallot added great flavor to the quinoa and kale ~ I love Creole seasoning and spice so I doubled (and then some!) the amount. Great leftovers, too!!

Holy salt overload...I love salt and it was too salty even for me.  I would cut the salt at least in half next time, other than that, it was delicious and I will definitely be making it again.

I made this as directed, except I added some minced garlic to the pan to saute for about a minute just before adding the blanched kale.  I thought it was just okay that night, but the leftovers over the next two days were delicious!  (I made a double batch and ate the leftovers for lunches.)  This is one of those recipes that tasted better the next day.  My family didn't love it the first night, either, and none were interested in the leftovers (their loss, my gain.)  I'd give it a 3.5. I'd rate it higher if the rest of my family liked it.

Very good recipe. I used a bunch of swiss chard from my garden instead of kale and didn't blanch them ,just stir fried them With the onion.

I absolutely love this recipe. It has been a go to for me for a couple of years now.  I leave out the salt (the creole seasoning and the chicken broth have plenty on their own), add some fresh garlic, and add additional veggies based on season and what I have around the house.  Some of my favorites are  mushrooms, zucchini and asparagus. I saute the garlic, shallot (or onion) and what every other veggie I am adding.  Then I add the blanched kale when they are close to finished, sauteing for another 5 minutes before tossing with the quinoa.  And I never measure the creole seasoning I just add to taste.  I will put a bit in while I saute and add a bit after I mix it all together. It

This was very good, but WAY too salty!!! I used the full amount of salt and Creole seasoning (same brand as recommended), but it was just about too salty to even eat. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until after I added all the salt that "Tony Chachere's" Creole seasoning has salt in it and they say to use it like salt! I will make this recipe, again, but will eliminate the plain salt altogether and just use the seasoning. 
I did add some toasted pine nuts to the mix, as well, and it was a tasty addition.

Filling, healthy side dish, went well with some baked cod I sprinkled with Cajun seasonings.  Subbed low sodium veggie broth for the chicken broth.  One note:  1t salt + 1/2t of Creole/Cajun seasoning is A LOT of sodium.  We found we didn't need the salt at all.

This recipe is very simple and extremely healthy. It makes a great light meal but I'd recommend adding chicken or using it as a side dish if you want a full meal.

This is a relatively quick and healthy side dish that goes great with anytime! I've made it twice.  The first time it seemed to "need something" so I added more creole seasoning, but that was too salty. The 2nd time I made it, I added about 1/2 cup of black beans and some Old Bay Seasoning (about 1/2 teaspoon) and the regular amount of creole seasoning. Perfect! With the addition of the beans, it is very hearty and could serve as a great light lunch.

Changed up recipe a bit (which is why it didn't get 5 stars). Didn't need to add salt; creole spices were enough (and only 1/2 teaspoon).  I used about 1 cup of finely chopped kale as "a bunch" can sometimes be too much. I used  chopped Vidalia onion instead of scallion (other than color, scallions contribute little to taste). Quinoa needs more than 10 minutes of simmer to get tender. Blanching the kale improves taste and texture-worth the extra step (can ice bath kale while cooking quinoa). I really liked this recipe and will make again.

This is one of the best side dishes I have ever made but can also be a main with chicken on top.  I'm so glad I made lots because I am eating the leftovers for lunch today.
I used the creole seasoning recipe on All Recipes and it was so good.  The only changes I made was I omitted the salt from the kale because there was enough salt in the creole seasoning and I used onion because I can never find shallots.  This recipe is going in my recipe box for future use.

I liked this enough to make it again.  A good way to get in those "greens".  For the spice I used lime salt and not the Creole spice listed and it added and interesting flavor.  I cooked the kale longer than suggested to get it to the consistency that I wanted.  Good for a packed lunch.

This would have been WAY too salty as written.  Perhaps it's a typo to use 1 tsp. of salt and 1/2 tsp. of seasoning salt.  I halved that amount, and it was borderline too salty.  I also think there should be more quinoa.  If I make it again, I will try it with a full cup of quinoa and watch the salt amounts.

This recipe was so much better than I had thought it would be.  I'm not a kale fan, but there's no doubt about its nutritional value.  I used Scots kale, because that's what I had.   I removed central stem and cut the leaves into thin strips, and I blanched it for about two minutes longer than the recipe suggested.  I also added a little closer to a tablespoon of Cajun seasoning, which is already salty enough, so no extra salt added.  I didn't have Tabasco, or I would have added some of that for a little extra tang.

Added beans, half a green pepper and a couple tablespoons of vinegar.  A really flavorful healthy meal.

This was a great recipe. Even our 4 year old daughter are it. I did sub onions for shallots. I also used a mix of olive oil and chili pepper infused oil to saute the kale. Will definitely maker this again.

This was pretty good!  Will make again.  I did add beans and some lemon juice, to brighten it up a bit and make it a meal.  For those at a high altitude (we are always forgotten about when people write these recipes) the quinoa is always best cooked by increasing the liquid by a little less than 1/4 cup or so, and turning it to more like a "medium low" than a "low", when it comes time.  Also, increase cooking time by a few minutes, for liquid to be adaquately absorbed.  Oh, and I found it to be a bit salty as well.  I would cut the salt in half and add a little more cajun seasoning.

So delicious! I ended up adding a tablespoon of lemon juice, half a can of chickpeas, and an extra half teaspoon of spice, but it was a delicious side/main dish even before that. My husband and I devoured the whole thing for dinner.
