Good base recipe. I used this to make a multigrain cinnamon raisin bread.  

 I swapped out 1 cup of the bread flour for 2 cups of ground oats, added an egg for richness, used up my slightly sour milk instead of water,  added 1 cup of raisins (soaked in the milk with the wet ingredients, 1 Tbs of molasses.  AFter the over night rest I rolled out the dough to about 1/2 inch thick then applied a cinnamon sugar mix to it like cinnamon rolls.  Rolled up the bread then let it rise.  For the cinnamon sugar mix I used 1/4 c brown sugar, 2 Tbs white sugar, and 1 Tbs cinnamon.  Made 4 BIG loaves.  Don't add cinnamon to the bread before the rising because it's an antifungal and can interfere with the yeast.

I tried this bread because I had never made yeasted bread before. I did however make quick bread and thought this would be along similar lines. First of all I followed the recipe exactly. I ended up with a lot more dough than the recipe would suggest. I had to divide between 2 really large bowls. It too much dough to put in just 2 loaf pans so I ended up putting it in 2, 9 inch, round pans. However the real problem was the oven temperature. I set my oven at 500 degrees. I brushed the tops with egg wash and put them in the oven for 15 minutes with a pan of water underneath the bread as directed. After 15 minutes the bread was beautifully brown. The recipe stated to tent them which I did and leave them in the oven for another 45 to 60 minutes! I left them for another 10 minutes before noticing a burning smell. Both loaves were badly burned on the bottom and one was burned on the side. When i cut away the burnt part the bread itself is very good. But I think I will learn to knead bread.

I love this kind of grain bread.  I had some steel cut oats that I needed to use.  My mom used to make wheat bread that looked a lot like this bread.  I love the crunchy crust, the thick texture of the bread, and it tastes delicious toasted!  Hubby loves it too!
Will make again, as soon as I get some more steel cut oats!

This is my recipe, and I also make it with the 9 grain mix that does not have to be toasted. I usually use coconut palm sugar as the sweetener. This bread is great for toasting, but toasting takes more time than store bread. This is not like any bread you can buy in a store, and you know what goes into it. I make multiple loaves and freeze them after slicing. That way I can use slices as I need them.
