This recipe is very similar to one by Paula Deen on the Food Network.  I sliced up my potatos and boiled them for a quicker cooking time and easier mashing.  Used fat free cottage cheese and ommited the sour cream.  Added a few pats of butter and folded in a sauteed chopped onion for rich flavor.  Topped the mixture with Mexican cheese blend, salt and pepper.  Baked in a 9 x 12 dish.  I was terrified of failure when I scooped them out and they were runny (!) however they did set up nicely after sitting for a bit while my meatloaf rested.  I suggest draining the cottage cheese.  A good recipe when you want something tasty that will not be covered in gravy, but I am still searching for my all-time favorite potato recipe.

This was a great recipe that wowed my wife when she arrived home from work.I did find that you might need to drain the cottage cheese over the sink before continuing.I added a little bit of garlic powder and some salt and pepper to liven it up a bit.

This was really excellent.  If you use fresh or frozen raw hashbrown cut potatoes you don't have to cook them first.  Definitely salt and pepper the potatoes before adding the other ingredients.  I used full-fat cottage cheese and then low fat cheddar and sour cream and it came out great.  To avoid runniness:  take the cottage cheese and the sour cream and blend in the blender till smooth.  Line a colander with cheesecloth and put in a bowl.  Turn the cheese mixture in and let it drain for a couple of hours before continuing on with the recipe.  I also threw in some cheddar with the cottage cheese and sour cream. Comes out really great that way.  Thank you, Stephanie!

This is a great recipe.  The trick is to be sure you cook it long enough, and it will not be runny.  I added 1/2 cup chopped chives to the cottage cheese and omitted the onion. I added 1/4 cup Parmesan and salt and pepper.  Terrific.  Also, I measured my potatoes.  There was approximately 3 cups after cubing them.

A great way to serve potatoes.  My family loved it.  I used fat-free sour cream and cottage cheese and added extra cheddar--it turned out well.  You have to be sure to leave the dish UNCOVERED while baking, or the sauce will be too thin.  Let it stand for 5-10 minutes before serving.

I think that this recipe turned out wonderful. I didn't have the cottage cheese with chives or any chives on hand , so I substituted dried parsley, and added about 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper. Thanks Stephanie!.

Well I couldn't find chive-flavored cottage cheese so I added snipped fresh chives to the regular stuff. With the addition of a little salt and pepper, this was so delicious. Husband wasn't impressed but then he doesn't much care for mashed potatoes anyway. Thanks, Stephanie. I'll be making this again!

I did my own thing after reading this recipe. I grated the potatoes and tossed them with salt, pepper and cottage cheese. I put it in a baking dish, topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and baked at 350 for 40-45 mins. I think it would be good mixing the cheddar cheese in before baking. 
Anyway, it made a sort-of half mashed potato/half hashbrown kind of thing. 
It's fun to experiment.

Very tasty!  I loved the consistancy.  It was a little runny right out of the oven, but set up nicely as it cooled down.  Did add salt, pepper, parsley, and garlic to give it a little flavor since I couldn't find chive-flavored cottage cheese.  I think next time I will add more cheddar too, just to make it cheesier.

I found this recipe while trying to find a mashed potato recipe which substituted milk, since I was out. I doubled the recipe and didn't use the oven at all.  I boiled the potatoes quartered and drained when soft.  I put them back in the pot to mix and mash with 1.5 lbs of fat free sour cream, 2 lbs of nonfat cottage cheese, 1/2 an onion and 3 oz of bacon flavored chips, and salt and pepper to taste. I topped the serving with Mexican blend shredded cheese and melted on top in microwave.  My daughter loves it and I love that it's lower in fat and calories!

I was craving cheesy mashed potaoes, and these were very good.  I used nonfat cottage cheese (drained it first, and then blended it to make it smooth) and nonfat cream cheese.  The cream cheese was the plain kind, so I just added some garlic, onion, and parsley.  Very flavorful and creamy.

I really liked the way this recipe turned out. I forgot to add seasoning at first and already had everything combined, also the shredded cheese on top - so I put the mixture into a bowl again - added salt, pepper and a little garlic - gave it a good stir. Then I put everything back to the casserole dish again and added parmesan cheese on top. Turned out great :)

Great recipe!  I only made a few adjustments.  I added half the cheese IN the potatoes and the other half on top prior to baking.  I also added 1 tsp. salt, some garlic powder, and some paprika to the potatoes while combining all the ingredients.

This was a wonderful dish. I just used regular cottage cheese, but I also added ham. I loved it, very creamy!

This casserole reminds me of my mom's homemade perogies - without the mess or fuss of making them. I like to season it well with salt and pepper and layer the potatoe mixture between cooked lasagna noodles and cook for about 30 minutes with some butter and extra cheddar over the top noodles. Fabulous!

I made this for my in-laws for our Christmas dinner.  Everyone really liked it.  I doubled the recipe and made these adjustments:
5lb bag of red skin potatoes ( leaving the skins on)
1 Container chive cottage cheese
16 oz light sour cream 
10 green onions
16 oz shredded cheddar cheese
1/4 cup real bacon pieces
It turned out with a great consistancy, but bairly fit in my 9 x 13" cake pan. The left overs are especially good with ranch powder mixed in.  I would rate it 5 stars next time if I added 2-3 tablespoons ranch powder.  It really adds a lot! I will be making this again!

I located this recipe using the "ingredients" tab since I was low on everything. I skipped the sour cream since I didnt have any and since it appeared it made the dish too thin. I quartered some cherry tomatoes and used onion powder instead of onions. I sprinkled some Bac-os on top and the end & turned on the broiler. It was a little thin but as another reviewer suggested, I let it stand. My dad, who hates my cooking, asked for some to take home.

Very nice potato dish.  I needed to use up some ricotta so subbed that for the cottage cheese.  I grated the onion for more flavor.  Made just the right amount for the two of us with leftovers for lunch.

I found the onion in it to be a little much.  I did try it with less onion and lightly fried up.  It was a lot better.  I also used dry curd cottage cheese so it wouldn't be as runny. I also added a small amount spices to give it a little extra boost.

I baked instead of boiled the potatoes.  Substituted mayo for sour cream.  Served this recipe twice over Thanksgiving and it was a hit both times.  I'll use this recipe often.

I got very disappointed by this recipe. Although my friends said it was very flavorful,
and one of them thought it was the best potato dish she's ever had, it got really 'watery' 
- I guess it's because of the cottage cheese... or maybe cream? Anyway, by the time the 
potatoes were hardly baked, the rest was just a liquid. I've seen better baked potato dishes.
The combination of ingredients is still very (!) tasty though, so I'd suggest boiling the 
potatoes, sauteing the onions and mixing that with the sour cream and cottage cheese
and serving as a salad rather than as a baked dish. That'd be really yummy! :)

Thought this was a good recipe! Although I didn't drain my cottage cheese, there was runny bits in it but tastes great! My tip is to add a bit of cream cheese in with it also, extra cheesy!

Very good!  I substituted 1/4 cup mayonaise for the sourcream, and used large curd cottage cheese. I sliced the potatoes similar to scalloped potatoes.  I also added powdered ranch dressing mix fof flavor.  Came out the perfect flavor and not too cheesy.

This was very good. Since I just had plain cottage cheese I added dried parsley and garlic to the mixture and some garlic powder too. This gave it a great flavor! I used ricotta cheese instead of the sour cream, because I did not have any and even though it was good, it may have given it the wrong consistency. Next time I will do it with the sour cream to see if it goes from good to great!

Quite good! I made was to stir the cheddar in with everything else.  I didn't have any chives available, so I used a little Oregano.  My husband did suggest that I either saute the onions first or just skip them, so I might try that next time.

Good easy recipe.  I had cottage cheese and sour cream in my fridge to use up and when i searched online for a recipe that used both this recipe came up!  Many of the reviews I have read mashed the potatoes but i left them in the cubed form - I think this looks more appealing when finished and seems less runny.  Certainly draining cottage cheese helps.  I also turned the grill/broiler on for the final few minutes to give the top a lovely browned finish.

The potatos were okay, but I did add extra sharp shredded cheddar cheese and salt/pepper and it still needed more flavor.  I cubed and boiled the potatos, but I guess I didn't boil them long enough because I ended up having to bake the potatos for 1 hr 15 min.  I am giving this four stars because the potatos were much better the next day being reheated.  If I make this again, I will add more seasoning.

These tasted OK, but definitely lacked something flavor-wise.  Also, I didn't care for the raw onion flavor.  Maybe if I had sauteed the onions first as one previous reviewer suggested it would have tasted better.

We made this recipe last night with a few variations.  It was great.  Instead of boiling the potatoes, I took red potatoes (instead of 5 I used 6 very large potatoes) and microwaved them-we cut them up with the skins on.  Quick and less mess.

I did not have chive cottage cheese so I used regular--omitted the onion--added some garlic salt, and pepper to taste--and 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese.  

It was not at all runny, was plenty yummy, and the family went nuts on it!

I fixed this for Easter dinner and was disappointed.  My guests all loved it, but for me it seemed to not have much flavor.  I'll stick to my old cheesy potato recipe!

Well, I would of given it a 3 (it was edible, just way too bland even after I doctored it up), but when DH said "put this on your don't make again list" I had to go with a 2.  Sorry, just wasn't for us.

I served this at a bridal shower, and several people said they liked it.  However, this dish didn't really impress me - it was a little on the bland side.

I goofed on this and mashed the potatoes before adding ingredients, and it was good - didn't think my husband would like it at all, but he raved about it!  Will have to try it with cubed potatoes next time though.

They were good, but very runny.  I substituted fresh chives and regular sour cream for the onion and chive sour cream.  I added parmesan cheese as well.  Still a bit bland though.

I used frozen shredded hash browns rather than fresh potatoes and dried minced onion, which made it even speedier.  Also used my own seasonings rather than the chive cottage cheese.  Turned out wonderfully.  The cottage cheese and sour cream as the base were the winning combination.

My partner loved these potatoes and said he wants these once a week.  I found the "cheesiness" a bit much.  Be careful not to overcook the potatoes before they go into the oven.
