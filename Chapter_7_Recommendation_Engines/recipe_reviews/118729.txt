Considering its simplicity and comforting taste, this recipe is hard to beat. I added some carrots and cooked bacon. Slice the potatoes very thinly or I'll take more than 15 min to cook. Usually, cabbage dishes go well with mustard, this one is no exception. A keeper.

A whole lot better than I expected! I used bratwurst for the sausage. I left out the green pepper and doubled the garlic. The Worcestershire sauce is KEY! I would add some sour cream on top to make it a 5 star recipe.

We loved this dish. I omited the green pepper as suggested by other reviewers & it still turned out great. The potatoes add a nice flavor to ordinary sausage & cabbage. The worchestershire sauce made this dish. Next time I make this I think I will use Andouille sausage for a little added spice.

I loved this. It was so easy but tasted so good. I omitted the green pepper and I fried my onions with the sausage, and for a little heat I used about 1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper.

This was really tasty. I used a chicken apple saussage in this, used a whole red onion, left out the green pepper and used a bag of shredded cabbage. Very fast once you got past the slicing of the potatoes. I do think it ook a little longer than 15 minutes to get the potatoes cooked, but not too much longer.

Thanks for the easy meal! I microwaved the potatoes for 3 minutes before adding them to the pot. I also added a dash of red wine vinegar. Good and Simple!

Fantastic! Probably even better tomorrow. Didn't have any pepper but otherwise followed the recipe. I did change the cooking directions.   I also used the slicer on my cheese grater for the potatoes and they cooked up nicely as they were really thin and even.   Saute the sausage and set aside. Add butter to the pan, saute the onions, add potatoes and worchestershire sauce, then finally cabbage. After about 5 minutes return sausage and cover for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally until the cabbage is med-well cooked.

Nice, fast, easy to make dinner.  Our three year old son loved this meal.  You really need a large skillet to make the whole recipe...we basically halved the ingredients and they still barely fit in the pan.

I served this over rice, and the whole family loved it!  Although the ingredients are simple, it has a lovely taste.  I didn't use the green pepper or garlic, and I diced the potatoes so that they'd cook faster.  For those who haven't cooked cabbage before, it cooks down a lot so don't worry about piling it up in the pan.

This was overall a simple and quick meal, but we felt the flavor was missing something.  We tried adding a bit of vinegar, but that wasn't it!

My husband only wanted to give this dish 3 stars but I thought it deserved more so I split the difference at 4. This was a great alternative to our usual Sausage, Cabbage, and Noodles. The addition of kale I happened to have added some nice contrast. I sliced my potatoes very thin using a mandolin. I found it took much longer than 15 minutes to cook the cabbage down to the desired consistency; closer to 45 min. to 1 hour on low. If I make this again I will probably add some cooked bacon for added flavour.

This was really good Yvette! I took "Happy In the Kitchen's" advice and added beef broth for everything to simmer in. As always, I added more seasonings including a smoked sea salt which complimented the sausage nicely. We've got lots of cabbage growing in the garden and this was the perfect dish to make good use of it. Thank you!!

I only had a few ingredients on hand -cabbage, smoked sausage, sweet potato, salt/pepper and worcestershire sauce. It was so addictive, I couldn't stop eating it!

Pretty good! I skipped the bell pepper, and added in extra garlic, a sliced carrot, and about 2 tablespoons of vegetable broth to help get it cooking. My potatoes were sliced thinly with a mandolin, but it still took about 25 minutes to cook.

Really good for being so simple.  I paper thin cut the potatoes and they still weren't all the way done at 15 minutes.  More like 25 was perfect.  I used some purple cabbage from my garden and it was funny cause it turned the potatoes purple!  We liked this a lot..thanks!

Very good! I tweaked it a little, I wasn't in the mood for kielbasa so I used Chicken Apple Sausage, I also couldn't find single red potatoes at my local grocery store so I didn't add any. I also added red wine vinegar in the end. I will add apple chunks and smoked bacon pieces next time I make it.

This is a great simple go to meal when you need a quick dish in a hurry, but as much as I enjoy it I can only give it 4 stars for this 1 reason... my potatoes never cook all the way through. I tried and I tried and I tried but no matter how thin I sliced it just never happened. That's when I learned the secret... Dice the potatoes! Cook sausage in a little oil first then use same oil for the dish with the potatoes in first, then cover potatoes with the cabbage. Not only will the potatoes cook all the way through, but you also get these Tasty brown bits through out!

This is a hit with our family.  I brown the sausage, peppers and onions well until caramelized.  I then add broth to deglaze the pan, then add the  cabbage.  The browning well flavors and colors the broth.  We don't even think about adding potatoes any more.

Yummy and super easy. I had a bag of shredded hashbrowns I wanted to use up so I used those, I wouldn't recommend it they looked like the cabbage and were so small you couldn't really taste the potato. I had some jalapeno cheese sausage that I thought worked great added a little heat!!

I really enjoyed this easy meal. It had a European flavor to it. I did not change a thing.The worcestershire is the key to this dish and the green pepper did not overpower this dish. I would make again. Thanks for sharing

This was good and I'll probably make it again.  The only changes I made were to add some caraway seed, some Polish seasoning (Krakow Nights from Penzey's) and two diced apples.  It was a very good meal for a cold winter night.

Soooo easy and yummy.  I did not have a bell pepper, so I left that out.  I had to cook for about 30 minutes for the potato to cook through.  I think it would have been good to pop it in the oven and bake it, maybe I will try that next time.  Overall easy and good!

I didn't add the green peppers or potatoes in but lightly fried some sliced sweet potatoes as a side. I also add chopped apples. Both my husband and I really enjoyed it.I also used red onions instead.

Loved this dish. I did change it, but still had to give the recipe 5 stars. I used 1 lb of smoked sausage, 1/2 head cabbage, 1/2 yellow bell pepper (what I had on hand) and 1/2 yellow onion. I didn't use any potatoes,and I used a bit over  a Tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce. and then added a bit of salt and pepper. turned out amazing. I just cooked until I thought it was done, didn't time it, but probably 15 minutes or so.

Good quick recipe, but needed some extra flavor if you make it exactly as listed. I think next time I will try some additional seasoning and maybe a bit of liquid to keep it from getting to dry. Brown mustard and/or sour cream were great additions to the finished product. You also need to have a massive skillet. We have a really huge skillet and it still overflowed using average sized veggies. I probably had 1/4 of a cabbage I couldn't fit in.

This was okay to me but my family liked it and they hate cabbage.  The only changes I made was to omit the green pepper and add a little soy sauce.  I served it over rice made with beef broth.

I make a version of this that's very similar. Keep everything the same except omit the green peppers and replace the potatoes with apples. Your pick of variety. And only a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Super delicious, easy, and low carb!

This a a very easy, great-tasting recipe. Very filling, especially on a cool, fall day. In my version, I omitted green pepper (some of my family doesn't like green pepper), added a can of tomatoes and a pip of fresh garlic, and used chicken andouille sausage. Family loves it!

This is a keeper and I did make changes just using what I had on hand.  Loose garlic sausage from a local butcher shop, left out green pepper as I am not a fan, and the extra garlic as it was already in the sausage.  Did add a can of beer after adding the cabbage as sausage was so lean there wasn't much fat to keep from stickng and to help wilt the cabbage.  Turned out great as there were no leftovers and Husband loved it.  Will be making this again.

Really good recipe! I had to cook it a bit longer since my potatoes weren't super thin (next time I'll try microwaving them for a few minutes first.) I also didn't have green pepper so used red instead.  We added mustard upon serving and I added sour cream to mine as well which made it even better. Nice simple dish which allows for variety and additions, like using Tony Chachere's as my extra seasoning.

We loved this (me and hubby at least) Our son wasn't too fond of the worcestershire sauce. I browned the onions and garlic with the sausage before adding the rest of the ingredients. This is a very yummy budget friendly meal!

I used canned potatoes and cooked them separately.  Added to skillet with other ingredients for last 5 minutes to mingle flavors.  My husband came back for seconds and made himself stop before eating more.  He loved it.  Thanks.

I made this last night and we really liked this. I did not put in the green peppers because I did not have any on hand. Also, I did not have potatoes in it because I don't eat potatoes, but I stayed with the rest of the recipe as written and we love this dish! Thank you so much for this recipe. I never would have thought to put worcestershire in with cabbage, but it made it delicious.

I really enjoyed this, DH not too sure.  I added a splash of cider vinegar towards the end of cooking time and some cajun seasoning.  Nice new way to make our kielbasa.

I was really looking forward to this dish... However, I found as written, it is rather bland.  I ended up throwing in a bunch of seasoning, caraway seeds, garlic powder, onion salt, paprika, etc...  and topped it off with sour cream.  It was better but probably won't make again.

Super simple and very hearty and satisfying. I didn't have any onion and don't care for green pepper, so omitted those but still delicious. The cabbage was so good I think I'd rather have more of that and less of the sausage. Apples would be delicious in this as well.

I have been cooking this recipe for years and it is a good meal at any time. Make some cornbread, dice up red onion or green onion(do both)to sprinkle on top for color .

Really good base recipe.  Me and my family like lots of flavor in our food so I added some beef broth, bacon and more spices (mostly Tony Chachere's to zing it up a little).  Put in more minced garlic than recipe called for  as well as a little more Worchestershire and cooked some rice in the remaining beef broth from what I added to the main dish.  Did not add the bell pepper because I did not have any on hand but would have been a nice touch.  So good!!!

I used pork sausage (breakfast type) since we raise our own hogs and left out the green peppers.  

I used 1 tsp roasted garlic (canned) instead of the clove.  

Smells fantastic... can't wait to try it.!

This was delicious. I had never made cabbage before, so I made this recipe on a whim. My husband said he'd let me make it again, and he rarely says that about new recipes! Thanks for this!

This was fantastic! I made it tonight because I had kielbasa and cabbage I needed to use. I followed the recipe for the most part. I doubled the garlic and put in a little xtra Worchestshire sauce, we had pepper and used one, glad we did. We also had leftover potatoes and carrots from the night before and I threw them in the skillet, warmed it up and it was ready in 15 minutes. I was a little unsure how the kids would take it. But my 2,4, and 8 year olds cleaned there bowls, cabbage and all! Thanks!

I thought this was very good.  It reminded me of a dish my Hungarian Grandma used to make.  I will make again.
