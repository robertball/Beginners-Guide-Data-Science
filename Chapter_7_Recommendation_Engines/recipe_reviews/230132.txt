The PERFECT pumpkin pie. Delicately spiced, lightly sweetened with absolutely NO CRACKS. VERY good. NOTE: I did cover the pie halfway through with foil to keep the crust from burning.

A friend brought this pie to our Thanksgiving dinner today. I was skeptical about anything that differed from the traditional pumpkin pie recipe that I have been making for decades. Was I wrong! I love the texture of this pie, and it is not too sweet. It's the only pumpkin pie I'll make from now on - thanks, Chef John (and thanks to my friend Sue for bringing this great pie to our Thanksgiving celebration.)

Thanks Chef John, I used your recipe but added 1/4 of the Chinese 5 spice instead of 1/8 and I took 2nd place in a pumpkin pie contest!

AMAZING!!!!  No crack! I admit...I watched the video and then had to try this pie for Thanksgiving. Although I used a store bought deep dish pie shell....this filling was incredible. Easy and delicious! I too agree that the extra egg yolks made this very rich and creamy. Some pumpkin pies have a bit of a grainy texture....Not this pie, rich, creamy and smooth! I did omit the Chinese 5 spice since I had non on hand....I dont really think it mattered....it was perfectly spiced for us. My family love this pie....it will be my goto pumpkin pie from now on....never again with the evaported milk....its all about the sweetened condensed and the extra yolks. Perfection! Thanks!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year for our big family celebration dinner..followed by an evening dessert hour with family and neighbors.  Served all desserts the next day for another neighborhood get together.  I'm very sorry to say that the pumpkin pie WAS NOT a hit..I was hearing things like "it tastes like medicine" for each and every presentation.  NOT what a girl wants to hear after spending time making pies!!  Think I'll stick to a more traditional pie next year!!  Sorry Chef John...there WON'T be a repeat of this one at our humble abode..

Just made this last night and WOW!! My husband who loves pumpkin pie said it was the best he has ever had.  Believe the "no cracking" statement because mine came out flawless!  The texture of the pie was spot on, smooth and creamy.  The only change I did was due to not being able to find the chinese 5 spice.  So I just spiced with the normal cinnamon,  pumpkin pie spice, and all spice.  Topped with homemade whipped cream and we've already eaten half the pie!  I would also recommend getting Chef John's pie crust recipe.  It is amazing! (I used that for the pumpkin pie).  The directions call to mix in a food processor, but I don't have one so I just mix it the old fashion way.  Made his crust several times now and turns out perfect every time.  That is my go to crust from now on!  Happy baking!

This pie is delectable - rich and perfectly sweet and spicy. A treat for the taste buds! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used fresh (roasted and then pureed) pumpkin. Besides the pumpkin prep, this recipe is so easy. Little clean-up, and super quick. The crust did get a little overdone, but as another reviewer noted, foil will probably solve that.

Fixed these for Thanksgiving and everyone who tried them loved them. I was told they are much better than bakery bought and others claimed they were the best they had ever tried. I did not have the Chinese 5 spice on hand, so I supplemented with 1/8 tsp of cloves and it was perfect. And yes, the claim is correct, not a single crack! I now refuse to make any other recipe. They were so creamy good.

This is the best, creamiest, most beautiful pumpkin pie ever. Try not to substitute the fresh nutmeg or five spice. Most big grocery stores have it in their Asian section and it is not expensive. As usual, Chef John's recipes do not disappoint!

Tried it but used 2 cups of fresh pumpkin puree from pie pumpkins instead of the canned stuff, very tasty and was a huge hit with the whole family.

Perfect pumpkin pie.  This is deceptively simple, with relatively few ingredients.  It will be my go-to recipe from here on out.  I used Pillsbury ready to use pie crust because I didn't have time to make up my own.  I also didn't have Chinese five spice, so I just replaced with a scant 1/8tsp of ground cloves.  Rich, creamy, perfect balance of pumpkin and spice.  Thank you Chef John!

Excellent recipe! I used ground cloves in place of the Chinese 5-spice, other than that no changes were made. The result was a creamy, perfectly spiced pie with no cracks. Thank you Chef John for an amazing pumpkin pie recipe!

I've been cooking/baking for over 20 years, and until now, I've never made a pumpkin pie! I decided on this recipe and what a great decision...it was easy and SO good!!! Made a pretty presentation for the holiday crowd, too :) Making another one (or 2!) today for a get together! I should mention I replaced the Chinese spice with pumpkin pie spice...

This pie came out incredibly light and custard like - mmmm!   The spices don't overpower at all.  I did use 1 Tsp. fresh grated ginger instead of dried (this pie can handle more if you love ginger)!  I would do as Chef John suggests & sprinkle spice of choice as a garnish. My only reservation about this recipe is using processed sweetened condensed milk. In the future I will try this again with a homemade substitution.  
The Chinese 5 Spice I bought from store lists: Cinnamon, Anise Seed, Cloves, Ginger, and Fennel Seed (similar to traditional pumpkin pie spice with more of a licorice scent / flavor from the anise and fennel).

Old fashioned feel and by far the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. I wish I could find the words to describe this treasure of a recipe. It is a string flavor and very hardy, but light. It is just... perfect. Never tasted any pumpkin pie as perfect as this. It has a wonderful home make, comfort food feeling to it. LOVE IT.

Update on December 5th 2014
I have made over a dozen of these pies to give out now, and the response is amazing. I made two of these pies for Thanksgiving and everybody LOVED them! Thank you so much John. It was the last family gathering we will ever have, and they will remember that homemade pie from me. It means more then I can express in words. SO thank you.

Made this for the first time around Thanksgiving and making it again for Christmas. I made a few changes-- I had a real pumpkin at Thanksgiving, which I pureed in my Vitamix. I substituted that for a can.  I also did not have the Chinese 5-spice so I added a tiny bit more ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon. I have to say the magic might be in the real pumpkin (which was not a special baking pumpkin, just the one I'd gotten from the grocery store before Halloween), but whatever it was, best pie ever. Now reusing the same pumpkin puree, which I had put in the freezer, to make it again. I also appreciated the tips about mixing in the accompanying video as I'm a novice home baker who typically just throws it all together, but I love to learn about the real chemistry of baking. Thank you for this recipe, Chef John!

For Thanksgiving I ended up useing fresh steamed pumpkin that I allowed to cool completly and when I made this recipe again at Cheistmas, I used some of the left over pumpkin that I had froze. Both times this pie came out PERFECT with out a crack to bee seen!! I also went to Foodwishes.com and got his pie crust recipes.  As Chef John says, Enjoy!

This is the kind of pie that brings joy to a once-a-year pumpkin pie baker. It's perfectly spiced, with a great texture that's not overly custardly if you know what I mean. So easy, and came out just the way CJ said it would. (Can I call Chef John CJ? Because I feel like he's a real pal in the kitchen.)

I made three pumpkin pies, all from all recipes.com  - The other two were hits, this one was not    The sweetened condensed milk version of this pie just ruined it.  Too thick, dry and sweet.

This pumpkin pie was amazing. The secret Chinese 5 spice blend added just the right amount of depth to the flavor. My friend, who has a very advanced palate, ate two pieces for dessert and another piece after breakfast. Thank you Chef John!!

I made two pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving this year - this one and one that uses evaporated milk mixed w/ sugar and HANDS DOWN this is better.  I absolutely love this recipe and will be adding it to the book :)

Ooh, my, I love this pie! My hubby thought it was perfect even though I thought maybe the spices were too strong-of course when I tried it, he was right (him 345,999,999/ me 1). It was worth losing this one, so thank you Chef John!

It's alright. Certainly pretty, because it really doesn't crack as described. Easy too. Maybe I'm just a fan of less dense pumpkin pie. I'm also not sold on the Chinese Five Spice shortcut.

Very good recipe. I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned. Good flavor but I will add more spices next time, maybe even double whats in the recipe. I didn't have 5 spice so I just left it out. I love the creamy texture and nope, mine did not crack! Coulndn't believe I was lucky enough to bake a pumpkin pie without a crack! Thank you Chef John!!

Wonderful taste, but the bottom crust was undercooked so i baked it 20 mins more 
i think next time i should use a metal pie pan one not the pie dish one that takes so much time to cook the piecrust thoroughly ,or i heard that if u pre-cook your pie filling then its easier to bake ur pie crust ,,,, 

i used fresh japanense kabocha squash and i added 2tbsps each cinnamon and ginger cuz i love ginger n cinnamon 
i also added some finely crushed cloves. added 2Tbsps of Cognac to make it even more luxurier,,, i think u can add Bourbon or other liquor as well Rum or somthing ike that. Happy Baking!!!!!!!!!!!

Wonderful results! I baked 4 pies and all of them turned out perfect. Delicious and not one crack. I used 15oz of fresh sugar pumpkin and since I did not have all the spices I used 1T of Pumpkin Spices.

I made this for Thanksgiving, It turned out great! Rich, Smooth and creamy texture. I used fresh butternut squash instead of canned pumpkin, cause that is what I had on hand and I like the fresh stuff better. I do think most any winter squash would work, a great way to use up the garden produce. Everyone loved it, They couldn't believe it wasn't pumpkin! I will be keeping this recipe along with Chef John's pie crust recipe.

No crack, but highly addictive, nonetheless!! This recipe came up trumps. The extra egg yolks made the pie super velvety/firm and the Chinese five spice gave the pie a little more umph, which I appreciated. I also added a splash of maple syrup which did not hurt the flavour of the pie, not-one-bit! I made this for Thanksgiving. Not being a native to the US I wasn't sure how the pie would go down, but my guests finished their plates, most claiming that "I don't normally like pumpkin pie but this is really delicious!" And I think that my midwestern man's pouty lip was a good indication of it's success when I sent our guests home with a couple of slices. My oven runs a wee bit hot and "darkened" the edge of the pie crust more than I would like but that's my deal... otherwise, Chef John, this is a pie that I will be making for LIFE!!

This is hands down the best pumpkin pie I've ever made.  And SO easy!!!!  The only thing I did differently was sub 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg, cinnamon and Chinese 5 spice.   Everything else...spot on!!  Perfect!

I've never made a pumpkin pie in my life, partially because my sister lays claim to have the pie baking skills in the family and also because as an expat, I often have trouble finding key ingredients to many of the comfort-food recipes when abroad.  However, I had extra pumpkins in the garden this year and managed every ounce of this pie from scratch; it was INCREDIBLE.  My in-laws had never had pumpkin pie before and I started them at the creme de' la creme with this recipe!  Thanks, Chef John - I love your videos, too!

True story. This pie did not crack, looked amazing, and tasted delicious, will definitely become my "go to" pumpkin pie recipe. I skipped the 5-spice powder because we didn't have any.

I used a Marie Callendar’s frozen pie crust and followed the recipe but, without the 5 spice (only because my store didnt have it available). This was scrumptious with a superb texture, flavor, and great presentation. Crust was delicious and exceeded my expectations for a pre-made crust. Far better flakeiness than pillsbury roll out crust had to offer.  I was testing two recipes and this won hands down over better homes recipe. See pic for comparison.

My pie cracked anyway even though I followed the recipe. I didn't think there was enough spices. The crust was soggy and needs to be pre baked. The instructions did not have any sugar and this confused me. I did not know if the recipe called for pumpkin pie filling or pure pumpkin. So I added 1/2 cup of white sugar to my pure pumpkin which did not make the pie sweet enough.The recipe should also have specified a deep dish pie crust is needed for all the filling it makes. Very poor recipe from someone who is supposed to be an expert at cooking.

Great recipe!
I have tried traditional recipes throughout the years and had my own recipe, which I thought was quite good. But this is my new go-to recipe for pumpkin pie.  It is easy and results in a perfect pie with great flavor and texture. Thanks.

Just made the pie. Followed other recommendations, used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp cinnamon, cooked 425 degrees 15 minutes, 350 for 35 minutes and turned off oven and left in for 5 minutes. Filling was perfect. The problem I had was using keebler graham crust with 2 extra servings. I froze the crust as suggested and put the filling in just before putting in the oven. I even covered the edge crust with aluminum foil. THE CRUST BURNT.

This was my first attempt at a pumpkin pie, and I am not sure what I am expecting in a good pumpkin pie.  I tried two separate recipies for Christmas dinner, both  were very dense but tasty.

I will NEVER use another pumpkin pie recipe. It does not crack and the flavor is amazing. I followed the recipe as written and put it in a homemade graham cracker crust. I have made this pie at least 4 times this month and have added to my own book of tried and true recipes. So glad I never threw away that Chinese 5 spice. It isn't overly sweet like I imagined (condensed milk is the food of Gods) Do yourself a favor and try this pie! Mine cooks for about 35 mins and is perfect!

This was fantastic - omitted 5 spice powder as I did not have any, and added vanilla as I add it to everything. I think its important to cook the crust first as I like a crisp crust. No cracks and really good flavour.

This the best pumpkin pie I ever made. I followed everything except for egg yolk ( I only used 2 ) and the Chinese spice ( I did not have that on hand ). The pie came out perfect, no crack at all and it tastes delicious. Highly recommended !

Missing something. I'm in the process of making pies all over again with different recipe. AND it cracked. All of them. I have never given a recipe a bad review. Ever.

This is the best and easiest pumpkin pie I've made.  I have been baking pumpkin pies for over 40 years, for every Thanksgiving dinner.  My own, well loved recipe, has finally been replaced by this one.  Everyone loves it and it is simple to prepare!

My goodness, had I known making pumpkin pies were so easy, I would have done this years ago.  No more store bought pies for me on the holidays.  From now on I will be making this one.  Very creamy and my husband could not stop raving about it.  Didn't have the 5 spice but will look for it so I can add it next time. Otherwise, it was perfect.

It is absolutely fantastic! I have always used the recipe on the Libby's can (which is great!), but this recipe is definitely a step up! I didn't change a single thing and it turned out wonderfully. Even my hubby who is not a pumpkin fan enjoyed this pie. (I am a pumpkin fan and was in heaven!) Thanks Chef John!! As usual, your recipe did not disappoint!

Wow! I love this pie. In the past, I have made the other two highly rated pumpkin pies on this site, but I like this one better. Creamier, without that "wet" taste. I did not use the Chinese spice because I don't use it. My family thought it needed a little extra spice, so next time  I will add a little more of each spice. After the first 15 minutes were up, I put a crust guard on the pie crust. It was done in 30 minutes.

You will never eat another pumpkin pie again. Honestly. Plan ahead and get the Chinese 5 spice blend AND the fresh nutmeg. It makes an amazing difference!!

Would give 0 if possible. Followed directions to a tee and pie would not set. Even cooked for 15 extra minutes bc I would rather have cracked pie than pudding in a crust. So disappointed!!!

I always double the cinnamon and ginger in my pumpkin pie, so I did double those, but not the other spices. Otherwise, the recipe was perfect and made a great, creamy pie.

I made Chef John's Pumpkin Pie recipe as written except to cut the amount of cinnamon in half (1/2 tsp. instead of 1 tsp.) because of a sensitivity to cinnamon. The pie was delicious; I think, maybe the best pumpkin pie I've made in my many years of baking. The addition of Chinese five-spice seasoning was a stroke of genius! Very tasty, and in my opinion, earns a five-star rating. I must add, the pie did not crack, either. This will be my one and only pumpkin pie recipe from now on.

This recipe is great; rich, firm, with a great flavor. I substituted the Chinese 5-spice for cardamom and a dash of ground cloves and was very happy with the result. A great treat in time for Thanksgiving :  ).

11.19.18 I made my annual pumpkin pie today, a “must-have” for Thanksgiving.  It baked up beautifully, no cracks, and was just perfectly creamy and mellow The Chinese 5-spice powder was an interesting addition to a pumpkin pie, but the thing that I liked most was that all ingredients were harmonious, not a single ingredient dominated.  Don’t think that there’s any need to ever cook another recipe for pumpkin pie, because this one’s the real deal!

My dinner group had some food allergies and I made this pie with a gluten free crust and using sweetened condensed coconut milk. It was a surprisingly light and delicious smooth pumpkin custard with zero cracks!  I did take the advice mentioned above and used tinfoil to protect my crust edges. My tinfoil looked liked a hot mess, but my crust stayed nice and golden brown. I did have to cook the pie longer, 60mins at 350 degrees but I’m not sure if it was because of the coconut milk substitution or possible oven issues.

I made this last night as a test before bringing it to Thanksgiving Dinner.  The pie is very good---creamy and smooth.  It was a little bland, possibly because I didn't add the 1/8 teaspoon of "5-spice Chinese".....not sure what that is.  I'll definitely make it to bring to Thanksgiving Dinner, but I'll add  an additional spice next time.

I would give this a 10.  Easy to put together and it lived up to all of it's positive reviews.  I didn't have the 5-spice so did the suggested exchange of pinches of clove & (black) pepper since I did not have white pepper.  It didn't look all that pretty when I took it out of the oven (sides puffed up higher than center) but it all settled down while it cooled and looked amazing.  The custard consistency was heavenly.  I can't wait to try it with Chinese 5-spice.

addendum: I finally got the Chinese 5-spice powder and the pie was even more awesome than before!  Great recipe!

I made two pies today and we just tried one, absolutely delicious. I didn’t have the Chinese spice but I did crush some cloves and added a pinch into the batter, this was the only change I made. Will become a regular addition toThanksgiving!

I made this in a tart pan, and while I didn't roll the pie crust out thin enough, the pumpkin was absolutely perfect. I've really never liked homemade pumpkin pie, but wow this was wonderful. I'll definitely make again.

This recipe has turned me into a pumpkin pie fan, in part  I think because  I made a mistake!  If you want to add a caramel twist, add, say, an extra third to half cup of condensed milk and bake an extra 15 mins or so.  The result of my adding too much milk and having to bake longer rendered a caramel flavour to the already smooth and creamy texture. Oh man, I could have eaten the entire thing myself!

I am not a big pumpkin pie fan. I made this for my kids but I was blown away at the rich flavours.
This is my favourite pumpkin pie recipe ever!

So easy and delicious.  I didn't have Five spice powder handy, so I threw in some ground cardamon as well.  Will definitely make it again.

I'm not a pumpkin pie kinda person, but it's my husband's absolutely favourite pie...so I made it and took it to our family's Thanksgiving Day dinner.  Well….it was an absolute HIT!  My husband raved about it...said it was so creamy and delicious.  That was really big for him because he's use to my Mother-in-law's pumpkin pie and she's is an excellent baker!  I'm so pleased!  Thank you Chef John...you are awesome!!!

best and easiest pumpkin pie ever. i'm 25, and have been making them for as long as i've been moved out and have been making my own pumpkin pies, about 7 years. Always get rave reviews from family and friends on this pie. Thanks, Chef John!

I made this for a barbecue using the crust recipe provided and multiple people said it was the best pumpkin pie they've ever eaten. I had to bake it a little longer than was called for - about an hour total - but it turned out beautifully. I will definitely be making it again for thanksgiving this year!

This is my first allrecipes fail (i've been using this site over 10 years). I trusted all of the great reviews- i've always had good results in the past. I don't like to waste my time, money and efforts on something we wouldn't like.  I don't know if it is just our taste but this was really bad. We even tried to psych ourselves out and call it "squash pie" so we could choke it down- it tasted like squash. It is missing sugar, we must just like the old fashioned sweet pumpkin pie. The texture was nice, it looked pretty- it just tasted horrible. I made a Libby's pie at the same time and that one disappeared. If you like "traditional"  sweet pumpkin pie either add sugar  or look elsewhere.  Sorry Chef John

Made this last year with the spices listed. Did not like the taste. However this year made this recipe using pumpkin pie spice and it was very good. Creamy and with no cracks. The 3* rating is based on the original recipe using Chef John's spices which I did not like.

I made this pie for a potluck at work not long ago and it was a huge hit among all my coworkers. It was gone by the end of the day, I was so happy with how it came out. I didn’t change a single thing to this recipe. I am so happy with it! It is not your classic pumpkin pie recipe but I think it is even better than what I’m used to. I baked it for 30mins at 350 and absolutely zero cracks!!!! I will make this pumpkin pie forever. I have just made another for thanksgiving tomorrow and can’t  wait to show my family. Thank you Chef John!

I prepped the pumpkin in an Instant Pot.  Cut,  cleaned and cooked 6 minutes, high pressure, 1 cup of water. Quick release.  Removed from put,  cool,  removed peal and pureed. 

Wife said well never buy canned again. I'm not normally drawn to pumpkin but this is by far better.

This was possibly the best Pumpkin Pie I have ever made! It was super light and airy. I added extra cinnamon because I love sweet and when I serve this for thanksgiving everyone will enjoy this very much. My family loved this so much that I made 3. Another exquisite recipe by Chef John!

I made the recipe leaving out Chinese five spice (didn't have any) and subbed in Trader Joe's pumpkin spice for all.  I also use a wheat crust in place of all purpose. I additionally bake in aluminum pie tin placed inside a pyrex baking pie plate. This makes it super easy to bake and take without worrying about return of my pie plate. That added time, but allows a pie in aluminum to bake up perfectly! The pie looks beautiful, without a crack in it!  I snuck a small taste of the batter and that was pretty good, so I think this pie will be excellent!  I loved the fact that the only sugar was in the sweetened condensed milk. Even though some small changes, I rate this a 5 star because it seems forgiving when you make adjustments for things that work to make great pies.

Amazing pie! I made this and it was fool proof! The flavor is spot on, texture is smooth, and the look of it is perfect! I used a store bought pie crust and it still was great. I kept the pie crust frozen until 30 mins before use. After I was done I let it cool completely, loosely put foil on top and put it in the refrigerator. I took it out 30 mins before serving.

The absolute best pumpkin pie I ever made.  Perfect texture, lightly spiced and just the right amount of sweetness.  I usually cut the amount of sugar in recipes but not necessary for this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  No cracks either, looked as good as it tasted.

Amazing as always, Chef John. I was initially worried the edges of the crust would brown too quickly and actually burn from being in the oven for 45 minutes, but they were perfect! Followed the recipe pretty much to a T. This is my go-to pumpkin pie recipe now (although Chef John's pumpkin cheesecake is really the way to go for Thanksgiving).

Easily the best pumpkin pie I've ever had hands down. I followed the recipe exactly except I used ground nutmeg because I couldn't find fresh and I used a store bought pie shell. I was wary when I saw the film that formed on top but it made for no cracks and had no impact on the taste. This is definitely my new pumpkin pie recipe. The only change I'll make in the future is to slightly reduce the amount of condensed milk since I like it slightly less sweet (I could also serve it with homemade and not too sweet whipped cream instead of store bought whipped cream)

Wonderful pumpkin pie recipe, and so easy to make.  I've been looking for a pumpkin pie recipe that wouldn't make the top crack or dry up, this is it.  The filling was smooth and creamy and truly delicious.  Thank you Chef John, once again!
Next I'm going to try making your pie crust recipe so that by the holidays I will be a master pie maker. :)  Thanks again!

I've made this pie several times and it never fails to deliver.  Picture perfect and the taste is phenomenal!  I usually double the recipe and make one can of milk fat-free.  Guess that makes me feel better.  Well done, Chef John!

Truly the BEST pumpkin pie filling I've ever made, or had- and I've made a LOT of pumpkin pies over the years! I made my own favorite homemade crust recipe, but used this filling recipe and it turned out perfectly! No cracking, the perfect ratio of spices, and it sliced beautifully!

The custard cooks beautifully even at high altitude. The Chinese 5-spice makes it stand out and sets it above all the others of the season.

Followed the recipe exactly, and I was disappointed in this pie. Made it for my husband and daughters this Thanksgiving, as they LOVE pumpkin pie. It was all they looked forward to, and sadly it was not a hit. I lacked punch and definitely was did not have that rich, sweet flavor. I did however love how creamy it was due to the egg yokes and the sweetened cond. milk. I will probably tweak it next time by adding more spices and more sugar. It was bland and pretty tasteless. Sorry...I hate to give to bad reviews, and I have always loved Chef Johns recipes. They never fail me, except this one.

I made this pie this last weekend incase it didn't work out I still had time to make my regular pie for Thanksgiving. It turned out butter then I thought it would. I followed the recipe on the can except I did the 3 whites and one egg instead of what it has on the can. We (just my husband and I) ate the pie in 3 days. It will be a go for now on. Thanks Chef John.

The. Best. Ever. Pumpkin pie has been my favorite since I was a kid. This is the best pumpkin pie I ever had. I make it every thanksgiving now. I had previously tried to make pumpkin pies from "scratch" - meaning not the typical recipe on the canned pumpkin. It always ended up a little off somehow. It didn't taste like the pumpkin pie I was familiar with which perhaps is that standard recipe. This recipe, however, is perfect. It's unique, yes, and custardy and smooth, and considerably different and better than the average pumpkin pie, but it doesn't stray too far from the familiar too. I get compliments every single time I make this. It's severely good. Highly recommend.

I've being following John on YouTube for a long time. I enjoyed how easy he made everything  look and this was incredibly easy. I followed the recipe to a tee

, Pros:
, Super easy to make
, Cheap to make
, Perfect amount of sweet and spicy 
, Won't crack
, Fairly tasty.  

Cons:
Ingredients like Pumpkin Puree and specially Chinese 5 Spice can be extremely hard to find depending on the season. 
, Crust burned to a crisp on first step, due to the oven needed to be on high for the first minutes. 
Spices might not be for everyone, doesn't really taste like the classic Pumpkin Pie you buy at the store.

I did make a couple changes due to not having spices on hand. No ginger was used or Chinese 5 spice. Instead I ground my own cloves and added in the cinnamon and small amont of nutmeg (I'm not a fan of nutmeg) and pulsed all together after grinding whole cloves.Also covered edges of crust, as we all know pumpkin pie's crust will cook way before the pie. Followed the rest of recipe and my daughter, whose favorite is pumpkin pie, said it was the best she had ever had. Definitely making again!

Cut all the spices except cinnamon and cloves. Just my opinion. I tried it both ways and found it far too "spicy" the way the recipe is written. However, I love the condensed milk option.

Don't over fill this pie, it needs a bit of room to rise. This is an amazing pie, I used cayne pepper instead of Chinese 5star, because that's what I had.  next time I'll add a little extra of the seasonings since my family prefers a stronger pumpkin spice taste.

Ok, nothing exceptional...  while very light and creamy, my family found it almost too "delicate" and prefer the normal more dense pie as well as bolder spice.   This one lacked flavor.

This is exactly what our family has been in desire of.  After a disappointing store bought pie this past Thanksgiving I decided to search for what i wanted in a pumpkin pie and would make it.  After reading the the 5 star reviews I used Chef John's recipe and it came out perfect and will never buy one again. It is a perfectly spiced dense (not custard like or watery) pumpkin pie.
I did cover the crust edges with foil  while baking it and it did not crack on top. I used a glass pie plate and made homemade whipped cream to pair with it. 
Thank you for sharing this delightful decadent recipe!

This is my all-time favorite pumpkin pie recipe.  I didn't have any sweetened condensed milk, so I mixed a can of evaporated milk with a very scant cup of sugar and warmed it until it was blended and used that instead.

The pie is creamy, no cracks, and disappeared very quickly at my house!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and it was very bland!  The consistency was fabulous.  However, the flavor left much to be desired.  I also made Fork Knife Swoon's Gingersnap Pumpkin Pie, and it was unreal!  Delicious!  I still love you, Chef John!

I was too rushed to sift through my recipe cards for my trusted pumpkin pie recipe, a recipe I've perfected and am renowned for. Until now. This version is a slight variation to mine and amazingly for as small a variation as it was it managed to improve upon perfection! There's no need for me to go looking for that old recipe card, this is my new go-to, thanks John! And great tip about tapping the pie, it worked great at getting the bubbles up and ensuring the pie didn't crack, ingenious!

Made 4 diffterent pumpkin pies for family Thanksgiving dinner.    This is the only one that cracked!  Had a "tasting contest" and asked everyone to rate the pies.  The winner?  The Libby's Famous Pumpkin Pie recipe - the one printed on the can.  Chef John pie was really creamy and thick - the texture was a turn-off for me, but you might like it.

I just made this pie! My house smells amazing.  The pie is delicious!!!!! My husband loves it! Best custard filling ever.  I only changed the spices.  I only put cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.  I left out the others becuase I don't care for them.  The texture and moist custard was delicious!! :) I wonder what else I can make with this custard. So yummmy!

SOOOOOO GOOOOD! WOW SO EASY! I didn't have the chinnese spice but i did have a mexican vanilla mix so I added that for fun oh and some caramelized ginger too... I will never ever ever buy another pumpkin pie because it will not be this good. After my two picky boys my mother and I finished this pie we couldn't wait to make another one and we didn't!

The taste was great.  It had a grainy texture and I followed the recipe exactly.  I made it twice just to be sure I didn't do something wrong the first time.  Has anyone experienced this?

To be honest, I was very leery of the Chinese 5 spice because a little of that can go a long way to overpower a dish.  But....this was a winner in my recipe box!  It was just enough to add a nice flavor that's missing in most regular pumpkin pies.  Another plus:  not too sweet!!!  It was a hit at our Thanksgiving dessert table.  Thanks, Chef John for sharing this.  Mine turned out picture perfect!  UPDATE 1-1-19:  My little granddaughter made this for our 2018 Thanksgiving and we substituted allspice for the Chinese 5 Spice and it was just as good.  She got lots of compliments!!!

I didn't care for it....Everyone else didn't like this one as much as they loved my usual, regular pumpkin pie I make.  I WILL say, however, that this top DOES NOT crack...as stated.!!  Glad I tried it..but won't make again.

All the guys at our Thanksgiving dinner really liked this pie.  And even though the pie was very easy to make and turned out fine, none of the women particularly liked it.  All of the gals agreed: it just is not sweet enough.  I'm glad I tried it, but I'll be going back to my old recipe again next year.

My father prefers a denser, more custardy pie, so this was excellent. Very smooth, no cracks, great flavor. Wasn't able to find chinese 5 spice, so I used cloves, fennel, and a dash of cayenne pepper (the little tingle from the pepper was amazing. I experimented on the guys at work and they LOVED it). On the next go around I might add a little more nutmeg, but it's very good as is.

excellent !  it was the first pie I ever made & it came out perfectly !   I almost took it out too early though. time was up but the center was a little sunken. waited 5 minutes & it rose fully without cracking. 
love that it wasn't too sweet.

I normally like Chef John’s recipes but this one, not so much. The sweetened condensed milk gave it a too sweet and artificial flavor. Not what I’m going for in a homemade pumpkin pie!

The texture is perfect however I find the spices a bit 'off' for my taste. The second time I adjusted the spices leaving the  Chinese 5-spice powder out and that will now be my go-to pumpkin recipe.

So good and easy. tip: I used the pie crust which says to cook before you add the pie filing. Once you add the pie filing do forget to put foil over the exposed pie crust or it will burn. .. I came across this recipe Thanksgiving of 2017 and have been making it ever since.... I love Chef John’s recipes they never fail. Always good, crowd pleasing and easy to follow. He always explains in detail his method which is greatly appreciated! I know when I make a recipe of his, it’s going to be good every single time, ?? It’s safe to say I’m a Chef John fan! ??

My first from scratch, homemade pumpkin pie I have ever made. It turned out amazing! It's absolutely delicious.  It did not crack and has a wonderful custard texture with an amazing rich taste. Can't wait to make it again.

I made no changes and it was a popular pie. It's not too sweet and is more interesting than some, I'm guessing because of the 5-spice. Recommend you don't omit that!

This pumpkin pie recipe was so good! I started with Ina Garten’s perfect pie crust recipe and a 9” pie pan. I also made my own pumpkin purée with a fresh white pie pumpkin, so my pie color was lighter than if I would have used canned or an orange pumpkin, but the flavor didn’t change (I used 2 cups). I followed the ingredients and steps to a tee, and the texture and taste of this pie was out of this world. It was creamy and the spice level was so delicate and wonderful. I’d never used Chinese 5 Spice before, but this is a new one to add to my cooking arsenal. Topped the pie with some fresh whipped cream and grated nutmeg, and it was a huge Thanksgiving hit! I’ll be making this one for years to come.

No sweetened condensed milk or canned pumpkin, no problem! 

This recipe is awesome! I didn't have sweetened condensed milk or canned pumpkin (moved to Switzerland, we don't have such stuff), so I used 14 oz. evaporated milk, added a 1/2 cup of white sugar and a tsp. of vanilla and roasted a small sweet pumpkin. The recipe I found for making your own sweetened condensed milk also called for melted butter - NOT NECESSARY! 

The texture is dense and smooth, no cracks. Not too sweet. Made with the 1950 Betty Crocker pie crust and it was perfect. I'll make this again!

I don't even like pumpkin pie, but this is the best one I've had! Pumpkin is my husband's favorite, so I had to make one for Thanksgiving. Followed the recipe exactly, even though I wasn't sure that it was enough cinnamon and I was afraid the Chinese 5-spice would be strange, but it was fantastic! Also, no cracks! I highly recommend and will make it again :-) Chef John with another winner!

Simple and very very good.  It is sweet so next time I will use a more traditional crust rather than a diy graham cracker crust to offset the sweetness.  This was my choice.  The pie filling as noted in this recipe is delicious!  Recommend

Husband can control himself. Can't stop nibbling on the pie. Great texture and flavor (using home grown pumpkin puree) is so fresh.

Beautiful consistency, this wonderful pie will become my go-to recipe from now on. I will add just a tad more ginger and black pepper, only because I like it a little zingier, but overall, this was excellent. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is hands down the best pumpkin pie I have ever made! I used fresh roasted pumpkin instead of canned; that was the only alteration I made to the recipe. It is AMAZING....creamy, smooth, perfectly spiced and not too sweet. This is my go-to pumpkin pie recipe from now on!

Oh, wow! That pie was the best pumpkin pie I've ever tasted! Made the receipt exactly as listed and it was a thing of beauty. This pie will be a staple for my household going forward. It was quite simple, and as promised, came out of the oven with not a crack in it. Divine taste of the spices and a smooth creamy filling.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was easily the best pumpkin pie I've ever had. The only change I made was to sub the Chinese five spice with ground allspice and ground cloves (the allspice was by accident because I grabbed it thinking it was cloves, but it actually worked really well). I didn't measure any of my spices, but it was probably ~1/4 teaspoon. Baked as directed, no foil on the crust, and it came out without a single crack and the crust was neither soggy nor burnt. This will be the only recipe I use from now on;

First time making pumpkin pie and it turned out great except for the edges of the crust that were a little darker than I prefer because I forgot to check the pie at the 30 min mark and let it cook for 35 mins. Apart from that, the rest of the pie was perfect. Moist, perfectly spiced filling with just the right level of sweetness, with a buttery, flakey homemade crust that was also a Chef John recipe. Will most definitely make this again!

The filling was delicious! The extra yolks really do make a difference. 

I tried using a graham cracker crust with mixed results. Half of the crust was burnt, while the other half was nice and toasty. I needed to cook the pie for 35 min on 350, so I think it might have been OK if I had rotated it partway through. The filling was still delicious, so it wasn't a total loss on the burnt half, but I wished I had just followed the directions and not felt the need to tweak as my husband so often admonishes me for doing!

I couldn’t get Chinese 5 spice locally, so I subbed allspice for that. Otherwise made it as written. This was incredibly simple to make. I only have one complaint, it was such a hit I barely got a bite!  Lesson learned, next year I’m making 2!  The texture is lovely, thick and creamy, and it isn’t too sweet or spices, but it’s also enough. I have never seen pumpkin pie go over so well at Thanksgiving!  This is now the only pie recipe I will ever use!

taste is spot on though I did also add heaping teaspoons of the spices and dashes of cloves, white pepper. We like spicy. I use deep dish pie plates and as such, one recipe doesn't fill the pie plate. So, I tripled the recipe for two pies and they just about filled the plate. They aren't out yet; I suspect it will take a bit longer. Made these last year and of course, a huge hit. By the way, I made a pie using the can's recipe: the crust was tinny, likely due to the absence of certain oils in crisco now. I changed over to a butter crust recipe. And, the can's recipe is too bland; more like nursing home pumpkin pie, if you get my drift. Just saying this for comparison. This is a beefy, full and aromatic pumpkin pie.The pie came out and was gone in a flash. 'nuf said. Yum.

I didn’t even like pumpkin pie until I found this recipe. I’ve tried other recipes for pumpkin pie (I tend to research & experiment with way too many versions)  but this is my absolute no fail favorite. I double it to make it deep dish, bake it in a shallow bath to prevent cracking, and then top it with toasted pecans. Sometimes the pecans are candied, sometimes I drizzle salted caramel over them.  All that mainly for decoration, if I want to hide a crack. Honestly this pie is so yummy it doesn’t need anything else.  It’s perfect.

This pie has a light, creamy texture, slightly different from traditional pumpkin pie.  I read the negative reviews, and while I can see where some may think this needs more sweetener, I found it perfect with a dollop of whipped cream.  This baked up with a consistent, crack-free surface making for a beautiful presentation.

I ran out of five spice, so I used some anise and a little black pepper and cloves.  Great texture.  I was out of sweetened condensed milk, so I made some with evaporated milk and 1.5 cups sugar, which I cooked for 20 minutes, stirring constantly.  This must cool thoroughly before using.  Overall, this is one of the best pumpkin pies I’ve made.

This will be my 4th year making this pie. I make 4-6 each year and they disappear like hot cakes. It has the best velvety texture. I've never had a crack in one and its definitely sweet enough. I've never had anyone complain about the spice levels either.  After decades of other recipes, including Libby's, I'll never go back.

Added a smidge extra chinese five spice and cinnamon and nutmeg. Followed oven instructions and cooked as recommended, second part for 40 min. Covered crust until last 20 minutes, tad too crispy for my taste. Used frozen crust

This baked well with tin foil around the crust to prevent it from burning, but it is unfortunately just far too bland for me--maybe not enough nutmeg? If I make this again I'll up the volume on spices a bit.

I’ve just got out of the oven but I’m very optimistic about it as it looks and smells amazing. I made the crust myself too according to chef john’s recipe it’s fair for a beginner like I’m. It’s my first pie ever to make or to eat as i live in egypt and it’s not common at all :D

This was the first time I ever made a pumpkin pie. It's worth also noting, I made my own fresh pumpkin puree from sugar pumpkin as well (since they are in season, and I've always wanted to) - it was also the first time I ever did this.

Honestly, this is not a hard recipe. Get all your ingredients laid out, mix 'em up, and cook it up! I had zero cracks, a nicely browned crust, and I loved the flavor of the chinese 5 spice powder (I had never heard of this before).

It's worth noting, while *I* liked the powder, my wife was not a huge fan. So I made a second pie. When making my puree, I wound up having to add a little water the first time for consistency etc., so the second time around I added amaretto liquor instead - and left the C5S in the cupboard. Sterling reviews all around!

Thanks Chef john, you're the best.

THIS IS AMAZING!  I don't usually care for pumpkin pie, but this was absolutely the best.  It was so creamy and lighter than usual pumpkin pie. I will be making this again for Thanksgiving.  It didn't even last 24 hours at my house - and we were fighting over it!

I had to modify slightly because of the Chinese five spice, I'm allergic to pepper, so I added pinches of what makes up the five spice to mine. Turned out beautiful, taste amazing.

This pie recipe was delicious. I made it for Thanksgiving and got a lot of compliments on it. I ended up with enough filling to make two smaller pies. Because of this I thought that the cook time would be shorter for each pie. However I needed to bake it at 350 for about 55 min (~20 min more than recommended) until my knife came out clean, so I'm not sure what the issue was there. Nonetheless this is a great recipe that I will keep for the future!

I added in about 1/2 cup of sugar, and was glad that I did. It was not too sweet at all, but had a nice hint of sweetness to it.

I did  add two  ingredients but  this  delectable  pie needs nothing to add  to  flavor  and the quick, easy preparation and baking. The first time I added pumpkin-spice flavored marshmallows, oooooh awesome. Last night I added regular flavored campfire size marshmallows and power oats! The marshmallows I only used for the top, both times. A really easy to make delicious pie. I am still a new baker. I purchased California lemon fruit filling with canned raspberry filling and haven't discovered how to combine both flavors in a pie.

While making the crust as instructed in the cited recipe, I may have added too much water. So, I had to put in more flour and just refrigerate the other crust disc (I made twice the amount the crust recipe called for, to turn the other half into slices to put on top of the pie), since I didn't have enough flour. Also, I didn't have a pie plate so I just used an 8-inch cake pan. Still wonderful, though.

This was my first time making pumpkin pie. As good as any I've ever had and it was a hit at Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of roasting our leftover Halloween pumpkin for the puree :) And when that proved a little short I filled it out with sweet potato. Will reprise next year!

Used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned, omitted the 5 spice, and upped the remaining spices to total 3Tbls. I made 12 mini pies with a little leftover. Great consistency, great flavor, no cracking.

This is my families favorite pumpkin pie now for three years.  The 7 Chinese spice us the secret ingredient but I can only use a little so my young daughter isn’t too zinged by it.  This is your next go to.

This recipe is delicious, I've made it now a dozen times and always turns out pretty and is a crowd pleaser. I don't use five spice instead add 1/4 tsp cloves and is just enough spice.

Amazing as is. Didn't even need the whip cream!
I'm wondering if I make this in my 13 inch pie pan should I double? I made it in a 9 inch last time but it could have held more filling.

I made the pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. The only change I made I used 1/2 teaspoon of allspice instead of Chinese 5-spice powder. Awesome-No cracks. We love it! It is a keeper!

I made this almost as directed with two modifications. First, I didn't have the Chinese powder so I used allspice instead. Second, I pre-baked a frozen pie crust instead of making the crust linked. This was a HUGE hit with my family and l may be partial since I made it, but it's among the best I've ever had.

This was the first pie I’ve ever made so I don’t have much to compare it to other than the fact that it was the best tasting pumpkin pie I’ve ever consumed! It was a big hit with everyone else too so unfortunately I’m assigned pumpkin pie duty from here on out.

I was not a fan of this recipe. I tried it because it was supposedly crack-proof and I was intrigued by the inclusion of Chinese five spice (a flavor profile I LOVE). However, not only did my pie get the absolute biggest crack I've ever had on a pumpkin pie, that tiny amount of five spice ended up being very off-putting. And despite having my sweet-obsessed family staying with me this pie languished in the fridge slowly getting picked off by those with colds who had lost their sense of taste. Thankfully I made a test run on this pie before  Thanksgiving so it didn't spoil the big day. Oh, and, yes, I made it exactly as the recipe states with no substitutions or alterations.

It was good. We like it a little sweeter (added lots of whipped cream) and we were split on the addition of 5-spice, so I’m not thinking it will make it into next years pie. But, as promised, it did not crack.  Dense and rich. Overall good and glad we tried it.

This recipe “ROCKS” best recipe and not much different then what’s stated on the can of pumpkin. The 3 egg yokes and one 1 egg really made the difference in the texture of the pie. Only changes I made was upped the nutmeg to 1 tsp, used evaporated milk to 1/2 C white & 1/2 C brown sugars and omitted 5 spice. Baking instructions were right on. It’s a keeper for the best Pumpkin Pie I’ve ever made. Thanks CJ!!!

This is the first pumpkin pie I have ever made. Delicious. So many compliments! The only variation, I'm sure it was my oven, was I cooked it another 5 minutes before the knife came out clean. Trying it again this week.

I made it with optional five spice blend work-around.  I even used freshly grated nutmeg and minced fresh ginger.  But with my oven set to 325 as directed, it still took an extra half hour to bake.  It's pretty good, really fills up the pan.  Hope you have steadier hands than I do!

Easy & yummy!   I followed the recipe exactly as written by Chef John.  Liked the flavor depth offered with the Chinese Five Spice.  My group loved the pie.  I will use thIs recipe again, but I am not replacing it for my Grandma’s recipe.

I love creme brûlée as a dessert and pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving...this is the best of both worlds. It’s very easy to make and is now a family favorite and staple during the holidays. It’s well balanced and lighter than pie.

Surprisingly easy to make and this pie turned out perfect.  Creamy, reasonably tasty and flawless looking, just as promised. Made exactly per instructions, but used dried nutmeg, as I forgot to pick up fresh at the store. While I liked this recipe, it just doesn't have that traditional flavor and I didn't care for the texture. I will go back to the Libby recipe next time. Thank you though!

Out of seven people who ate the pie I made, three of them said it was the best pumpkin pie they ever tasted. The other four said it was amazing. I did change it a little.. I skipped the Chinese spices and the spices to use instead of the Chinese spices, except white pepper. I did use the white pepper. Thanks for the recipe! I will be using it again.

This recipe has spoiled me against other pumpkin pie recipes now. Don't get me wrong I will eat most anything pumpkin pie related. I like the pies, the pumpkin rolls ect... 

I found this recipe about 4 years ago and have made it every year since then. I love the creamy richness that sweet and condensed milk brings to it. I've seen a few reviews that said it tasted like medicine. I think that could a result of not mixing the ingredients well. Also by using a little less of the spices will help to. You can even skip on some and get a good result. 

The Chinese 5 spice is one you must be careful with and that sparingly. They anise in it can overpower the other flavors if not mixed well or you use to much. I also recommend not trying to mix up a double batch either. I tried once and it made blending the spice ingredients difficult. This pie had become a tradition in my family now.

I made this to bring to a huge potluck. I had a sliver and thought it was, well, fine. But it was NOT popular. It’s a very slightly different color than the classic Libby’s pumpkin pie, so I could tell whether people were actually eating it or not. It was the only dessert I saw bits of left on people’s plates. So I took my 3-1/2 star rating (which I would have rounded up) and adjusted it downward.

This is a really quick and easy recipe with great texture (not too runny).  I do alter the recipe slightly - I add 3 entire eggs and double the ginger.

We loved this recipe. Thank you, Chef John, for another winner. I have made this three times now. This is our new favorite pumpkin pie! It sets beautifully with NO CRACKS. Texture is light and the spices are just right for our tastes. I did not need to cover the crust, and it took the full time to bake. I make it exactly as written, using freshly grated nutmeg. Most recently I used pumpkin I had cooked and frozen; this resulted in a lighter color pie than when I used canned pumpkin last fall.

The custard is absolutely perfect with 3 yolks & 1 whole egg. 

Pies with just 1 egg crumble in your mouth and resemble cottage cheese in texture. This one melts in your mouth and is smooth & wonderful. 

Wasn't crazy about his use of star anise/fennel in the 5-spice powder, although I do like it spicy.  I substituted ground mulling spices (cinnamon, clove, allspice) and used all the other spices.  It wouldn't hurt my feelings to double the spices. 

Added 1-2 tsp vanilla. (Yes! That was so totally missing from the original recipe.)

The sweetened condensed milk makes it very sweet. I used evaporated milk and adjusted sugar down (1/2 white, 1/2 brown).  

Tips: Fill the pie shell half full, place in oven, and then add remainder (prevent spills onto edge of top crust. They burn easily.) Put extra custard into oven-proof ramekins for baking. 

Want to make your pie even more awesome? Use a graham cracker crust for extra texture and exceptional flavor. Premade crust is OK.  And of course, top it with real whipped cream (with powdered sugar and a splash of vanilla)! Garnish with freshly ground nutmeg.

I make Pumpkin Pie for my dad every year for either his birthday or fathers day. He usually says they were good but this year he just could say enough how good the pie was. He was really blown away by this one. Awesome Pie!!! Will make it again. Cooked it longer than said.

I don’t eat pumpkin pie due to allergies. The people who do did not care for this. They asked to go back to the can recipe. It looked good.

This is by far the best Pumpkin Pie I have ever tasted, my husband raved over it too.  I ended up making it twice in two weeks, the second time I added just a pinch more of the Chinese Five Spice, it's a spice combination I truly love but just never though to put it in a pumpkin pie!  Kudos to Chef John.

I very much love the spice combination and the texture of this pie.  I used fresh pureed pumpkin.  What I would add is more sweetening.  The sweetened condensed milk was not enough to sweeten the pie.  I will keep this recipe and use it the next time I make a pumpkin pie.

This was VERY good, and quite easy! But it's not my 
favorite" recipe. There was something a little "off" about the flavor and the texture lacked a certain creaminess. I'd make it again, but perhaps add a touch more cinnamon or maybe even a little vanilla extract?  That aside, it baked perfectly and was the prettiest pie I've made to date. Thanks again, CJ!

OH MY GOD. How is it possible for humble ol' pumpkin pie to be THIS GOOD? Followed recipe exactly (my habit when first trying a recipe) and it was perfection. 
Made an oil crust that is my go-to recipe (don't have the room or time to roll a crust and the oil one I make is so good my daughter requests me to make just the crust, lol), topped our slices that were still a bit warm with homemade lightly sweetened whipped cream. Pure bliss. Chef John, I would kiss you!

VERY GOOD. Tried this different way for Christmas 2017.
All enjoyed. No cracks. I would definitely use foil from
very beginning. I used cloves and a drop of anise in 
place of five spice.

Excellent pie.  I did not add the 1/8 tsp of spice.  I did add 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice .  It was easy to make and tastes delicious.  I printed the recipe so I can easily make again.

No cracks. Fluffy. Good spicing. Easy. This is the perfect pumpkin pie. Only thing I changed is that I fluffed the egg whites up a bit before putting them in last.

I love it! Like other cooks, I didn't have chinese 5 spice , so I used a dash of cloves (no measurement, just a couple small shakes). The only thing that I want to improve is what to do with the extra egg whites. Otherwise, this pie is delicious, and if necessary put foil on your crusts to avoid burning.  This recipe + common sense = awesome dessert.

Every Thanksgiving our family came over to our house and we would cook everything including the pumpkin pie,we used the same recipe for years.I saw Chef john's recipe and thought we would try it. It was the best pumpkin pie we have ever made it was like a custard. This was the first year we did not have any pie left over going forward this is the recipe we will use thanks Chef john by the way I would not change or add a thing.

It did not have a single crack in it ! And it was delicious! I was able to find the Chinese 5 spice and it really added to the flavor. This recipe is a keeper. I will never make pumpkin pie any other way.

I began by following the recipe but after mixing everything and then tasting the batter it was way too sweet. I had to add another can of pumpkin and tweek the rest of ingrediants.  Nice texture but did not care for the flavor.  Im going back to my old  recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and was rewarded with a flavorful pumpkin pie that had a nice firm texture - it didn't fall apart when trying to serve it. I actually prepared both this pie and the recipe found on the back of most pumpkin purée cans. I conducted a taste test with my family at Thanksgiving and the vote was unanimous - Chef John's recipe was the winner! This will be my go-to pumpkin pie recipe from now on.

It has held up for 2 days and still looks great.  I also made it gluten free?

Made according to  exact instructions in recipe.  It was delicious, however, mine did have a crack on top.  But still better than other pumpkin pies I have made or tasted.  
Will definitely use this recipe as my go to pumpkin pie recipe

I tried another recipe before Thanksgiving and didn't especially care for it, so decided to fall back on Chef John, and I'm so glad I did.  It's so easy to make and the pie is smooth and tasty and doesn't crack just like he promised. This will be my pumpkin pie recipe from now on. The perfect pumpkin pie!

I had never made a pumpkin pie before and wow am I happy with how this came out. I wanted it to taste exactly how this tastes. Strong pumpkin flavor with the perfect amount of spice to enhance it, not overpower it. I don't care for heavily spiced or bland, this hits it on the nose. It's also very easy to make. I used the pillsbury brand crust. I've now made this recipe 2x and it will certainly be my holiday go-to for years to come.

The taste of this pie is extraordinary and it was very easy to make. However, the huge crack appeared in my pie  when it was specifically not suppose to do this according to it's advertising. The other pumpkin pie I made, Libby's, did not do this.

Followed the recipe using the 5 spice-substitute suggestion and Chef John’s pie crust. I’m a fairly novice pie-maker, and this turned out perfectly and garnered rave reviews from our guests. If you’re a novice like I, take the time to watch the video, which covers some helpful pie-pro hints (also mentioned by reviewers).

This turned out great! I followed the recipe as written. I liked the idea of using the sweetened condensed milk and the various not so typical spices.  The cooking time was spot on and my pie did not crack. Success.

It was really yummy. The spices were great and the pie did not crack. As I was making the batter it was very liquidy, almost like a soup, but it turned out fine. It is very creamy and I have successfully made it multiple Thanksgivings.

Not being a fan of Chinese 5 spice, I substituted 1/8 tsp of ground cloves. I find sweetened condensed milk too sweet, so used a can of evaporated milk and 2/3 cup of sugar. I used a graham cracker crust with chopped walnuts. As promised, there were no cracks and the flavor was outstanding! This will be our new traditional pumpkin pie!

This was amazing! Just a couple differences from my normal recipe but it made a huge difference. I used graham cracker crust because that's what we like and cloves in place of 5 spice, although I will try it with that when I get some. Creamy, no cracks, everyone loved it! It's a saver!

This is hands down the best pumpkin pie I've ever made and had. If your skeptical about making it like I was, don't be it's perfect I make it every year now for Thanksgiving and Christmas!!!! Don't be scared about the Chinese five spice I used it and it turned out great!! It's a bit hard to find so I recommend going to a Chinese store they will have it.  Please do your self a favor and make this, you and your family will love it.

Any changes to this recipe is that instead of 1/8 tsp of Chinese 5 spice, you can use 1/8 tsp of cloves instead.

Loved this pie! Didn't have the Chinese 5 spice so I used 1/8 tsp cloves and 1/8 pumpkin spice. Used pink Himalayan salt instead of regular. Turned out great, not to sweet :)

I make Chef John's Pumpkin Pie about 5-6 times a year since 2012 and it comes our great everytime. I follow the recipe but I use allspice instead of  5 spice powder because I do not have 5 spice powder. On one occasion, I used butternut squash pulp (raw, blended) instead of canned pumpkin because I wanted pumpkin pie right then and didn't have the correct ingredients. It came out great.
It takes exactly 30 minutes in my oven at 350 F after the initial 425F for 15 minutes.
 
I will keep using the recipe.

I made this during Thanksgiving for me and my girls. It tasted so good that I heard RuPaul in my head say "that's one good pie". You know it's good if you hear Mother Ru.

In my opinion, the Chinese 5 Spice was a bit over the top.  Otherwise, I believe the recipe would be just fine.

I usually always create my own recipes. I think of recipes as a map to give me "ideas" on how or what I want to do to place my own personal stamp and create my own. When I came across Chef John's pumpkin filling for the pie. I decided to try it out. Needless to say: I have never been able to top this pumpkin pie filling recipe. My family "fight" each other for who get's to take the most pie. I had to start baking a few pies, to send home for my parents, and my son want's his very own pie to himself "don't worry" he's an athlete, so he can eat lots of carbs :) and then myself and my sweetheart get our own pie. I have made this on numerous occasions. I use organic when possible : organic pumpkin puree,  and organic brown eggs ; and always fresh grated nutmeg. I want to add that I do not use Chef John's pie crust recipe, I have my own recipe for the pie crust that that always get's compliments. But this filling is tough to beat! This recipe is the reason why I started following Chef John.

This recipe is the BEST pumpkin pie recipe I have EVER made or tasted... possibly to ever exist. I am now the pie maker for all holidays and this pie is demanded. Absolutely beautiful texture. It is a pumpkin custard in a pie shell. 5 stars is not enough.

This was absolutely the BEST pumpkin pie I've ever made or had anywhere. I made at Thanksgiving and got rave reviews from everyone who ate it. The texture, flavor... perfection. I'm seriously considering making some this snowy weekend just because. I really like the addition of Chinese 5 Spice. Thank you Chef John!

Watch not to put more Chinese Chinese 5 spice than it calls for or you might hate it like those few who rated this low.   Like me after trying it then I added just a tiny bit more but too much would give a licorice taste and of set the other spices.   I love this recipe!

Delicious! And they looked beautiful! Everyone at our dinner party raved about this pie. I didn't have the Chinese spice, so I substituted a little ground cloves and a pinch of white pepper.

This was my first time making it it tasted so good! May I suggest that you add the equivalent of the spices into the pumpkin pie spice that's what I used it took about 2 tablespoons or 2   1/4 tablespoons. Thanks!!

I made this for the dessert table at my son's wedding. Pumpkin is my daughter in law"s favorite so I wanted it to be extra special. At her bridal shower I baked this and three other recipes. Each person voted by putting jelly beans in a the water glass next to their favorite. This recipe got twice the jelly beans compared to the second place pie. Every time I make this I get rave reviews. I ground my own five spice powder using what I had in my spice r rack substituting regular peppercorns for Sichuan peppercorns. I substituted I teaspoon of peeled grated fresh ginger for the ground ginger. I took the pie out of the oven when the outside two inch edge of the filling is set. The rest off it sets while the pie is cooking. The result is super creamy. With less cinnamon and the tiny bite of the five spice powder the taste is out of this world. I became a pumpkin pie lover when I tried this pie.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving for just me and hub!  Used my own homemade pie crust and followed the recipe to a T except for the chinese 5 spice as I didn't have any on hand.  I do LOVE clove, so I added 1/4 teas.   It was delicately spiced without being overspiced and so creamy and smooth.  I will be making this one for every Thanksgiving from now on.   Thanks Chef John for another wonderful recipe!!

My mother-in-law always uses the recipe from the side of the Libby's can of pumpkin, but I wanted to try something different, as hers has a tendency to crack and develop a liquid on top the next day. This recipe was way better--no cracks and a good creamy consistency. I couldn't find Chinese 5-spice, so I just added cloves and it was fine. I love Chef John's recipes and usually look for his name anytime I'm searching for a new recipe.

Omg!!! I made two pies, and should have made three. Everyone loved it.   It turned out perfect.  Using mostly egg yolks was a great idea, I didn't get one crack in the surface of the pie,  and it was so rich.

I followed this to a "T"  skeptical of the five spice...was I wrong.  I will use this again.  One change.  I always bake my pie crusts for a few minutes before I fill with a custard filling.

Finally!! I have found the pumpkin pie recipe I've been looking for. It is super easy but super delicious.  I used a Pillsbury crust and made the recipe as is. I absolutely love the spice of this pie. It is soooo good! Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe was not sweet enough for our tastes.  I would add 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the recipe and put a pecan, oat, brown sugar topping around the edges.  The consistency of the pie was fine. It would be better made with fresh pumpkin rather than canned.

This is now my go-to Thanksgiving pumpkin pie.  Absolutely delicious!   My family loved it and ate the entire pie!  Perfect consistency and well-balanced flavor.

The pie turned out beautifully.  And I will make it again probably not till next Thanksgiving but I will save the recipe.  Everyone who tried it liked it, not the same old Pumpkin Pie.      I did a couple of things different.  I used Sugar Pumpkin that I roasted so no canned and I used about half the called for Chinese Five Spice.  I like that spice a lot but I know it can be a bit overpowering.

My son said this was the best pumpkin pie he ever tasted and I agree. It's simple but so rich. All stores were out of sweetened condensed milk so I had to use evaporated. I added 1/2 C of sugar and 1/2 C of maple syrup to the milk and everyone said it was the perfect amount of sweetness. I LOVE Chinese 5 Spice, so I used 1/4 tsp instead of 1/8. And if you've never made a successful crust before, I highly recommend this one. So easy and it was incredibly flakey and tasty. And no crack down the middle!

YUM!! It was so good! I only made change, which was substituting all the spices (except the salt) for 1 7/8 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. It's really simple to make and I will definitely make it again.

It was very good. I made it with no crust so it was gluten free and served it with whipped cream. It was fast and easy and with no crust, even easier.

Perfect and delicious! I've made this twice now and it seems to be foolproof. My friends and family and I love how silky smooth and creamy it is. I added a bit of extra ginger the second time. I'm going to blind bake the crust a bit from now on and then cover the edges when I put the whole pie in the oven. This is now my go-to pumpkin pie recipe.

This recipe is incredible!  I have been looking for the "one" and finally found it!  I didn't have Chinese five spice so I read some reviews and did a google search and went with - 1/2 tspn ground clove, pinch coriander and pinch freshly ground pepper.  For those who said it tasted, "gross" or like "medicine," I think the type of 5 spice they had played a role. Don't use cracked pepper - or you'll get a random pebble in your pie  (please see below)

Apparently there are many variations of "Chinese 5 Spice" it doesn't mean "5 spices" but "5 flavors" (i.e., bitter/heat, sweet, sour, pungent, salt) with slight variations in the ingredients that create that 5 flavor combo but all those elements are present. Traditionally, the mix consists of Cinnamon, clove, Szechuan peppercorns (some have cayenne), anise and fennel.  I hate anise and I'm not a fan of fennel so I was not heartbroken.  I found out a substitute for the flavor that fennel adds is Coriander.  The dish already has cinnamon n' salt so I just added the pepper, clove and coriander!  tasting the batter raw, there was a slight heated after taste but that cooked off.  Final Product was awesome!

This was only the second time I made a real pie crust, and it turned out perfectly. the pie was delicious even though I forgot to delete the egg whites. I just added a bit more pumpkin and it turned out  beautifully.

This pie was a bit bland, though that could have been the use of no frills ingredients. The pumpkin looked colorless, and the sweetened condensed milk want very sweet. To top it off, I could not find Chinese five spice blend, not could I find star anise.   I tried a substitute that was not enough.
I'm going to find better ingredients and try this again.

The flavor of this pie is incredible.  Many pies are over-spiced and that overwhelms the flavor of the pumpkin itself.  This was delicately spiced and just heavenly.  Everyone agreed this is the go-to pumpkin pie recipe for our family!  Just heavenly!

Followed the recipe almost to a T, and it was the best! I didn't have 5-spice powder so I used 1/4 tsp of allspice instead. I was worried that the condensed milk would make the pie too sweet, but actually it tasted just right.

This pie was ridiculous good! I wanted a recipe for pumpkin pie that my 11 year old daughter, first time chef, could follow. This recipe had stellar results and had our Thansgiving guests saying it was probably the best pumpkin pie they ever had! The only thing I changed was adding 1/8 teaspoon each of cloves and allspice in place of the Chinese Five Spice (i don't care for the anise flavor). It was perfect seasoning...I don't like mega spicy pumpkin pie bc it can sometimes taste medicinal. It baked up beautifully...zero cracks! And the texture was lovely too...creamier than I can remember making myself in the past (possibly sweetened condensed milk). It wasn't overly sweet either, as some recipes made with sugar can get. I couldn't have asked for a bigger success for my daughter's first culinary experience! A+!

Excellent!!! So sweet and rich with amazing spice, and easy to make! Would give it 6 stars if I could. I actually added more pumpkin puree to each pie. 20 or 21 ounces per pie for a deeper pie. Just a smidgen more of each spice since I added more pumpkin. Still plenty rich and sweet!

Made this pumpkin pie this thanksgiving. Made with "the "best ever pie crust" From Epicurious. Anyway, I never was a pumpkin pie person. And I'm still not, I suppose. But the others said it was good pumpkin pie...Not phenomenal pumpkin pie. But it was a very easy recipe to follow, and it yielded good results. A solid 4 star recipe.

My friend described this as "chair in a pie." It is wonderfully delicate and not too much spice. Just creamy and smooth. Goes down easily. I steamed pumpkin then pureed it in a blender for the pumpkin mush.     For a nice chewy crust, I used dust from 5 large graham crackers+3/4 stick of melted butter+3/4 cup of white sugar. Mix together and press to the bottom of the dish. It didn't burn for the 50 min in the oven and it was nicely caramelized.

Absolutely delicious.  Love the spices and very creamy.  So hard to keep pumpkin pie from cracking, but with this recipe I had just one very small crack.  It cooked very quickly, about 25 minutes in the second stage!  Will definitely be using this recipe again!

I made this recipe exactly how the recipe calls for, and it turned out fabulously! I brought it to a friend's house for dessert after dinner, and there were compliments flying left and right. I love that it is so simple, easy, and quick to make! It was so smooth and not a crack in sight. Thanks Chef John!!

wow.  That is the best pumpkin pie I have ever eaten.  Easy to make too.  I like to add a bit of grains of paradise or cardamom to mine for “that mystery ingredient” Be sure to use a deep dish pie crust.

This was my first time baking pumpkin pie, and I won't make any other recipe.  It came out deliciously creamy and the spices are perfect.  I made mine with roasted/pureed pumpkin rather than canned.

Really easy to make and was a huge hit. I couldn't find regular pumpkin puree so I used the pumpkin pie puree and added some additional spices and it was great. No cracks!

I've never made pumpkin pie before and chose this recipe because it hard 5-stars. It sure does live up to those high ratings! Best pumpkin pie I've ever had. Perfectly sweetened and spiced. I did substitute the all-spice for ground cloves simply because I didn't have all-spice, and it turned out great.

Using a fresh pumpkin, I pretty much followed the recipe exactly.  I always like more spices, so I doubled them.  In my opinion, this is almost too sweet.  My husband loves it, but I think the "lightly sweet" can't be taken literally.  When I make it again I will use a can of sweetened condensed milk and one of just condensed.  I can adjust the sugar as needed, but thought this was just too sweet for me.  As others noted, I had no cracks in it, even though I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 cake pan.

Update:  I made this again this morning, but discovered I was out of  sweetened condensed milk.  I had a can that I had boiled to make caramel and decided to use it.  OMG!!!  This takes the flavor of pumpkin pie to a whole other universe.  I didn't change anything else, but the caramelized milk deepens the flavors and is less sweet, which was important to me.  I love happy accidents.

Update, the last pie was so incredible, but all I had was the condensed, sweetened milk, so I tossed in about half a cup of molasses.  There will be no leftovers tonight.

I made this exactly as the recipe states other than measuring the spices. I used pumpkin pie spice and went by smell and taste. It was a huge hit and set up so nicely! I whipped some cream with sugar and vanilla, and everyone just loved it!

This pie recipe had a GREAT texture! I followed the instructions exactly (which resulted in a perfect texture), though I changed the spice mixture just a bit. Instead of Chinese 5-spice (which - to me - tastes like licorice), I subbed 1/8 tsp cloves + 1/8 tsp allspice. I also reduced the ginger to 1/4 tsp. The cooking times were precise as written, and I used a 9-inch gluten-free (pre-made) crust - the filling fit perfectly inside it. (In other recipes, I've had the filling amounts be "off", so this one was good.) Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I'm a Gramma.  Thanksgiving Dinner 2015 was my forty-ninth.  I, perhaps foolishly, try a new Pumpkin Pie recipe every year.   Chef John's Pumpkin Pie is the only one I will make for the rest of my Thanksgivings.  Thank you Chef John.  I can always depend on you.

This is really good!  I replaced Chef John's spice amounts with 1 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and an extra sprinkle of cinnamon.  The texture of this pie is what makes it better than the regular recipe.   This will be my standard recipe now.

This pie was perfect. No changes needed. I did do the foil trick when I dropped the temperature down but that didnt effect the taste and texture of this absolutely perfect pie.

I made 2 of these pies for Thanksgiving. I made the first one for my husband and to try out the recipe. It was very good!! So I made the second one to bring along to my relatives for Thanksgiving Day. Everyone LOVED it. This will now be my go-to recipe for all of my Thanksgiving Days!! Thanks, Chef John. Oh, and I didn't change a thing!

It's perfect and doesn't crack if you don't over-bake it. The Chinese 5 spice nicely elevates this pie above traditional pumpkin pie.  I made this along with Chef John's butter crust for thanksgiving. Everybody loved it, even those who claimed they weren't big pumpkin pie fans!  I like to bump the 5 spice up to a 1/4 teaspoon, makes the flavor just a bit bolder.

By far the best pumpkin pie recipe. I did not add the last ingredient; I'd never heard of it and didn't know where to get it. Pie still tasted amazing!

I made this just the other day for Thanksgiving. It was the best pumpkin pie I've ever had! I made it with all organic ingredients and it was just so smooth and flavorful. I especially enjoyed the flavor of the ginger. Thanks a bunch Chef John :-).

Followed filling recipe exactly and it turned out marvelous! No cracks, perfect texture and absolutely delicious! My family isn't usually big on pumpkin pie, but this disappeared quickly!

This deserves a 5/5 star rating. I decided to venture from my no bake Pumpkin pie  and I am glad I did! Creamy, smooth, right amount of density, perfectly spiced. The one tip I did learn from making the the no bake pie is to prepare the filing on the stove top for a luscious pie meanwhile slightly cooking the pie shell in the oven and then pouring it in the pie shell and finishing in the oven. Don't pass this one up.

Yum,yum,yum! Loved the consistency of the filling, but I added more spices than called for as a personal preference. I used Ruth's Grandmother's pie crust from this site and both were a huge hit. Thanks Chef John

This pie was absolutely delicious.  I gave it 4 stars only because it seems like the recipe's cooking time is not accurate.  It took 25 mins longer for the entire inside to cook even while following the temp settings exactly, and I know my oven is accurate.  But otherwise great.

Fabulous!  I have always liked the idea of pumpkin pie, but to be honest it was never a favorite of mine.  I particularly don't like canned pumpkin, as sometimes it has a bitterness and metallic taste to it.  I bought a good, organic brand of canned pumpkin, and followed the recipe exactly and wow! I LOVED this pie!  Texture and flavor was perfect, and I love the subtle flavors of the 5-spice powder.  This one's a keeper! I also used Chef John's Homemade Pie Crust recipe for this.

This is my "go to" pumpkin pie recipe.  I am not a baker - love to cook - but I don't do much baking. This recipe is easy to follow and most of all great to eat.  Some of my friends ask me to make a pumpkin pie in the middle of summer because they like it so much.

Perfect every time. I never have on hand Chinese 5 spice, so I increase cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and add clove for warmth. Love, love, love this pie! My neighbor now uses this recipe too.

First, I didn't use Chef John's pie crust recipe, so I am only rating the filling. It was fantastic. It was creamy, had just the right amount of spice, and it didn't crack at all! I will definitely make this again. I did alter the recipe a little to fit what I had on hand. I used 2 cups of fresh roasted pie pumpkin that I pureed with a food processor instead of canned pumpkin. Also, I used 1/8 tsp of ground cloves instead of the Chinese spice. It was wonderful!

Excellent pumpkin pie filling, nice spice but not overwhelming. Top was beautiful and smooth. I even opted to forgo the whipped cream on my second piece so I could taste the filling more!

This is now my go-to pumpkin pie recipe. Wow! The spices were just right and the practice pie lasted less than 24 hours.

I also used the crust recipe. It was very easy and very good.

The only change that I am making is to bake up fresh sugar pie pumpkins and using them in the recipe.

I will NOT make any other pumpkin pie ever. This is the best with one modification, no chines spice just added a pinch extra cloves. The sweetened condensed milk is what makes this pie special. It's creamier and no cracks in the pie! Everyone loved this pie.

Thanks for the detailed description and simple recipe, but this pie was really tasteless.  I added 1/2 Cup Brown Sugar and TBSP vanilla  and extra TSP cinamon.  Came out alot more like a pumpkin pie.

This was a really good pumpkin pie recipe. I served it at Thanksgiving this year and received lots of compliments. It will be my "go to" pumpkin pie recipe from now on. I have to say that I did make one change - I used 2 extra large eggs instead of the one egg and three  egg yolks. I just hated to have all those egg whites left over and had no immediate use for them...maybe next time I'll make a lemon merengue pie as well to use them up. But the two whole eggs worked perfectly.

Made it exactly as described and it turned out perfect.  If you don't need the Chinese 5 Spice for anything else, I would suggest to not buy it and substitute 1/8 more cinnamon. Now, if only I could find a perfect/easy to make crust!

It was delicious!  Only thing I found was that it makes more than a 9 inch pie but I just made sure I had enough crusts on hand.

Great flavors and texture.  I will definitely make this one again and look forward to trying Chef John's crust recipe.   (I also added a 1/2 tsp of organic vanilla extract to the mix.)

As stated in the recipe in step 4, I would suggest being diligent in tapping to release the air bubbles.

I found this to be too sweet, so I added some more pumpkin to compensate (another 6 or 8 ounces).  Otherwise, it was delicious and easy to make.  Great with vanilla ice cream, toasted pecans, and a bit of brandy brown butter maple sauce. Warmed on the stove.

The initial 15 minutes at 425 will burn the crust edges.  Wish I would have put my pie crust protectors on before putting in the oven.  
The amount of filling this recipe makes for one pie is perfect.  I can't tell you how many times there has been left over filling that I don't care to do anything with.  I won't ever again follow that you know who's recipe on the can.  That one is a runny messy filling that one can hardly get to the stove without spilling it.  This recipe was nice an thick and baked up perfect.

Superb!   I made two pies and used a can of condensed milk and a can of evaporated milk to cut back on the sugar.  Worked splendidly!   Best pumpkin pie I've had in a really long time.

Perfect. We have loved this pie every time I've made it. It really is the best pumpkin pie ever. I use ¼ tsp of cloves instead of the 5-spice powder, otherwise keep it as written.
When you make as directed and use all room temp ingredients, this pie does not crack and the crust and filling do not separate. Everyone always gives this rave reviews and asks me for the recipe.

It was good, definitely better that almost every other pie Pumpkin pie. I was looking for an recipe that could replace my my old tried and true but way to many steps recipe. This recipe is second to that one only and I'll use it for our large thanksgiving gatherings, because it is still better than store bought and other traditional recipes. For sone reason, everyines prefers graham cracker crust with this pie, so I highly recommend giving that a try. For the longest time, no one really realized that was a "secret ingredient" on my old recipe. And since it was so obvious  I never thought to specify that crust when passing the recipe along. And don't be scared to use your own preferences on then spices. But I highly recommend using chef johns 5 spice recommendation at least once to see if you like it.

Great recipe and very easy to make. I used allspice instead of Chinese 5 spice. Came out great with no cracking! Using a homemade crust is a must!!! You do not need to pre cook the crust and mine took closer to an hour to fully cook.

Didn't crack. And even though I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin pie, I was told it was a pretty good pumpkin pie. Followed directions exactly and used a butter flaky pie crust recipe.

I've always used the recipe on the Libby's Pumpkin can, which is quite good. But this is, hands down, the BEST pumpkin pie ever! Chinese Five Spice -  who would have thought that to be the secret ingredient?

LOVED everything but the addition of the Chinese 5 spice.  Will exclude that next time.  With that, it seemed just a little heavy on spice and lost just a bit of the pumpkin taste.  Otherwise, divine- including the crust which my husband never eats but loved this one.... This is a keeper.

Excellent recipe! It's true there were no cracks. My favorite aspect was the spice blend. Be sure to freshly grate the nutmeg and don't omit the 5-spice. These spice blends were like a party in my mouth. I also give 5 stars to the smoothness and consistency of the filling. It was a very pretty pie for my Christmas table!

(The only thing I differed in was to use my own "tried and true" pie crust recipe)

Seriously the best pumpkin pie ever.  I've been making a family favorite for a while and it always gets rave reviews.  Made this one to change it up and I ended up making it again three times that week.  Recipe as is with the exception of using fresh ground ginger.

This is my all time favorite pumpkin pie recipe. As pumpkin is my favorite kind of pie, I've experimented with many different recipes: varying combinations of different sweeteners, different kinds of dairies, different number of eggs, different combination of spices. This recipe gives you just the right amount of sweetness, a vibrant orange color, and a perfectly rich custardy texture. Many other recipes just turn out dry and mealy.

Like many others, I substituted cloves for the Chinese 5-spice, which I did not have on hand. I also used fat free sweetened condensed milk.

To mix things up, sometimes I like to make mine using a graham cracker crust: combine 6 tbsp melted butter, 1 1/2 cups fine graham cracker crumbs, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, and 1/3 cup white sugar. Press the mixture into your pie dish and refridgerate for about an hour before filling. You will definitely need a crust shield for this.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was the best Pumpkin Pie we ever had.  I made it exactly per the recipe.  Using pumpkin puree and adding the other spices yourself really makes a difference!  I baked three different kinds of pies and this one was devoured before any of the others!  We didn't even have any leftovers from this one...it was that good!  I will never make pumpkin pie with the canned pre-seasoned pie filling again!

I used this custard as a base for my hybrid pumpkin-sweet potato-acorn squash pie. My husband, a chef, thought it would be a good combo and it was a success. This recipe was perfectly creamy and just the right touch of sweetness. My husband said it was better than the sweet potato pie custard base I used for the other pie that had 1/2 c milk, 3/4 c brown sugar and 3 eggs... it was too sweet and less creamy. Thanks for the tip with the egg yolks, my pie did not crack. I did cut back and use half the amount of spices so the natural flavor of the fresh pumpkin-sweet potato-squash could shine through (and skipped the Chinese 5 Spice b/c my store didn't have it.)  I also used Chef Johns pie crust recipe and did not pre-bake the crust. I was worried the crust would get soggy but it was excellent! Crisp on the outside and tender and moist where it came in contact with the custard. I'm going to have to to try that technique with Key Lime Pie and see if it works to make the bottom of the crust more tender. Also I covered the crust with foil after the initial 15 min at 425, otherwise I'm certain the crust would have been burnt by the time it was finished. Thanks for all the tips John. Love when my food comes out perfect the first time without having to tweak it! You save me so much work. :)

I made this for our Thanksgiving pie this year and got great reviews from the family...the biggest was "How did you keep it from cracking? I have never seen pumpkin pie not crack."   I did not use the 5 spice instead using more nutmeg and I think it was great.  thanks for these great recipes.

I followed this recipe exactly and have never liked pumpkin pie until I tried a slice of this one....one slice led to another.  The pie looked as delicious as it tasted and no cracks.  My family and friends also loved it so next time I will make 2 of these!

Perfect! As advertised! No cracks, no weeping, light and custard-like. I used fresh pumpkin and it didn't change a thing in how the recipe turned out.
Was a big hit with the family! Definitely a keeper for me!

As other's have said, this is a phenomenal pumpkin pie. It has great texture and great flavor. I am always not the biggest pumpkin pie fan, but I loved this. I didn't have the Chinese spice and ran out of cinnamon so I just replaced both with a good Pumpkin Pie spice mix, and then added added a bit more (maybe a couple teaspoons more).
No cracks, smooth-custardy consistency bursting with those warm pumpkin flavors. Delicious, Thanks Chef John!

The perfect pumpkin pie is my own personal Holy Grail. Each year I try a different recipe hoping for that perfect combination of smooth, but firm custard texture, rich pumpkin color, right amount of sweetness and perfect blend of spices. This year, thanks to Chef John, I have chosen wisely. (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade reference.) This really is a flawless pumpkin pie. Like some of the other reviewers, I substituted cloves for the Chinese 5 Spice. Thanks Chef John!

Have to brag - this pie was so delicious and presentation perfect that no one believed I made it.  Now that's a compliment . . hmm, or is it?  Whatever, everyone is asking for an encore.  Except for using ground nutmeg instead of fresh, I followed this recipe and the crust recipe in the Footnote to a T.  I'm so pleased, thank you Chef John!

Excellent.  Omitted ginger and subbed more of other spices, since my husband can't eat ginger.  Also used our own pumpkin meat from the freezer.  We didn't have any whipped cream, but the pie does just fine on its own.  Also good for breakfast the day after Thanksgiving!

He's so right!  So, last minute I decide to make a pumkin pie and chose this recipe while shopping late at the all night "not really a grocery store" warehouse store. They only offered the pie filling in a large can that made two pies so I ended up having to double the recipe. However, I forgot to buy two of the sweetened condensed milk and I ended up being short 2 egg yolks. Also, they sure didn't have the Chinese 5 Spice, so I made my own minus the szechuan peppercorn.  I chopped up some fennel seed and star anise and added it to the pre-mixed pumkin spice and decided to throw in some shakes of regular pepper for what's it's worth...and of course, the salt. I tasted the batter and added more cinnamon and nutmeg. I only had the one can of sweetened condensed milk and was worried that the consistency would not be right for them to set properly. I poured it into my pre baked pie crusts, which are always good, and proceeded to wait while they baked in the oven. The oven had already been hot so I didn't bother raising the temperature but it did take longer to bake. It turned out that both pies came out just perfect with no cracks! I later checked my pie filling can to discover that, in fact, it was pie filling and not pumpkin puree like he suggested. It's good to know that that pie filling worked as well. The Chinese 5 spice definitely gave it a wonderful flavor. I think I ate half a pie and I'll be ready for pie and coffee in the morning!

A traditional pumpkin pie but much improved. I didn't have any Chinese 5 spice but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be just the perfect flavor and consistency. I am glad I watched the video to determine how to test it to ensure optimal cooking time. I will never go back to old recipes.
Simply excellent!

Chef John does not fool around.  When he says the pie won't crack, the pie won't crack.  I made this for the first time a few days ago for an early Thanksgiving dinner and it came out perfect.  Just the right mix of spice and sweetness.  You can't go wrong with one of his recipes!

I made this pie for my husband the first year he moved to Australia. I had no idea what constituted a good pie recipe, but saw this and it was very simple to make. It cooked beautifully and the taste was amazing, and it topped his grandmothers' (apparently that is unheard of) so this was an absolute winner! It's the only recipe we ever use.

Doubled this recipe and made 2 pies. My first attempt at real pumpkin pie as I used my Halloween pumpkins! I am not a big fan of pumpkin pie to be honest but this was fabulous. Thank you for sharing. My pies came out creamy, silky, smooth, not too too sweet, just the right amount of spice and perfect! I opted not to use the Chinese spice (or whatever it's called) because I simply didn't have any, and it was still wonderful.

I followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious! So much better than any other recipe. It did not crack at all and had such a smooth texture. Fantastic!

Yum! Very tasty home made pie. I was desperate to fill a specific craving for pumpkin pie and had nearly all the ingredients (I had to substitute sweetened condensed milk with Fat-Free Sweetened condensed milk) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My slightly lighter-calorie version still came out wonderfully satisfying! Don't think I'll be changing anything except adding a few small marshmallows and pecans to the top :)

Wow! This is so good! It makes me seem like a pro-pumkin pie baker! All my friends at church loved it. They said it was best out of all the other pumpkin pies there. I am definitely sticking to this recipe! The only thing is that the crust kind of burnt and so foil would probably be a good idea next time (:

Thank you Chef John!!

I have been trying to type this review for a half hour but couldn't put the pie down!! It was sooo good and the Chinese 5 spice gave it a uniqueness of its own. I will call it 'my secret ingredient".
Will deff make agin!

Nice and spicey the way a pie should be. Sadly my pie did not set properly. More like pudding consistency. Not sure what went wrong.

I tried this recipe for the first time last week. It was so easy! The flavour and texture were excellent. I used real pumpkin instead of canned puree. It's not easy to find canned pumpkin in my part of the world! I also used ground cloves instead of the Chinese 5 spice (which I didn't have on hand at the time). I'm not American but this is one of my favourite desserts ever and this recipe gave me the best tasting pumpkin pie I've had so far. My American husband and American friends loved it too. I'm going to try making it again but with the Chinese 5 spice. I don't think I'll replace fresh pumpkins for canned though, because I think the fresh one tastes better. Thanks Chef John! Great recipe!

I made this recipe & actually followed the directions exactly, which honestly is rare for me, but it was my first time making a pumpkin pie so I didn't want to deviate & risk messing up. But the recipe does not lie, my pie came out looking perfect with not a single crack in it!

We don't have canned pumpkin in Poland so I made it from scratch (took a while, but totally worth it!).

Perfect! No cracks, done to perfection with the baking times listed. I used a store bought crust...I didn't need foil to keep the crust from burning. It came out just right. Make sure to lower the temperature to 350 after 15 minutes at 425 like the recipe states. Very creamy a perfect texture.

This pie was very easy to make. At first I thought the filling looked odd, but it was fine.  It isn't your typical store bought pie or recipe off a can of pumpkin. It has a lot of flavor and is very yummy.  It was so easy to make and so good that this will be my new pumpkin pie recipe.

Loved it and so easy.  I added a little allspice since I didn't have the 5 spice.

I made this pie recipe for Thanksgiving this year.  It looked simple enough so decided on it for my pumpkin pie.  From my first bite the texture was so silky and smooth, and the flavor was just perfect!  This will be my go to pumpkin pie for the holidays from now on.  Thanks again Chef John!

I followed this recipe to a T and it was a hit! Next time I may add a little more of the Chinese 5 spice...it really adds a depth of flavor. You will not go wrong with this recipe!

Best. Pumpkin pie. Recipe. Ever. Only thing I changed were the spices. I'm not big on super spicy pumpkin pie, so I used a tbsp of pumpkin pie spice and a tbsp of cinnamon and it turned out wonderful. I also baked for 35 minutes. Everyone who tried it loved it. This one is a definite winner. And yay!! NO CRACKS! Most sexy looking pumpkin pie I've ever made.

Thank you Chef John.  This is the Best pumpkin pie I have ever had.  I didn't use the 5 spice because I didn't have any and my family just loved the pie as it was.  You are the BEST.

This is an outstanding pie. I followed recipe except substituted 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves for the Chinese 5. My wife said this is much better than the recipe she's used for over 35 years. We liked the flavor and texture. And as advertised, no cracks. Mucho thanks to Chef John for this jewel.

Perfect. I've been making pumpkin pies for years, and I'll never make another recipe. No cracks, beautiful color, not at all runny, amazing flavor. I didn't have Chinese 5 spice; I used a dash of allspice instead.

Mine cracked.  It tastes wonderful, but was bragging to my daughter how this pie wouldn't crack after seeing all the remarks, and sure enough, it did. Still good tho!

Stuck to the exact recipe, even used Chinese 5 spice. Chef John's pie crust is good, family enjoyed the pie. I'm not a fan of pumpkin pie, it seemed really firm, but the flavor was good. I did cover the edges during the first 15 min. Mine only needed 30 min @ 350.

I just made this and it was devoured within the night. Pumpkin pie has never been my dessert of choice, but I made it for a friend because it is her favorite. The best pumpkin pie we have ever had, and bonus points with a flaky butter crust. No cracks and super easy to make.

This is the best!  I've never made pumpkin pie before.  I took two of these (one with a gluten free crust) to a dinner party.  I added homemade whipped cream (with a drop of vanilla), and the dinner guests were practically licking the plates clean!  This is the only pipkin pie recipient I will ever use.

Absolutely a fantastic recipe. I baked a pumpkin in the oven and puréed the flesh. That was a bit time consuming but so worth it. I stayed true to chef John's recipe and the flavor was phenomenal. Will make it again! Thank you :-)
