This is delicious think of tomato and mozzarella salad only warm. I varied it slightly by toasting an English muffin putting a thin slice of mozzarella then a generous slice of tomato sprinkled with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper a few fresh basil leaves and then another thin slice of mozzarella toasted it in the broiler... mmmmm one of my favorite new snacks.

Used the best late summer tomatoes & fresh Mozzarella--a waste of wonderful ingredients. Maybe if the tomatoes were sliced thinner it would have been better. Added garlic salt pepper and oregano. Still was watery & tasteless--cooled to a very hard crust. May try again in smaller version.

With a simple variation of herbs I made one casserole dish extra; no cheese one drizzle of EVO S P and some breadcrumbs. Yum! My guests and I: loved this recipe. Thank you.
