I made a few additions to this recipe. Like others have said, there didn't seem to be enough liquid, so I added white wine (1/2 c), more broth and milk mixture. I also added more spices, thyme & pepper. My pork loin was left over so it was already seasoned, which I think made the biggest difference. My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and it is great on a cold night. Great way for me to use my left over pork loin!

I made some changes to this recipe as well to add a bit of flavor and adapt it to my family's taste... sauted the fresh mushrooms with the rest of the veggies before adding the pork tenderloin.  Added about an extra 1 cup of chicken stock along with black pepper, rosemary, and thyme (about 1/2 tsp each) and did NOT use the tarragon.  Didn't have the sour cream on hand so added a can of cream of mushroom soup instead and a package of pork gravy in lieu of the flour for thickening and added depth of flavor.  Lastly, added about 1/2 cup of instant rice since we prefer that over potato which I omitted as well.  It proved to be a delicious stew and we ate it with home made biscuits.

This stew was really delicious.  I seemed to have more meat and veggies for the amount of sauce, so added about 3/4 cup white wine and adjusted the milk to 3/4 cup and flour to 3 Tbs. to make more.  Will difinitely make this one again.

This is not a stew and it was just plain boring - I hesitated about making this and I should have followed my instincts.  Pork is my favorite meat and there are soooo many other recipes to try on this site before making this.  If you like bland, bland - this is for you.

I followed the recipe closely, except I forgot to put in the sour cream.  Ooops.  Also, I added mushrooms that I sauteed seperately in a bit of olive oil.  I agree with others that it didn't seem to be enough liquid to be a stew, but I served it with a rice pilaf and it was delicious all the same.

The Pork Tenderloin Stew was very tasty.  I added sweet potatoes instead of red potatoes.    A very hearty dish for a winter dinner.

Very good stew.  I used left over pork loin roast, and left over creamed potatoes (in place of red skin potatoes, flour & milk), can of cream of mushroom soup, pepper, thyme, rosemary (1/2 tsp. each) omitted tarragon, vinegar, sugar & sour cream.  Also, used canned mushrooms in place of fresh.  My husband said it was a keeper.  Very good.  Thanks.

I hesitated 5 stars only because I didn't have all the ingredients listed, so I modified, but I'm amazed at how it turned out enough, that I will try it with the ingredients.
As always, I enjoy recipes that are flavorful and healthy. The flavors were wonderful. I added garlic herb seasoning and balsamic vinegar since I didn't have apple cider. I didn't have mushrooms or celery, so I used zuchinni. I think lots of different kinds of vegetables would work well. Those darn carrots though. Next time, I will pre-cook the carrots some. I don't like undercooked carrots. 
Very happy with this basic recipe that works well as a foundation for a really different kind of stew.

I wouldn't make this again. I felt it was too bland, too sweet and not enough flavor. What is the point of the sugar and vinegar? Now I have this huge pot for two people and will be stuck with it til its gone. Hope the flavors marry overnight maybe then it'll have a chance.

Very good recipe.  I like others increased the liquid content (more broth, some white wine, and a bit of water).  This tends to make it more of a soup than a stew, but I prefer soups over stews.  Used leftover pork loin roast like some others mentioned; this probably makes it even better, since it was seasoned.  Only thing I added was some leaf spinach to it for a bit more color and visual appeal, and added some thyme as another noted.

My husband and I loved loved this recipe. I added a little garlic salt to the meat. Will certainly make this again. I bet chicken breast would work well too.

This was a great thing to do with pork tenderloin, I love them but I get a little sick of just making them the same way, I left out the tarragon, and I did add the mushrooms at the very end after I sauted them.

This had too much tarragon for me and my family. That aside, it was a good hearty meal.

The predominate flavour was tarragon, other than that it had no flavour of its own.  I can think of better things to do with a tenderloin.

So yummy! My husband likes it with chicken, but I like the pork version. The flavor of the broth is really amazing! It's kind of a bit of work to make after a long day but it's worth it.

I didn't feel there was enough liquid once all the veggies were added to the pot, so I doubled the chicken broth.  I omitted the sour cream - I don't know if 1/2c of sour cream would have increased our rating or not.  Leftovers were better (4*).

Nice and easy, a little bland, but that's probably because I left out some key ingredients, such as the sugar, vinegar, mushrooms and sour cream, due to my 7 year old son being rather fussy.  

I mashed potatoes and served the pork, veggies, and gravy over them (I loved the creamy gravy this made)!  For veggies, I only had carrots, a tiny bit of onion, orange peppers, and towards the end I sprinkled in some frozen carrots and peas, the peas were great!  I will make this again, and add some other veggies.  

p.s.  I only had basil and not tarragon.

Thank you for a great recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe - only changes I made was to increase liquid (used chicken broth) and the therefore used a little more flour to thicken.   I also used balsamic vinegar (only thing I had).   Very good

I took everyone's advice for increasing the amount of liquid and it worked beautifully - adjusted to 1.5 cups of chicken broth and 1.5 cups of milk.  I would have loved to have had mushrooms and celery, but found asparagus to be a nice substitute (added toward the end of the cooking process to maintain vegetable integrity). Additionally, I found pre-seasoning the pork loin cubes fared well (seasoned with 1 tsp Penzey's Spices California Pepper mix, .5 tsp Bavarian spice mix, and .5 tsp Foxpoint mix.), and I used 3 large Shallots for the onion I didn't have.  Left out the vinegar, sugar, tarragon, and traded the flour and red potatoes for corn starch and 1 large Russett with the peel left on.  On a whim I added a 1/4th tsp of curry powder, which I thought gave the stew a little depth for what I had.  Mixed with the sour cream and it resulted in a wonderfully hearty concoction.  I'm keeping this one!

I think this stew is great.  It was even better reheated (like alot of stews are).  I do not believe it was boring at all like another review stated.  This is also a very healthy stew.  I am picky about my meals and I rate this an A+

Made this today for tonight.  Stew always better after it sits.  I thought I had all ingredients at hand and I had all but sour cream and didn't have any of usual substitutions so used some neufachtel in lieu of sour cream.  Also added some thyme (mushrooms need it for me).  I did simmer my meat separately for about an hour just to make it extra tender than added my veg.  Really great flavors.  Thanks for a different twist on stew.

Used 1/2 the vinegar, sugar & tarragon & added 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/4 cup white wine, a couple shakes of cayenne and Franks Hot Sauce.  Left the pork in to cook with the veggies.  Turned out great.

This was a great recipe.  I did take it up a notch by adding thyme, crushed rosemary and savory and I did not use tarragon.  I also added some cooked bacon to give it more of a heartier flavor.  I made my bacon in the microwave to eliminate as much fat as possible and I added it in at the last minute.  I did use a lot more chicken broth than what the recipe called for because it was needed due to the amount of vegetables that were used in this recipe.  I did not use mushrooms because I hate them. I essentially kept the key ingredients but made it more vibrant with the different spices and such.  Overall, I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I did change this up a bit, since I didn't want to measure anything. My only substitutions were that I didn't have celery or mushrooms, I used home-made broth instead of canned, I didn't use tarragon, I added a little bit of salt and pepper, and subbed corn starch for the milk. And good lord, is it amazing!!
