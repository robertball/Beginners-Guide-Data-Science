This was a huge hit a BBQ. I wasn't sure about bacon and bleu cheese in my slaw, but it really added great taste.  It's the one recipe I get asked to bring to everything (even Thanksgiving dinner!).  One note, don't use the "light slaw dressing" it really doesn't work with this recipe.

A really nice change from typical coleslaw recipes and so easy to make.  I also cut down the amount of dressing and just added a little at a time until I was happy with the consistency.  Everyone loved it!

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  My husband and I both like the slaw, but prefer it without the tomatoes.  I had lost my recipe and was so very happy to find it here.  It was on a Marzetti's Slaw Dressing jar a long time ago.  Good!  Good!

This recipe is awesome!! It is such a nice change from the traditional coleslaw. I used prepackaged cabbage with carrots in a bag so it was super quick and easy. I did not garnish with tomatoes. I used the light slaw dressing and it turned out wonderful!!

Instead of using slaw dressing I used mayo and a tsp of horseradish, a dash of pickle relish more of the juice than the actual relish, salt and pepper these combinations add some great flavor I also left out the tomatoes.

This was absolutely the best slaw recipe ever! Especially if you like the flavor of bleu cheese--very dominant.  This is definitely a saver and will be perfect to bring to the cookouts where you need to bring something! So quick, so easy, so delicious!

The Marzetti's is too much for my taste.  Plus, the blue cheese gets lost in all the tang.  Next time I cut the Marzetti's in half, and added sour cream and some good mayo for more creaminess.

I never knew slaw could be like this! I've made it three times this past week because I can't stop eating it.

My store didn't have that brand of dressing so I used another. Upon the advice of another reviewer, I added the dressing and bleu cheese a bit at a time, so my amounts may differ a bit, but I think it was close.

This was awsesome!  I have never made coleslaw before.  It was gone after one day!!  I could not find the Marzetti drwssing so I used Hidden Valey Ranch Slaw Dressing.

Everybody loved this .. I doubled up the recipe and had less than a cup full when I left the party!  I used the light slaw they offered, reduced fat blue cheese, and added some splenda.. Delicious!! This recipe is a keeper...

I made this just as written.  I had great expectations.  this was going to be My salad for this year.  It was tasteless.  I ate the salad I had prepared for the people who didn't like blue cheese.  This salad tasted  much better in my head

My new favorite recipe!  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  My husband doesn't like bleu cheese at all, so I was surprised when he even tried it (he is a sucker for bacon) - he had 2 large helpings.  This is my new favorite side dish and I can't wait to bring it to a cookout!  AND so easy when you use bagged cabbage!

I LOVE this recipe!  I have never used the tomatoes and it is wonderful every time.  My husband can't get enough - we make it as a side dish for BLT's and grilled goodies...but also pile it on grilled hamburgers, grilled pork tenderloin..you name it!  The only reason I DON'T make it as much as I'd like are the calories...b/c when I do make it...I'm constantly going to the refrig and getting "just a bite"!

This slaw was good...Refreshing after a day at the beach and definitely different. I accidentally added all of the Bleu Cheese at once...I think it would have been a liiiiiittle better too keep some out of the mix. Everyone really liked this slaw though and I will definitely use the recipe again.

I couldn't find a bag of shredded cabbage and was too lazy to shred it myself so I used a bag of rainbow slaw. I initially accidentally left out the blue cheese. I don't like blue cheese, so you'd think that would be a good thing. But my husband loves it, so I put it in. I have to say it is MUCH better with the blue cheese crumbles! That dressing needs the cheese to balance it out. Easy and a little different than every day fare.

This sounds delicious and I think it will be the perfect dish to take to our next potluck in 2 weeks.  I think I'll skip the Marzetti's and make my traditional slaw dressing with mayo, vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper.  It's always good and isn't overpowering.  I do think I might add some horseradish as someone suggested.  I can't wait to try this.

Thought the blue cheese, tomatoes and bacon were an EXCELLENT topper to cole slaw that I would've never considered.  Things I did differently were 1) use Marie's brand cole slaw dressing and added a little simple syrup to take a little bitterness off of the cabbage and 2) also finely chopped broccoli and added it to the slaw.  Next time I will also add carrots to the mix.  Adding the additional veggies is an easy way to get the benefits of raw veggies and does not compromise the flavor.
