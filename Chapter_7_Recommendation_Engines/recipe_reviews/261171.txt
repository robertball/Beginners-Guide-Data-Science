5 star!   I'm normally not a peanut butter cookie guy, but these were so tasty!   Buttery goodness all the way through.   Crisp, yet soft.   The only change I made was to refrigerate the dough for about 2 hours prior to baking.   It helps the sugar blend in better and helps the butter melt down slower.

I made 3 different batches
1. Chocolate chips only.
2. No chips at all.
3. Reese peanut butter chips only.
All were exceptional. I have not made them with both types of chips, but I will be trying that next.
I followed the directions as described with the exception of only adding about 1/2  of the chocolate chips and they still came out excellent.  Great flavour, chewy/crispy they check all boxes. I had them in the oven for 12 minutes and then rotated the pan and left them in for another 2 to 3 minutes. 
Thank you, this will be my go to  peanut butter chocoate chip cookie recipe and I suggest you should try it, you will be pleasantly surprised.

This is one of the most flavorful cookie recipes I've made in a while! They are bursting with flavor! I refrigerated my cookie dough for an hour because my oven was in use and then rolled the dough into perfect balls before baking. This helps them to be more plump rather than flat and uniform.  I made the recipe as written and will definitely me making it again soon.

Love how beautiful these cookies bake up. Usually I like my cookies warm out of the oven but these were better the next day.

These are delicious! I left my dough in the refrigerator overnight  only because I was too tired to make them the night before. They are crispy on the edges and soft in the center. I ate four as soon as they cooled down!

I used semi-sweet chips instead of milk chocolate (personal preference). Soft peanut butter cookies with melty chocolate chips....Yes Please!! I ate two out of the oven with a vanilla latte.

I did all milk chocolate chips and half of what the recipe calls for. Next time, I'll double the entire recipe and use the whole bag of chocolate chips.

Doubling the recipe, i made 26 large scoop (#24 Pampered Chef) size treats and 20 small scoop (#50 Pampered Chef) sized ones. I used 1 bag of semisweet chocolate chunks and 1 bag of peanutbutter chips, along with chunky peanutbutter. Because of the volume and size of chips, I think the larger scoop worked best for the job--and the larger size took closer to 20 minutes baking time. They were easy and delicious! Turned out perfectly and will certainly consider making them again :)

Delicious. I used shortening (out of butter) so I added some water to compensate for moisture content. They cooked in 13 minutes for me.

I love all the ingredients in this recipe, especially the peanut butter chips but I was disappointed in the texture. My husband enjoyed them and they were one of the first treats to go at my treat exchange at work.

A real easy recipe to make. I made half the batch without chocolate chips, for Mom who can't have chocolate. I enjoyed the chocolate, and peanut  butter  chip version the best.

What's not to love? Peanut butter and milk chocolate chips nestled in a buttery soft cookie . . . all you need is a nice cold glass of milk to go with these. Mmmmmm!

I made a full recipe but cut it in half using gluten-free flour for half of it, and I got 15 cookies of each variety using the middle cookie scoop size.  I made the dough into balls and then refrigerated it overnight before baking.  I did use semi-sweet chips rather than milk chocolate, and the cookies are plenty sweet with that.  Twelve minutes baking time was perfect.  I had never used the Reese's peanut butter before, and it's hard not to keep putting the knife back into the jar to feed to the cook! These are very tasty!  Thanks, Hershey's Kitchens!
