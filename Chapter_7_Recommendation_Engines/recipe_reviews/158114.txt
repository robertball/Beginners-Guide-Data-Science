This isn't exactly how I wrote the recipe, but I guess the powers that be have the right to change it.  I used CHOCOLATE-FLAVORED vodka, vanilla-CARAMEL non-dairy creamer and COATED the inside of the maritini glass with chocolate syrup, not just the rim.  These small changed may make the difference in whether you like it or not.

Thanks Nikki!! I've been looking for a recipe like this...I tried it and it turned out great! I also made sure I included the left-out instructions...you're right though it did make the difference. All I did to it was add some mint chocolate shavings to the top and voila! Perrrrfect! Thanks again Nikki!!

Glad I read the reviews first.  Not sure why the site would change the recipe.  I put a shot of vodka, a shot of creme de cacoa, and a shot of Bailey's Irish Cream (did not have creamer).  It turned out pretty good.

Oh ya, keep 'em comin'.  The only change I made was to use light cream instead of the non-dairy creamer because I like to use natural products.

yummo.  Loved this.  I used Godiva Chocolate Liquor which is fabulous and cut the creamer with milk b/c i thought it was too sweet.  So good though.  Thank you to Nikki!

Delicious !!  Did use the carmel vanilla creamer as recommended and just drizzled the syrup in the glass before adding the martini !

I used a full jigger of whipped cream flavored vodka instead of a tablespoon. Instead of dipping the rim of the glass in chocolate syrup, I drizzled the inside of the glass with the chocolate syrup. 
This is one of the best martinis I've ever had.

Nikki, this chocolate martini is excellent! I really liked how the chocolate flavor came through without a strong liquor taste. I tried a couple others on the site and thought that they had way too much vodka. I like that this only had 1 Tblsp. After reading the reviews I mixed up the kind of creamer to buy. I bought the vanilla caramel creamer and it worked fine. I could also only find vanilla vodka and went with that. I also really liked that this one called for just dipping the rim of the glass into chocolate. I put a circle onto a disposable plate and dipped the top into it. Other ones, called for drizzling it around the glass and I found that to be messy. Just on the rim was elegant and just the right amount. I didn't have a shaker, so I just used a tall container with a twist on cap, shook it with ice, and then strained it with the lid. Try this one and you won't need to try the others! Ty

I used Godiva Chocolate-infused vodka, plus brown Creme de Cacao, plus Vanilla-infused vodka, plus 2% organic pasture-fed milk, all in a shaker full of crushed ice. Shake vigorously and poured into chilled martini glass rimmed with chocolate syrup and topped with a dollop of whipped cream. Finally swirled in a chocolate syrup design floating on the milk froth. OMG! I prefer chocolate syrup over shavings. Great recipe. Not too sweet. The vanilla vodka and frothy 2% milk make all the difference.  Thanks to Nikki!

I first tasted this type of cocktail in New Orleans and was very impressed with it. I searched for the perfect recipe and this is it!

I used almond milk as the creamer and it was just delightful!
