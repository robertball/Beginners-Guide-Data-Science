I fried the ground beef and sausage and then drained off the fat in a metal colander...a must.  Then I mixed everything in a crockpot until the cheese melted.  For the tomatoes, I used a can of Mexican Rotel tomatoes.  Served with tortilla chips, this is a great party dip.

I add 1 onion and 1 bell pepper to this recipe and it's almost a meal in itself.  I put it on baked potatoes or serve it with chips.  Makes a great side dish for whatever you want to put it on.

I tweeked it to our tastes.  I used all ground beef and used 2 cans stewed tomatoes and 2 cans chopped chilies. I also put it in the crockpot. Now that I think about it, I changed it quite a bit.  But it is very very good, especially with "Scoops".

This has always been a favorite of our family. The only change is adding a can of cream of celery soup,this not only adds to the flavor but also makes more. Also you can add a few dashes of cayenne pepper to give it more kick!

I made this three time already (Thanksgiving, Christmas party, and again for my hubby).  It was delicious and will be a main recipe in our household.  I did use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Jimmy Dean Hearty Sausage Crumbles the first time (all sausage other times...prefer combo) and fried it up and combined everything in a crock pot lined with a slow cooker liner---it's a must!!  No need to scrub the melted on cheese.  Just throw away the bag.  Delicious!!

This dip is always a hit at get togethers. I usually make it with ground beef only. Clean up is not fun because the cheese hardens onto everything, but it's quick and easy to make! Sometimes I use Velveeta with diced chiles for some extra heat.

THis recipe is great! I usually use rotel tomatoes and green chilis, but I double it for some extra flavor! Also, if I'm feelingin lazy, I just skip frying the meat and throw in a can of hormel beanless chilie. It actually adds more flavor and the dip turns out just amazing, it is always a huge hit.

This recipe is easy to make. I typically make this in the crockpot and add a little bit of milk (1 TBSP) to keep the cheese from hardening as fast.

I make this a lot for friends and family... you can get the mild or hot diced tomatoes and peppers for people who like more spice. For people who don't like spicy stuff just get the original diced tomatoes and peppers and use a pound of beef with no sausage.

I used a pound of hot sausage and no ground beef.  Served it at an open house with over 150 guests and it was the first thing gone.  I just mixed everything in a small crockpot and turned on low, so it was perfect for that type of gathering.  So easy and so tasty!

I love this dip! My mom made this all the time when i was growing up, and now I make it as an appetizer for super bowl parties. I use 1 lb of beef and leave out the sausage. For spicier dip use a can of HOT tomatoes with green chiles, or use mexican style processed cheese.

too bland. i make something similar to this. 1lb beef, 1lb hot sausage, 2 lg jars hot salsa, 2lb spartan cheese food, 3 small containers salsa flavored sour cream ('helluva good sour cream dip' brand) and dry onion flakes. I feed this to my hubbys road construction crews, most don't even bother with the chips just drink it straight from the thermos' like soup!! Nothing but rave reviews and complaining about who got more or who stole who's :)) My neighbor knows i make it every week and even brings her own bowl over to take some home, lol!

Good recipe that can be made many different ways.  I use ground turkey, add a diced onion and then cook in the crockpot.  Make sure not to cook too long so the cheese doesn't burn.

This was pretty much just rotel dip with meat. It was good though, but not spicy. If you want it spicy you need to use the "hot" blend of rotel canned tomates with chiles. I used leftover taco meat instead of ground beef since I had it available and was looking for new ways to use it up. This was good enough to make again.

Made this for a potluck last week, and everyone LOVED it. The name is a little off though, as it is not spicy at all. If you want spicy, you gotta throw something else in there!

This is a great dip.  I fry up a diced onion with my meat, and the drain and rinse my meat.  I use Rotel instead of plain tomatoes, and I also add a drained can of mushrooms! Yum!

took this to a party and it flew out of the dish. I did modify it though, I happened to have some La Costena pickled jalapenos in my fridge so I used those instead. I chopped them in the food processor until they were in small pieces and added those instead of diced tomatoes. It was great because I am not a big tomato fan and everyone thought it added the perfect level of heat to the dish!

Love this and I make it often. I use the fire roasted diced chilies. To "thin" it I normally use a scoop of sour cream and evaporated milk however next time I'm going to try the cream of celery soup trick! This is our Football Sunday go to standard! ( hub likes it with potato chips)Also if you add a little bit of cream cheese to the sausage while your cooking it will break up nice and easy.... if you don't want chunks of sausage. ENJOY!

I used Jimmy Dean's Hot sausage, omitted the beef and Original Ro-Tel. I didn't think I'd like it (not a fan of pan sausage) but it was so good! It was definately a hit at the birthday party I took it to! No leftovers!

I made this for a Christmas get together using 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. Bob Evans hot sausage and everyone loved it! It was easy to throw together, kept it warm in a small crock and everyone wanted the recipe.

This is a great recipe for a quick and easy dip. I served it along side tacos tonight. Per other reviews, I doubled the meats. I also pulverized the veggies beforehand because my kids won't eat them in chunks. It kept the great flavor but you couldn't see them. I will make this again soon!
