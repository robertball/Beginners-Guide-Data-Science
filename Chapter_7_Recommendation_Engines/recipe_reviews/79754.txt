Simply Delish!  I did make a few modifications: I cooked the bell peppers (I used red, yellow & green) in a big pot of water for about half an hour, added red pepper flakes to the rice mixture, and only used two cans of diced tomatoes for the filling and one can outside in the pan.  I also mixed diced green chiles in with that mixture in the pan, and substituted pepper-jack and cheddar cheeses for the asiago....it was FABULOUS!!!  I've already got a request to make it again next week!!

The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the Asiago cheese.  My house smelled so wonderful until I put that on top the last 10 minutes.  My house smelled like feet!  YUCK!  Next time I will use Monterrey of Mozerella.  I also could not fit all those bell peppers in one 9x12.  Other than that I added more garlic than called for and used red, green and orange bell peppers.  Great recipe just use different cheese :-)

We LOVED this recipe.  Yum.  I did make a few changes:  Someone had previously mentioned using Zatarains dirty rice, and I happened to have a Zatarains Jambalaya rice mix at home, so I used that.  I added two cloves of minced garlic and sauteed it along with the meat and onion.  Rather than using garlic salt, I threw in garlic powder and a few dashes of salt.  (I may be weird, but I'm not fond of garlic salt.)  Also, I used the reduced fat Jimmy Dean sausage and had great results.  I will ABSOLUTELY make this again.  My partner loved it as well, although she did mention she'd like to see fewer tomatoes in it next time.

The filling is superb - I wouldn't change a thing. I really like the actual chunks of tomato in here, as opposed to the sauce in many other recipes. Because everything is cooked in advance and I like super-soft peppers, I think I'll pre-bake just the pepper shells for half an hour, and then add the meat and cheese until melted and toasty. Oh, I also used andouille instead of regular pork sausage - perfect spice for us. Thanks so much for sharing!

Really great recipe!!  I've never made stuffed peppers before and these were a hit.  My husband told me they were just like his mom used to make.  Not too spicy either so the kids enjoyed them too.  Thank you!!

Very tasty!  I made a HUGE pan of these for a potluck and came home with an empty dish.  The only change I made was that I used 2 boxes of Zatarain's dirty rice with cheese instead of plain rice.  Will definitely make again  but with less tomatoes.

Such a great treat! Used hot sausage and more seasonings (garlic, celery, worchestshire sauce, red pepper flake, cajun spices).  Also, used regular long grain rice and mixed in with meat mixture.  Let simmer for 20 min.  Filled 6 peppers and still had enough filling to use in burritos for lunch!!  Cheese on top is nice finish -(I used pepper jack)

I love asiago cheese, of course any cheese can be used, along with a combo of cheeses; even layered inside the pepper. You are only limited by your own imagination people... Mistakes & Experimentation have created the most awsome of dishes, through out history.

Soooo yummy!! I did change some things a bit.  Only used 1lb of beef and 1lb of ground pork, 2 can of diced tomatos, 1 can of diced tomatos with chillies, and added 1 can of diced green chillies.  Seasoned and Cooked Bellpeppers for 10 min before stuffing them. Also used 2 cups of reg white rice.  Add all your favorite seasonings, oinion, fresh garlic and mix everything together. The mixture can easly make a dozen whole stuffed bellpeppers. i didnt cut in half just kept bellpeppers whole. Also used mozzerella cheese. Family loved it! Def will make this again:)

So yummy!  I had some leftover taco seasoned ground turkey, so I used that in place of the hamburger and sausage.  A great way to use up leftovers and turn it into a whole new meal!

This is a VERY good recipe.  However, it could use some spice and I think next time I will season the inside of the bell peppers before I stuff them because when you took a bite it just needed something.  This make a huge amount - a family of 4 can eat on this for a week!!  Also I did not cook my peppers before hand and I am glad I did not I think they would have been to soft.  And also I think I might decrease the cook time a bit.  My husband really loved this - kids didn't really like the bell pepper but other than that they liked it.

Wonderful, I have made these 5 times already and each time they are a hit with the whole family. My teenage son loves these so much I always make extra. The only change I make is italian sausage instead of pork, and parmesan and mozerella in place of asiago.

These were very good. I would just recommend stirring the meat and rice together before putting it into the pepper, and to use yellow or red peppers.I used green peppers and they were too strong.

This ws a great recipe I mixed everything together and stuffed the whole pepper instead of cutting them in half.  I used a little extra sausage for flavor and extra tomatoes with chilies.  Overall great recipe though my husband loved it.

Excellent recipe!  I made some minor modifications...I mixed the rice with the meat mixture and poured spaghetti sauce over the peppers rather than using more diced tomatoes.  Lastly ,I skipped the cheese. We'll make this again. Thanks for sharing!

These stuffed peppers were pretty good! I think it could use a little extra spice while cooking the meat and onion, and really you could go with either Mexican spices or Italian spices. Either way would make this dish even better. Because I like my peppers being well done, while I was cooking the meat I put the halved green peppers in the oven for about 20 minutes. Then I combined all the ingredients, stuffed the peppers, and cooked them for about another 30 minutes. The texture was great and without any of the crunchiness of half-cooked peppers. Since there were only two adults and two small boys eating this, I made the full amount of the stuffing, but only six of the green peppers. I put the extra filling in the freezer so that in a few weeks I can pull that out and make some more peppers. A really easy meal for the future! Thank you for the recipe, LASELF!

I can only give this recipe 3 stars. I usually do not give anything less than 4, however for my family and I, this recipe needed a lot of adjustments. Made it to the letter the first time around. The second time I added more seasoning (caraway seed, Italian  seasoning, and some white pepper as well as extra salt to taste, as the stuffing was bland) The second time around I also only cut off the tops of the bell peppers, gutted and rinsed out. I made the peppers act as a bowl for the stuffing mix. It is a good starting point for those who have never made stuffed peppers before, but it does in my opinion need a few adjustments. I also found that an asiago, parmesan and romano shredded cheese blend works better for flavor as opposed to just asiago.

I loved this recipe! I took some other people who reviewed its advice and boiled the peppers first which for me made a huge difference since Im not huge into green peppers. I also added minced garlic in addition to the garlic salt. My husband loved it too! I will make this again!

Very good.  You can substitute lots of different meats depending on what you have on hand.  We like things spicy, so I do all three cans of tomatoes with the chilis in them, but that's just a matter of taste!  I really appreciated the tip about baking the peppers for 30 minutes before hand...I think it makes a difference!

This recipe was very good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of personal preference of how it was made. I have always had my stuffed peppers with the meat and rice mixture mixed together. I will make a suggestion that I did. I mixed the rice with the meat and then i added some of the cheese into the mixture before stuffing the peppers. I also used some yellow and orange bell peppers instead of the green. The made for a much nicer and sweeter taste. The other thing i did was minced fresh jalapeno's into the meat as it was cooking and removed the diced tomatoes with chili's. Fresh is always best! Hope this helped!

Pretty good. I used only 3 peppers, one package of sausage, one can of tomoatoes (with chiles), 2 cups rice, half of a fresh tomato, whole onion and mozz cheese. My husband really loved it and my kids weren't so crazy about it (2 and 1).

This was a good recipe.  Didn't have the instant rice so I used regular and cooked it like normal before adding to the peppers.  Also used Mozzarella instead of Asiago cheese.  I thought it was delicious but my boyfriend could have used some more spices.

Very good dish warm or cold. The sausage is a key ingredient and needs to be of good quality. The asiago cheese compliments it perfectly. I have shared this recipe with friends and family!

Very good. I cut the recipe to serve three. I used fresh Roma tomatoes instead of canned diced tomatoes, and six green chile peppers chopped in the meat mix, a pinch of chili powder, a shot of Chinese cooking wine, four large cloves of garlic, and a pinch of salt. I replaced Asiago cheese with fresh mozzarella and sharp cheddar over the top prior to placing the stuffed peppers in the oven. I covered the bottom of the cooking dish with sauce so the peppers wouldn't stick. Also, three tablespoons of tomato sauce covering the peppers and the cheese prior to placing in the oven.

This was very tasty. I gave it four stars because I felt it needed more spice. I added garlic, some Italian herbs, salt and pepper to taste to the meat mixture. My family really enjoyed this and they tasted even better the next day.

It was alright, but there was absolutely nothing special about it. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was just meh.

This was good!  Different from the usual stuffed peppers... the sausage is a nice addition.  I added Worchestershire, used garlic and onion tomatoes, pepper jack cheese and dirty rice - so since I used so many of the reviewers' recommendations, I could only give the original 4 stars.  I think I still prefer the "usual", but it was a yummy change.

Yum!! I made a few modifications:
I combined the meat mixture with the rice and used spicy pork sausage (without casings) instead of ground pork. Add a few dashes of Mexican chile powder for an extra kick!

I did not add the rice given the large quantity of meat mixture I had, but it was still delicious! I can imagine a lovely autumn version with squash, maybe!

added a lot more garlic, some red pepper and additional seasonings (needs more kick for me)
mixed the meat, tomatoes, and rice all together and stuffed the peppers. Put the remaining mixture on top and around, then topped with cheese.  Oh... and we don't do instant rice, so used some Jasmine rice I had in the fridge from another day. 
So very good - we just like things a little more heavily seasoned I think. 
It's a keeper!

It was pretty good, but could've used more seasoning in the meat. And I liked the cheese, but I would actually layer it inside the pepper. Lastly, I would use several other colored peppers as green was a bit too boring visually.

It’s a good starting point if you’ve never made stuffed peppers before but really needs a lot of tweaks the most important of which is more spices. I personally like to do so,e Mexican spices but Italian would work out well too.

My husband has never cared for the conventional stuffed pepper but he devoured these.  Next time I will make enough to freeze a meal for the two of us and save half the time on another go round.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I cooked 2 lbs of ground turkey. Then I sauteed onion and 2 pkgs of mushrooms. Mixed the turkey with onion and mushroom. Added a 28 oz can on diced tomatoes and a 10 oz can of tomatoes with chilies. Stirred in 4 cloves of crushed garlic and italian seasoning. Let it simmer for 15 min. Made 1 cup of brown rice and poured the cooked rice in with everything else. Stirred. Filled peppers with stuffing and topped with cheese. Cooked for 45 min or so. Can make 12 in 9 x 10 pan
