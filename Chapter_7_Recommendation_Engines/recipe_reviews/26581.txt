I found this very tasty, and I think the sauce would be good with pork as well.  Thanks.

Delicious! I added a little bit of 90 scoville cayenne to spice up the sauce. I used half the sauce for basting and saved the other for dipping.  I basted every 10 minutes and it was worth the effort.  The chicken was very good and moist.  The sauce is a nice mix between sweet and spicey (depending on how much spice you add -- obviously, I like quite a bit).

This recipe is excellent!  I made it tonight for dinner and I'm making dinner for a friend tomorrow and will use this recipe again!  Great combination of sweetness with a tangy bite from the vinegar.  I added a clove of chopped garlic.

Love the sauce. I actually used a dark ale beer. The flavor was wonderful. Like the other cook, the first thing that came to my mind is that this sauce would be great with pork. There were no leftovers. I would definitely pass the recipe on to friends. Too simple to be so good.

This BBQ sauce is AWESOME! I cut back a little on the brown sugar as I was afraid it would be too sweet. It was just perfect with half.

Liked the flavor of the hickory wood chips but sauce never thickened and guest commented on strong vinegar flavor.

Sauce never thickened, so I added a thickening agent (pre-blended cornstarch and some of the broth) and it worked like a charm. Thanks!

I followed the recipe --the sauce was way too thin, but simmered it for several hours and then it was great. My chicken wasn't smoky at all, despite following the directions exactly as written.  Would definitely make the sauce again, but would probably either grill the chicken or bake it in the oven.
