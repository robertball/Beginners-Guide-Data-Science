We liked this, but it was too salty.  I would use the reduced sodium soy sauce.  The spice was just right if you don't like things too spicy.  If I weren't feeding it to kids, I'd probably up the red pepper a bit.  I'd probably try it again with those changes.

Good recipe! I only used 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce (used water to make the rest of the liquid), and I wouldn't use a drop more. Used half a red pepper and half a green pepper and it added a lot, not only in flavor, but in color as well.

DELICIOUS!! I used Cabarnet Sougvinon wine instead of Sherry & instead of cashews I used peanuts.  Came out really good!  My husband loved it too!  I cut the onions in tiny pieces instead of the big chunks, just because that's the way I like eating onions.  I served it with white rice.

This recipe has the potential to be 5 stars, but I would make some changes.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used low sodium soy sauce and even then it was a bit salty.  I also used both green and red pepper.  Next time I make this, I will use low sodium soy sauce and use less than what is recommended.  The sauce turned out a bit gelatinous so the next time I will skip marinading the chicken.  I will stir fry the chicken until done, add veggies, stir fry and remove from pan.  I will then add the sauce to warm and thicken and then mix in chicken, veggies and cashews.

This turned out very good. I don't like my food too salty, so I cut the soy sauce in about half. I also used fresh garlic instead of the powder. I had some broccoli that needed to be used up, so I added that to the veggie mixture. I tasted it after the chicken was cooked, just before adding the veggies back, and it tasted like it needed a little sweetness, so I added a tablespoon of brown sugar. I served it over brown fried rice and it was delicious. I will make again with the changes I noted above. Thanks for the recipe!

Since I can't figure out a way to revise the recipe description, I will post in the review section.  For a lower sodium content, remove chicken from the marinade before cooking (and stir fry in a wok instead of a skillet) or use low sodium soy sauce.  My family happens to like the extra sauce from the thickened marinade, but you could eliminate or reduce it.  Using the lightly salted cashews (instead of the regular ones) will also help.  To make only 1 lb. of chicken, 1/3 all of the spices, cornstarch, wine, and soy sauce.

I enjoyed this recipe - but did use low sodium soy and honey instead of sugar.  I cooked the chicken first, then added the veggies in after about 6 minutes.

An easy and delicious recipe!  I used lower sodium soy sauce based on other reviews.  The chicken was so moist and flavorful.  The gravy that the marinade made is fabulous - a perfect consistency!  Both my 3 and 6 year olds ate it with rice and fresh steamed green beans!  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe.  Very easy to make and it was delicious over brown rice.   I will definitely be making this many times in the future.

I read the reviews and used a little less soy sauce until the end. I used a red and orange pepper instead of green. I served this over white rice. Thanks for the recipe :)

Tasty, but a little on the salty side, even with using only 1/4C soy sauce and diluting with extra water.  Really didn't taste any heat from the red pepper flakes, so would probably add more if we make again.  Added some broccoli and ate with brown rice.

Excellent just a bit on the salty side. I would recommend less soy sauce or a low sodium sauce.

I should have read the reviews and comments before I made the mix. It really was way too salty. Will have to cut back on soy and substitute with light soy instead. Also, I didn't have the full amount of cornstarch noted in the recipe and it was still very gravy like. If you don't like the consistency and taste of gravy, I would half the cornstarch as well. I'll re-try this recipe w/ the necessary adjustments and see if I like it any better.
