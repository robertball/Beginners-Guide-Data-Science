I did all by the recipe, to the last letter.  5 stars!  The recipe mentions 1 packet of Ranch Style dressing mix in the ingredients, but says to use only half. Pay attention to this. I doubled the recipe, and you will too. Cut all the veggies FINELY. Spread the mixture over COOLED crust, because if not it is going to be soggy. And, of course, spread the mixture an HOUR before serving and then put it in refrigirator, do not leave it "ready to serve" overnight - NO. Use cream cheese warmed to room temperature, will be easier to spread. And yes, it is a little hard to mix it, a little hard to spread it, but when you add sour cream or mayo, then what you get? A soggy crust! Read the recipe, follow it and everybody will ask you to share your cooking secrets - GUARANTEED.

I like to change it up some and use all kinds of chopped veggies and sprinkle with grated cheddar cheese.  Sometimes I make it on my round pizza trays or stone too. I don't recommend putting it all together the night before b/c it gets too soggy.  If I'm in a pinch for time I make the crust and cover with saran wrap - and make the cream cheese mixture and and the chopped veggie mix and then refridgerate separately the night before. It makes for easy assembly.   Don't expect any leftovers. It really goes fast!

This was pretty good.  I wouldn't say "amazing" but I did like it and so did my husband.  The hints that have been peppered through the other reviews are really helpful. Mainly 1.  DO NOT use the entire package of dressing.  2.  Prepare the spread the day before and add a little mayo, it spreads easier  3.  Lightly press the veggies into the cream cheese spread with a spatula to keep them from falling off.
Enjoy!!!!!!

In response to Pacific_15's prior review: I use 2 pkgs crescent rolls(fitted in a standard 18"x 13" cookiesheet)baked etc. Beat 16 ounces cream cheese,1 cup mayo,1 pkg ranch dressing mix.This ratio is "perfect" & the mayo is the key. I make mine with finely chopped carrots,broccoli, and
cauliflower only-delicious.Let these get really cold in fridge before eating.I think they taste better the next day, if there's any left.  Hope this helps!

WOW!  Yummy recipe.  I did blend the cream cheese and the ranch dressing the day before (it was hard to tell how salty it was going to be until the flavors melded).  I ended up using only 1/2 the package as suggested.  However, instead of flattening the crescent dough to form one large rectangle, I cut each triangle crescent in half and baked like that so all pieces had a "crust".  I did use chopped black olives and mushrooms.  Received rave reviews.  Thanks!

I didn't expect much from this recipe, but it was a big hit when I served it at a recent get together.  I didn't have the package of Ranch Dressing that the recipe called for, so I used bottled Ranch dressing instead (probably about 1/4 cup).  It was delicious!  I will surely be making this again.

Very good and easy. Got rave reviews even from a non-veggie eater! Can't sit out very long--crust becomes soggy and vegetables look wilted.

These things are great... I have brought them to parties and they are the first thing to go!  People request that I make them whenever I offer to bring something to a gathering.  The only modification I make is to mix fresh chopped spinach (blanched) in with the cream cheese... delicious!

Great! These were easy to make, and perfect for a summer party. The carrots and broccolli were easily chopped ina food processor, but I had to do the peppers by hand. I also sprinkled a little bit of shredded cheddar acheese on top. Everyone just loved them, the whole thing disappeared in less than an hour while several other dishes remained untouched. Next time I will make two!

Very good & pretty to serve! Easily uses reduced-fat rolls and cream cheese.  Definitely don't put it all together until the serving day and use the half packet of dressing.  I use a little plain yogurt to smooth out the spread(much better for you than mayo & sour cream & not as strong a flavor).  Change up the veggie mixes (they sell the chopped veggie bags in the supermarket now; making prep time close to nothing!) and even the dressing packets (Italian, Garlic parmesan, etc).  I also used hummus as a spread with cucumbers, peppers and tomoatoes...so delicious, too!

This is one of my favorite recipes I've been making for years, but I do it a little differently.  I use 2 crescent rolls, the whole package of Hidden Valley ranch mix, 1 cup of mayo, and 16oz cream cheese.  Make sure the crust is cool before spreading it.  It won't get soggy if you take a spoon or spatula and flatten it down halfway through the cooking process.  For veggies, I omit the carrots (too crunchy) and use tomatoes, green peppers, cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms, and black olives.  I top it with shredded cheese, usually mozzarella or cheddar.  Mine lasts great overnight in the refrigerator and is never soggy.  Just make sure to chop the tomatoes small enough so that most of the juice drains out. This ALWAYS gets rave reviews!

This is delicious and great for parties.  I have a couple of changes to make to this recipe. I think you really need two packages of crescent rolls to cover the bottom of a jellyroll pan.  Also, two packages of cream cheese and 3/4 cup of mayo make the cream cheese mixture tastier and easier to spread.  I get wonderful reactions from party goers when I make this dish.

Made this today, but realized at the last minute I had purchased Dill dip instead of Ranch. Oh well, tasted great anyway :)  Added some onion powder and granulated garlic to the cream cheese, and just a little mayo for extra creaminess. Definitely start with 1/2 packet of the seasoning, that was all I think is needed unless the recipe is doubled. One other tip: I mix the veggies in a zip top baggie before I sprinkle them on the crust to get even distribution of all the goodies.

Everyone loves this one! I make it easier for myself when I want to serve it for party. I chop all my veggies the night before and refrigerate them. Pillsbury sells Crescent Baking Sheets making it much faster to put together. The next day I spread out the Cresent Sheets on my pan. Bake, spread on the cream cheese mixture, then cut in squares before I add the vegetables. I lightly press the veggies on top and it makes it so much neater when you take them out of the pan to serve them. Yum!

SO GOOD! I used 2 8 oz packages of cresent rolls as my Mom suggested and it worked a lot easier. She also suggested adding about a 1/2 cup of mayo to the cream cheese to give it a more creamier consistancy. I used a whole 1 oz package of Ranch also. Tasted great.  I've made this probably 5 times and use broccoli, cauliflower, green onions, and shredded cheddar cheese on top. If I could give this 10 stars, I woudl!

Great recipe. It disappeared in minutes at our Christmas gathering. Adults and teens loved it. I like that this recipe does not call for Mayo like so many similar recipes. I did add 1/4 cup of sour cream to help the cream cheese spread better.  I have made this recipe twice now and I like to use about a third of the packet of dressing mix. Otherwise it is too overpowering for me. However, your personal likes will determine your preference. For younger children I would really cut back on the seasonings as they seem to prefer bland things. I also sprinkled cheddar cheese on top after I placed the veggies on. Make sure you take a spatula and press the cheese and veggies into the cream cheese.

Delicious! I couldn't find ranch cream cheese or even a package of ranch dressing mix, so had to use plain and I still loved it! Thank you for giving me a new favourite meal! As a side note, for the crust I just used a pizza crust recipe already on allrecipes to be healthier and save money.

Brought it to a birthday party tonight and EVERYONE loved it!  I got less than 48 squares out of it though.  Chill overnight and cut the next morning; SO EASY!  Press veggies gently into the cream cheese w/spatula so they don't fall off!  Would make a great Superbowl snack!!!

These were really good, though I'd recommend a few things prep-wise...1-Make sure to pat the crust down with a spatula half way through baking or your crust will not be flat and will have big bubbles in it.  2-Don't roll it out too big or your cream cheese spread will not be thick enough to give pieces enough flavor (or just make another half batch of the spread...I did a jelly roll pan and the original amount spread super thin) and 3-Dice the veggies super small (pea size) and press them down into the cream cheese a bit, so they don't all fall off when serving.  4-I agree with many reviewers not to assemble the pizza until about an hour before so it doesn't get soggy.  I just diced all the veggies ahead of time so they were ready to throw on when time to put it together.

SUPER RECIPE! I followed others' advice by mixing in about a T of Miracle Whip and using sharp finely shredded cheddar. The family doesn't really like peppers and I was out of onions so I just piled it high with the broccoli and grated carrots.

Awesome recipe.  My daughter who only likes pepperoni pizza really liked this.  She even ate it for lunch the next day!  I only used half of the ranch seasoning and that was perfect for us.  I also added califlower and chesse.  Thanks for the recipe. Update: One thing that I have found after making this several times: there's nothing wrong with microwaving the cream cheese to make it easier to work with!

I made it for a friend’s bridal shower and it was one of the first things to go!!!  I lost the recipe after having bought the ingredients and “winged” it and it came out great!!!  *Tip – I added 1-1/2 C. Sour Cream and the whole packet of the ranch dressing to the cream cheese.  I also grated the carrots and sprinkled that on first, then added the thinly sliced red and green peppers.  I didn’t add the broccoli and used it to dip the extra dressing mix in.  Yummm!

Excellent, though may be too salty for some people. I'm not a big "peppers" person so i used olives & mushrooms and then topped with thin sliced green onions and shredded Monterey Jack cheese. very good!

I don't know how anyone gets ONE 8 oz. roll of the crescents to fit in a LARGE baking sheet as recipe suggested.  Unless you want a crispified potato chip thin burned crust, then use 2 rolls.

Very tasty Meghan, thanks!  Will make this again.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 2 pkgs of crescent rolls for a thicker crust, also added grape size tomatoes cut in half, 3/4 pkg. ranch dressing, 12 oz. cream cheese, black olives and SHREDDED COLBY OR MILD CHEDDER CHEESE IS A MUST.

Borrowing an idea from the Pillsbury site, rather than rolling flat, slice the crescent roll into 16 slices (8 quarter inch slices per half) and layout in xmas tree shape starting with 1 on first row, then 2, 3, etc..ending with 1 slice on bottom for trunk! Use red/green pepper to make "garland" on tree, etc. Always a hit!

This is marginal at best. Too sodium saturated and salty, with a soggy crust and just basically yucky. A waste of effort and calories.

This is better than the usual veggies and dip, and the veggies can be varied according to what you like or have on hand. Thanks!

These are awesome.  Unique, easy, with a great presentation.  I made these wih  1/3 less fat Cream Cheese and everyone at the party raved and requested the recipe.  As another reviewer advised, press the veggies down into the creamm cheese to prevent them from rolling off.  It seemsed as though the dough wouldn't spread out enought to cover the whole cookie sheet but I just kept working with it until it did.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE. I add 1/2 tsp of dill to the cream cheese mix and sprinkle about 1/2 cup finely shredded pizza cheese overall. Fantastic! The peppers and green onions give this one a slight kick and differs it from the other similar recipe that's also found on this site! My handy chopper reduces the prep time alot! Thanks Meghan!

Is a 5+ with these modifications:
1/2 packet of ranch like others have mentioned but I added a couple tablespoons each of light sour cream and mayo.  This makes it much easier to spread and the flavor is fantastic!  If you're taking this to a gathering I would recommend doubling the recipe but as written is good for just the family.  Soooo good!

Either I failed this recipe or it failed me.  Expensive ingredients, picky to prepare, crumbs/bits of veggie everywhere to clean up.  It tasted good but the crescent dough broke easily when I tried cutting into squares.  To follow reviewers' suggestions to use 2 pkgs of crescent rolls would, in my opinion, make it too expensive.  Won't make these again; I'll enjoy someone else's.

All of my guests raved about this! This is a keeper.  One tip is to heat the cream cheese/powder mix for a bit before you spread it and that makes it much EASIER to spread! :) worked for me.  I followed the recipe all the way, but added a few sticks of chopped celery and shredded cheddar and it tasted great!

I have been wanting to make this... haven't made it in years, so... looked up the recipe on AllRecipes and away I went.  TOO SALTY!  My husband and I actually like overly salty things BUT this was out of control salty.  I threw over half of it out!  If I make it again I will use only half of the ranch powder mix.  I believe the old standby recipe used the amount of ranch it called for with 2-8oz packages of cream cheese... which would make sense why this recipe was so salty!  So sad, gonna make more cause I'm still craving it... just using less ranch powder this time.

I doubled the recipe, used an entire package of the dressing mix, along with approx 1/2 c of mayo added to the cream cheese.  After spreading the cream cheese mixture on the "crust", i sprinkled on some fresh dill, and then put on the veggies.  Topped all with some finely grated cheddar cheese.  It was awesome!!  A very easy "main" dish for summer eating!!

Always a hit at get-togethers!I use 3 packages crescent rolls to cover the entire cookie sheet. I also use 2 packages cream cheese and one entire envelope ranch dressing seasoning. Be sure to prick the crust all over with a fork before baking. Use matchstick carrots to save time. A bit of finely shredded cheddar cheese adds to the flavor and makes it pretty too.

I made this as an appetizer on Christmas Eve to go with our many soups and my family loved it!  I used two tubes of the crescent rolls and they fit perfectly in my large cookie sheet.  I would suggest making more of the cream cheese mixture if you do this though.  Mine was spread a little thin.  For my veggies I cheated and filled a to go container from my grocery store's deli area salad bar since some of the chopping was already done.  I used broccoli, cauliflower, red peppers, purple cabbage, shredded carrots, and green onions.  Then I put shredded cheddar cheese over top.  Press everything down to make sure it sticks in the cream cheese and also cool the crust completely before you put anything on it.  Thanks for a very good recipe!!

I had this recently at a church social and it was delicious, I kept going back for more.  The only variation is that the person who made it added a little finely shredded cheddar cheese on top, which I think was a great idea.  Also, the other reviewers are right by saying pay close attention to the recipe, and the way you chop the veggies is key, make sure they are not too chunky.

Great party or potluck recipe!!! (I even had a few people ask for the recipe!)With only a few modifications, this was a big hit at my work party. I burned it the first time I cooked it, I don't know if it was just my oven or what, but I had to reduce the time to about 8 1/2 or 9 minutes.  I omitted only the green peppers since not everybody likes them and used about half of the green onions (We have some picky eaters), and I added carrots and chopped cucumber. Instead of sprinkling them on top I sliced all the veggies into thin strips and stirred it into the ranch/cream cheese mix before I spread it on the crust. I had some mix left over and just used it as a dip and it was sooo good. Thanks for sharing!  This was so quick and easy...will definitely use again!

This is fantastic!!! I made it for a high school graduation party and the next day my nephew asked me how to make it because all of his friends raved about it. I used reduced-fat cresent rolls, reduced fat cream cheese. Make sure the cream cheese is room temp. and use a mixer. Wait until the crust is completely cooled and put together an hour before serving.

These were okay, not fabulous, and a lot of work because of the chopping. Also, use 1/4 c ranch dressing instead of ranch seasoning.

Another Super Bowl and regular party request.  Doubled crescent rolls for a 15x10 pan.  Added 1/2 cup lite mayo and 1/2 cup lite miracle whip to cream cheese.  Veggies of choice were finely chopped broccoli, diced and seeded cucumber, sliced black olives, remainder of petite canned diced tomatoes not used in the BLT dip, 1/4 sweet onion diced fine, and 1 cup fancy shredded lite cheddar cheese.   Always a hit!

What can I say?  Everyone loved this.  I had a girls' night at my place, and this was devoured!  However, I did go light on the dressing mix, and can see how if I had used more, it would have been way too salty.

Great ranch taste. Just for fun I cut the dough into cubes and put into greased mini muffin cups. Baked and cooled then filled with a dollop of the topping.  Also skipped the onions and red peppers and substituted chopped roma tomatoes.

Very good and easy recipe.  I used low-fat sour cream and mayo (less guilt) -- and it tasted great.  Followed reviews -- only used 1/2 the Ranch dressing package -- and then added some garlic salt and tomatoes -- yummy!

The woman who submitted this was right, once you try it, its a must have for all your events.  It is light, yet flavorful.  Make the cream cheese mixture the night before, cook the dough in the morning, slather on the cream cheese, and then cut it up just before serving.  But beware, these little goodies are tempting, and you may eat all of them before they get to your guests.  Fresh Parmesean on the top is a nice touch.

Love this app as an alternative to the boring veggie tray we usually use.  I would say that making it with the crescent dough sheet (that I can't find anywhere) would be much easier.  Even though I pressed the seams together I still wound up with triangles that I had to cut in half for better portions.  And the cream cheese is way too thick.  I added a cup of sour cream to make it more spreadable.

This was better than I was expecting.  I followed the recipe exactly except I shredded the carrots (which I think everyone should do).  I brought this to a cocktail party and everyone loved it.  I didn't need to use the whole cream cheese mixture, so with the leftovers I made really good tomato sandwiches.  This is so easy, delicious and cheap I will definitely be making this one again.

Only Bake the crust for 10 minutes. I used fat free cream cheese with chives and omitted the ranch pack. Use any veggies you have on hand! Delicious!!

This is the recipe I have been looking for for years. I did make some changes. I used 2 packages of crescent rolls and two 8 oz packages of cream cheese. I used the reduced fat variety for both to keep the recipe healthier. I used about 3/4 of the package of ranch powder, heated the cream cheese before I mixed and added about a tablespoon of sour cream to the cream cheese. I omitted the green bell peppers because I don't like them, and used a little more green onion than the recipe called for. I chopped all the veggies into very small pieces. Finally, I sprinkled a little finely shredded cheddar cheese on top. It turned out great. I think next time I may add some mushrooms or black olives. I gave 4 stars because the recipe needed a little modifying.

Giving this 5 stars for ease and good flavor!  I'm on a strict, healthy diet per doctor's orders, so I didn't use the crescent rolls (although I'm sure it would be Delicious!!) and I used Fat-Free Cream Cheese.  Instead, I spread the mixture and veggies on whole wheat tortillas.  Didn't refrigerate anything, just spread it on and ate it.  Was VERY good!!  Topped with shredded carrots, chopped green peppers, green onions and avocado slices.  Thanks for the great recipe and my new-found way of adding veggies to my diet :))

I like to make the spread the day before - that way the flavors have time to blend, and as the instructions indicate start out with half of the packet of dressing mix.  I have a similar recipe that calls for 2 pkgs crescent rolls, 1 pkg cream cheese plus 1/2 cup mayo or sour cream and still only uses about half the packet.  I did add a heaping tbsp of sour cream to the cream cheese mixture, refrigerated it overnight then let it come to room temperature before attempting to spread on the crescent dough.  I omitted the onions and added some chopped, seeded cucumbers.

Excellent! Just like my family makes! I use (light) sour cream instead of cream cheese...just use 16 oz (pint) of cream cheese mixed with an entire ranch mix packet. (Makes more than needed, just dip cucumbers or carrots in the extra dip).  I layer crescent rolls, ranch dip, colby/monterey jack shredded cheese and then my veggies: broccoli (frozen bag cooked and then cooled), shredded carrots, sliced black olives, & about 1/4 to 1/2 of a cucumber sliced in quarters.

I would definitely recommend adding the dressing to taste.  I use less than a packet with Hidden Valley, but another organic brand, I have to use the whole packet for the same taste.  I also prefer to make my own pizza crust, but that's just a matter of personal choice.

I could eat this all day long! Definitely adjust the amount of the ranch dressing mix to taste so it's not too salty tasting. I made this for a appetizer party and it was the only one completely eaten!

I always double this recipe for parties.  I do add a couple heaping tablespoons of sourcream while blending the cream cheese with the ranch powder mix.  This makes spreading the cheese mixture on the crust easier without ripping into the cresent roll crust.

I have used a version of this recipe for over 15 years.    The differences are: use 2 pkgs of crescent roll dough, 1 1/2 packages cream cheese (I use Neufchatel or even FF),  1/3 cup Miracle Whip (or mayo) added to the cream cheese, and 1 tsp of dried dill.  I use whatever veggie combo I have -- broccoli, carrot, tomato, green pepper, black olives -- whatever.  Then top it with a cup of shredded cheese - Colby Jack is my favorite to use.   It is always the first appetizer to be totally consumed at a gathering.    Oh, and I use a jelly roll size (15 x 10 ?) pan.

I love cold veggie pizza!  I tried using low-fat crescent rolls...no good!  They don't have the great flaky quality - just dense and rubbery.  I'll stick with the regular ones next time.  I used a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch and thought it came out too salty.  I mixed in 1 cup of sour cream with the Ranch powder and cream cheese.  Even after letting the mixture sit overnight, it was still too salty.  I actually got complaints from a few people that it was too salty.  Next time I'll decrease the amount of Ranch seasoning.  [UPDATE: I re-read the recipe and see that it says to add 1/2 the packet of seasoning to the mix, not the entire packet - missed that!!]  I topped my pizzas with cauliflower, broccoli, shredded carrots, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, green onions, red bell peppers, and sliced black olives.  I also sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese over the top...don't use too much cheese though.

I've used this as the recipe states and with homemade pizza dough (I popped it in the oven, but it tastes better after it is chilled) and on store bought crusts.  Note: when making it with dough, I did add some mozzerella.  Awesome any way you make it!

My mom makes this when I visit with a friend and we love it. Did not use carrots, used diced yellow onion instead of green and skipped the ranch dressing. Also, using the reduced-fat croissants are just as tasty!

you can put just about anything on a crescent roll base and it will be awesome.  Here's something I tried and it was really good - instead of using regular cream cheese and stirring in ranch, use the garden vegetable flavor cream cheese and stir in just a little mayo.  It's sooooo good.  I topped with cheese, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower.

Great recipe- I like mixing and matching veggies to whatever I am in the mood for. I kept the crescents in the roll and then cut into 12 sections and baked as buns. That gave me individual servings without cutting and taking out of the pan.

this is a great appetizer! everyone always loves this. I did make a few small adjustments. One roll of crescent dough was not enough to stretch across my cookie sheet so I used one and a half rolls. I also used 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese and the entire packet of ranch dressing mix. These were great leftover too!

My friends and I tried the 4 different versions of this found on this site...you can see them if you check out "More Recipes Like This" on the recipe page.  This was the one I chose.  I used whole wheat crescent rolls and light cream cheese to make it even healthier.  It was a huge hit and will be a regular when I have to bring appetizers for sure.  I'm looking forward to trying different vegetable combinations as well.

Great!!!   I added 1/4 cup of mayo and  Shredded Mozzarella Cheese in with the Veggies....But instead of using Crescent rolls, I put it on tortillas, and rolled.  Chilled for 1/2 hour then sliced into half inch pinwheels.  HMMMMM, GREAT!

I agree that you really need 2 cans of rolls for this to work.  I made it with one and it was way thin.  I've had it with 2 and it turns out much better so 3 stars they way its written, 5 if you use 2 cans.

I've made this many times over the last few years and it's always a hit at parties.  A couple of tips that I'd like to share are: 1)use 1/2 or less of the packet of dressing seasoning 2)add a little mayo to the topping for easier spreading 3)a really quick time saver is to use a thawed package of frozen veggie mix such as California Mix (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower) and pulse a few times in the food processor.

My coworkers absolutely love this recipe.  I have to make a double batch because when I bring this to work on food days it always gets eaten within a couple of hours.  I have made this with regular cream cheese and fat free, and didn't notice much of a difference.  I tweak the recipe just a bit, using only half a ranch package per 8 oz. cream cheese.  I also leave off the red peppers and add cauliflower and top the center of each slice with 1/2 of a grape tomato for the red color.  This is a great recipe!

Well now if it were just me tasting this I would give it  two stars as I was not crazy about it.  But I took this to a party and it was all gone so it couldn't have been that bad.  Everyone said they liked it.  I liked the flavour of the cream cheese with the dressing mix but I was not crazy about it spread on the crescent rolls.  Maybe just as a dip I would like it better.

Absolutely delicious!  I made this for my family's July 4th picnic.  It was GONE in no time!  I did use a little sour cream (1/4 cup) with the cream cheese just to make it a little more spreadable, and only half of the ranch mix packet.  I used 2 tubes of crescent rolls (I like a thicker crust) and used broccoli, carrots, red pepper and roma tomatoes for the veggies.  Very, very good!  Will definitely make again!

I make this all the time.  I use the Pampered Chef bar pan, it's perfect for this recipe.  I like a thicker crust, so I use two rolls of crescent rolls.  I don't like green peppers or carrots, so I make it with green onions, broccoli, diced tomatoes, and cucumbers...it's always a hit.

Made these for a baby shower and everyone loved them.  They are easy to make and very colorful.  I used red and yellow bell pepper and green onion.  Didn't use the broccoli.  Didn't use full package of dressing mix per previous reviewers suggestions.  Best served cold so crust doesn't get soggy.  Might even consider using pita bread in future since it keeps its consistency well.

This recipe is great! I've used it several times for office functions, ladies groups and it's always a hit!  To make the presentation better, I use finely shredded colby jack cheese and rather than green peppers, I chop red and yellow peppers. I also chop everything rather finely.  Everyone always compliments this colorful spread!

Really enjoyed this recipe but for some reason it did not make an attractive presentation.  The taste was really good but don't use store brand crescent rolls.  Had to run out to the store and buy more because I tried to cut corners the first time and had to throw out the first batch of cooked dough - ick!

This recipe is ok, but I decided to add a little pizazz to it.  Instead of using ranch dressing I used cream cheese, mayo and a little dill.  Then I complimented that with cauliflower, broccoli, fresh mushrooms, diced sweet onion and then the grape size tomatoes cut in half and placed in rows so it makes the perfect size pieces for cutting.  It was FAB!  I always have to make two wherever I go.  It doesn't ever last and is always the first appetizer to finish first.

I think the Ranch dressing really adds to the flavor of the pizza. I had to use two packages of crescent rolls to fill my pan -- one full one and one cut up to fill in the holes. I also added cheddar cheese on top.

These went so fast at my party!  Everyone loved them.  I did take it easy on the ranch mix, used whipped cream cheese and added a bit of low-fat mayo to help spread the mixture.  Other than that, I threw some red onions into the mix and used lots of veggies.  They were truly delicious.

There seemed to be too much cream cheese for the crust...a lot more in a bite compared to what I would put on a bagel!  I even put on a little less due to what i had on hand, and it was still a bit much.  But, in the not-as-thick places, this was very tasty and refreshing!  I ran my veggies through a food processor one at a time, mixed them together, sprinkled them on the crust, and then firmly pressed them into the cheese.  I would make this again, with less cheese.

These were very pretty.  I didn't think they were great, but I'm not a veggie lover.  They got a couple of compliments at my office potluck.  I took advice from here and cut each crescent triangle in half to get two smaller triangles, and baked them as little individual appetizers instead of melding it all together.  Be very careful not to overcook the pastry.  Also be careful in amount of dressing.  The recipe is misleading -- it calls for 1 pack of mix but the instructions say to only use half of it.  I recommend you pour in bit by bit and taste as you go.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because the taste was fabulous!  I had some trouble getting the cream cheese mixture on the crescent roll crust without destroying it so I ended up spreading it with my finger but other than that, no problems and my guests loved it.  I got tons of compliments!

I really love this recipe! I first had it a couple of years ago when I was in college. So when I saw it, I knew it would be pefect for our book club meeting. I too added a little mayonaise to the the cream cheese mixture and ended up using about half a 16 oz packet of dry dip mix. I also added black olive slices and half-melted a little American cheese on top. Everyone thought I had ordered them! Really Good!

These are outstanding. I've made them many, many times. I use red, green, and yellow peppers for added eye appeal. I also roast my peppers with a torch (or broiler) and remove skin prior. These are such a different and tasty appetizer. I absolutely love them as does everyone who tries them. They take a little bit of time to prepare (with the roasting & chopping), but oh so well worth the effort!!!! I can't imagine anyone being disappointed unless you don't like vegetables.

This can be a little bland, so we sprinkle the top with a tiny amount of ground red pepper for a bit of zip.

This was very easy to make and like most every review it was "home run". Use double the crescent roll to fill large cake pan. Sprinkled cheddar cheese on right before cutting into bites. Can't wait to make this during the summer.

love this!  big hit, and great way to have your veggies.

So, other reviewers posted about the potential for soggy crust.  Best way around this- overcook the crust!  Yup, it was a mistake that worked out really well for me.  The crust was nice and brown, but stayed really crunchy even with the cream cheese and veggies.

Also, I didn't have the ranch mix, so I mixed in ranch dressing and some dill.

Definitely liked this!  I will make this again.  I only used half a ranch packet...and that was too salty, so thinking about cutting it back more next time.  Cut up 1/2 cup of baby carrots.  I used 3/4 c of broccoli.  I followed the rest of the recipe directions!  I am a little bummed I over browned my crescent roll.  At least I know next time to take it out a minute or two sooner!  My Dad and I ate this as our main dinner dish.  I would recommend having it as a side because the salt load from crescent roll crust, cream cheese and ranch dressing is a LOT!  Great if you want to use as an appetizer for a party or family get together.

I made this with no changes for a potluck at work and it was enjoyed by all.  One person told me how jealous she is that I'm such an excellent cook.  Not much cooking involved in this one! Ha!  Like others have said, don't make it too far ahead of time and press down on the toppings.  Ranch & cream cheese, you can't go wrong.

I needed a last-minute appetizer for a party, and I've always liked these when other people have made them.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for two slight changes:

1.  Whipped cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese.  Same taste, but much easier to mix and spread.

2.  I went easy on the ranch dressing mix (less than 1/2 packet)...these taste great even without it, and I think it's easy to overwhelm the whole dish with too much ranch.

Very easy to make...I made the entire thing up and put it in the fridge the night before I served it, and had no problem.  Everything stayed crisp and fresh, and they were a big hit...will definitely keep this as a go-to appetizer for parties.

Great base recipe I could lighten up with reduced fat ingredients, homemade ranch dressing mix and extra added chopped/shredded veggies that I had on hand and wanted to add.

I tried this recipe, but went back to my original recipe. I really didn't like the cream cheese spread (maybe it was b/c I used fat free).

I've made this a few times now and it is always devoured at potlucks. To make it even easier - I just spread light garden vegetable cream cheese over the baked crust. My favourite veggie combo thus far is: mushrooms, green pepper, broccoli, tomatoes.

Yum!  A great way to get your veggies in!  I used light cream cheese mixed with about 3/4 of the packet of Ranch dressing.  I also added bacon to the top - YUM!

Changed up the veggies as I am not a fan of broccoli (cauliflower worked well). Made it for a small get together and everyone loved it! I had enough of the ranch/cream cheese mix left over to use as a dip for the extra veggies.

i make this all the time, but one package of dry ranch dressing is too much for this size.  I normally use two crescent rolls, two 8 ounce cream cheese and one cup of miracle whip salad dressing, along with  the full packet of ranch mix.  If you only want to use one crescent roll, then cut the ingredients in half.

Two hints for this wonderful appetizer!  1) Cut the crust before putting the cheese mixture on.  This way, it will look pretty until it is time to eat it.  2) Top with a bit of shredded cheddar cheese.

Yuuuuuum! These are my favorite! I like these with finely chopped radishes along with the other veggies,but will happily eat them any way I can get them! Put the green onion on the cream cheese layer first -- the flavor blends a little bit better that way.

I topped mine with broccoli and chopped carrots. this was delicious! Everyone loved it. Next time I think I will shred the carrots instead of chop them though as they were a bit hard to keep on the pieces. Excellent recipe!

This wasn't bad but it wasn't really good either. You have to really like fresh vegetables (which I do) and plan to eat the whole thing in one day because I didn't like the day after leftovers. The taste was kind of bland. Not alot of people choose to eat this at our family gathering.

This recipe is always loved by my guests.  I found a new product that makes it easier, even.  It's called Crescent Recipe Creations.  You don't have try to push the seams back together-- it's just one plain sheet of dough.

Great recipe for parties and potlucks.  I  make this all the time and now family almost expects it at every party!!  

I skip the ranch mix.  I just mix cream cheese, tbsp of mayo, black pepper, garlic powder and dill.

I chopped the veggies the night before and let them soak in water mixed with a generous sprinkling of garlic powder and a dash of worchestire sauce.  (do the same with shrimp for shrimp cocktail) Yum!

These turned out so pretty and so tasty. I've had them before but this is the first time I've made it myself and I was suprised at how quick and easy this was to put together. I chopped my veggies the night before to save some time and set out the cream cheese while the crust was baking and cooling so it was soft when I mixed it up.

I've been making this for years and it never fails to be a hit with everyone. I do always add finely shredded cheese, sprinkling it on top of the cream cheese. I love this recipe because you can use your favorite veggies or whatever you have on hand.

I used the 1 1/2 packs of dough, and used the 50% bigger cresents and got a nice crust. I used a container of "salad confetti" and one of diced tri-color bell peppers.  I had to do no cutting of veggies at all and it came out great!

Very yummy and very versatile. You can put pretty much anything you would like in a salad on it in my opinion. I kind of went over board with the toppings, which I don’t suggest doing unless you don’t mind the mess. Definitely do a taste test while making the ranch spiked cream cheese, a little less than half a pack was enough for me. This would be a hit for small, one bite appetizers or even a light lunch.

Awesome! These are always the first to go at any party. I have made these many times now and I found that if the cream cheese is room temperture the mixture is a bit softer so you can press the veggies into the cream cheese easier otherwise you lose alot of the veggies when slicing. This recipe is perfect as is or you can change some veggies to suit your taste. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I have been making this for 20 years.  I top the vegetables with finely grated pizza cheese to give it that pizza look.  I have also used the broccoli slaw and add other vegetables to it. I have used chopped olives, because they hold better.  It is one of our favorite appetizers.

Excellent. I used just a sprinkling of dry ranch dressing mix. I also used a sprinkle of dill, some red pepper, and green and black olives. This was gone in no time. Classic recipe!
PS-the best way to spread the cream cheese is with a plain ole' butter knife.

This appetizer was a hit at my friend's Christmas party!  There was nothing left after two hours.  The only modification that I made was that I added salad supreme seasoning by McCormick on top of the veggies after I finished making the pizza...Delicious!!!

Delicious:)
Tried it for the first time and everyone adored it. They kept coming back till it was almost all gone and we had TONS of food at our BBQ, so I was really happy. I followed the hint given from an earlier review about pressing in the veggies with a spatula. I also kept mine in the fridge till right before serving. At the end of the night about 6 hours after I brought these out, the last two left did start to become a little soggy. I think it was due to the cream cheese but I still ate it anyway and by the time we cleaned up, someone ate the other last one too! :)

Crowd pleaser at parties! I open the crescents and piece them together into a big rectangle on a piece of wax paper. I just use my fingers to push them all together. Then, used a pizza cutter to easily cut into squares. Very easy recipe and one of the most complimented items at parties!

A very simple and easy recipe yet very tasty.
I used a boxed focaccia bread mix from the $1 store
instead of the crescent roll dough. The puffiness of the focaccia made it better I think. The normal price of the
focaccia was $4 which I bought for $1. The crescent dough was
$2.79. 

I did end up using the crescent rolls for another recipe and
I must say I wasn't impressed with the results.

My mom used to make these for parties when I was younger- and I always loved the flavor. I was glad to find the recipe here. I made it for a housewarming party, but instead of refrigerator crescent rolls, I used frozen pastry sheets. This is what my mom always used, and it really adds a nice flaky texture. I love the presentation- very impressive (and very easy to make)

This recipe was very tasty and my veg. friends really liked it.  I must say however, that it didn't look so inviting.  I think I would put less broccoli next time.

Perfect recipe to get people (and kids) to eat their veggies.  I brought this to an office party and was asked for the recipe several times.  I generally use broccoli and cauliflower cuts, diced red onions, sliced olives and chunked baby carrots.  In the end I have a colorful and tasty appetizer!

This is an excellent recipe...but you can use whatever veggies you like.  I also sprinkled finely shredded cheese (bagged variety...any cheddar/cheddar mix is great)..and sliced black olives. Also, as previous reviews stated;I only used about 1/2 of the ranch dressing mix, otherwise it tastes too salty.

I made the veggie pizza the day before like people has suggested, and added ½ mayo. It was good. I think the day setting in the fridge made the crust a bit soggy, but overall a great recipe. I used carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower.

Everyone loved this and asked for the recipe.  I added 1/2 cup of mayo which helped it spread easier and more veggies, i.e. cucumbers, cauliflower, and tomatoes.

Made this as one of the appetizers at my son's birthday party.  The 13-year olds wouldn't touch it, but the grownups liked it.  It's better the next day.  I took the leftovers to the office and they were scarfed down in a matter of minutes.  Made it again for a church function and people were piling the leftovers onto plates to take home!

I made this for two Christmas parties, and my guests loved it.  My kids loved it too, although they are teenagers.  I am not certain they would have loved them as younger kids.  I made some changes however.  I used light veggie cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese.  Also to make this even easier, I went to my grocery store salad bar, picked up some broccoli, cauliflower, green bell peppers, black olives, mushrooms,onions, and carrots, already cut up into small sizes.  I put them briefly thorough my mini food procecessor.  It saved me alot of chopping!  I also sprinkled some grated cheddar on top.  Great recipe!

Received rave reviews.  I changed it up some to suit my husband's taste.  I used italian flat bread as a base.  Also used garlic/herb dressing instead of Ranch.  Topped it with feta, black olives, sweet onions, red pepper and green pepper.
I received many compliments.

I make this for every get-together everyone loves it!  
It's delicious and colorful.  I substitute reduced fat crescent rolls
and lite cream cheese and add some reduced fat mayo for creaminess.
the flavor is still great!  Also, a little grated cheddar on top is good.
This recipe is definitely a winner- comes out perfect every time!

I love this recipe and make it often.  One variation I make is to mix taco seasoning  in the cream cheese and top with tomatoes, jalapenos, black beans, corn, and green onions for a taco themed pizza.

I've made this numerous times and it's always a hit! The only thing I change on this recipe is that I don't just use cream cheese. I mix together the cream cheese with a small tub of sour cream.

I've made this for several years and still enjoy it! I only use broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and olives. I add a little mayo to the cream cheese, and a little bit of Italian seasoning and dill to the ranch mix. Turned out great!

Delicious! Next time I make it, I'll get two rolls of crescent rolls to fill the entire pan. Also, I didn't get the ranch dressing mix because 1) it had MSG in it and 2) it was expensive. I mixed a little onion powder, garlic powder, celery seed, and parsley with the cream cheese instead. Turned out great!

I added a spoonful of sour cream just to make the cream cheese easier to spread.  Other than that I made it exactly using 1/2 package. I imagine mayo would work as well. Prick the crust with a folk so it does not bubble up.

Fantastic. As some other reviewers have said, don't make this too far ahead or the crust will get mushy. I swapped out the green peppers for orange and yellow peppers (I don't think green peppers would have added an agreeable flavor to this dish), used shredded carrot, and added some chopped radish. I also added a heaping spoon of sour cream to the cream cheese, for spreadability and additional kick. I did want to point out that if you do use two carrots, make sure they are SMALL carrots, as I used two beastly ones and ended up with way too much carrot. I also stuck this in the FREEZER for an hour after it was done, as I had to transport it to a party, so feel free to do that if you need to. I will be making this again.

I used regular pizza crust and added 1/4 cup of sour cream to the cream cheese and it was so good I couldn't stop grabbing another piece every time I passed the fridge.

Omitted the green bell pepper because I'm not a fan and added some chopped olives. Excellent and perfect for a finger food.

I did all to recipe, but used veggies I had on hand; carrots, celery, green pepper, and green onion. I DO NOT like ranch dressing at all, but this looked so good, I decided to try it. I could not leave it alone, it was so good, I loved it! I will definitely make this again, and take it somewhere to show off!

I have been making this same recipe for years.  I make it for parties and even for dinner for my kids on a hot summer evening.  Everyone loves it.  It's a great recipe to mix and match the veggies with what you have on hand.

Very good, and pretty easy. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change anything. I did use matchstick carrots to save a little chopping time. I used a medium size baking sheet and was able to stretch the dough pretty easily to fit. 

Make sure to gently press the veggies into the pizza as you add them, this helps prevent it from falling apart when cutting and eating it. I left it in the fridge to cool for a couple hours before cutting and it was fantastic.

Very easy to make and very pretty!  I know this is a good recipe but it wasn't one of our favorites.  Both my husband and I liked it, but agree that we prefer the hot and melty cheese on top of ours.  I did apprectiate the opportunity to try this one though!  I may even make it one day for a potluck or something.

I made this for my daughter's 11th bday which was not a big hit for kids but the adults loved it. I think that I would do less ranch next time as it was a little too salty (and I like salt!).

You could add sliced green or black pitted olives.
My niece brings a similar appetizer to family get togethers. Always a big hit.

Very easy to make, very tasty, and even the "veggie" averse enjoyed it! Half-pack of the ranch dressing seasoning pack is more than enough. We finely diced the veg and gently pressed them into the cream cheese. Will definitely make it again. Great recipe as is.

The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because there was a bit too much of the ranch mix for my liking. Next time I'll only use 1/3 of the package.

Easy, great taste and colourful.  Next time I will try the suggestion to use whipped cream cheese so it will be easier to spread.  I added a couple minced garlic cloves to the cream cheese mixture - this added a delish garlicky flavour. I agree with other reviewers to used slightly less than half a packet of powder ranch dressing.  Everyone loved this. I think it was nice to serve at a winter gathering because everyone was craving fresh raw veggies.

This was SUPER yummy!! Made mine a little different.  used Philly's cooking creme instead of plain cheese and ranch mix. I also added some onions and turkey bacon. ^_^ Great as a quick dinner too. Add a salad on the side and *kiss* perfect!

This was very good.  I used whipped cream cheese and increased the amount to about 16 -18 oz.  It was a little thicker which allowed me to "press" vegies in more so they would stay on better.  I also used 2 pkgs. of rolls.  I also added black olives on 1/2 and shredded sharp cheddar cheese over all.  Got Rave reviews.

This makes about 8 single serving sized squares if you want them as more of a main lunch item. I used fat free cream cheese (about 3/4 of the pack).  After cooking the crescents I put them in the fridge to speed up cooling.  I also put the cream cheese in the microwave for 15 seconds and had no problem mixing.  I spread it lightly on the crescent.  I made sure to drain the vegies on a papertowel to prevent sogginess.  I also added cheddar cheese shreds on top instead of carrots.  I cooled them for about 45 mins and they were AMAZING!!!!

This is a great semi-healthy appetizer for a party. It looks pretty with all of the colorful veggies. I do cauliflower, broccoli, orange or yellow bell pepper and red and green onions. A nice low fat variation is adding 4 oz. of sour cream in place of the cream cheese, low fat, of course.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

Only need half of the ranch style dressing mix.  But bring lots if its for a party it goes quickly.  Great fresh change to your basic veggie and dip appetizers!

The Ranch dressing mix (I used Hidden Valley) made this way way way to salty.  It ruined an otherwise great recipe.

I prepared the recipe as written except for omitting the green onion and adding shredded cheddar.  To help with quick prep, I prepared the crust the night before and covered with saran wrap, mixed the crm cheese/ranch, and chopped the veggies storing in fridge.  Be careful not to overload the veggies as I did- still tasted great, but pretty messy and hard to serve!

I have been making this recipe for years!  To make it even simpler, just use a Boboli pizza crust instead of baking the crescent rolls.  Top the crust with the cream cheese mixture, top with veggies and that's it!

i love this recipe my grandma has been making her "veggie pizza" for years.  Her alterative is to food process carrots broccli and cauiflower and add some finely diced onions. Since the veggies are fine and crumbly it's easier to eat and just as tasty.

Very easy and my guests LOVED them! I didn't have dry ranch mix so I just used 1/3 cup ranch dressing.  The ranch dressing and cream cheese were really easy to spread.  I also used pizza dough instead of crescent rolls.

I loved the taste of the cream cheese with the ranch-style dressing mix..  It would be a great veggie dip.  BUT, I didn't like the cream cheese with the flavor of the crescent rolls.  Next time I make this I think I'll do a regular thin crust.

I make this for guests all the time. A few changes: I buy Herb and Garlic cream cheese or ranch cream cheese. Then sometimes I make BLT squares by crumbling bacon, chopped cherry tomatoes, green onion and cheese. Finely chopped cucumber is great with it too.

I made this for a Christmas dinner.  I sliced the roll in circles and arranged them like a tree. and used the veggies as decorations on the tree. Pepper slices as garland and broccoli and sliced baby carrots as decorations.  It was gone in no time.  Yummy!

I got a little too enthusiastic with my veggie dicing - I used the food processor and practically ended up with a veggie pesto.  So I just combined this veggie paste with the cream cheese and added shredded cheddar as well, and it turned out great!  It still made a pretty presentation, and they were very popular at bunko.  I only used half of the dip mix after reading several reviews, but next time I think I will use all the dip mix.

Love these :) I use reduced fat crescent rolls and cream cheese. I omitted the green bell pepper and added a bit extra red. I could eat the whole pan myself...no problem!

Follow this recipe exactly!!! If you must make this ahead of time, bake the crust & cover & refrigerate it, prechop the vegetables, and mix the dressing (half the packet) and cream cheese. Keep these three separate!! Put it together an hour or so before you need it and it will be perfect. Three of us ate an entire sheet :)

I made this for a Christmas party the other week, and everyone loved it! Was one of the only dishes to get entirely eaten. I followed recipe, except used whipped cream cheese and spread easily. I also added some finely chopped mushrooms. Yum!!!

These are phenomenal and were a big hit at our Christmas party this year!  In the interest of cutting the time spent performing last minute preparations, I used crostini from the grocery store as the base and easily spread the cream cheese mixture and added the vegetables (chopped the night before) about 3 hours before serving.  The crostini remained very crispy and the vegetables were at their peak!  Will definitely make again.

much better than store bought, but I think that you are better off to choose whatever vegetables that you would normally eat to put on top of the pizza. For example I don't like green peppers, so instead I would eliminate them. I think the veggie selection made this a "4" star recipe. Otherwise a very good recipe! Yummy!

These are much better than I thought they would be. They are beautiful and fairly healthy too, especially if you use low fat cream cheese. The only problem I had was spreading the cream cheese on the crust. The crust kept flaking off and the cream cheese only wanted to stick to the knife. Next time, I think I will use whipped cream cheese, probably 2 of those litle containers. Thanks!

I did not care for the crescent roll bottom. It was too sweet, in my opinion, so I will whip up a pizza crust or something next time. I had lots of leftovers too which were really soggy so I had to scrape off the veggies and toss the wet crust. eww.

This is a great recipe as written, except I use 2 cans of crescent rolls, the whole packet of ranch and approx 1 cup of sour cream mixed in with the cream cheese.  Last time I took this to a potluck I got numerous compliments!   If you like veggies with ranch dip, you will like this!

Great recipe. I mixed a few tablespoons mayo with the cream cheese and used half a pkg vegetable soup mix instead, since we don't care for ranch. We used chopped broccoli, cauliflower and red onion for the topping. The kids loved it!

I have made this several different ways, but this is by far the easiest. I had a potluck at work and someone requested that I make this since they liked it the last time I made it for a pitch in. I couldn't find my recipe so I went with this one. I accidentally put the entire packet of ranch dressing mix in the cream cheese. Since I was worried that the ranch mix would be overwhelming, I spread a layer of sour cream over the top of the cream cheese on the pizza. Also, I grind up my veggies very fine... to the consistancy of crumbs. I got rave reviews from my co-workers!

This has become a favorite among my circle of friends.  They always want me to make this when we have a get together.  Who would have thought they would gobble up veggies more than sweets?!!  The recipe works well as it stands.

This presents itself at all of our family functions by request. Even the kids love them with the ranch incorporated.  Sometimes I will dice cherry tomatoes in place of the red pepper and add finely shredded cheddar cheese! Can't go wrong with this one!

I brought this to a moms club meeting and it was gone SERIOUSLY within 5 minutes!  Everyone wanted more.  I put broccoli, green onions, carrots, mushrooms and cucumber on it.  I'm making two more today for a birthday party.

My sister-in-law makes this for family gatherings and it is always a hit!  As others have stated, make sure you only use half of the dressing mix and spread over cooled crust to ensure success.  A winner!

Healthy, delicous, even kids eat it! I used light cream cheese, red & yellow pepper instead of red & green~I think it gave an even tastier flavor. Just a great, healthy appetizer.

One of the few recipes that's just so good all on its own.  You don't need to add additional ingredients to make it taste better.  It's light, refreshing and really delicious!  And best of all, very easy to make!!!

This was the one item an ex used to make for me.  It was about the only thing about him I missed. :p  NO MORE, lol.  Anyhoo, it's YUM.  I skipped the ranch mix and just seasoned my own cream cheese.  I'm sure I used light, b/c I always do.  I added some Salad Supreme, lots of powdered garlic, some onion salt and Italian Seasoning (just an herb blend I buy fresh).  It was great.  I added califlower to the mix too and fresh basil.  Again, I say YUM!

...Crunchy..tasty..good! Used pizza dough and the whole pkt of Ranch. I also added diced celery and more red pepper to the topping. You will need to cut the veggies small and press them into the cream cheese or you will end up having to clean more than just your cutting board...Thanks Meghan for another inventive way to get fresh veggies on my buffet table!

I loved this, mostly because it was quick and easy, but it really had a nice fresh taste to it as well.  I threw all of the chopped veggies together in a bowl and microwaved them for about a minute and a half to soften them up a bit and blend the flavors.  I also eliminated the carrots since they are not my favorite and used half of the package of ranch mix.  Lastly, I topped with a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a work luncheon and everyone raved about it.  I only used a 1/2 package of ranch dressing mix and add a big scoop of sour cream.  The best part about this recipe is that you can put whatever veggies you want on top!

Two additions make this appetizer really special:  a bit of pesto to the cream cheese and ranch mixture, which I let sit overnight to become more flavorful.  Then I add sliced almonds over the top of the finished pizza.  Always the first appetizer to disappear!

You really can't go wrong with this recipe.  Change the veggies up to your liking (I used carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and yellow squash chopped in the food processer), or use different veggies based on their color for the season.  With the crescent roll and cream cheese/ranch base, the end result will be delish no matter which veggie topping you choose!

Made this for a party over the weekend. I bought 2 things of cresent rolls but only used 1 and a half. I still didnt have enough dressing to cover the whole thing. I think one would be enough. I added some italian cheese. Very good!

Very good appetizer recipe.  I didn't think I was going to like the raw veggies on it but I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't have broccoli so I used olives. I also used 2 cans of crescent rolls because of other reviews.  I think 1 would have worked just fine though.  Thanks for the tasty recipe.

I made this for a holiday party and it looked very nice.  It went over well and I thought it tasted good.  The recipe says to use 1/2 an envelope of the onion mix, next time I will probally add the whole envelope.  I didn't realize that it needed to be refrigerated before serving.  Only for an hour, so I was still able to serve it that evening.  I would make it again, just for its pretty appearance!

These are great and I'm usually not real big on veggies...I even ate them with cauliflower on top! Next time I will try light cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls, and 2% shredded cheddar cheese on top. The prep time is more like at least 20 minutes, but it's worth it!

Very good. It was frustrating rolling out the crescent dough... that stuff does not roll out well! I would recommend using half of the ranch dressing mix at the MOST. I used a little more than half and it was a bit too much. Maybe put in a third and then taste.

This was NOT a hit at the NYE party I brought it to last night.  I made this recipe based on the 5-star rating it's received, but after tasting it, I really don't get it.  It was rather tasteless, and the cream cheese sitting on the croissant crust got it a little soggy (I followed the recipe almost exactly).  More than 3/4 of it was left over at the end of the night, and the hosts asked us to take it back.  Did I do something wrong?

This is my favorite.  I pretty much changed all the veggies to my familys liking.  Very good recipe.  I already have a request to make it for a labor day party this weekend.

These were interesting. I used flaky biscuits and pulled apart the layers. I would only make these again if I have company. I used yellow onion instead of green. They are tasty. OMG, forget about the rolls and just mix together the cream cheese, ranch and veggies and you have an awesome vegetable dip! By the way, I didn't have a packet of ranch so I used about 1/4 cup of ranch dressing. It worked good.

Super easy, extremely tasty---HUGE hit at the wedding shower I took it to. With the veggies, it's all about color...Make it pretty :) I added shredded marble cheese on top. Cutting into triangles gives a nice shape and can make it easier to eat. Highly recommended!!

HMMM. This was ok but I don't think I will make it again. Made for a shower and overall I did not think the taste was worth all the effort. The prep time listed is way off- even with a food processor- and I have made many appetizers that taste better than this one and require a lot less effort. I followed some of the previous suggestions- used two rolls of crescents to cover one jelly roll pan, added a little sour cream to cream cheese mixture to make more spreadable and used less ranch mix. For vegetables I used mushrooms, red peppers, broccoli, green onions and grated carrots. I think it is really important to chop everything very small to make it more appealing to the eyes. I also added a little shredded cheddar cheese which was cold while cold but once it had sat out for awhile I noticed the cheese started to take over the flavor of the pizza. Anyway, thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe although I changed it a bit. Instead of ranch dressing, I used fresh garlic and dried dill weed in the cream cheese, covered the veggies with sharp cheddar. I could eat the cream cheese spread alone it is so good!

Very good. Added a whole packet of Ranch dressing.  About 2 cups of any fresh veggies will work, but make it colorful.  Before chilling, I slightly pushed the veggies into the cream cheese mixture with the back of a flat spatula to hold it into place.  Will definitly make again.

I love this stuff, and its always recieved well wherever I have taken it.  Its highly adaptable, and the vegetables can be altered to suit.  I like broccoli, carrot, tomato, green onion, black olives and a little cheddar cheese.

I've made a similar recipe for several years now.  I add 3/4 c light mayo to the cream cheese and dressing mix and instead of carrots, I use cauliflower and top it with mushrooms and grated sharp cheddar.  I am required to bring these to every potluck at work.  There is never any left.

These were very tasty! For the veggies, I used chopped broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots, and lightly sprinked some shredded cheddar cheese on top. I will be making this again for Food Day at work. Thanks for a winner!

I made this for a family brunch & everyone loved it! I added about 1/4 cup sour cream to the cream cheese mixture just to make it smoother & add a little tang. I substituted shredded chedd/jack cheese for the carrots which was GREAT. Also, after finely chopping the broccoli I blanched it in lightly salted water for about 30 seconds. For veggies I used broccoli, tomato (seeded & cored), and yellow bell pepper. VERY PRETTY & TASTY!!

Excellent recipe.  I use finely shredded Cheddar cheese instead of carrots and chopped tomatoes instead of red peppers -- since I already have the flavor of the green peppers.  Just be sure to eliminate some of the pulp of the tomatoes so you don't have liquid on the pizzas.

I made these for a bridal shower and they were the favorite appetizer there. Lots of requests for the recipe. Like others, I used two things of crescent roll dough (the low fat kind), and used low-fat cream cheese as well. Wonderful!!

I've been making Veggie Pizza for years, but mine always lacked the "pizazz" of others I have tried.  I liked this recipe because the ranch dressing mix added what I had been missing previously. Always a hit at parties and get-togethers!

I'm going to host a baby shower this coming Sunday, so I wanted to test out this recipe before the actual day and it was alright, not as great as everyone says.  The vegetable medley was wonderful though, smelled great, but I felt the cream cheese didn't compliment it very well.  The idea is great however, I might try experimenting with this in the future, as for the babyshower, I'll keep on looking for other appetizers.

Decent recipe, but I thought the crescent rolls didn't turn out as well as I would've liked.  They seemed a little flavorless or too crusty.  Everyone else seemed to like them though; There weren't any left at the end of the night!

I wasn't crazy about this and it did not get eaten very much at my party.  I thought the crescent dough was too soft and the cream cheese too dry.  If I'm going to eat veggies with a pastry, I think it's better hot.  I would have much rather just dipped my veggies in a yummy dip and it would have been a lot easier.

Super yummy! I left out the green onions since our family doesn't like them and it tasted great! Also an idea to make it a faster recipe, you can always go to a salad bar at your grocery store and get the finely chopped carrots!

Try this recipe...it's a definate keeper! Everyone loved it at our cookout!

This were really good, but I highly recommend using much less seasoning! The ranch flavor was a little overpowering and a bit too salty. Otherwise, these are a delightful, colorful appetizer that will go over well with your guests!

For some reason this recipe turned out really bad. It was really salty. It seems that 1 ounce of ranch dressing mix was WAY to much. If anyone knows if the recipe was change or how to better it let me know.

I couldn't believe how fast they went!  I like to make a small tray of them to keep in the fridge to snack on but usually find someone's eaten them almost as quickly as they've chilled!

Love this recipe. Have made this for 3 parties so far and it has been a big hit! Never any leftovers. I did make some changes...Instead of using the ranch dip mix I use the ranch dressing mix which is alot less salty. Also, I top with cheddar cheese.

I doubled the recipe for a holiday potluck and at first was disappointed because I thought the cream cheese/ranch mixture was too salty. But at the party I got tons of compliments on the recipe. The crescent roll dough gives it an appealing and unique taste. I also used mushrooms and mozarella. I'll try it again with less ranch mix, but overall very colorful to look at and tasty.

I served this at my Superbowl party and it was a big hit!  I'm not a lover of bell peppers, so I cut the bell pepper in half and added black olives.  This recipe is great because you can modify it to suit your taste. Next time I'll add mushrooms and shredded cheese. Yum!

I received great reviews for this receipe at an intimate Christmas get-together I recently hosted.  It has a lovely, festive presentation, especially on a colored plate. Very simple flavors, but adicting. I had trouble keeping myself from stealing the bite sized treats from the refrigerator before the party.  Add radishes for a little flavor pep.

I served this recipe at a small "get togther"
of friends at my home.  It got rave
reviews.  Several people requested
the recipe before leaving for the 
evening.  One friend, who had obtained the
recipe that evening, served it on Superbowl
Sunday and reported it to have been a "hit" there
as well.

I love this recipe! I do add shredded cheddar because that’s how I’ve seen it done in the past. I would say though, to the folks that are adding mayo - I take the block of cream cheese and put it in a ziploc bag, fill a bowl with hot water, and put it in for 5-10 min. Your cream cheese will be super soft and spreadable without the funky mayonnaise taste.

Very good! I brought these to a neighborhood block party, and I had positive feedback. I used the crescent roll dough that comes in sheet-form, which makes it easy. I eliminated the green pepper and chopped everything finely (a lot of chopping!) Looking at other recipes, I shredded the carrots, used 1/2 packet of the ranch dressing mix, and topped it with 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Some recipes mention Swiss, as well. Great for a crowd!

Always a good appetizer.  You can experiment with using different "base" breads, like pita bread, naan, or pizza dough.  I also sometimes substitute Knorr vegetable dip mix for the ranch mix... it really works with whatever you have on hand.

Like other reviews I made some changes to the recipe and it turned out great.  I used two tubes of crescent rolls, used ranch dressing to mix with the cream cheese instead of the seasoning packet because that’s what I had, and only used cauliflower, broccoli, carrots and shredded cheese as my toppings.  It was delish and I’ll definitely be making it again.

Soooo good!! Very easy. Make the cream cheese as directed. I recommend adding the toppings that suits your taste. I used broccoli, red pepper, red onion, black olives, green onions and carrots. I thought about adding cheddar cheese, but tried it without and it definitely does not need it. I also cracked black pepper and light sea salt over the top and it turned out amazing!  Will make this all the time now. Thank you for such a good recipe.

This was a hit with my family and guests.  I followed the recipe as written.  I used spiral cut carrots, all the suggested veggies, and added cauliflower and sliced black olives.

It was good and easy but 1/2 a packet of ranch was a little too much to me. If you arnt as big a ranch person, only use a quarter of the packet

Made it with the ranch dressing mix but it was ok.  I prefer it with dill weed and some Italian seasoning.  Obviously this recipe can be made with any vegetables but here's what I used.
Carrots, corn, peas, red onions, broccoli, red pepper, green pepper, brussel sprouts, radish, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese.  I actually had some bacon bits on hand but forgot to add them.

I've made this before and it was a huge hit. I want to make it again for a party at work and wonder if it will still be as good the next day. Has anyone ever refrigerated the pizzas for a meal the next day?

Love it!! I am constantly asked to bring this appetizer to family functions. Instead of crescent rolls I use pizza crust which I stretch out onto a cookie sheet. I bake the pizza dough for 12-14 minutes then follow the recipe. I usually add a half chopped seeded tomato and 1/4 c shredded mozzarella cheese on top. The vegetables can be varied depending on what you have on hand. Thank you for a great recipe!

I have been making this for YEARS, and it is always this first thing to go. Be sure to follow the details of putting it together and and how and when to put the dressing on. It can be great, or a soggy mess.

I make this often, double the recipe and always use mayo in it. I cut the crust before I spread the cream cheese mixture onto it, as it saves a mess cutting it afterwards. I always make it a day before and never have a soggy crust.

I very much enjoyed this recipe. I didn't use broccoli as I am not a fan. Instead I used red and yellow bell peppers.  Then the carrots and green onion of course. I used reduced fat cream cheese and just put a thin coat on the crust. Then I used the rest of the cream cheese mixture on some bagels the next morning. yum!

This is one of my favorite appetizer recipes!  I normally add finely chopped carrots to the veggies already listed (it gives a nice, sweet crunch).  This is the recipe that my quilt group always requests when it is my turn to host.

I loved this recipe! I would definitely double the recipe if you are serving a large group.  It is a perfect summer appetizer.  I added celery which was delicious but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe worked well for a quick appetizer that both kids & parents liked at a potluck I attended. It disappeared quickly, so I guess it was a hit! I followed the recipe to the letter, excepted I substitutes reduced fat crescent rolls & cream cheese. To make the cream cheese more spreadable, I just let it sit out at room temperature for an hour or so. The ranch dressing was a nice addition, added a lot of flavor, and like everyone else said, make sure you only add half, that was plenty. I was worried that the squares would be soggy, but they turned out great. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious and simple. Everyone enjoyed this! As another reviewer suggested, I did cut up the crescent dough before baking so each square could have a crust.

A delicious appetizer! I used reduced fat crescent rolls and light cream cheese, and I don't think that ruined the flavor at all.  I left the broccoli out b/c I didn't have any but used some shredded sharp cheddar cheese for added flavor. This is definitely something I'll be making again.  Thanks!

Made the recipe using 1/2 the ranch packet but omitted red pepper since I didn't have any and sub. pre made pizza dough instead of the biscuit for football Saturday.  I added cauliflower and a very small sprinkle of cheddar cheese across the top and it was great.  My non-veggie eating father in law had 4 pieces and my non-green pepper eating fiance had 3!  It went the fastest even though there were so many greasy/chip dip options available!  Will be making again and again!

I love this recipe. When I told my husband and mother what I was making they turned their noses up. Once I put it together though it was gone in the blink of an eye. Everyone loved it. I also included coliflower. Don't leave out the green onions though...they really give it a kick! I used a little over a half a package of the ranch seasoning as we are big ranch lovers here.

This recipe was so easy and very yummy!! The only modification, I added a tablespoon of mayo to the cream cheese which made it a little more creamy without the mayo taste.  Everybody LOVED LOVED it!!!

I love this recipe!  However, I do make quite a few changes.  I pretty much double up on everything so that I can make a thicker crust and so that it takes up an entire cookie sheet.  This is perfect for making ahead of time, but don't put the cream cheese/ranch mix on the cooked dough until the day of (otherwise it'll get soggy).  My toppings of choice are: broccoli, carrots, green onions, red pepper, and cheddar cheese. I try to cut the veggies as small as possible.  I always get rave reviews whenever I made this, but I have to admit, the chopping of veggies is VERY time consuming...but VERY worth it!

I loved this!  I was hosting a party so I used 2 packages of cresent rolls (refrigerated), 1 third less fat cream cheese and 1- 6oz non-fat greek yogurt, which has a thick texture.  I creamed the 2 ingredients with 1/2 pack (or to taste) of the hidden valley ranch seasoning.  I didn't have the brocoli but nobody noticed and everyone loved it, including the little ones!  I used a round large pizza pan and it was perfect, colorful and tasty!

These turned out great.  I used a yellow bell pepper instead of the green for a little more color, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

I followed some other peoples advice and baked it the night before because I was short on time. I wrapped it in seran wrap and chopped my veggies really fine as another person suggested. When I went to spread the cream cheese it wouldn't spread so I added maybe a half cup of mayo. This was a huge hit.

I follwed the directions exactly.  My guests and I thought that these squares were pretty good, but nothing amazing.  I probably wouldn't make this again.

Very good recipe. A suggestion for the reviews that are getting a soggy crust, try not using the peppers as they contain more water. I use broccoli, cauliflower and green onions, no peppers. I have also made this up completely the night before and not had any soggy crust problems. I also double the rolls and cream cheese and use the whole packet of dressing mix. Have bought the "fiesta ranch" packet by mixtake and it was great. Very good recipe!

I used fiesta ranch seasoning and this was awesome!  No one has ever been so happy to eat veggies.  Chop everything small so it sticks well to the cream cheese and makes it easy to eat.

I love this recipe!! I've actually made it before, but I used the veggies that I like to eat like. That's the great part about this recipe. You can use a tsp of garlic powder in the cream cheese, and then you can sprinkle salad supreme all over it to your taste. It eliminates the ranch dressing packet and gives it a different taste. Thatnks for recipe!

Served this at a birthday party and it was a hit! Got asked several times for the recipes and we had no left overs. Used 1 and 1/2 times the spread the recipe called for and broccoli, cauliflower, red peppers and carrots for the veggies. Very good.  Thanks.

This was an incredibly easy recipe to follow and it tastes great!  The cream cheese and ranch makes for a wonderful spread.  I added cherry tomatoes instead of onions and everyone loved it!  The crust is crispy and very light.  I would suggest using two packages of crescent rolls if you would like a thicker crust.  Overall, I am very happy with the look and taste of this recipe.

This recipe was great inspiration for the appetizer I brought to a Christmas potluck! It was a smash success. I used Pillsbury Crescent rolls and left the dough in triangles during baking. I cheated for the cream cheese spread- I used whipped cream cheese with chives instead of doing the cream cheese ranch mixture. I highly recommend doing this- especially if you're in a rush. I topped half the pizzas with broccoli, slices of cherry tomatoes and cheddar cheese. The others I topped with red and yellow pepper and cucumber. I think the broccoli and tomato ones were more popular, partly because they looked so colorful with the cheddar on top. Thanks for the inspiration!

Read the majority of reviews and decided to bring these to a work xmas party. The only change I made was I omitted the carrots and added finely, diced plum tomatoes- keeping w/ the colors of the season. When I arrived @ the party my expectations were high and thought the squares would go quickly- what a disappointment. They sat on the table untouched for the longest time. An hour or so into the party finally someone took a square, it was me. The cream cheese mixture just didnt work for me. To end this wonderful night, all my thoughts on this recipes were confirmed when my hubby said he didn't like them. I will never make these again. All in all, the squares looked very festive but tasted awful!

Love these, so does everyone else at get togethers.  I usually double the recipe, which makes a ton. I usually follow the recipe but I add cauliflower too.  I myself don't like any of these vegetables by themselves raw, but after being chopped and mixed together they blend wonderfully.

I made it just as directed except I didn't bother with the green peppers because I was running short of time.  It was quick, good and everyone at our party ate it up fast-lots of good comments about it!

I have to tell you - my 7 year old nephew wanted to take these to school for his birthday instead of cupcakes!! I added just a little bit of mayo to the cream cheese to help it spread easier, and some cheddar cheese on top of the veggies for taste and presentation.  I used broccoli, red bell peppers, carrots & green onions on my squares. Great recipe!

This was ok. My kids didn't seem wild about it. I may try it again with a healthier crust and different seasonings. I liked it but didn't think it was fabulous.

We had this for dinner yesterday night and there's only a couple of pieces left over. Made crescent rolls and ranch dressing from scratch, it's cheaper and surely tastier than the store-bought stuff. Used cauliflower instead of broccoli for personal preference.
Thanx :)

Yum! I think it's better if you let it sit in the fridge a few hours prior to serving.  A great appetizer, all of the ingredients blend well.

This is an awesome appetizer and always goes over very well with everyone.  I just soften the cream cheese to room temperature, makes for much easier spreading.  The nice thing is you can change this recipe up by changing the veggies you put on top.  And be careful not to use too much of the ranch, it's not hard to go overboard by accident.

This is so easy to make and it tastes delicious. I have made it for friends this summer and I just made it for my holiday party at work. People love it, especially my husband. It's a little bit time consuming cutting up the veggies, but it's completely worth the effort. Enjoy!

Every time I make this recipe I get tons of compliments. Even my relatives that hate healthy food chow this down. I too cut down the amount of ranch seasoning to about 1/2 a package, and it's just perfect.

this was a great recipe, but i had to make some alterations.  i took out the peppers and the green onions, just because of my own personal taste, and replaced them with cauliflower.  i also used shredded carrots instead of chopped.  the results were still amazing.  i took it to a baby shower, and got many compliments.

Forget the ranch dressing mix and mayo.  I just spread the cream cheese on like it is.  My favorite vege combination is broccoli, califlower and shredded carrots.  I also add shredded cheddar on top of all the veges and push it all down so that if stays put.  My friends always ask me to bring this to every party!

This is a classic!!!  Great for those women who like to have mary kay or lia sophia type parties!!  It is a healthy and delicious snack!  I make mine organic by using organic veggies and organic cream cheese.  I haven't found organic refriderated dough yet, but still it's pretty close!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was divine.  I paid attention to the reviewer's note to use only half the package of dressing powder, which is important.  Best thing is, its quick, its unique, and it pleases all palates--even big meat-eating ones.  Kids will get their veggies, adults their good-tastin' meal, and you, more time OUTSIDE of the kitchen because this recipe is so quick & easy to make!

I omitted the green onions, but otherwise followed to a T. This would make a really great appetizer -- I think  I'll serve it to the boys on football night (it would get them to eat some more veggies!)

Very tasty and easy! I made this over the weekend for a girl's get together and it disappeared.  I used 1/2 of the ranch seasoning and 1/2 of the spread.  I also added some fresh spinach.

Yum, my favortite appetizer.  Easy and yummy.  The hardest part is chopping the veggies.  I used red, yellow and green peppers, half of a red onion, and one small zucchini.

I also added thin slices of mini-cucumbers to mine because I love lots of veggies on mine.  I also did not use the full packet of dressing.  Make sure the cream cheese is room temp before attempting to spread.  You may have to let it sit out for an hour before you mix it up and try to spread.  I also doubled the recipe but not the pans because it made for a more satisfying pizza.  (I did NOT double the recipe and divide over 2 pans!) Everytime I make this people flock it it.  I never have any left over.

Delicious and easy appetizer.  A nice change from the heavy meat-based appetizers such as chix wings, meatballs, cocktail franks, etc.

Very good and I used fat free cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls. You need to crisp up any leftovers.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was just okay.  I've had other versions of this before that were better.  There was nothing necessarily bad about it, just nothing super about it either.  No one at the party commented on it and there was about half the pan left at the end of the gathering.  Wouldn't make it again.

These were soooo yummy! I made them for a small baby shower, and everyone loved them. There were a few left over after the shower, and I couldn't sleep thinking about them being in my fridge. Temptation got the best of me, and I ate them all up at about 2:00am:)

Just made this for a baby shower & it was a hit! Lots of recipe requests. It's a great mix of creamy ranch & crunchy veggies. I had leftover chopped veggies & it was perfect for an omelette the next morning-yum!

This was delicious! I didn't have green bell peppers, so I left those out. I was in a hurry when I was making these, so instead of refrigerating them for one hour, I put them in the freezer for about 30 minutes, and they came out very good. Thanks for the recipe! I'm making more tonight.

This was an okay appetizer.  I used red peppers, broccoli, and green onion.  With 5 stars, I was just expecting it to be absolutely awesome.  I definitely wouldn't put it in that category, but then again, I was comparing it to the awesome artichoke bruchetta I made from this website.  THAT one is a 5 star recipe!

This is really yummy.  Chop the veggies small and push them into the cream cheese mixture.  Use only a small portion of the dry salad mix.  Doesn't have to be rance, can be any kind.  Be nice to take for a Christmas party when every one brings something to munch on!!  Will make it again.

This is a great appetizer!  It's perfect!  The red pepper looked beautiful!  I also added black olives.  The only thing I didn't like about it is that it becomes soggy over time.  It's best to eat it immediately after the 1 hour chill time, when its nice and crispy.  Very tasty recipe!  I made it twice last week!

This recipe was really easy to make and just what I needed for my party. I didn't use as much of the ranch packet. I even tried mixing cream cheese with ranch dressing (the sauce kind), and that worked out really well.

This is "can't miss" recipe. It always turns out and is always popular with my guests. Another person who believes you should push the vegetables into the cream cheese mixture.

It was good and would have been better I'm sure if I used cresent rolls instead of flakey bisquets.  Will do it exactly as recipe calls for next time.  However, I used less than half the ranch mix and it was very good.

These veggie pizza recipes made with a crescent roll crust are always awesome- no matter how you tailor it to your liking.  I followed this recipe but omitted the green bell pepper and added a little chopped cauliflower.  I also sprinkled it with a little finely shredded cheddar cheese for extra color.  No doubt this recipe would be great as is, though, too!

I liked the pizza squares but didn't love them.  My guests seemed to enjoy them.  The crust seemed to be a little tough, but I did overcook it a bit.  Pretty easy to make.

Excellent and so easy.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion of pushing the veggies into the cream cheese - good idea!  My squares were about 2 inches, so it made about 20 pieces.  Already plan on making this for 2 upcoming parties!

These were good. They didn't all get eaten but I had a lot of other food out too. The recipe does not make 48 squares...I had more like 20.

I absolutely love this recipe. I am a picky veggie eater, so our choice of veggies are...broccoli, couliflower, green onions, tomatoes, and we top it off with tons of shredded cheese. Its to die for!!

My mom made this when i was little, and I wasn't sure how so I was really happy to find this recipe.  I made it for a work party, and everyone loved and asked for the recipe.  I used cucumbers, carrots, broccoli, a little (small!) amount of onions.  I also used 1/2 fat free cream cheese & 1/2 reduced cream cheese with reduced fat crescent rolls.  No one knew the difference! Awesome!

I thought this was good and so did other people at our party, but since I used puff pastry that had been sitting in our freezer for a while I think it would have been better if I had bought some fresh pastry. It was good, but not the best, but I think it just had to do with the pastry. The flavor was nice with all of the veggies. Will make again.

Turned out great!  I had a hard time shaping the crescents, so I just made it into a regular pizza cut into little squares.  It turned out great, it was gone before the first hour!

Awesome appetizer recipe.  I think the pre packed dressing that I chose was more salty than Hidden Valley may have been, but these were still good.  I believe the prep time is more than 5 minutes too, cause theres a lot of veggie cutting.  

Overall---very yummy!!!!

My kids ask me to make this for them all the time!! My five year old even loves this! I always have to double the recipe, one for whichever event we're attending and one for home. We add carrots and shredded cheese to ours. It is pretty time consuming to make but well worth it. You know it's a keeper when everyone asks for the recipe!

I used to make this a lot when I sold Pampered Chef. This is always a good appetizer.  Red bell peppers are out of season right now and very expensive so I used broccoli, green bell pepper, extra carrots, and green onion.  Very good!

I made this for my party the other night and everybody loved it.  Especially ladies loved it.  However I did not use green pepper instead I used chopped celery.  So what I chopped up were red pepper, celery, carrots and brocolli.

This was pretty good. I followed the directions to a tee and the peppers were completely overwhelming. And I like peppers. I would try it next time without all the peppers and add different veggies.

This recipie was great.  Made it for a potluck at work and everyone loved it.  I took some others advise and added some sour cream to the cream cheese and ranch mixture.  I also added some tomatoes and purple onion.  I will make it again!!

I made this yesterday for a baby shower and it was a huge success. I used 1 layer of base and did not double it and it was thick enough. The only other alteration I made was that I used softened cream cheese with regular ranch dressing and it gave me a good spreadable consistancy. Taking other peoples suggestion, I added cheddar cheese on top. It was fantastic. Although the leftovers have a little softer base today, they still are tasting great. Thanks so much for the recipe. I will be making this again and again!

Followed recipe exactly and overall, was pretty satisfied with results.  Definitely start with only half the dressing mix, since the cream cheese spread could easily become too salty.  Next time, will try different variations of the recipe, i.e. changing the toppings.

Yum!!  I added a little mayonnaise (tablespoon) to the cream cheese and used vegetable soup mix instead of ranch, with carrots, broccoli and green peppers on top.  Delicious!!!

I've been making this one all my life, and it's always a hit. I vary the veggies depending on what I feel like that day, but am always sure to vary color and texture. Typically brocolli, thinly sliced carrots, cucumber, very thinly sliced radishes, and sometimes tomatoes (only if it'll be eaten soon), then top it off with cheese.

This is a very good, recipe, I didnt alter much, didnt have the onions so I added tomatoes instead. it turned out very tasty..my one complaint though is the crust seemed a bit hard for me, but, it could have been me, cooking it to long. but very flavorful.. I will be making this again.

Just bought my first pizza stone so I'm not a pizza expert.  Used store bought rice crust (*) and only put on half the veggies listed.  It was great!  I love this recipe.  You can't go wrong with this one.

This was excellent!  Like other reviewers, I used slightly less than half a packet of the ranch dressing, and it was plenty.  I also used a large spoonful of mayo, to make it more spreadable.  I was hoping for some leftovers, but these were gobbled up in no time.  Everyone commented on how good it was.  I will definitely be making this often during the summer.

I served these squares at a Valentine's party and was asked for a copy of the recipe by, at least, four different people. This is a great compliment for a novice chef like myself.  I did make two changes to the recipe though.  I used Ranch Salad dressing instead of Ranch powder seasoning and  regualr white onion rather than green onion.

 My only recommendation would be a little less green onion....

This is a great recipe that I've made many times. It is especially well-received at brunches and showers.  I do top it with shredded cheddar cheese, though.

I made these for a party and while they were alright, I felt something was missing.  If you're looking for something a little different, these are good to try.

Probably my favorite appetizer that I now make! Especially great to make this time of year when you can get red bell pepper cheap at produce stands (otherwise, it can get costly.) Beautiful and tasty - chopping veggies ahead of time may help in the preparation time - can't wait to make it again!

Used half the ranch dressing package and it tasted better.  (It didn't overwhelm the veggies.)  My Grandmother still asks about it because she enjoyed the finely chopped veggies.

I made this recipe for a party I was having and everyone thought it was just okay.  My husband thought it should be served with grated cheese over the top and warmed.

My kids actually liked this.  They are fussy eaters.  I really liked it too.  I used reduced fat crescent rolls and reduced fat cream cheese and dressing.  The whole thing went fast!
