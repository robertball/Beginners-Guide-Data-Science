This was one of the best desserts I have ever had. The almonds and chocolate went really well together. My friend and I were also fans of the texture- gooey and chewy in the middle. I definitely suggest making this recipe!

I was not fond of this recipe.

Even my Husband didn't like it.  There are MUCH better recipes out there for this type of cookie.  DON'T MAKE THIS ONE!!

I was generally not a fan of this recipe.  The bars turned out dry, really chewy, and too thin.  I even tried rescuing them with a chocolate fudge topping, but they still weren't very good.
