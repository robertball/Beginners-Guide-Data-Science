Absolutely fabulous!  Don't need to change a thing.  At first I thought only 2 cups of fruit would not be enough, since other fruit pie recipes call for 4 cups of fruit, but this is perfect.  Because the cherries are sweet and hold their shape, more is unnecessary and would probably just be too much of a good sweet thing.  I baked mine for 25 minutes at 425 degrees, and then another 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then the crust doesn't over-brown.  Thank-you so much for a wonderful summer treat!

I had fresh sweet cherries and this is one of the few cherry pie recipes that don't use sour cherries or canned cherries.  Like another reviewer, I also doubled the cherries to about 4 cups.  I omitted the cherry juice because I was pretty sure the filling would be juicy enough and it was (besides, I didn't have cherry juice on hand).  I ended up using 4 cups cherries, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup flour, and some almond extract.  No juice and no butter in the filling.  I used a 9 inch pie plate like the recipe called for, and it makes more like 10 or 12 servings, not 6.  However, it turned out fantastic, and with these amendments, it will earn a permanent spot in my recipe book!

This is perfect cherry pie.  I invested in a cherry pitter recently and it made the task of pitting the cherries so much easier.   I'm happy to have it on hand for cherry season.  I used closer to 3 cups of pitted cherries to fill my deep dish pie pan.   I made this pie for the 4th of July.  With cherry or berry pies, I always try to bake them the day before and let them sit to settle and solidify.  It seems they are always best if they have time to sit before you cut into them.  The texture and flavor of this filling is fantastic!

This was an awesome pie, I used 2 bags of frozen dark sweet cherries (defrosted) and just drained the juice into a measuring cup and bulked it up with cranberry juice(I did not have cherry juice, and it only needed a little bit). I brushed the top crust with some beaten egg and sprinkled it with sugar too. Everybody raved about this pie! It was so pretty, we took a picture of it.

Everyone loved this pie.  Like others, I also used 4 cups of cherries.  I kept the sugars and flour the same, doubled the almond extract, added a little cinnamon, and added just enough water to dissolve the sugars instead of the juice.  I baked in a lattice top crust with cinnamon and sugar sprinkled over the top.

Fantastic recipe when you have FRESH cherries, not the canned variety.
The only substitution I made was using Amaretto in place of the cherry juice and extract.  And I used closer to 4 cups of freshly pitted dark sweet cherries.  Using a Cherry Pitter from Cherrystop.com made short work of the pitting process.
I also used my favorite pie crust recipe with the lard and butter.
This is the first Cherry Pie that I LOVED!  The others are way too tart and runny for my palate. 
Have made this recipe twice in one week...and I would highly recommend it, especially when fresh cherries are in season and affordable.

I was so happy to find this recipe because most cherry pie recipes out there are for sour cherries and my 6 trees are various types of sweet cherries. I'm not sure if it's that my cherries are sweeter than average or people like their pies increadibly sweet but with my 1st pie using this recipe I found it almost too sweet to eat and most of the pie went untouched. My second time using this recipe I halved the amount of each of the sugars and it was perfect. I did use about 1/4 tsp of ground cinnamon in each pie and on my second pie I used a mix of cornstarch and flour, just a personal preference. With the adjustment in sugar and the mixture of thickners this recipe is earning a permanent spot in my recipe box.

I'm with the consensus!! This pie was soooo good and a sweet cherry pie recipe is not easy to find. I make my pies with Ruth's Grandma's crust from this site and I seduce my fiancé with them.

For others: 1 lb of fresh cherries with pits and stems becomes approx. 2.5 cups of pitted, stem-removed cherries after a couple bad ones were removed.
It takes about 15 minutes to take 1 lb cherries from washed to stems removed & pitted, once you have a rhythm going.
Weigh and wash cherries.  Move cherries from colander to bowl 1, removing stems and checking for bad ones as you do.  Pit cherries over bowl 2 with pitter section of garlic press, leaving pits in bowl 2 and letting it accumulate any juice.  Pitted cherries go into measuring cup.  For every cup you dump in mixing bowl, make a mark on a paper or something so you don't lose track.
(IN PROCESS, 4.5 CUPS CHERRIES)
Used 1.75 lbs cherries, approximately 4.5 cups.  Used 1/3 cup each white sugar, brown sugar, flour and 1/4 tsp almond extract (no butter, no cherry juice) per chefathome's review.  Doubled pie crust recipe from Budget Bytes apple cranberry hand pies and rolled to 17" by 18", divided into 12 pieces (5.5" by 4.5", approx).  Cherries had, by this point, been sitting for so long that they made a LOT of juice.  Used ~1/4 cup cherries + juice in each, but there was no way folded pies would contain everything.  Stuffed everything into muffin tins and just smooshed excess crust on top.  Poked two holes in each.  Baked at 350 for 35  minutes.

This pie is pretty good.  I used four cups of cherries, as two cups barely filled the pie plate.  I didn't have any bottled cherry juice, but added a tablespoon or so of water just to get the sugar to dissolve.

My family asked me to bring a cherry pie to Thanksgiving dinner, and I chose this recipe, as I do NOT like cherry pie, at all! I do, however, like dark sweet cherries! I made a double crust (with lard), with cut out shapes for the top, used 2 packages of frozen cherries, substituted cranberry juice, as I had no cherry juice, used 1TBS cornstarch and 2 TBS flour, and doubled the butter.  It was fantastic! I especially enjoyed the look on grandpa's face, when he bit into it, thinking it was sour cherry...he loved that pie more than anyone at the table! Definitely recommended!

My first cherry pie ever and it turned out amazing! A few changes: I used 2 bags of frozen dark cherries instead of fresh. There are no fresh cherries where I live this time of year. I thawed them first in a strainer over a large mixing bowl and used their juice instead of buying cherry juice. I used cornstarch instead of flour added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. And I made a crumb topping because I like crumb toppings on pies! I let the pie sit over night and it's perfect. The flavor is exactly what I wanted. This recipe is the only cherry pie recipe I'll ever need.

I just made this tonight with the cherries from my tree (it's has five different types of cherries on it) and it was fabulous!  I know that most pies are made with the sour cherries, but this pie was wonderful with all the sweet cherries that I have.  I think my pie dish is a lot larger then the average and so I added more cherries then the recipe calls for and now I realize I should have added a little more flour to compensate for the extra cherries and there juice.  This is a great recipe and I will defiantly use it again.

It has REALLY great flavor; however it is weak on the amount of fruit. I changed the recipe and added 5 C of cherries instead of 2 C. I upped the flour to 1/3 C. It turned out fabulous with the changes.

I bottled some sweet cherries in the spring so I used those instead of fresh or frozen and used four cups instead of two. Because they were so wet already from being bottled I omitted any cherry juice but made the pie following the rest of the instructions exactly. It was delicious!

My favourite pie recipe! The first time I made it, I found it a little too sweet for my taste, but everyone else loved it. I have made it several times and it's great every time. I make it with frozen dark sweet cherries and add a bit of the water to the juice from the cherries when they thaw rather than the cherry juice. I also use a bit less sugar than called for and it's perfect for us.

This is a delicious pie ... but don't expect it taste like other cherry pies. The sweet cherries are ... well ... sweeter! I used just slightly more than 2 cups of cherries (about 2 ½ cups) and that allowed me one nicely packed layer of cherries in the pie shell with no gaps. I might add a squeeze of lemon juice next time ... I think it might add that little something.

I used 4 cups thawed out cherries, 7 tbs flour and same amount sugar.  This was good.   The 4 cups made it a deep dish.  The pie came out perfect, but I just prefer sour cherry pie.

This was my first attempt at real cherry pie. I went with 4 cups of cherries since most fruit pies call for 4 cups. Three cups would have been perfect. My cherries were so juicy and delicious, I think I could have done without the cherry juice, but I did add 2 tbsp. cornstarch along with the flour and skipped the butter. This is so much better than canned cherries. I shall make it again next cherry season.

Best cherry pie ever. I doubled the filling ingredients and substituted raspberry lemonade for the cherry juice since I didn't have any of that around. For the crust I used the Easy Pie crust make with vodka. It is super light and flakey.

I had some frozen sweet cherries that I had pitted and frozen, so I used 3 cups of cherries instead of 2 because I  was using a deep pie dish. Next time I will use 4 cups, because 3 was just not enough.  Delicious!!

Best cherry pie that I've ever had. I had to double the filling for my deep dish pie. I only had cran-raspberry juice no cherry and it tasted great.

Ably changes I made was to use slightly less sugar.  I also added about 1/8 tsp tapioca as I found it a bit too runny at first. I’d recommend doing the 425 degrees for 25 minutes then backing down to 350 for the last 15. Everyone loves it

It was way too liquidy.   Not sure what to skip on to prevent this from happening again.

Very tasty cherry pie.  Well liked by the family.  I made my own crust - one using butter that I also found on All Recipes.  Thank you!

Fabulous! I followed the suggestions by Polly: no cherry juice, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup flour and a 1/4 tsp almond extract. Sprinkle top crust with raw sugar.

I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and omitted the butter and juice.  I also increased the pitted fresh cherries to 4 cups because my pie dish is a bit deep.  Absolutely great!  I may cut back a bit on the sugar next time as the cherries were very sweet.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this with fresh Ranier cherries.  When you pit the cherries use a bowl.  Juices will accumulate and will serve as the cherry juice the recipe calls for.  If you don't have enough juice, use another juice or water.

The pie was delicious!  Not too sweet either.  I'll. make this again and again!

Great recipe....this was my first pie! I didn't put a top on the pie, though. Just used the excess dough from the sides of the dish to lay a few strips across. I went with another reviewer's substitution of more cherries and no cherry juice. I also added a dash of red wine. Next time, I will try the other reviewer's advice about turning down the temperature for a while so the crust doesn't get quite so dark. So yummy!

I was requested to make a cherry pie in September, and I couldn't find fresh cherries.  The only frozen cherries I could find were sweet bing cherries.  I made the  filling recipe as written except using 1/4 cup tapioca as the thickener, and it came out great!  I was skeptical, but would definitely make this recipe again!
