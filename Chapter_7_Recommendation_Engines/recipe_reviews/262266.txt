Made as written minus the corn  I didn't have any and I needed to prep and assemble in early afternoon for an evening supper. I used medium salsa which I highly recommend. It gives enough heat to keep the casserole from being bland. I also used more turkey to finish the leftovers and I don't think it negatively impacted the dish.  I liked a glob of sour cream with my serving and I think it sliced and served neatly because I assembled it early.  You could also kick in some sliced black olives!  As written, with the extra cup or so of turkey, it easily served 4-6

This came together pretty easy and was a good way to use leftover turkey. The one thing I didn't care for is that it was loose, There was nothing to hold it into shape once cut into squares. It doesn't dish out well but the taste was fine.
