OK, this is good, but why not just make good old fashioned scalloped potatoes in the oven in one step instead of having to clean the instant pot as well as the casserole dish?
Sure, the cooking time is longer without the instant pot,  but the actual prep/active time for the recipe is less, and you can be doing other things while the potatoes bake.

Nice flavors in this recipe and a time saver instead of baking the potatoes for an hour in the oven! My husband enjoyed these too and asked for the recipe to be a repeat! I lost 1 LB Yukon Gold potatoes and only had about 1 1/4 LB potatoes to use. Although I scaled the recipe in half, I still used 1 cup of water (I was concerned if the IP would come to pressure with less than 1 cup in it). The potatoes were perfectly tender and not mushy. I left all other adjusted ingredient amounts the same. I subbed heavy cream with unsweetened almond milk and used Cabot LF/GF White Cheddar Cheese to accommodate my dietary restrictions. I may have used slightly more than 1/4 cup cheddar on top as I manually grated my cheese, which was more of a fine grate. The end result was a little too much sauce, but it was not an excessive amount and can be easily rectified by not adding all of the sauce if you use less potatoes. My only real change would be to stir the potatoes a little to ensure the potatoes are evenly coated with the sauce, which is what I did. I’ll definitely make this again and as written with 2 LB potatoes, but I think the amount of sauce will be perfect. I’ll be sure to update my review though if the result is different. Overall, an easy to make recipe with delicious flavor and easy to adjust if you have any dietary restrictions. Definitely will make this recipe again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Not what I had in mind for scalloped potatoes.  More au gratin.  Way too much cheese for me and the use of an insta-pot was unnecessary.

This recipe takes a couple of additional steps BUT it is faster and it IS creamier than the regular oven method.  This is one more recipe to add to my Instant Pot winners.  I made this exactly as presented, no additions or substitutions.

A few of my potato slices were too thick and not fully cooked.  Otherwise, it was awesome!

I tried this tonight - very cheesy and tasty. I did not add the nutmeg or garlic, only salt and pepper. I also added a medium-chopped onion to the broth after I took the potatoes out, and let that simmer till soft before adding the cream and cheese. 

Mine was a little liquid-y, so I also whisked in about a half-teaspoon of cornstarch, which thickened it up nicely. 

Also, I sliced the potatoes to 1/4" and set the IP for 1 minute - I'll go a little thicker next time, as they came out a just a bit mushier than I would have liked. I live at 800' altitude, fwiw.

Great recipe, thanks!

Liked this alot. I cooked the potatoes for two minutes based on the feedback of others and they were perfect. I did find that there wasn't enough broth left to make the potatoes as creamy as I'd like, so I ended up putting in about 1/2 cup of cream (which of course made it even better). We all enjoyed this and I'll make it again. As easy as packaged au gratin potatoes but no artificial ingredients.

I really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe.  However, the potatoes were a bit underdone.  I used my mandolin to slice the potatoes to 1/4" thickness.  Next time I will try 2 minutes.

My 8 year old son can’t stop eating and raving about this.   The nutmeg is an unusual twist... and sends your palate on a different journey than you’re expecting at first. Also, the Parmesan and Romano mix I got at at Trader Joe’s had kind of a strong smell... so I may substitute a different combo next time. That said, it was delicious and everyone loved them.

No changes made for this time, but 5 minutes under broiler is about 2 minutes too long.

Great dish!   I chickened out and IP'd the potatoes for 2 minutes instead of 1...that was a mistake!  Made them too mushy, but they were definitely still edible.  Next time I will increase the salt and pepper, and maybe increase the cheese sauce volume a bit. The sauce flavor was awesome, but there just needed to be more of it.  Thanks!

This was delicious, but I didn't have a pressure cooker. So I boiled the potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes.  Cooked the sauce in a pan then poured over potatoes sprinkled with bacon bits and placed in oven.  My kids loved it!

I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and put it in a 9 X 13 pan. All the times were still the same. The other change I made was to substitute diced ham in place of part of the cheese.  The whole family loved it and it was easy on the cook, so we'll definitely be making it again!

Only pressure cook 1 min. And then quick release immediately. Add ham layering as you put potatoes in buttered casserole dish.

I made this exactly as written, except that I substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth as that is what I had. As another reviewer pointed out, there wasn't enough liquid left in the instant pot after cooking the potatoes so I had to add another cup of chicken broth to the pot after removing the potatoes. Next time I will also add more salt to the cheese sauce. But otherwise a great side to dinner and I will make again!

This was incredibly simple and fantastically flavorful. With a mandolin slicer you can have this readying 25-30 minutes start to finish.

Added a bit more cream and broth (used chicken broth as I didn’t have vegetable broth) to sauce at the end as there was not much liquid left in the pot before adding sauce ingredients.  This is now my go to recipe for scalloped potatoes.

Delicious but this recipe is actually Au Gratin potatoes.  Scalloped potatoes are made from a cream sauce with no cheese.

I halved the recipe for my Instant Pot Mini and there ended up not being quite enough sauce so next time I will only half the potatoes and keep the other measurements the same.  The sauce also didn't get as thick as I would have liked so next time I will try a cornstarch slurry as others suggested.  I did really like the time this recipe cut down on so I am looking forward to trying again with the adjustments.  I also omitted the nutmeg due to personal preference and may add onion powder instead.

Was very tasty, will definitely make again.  I had to use canned milk and chicken broth as I didn’t have heavy cream or veggie stock.  I omitted the nutmeg as I don’t like the flavour of it.  Cooked the potatoes for 2 minutes they turned out perfect.  Next time will try with heavy cream, onions, and maybe bacon bits.

Was very easy to make. I always hate making scalloped potatoes because the potatoes are never done enough. Using the Pot to cook the potatoes ahead is a great idea. I only wish the sauce was less cheesy and more creamy.
