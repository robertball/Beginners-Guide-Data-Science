This is a simple recipe with a great result! It is very similar to my usual method, but the little extra from the tequila really adds a nice zing. I will be making this again!

Great tasty recipe. I put all the cranberries in at once instead of half at a time as the recipe calls for. I also added a pinch of nutmeg & a healthy dash of cinnamon.
