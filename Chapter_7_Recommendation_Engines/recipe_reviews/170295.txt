this is the recipe that olive lovers will like. i doubled the feta cheese and the olives where still too over powering.

This is a great recipe.  I did make some changes however.  I eliminated the cumin and used garlic flakes, onion flakes, oregano, parsley and chives.  They came out great!

I have had many lamburgers, loved this recipe the best.  The only change was, I added chopped fresh mint.

Mmm, these were great, nice and juicy, and as an olive fan I loved the kalamatas and feta in the recipe. My kids don't generally like the taste of lamb, but there were no complaints here whatsoever! The only changes were that I added some "Well Seasoned" brand Greek seasoning and made them into sliders on garlic toasted ciabata slider buns. Great recipe K, thanks :)
