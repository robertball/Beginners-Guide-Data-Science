Wonderful different salad. We served this recipe in our school cafeteria to 400 high school students and it got rave reviews. We will be serving this often and put it on our menu soon.

This is a great recipe because it's so flavorful. I use the basic receipe then I like to add 10 ozs. Perdue cubed, cooked chicken & a handful of Ocean Spray Craisins or Sun Maid cranberries & raisins w/ a sprinkling of dill weed. Yummy!
