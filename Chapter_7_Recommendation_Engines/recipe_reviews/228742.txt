Great recipe for the crock pot.  I used turkey ham instead of the bacon and opted to leave out the red pepper flakes because I don't like spice.  I made this a "freezer meal" by dumping everything into a freezer bag (except the split peas) and put it in the freezer.  I took the bag out of the freezer the night before crocking to thaw.  The next morning I rinsed the split peas and placed them into the crock pot and poured the contents of the freezer bag on top.  Turned the crock pot on low and went to work.  Came home to a wonderful meal!  Will definitely make more to keep in the freezer!

I followed the directions to a T.  12 hours after first turning it on - I still had crunchy peas.  I added more liquid (though that didn't seem to really be an issue in the first place, but I thought it might help), and another 12 hours go by - CRUNCHY PEAS.  I've turned the heat up on the crockpot to high, b/c I think that might be the only way to fix it.  I don't want to waste the ingredients by throwing it out.  It's useless as it is now, though.  I had been keeping it on low b/c it was not being supervised (first, away from the house for 8 hours, then overnight while we slept).  Now that I'll be home to watch it all day, I will see if high helps.  If not - I may have to change my review to 1 star.  I only gave it 2 so far b/c the flavor & idea of the soup is okay - the problem was execution.

This is the best soup recipe!  My husband and I love it!  I did make some slight variations.  I sauteed the onion, garlic, celery, and carrots before putting in the crockpot.  I also added extra garlic (I always add extra garlic to a recipe).  And then added 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika and 1/2 tsp of cumin.  We can't get enough of this!

Excellent combination of ingredients. We used ham instead of bacon, but plan to try with bacon!

Made it as is and loved it.  Second time, I borrowed some inspiration from our favorite Indian restaurant.  I reduced potatoes by half and substituted chopped cauliflower of about same size as hash browns.  Additionally added cumin and curry powder.  Yum, yum.  Even better reheated.

Pretty good.  I didn't have any bacon, so left it out, and meant to put in the potatoes but got sidetracked.  Even so, it was a very hearty soup; probably doesn't need the potatoes and ham, but I bet it's good with it.  My only note is the bacon probably adds salt and flavor; it was a tad on the bland side for me, but since I didn't add the bacon I figure that is my fault.  I did have an interesting dilemma with the time frame; it was on all day on low but nowhere near done when I got home, so I jacked it up to high and it was done after two hours on high.  So, for those who are having issues with lack of cooking, try different temps on your slow cooker.  This makes loads of soup; we just finished it this week and made it earlier last week.  Thanks for the recipe!

I literally just finished my first bowl of this soup, and wow!

I followed the recommendations of some reviewers, so this review may be slight misleading (sorry).

Some changes: instead of potatoes, I used cauliflower, instead of chicken broth, I used veggie broth, I pumped up the spices with cumin, garum masala, and tumeric, and blended 1/3 of the soup for a more creamy consistency (since I had no starch from the potatoes).

Also, Instead of adding the bacon at the beginning, I cooked the bacon in a skillet in the last hour and a half, separated the fat from the bacon, spooned a couple of teaspoons in the soup and used the crispy bacon bits as garnish for the end result. 

It's atypical for me to use bacon at all in a meal, but it really made this dish something special. Never had a split pea soup so tasty, and I'm proud to say I made it!

This is almost identical to my recipe, but I have access to smoked ham hocks which are terrific, especially the second day.  I'll put a 1 Kgm ham hock in and by the second day, all of the meat falls off and the marrow has leached out.  Adds great flavour.  Another variation is to use lentils instead of peas.  More protein in lentils.

In South Africa a curried stew or thick soup served in a hollowed-out bun or half a loaf of bread is known as a "bunny chow". It is a "meal in one". I add half a cup of fresh frozen peas to the pea soup just before dishing up to make it look attractive.

Wonderful soup. Very easy. I do it on the stove too. Word to SilverXeno....could your slow cooker be dying? I can't imagine one cooking peas for 24 hours and them still being crunchy. Just a thought.

I have always loved pea soup and this recipe was awesome.  I loved the addition of hash browns.  I had a ham steak on hand so I diced that and added that along with the bacon.  Using the slow cooker is a great idea. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Exceptional!  This is the only split pea soup recipe i'll use from now on.  Instead of beacon, I used cubed ham (available in most grocery stores).  Browned the ham and the vegis in olive oil before adding to the slow cooker.  Added two additional cups of bouillon. My husband asked for seconds! I can't ask for more : )

This was a great fall recipe and easy to prepare...having read the reviews I soaked the peas in a little water the night before to soften.  I cooked on low about 10 hours while I was at work...the only thing I think I'd change is cut down the broth to make it thicker...I also cubed up ham rather than bacon

Good stuff! A hearty split pea soup. Substituted Roasted Red Pepper & Spinach Sausage for the bacon. Other than that change, made as written. After trying some, we wanted a more creamy texture, and decided to gently blend it in a Vitamix (#1 setting for about a minute). When made again, we will add some seasoning beyond black pepper to satisfy our taste preference. The combination of hash browns and mild heat from the red pepper flakes sets this split pea soup apart from most others. This is a very simple recipe, and aided by the convenience of a slow cooker.

using crock pot or stove top this is great!  I use instant mashed if my soup is not thick enough at the end of the process.

I had never made split pea soup before and my hunny was going on and on about his exs. So of course I had to find a recipe. He really like this, I made almost as stated above, He isn't in to runny soup so I cut the broth back by about 2 cups. It made the soup thick and stick to your ribs. I also omitted the red pepper flakes since I was out. Is only suggestion was to add a bit more salt as he felt it was lack, I may have been a little lite with it during the cook because of the broth and bacon. Will be making again with maybe a touch more salt in the cooking time. Mine was in the crock pot for 8 hours on low and then another hour or so on warm.

I wanted to make this recipe as I didn't have a ham hock.  I usually get irritated with all the changes people make to a recipe and then say it's good. But, due to time constraint, I didn't make this in a crock pot, I made it on the stove top.  I took some suggestions from other and used bacon AND cubed ham, added cubed potatoes as I didn't have hash browns in the house and added more garlic.  Oh boy...it's gooooooood!  My husband LOVED it and said this was his favorite soup I've ever made!  I have to admit, I loved it too and will keep this as a favorite.  Thanks!

I usually just use the package recipe, but this was great. @SilverXeno: The key to making split pea soup is to boil it first for 25- 30 minutes (or more), and as it boils it needs to be stirred, frequently.  When the broth starts to turn greener, you turn the heat down to medium. as it gets thicker you then turn it down to low.  Pea soup never worked for my parents as a crock pot dish because as you know, it doesn't come out right.  I hope you have better luck with it next time.

Delicious!  I started this last night and let it cook all night.  It does take close to 12 hrs. (in my cooker, at least) for the peas to be done.  Didn't have red pepper flakes, so I threw in a dash of cayenne and some smoked paprika. True comfort food - thanks Barb!

Put this recipe in the crock-pot with a few substitutions to fit what I had on hand. I used a ham bone, and peeled and chopped a couple potatoes. It was top notch!  Perfect for a cold and rainy night.

I liked this a lot ... I thought the addition of potatoes was a bit much ... pea soup is already pretty thick and starchy, right?  I cut up a  ham steak instead of bacon(I hate soggy bacon). Next time I'll probably omit the potatoes, keep the ham steak large, remove it before serving, puree the soup a bit (with immersion blender)and then  cut up the ham and put it back in.  I will make again with my suggested changes.

Split peas MUST be put in a large bowl and covered with cold water and left overnight to soak!  ALSO...  YELLOW split peas are a must! No self-respecting Canadian would use green!!!  LOL.  Otherwise this recipe works.  If you don't soak the peas overnight they never get soft and mushy like they should in the soup.

This recipe is really good.  I did tweak it slightly.  I sauteed the onion in the bacon fat.  I also added some ham.  Really delicious and surprisingly filling for a soup.

Very good... having had issues with split peas not cooking through in the slow cooker before I soaked them overnight.  Forgot to decrease the liquids, so it was a little watery... I simply took some of the liquid and cooked off another cup of peas with some of the additional bacon I had fried up, and a little more sauteed onion.  I added some hot chili powder in the place of red pepper, as I love the flavor of it in split pea or lentil soup.

Next time I will add a couple bay leaves and perhaps a bit of ham base. (Better than Bouillon brand base)

This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

This is delicious!  I blended about 2/3 of it after it was finished cooking to make a creamier soup.

I used turkey bacon, added more veggies (carrots, celery, potatoes) than the recipe called for, and added just enough broth to where I felt it would still cook everything.  It was AMAZING!  I accidentally forgot the pepper flakes and it was STILL an amazing soup!  So easy and SO yummy, I am going to bring it to my next winter potluck!

Loved how easy and quick it was to prepare. Turn on the crock pot, go to work and you've got hot soup waiting for you when you get home. I replaced the hash browns with cracked potato and used a little liquid smoke for added smoke flavor. To crack potato instead of cutting the potato all the way through just insert the knife a bit into the potato and break off the rest with a twist of the wrist. This makes the broth a bit thicker and adds a bit more potato flavor. Try it I'm sure you will be impressed. Enjoy.

I have never liked split pea soup until now! I made this for my family and it is an instant favorite. Slight changes - I cut the carrots to 1, doubled the bacon and garlic, and added 1tsp of smoked paprika and 1 tsp of ground cumin (thanks to another comment here). I slow cooked for 9 hours.  DELICIOUS!

I'm only giving this a 4/5 because it came out very watery when prepared as written.  Kudos to the reviewers who suggested adding instant potato flakes to thicken it up... saved the day!  I would recommend cutting back on the chicken broth by at least 1 cup to start; you can add extra in as it cooks if your soup is too thick or peas aren't cooking.  Overall the taste is excellent- the addition of red pepper flakes really gives it a little something extra.  Thanks for this great recipe  :)

Pretty darn good and pretty darn easy!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Ham, bacon, smoked hock --- all would be fine for this recipe.  My fella really liked this soup.  I served it in bread bowls.  I will make this again.  Thank you Barb for sharing.

This was FANTASTIC.  It was my first time making and eating split pea soup, and it was a big hit!  We were in a budget crunch, so I used white potatoes diced small instead of buying hash browns, and I think I would do that again---it added a nice heartiness to the soup so it felt more like a meal.  I even had it over a baked potato one day for lunch and that was great, too; the soup definitely improves over time!  This was flavorful, hearty, filling, delicious, easy, and cheap---a terrific recipe all around!  Thank you!!

Since I have either split pea or lentil soup in 90% of my at home lunches, I think I know a good one when I see it. This was delicious. One change I made simply due to expedience: I too overly cooked a small potato in the microwave, then mashed. I don't have hash browns on hand.

Had crunchy peas so I let it sit for a further 6 hours (stirred after 7 hours).   OMG, delish and super filling.  The red pepper flakes gave it a little extra kick.

After 6 hours on high in the crock pot, the peas were still fairly hard.  I blended the ingredients with an immersion blender, put them into a soup pot and cooked for another hour.  Served it with more sautéed bacon and a little sour cream.  Not great.

The major problem I had was the peas were still a little crunchy after cooking on high for six hours. I had to put it in a blender and blend it. My husband doesn't like soupy soup, he would have much preferred that it would have been softer peas so he could have had it more stew-like. My mom didn't like it too much, but I really liked the taste.

I skipped the bacon as this was a meatless Lenten meal, and sauteed the veggies in 1 T olive oil and 1/2 T butter, adding an extra garlic clove.  Substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth and added a bit of salt at the end.  Also added a dash or two of smoked paprika.  Cooked on high for 1 1/2 hours.  Wonderful!

Very tasty. I left out the hashbrowns for a more less thick soup. It was full of flavor and made about 8 generous servings.

I've made this recipe twice, once with bacon and once with ham.  Both times I used a ham bone.  I prefer the recipe with cooked ham over bacon.  I used leftover spiral sliced ham.  Hands down, this is the best soup I've ever made.

My soup is still cooking, but it smells amazing so far.
I do like my split pea soup to be a bit more "mushy" though, and after 10 hours my peas are still quite firm. Next time I make this - and there WILL be a next time because I love split pea soup - I will soak my peas overnight. Or something like that.

This is the first time  my family has polished off a split pea with ham recipe.  My family usually groans upon seeing me attempt a home made pea soup, but the reaction was totally different this time.  My husband's nick name of "baby poop soup" no longer applies.  Thank you for the great recipe! Zero leftovers here.  I needed a recipe for my leftover ham (which we used instead of bacon).  The potatoes were a surprise addition which no one noticed, but must have contributed to its success.

What am I missing here?  I followed the recipe and as others have noted, the peas were still crunchy.  I have turned it up to high to see if that helps, but there is no flavor!   bland...bland..bland.  Trying to figure out how to save this pot of flavored water.

This was delicious! The only thing I would change is the serving size because there wasn't enough!!

Made as is (with the addition of some salt at the end)and it turned out great! I had fully cooked peas at the end and it really hit the spot tonight. Will be adding into our repertoire. Yum! Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy.  Cooked for 6 hours in the crock,pot.   Had to cook for a few additional minutes in a pot  on the stove to thicken it up.  Next time will try with hamsteak. Try it.  It's good and very easy to make
