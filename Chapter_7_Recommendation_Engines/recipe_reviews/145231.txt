This is a thick, glossy, fudge-like frosting, perfect, I agree, for brownies, though I used it to frost My Mom's Chocolate Cake, also from this site. I prepared this exactly as written and found both the ingredients and the directions to be spot on.  Hubs called this frosting a cross between a truffle and fudge. I just call it darn good!

I submitted this recipe and I cannot stress enough how you need to make sure it is boiling properly and for the time specified.  Also, the frosting won't separate from the brownie if you put it on when the brownies are still warm.  My habit with making this is to put all the ingredients into the pot that need to boil together while the brownies bake.  I also put the cup of chocolate chips in the measuring cup and add the splash of vanilla (otherwise I forget it) to that cup.  As soon as I mix in the chocolate chips, I pour it over the brownies.  I never have problems with separation.  It amazes me the ways people have used this frosting and the variations they have found work for them.  I can honestly say it never occurred to me to use this on anything other than brownies, and my Mom was equally shocked when I told her people use it on other things!   Thanks for giving ME ideas for ways to use this.  I do have a friend who refers to the brownies I make with this frosting as "brudge" -- a combination of brownie and fudge. ;-)

Holy cow!  Fudge on top of brownies.  How much better could it get?  This frosting is like a light, fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth fudge.  The word I would use to describe it is "confection."  I missed the part where it said that it frosts a 9x13 inch pan of brownies, and used it to frost an 8x8 inch pan.  Whoopsie, my bad!  Ok not really, I love frosting.....Anyways, follow the recipe to a tee and you will be delighted!

This was a great old-fashioned frosting! It worked fine to use confectioner's sugar (what I had on hand)  I also used 1/3c chocolate chips, 1/3c peanut butter chips & 1/3c toffee pieces in place of 1 cup chocolate chips. The peanut butter chips melted differently than the chocolate, so I threw in 2 tbs peanut butter as well. It suited my needs perfectly, and I could tell it'd make a great chocolate frosting (as intended in the original recipe)

This is the *perfect* frosting for brownies!  Thick, fudgey, and wonderful.  The husband and kids raved about it.  It does set up thick like fudge which is what I was looking for.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfectly smooth.  I poured it over brownies in a 9x13 pan - will definately be making again!

I must admit that I used this recipe to frost two 8" layers of golden cake instead of brownies.  It was a simple and delicious recipe!  I followed it as written to rave reviews~ thanks! =)

I'm not a religious gal - but I said a little prayer after eating this miracle of a frosting. I bet it could make anything taste fabulous... Make sure to work fast though - pour and frost quickly - as I found it started to set as soon as it was out of the pot. Make exactly as the recipe says. I used 'special' dark chocolate chips because I love dark chocolate, but as other reviewers have said, anything will work. Praise the chocolate gods!

A nice rich frosting, I used it to frost eclairs. I made 1.5 times the recipe for a 9x13. The chocolate chips didn't entirely melt but that gave it a nice slight crunch.

MMMMmmmmm... no words sum this up, mmm. there was way to much frosting and I couldn't smother that poor pan of brownies anymore so I had to end up eating all the leftovers, let's just say with a guilty conscious I'll be in baggy sweats and eating like a rabbit for the next 24 hours, totally worth it!

I have used this before but I do not remember it being this grainy.  I think 1 & a 1/2 cups of sugar is asking a lot for just one cup of chocolate chips.  It's really sweet, sets nicely (especially overnight), and is perfect for brownies.

I have not used this on brownies yet! But it makes an excellent frosting for cakes! You don't have to wait for the cake to cool so it makes it super easy to fix one quick!  The best thing is the frosting seeps under the cake and over the sides of you pan and frosts it all around! Delicious!  I also used butterscotch chips and poured it over a yellow cake and it is to die for! You won't be disappointed!

I found this after I had to salvage a failed recipe and did not know what to do with melted milk chocolate chips-this did wonders!!  I had used what I had on hand but since milk chocolate was sweet enough, I made it with 3/4 cup of sugar, 3 tbsp of butter (already had butter/oil in the batch) and heavy cream, with the vanilla extract-turned out AWESOME!  Became chocolate crack for sure!

I followed this exactly and what a waste of ingredients.  The chips didn't melt and it was so thin it ruined the brownies.  I'll just buy a can of frosting  next time

I should give it 4 stars just based on the fact at how fat I feel after eating all those brownies. I would suggest to anyone to use a really good chocolate chip/chocolate when making this. I went for the cheap stuff & though it was still good, I can't imagine how much better it would be had I used some quality chocolate. I still had to put the half pan that was left in the freezer to slow me down & try to save some for my family. I can't believe I ate so much :(

In need of a super sweet, extra rich, chocolate fix?  Look no further...This is basically like a thin layer of soft fudge on a brownie!  Well....If you can stop yourself from eating the frosting before it hits the brownies!  I have had it come out a bit grainy once or twice, but I think that had to do with the weather (it was hot, humid and rainy), but it still tasted good!  Just like fudge, that can have an effect on the end result, so I sometimes boil this for a bit longer, and I do let it set up just a bit before pouring it.  I want to try this with bittersweet chocolate chips next time - I think that would be great!

I followed this recipe to a T but it was very runny and just had to pour it on the brownies.  Another reviewer said she used it to frost a cake and another said it was thick fudgey like texture.  What did I do wrong?

This frosting is easy and delicious.  I don't always get all of the chocolate chips to melt, but I think it adds an interesting texture to the frosting.  I double the recipe and use it to frost a double batch (two boxes of 9X13 pan size mix) in a jelly roll pan--12 1/2 by 17 1/2 inch.  The frosting makes them special.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This frosting is so easy to make, and tastes so much better than the ones made with powdered sugar. The kids loved them and it was a hit at the office! I've been looking for a recipe like this. Thanks for sharing! :)

Fantastic!!!  I followed other reviews and poured on warm brownies.  I used Brooke's Bombshell Brownies from this site.  Mine did turn out thinner than I expected.  I let it cool in the pan for a few minutes to begin to "set up."  Once it started to have a little bit of a fudgy appearance and texture, I poured in on the warm brownie.  It was still a little gooey so I popped the entire, uncut pan into the fridge for an hour or so and it was perfect!  I did also notice that I couldn't leave them out of the fridge in the warm weather or the topping began to get soft again.  Beware---this topping and Brooke's brownies are dangerously addicting.   Make at your own risk!  :-)

This a perfect, and since it is liquid when you pour it on the brownies, it evens out the pan if one side of brownies are shorter than the other.

If you're saying it's too grainy, you didn't boil long enough.  This frosting is amazing on brownies.  It is a delicious FUDGE tasting frosting and so easy!  Made for MMMMM...Brownies on this site..my household is looking for ways to package and sell!

Thank you CRUNCHM for sharing this recipe. I actually found the ingredients, directions and serving amount to be perfect for frosting a pan of brownies. I had an 8x8 pan (recipe states it yields a 9x13 pan) but trust me, the extra thick frosting layers did not go to waste. My family ate this all up with no problem. The frosting was glossy and easy to pour over the warm brownies. I also like how I did not have to wait for the frosting to cool, just pour right onto the warm brownies. I noticed the frosting started to set nicely-to which I decorated. It was the perfect frosting over "MMMMM...Brownies," from this site. The frosting was glossy, rich and decadent. I may use this to frost brownies I make in cupcakes as well.

I got rave reviews from friends!! it is VERY sweet and only use this full amount if making a full pan (9x13) of brownies.  A little goes a LONG way! Next time I DEFINITELY want to add nuts to the frosting while hot! And I can't wait to use it on cake!! YUMMY!!  (Also, my co-workers said the whole thing tested just like fudge!)

WOW!! Super rich and really, really sweet! A little too much for my taste because my brownies i usually make are super rich too. ill definitely keep this recipe for something else though and maybe decrease the sugar a tad. Also I halved the recipe and added a combo of chocolate chips( bitterswt, semi-swt and milk chocolate) and it turned out good. Perfect for  someone with a huge sweet tooth ( not really me) and chocolate lover! I also loved the way it is  made. After a day of cooking and baking I didn't feel like pulling out my mixer and having to clean more so this recipe with the one pan was great. I also like that I just had to pour the frosting on instead of trying to spread which is a great time saver. Thanks so much Crunchm!

This is our favorite brownie frosting recipe. I have been making this all my life but I usually use brown sugar instead of white. Nice flavor. Make sure that you do not cook anymore than the stated time or less or it gets hard and grainy. Use chocolate chips. I usually use Ghiradardelli chips

I made this last night to go on a pan of brownies I made for a co-worker's birthday. It is my new favorite frosting. I have another person wanting me to put it on a dark chocolate fudge cake for her. The others are right. It's like a peice of fudge on top of a brownie. Aslo it was so easy to make so that is a big plus.

This was just as I wanted, except a little grainy. It's very yummy and so easy. I over baked my brownies on accident and needed something to fix them, without having to bake another batch. I just can't wait to serve them this evening!

Had a box of boring bland looking brownies so searched forna recipe to jazz it up. Took this into work and people were calling it crack! It is super sugary and sweet but oh sooooo delicious! Makes any box of store bought brownies seem homemade! Yum!

Oh so good!  This recipe is very similar to one my mom makes, but hers uses shortening instead of butter.  I thought hers was so good, but this is smoother and creamier. This is definitely my new 'go to' recipe for chocolate frosting.  YUMMY!

my GO-TO frosting recipe for a couple years now!  I haven't made anything else since finding this one.  SO simple, and it turns out lovely and smooth - you just gotta work fast, once it's poured on the brownies. The only thing I'd say for advice .. sometimes I have to put the pan back on the burner, low heat for a short time, to melt the last little bit of chocolate that's being stubborn.

This recipe is amazing!  I used it on my gluten free brownies and my whole family loved it.  I made it just the way it was written and it was enough for a 9x13 pan.  This will be my brownie frosting from now on!  Thank you :)

It had a good flavor, but i guess i just didn't like the texture. It was a bit thick and hard - sort of paste like.

Yum, yum, yum!  I followed the directions/ingredients exactly...okay not exactly...I did boil a little longer than 30 seconds.  I used milk/semi sweet chips because it didn't specify a specific kind.  Absolutely fantastic!! I couldn't keep my fingers out of the pan.  I used it on the Quick and Easy Brownies (from this site)

I needed a last minute cake filling for my son's birthday cake, this worked great.  After adding the chocolate chips and vanilla I let it cool until slightly thickened, then spread it on one half of the cake then put it in the fridge to set.  After about 10 minutes it was set and I added the top layer of cake.  It was really a layer of fudge in the middle of the cake, very decadent!

Fantastic brownie frosting! I used to frost a boxed mix of brownies and it made them taste homemade. Frosted an entire 13x9 inch pan.

WOW! This stuff is SOOOO good. I halved the recipe for a 8 inch round pan of brownies and it was the perfect amount. I used Ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate chips. I could eat a bowl of this stuff without brownies it was that good. It reminded me of the frosting on Wegman's chocolate cake.

This is dangerous because its so easy and so yummy!! I made a layered brownie cake (2 boxes of brownie mix put into 4 round cake pans),and put it between each of the layer and then on top too. Had just enough to do that, could have used another 1/2 cup or so, but for a 9 x 13 pan would be plenty.  My son said this is like fudge in between brownies, so good!  It is rich and sweet, but that's how we like our desserts. :) Soooo good will make again!

Perfect on Brooke's Bombshell Brownies from this site. I used semi-sweet choc so the fudge wasn't too sweet on top of incredibly sweet brownies. I could almost pour this into an 8x8 pan and eat it alone! So good.

SOOOO good and rich - but not too rich. I put this on dark chocolate brownies from a box and it was yummy. We ate it warm - couldn't wait.
It was a tad thin even after the chips melted...so I thickened it a bit with powdered sugar. YUM!

This frosting is wonderful and couldn't have been easier to make.  I didn't have a grainy texture as other reviews have mentioned.  I used bittersweet chocolate and could have used less sugar for my taste since it's very sweet but very good overall.  It is pourable and hardens like fudge.  Great recipe to have on hand.

SO GOOD! I think I ate half the frosting before it got out of the bowl... oops :) I followed the recipe exactly ingredients wise. However, I did want to spread this on a cake so I took another reviewer's suggestion and whipped it for a few minutes into a thicker frosting after following the rest of the directions. IT WAS PERFECT! I love that it was now easily spreadable, but dried into a hard-fudge-like frosting. It was enough for me to frost the inside of a double layer cake, the top, and most of the side (probably would have covered the whole side if I hadn't eaten so much first!). I used it as a base to put the Chocolate Ganache Recipe over it (from this site).

Awesome!  Will use again and again.  Makes a really thick frosting for 9X9 brownies.  put on 3 layers.  Hardens quickly so easy to layer.  Next time I will try adding candy pieces after the frosting.  Thanks!

Wow this frosting is SO delish! Even my husband who normally is anti-brownie-frosting thought they were amazing. P.S. my secret to ultra chewy brownies is beat the eggs together and then pour out about 1/4 of the egg in the sink. Mmmm perfect!

Decadent. Sinful. Transcendent. This frosting turned my lonely box of brownie mix into chocolate heaven! It set REALLY fast, so definitely watch the timing and have the brownies ready to be dressed in this glossy, perfect, fudge frosting!

Quick, easy and delicious.  My kids were using their peanut butter cookies to scrape the leftover frosting out of the pan.

This is excellent - just like extra think chocolate donut frosting! I do think this would taste great on a sheetcake - like chocolate bar donuts, but cake! Thank for for submitting this one!!

Best fudgey icing ever.

I made this again on Feb. 21-16.  I didn't think I had boiled it long enough before I added the vanilla and choc. chips, so I put it back on and boiled again for about a minute.  It was still very runny, but the sugar dissolved better and it turned satiny.  I waited for it to cool a bit before pouring onto the warm brownie and of course, it was so runny that it really gravitated to the sides of the pan.  Will have to wait and see until it is completely set to see what the outcome is.

Heavenly. Decadent. Irresistably chocolate frosting (who would WANT to resist anything chocolate anyways?!)  =)  This is SO quick and easy to make. I love the beautiful sheen it leaves covering my brownies. I easily covered two 8x8 pans of brownies and had enough left so I coated some pretzels...still had some left. It's that insanely good, I would've eaten it with a spoon. =)

I used this for cupcakes, but it was a little thin. The taste was outstanding though, and it does thicken after sitting, so I can see why it's the perfect brownie frosting!

I found this recipe this morning after I had baked my brownies the night before. I debated about using it since it said to put it on after brownies were hot out of the oven. I used 60% cocoa Ghillardelli chips and it went on just fine! I pour it over evenly and took my spatula to fill in any gaps. No problems with it separating from the brownies! Next time I will try it once they are fresh from the oven, and I think I'll sprinkle nuts over the top too. Sweet and yummy!

This is a great recipe. I used it for my family's Super Bowl party. One thing I would like to put out there though: It's a bit too sweet. I would reduce the sugar a bit. Still a great recipe, though!

This was a super easy recipe and tastes great!  I won't ever buy frosting from a can for brownies again.  I made the recipe with skim milk instead of regular milk and for the vanilla used 1 tsp. (I like to measure things out).  It turned out perfect (guilty here of licking remains out of pot once cooled!).  Hubby said to be sure to save this one!

I love this recipe! It makes the perfect amount for a thick, fudge layer on a 9x13" pan of brownies. Tonight I decided that I wanted more of a dark chocolate flavor, so added a couple of spoonfuls of cocoa powder when boiling the sugar, butter and milk. It is still plenty sweet, and the texture is as wonderful as ever.

Excellent, rich flavour that went perfectly with the the highly-rated and reviewed "best brownies" recipe from this website (using this frosting instead of the one on the recipe). These were a huge hit at work. I sprinkled Valentine's Day coloured sprinkles before it hardened and they looked so cute! Absolutely perfect... I will definitely make this combo again!

This frosting is awesome! Very quick & incredibly easy to make. I paired it with the best brownie recipe, which is also on this site, instead of the frosting that was listed with it & I was not disappointed. Didn't change a thing & don't suggest you do either because they were gone in a matter of hours at my house full of picky dieters! Thank you!

Soooo  simple and yet SOOOO delicious!  I put on top of brownies and makes them heavenly.  I think I may try this on top of my cheesecake and see how that is.  The possibilities with this is endless and I can't wait to try them!  It does make a lot, I had left over from my brownies.  I want to try with powdered sugar and see how that does as well.  This is a must try!

Mixed bag here. Pros: Easy to throw together in just a few minutes. Pretty, glossy finish.  Cons: very slightly grainy texture. Too sweet for us. As I had suspected, the chocolate flavor is only as good as the chocolate you use. The first time I make a recipe, I like to give it a fair shake and stay as true to the listed ingredients possible. It calls for "chocolate chips" so that's what I used. And, unfortunately, that's what it tasted like. In the future if I do make this again, I will sub bittersweet chocolate,  which I believe will make this so much better in taste, and will have the additional benefit of cutting back on the sweetness. As for the texture, I believe about 30 more seconds of boiling would take care of that. Not bad, but there's room for improvement.

I tried this recipe to frost some brownie bites for my 7 years old daughter's birthday and it was a hit!! I just replace 1/3 of the chocolate chips with white chocolate and it just turned awsome!! I fully recommend it!

I would have given this recipe five stars, but the first time I made it as written, it was too sweet, so I changed it and used only one cup of sugar and added more chocolate chips, 1 1/2 cups semisweet and 1/4 cup milk chocolate and boiled the milk, butter, and sugar for 45 seconds.  The flavor was much better the second time and I was very happy with it. This frosting was a little soft, but it was soft the first time I made it, too.  It is a good frosting.

I liked these brownie frosting and it was pretty easy to make.  It is VERY rich and fudge-like.  I liked the taste of it, but thought it overpowered the brownies and really made them taste like fudge instead of brownies.  I probably won't use this recipe again unless I mess up when I make brownies and need to cover up my mistakes.  Maybe I'll read some of the reviews more and see if I can come up with other ideas for it.    

I did think that the frosting seemed grainy at first (and I followed the directions EXACTLY).  But I tried the frosting before it hardened completely (it hardens to a consistency that is almost fudge-like).  It wasn't grainy anymore after it reached the fudge-like state.

This frosting was a huge success.  I was in a hurry so I made two boxed brownie mixes and baked them in a large cookie sheet with 1 inch lip.  Poured half a jar of Mrs. Richardsons caramel topping over that with some pecans and doubled the frosting.  It was described as "the best brownie I have ever had".  It was smooth, shiny and chocolatey. Defiantly a keeper.

As the other reviews promised, this is wonderful frosting. This recipe calls for simple ingredients (the reason I picked it), I used 'homemade evaporated milk' from dry milk instead of fresh milk. Fudgey, chocolatey, very sweet.

wonderful frosting. I use it on the dark chocolate cake I recipe also on this website. heavenly. I leave it to harden a bit before covering the cake with plastic wrap to keep it fresh. it also keeps the cake moist and fresh for many days. I love the fact that you can slightly feel the sugar crunching under your teeth but that it melts away quickly once in your mouth.

The first time I tried this recipe I used skim milk and it never seemed to harden, so I used Carnations evaporated milk and it worked beautifully. I also cut the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup because this frosting is very sweet.

I used this for brownies. I thought it was ok, not exactly what I was looking for. Too grainy from all the sugar. Just waiting for the brownies to cool so I can see if it goes better with the brownies than just me trying it by itself.  I couldn't get the chips to melt completely, so I tried to cook it a little longer without success. While pouring it over the brownies, I saw the bottle of vanilla, totally forgot about it, which I hope would have made it taste better. It just tastes like sugar with a little chocolate to me, way too sweet.

Yum.  It's in my "hand it down to my kids" book of recipes now.  I frosted a 9x13 pan of brownies with 1 recipe, it's not as thick a layer as what is in the picture but I thought it was plenty enough.  I used half semi-sweet baking chocolate, half chocolate chips (because that's what I had) and it seemed to turn out just fine.  Everyone raved about it, thanks so much!  (BTW, it's even better the day after you make it)

This was SO easy, quick, and DELICIOUS! I didn't have reg. milk on hand, so I substituted coconut milk instead and it turned out great. I think this may have also had the bonus of preventing the frosting from setting up too hard. I didn't have any issues with this being grainy as some other reviewers experienced....kept it at a rolling boil for about a minute. I halved the recipe for an 8x8 pan of the Best Brownies recipe and it was the perfect amount for a generous layer of gooey fudge. YUM!

Yum! I made a half recipe and use this to frost a half recipe of Brooke's Bombshell Brownies from this site (so a 9 by 9 inch pan). I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I used 3 ounces of semi-sweet baking chocolate instead (so I would have used 6 ounces if I had made a full recipe). After I poured this on the warm brownies I put them in the fridge to get the frosting to set up. Me and my husband really liked this fudgy frosting, it made the brownies taste just like a bakery brownie. I did find it a little to sweet for my taste so next time I might reduce the sugar or use a mix of unsweetened and semi-sweet baking chocolate with the same amount of sugar. Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out awesome. It got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. I have made it several times now. Today I wanted to take brownies to work and knew I didn't have enough chocolate chips so I decided to try it with the butterscotch chips I had in the freezer. It took a little bit more mixing once I added the chips but turned out just as well. The people at work could not get enough of them!  I used a wisk to get the chips mixed in well-the spoon didn't seem to be doing the job. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I halfed this recipe and used white chocolate chips for a brownie frosting.  And since it's fall I added some yellow and red food coloring for a nice fall orange.  I just wish I had some pretty brown leaf sprinkles to put on top.  I haven't eaten them yet, but I took a lick of the spoon with the icing and it was REALLY good.  I'm taking them to a party this afternoon so I'll let you know how everyone likes them!

Very delicious frosting!

Like many people said, it tastes like fudge, and melts in your mouth. Not to mention that it hardens incredibly quickly and is so easy to make. 

I just put it on store-bought brownies. I didn't have a chance to eat this plain, lol, because it was starting to harden in the bowl, but I sure didn't have to wait long until I could devour one of those brownies! I also used a 9x13 pan, and it had a very thick layer of frosting (about 1/4 of an inch).

I would defiantly recommend this!

Easy way to dress up boxed brownies!  I doubled the batch and covered 2- 9x13 pans.  My brownies were cooled completely, but I didn't have any problems with the topping not sticking to the brownies.  My only substitution was to use half margarine and half butter, but it was still great!

5* for ease of preparation / 3 1/2* for overall quality and taste - not bad, by any means, just not one of my favorites.  I had cleaned out my pantry and found a lowly box of brownie mix I had bought for camping trips that was set to expire - couldn't stand to waste it, so I went ahead and made it up (shudder shudder).  Made a bad thing much better and I thank you (grin).  I, too, couldn't quite get my chips to fully melt even though I had at full rolling boil as specified and there is a definate *grainy* taste - but trust me, nothing your kids would EVER notice.  Nice standby recipe.

I couldn't imagine this frosting being good but was I wrong!  It was SUPER!  I too thought it would be too sweet but it really did compliment the brownie - this will be my new way to top my box brownies.  A dipper of vanilla ice cream with them was yummmmmmmmm.

I really wanted to like this, and it was just okay.  It is like fudge, which is good, but it isn't the best tasting.  There is too much sugar in this recipe, it makes it almost taste grainy even though it was mixed really well.  With some tweaking I think this could be better. It never really binds to the brownie, it is an entirely seperate layer that was easily seperated from the brownie.  It didn't spread, or taste like frosting.  This recipe is fine for dolling up a 1.00 box of brownies, but if you're taking the time to make brownies from scratch I wouldn't use this frosting.

Okay, it is a bit grainy, and sets up really fast.  But it could easily be mistaken for fudge. Quick, easy, CHOCOLATY!

It didn't come out right....I was afraid it would be too sweet so I put a little less than 1 1/4 cups of sugar, but it was still too sweet.  Plus it came out feeling kinda grainy... not what I expected.

Perfect frosting for any brownie.  Do make sure you add to warm brownies though, otherwise will set and will come off separate from the brownies.

Easy, fast, and light! This is a wonderful frosting and I am delighted to have found it. It tastes so nice, sweet but not overly sweet, with nice chocolate flavor and very light, nearing a whipped icing in my opinion. Why would anyone ever buy canned frosting again with this gem of a recipe!?!  Don't hesitate to try it!

Oh... you must have some of this melt-in-your mouth chocolatey goodness.  Ever at a party and can't decide between a brownie bite or a piece of fudge?  Why have to decide!  Get the best of both worlds (but with extra moistness) by spreading this frosting over your favorite brownie recipe.  Reviewers who claim this recipe is grainy either can't follow directions or don't know a good fudge when they taste this.  I'll be making this again and again.

Ok- this stuff is great!  I completely ran out of chocolate chips and subbed a cup of chocolate syrup.  While the end result was not frosting,  it was an ultimate GLAZE that did not make the brownies soggy- even the next day.  WOW CRUNCHM- your mom rocks! Will I make this again with the chips? OH YEAH!

This frosting is perfect for brownies.  I have tried other brownie frosting recipes and have been disappointed.  I made boxed brownies and baked in a springform pan.  I poured the frosting over the warm brownies and topped with chopped pecans.  I drizzled carmamel sauce on top just before serving.

One word...AWESOME! Just one tiny change...add 1/8 teaspoon of salt (if using unsalted butter) to bring out the sweetness...it really works! I'm going to try peanutbutter chips next time.

All I can say is this is amazing! After it turned out so well, on the other half of the batch I added about six tablespoons of my homemade raspberry jam to it. Added just a touch of tart. I will use this again and again! Thank you CRUNCHM!

I made exactly as shown but I found it to be too much icing for a 9 by 13 inch pan of brownies. I think next time I will half the recipe. Very good though.

Made this last night to pour over a chocolate cherry sheet cake.  I absentmindedly dumped the chips into the not-yet boiling sugar mixture. Uh-oh, big mistake. The frosting remained grainy  no matter how long it cooked, then the butter separated out and chocolate seized.  Sigh..... Started over and followed directions for a perfect finish on my cake.

This is absolutely delicious! Perfect for brownies, but I do have one suggestion: don't use this for individual brownies, only for a regular pan of brownies. I made mine in a mini muffin tin and used this to top them off, which tastes great, but they're not very pretty. The icing cools with that crunchy kind of sugar coating that is wonderful on brownies, but it makes it very difficult to work with if you're trying to do individual brownies instead of just pouring it over a whole pan. In order to keep working with the icing for my mini guys, I transferred it to a glass bowl and popped it in the microwave for 30 secs at a time each time it started to crystallize. This kept it nice and smooth. However, when I put it on the brownies, even at a slightly thicker consistency, it spilled over the edges and got pretty messy. Next time I'll try this with a regular dish of brownies.

Great rich and can be made dairy free:) I used almond milk and coconut oil/ palm oil in place of the milk and margarine. Going to try a stick of melt. I use enjoy life chocolate chips:) it's hard to make my three year old not feel left out. So once I bought them to a school function and they were very popular.  Serving size it like an inch, very rich. Goes great with the almond flour brownies. Thanks for sharing.

This was so good and so easy! I'm not much of a baker, so when my box-mix brownies were just so so, I decided to frost them hoping that would help.  So I found this recipe, read a bunch of reviews, and it turned out perfect!  It made a huge difference; the brownies were delicious! I halved the recipe, used confectioners sugar (reduced the amount as many people said it was too sweet), and I used mini morsels.  I had no problem, they melted just fine.  Since my brownies were already cooled when I decided to try this, I put them in a warm oven (100 deg.) while I was making the frosting. The mixture was not thin and did exactly what it was supposed to do.  I will definitely make again.

Really good recipe! Because of food allergies I used: non dairy chocolate chips, coconut oil instead of butter and almond milk instead of milk. It came out great! Its my go to recipe for a fast frosting. Also, if you are baking an 8x8-9x9
brownie cut the recipe in half.

It's hard to go wrong with this combination of ingredients. I did cut the sugar down to about 1 cup since the brownies were already quite sugary, and it turned out great.

Great recipe.  If you are using too big a pan, tilt the pan slightly and then beat.  The added depth of the liquid will melt the chocolate chips easier.  Fudge, like old fashion fudge.  It can be poured into an 8 x 8" pan and be fudge!

Really good for when you don't have powdered sugar and/or want a harder icing that "sets." I used this to drizzle over a Bundt cake and it worked beautifully. Also, try swapping 1/4 cup of the sugar for the same amount of a powdered cappuccino mix- it adds a wonderful coffee aroma/taste. Btw- I had lots of left over icing, so if you are drizzling it over a cake instead of spreading it, you could halve the recipe and still drizzle generously.

This frosting is so good!! I have made it 3 times now. It doesn't need any adjustments -its perfect just the way it is. This will be a go to frosting not just for brownies but for cakes and cupcakes as well. The pan cleans very easily which is just another plus! If this comes out at all grainy, I think its only because it was not cooked long enough. When you add the chocolate chips, stir very quickly and for a few minutes to avoid burning the chocolate -or just let it cool for a few before adding them. Thank you CRUNCHM!

Really enjoyed this frosting; I actually didn't take it off of the stove after adding the chips, I kept it on, and poured it over a chocolate cake. If you don't touch it, and just let it do its thing, it is very nice and shiny. This is a keeper!

I Just made this for some chocolate cupcakes and I was impressed since it's very hard to find good frosting recipes that don't call for special items that you wouldn't normally have. This was really easy and really tasty! It does dry very fast so make sure you have your item baked before you make it. I still had some cupcakes baking when I made it so by the time it was done it dried in the pan but I put a little water in it and reheated it a bit and it worked fine. Definitely fudgey, very sweet but in a good way so that doesn't knock down any points. I made everything exactly how it said except I added a dash of salt and next time I'll probably add half a tsp of instant coffee powder to enhance the chocolate flavor. I used nestle semi-sweet chocolate chips. I have a lot of siblings and they all liked this recipe so that makes me happy! This would be good on a lot of different desserts, not just brownies.

I think this icing has potential but it didn't turn out for me. It was a bit granular tasting (I think the sugar didn't dissolve properly) and very sweet.

It was so fast and perfect for brownies but I would make it next time with semisweet chocolate chips. I used milk chocolate as it was what I had on hand and it was reeeeeally sweat.

This did not work for me, the resulting frosting tasted fine but would not harden.  It was okay, I was just wanting a hardened frosting so I could cut the brownies nicely and bring them to my daughter's school...this was super messy and gooey, even the next morning.  I boiled for 30 seconds, removed from heat and added chips as the recipe stated - but mine didn't look like the other photos. Good luck!

Perfect Frosting! So simple! The taste reminds me of a Sheet Cake frosting. But easier! It does go a long way...This recipe really will frost a 13x9 pan.

Super easy, and super sweet!  For me, the sweeter the better, so I love this recipe.  I cannot wait for it to cool on the brownies to dig in - just licking the bowl tells me it's a good one though.  I think the main thing is to let it cook long enough to really mix the sugar with the milk and butter - once it's a nice rolling boil and starting to combine, count to 30 seconds and then it's done.  You can keep stirring too.

This frosting is amazing - so quick and simple to make, but looks and tastes like it came from an upscale bakery!  Pours easily then thickens as it cools to give a thick, glossy, fudgy result.  Perfect!

THE BEST FROSTING ever!  Makes brownies just like my favorite upscale bakery's.  If you're concerned about graininess, you can use extra fine sugar if you have it around for making drinks.  If not, you can boil longer than 30 secs.  I did both, just to be careful, and it is the perfect consistency.  TO DIE FOR YUM!

Wow! This frosting was so quick and easy to make but tasted like I spent a long time on it. It got rave reviews on my homemade brownies and made the perfect amount for a 13 x 9 inch pan. This one's a keeper! P.S. This tastes great made with white chocolate chips, just let the frosting set up a little longer.

This frosting is wonderful!  I put one batch of this frosting on a double batch of the "best brownies" recipe found on this site.  While the brownies are very good, this frosting puts them over the top.

Made it with peanut butter chips! So good! First time I made it with white chocolate chips for my son's football party. Was easy to decorate into a football field. Would have taken a pic but it was gobble up as soon as it cooled.

I have made this many times exactly as the recipe reads.  I've put it on boxed brownies and I've put it on scratch brownies.  

This will take your brownies over the top and you will not be disappointed.

Creamy. Fudgy. Smooth.

So amazingly delicious.

I followed the recipe as called for and used it for an 11 X 17 pan of brownies.  This is a delicious frosting and it sticks to the brownies.  I got tons of compliments for my frosted brownies. One note is spread it quickly before it starts to cool for best results.

Was great. I used 1 cup of superfine sugar and 1-1/2 cups of semi sweet chips. When boiling, wait till it bubbles all the way into the center. I did boil for 45 seconds and it came out great.

I'm not a baker, nor am I a big fan of frosting, but this one is great and very easy.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and I didn't find it cloyingly sweet. I made a half batch to spread over a 9 x 9 inch pan of brownies. I will say that you have very little time to get it onto your brownies (like, seconds). I poured the frosting over the warm brownies immediately, but by the time I went to spread the frosting, the very top had started to set, so the surface turned out quite glossy but very slightly lumpy instead of being satiny smooth. Next time I think I will drizzle the frosting over the brownies and just let it set instead of trying to spread it after pouring...And I may use a full batch of frosting, since it's so good!

I've made this several times.  Perfectly chocolaty and fudgey for brownies.  I believe I need to boil the granular sugar for 60 to 90 seconds to make it a little smoother.  Had a very slight grainy-ness, but still good.  I think I will try it with 1 1/4 c. of confectioners sugar for a cake frosting.  I tried using it for a poke cake, but it was just a little too thick, even when hot.  I might just try pouring it over a bundt cake next time.  You definitely need to work fast!

Never, never, never, NEVER substitute margarine for the butter.  Sometimes margarine will work in a recipe.  This is NOT one of those times!  Yech!!  Oh, And it doesn't set.  Original recipe is super fantastic!  No changes necessary.  Many compliments every time I've made it.  My mother-in-law actually asked me to make them yesterday and she very rarely will allow me to contribute!  That's why I feel compelled to rate the recipe, so no one else has to feel the sadness of margarine.

Sooooo amazing.... This is for a 9x13 batch of brownies, btw. I ensure that the chocolate is mixed quite well and I do not let it set up at all prior to putting it on my brownies (because I think that makes it crinkle faster). WOW!!!!! Perfect.

Stumbled upon this recipe looking for something to jazz up some plain boxed brownies since my 7 year old has been trying to learn the basics of baking. OMG, this did it for sure! We made thick brownies in an 8x8 so we thought a thick topping would suit them well so we also made a full batch of frosting. Since this goes on with the brownies still being warm it locks in the moisture resulting in as many have said before me " chocolate crack" that would be perfect with some vanilla icecream, a glass of milk or coffee. Personally I'm thinking Vanilla Gelato with Chocolate Wine. I noticed that several others noted theirs ended up being grainy, this happens with fudge that is not cooked long enough too. Make sure you get a nice rolling boil it should actually start to turn slightly more white in color at this point if you don't you will still have sugar granuals that did not melt which will make for a rather dissapointing frosting.  Alternately I you should be able to substitue powdered sugar for the granulated sugar and not need to be as careful in having it boil for the correct duration but you still need to watch closely so you don't over cook/ burn your frosting. This should come out super thick and creamy, so pour it fast before it starts to set in your saucepan. My daughter was helping so we still had quite a bit left in the sauce pan which was fun for the kids once it cooled down enough for them to be able to lick the spoon and pan. Nothing went to waste : ) Pretty sure we w

This was delicious. Made exactly as written. Poured the warm frosting over a warm chocolate 13X9 cake I had just taken out of the oven. Over a 13X9, made about a 1/8-1/4 inch layer of frosting, but seemed plenty enough. Was almost like a fudge frosting. My whole family loved it.

Rich, creamy and fabulous! This frosting is similar to ganache in smoothness with a lighter, fluffier texture. It makes even so so brownies amazing!

This recipe is easy and very good! However,  the frosting thickness was the same as the brownies in a 9x13 pan. I will cut the recipe in half the next time I make it.

I used this frosting to make a brownie birthday day.  Made 2 (8 inch) pans of brownies, so had icing in the middle and on top.  Absolutely the perfect flavor and consistency.  I did let the frosting rest for a few minutes before icing the center to give it time to thicken just a little.
I will use this recipe forever!

THE BEST CHOCOLATE FROSTING EVER EVER!  I make it in the microwave. I melt the butter about a minute. Then add the milk (I like to use evaporated milk), vanilla, and sugar (I used Splenda.) Stir it up really well & microwave about 90 seconds or less, until it gets frothy. Then I add the chocolate chips and mix it thoroughly with a fork. That's it with only a bowl to clean.

Thank you so much for this masterpiece!

Nice fudge-like frosting that doesn't need to be kept refrigerated. I only added about 1/3 cup sugar since I don't like overly sweet frosting and it came out just fine!  This is a nice alternative to the typical butter-cream or cream cheese type frosting.

Unbelievable!  Used this to dress up a plain old box of brownies and the result was delicious!  I got many more servings than usual out of a 9x13 pan because it made them so sweet and rich!  I will be trying this again for sure!  Next time will scale down the sugar or use unsweetened chips and see if it makes it slightly less sweet.

I love this recipe and everyone who tries it seems to love it also.  This recipe makes a generous amount so if you don't need such thick frosting you could cut it in half.   I make a batch and a half for two pans of brownies.

This is amazing! Tastes very much like the fudge my mom would make when I was little. If you're finding it a bit grainy, then you're probably stirring it too much while it's heating. Thank you so much for sharing this!

This is truly the best frosting I've ever put on a brownie and I've been around a few years. We tried the first brownie when it was still warm and OMG! Truly decadent. I'll definitely be using it again and am anxious to try on other baked goods. I followed the instructions exactly and had all the ingredients ready to make it just before the brownies came out of the oven, as was suggested. Perfect! Thank-you for this great recipe.

This is a great recipe. It firms up really fast so be sure to pour it right away! Nice creamy texture. I made it with my 8 year old daughter for our Seahawks brownies!!!

Made this exactly as stated and poured onto brownies right when they came out of the oven.  I am a chocoholic and may never make brownies without this frosting again :)
Thanks so much for the recipe!

This frosting tastes really good, however mine turned out really runny. It may have been because I melted my butter too much instead of softening it. Or it could have been because my stove somehow caught on fire while making this and so I had to stop everything and by the time everything was settled, my brownies were cold and I had not yet added the chocolate chips into my pot. I will try this recipe again and I hope that I don't burn down my house! :P

Unbelievably delicious! This icing turns everything sinful!
I have not only put it on brownies and cakes but also rice crispy squares. It's a hit for any school celebration. My kids, their friends AND their parents race to my platter of fudge rice crispy squares first! If it happens to make to much icing for your recipe, don't be shy 200and pour it warm over a bowl of vanilla ice cream. It's a crowd pleaser no matter how you have it.
Thanks for sharing :)

Wowzers! Can it get any easier?? I made a half batch for a homemade brownie recipe. Things learned? I'd use whole milk next time instead of skim, although not sure if that would make it more rich. Also, pour it in the middle of the pan RIGHT AWAY!! This baby hardens up as soon as it hits the brownies, even if the brownies are still warm. And last, make it over and over!! Seriously made a great brownie recipe BETTER!! A new family favorite!!

I used powdered sugar but followed it exactly besides that.  I frosted cooled brownies that I had made the night before, and it still worked wonderfully!  Will definitely use again!

I have used this recipe twice. Everyone loved it. Another member wrote that it seemed "grainy", but that's because its like homemade fudge, not icing that's made from 10K sugar.

Awesome frosting, so thick and fudgy! Just like grandma used to make. Blended seemlessly with the brownies. It took longer than expected to bring the mixture to a full rolling boil, and I had to bring it up to medium high heat. (7/10 on my electric stove). I can't see making brownies without this ever again.

I have a huge sweet tooth and this was intense.  I don't think I can take it on brownies again.  I would try it on a cake instead.  It's very fudgy and very sweet--great flavor but it was a bit grainy.

I think this is the best frosting ever!!  I use Hershey's milk chocolate chips and it turns out great every time.  It does make a lot of frosting, so depending on how big my batch of brownies are, I will sometimes half the recipe.

Frosted my chocolate zucchini cake with this. Very good!! I used milk chocolate chips (because that is what I had on hand), and it was pretty sweet. The kids loved it, but for my personal taste, next time I will use semi-sweet chips. Thanks for a delicious, easy frosting recipe. 
eta... Since I live at an elevation of 4200 feet, I boiled this an extra 30 seconds. Turned out perfect.

I admit I made a mistake with the frosting. It was a bit gritty. I guess I didn't boil it enough. However, it was delicious anyway. I used 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 unsweetened baking chocolate (what I had on hand). I would make this again.

Beware!!!!! This frosting is highly addictive ( if you have a little problem with sugar ;D) This is seriously the best stinkin brownie frosting on the earth! I didn't have white sugar, so I used powdered and I used a little more vanilla. My husband even liked it! This will be one I'll be keeping in the rotation!

I have a brownie frosting recipe that I always use, but at the last minute, I found that I was low on powdered sugar.  Found this recipe in a last minute panic, and it is perfect!  Now it's my new frosting recipe.  Thanks so much for this!

One word, YUM! Simple and delicious... you don't even have to spread?! I don't think you could mess this recipe up. I made it exactly as is, using milk chocolate chips, but you could probably use any flavor. I teamed this frosting recipe with "best brownies" from this site (added chocolate chips to them) and got a real WOW brownie. For a WOW dessert/sudae, warm one up in the microwave for 10-15 seconds, top with vanilla ice cream and your favorite ice cream topping. Mmmmm-mmmmm, melt-in-your-mouth GOOD, and worth every calorie!I love allrecipes.com, and send out many thanks to all those who have shared their wonderful recipes, and brought such bliss and variety to many a taste buds! :)

Fantastic Frosting.  Tastes like fudge, I use it every time I make brownies now, but would be just as happy eating it with a spoon. So good.

Yes,this is a wonderful recipe--but too much frosting for 9x13.  I halved the recipe--same cooking time, etc. and turned out just fine.

Delicious but its ideal only to use half of the mixture on the brownies since it is sugar headache type sweet, and plus you don't want it overpowering that treat youve worked so hard on.

This was very delicious and easy. However, it was so gooey that I really can't recommend it for a layer cake, unless you put massive amounts of wax paper underneath - when this is warm, it's just too runny.  I would, however, definitely use this over a sheet cake or brownies!

This frosting is amazing, with a fudgy, rich flavor.   Easy to make, too!   I only wish it came in a spreadable vs. pouring-only version.

I have used this recipe for my brownies to take to  parties as well as just for treats for the family at home. Felt compelled to register to review this after reading the earlier 1-star review (seriously, only 1 star?). No complaints and never a leftover. Not sure why others have had issues with grainy texture as that hasn't happened to me.

Did not care for this at all!  It was way too sweet and the texture was grainy.  Took this to a family reunion and only almost the entire pan was left.  Definitely not a hit on our dessert table!

This is a defineite keeper!!! I had to bring a dessert to a work event and was really short on time.  I picked up a box of bite size brownies at Costco and topped them with this frosting.  It literally took me 15 minutes from start to finish!  I spooned the frosting on top of each brownie, let it harden up a bit, then spooned some more on! Simple and Delish!!!!  Thanks for sharing!

This frosting is delicious.  I have one of those "as advertised on TV" brownie pans with the divided insert in the pan to cut your brownies perfectly and easily.  When I take the brownies out of the oven, I pour this frosting onto each pre-divided square while the divider is still in the pan. There is enough frosting to give each piece a thick coating.  (In order to be able to pour the frosting, you must make the frosting right before you pour it on.  Otherwise it will start to set, and will not pour very well.)   I then let the whole thing cool and then cut.  These brownies have been a big hit at our swim team's bake sales this summer ...always the first item to go.  This frosting is the best!

This recipie was so darn good!  Kind of reminds me of the jiffy chocolate frosting.  I used this for cupcakes, and I would cut the recipie in half as there was a ton left.  Also, this dries fast, so dip and twist quickly!  And if you want to decorate, have a helper.  I also tried this with white chocolate chips and it was equally delicious.

So wow, this is awesome.  I didn't have a problem with grainy-ness, I used regular sugar and might have boiled a little longer than the thirty seconds It really is over the top on brownies, makes them very special.  I wish it set up thicker though, its very hot and humid here and my brownies are a bit goopy.  Don't think they'll mind so much as they are so good.  I always use the one bowl brownies recipe from the box of bakers unsweetened chocolate. That is the most fabulous recipe.

I tried this frosting on the Best Brownies recipes from this website and absolutely fabulous! I made this for Father's Day and WOW how quick and easy this recipe was to throw together. The directions were spot on, I didn't have to change a thing. I was able to pull the brownies out of the oven and then make the frosting and the brownies were still warm to frost the brownies immediately after all the chocolate chips were melted. This recipe is a Keeper!

Wow! This is an awesome frosting! Like many others I didn't have any chocolate chips, but I needed something for my son's 9x13 birthday cake.  I had a Dr.Oetker pkg of chocolate icing ($0.77), but it yeilded only enough for an 8in cake. So, I used the icing mix with about 8 tablespoons of butter and the milk.  The icing turned out amazing, but as I haven't made it as stated I can't really compare.  *The only other thing I noticed, as I wasn't cooling the mixture by adding the chocolate chips to the hot milk mixture, it stayed runny for longer. I would suggest letting it cool a bit before pouring on the cake/brownies and make sure the cake is mostly cooled too.

I discovered this wonderful recipe a while ago, and have made it for myself and my children many times as a delicious topping for plain old boxed-mix brownies.  The other day my daughter asked me to make a pan of "just the frosting"!  Well, why not, as it thickens to almost that consistency anyway!  It's a frosting and a candy...:)

This is a phenomenal frosting. Smooth, rich, creamy, chocolaty, perfect. It's enough to frost a 13x9 pan of brownies to a perfect thickness. I used it on Bombshell Brownies and they were a perfect combination.

Made this last night as directed. I used milk chocolate chips, and I think you could use any chips you want. I'm going to try it with white chocolate chops or peanut butter chips next time. Poured it over brownies made from a box mix. Perfect!!! Will seem too thin at first, buts firms up real nice as it cools. A true winner!

Super yummie!!  I didn't have a problem with it setting or with it being grainy from the sugar.  Just make sure you boil it long enough. I used it on Brookes best bombshell brownies and it was a great combo.

Super good! Pretty sweet so I add a lot of nuts and use about half the recipe on a single 8x8 pan of brownies. I refrigerated the other half and used it a few days later. To reuse all I did was drop the cold chunk of it right on top of a fresh out of the oven pan of brownies and walked away. When I came back, the heat of the brownies had melted it and it coated the entire pan beautifully. I figured I’d just come back and smooth it out once it softened but I literally didn’t have to do a thing. So nice! On my second make of the frosting I used half brown sugar and it was very good still. Thank you for this recipe!

My family gave this 5 stars for flavor. I gave it 4 stars for texture.  My try resulted in a frosting that separated from the brownies when I spread it and dried to a hard crust. I must have done something wrong.  I would like to add that a sugar butter mixture burns easily so stir often. I used a medium heat also.  However,  I'm not giving up on this recipe.  It is delicious!

This is the BEST brownie frosting! It gives any brownie a little something extra special. I pour it on top while the brownies are still slightly warm and then let it cool overnight. Amazing!

This frosting is amazing! It tastes just like fudge. My favorite way to use it is to make a recipe of peanut butter buckeye filling and spread that over a pan of brownies, then pour this frosting over it. Absolutely divine! I made no changes; this recipe is perfect as it is!

Sweet but it is supposed to be- use different chocolate or less sugar if you do not want it super, super sweet. Makes a thick, rich fudge-like frosting, besure to get first ingredients to a full boil for a minute-ish and stir like heck after adding chocolate

This is the easiest homemade frosting you will ever make (follow the directions and set a timer for the boiling time).  This is the frosting I use with yellow cake and marble cake in a 9x13 pan, because yellow cake with chocolate frosting is the birthday request here.  It is fudgey and very rich.

Delicious!! I will definitely be making this again and again. I used brown sugar just because I didn’t have white and it was perfect, just what I was looking for. I like how it sets too, not hard but not too soft.

This was pretty easy to make and yummy.  I used Almond milk- that's all I had on hand.  It has a very rich fudgy taste.  It does get a little hard after a day, so if you like your frosting softer, you may need to stick the brownie in the microwave for 15-20 sec to soften the icing.

I made this for my family and they loved it. But I did make some changes because of some of the ratings I read. I used evaporated milk instead of milk, hoping this would help to ensure they frosting was not too thin and runny. It worked perfectly. Plus, I think it made it more creamy and fudge like. I also started out cooking Sugar, Evaporated Milk and Butter on very low heat until mixture was smooth and fully combined. Then I raised heat and brought to a boil. Boiled for 30 sec. like recipe called for.  It is very sweet but ITS FROSTING FOR BROWNIES! Just grab a glass of milk. lol.

This had some nice flavor, it was a bit grainy, but when it was on the brownies, you couldn't really tell.  We refrigerated the extra and ate as fudge, very nice.

This is a great recipe and it is such a great addition to a regular brownie! This is a fun and creative way to add more chocolate to a brownie. Just saying though, it takes almost a day to harden.

I made it as written and it was WAY too sweet! I cut the sugar by a third and it was a lot better. I have to say that I was surprised by the amount of sugar asked for considering chocolate chips already have sugar in them. I think I could even cut out a little more and it would be even better.

Too rich for us, even over lackluster box brownies. I really liked the way it poured liquidly over the pan of brownies and then hardened up though.

I made this to go on top of the "Best Brownies" recipe from this site. The recipe didn't specify, so I used milk chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand and it was way too sweet. I'm rating it 4 stars because I'm sure with semi-sweet, it'd be perfect.

Topped Best Brownies(from this site) with this icing. When first put on the brownies, it was really good, but we found it hardens up, and is grainy in texture. Next time I'll stick to powdered sugar icing.

I made this frosting, but gave it its credit by turning it into the best fudge ever! I added 250 grams choc instead of the recommended amount and added a cup of walnut crumbles. It was not heavy or sickly, just absolutely delish!!!

VERY sweet and a bit grainy.  Not exactly what I was looking for, but it spread well and looks pretty!  I'm more a "cake" person than an "icing" person, though, so a little would go a long way.

The flavor of this recipe is ok, but it is not a frosting, it is a glaze.  The texture is pretty grainy as well.

I found this recipe and thought it sounded like just what I needed for the Devil's Food cake I'd just made from a box. Unfortunately, I didn't have any chocolate chips, but I did have some unsweetened cocoa powder. I swapped those, a cup for a cup, and added another 1/4 cup of sugar. The result was delicious! The texture was grainy, but I actually liked it that way, although other's didn't. It still tasted great and it wasn't too thick or too runny. Thanks for this recipe!

So I was desperate for chocolate frosting and had no chips, or bars, or even chocolate bunnies anywhere in the house!!  I decided to use this as a base recipe and see if I couldn't get creative.  I substituted baking cocoa for the chips.  I halved the recipe because I figured it wouldn't turn out.  So I used about 3/4 of a cup of baking cocoa and 3 more tbsps of butter.  I brought all except the cocoa to a boil for 30 seconds, then stirred in the cocoa.  I had to really whisk it to get the lumps out.  Then I added about a cup of confectioners sugar to sweeten it up a bit.  It actually turned out!!! The frosting came out smooth and satiny and looked gorgeous!!!  The taste is definitely dark but compliments sweeter treats perfectly!!  So thanks for a great starter and some good ideas!!

Good frosting, very sweet though. Definately way too much for one batch of brownies, I would maybe cut the recipe in half next time.

I only gave it 4 stars because it seemed a little grainy but after reading the other reviews, I see that confectioner's sugar can be used too. I'll try that next time. The frosting is very sweet so I may use less sugar next time. I was skeptical at first because it seemed thin but after pouring it on the warm cake, it set up really quickly and really well. All in all, it was fast and easy and just what I was looking for.

This was fabulous-It reminded my entire Texas family of "Texas Sheet Cake" frosting. From here on out, this will be the only way I eat brownies! However, the frosting took a while (a couple of days) to "dry" or become firm.

This frosting is perfect. I sprinkled crushed peppermint over the top for a company Christmas party. They were a huge hit!

This was delish!  I was in a rush to bake brownies for the soccer team party and the brownie recipe I used was dry and flaky so I wanted to cover it with frosting.  This was the ticket.  I defintely won't use the quick brownie recipe again but I will use this frosting recipe.

Very fast and easy fudgy recipe! I poured it warm onto a baked 9 X 13 inch pan of homemade brownies and sprinkled some rainbow sprinkles on top. YUM!
