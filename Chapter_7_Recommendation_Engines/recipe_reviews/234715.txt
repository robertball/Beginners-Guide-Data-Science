Made this for my husband's birthday celebration - loved by all!  And I'm NOT a baker.  Followed recipe exactly - so flavorful, moist, not overly sweet: perfection!  Can't wait to make again - would be great without the icing, too; and they'd be vegan! Eager to try variations of the olive oil cake; lots of possibilities.

Admittedly, I've only done the cake part. My full intention was to do the pistachio frosting but changed plans after my kids said that they wanted other flavors. So my review is for the cake part - it is a very lovely cake for cupcakes - not overly sweet (I find many cupcake recipes to be sickeningly sweet), moist, flavorful. I have made it topped with a semi-sweet orange cream cheese frosting dusted with grated dark chocolate and it was perfection! Hopefully one of these days I'll get around to the pistachio frosting.

Wow is all I can say.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't change anything.  These were some of the best cupcakes I've ever made.  They were devoured at coffee hour and I was told this recipe was a keeper and ill definitely have to make them again in the future.

So delicious! I substituted the 1/3 cup of oil for melted butter, I do in all my baking. I also had to double the frosting recipe.

5 stars for the cupcake, perfect orange chocolate flavor and perfectly moist.  The frosting is quite gritty, I even tried mixing it longer but something just would not dissolve, guessing the pudding powder, but had great flavor!
