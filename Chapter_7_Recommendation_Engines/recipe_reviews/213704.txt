Made original which was just okay, very weak.  Added triple sec, lime juice and more ice and it turned out much better!

Something was missing from this recipe.  I think it needs to be made a little richer with some Grand Marnier perhaps.

I liked this, but my husband didn't at all...  so I am currently enjoying the whole batch by myself.  I did change the recipe a bit by juicing some clementines we got today rather than tangerines, and I used the premium style agave tequila Costco sells.  I'll make it again for myself or when I have company over so I'm not sucking down a ginormous drink on my own.
