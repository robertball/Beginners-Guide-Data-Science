Good ratios on the ingredients. Not too sweet nor too bitter, and easily adjustable if that is not the case for the end user. These make nice Valentine's gifts. Thank you for the recipe.

Personally, I loved this recipe and added a bit of a twist. In my initial batch, I had pre-made vanilla sugar to use, and I also added in cinnamon and ground cloves, plus probably a bit more cayenne. It was fabulous!  Very gourmet and with a flavor more like Mexican or South American spiced hot chocolate, and I'd recommend these additions if you enjoy that taste. The more traditional American/Swiss Missers in the house did not agree, even with the deep chocolate flavor in general, and since we were making for extended family gifts, I decided to go with that opinion. I ended up adding MUCH more sugar via adding a nearly equal amount of confectioners sugar to lighten up the chocolate (as I'd seen in other more traditional recipes the use of even primarily confectioners sugar) , and basically drown out the spices. With that alteration of essentially doubling the sugar (eek!), my son rated it 10/10.  Since I loved the recipe though the deep chocolate, less sweet original flavor does not appeal to all palates, rated a 4/5. Thanks for the recipe and inspiration!

Husband and I decided to make this for Xmas gifts.  For most everyone we went by the recipe but we have diabetics in the family.  For them we replaced the sugar with 1/2 the amount in splenda.  It was a huge hit.  Mom says she can never go back to any other cocoa it all tastes bad now.

Made this recipe as is - fantastic!!  Surprised it has not gotten more reviews, considering the few basic ingredients.  I did use Hershey's dutched cocoa, which has such a rich flavor.  I'm super glad I stumbled on this recipe - would not have tried the  Hershey's dutch cocoa otherwise.

We had some Hershey's cocoa and it was good, next time I'll try a higher quality Dutch Pressed cocoa as suggested.

Very good flavor however as noted by others I added more sugar.  I also added a bit more salt to it which brings out more sweetness.  Dutch cocoa is a definite must for this.

I made it as is and it came out great! Best hot chocolate I've ever had. I used Hershey unsweetened but I would like to try it with higher quality cocoa. I also use milk for this and it comes out great and mixes together easier.

Added a dash or two of cloves and 1 Tbsp cinnamon. I didn't have cayenne, so I did 3 dashes of red chili powder.  I realize now that I didn't use Dutch-processed cocoa. I did use high quality unsweetened baking cocoa, but Dutch-processed would make it better. It's not very chocolatey.

Made this tonight for an alternative to coffee so late at night. I was craving something warm to drink and was also craving something sweet. This is delicious! Thank you so much for sharing, I will be making this frequently this winter.

I love this cocoa mix.  I put a pinch of cayenne but can't taste it.  Next time I'll try a little bit more.  Thanks Chef John Note: in a double batch I used 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
