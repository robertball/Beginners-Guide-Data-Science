I thought this was just OK, really masked the salmon flavor. My boyfriend loved it.

Fantastic! Made this for a friend who was visiting and she asked for the recipe. When she got back home she made it for her husband and he asked where she got it because he said they never have food that good. My husband must have been bragging about it at work because his boss asked for the recipe too.
