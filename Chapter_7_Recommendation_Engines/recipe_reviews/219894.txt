These were good.  Didn't pan fry,  put them in the flour and baked at 425 for 15-20 minutes, then dipped in sauce, reduced oven temp to 350 and cooked for 30 minutes, basted after 15.

These were a big hit at my football playoff get together!  Made them exactly as the recipe called out and they  were amazing!  Was told that these were the best wings ever

Thank you for a tasty wing recipe! We really liked this. These are FULL of flavor! I did make some adjustments for our tastes. First I could only fit 1/2 the wings in my pan for searing, so I cut the butter (i did use butter instead of margarine) way down. I used 1/4 cup butter and cooked the chicken about 4 minutes on each side. I didn't need any more butter to cook the 2nd batch of chicken - there was enough fat in the pan.  In the sauce I used 3 serrano's but I did seed them first. I also cut the ginger down to 1 tbsp. I LOVE ginger, but I thought 2 tbsp might be too strong for our tastes. I did have the other tbsp on hand just in case to add it if needed, but I didn't use it. I reduced the sauce down until thick. It took a little longer than 7 mins though. Maybe about 15 mins but it was worth it. I think next time I will cook it down even longer for a thicker sauce with a stronger flavor.  Either way - we really LOVED these and will make them again.  The star of this recipe is the sauce - it is soooo gooood! Reduce it down until it tastes the best to you. I left out the msg and the sesame seeds too

We loved this! My Husband really enjoyed the taste as well as my children. I couldn't find any serrano chile peppers so I used 2 red jalepeno peppers which were hot enough and I have McCormick ground ginger that says at the back 1/4 tsp is = to 1 tsp of grated fresh ginger which is stronger and so I opted to keep the same measurement of 2 tbsp using the ground ginger to give it a more potent taste and that was a great choice because these tasted really Asian and we love Chinese food out of all Asian food in the Bahamas. Tip for those who may not know, to get toasted sesame seeds just place sesame seeds in a small pan by themselves (no oil or butter) on medium heat for 1-2 minutes until darker brown.

This was very good. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used 1 1/2 tsp of powdered ground ginger and I used two jalepeno peppers instead of serrano peppers and I did not use the MSG or substitute anything for. The mixture stinks, but the finished product has a great taste. I plan to reuse this recipe many times more

These were pretty good!  Ive never used margarine to fry before and it turned out well.  I made as is and it taste kinda like our korean chicken.  Next time, I think I'll just deep fry until cooked then toss with the sauce (that has been thicken).

So yummy!  My family loved these wings!  After I had already started cooking, I realized I was out of fresh ginger... so I had to use ground ginger powder, and they were still fabulous!  I used a few dashes of dried chilis instead of the hot peppers, to keep it kid-friendly.  I will make these again FOR SURE.

It was such a good recipe, and not so difficult. But I had to add about a tablespoon of cornstarch into the sauce because it was too watery. I browned the wings in olive oil,no butter, to cut down on the fat, and I did not use the MSG, and used powdered ginger because I didn't have any fresh ginger. Soooo good. My son loved them and he is picky about his wings!

This recipe is a favorite. I just bake the wings plain and add the wings and cooked sauce into a fry pan for 3 to 5 minutes or so tossing them to coat well. Lower cal that way

I made these for FIGHT NIGHT when we watched the boxing match. I made 5 pounds and they were gone in an instant! Everyone raved that they were the best wings they ever had. We had the best sticky wings in Puerto Vallarta so this recipe comes close.

I didn't add the MSG, used about 1/2 bottle of hot wing sauce instead of the peppers. My husband and I were absolutely in heaven eating these.

Needed to make several heat ranges of wings and this one was perfect. It did take a little longer to reduce the sauce down but that just meant the flavor was better.

Very tasty, my family just loved it. I replaced the wings with chicken breasts  and the eggs with a mix of 03 TBSP Apple Vinegar and 1/8 TSP Baking Soda.

I'm ashamed to say I'm just now reviewing this after a couple years of using this recipe as one of my favorite recipes over and over and over over!! These wings are awesome. Everyone loves them! The only thing I changed was I used siracha sauce instead of the peppers. It's easier and tastes amazing. Great recipe.
