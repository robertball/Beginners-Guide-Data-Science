These really were surprisingly delicious, and so easy!  I changed it a little bit to make it even easier.  First, I lined the baking sheet with parchment paper (so cleanup was a breeze).  Also, rather than sprinkle the blueberries, and then the powdered sugar before rolling it up, I just tossed them both together before placing them on the croissants.  Make sure you seal it really well, otherwise the filling will leak.  These were really good right out of the oven... and I'm sure they'll also be wonderful for breakfast tomorrow!

For such a simple recipe I could not believe just how good these taste.  I made them this morning to serve at a coffee morning and book exchange I was hosting and everyone loved them and wanted more, more, more.  I used two cartons of dough.  Rolled each crescent in a ball and then rolled in a small oval with my rolling pin, I wet the edges and filled with the blueberries and sugar which I had already mixed together.  Made sure the edges were very well sealed to save the blueberries leaking and baked on a large Pampered Chef stoneware bar pan.  Once they were cooled I piped with vanilla frosting and a dusting of conf. sugar.  Delicious, I will me trying these will all manor of fillings...

YAY! I'm very kitchen challenged but my inlaws gave me 2 pints of blueberries to do something with and I needed fast and easy! This was perfect and plate licking good! I am sugar sensitive so I substituted honey inside and sprinkled some ground flax and cinnamon too- then after they baked I put a drop of honey on each and more cinnamon. YUMMY!

Hardly what I would call a turnover.  My husband is a big connoisseur of turnovers and admitted they tasted like dinner rolls filled with blueberries.
Turnovers are supposed to be big and flaky. Next time I'll try making them with puff pastry dough.
Sorry, but quite frankly, I don't see this recipe falling anywhere close to the 4 & 5 star ratings.

I'm rating this a five-star recipe because it is SO easy to prepare and still delicious!  My husband really loved this recipe.  I think that I personally prefer to use puffed pastry for turnovers, but this recipe is perfect if you don't have a lot of time but want to create an impressive brunch treat or dessert.  I made a buttercream icing and drizzled it on top.  Simple, easy, and delicious, and a fun project to do with my daughter!

Five stars for an easy recipe using crescent rolls.  If you expect a top of the line pastry, dont bake with crescent rolls!

I used canned Blueberry pie filling instead of berries and sugar. I also used warmed vanilla frosting to drizzle on top. My family is in LOVE with this great recipe, good thing it is easy!! Thanks for posting this.

Considering how easy these were and how quickly they disappeared from the breakfast table, they definitely deserve a 5 star rating.  Everyone loved these and we will be having again, and may even try different fillings.

Excellent recipe, the only problem is how addictive they are! I drizzled an almond glaze over them (icing sugar, milk, almond extract).

OK, So I had Easter morning house guests and crescent rolls. Saw this recipe and substituted chopped fresh strawberries and mini choc chips. No frosting, just a dusting of granulated sugar. They were excellent, but not close to the recipe posted her. If I had blueberries I would have tried that.

I used more sugar than called for but didn't measure and it worked perfectly! I have very tart and juicy organic blueberries though. I also added a couple pinches of nutmeg and a teaspoon or two of cinnamon. No measurements since I made these with a couple of toddlers :). After they cooked, we made a creamy topping of butter, powdered sugar, and Tahitian vanilla paste. They were so good that the two boys (Ages 2 and 5) were trying to steal one anothers' rolls because they had eaten the whole pan full! The 5 year old kept saying "They are even yummier with the sauce on them!" needless to say, these will be made again:) They are super easy, very kid-friendly, and a quick make, bake, and cleanup. Not to mention, Beautiful! we dusted the tops of them with cinnamon for looks and it was incredible! Can't approve this recipe enough!!!!

What a PIA and a giant mess!  I worked so hard to make each one just right and seal up all the edges well.  It looked like I had poured blueberry syrup all over it when it was done.  The flavor was lacking too.  I'm glad so many people have had a better experience than I did!  I won't make it again though.

I was hoping this would somehow taste better than blueberry mush inside a crescent roll, but it didn't. It was fairly simple, though.

Dreamy sighs - these were absolutely wonderful!  I used frozen berries (simply rinsed to soften) tossed with the powdered sugar.  Once done, we topped with leftover berries, some blueberry syrup (from AR), and home made whipped cream.  To die for!

I was skeptical on how these would turn out, since the recipe is so easy. WOW! They came out great! I used fresh blueberries, and instead of topping with frosting I served with ice cream.

I thought these were very good!  I followed directions and then made a drizzle by adding half and half to powdered sugar - instead of the prepared frosting - quick and a very tasty way to use fresh blueberries - Thanks!

It's a very yummy and easy breakfast pastry. Like the others noticed, if you don't seal the pastry enough, it will leak out, but that didn't make it any less delicious. And like many others, I changed it to suit me. I used granulated sugar because it's what I had, and when it was done, I brushed it with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon, not the cinnamon sugar mix, just plain cinnamon. And I added whipped cream because I didn't have vanilla frosting. Definitely a keeper!

so I grow my own blueberries and they are very tart. I tried a couple of versions of this and have found that for me the best is to cook the blueberries first with enough sugar to sweeten them adequately. When I just used blueberries straight with the sugar on top they always fell out. This way it is really easy to roll up and is so much more consistent on taste and texture. I also loved the other reviewer's idea of adding some cream cheese so I spread a little whipped cream cheese on the dough before adding the blueberries. Cook as directed and drizzle some confectioners sugar icing on top when they are done. Out of this world delicious!! I will be making it as long as my blueberries last!!

What a good idea! This deserves five stars for as fast and simple it is and tastes good besides! I used cinnamon and sugar on the berries, then sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top. I also want to try spreading cream cheese and jam instead of the berries before rolling up sometime.  Great with brunch.

Pretty good for a quick and easy treat if you have some fresh blueberries.  Not flaky and dough is not sweet, but not bad.

Made these this morning, they were absolutely delicious.  The only issue I had was putting them together, eventually I did it and they pretty much didn't over flow.  So they weren't a mess. Made a vanilla glaze, yummy!!!  Will make again real soon.

I love the ease of this recipe. Mine doesn't look like the photo, but then again,I used cream cheese frosting because I had leftovers in the fridge, and I like it better, so I just smooth it on like buttah. :)  Their juices oozed out of the crescents onto the baking sheet, but no matter, they tasted great.  Thanks so much. My g-daughter thanks you too.

Quick and easy.  But nothing compared to truly homemade.  My husband, who detests blueberries, actually liked them.  But my kids took a bite and turned up their noses--a "cheap", less tasty version of toaster strudels, according to them.  They're okay, but would be MUCH better if you go through the little trouble of making pie crust from scratch or something like that instead of the packaged refrigerated dough.

The turnovers were very sweet. I think I will reduce the amount of powdered sugar the next time I try these. I liked the ideas the reviewers had on using other fruits too. Some reviewers suggested using canned pie filling when fruits aren't so plentiful. Good idea.

So simple, really great! Fixed them just as the recipe said. Then mixed a little butter, vanilla, confectioners sugar and  milk for the icing and had a great midnight snack for guests.  An awesome no muss, no fuss recipe.

These are amazingly simple and yummy.  My husband is a blueberry fanatic, and absolutely loves these little things.  They're also perfect for overnight guests because of the minimal preparation and cook time involved. Will be coming back to this recipe again and again.

This is a great simple recipe/idea. Like the reviews suggested, I also simply mixed the blueberries with the sugar in a bowl instead of adding them separately to the dough. If you pack too many blueberries in, it does leak out and can make the pastry soggy. It's definitely important to seal the pastry well before baking! I've used other fruits with this too, but a real favorite was Nutella :). Thanks for the recipe!

Super duper simple. I don't know why I can't seem to get my little triangles folded up nice and neat and pretty like other cooks, but crescent rolls are sort of my nemesis in the kitchen. This time was no exception as the rolls popped open as soon as I got the paper off one side and they came apart in the tube, so I started with a mess. I managed to get them all out in as much of 1 piece as it would but they sure aren't pretty. Good thing my family cares more about flavor than appearances. I drizzled these with a homemade vanilla glaze. My hubby was most impressed with these gems so it was worth the struggle with the crescent dough. I'd make this again even wrestling with the pesky roll dough.

These are awesome!!  My kids loved them!  I made the blueberry, then ran out of berries.  Then, I tried bananas and they were even better!!  We also sprinkled with 1/2 pack of stevia instead of sugar.  YUMMM!

These are really fantastic! So easy to make and very yummy! I made my own butter cream frosting and used a plastic bag to drizzle and it was the perfect combo! I am sure these will become a staple treat in our house. Could also be great for a brunch treat.

Used this for inspiration. I had blueberries in the freezer and a can of crescent rolls in the fridge to use up. So I simmered the berries on the stove with a bit of sugar and cinnamon and thickened with a small amount of cornstarch. Let it cool in the fridge. Used about 1/2 or so for the pastries. Rolled out the pastry and cut them into rectangles  rather than triangles pressing them together.and flattening where necessary  spread a tsp of softened cream cheese that I heated up in the microwave so it would spread nice over half of each piece. Topped with 1 TB of cold blueberry filling and folded the pieces over top and pressed all edges really good. Put on ungreased cookie sheet and baked for 12 minutes. Piped a thin frosting of creamed cheese, icing sugar and cream in a zig zag pattern over each once they cooled a bit. delicious! Nice inexpensive quick and easy dessert. Not master chef worthy for sure, but cheap and easy and tasty. These would be good wrapped up to put in lunches as well. :)

I did not like these at all.  I've used puff pastry instead of homemade pie dough, and that was really excellent, but the crescent roll dough just didn't work for me.  It's the wrong texture, it doesn't taste right, and it was a waste of fresh berries.  I ended up throwing them away, and my family definitely has a sweet tooth.  A shame, but at least I tried.

Incredible!  The exact amount of berries for just that many crescent rolls. I got up early and made a double batch for my husband to take to work. Figured it looked straightforward and I would chance a new recipe. I used someone else's idea to stir the powdered sugar into the berries instead of doing it individually. Used parchment paper.  Could have skipped the powdered sugar topping since I was drizzling with frosting. They taste just like blueberry donuts. The guys went nuts over them!

This recipe is so easy and amazing! I wouldn't really call it a turnover though. For more flakiness you'd want to use puff pastry. I've made this recipe 5 times so far, and my friends and family love it!

Really easy and delicious! I modified it slightly, mixing 2 cups of blueberries with approximately 2/3 c of powdered sugar before placing them in the crescent roll dough. I also used dough sheets and made them into rectangles instead of triangles.

Absolutely perfect little gems!  I used a heaping tsp of powdered sugar inside and baked them on a Pam sprayed sheet pan.  I made an icing of powdered sugar, milk and vanilla and covered the warm turnovers.  This was perfect for a weekend breakfast.  I would have never thought of this, I'm so glad I found this recipe.

I must make these more often! Super easy and quick! From start to finish, I was able to prepare, bake, cool, and decorate using Shiny Cookie Icing. 10 yo daughter ate 4 so I'll double the recipe next time.

We loved these! I added a little more sugar than it called for and a little honey and brushed the top with honey. They were yummy! Really easy. I used frozen blueberries and let them stay in a few more mins. I will be making these again!

Quick and easy breakfast treat - I missed the flakiness of traditional pastry you would have with a turnover, but can't complain with how tasty, and easy these were!

I was kind of skeptical of these but I ended up loving them! I put a layer of cream cheese on the croissants before I added the blueberries coated in the confectioners sugar and it was a good decision because it gave it extra flavoring! Definitely will make these again!

Needed something fast.  This was super fast and super easy.  I used confectionary sugar and lemon juice to frost on the top.  Definitely a keeper!

I patched two crescents together to make a rectangle and thus 4 turnovers.  Yes, they were not puffed pastry but the company thought they were great.  Used cake icing from the tube on top with conf sugar.

Made these last night. They were oh so good! And so simple to make! I used fresh blueberries I had in the fridge! Even though the recipe says vanilla frosting optional, I recommend a homemade vanilla glaze! Made one I found on this website and it made the turnovers even better! Will definitely make these again and again! :)

I've made these twice. Everyone loves them. I use the bigger crescent rolls so I can add more blueberries. Also use a vanilla glaze recipe I found on this site. :-)

I love this recipe. Every year I go blueberry picking and end up with 15 to 20 lbs of fresh blueberries. This recipe is always in my rotation. It is quick, easy and a crowd pleaser. I often get asked for the recipe and people are always amazed at the simplicity of it.

These were tasty though not really my thing. I found it a small pain to get the crescent to come together. I would make these on parchment paper as several came open and I have to clean cooked blueberries off my pan. I am giving this 3 stars instead of 4 because of my own preference. My hubby ate quite a few of these.

These were good and easy.  My blueberries were a little on the tart side, however, so I'm sure they'd be better if the blueberries had been sweeter.

I bake desserts for our family-owned restaurant and these were a huge HIT! I glazed them in a powdered sugar/water glaze and decorated the tops with buttercream.
