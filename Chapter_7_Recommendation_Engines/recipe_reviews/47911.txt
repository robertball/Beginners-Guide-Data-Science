This is an excellent recipe. The chicken was flavoursome and tender and the toasted almonds added a wonderful texture. I used a high quality dijon mustard which I think this dish needs in order to produce the wonderful flavour. Thank you for sharing Jessica!

I make a very similar recipe in a pan with a few changes. Add soy sauce and garlic salt to the marinade. Plus, I use olive oil, which is healthier.

Very good recipe!  I marinated the chicken 8 hours before cooking.  It is a very light flavor of marinade.  If you are looking for something strong, this is not it.  But I found the combination of the marinade & the crunchy almonds to be very delicious.  The flavors are so different, but really complement each other.  Cook time is longer than recipe states, though.

Great fresh summer fun.  I tripled the mustard and honey and added 2 tbs worsteshire and 3 cloves fresh/crushed garlic.  My neighbors are asking for the recipe.

Great recipe!  I came searching back tonight to find it.  My husband and my daughter loved it too. Very easy to make and it tasted like I spent a lot more time on it.  We eat gluten-free and this recipe worked well for us.  Thanks!

A great little dish. No need to put it on the skewers unless you are using this as a side dish.  It needed triple of the marinade in my opinion. Very easy to make and will surely make again.

These really are tasty, and the almonds add a nice crunch. I served them with rice and tahini.

I followed another reviewer's advice and added a Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and a bit of minced garlic, and these tasted very good! I base my rating on this small change.

I do agree that while the flavor was delicious, it was a little on the weak side, and my chicken marinated overnight, so next time I want to make double the sauce and put aside about a half cup to a cup so I can brush the kabobs right before serving to give them that extra flavor.

I also wound up having to bake these on a roasting rack since our grill was feeling out of spirits, but they still came out tender and juicy! Very good!

This is good stuff! Very easy to make. Make sure you marinate your chicken for at least 4 hours. I also recommend a full cup of finely chopped almonds. I don't like the idea of basting with something the chicken marinated in so I made a separate batch for the basting for safety reasons.

Everyone loved this dish. I even forgot to roll the kabobs in almonds and it was still a keeper. served over fried rice with grilled corn. Marinated several hours and followed the recipe for a great result.

These were delightful!  Easy to make, and very tender with a light, tangy flavor.  I also grilled up some veggies, and put everything over rice.

I marinaded the chicken for about 4 hours, but it could have done with a good while longer. The flavor was a bit too mild for us, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. Thanks!

my family LOVED this recipe! will definitely make again...i brushed the marinade on continuously throughout the cooking process though since other reviews suggested to do it...and the flavor came out amazing! Also, instead of using just regular almonds, i used honey roasted and salted ones...that made the flavor kick! thanks so much!

I really liked this recipe but made a few changes.

I served this as a main dish so I cut the chicken into large chunks.

I marinated the chicken chunks in the fridge for a whole day because I forgot to make it that night. The tangy taste permeated the chunks. 

Then I skewered them on metal kabobs and I cooked them for 10 minutes on medium on the grill but they came out too dry. I would suggest cooking them for a shorter period of time.

My family really liked them and want me to make it again for them.

These were so yummy! I made them (among other things) to bring to my friend's anniversary cookout, and they were gone in no time. It was mild, sweet, tangy, and perfect. I also cut up bell pepper to slide on the skewers, brushed them with a little marinade and they were good too. Will definately be making again!

I found the chicken rather tasteless even though I marinated it for 5 hours.  The toasted almonds were a nice touch, though.  They added good flavour to the chicken.  Otherwise, I would have considered it a flop.

Slightly disappointed.  The flavor was just okay.  As many have mentioned, it is not a very strong flavor, but what you could taste was not superb.  If you want to jazz up some chicken for use in something else where a strongly flavored chicken is unnecessary and could detract from the dish, as one reviewer mentioned in a salad for example, this would be a great chicken.  I doubt that I will make this again unless it is for such a purpose.

Very good!  I added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and a couple cloves of crushed garlic to the marinade.  It reminded me of foil chicken at Chinese food restaurants!

Hubby liked them, but they didn't turn out so well because it was raining our grill didn't get hot enough.  But I took them into the broiler and they finished up ok, but they got a bit dry from the grill.  I think they will be better next time with only one cooking method:)

this was good, didn't have time to marinate it for a full hour but did for about 1/2 hour.  Rather then cube the chicken, I cut the chicken into strips and cooked it on the indoor grill.

cooked twice now and they are awesome.  We discovered the almonds didn't stick, and gray on a stick wasn't appealing so we modified the second time.  We add pineapple between the chicken.  Then we added about a 1/8 of cup of pineapple juice to the almonds.  They stuck on and this was so delicious.  Next time we are going to make some type of pineapple sauce/salsa to dip them in.

Nice flavor but I would consider just grilling the whole breast instead of putting on skewers.  Came out a little dry.

I found this very boring, marinated all day, nothing tangy about it, if it weren't grilled would have tasted just like plain chicken, almonds add very little except crunch factor. Would not make again.

The recipe sounded foolproof but I found the flavor light and overall boring....I won't make this again.
