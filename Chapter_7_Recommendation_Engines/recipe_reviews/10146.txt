I love these. I have lots of lemons to use up, so I am trying different cookies. After reading reviews, I was just a bit worried about taste; I really wanted very lemony cookies. I used one cup of butter, because I never use shortening/margarine. I added 2 oz of squeezed lemon juice. I added 1/8 cup of sugar (prb didn't really need) and an extra 1/4 cup flour, altho I could have probably added more flour to make it a bit firmer. I was worried about too floury of a taste. Chilling the dough for about 45mins in the refrigerator firmed it enough that I could roll it in my hands. It does not flatten though, so if you want a a cookie and not a ball, you will have to flatten yourself. I baked at 365 degrees after the first batch was just a little too brown on the edges. For 10 minutes exactly. Total lemon fix! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

On their own, these cookies were a failure. I iced them with the lemon cream cheese frosting on this website (see link on recipe page) which is incredible. It gave a much-needed flavor boost and made the cookies tolerably moist for the first day. The frosting was good enough to raise these to a 3 star rating. However, the texture of the cookies in this recipe is extremely dry and crumbly. After only 2 days, they were so dry as to be almost inedible. My advice is to save the lemon cream cheese frosting recipe and apply it on some better lemon cookies. I will not make this recipe again, as it was a disappointment.

Quick and easy recipe!  All my co-workers loved these cookies!! I now have the recipe memorized I make them so much.  I added a little extra lemon zest in the last batch and they were much more flavorful.  Highly recommended!

These tasted okay, but didn't make even close to 48 like the recipe said.  You do need to flatten the dough before baking or you will have balls instead of cookies.  I only had to bake them for 7 minutes or they would've burned.  The frosting definitely is a nice compliment to these.  They wouldn't be near as good without.  But the finished product was good!

I'm glad that I read previous reviews before I made these cookies. I doubled the zest and added fresh lemon juice. They are still very light. Instead of the frosting, I glazed them with a powdered sugar and fresh lemon juice glaze. It gave them a little bit of a sour kick when you first put them in your mouth. I would also use a cookie press next time to make them look nicer since they don't spread out.

Good overall, however, without frosting they have a really light flavor.  I actually added a little bit of lemon juice and it seemed to help.  It's a personal preference thing . . .

These were quick and easy to make.  They were not quite lemony enough for me, so I added a teaspoon or so of lemon extract to the frosting. I was optimistic enough to try them out the first time to take to a party, and they were a success.  I will use this recipe again.

These were a hit. I was looking for a good lemon cookie. I also added a little lemon extract into the icing.

Only a small hint of lemon & extremely dry. Added fresh lemon juice like others mentioned - won't be making these "drops" again.

pretty good , the link for the frosting doesn't work so I used a recipe for icing which ultimately ruined the cookie because it was too runny.

These were good frosted with the lemon cream cheese frosting.  I little dry, so they need the frosting. I don't think they would have been as good plain.

These cookies, iced with the lemon cream cheese frosting are wonderful.  The cookies are crumbly, however, and my son felt the cookies and the icing were a mismatch on weight.  Although he's right, they are still great!

These were amazing.  I was a little unsure considering they have no eggs etc.  I added 1/2 tsp of lemon extract to intensify the flavor and topped with a lemon buttercream frosting.  I can't stop eating them!

Cookies had a light and airy texture, a little dry, but the icing made up for the dryness.

Fantastic. I made these 2 times and they are awesome. I added 1 tbs of lemon juice and topped it off with a lemon glaze, not buttercream frosting.

I used 4 tablespoons of lemon zest and added 1 tablespoon of lemon extract because I like zippy lemon flavor. I also sprinkled them with sugar straight out of the oven instead of icing them.

On their own, these are a nice, but rather plain butter cookie with a slight lemon taste, nothing special.  The lemon cream cheese icing does give a big boost, though, and makes these worth making.  This opinion was based on following the recipes exactly, which I always do the first time making something.

i've read that confectioner's sugar isn't technically vegan because of the processing. but you can make your own using pure cane sugar and a little corn starch in a blender or cuisinart.

My husband favors desserts with lemon in them and likes these cookies very much.  They really do have the flavor of lemon drops too!
