I made some slight modifications because I did not have oregano or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. I just used Parmesan grated cheese instead. Also I only used one medium size zucchini instead of two small ones. Tasted GREAT!!

This recipe is badly flawed, although with the following steps you can make it delicious. First break off the ends of all the asparagus before cutting in fine rounds. Then use ONLY 1/4 of a box of veggie pasta. Use ONLY 3/4 cup of the cooking water, and simmer the zucchini and asparagus until they are fork tender. Add the drained pasta and toss with ONLY 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese.

The parmesan cheese melted into a single clump as I stirred and much of what little vegetables there were, got caught up in the ball of cheese.  I really liked the fresh oregano in the recipe though ~ that added a nice flavor.  The veges were good too, just need to triple the amount.

This pasta was very tasty. It's light and perfect with a side of spinach. The only thing I changed was adding about a teaspoon and a half of butter when the vegetables were simmering with the pasta water. This made the actual sauce of the pasta a little thicker and added some flavor. I also ended up adding more pepper once the pasta was done. The parmesean cheese is a delicious last addition to top off a light, savory pasta dish.

Liked this for meatless option. Added some chopped yellow peppers to add some spice, lots of options you could use with this recipe.

I used Pecorino Romano .  It is delicious and cheese is reasonable.

This was excellent!  I used a basil pesto 3tbsp vs olive oil & only added 1/4 cup of pasta water.  This was very good with zucchini.
