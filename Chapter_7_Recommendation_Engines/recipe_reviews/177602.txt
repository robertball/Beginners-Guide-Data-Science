This soup was delicious!  I used homemade seafood stock instead of the chicken broth.  I also added some leftover bay scallops and shrimp (cut into pieces).  Will definitely make this again! Everyone loved it!

I made this much easier and quicker subsituting 1-1/2 cans diced potatoes for red potatoes,  2 cans fiesta corn (drained) instead of frozen corn.  We like our chowder not as runny, so I only used 4 cups broth.  For seasoning I used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning.  2 tsp made it a little salty, so maybe next time I'll use only 1 or 1 and 1/2 tsp.  It was quick and done in 20 minutes.

My three picky eaters and I loved this chowder.  We have had it many times, I make it exactly as stated. This is a winner in our house.
