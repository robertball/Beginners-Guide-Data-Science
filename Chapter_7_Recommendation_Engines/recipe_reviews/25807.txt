I used 2 cup zuchinni, 1/2 cup butter, and 2 1/8 cup flour like a previous reader suggested and they were AMAZING! HOWEVER!, I highly recommend using the fine grate on your grater, I used the regular size and it didnt look appetizing.  I told my daughter it was apple shreds or else she wouldnt have tried it and she love it.  I have left over frozen shredded zucchinni that i wil put in my chopper to make small for the next batch.  These will be a regular cookie for us.  Thank you!

I have made these cookies twice because the first time they disappeared faster than expected.  Fabulous!!  The cookies were so moist and tasty!  Second time I added chocolate chips.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

These cookies are so good! Soft, cake-like, delicate flavor. I used butter instead of shortening, and grated a yellow summer squash that had grown too big. It was a gamble, but it worked out well. If you use a soft summer squash other than zucchini, be sure to grate only the solid part of the squash, not the skin or seed pulp area. I will definitely make this recipe again, and add it to my collection of "What to Make With Zucchini" recipes!

Just finished the first batch - these are fantastically delicious cookies! Mine turned out kinda funny-looking, but they taste wonderful. I took the advice of other reviewers and added about a cup of chocolate chips. I highly recommend that! Also, I didn't have butter-flavored shortening, but I do have butter popcorn salt. So I used regular shortening, and substituted my butter-flavored popcorn salt for the regular salt. Worked fine.

I used 1/2 c butter instead of shortening. After tasting the end result of using 1 t baking soda, I think I would use 1/4 or 1/2 t instead next time. The cookies are tasty -- I made some simple frosting and drizzled it over the top of the cookies.

A 5-star recipe!  Cookies and chocolate are my greatest weaknesses, so this recipe has it all.  I've been trying several new zucchini recipes lately to use up the seemingly never-ending supply coming out of my garden this year.  These cookies are so moist and delicious.  Mine puffed up nicely while baking and have a cake-like texture.  The only thing I added was some chopped pecans.  GREAT!

Wow, these are delicious. I used butter and 2 cups of zucchini, finely grated. Also added 1 cup of chocolate chips, per reviewer suggestions. They were perfectly baked in 8 minutes. The cookie is very moist and not overly sweet. We love them! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a yummy cake like cookie! I used butter substitute for the shortening, added about 1/4 cup more zucchini, and some chocolate chips. They are a little doughy right out of the oven and so good!

yum!  Chocolate that is halfway good for you!  I made a few minor changes.  I used 1 3/4 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of old fashioned oatmeal.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon because I think it helps bring out the chocolate flavor.   And I had to have walnuts, too.   I halved the baking soda as other reviewers suggested and the cookies were still fluffy and very cakey.  I think frosting would be an excellent addition, too, if you don't mind the fuss and extra calories.  I'll definitely make this again.

Very good.  Love the texture.  Tasted like chocolate cake.  To me it was lacking something in flavor, not sure what;)  But still very good.

Pretty good as cake-like cookies go! My zuchini was very moist (an unpeeled), but this wasn't a problem. It was easy to sneak half a cup of whole wheat flour in, too.

Just made a batch of these: YUM-O! What a great way to use up some zucchini! Only a few minor changes I made: added more cocoa powder, about a cup of milk chocolate chips, a cup of white chocolate chips and probably more like 2 cups of zucchini. I got 30 good sized cookies out of this recipe, they needed to bake longer than 10 minutes (more like 15 for me). I will save this recipe and definitely make again :)

love sneaking veggies into the kids.  I will experiment with these a bit to see if I can make them a little less cake-like (aka less crumb mess), but they were good.   Did take the idea of others and added a cup of choc chips.  I may try substituting apple sauce for the some/all the butter and see how that comes out.  THANKS!

OMGosh these are awesome! I substituted coconut oil for the butter and also used egg whites rather than a whole egg. I then added a bag of white chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup shredded coconut and also added 2 whole cups shredded zucchini. My kids are loving them so I am now on my way to pick up whole wheat flour to make another batch. Healthy and great for them!

I like zucchini and chocolate so I figured why not try this recipe. I didn't really like the texture of the final product.  The cookies didn't flatten and they were very doughy, like bread.  I really wanted to love this, but don't think I'll make again.  Thank you though.

I used butter also, rather than the shortening.  I did NOT drain the zucchini first, and grated it extra thin.  My consistancy was not good, too watery, so the cookies just spread out.  They tasted good, but looked ugly.  I am wondering if I shouldve gone with larger shreds of zucchini... maybe it was too watery/mushy but doing the fine grating... Hubby gave a 7.5 or 8.... I would try once more, as they did taste good, but would do the larger shreds.  8 mins perfect cook time.

Fantastic chocolate taste! Really do taste like a brownie as said above. I followed another suggestion and used butter instead of the shortening. I also added 1/2 cup toasted chopped pecans and 1/2 cup semi-sweet choc chips. Deelish!!

These are really good.  My zucchini had been frozen and was still cold, so I baked them for 15 minutes.  I also added a cup of chocolate chips.  I was a little nervous about their appearance before they baked, but afterwards the sticking out shreds don't look so green!  I got 3 dozen plus one from the recipe and they didn't spread.  I did squeeze the excess water from the zucchini before mixing.

I doubled the recipe (had lots of zucchini to use up) and used butter instead of shortening (I don't own shortening), and added chocolate chips.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  The dough was VERY stiff until the zucchini was "folded" in (my heavy-duty mixer did it for me), and then it was quite gooey.  When my cookies baked, they spread out and smoothed out a bit more than I expect drop cookies to.  I love dark chocolate, but these seemed to have too much unsweetened cocoa powder, which made them a bit "unsweet."  Thank goodness for the chocolate chips, which gave a bite of sweetness every once in awhile.  Even cream cheese frosting on top didn't do much for these.  I won't be making these again--I'd rather save my cocoa and butter (and even zucchini) for something else.

These were absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any unsweetened cocoa, so I use a package of Irish Hot Cocoa mix.  I also added chocolate chips.  These were better than any chocolate chip cookie i've ever had.  I did have to cook them for about 15 minutes, but that may be because I made them a little bigger (used a pampered chef medium scoop)

one of my favorite cookies :) I like them because I freeze them before serving to give it that extra fudgy flavor and I also add a tablespoon of cinnamon to give it extra flavor.

I followed others advice and did 2 c of zucchini and added chocolate chips and 1/2 t cinnamon. These came out with the perfect amt of chocolate and cake like. If you want them 'fudgier' slightly undercook them. I tried using my stoneware pan and they needed much longer than 8-10 min to cook and were quite undercooked at that time frame. I would make these again!

Cake-like cookie with terrific flavor.  They were a little dry when I finished mixing them, but a little water mixed in helped.  I also increased the amount of zucchini, used half white and half whole wheat flour and added Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips - yum!!  An absolute must!  You could make these without the zucchini, too, I would think and it wouldn't change it other than take some of the healthiness away :)

My husband took one bite and called these "the BEST cookies ever." Moist and yummy, my three-year-old gobbled them up without even noticing the zucchini.   I took the advice of another reviewer and added a cup of chocolate chips. I found the batter was really dry, so before adding the zucchini, I added an extra egg and it seemed to do the trick perfectly.

Pretty tasty... almost cake-like... I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening, added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips, 1 tbsp ground flax seed, and 1/2 cup of walnuts...

I made these this morning for my son's  landscaping crew and one of them said "it tastes like chocolate cake" and another said "Tastes like chocolate muffins" and all of them liked them.  I did use chocolate chips and some I added nuts to.  I am having a hard time staying out of them myself!

Super duper recipe!  Before the first batch was even out of the oven, I was mixing up another batch.  The cookies are so moist and tasty.  My husband said they taste like brownies.  My boys gobbled them down.  And I will make this my new "go-to" cookie recipe!  Like some of the other reviewers, I used butter instead of shortening and 2 c. zucchini.  Delicous!

My kid's love zucchini so I'm always looking for new recipes. They really liked this one, but said they really couldn't taste the zucchini. So if you have a tough time getting people to try it this is a good recipe to use. Just grate the zucchini smaller.

Yum!  So good.  When I was done mixing my dough was very dry, so I added an extra egg and then spread it out in a 9 by 13.  Came out like a cross between a cake and brownies, such a tasty after school snack!

These are pretty good. I doubled the recipe and added an extra egg, 1 t cinnamon and 2 oz melted bittersweet chocolate. They are nice and moist but there is something missing in the flavor. It's a recipe I'll keep and keep working on.

These came out very soft and moist, great texture and very chocolatey. I am a choco-holic, so I added 1 cup of Semi Sweet Chocolate Mini Morsels and that added a nice fudgieness.
The cookies I got were huge and went over really well. This recipe is a keeper.

I doubled the recipe and used half applesauce and half butter flavor shortening.  It worked well!  I took the suggestion of others and added chocolate chips.  And I added shelled sunflower seeds.  They added a good texture.

Very good way to sneak in some veggies. Changes I made to make it healthier and tastier: Used half zevia and sugar with squeeze of molasses, replaced 1/2 cup of flour with instant oatmeal, replaced another 1/4 of a cup with white whole wheat flour, used a whole zucchini (around 2 1/2 cups that I shredded and then briefly pulsed in the food processor), doubled the amount of cocoa powder, added 1/4 tsp of instant coffee powder, added 3/4 cup of semisweet and 1/4 cup of white chocolate chips (made the kids think that anything "weird" in the cookies were just the white chocolate). I would have replaced out some of the butter for apple sauce, but I forgot! 

Really tasty as a breakfast cookie - my kids thought that they were getting an EXTRA special treat!

3stars as is... My family liked them but said they were not sweet enough. Chocolate chips did the trick! Very light and cakey. Next time I might consider grating the zucchini finer just for looks. Very good though w small changes. Yes I would make again.. I must also say day 2 they are even better! Moist, soft, cakey! Not too sweet and sugary! Wow! I will make again...today!

I tried this tonight and I loved these cookies. I made a few adjustments to make them healthier. I substituted 1/2 cup greek yogurt for the butter, 1/4 honey for the brown sugar and white sugar, and omitted the salt. I added a few squares of milk chocolate and a bit more cocoa powder. I will definitely be making these again. Excellent!!

These were great!  So moist and you couldn't tell there was zucchini inside (I used the smaller grater and removed the skin to help disguise them per others comments).  I added choc. chips also and then called them "chocolate, chocolate chip cookies" to my children.  Our two young children (5&7) loved them!

Not for me.  Mine look prettier than the photo because I used a cookie scoop, but the end result is a bit...strange tasting.  Mostly because of the chocolate.  Maybe I'm a picky chocolate eater and maybe I just don't like cocoa powder (I LOVE chocolate pudding, Hershey's, etc though).

I substituted 1 cup of white flour for whole wheat. I left out the cocoa and added chocolate chips. They turned out very good, but the zucchini taste is very abundant, more so I think than normal zucchini bread! The are more of a cakey cookey (softer, thicker, and fluffier) than some other cookies I've made.

Loved these! They were cakey and spongy but that was ok for me!! I added chocolate chunks.  ADD THE CHOCOLATE makes a world of difference! I had never tried these and was a little skeptical but they were actually really great and my fiance loved them because they werent too sweet!   Will make again!

Soooo good!  I hope we don't eat them all before the kids get a chance to try them!  I used 1/2 stick butter, 1/8 cup lighter bake, 2 cups zucchini and added white chocolate chip cookies.  Yum! Extra good still warm from the oven.

I thought that this recipe does better as a cake. I too changed the shortening to butter, added chocolate chips and grated the zucchini fine so the kids wouldn't fuss. I tried the cookies and they were awesome but they came out flat so i baked the rest of the batter in a bunt pan. besides that great zucchini recipe!

Loved these! I added about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips and used about 2 cups zucchini (squeezed dry) & they are excellent. This is a soft cookie but tastes delicious!

These cookies were so tasty!! I really liked the flavor. The only thing I didn't like was when I added the zucchini it went a little runny. After cooking a batch I just added more flour until I got the consistancy that I liked. Way yummy recipe and I will make them again. They went quickly... which is a good sign!!

The dough seemed very dry and crumbly and then when the zucchini was added it became very sticky.  They tasted alright, I cooked them a couple minutes longer than called for.  I can't tell if they are supposed to be soft or if they are under baked but they tasted doughy in some areas.  I don't think I will be making these again

These cookies were ok, I think that I was expecting more instead of a pure chocolate taste, but my mother loved them and wants the recipe!  They'll make the rounds at her home!  Thank you!

These cookies are fantastic!  I added one cup of chocolate chips as suggested by another reader.  Can't wait to share this new recipe with my family and friends  The only problem I see is that I want to eat them all myself.

I love these. They are very good. I didn't have any problem with them being too moist. they are perfect. I used butter instead of shortning and added chocolate chips. I made a bigger size cookie i think then the recipe calls for because i only got about 26 cookies out of these, so if you are looking to make more, double the recipe.

These were extremely moist, but great! Too moist I think for these to be any good tomorrow..The batter reminded me of cake batter so I added 2 TBS. skim milk and put these in a muffin tin..12 muffins cooked 14 min. at 350. These turned out better as muffins..Thank you for posting this recipe...It gave me something else besides bread to bake with the zuke's!!

I just made these for the first time and really like them.  I followed the recipe pretty closely and was happy with the sweetness.  They taste like little tiny chocolate cakes.  Great with a cold glass of milk!

Very good!  Almost a cake-like texture.  Loved it.  Didn't change a thing about the recipe either.  I will be making these for an upcoming vacation, however I will be doubling the recipe.

anyone who rated this poorly did something wrong or maybe it has something to do with the quality of the coca? I did add chocolate chips but this is a great recipe on its own! If you want to cut the fat, use egg whites only and use a banana instead of the butter, I also added some flax seed to up the nutritional value.

A yummy cake like cookie.  I did take readers advice and use 2 cups zucchini and I added 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I made a simple chocolate sugar glaze and drizzled over the top.  DELICIOUS.

These were a good soft, cakey cookie although a little bland.  I was a little concerned at first as the batter was extremely dry before putting in the zucchini, but after stirring the zucchini in for a while it became moist and was easy to drop.  Next time I would cook them a little longer as the middle was still a little undercooked and I would also use the small grater size rather than the big one.

These taste really good with the addition of chocolate chips. By accident used too much shortening so mine are pretty soft. To cut calories, I think it could use less than half cup of shortening and 2 cups of zucchini due to the moisture content of the zucchini.

I used a little more zucchini and about 1/8th of a cup of flour less than the recipe called for.  I also used a stick of real butter instead of shortening.

Mine turned out moist, cake-like and delicious with a nice buttery after taste.  

Great recipe!

The basic recipe is okay.  I should have read the reviews prior to trying the recipe.  Some white or dark chocolate chips would be a positive addition, pecans also.  The next time I try these, I will add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.

Excellent way to use extra zucchini from the garden.  No one would ever know these cookies contain zucchini.  I added white chips and walnuts to the dough.  They turned out moist and delicious.  I'll be making them again soon.  They would also be good with peanut butter chips.

The cookies were absolutely delicious. I used regular butter and 2 1/8 of a cup of flour per other reviews. The cookies were moist, sweet and well received by the whole family and quickly devoured. Will definitely make them again. Thank you for this great recipe.

These cookies are basically the only reason I grow zucchini in the summer! :) The trick is to pull them from the oven at just the right time--pay attention to when the bottoms of the cookies start to look a little crisp (it's hard to see when they are brown since the cookies are so dark in color), and when the tops have set with a little crust. They firm up as they cool. Don't pull them when the tops are still "wet"  (too gooey) or after the tops have hardened up completely (too hard). It takes a batch to see the exact right moment when they are done, but it's worth the careful watch! My whole family gobbles these up (and they don't even like zucchini!).

My batter was way too dry after completion, so I added another egg and a little (couple tablespoons) of milk. Produced a yummy cake-like cookie.

Great recipe! I upped the zucchini to two full cups, added a cup of chocolate chips, and reduced the baking soda a bit as suggested by others. They are wonderfully moist and chocolatey, and my husband said they are better than regular chocolate chip cookies. That’s noteworthy, because he’s a fussy eater! I also made a double batch and they turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

When I made the recipe as is, it was too dry. I added 1 cup applesauce and they were delicious!  More like cake than a cookie.  Thinking about adding some chocolate chips next time.

Delicious. Accidentally dentally doubled the butter but tripled everything else. If I'm making cookies, I made a bunch to share. They turned out great. I added one cup chocolate chips.

upon getting all of the mixing done the  texture was not right. It had not come together as a batter at all-just crumbly. I went back through and verified all of my ingredients and amounts. As an experienced baker,  I'm baffled. I ended up adding some yogurt and they seemed to come out OK afterwards.

After reading comments I went with 2 cups zukes, 1/2 cup butter, 1/3+cup cocoa, chocolate chips and a dash of cinnamon. A cross between a soft cookie and a brownie.  Excellent!

Unbelievably fluffy and moist. I used whole wheat flour and added about a cup of chocolate chips. A big success! My two boys loved them and didn't know there was zucchini hidden inside.

version 1-used half butter half oil, 3/4 cup white sugar, no brown sugar (was all out), and 2 cups of shredded zucchini, finely chopped. i did add about 1/2 cup choc chips.
version 2- This time i used half butter half oil, 1/4 white sugar, 1/2 cup unpacked brown sugar, all whole wheat pastry flour and 1/3 cup mini choc chips- delicious!. 
3rd version- half whole wheat flour half white, regular shortening, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar not packed, 2 cups zucchini forgot to chop it fine. still tasted good but had long strings of zucchini

Total crowd pleaser! Friends at a party last night were ready to market and start a business that's how good they are. There are a few tweaks I've made. I grate the zucchini on the small grate, then people don't even know there is zucchini in the cookies. Switched out the shortening for butter. Cut down the flour to two cups. Put 2 tsp of vanilla as well as two tsp of bourbon. Oh and to me cookies must always have chocolate chips so added those in as well.

I added a lot of mini semi-sweet choc chips just because chocolate always makes anything better.
Also, I didn't squeeze all of the liquid from the zucchini which helped to keep them moist.
The first batch I didn't bake as long however, they were baked through and it was like eating cookie dough, yum!
I did bake the others a couple of minutes longer for people that don't like dough.
Either way I would do these again.

I adjusted the cocoa and flour to 2/3 cup of cocoa powder and 1 3/4 cups of flour. I used 2 cups of zucchini. I added about a quarter cup of milk to smooth out the batter and threw in chocolate chips and pecans. They were supposed to be dessert and ended up as the appetizer!! Love, love, love them!!

Due to my higher altitude (6,300 ft.), I increased the flour to 2 1/4 cups, plus 1/8 cup. After the first batch, I sprinkled in more flour and will just use 2 1/2 cups at the beginning next time.  Also, due to my altitude, I decreased the baking soda to 1/2 teaspoon and took out about a half tablespoon of the white sugar from the original 1/2 cup measurement.  I only had unsalted butter, so I used a 1/2 cup of that instead of the 1/2 cup shortening.  I also added chocolate chips.  These were a hit and my kids didn't know they had zucchini in them!

It sounds like I changed a lot, but most were just high altitude adjustments.  If not for the altitude adjustments, the butter and chocolate chips would have been my only changes.  

One note on the batter is that it looked a little soft/almost runny, like it was going to just spread out like a pancake when it went in the oven, but to my surprise, it kept its cookie shape and puffed up while it baked.

On my second round I used 1.75 cup Zuchinni, 1/2 cup apple (both shredded), 1/2 cup butter, and 2 1/8 cup flour, 1 scoop of chocolate protein powder, and 1 cup dark chocolate chips. They came out pretty yummy, yet you don't want to binge on them :-)

These were excellent.  I used some frozen shredded zucchini and followed the recipe as is.  They turned out very cake-like and delicious.  They look a little weird with the large shreds of zucchini, but tasted great. Recipe said they'd make 48, but I only ended up with 21 and I don't think I made the drops very large.  Might add some mint to the next batch. Definitely will make these again!

These were very good and moist. I had to tell my kids that the zuccini was coconut in order for them to eat them though--lol. They were hard for my husband to take in his lunch since they fell apart so easily. More of a dessert for home, but I will probably make them again.

These cookies didn't have much flavor. I think they could use more sugar. Also, I had to add a little more shortening (about 1-2 tsp.) because they were too dry to hold a shape. I think I'll stick to my favorite  zucchini cake and bread recipes.

This was a tasteless cookie for us.  I made it for a group of church children and rescued these cookies by adding chocolate frosting.  I even added the extra shortening and egg and it was not moist.  Will not try this recipe again.

Wonderful, however,they tended to be a little dry and I felt that more butter/shortning could have improved the flavour. The second time I made these cookies I increased the butter to 3/4 cup and added an extra egg and they were much better. A great cookie, they freeze well and good for lunches.

These are yummy - so moist. Great way to use up all the extra zucchini. I used margarine.  I added chocolate chips.  I think next time I will include some pecans.  Very good - they won't last long at our house!

Would definately make again.  The cookies are moist and are like devils food cake cookies.
