I thought that something was off on this recipe, despite having wonderful components.  I would try again and not broil the prosciutto but add it after somehow.  It gets hard and salty and difficult to eat.

My girlfriend made this appetizer yesterday for our Christmas Party. I fell in love! The sweetness of the figs, the salt of the ham, and the nuts just made everything "pop". I will make this for my next dish for any party.

I used brie instead of cheddar and cut out the walnuts. I actually blended two similar recipes to get the desired flavor I wanted. I used thyme instead of rosemary but I think the rosemary does sound yummy.

Oh my word! I substituted gorgonzola piccante for the cheddar (just shaved a bit off the block with a vegetable peeler), and it was FAB-U-LOUS! You get the sweetness from the fig jam, the saltiness from the proscuitto, the nuttiness from the walnuts and the pungent flavor from the gorgonzola. It was the perfect little bite. Yummy!

I've made this numerous times and it's always a hit. For something a little different I've used crumbled blue cheese in place of cheddar.

This was excellent!!! I will say finding fig jam was hard and when I did it tasted like peach and at 7.25$ next time I will just use peach. I changed nothing. Will make this again!
