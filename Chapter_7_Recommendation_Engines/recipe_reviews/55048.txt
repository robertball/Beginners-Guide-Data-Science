Very good! I added lemon juice instead of lemonade concentrate and mixed in some plain greek yogurt to soften it a bit. I left it out with crackers at a party and there was none left at the end of the night!

Has a refreshing, unique flavor.  Extremely sagey - try this only if you love sage!! I think it would be best on slices of bread such as small baguette slices rather than crackers.

I made this as a teaser at a farmer's market where I was selling bunches of sage.  Everyone loved it!  It looked beautiful with a few sage blossoms and leaves on top.

This was really good but be prepared, it's a bit sweet because of the lemonade concentrate. Everyone who tried it liked the sage, garlic, sweet lemon combo. I found it to be at it's best about 15 minutes or so out of the fridge and it only got better the second day.

this was fantastic!  you really do have to love sage to love this recipe.  my husband and i both do so it worked well for us.  i served it over top of sausage patties...very, very good.  i only made a few small changes...used lemon juice because it was the only thing i had and i added just a bit of sour cream to thin it out a bit.  after making this i would imagine it would have been fine with just cream cheese hence the 5 star rating.  my husband commented that it would be good on just about everything!

This is very surprising. although I love sage.  I added this to some pasta and it was great, I just thinned the sauce out a little with some skim milk.

It's has a very pleasant flavor but I would only eat it in moderation. My foodie friend told me she would bake the leftovers into biscuits. I'm not sure how, but it sounds yummy!

I'm rating this a one not because the recipe didn't make up, but rather because it went over atrociously in this house.  

The lemonade was really hard to mix into the cream cheese, but once it was done the mixture had a great texture and spread easily even right out of the refrigerator.  

I have to say this was way too sweet.  Maybe if this was made with just lemon juice instead of lemonade...

We will not make this again.  The boyfriend wouldn't even touch it after the first bite.
