This is indeed great, especially for "something different".....it draws a lot of "oooh's" and "ahhh's", and people are impressed, yet it's SO EASY to make!!--one word of advice: you can use the refrigerated peanut butter cookie doughfor this---this is pretty much identical to a Pampered Chef recipe that uses the refrigerated cookie dough--only the sugar cookie dough--which, I've made it that way, too, and drew rave reviews, also--something to consider for the poster who thought the pb dough was too overpowering.....this one's a keeper! Also, in the Pampered Chef recipe, it mixes some sugar in with the cream cheese--about 1/3 cup sugar

Excellent SOMETHING DIFFERENT desert. I pulled this off the net and one day while making P/B cookies for the kids, remembered I had it. I just made my last cookie about 10 - 12 inch diameter and baked as usual, there was my Pizza crust. I also had to add a little butter and powder sugar to the cream cheese and make more of an icing ( the youngest ones are finicky about cream cheese ). 5 out of 5 kids and 1 dad recommend this one.

My wife made this for me and the guys at work.  It was a instant hit.  

She did use the refrigerated peanut butter dough instead of the mix, as it's quicker that way.

After watching her make this, I decided a complete amatuer like me could make this with great success.

Had a lot of fun making this.  I used the refrigerated peanut butter dough and just spread it out.  It worked perfectly.  Tip, lightly wet your fingers when spreading out the dough.
It was a hit with all my family and friends.

My husband loved this recipe!!  He is a soldier and was away in the field for two weeks.  I made this pie for his return.  He now expects one every week until he gets tired of it!  I altered the recipe by using approximately 3/4 of the cookie dough and lining a tin pie pan instead of a pizza pan.  Either way, this is an awesome dessert!  Thanks!

Delicious!!! I used Pillsbury peanut butter cookie dough and added about 1/3 cup of sugar to the cream cheese. It was a big hit! I will definitly be making this again.

I used the betty crocker peanut butter cookie mix and it was really salty and did not go well with the pudding.  I think the peanut butter cookie crust is way too overpowering for the rest of the recipe

This is DELICIOUS!  It tastes like a peanut butter chocolate cheesecake after it sits for a bit.  My husband almost cried when he tried it.  :o)

I thought this was a really good recipe. I did follow the suggestion of adding sugar to the cream cheese. I also had 2 snickers bars that I chopped up instead of using the choc chips. I think I will combine the pudding and whipped topping next time so I can taste more of the cream cheese. I did not think the cookie was overpowering but I did use the pre made kind you just scoop out.

This is really good. I used a pie pan and it turned out great. Next time I will use sugar cookie dough, I thought the peanut butter cookie dough over powered the chocolate but it was still great. It went fast!

This was very easy to assemble and my husband really liked it, and the bite I had tasted good too!  He really liked the peanut butter cookie crust.  Will make again!

Average at best. Was very simple and would be great for kids. The adults weren't too impressed.
