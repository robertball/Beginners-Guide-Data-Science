Amazing flavor. Authentic smokey flavor. Used honey to balance the bitterness the skins left and used guajillo and Padilla peppers.  Took 35 min and was well worth it.

I liked this one  better than the other one I tried forRed Enchilada Sauce on this website....more depth of flavor. I was lazy and just put everything in the crockpot to simmer while I was at work. Used half for enchiladas and the other half for the Enchilada Meatballs on this site that also needed the same sauce. I had just bought the agave nectar for another recipe so I was glad there was something else I could use it in.

Prepared this in a NO salt method.  Very good sauce.  As mentioned by another review, I used honey to balance the bitter.  Wasn't sure initially as to me enchilada sauce doesn't have a great taste by itself.  I made the slow-cooker Posole' from here and you could smell the effort and work that went into the sauce.  I doubled this recipe and I ended up canning 7 pints.

Love the authenticity. I used what I had and omitted what I didn't and it was still fantastic.  A keeper.

I loved the smokey, authentic flavor, but I had to play with it to get it to be really great.  In the future I'll use my homemade chicken stock instead of water.  (I actually cooked it down and added about a cup and a half of stock, and it made a huge difference to supplying those needed low and medium notes.)  I also had to add three times the amount of honey and twice the amount of lemon juice called for.  I used Pasilla Negro chiles instead of the ancho, because my grocery store didn't have ancho.  I also used two chipotle chiles canned in adobo sauce (Goya product) instead of the other chiles.  A couple extra spoonfuls of the adobo sauce really improved the flavor as well, supplying those missing lower notes.  I'll make this again, but will make sure to use the above changes to get a fuller flavor.

Truly authentic, I added some chicken broth to make enchiladas. I didn't use chili arbol, instead I used chipotle chilis that my husband made last summer. It's a great sauce!!
