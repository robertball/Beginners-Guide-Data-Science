I thought this was pretty good but my boyfriend absolutely loved it.  I took the advice from the reviews on Campbell's website and used Alfredo sauce w/bacon and canned diced tomatoes.  Had a little trouble getting the biscuits to cook on the bottom so next time I will bake them separately and then add them.
