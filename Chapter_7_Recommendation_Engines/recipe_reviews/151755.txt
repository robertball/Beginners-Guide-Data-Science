Delicious!  Very easy to make- the brownies were soft and the cheesecake layer was very tasty.  I melted chocolate chips and drizzled over the top, instead of the chocolate bars.  I also make it a day ahead and it was great.

Tasted great.  Uses a lot of cream cheese (I didn't read the recipe right and I had to run to the store to get more).  Would bake brownie for less time, was a bit too hard.

Really good recipe! I used Splenda instead of sugar and I didn't use quite the called for amount, so it was my own fault that the cheesecake wasn't quite sweet enough. Ah well, I know better for next time, because I will be making this easy dessert again.

This was delicious, but it had it's flaws. I baked it in a 10 inch spring form pan, as the one in the picture appears to have been. As far as flavor, it was perfect. The vanilla cheesecake was divine, and the chocolate brownie crust made it taste even better. However, I baked the brownie a few minutes longer than the recipe suggested, and it still ended up separating from the cheesecake and was completely mushy. I'm not sure how to conquer this problem, though I would like to figure it out because I love the idea of a brownie cheesecake, and this did taste great! I will probably try this again in the future after doing some research.

I changed up a fee things in this recipe and it turned out great! I used two eggs and 1 egg yolk, used real vanilla, added 3 tbsp of sugar and cooked it twice as long. The brownie isn't sticking to the pan or separating from the cheesecake. The whole house approves!

The only thing I would say about this recipe is that the brownies tend to stick to the bottom, even though you spray the bottom.  So just look out for that.  This recipe also makes a lot.

This was a good recipe. I think the family preferred graham cracker crust though. 4 stars because the brownie and cheesecake did seperate which was a bummer. But not a bad recipe if you prefer brownies instead of graham cracker.
