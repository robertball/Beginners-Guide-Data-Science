I tried this recipe 2 ways. When I cooked (boiled) all of the veggies they seemed to use flavor.  The second time I used the same ingredients and roasted the peppers and tomatoes on the grill.  Talk about bringing out the flavor!  WOW!!

Cooking the ingredients seems to destroy the flavors and make the dish not very suitable as a salsa.  It tastes more like a base for a stew or a sauce for a casserole dish.

I found this recipe to have a vegetable soup flavor, I think that it would be much better if it hadn't been cooked

This recipe was plenty hot, and it has potential. I've had success with low rated recipes in the past, so I was hopeful I could make this one work. However, it was very bland. Boiling the peppers and onions kills the flavors, and everything turns into a mushy mess. Not to mention all the added water was a disaster, I had to strain it three or four times to "dry" it out a bit. I managed to save it by throwing some lime juice over it, but I won't be making this again, sorry.
