No game taste....make sure it doesn't cook too long or it gets too dry.

Smelled delicious and tastes even better. However we had to leave it in for an extra half hour.

The best pheasant I have ever eaten. The only change I made was to roast it in my small Nesco but I used the same temperature setting as in the recipe. It came out tender and flavorful. Six stars!

I was very nervous about cooking our first pheasant as the bird is quite expensive. This recipe was easy to follow and we ended up with a flavorful tender meal. http://www.oureatinghabits.com/2015/01/26/roast-pheasant/

I cooked the pheasant in my electric roaster. Fortunately I checked the temperature at 90 minutes because it was done at that point. The flavor was delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

First time cooking pheasant it came out wonderful. I did have to cook over 1 hour longer because we had a larger than usual bird. Came out tender and not dry.
