I have made these several times now with all sorts of alterations and as the recipe states.  They are a family favorite for sure!  If you want quick and easy, canned chicken works great for this recipe. Thanks for posting it!

These were a hit with the family!  I doubled the recipe for a family of 5, and used regular sized muffin pans.   Thanks for sharing Arielle!

I've made many quinoa recipes and this by far is my families favorite. These little nuggets blew our minds! The only thing I changed was I subbed goat cheese for cream cheese because it was what I had. I will make these again very soon.  Thanks for sharing :-)

Very yummy! I used egg beaters for the egg and spoonful of chia gel for the egg white.

I made this and it was good but not great. Went by the recipe to a T and buying the ingredients in the recipe. Has the perfect buffalo sauce flavor!

Tasty with room for variation. I only substituted about 1-2 tsp of Sriracha for preference and to keep it mild for the kids. The ingredients came together well, not stiff and dry not too runny to just drop spoonfuls onto a silpat over the cookie sheet.  They were done in 21 minutes, moist on the inside with crunchy edges and bottoms. Will make again for sure as it’s such an easy way to use up extra quinoa. If you don’t have all parts ready to go (cooked quinoa, shredded or chopped cooked chicken), then this will take more time - roughly the 18-20 min for quinoa.

Wow! These are fabulous! I made this recipe pretty much exactly as written, except that I formed balls with the mixture and baked them on a half-sheet pan with a Silpat. They held together well and, boy, do they disappear fast!

I didn't make any changes, but it I think next time I would use 2 eggs instead of 1 egg and 1 egg white and then double the batch. Everyone wanted more! I will definitely make this again!

We loved these!  I used a tofurkey meat replacer instead of chicken since we are vegetarians and it was amazing. My only complaint is that the cook time was way off for me. I ended up needing almost 30 minutes in the oven to get them solid enough to remove from the pan.  My 2 year old wasn't a fan but he's hit or miss with most stuff anyways.
