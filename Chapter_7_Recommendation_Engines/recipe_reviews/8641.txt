I have a recipe almost identical to this one.  For those who had problems or disappointments; This is what you do: Season all sides of chicken pieces(and yes bone in chicken works!!) with salt pepper and garlic powder; or use your fave seasonings. Place in shallow dish or bowl; and use the dressing as a Marinade! and marinate for at least one hour.  Then line a baking dish with foil(dull side up)remove chicken from dressing and place in foil lined pan. Then top each piece with cheese after about 45 minutes..parmesan works best for me, and return to oven for 15 minutes until lightly golden brown. Prepared this way makes it a 5 star!
PS>>remove skin from bone-in chicken pieces**

After some modifications, we really enjoyed this recipe.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and we weren't very fond of it.  We thought it was rather greasy and the ranch taste was pretty strong.  However, I liked the idea of it, thought it was a good blend of flavors, so I decided to attempt it again.  The second time, I poured enough ranch dressing into a skillet to coat the bottom, then placed the chicken in the pan and cooked it fully on top of the stove first.  Then I put the chicken in an ungreased baking dish and covered it with mozzarella cheese and placed it under the broiler until it melted.  This time we had a winner!!!!  We really enjoyed the meal and will have it again!!

I make this recipe once a week, combining many of the suggestions of other raters.  I use a quick spray of Pam, then put chicken breast tenders in my baking dish, or if I'm cooking for more than my husband and myself, I use whole chicken breasts, which I flatten by pounding.  I sprinkle powdered ranch dressing (Hidden Valley makes one) over the chicken, and thanks to someone's idea, put Hormel Real Crumbled Bacon on top of that.  My husband loves spicy stuff, so I chop up jalapenos and put that on top of the bacon bits.  I cover my chicken with foil and bake at 325 for 45 minutes, uncover and top with a combination of mozzerella and cheddar cheese, then put back in the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes.  This is the easiest dinner to fix, and it's so delicious.  The chicken is so tender and juicy.  I just made it, without the jalapenos, for my 80 year old mother and my 96 year old grandmother, and they loved it!

REALLY GOOD w/ a few changes. Spray w/Pam, not oil
. Before I added Cheddar, I layed a slice of Armour Dried Beef(in the small jar). It made for a real boost in taste. Use 1/2 sour cream/Ranch. The grave/sauce is wonderful. This is an easy,good recipe w/much potential to "do your own thing".  I also like it w/green pepper slices & a little garlic powder.  Thanks for the keeper recipe,Jan!

I have always made a recipe similar to this using 4 to 6 boneless skinless chicken breast. I fry my chicken in a skillet on top of the stove with ranch dressing poured on top. I don't measure anything. It only takes a few minutes. I top it off with mozzarella or fresh grated parmesan. Doesn't need the oil. It's great! My kids also like to eat it on a nice hard roll for sandwiches. I work in the food business and sometimes have to create recipes and believe it or not this also tastes great on talapia fish. I melt butter and garlic and add the ranch dressing to make a sauce, then add the fish and top with more ranch dressing and parm. or mozz. cheese or no cheese at all. Fry till it flakes easily. You wouldn't believe how much it sells when made like this!!! Ranch dressing is great on alot of things! Thanks!

This was a very EASY & tasty dish!  I took a suggestion from the other reviewers and used a bit of cooking spray to coat the pan rather than olive oil.  I also used turkey tenderloins instead of chicken and used a Light Ranch dressing.  My kids and husband devoured it and I will definitely be making this again!

Good taste and very easy to make.  I use low-fat ranch and skim mozarella, otherwise the recipe is LOADED with fat!

I thought that this recipe was pretty good. I think next time I make it I will change it up just a little though. I recommend using pretty small/thin chicken pieces, I used breasts and they were really too thick for this recipe. I would probably try the sour cream version as well even though I did like the ranch okay. One thing I did do differently was I topped it with crushed season croutons and it made for an awesome topping!!! I also used Italian cheese blend and cut back a little on the olive oil. It was pretty good for the amount of ingredients and time to prepare.

Yummmmmmy and Easy!!!!  I used a "lite" ranch dressing which might have kept it from being too strong (a good thing) and also used Pizza shredded cheese - mozzarella and cheddar.  My boyfriend loved this too.  The chicken was VERY moist but fully cooked.  This is surely a future repeat!!!

I am soo glad to have a recipe that takes so little time and tastes so good!  My 3 year old queen of the fussy loves this dish! It is the magical dish that got her to eat chicken (well -drumsticks only)!  I have shared it with my fellow moms as well as this web site!  My husband (who my daughter got her fussiness from) loved it also!  It is a new family favorite and great for those days that I just don't have time to make a long to make meal!
One suggestion:  I pan fried the chicken first and it made it even tastier.

After reading the recipe, I thought it needed some color (everything was white) so I browned the chicken just a bit on both sides, and threw in some green pepers and 1/2 jalepeno to saute with the chicken. I then mix a bit of tabasco with the ranch for an added kick, and added a bit of cheddar for extra color. This recipe was sooo easy, and VERY good!

Loved It!!  This will be a regular dish at my home since it was so good and easy.  I took the suggestions of others and after spreading the ranch over chicken, I coated the chicken in italian seasoned bread crumbs and parmasan.  Used Pam on baking dish. Baked at 350 for 30min (covered) then added the motz. cheese (uncovered) for almost 10min till it was melted.  It turned out very juicey! Served with Egg Noodles.  Great dish!  Thanks!

I cut this recipe down to serve two- I did this with chicken tenders in a 9x9" casserole. I also topped the chicken with bread crumbs based on another review. It was really good- it had a great creamy texture.  I served it with pasta, although next time I might make some crusty bread with it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Tastes like the inside of a chicken enchilada.  My husband and I both loved it.  For two people, this is how I made it: sprayed 8x8 with Pam (no oil), 2 chicken breast halves, mixed 1/2 c lite ranch w 1/4 c lite sour cream, handful of mozzarella and cheddar on top.  Used suggested cooking time with no problem.  This is a great Atkins or South Beach meal with very little carbs/sugar.

Yum!  I made this recipe last night - but with a few modifications.  I seasoned the chicken with pepper and garlic powder, covered the chicken with ranch dressing (only about 1/2 a cup for one breast), baked it for 15 mins, then added some shredded cheddar and baked for another 5 mins!  It was yummy!!  Next time I'll add some chopped veggies!  Thanks for the great idea!

I took the recipes suggestion of sour cream -- mixed it half and half with the ranch dressing.  It really toned down the ranchy flavor a little and yet left it creamy & moist.  EASY, busy day dinner and anything ranch flavor is always a hit with my kids.  They inhaled this!  THANKYOU!

Awesome. Easy. Quick.  What more can you want.  I made this for my husband and he couldn't get enough.  I am always looking for a new way to shake up a chicken dinner and this was excellent.  Note - I added carrots and broccoli so as to assure my husband got his veggies and served the whole thing with egg noodles that were mixed in butter and salt - Two thumbs up!  Next time I might throw in some potatoes with the chicken and veggies for a complete all in one meal w/ no excesss pots to clean (lazy man route however egg noodles being so easy really are the way to go).

Definately an A1 meal for a busy tiring day.  I would recommend cheddar cheese, however, it has more flavor than mozzarella.  I used a combination and it worked out great.  THANKS!!

This was great and easy! It was the first time in a long time we were able to eat quickly after work yet have it be something hot (new baby at home).
I did not use the oil, but I did use half sour cream and half ranch dressing. I also added the bread crumbs and garlic on top of the dressing before baking. I cut back on the amount of dressing and cheese used, but would increase it the next time and serve the sauce over egg noodles.
Thanks Jan!

This was awesome!  The hubby and I both loved it.  I scaled it down to just 2 chicken boobies and seasoned it with garlic, pepper and johnny's seasoning salt before pouring on the ranch.  Also added some cheddar for color and it came out perfectly divine!  Yummy!

Loved it!  My husband is (again) out of town on business, so I decided to try it as he doesn't like cheese anyway.  I used the ranch dressing II, from this site, because it is really thick, and I skipped the oil, using pam cooking spray in it's place.  I also added broccoli & carrots to the dish & it looked as good as it tasted!  Thanks Jan!

This was a great, easy recipe!! At first, when my kids saw me put ranch dressing on the chicken, they refused to try it. My daughter said "that goes on salad!!". BUT, when I took the dish out of the oven, it smelled so good, they began to consider it. Then, I cut one chicken breast up, put it in a flour tortilla, put more cheese on top and heated it up in the microwave for my daughter. Now, this recipe is one of our favorite! She loved it!!...in or out of a tortilla!!

This recipe was fabulous!  It is the best of 3 worlds - cheap, easy, and yummy!    I was leary of ot being too "ranchy", but with the cheese that wasn't the case.  I cooked it until browned and bubbly and also added some bread crumbs to the top.  I served it over egg noodles and my husband and I thought it DELICIOUS!

I'm glad I didn't use the olive oil for the bottom of the pan, the cheddar/mozz. cheese added enough oil to the dish.  Overall, a good dish to serve over rice.

How fabulous!  This was a super simple, family friendly, very easy recipe.  A big hit with my family who's ages range from 5 to 87 yrs. old.  Serve this over wild rice (beautiful presentation) and with your favorite veggie.  This has moved to the top of our request list!

This was absolutely excellent!!  It was the most tender baked chicken I have ever made.  The only changes I made:  1 Tbsp olive oil, 6 oz. mozzarella, and used a 8x8 baking dish. A definate keeper, and I'm passing it on to my friends. I plan on trying the leftovers on pasta as some have suggested. Yum, yum, yum!!!

I was leary of this recipe as I don't care for ranch dressing, however I needed something quick & easy and it sounded simple. I was cooking for a group of about 50. Not only was it very easy to make, it was also a smash hit! It didn't taste like it was flavored with ranch dressing. It was just good, good, good! I mixed the mozzerella cheese with chedder and jack cheese.

Anyone who reads this, do NOT be afraid to try this easy and wonderful recipe! I'm not a huge fan of ranch dressing, but decided to try this anyway, (and in spite of some of the negative reviews). This was sooo tasty! Yes, I did make a few personal additions though. I used whole breasts, which I seasoned with a salt-free garlic/herb seasoning. To offset the lack of color noted in reviews, I spread sliced black olives and sliced pimiento peppers over the breasts too. I only had peppercorn ranch dressing in the house, so I used that over the breasts. I used another reviewers idea of sprinkling bread crumbs over it all too. I used monterey jack for the cheese during the final 10 minutes. I garnished the meal with snipped pieces of green onion and served it over egg noodles. The end result was a very tasty, colorful, and easy meal! Thanks for a wonderful recipe Jan!

This was wonderful. I made modifications, I used the packets of ranch dressing and instead of using mayo I used sour cream and non fat milk. I used one packet as a marinade and the other packet to cook the chicken in.  When preparing the ranch dressing for baking, I also added some of this howlin horseradish dip mix I had to the ranch and the chicken turned out awesome!  I sprayed a 9X13 pan with Pam and baked it for 30 minutes at 350 and then took it out and topped with shredded Mozzarella cheese and put it back in for another 10-15 minutes or until the cheese was melted.  Served it over white rice and everyone loved it!  Will definitely make again and will just keep modifying!  Want to try it with different cheese and a bacon topping!  Definitely a keeper!

WONDERFUL, Great Tasting and VERY SIMPLE!!!  I used a Peppercorn Ranch dressing, sprinkled with cheddar cheese and added some Parm cheese at the end right before serving.  The whole family loved it, including my husband who is very picky!

I haven't actually made this recipe myself.  I'm giving it 5 stars because I gave this recipe to a friend who can't cook to save his life.  He cooked this recipe multiple times, and even once made it when he had friends over.  If it's simple enough that a non-cook can make, enjoy, and share with others, it deserves 5 stars!

The first time I made this, I used half ranch and half sour cream.  The sauce broke but it was still good.  This last time, I used half buttermilk ranch and half bacon ranch.  I topped it with a blend of cheeses, scallions, black olives and crumbled bacon.  Even my picky granddaughter loved it.  I will make it again.

This was ok...and that is about it. My mom made this for us tonight, and she followed the directions (except no olive oil) the ranch dressing ran off to the bottom of the pan, this is while the chicken was as close to eachother as possible (what the recipe said to do). All in all, it was not anything really different in my book...the chicken was kinda tasteless, and dry.
But thanks for the recipe Jan.

This recipe was so good. I needed to cook more chicken we didn't have enough it was so good. We changed nothing it was very good. It was so good it would be great with the chicken cut up in the ranch and baked and then poured over noodles too. Or a very great dipping sauce too for vegetables or bread while eatting your chicken. Highly recommend.

My daughter loved this recipe. I did misread the recipe and thought I was to add Cheddar cheese instead of mozzerella. She LOVES ranch dressing and eats on sandwiches, salads and of course chicken. I decided at the last minute to add in 1/4 cup BBQ. There wasn't any chicken left.

This is a great recipe with a few changes. I use non-stick cooking spray on the pan instead of oil. I mix equal parts of ranch dressing and sour cream and add about 1 1/4t of chicken boullion granules to add some flavor - tastes almost like a chicken stroganoff. I also season each side of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and use cheddar cheese. It's fantastic over egg noodles... my husband regularly requests it!

VERY good recipe.  I have my own version of this recipe, and it is wonderful!  All you will need in addition to this recipe is parm cheese, cheddar cheese, and bacon.  No oil necessary.  Here it is:

1.  Coat the chicken breast, on both sides, in ranch dressing.
2.  Also coat the chicken breast, on both sides, with shredded parmesan cheese, place in an ungreased dish.
3.  Bake for 25 minutes on 350, preheated.  
4.  While chicken is baking, fry a few pieces of bacon.  Set aside.
5.  Remove chicken from oven and top with shredded cheddar, to your liking.  I top it off completely.    6.  Tear bacon into large pieces and place on top of chicken and cheese
7.  Bake for an additional 10 minutes, until cheddar cheese is melted and lightly browned.

I went against my better judgement and used fat-free dressing and really regretted it.  Fat free is never good.  The rest of the family didn't think it was too bad, but I thought it was awful.  I don't know if I'll try this one again or notbut a bacon ranch dressing might be good, maybe if you used cheddar and topped it with tomatoes.  But definitely don't use fat-free.

This is very good, although I changed it up a little after reading the reviews.  I seasoned the chicken w/ garlic powder & pepper & then browned in a skillet a little.  Then I used 1/2 Ranch dressing (from a bottle) & 1/2 sour cream.  At the end, I topped w/ Cheddar cheese.  My husband absolutely loved it & said he likes it better than any other chicken dish I've cooked.

We cooked this on the grill (no oil) and it was SO GOOD. I used shredded mozzarella and cheddar and Kraft ranch dressing. 
Will definately try this in the oven to see the difference.

Tasted really good but there was so much oil covering the chicken after it came out of the oven. We had to pour out at least 1/2 a cup of oil. But once we did that it tasted yummy!

Whatever you do DO NOT use FAT FREE cheese!  I accidentally picked up FF Cheddar, and didn't have anything else in the house with which to substitute.  Even so, I gave this recipe 5 stars because my husband and I could definitely taste the potential.  I also threw in a couple of TBLs of bacon bits to add an extra dimension of flavor-Yum!  Thanks for this easy, tasty, FAST main course.

My husband is a VERY picky eater and he gobbled it down despite the two mistakes I made with this recipe.  1)the lower fat dressings work better and 2)be careful not to cook longer than the time alotted as the dressing will break down.  My sister also made this for her family and they loved it!

I thought this meal had a wonderful taste and would taste really good over a nice salad. However my husband didn't like it one bit. He said it smelled funny and tasted worse. I would make this again for me, but in a slow cooker, but not for him.

This recipe is a must have..quck, simple, and very tasty. I changed the ingredients & cooking directions. I went ahead and used chicken breasts & threw them in a ziplock bag w/ ranch dressing. I marinated them for a good hour to an hour & a 1/2. I salt and peppered each side and put them on the barbecuer for a good 10-15 minutes per side. During the last few minutes I turned off the barbecuer & sprinkled the breasts w/ shredded mozzarella. They were outstanding and a huge hit! I will forever keep this recipe & can't wait to make them again!

Delicious! I followed a couple of reviewers' suggestions and added a couple dabs of sour cream to the mix, as well as a little rosemary and garlic powder. It turned out beautifully! A great way to get rid of ranch dressing you discover you don't like.

I made this for dinner the other night and it was great! I ate a whole chicken breast and I told my husband that I could have ate more had I made more! We basically made just as is except I used cheddar cheese for the top because it was what I had.

I liked this but my picky husband and picky daughter did not.  Anyhow, this is fairly inexpensive and easy to make.  I did not have olive oil so I didn't use any oil at all.  Still turned out good.  I might make this again and see if they change their minds.

this was amazing,  we didn't find that the ranch was overpowering but just right.  I'm not sure if I actually used the full 1 1/2 cups of ranch I just poured out of the bottle (didn't want to dirty a measuring cup) till i could cover the chicken.  Before I added the cheese I also added some bacon which gave this a great flavour, and as I had some left over old cheddar I also added this to the recipe along with the mozza.  The cheeses melted in the with ranch to make a nice thick sauce,  we thoroughly enjoyed this recipe thanks so much!!

I modified this slightly: I had 3 breast halves that I covered and pounded on both sides with a meat mallet, then marinated in ranch dressing for about 3 hours. I put 1T of canola oil in a pan and sauteed 1/3 sweet onion until done (I like them almost-burned), then added chicken and covered. When cooked through, I put a tiny bit of mozzarella on top and broiled it for a few minutes until browned. My husband says that was the best thing he's ever tasted and has asked me to make it every week.

SO good!  Followed the recipe pretty much exactly and it was excellent!  I ended up baking this for about an hour and a half, as I like my chicken very tender.  This was so simple and delicious, it will definately appear on my table again!  What a life saver for a great dinner without alot of ingredients.

I sprayed the pan with pam instead of the oil.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and added nothing.  I've already made this twice because it is such an easy dinner.  My hubby isn't a huge ranch fan and he wolfed it down both times.  

The ranch makes the chicken really tender and surprisingly it doesn't taste that strongly of ranch to me when it's done.  What a quick great dinner idea!

Great quick recipe! I was looking for an easy recipe for some chicken breasts and this was it. I did season the breasts with garlic salt, onion powder, and fresh ground pepper before adding the Ranch dressing. I only put enough dressing to lightly coat the breasts, no where near what was in the recipe. Cooked for 30 minutes, added the Mozzerella and some Sharp Cheddar until it looked like enough and let it melt. Husband and son both liked this recipe. I, the one who prefers dark meat chicken, actually ate two of the very juicy breasts...the first time I've ever actually finished a chicken breast in my 42 years!

I really liked the recipe. I used chicken wings instead so the wings should be cooked about 20-25 mins before adding the Ranch dressing on top to ensure the wings are throughly cooked.

OK, but not over the top.  It tasted like chicken and hot ranch, so it was good but nothing special.  I even added bacon to spice it up a little.  Just ok.

I love ranch salad dressing, but I have to admit I was a little nervous about this recipe. Not any more! It was so delicious. Even my sister, who generally doesn't like chicken, enjoyed it. This is a wonderful recipe and one that I will make again and again.

Delicious!  We needed a fast dinner following a recent high school graduation.  I made this ahead and it re-heated in the microwave beautifully.  I added strips of red bell peppers and served over white rice.

I added bacon bits and used a mixture of shredded feta, mozzarella, and provolone cheeses instead of just mozaarella.  My husband and I both found it quite tasty, and it's so easy to make!

The family loved it!  I found it a bit "saucy"...I would probably cut down on that next time.  I used past suggestions & browned the chicken first, plus I used 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 ranch dressing.  I also used garlic powder & some Mrs. Dash to give it extra flavour.  I had some corn flake crumbs in the cupboard, so I threw those on as well.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks.

Unfortunately, I found it very fattening.  It was heavy on the tummy after eating it.  I suggest reducing the cheese to half and adding seasonings; however, I will not make this again.

Kids like this too.  Serve with rice.  The juices are great poured over the rice.

This was a pretty tasty recipe. I made a few changes ~ like a few other reviewers, I mixed half sour cream and half ranch dressing and then brushed it on the chicken. Before doing that I added some of my favorite spices to the chicken. Also, I didn't use olive oil and used Pam spray. I used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. Everyone in the family enjoyed it. I would have given it 4 stars but I thought the chicken was kind of dry. I will make this again, though.

This was pretty tasty.  The chicken was nice and juicy.  I used chicken breast and it seemed that the mozzerella cheese with the ranch dressing gave it an interesting flavor, slightly like a different type of alfredo sauce.  Anyhow I had to give this recipe a try since I am a lover of ranch dressing!

This is my first review and I love this recipe. My husband loves it also (and he's very fussy!)
I first made the recipe as stated, but feel it deserves these changes: sprinkle the chicken breasts with garlic powder, salt and fresh ground black pepper and brown it first (as some other reviewers suggest.)And add 1/2 cup sour cream mixed with the ranch dressing.
I feel it is very important to add the pine nuts for crunch!!
Yummy !

I made this last night using cheddar vs. mozzerella.  My 8 year-old daughter told me she was glad I was her mom because it was such a good dinner!!! 
Thanks - it was a great meal!!!!

Pretty good!  Added sour cream as someone suggested, yum.  Only usesd 3 boneless breasts but still took longer cook time than said.  Used co-jack cheese.

My 16 year old is really picky when it comes to chicken (preferring it breaded and deep fat fried over any other preparation).  She begged me to add this to my recipe collection!  It's easy to make, has a creamy sauce, and is great over noodles.  We substituted cheddar for extra flavor.

Good but uninspiring.  This recipe works well when your pressed for time and ingrediants but we were all only so-so on this.  I did add some minced green onion for color and taste. It IS good but I wasn't wowed either...

This has a very nice appearance and good taste, except that it is too salty.  I am going to try it again with a different brand dressing or adding some sour cream as part of the dressing.  We all thought it was worth another try.

This is a fairly good recipe, the chicken turned out very tender and juicy but the ranch dressing left a little flavor behind, my husband mixed the gravy/ drippings with pasta and he loved it.

Good recipe - my husband raved.  In the baking pan there is a large amount of grease, but it's fine if you transfer the pieces of chicken to a serving dish before presenting to the table.

This was just as simple and tasty as promised!  I used fat-free ranch dressing, and this did not seem to compromise the taste or tenderness.

I served this with pasta, but I think I would like it best with herbed rice or rice pilaf.  It is going to become a "company" dish because of its simplicity and excellent flavor - thanks!

My husband and son loved this chicken! I used boneless skinless chicken piceces and it worked great. Next time I am going to prepare some rice in my rice cooker and spoon the chicken over the top because the recipe made so much gravy.

This was exceptional in taste.  I would of never dreamed of using Ranch dressing and it added a nice zest to the chicken.  Was quite tender as well.

i wish i would have read the reviews first ! i will definitley try cindy's option out. i followed the directions and it was too much ranch. i added bread crumbs when it was time to put the cheese on. the time and temp was not long enough. i always cook chicken at 400 degrees for 40 mins or so. so i automatically did 400. but the 20mins cook then last 15 cheese wasnt enough. it was still pretty pink. had to put it back in for some extra time. also the ranch burnt around because it was too much. but it looked delicious and it was yummy. my boyfriend and parents enjoyed. will try again

Full marks for being falling-off-a-log simple. I used thick slices of mozzarella instead of shreds and they browned up nicely and got gooey, but slid around a little.

This wasn't bad, I followed another users' review and used the dressing as a marinade, lined my pan with foil, and after baking for 40 minutes in the oven, i topped with mozzarella and colby jack, and a bit of parmesan, then cooked 15 more minutes until golden brown. I had company over, and they agreed it was 'quite tasty!'. Will be making again.

2nd review: If you are short on time, make this w/a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing powder. I did and chicken came out much more ranch-ey than my previous review, and still very juicy (thank you olive oil)! Baked chicken at 365* for 40 mins, adding cheese last 10 mins. I will try marinading this in Ranch salad dressing next time when I have more time!! 

1st review: This recipe is a quick & easy keeper, thank you for sharing!! I will surely make this again but by marinading the chicken in the ranch dressing first, probably overnight, because it wasn't nearly as ranch-ey as I would have liked it to be! The amount of dressing seems fit, even for marinading, just not as flavorful as I expected! 
AND even after reading GenS's review below mine, I still managed to overlook adding the cheese last but it really was a nice mistake because I too had a tasty, slightly cheesy sauce to use as a topping!!

My whole family loved this recipe! I actually made a mistake and put the mozzarella on the raw chicken and the cheese bubbled into the ranch and chicken juices and made this really yummy sauce that you could put on top of the chicken to add extra flavor.

Loved this recipe. I used 1 1/2 pds boneless chicken thighs plus two boneless chicken breasts. I cooked the chicken for 30 min uncovered and then added the mozarella cheese for 15 more minutes. The chicken was so moist. I would make this recipe again.

My fussy husband said "wow this is really good!".  My alterations were to use two breasts.  I sprayed dish with Pam and sprinkled sea salt, ground pepper and thyme on both sides of the meat.  I didnt measure, but I basically covered the surface with a layer of ranch and topped with slices of mozzarella. VERY yummy!  Will make again!

This was SO easy, and delicious! My husband loved it. I did salt and pepper the chicken, and marinate it in the ranch dressing for a couple of hours. I then followed the rest of the recipe as written. Very very good, and I will make again...often!

This was a quick and easy meal, but it seemed to have been lacking something to me. It wasn't bad, just not what I was hoping for. I may try again with some adjustments.

This was easy and excellent!  I did not use any oil, and just poured enough ranch dressing over chicken to cover it and make a little sauce.  Have used various cheeses.  Yes, it tastes like ranch....it's supposed to.

This wasn't my favorite recipe, although it wasn't half bad.  It fit the bill for what I was looking for: very easy chiken and ranch recipe.  It certainly has potential and is something that I will make again in the future.

I used a lot of suggestions that were already posted. I skipped the olive oil and used cooking spray. I sprinkled chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and mixed the ranch with sour cream,using just enough to coat the chicken. I sprinkled bacon pieces on top and cooked at 325 covered for 45 minutes. Took it out and sprinkled the cheese on top and cooked another 15 minutes uncovered. This turned out great.

Great recipe!  For some reason, I never would have thought to bake with ranch dressing!  We used cheddar instead of mozzarella, just because I thought it went better with the ranch.  Sprinkled the chicken with garlic salt before adding dressing to it.  I would suggest baking your chicken for about 30 minutes, and adding the cheese at the last 5 minutes, otherwise it melts too much.  Thanks!

I made this recipe quite awhile back for my mom and brother.  All three of us liked it pretty well, and as an amateur, I found it extremely easy.  However, the fat content on this recipe is off the wall! If I can find a way to reduce it (maybe use low-fat dressing?), I will make it again.

I thought this was just okay.  My husband did love it.  Not sure if he was being truthful or if he was trying not to hurt my feelings  :)  Maybe I used too much dressing.  I used a buffalo ranch dressing.  I will make it again for my husband.

I made this and was a little skeptical that such an simple recipe could be good. This was delicious. It was a hit with the family and will be a regular on our dinner table from now on. Try it, try it try it! So much flavor!

 So simple, big hit with my husband, have made it and variations of it ( different cheese, different salad dresings) at least once a week, helps to make chicken interesting again!

My son could live on chicken with ranch dressing. He wasn't thrilled with this. Everyone else thought it was just okay. I think maybe breading the chicken and browning it first might help...would take a little longer than the original recipe.

I was a little torn on this recipe.. it was a little bland in a very 'ranchy' sort of way.  I added some cheddar cheese and black olives to give it some color.  While we weren't super exited about the recipe, my husband and I were both ok with it.  I'm going to keep this in my book for a couple of reasons.  A) NO effort to make.  B) I pretty much always have these ingredients (or something very close) available.  This will be something I fall back on when in a crunch.

Amazing!!  Easy, quick, cheap and tasted amazing.  Everyone wanted more (even the picky 3 year old) I only used 1 cup of cheese on top and thickened the sauce (which was a little thin) with 1 tb of corn flour (starch) in 2 tb water.  Will definately make again, thanks for a great recipe!

The sauce was very tangy...  I think I will halve the dressing in the future and maybe add cracked pepper to cut the sourness.  I used chicken breasts and had to cook it for about 70 minutes at 375 degrees (add cheese for last 20 minutes).

I made this with boneless chicken breasts that I had sprinkled with garlic powder, and pounded to an even thickness. I have to agree that it isn't the most attractive-looking dish ever, but it was surprisingly tasty, and talk about easy?! Thanks, Jan!

This was weird. After putting a small amount of oil in the bottom of the pan and adding all the other ingredients, it cooked into a somewhat tasty but REALLY oily dish. Even my husband who generally eats whatever without complaint said "good, but greasy." Thanks, but I won't make this one again.

This recipe over-all was very tasty, but, the dressing seemed a little over-
powering (go easy with the dressing).  I sprinkled ground chicken flavored stuffing mix & parmesan cheese on top of the ranch dressing & used a combination of mozzarella/cheddar cheese. Everyone liked it but next time I might try it with sour cream & cheddar.  Very easy recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I did not like this, nor did my Fiance. I followed the advice of some other cooks and used Pam, added bread crumbs & used cheddar. It's so simple, I dont see how I could've messed up in any way.

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  I use the Ceasar Ranch style dressing and that makes it even better!  I usually serve with brown rice...

i fully enjoyed this meal, much more than i have other recipes i've tried from this site.  i added brocolli and red peppers underneath the chicken, hidden valley spicy ranch dressing instead of regular, and added colby/pepper jack along with mozzarella.  i ate it over white rice. it's something i'd def eat again!

Super easy recipes.  Great for a quick dinner after work.  I was a little skeptical, but it turned it really good.  I tried another recipe on the back of a ranch dressing bottle and it wasn't nearly as good.  The whole family enjoyed this.  You can't get any easier, and for cleanup, I just lined the pan with nonstick aluminum foil - in and out of the kitchen quick.  Very tasty for such a simple recipe.

Mmmmmm good!  Everyone liked it! As others recommended, I used PAM in the pan.  I put season salt on the chicken tenderloins first, then topped with bacon and the ranch dressing.  Covered the pan with foil and baked at 325 for about 30 minutes.  Then topped with cheese and baked 10 minutes more uncovered.  The chicken was so moist!  Thanks for this easy recipe!

This was OK-not a ton of flavor.  If I made this again, I would either marinate the chicken in the ranch dressing before baking it or breading and browning the chicken before layering the dressing and the cheese.

Wow! I didn't expect this to be so great! I served the chicken and a touch of the drippings over white rice. Will definately make again - and will have to try the modified version with sour cream and cheddar! Thanks for bare cupboards.

This must have been super fatening with the olive oil and ranch dressing, but it was so easy and so tasty I will make it again. Next time I'll use a generic light ranch dressing.

My picky 5 year old loves ranch and we thought we'd try it one night. We did and we have it least a couple times a month! We do add some seasoned flour and bread crumbs as suggested by others. Thanks for something different!

Great easy recipe. I prefer it with the ranch dressing made fresh from a packet--just my opinion. Try pepperjack cheese for a "kicky" variation!

This is an all around great recipe!!! Very easy to make, and great for those of us who live in non-airconditioning in the heat of summer!!  i was afraid the ranch would overpower everything, but not at all!  I also used Sliced American Cheese instead of mozerella, which was fine, but if you do that, do not let your chicken cook for an additional 15 mins. lol.  The cheese gets to be a very ugly shade of brown.  Luckily it's just a matter of peeling it off and putting on new cheese.  I also had fried up some bacon and put that on top of the ranch dressing, but the cheese incident made me lose my bacon.  In the end, it was all okay, and I was very impressed with this ever so easy, shoulda thought of it myself recipe. :)

I liked this recipe.  I found it a little salty, it had good flavour, which is not a problem because I like salty food.  I used some tasty cheese as well as mozzarella (it would have been a little bland otherwise).  I meant to put some seasoning and brown the chicken before putting it on the oven, so I'll probably do that next time.  I had never tasted ranch dressing before, so it was a new thing, thanks for the recipe.

A good quick chicken recipe, although I'd prefer a bit more kick.

This was pretty good. I used Ranch dressing that already had the cheese in it and i used a mild cheddar cheese on top.The kids loved it!  I was looking for a quick fix with boneless breasts and here it was. This was sitting in my recipe box for a while and i wish i would have tried it sooner!

Delicious!  This dish was so easy to make and very flavorful!  I served it with egg noodles and carrots.  The sauce from from this dish was great on the noodles too.  Thanks so much for sharing.  We'll be having this one again and again!

My kids loved this. I cooked it a little differently. 375 for 30 minutes then added the cheese for 10 more minutes. Quick, tender and delicous. Thanks.

This was mediocre at best. I took other reviewers comments and added some crushed seasoned croutons and some green onions. Even with those good additions it was still just so-so. Olive oil in the pan was too much. Spraying the pan with PAM would be just as effective. My 5-year-old hated it.

I rarely write reviews, but this recipe was just too good and too simple not too.  The only thing I added was a bit of meat seasoning (or seasoned salt) sprinkled on the chicken before topping with the dressing.  You couldn't have an easier recipe, so it is hard to believe that it turns out so tasty!

This is a really quick and easy entree.  To lower the fat content, I reduced the amount of Ranch dressing in the recipe.  A few pine nuts sprinkled on top of the cheese makes a pretty finish.

This recipe was just okay for me and my husband.  Very bland.  I think it's a good idea to build on, but not too good the way it is.  I would try using sour cream with dry Ranch dressing mix instead of the bottled Ranch.  I would also use American cheese instead of the other varieties, as my chicken came out looking very oily and not too appetizing.  I would add different spices and do as another reviewer suggested and add some mixed veggies to the sauce.  And it is extremely important to serve this over the top of something like noodles, not just by itself.  Maybe doing these things would make this recipe worthy of serving to company.  As is, I wouldn't dream of serving it to dinner guests!

I used Swiss cheese as I didn't have mozzerella. The first time I made it I 
enjoyed it, so I made it again. Stragely enough, I didn't like it the second time. 
Perhaps third time's a charm?

I used buttermilk ranch dressing, some plain bread crumbs and cheddar cheese when making this recipe.  It turned out really moist and pretty tasty.  This is a recipe to think about when you don't have a lot to work with.  Angela

I rated this recipe before giving it 5 stars. I use it all the time, tastes good and is quick. Just thought I would share my changes to give it a Sante Fe kick. Use Mexican cheese mixture (Jack and Cheddar)and mix some Frank's Red Hot and a small amount of chipotles in adobo sauce in with your ranch. Bake as directed. YUUUMMM

I first had this dish when a friend made it, and I loved it.  I recently made it myself, and it was equally good, but I think the next time I might try some suggestions that I read in reviews, such as rubbing the chicken with garlic powder and using half sour cream and half ranch.  I used chicken thighs, and they didn't make quite  1-1/2 pounds, so I was able to cook them in a 9 inch pan in my toaster/convection oven.  I was in a hurry and had to estimate the amount of dressing; it seemed like too much, but I wasn't sure whether the chicken was supposed to be completely covered in order to cook well. I thought maybe I should use less dressing, and cover the pan with foil for the first stage of cooking.  I liked someone's suggestion of adding vegetables to this, like peas and carrots, and I might make some rice to serve with the leftovers, with all that sauce.  I used Newman's Own dressing, because most of the others contain MSG or other chemical ingredients that I didn't want.  I didn't find the olive oil to be a problem, as some did, but I think a little melted butter might give it a richer flavor.  Also, there was a suggestion to put the chicken pieces close together to prevent the cheese from burning.  However, as the left-over chicken in the pan started to cool, I found it a little difficult to scoop up the individual pieces, because the cheese had started to harden and fused the pieces together.  So, either separate before cooking, or separate immediately after cooking,

I made this for dinner tonight and I was on the page as I made it so I could review right away lol. I read reviews before I made this so I did as a few others suggested I seasoned the chicken before adding the ranch. I used garlic powder, onion powder, and seasoning salt on both sides of the chicken. I used thin sliced breasts so it was a little dry but it was cooked all the way through. I used sharp cheddar since I don't usually have mozzarella at home. I had everything already and I chose this recipe because my husband loves both ranch and cheese. It was delicious! His mom is picky so she only thought it was ok but he and I really enjoyed it. We used garlic mashed potatoes as a side and I spooned some leftover sauce over them as a gravy. It was nice and was tangy. I think next time I'll try adding bacon as others have suggested. That sounds like it'll make it even better, maybe try it with buttered noodles as others have suggested as well. I'll definitely make it again, thanks for the recipe! :)

Took longer because I used thick chicken breasts, but it was very good. Great flavor and goes well with corn and black eyed peas with jalapeño in it.

This was good. I baked it covered the 1st have. Then uncovered it and added diced cooked bacon and jalepenos and then put the cheese on top and baked it uncovered for another 15 minutes or so. Had good flavor and will make again!

It was ok. I thought it a little odd not to have any seasonings on the meat, so I added some, but not too much b/c I didn't know if it would be overpowering. The first batch was a little bland, but the second batch was really good when I spiced it up more, added a little tabasco to the ranch and topped with panko bread crumgs that I seasoned.  I will definately make again...just with a little extra. Thanks for a quick and easy change to chicken.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I marinated the chicken in ranch and then breaded it before baking - I'm not sure I liked that method - next time I'm going to try it non-breaded.  But still, even with that glitch, it was a good dinner.

I really enjoyed this. I used my favorite Ranch Dressing (Greggs/Costco) which I think would make a difference if you got a brand you did not like otherwise. I also, did not have any Mozzarella cheese so I did without.  I'm going to use the leftovers to make with Alfredo. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this because it seemed simple and had great reviews...I was not impressed at all. I gave it 2 stars because it was quick and simple to make but it just tasted like chicken with ranch. I know those are the ingrediants but with all the great reviews I assumed it was going to be something delicious. If you like the taste of ranch on chicken then then this is for you; if not then I wouldn't try this.

Was delicious! Also made it with some modifications.pam instead of oil in the pan. Sprinkled the ranch powder on, covered and baked for 35 minutes then used an Italian cheese blend of 4 cheeses on top and baked for about 10 minutes to melt. Yum!

Pretty good, I browned the chicken first. I also added half a cup of sour cream to the ranch. Then I baked the chicken for 30 min. then sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and baked for 5 more minutes.

This was okay. It ended up being too greasy between the cheese and the ranch dressing. The general taste was average though. It needs something else, like some sort of veggie in it.

it was easy but kinda bland, I used about 2 Tablespoons of Ranch since we are trying to eat healthy. The sauce just didn't mix well with the juices from the chicken.

Wonderful flavor!  I used only 1 cup of dressing and 1 1/2 cup cheese.  I told a few friends about it, and it has spread like wildfire!

For I spicier version you can substitute the dressing for a chipolte or buffalo ranch dressing.

This was good. I made it into an adult recipe by adding hot sauce.  It was enjoyable both ways.

Wow!  I was totally surprised that I liked a baked dish with ranch!  I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt, white pepper and seasoning salt and definitely had to add time for the chicken to bake.  I also added sauteed zucchini under the cheese for an added veggie - the boyfriend totally ate it up!  Thanks for this recipe!

Not bad, but did need some more flavor. Added a bit of garlic salt and a little grated MOnterrey Jack with jalapenos. 
Might need a little less Ranch dressing.

WE FOUND THAT THIS RECIPE WAS VERY, VERY RICH. SOME MAY LIKE THIS AND IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO TRY IT WITH BONE-IN CHICKEN...DON'T. THIS IS WHAT I HAD AND WHAT I USED AND IT DOES NOT WORK OUT WELL AT ALL HAVING TO COOK THE DRESSING THAT LONG. WE WILL TRY IT AGAIN WITH THE BONELESS, SKINLESS CHICKEN BREAST THOUGH, BEFORE WE GIVE IT A NO GO FOR US.

This recipe was not good! Besides the fact it was all one color (chicken is white, ranch is white, cheese is white) and didn't look appealing, it just didn't taste good. I went back and looked at it to make sure I didn't forget something, but I made it the way it said.

This is one great chicken recipe - easy and ingredients are always on hand. I served this with pasta and broccolli with a side salad.  Guests asked for more.

This is the easiest recipe ever, and tasty at the same time.  I used cheddar cheese and served with rice.  Will definitely make again for those nights tight on time.  Thanks Jan!

this was good, but greasy. I used a nonstick pan and cheddar cheese. Next time I will use a lot less dressing.

I changed this recipe a lot because I had chicken pieces (bone in) so I don't know if it even qualifies. this is what I did. I made ranch dressing from scratch, using more milk so it wasn't thick, and marinated the chicken pieces in it all day. Then I coated the chicken in a flour/crushed corn flake combo. Baked it in the oven, 425, 45 minutes. After 1/2 hour I brushed on a little melted butter. My kids said it was the best chicken they'd had in a long time. Tender, flavorful, and juicy. They said "Give it 5 stars!" so I did.

This was good but after 35 min. one of my pieces of chicken were still red so I cooked it for about 5 more min. My whole family loved it though.

I wish I could give a good review on this, but I just can't.  The only thing it had going for it was how fast it was to make - that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.  My kids ate it, only because they were hungry and I didn't have any time to fix another meal.  The smell of the ranch dressing while cooking was not good, and the meal was very bland.

This was an puddle of grease with very plain chicken in the middle. Not impressed. No idea what went wrong. It was so promising, too, being so easy... Oh well.

This was okay, but I didn't get a "WOW" from my husband or teenager.  You really have to like ranch dressing to love this recipe.  I may change the recipe some to our liking.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is delicious!  Very juicy , tender and flavorful chicken.  And the sauce is wonderful served with egg noodles for a side dish.  My husband LOVES it!  A real keeper!
