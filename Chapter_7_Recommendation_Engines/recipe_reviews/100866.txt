good flavor, but too thick and rich - like drinking melted chocolate chips.  Also, we could not taste the egg nog.

I was a little disappointed that the egg nog flavour didn't really come through very much. It just tasted like regular hot chocolate. That being said, it tasted quite good. The coffee liqueur was a nice touch, too.

I really liked this hot chocolate! Though I wouldn't add the coffee ligueur, it's already quite sweet without it. Definatly a keeper!
