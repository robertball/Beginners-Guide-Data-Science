I have made this lasagna before and really the recipe is very good. My only recommendation would be to buy medium moisture mozzarella cheese you will notice the difference in the end result. My actual tweak of this recipe lies in preparing bechamel sauce to add on top of the meat sauce on each layer. The difference that adding the aforementioned cheese can be noticed and if you add the bechamel it makes this recipe even better!

We were disappointed. The problem has to do with two things: the oven-ready lasagna and the lack of ricotta or other cheeses. The sauce is good, though!

It turned out really good.  I used a store bought sauce to save a little time but also had to Doctor it up a bit more. This was my 1st time using sweet chili sauce in lasagna and it gave it a different flavor and I liked it.  I also used the noodles that don't require boiling you just bake them...those I will never use again I didn't like them at all.

Will definitely use this recipe again.
