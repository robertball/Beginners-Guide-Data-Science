I made this to go with homemade chunky tomato soup. I used Bagel Thins and thick sliced hickory smoke bacon. The kids thought this was great. Very easy supper idea. EDITED: Because I now eat low carb, I omit the bread and I like to spread a tiny amount of mayonnaise on a big piece of lettuce, then wrap the bacon and tomato inside the lettuce.

My husband's all time favorite not to mention mine as well!  I use thick cut bacon, add salt and pepper to the tomato, and lightly toast the bread - it's a classic that you never grow tired of and shouldn't mess with...  It's a plain, simple, straightforward recipe and when you want a BLT, you want a BLT!

This is one of my all time favorite sandwiches!  Sure, it may be a "classic" to some, but not everyone cooks the same cuisine, so THANK YOU, MOTTSBELA, for posting a great classic that some may assume *everyone* already knows how to make.  I hope someone learns the joy of eating a nice bacony BLT as the result of your post!  (I do prefer to bake my bacon in the oven, though, for nice flat strips w/less stove top mess).

I add salt and pepper to the tomato before closing the sandwich, and put mayo on both pieces of bread. Easy and delicious. A staple in the south.

If your doing BL&T's for a family try doing the bacon in the oven,on parchment paper, pan with a lip, lay it out, bake for about 20 minutes. You don't have to turn it just let it get crisp. White pepperidge farm bread, toasted hell mans mayo, big tomatoes from somebody's garden, leaf lettuce and its the best. Summer is here when your eating this sammi. Supper tonight,yes!Thanks for reminding me Mottsbela!

This is a great standard recipe. The key for this sandwich is the quality of the ingredients. (Home Grown Tomatoes). My favorite BLT sandwich came from a restaurant up in Carmel, ca. I found out that they notched it up with a very thin layer of peanut butter, on one slice of the bread, and between the lettuce and tomatoes, they added thinly sliced Maui onion. Since I am not a peanut butter fan, I can't believe how much I love this sandwich. But I do.

This has become my favorite sandwich. I use Dark German bread, make a spread with mayo and mustard, romaine lettuce, turkey bacon and fresh tomatoes, but what makes it even better is adding fresh avacado. Yum!

It's pretty straightforward, this is a BLT.  Sometimes there's not much better than a BLT with home grown tomatoes in the summer.    For me it's gotta have Duke's mayonnaise and salt & pepper to taste.

I made BLT's last night for dinner, a family favorite! I have a young teenager here that just might want to make a BLT and if I wasn't home to answer questions she'd come right to AR to look it up.

Anything is better with bacon!!
I like to add a very thin layer strawberry jam to the side of the toast that the bacon in next to.  There's just something about the sweetness of the jam and the saltiness of the bacon. Tomatoes on the side with the mayo and salt and pepper.  Yummy!

Always a classic, but you must do mayonnaise on one slice of bread, peanut butter on the other, and assemble! Delicious!

Have to love a BLT! It's simple and so delicious! We usually make this as a club sandwich, but it's great as is too. We often use Morningstar Farms vegetarian bacon, and it's just as good. I never get tired or bored of having these for lunch, dinner, or even breakfast sometimes! Great recipe :)

Some might say that this recipe is useless because it's too simple and everyone already knows it. But you know what? I'm not american, i've never heard of a BLT before and bacon isn't even that popular in my part of europe, so it was definately useful to me! A great sandwich, i'll be making it quite often from now on! Thank you for posting the recipe!

I found a recipe for baking bacon and it is so easy.  There is no more spatter and the bacon lies flat.  It's taken me over 50 years to figure it out, but now what I do when I want a BLT is to cook the whole package of bacon and then just store the left over in the fridge until the next time I want a BLT.  I've done this for my lunches at work and bring in all of the ingredients and then assemble at lunchtime.  So easy and I'm the envy of all!

I learned some pointers from reading the reviews that I had never heard of before and am anxious to try.  Such as adding peanut butter and avacados.  Thanks Mottsbella for teaching a 70 year old dog new tricks.

Loooove classic BLTs - I take them for lunch at work all the time. I love piling the veggies high! I cook the bacon in the microwave and pat with papertowels before adding to the sandwich.

A classic that will always be loved! Summer comfort food with tomatoes fresh off the vine. I usually toast my bread and add a sprinkling of salt, pepper and hot pepper flakes.

You can never go wrong with a BLT! It's one of my favorite sandwiches. I added extra mayo and also cracked some fresh pepper and sea salt on top. Delicious anytime, morning, noon or night! :)

My Mom used to make our BLT's open-faced; then she would heat up Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup (made with milk), and pour it over the BLT's! Still my favorite way to make them!

This truly is a classic!  But it’s at its best when homegrown tomatoes are available.  Well, it’s that time of year in Ohio right now, so I made this using a beautiful Ohio River Valley tomato, bright green baby lettuce from Hubs’ garden and some high quality bacon cooked to perfection.  Instead of the usual bread, this time I made it on a toasted “everything” bagel.  And, don't forget the mayo!  Just delicious!!

I butter (actually ICBINB) the toasted bread and also put mayo on both slices. Sometimes I go hog-wild and put more bacon on the sandwich.

Wonderful summer treat. Best if the tomatoes drip down your arm.  I put cream cheese on one of the slices of bread. 
Or for childhood memories - just the tomato and mayo. Peanut butter and bacon, or cucumber or banana.  Gee, I've forgotten many good things.

Nothing like a classic BLT sandwich.  I don't like plain mayo, so I mix it to mustard just to tame the tanginess of the mustard.

Yummy! This is a classic sandwich. Often this has been my "go-to" when I want something simple, easy to make and delicious. I made this with toasted white bread (Love's brand).  I also added honey mustard to give it more flavor. I cook the bacon in the oven using, "Bacon for a Family or a Crowd," from this website. A quick and tasty sandwich for lunch with, "Chicken Long Rice Soup, " also from this site.

I like to give it a kick with some of the flavored mayos available now, like the dijon horseradish, or chipolte for my husband.

Also if you're watching what you eat, it's actually pretty good on calories for a nice light lunch that still satisfies.

A good bread is essential and real, grown in the garden tomatoes take this from very good to almost indescribably delicious. I like to do my bacon in the oven (12-18 min @ 425 depending on thickness) so it comes out flat and crispy and plenty of fresh cracked pepper on it as well.

A few slices of avocado really kick up the taste a notch if you're using store bought tomatoes and also help provide a little variety when the tomato plant in your garden is producing them almost faster than you can eat them.

The only way to  improve this old classic is by using English muffin toasting bread and Miracle Whip.  One of our summertime favs....especially with our home grown tomatoes.

Fake, vegetarian bacon?  To each their own.  I like the real deal and have recently found an uncured bacon without nitrates or nitrites sold in grocery stores by Oscar Mayer.  Make my own mayonnaise.
If I hadn't been late getting my seeds started, the tomatoes would be here instead of waiting for ripening. Giving 5 stars as this is what a summer sandwich is all about.

I've also used fresh French Bread (sliced diagonally and not toasted), bacon from my local butcher, fresh tomatoes from my garden, Romaine lettuce, and then skip the Mayo -- I garnish with lots of hamburger dill slices.  Wow!  All the food flavors really stand out and it is a Summertime must!

To make this a little healthier I use turkey bacon which I lay on a flat nonstick cooking sheet and bake at 400 for 10-12 minutes. Still tastes delicious!

Definitely my favorite sandwich hands down.  If you're not too worried about the fat then I suggest grilling your bread (thicker the better) in a little bit of the bacon grease.  It makes the sandwich that much more flavorful.   Throw on some perfectly ripe avocado and that's a dish I can eat morning, noon, and night.  Now I want one!

No one has mentioned adding a good french dressing or better yet a russian dressing to the sandwich. Started doing this in college 30 years ago, and have been eating these with dressing ever since

This a great classic, but if your a fan of peanut butter, use it inplace of the mayo--Just try it.

One of our easy summer favorites.  To add more protein we use an old Girl Scout trick and add peanut butter. Put it on the bacon side, mayo on the lettuce and tomato side.  Sounds a bit unusual but once you try it, you may never want it without.

I half expected Gordon Ramsey to bust in my kitchen and say, "It's literally the name of the sandwich, you idiot!" :D! But I never make "special" sandwiches, and wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything. I did add siracha mayo, but did the exact recipe otherwise

We have found that using toasted brat buns is so much better than regular bread. Plus the size and shape of a brat bun accomodates 2 slices of bacon nicely.

No, we are not kidding.  Peanut butter instead of the mayo on a good, toasted sourdough makes my heart sing!  Sometimes we sjugo w/ bacon and pb on toast.

Here is a little clue. Cook the bacon on medium heat to keep it from spattering and curling. Takes a few minutes longer but it's worth it.

Love BLT's! Sometimes I'll put sliced cheese on them, sometimes there's no bacon left by the time my toast gets done! It's good either way. After all, it includes bacon!!

One of my favorite recipes of all time!  You really can't go wrong with a BLT for lunch any season! Also good rolled up in a flour tortilla in place of the two slices of bread!  Delicious!

As others have said, this is a great classic recipe.  I use center cut bacon (lower fat) and guacamole instead of mayo.  I like it on thick sliced french or sourdough bread, but may try some of the other suggestions here.

BLT is my favorite sandwich!  I too use the vegetarian "Facon" as we like to call it!  I add sliced avocado, salt and pepper to my naturally sprouted flourless toasted bread.   Cannot believe it tastes so good because it is so healthy.

Great inspiration for using what is in your kitchen.  A well made BLT is one of my favorite things to eat year round and when I saw the recipe  I was glad bc now maybe others will enjoy it too.  Btw never heard of the peanut butter trick.

A good BLT REQUIRES pepper and a little salt (depending on the bacon you use)...  otherwise it just doesn't taste homemade.  (I usually omit the lettuce, as it has no nutritional value to speak of... just my choice.)

i make this and add a slice of cheese or an egg for a change up or even both.  the egg makes it an even better hunger-buster.  i don't add salt because of the salt in the bacon, though.  i do add pepper and i add garlic powder to the eggs sometimes.  not much.  so many ways to fix this and adjust to your own personal taste!
