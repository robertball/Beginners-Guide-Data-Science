To us, this tasted like taco on rice, which is a good thing (we like tacos). I followed the recipe except I thought 1 TB seasoned salt was WAY too much, so I just used some regular salt (less than a teaspoon) and added some paprika, chili powder, and cayenne pepper. An extremely easy recipe, and it is filling and good. I served some dry cotija cheese to put on top, and that was really good. Next time I would maybe add tomatoes or red bell pepper and olives to make it a little prettier; maybe some cilantro, too.

Weird recipe....

My kids thought it was okay and my husband actually took a bit of the leftovers to eat (in a tortilla) for lunch today, but I certainly will not make this again.  It reminded me of dog food.  The consistency was way too thick, it was bland brown in color, and all I could taste was the refried beans.  

Also, I think there must be a mistake in this recipe - 1 TABLEspoon of seasoned salt AND 1/4 teaspoon regular salt??  I just used 1 teaspoon of seasoned salt and it was too salty for our taste. 

Maybe this recipe could be better if you add more water, use regular beans instead of refried, and use way less salt....

Simple, simple, simple and the entire family loves it.  Made it several times.  Only changes were 1 can of Rotel instead of green chiles and mixng the cooked rice into the mixture instead of serving it on top of the rice.  Great dish!!!

This is the best!!  I was looking for a simple recipe in which I had all the ingredients and this is what I found. I got a little worried because it looks kinda ugly, but it tastes so good.  Don't skip out on the mustard, it's the best part! My husband loved this reciped and he even added extra mustard to his. Definitly will make again and again! Thanks.

I found this recipe after doing an ingredients search for things I had on hand. I wasn't particularly excited about making the recipe, but thought, what the heck. My husband loved it, but it's right up his alley with meat, beans, rice and onions. Me, thought it was so-so. I did not add a tablespoon of seasoned salt because it seemed excessive. I didn't have any green chiles, but will add them if I make this again.

My husband loved this dish!!! I would definately make it again, but I would suggest adding a little rotel for spice. The recepie calls for hot sauce, but you can barely taste it. Overall, it was a good dish!

This is a staple recipe in my house now.  Even my two year old loves it.  I decrease the seasoned salt and mustard to 1 tsp and leave out the 1/4 tsp salt.  Great easy weekday recipe!

Interesting dish, I must say. I used instant white rice, left out the ground beef, and didn't use either of the salts. I was looking for a way to use refried beans I had. It isn't the prettiest thing to eat, but it was darn tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

I think this would make a better dip than a dinner. I did an ingredients search since I was in a hurry and did not read the whole recipe before starting to prepare it. There is a reason there isn't a photo, I think. Nor did I take the time to check the reviews - first time ever!  I depend on your reviews, good cooks.  The recipe definitely has a Mexican flair but it's one of the few I've made without tomatos! I added them after seeing the drab color and mushy texture and because there wasn't enough fluid as I now see others also did. Adding a cheese topping to each hot bowlful and a dollop of sour cream added the needed color. The family enjoyed it overall.

I love this recipe. I did not put in the seasoning salt and put in more mustard. Topped it with stewed tomatoes and garnished with shredded colby cheese.

Ehhh...well, this was okay. My daughter liked it. My husband and I not so much. My youngest son wouldn't touch it, but that's nothing new! ;-) Not a terrible meal if this is all you have on hand, but I would not make a special trip out to get the ingredients.

Family loved this recipe, but I found it just disgusting. I don't know if it's the cumin or the mustard, but I found it to be just a moshpit of gross. My picky boys loved it though, so its a toss up. It was easy to make.

Definitely needs some modification.  Too much salt.  We left out the 1/4 tsp of salt but used the season salt.  Next time we will season and add a little salt to taste.  We didn't have green chiles, but added chili powder and cayenne pepper and loads more hot sauce to compensate.  Also, didn't have refried beans, but baked beans seemed to suffice.  Need colour? Throw some fresh parsley on top.

This got 8 thumbs up at our house. Although my kids eat everything. I added mushrooms, black olives, tomatoes, and chili powder in lieu of the peppers, but would add the peppers if I had them. I used spicy beans, too. Finally I stirred brown rice right into the whole thing. My kids 12 & 9 have no problem with spice. We ate it with chips and guacamole. I have added this to the "meals to take skiing list." along with adding it to the meal rotation.

This is a good basic recipe that can be taken in so many different directions.  I had to make some modifications based on what I had on hand.  I used black olives in place of the green chilies as that is what I had on hand, and I figured the kids wouldn't go for the chilies.  I used basmati rice, again, since that is what I had in the cupboard.  At the end, I ended up adding canned diced tomatoes (pre-seasoned with basil, oregano,  and garlic), for a little more color and added flavors.  The kids really liked it, as did we adults, too.  During dinner we were thinking of all the ways we could serve this:  in a tortilla, as a burrito; as a dip on a plate with tortilla chips, sour cream, and cheese; add corn, fresh tomatoes, cilantro, salsa.  Some great possibilities!

This recipe is a keeper, and is very quick and easy to make.

This was very tasty, will definitely be making it again!! I was looking for a recipe in which I had all the ingredients in the house and this was one of the first that came up.  I made it as instructed and added 3 or 4 tablespoons of ketchup to sweeten it up and it was delicious! Will definitely make it again.

My family loved this dish with the rice stirred right into the rest. I did add some shredded cheddar cheese right before I served it, though. Because my kids don't care for hot (spicy) food, I did not add the hot sauce to the dish. Instead, I had each individual add the hot sauce if they wanted to. I did the same with some sour cream, which we love. My family thought this recipe was even better when we used tortilla chips to scoop it up. I think this recipe would make a great dip too.

I liked it and yes I didn't have chillies or added all that salt but stil really good. This is not a pretty on the eyes kind of dish especially if you are using canned refried beans, even that stuff alone isn't gorgous. So all the bad reviews on looks are kind of a given, but for a budget "waiting for payday" kind of meal it's good. Quite filling too. I wouldn't say this is kid friendly unless your child isn't picky. I'd keep this on hand and make minor adjustments to taste. Definitely a keeper.

I used this as a filling for tacos instead of on rice. I did not find it too salty, but my family tends to like salty meals. Great recipe, thanks.

Loved this.  I used fat free beans, which tasted fine.  I like my food spicey, so I diced some jalapenos and added them to the beef/bean mixture.  Can't give this five stars, since I wouldn't have liked it as much without cheese and sour cream.

This recipe was pretty good.  Nothing fantastic.  I used brown rice.  I also put red peppers in with the onions and hamburger.  It turned out pretty good.  Fast and easy.

I added some shredded mozzarella cheese on top and some hot taco sauce, it really balanced the flavours.  Unfortunately my kids (20mos and 3yrs) hated it!  I may make again cuz my hubby and I liked it just fine!

This was good but very salty, which I'm sure was an error on my part; I didn't have seasoning salt so made my own (which had a high ratio of salt to begin with). Other than the saltiness of it, I enjoyed this and will attempt to make it again with purchased seasoning salt! Thanks.

This was a quick, simple and hearty meal! I’m always trying to find some basic recipes to build off if since I have 2 meat eaters and I’ve vegetarian in the house. I agree that it didn’t need near the amount of season salt. I only used 1tsp and cut out the regular salt.

I made this recipes with everything except the green chilies and the ground beef. It turned out pretty good. I also used brown rice instead of white, with cheese on top.

Great recipe, very delicious.  It does, however, require a tad bit of coordination and more cleanup than I'd like.

For all of the ingredients I had to add, this dish came up with little flavor.

I loved it!  My husband doesn't love onions so i used onion powder instead.  I also put cheese on top.  I liked it better mixed together than just on top of the rice.  Even my two year old loved it.  Will definitely make again

SO QUICK!  SO EASY!  I was exhausted and this took no time.  I had a can a tomatoes w/green chilis instead of the can of green chilis, so I substited the tomates & chilis for the chilis and water.  Still turned out great.  This recipe basically tastes and turns out like chili w/o being soupy.

i used gimme lean ground beef substitute instead of the real ground beef, and tomatillo salsa instead of the canned green chilis.  i didn't use the regular salt, as i figured the seasoned salt would be enough.  wooh!  i was right, have plenty to drink on hand.  good, quick recipe, though.
