Made these to eat while we watched the super bowl, and we really enjoyed them. Nice and simple, tasted great. The french onion soup was a bit salty for me, but I usually feel that way about canned soup. We used 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground turkey for a double batch. Only 4 stars because it doesn't really seem like a recipe - more like a creative use of canned soup.

These were really yummy! I used fresh baked mini buns, I think any bun will do with this recipe! I will be making these again!

I just combined the soup with the raw meat, right out of the can, and mixed it in a bowl.  I would add only about a half a can next time, as the burgers were a little too moist for easy grilling, but they came out anyway and were very delicious!  The whole family gobbled them up!  Thanks.
