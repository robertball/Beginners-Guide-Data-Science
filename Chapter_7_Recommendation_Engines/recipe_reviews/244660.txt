I doubled the recipe but kept the original amount of spicy ingredients plus added spinach and used frozen corn.  It was fantastic.  Both my teenagers loved it.

Man-oh-man!!  This noodle bowl is so delicious!!  The perfect amount of heat!  Followed recipe exactly with one small exception.  I used spinach and green onions instead of corn. (Merely my preference).  Love the fact that they're simple ingredients too!  I will be making this over and over again!  Thanks for a great recipe!
Side note:  This is my first review, it's that good!

This was pretty tasty! I went rogue on the amount of each ingredient I added and it's pretty flexible. I used chicken except for shrimp as the footnotes suggest and added spinach because it felt like it needed a vegetable to cut it.  I also could't find the chile sauce and the red pepper flakes. I just used the sriracha sauce and cayenne pepper seasoning for the spice.  I'm definitely making this a regular dish!

Made this tonight for me and my daughter. She loves spicy food so it worked out good. I followed the recipe except I used stir fry rice noodles and canned corn instead of fresh off the cob. It was delicious. Next time we will try different noodles and maybe add some cilantro or thai basil.

This was wonderful.  I made it exactly as stated.  There was quite a bit of liquid in proportion to the noodles.  I highly recommend doubling the noodles and shrimp.  Very spicy.  We love that!

Yum... didn't  have fried garlic chili oil so I used a bit more red pepper flakes. It was right at the edge of almost too hot, but didn't cross over... really delicious.. MY only change next time will be adding some more stuff.. like some shredded carrots and spinach..

This was a really good and a versatile recipe! I used tofu and carrots in place of the protein and corn. Definitely want to try it with spinach next.

We LOVED this soup!  We added extra veggies (bok choy, carrots, red pepper) and shrimp, but the broth is so versatile you could add any veggies or protein or none at all.  The broth is scrumptious and the whole recipe is a breeze to make. It's our new favorite soup.

Very flavorful and almost has an Asian/Indian taste to it. My family loves it.  It does have a kick so if you cant handle spicy i'd say 1/2 the spices it calls for as in if it calls for a tablespoon use only a 1/2 tablespoon.

We loved this! I used some different spices, as I didnâ€™t have coconut milk or smoked paprika. But it still turned out very well.

I did not care for this dish.  I added extra noodles and did not like the texture of the Vietnamese udon noodles that I used.  I did enjoy the spiciness of the broth.    I do not plan to make this dish again.
