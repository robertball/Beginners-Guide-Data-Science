Tastes a lot like snickerdoodles, with a twist. I, too, rolled them in the sugar/cinnamon mix. Very tasty, with a nice texture. (sour cream taste not apparent)

I like how this cookie stayed so soft, puffy, and moist. The dough is super versatile. I left out the walnuts and made small rounded teaspoon sized cookies with cinnamon on top as snickerdoodles, and then also baked a batch of larger rounded-Tablespoon sized cookies, which made amazing big,thick, fluffy, soft sugar cookies just perfect for icing. The kids loved these.

Easy to make very moist. Found it easier to roll balls in sugar with cinnamon than to use a small glass.

This is one of my favorite cookies of all time!  It is not too sweet - a perfect coffee/tea cookie.  The only thing I do differently from the recipe is substitute pecans for the black walnuts, but that's just because I prefer pecans.  This is also an extremely versatile cookie dough - experiment with different nuts, currants, dates, chocolate, whatever.

My family loves these cookies! I make them when the weather gets cool and they are usually eaten within a few days. I use pecans or walnuts. But pine nuts will be the next batch.

I used butter and they turned out almost like a mini-scone.  Really yummy, and not too too sweet.  I made a quick icing from confectioners sugar and fresh lemon juice and drizzled it over them for a little "kick."  I think I may add dried fruit to the next batch I cook up.  Thanks!

These were very moist but seemed a little bland to me. In the right setting, however, with coffee it might be just right.

I used all butter in place of shortening.  These really are the most soft and pillow-y cookies ever.  I think they'd be good with some spices in the dough, in addition to the cinnamon and sugar on top.

These are a little to bland as is so I added chocolate chips and skipped the cinnamon-sugar step (although I'm sure that would be good too). They were THE BEST chocolate chip cookies I've ever had!

These are fantastic! The second time I made them, I left them on a cooling rack and popped out to run some errands. By the time I got home, everyone had helped themselves and couldn’t stop talking about how good they were! I just used regular chopped walnuts and, like other commenters, I didn’t bother with the glass for the cinnamon sugar - I simply rolled the balls in the mixture and flattened them by hand.
