I just wanted to say that, seeing as this recipe has no reviews, that I have had cookies very, very similar to these and they were GREAT!  You would never guess they have black pepper in them.  I was reluctant to make these at first but I was baking Christmas cookies with my aunt, who had made them before from a recipe in a Mexican cookbook.  If this is a good recipe, then these cookies will tun out great.  Don't be scared of the pepper!

I was looking for a cookie recipe that I could make to bring somewhere that I could enjoy as well.  I'm always watching my weight so i wanted a low fat cookie that didn't taste low fat.  I tried this recipe and these cookies are fantastic.  This recipe will definately become one of my signature dishes from now on.  I couldn't find candied citron so i made my own version by boiling lemon peals and then simmering them in simple syrup (1 c sugar, 1 cup water) for about 20 minutes.  Everything turned out great.

Out of all the different types of cookies I made for Christmas, these were the most popular.  It was good to have a cookie that was a bit different from the rest.  Very easy to make.  Thanks for a great recipe, Mary!

Wicked good. In place of raisins and candied citron, I used what I had at home: dried cranberries, dried apricots and crystallized ginger. I made them for my husband to take on a fishing trip with his friends. They all loved them and one friend said he could eat nothing but these cookies for the rest of his life and be happy.  :-)

I own a country market/bakery and was asked by a customer for Black Pepper Cookies for Christmas. I choose this recipe and omitted the citron. Only drizzled icing over the cookies when cooled. These had a great spicey flavor with a crunchy outside but wonderfully soft inside. The customer who ordered them said they were very much like she remembered from her childhood in Germany. Other customers said they will be a cookie that they will ask for again next year when they place their cookie tray orders. Thanks for making my life simpler with this great recipe.

I have made these at Christmas many times; they are a German recipe, called Pfefferneuse(sp?). I rolled out the dough and cut them into Christmas cookie shapes, then made a decorator frosting and just piped the white frosting around the edges of the cookie just to emphasize the shape and add a bit of sweetness. Always a big hit! A great spicy cookie.

Even my husband, who doesn't like fruit in cookies, loves these! I doubled the amount of citron and subbed allspice and nutmeg for the cloves (sadly I discovered halfway through the recipe that I only had whole cloves), and used freshly ground black pepper. In the future I would use 3/4 or even 1 tsp pepper - I loved the aromatic flavor it provided!

Really good cookies. I coudn't taste the pepper in them, but alot of people could. I added a little bit of chocolate chips and not as many raisans as it called for because I was bringing it to a bbq with kids, but they went very quick.

Do NOT hesitate to make these! They are sooooo good! They are wonderfully spicy and the pepper adds something really wonderful. My husband was skeptical and a little worried when I told him that I was making black pepper cookies, but he actually loved them. I made them exactly as written, except for the citron since I couldn't find any. These are so flavorful, I can't imagine they even need it, but I'm sure it would be great if I do happen to find some. These cookies are loaded with raisins, almost too many (just my opinion). I might only use 2 cups for my next batch, but this is just my own preference. These are fantastic cookies-I highly recommend them.

This is an AMAZING cookie! I first made it for a cookie exchange game because I needed a cookie with unusual ingredients. It has become a family favorite that I make every year now. It’s excitingly different, versatile to suit your tastes and makes the home smell awesome while they’re baking!

So I just made these and yes they are yummy, but the void of fat in the mixture causes sticking on parchment. I'm not a fan of cooking on a greased cookie trays. Living in the desert with low dew points presents challenges that I work around. In a nut shell, parchment does work. Just get the cookie off quick time. The confection sprinkle on top after bake while hot is perfect. The picture shown for this recipe is inaccurate. Sorry.  Will I make it again? Heck yes. Get creative, and don't be afraid to increase spices for your particular. I did, and the house aroma is delish. Enjoy!

I made these and they were fantastic! I omitted the walnuts (not a fan of nuts in cookies) and in lieu of raisins and the citron (couldn't find it in my grocery store, oops) I used dried cherries. My coworkers gobbled them up! These cookies smell absolutely wonderful, also. Next time I make these, I might chop my dried cherries a bit (some pieces seemed too big) and I will chill the dough overnight. I was making these on Tuesday night for the next day and should have re-read the recipe sooner. Had I done this, I would have made the dough on Monday and chilled overnight to bake Tuesday. As it was, I could only chill the dough for an hour and that definitely wasn't enough. I can't wait to make these again!

My family makes these with white icing on top.  We are italian and it is Christmas must have.  Makes the whole house smell good.  Do not be afraid of the pepper, it just adds to the spice of the cookie and is not overpowering.  Everyone loves these.  Our recipe has cocoa too.  Chocolate version.
