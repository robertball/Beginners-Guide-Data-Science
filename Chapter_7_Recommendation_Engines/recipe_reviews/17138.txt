1.21.17  I like the combination of the ground beef and spicy pork sausage (I used Jimmy Dean Hot), but I think this could be improved by adding something to this base.  I could see a little spaghetti sauce, pizza sauce, tomato sauce, even salsa, just something to give this a little moisture...it's already cooked, but you still have to bake them.   I used a pretty good shot of Sriracha, but could even see adding some red pepper flakes if you want to kick it up even more!.  I think you could substitute some other cheeses for the American cheese,  I’ll try shredded  cheddar next time.   Also, watch your time in the oven.  Although the recipe says 15-20 minutes, mine were overcooked and a bit dry at 8 minutes; next time I’ll probably pull them out  of the oven at 5 minutes.  From an eye appeal perspective, I thought they needed something, so I added some chopped tomato which gave them a little pop of color, but you can use  your imagination of how to garnish, maybe some shredded cheese or chopped jalapeño, whatever...sky’s the limit there.
