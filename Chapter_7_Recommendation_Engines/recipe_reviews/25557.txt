Great applesauce cake!  This doesn't take long to bake - it's done in 35 minutes for a 9x13 pan.  For those who found it dry, maybe they overcooked it. I almost did! I upped the applesause by 1/2 cup and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown (decreasing the sugar by 1/2 cup).  I also added 1 chopped apple and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. It smelled great coming out of the oven.  For the icing I used Pumpkin Bar Icing from this site.  It's a cream cheese icing that tastes great and is very simple.

I was making these for my kids, so I made this into cupcakes and didn't add in the raisins and walnuts; although, I think I would have liked them more had I included these ingredients.  But, my kids liked them just as I made them, and they didn't last long in the house. I topped the cupcakes with Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting, also from this site.

The cake was very moist.  I made the cake without raisins or walnuts. It still turned out good.

Terrific recipe- this is a keeper.  I found the cake to be easy to make, very moist and delicious.  In the future I wouldnâ€™t bother making a frosting for this as it stands well on its own.   I made half the recipe resulting in 12 cupcakes.    Thanks for sharing!

I was expecting it to be a little more moist, but it had great flavor. I added chopped apple and made them into cupcakes. I halved the recipe and made about 10 cupcakes. I cut the sugar back and still thought it was very sweet. If I made the full recipe I would cut out about a 1/2 cup of sugar.

This is exactly how I imagined it would be. Delicious, irresistible,yummy! I didn't make any alterations per say, just a few additions out of choice. They are as follows: I used Bramley Apple  sauce, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white (coz the family didn't want anything too sweet), added 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/2 tsp allspice (coz we LOVE spice cakes), a little over 1/2 cup of currants instead of raisins, and skipped the walnuts (coz I didn't have any). So no changes that would alter the recipe so to say, just some minor substitutions. Thank you FUNN182, my house smells like the cosiest place ever, and the cake is 100% a keeper! Oh oh and I didn't frost it coz everyone was too impatient to dig in immediately!! =D

Wow! Made this for a birthday party and followed this recipe exactly.  It was so easy to make.  I topped it with cream cheese frosting and sprinkled chopped walnuts on the top. It went quickly at the party, everyone loved it, even a friend of mine who isn't a sweet lover had two slices!  I will make this again soon.  Thank you for the recipe.

Well, this was not my favorite. This is my first less then 5 stars I've ever given.  Didn't have a great deal of flaavor and was dry. I may have baked it a bit too long. My oven and I have issues. I don't think I'll make this again. I'll try another spice cake sometime.  It was easy but not didn't tickle my taste buds. Family thought it was O.K.

I made this for a large group of people (tripled the recipe) at a soup kitchen we help with.  They all loved it.  Families from our church even took some home! I may have cooked it too long or it could have been a little more moist.

Scaled this to 18 servings to make one 10" round cake and one 8X8 cake.  Took reviewers' suggestions and upped the applesauce (homemade from homegrown apples), cut back a little on the sugar, used jumbo fresh from the coop duck eggs, but had to delete the walnuts as I'm allergic.  Dry?  I think not!!!  Absolutely delicious!!!  Used 1/4 t. ground ginger (could have used a touch more) and frosted with cream cheese frosting.  Hubby just devoured the equivalent of 3 servings.  Am just grateful his cholesterol and weight is perfect so he can enjoy such delights!!!

I made mini muffins out of this recipe. They came out pretty tasty! Not as applesaucey as I thought they would be though. I didn't add raisins as I didn't have any in the pantry but the walnuts add a nice touch. Will make this again. maybe try a cake sheet next time.

This was moist and wonderful and had nice flavor. I will make again. I have to say to some ofthe posters, if you change to muffins or cupcakes and do not change baking time, or your oven is shot, don't blame the recipe because your cake is dry. I'm not trying to be snarky, just letting you know that the recipe is just fine AS DIRECTED.

4.5 stars people?  Do you not have taste buds?  This is a nice light yet moist cake, but 0 flavor.  2 cups of apple sauce & it doesn't even taste like apple.  Definitely needs cinnamon &/or other spices. Sorry :(

Delicious.  Made into cupcakes with spiced organic apple sauce instead of spices + sauce, and used honey for 1/4 of the sugar content. has some local organic pasty flour, and used local farm fresh eggs.  omitted nuts and raisins.  going to make a little drizzle glaze to put on the top.  cooking time aprox 15 min as cupcakes.  ...and boy are they good.

Very moist cake.  I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup and it was sweet enough.  I added some chopped apples and left out the walnuts.

We have made this recipe 4 times now.  It is moist and fairly easy to make.Last time we made it we let allrecipes increase th amounts to make(3) 8-inch round cakes (18 servings) and also made it extra healthy by substituting 1/3 the flour with lighter flours from the health food store. (We used unmeasured amounts of whole wheat pastry flour, brown rice flour and oat flour to make 1 cup (1/3 of the 18-serving recipe). We also ran out of applesauce, so we drained one can of 'lite' fruit cocktail and put it the food processor, which luckily turned into 1 cup of pureed fruit that had the same consistency of applesauce!  It worked great! One time we removed 2 Tablespoons of the sugar and replaced it with 2 Tablespoons of molasses.  This recipe is quite adaptable.....thanks Britney!

The flavor is great! I followed the recipe, however, I made them into muffins instead of cake. They're a little dry. I will try it again and perhaps add a little oil to the recipe to see if that helps.

Great tasting moist cake. I tossed in some pecans, dried cranberries, the ginger, a little allspice and baked it in a bundt pan until toothpick came out dryish. I used fresh made applesauce with no extra sugar and subbed in 1/2 cup of brown sugar for some white. Very tasty cake that will be made again!

This cake was ok. It was a little dry. It seemed the consistency of the batter was off. Maybe 1/2 cup less flour, more egg or butter. I don't know what the problem is. The flavor was good but the texture needs some tweaking.

Great recipe. I loved it. The only thing I did different was to substitute half of the white sugar for brown sugar. The applesauce I used was homemade from a recipe on this site that I highly recommend. "Sarah's Applesauce".

I made this for my Mom's birthday and everyone loved it.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe.  I made it into 2 round pans and made a layer cake and they only needed about 23-25 minutes at the most to bake.  Will make again for a delicious easy cake.

I added the ginger and thought it still bland. It was a fine cake, no major complaints, but no major compliments either.

Very simple and easy cake to make and tasted great too.  I added the ginger to give it a little kick.  Family loved it.  Will definitly make again!
