Thanks for sharing this awesome cookie recipe.  It was a nice change from the peanut blossoms. The only change that I made was that I used milk chocolate almond kisses. I entered these cookies in our local newspaper's Christmas Cookie contest and got second place!

These were wonderful.  I found Hershey's dark chocolate kisses and used those.  The flavors of almond, dark chocolate and raspberry went so well together.  These did not last long in my house.

can you help me out with the equivalent of "all purpose" flour. I'm in New Zealand and am familiar with our plain-(standard and high grade),and self raising. as there is no baking powder in your recipe I'm presuming maybe mistakenly that it is self raising flour thats used.but perhaps the baking soda is taking the place of baking powder?(raising agent).I would love to try this recipe but the correct ingredients are essential and I wouldn't want to spoil it for the want of using the "correct grade"  flour.HELP! :-)
 I'll be happy to post the result after "the event" but I love the sound of "almond" one of  my favourite flavours and sounds like a 5 to me :-)

Nice cookies! I had part of a bag of kisses leftover from baking "Peanut Butter Kiss Cookies" from this site and decided to try this recipe. My hubby loves raspberry and almond flavor, so I knew this was a good choice. I used my 1.5 Tbsp. cookie scoop to measure out the balls and came out with 27 cookies. For the glaze, I did have to add an extra 1 1/2 tsp. milk to get to drizzling consistency. I put the glaze in a baggie, snipped off the corner and squeezed it on in a zig-zag. I was a little disappointed in the cookie part, it was hard and dry. However, I do love the flavor combination and the fact that they are very pretty. Great for Valentine's Day!

very good and easy!! I used Brach's chocolate stars instead of kisses and skipped the glaze. Doubled the recipe and made them small and it made exactly 6 doz. Baked for 10 minutes.

I loved the gentle raspberry flavor in the pink icing.  it does add the raspberry to the gookie in a yummy way.  Made exactly as written with excellent results.  I'll make these again.

This was a great recipe! I didn't have to chill the dough, but maybe it was because I used marg instead of butter? I also added a 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the glaze instead of 1/4. 

VERY YUMMY!

Very very tasty. Might need to add more levening to the dough (I'm at high altitude 6200ft) as they turned out too flat and crunchy for cookie texture.  The sugar-covered dough balls baked up flat and the sugar coating melted in with the butter.  Absolutely delish none-the-less.

I had this recipe years ago and lost it--this sounds very close to the one I remember, the frosting being the only difference. They were perfect! --moist, chewy with just a hint of almond flavor in the cookie base. I thought I'd never make these again, so glad it was here!

I loved this recipe! It was very easy, and the cookies were delish. I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry (because I couldn't find any) and sprinkled a few white chocolate chips into the batter instead of using kisses.

thanks m.e. blevins and other reviewers.  used kisses w/ almonds and - after reading other reviews of hard, dry cookies- added an extra egg yolk to help make the cookies a little softer.  try it, it works.  throw the "frosting" in the fridge for a bit for neater piping. these cookies make me happy:-)

I tried this recipe out for a different type of cookie to make rather than the same old stuff.  But, unfortunately, I was not fond of this.  I think the almond extract should be increased as I could still smell the flour and eggs after baking. The kisses and drizzle part tasted average. It was ok.  Thanks.

I MADE THESE COOKIES TODAY WITH MY GRANCHILDREN. THEY WERE GREAT. MINE WERE SOFT AND CHEWY, BUT I ONLY BAKED THEM FOR 8 MIN. NEXT TIME INSTEAD OF THE RASPBERRY JELLY. I AM GOING TO USE MARACHINO CHERRY JUICE.  I THINK IT WILL TASTE LIKE A CHOCOLATE COVERED CHERRY. GREAT COOKIE. THANKS

These cookies were great!  When I started rolling them I thought the batter was a little crumbly so I added 1 Tablespoon of milk which helped.  However, after baking I couldn't tell the difference from the 2 cookies I rolled without milk from the rest.  So it probably didn't need it, just made it easier to work with.  So besides that I wouldn't change a thing!  They came out perfect, definately will be a keeper in my book.

These cookies were a big hit both times I made them.  Don't let the dryness of the dough scare you.  It was very dry and crumbly, but with the warmth of my hands, I pushed it together to form the ball and they came out beautiful!  Don't be shy with the drizzle either.  Make sure you put enough on each cookie for a good combination of raspberry and almond in each bite.  Thank you for great alternatiave to the traditional Kiss cookie.  This recipe is a keeper!

These were really good.  I took them into work and everyone loved them and I got asked for the recipe.  I did use dark chocolate kisses in place of milk chocolate.

Love ALMOND flavored anything and these cookies are great. Not really a chocloate person but used kisses anyway. However these would be great almond sugar cookies by themselves. Next time I will be trying a cup of chopped almonds to the cookie batch. :)

The raspberry drizzle needed to be thinned considerably to work with and there was no raspberry flavor to be tasted.  Watch your cooking time too because they will become hard as rocks.  However, the almond flavor was delicate and delightful, overall I did like the cookies but unsure if I'll do them again.  Have to revamp that raspberry though…..it would have been better to just use food coloring!

Variation- When I got to the part where I was supposed to add the almond extract I noticed my bottle was empty! Not wanting to stop & go to the store I found some coconut extract and decided to go that route. I even added some shredded coconut to the mix. Mix was a bit dry, so I added some drops of water. It worked. My kids went nuts over them. For the glaze I just used vanilla. They were really good. Next time I'll have the almond though, that sounds even better to me.

The only change I made was using Special Dark chocolate Kisses instead of regular kisses.  Everyone RAVED about them!  I agree that the dough seemed crumbly when I took it out of the fridge, but it did form balls easily.  I baked for only 9 minutes and they turned out great!  I'll be making them again for sure.

4.5 stars for the variation I made on this recipe to make an Autumn cookie using this as a base.  Instead of almond ext., I used vanilla ext., and used a pumpkin spice kiss in the center.  I added a shake of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter to go along with the theme.  I added 2 T. of milk to the batter to avoid the dry, crumbly cookie that many reviewers complained about...no dry cookies here!  Thank  you for the base recipe to fuel my creativity.   This recipe made 36 very good cookies.

This recipe was an awesome one! I wanted something different and this provided. I don't actually like peanut butter cookies so this concept was great. Just a few critiques though. First the dough was so dry I couldn't get it stick. So I had to add about a tablespoon of water to the dough. It was still very dry but after that I was able to get it to stick decently. I would start with adding a teaspoon of and move your way up. An oil would probably work better but I didn't have any in arms reach. I also didn't have raspberry jam, but I had a berry blend. Turned out great, I think any tart berry jam would work we.. Finally I took other's advice and used dark chocolate kisses because I just really like dark chocolate. Huge hit. You only need one small bag. I apparently made my cookies small and it made about 65 cookies, so you get a lot out of this recipe.

This is a light, delicious little cookie! I often serve ice cream with a cookie standing in the middle, and this was a hit. I subbed strawberry jam for raspberry; otherwise, followed the recipe.  I did have to add a little more milk to the drizzle, but that's not unusual. They are just as good without the Kiss.

These turned out very tasty!  I always try to make baked goods healthier so I substituted 2 tbsp butter for applesauce and used splenda brown sugar and they were a hit at a family bbq! I also used Hugs Hershey kisses in some of them which turned out great!

Absolutely delicious flavor. The almond really makes it. I found the dough to be too dry so I added another half stick of butter. My cookies came out a bit flat (due to the additional butter I think.) Also I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry, which was just as delicious. I also used Hershey's hugs. I'd recommend freezing or chilling the hugs first since they melt when placed on the warm cookies. All in all a great recipe with a few modifications.

I was very excited to try these cookies. The dough tasted GREAT! I was a little disappointed that the cookies were not a little more soft and chewy. Also, the raspberry glaze tasted like cough syrup, but that could have been the jam I used. Other than that I love Almond and Dark Chocolate together! (I used Hershey's Special Dark Kisses).

They are not as tasty as you think, also you have to make the balls really small and then kind of flat. I kept mind round thinking they would spread and they didn't. When I pushed the kiss in they fell apart, not just cracked. So, I had to not use the rest of the kisses and say they were little biscotti cookies and people believed me and liked them with coffee. won't make them again. but they look really good.

I liked the flavor of these but they were too sweet for me. I would cut back to 1/3 of a cup of each sugar next time. the shape of mine turned out a bit flatter than the picture shows also

Tasty! Crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside with an awesome almond flavor and this great hint of raspberry.

Awesome cookies! I made these exactly as the recipe says. Everybody in the family loves them. Even my picky kids! I made them 3 times in less than 2 weeks. Love them with, or without the kisses.

After reading a few reviews I made these cookies with dark chocolate kisses instead of the recommended milk chocolate kisses and I liked the combination of flavors. I'm someone who typically loves to eat tons and tons of cookies, but these cookies were so sweet that after one cookie I knew I had to stop. For the first dozen cookies I forgot to add almond extract to the drizzle, and I ended up liking that batch better. If I make them again I'll probably tinker with the combination/recipe a bit. I'm curious if almond flour would work within this recipe.
