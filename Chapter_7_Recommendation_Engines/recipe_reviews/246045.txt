I made this tonight with fresh eggs from a friend's hens and fresh herbs from my garden. I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting mozzarella for the scamorza.  It was the best thing I have eaten in a long time, and possibly the most delicious meal I have ever cooked. Light but filling, the eggs fluff up like a souffle, and the combination of the herbs is beautiful. It even smells fantastic. Many thanks for sharing this incredible recipe.

Excellent recipe that I will make again. I didn't have any scamorza on hand, strangely enough, so I used a bag of grated mixed Italian cheeses and it was great.  I also topped it with finely sliced sage leaves, since all the herbs were from my own garden and I had some lovely sage growing.

I could not find Scamorza cheese so I substituted with Mozzarella.  I left out the mint and honey, and added in some tomatoes, asparagus, and baby bella mushrooms!  This was amazingly good, you can add whatever you like to this recipe!  The fresh herbs make the dish!

I also added cooked red onions, red peppers, garlic and spinach to make more of a veggie frittata.  Used cheese I had which was shredded mozarella & cheddar.  I didn't put in the mint.   I put mine in a pie plate and it took close to 50 mins. in preheated oven.  It did puff up nicely - over 2" and edges were browned, so it looked nice.   Greek yogurt gave a nice texture and all my guests loved it.  I didn't have honey so I used agave and I didn't care for the sweet taste at all - would leave it out next time.   Just give it more time!

Excellent recipe!  I added chopped ham, onion and broccoli (which I cooked slightly first)  Very easy to make, very flavorful.  Will definitely add this to my rotation.  I did not use the lemon juice in the yogurt, only the honey.  You could add virtually any of your favorite herbs, meats, veggies.
