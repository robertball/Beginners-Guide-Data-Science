Really loved having this on the counter. Smelled so good! Tasted even better. Added a lot of celery for extra chunks. Two bay leaves are important to the taste of this dish. Pearl barley was so delicious to this soup.

A very hearty satisfying soup!  I made this soup with things on hand. I was concerned that some reviewers said that the soup had "no flavor" so I went a little heavier on the onions (one medium) and 2 more cloves of garlic as well as adding a  1/4 tsp of black pepper. I did use left over tomato sauce from a jar probably closer to 2 cups, and since I didn't have any beef stock on hand I used Knorr beef bullion for the equivalent of the 32 ounces . I pre- browned my beef  seasoned with garlic pepper and onion powder (only had a a little over a pound) and used 2x's the mushrooms, (baby portabellas). Finally added a 1/4 cup Brandy (instead of wine)  into the mix . The end result was a fabulous rich and flavorful soup. I will definitely make this again .

UPDATE: after writing my original review my husband and I heated the leftovers up for lunch. It had a very weird almost slimy texture to it. Maybe the barley breaking down a bit too much overnight. Very unpleasant. I'd possibly make this again (with changes) but definitely not save any leftovers.  

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Made this yesterday and my family thought it was ok. If I make it again I'll add some spices or heavily season the beef and then sear first to add more flavor. I would also add celery. I found the recipe as written to be tasty but a bit bland. I'll make it again with subtle changes and see how it goes. It sure made the kitchen smell great!

This is a very hearty soup!  I thought it was a little bland, so I added 1 T Worcester sauce, 1 t each of beef and mushroom "Better Than Bouillon" and 1/4 C red wine. Delicious paired with a crusty roll and red wine.

This was very flavorful. I did not use the barley-I cooked it and rice on the side (I loathe barley) and let everyone add what the wanted and how much. There is no need to change a thing. Everyone loved it

The soup was delicious. I followed the recipe with some minor additions based on some of the reviews.       I waited to add the barley till  there was 2 hrs of cooking time left. It was done in an effort to keep the barley from absorbing all the broth.       Added a pack of Extra Beefy Lipton Onion Soup Mix, Worcestershire sauce, and some red pepper flakes all for flavor. Served with shredded Swiss cheese melted on top and  a crusty sour dough bread     I would not hesitate to make this again

I find the tomato soup to be a bit off putting and sweet, so I use about 1/2 cup of split peas & other spices to kick it up a bit. I also use beef shank or beef neck bones to add additional flavor. Cook the bones until the meat basically falls off the bone. Delicious!

I don't know what some of the other reviewers are talking about when they say this has no taste.  It's perfect.  The only change I made was that I used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce.  There was no slime on the top from leftovers (the barley should be washed before you put it into this dish.  This was a perfect old fashioned thick Beef Barley soup!! I will try a little wine next time I think that would add a nice taste.

I actually made this on the stove top, so I sauteed the beef and then added the vegetables to saute for a bit before adding everything else.  I made a double batch and found that doubling the barley made it much to thick and I had to add more beef stock, but it was unbelievably delicious. I will definitely make again!

This was pretty good.  I think I would have liked it better if I had browned the meat first.  I added a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning.  Also, a dietitian friend said not to add starches to a crockpot until near the end of cooking time so I added the barley with an hour left to cook.

Instead of one full cup of water, I used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup red wine. I used 8oz baby bella mushrooms, instead of 6oz, and served with cracked salt and pepper on top, and with crusty bread. Delicious!

Very hearty! I made a few changes per other cooks suggestions.  I used twice the beef broth because the barley absorbs so much liquid.  I used ground beef instead of the sirloin. Used a whole onion, added a few celery sticks, a few teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce and twice the garlic.  And a few more mushrooms.  Didn't use any tomato sauce.  I wanted it to have more of a creamy texture and it did.  Will definitely make again! Leftovers were great too.

Made per the recipe, however used 8oz of mushrooms and 2 good tbsp  of Worcestershire sauce plus 2-3 sticks chopped celery. Pearl Barley worked well for me! Hot buttered bread for 'dunking'  Yummy!!

This is the best beef stew recipe I've found. I've tried several recipes and they never turned out quite like I'd hoped. This stew, though, definitely hits the mark!

I made the soup according to the recipe (I always follow the recipe the first time I make it) except for the fact that I substituted the beef broth that I had on hand for the beef stock. The soup came out a little bland (perhaps because of the beef broth substitution). After tasting the soup I added a little Cholula sauce to give it a little spice. The soup was really tasty. I will definitely make it again, next time with beef stock and some red wine. And since I grew up in Baltimore, I may consider the Old Bay seasoning mentioned in another review.

I have a small crock pot and wanted to increase the veggies, so I used half the amount of beef and roughly chopped a fennel bulb to add. Also tasty, I stirred in some fresh thyme sprigs to the mix :)

A very good, hearty stew.  I leave out the carrots (can't stand cooked carrots) and tend to double the mushrooms (one pack white button and one pack portabella) but that's just personal tastes.  I've also successfully substituted basic stew meat for lower costs, but that definitely makes for a 'put on at 6AM and cook on low for 12 hours' kind of setup for the meat to come out tender.

Will have to work on more flavor, recipe is a little bland. Other than that it was good and very easy.

I loved this soup. Made it for my soup club at work and all enjoyed it. I did add more tomato sauce and onion and I keep my barley out of the soup until I am ready to eat it. Love barley, but it soaks up all the delicious broth.

My family loved it!! I did put in half the meat when I made a double batch.  Next time I am adding more liquid because mine came out a little too stew like rather than soup. Definitely making again!

It was easy and very good. I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used V-8 juice.

Made this the other day and it was great.  I did add a good tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  Gave it a little bit of a kick as I am unable to eat onions, peppers, etc.  Will definitely make again.

I made it as shown with the only additions being Worchester and extra onions and mushrooms. I did use barley, which I think might have been the deal-killer. The sliminess created by the barley was just not pleasing for us, just made it gummy and bland, I think. If I make this again, I think I will add cooked rice or pasta after the meat mixture has simmered in the crockpot.

I added some items some Sherry,  Beef onion soup mix, corn, celery and Magis. Nice tomato paste because I didn't have any tomato sauce and I thought it would be richer. I also Browned the meat

I think this is a good recipe but needs to have less barley.  I would do everything the same but with half the barley.  It smelled delicious all day but was a little disappointing when I didn't need a spoon.  I will try it again but with half the barley.

We thought the barley was overpowering. Very boring taste. Followed the recipe- only addition was some red wine which didn't help. So disappointed!
