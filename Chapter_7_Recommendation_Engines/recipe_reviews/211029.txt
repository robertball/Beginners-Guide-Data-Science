This is the same recipe that I found in a newspaper several years ago. I make this on a regular basis. It is so-o-o easy and very, very good. My kids LOVE it. The only thing that I have changed is that I use mini ravioli's and I don't use Ragu spaghetti sauce. I use whichever sauce I find on sale.  The picture that is posted with this recipe does not look anything like this dish.

Quick and easy with minimal clean up.   I happened to have fresh spinach so I added that in also.  I agree with another user that any sauce will do.  Added fresh parmesan at the end.

Good idea to add the heavy cream to the sauce, but way too watery when cooked as recipe says. I will do this again, but I will just boil the ravioli, and warm the sauce and cream in a saucepan. Sorry...two pans were neccessary for this one.

This was so incredibly easy and it tasted wonderful. In my quest to lighten my cooking duties on the weekdays, I ran across this recipe, and I thought it was worth trying. I am so glad I did. It was a nice change from simple spaghetti for a quick meal. I used the mini cheese raviolis and Hunt's traditional sauce because it was on sale. I also used whipping cream. I didn't know whether to drain the water out of cooked pasta or not because the recipe doesn't say, so I did not. It turned out wonderful served with a salad and buttered french bread. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for such a great tasting and simple meal!

we used a bad pasta sauce (should've gone with a regular marinara)...we WILL be trying this easy skillet ravioli again...i was a little nervous leaving the water in as well after boiling the raviolis, but it ended up being the perfect consistency...

pretty well cooked it up as the recipe calls for. Girlfriend liked it, I found it to be kind of tasteless. Easy to make though

The overall recipe is good but I didn't like the flavor of Ragu. Made with homemade sauce it would be good.
