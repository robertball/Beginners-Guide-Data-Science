Used fresh broccoli because this is what we had on hand. Steamed it in our veggie steamer then followed recipe as directed. It turned out great!

********** from rd4565 **************

My original recipe is for 4x this and I made an error in converting it. The cream cheese should be 12 oz not 8 oz. Sorry for the error.

Made this for Thanksgiving. It was good, but needed maybe another half package more cream cheese, less bread crumbs and some salt!!

This was so dry and bland. I would recommend using additional cream cheese.

I really enjoyed this. I only used the one bag of broccoli florets and made my own bread crumbs from whole wheat bread. This dish was very good and I plan on making this alot. It was very good leftover too. My hubby liked it too.

I doubled the recipe and used a 32-oz. package of florets without adding the chopped broccoli. Also, I had on hand a tub of garden vegetable cream cheese and one regular block of cream cheese and used that. Otherwise, I didnâ€™t double the toppings or almonds and it still looked great. Took it to a church potluck luncheon. Very pleased with this recipe

This is a good side vegetable dish when you are looking to change things up.  I made a portion of the amount and after reading reviews, I increased the amount of cream cheese.  I didn't have slivered almonds so I just chopped some and added it to the buttered breadcrumbs.
