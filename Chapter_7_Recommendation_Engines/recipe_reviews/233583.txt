AWESOME! These were kind of a spur of the moment thing, so I had to do a few things differently...First, I only had a bag of salad shrimp, so I also added a package of imitation crab that I chopped up. I sauteed them both w/ the oil and seasonings just to warm them through. I didn't have restaurant style tortillas, so I used bite sized round ones. Lastly, I didn't have an avocado, so I made 'Spicy Cilantro Dressing' from this site to put on top, which was perfect for these!  I can only imagine how good these are made as written, b/c they were great w/ all of my changes. The family really loved these...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

There is some advanced prep needed for this recipe but it's well worth it. This makes an impressive appetizer for company. I used chopped green onions instead of cilantro, sliced the jalapeño a little thicker for crunch, and recommend cutting back a little on the lemon juice because it was too tart for me. Everyone was impressed.

Good recipe.  I used fresh North Carolina shrimp.  I always use fresh NC seafood.  Cindy must like her seafood frozen and from overseas. Thanks.

Thank you John for taking the time to post this recipe. I have not had the opportunity to try it yet but it sounds great! I am so sorry that there people that have no class such as "Cindy" and talk in such a way as to belittle your efforts....again thank you for your time.

Made these for a super bowl party and they were the favorite! Hardest part wasn't eating them on the way there. Made them exactly as the recipe called, well worth the effort!

These were yummy.  I added lime, salt and cayenne to the avocado creama, turned out great!  Oh, and used colby jack cheese.

We loved these!  The only thing I did differently was chop the jalapeno and sprinkled it instead of slicing but still made a very pretty presentation. I will be making these again for Christmas, and I think I will add some cilantro and lime to the avocado  cream sauce as another suggested.

This sounds wonderful.  I am going to give a try this weekend.
I am thinking about using a tomato/cilantro or some other type of 12 inch flour tortilla instead of the single tortilla chips and then baking it on a pizza stone.

Delicious! Much tastier than regular nachos. I forgot to use the avocado-cream sauce but it was great without it. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!

These are good.  I did not make each serving individual as the recipe instructed, but I did use the given ingredients.  I just chopped everything bite size and sprinkled each one over the chips.  I put the jalapenos and tomatoes on top of the cheese to cut down on moisture.  I was skeptical of my own choice when I opened a can of pickled beets as a side dish, but it worked out very well.

You can make this quickly and it's pretty and worth the effort. We had some pickled jalapeños from a Christmas present and used those to save time. Yum! Will make again. Everyone raved.

Taste good, but not quite worth the work I think.
