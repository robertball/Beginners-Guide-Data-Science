Made this recipe mostly as directed - only exceptions being I added the potatoes from the beginning of the oven time as well as tossed in some carrots to the mix.  Smelled mouthwatering while roasting and we really enjoyed it, but I think I'll add a tad more garlic and maybe some rosemary the next time.

Awesome!!! Just add the potatoes when you put the roast in the oven... mine weren't cooked so I had to turn up the heat and cook longer...

I used a 2 lb beef roast and it was cooked perfectly to Medium in the first 2 hours. While this was a nice surprise, I wish I didn't trust the timing and checked periodically, because as it stands now, the potatoes are not cooked and I have a roast that's "getting happy" out of the oven.

I made this in an electric pressure cooker.  I marinated the beef for a couple of hours in  2 bottles of Guinness's.  I took it out of the marinade, dried it off and slathered it with fresh ground black pepper and fresh ground sea salt (I don't use much salt) thyme, rosemary, arrow root, onion and garlic powder some whole grain mustard and some tomato paste.  I put oil in the hot pot and browned all sides of the roast.  I took the roast out of the pot, saut√©ed some scallion, celery and fresh garlic.  I put in the potatoes and carrots and let them get a little color, not much really.  I then put the meat and a mix of Guinness and low sodium free range organic chicken stock and a bay leaf some flour and a little brown sugar.  I put the lid on and an hour later we had a VERY TENDER delicious roast, I probably didn't use enough flour as the sauce didn't thicken, but it was delicious.  I think what took the longest was chopping the veggies.

Mine was done in the 2 hours too.  Even when I had the taters in from the start, they still weren't done, so after transferring meat and pan juices, I cranked the oven up to 350 for a bit for a beautiful crispy coating.

Easy and delicious!  I cooked it longer so it would be more tender.

Added onion to the roasting pan and garlic in the marinade. May add some A1 to the marinade next time. Needed some tang, but was still delicious!

This was an awesome roast! I didn't have Guiness so I used a bottle of Coke. Turned out fabulous.
