This was great.  We took the advice of the first review, skipped the egg noodles and turned it into taco stuffing.  Burrito stuffing would be great as well. I also exchanged the spices and ued a taco spice already made up.

No Yolks Skillet Salsa Chicken Haiku: "Followed recipe, cept cubed chicken breast, not ground. Thought it was quite good!" Made this as directed only using 2 chicken breast halves instead of the 1/2 lb. of ground. Served on top of the noodles w/ cheddar cheese, green onions and cilantro, and it was really tasty, but we all agreed that we would've preferred the chicken/bean/corn "guts" either wrapped in a tortilla or spooned over rice. We just didn't think that No Yolks jived w/ the Southwestern flavors of this dish.

I will definitely make again.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Thanks so much for the easy recipe.  Served over rice with light sour cream and shredded cheese.  I used ground chicken breast, did not use the salt, and added 3/4 tsp garlic powder.

yummy.  you could also substitute rice. I didn't have any salsa so I used a can of rotel tomatoes and green chilis with some taco sauce and it turned out great.

Really good but a little spicy from the chili powder. Will cut it in half next time. Used an entire can of beans and half a can of corn.

Made it per recipe.  It tasted wonderful.  All five kids liked it.  I would not use the pasta again.  Didn't taste bad, just an odd combo.  We will serve it over rice, in a taco, in a burrito, over chips, or as a lettuce wrap.  Very healthy and crowd pleasing

Very good! I made the meat mix exactly as it read but mixed in a bag of Uncle Bens precooked brown Santa Fe rice (instead of noodles) and it was wonderful. We all ate it differently. 7 year old on tortilla chips like nachos, husband on a tortilla, and me over a bed of lettuce.

Made with a mix of beans since the grocery store has no black beans but I am sure it made no difference. Great week day meal.
