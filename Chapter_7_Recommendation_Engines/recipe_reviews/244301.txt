Not a fan of cooked onions, so I omitted those, otherwise I made it to the recipe. We are all quite fond of this recipe and it's even better with lettuce, salsa, and cheese dip on top.  Or lettuce and panchos tropicale dressing. Yum.

Really good, didn't give 5 stars as had to cook almost twice as long in the oven and still a little doughy. Overall very good and will make again!

We loved this. I like that you can play with the ingredients and make it your own. What a great recipe for those days you want to get dinner done quickly.

I tried this recipe and it was my first time attempting a taco ring and I loved it!! Some people say it didn’t have much flavor but with the toppings I used (sour cream, mild salsa, and lettuce) it was full of flavor! I portioned everything exactly and followed all directions and it turned out so yummy! I recommend to anyone especially to anyone trying it for the first time!

Total hit!! My family and brother in law loved it! Even my son who has Ausbergers liked it! I did not bake the cheese in it. Instead I doubled the meat. Baked up awesome! I piled shredded iceberg lettuce in the center and then had condiments on the side: cheese, sour cream, fresh chopped tomatoes, sliced black olives and organic salsa. I am 100% positively making this again!

There wasn't much taste to this so anyone making it would need to consider extra spicing to taste.  While I love crescent rolls, they were not able to stand up to the filling and became soggy very quickly, which was a turn-off for the diners.  I give it three stars because it was so simple to make, but I don't believe I will try it again; while I can change the spices, I don't know of any way to rescue the doughy consistency.

I mix an equal amount of riced cauliflower in with the meat.  The kids don't notice and it makes me feel like it's not as unhealthy.  ;-)

This was a great recipe! I used a pizza stone and had no difficulty with sogginess. We will be making this again, soon.

Made this many times. Love that I can change it up depending on what I have on hand. Tonight used Southwest seasoning and 1 cup salsa in the ground beef and it was yummy!

My husband and I cook for our daughter and her children on weeknights. We get in a rut and decided to try this recipe. My husband doesn’t eat tacos, but was willing to try this, since the rest of the family loves them. It turned out perfect and we had no leftovers. I’m pretty sure my husband had more than his fair share! My only complaint was that my pizza stone was not quite big enough, so we had some hang over and forgot to put foil under it to catch the drippings. We set off the smoke alarm and had a dirty oven to clean. Excellent meal though.

I followed the recipe pretty much,  except added black  olives & green onion to the dough before folding.  It was delish and everyone raved over it...they gobbled it up in no time!  Will make again for sure!

It was fairly easy to make and tasted ok.  I will make it again but will add something more to the inside as it was on the dry side.  Definitely serve it with sour cream or something.

This is the second time I’ve made this and I really don’t care for it. I think taco meat and the sweet crescents don’t pair well. I like the idea it’s cool, but we don’t like the sweet bread with  salty meat

I use the entire package of taco seasoning. This was the SALTIEST thing I ever tasted in my life. It was disgusting. I still want to make it, but this time will cut way down on seasoning mix.

Really good and really tasty recipe. Making it for the first time I had trouble with the spacing of the crescent roll pieces but that’s more of a personal problem. I definitely suggest a side of salsa for dipping.

We made this at the recipe calls for. We enjoyed this recipe. The only issue I ran into was the crescent rolls were a little soggy on the bottom.

So easy to make! The sweet dough tastes a bit odd, with the spicy beef, but after a few bites, we were all convinced, and this dinner disappeared fast! Very versatile, as everyone can add their favourite toppings.

I did this the first time from the Pillsbury recipe. I just adjusted the ingredients to our liking and wow what a meal!
