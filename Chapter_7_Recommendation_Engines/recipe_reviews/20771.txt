This is one of my favorite party apps.  Although I use only 1 package of cream cheese and I mix a package of dry Ranch dressing mix instead of the dill - it's delicious and there's never a single bite left!

This was pretty good. I liked that I could bake the crust the night before the party. I even prepared the cream cheese mixture and left it in the fridge overnight. However, I made it again with a few variations: skip the mayo, use a little less cream cheese and put in a cup of sour cream. the dill stays though- yum! everyone liked this easy appetizer.

After the cream cheese topping, I just added finely chopped broccoli and then topped with grated cheddar cheese.  It was delicious.

i changed the "sauce" a bit:  1 8 oz package of neufchatel light cream cheese, 1/2 cup of light mayo, and one package of dry ranch dressing mix.  the veggies i used were broccoli, mushrooms, yellow pepper, and i added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese on top.  delicious!  i always get requests for the recipe.

This was very easy to make and very tasty.  You can really make a variety of tastes by using different veggies.  Do remember to finely chop your veggies.

I made this for my daugther's birthday party at the park last April.  The moms loved it, the children of course didn't touch it.  My husband loved it as well.  After I topped the pizza with cheese and veggies I put it in the oven long enough to melt the cheese.  Thanks for the recipe I'm going to make it for my Bunko party this week.

I don't particularly care for the dill. I mix a little chili powder and canned fire-roasted mild green chili's into the cream cheese, no mayo needed. One of my favorite veggy toppings for this is the broccoli slaw they sell in a bag at the store.  It is easy to eat and colorful (has carrot strips mixed in.) You have to press it into the cream cheese a bit though and not go overboard with the slaw or it gets everywhere. This "pizza" never fails to draw rave reviews at potlucks.

I think it needed a lighter crust.  I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 cream cheese and I think that was the right consistency.

I made this to use up some crescent dough we didn't use at Christmas.  I made it with yogurt instead of mayo, topped with onion, green pepper, cilantro, and jalapeno (fresh vegetables I had on hand).  Wonderful!

I substituted one package of Philladelphia Herb & Garlic Cream Cheese Spread for the "sauce" and it was amazing! I whipped it with the electric mixer to make it "fluffy" and easy to spread. My family loved it and I will definitely be making it again and in greater supply as it disappeared fast.

I baked the dough for 9 minutes which almost too long in my oven.  I added garlic salt to the cream cheese/mayo mixture.  I topped mine with finely chopped cauliflower, broccoli, green pepper, red onion, carrots, cucumber, and cheddar cheese.  It was a big hit.  I will def. make this again and might use sour cream next time as others have suggested.

I make something very similar and it's oh so yummy!   I only use cream cheese, and instead of dill, I use a package of good seasonings italian dressing mix.   I top mine with chopped broccoli, cauliflower, green & red peppers, onion and cherry tomatoes.  You can also purchase the garlic crescent rolls for even more flavor! Great way to get the kids to eat their veggies, after all it is pizza!

Really good, though I used sourcream instead of mayo like suggested, maybe I'll use mayo next time to add some tartness. I mixed shredded chedder cheese with the cream cheese mixture and added some garlic (powder or minced). Veggies-broccoli and  green pepper and sprinkled chopped chives over top! This recipe is a lot like the Pampered Chef, almost exactly, I think.

Love it! especially loved the idea to use sour cream instead of all that cream cheese. Easier to spread with the sour cream and adds the right amount of tang.

A huge hit with everyone, even people who don't like vegetables and those who didn't think it looked good, still loved the taste...the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of five is because I don't like it with crescent roll dough, I make a homemade pizza crust instead, it is 100x better!

I used one container of light garden vegetable cream and one regular. I didn't have any mayo, so I added sour cream instead. I topped the pizza w/ chopped broccoli, mushroom, green onions, and Italian cheese Crumbles. Pretty tasty, but it could use more herbs...it was a bit bland. Will try again.

I love the dill.  I've made the one with ranch dressing before and it doesn't have the extra kick that the dill does.  I've made this multiple times and it's always a hit.

I followed the suggestions about all the finely chopped veggies on top. I ground up dill seed instead of dill weed and it still turned out ok, although I think the dill would have had more flavor. I used regular onions instead of green onions because I didn't have them. Still good. I sliced a tomato into fine slices and placed them on the pizza for each "piece." Everyone loved them. I give 4 only because the dough got soggy by the end of the evening. Quick, easy, healthy recipe. (Especially if you use fat free cream cheese and mayo.)

if you use a food processor, you can chop up broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, mushrooms, onion etc very fine and the veggies stay on top better. I add finely shredded cheese on top as well.
