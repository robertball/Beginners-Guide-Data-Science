I changed the recipe around and it turned out fabulous! I did not use carrot. I rinsed and drained the black beans (instead of kidney beans) and fried them with the onion, green pepper, lots of cumin and chili pepper, and garlic. Then I combined the bean mixture with the flour, about 1/4 cup of sala, more chili pepper, 1/4 cup of cilantro (this really made it), and 1/2 a cup of rolled oats instead of breadcrumbs (so much healthier!). They formed perfectly into burgers and I coated them with hot sauces and I baked them for 15 minutes. Delicious!

Edit: I made this again the same as above, but this time I combined oats AND cooked brown rice until the consistency was right. I think it was even better!

I've never made my own veggie burgers myself and was scared to try, but this was quick and easy.  However, I kind of figured 2 cups of salsa would be way too much, so I used only 1 and it was exactly right.  I also used black beans because we love them, a red bell pepper instead of green, and took another reviewers suggestion to cook the chopped onions and peppers first so they wouldn't be crunchy.  I got eight nice patties out of this and fried them.  Served them on buns with a little sour cream and shredded cheese.

These are awesome!  I used to get a delicious black bean burger at a restaurant in OKC and have been looking for an equivalent/replacement here at home.  Finally found it!  (Happy dance!)  I did make a few modifications - based on others recommendations and my personal taste.  First - I used black beans (which I drained and rinsed really well.)  Then I chopped the carrots and sauteed them w/ the chopped onions, garlic and some cumin - and I replaced the bell pepper w/ chopped green chili.  And threw in a few squirts of Tabasco Chipotle sauce.  I also suggest starting w/ 1/2 cup of salsa at the end and building from there to the right consistency.  Sear the burgers and then drop the temp in the pan and cook slowly to cook all the way through.  The flavor is fantastic and my husband and I loved it.  7 year old stepdaughter liked it "a whole lot."  We followed the recommended serving suggestions and really enjoyed dinner tonight!  Thanks Valerie!

I changed a few things in this recipe but it still came out pretty well.  I saut√©ed the green peppers beforehand as I didn't want them to be too crunchy.  I also took another reviewer's advice and coated the patties in cornmeal before frying - that was an excellent tip.  The serving suggestion of lettuce, avocado and sour cream was also great.  The only reason I'm giving this recipe four stars instead of five is that I found it a little bit difficult.  The patties didn't hold together very well until I added some egg to the mixture.  I will definitely make it again, though.

Update: I am changing my rating to five stars because I have been making this recipe regularly and with a little bit of practice it is really not difficult at all.  In fact, it has become a household favourite!

I use less salsa and more bread crumbs for a thicker mixture so it bakes well.  If you want a crispy outside flip them over half way through and turn the oven up to broil for a few minutes at the end.

I've made these a few times usually with black beans and find them overall to be better than most store bought veggie burgers. My friends and family even enjoyed them, who aren't vegetarian. The only thing was the texture wasn't as firm as I'd hoped but the flavor is great so I gave it five stars. I also recommend starting with a half a cup of salsa and adding until a stiff mixture forms, two cups is way too much. Also, I saute the veggies first with garlic, cumin and chili powder.

These were surprisingly easy to make, and they had great flavor. I used black beans, fried half of them and baked the rest. I liked the fried better. However, next time I would lightly grill the pepper and onions so they weren't so crunchy.

This was such a cool idea!  I would not put the carrots in next time, they didn't really add any needed flavor and I did add about 1 teaspoon of fresh garlic because garlic is a staple in my meals.  I would not reccomend baking them either.  As one of the other reviewers said, she fryed them in oil, and that's what I did.  baking them would have been way too sloppy and the patties would not have formed correctly.  I cooked them in a pan with canola oil on each side for about 3 min.  Yummy!!!!!!!!

I've always wanted to make veggie burgers from scratch! And this was an easy recipe to follow. However, it did take some time getting all the ingredients and chopping them up. But that's the only thing that keeps me from making them all the time because they were so good. It was one of my husband's favorites and I know I'll be making again because he keeps asking for them. Thanks!

I made these last night for my husband and myself. They were fantastic! (I am eating leftovers for lunch right now... :) I did sautee the pepper and onion first and only used one cup of salsa as other reviews suggested (and I'm glad I did) When I first started it seemed like one can of beans wouldnt be enough, but the bread crumbs really bulked it up. I only wish the consistancy was just a bit more stiff... it holds together fine, but its a bit mushy when you bite into it (maybe I should have cooked longer?) Next time I will add some egg whites in hopes of having a firmer consistancy.

This is a very flavorful meatless dish that I make quite often.  I fry the patties in a little oil and serve on a bun with the "works".

Fantastic!  I figured veggies are all created equal, so I used what I had :-)  I used black beans, celery instead of green pepper, and mushrooms.  I sauteed celery, mushrooms, onion, carrot, and garlic together before mixing them with the beans.  Like everyone else, I added far less salsa.  I served it on a 100 calorie wheat bun with sliced tomatoes and homemade chipotle mayo. Yum!!!

This was a great base idea.. like others I altered to suit my taste. I LOVE kidney beans, so I stuck with that - lightly cooked the peppers and onion - and went ahead and added some cumin and chili powder. I also used oat flour and fresh whole wheat bread crumbs as a binder. 1/4 cup of salsa was all that was needed for me. Mixed it all with my hands, pan fried, and loved every last bite! Great left-overs.. mine ended up being 5 pretty large patties to fit our buns. Thanks for the idea!

This has become my base recipe.  The 2nd batch was made with Spagetti sauce instead of salsa, Italian seasonings and two major changes, black beans instead of kidney (that's what I had), and old fashioned rolled oats rather than bread crumbs.  The oats give this a more "cooked hamburger" texture.  The third variation on this recipe was a regular burger, replace salsa with beef broth, add garlic powder or minced garlic and a bit more oats if the mixture seems too watery.  Fantastic and easy.   Giving this 5 stars because of how versitile this is.  Going to try making breakfast sausage with this next, it's mostly the spices that provide the taste anyway!!

This was a fantastic and easy recipe.  The burger tasted great and held together so well even when I shapped them into thinner pieces.

I think I added too much salsa all at once as this was very wet.  But that said, the taste was lovely.  I will make this again, but follow the advice of a previous reviewer and add the salsa a bit at a time.

Taste:  5 stars, texture: 3 stars.  Following the advice of other reviews, I added about 1 1/4 cups salsa and used black beans instead of kidney beans.  Also, I sauteed the onions and peppers before forming the patties.  They had a very nice spice from the chili powder.  The salsa I used had corn in it and I think next time I would add even more corn.  Re texture: even frying them--they were still a bit mushy.  I like a burger with a bit more resistance, if that makes sense.

These are really good. I cooked my own black beans, didn't add the peppers or carrot and also cut the salsa to 1 cup. I used a potato masher to smooch them up and coated them in cornmeal before baking for a little crunch. They wanted to fall apart before I baked them but after they were baked they held up very nice. Tasted better than the veggie burgers you get at the store!

I made this for my brother and his family.  As the only vegetarians in our family, we are always searching for good veggie burger recipes.  This one was great that night and the next day.  However, it's much better with black beans.  They were much more flavorful that way.

Excellent! I used half black, half kidney beans and used a little green, yellow, red and jalapeno pepper to make up the 1/2.

I actually had trouble keeping these in a burger form, so I just fried them up into long, narrow pieces and used them in burritos. Great flavor!

Wow.  I LOVED this recipe! I am not a big fan of bean burgers, but this is fantastic.  The only changes I made was to adda  can of black beans to the can of kidney beans, and I used bisquick instead of whole wheat flour due to not having any in the house.  I also made it with a gooey consistancy, which gave a soft on-the-inside and crisp on the outside burger.  It was dreamy!

Yum!!!  I have a vegetarian friend and wanted to make her a veggie burger from scratch instead of buying a frozen one at the grocery store.  I used black beans instead of kidney...and I didn't use carrots. I sauteed the onion and bell pepper in olive oil, salt and pepper and used Italian Style bread crumbs to spice it all up...the key, however, is rubbing Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce all over the patty before you put it on the pan.  Also, the salsa I used had just a little corn in it (didn't know that when I bought it) and I liked it a lot so I might add in some corn next time.  They were fabulous!!  Even die-hard meat lovers couldn't stop munching on them...so great!!!!!!  You could even try sauteeing mushrooms with your onions...lots of possibilities.

Fabulous recipe!  Now, I use it as a base and add different veggies like corn for a Southwest twist.  Also, I freeze them in individual patties for later use.

These were quite easy to prepare and very tasty. next time I will decrease the salsa a bit. I did add more spices to this more chili and some cumin. Oh and I also used black beans instead of kidneys.. this was really delicious.

These were pretty good. Didn't have wheat flour so I used wheat germ instead. I also cut back on the salsa and added cayenne plus other seasonings. Nice lunch, just for me. Thanks Valerie!

Husband LOVES these and I have to admit they are darn tasty.  Heavy though and I meant weight, not feeling in the tummy.  Didn't need buns and topped with guac.... yum.  Despite the jarred salsa, it didn't taste salty at all, which I was afraid of.

This is tasty, but some alterations need to be made.  Cut way down on the salsa (I used 1 cup) and you'll get a better consistency.  Add some cumin (I used 1 tsp.) and some cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp to start).  I also added about 1 1/2 tsp. of garlic.  With these changes, the burgers turn out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome vegetarian recipe, instant hit with us. We served the patties without any bread with a salad to accompany, and I felt very healthy after eating. In place of expensive salsa, I used a can of diced tomatoes which was just fine. Cook on lower heat because these babies'll burn on med-high heat

I shredded the carrot  - they cooked fine in 2 min. that way.  Left out the green pepper since I don't like it.  I liked the *taste* of these.  I've tried them w/different kinds of buns, and with different toppings including melting some cheddar on them.  I've only had the packaged soy burgers years ago and these do taste better than those.  (The one good thing that came from this is that now I'd like to try the packaged black bean burgers.)  However, I think the recipe itself has some major issues.  They do fall apart easily and I don't think the green pepper would be enough bulk to keep them together.  Even people who cut the salsa in half commented on this.  I was afraid to cut it too much cause they might then be just too flour-y with no flavor.  (The oats might not be a bad substitute.)  And they burned VERY easily.  I fried them, turned the temp down a second time and they just still wouldn't get done without burning.  I didn't care so much that they were mushy inside (made them taste like refried beans), but I did care that they burned.  Then I tried baking them - that left them without any form and tasteless - I think baking is a bad idea.  I finally tried my no-stick electric skillet with NO OIL and that's how they did the best.  I think the oil or spray is part of what's making them burn, but they also stick easily.  In the end I just got stick of messing with them.  (They also do not keep well in the fridge even for 2 days.)

Not bad but not something I'm in a hurry to make again. Next time I'll omit the carrot (or dice it super finely maybe) and add fresh cilantro. I baked them per the instructions and they were rather wet and mushy inside. I'll probably bake them at a lower temp for longer next time.

i cant say i followed this recipe exactly(im sure it would have been great if i did though)but i only used it as my base. i used a 15oz drained can of pintos. orange bell pepper because thats all i had on hand. no onion only powder because i didn't have one so i replaced the texture of it with 6 baby portabellos. i had no salsa so i chpped up 1 tomato, i hot pepper, and some cilantro which made a little over 1 cup of salsa. 1/2c oats in place of bread crumbs and cayenne pepper for the black pepper. they were absolutely scrumptious.... lol also  didn't fry i sprayed pan with Pam and let them brown up and become firm.   Soooo much better than store bought. im 13 and if i can make them so can you so you must try these!

I think these are great. I've made them twice. The first time I cooked them in the skillet according to directions, but they turned out mushy was the only problem. Then I tried baking them according to directions and they still turned out mushy. You definitely need to flip these halfway through baking and I would recommend at least 15 minutes on each side.

Very good, moist and chewy/crunchy like real hamburgers, though a different flavour of course.  These taste a bit like tacos, all the salsa I guess, especially if you top with the recommended sour cream.  I suggest sour cream, BBQ sauce and a dill pickle slice - delicious on a whole wheat bun, and healthy too!  I had to microwave the carrot for more like 5 minutes to get it mashable; might just grate it and not cook it at all next time.

These were difficult to shape and cook because of all the salsa and the flavour was rather bland.  My vegetarian daughter prefers the Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers recipe from this site much more.

These were awesome!! To make it even spicier I used chili beans, a bit of tabasco sauce, and extra chili powder. I also added shredded jalepeno jack cheese into the mixture. Served on a bun with guacamole.

Delicious, the recipe is fab!  It's very easy to prepare.  We all thouroughly enjoyed the burgers.  I have plenty left over and have frozen them for later use!  Much cheaper and has more flavour than the commercially avaliable veggie burgers.  I think next time I will add more chilli powder as it wasn't spicey enough for our tastes!

I had cooked quinoa so I used that (1/2 cup) instead of breadcrumbs.  Used black beans instead of kidney beans because I had them made.  Skipped the carrot but added garlic.  Cut the salsa down to 1/4 cup.  Served it on a sprouted bun.  Came out so good, I had to heat up extra buns.  This could become a regular.  Thanks.

This is a great base recipe to build on and customize to your tastes. Like others, I cooked the onions and peppers in some vegan "butter" with clove of minced garlic and about 3/4 c. frozen corn before adding it to the rest of the ingredients. I also added some cumin and a little cilantro and used a half cup less salsa than called for. It was still a little runnier than I anticipated so instead of trying to form patties, I just scooped the mixture (about 2 spoonfuls for each patty)onto a large piece of foil and then transported it to the grill. They were still a little mushy in the middle but the taste was incredible, will try using even less salsa next time and a little more chili powder.

Good!  I minced the carrot, sauteed it with the pepper, onion, and some minced garlic, then added everything else, plus some worcestershire sauce, Thai chili sauce, and lots of cumin.  I started w/ 1 cup of salsa & added as needed.  I think I wound up using about 1.5 cups. Oh! And I used one can of black beans instead of kidney and baked them for about 15 minutes at 425, flipping half-way.  They were really good topped with the leftover salsa.  Next time, I want to try it without the flour, because they are heavy.

This got mixed reviews from my family.  The flavor was good (served it with Lite Brocamole from this website) but it is not something I'll make on a weeknight again...took too much time to prepare.  Also, like other reviewers, I cut the amount of salsa in half & drained the beans very well, but the mixture was still way too wet.  Ended up having to add more bread crumbs than tastes good.  Advice:  add the salsa a little bit at a time after all other ingredients are combined.  That way you won't end up with bread crumb burgers.

A very tasty burger.  I used one cup of salsa instead of two.  Drained the kidney beans but I'm not sure if I was supposed to or not.  I think that next time I will leave out the carrot, my husband didn't appreciate how it tasted in a burger.  However, he still ate the burgers happily and I couldn't taste the carrots at all.  Cooked them up on my George Foreman grill and they were delicious.  This is a wonderful recipe.

These burgers were great!  and so easy to make--even for a "non-cook" like myself! I love veggie burgers, but most store bought burgers have lots of wheat gluten added, which I dont like. This is a great recipe and I will continue to make my own veggie burgers from now on.

these burgers were great! I pan fried the burgers and also used black beans. I added cumin and a pinch of Goya (All purpose seasonings blend) and about a teaspoon of shakable Chicken flavored granules because my family loves s-p-i-c-y authentic taste~ (being I am Mexican and my fiance is Dominican) thanks for sharing!

I'm from Scandinavia, and people around here aren't used to Mexican food, but this one has proved a hit with my friends, though they found bean burgers a rather strange idea at first.

Easy recipe!  Takes no time to make up, and even my finicky toddler ate the "burger" without a fuss.

Healthy and FULL of flavor!  This was soooo very good. I couldn't quite get the burger to stay solid, so I made like a sloppy joe out of it. It was awesome! The hubby even liked it and he is a meat and potato kind of guy!

these are some of the best veggie burgers i have ever made.  i used my hand blender on the beans and carrots and that made everything nice and sticky. i followed the recipe pretty well, but i used red pepper and i threw in some mini portobello mushrooms and i fried the onions, pepper and mushrooms before adding it to the rest of the mixture.  delicious!

So I made these without the carrot because I forgot to pick one up at the store and without the bell pepper because I thought I had one in my fridge, but it was pretty droopy looking.  My only personal add was a bit of cayenne pepper. Uh-maze-ing.  I love that they are vegan too, as I have a lot of vegans in my life.  I will be making these again.

This by far beats store bought bean burgers. I made 2 changes no carrots and added milled flax seed. I fried them a little so they wouldn't fall apart on the grill. Very yummy.

These burgers were very good. Even though the recipe did not call for egg, my burgers stayed intact throughout the cooking process (I cooked them in a pan with only a little cooking spray). I used the salsa and flour as needed and, for both ingredients, ended up needing less than the recipe called for. We ate them open-faced with spinach, tomato, mustard and relish. Wonderful. Thank you!

Make these quite often -- even tried one crumbled on the Mexican Whole Wheat Tortilla and it was great!  Definitely saute the onions and peppers first.  Subbed oats for the whole wheat flour and crumbled dry toast instead of using bread crumbs.

We didn't like these.  We ate them, but we had made LOTS b/c we do with everything and we always have leftovers for lunch.  The next day at lunch the kids were acting as if it was the 'punishment of the day' to have to eat these!!

We didn't like the consistency and thought they were a little bland.  We'll go back to our other bean burgers.

i also used shredded carrots, and followed another reviewer's advice ad sauteed them with the onion, pepper, some garlic, cumin, and chili powder. then i mixed that in with the beans, salsa, etc. had to use more bread crumbs/flour than recommended, but the burgers came out very tasty. a quick dinner, and really easy.

This turned out great! Used grated carrot instead of cooking it and less salsa than the recipe called for. And LOTS of chilli powder and pepper because I like mine spicy. Only managed to get 4 burgers out of the recipe though...maybe mine were larger. :) Will definitely make these again!

No doubt this is an excellent recipe. I didn't know bean burgers can be so tasty. According to suggestions, I also added the corn. Used ranch dressing instead of sour cream and didn't care for the avacado. Baked them and then heated them on the pan  with sharp cheddar cheese. I have also frozen these after baking. Now I have them ready whenever I want. Thanks a lot for the recipe.

These were great on the grill.  Like many others, I used black beans.  Also, I substituted half the salsa with green chili which was amazing.  The original recipe I thought was kind of bland, so play around with spices to get something you like.

mmm this recipe was very good, and easy to follow. i felt that the range of baking time given was too long, 15-17 minutes should be just right. i substituted mushroom pasta sauce for the salsa, since i was out of salsa, and it gave the patties a bit of a mushroomy tang. thumbs up!

This was great! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I would just need a super flavor explosion for that.  But these were easy, loved that it was full of veggies, and they were yummy the next day! I imagine these would freeze well! The only thing I changed was replacing the bread crumbs with crushed pico de gallo tortilla chips because that's all I had. The recipe said to add more salsa or more flour depending on wetness and I needed to add just a bit more flour. They got perfectly crispy on the grill. Yum!

I cooked these last night for the family.  I did only add the salsa after I had added the dry ingredients and I probably used a little over a cup.  I did not want they too soggy as others had suggested.
I thought it could have done with a little more flavor (other than the amount of salsa I used exact recipe).  I will make again but I will probably add some extra spices and probably a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  
They held up well but I made them before dinner and put them in the fridge for about an hour.  I cooked them on the George Foreman too.
It made 8 decent sized patties and I put 4 in the freezer and will see how they hold up to thawing and cooking.

Replaced the carrot w 3/4 cooked sweet potato, cooked the onions with some garlic in butter before adding to the beans. added a little lime juice and mustard, used maybe 1/2 cup salsa and omitted flour. these are going to be regulars at our house.

My youngest son and I loved these, but my husband couldn't get past the word 'burger'.  I think that next time, I'll serve this mixture and etc. more as burritos......, then the flavor can shine and the texture not come into question just because of the name.....  Thanks!

These burgers came out great, but the 2nd time I changed a little bit. Instead of kidney beans I used 16 oz bush's refried beans. I didn't use chili powder or carrots. And I thought the green peppers and onions were better sauteed in olive oil. Just as a footnote, when forming the patties, wet your hands before forming them and the mixture won't stick to your hands as much.

Made with Mexican beans as I didn't have any canned kidney beans.  Had a great texture.  Served just as you would a hamburger & my 1 & 2 year olds ate most of it.  Will be making again, experiementing other options.  Has great potential.

The taste was good, but the texture just isn't quite there yet. It's hard to shake the feeling that you're eating a bean sandwich. Sadly, I have yet to find a veggie burger recipe that holds together nearly as well as the packaged ones.

While making this recipe I was looking forward to having the sort of bean burger I am used to from my favourite restaurant. Unfortunately I didn't quite get there, but the outcome is still pretty tasty. For me the burgers turned out too mushy. I baked them for 15 min with flipping them over half way and in the end put the oven on 'grill' for a couple of minutes. They were nice and crispy on the outside, but too  chewy inside. Will try with more breadcrumbs (I had already used less salsa!) or maybe crushed tortilla chips. A very good recipe though and very quick!

excellent recipe with excellent taste, however, i have not been able to get them cooked without burning them.  maybe that's just the way they're supposed to be, but it would prefer if they weren't

These were pretty tasty and seem to be easily ajusted to suit you own tastes.  I do think 2 cups of salsa was a bit much.  They were very mushy and somewhat difficult to work with.  Frying worked fine but they stuck to my George Foreman grill.  I will use this as a base recipe and probably use less salsa and maybe a little more bean next time.

This turned out to be very tasty.  I used yellow peppers, medium salsa, and omitted the chili powder.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I used the only thing I had on hand- crushed potato chips. I fried the burgers in olive oil, for about 2-3 minutes on high heat. I will try with bread crumbs next time to be more healthy.  YUM!

Make sure you taste the batter and adjust seasonings until you are happy with it.  Great basics though.

These were not bad.  I do think I made the burgers too thick - they stuck to the pan before they were done in the middle.  Next time I will add something spicy like jalapenos to the mix, and I will make very thin burgers so that it is easier to cook them completely.  This is a great recipe - I think with some practice on my part and a little spice it could easily be 4 or 5 stars.

I enjoyed the taste but they were very moist. They stuck to the fry pan when I tried to cook them that way and to the baking pan, I had even used non-stick cooking spray. I baked them longer than indicated and topped them with monterey jack cheese.

Good.  I used black beans and a little less salsa as previously recommended.  They were good and my husband liked them as well.  They turned out much better than other veggie hamburger recipes that I have tried.

Great recipe. I wasn't interested in making it taste "Mexican" so I used dill, garlic, paprika, and lots of pepper to make it taste like the beef burgers I used to eat. Turned out wonderful. The suggestion of the cornmeal was also excellent. Such an easy and flexible recipe, I'll continue to use this instead of the store-bought variety.

These are so easy to make - and so delicious too! We had them in Ciabatta rolls with salad, a sprinkling of grated cheddar cheese and sliced tomatoes on top - marvellous!!
