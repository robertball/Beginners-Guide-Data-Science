I've made this recipe many times. It's one of my favorites! I add a can of Rotele Tomatoes with Chilis-it's the perfect addition. Yummy!

I have been making a variation of this dish for years.  Don't use olives, but do mix in garlic powder and either chili poder or caun seasoning into sour cream.  I think it turns out better if you mix the rice into the sour cream, with about half the cheese, before turning it into the casserole dish.  Then top with the remainder of the cheese.  Great way to use up leftover rice or a terrific pot luck dish when doubled.

Excellant with some cumin and a little chili pwd with the rotel and I use black and green olives.  adds a little zap to it.  I agree with add sour cream to rice prior to baking and use a little more to keep moist and top with colby longhorn cheese.  almost spanish rice with tomatoe juice.  I brown the rice as well before cooking.  much more flavor and a little nut flavor adds to it.

I reduced the cheese in this recipe from 2.5 cups to 2 cups (fat free cheese) and still, the only thing I could taste in this dish was cheese.  It was edible, but I won't be making it again.

Easy to make, but pretty bland. The kids did not like this, so I guess I won't be making it again.

This was REALLY good but I only gave 4 stars because it's not exactly healthy! I doubled the rice (and water), le ft out the olives because 2 of my 3 kids won't eat them, added some extra cheese because of the extra rice. Did NOT double the sour cream, 16 oz seemed like plenty. I confess I did not measure the cheese but probably used abt 3 cups in all. Finally, I divided the rice mixture , (did not do it in layers) and added taco-seasoned ground beef to 1/2, in 1 dish, for the carnivores, and added black beans to the other 1/2, with a little creole seasoning, for me and my youngest who doesn't like meat. I will definitely make this again.

It had a great flavor combination, but was a little dry.  It still tasted pretty good.

too spicy for my kids but my husband loved it. Very "changeable". I added beans for a full veggie protein kick as well as the green onions and used a little extra sour cream. I think I might prefer cheddar instead of jack cheese.

The first time I made this dish I thought it was OK but needed something more. I agree with other reviewers, the sour cream was a bit overpowering. The second time I made this it was much much better! I doubled the rice, used less than the full 16oz container of sour cream and added shredded chicken (using this recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/sarahs-easy-shredded-chicken-taco-filling/detail.aspx) to the sour cream, chiles, olives mixture. I layered 1/2 the rice, 1/2 the sour cream mixture, 1/2 the cheese into a greased 13x9 in pan then repeated the layers. I think the layering with the cheese on top keeps the rice more moist. Leftovers were excellent with crumbled corn or tortilla chips and some Tapatio mixed in!
