This cake was a little dry..the icing came out nice and fluffy. I can't say I was real keen on the filling. Maybe not as much cocoa and a little bit of red food coloring to go with it's name. I think it would have been better as a 3 layer cake since it made so much icing. All in all my co-workers enjoyed it.

This has got to be the worst cake I've ever made.  Didn't change a thing with the recipe, a definite mistake and ended up with a couple sawdust patties.  A friend asked for this specific recipe or I would have formulated my own.  Do yourself a favor and move away from this cake.

I only made the icing and it didn't taste that good.  Maybe it would have tasted better on the cake that it went with.
