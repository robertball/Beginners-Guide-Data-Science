I was able to "slim down" this recipe, and it still tasted great. I used light cream cheese, egg substitute, skim sweetened condensed milk, and smart balance spread instead of butter. I also used 60% cocoa bittersweet chips to take advantage of the dark chocolate hype. It did not crack, travelled well for the holidays and baked at exactly the time specifications.

This recipe was good, but even better the second day.  I am only giving it 4 stars because it is incredibly rich.  Too much dessert after a meal, would be perfect if you were having company over for "just dessert".  Very easy to make, I also divided it into 2 ready made graham cracker crust pies.

I made this cheesecake as a dessert for thanksgiving for those who dont like pumpkin pie, and trust me it was gone within minutes. Everyone loved it! Instead of using milk chocolate, i used white chocolate and followed the recipe completely and it was delicious. A piece of advice would be to bake the cheesecake  in a water bath and do not open the oven door for at least two hours: this prevents it from cracking and ensures a smooth texture on top.

I took a shortcut and used two 9 inch ready made crusts and the filling was enough to fill both crusts to the very top.  I added  1/4 cup coffee liquor and topped with a chocolate cream sauce.  This is really good, but I won't serve this after a large meal like Thanksgiving dinner again, people just aren't in the mood for a rich heavy dessert like this after eating themselves sick.  Even though it was delicious, I ended up throwing half of it out.

This is an amazing cheesecake. Thick and rich. However, the first time I made it, it billowed up, then sank in. It also had many cracks in it. There was also enough batter for about two cheesecakes that size. It still tasted amazing, though. But I thought to myself, "this recipe definitely needs a water bath, but it doesn't call for one." So the next time I made it, I used a 10 inch spring-form pan (recipe calls for 9 inch), then I greased the sides and the bottom of it (recipe says not to grease), I used a water bath (recipe doesn't mention anything about a water bath), I let it sit in the oven for an hour after the cooking time was up (recipe didn't call for that), and last but not least, I put a round pizza pan over it after I took it out, and let it sit for about 4 hours. The cheesecake ended up turning out perfect--taste wise and look wise. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars, is because the directions for this recipe are not good. Use a 10 inch spring form pan, grease the bottom and sides of it, use a water bath, let sit in the oven (door closed and heat off) for an hour after baking time is up, and put a round pizza pan (or cookie sheet) over it after taking it out; if you follow those directions, your cheesecake will turn out perfectly!

To Soloman...I think you were supposed to melt the chips before you put it in the mix. And cracks are normally caused by not mixing the cream cheese very well, or the temperature and timing not being exact. It's tough to make a perfect cheesecake. Delicious recipe! Thank you.

This is a classic chocolate cheesecake recipe. It is very rich so plan on serving small slices! It also doesn't need a thing in the way of accompaniment, unless you count a simple garnish when plating. The directions for this recipe are a little lacking, so for beginner cheesecake bakers, a few tips. Be sure to have your cream cheese and eggs at room temperature. Add the eggs one at a time and beat on low speed only until each is just blended, stopping to scrape down the bowl before adding the next. Over beating at this stage will ensure a cracked top. Another sure fire way to avoid a cracked top is to leave the cake in the oven when finished baking, with the heat off and the door ajar, until oven is cool. Then refrigerate.

I followed the recipe, but it didn't look anything like the picture.  I'm not sure if maybe i messed up with the morsels, but all of them were on the bottom of the cheesecake, i may have done something wrong.

Gotta love it! Not only were there minimal ingredients, it was fast and easy. Heck it only took me a minute and a half to melt the chocolate chips! To top it all off, the cook time was right down to the very last minute.

I followed this recipe almost exactly. Instead of using all regular cream cheese, I used 1 regular, and two fat free. And for my crust since I don't care for graham crackers I used Nilla wafers, this is also because I made them into mini cheesecakes using paper cupcake liners. I baked them for 17 minutes at 350 and they came out great. They were delicious. I also topped them with some cherry pie filling for added yumminess. I am taking them to a baby shower today.

This was the first cheesecake I ever tried to make, and it turned out perfect.  I was nervous to make this because of how delicate and complicated cheesecakes can be.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only adjustments I made were that instead of just using two cups of chocolate chips, I did one cup of chips and one cup peanut butter.  I also put a pan of water on the rack underneath the cheesecake when baking so that it would stay moist.  I did not crack whatsoever.  I will definitely make this again.

This dessert is really good, but extremely rich. It is good in small, slender slices. Anything more than that, and it might make you sick! My husband is a huge chocolate fanatic and absolutely loved this. This is definitely something you must have in moderation. :)

This cheesecake was wonderful.  Cheesecake is my favorite dessert and I have never made one before bc of the springform pan.  For a challenge I had to make a cheesecake with said pan and this was the best recipe.  It was so creamy and wonderful and it was even great frozen!  It is rich but no richer than anyother cheesecake. The baking time was spot on and I followed this recipe exactly.  Everyone in my bible study was very pleased and even my husband liked it and he doesn't like cheesecake!  Way to Go Eagle!

First things first, I don't own a springform pan so I had to slum it a little bit, and divide my batter up between regular cake pans. As a result, this review might be a bit biased regarding the mechanics, so I'll skip right to taste.

This cake seemed more crumbly that creamy, and tasted like it really wanted to be fudge rather than a cheesecake. The graham cracker crust also seemed to become saturated with the cake batter to the point where it became indistinguishable from the mix itself. You could still taste it, but it was chocolate-colored and not crispy at all. Just chocolate flavored graham mush.

Based on all these rave reviews I was really expecting better. It was till tasty, just not what I was hoping for.

This is without a doubt the best chocolate cheesecake recipe I ever made! I used a good quality dark chocolate and finished it with fresh raspberries and a raspberry sauce..If you are a fan of chocolate this easy to make recipe is for you. I would recommend baking it in a water bath to prevent cracking and serve small slices since it is very rich.

This recipe is wonderful! My son wanted a chocolate cheesecake for his birthday instead of cake so I made this and it was a hit. The only tiny change I made was that I cooked the crust in the pan alone for 10 minutes before pouring the cheesecake mixture on top and baking the whole thing. I like the way this makes the crust taste and how it makes the crust hold together a little better and not get soggy at all.

I made this cake exactly as the recipe read.... no changes. I was lucky I had two pie crusts in my pantry.  I was able to fill two pie crusts, which made it nice because I brought one over to my fiance's mother (her husband is a chocolate lover and he loved the cheesecake).  It is a very very VERY VERY rich dessert. I think serving in small slices with whipped cream is recommended.  Would be a great recipe, if it wasn't so so rich. Thanks!! =)

I added 1/3 cup of cocoa powder and 3tbsp sugar as substitute for the chocolate chips, it turned out great! Also I made it from the original 12 serving down to 8 servings and it altered the cooking time down to 55 mins.

This was definitely a hit!  Everything about it was great except that the top cracked.  I put the pan of water in the oven and left the cake in the oven overnight to cool, then placed it in the fridge with an airtight cover.  I topped it with sliced strawberries and no one was the wiser.  Next time I'll definitely cut it before taking it though as we had a royal mess.  It crumbled apart as if it were slightly too dry.  It tasted great and taste-wise, the texture was good, but very difficult to work with.

I myself don't care for chocolate, but I wanted to make a chocolate and a regular cheesecake for a friend's birthday. I used this recipe for the chocolate one, and after stirring in the chocolate chips I suddenly thought to myself, "wait a minute... I bet anything I was supposed to melt these." Yep. So I ended up with a chocolate chip cheesecake rather than chocolate batter. That mishap not withstanding, it got great reviews from the birthday boy, and also my brother said it was - hands down - the best cheesecake he had ever had! I made a different crust than directed only because I prepared two crusts before picking the recipes. I also had only reduced fat cream cheese on hand and everyone said it was still very, very rich. I topped it with a cup of cool whip beaten with a tablespoon of chocolate milk mix... mostly to disguise the crack that formed on the top of the cake, but it complimented the flavor of the cheesecake nicely. 
I'll definately try this again and MELT the chocolate, but if I want to make a chocolate chip cheesecake again I'll use this recipe and 'forget' to melt the chips! Perhaps I'll also try melted butterscotch or white chocolate chips! That's a flavor I could go for!

def a very good cheesecake. however it was a bit dense. i don't know if it was because i beat it by hand or not. I did alter the crust a little bit. I used chocolate graham crackers and i didn't have a springform pan. so i used little ramekins, pushed the crust in them, but then i refrigerated them before i put the filling in to help solidify the crust. other than that. totally awesome!

An AMAZING recipe!  My only recommendation is to make sure you do not over mix the filling to keep it from cracking.  I folded in the melted chocolate by hand to avoid over mixing.  Chocolate cheesecake is one of my absolute favorites and this is better than any store bought/restuarant cheesecake I've ever eaten.

This came out great!  I used a chocolate cookie crust and finished it off with a dark chocolate ganache.  Since I didn't have a hand mixer I used my ninja blender. It came out so creamy it was like a mix between a pudding and a mousse. I made this for my grandma's bday party and it was a huge hit. Will definitely make again!

This is way too much chocolate. I used a water bath as others had suggested and the top still cracked! The time was not right either. I had to bake it for another 30 min for the middle to be done. It is very rich! We ended up throwing half of it away! I will not make this again...

This has become my absolute favorite base cheesecake. It lends itself perfectly to modifying (white chocolate instead of semisweet, oreo crusts, adding preserves) incredibly well. I prefer this recipe to most others because the ingredient list is short and simple making it perfect to make with children. It is basically a no fail cheesecake so go crazy with it!

Simple recipe and tastes great! It's fairly sweet, but if you're looking for something even sweeter, substitute the semi-sweet chips with milk chocolate chips. I melted more milk chocolate chips and spread over the top once it was cooled, and served with real whipped cream. Great recipe and easy to make!

I did not care for this recipe.  It's so dense & heavy!  The crust was sticky, crunchy and chewy - like toffy!  It stuck to the bottom of my springform pan.  I will never make this again!

Great tasting and very easy to make! I used a water bath and the cheesecake didn't crack. I also left it in the oven for an hour after baking with the door open. It turned out perfect. I highly recommend this recipe. :-)

Came out perfect and yummy! very rich! 
I used a chocolate graham cracker crust (teddy grahams) and instead of a water bath i put a broiler pan full of water underneath the cheesecake and a springform pan.

This cheesecake was amazing, although I did end up with a crack down the middle.  Instead of the graham cracker crust, I crushed a 1 1/2 cups of oreo cookies (w/o cream), 1/4 cup of sugar, and 1/4 cup of butter. It was yummy!

Although the cake did crack straight down the middle, it tasted great and was a big hit! Next time, I'll probably use the steam bath others have recommended for making cheesecakes, but otherwise a great recipe!

This turned out perfect!  I am an Aldi's shopper and used their semi sweet chocolate.  Oh my goodness, I heard hummmmsss all around the table as my guests were eating.    My son's favorite dessert is cheesecake.  I have made many New York Style cheesecakes thru the years.  This is the first time I have ever tried a chocolate cheesecake and I think I will make it over and over again.  It is one of the easiest cheesecakes I have ever made.

This was my very first attempt at a cheesecake and it was perfect! I followed the recipe exactly except I used chocolate graham crackers. I also slimmed down the recipe by using 1/3 less fat cream cheese and low fat sweetened condensed milk. This did not affect the taste at all. Everyone who tried this ranted and raved! Be sure to let your cake cool down in the oven to prevent cracking. I topped with mini chocolate chips. Will be making this again and again!!

OMG heavenly. 
I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate,drizzled with chocolate syrup, and it was fabulous.
I made a different one using white chocolate chips, replaced the vanilla with almond, and added 1/2 tsp of ameretto. Drizzled caramel syrup and whipped cream.
Sinfull.
This recipe has endless possibilities.
Great job Eagle Brand.

This recipe has made me a hero to my hubby!!  I put a cake pan with boiling water in the oven below my cheesecake (not touching) and it seems to have fixed the cracking problem.  This is a delicious chocolate cheesecake, and a recipe I'll definitely be keeping in my rotation!

We just ate this and it is very good! It's rich, as all cheesecakes are meant to be, but not sickeningly rich. I made this into a triple chocolate cheesecake by substituting finely crushed chocolate animal crackers for the graham cracker crumbs (it took 5 oz. of cookies to make 1 1/4 cup of crumbs) and reserving a 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips to sprinkle on the top. A few of the chocolate chips sunk a bit too deep into the batter and caused the surface to crack somewhat near the center, but it was not too much of a detriment. The cheesecake was still very pretty, and delicious! Today is my husband's birthday, and he asked for this triple chocolate cheesecake in lieu of a traditional birthday cake. After eating a piece, he said it was just what he wanted!

I tried the recipe, and made two batches of the batter. One batch without any chocolate, the other with melted Godiva chocolate (one dark chocolate bar, one milk chocolate bar, both mixed together), in place of melted chocolate chips, and with only one cup of chocolate, rather than two cups, to make the richness be a little less. I also used the pre-made graham cracker crusts in place of crushing graham crackers, and then also crushed chocolate graham crackers for the rest of the crust, including mini cheesecakes. This was definitely a good recipe, and I will be making it again!

First time making a cheesecake and it came out fantastic.  I used fat free cream cheese and condensed milk and it still came out very rich.  I also replaced one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips with Reese's peanut butter chips, to make it a Peanut Butter Cheesecake...Delicious!

This cheesecake was great, however it was too rich. Even in small slivers, I can see what another reviewer meant by this being "too cheesy." Now I see why some recipes have a bit of sour or whipping cream in them; it lightens the mouthfeel.

That said, a little cool whip helped lighten this up a bit. I think fresh berries could also do the same.

This was my 2nd cheesecake. So a couple of things I did with this one that made my cheesecake better in general...First, everything needs to be at room temp. I beat the cream cheese with a mixer to soften it. I folded in the milk, then did a short, low-speed mixer beating to get out clumps. Seperately, I lightly whisked the eggs, and folded them and all the other ingredients into the cheese and milk mixture. I got a silky texture, rather than moussey, which was what I wanted.

Water bath is a good idea. I don't have an oven-safe dish big enough to fit my 10" springform, so I filled a dish with water and put it on the rack below. It kept the oven a little more humid, and avoided cracks (which I had too many of in my first cheesecake). Once I poured it in the pan, I tapped the whole thing on the counter a few times. Big bubbles came up, so I'm glad I did that before I started baking. I baked 70 min, turned oven off, used wet knife to seperate edges more, and left oven door ajar for 2 hours before refridgerating. This also helped avoid cracks.

Also, my usual crust is graham crackers, walnuts and butter. It worked well with this recipe

I used 2 9 inch pre-done graham cracker crusts, and there was a little left over after I filled them to the top. I put that in a ramekin without graham cracker crumbs, just butter, and that was the sh*t! Used a water bath for it... The pies were ok, very rich, unedable without whipped cream, but the crustless ramekin warm was to die for! I am going to just to that next time and see how it is. Warm liquid chocolate at the bottom...no crust to fill you up...oh man!

Delicious! I tried the tricks everyone suggested regarding cracks, and it actually made a HUGE crack. (using a water pan in the oven, leaving in the oven for an hour after done baking). It was great, but I normally don't have too much trouble with cracks, so I may leave those steps out.

This recipe is very very heavy. If you eat any kind of filling meal, you won't be able to finish even a moderate slice of this. I am a bottomless pit for food but after you get halfway through one of these slices it starts to become a chore to finish. I recommend a regular good cheesecake recipe with a chocolate garnish or some kind of non overwhelming chocolate layer.

Even with using fat free cream, fat free sweetened condensed milk, and egg substitute this dish was still very rich.  However, it was absolutely amazing and I would definitely make it again!

Very delicious and surprisingly easy to make, which was great since it was my first time making cheesecake. I also used two prepared graham cracker crusts, since I was pressed for time, but it turned out just fine. My family loved it. It is extremely rich though, so don't eat it first thing after a big meal. :) Pairs very well with strawberries and whipped topping.

This cheesecake was wonderful. I made it as written no changes.  The only suggestion I have is to cut very small slices.  It says it serves 12 but the pieces are still good sized and it is very rich.  Could probably do 16 pieces easily. A deffinate make again.

This was one of the best tasting cheesecakes that I have ever had! Instead of making the whole cheesecake chocolate, I took half of the chocolate chips and half of the batter to make a chocolate swirl cake. I took it to a women's group meeting, and there was not even a piece left. Very scrumptious!

I made this for my husband, who LOVES cheesecake, for his Birthday. It was my first time making a "real" cheesecake as opposed to a cheesecake pie type of dessert. Unfortunately, I don't have a springform pan, so I used a pie dish. I reduced the baking time and had some filling left over and it came out amazingly well! I made sure to do my research as well. I put a shallow pan of water under my cheesecake while baking and left the cheesecake in the oven with it turned off for an hour after baking. No cracks! A lot of the negative reviews are from people who made mistakes and that isn't the fault of the recipe! If you like a rich, New York-style cheesecake, you will love this recipe. Also, if you really love chocolate, try using chocolate graham crackers for the crust. So good.

Chocolate cheese cake is so good. This person got the recipe right. For cheese cake you DO NOT have to add a bunch of stuff to make it taste good. This recipe is simple which is better. Here's a note to cheese cake newbies: Cheese cake is a very forgiving desert. You can mix and match ingredients. Don't have condensed milk? You can use regular milk. Don't have enough cream cheese? You can use cottage cheese. Just note that these changes will effect your baking time and cake consistency. If I want a rich chocolate cheese cake, I use only 2 cream cheese packs. If I don't want it to be rich, I use milk, and only 12 oz cream cheese and 1 cup cottage cheese. Eggs also add to the thickness so less eggs, is less rich. If this doesn't make sense then just disregard this and follow the recipe as it is because it's really good. I'm just picky sometimes. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Perfect! Easy to make and has a wonderful creamy texture. I used milk chocolate chips to cut down on the richness.

To die for.  I will not even try another chocolate cheesecake recipe.  The only thing i changed was that i used about 22 or23 crushed oreos with about 3 tbsp butter for the crust....i just thought it went better than the graham cracker crumbs.  I will make this again and again.  Its one of my husband's favorites, and he is picky, so when he requests this i know it is good :)

Used chocolate filled chocolate sandwich cookies to make the crust (no added sugar) and it makes a rich and chocolatey base for this luscious cheesecake. I used 60% chocolate as I prefer it to semi-sweet.  I also used a 10 inch pan and it is perfect.  Easy to make.

This was delicious.  I made it as a reward for some co-workers and it was very popular.  I am currently trying it again, but am using chocolate syrup rather than melting the chocolate chips.

This cheesecake is wonderful! I made it for a Christmas party. I sprinkled a little bit of crushed candy cane in the middle and topped it with whipped cream and crushed candy cane. The recipe was easier than others I have tried and this is the first cheesecake I have made that didn't crack on top! I will be using this one again.

This is a very good, fuss-free chocolate cheesecake. I plugged in what ingredients I had on hand and voila, this is what the site told me I could make. If you use a steam bath and your cheesecake still cracks, that is either where you cut it or where the whipped cream, chocolate curls, chocolate topping, or berries go, right? Don't listen to reviews from people who change or don't follow the recipe (like putting whole chocolate chips in) and then don't like it.

The baking time is way off on this.  The recipe says bake for 65 minutes at 300 degrees.  After considerably more than two hours at this temp. , mine was still soft in the middle, but I was out of time, so I had to take it out.  The middle collapsed.  I can't take it to the party and have to go and buy another dessert.

Great recipe and very easy! The only changes I made were I used the oreo crumbs for that extra chocolate kick and Bernard Callebeaut chocolate shavings. I found it was a bit dry at the edge and will cut back the cooking time by 5 min next time, though that could just be my oven. Overall, super recipe, great flavor and texture! The first time I had baked cheesecake at age 16, it was dry and crumbly and it took me 10 years to try another piece as I thought that was cheesecake!!! We only ever made the unbaked one!! This recipe makes you want to take the extra time and make the baked version! Next time - white chocolate!!!

Delicious!  This is a big hit at family gatherings and looks like it takes a lot more time and effort than it really does.
