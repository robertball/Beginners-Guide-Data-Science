Great recipe. We loved it! We didn't change a thing, but added some chili powder for a little more flavor. These also freeze well. Just wrap in foil & freeze.When needed just pop in the oven for 30 min. while you get dressed. Great for the work week.

I make these often.The only changes i make is to use  real garlic instead of garlic salt,Egg beater's instead of egg's and sometime's i throw in some diced ham.My kid's love these and ask for them at least once a week :) we top them off with Homemade Salsa which really set's them off.Thanks for a great recipe :)

Yum!  I made these for the first time this morning.  Very simple, and definitely a hit.  The only thing I changed to save time was using frozen cubed hash brown instead of cutting up "real potatoes".  Also, next time I might cut back on the onion and pepper to suit personal taste.  Other than that, it was great and I will definitely make this again!

This was a wonderful breakfast! Great flavor with the onion and the green chiles. I added a little hot sauce at the table to mine. I scaled this down to 2 servings and got 3 good sized taquitos from it. I didn't measure the potatoes, I just used 2 small round yukon golds and diced them up and then 2 eggs. I was out of Cheddar but a slice of American worked out fine. I added the garlic salt to the potatoes as onion as they cooked rather than waiting until the eggs were in. Yum Yum! My tum tum feels so happy now, Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe, did the same thing, only i sauteed the potatoes for a few minutes then added 1 1/2 cups of water and  boiled for quicker cooking. I also added jalapenos to the eggs for a kick of flavor. My family loved it! 5 out of 5 for sure! (Also you can make this on toast in the skillet and let the cheese melt before adding all other cooked ingredients, tastes great!)

I didn't try this, so I'm going on the hubby's review. He said they were very delicious and something he would want for breakfast often. I made exactly as written.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It was simple.  We decided to leave out the chiles and added some Vegetarian Stripples (an alternative to pork bacon).  It tasted wonderful.

I used leftover baked potatoes for my potatoes (great way to use up those last few baked potatoes). I did leave the onion and green chiles out because my kids wouldn't eat these if I did use them. I topped mine with some chopped green onion and valenitine hot sauce. Filling meatless breakfast!

My husband and I didn't like these at all. We thought they were very bland and were definitely missing that something special. I even added some sausage to them.  I will not be making these again.

I followed recipe but I did not add green chilis. I did however add sausage as my family like meat in their breakfast burritos. The potatoes are so good inside this delicious breakfast dish. Will make again.

Living in NM, I had to try this recipe. They are wonderful anytime, not just for the holidays. I have made these a few times for a quick and easy dinner on a weeknight. Thank you for sharing.

We loved them for brunch and then leftovers for lunch. Added a can of drained black beans but I am sure they are great without the addition.
