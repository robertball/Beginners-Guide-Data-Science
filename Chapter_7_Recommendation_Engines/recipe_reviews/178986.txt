I happened to be out of bread crumbs and didn't have enough day old bread to make my own--I used an equal amount crushed Texas Toast garlic butter croutons. I did add a couple spices to the meat loaf (garlic powder, onion powder, homemade italian seasoning) but other than that, I kept to the recipe. I baked this in my Perfect Meatloaf Pan--an hour was spot on. This was a decent meat loaf, helped along with spices. It held together well. I'd make it again in a pinch. This was really helpful for me to use on hand ingredients when money is tight. NOTE: To help with the "mushy meat loaf" issue, I like to make the meat loaf as far in advance before baking it as I can. At least a couple hours. For me, that seems to make the loaf more........loafy.

This meatloaf turned out very good! I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the meatloaf mixture. For the tomato sauce, I added a little bit of Worcestershire along with the water and pan drippings. It was tasty and flavorful-will definitely make again!

This was just not to our liking.   We found it to be a little mushy.  Perhaps seasoned bread crumbs would have given it more flavor.  Through the years I had always used Campbell's tomato soup on top of my meatloaf so I really thought we would enjoy this recipe.   I will continue to use it, just not inside the meatloaf.

This was an easy recipe with items I had on hand. We use cheese on everything so I added shredded cheese to the mix which gave the meatloaf more flavor.

Didn't care for this meat loaf at all.  So sloppy I couldn't even get it out of the pan in one piece.

Unfortunately this meatloaf turned out too mushy for our taste. It didn't have much flavor and I was wondering if salt was forgotten in the recipe as it certainly could have used it. At any rate, I think that it would have had a more pleasing texture if half of the soup called for was added to the loaf instead.
