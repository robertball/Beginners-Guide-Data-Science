Very good.  Just as a tip.  If you mix all ingredients EXCEPT for baking soda and let sit for an hour or so, then add soda.  And bake.  Whole Wheat flour is much fluffier.    I also used pineapple juice as extra flavor.  And used banana in place of yogurt.

Both my husband and I liked these muffins.  I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of making 14, I made twelve to fit my muffin pans. So, additional time was needed. Thanks for such an easy recipe. I will use this recipe again.

I will absolutely make these again!  I was out of honey so I replaced it with 1/4 c. brown sugar.  It was very dry so I added water a Tbl. at a time until it was doughy enough.  I also grated the carrot.  Wonderful recipe!

The dough is too stiff, so I added a half cup of apple sauce. I omitted raisins and added an extra half cup or carrots. I also followed the advice to let sit the dough for an hour and then add soda and bake. I spread the dough between 12 muffin tins and baked 5 minutes longer. The result is a mildly sweet substantial muffin with almost a carrot cake like flavor. They taste good the next day too. I will be baking these again with the modifications described above. My husband didn't care for them since they weren't very sweet. My kids and I liked them a lot.

Added 1/3 cup of apple sauce in as well because I thought the batter looked a little dry. I also doubled the pumpkin pie spice and vanilla. They turned out wonderfully. Cooked for 17 min.

The second time around I increased the amount of pumpkin pie spice to give the muffins more character.  The flavors were too subtle {for me}.  Thanks for the recipe Abby, they are definitely guilt-free and great to share outside of the home.

the only change I made was brown sugar in place of the honey as I didn't have any.  I added an egg and a couple of tbsp of apple sauce to replace the moisture and they were great!  I will definitely make these again...maybe with some walnuts or pecans, yum!

I love these!! I made a few changes, based on what I have in my measly student kitchen. I didn't have baking soda so I used baking powder (1:6 ratio... I was able to taste it but no one else could) blueberry yogurt, half carrot/half apple, plus a few Splendas thrown into the flour mixture and extra orange juice to make the dough wetter. They are extemely fluffy for whole wheat muffins, not necessarily very moist but light and airy. They're also not very sweet even with the Splendas, but I'm surprisingly pleased at the light sweetness and spice-cake flavour. My roommates loved them and I had to hide the extras. Thanks for the recipe!

These muffins are more of a dense muffin, and quite tasty. I substituted plain yogurt for the vanilla yogurt, and did a little less honey than the recipe called for. I also did not have any raisins on hand, so I just made strictly carrot muffins. I received wonderful review from those that tasted them, and will plan on making these again soon!

Pretty good, surprisingly light considering no eggs.  A little on the bland side, needs a touch more honey or maybe a bit of brown sugar.  Used plain yogurt and added extra tsp of vanilla.  Got 16 reg size muffins and cooked for 17 mins @ 350F.  Will make again with adjustments and am sure it will be tasty with cream cheese icing.

Good recipe!  Following others' advice, I wanted to punch up the flavor; instead of pumpkin pie spice I used probably a TB of cinnamon plus 1/2 tsp or so of nutmeg and allspice.  I was trying to make these as healthy as possible, so I reduced the oil to 1 TB melted butter.  I didn't have any raisins so I substituted 2 small chopped apples; because apples are moist, I threw in a handful of oatmeal.  BUT, the batter was so dry, I added another cup of yogurt.  These seem like a lot of changes, but I followed the rest of the recipe and really appreciated the framework.  They took 20 minutes to cook.

I used splenda sugar blend instead of honey and they were delicious. I accidentally increased the oil in the recipe. The batter is pretty dry but if you ball up the batter before dropping them into the muffin tin, you will get yummy muffins.

The muffins were a hit at our church coffee, but I did have to tweak the recipe. The batter was extremely dry so I added a 1/2 cup more yogurt and one egg. I also used the whole orange juiced.(add some walnuts, too) I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top and served with orange honey butter. Several ladies asked for the recipe, so we will be making them again.

I love this recipe because the muffins taste hearty and healthy, but they are still sweet so that everyone can enjoy them. 
A note on baking soda: the first time I made these, I followed another reviewer's tip and added the baking soda after I had mixed everything else together; I don't recommend this because mine ended up tasting like baking soda - not good! The second time though, I followed the normal mixing instructions and they were perfect. 
Substitution notes: I didn't have vanilla yogurt so I used lemon yogurt, which worked well (probably because the recipe also calls for orange juice, and lemon is tangy like orange juice). And, I used butter instead of vegetable oil since I think butter is more natural, and of course that worked well too. 
UPDATE: I've since made these a third time, and I accidentally added almond extract instead of vanilla extract - and whew, they still tasted great!

I added one more shredded carrot and another heaping 1/4 cup of raisins. For more orange flavor, I used orange juice CONCENTRATE instead of regular orange juice. Because the reviewers before me had issues with stiff batter, I did add a quarter cup or so (I didn't really measure, I eyeballed) of homemade applesauce. I was able to get 18 smallish muffins out of one recipe. Baked at 350*, they were done at 20 minutes. VERY moist, wonderfully chewy and very flavorful. All of us loved these muffins, even my muffin hating husband. This is one of the best muffins we've had in a while.

Tastes great. I reduced the honey by 1 Tbsp. and increased the yogurt by the same amount. It was not sweet at all and we loved it with veggie gravy as bisuits. Thanks for a very healthy recipe.

I LOVED this recipe!  I used strawberry yogurt instead of vanilla and subbed applesauce for half of the vegetable oil.  I also chopped some walnuts and added a few chopped apples.  The combination of yogurt, applesauce and honey made these muffins the perfect combination of sweet and satisfying.  I will definitely be making these again!

The recipe was very very moist.I adjusted the recipe to 1/2 because I wanted to experiment with the taste  before making a full batch of muffins. I added a lttle bit more orange juice,  2 tablespoons of sour cream and a quarter cup of walnuts to the recipe. I substituted the raisons  for cranberries. The baking time was 30 minutes.the muffins were yummy and very delicious and my husband loved them.I definitely plan to make a full batch of muffins and next time with my adjustment added.

I cut the recipe in half and used white whole wheat flour. I also had to use plain yogurt sweetened with honey to taste because I discovered too late that I was out of vanilla yogurt. Because of others' reviews about the muffins being too dry, I added 1 T. unsweetened applesauce. I got exactly 7 muffins, but they did have to cook a few minutes longer. The end result was a moist, slightly sweet muffin. This certainly tastes "healthier," but since I'm trying to cut sugar and unnecessary fats, it's perfect for me.

Used 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, didn't have enough honey so I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar, didn't have OJ so I used apple juice.  Added 6+ TBSP of apple juice and should have added more as the batter was more like a really, really thick dough.  They tasted okay but were kind of bland and felt like something was missing.

I have the halved the recipe (sort of).  1 cup White whole wheat flour, 1tsp baking soda, 1/2 cup carrot, 1 ounce box of raisins. rest of ingredients were the amounts stated in original recipe.  used non fat vanilla yogurt.  yielded 6 muffins baked for 20 minutes.  moist and tasty but a little salty.  would omit the salt next time.

I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour for a less dense muffin. I found the batter dry so I added more juice.

Made this as written and it was too dry. The batter wasn't even completely moist. I added an egg and had a go. They were quite dry and lacking flavor.

Perfect for a healthy muffin. The drier than usual mixture still makes for moist muffins, but you can also add moisture with no harm. The baking soda trick listed in reviews below may work well if you want to do it, but isn't necessary for a fluffy muffin, mine were fine without :) To lessen the mess, I tossed my carrots in the magic bullet and they still did great. Super easy to sub ingredients with what's on hand, next time I will do bananas or applesauce instead of oil just to mix it up and add health. Great base recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and found them to be really dry. I added skim mik to soften the dough a bit. In the end, they were okay tasting. Quite bland and hard once they cooled. Definitely not a keeper recipe for me.

These are awesome!  I didn't change a thing and my kids LOVE them...me too!  I make 2 batches and freeze them.  I take out a few each night to eat for breakfast or for a snack.  Super easy, too!
