i found that these cookies were really bland no matter what i tried, it called for half a stick of margarine i added a whole one, i added more chocolate chips, and i added brown sugar on top of the powderd sugar it called for. i would not make these again.

If there are chocolate chips in the recipe, the dish is not vegan.

I found this to be rather bland & dry.  I adapted it to a non-vegan recipe by using only margarine, adding a couple of splashes of condensed milk, 4 chocolate chips instead of one, and a dollop of honey after baking.  I also made drop cookies instead of rolling out & cutting (I wouldn't recommend drop method with these).  Even after all these changes, I agree that I wouldn't make these again, they're too dry and flat -tasting.
