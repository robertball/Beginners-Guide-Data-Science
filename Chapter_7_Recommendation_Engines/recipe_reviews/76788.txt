I altered this a little bit: I was baking my salmon, so I just mixed the ingredients together in a bowl (used much less water, and didn't use cooking spray or scallions), spread half of it over the salmon, covered and baked at 300* for 15 or so min, then spread the rest on, took the cover off, and cooked at 425 until done. PERFECT!!!!! served over rice, the only thing I regret is not making more sauce to serve with my rice.

Fantastic taste! I was not much of a salmon fan until I tried this recipe. We had company with children and they ask for seconds! I basted some on the salmon and grilled it, great taste and easy.

Good and easy. I fried my fish in a little sesame oil instead of grilling. Next time, I'll add a touch of crushed red pepper for a little heat.

This is a good recipe - I can see myself doing it again. My husband particularly likely the sauce - it's similar, actually better IMO, than the sauce for "thai chicken tenders" on this site. It'd be good on grilled chicken as well.

I really enjoyed this.  I covered the salmon filets in sauce and put it in the broiler.  Came out really delicious.  Would pair well with a bowl of brown rice for a healthy, tasty dish.

I made this last night in less than 45 minutes. I had all the items off hand and it was quite tasty. I put a little extra peanut butter and it made it extra rich. I think next time I will use crunchy peanut butter to add a little crunch. I also put a little bit of scallions in the sauce. 
I will also put a little more onion. I think Julienne carrots will also add to the sauce. 

I will definitely change it next time but really, its a very nice recipe.

Delicious flavor! I wouldn't have thought to use this sauce for salmon but it works.  My husband loved it and said it reminded him of Thai peanut sauce.  We'll save the leftover sauce and maybe use it with chicken. One thing I might do differently next time is add a little more water, as it was pretty thick.

I made this as a lunch for my one year old boy and myself. We both really liked it. It was very fast and easy to make. Next time I make it just for myself I may add a little red pepper or something to make it spicy. Will definitely make this again, and maybe try the peanut sauce with chicken too!

This was very yummy sauce with the grilled King we just ate, went well with broccoli and Thai sticky rice.  Will be repeated!!
