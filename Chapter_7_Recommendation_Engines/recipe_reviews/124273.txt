Haven't made this recipe but know from experience that the method of cooking is listed incorrectly. After cooking vegetable/pepper mix it is best to add a little flour to the mix about 1 tbsp. After that add milk simmer while whisking to insure that it doesn't curdle. Last add cheese about 1/4 cup at a time and mix until melted. To ensure proper consistency do not add to much cheese at once or it will clump and make a stringy consistency.

I will NOT be making this recipe again.  I love a good queso, but the consistency of this one was very wrong.  It was a blob of stringy cheese and very thin liquid.  The flavor was just ok, it needed a lot more spice.

Since chili con queso has always been one of my favorite any-time-is-the-right-time foods, I have experimented with many different methods for making really good chili con queso.  I have experimented on my own with the method used in this recipe and I can tell by reading it that it would be a mess.  I hate saying it, but as far as getting that creamy-smooth richness, nothing beats Velveeta.  After so many attempts at making queso, I've resigned myself to having to include at least some Velveeta in any cheese dip I make in the future.  I can get away with adding colby or monterey jack cheeses without getting that gritty texture if I don't go overboard.  But I get the most satisfying results with Velveeta, monterey jack, a little colby cheese, and a few slices of Kraft American deli slices.  That seems to get the texture right.  I add some chili powder and cumin.  Oh, and all this starts by simmering onions and petite-diced tomatoes until they're no longer watery.  Mixing water and cheese never turns into a good experience.

One of the few queso recipes that DOESN'T contain processed cheese food...finally! I'm from Albuquerque so this definitely reminds me of home...okay I spoke too soon. After I made this I found I didn't like the consistency. Too Bad, So Sad, guess I'm going back to Velveeta.

This was very good but I made a few changes...I used 5 cups of old cheddar instead, added 1/2 green pepper, an extra medium onion (2 total) and only used 1/2 cup of milk.

We were having friends over and were excited about making a good queso recipe.  We love queso, but won't make this recipe again.  Even using hot chilis, this recipe was very bland.  Also, the consistency wasn't what you normally see in good queso recipes.  it was stringy and started to separate and became very watery.  I was dissapointed with the result considering the time it took to prepare.

Took to long, expensive and was bland.  However, only myself to blame as I failed to view the previous post until after the fact.

I was able to somewhat salvage this recipe by adding a brick of cream cheese (fixed the consistency) and a can of diced tomatoes (for flavor). Still needs more work.

Not very good at all--The very best easy queso is Velveeta cheese and ro*tel tomatoes.
