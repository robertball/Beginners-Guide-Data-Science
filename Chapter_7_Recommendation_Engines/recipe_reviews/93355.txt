I've made this twice in the last two days for work events and these are TERRIFIC!  Perfect for breakfast!  SO TASTY!  Depending on the type of salsa and sausage you use, these can potentially be fairly SPICY.  I used regular on both and they still have a little bite to them.  These can be made ahead the night before and then in the morning I just pop them in the oven and you're good to go!  Will make again and again....

I made these the night before as another reader suggested and cooked them the next morning to bring to the office.  They were gone in minutes and everyone raved about them.  However, I made 22 with 2 piecrusts and I have leftover filling - I think the recipe will make around 30 or so.

This was a very tasty snack. I served these along side tomato soup.  I will probably make these again!

Followed the recipe exactly and these turned out great. I used mild salsa and it gave these enough flavor, medium or hot salsa would have been overpowering. One note - when the salsa & egg cook together it makes the insides look pink and one person thought I hadn't browned the sausage enough! Just thought it was worth mentioning.

My family loved these.  We had a family get to gether and they thought they were great.  I found them a little heavy but I am still getting use to American food.  Thank you for a good recipe.

Delicious! I only had shredded mozzarella so I used that instead of cheddar, but it was still delicious. Next time I think I will add some jalapeños to spice it up a little and maybe use Pepper Jack Cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

Instead of pie crust I use the flakey biscuits and pull the layers apart to make my crust.  The cooking time is shorter with the biscuits.

11.18.18  I scaled this recipe in half and ended up with 12 tarts.  I did sub Egg Beaters® for the eggs to reduce cholesterol, and that worked out fine.  I used medium salsa, but was looking for even a little more spiciness,  so I added a few red pepper flakes.  I must say that I wasn’t crazy about the cheddar cheese in these, I could see Monterey Jack or Pepper Jack cheese being more suitable, as well as using Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage (personal taste preference).   We enjoyed them for breakfast today garnished with some sour cream, chopped cilantro, and some tomatoes on the side.  I put the rest into a zip-lock bag and then into the freezer to be reheated for a quick, grab-and-go breakfast on a weekday.  Certainly would work great for game-day food, as well.
