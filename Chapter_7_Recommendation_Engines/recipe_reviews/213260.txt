This is the ultimate hot chocolate. What is better than rich hot chocolate mixed with homemade whipped cream? I made this following the recipe. I used Nestle cocoa powder and Ghiradelli chocolate. I used my aerolatte milk frother to mix to the chocolate and whipped cream together which I highly recommend using if you have one. It makes it extra creamy and frothy. I can't wait to make this next month when my family is in town for Christmas. You can reserve a small amount of the whipped cream for the top if you wish. Keep in mind this is a very rich hot chocolate. You can refrigerate leftovers and simply re-heat on the stove or microwave.

This tastes exactly like warm, melted chocolate ice cream.  It's great if that's what you like.

AMAZING! My family LOVED this hot chocolate! I doubled the recipe because we have four children and their only complaint was there wasn't enough.

WARNING - this will ruin you on any other hot chocolate ever...death by chocolate, but what a way to go.  As my hubby says, "that's bloomin amazin -- that's downright incredible that is!"  And he's American.  Not sure what secret power this creamy hot chocolate has to bring forth a British accent, but bring it forth it did.  THIS IS THE FINAL WORD on hot chocolate.  I whipped the heavy cream while the milk was heating (with and occasional stir) to save time.  Used Ghiradelli's sweet ground chocolate for the cocoa and regular Baker's semisweet as directed.  I also used whole milk.  To die for, I tell you.

This was very rich and quite delicious. I think it was too sweet, so if I make it another time I would cut down on the sugar. Good recipe!

All I have got to say is Extremly sweet!! I think it would be delicious just minus the baking chocolate. Or just use unsweetened so you still get the nice chocolate flavor minus the extra sugar. I will be making it again tomorrow with unsweetened chocolate squares for Christmas morning.

Too sweet in our opinion. Flavor was good but we didn't care for the texture- kind of like drinking chocolate foam.

It was very rich - which I like, but the rest of my family doesn't.  I also didn't stir it well enough, so there were chunks.

This was far too rich for my liking, but when we cut it half and half with regular milk it was really yummy.  One reviewer described it as hot melted chocolate ice cream.  That description is right on!

Honestly, this recipe is fabulous. I generally don't like hot chocolate (I've only had the packaged stuff...so awful). 

I topped ours with a dollop of homemade whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon...so good :)

RE: Photo   I needed some hot chocolate to go along with my whip cream.  x-D   This was awesome hot chocolate. I like that it doesn't include cream in the base so you can add cream instead of whip cream if you want to. You absolutely don't need sweetened cocoa powder, regular cocoa powder will do just fine.

Awesome.  Folding in whipped cream really takes this to another level.  I've started doing that in other hot chocolate recipes too.

This recipe is rich, rich, rich. I Used 6 cups of milk, at that measure, the sweetness really began to relax a bit and we ended  up with a very nice cup of chocolate. I would give it 5 stars for taste, but not as original recipe. Use the ingredients and cut it down to taste and you have a winner.

I'm not sure if i followed the recipe wrong, but it tasted exactly like melted fudge. I'm 14 and it was too rich for me, so think that's saying something. I will probably make it again, but i will have to make some adjustments.
