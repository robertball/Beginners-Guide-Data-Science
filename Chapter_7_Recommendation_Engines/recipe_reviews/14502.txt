I more than doubled the marinade for 2 tuna steaks, added 1 teaspoon brown sugar, a bit of oyster sauce, a dash of sesame oil, and chopped chives. Boiled the leftover of the marinade and thickened it to pour over the grilled tuna (I did pour more water in and seasoned it to make more sauce).

I substituted rice vinegar and sherry for rice wine vinegar and it added a great flavor!

absouletely perfect tuna!  it was so tender and flaky - the marinade definitely did the trick, although i added a touch of lime juice.

Delicious marinade! I pan fried the tuna with a small drizzle of oil for 3 minutes per side. That left the steaks pink in the middle, with great flavor and texture.

Great recipe, really good marinade.  Just make sure you get high quality tuna because tuna can taste pretty fishy, and I subsituted sherry for the rice wine and it tasted great.

This is an awesome recipe. Had a small party and made only 2 tuna steaks. Everyone ate both of them so quickly! It was soooo good! Great grilled, but also steamed it. Came out great! Definetly use LIGHT soy sauce, as this recipe is a little bit salty. Still great though! Thanks!

This recipe was very easy and extremely flavorful!  I will make this again.  I've made this with catfish too and pan fried it for 3 minutes each side.  That was very good as well.

This marinade is amazing.  Five stars for sure.  I docked one star for too long of a cooking time.  I prefer a just quick sear on each side.

2 out of 4 people I served this to liked it and I wasn't one of them. The flavor of the marinade really enhanced the fish-i-ness of the tuna steaks (which for me, is not a plus.) The leftovers were awesome the next day made into tuna salad sandwiches however!

This was very simple but I found it to be bland.  I had to add soy sauce on top for more flavor.

Really good!  I increased the amount of garlic and I marinated the steaks in the fridge longer than 30 minutes, but only because I had time.  And I didn't grill the steaks but rather pan fried them.  My only problem was that I cooked them just a tad too long.  I wanted them to have a pink center, but it cooked all the way through.  However, despite that, it still turned out delicious!  My bf and I both really enjoyed this meal.  Too bad tuna steaks are a bit pricey!

Very good marinade. I used the amount of marinade for 4 steaks but only had 2. Be sure if you like yours cooked rare or medium rare to only leave it on each side about 2 mintues. I did the first side for 3 and the second for 4 and it was fully cooked and almost starting to get dry.

My family LOVED this tuna, including my 12-year old!  I used a previous reviewer's suggestion and added some fresh lime juice.  Couldn't get any quick or easier!

The flavor was great, but this was a little too salty for me, even while using reduced sodium soy sauce. I think I may have to try this again by using half soy sauce half balsamic vinegar.

This recipe is great!  I like it better than the teriyaki tuna at my favorite Japanese restaurant.  I double the marinade and put half of it aside (before marinating) to use as a sauce when served. I use sashimi grade tuna and grill until medium.

I did this all wrong so my advice is for things NOT to do. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used dried. My grill ran out of gas so I broiled. I had rice vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar. DO NOT do any of these things with this recipe. It was OK, but not what I expected. I will try again - but with fresh ginger and a working grill. I'm sure it would be excellent!

YUM!!!  VERY flavorful marinade. I added 1/2 tablespoon of brown sugar and a bit of sesame oil to the marinade, which I had the tuna in for about 4 hours. Weather forced us to switch from the outdoor grill to stove top, but for my first time grilling tuna steaks, this was a great intro!!

I love the marinade. Instead of tossing it out, which in my opinion is a waste of great garlic and ginger, I sautéed the Tuna in a frying pan along with the marinade. Such a great flavor as the marinade cooks down. Just be careful not to overcook the tuna.

This was really good.  My husband who normally doesn't like fish and was skeptical about eating it, asked for me to put it on the list to make again.  I made only some minor alterations to recipes just because we prefer things a little bit more spicy so I added some seasoning and a little bit of lemon juicy.

This was delicious!  I also substituted seasoned rice wine vinegar for rice wine, and loved the results.  I served it with some pine-nut couscous, yum!

Excellent!!  Had intentions of doing on tuna fillets, but ended up not having them and subbing halibut fillets instead - they were exceptional (even our guest thought so)!  A keeper!

Very good, will make again.  Thought the ginger taste was a little overpowering, may add a little citrus next time to cut.  Do not overcook the tuna, 3-4 minutes a side is enough.

I made this last night with fresh tuna.  I only marinated it for half hour but definitely think it needs longer time. I actually made a sauce and pour it on top of the fish before serving which gave it a bit more flavor.  But we love it.  I made it medium well.

I let this marinate for a full 24 hours.  Cooked them rare on an indoor grill.  Made some couscous and sugar snap peas as sides.  OH MAN!  This was sooooo good!

Very easy and very flavorful! We found the tuna steak VERY filling. So much so that I couldn't eat much of my sidedishes. I liked the marinade a lot (especially with a bit saved on the side as a dipping sauce before being put in with the fish) but added a little bit of Lowry's marinade as well since I had a bit left in the fridge.

Very good recipes. We'll make this one again soon.

I followed the recipe as it reads, except I let it marinade about 3 hours and added about a tablespoon of lime juice. Excellent recipe.

I didn't change anything, however, I did let the Tuna sit in the marinaade for about two hours. I cooked it for about 2.5 minutes on each side and the six people I cooked it for LOVED IT..Awesome recipe.

Excellent, simple, and quick go to tuna recipe.  One of my boyfriends favorite fish dishes! We both rate it 5 star as written. Feel free to use garlic and/or ginger powder. I add sesame oil instead of vegetable oil into the marinade.

We just made this and loved it! It was just the right amount of flavor...delicious marinade, but it didn't overpower the flavor of the fish at all. Just right! I followed the advise of some other reviews...grilled each side 3 minutes, and added green onions and a pinch of brown sugar to the marinade. Also, I didn't have any rice wine, so instead I used a slash of red wine vinegar, and it was great!

Very good! Nice mild flavor. I also did not have rice wine so I used half brown rice vinegar and half sherry which was fine. For best results use fresh not frozen tuna. It was the very best tuna I have every made! Thank you for the recipe.

I brushed with olive oil, coated with black pepper and seared 21/2 min per side. I made a sauce to eat with it which consisted of soy sauce, worchestershire, teriyaki, salt and powdered sugar.

Followed the directions & let it marinade for 1 & 1/2 hrs since it said for at least 30 min.  No flavor. We put some teriyaki sauce warmed over & it was much better. Since using a bottle of teriyaki sauce we had worked so well, I'll just use that instead of going through mincing fresh ginger root & garlic.

This is perfect.  I wouldn't change it in any way.  I'm may use this marinade on other meats to.  

Well, I used it on center cut pork chops.  it was just as good.
