I have not personally made this recipe, but a friend has, and I have been lucky enough to eat it twice. It is fabulous! She modified the recipe in that she made the jalepeno sauce and the maque choux, and served them on a bed of white rice. This makes the recipe much simpler and it is still just wonderful.

This was awsome, though I actually liked the maque choux just by itself before all the cream and pasta... though the end result also was delicious

This was delicious!! My family loved it! I did not use any salted pork and used a pound of pork tasso instead. I also a little more jalepeno juice and peppers b/c we like our food a little spicier. Other than that, I followed the recipe. It makes A LOT of food so have when you invite company or expect leftovers! Even though it is a bit time-consuming, I definately recommend!

I only made two servings and it made a ton of food and was very filling.  I thought it was going to be over kill with all the carbs but tasted great.  I was unable to find the salted pork so substituted part of a pork roast and also substituted the sausage for ground med. italian sausage.  Was great.
It seems like a lot of work from the instructions but wasn't that bad.  Just a lot of dishes left over.  I will be saving this recipe to make on occasion.

A lot of work, but well worth the effort!  Although there are a lot of steps involved, they are not difficult.  Delicious!

This is just a review of the Jalapeno Cream Sauce, I haven't had time to make the entire recipe yet.  I had some friends over for a weeknight dinner so needed something fast. I made the sauce then tossed it with angel hair pasta and sauteed shrimp.  People were having second and third helpings.  The sauce is amazing.
