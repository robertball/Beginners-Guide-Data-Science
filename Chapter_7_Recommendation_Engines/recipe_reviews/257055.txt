So easy and tasty! I made these in the oven as a side dish to go with baked ham and also served collard greens on the side to balance all that pork and sweetness.  Will definitely makes this again.  Both my grown sons had seconds!

Easy and delicious. I used a little less oil then indicated and  small sweet onions that I had leftover in a jar.  All good,!
