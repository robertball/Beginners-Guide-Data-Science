This is a great salad and is so simple to make. And just in time for summer when the farmer's market is in full swing! I used normal tomatoes because I didn't have cherry tomatoes on hand and used toasted the pine nuts to bring out the flavor. I also added cranberries, which I think are a must. The sweetness compliments with the spicy/bitter arugula. My one last suggestion to let this salad sit for a few minutes. It tastes better that way. This is a keeper. I'll definitely make it again.

I like this with the Parmesan not grated but cut into thin slices. If you like Arugula, you'll like this salad. I substituted a normal vinegar instead of the rice vinegar and it still tasted yummy.

Very Good! My husband and I eat raddichio & arugula salad seasoned with olive oil and red wine vinegar everyday with dinner. This was a nice twist on our usual favorite. I did use our red wine vinegar in place of rice vinegar and omitted the avocado since I didn't have one. Still excellent - Thanks Kelli

I made this salad last night with some organic arugula. I used sesame seeds instead of pine nuts, but kept everything else the same. It was fast and extremely tasty!

I don't think arugula is at its best on its own. It's so peppery and pungent I think that it's better combined with another, milder green. Even so, this was still rather ho-hum in flavor, which surprised me because I liked the combination of ingredients. The dressing also reaffirmed for me that I like a ratio of 3:1 oil to vinegar, not 2:1. Too tangy and peppery as written.

UNBELIEVABLE.  The Parmesan and the dressing go together perfectly and really complement the zippiness of the arugula.  I used a homemade nut/seed mix (pumpkin seeds, roasted soy nuts, walnuts) instead of the pine nuts because I didn't have them, and it was still great.  I also added dried cherries for color and a touch of sweetness - just the thing!  You could also use craisins.  The presentation was beautiful and the taste was out of this world.  I couldn't get enough of it!

Very good salad. I used mixed greens instead of just arugula and shredded parmesan instead of grated. I also added dried cranberries and toasted the pine nuts as suggested by others. Place the avocados on right before serving to keep fresh. *To toast pine nuts put them in a non stick fry pan dry (no oil). Cook on medium-low and shake to mix every 30 seconds or so. They are done when light brown. Place on a plate to cool.

This is so good! The first time I made it as written with olive oil. It was delicious! Now, I make a simpler version almost daily to bring to work for lunch: arugula, dried cranberries or golden raisins, and all-natural boar's head tuscan turkey from the deli. I mix olive oil & rice vinegar, and when it's time to eat, pour over the salad and shake. It's so good, filling, and easy!

This was outstanding! Tell the truth, it was 100 times better than I expected. I followed exactly except I used fresh tomatoes from my garden instead of the cherry tomatoes and skipped the avocado. I think I will make this the next time I have to take a dish to a party!

This was so easy to make and incredibly delicious! I used pecans instead of pine nuts and balsamic vinegar instead of the rice vinegar, and it was still fantastic. Will make it again and again!

A fantastic salad. Lovely presentation. Very simple, quick, accessible ingredients. Fabulous flavor. I always get rave reviews. A favorite when arugula is plentiful at the farmer's market. Avocado is wonderful addition, but a great salad even without. Thanks for this keeper!

I was surprised that the simple dressing was so good with this salad.  I looooove arugula, it doesn't need much to compliment the spicey flavor. I did add a little red onion and some candied walnuts instead of the pine nuts. Also I added some fat free feta.  Was fabulous!

We get our arugula (and other lettuces) from a local organic farm. I never knew what to do with the arugula. . . I used to mix it with the regular salad. We were not fans of this. 

After searching allrecipes.com, I discovered this fantastic recipe. This is my husband's favorite gourmet item. He can't get enough of it. We highly recommend it.

I've made this salad twice and it is really yummy. Like some other reviewers, I prefer shaved parmesan on mine. The only problem that keeps me from making it more often is the cost of the ingredients. It's not exactly a bargain.

This is fabulous! I couldn't find arugula so used other greens. Instead of tossing all ingredients together, I arranged the greens, tomatoes, pine nuts, parmesan and dried cranberries (rather than avocado) on individual plates. I combined the oil and vinegar, salt and pepper and drizzled this over the top. My husband raved. Will definitely make this one again.

Good salad!  The dressing tones down the peppery taste of the arugula a bit.  I did toast the pine nuts.

My new favorite salad!  The only change I made was to toast the pine nuts first to give it a more nutty flavor.

I never thought I needed a recipe for salad.  This was fantastic though.  I didn't have any pine nuts, so I substituted some sunflower seeds.  Beyond that, I didn't change a thing.  Great salad!

Excellent recipe.  It's easy to make and tasty to eat.  Here's what I did. I toasted the pine nuts before using them.  I had no cherry tomatoes so I cut two roma tomatoes into pieces the size of a cherry.  I added 1/4 of a red onion, thinly sliced.  I increased the amount of Parmesan cheese to 1/2 cup.  I used 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper in the dressing.  I tossed the salad ingredients gently first.  Then I whisked together the dressing ingredients.  Finally, I added the dressing to the salad and tossed everything gently but thoroughly.  My husband and I loved the result.

This was awesome. I did not have any arugula on hand, so I used spring mix lettuce with the rest of the ingredients the recipe called for.  Delicious and easy!

Fabulous!!!!  I've been eating this for a few weeks straight (sometimes for lunch & dinner).  Its so easy to make a large batch of dressing & just pour over your salad. Tastes great w/ baby spinch also.  I omit the avocado, but just cause I'm lazy.  Highly recommend this quick & simple salad.

This is a very good salad!  My store didn't have any arugula (crazy, I know) so I used a bag of mixed baby greens that included arugula.  It worked very well.  I loved the flavors in this salad.  Everything went great together.  The parmesan, the pine nuts (which I toasted about 30 minutes prior to making this, in order for them to cool) and the dressing.  So easy too!  It's great to have a use for my grapeseed oil.  I enjoyed shaking this in my bowl too.  Great recipe!

I made the stupid mistake of buying arugula at the store - what was I thinking? - and it was practically tasteless. Although you could make this recipe work with any kind of lettuce, I'm going to try again in the summer when I can use my own homegrown arugula leaves. Thanks anyway!

I was so thrilled that we had all the ingredients on hand until I realized ... ooops, the grapeseed oil was rancid.  Goodness knows how long it had been in the pantry; many years, I'm sure.  And the rice vinegar was "seasoned" with high fructose corn syrup and brown sugar (?? I can't even imagine why I ever bought that).  But it worked out with extra virgin olive oil and added a sweetness. I think this salad is very forgiving to allow for personal preferences. I didn't do "the shake" because I still don't understand the point of that, versus a whisk of the dressing and toss of the salad.  In the end, with more arugula and more pine nuts (toasted), we loved it!  Thank you.

this is a go to salad recipe. delicious! i LOVE arugula and this really just brings out the best of it.. pine nuts, great addition. i add a little honey to give the dressing a bit of sweetness to play off the bitterness of the arugula and the tangyness of the vinegar.

Excellent just as is!  I'm not a huge Arugula person but had some from another recipe and needed to use it.  So glad I found this recipe!  My father, who rarely eats vegetables of any sort, cleaned his plate. Simple and delicious!  Next time I might try toasting the pine nuts, but that's minor.  Great recipe.

Great salad.  I used a grated romano/asiago/parmesan blend and sesame seeds instead of pine nuts, but reduced the amount of seeds to 1/8 cup.

really really good.  only changes i make are cutting the oil back to 1 tbsp and omitting the avocado.  usually will add somes sliced red raw onions and maybe some sliced pears or other type of fruit for a bit of sweetness.  best part of this recipe is that this is so easy to make.

Served this with the Mushroom and Leek soup on this site - Fabulous!  I did add a handful of dried cherries  - as other reviewers recommended - which added alot of flavor and was really nice with the arugula.  This is a keeper.

I took the advice of another reviewer and used extra virgin olive oil, shredded parm cheese and 1 T of honey. I will use this recipe with the modifications again. I also substitued walnuts for pinenuts.  All the substitutions were made because I had those ingredients on hand.

Oh my gosh.  This recipe is so simple but so tasty.  I will admit I added a splash of lemon juice after tasting it, but that was the only change I made.  Can't wait to make this for guests.  Making it again tonight and only made if for the first time three nights ago.  Just can't get enough!

What a delicious, easy-to-make salad! I didn't have rice vinegar, so I used white balsamic vinegar instead. I eliminated the avocado too. This will be my go-to salad from now on.

This was so simple and so good. I used regular tomatoes and a blood orange olive oil. Will make this again.

Loved it! Such a big fan of Arugula. I broiled a skirt steak and had it with this but my husband and I both agreed that it would have been wonderful sliced thinly over salad. The dressing on this salad is delicious! Thanks for sharing.

Good taste overall, but add the parmesan cheese sparingly when tossing the salad and sprinkle some on top with a few of the tomatoes and pine nuts - for presentation. I found the finely grated parmesan absorbed most of the liquid and made the dressing a bit gummy. I will make it again - it tasted great!

Easy to make. I can't always find arugula, so a Spring mix is good, too. I substitute the tomatoes for craisins and I toast the pine nuts beforehand. Delicious!

You really can't go wrong with this salad. Sometimes I swap out the Parmesan for feta. Also, I would recommend toasting the pine nuts - that extra crunch is great.

Fantastic!!!  I did several things that I gleaned from other recipes: mixed the dressing in a bowl and added the parmesan to the dressing as well as some lemon zest.  I did not have pine nuts so used walnuts and tossed in a handfull of crasins.  Really super!!

This tops my favorites for salad recipes. This is SO easy and tasty. The only things I did differently was make it with a blend of arugula and baby spinach, plus I toasted the pine nuts...really brings out the depth of the nut flavor. My husband has asked for this twice in the last week and said he would happily eat it with every dinner. Quite the hit!!

I made for lunch yesterday and we really enjoyed.  My only change would be next time to wait to do the dressing as the salad got a little wilted sitting in the fridge as we did not eat right away but the taste was still good.

This salad is always a hit with friends and family. The rice vinegar (instead of balsamic vinegar allows all the flavor to come through). For a meal, I toss in some diced grilled chicken. Yummy, yummy.

This salad was excellent.  I added cranberries as someone suggested, but I think it gave a little odd flavor.  Instead next time I am going to add roasted red & yellow peppers and bacon.  The dressing is excellent.  I used the rice vinegar as the recipe called for.  Thanks so much.  UPDATE:  this salad is such a hit.  I have people always asking for the recipe.  It tastes great with the roasted red peppers.  I chopped up the peppers on the side so people could add what they wanted.

only four out of five because although there was nothing wrong with it, it wasnt anything to terrific.  if i have the ingredients i would throw it together again but in the meantime im still looking for something more impressive.  also the shredded parm cheese is much better than the grated for this one.

Wow! What a great salad. The combination of tastes and textures is amazing. I don't have a plastic bowl with a lid, so I just tossed it, and it was perfect. Toast the pine nuts for extra flavour - careful, they burn easily. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This is such an easy and delicious recipe. Made it for a church meeting/dinner. Three of us don't like cheese, so I separated a small bowl out and omitted the cheese. Sooooooo good. I toasted the pine nuts and made it with a bag of arugula, a bag of baby spinach and 2 romaine hearts. This is my new favorite salad!!

This was delicious and so easy. My husband and 5 year old really liked it. I used a regular tomato and didn't use avocado because I didn't have one. Next time I'll be sure to use an avocado.

This is one of my favorite salads!  Love, love, love the healthy dressing!  I make it in smaller portions for lunch and toss in a little tuna.  The dressing is great on spring mix and spinach too.  I've used sliced almonds and/or sunflower seeds as a sub for the pine nuts.  Also yummy with shredded parmesan instead of grated!

This is very good and I will definitely make again. I love arugula and the combination of everything in this salad is perfect.  I used toasted almond slivers instead of pine nuts (although I do LOVE pine nuts, just didn't have any).  Parmasan I grated in shavings.  Made a bit of extra dressing.  Avocado really made it.  Thanks!

This salad is so simple and yet so amazingly awesome. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of the grapeseed oil because that's what I had on hand. I also used shredded parm cheese instead of the grated because I like the larger pieces that you get.

Loved this salad, I added a little extra rice vinegar, and a splash of red vinegar just because I like it really tangy. I also added about a half packet of splenda to the dressing, just to give it a little sweetness.  I ended up having to use an arugula mix because the market didn't have arugula. It was so good, even my friend who said she doesn't really like salad loved it.

Arugula is my favorite green. This is a wonderful way to serve it. Easy to make, with wonderful ingredients. The parmesan is the perfect accompaniment. I will make this as often as I can get arugula.

I wasn't at all impressed.  It was easy and wasn't bad by any means, but I'd prefer to take only a couple extra minutes to throw together a nice tossed salad with a few more fresh ingredients and a good choice of salad dressing.  I won't be making this again.

Excellent! The flavors blended wonderfully! Arugula can taste bitter if you don't have the right balance of flavors and this recipe is perfection! I did add some dried cherries as another reviewer suggested and did not use the avocado. Thanks for an awesome salad!!

Very nice side salad for Italian dishes or savory pies. Like another reviewer said, it's even better when the parmesan is sliced, not grated. Didn't use the avocado because I couldn't find any ripe ones for a last minute side dish but I will next time...

I really enjoyed this as a big salad for dinner. I used what I had on-hand. Regular tomatoes and pecans in place of the pine nuts. Per some of the reviews, for sweetness I added dried fruits. I had a mixture of blueberries, cranberries and cherries that worked perfectly here. I shaved some of the parmagiana-regiano pieces into the salad. I had some good quality balsamic vinegar on hand, so I used that.  I also like the oil to vinegar ratio to be more of a 3:1 ratio; I used that so at least I would enjoy the salad more! Thanks for a great starting point for a really delicious salad!

Very good.  I also like the fact that it is different. Simple to make.  I would however suggest adding more arugula or other salad greens. I added some Bibb lettuce, but that made it just barely enough to serve 4.  I will add more greens next time I make it. Add the dressing at the last minute.  After the dressing goes on, it's sort of like spinach...it "cooks" down.

This is one of my "go-to" salad recipes.  It's super easy and tastes just great, I can't get enough!  I usually end up omitting the avocado because I tend to put leftovers in the fridge for the following day and I don't like the texture of the avocado after it's been sitting exposed for a while, but I don't find that this particular omission takes away from the salad at all.

Made this salad last night to go with Lemon Dijon Wings (which I also got the recipe from AR) ... this salad was very delicious and nice.  I used Apple Cider Vinegar and Olive Oil ... added two green onions and some fresh crumbled bacon ... 3 of us ate it and there was none left!  It was a great side dish with the wings and the avocados were super great on top!

I would give this a 4.5 star rating if I could.  It was fresh, relatively easy. I roasted the pine nuts for extra flavor.

This was the first time my family and I have tried arugula.  After reading a few other reviews I made the following changes to the recipe and we all loved it: added 1/4 c. dried cranberries for some sweetness, toasted the pine nuts, and used 1/2 c. of homemade guacamole thinned with a little olive oil and rice vinegar for a more flavourful dressing.  I used parmesan shards for the "gourmet" look.  The salad had the perfect cooling effect after serving a spicy garlic shrimp dish. My kids loved it too!

wonderful! Best salad I've had in a long time.  I made it exactly as stated and it turned out perfectly.  Next time I think I will try toasted slivered almonds on top.  This is a quick and delicious salad and I will definitely be making it again!

I didn't have all of the ingredients so I substituted walnuts for pine nuts and feta for Parmesan. I'm not a big fan of vinegar so I cut the vinegar back to a tsp and added Mrs. Braggs instead of salt. Terrific!

This salad is so delicious and so simple to make. I happened to have orange flavored grapeseed oil so I used that. The light citrus taste gave this salad some extra oomph and brought it from good to great. I highly recommend a citrus flavored oil in the dressing. YUM!

I don't know why this is so good. It's super simple, but tastes great and is pretty. What more could you ask for? I used shredded parmesan, because that's what I had, and liked it. I think bigger pieces would be good, too, but I wouldn't use grated. This was my first time using arugula (by itself) in a salad.

This was our first experience with argula and it wasn't a very good one.  The problem with this is in the dressing.  It's just too oily for our liking.  My husband who has been very good about all my recent cooking experiments, wouldn't eat this.  This is the first time that he didn't eat something that I made.

Wonderful combination of flavors - and very easy.  Toast the pinenuts for added flavor. I did add some red onions and also added a splash of lemon to the dressing.

Very good!  Subbed sunflower seeds for the pine nuts because of an allergy.  The contrast between the crunch of thee seeds and the creaminess of the avocado was great.

Very tasty.

I used candied walnuts in place of pine nuts, and added dried cranberries, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I liked the rice vinegrette, it had a delicious flavor with the strong arugula.

Very easy salad to make and so good!  I added dried cranberries and raisins.  I also added pumpkin seeds as well as using pine nuts.  I think walnuts or sunflower seeds would work well with this salad too.  I didn't have rice vinegar so I combined grape seed oil and red wine vinegar and used that instead.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I didn't have parmesian so I used goat cheese which is creamy. I broke it into chunks and when I tossed the salad it made a creamy dressing with some chunks of cheese. I also used grape tomatoes that I roasted the day before. It was so yummy that I made it again the next day. My husband who normally does not like arugula loved this salad!

Simple and good.  I replace roasted slivered almonds for the pine nuts, because I don't have pine nuts.  I leave off the avocado, because I'm lazy.  Still very good.

This salad is awesome and SO easy!!  We made it for our Christmas Eve luncheon with our family. It was a big hit!  Left off the avocado, but that would have been good, too.Used fresh ground Parmesan instead of the canned type which gave it a lot more fresh flavor.  The pine nuts are a great addition. One tip: don’t put the dressing on the salad until you are ready to toss and serve it right away. Otherwise the salad will wilt, even though it still will taste good.

Easy, fresh and so pretty. I used shaved parm and toasted the pine nuts. This is really good without the avocado, too. I served it with jerk chicken, asparagus and parmesan roasted potatoes. The spicy, sweet combo was fantastic.

This was a good solid recipe. I followed others advice and did a mixture of spinach and arugula. Next time, I might just do the arugula. The dressing is sweet and the Arugula would have had the peppery bite it needed to balance out the dressing. While not a 5 star salad, this was SO EASY to put together, I am going to make it again.

This was very good, and I hate to review things after making changes to the original recipe, but I didn't think full arugula would be as good. I did 2 cups arugula and 2 cups mixed lettuce. I also threw in some chopped prosciutto. Yum!

I didn't care for this. I didn't have the pine nuts, so I didn't make it perfectly, to be fair. The arugula alone was too much - I think mixed greens would be better. The tomatoes and avocado were nice, but the dressing only encouraged the very strong taste of the arugula instead of complementing it.

Didn't measure anything just threw it together. Used sunflower kernels in place of pine nuts. Delicious and a great way to use up Arugula.

I am a fan of arugula and light dressings, so this salad was perfect for me.  I crushed the pine nuts and lightly toasted them in a skillet with a few drops of the oil/vinegar mixture.  This prevented the pine nuts from falling to the bottom of the bowl as the smaller pieces will stick to the lettuce, and really enhanced each bite.   We were out of avocado so I did without and the salad was still delicious.  Will add the avo next time!

I used half romaine, half arugula.  This was delicious!  Don't skip the avocado.  It made the salad for me, along with the spicy arugula.

Easy to make and delicious. I tripled the recipe for my 10 person New Year's Eve dinner and everyone enjoyed it.  I made two changes -  I toasted the pine nuts in a pan beforehand and I did not add the avocado because I wanted a lighter salad to go with the heavy World's Best Lasagna that I also made. I agree with another reviewer that you could change the vinegar and it would still be great.

I mixed all the dressing/topping ingredients (except for avocado) first because I needed to make it in advance.  Probably a mistake - it was a huge blob in the bowl.  However, I scooped the blob into the bowl of arugula and tossed it with tongs and it all spread out nicely then I topped with the avocado.  Got rave reviews and I will definitely be making this again.  But won't premix:)

This is an amazing and very simple recipe.  I love arugula, and there are so few ingredients, and things I always have on hand.  I can't believe how fabulous the flavor was.  I will make this again and again.

Super easy and tasty. I didn't have any pine nuts so added sunflower seeds instead and it still tasted great. Everything you need is already in your cupboard. Will try it next time with some avocado.

So simple to put together and yet so flavorful. Will definitely make it over and again. We do not like pine nuts and so I substituted them with candied pecans. The rest was as per recipe.

Made this with following changes, based on pantry and fridge availability:

Cheddar instead of parmesan
Red Wine Vinegar and Lemon juice instead of Rice Vinegar
No avocado (although I imagine this is a fantastic add-on)

Basically, I find arugula to be amazing, and this recipe dressed it appropriately and the ingredients helped to balance the peppery bite of the greens.  Would definitely make this again, perhaps more in line with the recipe!

Everyone in my family loved this salad!  I used baby arugula and toasted the pine nuts.  I also substituted champagne vinegar in the dressing (which I doubled when I saw how much 4 cups of greens looked like in the bowl).

Very good salad--we made it for my church's Sweetheart Dinner. I know some people aren't fond of just using arugula, so we used Dole's "Spring Mix" bagged salad. Wonderful variety of flavors and greens! Pairs well with a balsamic vinaigrette.

I made following changes: sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts. I really liked the rice vinegar. Avocado helps mellow out the peppery taste of arugula, but this is still too strong to be a large salad imo. Can be mixed with pasta for a 1-dish meal.

Hubby and I liked the salad - kids (teenagers) did not. They both thought the arugula was too bitter to be the only green in a salad. And while hubby and I liked it, the recipe was nothing special. Probably will not make again.

I made this salad with sliced, blanched almonds instead of pine nuts simply because I had the almonds at home.  This is a great salad, easy to make and was very well received.  Love these kinds of recipes!!

I wasn't a fan of this salad.  The parmesan was overpowering and the arugula just couldn't stand on it's own.  I think this salad would be better if another type of green was paired with the arugula.

This was my 1st time trying arugula. I never had it before but recently heard someone say "Arugula not lettuce in a salad", so I just had to try it.  I LOVED this salad!!  I used walnuts because I didn't have any pine nuts, everything else was as listed. It was delicious!!  I'm making it again today and am going to try some dried cranberries and feta cheese along with the other ingredients.  (BONUS - My 15 yr old daughter also enjoyed it) Thank you KELLID26 - it's scrumptious!!!

It was by far the worst arugula salad I have ever tasted. It was just gross and inedible.  Flavors simply didn't work. Arugula needs some sweetness to counterbalance the weird bitterness/pungency and every single ingredient of this salad only made it worse. Avocado was one ingredient that I think only made everything particularly worse by making things greasy and buttery.

Left out the parm (intolerant) also used red wine vinegar as that is what I had in addition to an arugula mix as that was what was available at the store. Simple, but very good!

This was a great salad.  I could not find arugula but used several other lettuces instead.  It was so tasty and entire my family enjoyed it.  The combination of avocado, Parmesan and pine nuts was amazing.  I will definitely make this again.  I paired this with Spinach Quiche.

This was a really simple salad I chose to make for my boyfriend and I because he is not particularly fond of heavy dressing's and because I love arugula. We both really enjoyed it, the only changes I made was using orange pepper instead of avocado because I did not have any and I added craisins for the added sweetness . Will be making this again soon.

I made this as written except I sadly did not have any avocado.  However, I don't think that it would have helped us like this salad any more.  We found we did not like the arugula in this salad, it had too much of a peppery and bitter flavor for us.  It was unfortunate because we like all the other ingredients.  For our tastes, if I were to try this again, I would only use a little or no arugula and replace it with another type of green.

These flavors are great together.  I shaved the parmesan with a vegetable peeler instead of grating it, but other than that I used the recipe exactly.  Easy, tasty and beautiful.

Super easy and healthy.  Your guests will think you are a gourmet cook.  Who knew arugula and rice vinegar could be such a great mix?  When people ask me what is in it, they are amazed.  Never any leftover salad in the bowl, either!
