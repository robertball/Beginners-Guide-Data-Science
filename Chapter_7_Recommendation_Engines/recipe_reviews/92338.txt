This was very good, im not giving a five star though because I strongly feel that any "sauce" that is intended for the top of steaks should be cooked after the steak is done in the wonderful brown bits in the pan.  Thats what i did, after cooking the steak i removed, let rest, added onion and mushrooms, red wine, salt, pepper, and at the end tablespoon of butter. Great on top of the steak.  I served the whole thing on top of soft polenta. really good.

I've made this recipe 3 times in the last month.  My daughter liked it so much, so requested this for her birthday dinner.  The red wine adds a lot of flavor to the mushrooms.  I found I like a mixture of different mushrooms. The last time I prepared the "rub", I tripled the recipe and placed the extra in a small glass jar so I can prepare again quickly.

I loved the seasonings for the steaks!!! It was delicious!  I do not drink or use alcohol in cooking, so I substituted apple cider vinegar for the wine and it was very good.

I love the seasonings used for this steak. I prepared the steaks using rib eye as it was what I had on hand. For the seasoning mix, I minced up some fresh thyme rather than dried, chopped up 1 garlic clove, mixed these with rock salt, black pepper, and paprika. I rubbed the seasonings into the rib eye steak and let it sit like that in the refriegerator for a couple of hours. In a skillet I added olive oil, heated up on medium high heat. I fried the steak on one side, searing it, until it was golden brown, before turning it over to other side. When the steaks were done, I set them aside to rest and to let the juices redistribute while I sauteed the mushrooms. To the same skillet I added 2T butter, shallots and 1 garlic, chopped up and I stirred it up with all the brown bits in the pan. then I added the mushrooms, sliced in half, stirred, added white wine, not red wine, and cooked it for a few minutes. The seasonings added a nice flavor to the steaks and also to the mushroom sautee. I really liked the flavor of the fresh thyme. The wine also adds flavor to the mushrooms along with the brown bits mixed in. My only small criticism is with the submitter's cooking method to use two separate skillet's whereas you could use the same skillet to prepare both the steak and mushrooms. The brown bits from the steaks is what really adds more flavor to the mushrooms. I topped the mushrooms on the steaks and served it along with Rosemary Zuchhini Sticks, also from this website.

This wasn't too bad. I really like sauteed onions and mushrooms but neither I nor my roommates particularly liked the flavor that the red wine added (and they're both wine people). The rub for the steak was good, though, so I think I'll just use the rub and top with plain onions and mushrooms next time.

Fabuous!  Used 1 lb. of Angus flank steak instead of New York strip and grilled it on the George Foreman.  Served it with Maple Dill Carrots.  Great combo!

Excellent steak recipe!  Other than the fact that I doubled the amount of thyme, which I strongly recommend, I followed the instructions and amount of ingredients as suggested and it turned out great!  I served this dish with marinated peppers from allrecipes.com along with a side-dish of tomato-basil pasta and had a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon (Gato Negro) from Chile and wow, it was a great combination!  I will definitely make this steak recipe again!

This is an incredible recipe.  Follow the recipe exactly.  The thyme is the key to the tangy and bold taste.  I would definitely recommend this to any steak lover!

Good Recipe, everyone loved it.  We prepared the steaks with the spices like suggested.  But we cooked our steaks out on the grill instead of searing them in a pan, Very nice and juicy.  Mushrooms, shallots and wine very nice addition to the steaks.  Will make again.

Excellent.  My husband said that he didn't like beef until he moved here as a young man because his mother pan fried it to death.  So I have NEVER put a steak anywhere but on a grill.  But it was too cold to grill so I tried this and it was wonderful.

Really liked the flavor of the thyme in this one. I used one pound of sliced button mushrooms and put in some frozen diced onion instead of shallots. Didn't measure the wine. Reduced down a bit.

This was outstanding! The only change I will make in the future is to add more red wine. This was so elegant and delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

this particular recipe is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITES!!! When I first started dating my husband it was the very first thing I cooked (knew it would make a good impression). When I served it, I found out he doesn't like mushrooms. He still tried it and to this day he tells everyone about how I got him to eat mushrooms :) def worth a shot!!!

The mix of ingredients is great, but the recipe is backwards and wastes all of the great juices the steak will make. It's not in the Bible, but that's a great sin!  Make the steak first and then cook the shallots and mushrooms in the pan. When you add in the wine, scrape all the amazing steak bits up and let them mix with the sauce.  This tastes way better than just making the sauce with butter. It also saves a pan!

I only used the rub, but it was delicious. My husband, who's not a red-meat lover thought it was great as well. I DID use a nice cut of beef, but I still think the rub added a great flavor.

I didn't like the rub at all on this.  The mushrooms and sauce were okay, but not all that fab.  The rub overpowered the steak and was WAY to salty.

Followed the recipe with the following exception. After frying the steaks in the skillet,  I took them out and did the onion, mushrooms, red wine to deglaze the goodies left in the skillet from the fying of the steaks. Kept the steaks on a plate to warm in the oven until I was ready to serve them with this fantastic topping. Served with boiled carrot and mash potatoes.

I had an 8 oz. package of mushrooms that really needed to be used up, which is what led me to this recipe.  I bought some beautiful filets for this, rather than using the NY strip steaks, and as suggested by other reviewers, I halved the rub mixture.  We grilled these instead of pan searing.  And, when plating, I made a bed of mushrooms and topped it off with the filets, reserving a few mushrooms for the top and added a sprig of parsley for color.  Although the flavor of this was excellent, next time I will try this with white wine.  I think the red wine discolored the mushrooms and gave them a grayish appearance. But, still very good and something we will make again!!  Thank you, Lemonpie!

Just made this for dinner tonight.  My husband and I both loved this recipe.  Thanks so much for posting it.  I used scotch fillet.  The only modification I made was to use garlic flavoured butter to fry the mushrooms.  We ate this dish with roasted asparagus and steamed broccoli. This is a keeper.

Fairly quick and easy, with nice results.  Also good because I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  I used t-bone steak because I needed to get rid of it.  I put the mushroom sauce back in the pan with the meat to simmer a few minutes to hopefully soften the meat a little.  I put the meat and sauce over mashed garlic potatoes to soak up the sauce.  I was pleased with the results and will use the recipe again.

I just made the mushroom as I had already marinated my steaks.  Also, did not have any red wine so used balsamic vinegar.  Delicious accompaniment!

I made this dish exactly as directed in the recipe.  We thought it was good but not "wow."  It was easy to make so if I catch NY strip on sale I will probably make it again.

I didn't make the sauce at all--I just wanted a rub, and this recipe fit the bill without the sauce.  I used fresh thyme, so used closer to a tablespoons worth.  Bf thought this wasn't that flavorful, but I disagree.  I used extremely thin steaks that fried up in just a few minutes--good for sandwiches, I guess, but we ate them by themselves.  I may try with the sauce next time, but bf isn't a big fan of sauces with wine, so I thought I'd skip.  Thanks for the recipe!

We used top loin steaks and loved the rub (used chopped garlic instead of garlic powder). We cooked the steaks first and then cooked the mushrooms in the steak drippings-so good! We used a cast iron pan and they definitely didn't need such long cooking times!

I'd give the mushroom's a 5 for this recipe, but the steak rub was not very good, would only rate it a 2, to much salt and thyme. Will definetly make the mushrooms again, but not with this steak rub!

What an amazing dish!  It really is not that difficult at all.  It was even easier for me because I had hubby cook the steaks on the grill!  My only complaint, and it might just be a personal preference, is that the steak is overseasoned.  I found the rub a little overwhelming, and though I liked the flavor, I would cut it in half next time.  I added 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. fresh ground black pepper to the mushrooms and was very pleased with how those turned out.  Loved the red wine! I served this with Montreal Seasoned Mashed Potatoes from this site, a salad and a nice bottle of Cabernet.

I really enjoyed the flavor of the spice rub.  I normally just season my steaks with a bit of salt and pepper but this was a nice change.  The mushrooms were excellent on top and provided a good contrast to the meat.  I added a bit more wine and let the sauce simmer a little longer but that's it.  Great recipe!

The spices are excellent. I rubbed them on the steak, then pan-fried them in canola oil. (I would have tried olive oil, but was out of it.) After the steaks were cooked, I removed them from the pan. I then added the mushrooms to the pan (without all the other ingredients). After the mushrooms were cooked, I put them on top of the steak. Very tasty. I think I will make up a big batch of the seasoning to have easily on hand for other times!

Absolutely outstanding.  I decided to try this on a whim and was so pleased at how easy it was to make(and the taste was delicious).  I have to admit I substituted a better cut of meat (tenderloin) - but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I made this for myself and my roommate/bestie, who is picky when it comes to food (especially steak, and what's on it). 
I followed the recipe exactly, except for one change I'd made in the cooking:  I broiled the steaks (I broiled ours to medium-well) instead of pan-frying, and they came out absolutely delicious...even my bestie LOVED it!  Will definitely make again!

I made this with the ingredients as written, but following other reviewers’ suggestions and cooking the steaks first, sticking them in a warming oven when done, then preparing the shallot and mushrooms in the same pan. Delicious! The steak had a subtle smoky flavor from the paprika, and the mushrooms were wonderful. The dish was easy to prepare, and the ingredients are basic items most of us would already have on hand with the possible exception of the shallot; I think garlic might work well as a substitution for the shallot if necessary. As I always do when using dried herbs, I crushed them first with a mortar and pestle to release the oils/flavor; just crush them between your fingers if you don’t have a mortar and pestle. When I make it again I may add more thyme...and definitely more mushrooms because they were too, too good. I may also experiment with using fresh rosemary instead of thyme just to switch things up a little since I grow rosemary and always have it on hand.

I was low on ingredients so I didn’t follow this exactly. I didn’t have any Thyme is excluded that, as well as the mushrooms, and olive oil. I used butter instead. Steak turned out really good and I loved the seasoning even without the thyme. Thanks for the recipe will probably make this again but next time with the thyme and mushrooms.

JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! Had to double the recipe and it was fabulous! I cooked the steaks first, then the mushrooms in the same skillet after I removed the meat. The seasonings were subtle and, again, PERFECT. Thank you for the recipe that will play on repeat in my household!

VERY GOOD.I made only two slight changes( if u even want to call it that) I followed the other reviewers directions of frying the steaks first then doing the rest in the pan with the drippings,excellent advice.I also stabbed the steaks with a knife a few times on each side before putting the rub on.was excellent!!!

I’ve made this several times.  I usually use the NY strip, but it comes out great with a good sirloin as well.  I omit the salt in the spice mix for personal preference, and I will usually add about a tablespoon of Herbes de Provence.  If I have time, I’ll season the meat and wrap it in plastic wrap for an hour or ten.

We loved the rub, and would definitely make it again! It was easy and didn't take a ton of extra time. I took some liberties, by adding onions and red, green, and yellow peppers in with the mushrooms, but it still tasted really good. We also grilled the steaks (on aluminum foil, to avoid losing juices) instead of frying. It was still great, and I've already recommended this to friends!

I followed rub recipe ingredients and only changed the cooking method.  I seared steak in a pan on both sides,  then finished in foil in the oven. I sautéed mushrooms in the pan drippings from the steak. Added 2 T heavy cream and 2 T sweet cream butter to make a mushroom sauce. THIS WAS A GREAT RUB. The flavor was probably the best steak I've ever made.

The rub is really only enough for ONE 8 ounce raw steak. I put ALL the rub on ONE steak, wrapped in saran wrap and put in fridge over night.  Cooked it the next evening.  It was the PERFECT amount of rub. I would never have guessed thyme for steak.

It's dead of winter ... too cold to be outside with the grill so I looked for a recipe that worked indoors.  This turned out wonderful!  Next time I might add more butter to get more sauce but it was excellent as is.  My husband's comment:  "Awesome!"  Another keeper in my household.

I made this dish last night for my fiance and I thought he was going to eat the fork it was so good! Rather then using the rub dry, I made it a wet rub by simply adding about 2Tbsp of  vegetable oil and a splash of cold water.  I used fresh rather then dried thyme but only because I ran out of dry.  I made this recipe using steak tips rather than whole steaks, which the wet rub lends itself to better I feel. I tossed the tips in the seasoning mix and let them marinate in the fridge for about 20mins while I prepped the other ingredients. When it came time to cook, I used ONE PAN for everything. Not only does it make for easier clean up, all that goodness from the browned meat that sticks to the bottom of the pan just adds to the overall flavor of the dish . I cooked the tips first, about 2mins per side then removed from pan to let rest. I added 2Tbsp of butter and then my minced garlic and about half of a large sliced onion to the same pan before adding my mushrooms. I didn't have any red wine on hand (currently 30weeks pregnant otherwise there would be several ;) so when it came time to deglaze my pan I simply substituted for a few turns of beef stock and it didnt hurt the flavor one bit! To help thicken my sauce I  made a roux consisting of about 1tsp flour to 1Tbsp water.  Once the mushrooms and onions had a chance to cook down and my sauce thickened I added the tips back to the pan and tossed them in the sauce. I served this with roasted potatoes and steamed broccoli., but

I thought this was really good.  Like others, though, I chose to cook the mushrooms AFTER the steak, using the steak skillet drippings.   Yummy.   I reduced the cooking time because I used very thin steaks and they came out juicy and tender.

This has to be the best seasoning for steak we have ever used!  So easy and family liked  it.  I seasoned the steaks on both sides and let them sit for about an hour.   The mushroom sauce is easy and is basically the one that I have used for years.

Made this for the hubby and he loved it!  I didn't add as much salt as called for because some advised that the rub had too much in it.  Enjoyed the flavor of the  meat when I'm not that big of fan of beef, so that was a big deal for me.  Also, evidently my stove runs a little hotter than most because I almost burnt on side of the steaks. Just be careful of the temp of the skillet.

Thyme Rubbed Steaks with Sauteed Mushrooms Haiku: "Mushrooms the best part. Sad, our steaks were overdone. Needed more sauce 'lube.'" We loved the sauteed mushrooms on top, but following the 5-7 min./side on the steaks resulted in them being too dry/done. Having more of the mushrooms would've provided additional moisture, so if I make this recipe again, I would definitely increase it.

I'm not a huge fan of gaminess (though we eat wild game often) but this was quite good on 4 venison tenderloins.  Will do this again as there was no wild flavor and was quick to prep.  Thanks for sharing!

I liked this rub a lot because it adhered to the steaks nicely. I did not use the salt in the rub, but salted them as they were cooking. I grilled the steaks and used ribeyes...yum!I will definitely use this recipe again

This was awesome!  My husband is the griller, but he travels a lot and I sometimes I want a steak, but don't want to mess with the grill.  This was my answer!  I don't like mushrooms so I didn't do that part, but I did fry up onions to top my steak.  The crust on the steak was perfect!  I don't like anything real spicy and this was perfect.  I didn't have any powdered onion, so I used dried minced onion instead, but the same amount.  I had 3 .5 lb steaks and this made enough for all three with some left over.  I agree with one review, I think making a gravy out of the small pieces left over from frying the steaks would be so good.  I will do that next time.  This will be a repeat recipe - even when my grillmaster returns.

I made this without the sauce since most of my family doesn't like mushrooms, and reduced the garlic in half and quartered the pepper because of family sensitivities, and my family loved it. We'll definitely make this again.

A delicious dry rub!  I used t-bone steaks and the backyard grill instead.  The mushrooms were the perfect touch.  I totally felt as if I was having dinner at some fancy restaurant. (Served with Creamed Spinach II recipe, homemade mashed cauliflower, and store bought mac and cheese.)

This recipe was AWESOME! I'm a beginner at cooking and this was so easy! The red wine REALLY brings out the flavor in the mushrooms -- SO good!! I cooked fresh green beans in a skillet olive oil, minced garlic, and onion peels. I also made mashed potato with chives, butter, and sour cream! I just kinda made the sides up as I went, though I'm sure it's a pretty common way to make both! Thanks for the great meal for my fiance' and I!

My boyfriend made this one Saturday night and I felt like I was eating at a fancy restaurant. The thyme rub added just enough spice to the meat while the sauteed mushrooms were to die for. He used 'baby bella' mushrooms, which I would advise anyone else to do as well.

The spice was wonderful.  The mushrooms werent as "saucie" as we expected.  Will make the steaks again but perhaps skip the mushrooms.
