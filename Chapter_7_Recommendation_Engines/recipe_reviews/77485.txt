After tasting it in my head, I didn't like the idea of cumin, poultry seasoning and thyme.  So I used cumin, chili powder and oregano.  I also added a layer of grated cheddar cheese between and on top of the layers of potatoes.  To keep with the southwest flavors I seemed to be building, I added a can of diced green chiles to the cream of chicken soup.  This was a great budget meal and we liked it quite a bit.  Thanks Jeslynn!

My husband actually said he would rate this 1 1/2 stars, but I was a bit more forgiving.  There is way too much poultry seasoning.  I think I would cut it in half.  I love the basic idea of the recipe though.  Next time I will probably add soem parmesan cheese in the middle and instead of saltine crackers, I will use ritz.  But the cooking time was excellent and I personally thought the overall taste wasn't too bad.

Empty wallet indeed! LOL  I only had ONE potato and one can sliced potatos so that's what I used. Topped with Ritz crackers. Very good for a simple dish. Picky hubby polished it off. Right up his alley.. meat & taters. Thanks

This was great for that day before payday meal. And you really can change it up according to what you have on hand. Las time I made it I had no potatoes and used pasta. It was still tasty . Thanks.

I love this as a "base recipe" - if you use your imagination, and whatever happens to be in the cupboard, the possibilities are endless.  I added a serrano pepper (seeds and all) to the sauteeing onions, along with garlic and more spices.  I only used 1 can of soup but next time I'll use 2.  My family loved it and there was just a small bit leftover (and it made an excellent breakfast!).  Also, be sure to spice up your ground beef as you brown it.

Great recipe!!! Easy to substitute ingredients.  Instead of crackers use cheez-its. It's super yummy and easy clean-up.  (add some melted cheese during browning time!)

I didn't use the mushrooms since my husband doesn't like. Also didn't cook the onions before baking. The poultry seasoning was a bit much & too overpowering. The paprika I would have left off also. Not bad, but not a definite keeper.

I cooked this recipe exactly how it was written. It had a great smell, but I did not like the taste. I did not care for this at all; however my husband tolerated it. The leftovers were still in the fridge 4 days later, which is highly abnormal for this household. I will not be making this again.

This was just about the most flavorful casserole recipe I've made. Everyone wanted seconds. My 2 year old granddaughter kept saying "mmmm good".

My husband and son loved it.  My daughter wouldn't touch it and I didn't like all the cummin taste, too strong.

Both my husband and I ejoyed this casserole very much! We had no poultry seasoning, so I just used a sprinkle each of sage and thyme. Also had to use cumin seeds instead of powder... Even so, with a bit of red chili flakes mixed in, it really hit the spot! Thanks, JESLYNN.

Yum! This was delicious...easy to make, not very expensive since you probably have most of the ingredients on hand, and lots of flavor! I love the crunchy cracker top mixed with the potatoes and everything else! Great recipe!

Tasty and fairly easy. Also as easy on the budget as it says. Made as written. Adding other veggies would be good but be sure to adjust the liquid up a little for fresh veggies.

I wanted to try this mainly because the name gave me a chuckle for today.  It was hard to rate mainly because the submitter said to use whatever is on hand,  thus it changes the results each time; but I think it is a good "basic" to build on.  I did not use cumin or mushrooms;  added a small red bell pepper sliced thin, some leftover carrots, and a small bit of chopped celery that I needed to use up.  Topped with panko instead of the crackers.  This turned out very tasty and there is some leftover for lunch.  Will keep this one handy for those "empty wallet" days and look forward to adding other leftovers.  Thanks for sharing, JESLYNN.

I was struggling to figure out something different to cook using ground beef because I don't usually cook with it. This meal was quick and easy. I altered the recipe as such:
same seasonings as above but added lemon pepper and onion powder to meat
1st layer- potatoes thinly sliced
2nd layer- ground beef 
3rd layer- mixed veggies and cream of celery mix (seasoned with lemon pepper and onion powder)
4th layer- french fried onions
then repeat steps 1-4, baked for 45 mins-1 hr and my son said it is delicious!!! Thanks for the idea.

I gave it 2 stars only because it did give me some ideas.  I made it the first time as listed and it was voted my entire family as strange and not good and please never make this again.  My sons, said yuck.
