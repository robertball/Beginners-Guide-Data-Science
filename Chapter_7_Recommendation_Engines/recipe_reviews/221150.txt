I thought it best to grease the pan first of all, so I used wilton cake release spray.  DId not want to make the icing as these were to sit on the counter at work for 8 hours so I changed the recipe slightly by using mint extract in place of the vanilla.  Topped off with a little green powdered sugar.  Anything mint works a treat for me! I just love both the basic taste and the texture of this brownie, now that I have this recipe I plan on swopping out the extract to make a variety of different flavors.  Planning on trying with orange extract next!

These were good.  I am going to make them again, but I will grease the baking dish.  I thought "ungreased" was odd, but left it that way.  Brownies stuck.  The pieces were good though!  More brownie like than another recipe I tried.

Chocolaty, dense and super moist.  To make sure to get them moist do not bake by time.  Set your timer 5 minutes less than recommended and check with a toothpick or bamboo skewer.  Continue checking every minute or so until there is barely any batter on them. remove for oven immediately.  They will continue to cook a little on the cooling rack.  Meaning if they are perfect or cooked in the oven they will be over cooked when cooled.  In this case not a moist brownie at all.

This recipe made my night!! Just got back from a potluck Christmas dinner at our friends place. After browsing some recipes and tips on making brownies, I decided to make a chewy one instead of another type. I wanted to do my first attempt with a very simple recipe, and I opted this one. Turned out my it was successful. They love it! Some of them wanted to learn how to make it. One of them said that's her first best brownies in town (we live in China)! A compliment and thank to Chef John! :D

I accidentally use 2/3 instead of 3/4 cocoa, but like Chef John said, the quality of cocoa is very important to the result - I use brand Fry's from Canada (thanks to my lovely mom-in-law), don't know if that's the best over there but it works great! Didn't have 8x8" baking pan so I used silicone meatloaf pan, and it cooked well evenly - no uncooked part in the middle. I grease the pan with melted butter and didn't have prob at all when taking the brownies out of the pan. Since I use a small convection oven, I set the heat for 150 Celcius instead of 175, so it wasn't over-burnt, but instead of 35 mins it took 45 mins to cook - until the toothpick comes out clean.

I'll definitely make it again, my husband loves it! It was finished too quick until I didn't even have a chance to take a picture, next time I'll post it here :)

Amazing!!  I did make a few changes, though.  I didn't want to make the frosting, so I put the mint extract directly into the brownie batter instead.  I also added 2/3 cup of chocolate chips.  The recipe says to use an ungreased pan, but I didn't want to risk that they'd stick, so I greased it anyway.  They came out perfectly!

This recipe yields a rich, dense, chocolatey pan of brownies!  I only used 1 cup sugar, and used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder.  I baked them in a half-sheet pan greased with coconut oil for about 20 minutes.  Instead of the mint icing, I sprinkled the top with a chocolate mint baking chip and it was delicious.  This is very similar to a recipe my husband used when he was pastry chef at a restaurant, except these have less sugar, which is to my liking.

AMAZING!! So chocolatey & fudgy. I underbaked mine,and let it cook more in the hot pan. That makes it so I don't overcook my brownies till they're dry and crumbly. The brownies aren't too sweet like I thought it would be. Seriously, even my family thinks it isn't too sweet and they have a tongue that rejects sweetness. The cocoa powder really balances the sugar out. Make sure to use a GOOD quality cocoa powder.

Loved it! I accidentally added less milk so the icing wasn't runny, but I liked it that way because it gave a bit of a hard, crispy texture. I took out the brownie upside-down and put the icing on the bottom rather than on the top,  seemed much easier to spread since the bottom of the brownie was perfectly smooth.

This was great! I used salted butter and melted it the microwave, it worked the same. I did not put the salt in because the butter included salt.

I just made these earlier this afternoon, to moderate success. Taste-excellent, to me. My problem was with turning out the finished brownies. I let them sit for the minimum 10 minutes. I even used cooking spray on the pan (as I personally was concerned about using a completely ungreased baking pan) & set the timer so I didn't get overly anxious. And 3 pieces/chunks later... But the actual brownies did otherwise come out well for me. I think I will attempt them another time, following the recipe as-is & let them cool longer than the 10 minutes before trying to attempt the "flip". Also, I'm curious about trying the mint extract actually IN the brownie batter, as compared to in an icing.

This is now my go to brownie recipe, its easy and really fudgey and good. I tend to mix up the icing flavors every once in a while, instead of mint extract I have used whisky, lemon and most recently a mint flavoured ganache frosting. Extremely versatile and always a hit. Per usual I substitute the butter for canola oil.

I finally found a more fudgy brownie like have been wanting!! I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13in. pan sprayed with baking spray, I added an extra rounded tbs. cocoa and doubled the vanilla because all I had was imitation. Sometimes I add a little coffee extract. Very good...fudgy but not too gooey, which I don't like. Thanks again Chef John!

It works better with the pan greased. I substituted the mint for peppermint, colored it red, and sprinkled crushed candy cane on top.

Simple, fudgey, thick, dense, chocolatey, delectable and delicious!! My new go to for brownies!  I made my icing a little thicker and tinted it green for St.Pattys day, then melted some chocolate and shortening in a double boiler and drizzled on top! Everyone loved them! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!! :)

Satisfied my chocolate craving. =) The only difference was i did grease the dish, and i used 1 cup of sugar instead of worrying about the extra 1/8th.

Made these for the holidays.  Doubled the recipe for a 9x13 and baked 5 minutes longer.  Added mint extract instead of vanilla.  Topped with mint frosting and crushed up candy canes.  Definitely use parchment or foil and grease it.  Lifted out of pan beautifully.  Quick, easy fudgy and delicious.

Loved it! I thought the batter was a little thick, so I put two tablespoons of coconut in with the sugar, butter, and cocoa powder. Ended up with a lovely, very moist brownie. I also put some mint extract in the batter.

Wonderful recipe!  I only had enough vanilla for 1 batch so substituted almond extract since I needed 2 batches.  Just as good with a slight hint of almond.  Made chocolate/peppermint ganache for the original with vanilla.  Fabulous.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks Chef John!!!

Such an easy and delicious recipe.  It was not  Christmas time so we used the Chef John Chocolate frosting to frost the brownies.  All I can say- "Woohoo!"

The texture of these was indeed dense and chewy as promised, but the flavor was lacking depth.  I frosted mine with a fudgy frosting which helped; otherwise they would have been one flat note of cocoa.

Found them tasty enough but fairly dry and crumbly.

This is a nice change from typical brownie recipes. However, I thought there wasn't enough mint taste, so I added a full tablespoon of peppermint extract to the brownie mix and a half cup of crushed candy canes and semi sweet chocolate chips. It came out great. I did not make the icing but I did top it  with finely crushed candy canes. Greasing or not greasing the pan wasn't an issue for me because I used parchment paper in my pan.

Very thin, flaky, and fudgey. Stuck to the pan.  Wanted a lighter, chewier, thicker brownie. Would not make again.
