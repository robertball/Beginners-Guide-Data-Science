This cabbage recipe was fantastic!  The dressing would be great on any type salad, and you could really crunch it up with jullianned carrots, zucchini, and jicama.

This salad is wonderful, but I did not use near the olive oil that was suggested.  I also added dry roasted sunflower kernels which were excellent.  The dressing is also a great marinade for roasting veggies!

My mom calls this Sumi Salad -- and it's great. She uses regular cabbage, but the Napa (or Savoy)is better for soaking up the dressing. We use sliced almonds and RICE VINEGAR. I guess I should just post the whole dang thing.

Great Recipe! I will be making this again. My friend had a similar recipe but hers had carrots and snowpeas in it. I will be adding those next time - I think it will be a nice addition.

I wasn't sure about a recipe with ramen noodles but i'm sure glad i tried. This was great. I did add green onions to salad and garlic to dressing. I also toasted my sesame seeds. I had never used napa cabbage and really liked it. Thanks

This is a terrific salad. I didn't make this version, but I can tell you what I do a bit different with mine. Instead of canola oil, cook the noodles, seeds, and almonds in 1/4 C. salted butter. When browned, pour out onto a paper towel to cool. I also add chopped green chives. You can also use pecans instead of almonds. Love this salad!

Wow this salad is so good.  Every time I make it for a party or a potluck, someone asks me for the recipe (which is how I actually got it too).  If you are crunched for time, and/or want to cut some of the fat, it turns out equally good if you don't fry up the noodles, seeds and nuts.  You can toast them or even just leave them plain.  Crush the ramen noodles before you open the package - super easy and a good way to squeeze out your frustrations!!

Ate a wonderful version of this at a BSF fellowship luncheon yesterday and all the ladies raved and begged for the recipe! I didn't want to wait until next week and found this one on allricpes. She served the cabbage, crunchies and dressing seperately. The crunchies she used was ramen noodles, sliced almonds, salted sunflower seeds and sasame seeds. The dressing was also similiar except she said she added the seasoning packet from the asian ramen noodles. I made this at home tonight and it was great! (Didn't bake crunchies in oven-didn't need it).

Made this for a dinner with some friends.  We all really liked it.  The things I changed were:   I added less sugar, more soy sauce and more white wine vinegar.  I thought all that sugar made the dressing a little too sweet.  Also added shredded carrots, green onions and sunflower seeds.

Fabulous salad.  I used granulated Splenda in place of sugar and added some roasted salted sunflower seeds.  But the biggie:  My son got out the sriracha hot chili sauce to put on top of his.  He raved about how good it was, so I did the same.  That put it over the top.  A perfect addition for those who like spicy.  I would suggest adding 2-3 T of this to the dressing.  You will love it.

I think the recipe is missing infomration. The recipe includes sauting the noodles, sesame seeds and almonds before mixing them with the cabbage. Without that step the recipe isn't good.

I have a similar salad I make. I don't use soy, balsamic vinegar, canola oil or white vinegar. I use Apple cider vinegar and some veg. oil, and you have to add croutons.. the round ones if you can find them. They soak up the vinegar.. oh my yummy! I love this salad. I sometimes can eat a whole batch to myself!

Very good, but can be made much healthier than as written. I toasted the almonds & ramen noodles without any oil, and they turned out just fine. Also cut down on the amount of sugar & oil in the dressing, and added julliened red peppers and chopped green onions to the napa cabbage. I keep everything separate until serving, since the cabbage gets soggy pretty quickly. Keeping everything separate also improves the quality of leftovers, and this recipe makes quite a lot, so unless you're taking it to a party, you may be eating it for several days.

This was quite good, except perhaps the dressing was perhaps a little too sweet. Other than that, no problems! Added extra veggies as per another reviewer (shredded jicama and carrot) and there was nothing left in the bowl afterwards!

I like to marinate chicken in some of the dressing, grill it and chop it up and add to the salad. 
This is one of my favorite salads!  :-)

Used a bagged cole slaw mix and left out the almonds that i didnt have on hand.  Added half of the ramen flavor pack to the sauce mix and it turned out great.  Very quick and simple.  Used a little less sugar and oils than called for and was still plenty.

The dish itself is great - but it's easier to just use coleslaw dressing (even lite is really good) instead of the vinegar/sugar mix. Saves a step for the cook on the go! Just chop the salad, toast the crunchies and pour on about half a jar of coleslaw dressing when you mix it together.

Salads like this have always been a favorite of mine.  But I was "afraid" to mix the amount of olive oil into the cabbage that the recipe called for because I thought it would make the entire salad too oily.  So instead, I toasted the ramen noodles, almonds, and sesame seeds in a skillet before combining with the cabbage and the dressing.  Also saved some of the ramen noodles for a garnish on top and added some leftover chicken for a complete, quick meal.

I've made this twice now and I think I made a good mistake the first time.....I cooked the noodles, nuts and seeds in a dry pan (no oil added). For my second time I added oil to the pan (about half what the recipe calls for) and found the noodles etc were way too oily.
The dressing is delicious as is!

I used savoy cabbage, half a head...didn't realize it would shrink so much; used all olive oil, no canola; I used Swerve and honey for sweetener; I did not use the noodles, used peanuts instead of almonds; I didn't use measuring spoons cuz I'm adventurous like that ha ha...sooo it was too vinegary and because of that I added some avocado mayo which made it the bomb!!! Also used some spices, salt pepper garlic onion cayenne. So so good, def in my favorites:)

02.05.17 ~ Made this salad for one of the MANY items we had at our Super Bowl party.  It was very good and well received.  Next time I'm going to add a little shaved carrot for color.   Once I made the original recipe, I split it in to two bowls and added green onions to one of the bowls.  I preferred the bowl with the onions, although both were delicious.

This is pretty much the same as an old recipe I used for years (that I misplaced).  I added about 1/2 cup chopped green onions and some shredded chicken.  Very good the next day.

I recommended cutting down on the sugar,   I used a small head of napa cabbage, great flavors but a bit too sweet.

We have tried various versions of this type salad and loved them all but this seems to have way too much oil. 1 and 1/2 total when almost none is needed. Dry roast the crunchies in nonstick pan and cut back on the sugar and add dressing as needed if your head of napa is not very large. I did a side of grilled chicken strips which added to the meal.

Great party dish that could easily handle some chicken slices.    Gets mushy if you try to keep it too long after tossing.

This was a good base recipe , tho the amount is way too much for 2 people. I had to cut it down and tweaked it with some seasoning and a bit of Sarachi sauce and the it became very scrumptious! Thanks
