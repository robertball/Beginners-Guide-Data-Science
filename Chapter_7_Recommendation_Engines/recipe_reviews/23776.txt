This was my first attempt at a Custard Pie.  My husbands mother used to make it and they called it "graham cracker pie".  It turned out pretty good, made the first one as a tester for hubby to try and then made the official one a few days later as a special treat for my brother-in-law.  He loved it and said the meringue was better than his Mom made - quite a compliment.

I added a tsp. of vanilla and a tsp. of margarine to the second pie and it made the custard so much tastier.  Used a store bought graham cracker crust and pre-baked it.  Let the custard cool for 15 mins before filling pie crust.

Still had some 'seepage', a watery substance that I guess is normal for custard pies - anyone know what it is or what causes it?

I've been looking for this pie for years!  A real kid favorite, however, I have cut the crust recipe in half, but that's our own family's taste.  This is fabulous thank you!!

Flapper Pie was a favorite with my family as a child and my kids love it, too. This recipe is very close to mine but try adding 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the pie crust, and 1 tsp. of vanilla to the custard.

This recipe is okay, I liked it, but Flapper Pie I, (on this site)is 100 times better!  I think it may be the difference in the crusts

Holy cow, this was delicious! I used this recipe over the other flapper pie recipe on this site because it uses exactly 3 whites and 3 yolks, instead of only 2 yolks. Immediately after baking, the custard part tasted a bit eggy and I regretted the extra yolk, but by the next day it had set better and was wonderful. I used a store-bought pie-crust because another reviewer complained about the crust listed here.
