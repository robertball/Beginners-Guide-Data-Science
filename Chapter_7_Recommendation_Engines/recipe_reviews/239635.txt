I loved this soup! So easy to make and the flavors are all spot on. I used spinach instead of kale and then I realized that I had forgotten to cook the bacon. By this time everyone was already sitting at the table and eating. I can just imagine how much more flavorful this soup is with the bacon. Oh well, just an excuse to make it again and real soon.

Amazing! My husband said it was even better than at the restaurant. I followed the recipe to a T the first time I made it. I would suggest cooking the sausage & bacon in a separate pan, then getting a new pot to cook your onions & garlic in and continuing with the recipe from there. I get that using all the same pot adds to the flavor but it coated everything in a layer of orangey-brown grease and the soup just smelled like grease to me. Next time around I used a fresh pot for the stock and just added in the cooked meat and it was much better. The red pepper flakes can be a bit overbearing together with the mild sausage so next time I'd probably cut it down a bit on those. All in all it was delicious, thank you! Would make again.

Fabulous! Made on stove & took in crockpot to a friends home for a cider squeeze,  nothing better on a lightly cool early fall evening than sitting in the orchard with this soup, crusty french bread and fresh cider watching the new calves play. 
We tend to do half a pound each of mild and medium Italian sausage, but mild is wonderful especially for people who don't want spicy foods

I make this with turkey Italian sausage and turkey bacon bits. I also use a cup of skim milk in place of the whipping cream. It is wonderful!

ADDICTED!!! My hubby says it's better than Olive Garden. I did make a couple changes based on what I had at home and budget. I used spicy Italian sausage! And left out the pepper flakes. Because of time (and I had small potatos on hand) I cut the potatoes into cubes. I didn't have heavy whipping cream is I boiled milk and added a little flour to thicken it up and then added it to the soup. AMAZINGNESS!!! Will be making this one all winter!

My boyfriend and I loved this soup. Note - you should like spice. The 1-1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper adds quite a bite but we love that. He thought it got spicier the longer it sat in the fridge but I thought the spice weakened. Definitely take the time to drain the sausage otherwise you'll end up with an icky layer of grease on top that will coagulate in the fridge. The end result? Undoubtedly similar yet BETTER than Olive Garden's version. Definitely used the kale in place of the spinach and it stayed pretty firm. Bonus for the kale, bake up the remainder to make kale chips. Yum!

I made a few modifications in the recipe  I used chicken sausage and added vegtable oil since the chicken did not have much fat. Also instead of  whipping cream I used half and half.  The soup was wonderfull and I will definately make it again.

Very tasty! I of course made a few personal modifications including: peppered bacon, 1/2 spinach-1/2 kale, Italian seasoning, mushroom, a small dab of butter, & about 1/2 of the heavy cream. The soup is a little too watery for my liking, so my next batch I will be adding some parmesan cheese to thicken it up a bit. Overall verdict=Yum!

This was absolutely delicious! Made it according to the recipe with my own homemade Italian sausage. I used russet potatoes sliced thin and left skin on. Tasted before serving and added 1/2 tsp. salt. Leftovers keep well for a few days in the refrigerator but I don't think it would freeze well. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This is a great recipe! Will definitely use this one each time. If you have a little trouble with the "red pepper" spice. I used a little less, however the spicy heat doesn't bother me, but I just like a little less.

I have made this several times and it always turns out great! The only thing I change is using spicy sausage instead of mild. This household loves us some spicy heat!

I made this for my family on a cold day.  It's a lot of soup.  I used frozen kale.  It seemed like a little too much kale.  It was still tastey.  I thought I would freeze some, but I gave some away and we managed to finish it in a couple days.

LOVE this soup! I used cauliflower chunks instead of potatoes (low carb); I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I sprinkled in Montreal Steak seasoning; I also used spinach instead of kale and added some finely diced carrots for color.  This is my new favorite soup and I will be making it again!

I WILL make this again!  It is one of my favorite soups from that famous chain!  I used hot sausage and by-passed the pepper flakes.  My husband NEVER likes kale, but he loved this!  I wish I still had some, but its all gone!

Went exactly by the recipe and was great. The second time, I used it as one of my special soups at a  catered event for a large company Christmas party. Everyone raved about it. Recently, I followed the recipe but  sautéed the cooked Italian sausage, cooked bacon, minced garlic, chopped onion and pepper flakes then added to the chicken broth. Brought it all to a boil then added the potatoes and cooked on medium high until the potatoes were done. I turned off the stove top and added the kale and heavy whipping cream, and covered the pot. I let rest for 10 minutes before serving. By doing this, the kale remained fresh and crispy but thoroughly cooked. AWESOME! Much better than the restaurant!

This recipe is so freaking delicious! I’d give it 10 stars if I could. I omitted the bacon, because my girlfriend isn’t a fan, but it’s still delicious without it. I did increase the garlic by a few cloves (6 cloves total), because garlic is life.

Made this for a Friday evening meal on a chilly evening. However, instead of stovetop I used the crockpot and cooked on High for 3hrs adding everything except the cream and Kale. After 3hrs, I added the (cream and Kale) and cooked another 30/40 mins or so until Kale was to a consistency we liked. This was so amazing and tasted just as good as the restaurant chain that serves it!! We followed the ingredients to a T and changed nothing. It was SPICY and excellent!! I chose hot sausage instead of regular or mild to give it a bit more kick since my family likes spice. Lastly since I was in a hurry I purchased frozen precut potato pieces and frozen precut onions to use instead of cutting my own. Definitely will be making this again!!

I make this several times a year, my family loves this soup and considers it the top 1-4 of my soups depending on who you ask. It is also one of the very few recipes that I somewhat follow, I tend to cook by smell and often change the recipe as i go. For this soup the only major change i make is using kale instead of spinach. I use half and half for my cream and always add the kale at the very end of the cooking process to keep its texture. the absolute best way to serve this soup is to cook it the day before and reheat, like almost all soups the flavors truly come out on the following day. If i am serving next day, i will hold the kale and then add it after the soup is hot again.

I've been making this soup for several years with a couple minor modifications. I use hot Italian sausage and cut out the red pepper flakes. I also use packaged bacon pieces as it cuts down on the greasiness.

Great flavor! We used purple kale, which stayed "al dente" -- which is fine with us, but others might want to cook it longer to make it softer. We also added more bacon because we love bacon in general.

This was so easy to make,and delicious. I did make some adjustments. First I omitted the bacon,Italian Sausage is full of flavor on it"s own.Instead of heavy cream, I used Coconut Milk.The family finished the pot in no time at all!

This was very good, but a little blander than what I'm use to.  Had to add extra pepper flakes, and I also added some onion and garlic powder and salt.  I don't remember having bacon in my Zuppa at Olive Garden either, but it was good.  I've had another one off this site that I think taste more like the one at Olive Garden.

We did use this recipe but changed it up for lighter calorie option with half and half low fat and low sodium broth/stock.  Also used Andouille sausage for the spicy flavor and kielbasa. Allowing red pepper flakes per individual taste by the bowl.

I made this recipe last night.... WOW!!!! really really good!!! the only change I made was that I used turkey bacon instead, it was just as the OG restaurant but cheaper ;)
