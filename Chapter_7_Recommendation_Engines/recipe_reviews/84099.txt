these came out tasting JUST like egg rolls you get from a chinese restaurant! i added a little imitation crab, but other than that followed the recipe. i also didnt fry at the end, i brushed with olive oil and broiled them for about 5 min and they got crispy on both sides. didnt feel like the mess of frying. they were still great!

Amazing, though I think it was lacking in something.  Next time I think I'll add some oyster sauce or something like that.

These were not bad, but we did not prefer the taste of the shrimp; it seemed to overpower the entire roll.  I'll probably try this again sometime using chicken.

Another recipe that deserves more than the five stars allowed!!  This was my first time making egg rolls (even after 30-plus years of cooking, the concept always seemed too intimidating to try), and they turned out to be the most fantastic egg rolls my husband and I have ever had.  I did eliminate the bean sprouts...only because I did not have any in the house...and I steamed and chopped fresh shrimp instead of using canned. I also subbed dried red-pepper flakes for the black pepper, and these came out tasting better than my now "OLD-favorite" egg rolls at my favorite Thai restaurant.  These proved so much easier to make than I ever could have imagined.  I found that I did not need the cornstarch mixture to seal the wrappers; I used the moisture from the bottom of the bowl that the filling had been sitting in.  I had absolutely no issues with the wraps coming apart, and didn't need to use any toothpicks.  This is a fantastic recipe!!  I would urge anyone who loves egg rolls to try this recipe; you will be shocked at how easy they are to make.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe Rouver, I will be using it often!

Easy and Delicious! The only thing I added was some grated fresh ginger just because I happened to have some! I did use the coleslaw mix just because its so much easier...saves so much time! I froze half of them uncooked so I will report back when I cook them! Thanks for the recipe!

I omitted the bean sprouts, celery and shrimp and made mine with two cooked and chopped up chicken breasts (could probably even use more chicken)

I also added 2 Tablespoons chopped fresh ginger root, an extra carrot, extra soy sauce to taste and dropped a few drops of sesame oil to the vegetable oil for extra flavor.

In all these are the best egg rolls I've ever had, I am thinking adding the ginger helped the flavor a lot. Next time I will try baking them  just to be healthier.

Wonderful! Thank you
Crystal

My family and friends LOVE this! I have to double the recipe every time because we eat soooo much. We can't do seafood due to allergies so I substitute diced browned pork loin. I also like to bake these and then fry, it helps with leftovers to be a bit crunchy the next day.

This recipe was pretty easy. I would defintley add more soy sauce to the mixture and try it with shredded chicken instead of shrimp. I made Seasame beef and Sweet and Sour sauce II. Perfect meal. Will make again.

Excellant. Mine made 23 eggrolls. Fried to pale brown for the ones I was freezing so they can be baked to golden and hot at a later time. The ones we ate were soooo good. Next time I will use peanut oil for a little more flavor but this is a 5 star and easy.. Thank you.

What a hit! I leave out the shrimp (vegetarian) and add tablespoon of Teriyaki sauce and a splash of sesame oil. I use the coleslaw mix that has carrots included and so omit the carrots and just use extra slaw mix. I leave out the bean sprouts and add more onion. I've added mushrooms before and a whole egg, rather than half. My opinion is that you can use any ingredients you want with this recipe and it won't fail.

EXCELLENT!  This was my first time making egg rolls.  I used packaged coleslaw mix for the cabbage and carrots and a can of bean sprouts.  It made 18 egg rolls, which a portion of them I froze.  They were "Oh so good"!  The egg rolls went perfectly with the Homemade Wonton Soup recipe from this site.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  Thank you ROUVER for sharing!

To make this better add rice noodles, asian straw mushrooms, fresh ginger, garlic, five-spice,sauce, and seasame seed oil. Also it is better to use Chinese cabbage (Napa cabbage)..Lastly you do not need a egg or even cornstarch..satuee the veggies except cabbage (this will make it lose it's crisp) with garlic, ginger, seasme seed oil, spice and fish sauce.. One more thing i also use 1lb of beef or pork in addition to the shrimp..And when i cook my ground beef i add a beef bouillion and season it while its cooking infuse it's taste.

I haven't been able to have egg rolls for 6 years due to a gluten (wheat) intolerance. I made these last night as a treat to myself. I used rice papers instead of egg roll wrappers and I baked them instead of frying them. They tasted almost exactly like the real thing. YAY!!! Thanks so much for the awesome recipe.

These are super delicious! I have tried other egg roll recipes before; but this one takes the cake. I did bake them at a high heat (instead of deep frying them) and they still came out wonderful! Thanks for a good recipe! : )

A keeper! I used pork instead of shrimp, and fried the egg rolls in a vegetable oil and peanut oil mixture. I omitted the fried egg portion of the recipe, which didn't seem to cause any harm. They turned out delicious - my whole family loved them! Great recipe!!

These were good.  Definitely a good place to start and tweak the recipe to your own tastes.  I used leftover cooked/shredded chicken instead of the shrimp and added a half teaspoon of ground ginger.  Fried up a few to start, and enjoyed them.  My husband and I tried numerous dips to jazz them up a bit.  Finally I ended up making a sweet and sour sauce from my trusty ole BC cookbook, and voila!  We discovered the perfect little something that we were missing.  I ended up mixing the sauce in with the other half of the filling and finished frying.  They were awesome!  I will make these again for sure, with my sweet and sour sauce.  Would be awesome for game night!

Yum, yum, and yum!  I had to leave out the celery due to the husband's tastes, and I used fresh shrimp that I sauteed myself instead of the canned that the recipe calls for.  Finally, I just baked mine for 25 minutes or so and had awesome egg rolls that were better AND healthier than take-out.  Dipped in some spicy mustard and I quickly forgot all about that restaurant up the street.  Already made this twice and will make again! (Also, they're good reheated, an unexpected plus!)

These are so good!!  I have an allergy to sesame oil and seeds, so I really cannot eat any Aisian/Oriental foods in restaurants.  it is so nice to find a great recipe that I can make, that tastes good, and that I know what the ingredients are!

I made these today, I changed the recipe a bit: I used pork seasoned with pepper, garlic, salt, and onions. I also added twice as much soy sauce, and used no cornstarch. They were AMAZING to say the least! Just as good if not better than take out!

This is a great recipe! It is almost just like the recipe my mother has used for years. I left out the bean sprouts and added in sesame oil and oyster sauce. I used frozen shrimp instead of canned shrimp and I cooked the vegetables down before adding in my spices. Turned out great!

I made these egg rolls with my daughter and we both thought they were fantastic. We live in England and  decided to use what we call pak choi instead of ordinary cabbage, but that was the only thing we changed. If we were to change anything about the recipe, we would probably not put as much filling in each roll, but that's it. I will be be making these again.

I have made these so many times and every time they are better than the last time. I put all the veggies (separately) into the food processor for a whirl and i had these eggrolls ready in about 15 minutes!  I left the meat (shrimp) out for my vegetarian son and he always LOVES this meal..  The trick that makes these so good is that the filling is not cooked like eggrolls I've made in the past. I put any veggie i have in the fridge in the mix. broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cilantro, celery. we dipped in teriyaki sauce, black bean/garlic sauce, the 'rooster' sauce and soy sauce. I think my son ate 10 or so!!!!

These are a holiday tradition at our house.  To make the recipe easier, I use a bag of cole slaw that can be found in the refrigerated produce section by the bags of salad.  I also add finely chop bamboo shoots and water chestnuts.  Don't forget the hot Chinese mustard.

As other reviews suggested I added oyster sauce. These were ok..but my family thought they were 'bland' and missing something. I'm must not sure what it is that is missing.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe! Adding some ginger to the filling is the only change I made and they fried up great. I have been learning a lot of chinese dishes because we can't ever find a good restaurant anymore and this is a keeper. Thanks!

I didn't enjoy these at all.  They are a mess to make! When the oil finds its way inside the roll there is a geyser in your fryer! I think eggroll making is best done at my favorite Chinese restaurant, and it's worth the $1.10 to purchase! I give this ** - 1 because it looked like an eggroll 1 because the hubby ate them!

I have made this twice, the first time I added a bit of shredded cooked chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe.  We didn't care for the "gummy-ness" of the cornstarch.  Having made egg rolls many times over the years, the second time I also added the chicken, but also added some Asian Five Spice powder 1/4 tsp or so.  Quickly sauted the filling until slightly wilted and the cornstarch became more incorporated.  Then allowed filling to cool and proceeded.  We like the results much better and the Five Spice gives it a very authentic flavor.

This is such a good recipe. I baked mine at 400 for 25 minutes (mine came out floury tasting because I neglected to see the wrappers needed to be brushed with oil before baking... hey this was my first time making anything like this!). I  also used the coleslaw with carrots, and substituted chicken for shrimp.  The filling tastes just like my favorite Chinese food place! My whole family loved these.

YUM! i gave only 4 because of the very minor changes. i used 1Tbsp. soy and 1Tbsp. oyster sauce. I used beaten egg to seal the wrappers. i omitted the shrimp. i used 4 cups of shredded cole slaw mix (cabbage and carrots). did not have celery on hand. w/ these changes, it made 9 decent sized egg rolls. Love them. definitely a keeper!

I love these egg rolls. I've made several variations from this recipe, from the shrimp it calls for to pork to chicken to just veggie rolls. This is my go-to recipe to start and build from every time. I highly recommend this recipe. My family loves them! And they freeze well.

These egg rolls were AWESOME!  Easy to make and very tasty.  I added bamboo shoots, mushrooms and bean sprouts as well as a tsp of Thai Chili paste.  I blanched my veggies for 1 min. next time i will try raw as the recipe states to compare.  I liked the cooked veggies diane in NJ

These are way good!  I've made it exactly according to the recipe, and it was good, except for the shrimp.  We've since substituted chicken or pork and prefer it that way.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used a bag of coleslaw mix, and also used a couple of cans of pre-cooked chicken breast.  What a time saver.  It takes this recipe from something I would only make on weekends to one that could be done during the week.  This last time I made it, I added a little sesame oil to the filling for flavor.  This has now become a staple recipe in our house.  No more frozen egg rolls from the store.  Thanks for submitting it!

These were my first attempt at eggrolls and they were awesome! I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting firm tofu for the shrimp. I also baked the rolls instead as other reviewers had suggested and used the broiler in the last couple minutes and they turned out super crispy you would never know they weren't fried. I would recomment sealing the edges completely instead of just the corners if you are going to fry because i didn't have a tight seal.

I'm amazed at how easy these were to make.  I don't like shrimp, so I substituted 4 oz of cooked ground chicken.  We fried them and ate them with duck sauce, and they were great.  I tried baking some, too-- I don't recommend it as the wrapper just became tough and chewy.  I didn't cook all of the egg rolls right away so i put them in the fridge to make the next day, and the wrappers became soggy and gooey.  I recommend cooking all the egg rolls at once and then refrigerate and reheat the leftovers.

I've never made egg rolls...in fact, I think this was my first time frying anything.  They are so good.  Just make sure you have mouths to eat them.  It was just me and my husband and we overate...talk about a gut bomb.  Maybe we aren't used to so much fried food.  They are so good though.  I served them with sweet and sour sauce and froze half the batch.  I wish I'd tried brushing w/ olive oil and baking because that sounds like it might work out.  These really are WAY better than any egg roll I've had a restaurant.

These egg rolls were fantastic and surprisingly easy to make!  Used coleslaw mix with carrots.  Brushed with olive oil and broiled on low until they were golden.

This was a wondeful guide for me in making Egg Rolls for my first time. Alas, I did not follow the recipe exactly. I made a few adjustments.

-Instead of cutting cabbage and carrots, I used 1 and a half bags of coleslaw. This worked well, and cut my preperation time in half.
-I did not use celery, but used scallions. 
-I used canned chicken instead of baby shrimp, and it turned out well. 
-And instead of soy sauce, I used Terryiakki Sauce which took care of the garlic, and gave it a ginger taste.

So all in all, I basically created my own spin on this recipe...yet I used it as a guide. They turned out amazing, better than at a Chinese Take Out place! I recommend them to anyone!

I skipped the onion, celery, and shrimp, but added fresh ginger like was recommended. I also used a bag of pre-shredded cabbage and carrots (like what's used for coleslaw) which made this an easy recipe. It worked great and they were delicious. I will definitely make them again for my family.

We tried this recipe and it was very very good. Even the kids loved it. I made extras and froze some to have later, would rather have this then store bought.

We actually made these today, and they were delicious.  We changed it up just a little.  We used the bag of coleslaw mix with carrots which was just the right amount.  Only used one tablespoon of soy sauce but added one tablespoon of hoisin sauce for flavor.  We skipped the shrimp and added chicken and fake crab.

I used the coleslaw (shredded cabbage/carrot )mixture in a bag to save time. Also diced some onion and added some cut up pregrilled chicken strips and a few sprinkles of Simply Asia Sweet Ginger Garlic seasoning.  I don't use soy because of the high sodium so I always sub coconut aminos.  These came out great-my husband was a huge fan!

FABULOUS! was told by multiple people that these were the best spring rolls they ever tried (and I have some tough critics!) Made multiple times now. I do find an egg wash works better than the cornstarch when folding them up. I also added fresh minced garlic

This were just okay.  I think having no shrimp/meat in them (we made ours vegetarian) was a problem, though.  We did use mushrooms to substitute, but it was not enough.

This is a nice recipe, did'nt have egg roll wrappers so I used spring roll wrappers and it worked out just fine. Added just a little fish sauce to give it an extra kick, and some fresh ginger.

The egg destroyed the flavor and texture. I added turmeric and 5 spice powder.  I also sauteed cabbage mixture until just starting to wilt so it wouldn't poke through wrapper AND there wouldn't be large air pockets when cabbage wilted.  Recipe on back of wrapper much better

This was my first time trying to make egg rolls and I have to say this is a good one. Very easy to make I did take the advice of other reviews and used coleslaw mix. I wouldn't recommend frying them it hold to much grease, so I'll bake the next time but this is a keeper

joined a CSA, so I'm on the look-out for new ways to use my veggies... I was generally OVER cabbage, so stoked on doing some egg rolls.  These were awesome and not too difficult to make. I didn't really change anything other than my egg roll wrappers didn't need cornstarch/egg to stay together. The only difficult part was getting the frying perfect, but it doesn't really matter--they taste good!

Makes a lot!  I broiled, not fried them and had to freeze most of them.  Hopefully they'll bake up nice again.  Yummy!

this recipe is similar to my moms recipe.  we use coleslaw mix as well to cut on time and nix the shrimp and use 1 tube pork sausage.  we toss every thing into a wok stir occasionaly and roll away.  we tend to make a HUGE batch and have an egg rolling party with the family.  there never seems to be enough so i suggest making a few batches and freezing them.

Great eggroll recipe. I made it using a bag of coleslaw mix and also baked the eggrolls instead of deep frying them. This works great with chicken or pork as well.

This was great- but I cheated a bit.  I used a bag of slaw and instead of shrimp browned some ground pork.  I baked these in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes and brushed them with an egg wash.  They turned out crispy brown and very tasty!  I served them with La Choy Sweet and Sour sauce, but next time will make my own sauce.

We loved these egg rolls, and were even able to make them "veggie" by just eliminating the shrimp.  Didn't miss it at all, still a great flavor.  The extras freeze well, and can be reheated nicely in a toaster oven for a quick lunch.

I followed this recipe but used chopped mushrooms too and omitted the shrimp (personal preference). They were great!! We baked them at 425 for about 13 minutes instead of frying and they were great so I can't even imagine what they would've tasted like if they were fried (DRool!) Thanks for sharing!!

These were the most authentic tasting egg rolls I have had in a long time.  I made it for my moms b-day and all 20 were gone within minutes, and there was only 5 of us!  I used fresh shrimp and chopped it up along with ground pork.  I like lots of meat in my egg rolls so it was perfect.  Thanks for the best egg roll recipe!

This was a great start.  I used cole slaw mix for my carrots and cabbage.  I skipped the celery.  I used raw salad shrimp and a pound of ground pork instead of canned shrimp after browning the pork right before it was done I threw in the shrimp to get pink.  I also seasoned the meat with soy sauce while it browned.  Then I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe.  oh I did use more soy sauce to wetten everything, I think I might have sprinkled to much corn starch over it but all turned out great.  :)   I served them with my shrimp fried rice and some store bought kimchee.

Excellent!  They tasted wonderful.  There are some pre-made egg rolls that I always buy at Walmart in the deli department.  These were as good as those.  I made with chicken instead of the shrimp.  I also used extra onion powder for flavor.  I left out the bean sprouts.  I will definitely make them again.

These were very good. I left out the shrimp and just did the veggies. I also just sealed them with water.  Will be using this recipe again.

These are just as the name says, Awesome!.. I used BBQ pork I bought in the deli and added a T of sesame seeds. Didn't have any bean sprouts.  I used egg wash instead of the corn starch mixture to hold them together, putting some on each side as well as the end..  Worked great!

These were fantastic! I bought a bag of already shredded cabbage and put some shredded carrots in even though they are already in the cabbage mix. I had Phyllo dough on hand so I used that instead of the egg roll wrappers. If I used two pieces of phyllo, they stayed together and came out fantastic! I will definitely make this again...actually, New Year's! Thanks
OH, and I baked mine at 375 for about 15-20 minutes!

I looked at many recipes before choosing this one, who in my opinion is one of the most accurate to the traditional egg rolls I've tried before.
These are delicious!

Used canned chicken, because that's what we had on hand. Rolled and fried the first 3 rolls, tasted them and decided to add cayenne pepper for an added kick.

Well..these were amazing! I omitted the celery, but added kelp noodles (those clear noodles you sometimes find in egg rolls. I used chicken instead of shrimp as well. I took the advice of another user, and added some ground ginger (just a light dusting) and sesame oil. I Baked mine for a healthier alternative, but next time I think I will brush with olive oil and Broil instead. the only bad thing about them is that the wrapping tasted off kilter being baked, not fried. I think broiling them will do the trick. all and all- a great recipe! ;p

These were so good!  I made them as listed except I couldn't find canned shrimp here, but they did have canned crab so I used that.  I couldn't taste it though so I think they'd be great vegetarian too.  The taste was fantstic!  However, I've never fried anything before, and I can't read the bottles here, so whichever kind of oil I happened to get had a strong taste.  Choose oil wisely!  Oh, and the soy sauce sunk to the bottom of my bowl, so the last one I made was more wet and the the wrapper fell apart in the oil.  Be careful of too much sauce.

Very good, if you like them well seasoned I would add a little more of each seasoning. I used ground pork instead of shrimp ...canned shrimp are a little to fishy for my taste but with the ground pork they were awesome. my husband was in awwe and at as many as he could. It made 18 egg rolls so we froze some for later!

I shredded the cabbage, julienned the carrots and 2 scallions. Cooked the ground pork in sesame oil. When the pork was cooked, I added the shredded cabbage & carrots and soy sauce and ginger. I added a teaspoon more of soy sauce (to taste). Filling was perfect!  When I made egg rolls years ago, I added a teaspoon or so of peanut butter, the these didn’t need it. Back then I used to steam the cabbage to soften it first, but by shredding the cabbage extremely fine and adding it to the ground pork no need to steam it. Came out excellent. I’m waiting now for the filling to cool so I can roll the wrappers. I left out the garlic because I have a sensitivity to garlic.

I also use every pre sliced broccoli, cabbage, carrot mix and then added to green onions and the celery. Rather than just soy we used 2 Tb of hoisin sauce and a slash of soy sauce.

they were amazing but with a few changes. since cabbage and bean sprouts shrink when cooked. i actually cooked those first along with the eggs.  the carrot and shrimp went in the wrap raw. i used fresh raw shrimp, not canned and added sesame oil and dried ginger. My first review of food ive made because im just so proud of myself. better than at chinese restaurants.

I tried four times to make it, and each time it was just inedible. I tried fresh cabbage, I tried cole slaw mix, I tried frying it, I tried baking it, and every time it just wasn't good.

I made this last night for my husband and myself.  I used Napa cabbage instead of regular cabbage and I cooked whole shrimp fresh then chopped up and added to mix instead of canned.  It was amazing, my husband said it was better than when we order Chinese.  I will be saving this recipe to use again and again, going to change out shrimp for chicken next time and see what that turns out like.  Makes a good number of egg rolls as well so if only cooking for 2-4 people no need to double up on anything.

These are very good. I added a tbl of fresh ginger. I fried some and baked some at 400 for 30 minutes and I didn't like the baked ones at all. I had the wrappers sitting out while I prepared everything and some dried up. Next time I will keep in the refrigerator. If you have never made egg rolls, do yourself a favor and watch a few quick You Tube videos on wrapping.

I used a slaw mix with carrots so I didn't add more carrot.  Omitted the onion and fried egg.  I had cooked shrimp 60-70/# and used 15-17 minced for the canned shrimp. We got 15 egg rolls (to match the number of wrappers in the pkg.) Delicious!  Will make again!

This recipe was fantastic and super easy. I didn't use shrimp or bean sprouts though, and instead of shrimp I cooked some sausage. I also added about 1/8 t. ginger, used about 2X the amount of onion, and added a dash of Teriyaki sauce. YUMMY!!

Was good. I didn't follow the recipe as it was written. I used a bag of cole slaw mix & shredded some baby carrots I had on hand. Didn't use the sprouts or celery. Instead of shrimp I cooked some small pork chops on my George foreman, chopped them up & put those in the mixture. I didn't have fresh ginger but I did use some dry ginger- that added so much to the flavor. I modified the recipe to four servings for 3 people and after cooking 5 egg rolls I still have 5 left to cook!

This was a great recipe to build confidence to try making egg rolls for the first time. The whole family enjoyed them. We are going to try some variances for our own tastes but this was a great starting point.

my sweet little moonkid wanted eggrolls and this was the recipe she picked. I helped along the way to show her how easy it was to put things together from start to finish.  The recipe is very versatile. We normally don't carry can shrimp on hand (because of personal preferences) so used ground chicken and made sure IT was well seasoned and cooked prior to mixing all the ingredients together and we used 2 bags of cabbage/carrot mix to equal the amount of cabbage, carrot and celery written in this recipe. From start to finish rather easy. The wetness to the recipe was very good. As you do NOT want overly wet filling in an eggroll recipe, will make your wrappers extremely weak and will cause the wrappers tear and burst in the frying process. As someone that has made lumpia and eggrolls most of my life, this is a simple recipe for those beginners wanting to make them on their own.

I slowly heated 1/2 canola and 1/2 sesame oils then followed the directions and added a few things (sweet pepper and ginger for example) and also used the pre-packaged shredded broccoli slaw and cole slaw mixes.  PERFECT!!  Thanks :)

This was good.  I did substitute the cabbage and carrots with prepackaged green cabbage and carrots for coleslaw.  That was perfect also.  Update: made everything from scratch with Shrimp.  It was great!  I tried baking half of the eggrolls and they were not good baked. These have to be fried!

FABULOUS!  We loved these!  I didn't use shrimp, instead I add a tsp of fish sauce, and some chopped cooked chicken.  Also, didn't have bean sprouts, I think this is a great basice recipe that you can cater to your family.  Thanks for sharing!

Easy and your family loves you for making them. Good family time together. I did use cole slaw mix because of recommendations to do so and it was a great idea. I had leftover pork so I chopped that up instead of the shrimp. I baked some and fried some. The baked stayed crispier longer but both tasted the same.

Very impressed was extremely easy and a wonderful way to use an excess of cabbage in the fall garden. I also tried with white meat chicken, and have tweaked flavoring to my taste! sorry! But without this wonderful recipe, I would have been lost! Thanks!

I made these as written and found these to be just OK. With the use of my food processor, it made the shredding and chopping go quickly and easily. However, I agree with some of the other reviews that the filling needs to be partially cooked prior to assembling the rolls. I found them too crunchy otherwise. I would also add more shrimp, as 4 ounces just aren't enough. I will make these again, but certainly tweak them to suit our taste. Thanks for sharing, it's a great base recipe!

We loved this recipe. I already had a egg roll recipe, so I sorta combined the two. I added chicken instead of shrimp, along with green onion, cabbage,matchstick carrots, left out the bean sprout because the store didn't have it. My husband said these were the best he has ever had, even better than some of the Chinese restaurants we have been to. Thanks for another great recipe!!!

This was my very first time making egg rolls. This was a great and easy recipe! The egg rolls turned out fantastic and the whole family enjoyed them. I used 2 cups less then the called for amount of cabbage and still had plenty to fill the rolls. I will definetly use this recipe again!

My BF says they're the best eggrolls he's ever had. (And trust me, he tells me the truth when it comes to dinner...doesn't want to be served something twice if he didn't like it the first time!) Very easy and the result is great! I skipped the sprouts and made "2 servings" and this filled 6 eggroll wrappers.  Definitely worth repeating!!

Very good.  I gave it four stars because we didn't care for the cabbage just shredded.  The second time I made it, I shredded, then chopped the cabbage fairly fine and we like it better that way.

We split this recipe into 2 bowls, one with 4 oz. shrimp and the other with a shredded slow-cooked porksteak. Skipped the onion and celery & added more bean sprouts.  We didn't care for the shrimp ones at ALL, but the pork ones were heavenly!! Even my son, who claims to dislike chinese food, ate 3!! Thanks for an excellent new recipe for our family!

These egg rolls are fantastic.  I skipped the shrimp and just used the veggies, which yielded 10 good-sized rolls.  I fried half of them and baked the other half.  I wanted to see which was better after reading some of the other reviews.  I suggest sticking to frying them as baking gave them an inauthentic taste.  The baked rolls ended up with a strange hard crunchiness to them and the veggies inside turned mushy.  The fried ones, on the other hand, were crisp and delicious!  Just like I get at local Chinese food restaurants.  I served them with some red chili sauce purchased at a nearby Asian market-- so yummy!  Thanks ROUVER!!

Very good flavor I did not change a thing. I messed up and bought wonton wrappers instead of egg roll. I can't wait to make them the right way and eat a big egg roll instead of a mini one!

These egg rolls turned out great!  I left out the shrimp and bean sprouts (didn't have any) and added an extra egg.  The cabbage mixture was flavorful and cooked up beautifully.  I used only about 1 c. of organic veg. oil, turning the egg rolls a couple of times.  I will definitely be making these again!  Thanks!!!!!

I made quiet a few adjustments, adding sausage, more egg, a bit of sesame oil, and some other things... and it was delicious... But truly I think it would have been just as good without all my changes too! Thanks for sharing!  edit: just wanted to add that I again made these eggs rolls, and some crab rangoon for a get together this weekend, and everyone RAVED about these egg rolls, said my husband and I should go into business making these and selling them! Someone else said that they could not go back to a chinese restaurant and eat egg rolls after having ours!! Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!! Made my night getting so many compliments about our food! :)

This recipe was good but I felt like something was missing.  Not sure if I should have added more pepper but an extra spice is needed.  Maybe I'll go with another poster's suggestion and add oyster sauce next time.

Best Eggrolls Hands Down! I made these last week and it was my first time ever attempting to make egg rolls.  I have to admit I was skeptical that I could make delicious egg rolls at home. They came out SO GOOD.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did not use the shrimp.  These looked, smelled and tasted great and I am serious when I say they were the best egg rolls I have ever, EVER had in my life.    I'm going to make them again tonight except I want to try baking them this time to try and avoid deep frying.  I hope they come out as awesome as they did the first time!

These taste exactly like restaurant style egg rolls.  I added some chopped bacon to some and some without, both were awesome.  Great recipe.  I suggest making everything fresh tastes much better than pre cut veggies.  It's worth the effort trust me!

This was a lot easier than I thought it would be. My husband LOVED, LOVED them and insisted this be a keeper. However, I thought it was too 'cabbagy' for me. I did use the fine shredder blade on my food processor and a whole cabbage head.  Maybe it was too much cabbage since I really didn't measure it. Overall though, the flavors blended well. I'll try it again though.  

Only part of the mixture was used right away and I let the rest sit overnight in the frig. The leftover mixture was VERY, VERY watery. Needed to strain it.  My uncle advised that's a characteristic of cabbage. It should be strained and squeezed to remove as much moisture as possible before adding other ingredients.

My first attempt at eggrolls - they weren't hard to make and were really good.  I may experiment with some other flavors next time(ginger, etc.) but this is a great recipe.

A big hit.  The last time I made egg rolls it was so messy and complicated I didn't want to do it again.  This recipe is awesome!  I added a little more shrimp and instead of chopping a lot of cabbage and carrots I used a bag of the coleslaw mix minus the dressing in place.

I will make these again, in fact I froze my leftover filling (I ran out of rolls). Next time, I will bake them. I don't deep fry often, and they all "split". I think if I do deep fry them again, I will use two rolls. 2-3 T of filling in them is really too much.

I actually made the mix the night before and placed it in  zip lock bag. I pulled it out of the fidge 20 minutes before rolling the egg rolls and placed it in a collander to drain out the liquid that had accumulated. They were a huge hit at our New Years eve party. I will never buy these from a restaurant again.

I followed the recipe exactly but I felt they lacked something.  If I try them again I would definitely add some ginger and pork.  Perhaps we are just spoiled with the local restaurants egg rolls.  Sorry to say these were not a big hit super bowl night.

Excellent recipe, very authentic and flavorful.  I browned some ground pork and cut back on the shrimp; this flavor combination worked surprisingly well together.  I would cut back slightly on the soy sauce, as they turned out a bit on the salty side.  I forgot to add the egg, but the recipe didn't suffer at all.

I thought these egg rolls were better than you get from most Chinese restaurants.  The only fault I find is that they were very greasy after cooking, thats the only reason they didn't get 5 stars. I added some finely chopped cooked tenderloin to the recipe

These egg rolls had a delicious taste (my fiance agreed)!  I omitted the celery (forgot to get it at the store) and instead of deep frying them in egg roll wrappers, I baked them in some extra phyllo dough that I had left over.  Would definitely make these again!

These egg rolls are amazingly good!  I made them vegan by omitting shrimp and egg (wrappers were also vegan),  but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I also used the suggestion of wetting my fingertips in the vegetable liquid instead of making a cornstarch slurry; this was a great time saver.  What a wonderful surprise addition these were to my dinner!  Recipe made about 14 egg rolls.

My husband LOVES these! We make them all veggie, I add extra vegs to use up my package of egg roll wrappers. I made them in an electric skillet with olive oil because the temperature isn't too hot for olive oil ( I checked). I will be trying this recipe in my new air fryer very soon! My first air fryer recipe I tried was Chef John's Baked Onion Rings (which I add more cayenne and crushed red pepper to) and it was awesome!

My husband and I absolutely loved these egg rolls!  I've always wanted to make them, but thought it would be too tricky but this recipe was easy! I only used 3 cups cabbage & 2 cups book choy.  I used everything fresh; nothing frozen. When I made the mix per the recipe,  minus the corn starch, I let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours until I was ready to make.  I noticed some people said it didn't have enough flavor, but letting all the flavors sit for a bit helped.  I took someone's idea to broil them & they came out perfect.  I took the leftover ones, flash froze them then put in freezer bags for the next time we want them.    Thank you for this recipe, it's a keeper!

The shrimp left a terrible taste! I used my air dryer but that was the only difference. My veggie egg rolls always turn out great in the air fryer, I may try these again minus the shrimp.

I was quite pleased. I mostly followed the recipe except that I added shredded ginger to the vegetables and lightly cooked vegetables before wrapping them. Also, I didn't have bean sprouts. Instead of frying I followed some of the other suggestions & brushed them with olive oil and popped them in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes. They taste like restaurant egg rolls without the greasiness.

Too much cabbage; not enough egg; needs salt!! white pepper and thick fish sauce. The shredded cabbage should be disgorged OVERNIGHT otherwise it will be way too watery and makes a big mess; egg rolls can fall apart. Also  dangerous if you deep fry! Other problem is the shredded  ingredients do not stay together and are really hard to work with. 

Best thing would be to cook the cabbage mix, let it cool, then add raw egg and make a paste.
The paste should be grated in a processor with some raw egg, rolled in cylinders and stay in refrigerator UNTIL NEXT DAY. then you can start rolling your egg rolls.

I used to work in a Chinese restaurant and I know by experience that it takes 3-4 DAYS to make egg rolls if you follow the steps correctly!

This is a good start for restaurant style egg rolls, but the flavor was somewhat lacking. Next time I will add pork in addition to the shrimp to see if that ups the savoriness.

Excellent recipe.  I made mine vegetarian by omitting egg and meat and upping sprouts to 1 cup and adding 2 minced green onions.  I also added a tablespoon of hoisin and a teaspoon of chili flakes.  Better than takeout, and didn't miss the meat at all.  I just used warm water to moisten the edges and they sealed very well.

Substituted ground pork in place of the shrimp and baked instead of frying. These were really good.

Definitely the best egg rolls recipe! I have always wanted to learn how to make egg rolls. This recipe was easy to follow and put together.  I did watch some videos on how to roll the egg rolls.  I substituted lean ground pork for the shrimp.  I also added green onion instead of regular onion.  The family thoroughly enjoyed them!

I made these the other night as part of a Chinese dinner. Time didn't really matter as I was chopping everything up for all the other dishes. I made these per the recipe only I added an extra egg because I had more filling than called for but these turned out great. Better than any restaurant that I've been to in a long time.  Got rave reviews from my guests. Will definitely make more of these and freeze them for future use.

I give this and any egg roll recipes a 1 rating, only because they fell apart!!!  My husband and I love egg rolls. So we decided to give this recipe a try.... Like others have said, I too will let restaurants make them!  I used a deep fryer and made the mistake of putting 2 into fryer. They touched, ripped and of course the remains are floating and at the bottom of fryer. What a MESS!!!  My mistake. I should have used a frying pan or baked them. I might try it again sometime, not too soon... We did add all remaining chopped ingredients to stir fry veggies and it tasted good!!!

Oct 2015: Made ours with ground pork, cole slaw mix, and celery. Seasoned with powdered ginger, powdered garlic, powdered onion, sriracha, soy sauce, black pepper, & garlic salt. Sprayed them liberally with vegetable oil and baked. Oh my they were tasty.
UPDATE: made them a 2nd time omitting the powdered ginger and instead adding ginger salad dressing. Yum!

I tweaked the recipe little based on the reviews.  I used frozen shrimp and ground pork and cooked them.  I used coleslaw mix and cooked it down along with the other vegetables, shallots instead of onions.  I added 2 tablespoons each of teriyaki sauce, oyster sauce, ginger, sesame seed oil, and Asian Five Spice.  Also, increased the soy sauce to 3 tablespoons.  After rolling them, I brushed them with sesame oil and sprinkled them with sesame seeds and fried them in peanut oil. Be sure the oil is very hot before you put the rolls in.  That is the key.  However, be careful you do not burn yourself with the hot grease. These egg rolls tasted absolutely better than the Chinese restaurant.  They are wonderful!  The basic recipe here needs help.

I used my overabundance of cabbage on these, and they are fantastic! I ended up making large batches of these and freezing them to enjoy in the months ahead. I did partially fry them before freezing, and plan to bake the rest of the way from the freezer.

Kinda bland.  Make sure to cook off all of the liquid that comes out of the veg.  Also add 2 or 3 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter to the filling.  Trust me on this!

This was my first time making egg rolls and they turned out wonderfully. I didn't use sprouts, because I'm not a sprout kind of girl, and I subbed in shredded chicken. Took some of the other reviewers' advice and used 3T of soy sauce, but next time I might use 4T. I got 18 in my batch. Fried up 6 and froze the others unfried in two batches to use later. My boyfriend loved them. Said they were better than any frozen egg rolls we'd tried. I thought they were, too. Wanted to take a picture but we ate them too fast! Thanks, Rouver!

I'm not sure if my rating is fair.  I did not make this recipe exactly as printed.  Maybe if I had it would have tasted better.  I baked them instead of frying and I didn't add the shrimp.  Still, it didn't have alot of flavour. I Don't know what I could have added to give it a little more zip.  I think next time I will leave out the cabbage and just have bean sprouts and maybe some mushrooms.   I'm still glad I tried it.

THIS WASNT A BIT HIT BUT MAYBE BECAUSE I SERVED THEM AS A THANKSGIVING APP. I ALSO ADDED JUMBO LUMP CRAB MEAT AND FRESH GINGER. IN THE OIL I ADDED SESAME OIL FOR ALITTLE MORE FLAVOR.

This recipe is better than the one for our local Chinese place. I used ground  turkey instead of shrimp ( only because of a food allergy). I get asked to make them all the time now!

These were great egg rolls. The whole family loved them. They taste just like Chinese restaurant egg rolls. And they weren't nearly as difficult as I feared.

These turned out pretty good!  They took a little time to make, but I'm really glad I tried them.  They could definately use a little more seasoning, but other than that really tasty! Thanks.

A family favorite!!!  Love it! When folding,  lay out with one corner toward you, fold in half (point to point), fold in sides, and roll.   Using cornstarch and water as the "glue".

Very tasty and fun to make!  I took the advise of another reviewer and substituted the shrimp with cooked pork.  I also substituted the onion with a large shallot.  I fried them in my electric fondue pot 2-3 at a time.  It worked really well.  My hubby loves these egg rolls!
