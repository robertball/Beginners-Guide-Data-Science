A fresh, light and delicately flavored pasta dish.  I used fresh herbs (parsley, basil and green onion) and I do think that makes a world of difference.  Loved it.

The lemon flavor was spot on, but the herbs were lacking.  This well could be a matter of personal taste preference, but I increased the garlic and would "at least" double the oregano and basil the next time.  I added some shrimp and marinated artichoke hearts for a nice dinner this evening.  Thanks, Beth, we enjoyed your recipe.

Very good. I doubled the recipe and tossed it with a pound of pasta, a bag of steamed broccoli, and a grocery store rotisserie chicken that I stripped of it's meat. Made a full meal.

This dish needed some adjustments but then came out perfect! I used fresh herbs and doubled them, added sliced green onions, sliced mushrooms 1/4 cup chardonnay & a splash of EVOO. Was a perfect pair with the Shrimp Francesca also on this site.

I really liked this. Simple, fresh, light-tasting and easy pasta dish to put together. I was looking for a pasta dish without a heavy sauce. Agree with other reviewers--double the seasonings. I pan-fried chicken breasts and served with green beans and salad.

Sauce is easy, and I like that.  I followed the advice of others and doubled the seasonings.  But I didn't use this for pasta.  I used it to cook boneless, skinless chicken breasts in, on the stove.
Medium heat, covered pan, and turned meat after 5 minutes, re-covered and cooked additional 5 minutes.  It was good.  Husband liked it and told me he'd eat it again, so that works for me.  Next time I plan to halve the butter, use other ingredients as listed and spoon a little over the chicken instead of cooking in the sauce.  Thinking it might be a fresher flavor that way.  In any case we liked the flavor, so thanks for the submission.

Made it tonight as a side. But with 5 kids I make a pound of pasta so I used 6 tbs. of margarine, 1 cup of broth, a teaspoon of basil, oregano and garlic and 5 tbs of lemon juice. After adding the sauce to the noodles I then sprinkled it with parmasean cheese. Turned out so good that my wife asked me to save the recipe to make it again. Super easy, super delicious.

I made this pasta just as the recipe stated.  The pasta had a good flavor, but the flavor was very light.  I ate the pasta mainly as a side dish.  I will keep this recipe and will definitely make it again.  The next time I may add some shrimp to make the pasta less plain.

Great and easy recipe that can be adjusted to what you have on hand!  I was forced to make a few adjustments when I realized I didn't have chicken broth.  I added more garlic and white cooking wine to the butter.  I also added 1 shredded chicken breast and threw in both Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese.

The only changes I made to this was to add some capers (I added them while the butter melted) and about doubled the herbs. I then served it with sliced grilled Cajun chicken on top and sprinkled it all with some fresh parmesan. My husband and I both were unsure for the first few bites, but it got better the more we ate! I'll definitely be making this again.

A good base, but needs tons more seasoning. We used parsley, oregano, basil, parsley, onion powder, and garlic salt. Can easily be made vegetarian by substituting veggie instead of chicken broth.

Sauce is weaker than I enjoy so I usually make more than the recipe calls for, but it's still good. I've made it many times and will continue doing so.

I used a little more broth, and used a bit of corn starch to thicken. I only used a couple of cups of pasta, since I was cooking for two.  It was really tasty with grilled Greek chicken.

Someone else's recipe is a guideline for me.  I loved that it was light and easy. I sautéed my garlic a  drizzle of EVOO 1st.  I also add some wine & fresh herbs.  Perfect for my fresh pasta.  I will remember this one.

This was a great, simple recipe. The lemon flavor was just right. I added some frozen broccoli and about 2 tbs of EVOO, and let that simmer with the garlic and herbs, then tossed with the pasta. I also doubled the spices as other reviewers stated. Will make again!

I made this exactly following the directions with some baked chicken that I made and it was really yummy. 

The following night, I added sun dried tomatoes and had that as a meal.

This is an extremely versatile recipe however it only gets 4 stars because next time I will reduce the butter by 1/2 as I had a slew of butter on the bottom of my pot that had nowhere to go

I made it but not as exact as the written recipe. I run out herbs and substituted them with chopped celery. Turned out ok. Also added mushrooms to the cook. I like the light taste and definitely will cook it again.

The bottom line is that it's just bland.  After reading the reviews that said it lacked flavor, I added some olive oil, flour to thicken the sauce, the juice of an entire lemon, a splash or two of chardonnay,  more than doubled the oregano and basil, added 4 huge cloves of garlic, and then some lemon pepper, some more salt and then another splash of wine. I would probably only make this again if I used fresh herbs. If I did make this again, I might throw in some red pepper flakes as well.

Excellent! Took others advice about doubling the herbs. Didn't have fresh so used Italian seasoning instead. Added asparagus and I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

This dish is very good by itself. I prefer fresh herbs and I added 1/4 tsp of ground ginger and 1tbs of parsley. After I coat the pasta I add 1 cup of grated Parmesan. I could eat this for days

I added a little bit of olive oil, and cut back on the butter. Very light and tasty. I paired it with chicken spedini and steamed broccoli.

It was just OK, doubt I'll make it again as it was kind of bland. Followed other reviews suggestions and doubled the ingredients.

I think this is an excellent recipe or could be - had to change a few things and will change another when I make it again.
What I changed - there is no thickening, so cooking till it thickens isn't really going to happen, it will reduce but that is not the same thing.  I added just a bit of flour to the butter and that took care of that.  Also there is nowhere near enough liquid to make a sauce to cover all those noodles.  I started just by doubling the chicken broth and the lemon juice.  That still wasn't enough, I kept adding more & more chicken broth until I added the whole 14.5oz can  :) 
What I will change the amount of lemon juice, first I will try it without doubling it and still using the whole can of broth - maybe that will make the lemon not so strong.  Now maybe they intended us to use a fresh lemon and not Real Lemon (which is stronger) but that's all I ever have around sooooo.  If it's still to strong I back it off more.    But it was a great recipe and very easy to make.

I used shell pasta instead of the recommended type, but it works! Had to sub some of the sauce ingredients too--garlic powder and Italian spices, but it's still delicious! Love it!

I changed the serving size to 2 for just my husband and myself. I followed the ingredients precisely. It didn't look like enough spices, butter, etc but to us it was tasty. My husband says too much lemon, but I thought it was fine. Everyone has different tastes. I liked it because it is a light sauce as prepared which is what I wanted. I had to change serving size because we both would have finished off the original serving size. Forgot to mention, I used no yolk noodles. A bit lighter than the bowtie pasta. Thanks for posting the recipe.

I made this tonight with all the same ingredients listed, but added some sautéd small pieces of seasoned chicken breast and added that to the 'almost' finished pan. Then I decided to add some whipped cream cheese...several tablespoonfuls. This dish was awesome. I'm sure this would have been delicious as written, but it's fun and so tasty to add other yummy stuff too. Thanks Elizabeth.

This is good to dress up some pasta, but it is very light. I added green onions and chicken (with a little less chicken broth) to the sauce. I added a lot more garlic and a little more oregano and basil. I  like that this was very fast and very easy.

Made this for my family of picky eaters. Everyone loved the light taste even though it was a departure for the kids from plain or the norm. My husband and I agreed it was very good, will try it with seafood and pasta next time. I enjoyed the ease of preparation. Thanks for posting!

Used it for the pasta with shrimp scampi. Only change was to add garlic to butter on low heat and stir till fragrant. Then add the rest of ingredients.

I made this tonight for dinner, and it was delicious. I purchased some fancy lemon bowtie pasta and made it with that. I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of the minced garlic and I think that improved it. I hope to make it again.

YAY!!!!!! So glad to have would this wonderfully quick and flavorful recipe! The family's first comment was, "YUM," the second was, "This takes like a restaurant," and the third was, "Let's add it to the rotation."  So I did! The leftover sauce is delicious drizzled over Ritz Crackers too...

Added some crumbled chicken sausage, and some roasted sliced zucchini, and fresh basil instead of dried.  It was terrific, the whole family loved it.
