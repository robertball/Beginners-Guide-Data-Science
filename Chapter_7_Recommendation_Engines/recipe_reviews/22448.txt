This recipe was pretty good.  However, I suggest to not use plain bread crumbs.  If you do, add some spices of your own.  I made this last night with plain bread crumbs.  After I sampled one I realized how bland it tasted.  So I sprinkled the eggplants with Garlic Salt, Pepper, and Lawry's Seasoning Salt.  That definatley gave it the extra punch I needed after using plain bread crumbs.

I love fried eggplant, but I haven't made it in a couple of years because I was taught to deep-fry the eggplant slices, and I try to avoid deep-frying our food. But I was really craving it tonight and found this very easy recipe here. After reading the reviews, I decided to try frying the eggplant in fat-free olive oil cooking spray. Delicious and guilt-free! I used seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan cheese, with salt and pepper added for flavor. Even my picky kids loved it. I'm only sad that my husband - who swears that he's not picky - wouldn't even touch it, because he says he hates eggplant. I'm sure he'd change his mind if he gave this recipe a try!

Cooked for my husband and he absolutely loved it.  I even double dipped into the egg again and then dipped into grated parmesan cheese for an additional flavor.  This recipe was extremely easy and I will definitely do this one again.

The best way to fry eggplant is also the simplest!  This was delicious!  I left the peels on. I also took the advice of a previous reviewer and added salt and coarse black pepper to the egg.  Yummy!

My mother fixed fried eggplant when I was a kid.  I didn't care for it then, so I was skeptical.  But a friend gave me an eggplant, so I wanted to use it and decided to give this recipe a shot.

It was fantastic.  I learned that I much prefer thin slices.  The eggplant browns quickly, so be prepared to watch it like a hawk.  Brown is good; black is not.  I didn't burn any, but it was close.  As other reviewers suggest, I mixed some grated parmesan cheese with bread crumbs.  When finished, make sure you give the eggplant plenty of salt.  

It was great plain, but in reading other reviews, I'm going to use spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese for a nice main course of leftovers.  I used the fried eggplant as a side dish today, but as eggplant parmesan, it will work great as a main dish.

I tried this recipe because it looked the easiest, but Oh My... was it ever so tasty. My mother used to hate eggplant until tonight. I did add salt, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder & seasoning salt to my egg wash and also used the Italian style bread crumbs...and the seller is the fact that my 4 year old won't stop eating them! Yay!

This recipe is a real keeper, the family loved it. I used pre-seasond Italian bread crumbs and olive oil. I needed to turn the heat down and add more oil than the recipe called for.

This recipe is basically the way I used to make eggplant but with seasoned crumbs and some added spices.  I found it was too greasy but who doesn't love some fat flavor, lol.  Eggplant soaks up a lot of oil in frying.  Now I preheat the oven to 400 degrees, put alum foil on the baking pans, spray the pans with olive oil, put the breaded eggplant on the pans, spray the top of the eggplant with oil and cook until fork tender.  It depends on how thick you cut the slices.  Most times 10-15 minutes will do and it still comes out nice and crispy.  You still get the flavor of frying without so much fat and this is an easier and cleaner method of oven frying eggplant.

This was really really good!  I have decided to no longer eat meat so I am trying all new things.  My only 2 suggestions are that we needed to use more oil and we had TONS of breadcrumbs left over.  So next time I will just put oil to cover the bottom of the pan and probably only use 1 cup of breadcrumbs.  I had a relatively decent size eggplant also.  But the taste was great!  I will definetly make this recipe again!

Don't get my 4 stars wrong, this was delicious and I turned on 6+ people who had been sworn enemies of eggplant previously to this recipe. HOWEVER, it loses a star for being kind of flimsy and greasy. You want a 5 star fried eggplant? Use buttermilk in place of the egg. Then mix together 1/2 c. parm cheese (out of the shaker, nothing fancy), 2 tbsp italian seasoning, 1 tsp sea salt, and 2 c. cornmeal instead of the bread crumbs. If you want a great crunch, double dip through the buttermilk and cornmeal. Try one w/the bread crumbs and one with the cornmeal and tell me I'm wrong, I dare ya!

There is nothing spectacular about this recipe.  It lacks salt, the amount of oil is laughably small, and the cooking time is way too short.  You will never fry a whole eggplant in 2 tablespoons oil because eggplant are oil sponges..

If you bread eggplant with flour instead of bread crumbs this will prevent the eggplant from soaking up the oil.  Breadcrumbs absorb the oil and stay greasy; but dipping the sliced eggplant in eggs and then flour forms a compliment with the oil which then cooks to become a delicious golden brown crust.

I only give this 3 stars because I feel that you really need to do a couple things differently.  1st you need to sweat the eggplant by sprinkling it with salt and letting it drain in a colander over the sink for at least 20 min.  This improves the texture and flavor.  2nd use Italian seasoned Panko instead of plain breadcrumbs.  Last, heat olive oil until it shimmers then add eggplant.  Done this way, a plain recipe becomes great.  My husband normally refused eggplant until I made this.  It's a great appetizer served plain or with spaghetti sauce for dipping!

I salted my slices of eggplant for 30 minutes first and then rinsed and dried.  I also floured before I did the egg wash and I used italian seasoned bread crumbs.  If you follow this recipe exactly you are going to come out with some very bland eggplant no matter how much salt you add at the end.  You also need to make sure your oil is hot before you add your eggplant and do not crowd the pan or you will end up with some soggy eggplant.  It was good once I added some seasoning!

sOoOo great!!! when I usually make these, I double dip the eggplant. First I dip in the egg, then dip in flour & black pepper, dip again in egg, and then finally dip into bread crumbs. For some reason when I "double dip" the egg plant it comes out even better!

This is yummy, and better with flavored bread crumbs as many suggest. I haven't read all the reviews, but to take away any bitterness, soak the eggplant slices in a single layer in cold, salted water for about 3 hours before preparing. My teens ate this, and asked for seconds, much to my surprise.

*** Dip, bread and refridgerate for 20 minutes - then fry.  Bread crumps will stay on the eggplant and not in the pan!  
As a child I didn't care for this but by the time I was a teen - couldn't get enough. Of course, back then it was fried in butter. I admit I still use butter but with a mix of oil.

Well, IMO there is one key thing this recipe doesn't get right and that is to prep the eggplant. You want to lay them out, salt both sides and wait about an hour. Rinse them off completely, then they are ready for your seasoned breading. The salt treatment removes most of the bitterness and allows the sweet flavor to come out. I also never peel my fried eggplant.

Great recipe.  My only suggestion is to first dip the eggplant slices into all-purpose flour, before dipping it into the egg mixture.  The flour helps the egg adhere to the eggplant, then roll in the breadcrumbs and fry.

This was great! I removed the bitter juice beforehand by heavily salting the slices and letting them sweat for 30 mins, then rinsed and dried before dipping into the egg. For a fun variation, I added a tablespoon of curry powder to the breadcrumbs, and mixed plain yogurt with ground coriander to serve alongside as a dipping sauce.

I make this recipe all the time. The only thing I do different is I add Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs for a little extra flavor. As far as the eggplant being soggy, this really only happens if you don't have the oil hot enough when you add the eggplant. Easy & delicious. Great recipe!

I have always "weeped" eggplant & zuchinni by salting after slicing and letting it drain in a collandar - about 20 mins.  Then pat dry and rub lightly with olive oil.
After that, do what you do.
I would agree plain crumbs are probably boring - use spices, but try and stay away from "salts".  i.e., garlic salt, onion salt, etc.  Best to use powders...

I like using corn meal with my eggplant and I cut them like long skinny fries. I dip in egg wash then roll in the seasoned corn meal and use very little oil to fry in.  They will turn out very crispy and never soggy at all.  It is hard for me to fry enough as they come by and snag them as soon as they cool off enough to grab!

I cut thin slices and left the skin on.  Then salted them and let them drain for 30 minutes to get the bitterness out and make the eggplant softer.  Dipped in egg and then a combo of half dry bread crumbs and half shredded parmesan, and fried in light olive oil.  This was delicious - best I've had, and very easy.

You must add more seasoning (a lot more!)  to the bread crumbs and season with salt right after they come out from frying but this is just the base for whatever kind of fried eggplant you want to have. If you want to knock it out of the park add some Szechuan pepper (the numbing kind of spice used at Chinese restaurants) and red pepper flakes.

Made this gluten free (used almond and coconut flours instead) and fried in a combo of olive and coconut oils instead of canola.  Then made them into mini pizzas and baked them!  Delish!

Just made this, almost ate my fingers. They are so good. I added garlic powder and a little salt to the egg mixture. Also added garlic powder and black pepper to the crumbs. I made whole wheat cracker crumbs. My husband loved it, will definitively make again.

I make this all the time, but add some pinches of garlic powder, dried basil, and oregano and a little flour to the bread crumbs.  Also when they are done sprinkle some grated locatelli cheese on top. They're the best!!! ( don't add cheese to bread crumbs they tend to brown to fast, before the eggplant cooks).

Did this for a side dish with dinner yesterday, and used Souza'sGirl 'double dip' method. Also did not have canola oil, so used a mixture of sesame and vegetable oils. Worked out fine. Also added a little Garlic Powder and Onion Powder to the bread crumbs. First time I've had eggplant in over 70 years. Seems to be a keeper.

After frying eggplant remove to a platter and top with sauted mushrooms and then sliced tomatoes.  Salt and pepper the tomatoes and add your favorite dressing.  I've been doing this for years and it is yummy

I did not like this recipe because all I could taste was bread crumbs.  It was really bland.  I think it would taste better by dipping the eggplant in egg and flour and adding salt and pepper.

This is a great basic recipe but you definately have to add spices or at least salt. I added Ras El Hanout, which gives it a nice zing, to the flour mixture. I didn´t have breadcrumbs. Unfortunately the flour didnt stick well to the eggplant, so they turned out with "bald patches".

One way to keep eggplant from soaking up too much oil is to salt after slicing and let stand for 1/2 hour or so--rinse after, pat dry and proceed with recipe.

Easy recipe.  Since the eggplant soaks oil up like crazy I made my second batch with spray oils instead and reapplied with each pan full.  The flavor was just as good and the eggplant was not as oily.  My family preferred it with italian seasoning in the bread crumbs rather than with plain ones.

I'm a vegetarian and one of the only things i miss about meat is boneless buffalo chicken wings.  This recipe is the perfect thing to make vegetarian buffalo eggplant with, as it is so simple without the Italian flavors.  Fry this up as directed and add some crumbled bleu cheese and your own special buffalo sauce (or just plain hot sauce) for a delicious veggie alternative.

I wanted to eggplant since i had never had it before and this was delicious! i did my homework on eggplant before i even tried this. after i washed and peeled it, i soaked it in salt water for a few minutes. I drained and added seasoned salt and pepper. i also added some dry wishbone buttermilk ranch dressing to the italian seasoned breadcrumbs. i used enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and they came out wonderful. I also used some ranch dressing for the dipping sauce. will be using this again!!

I made some modifications as specified by other reviewers (e.g., seasoned the bread crumbs, salted and rinsed beforehand) and it turned out ok.  As one reviewer suggested, I also sliced the eggplant pretty thin (e.g., less than 1/4 inch).  This turned out too be too thin - for some of the pieces all we could taste was breading.  Next time, we'll go a little thicker.

I used panko breadcrumbs seasoned with some garlic powder and then seasoned the eggplant with lots of pepper and some salt as soon as they were done frying!  YUM!!  I used these as part of an open faced french bread pesto pizza (cut the bread in 1/2, used pesto instead of pizza sauce, roasted red peppers, fried eggplant, fresh tomatoes and mozzarella- YUMMM!!) Thanks for a versatile recipe!

I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs mixed with some parmesan cheese. Following advice I had read somewhere, I dipped the eggplant in eggs first, then the breadcrumb mixture, then egg again. I think the second dip in the egg makes it a lot better. I didn't add salt, but found it did need some salt. I would suggest slicing the eggplant fairly thin so that it cooks all the way through. I also salted, rinsed and dried the eggplant before cooking as some people suggested--I'm not that familiar with eggplant, so I don't know if it made a difference, but the eggplant was not soggy or bitter, so maybe it helped. Anyway, I was happy with the way the eggplant turned out--I only gave three stars since I varied the recipe. You could probably use the same method to make fried green tomatoes.

Kind of plain on it's own, but a great base for eggplant parmesan.  I froze these, and took out a few at a time for a quick meal--throw on a slice of mozzarella, and pour on some store-bought tomato sauce.  Great!

I grew up on fried eggplant, and it's so delicious.  This is a basic recipe, although I don't know how you can make this with just 2-3 tablespoons of oil--it'll definitely take more.  I suggest using olive oil, as it goes so well with the delicate flavor of eggplant.  Also, salt on the finished product is a must.  How long you cook the eggplant per side is dependent on the heat in the pan, and the thickness of the eggplant.  You want the outside crispy, and the inside soft...uncooked eggplant is kind of spongy and yucky.  I usually use flour to coat it with instead of bread crumbs, and that is great too.  The last time I made it, I used 1/2 plain bread crumbs, and 1/2 Panko (Japanese bread crumbs), and it was really crispy.

Very easy. I'm very new to cooking with eggplant so I was scared to try. A few tips that I'll be using next time I make this:
cut the slices thinner than imagined, maybe 1/4 inch (originally, I cut them about 1/2 in. thick and it was too thick to cook through nicely)
I read other reviews about adding spices and double breading, so I did just that. I had 3 bowls, 1 with egg, 1 with flour and spices (salt, pepper, garlic salt) and the third with bread crumbs and italian seasoning. dipped in egg, then flour, then egg again, and finally, bread crumbs.
I'm not sure how tasty it would have been had I not added the spices, because that really did influence the taste...

Use crushed cornflakes for crunchier coating. Salt eggplant and drain on paper towels before frying. Do not crowd in frying pan as eggplant has high water content and won't crisp up right. Season with garlic salt and fresh ground pepper

Very tasty, very easy.  Next time I think I'll try and slice the eggplant very thin to get a little more crisp to it.  

Also, be forewarned that the slices shed bread crumbs in the pan, which can burn fast.  Either use a pan big enough to do the entire eggplant at one go, or have a secondary pan ready to go.

My husband and I both liked this....the kids not so much.  I used Italian bread crumbs and mixed with parmesan cheese.  When I ran out of the bread crumbs I subbed smashed up Ritz crackers w/parmesan cheese which was also very good.  Placed eggplant on fettucini with some homemade spaghetti sauce over top.  Very good.

Very good and very easy!  I have never made fried eggplant, and it couldn't have been easier.  To cut down on fat, I used only 1 t of olive oil, just enough to coat the pan.   I also used italian seasoned Panko bread crumbs and added a little chili powder for kick and garlic salt.  Wonderful!

This was pretty good, but a bit bland.  We ended up using pasta sauce over the last ones because we needed something more, since we were having it as a meal.  However, as a side dish, the recipe is perfect!

10-4-11: This was pretty good, but some of the eggplant burned - needs careful attention to the heat.

I used the Panko (Japanese Bread crumbs) for a crisper, lighter coating.  I also added 1/4 tsp. garlic salt and 1 tsp. Italian seasonings (could use just oregano).  This give this recipe much more flavor.  To reduce the fat and cholesterol you could use only 1 egg mixed with 2 Tbsp. water.

Thanks very much for this simple recipe.  I varied this by experimenting with grinding up Italian herb dressing into crumbs (a bit crunchy), which added a nice delicate spice to the eggplant.  I might see if I get away with adding spice to the finer plain bread crumb mix, or see if there's a herbal bread crumb mix.

I don't recall ever eating eggplant.  I grew it in my garden for the first time thinking it would be a good treat for my chickens.  This recipe looked easy enough to try first and all I have to say is...my chickens will have to wait until next year when I grow extra!  I added grated parmesian to plain bread crumbs and sprinkled salt at the end.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to dunk in ranch dressing or put tomatoes on top as some others suggested because I gulped it down right at the stove!  Definitely cook this again and try some of the other suggestions.

it will be best if you sprinkle first the peeled eggplant w/salt and white pepper before dipping it to egg.this is good and dont forget the temperature of the oil.it is best to check it 1st.good recipe!

This is pretty much how I always made it. I, like some others, used olive oil in place of canola and added more as needed due to the eggplant eating it up. I also added garlic powder, parmesan and romano cheese, and seasoned salt to the Italian breadcrumbs. I had 2 medium eggplants cut into 3/4" slices and used 2 beaten eggs, not 3. We also enjoyed them better with a little warmed spaghetti sauce on the side (kind of like an eggplant parmesan).

This recipe was really easy and really delicious!  I used Italian Bread Crumbs and didn't need to add any more spices to it.  To garnish the dish, I put slices of tomato on top of each eggplant and served with sour cream on the side.  This was my first time cooking eggplant and I'm planning on making this again for my husband again very soon!

I loved this recipe.  Even my picky husband liked it.  Because we're watching calories, I used cooking spray and a light breading.  I found the eggplant to have a delicate creamy flavor.  And so easy!  Thanks!

I just made this! The boyfriend was a little put off by the idea of eating eggplant, but quickly found out he loved it! He couldn't stop eating it, and neither could I. I made a few small changes by adding a tsp. of garlic powder, using the recommended parm cheese, and adding a tbsp of freeze-dried Italian seasoning. I had a garden fresh eggplant, and it was delish! I also used EVOO in place of canola!

The were Wonderful!  I have to say I use to just use flour, salt and pepper.  I love the taste of using the Italian bread crumbs.  Nothing more has to be done if you stick to the Italian crumbs. Oh, I did sprinkle with a little salt after they were cooked but not much. This is the way to go!

Loved it EXCEPT, I exchanged bread crumbs for progresso Italian bread crumbs and rather than canola oil, used coconut oil. Great to eat cold, in sandwiches, as a side with pasta and sauce, get creative!

When I was a child my mom made fried eggplant,she would peel and slice the night before she was going to cook it, place slices on plate cover with another plate and set  something heavy on the top plate. I aked why and she said this took out excess water and acid from eggplant.  Also she made a tomato gravy to put on the fried eggplant, great meal.

Instead of plain breadcrumbs we used italian style bread crumbs with parmesan cheese and dried basil. Also, double battered.

Really good, nice and crispy on outside, creamy (not mushy) on inside.  I did use seasoned breadcrumbs, mix of olive oil and cannola oil to equal 1/4 inch in skillet and liberal salt after draining on paper towels.  Nice change from smothered in tomato sauce and cheese, just plain good!

Great! Quick and easy for sure. I used whole wheat flour instead of bread crumbs. And I mixed milk in with a couple eggs to help stretch it (kinda like when making french toast). Then instead of tomato slices, we dipped it in some warmed up marinara. Yummy!!!

I took other people's advice and added grated parmesan, garlic powder and salt to panko bread crumbs, and sauteed the eggplant in extra virging olive oil. You don't need three eggs, either. I used one with a little water, because that's all I had, and it was plenty. These were a huge hit with my kids! Thanks!

Tried this with a twist. Used olive oil and seasoned panko bread crumbs. When they were done, I topped them with mozarella cheese, covered till cheese melted. Served topped with pasta sauce. Yum!

DE-FRIKKIN-LICIOUS!!  SUPER Easy Fried Eggplant is what it should be called. They turned out beautifully and tasted just as good. I didnt peel mine and they were still great.

OMG this was so easy and delicious! I thought it would be too plain, but it was great on its own. I did use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs though, so I'm sure that helped. I will definitely use this recipe the next time i make eggplant parmesan as well! Thank you!

I guess I'm not an eggplant person: my husband and I thought they were really bland, despite my having added salt, pepper, and a few other spices to the bread crumbs. Wonderful texture, though!

This was good.  But you definately need more oil than what's called for in the original recipe. I just covered the bottom of my frying pan with oil and that was perfect.

This recipe is perfect, however is best when you use Progressive brand Parmesian bread crumbs.  This just adds even more to this simple recipe.  When preparing the eggplant, dig the seeds out with a spoon carefully, so not to loose too much of the "good stuff"

Very simple and tasty.   I added a 1/2 cup of parmesan to the bread crumbs.  Even though some reviewers said the recipe calls for not enough oil,  it does state clearly you may need to use more oil than suggested.  I used Panco breadcrumbs instead of regular  breadcrumbs.

I made this last night & it was so easy!  I'm wondering why I haven't tried it before.  I have an Italian aunt that would kill me if I didn't "sweat" them, so I pored salt on both sides of each slice & let them sit for 30 minutes.  Rinsed them off and fried them up.  I don't like to change recipes, because that annoys me, but in this case, the only oil I had was vegetable so I had to use it.  I started out with the recommended amount and just kept adding oil as I went.

This recipe was GREAT!  I can't wait to make it again, but the next time I'll make eggplant parmesan.

I cut the  eggplant and put salt on it for about 30 minutes to get some of the wayer out of it.

I then floured...egg...then bread crumbs. 

I fried these in about a cup of oil...like deep fried.  

They were amazing. I did add garlic powder...onion powder...salt and pepper to the bread crumbs.

I gave it three stars because the recipe on its own would have been way too bland.  But if you add spices, it's definitely a five-star recipe.  Anyway, you want to know what tastes better than bread crumbs?  Definitely corn meal!  I spiced it up with Hungarian paprika, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Mmm.

I give this recipe 3 stars without adjustments because the taste was very bland. However, after changing the recipe the second time around by adding garlic powder and salt to the bread crumbs (an adjustment made by another reviewer), I was very pleased. I give this recipe with the alterations a five.

Delicious and very quick and easy.  I added Italian Spices to the breadcrumbs along with extra Dried Oregano and Parmesan Cheese to taste.  I also lightly salted them before sautéing. They do soak up the oil very quickly, so I had to add additional oil.  I chose to use  Extra Virgin Olive Oil and it worked just fine.  ~ Rani

Perfect way to serve eggplant and get some more veggies...even if frying them nullifies the benefits. Definitely use more oil. I had seasoned breadcrumbs and they came out great - I know a lot of people said they were very bland. Topped them with some mozzarella and served with regular old store bought spaghetti sauce. If you kids like to "dunk" food, this is great recipe!
Wonderful, fast and easy way to serve eggplant:)

I haven't made this yet. Want to know if you really can cook all that eggplant is just 2T of oil. iIgave it 4 stars because it sounds good...but too good to be true.

I definitely agree with those that say it's too plain.  I used plain bread crumbs, but added quite a bit of Italian seasoning to the mixture.  Also, I had another bowl for parmeson cheese.  The ones dipped in breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese were the favorites.

I don't think I've ever had eggplant before but had a free eggplant and decided this was a good start to try and cook it.  Unfortunately I was really short on ingredients, so I just followed the gist.  We ran out of eggs and bread, so I just filled a plastic bag with a few tbsps of flour, some salt, some pepper, and a little Parmesan cheese as recommended by other reviews and shook slices in it to coat.  As mentioned, the pieces sucked up oil like crazy so I had to cook them high and fast.  I served them up with some sauteed peppers and basil and result was delicious.  :)  Would definitely do it again.

I'm on board with everyone as far as added seasoning is concerned (marinated in olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper then dredged in flour to help egg stick, onion soup mix in bread crumbs). With that said, I have always tried assorted methods of frying my eggplant coated in flour....and have always ended up with a floppy, occasionally tasty mess. We're poor country folk, we like to eat stuff like this with our hands....and my way didn't accommodate. The color, the texture, SIMPLICITY you get it all with this recipe. I don't review much, but eggplant is one of those  foods that is a disaster if you don't get it "just right". Well guys, this is "just right".  Thank you for a very simple, adaptable recipe.

Not to terrible but it was rather bland. I made as is next time I will make these changes:

Salt the eggplant slices before breading. do an equal parts parm / italian bread crumb mixture. I will roast garlic until soft enough to form a paste and lightly spread on top before adding a dab of red sauce and mozzarella cheese. It's less easy I know but with really improve the taste.

This came out great!  We used out home grown Japanese eggplant about 9 varying sizes.  I took off some of the skin and used only 2 eggs.  Also used seasoned Italian breadcrumbs.

This was very good.  I did add almost all of the packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix into my egg to add a little flavor.  I also used salt and pepper on my eggplant prior to dipping in the egg.

Good stuff!  We needed a quick vegetable with chicken and risotto and this was the hot tip. The only change was we used olive oil instead of canola and added some granulated garlic and white pepper to the eggs. Great recipe, thank you.

I sort of turned this recipe into Eggplant parmesan. Instead of using 2 cups bread crumbs I used 1 cup parmesan cheese and 1 cup italian seasoned bread crumbs, or just add italian spices (basil, oregeno, parsley) as well as about 1 tsp salt and pepper each. I served with a little spagetti sauce on top w/ parm cheese. YUM!!

maybe eggplant's just not my thing.  I had this with LOTS of spaghetti sauce, and it was palatable but not great.  
p.s.  I was attempting to induce labor, which did NOT work.  :oP

I made this with my 14 year old. We added italian seasoning, salt, pepper and garlic powder to the dry ingredients. I double coated each slice before frying, and since the rest of the family was running late for dinner,  we put the fried slices in a baking pan, sprinkled them with mozzarella cheese and put them in the oven on "warm". We served them with spaghetti and marinara.  One eggplant goes a long way. There are 4 of us, but we could have served 6-8 easily!

This was good, but I would recommend adding some seasonings to the breadcrumbs. I added a few shakes of garlic & onion powder, and a pinch of salt & pepper to the breadcrumbs, which was already seasoned panko. I only used enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan so that the eggplant wouldn’t get too soggy, but I ended up having to add more oil between flips for each batch, which did become a little frustrating. Overall it’s a good recipe if you’re like me and haven’t made eggplant before. I may consider baking in the oven next time.

This recipe was incredible! I did make a few adjustments. I seasoned my eggplant with Garlic and onion powder, tumeric, paprika, salt, and pepper before I did the oil and bread crumbs! And I made a marinara sauce too. I could literally eat this every day!

Easy and tasty.  I let the eggplant sweat for about 40 minutes, made sure use paper towels to pat dry.  Added some freshly grated parmesan to the bread crumbs for more flavor.  Will make again.

Very good with the addition of garlic powder and onion powder, seasoned breadcrumbs and grated parmesan cheese.  Needed substantially more oil to fry, though.  Served with mozzarella cheese to sprinkle on top and Victoria sauce, though they were good plain, too.

I added a bunch more spices: garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, rosemary...... good mix of Italian spices. As per other reviews, I dipped in egg, flour, egg, bread crumbs.  Then baked it in the oven at 400 for 15 minutes SO much easier than frying separately.  It had a nice browned crisp topping.  Next time melted cheese and tomato sauce would be great.

My family and I really enjoyed this and I will definitely make again! For the dry crumb mixture I added equal parts Panko and Italian seasoned bread crumbs then added about 1/4 C powdered Parmesan, 3/4 tsp garlic salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. Fried on each side approx. 2 and a half to 3 minutes:)
This was such a treat!!!  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

As written this is a one star recipe and that's being generous. It is extremely bland as there are no spices and is made worse by using plain bread crumbs. No flavor at all! Another problem is the amount of oil specified in the ingredients list. Two tablespoons of oil is not even close to the amount needed to fry a whole eggplant. This is definitely not a good one.

You must use a bit more oil for an entire eggplant.  I added italian pasta spice mix and salt.  That still wasn't enough flavour for me so I minced a clove of garlic and mixed it into the bread crumbs.

My kid LOVED this. She devoured these tasty rounds. 
My only two cents: fry in little oil and be patient. Let them turn golden and almost crispy.  Great find.

In my version of this recipe, I salt the eggplant lightly first and then add ground pepper to the bread crumbs.  I will sometimes also add garlic powder.  We eat it with a little soy sauce (shoyu) and it's delicious!

This is a family favorite. I like it plain. My husband adds all kinds of things - sauce, cheese,  diced tomatoes.  You can put it out with "toppings" and it almost becomes like an Italian Taco!  Have made it many times. I added a little salt and pepper to the eggs.

I substituted olive oil for the canola; also with eggplant 2 tablespoons is insufficient. I also used Italian panko breadcrumbs in place of plain breadcrumbs. Recipe was a good starting point but definitely needed tweaking.

I don't like eggplant but my husband loves it so i decided to make this in hopes that I would enjoy it to. This was a huge hit for both of us.  Very Easy and simple to do.

I shaved off the skin, used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and then threw salt on it when they were done.

It was yummy. I used panko bread crumbs that I ground up with some parmesan to dip the eggplant in.  
The eggplant did not soak up a lot of oil which is a good thing.

This was so easy to make.  I used drakes mix because i had it on hand and it was easier than making bread crumbs.    The eggplant was  delicious and easy to make.  We liked it with the suggested ranch dressing dipping sauce.  The leftovers easily reheated for 10 minurtes at 350 and we’re used for fried eggplant sandwiches.

Im not sure why this has so many stars when everyone is making changes to the recipe because it is bland. This lacks seasoning and is very basic. Also, there’s no way to fry a whole eggplant with so little oil.

My Grandmother used to make this and it was my favorite. I've been making it now for about 35 years. I follow my Grandmother's instructions to keep them from being bitter and then vary the breading to whatever I feel like. I've used plain, Italian, Vigo cheese breadcrumbs and Panko (a very crunchy, really fun twist).  The most important step is after you slice the eggplant (personally I like mine peeled), place it on plates with paper towels. Salt both sides and let it sit for 30 minutes.  Pat dry.  This draws out any bitterness. Now dip in beaten egg, coat in breading and fry in skillet until golden brown. Delicious!

Four stars is really a rating of the original recipe + review suggestions.  Huge oversight not to include the "sweating" step.   I made the following  adjustments based on previous reviews.  Added Italian seasoning to Panko breadcrumbs as I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs.  For one small eggplant used only 2 eggs (plenty left over) 3/4 cup breadcrumbs (plenty left over) and about 3/4 cup all purpose flour (plenty left over).  Added black pepper to egg;  garlic powder and Lawrey's seasoned salt to flour.  Fried one batch dipping first in egg then flour then breadcrumbs.  Fried second batch dipping first in flour then egg then breadcrumbs.  The difference was that  dipping in the flour before the egg resulted in the more breadcrumbs adhering to the eggplant which made them crispier.  I preferred dipping in the egg before the flour because there were less breadcrumbs which showcased the eggplant more.  Both were good, it's just a matter of preference.  I used grape seed oil and  did not have a problem with the eggplant being excessively oily.  Liked it, but won't make it that often - however when I do, the only change will be to go heavier on the seasoning.  Good basic recipe which allows customization to meet your personal tastes.

Simple and good.  Use flavored breadcrumbs and you'll need more oil for frying.  I'll make this again.

I've never made egg plant before but this appears to be a good base recipe although I did use many of the tips from others - used spices and double egg dipped using both breadcrumbs and flour (whole wheat) and baked in the oven instead of frying. I didn't know what to expect but it tasted great. I will definitely make this again.

These were pretty good, but needed much more oil than the recipe called for. I used olive oil. I would recommend using some spices in the bread crumbs, since the finished product was a touch bland.

I didn't use the bread crumbs.  I used a mixture of cornmeal and flour (1 cornmeal and 2 flours), dipped my eggplant slices in that, and then in the beaten egg.  I seasoned the slices prior to dipping.  And then cooke, adding as much oil as necessary.  It came out yummy

Yes I made changes to the recipe. 

 I did not peal the eggplant. 
 I made thin slices of the eggplant. 
 I dipped them in flour that I  had added salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and Parmesan cheese too,.
I then dipped them in panko.,
I fried them  in a small amount of peanut oil for approx,. 3 minutes.
I salted them ........so good.......

My dad would put the slices in cold salted water.  I did so overnight and drained on a towel;  dip slices in beaten egg then coat in Italian Seasoned Panko bread crumbs mixed with Parmesan Cheese.  Put the Panko in waxed paper and use a rolling pin to make the Panko finer.  Fry slowly until golden and keep warm in a very low oven.  Enjoy with ketchup.   Make scambled eggs with unused egg.  This was good & crunchy.

Great recipe for a quick, easy way to make eggplant! Although I did have to add more oil as they cooked and would cut down both the eggs and breadcrumbs next time, the end result was great served with cheese and tomato on top!

Put about 1" of oil in a heavy fry pan. You can add some garlic powder or onion powder to the bread crumbs. I use Panko crumbs when I do something like this. Also when you take the egg plant out of the oil, salt with a coarse salt, and a little pepper.I love egg plant!

It enhances the flavor of the eggplant if you cut it and let it "soak" in a bath of salted water ahead of time. I usually change the water after 30 min. Continue the bath for another 30 and dry on paper towels. Try it!

Eggplant is one of my favorite veggies.  I fry mine but would like to try a good receipt for baking. Frankies' restaurant here has a good one but won't share, so I order it every time we go. I only use salt and black pepper but will try the onion and garlic tonight.

I have been frying eggplant like this for years except that I use Italian bread crumbs.  Otherwise, it is quite bland. Also, 2 tbs oil is not enough as breaded eggplant tends to soak up the oil.

I had half an eggplant left to make this recipe.  I thought it was good, but DH didn't care for it, at all.  I think I would have liked it better if I had marinara to dip it in.  Served it with 'Grandma's Best Ever Sour Cream Lasagna' and 'Open Face Mozzarella Sandwich' both recipe from AR.

Loved it! My husband is not an eggplant lover but he couldn't stop eating this. 
My only change was I added Creole Season for a bit of spice and cooked in coconut oil.

Just tried these... quite tasty. A careful reminder, keep them on low to medium heat. This keeps the bread crumb mixture from getting too dark. I made one adjustment, and added crushed Saltine crackers to the bread crumb and parmesan. We had them laying around so I wanted to use them up. Worked well. Be careful also not to let them get too greasy. Take them out as soon as they are done because the eggplant will soak up the grease.

I agree with the title of this recipe. It is indeed very easy. Fried in olive oil and added a little seasoning (lawrys like another reviewer suggested) and absolutely delicious. I am making eggplant parmesean with this but I snuck a tast of one before putting the casserole together. This could indeed be a stand alone dish. Oh also, I used panko which is always my go to bread crumb

I finished frying a large eggplant.  I found that I had to keep adding more oil after each batch and I have a large 12" frying skillet. I also added seasonings and parsley to the bread crumbs.  Loved it.

No I haven't tried these or this recipe yet but plan on buying eggplant next time at the grocery store.  I have always been afraid to fry the eggplant since my last disaster.  The eggplant came out too soggy with oil.  Thank you for this recipe and everyone's comments.

Very simple and tastey. I made as written. I used this recipe when I cooked spaghetti and it went perfect together. I did like dipping it in my spaghetti sauce.

Great recipe.  I used Italian bread crumbs and olive oil cooking spray; then used the fried eggplant in roasted eggplant parmesan.  Big hit with family vegans and nonvegans.

Excellent!  Grew up on eggplant this way. My girls love it. Dipped it in leftover Marinara Sauce from this site. Thanks!

I was not impressed.  I used italian bread crumbs and the eggplant had no flavor.  I am giving it three stars because maybe my eggplant was not ripe or something.  They did come out crispy brown.  Try it for yourself and see if you like it.  I will not be making it again.

This was a great recipe. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead though. Even my picky son loved these. I will use this one all the time now.

Great and simple to make. I suggest soaking the eggplant in the egg batter completely, before dipping in bread crumbs. Mixed 1/2-1cup (depending on how much your making) in with the bread crumbs, then dipped.

I used italian bread crumbs because that's what I had. You have to add more oil as you go otherwise the eggplant will burn very quickly. I found I like the eggplant in thinner slices and more soft than crunchy. I will try these again in the future.

This was very good but I would definately use some kind of seasoned bread crumbs.  Worked well with Japanese eggplants too!

I know that several people have rated this recipe highly.  Just to add a different opinion, I did not find this recipe particularly tasty.  I love the taste of eggplant, but thought the oil covered the taste too much.  Too greasy.  The texture, however, was nice.  Add spices if you try it.
