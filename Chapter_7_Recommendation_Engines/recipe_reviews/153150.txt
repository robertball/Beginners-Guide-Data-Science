This doesn't taste like chocolate, hazelnut or raspberry.  A little bit of  Chambord is nice.  A little bit of Frangelico is nice.  And chocolate liqueur is great in a Chocolate Martini. All three of these together is not nice.  This tasted kind of like berry flavored syrup.

Very good, although i had to make some modifications due to ingredient restrictions.  I didn't have any frangelico, and I added chocolate syrup instead of chocolate shavings.  Very tasty, but I need to watch out considering there isn't much in here besides alcohol.
