This soup is delicious!  I love to make soup, and my husband always greets them with a bit of a groan.  This soup put the biggest grin on his face for a very long time. His exact words were "this is so....wierd, but great!"  
I made this in a vegetarian version, with 3C vegetable broth, no ham, apple cider vinegar, cumin, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes.    I served it with a spoon full of sour cream.  It smelled like thanksgiving while it was cooking.  excellent, and even better the next day!

I bought a larger can of pumpkin than I needed, so I was looking for a good recipe to use the remainder of the can.  This was as easy as could be.  Didn't have sherry vinegar so followed others suggestions and used apple cider vinegar.  It was a little strong, so I'd bring that down to 2.5 T.  I used a can diced tomatoes with green chiles for flavor and added the cumin and coriander suggested by others.  I think I would puree only one can of the black beans and put in two cans whole, but that's personal preference, I like soup a little chunky.  Skipped the ham (didn't want the additional sodium) and did add a dollop of fat free sour cream that I'd mixed with fresh chives first from baked potatoes the night before.  It wasn't mentioned in the directions, but once all the ingredients are in the pot, bring to a boil and then reduce to a med/low simmer for the balance of the cooking time, rather than straight medium the entire time.  Nice recipe, thanks for sharing!

This was excellent!  The pumpkin is very subtle, but good.  I added cider vinegar because I didn't have sherry vinegar and it was very good.  I ate for lunch for two days in row after and it is very good as leftovers.  Great for my low calorie high fiber diet.

Mmmmm...this soup was very tasty with a few alterations.  I used home made black beans, fresh tomatoes, extra garlic & onion, and added 1tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp cayenne, bay leaf, and used apple cider vinegar instead of sherry.  I didn't use all of the broth either; we like our soups thicker.  Definitely a keeper!

The reviewer that mentioned the appearance of this soup was not kidding.  It is not pretty.  But is is a very hearty and inexpensive soup that served as a great work week lunch for me.  I skipped the ham, used vegetable broth and apple cider vinegar.  I also used fresh beans.  the pumpkin is VERY subtle.  I would suggest reducing the amount of beans if you want to highlight the pumpkin more.

This is a decent base recipe, but it needs a lot of help to become something good. I would recommend the Jamaican Black Bean Chili if you want a well rounded recipe to work with. (It is the only other recipe on this site that combines pumpkin and black beans.)

This was excellent the first day and even better as leftovers.  The ham adds nothing.  I think it would be fine without any meat at all; if I were to add meat again next time, I would try some shredded beef.

As a vegetarian I am always on the look out for new recipes with beans, this one is fabulous and so cheap. I use dried beans, and if anyone is interested - a 1 pound bag of dry black beans yields 6 cups of cooked beans. A can of beans is roughly 2 cups, so a 1 pound bag is exactly what you need for this recipe. I cook the beans using the gas free method (http://www.recipezaar.com/Basic-Dried-Beans-49960) then use a little water when pureeing as they tend to be a little drier than the canned version. I also use vegetable broth and add 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1 tsp cumin. Delicious, thanks!

I enjoyed this recipe - I have to admit half way through it I started thinking to myself that this must be a joke. Pumpkin, black beans and beef broth?  Who would have thought?  I didn't use the ham and I think that would have helped the overall flavor - I did add some green chiles to the black bean and tomato mixture.  I will listen to some of the other reviewers and add some cumin and coriander next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delish!  pureed some jalapenos with the black beans for a little spice.  I was worried b/c my husband doesn't care for pumpkin/squash flavors but it is so subtle he really liked it.

What a lovely soup!  I grew a lot of black beans this year, and was searching this site for a good recipe.  I probably wouldn't have tried this one, because of the heavy reliance on canned products...but I happened to have grown a lot of winter squash this year, so I tried it.  I wouldn't ever have thought of the combination, and it's very good.  I'll bet it's even better with pumpkin.  I did add cumin and coriander.  I'll be sure to grow more black beans and some pumpkin next year, and eat this soup all through the late fall.

This soup was delicious and perfect for a cold, winter's night.  I did make a few changes, just based on what my family prefers.  I cut the onion down significantly, only using about 1/4 cup diced (since I added everything to my slow cooker, I was able to skip the butter part:).  I also didn't use the ham at all, used vegetable broth, and added corn, making this a vegetarian meal. I made this really easy on myself, putting everything in my crock pot and cooking it on low for about 6 hours.  Everyone really loved it and I plan on making it again.

Delish! I recommend cutting down the liquid to 3 cups of broth (chicken broth worked great), 2 T. cider vinegar, and 1/2 t. cumin. Don't need 1/4 c. butter to brown the onions and garlic, I used 1 T. butter and 1 T. olive oil to make it healthier. No need to add salt either, there is enough in the broth and canned stuff. Great recipe!

This is a fabulous recipe. I use less butter and regular vinegar and it still turns out delicious. Add just a little less vinegar if you're going to use the regular kind because it can be a little too strong.

Needing a recipe for which I had all ingredients on hand, I snapped this one up right away. Unfortunately, it's one of those that lacks "oomph" when you follow directions to a T, but definitely warrants an upgrade with a few simple seasonings. After discovering that most of the raves came from cooks who doctored the recipe, I wanted to see how it came out as intended. Meh. It was bland and a bit too vinegary -- somewhere in the order of 2.5 stars. The addition of 1 tsp. each cumin and chili powder, plus letting it sit several hours before serving, helped bunches. And next time I'll only use 2 Tbsp. of vinegar. Thus doctored, I'd elevate it to a 3.5. I'm eating leftovers as I type, and it's even better a few days later, as it has thickened up nicely. I'd make it again--it's a good wintery soup. But it's not getting 5 stars from me. I save that for recipes I adore.

I made it vegetarian by substituting vegetable broth and eliminating the ham. Also, I pureed the beans with the broth and left the tomatoes in chunks and added corn (this made it look more appetizing as well). I added cumin and coriander as well. Delicious!

Oh my goodness! This is my new favorite! My whole family raved at how yummy this was, even my 14 year old son said it is now his favorite! I won't know if it tastes better the following day, there is none left.  I used apple cider vinegar as many suggested.  I also used deli ham that I cut up and sauteed and added cilantro before serving.  I also used tomatoes with jalepenos and added about 1/4 tsp of garlic-chili paste. What a healthy and yummy dish!

Fabulous!  This recipe gave me the opportunity to try out my new immersion blender which allowed me to puree the beans right in the soup pot :-)  I made the following modifications to the recipe: Used a can of "Zesty Chili Style" diced tomatoes for some added kick; 2 chicken boullion cubes and 2 beef boullion cubes to make the broth; 2 Tblsp. cider vinegar; 1/4 tsp. baking soda (to lessen the acidity of the tomatoes and vinegar); and 1/2 tsp. of Penzey's new spice blend called "Forward".

I was excited to try this but it did not work for me. I found it too be earthy and bland. I even added cumin, coriander and tomatoes with chile peppers as suggested.

Great Soup! I love pumpkin and this was a great way to incorporate in into other dishes. I didn't add the ham or the sherry vinegar and I substituted vegetable broth instead of the beef. I only used 2 cups of broth to make it thicker. So Good!

DELICIOUS!!!  The more you let it sit after making it the thickness slowly develops into this tasty soup with a hint of "something" that people would never guess its the pumpkin.  Also, I didn't use sherry wine but instead I used a 1 tsp of rice vinegar and it came out just fine!!!

Changes based on what I had on hand:  Rotel in place of diced tomatoes, cider vinegar for sherry vinegar (1/2), chicken broth, and no ham.  The soup was very bland so I simmered it down for *2 hours* and it came out wonderful.  Will definitely use the Rotel again - gave it a nice kick. Update:  giving this recipe 5 stars because it became so addictive, I can't wait to make this again!

This is so good. But, I am the only one in my house who enjoys soup. So, I freeze the leftovers in silicone muffin trays.  I put the frozen cubes (shaped like a hockey puck) in a large freezer bag. Then I can take 2-3 cubes/pucks to work for lunch.

My husband and I both really liked this soup.  Mine did turn out darker than in the picture but the taste made up for it.  I followed another reviewers advise and added 1 1/2 tbs cumin, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I also added 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning.  All I had was white vinegar, I thought it might be to strong so I skipped entirely.  This was even better the next day.  My husband is still talking about it 3 days later.  I will make this again.

This was very good though I did change the recipe quite a bit based on other reviews in order to give it more flavor.  I pureed only 2 cans of black beans and left the third whole.  I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes only 3 C broth and a 28 oz can of pumpkin.  I also added cayenne, cumin, ground coriander and turmeric.  This was much better the second day

Great, unusual recipe.  Get down to basics with pure pumpkin, black beans and such.  Most definately needs the cumin, cayenne, and bay leaf.  The red pepper might have been too hot for my light weight family.  Did have the sherry vinager which does add a snap of flavor.  Sour cream adds the finishing touch.  Perfect Halloween night dinner in front of the tv watching football!

I thought this soup was pretty good but needed a little help. I added 1 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. coriander and a healthy shot of mango hot sauce. I had some leftover black japonica rice from a previous meal and threw that in, which thickened it up a bit. Made a great meal along side a grilled cheese sandwich.

I liked this soup. I added sweet corn and used bacon instead of ham. Used cider vinegar because that was all I had. I thought the vinegar taste was a little strong, I may add less next time.

I've made this recipe twice and am astounded by the ease and the rich flavor in short order! I used pumpkin that I grew and it just happened to taste more like buttercup squash but great in this recipe!

I did make slight modifications... first time I followed recipe but used a dash of EVOO instead of butter and left out the ham. Today, again EVOO instead of butter and no ham and I didn't bother to drain the beans (makes it even richer), used extra pumpkin, onion and garlic and replaced beef broth with veggie broth. great for vegetarian or vegans!

This was a great soup. I couldn't find the attachments to our blender or food processor, so I mashed the bean and tomatoes with a potato masher, and it still turned out great. Thanks.

Love it! I added alot more pumpkin than the recipe called for (used fresh pumpkins which were roasted and pureed). I also added alot of spices: cumin, chili powder, garlic. Don't forget the vinegar, its just not quite right without it. Topped with cilantro and sour cream. Served with cornbread. Delish!

My family loves this soup!  We have taken it to family parties, potlucks and plan on it for our New Year party.  Everyone loves it and I have given out the recipe to numerous people.  Did as other reviewers suggested and only pureed one can of beans to make it thicker.

Loved this soup! I was a bit skeptical, but it came out great, and my husband said it his new favorite. Asked me to make it again! A few tips. I used a hand immersion blender to puree the beans and tomatoes. I like to avoid the extra appliance if I can and this worked out fine. I didn't have 3 cans of black beans so I used a can of pinto beans to replace one can of black beans and it came out great. I also took the recommendation of other reviewers and added a touch of cumin and used canned tomatoes with chiles (because I had it on hand). Served with sour cream and this was excellent. Thank you for sharing.

This is a delicious and flavorful soup. I am a vegetarian so I substituted veggie broth and soy bratwurst. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of the sherry. I have also added corn from time to time and enjoyed the added texture. This is one of my favorite soups. I highly recommend it!

Used one large 24.5 oz. can of black beans for the puree and one 14.5 oz. can of diced, no salt added, tomatoes and leftover stewed tomatoes in the fridge to make the 16 oz. When added to the blender, it was too thick to puree so I slowly added one cup of chicken broth; it worked; the puree was smooth. I used 1/4 c. margarine but next time I will use the margarine/oil combination mentioned by others; you don't need 1/4 cup. Since I used fresh pumpkin, I only needed a total of 2 cups of chicken broth and one cup of water. Next time, I will use only two cups of chicken broth for a thicker soup. I omitted the ham; didn't have on hand and used apple cider vinegar in lieu of the sherry vinegar (same reason). I also added 1 teaspoon of cumin. Very filling but not pretty.

Good start as a base that needs zapping up, so I only gave a 4. I used three cans of black beans and 2 cans of pumpkin. Used chicken stock and only 2 cups, at that. Instead of tomatoes, I used about 1/2 cup of Rogan Josh sauce by Pataks and about a teaspoon of Slap yo Mama seasoning and a quarter cup of sherry (not cooking sherry!). I had no ham, so added a few slices of thick cut bacon while it cooked and removed them before serving and chopped some fresh celantro to sprinkle on top. The soup was a hit!

I double the ham and onions and added the ham at the beginning. As a result, I definitely tasted the ham unlike some others - like a black bean ham and beans!  Added some cumin and slap your mama spice for a bit more flavor!  I thought it was delish!

This is by far the best soup ever!  Even my husband (who doesn't really like soup) said that the recipe was a keeper.  I ran out of sherry vinegar so I substituted it for 1/4 of Sherry and I only had chicken broth in the house so I used it.  It was fantastic!

I really enjoyed this. Even my husband who at first had turned up his nose at it, enjoyed it. I did add frozen corn and and extra can of diced tomatoes to it.Also, I used regular sherry in it, not the vinegar version.  Of course, I topped it with sour cream and cilantro. It was fantastic. If I made a vegetarian version, I would serve it as a first course at a dinner party it was that good.

My 9-year-old daughter, who is pretty picky when it comes to soups, called this the "best soup I've ever had." Everyone raved about it. I didn't add the ham as I have vegetarians in my family, and I used just a couple of teaspoons of rice vinegar instead of sherry vinegar, because that was what I had on hand. I used fresh pumpkin from my father-in-law's garden and canned black beans and canned tomatoes, and used beef bouillon instead of canned beef broth. Very, very good. My 14-year-old son wanted me to go out, buy another pumpkin, and make this again tomorrow. 
:-)

I made this recipe almost exactly as written (I didn't have sherry vinegar, so I just added half the measure of red wine). It had a VERY subtle flavor, almost weak. Not enough flavor to carry the soup on its own, but enough to not be bland.

Most of the high reviewers added several pungent spices to the dish that would seriously alter the flavor chemistry. Having made the original, I am in agreement with doctoring the spices a bit. The recipe makes for a great base, but needs to be flavored according to your tastes.

My husband ate all of the leftovers, but I think it was more because he had missed lunch than because he really liked it.

This soup is absolutely delicious with one major variation! Reduce the vinegar to 2 tsps and sub apple cider vinegar for the sherry vinegar (really brings out the pumpkin).  I also made it vegetarian by omitting the ham and substituting vegetable stock.  To make up for the missing flavor I sauteed 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/4 tsp cayenne powder with the onions and garlic, and used chipotle diced tomatoes.  Once everything was combined, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to bring out the pumpkin flavor and WOW!

I changed this recipe a bit but it tasted amazing and got good reviews from my family. I used olive oil instead of butter, vegetable broth instead of beef broth, apple cider vinegar instead of sherry vinegar, and I omitted the ham. To make heartier, I also added some chopped baked redskin potatoes and chopped mushrooms. I also used paprika, cumin, tumeric, and celery salt for seasoning. I didn't add barley, but I think it would also be a great addition to the soup. It was great as leftovers as well.

Wonderful!! Just right on a cool Fall evening:) I made this last night before we went to a Halloween party and my husband just loved it! He said this is so good with almost every bite:) This morning I overheard him talking with his mom on the phone and he told her he was eating a black bean soup "my wife made" and how much he liked it. sure enough there were no left overs for lunch. :) This will be a keeper in my family. I added just a slosh of regular cream to my own bowl, loved it. Hubby likes it as is:)

Surprisingly good! Only used two cans of black beans, didn't drain completely. I did not puree any of the ingredients. Added chopped celery and carrots, sauteed with the onions. Used veggie broth & 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar. I really want to try this with 3 tbsp red wine vinegar next time. No need for salt - so many of the ingredients have it added already! Hubby garnished w/ tabasco, I sprinkled a little "Frank's Red Hot".

Very good and unique soup.  I'm glad I was curious enough to try it, because I really liked it -for flavor, for how easy it was to make, and for all the healthy stuff in it.  I didn't have sherry vinegar on hand, so I used cider vinegar instead.  If anything, I might add a little less vinegar next time.  It wasn't an unpleasant flavor, but it did seem a little too strong.  I used butter like the recipe calls for (mmm...butter), but next time I'll try olive oil to make it even healthier.

Yummy!  Nice contrast of flavors.. I left half the beans whole for texture, used salsa in place of tomatoes because that's what I had on hand, and because I'm vegetarian I used vegetable broth and left out the ham.  Very easy, very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is delicious! Skipped the onion. Used a can of "black beans with chiles and lime" along with 2 cans regular beans. The jalapeno gave it just the right amount of kick. This is a new house favorite, look forward to making again and again. Oh, and I did not add the salt, this soup was salty enough without.

This soup takes remarkably like baked beans.  If I wanted baked beans (and I didn't) I would have bought a can rather than getting my food processor dirty.  Very disappointing!  This is the first time I have disliked something that contains black beans.

i was a bit concerned about this soup... but i shouldn't have been!  It was delicious.  I sauted the ham with the onion and garlic.  it really brought out the ham flavor.  I didn't blend the tomatoes and beans as directed...instead i used a potato masher while it was cooking and mashed it up a bit. i also added cumin and cayenne pepper.  It was super easy and very good.

I made this pretty much as stated but used dried black beans, omitted ham to lower sodium and added cumin and chili powder and it was very good.  I also added corn, since it appears to be in the picture and seemed a good addition, which it was!

I love his soup. I made a few additions. I sauteed a combination of onions, celery and green pepper instead of just onions. I left them a bit al dente. I added cumin, and a sliced jalapeno. Also added some fresh corn that I put in at the end. SO GOOD! Next time I am going to do pancetta.

This soup was hearty and filling but does need some herbs to liven it up a bit.

Very yummy.  You wouldn't know there was pumpkin in there unless someone told you.  I skipped the upfront blending and instead used my immersion blender for a bit right in the pot before adding the ham.  Chopped the ham very finely, so the kids couldn't really eat around it.  Stirred in some sour cream at the end and added a dollop on each bowl along with shredded cheddar.

So good! But it definitely needs a little doctoring up; I added an extra can of whole black beans and a can of corn. I also added cumin, 2 jalapenos, cayenne, garlic salt and garlic powder. Also the tomatoes I added were "red pepper tomatoes". Delish!!!!

Really good.  Made as-is except substituted apple cider vinegar for the sherry vinegar.  Was a teeny bit too strong, may only put in 2 T next time if I do apple cider.

Such a great soup!  I used dried black beans (6 C when cooked), 2C diced fresh tomatoes, 2C chicken broth + 2 C water, 2C fresh mashed pumpkin.  I also added 2T cumin, 1/2 teaspoons each nutmeg & cinnamon.  And squeezed fresh lime on it just before eating- topped with cilantro & unsweetened kefir yogurt... YUMMY!  I left out the sherry vinegar & ham because we didn't have.  SOOOO good!

I followed the recipe to the I and the T and was extremely disappointed. The texture and color turned out to be that of pureed brown sledge. I'm sorry. I gave it "soup" the day that was recommended when it would even taste better, yet I felt even worse that I had spent resources on this recipe. :(

Followed the recipe as written the best I could while being vegetarian. Vegetable broth instead of beef, and no ham. EXCELLENT!! Thank you for submitting such a great recipe with healthy ingredients. Easy to use home grown veggies instead too.

This soup was awesome! So easy to make and very filling. I didn't have any black beans, so I used one can of kidney beans and a 30 oz. can of pintos. I pureed the kidney beans but kept all of the pintos whole. I also added 1 t. ground cumin and left out the salt. Oh, and I added a few dashes of cayenne. So yummy! I can't wait to eat leftovers.

This is one of my favorite recipes, I'm so glad I found it.  It is a hearty, satisfying fall/winter soup.  Even if you're a little turned off by the word 'pumpkin' and 'soup' in the same sentence, give it a try.  The pumpkin is not overpowering, and the way it blends with the black beans is really delicious.  My husband was skeptical when I told him what I was making, then as he was eating he couldn't stop saying how good it was.

My husband loved this soup.  I thought it was good but didn't enjoy the sweet/tangy aspect of the vinegar.  I think next time I will either omit the vinegar or just put in 1 T instead of 3.  I also would like to put in some cumin next time.

Wow! I figured this soup would be good, but not THIS good! I did things a bit differently, but it came out delicious. I used 2 cans of black beans, pureed, and only 2 cups of broth. What I got was a thick soup that's perfect for fall and wintertime. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I thought this was really good, but wish I had stopped at 2 cans of beans.  I think the 3rd can obscured the pumpkin flavor a little too much.  I used some venison sausage instead of ham, omitted the vinegar, and added a little chili powder and allspice.  My husband loved it!

Wow.  Talk about FILLING and low calorie all in one recipe.  I cut back a little on the butter and left out the ham but added some plain greek yogurt in the end.  I added a tiny bit of blue cheese in mine and some sharp cheddar for the hubby and kids.  I also used all fresh ingredients instead of canned (roasted pumpkin, black beans, and tomatoes).  The kids added some toasted pumpkin seeds.  I added some cumin.  We all liked it.

With amendments, this soup was both surprising and amazing! I added both cumin and garam masala, two ingredients that I never make black beans without! I also increased (nearly doubled) the pumpkin, because I love pumpkin. Lastly, because I'm a carnivore, I fried chunks of beef before making this and added them to the stew - hearty and very yummy! This was a perfect way to use my leftover cans of pumpkin from the holidays!

Followed recipe to the T...Flavor was delicious ...my husband was in love and went back for seconds (unusual).   Next time I'll reduce a can of broth as it was a little thinner than I would have liked.  But the flavor?  YUM!

I have already made this soup twice, it is so good. The only change I made the second time I made it, was that I only used 1T of apple cider vinegar. And I didn't drain the beans. This is a simple one-pot dinner for cold nights. Thank you!

This was outstanding!  I only used 1 can of black beans & blended it with 2 small cans of "Embasa medium Salsa Mexicana" for the puree blend.  I didn't add onions, garlic, etc....the salsa mexicana gave it enough kick.  I added a can of garbonzo beans for some added texture.  Enjoy! :)

Excellent cold-weather meal. It has a mild, crowd-pleasing flavor and can be adjusted easily. I use apple cider vinegar and skip the ham. I've found that homemade turkey broth adds a nice flavor to the soup.

One of the 3-star reviews commented that every 4- or 5-star reviewer did not make this soup as written but doctored it significantly with various herbs and add-ins.   So I was kind of scared to make the soup straight up, not knowing what to expect, but I'm glad I forged ahead.  You'll be happy to know that we all enjoyed this soup, and I made it as true to the recipe as I could.   I did make the following changes (don't groan... I promise, I didn't mess with it much!):  olive oil and canola oil subbed for the butter to make it vegan; powdered beef broth, ditto.  Left out the ham (not kosher!) and used homemade frozen pumpkin instead of canned, and apple cider vinegar as others have done. I hope the cynics won't see that as too many changes!  We definitely got a good sense of what this delicious fall soup is all about without a lot of hassle.  With these changes, it becomes a quick and filling vegan AND kosher soup.   Thanks for sharing the recipe!

It drives me crazy to see people give a recipe 5 stars, only with adjustments that make it very different. This means if someone makes it to recipe, they are getting something totally different than what you've actually eaten. 3 stars to the original recipe, and 5 to the adjustment recipe. I've made it to recipe and with adjustments, and to recipe was just not great. Adjustments: Used green onions and less butter to start. Need either less broth or more beans, as 4 cups to 3 cans = watery mess. Used diced tomatoes with green peppers, substituted veg broth for beef, and omitted the ham. Used apple cider vinegar instead of sherry. These adjustments made for a terrific soup. I'm sorry to say, the original just wouldn't cut it in my kitchen.

Don't think you can subvert the directions and make this in a crockpot, as it never thickens!  Quite tasty, though, after I transferred it to a pot.

This soup is phenomenal!  Truly addicting!  I somehow totally forgot to add the tomatoes, so I'll try that next time.  I didn't add ham and used red wine vinegar since that's what I had on hand.  It definitely needed the help of some crushed red peppers and I added a touch of curry.  The sour cream on top was just what it needed to complete this soup.  Definitely is going to be a staple in my house!

This is a great base recipe, but as written, I probably would have given the recipe 3 stars.  I made the soup and there was just something . . . . missing.  Although other reviewers mentioned adding cumin and cayenne, I wanted to emphasize the pumpkin (which is VERY subtle) instead of the black beans.  I borrowed from a Bon Appetite pumpkin soup recipe and added:  2 Tbsp sugar, 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg, cinnamon, corriander and sage, and 1/4 tsp. of allspice and curry.  I then brought it to a boil and turned it low, low (below simmering) for about an hour to let the flavors meld.  Wow. Complex, interesting soup.  Loved it.  Wouldn't recommend adding all the spices if you have little ones, but for a more adventuresome palate the modifications are tasty.

I thought this soup was pretty good, but after tasting, I did need to add more flavor. I did so by putting a shakes of Mrs. Dash's Soutwestern seasoning in it. That gave it the needed boast. It was more soupy than we like, so next time I will use less broth and maybe add some corn to it. Will make again. As many have said, the pumpkin taste doesn't come through, so don't be afraid to try this very different combination.

I loved this but had to add a bit of New Mexico's Hatch Green Chilies to spice it up a bit. I also added a dash of Louisiana Hot Sauce. I pressure cooked the beans and had wonderful ham to add. I also added lots of cut up tomatoes from my freezer as I had a bumper crop of tomatoes last year. Good hearty, THICK and filling soup. Great for watching weight. Omit the ham for a vegan treat.

Add corn (2 cups, frozen) when you add the pumpkin!! It adds a sweet flavor that deliciously counters the bean's flavor :) the sweet corn pops in your mouth! 

This soup freezes very well, in individual servings-- perfect for when you forget to make a lunch!!

When I told the family what was for dinner - you should have seen the skeptical looks..... then they ate, and they ate, and they ate.  I agree with comment that is also very good reheated the next day.  For my crowd I substituted cut up smoked sausage in lieu of ham because that is what I had, and the smokey added flavor was fabulous.  I highly recommend this one..... very hearty soup.

My husband really liked this soup, and I think I will make it again, just with less vinegar and more non-blended black beans.  With the 3 T of vinegar, that is all I tasted for rest of the night.

I added a pound of cooked chipotle-seasoned pork sausage from HEB and several tablespoons of ground cumin along with a can of tomatoes and green chiles. Really good with a dollop of sour cream.

I was hoping to taste the pumpkin but could not. I used less butter to soften onion/garlic and only pureed 1 1/2 cans of the beans and added the other 1/2 to the whole beans into the soup. I did add a little cumin as I thought the soup was pretty bland. I also added an extra cup of broth.  All in all it was okay but not what I was looking for.

I made it this afternoon and I found it to be quite bland actually - I did switch out the beef broth for chicken and i used pancetta instead of ham. I landed up adding a little more salt, pepper and I added 7.5ml of cumin and chilli powder.  Helped a bit.  I did add frozen corn - in the photo not in the recipe.  Still needs something though.  Oh well.

Very healthy and tasty. I used chicken broth (didn't have beef broth) and omitted the ham.  Also, I would use a little less onion next time.

Good hearty soup, I omitted the ham and used only 2 cans of beans.  I also added cumin and bit of chili spice.  It was good, I wish it was better but I'll work on it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did not puree the beans and I used fresh instead of canned.  Soup needs to sit a day for the flavors to blend.  Nice filling soup.

I'd really give this 4 and 1/2 stars with my modifications. My husband LOVED this soup!!  I used pink beans and chicken broth instead of the black beans and beef broth in the original recipe. Also added more seasoning ( about 3/4 teaspoon Nature's Seasoning---made of mixed spices) and about a teaspoon of Arizona Dreaming, another mixed spice with a southwestern spice taste). Didn't have sherry vinegar so used wine vinegar, like other reviewers. Also omitted the ham, as I didn't want to add the sodium. Definitely will make this soup again!!

Very nice mild full flavour. As former owners of pet pot belly pigs,we no longer eat pork so we left out the ham. I will be making this again and putting it our recipe book.

The outcome is not the colour of the 4th photo... :( For a more accurate view of the dish, refer to the other 3 photos instead. You will notice that the colour isn't very appealing. However, the taste is actually not bad at all - that explains the 4 star. the 5th star was taken away by the strange colour. Also, 1/2 pound of ham is not enough for flavour, we used 1 pound instead. We omitted the sherry vinegar as well as we didn't have it. Finally, we thickened it with flour as it was a little too watery after it was done. Next time, I would not puree the diced tomatoes and might use 2 cans of pumpkin puree to thicken up the soup more.

It's ok as written but isn't a favorite.  The only changes I made at the end were blending everything together because I didn't like the consistency with whole beans.  After tasting I added a couple tablespoons of fat free sour cream; that helped a lot.  I think that if I make this again I'll add half and half or whipping cream to the soup toward the end of cooking.  I may also try it with two cans of pumpkin to see if that is better.  If you are looking for pumpkin flavored soup then this is not the recipe for you; it tastes similar to normal black bean soup. I ended up throwing most of it out.

Hmmm... this was not really the fall meal that I was looking for.  I couldn't taste the pumpkin and it was really bland.  I had to add a ton of extra salt to enhance the flavor, which is something I really don't like to do, and adding some cumin per others' suggestions.  After that it was decent, but I still doubt I'll be making this again anytime soon.

My husband loved this.  To make it a bit more healthy, I used veggie broth instead of beef broth.  I also, as other reviewers suggested, used less broth.  I like a thicker soup.  I also added an extra can of pumpkin puree for more pumpkin flavor.  I did not have any sherry vinegar.  Yummy with a few alterations.

I was very excited about this, but I have to say that this recipe as written is just okay.  I pretty much followed the ingredients/instructions exactly, except that I didn't puree black beans prior to adding them to the pot - I let it all simmer for about 20 minutes and then used my immersion blender briefly so everything wasn't quite whole.  The flavor was a little bland, but also a little too sharp from the vinegar (and I only put 2 T. in!).  I ended up adding another can each of beans and tomatoes to cut the vinegar, and then a bunch of chili powder and cumin (and a dash of cinnamon) to give more flavor depth.  I really liked the idea of the pumpkin in this, but I just don't think the recipe as it is written is great without adding your own touches.  Thanks, but I don't think I will make this particular recipe again.

The soup is definitely unusual and not bad, but I had to come back to the recipe reviews to find suggestions for additional spices.  I initially doubled the pumpkin because I couldn't taste it at all - even though I only used 2 cans of beans.  I'm also  curious how the first photo turned out so orange colored since the other three pix (and my soup) came out a reddish black.  Off to add some cumin!

This is very, very, VERY good.  This is well worth making as it is one of the best soups I have ever made.  I did not add the ham and threw in a bay leaf -- otherwise, I left everything as written and would highly recommend it.

Really disappointed in how this one turned out. Way too watery and bland. Absolutely no pumpkin flavor came through, which is what I was wanting.  I added chipotle, fresh sage, and toasted cumin to up the flavor. Swapped the sherry vinegar for sherry. And then to thicken it, I stirred in 3/4 masa flour. It thickend into a nice bean soup. In the end I added chicken instead of ham because it seemed to go better. It tasted like a chicken enchilada soup so we crumbled in so tortillas and topped with sour cream. My end product was pretty good, but nothing what I thought the soup was supposed to be.

My husband and son loved this.  I just thought it was OK.  But it is still a great option for an easy, healthy, inexpensive dinner.  I think that I used 2 C less broth than was called for since we like thicker soup.  Otherwise, I made as directed.

Great starter.  I didn't use the ham, so I'm sure that would have added some more flavor.  In compensation, I added chili powder and cumin, and a bit of extra garlic.  Worked really well, especially with some cheddar cheese!

Followed the instructions exactly and it was delicious. Even my 5 year old son loved it. Served with the Down Home Maine Pumpkin Bread that is also on this website.

I used apple cider vinegar (2 TBSP) in place of sherry, no ham, & added a tsp of cumin.  I pureed the sauteed onions and garlic with the beans and tomatoes.  Next time, I will only puree one can of the beans so that it is a bit chunkier.  This goes very well with whole wheat couscous; this soup definitely needs a side of rice, couscous, or quinoa to make it feel complete, but I like to have my soups as my meal as opposed to a side or starter.

This a fantastic tasty warm winter soup that is very filling. I add a dash of ground clove, cayanne pepper and tarragon to jazz it up a bit. I was affraid the pumpkin would be overwhelming but the bean puree cancels it out and gives it a nice creamy texture. I've served it with a bit of sour cream or parmesian cheese and both were great complements!

This recipe is heavily dependent on the quality of your beef broth! If it doesn't taste good before you add it to your soup, it certainly won't taste any better after being added, because it's the principal flavor here. The end product was decent, but bland, so I doctored mine up with chili powder, cumin, and hot sauce until I reached the desired flavor profile for my family. Start with a good beef broth, keep your spice cabinet open, and you'll enjoy this soup! :) Thanks for the recipe!

Love this!  Even my husband loved it and he's not much for soup, especially if he knew of the pumpkin in this.  I blended only one can of the black beans with the diced tomatoes and added some ground corriander and cumin like other reviews mentioned.  I had to pass this recipe around after taking it to work for lunch one day!

My whole family loved this soup, even my picky little brother. I decided to go with the vegetarian version of this soup to keep costs down and used apple cider vinegar and tomatoes with diced jalapenos. It tasted great and I'll make it the same way next time. Awesome recipe!

this was deeeeelicious on a chilly fall night when the phillies should have beat the yanks.  added one more can of pumpkin puree and only pureed one can of the black beans.  added some cumin and some parsley and only used one T. of apple vinegar and 2 T. of sherry.  i let it simmer about 2 hrs.  i served it w/the allrecipes basic corn muffins and a light salad.  the lady to whom i served it is known for her cooking.  the next day she called me for both recipes!!!!  her husband and my husband both raved about the meal. i meant for the starts above to be 4 and 1/2.

This was ok.  To be fair, I had to use chicken broth instead of beef and I forgot the vinegar.  Not sure how much of a difference that would've made.  It's a very healthful recipe, so I might tweak it in the future to boost the flavor.  On the plus side, it's very easy and quick to prepare. I will skip the puree step next time to make it even easier.

This gets 4 stars as in and 5 with my minor adjustments. Instead of using butter and ham, do the following: start by cooking up a 1/2 lb of bacon in the soup pan. Remove bacon when done and proceed with the original recipe, cooking the onion/garlic in the bacon grease instead of butter. Crumble up the bacon and when the soup is done, add it back in. It makes an exceptional, restaurant quality soup. I also added a tsp of coriander, a tsp of cumin and a tsp of cayenne as others suggested.

Just ok.. kind of a sour-ish fruity taste (from the pumpkin, I assume) and my husband and I both thought that it needed something.. we did not add the ham, perhaps that would have made the difference.

I really liked this soup, which surprised me a little - I hadn't been sure about it. A couple changes --I didn't have any sherry vinegar so I used a little cider vinegar and a splash of sherry. I used garlic & olive oil canned tomatoes, a little more ham than called for, black pepper & cayenne. I didn't puree 2 cans of beans like it said, but pureed a couple ladlefuls of the soup when it was finished, but before I added the ham. The pumpkin flavor is really subtle, not sweet at all. My brother has been here for the weekend and was not real excited about the soup, thought it sounded too healthy and hippyish, but ended up really liking it. He said, "Tell them I gave it 2 thumbs up." I started to explain the rating system to him and he lost interest pretty quickly, so I decided he gave it 4 stars. Thanks!

I've made this twice and tasters loved it both times. I altered the recipe to make it into more of a chili. Didn't puree anything; used 1/2 the amount of broth the first time and increased simmering time by 30+ mins the second time to thicken it up. Added cumin & coriander as suggested by other users. Omitted ham.

Excellent recipe but because I never seem to follow a recipe exactly here is what I changed...I sauted the garlic, onion, and a jalapeno in some bacon grease and added cumin and fresh cilantro.

Yes, this is an ugly but a goodie. My family enjoyed this! I cooked dried black beans according to directions and used those instead of canned beans. I used about half a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and a small can of tomato sauce. I also added 1/4 teaspoon cumin and used chicken broth instead of beef. I omitted the ham (although I used a bit of bacon when simmering my beans). I didn't puree any of it in the hopes that it would showcase the orange of the pumpkin (and to simplify). It worked at first but by the time it had simmered, the orange color had turned into an ugly brownish color.

Great tasting, easy to make soup that tastes even better the next day. As suggested by other reviewers, I used apple cider vinegar in place of the sherry vinegar since I didn't have that on-hand. I made a batch with vegetable broth and without ham and that was great too. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is really superficial: this is the ugliest soup ever. Puréed black beans and  pumpkin: you do the math. Fortunately this soup has a really wonderful personality.

I didn't really like this soup. I made mine with fresh ingredients instead of canned - so maybe that was why it was bland (doesn't make sense, but I'm trying to come up with a reason). The 2nd day I added much more spices to make it more of a black bean pumpkin chili - chili powder, onions, jalepenos, cumin, corn and more tomatoes and it was very good. Next time I try something like this I will not puree it, I think I would have enjoyed it better with more texture.

This was really good, although I did add a few more spices, as some other reviewers suggested.  I added some coriander and turmeric, which made a different and delicious combination with the ham.  I forgot to add the tomatoes, and didn't puree any of the beans.  Used dried beans that I quick-soaked and cooked, and they were already fairly mushy, so I didn't feel like I needed to puree them.  Served with chopped avocado and sour cream garnish, and corn muffins on the side. Delicious!

It was ok. I liked that it was healthy but I almost gave only 3 stars.  It just tastes like something is missing.  I added extra salt and even a little cayenne to try and get some flavor.  In the end it was the sour cream that saved it enough to get up to 4 stars.  Not sure if we'll make it again.

DH and I fought over the leftovers!  Used diced tomatoes w/basil,garlic oregano.  Also used cider vinegar instead of sherry.  Left the ham out completely.  Swirled with plain yogurt or sour cream, both yummy!

at first i rated it 3 stars b/c you know everyone else liked it so much... but i couldn't even finish it - i dumped the leftovers - therefore it's a two star... but i would be willing to try it again if i made a few variations - for one - i'd use brown beans and more pumpkin b/c i couldn't even taste the pumpkin

I made this again today and I still love it!! Out of necessity, I subbed 2 small sweet potatoes for the pumpkin and polish sausage for the ham.. As usual, I added a bit more seasoning than the original recipe (cumin, turmeric, smoked paprika, and 2 jalapeños, sliced, and a bit of chopped celery, carrots & red bell pepper). I topped each bowl with diced jalapeño, cubed avocado & chopped cilantro. Served it with simple quesadillas. Yum! I love that it’s so adaptable.

I liked it! 
I made a double batch so I would have enough leftovers so my wife and I could have it for lunch through the week. After eating 3 good sized bowls each(it was very good), we still had enough to fill a dozen lunch sized bowls, a 4 cup bowl that I sent with my in-laws the next day and an 8 cup bowl that I ended up freezing! (It about filled my 12 quart stockpot) 

I am going to modify it slightly the next time I make it in just a few weeks. I am going to use 2 cans black and 2 cans cannelinni beans. Blending one of each to lighten the color of the soup base and adding the 2nd can of cannelinis whole into the soup to give even more color contrast and beans. I am also going to use 1 lb of ham, because it just didn't seem like enough. I also had to substitute the sherry vinegar for red wine vinegar, because the store didn't have any. looking up substitutions now, a few sites recommend rice wine vinegar. Mine did have a pretty strong, but still good, vinegar flavor.

I do recommend trying this soup as an interesting alternative to standard bean soup.

It was bland prior to adding chilli flakes, cumin, cajun spices etc. but turned out wonderfully! I used fresh puréed pumpkin and next time would add it to the blender as well.

This soup was awesome! But I did make some changes.. I like chunky soup so I took one can of undrained black beans and puréed with pumpkin puree. Left tomatoes chunky. Also I minced the ham in the blender as well. Used oil instead of butter to sauté. Used onion powder and basil, and I did not have sherry vinegar so I   Used 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp rice vinegar. Turned out so yummy!!!

WOAH! This is good. I omitted the butter and cooked the onion in white wine and beef stock, cutting calories. I used red wine instead of the vinegar. It is so creamy and delicious! I can see how ham would be amazing in this!!!

Very good soup!  Made it for company on a chilly fall day and it was a hit.  After reading the reviews I left out the ham (don't care for ham unless it's spiral cut and covered in brown sugar :) ) and used 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar instead of the sherry vinegar. I liked the subtle apple flavor and the vinegar tang reminded me of my favorite chili recipe.  Also added about 2 oz. of canned green chiles with the tomatoes.  Served with whole wheat rolls and garnished with sour cream.  Will definitely make again.

The idea of this soup is great, but I never actually make it according to the recipe written here. No butter, no ham, no sherry, add apple cider vinegar and liquid smoke... But black bean and pumpkin - can't go wrong.

I used a crock pot and let all the ingredients simmer for about 4 hours on high. IT IS DELICIOUS! I modified some items based on what I had on hand- Rice Wine Vinegar and a Spiral ham bone- and I omitted the extra salt. It is so much better than i expected it to be. The flavors play together well!

pureed 1 can of beans and tomatoes, added some jalepeno peppers and cumin.  Low sodium beans, broth, no added sugar.  My husband wanted me to leave out the pumpkin but I wanted the added fiber so left it in, he still had 2nds so he must have liked it.

Used olive oil to saute' the onions and garlic, used a can of diced tomatoes with mild green chilies, and I used dry Sherry and a little balsamic vinegar.  Added 1 tsp of ground cumin and 1 tsp ground coriander. The beef broth was a low sodium version. Refrigerated the pot overnight, then re-heated the next day.  Soup thickened pretty nicely.  Served with tortilla chips, diced onions, and sour cream.

Wow! I have made this recipe a couple of times.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.   But the second, I added 4 carrots in generous chunks, a cup of frozen organic corn,  an extra can of beans, and 2 chunked scrubbed organic red potatoes with the skins.  I also added 1/4 tsp. cayenne, 1 teaspoon cumin, a few red pepper flakes, and 1 bay leaf.  After adding the ham, it was more like a soup/stew, which we enjoyed because it was so chunky. This recipe is so versatile that you can make additions.

I cut the recipe size down to 3 servings so I put nothing in the blender. This was a great tasting, quick, thick soup that was easy to make and hit the spot on a snowy, cold evening.

DELICIOUS!  Corn is not in the list of ingredients but I saw it in the picture so I added it in.  My husband HATES pumpkin!  Loves to grow them. hate to eat it.  He even liked this soup!  You cannot taste the pumpkin in it. We had it as one of our pre-Thanksgiving meals.  We raise turkeys and had lots of people picking up their turkey and trying this soup.  It was a big hit!

One word - Amazing!!!  Normally I'm not a huge fan of soup, but my husband loves it.  It's getting chilly out so I thought I'd give it a try with our sandwiches the other night.  Oh, my goodness - so GOOD!!  Even my kids ate it and loved it!  Thanks to this recipe, I've been officially converted to a soup eater.  In my opinion, you HAVE to add the ham or the soup would miss the mark.  I thought that it would throw the flavor off, but I was very wrong.  It came out perfect.  I used rice vinegar and added a just a dash of cumino.  We had leftovers so I brought it to friends and family - everyone asked for the recipe.  This soup is even better as leftovers.  Definitely will be keeping this recipe.  Awesome, thanks for sharing.  It's my new favorite go to for chilly fall days!!!

definitely a keeper!  i had my doubts...(pumpkin & black beans?!?)  and never thought in a zillion years my husband would eat it (and he wouldn't have if i told him it included pumpkin), but we both agree, it is DEEELISH!  as written, it is 5 stars, but following the suggestions of others, adding cumin, bay leaf, & corn = 6 stars!  the pumpkin is very subtle. a daring recipe with a nice pay off.

I made according to recipe but left out ham. Tasted and thought it too bland so I added the following spices and it turned out delicious: 
1 tsp Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp Nutmeg, 1/2 tsp brown sugar, 1 tsp Tumeric, 1/2 tsp Cardomom, 1/4 tsp Cloves,two shakes of Cayenne and Voila! Love it!

Loved it!  Used some of the other reviewers suggestions and added 1T cumin, 1/2 cayennne pepper, increased the garlic (we love garlic), omitted the butter and ham, used apple cider vinegar (that's what I had on hand), and reduced the broth to 3 1/4 cups (we like soup a little on the thick side). Simmered the soup for about 35 minutes. I don't think we missed anything by not adding the ham. Was even better the second day for lunch. Delish : )

I made several changes including using vegetable broth, adding vegan taco 'meat' and adding cayanne pepper.  My man does not like the texture of pumpkin pie and won't eat it, but he kept returning to the pot last night.  He used tortilla chips and ate it as a dip. Rave reviews. I will definitely make this one again.

Made it just as ordered. Very good and not too pumpkin-ey for those who are averse to pumpkin-stuff. Will make again!
Oh, btw, does not look like the photo. If they used a photo of actual soup no one would be enticed to make it.

This soup was a big hit with my kids! I gave this 4 stars because I agreed with many of the other reviewers that it needed a little something extra to keep it from being bland.  I pureed just 1 can of the beans (adding some of the broth and juice from the tomatoes to allow it to puree) with 2 cans of beans and the tomatoes kept whole.  It was plenty thick this way - just right!  I also added the corn suggested by others, along with cumin, some ancho chili powder, a dash of cayenne and a healthy dose of dried cilantro.  I also skipped the ham since I didn't think it would need it and wanted to keep it a little healthier (used low sodium beef broth too).  That sounds like a lot, but the base recipe is a really good start, a good canvas to add your personal touches to.  My kids can't wait to make this again - a definite ringing endorsement!

For my version I used vegetable broth. I omitted the ham and was surprised it was still so flavorful. I didn't add any salt, the salt in the canned beans and tomatoes and the broth was plenty. I sauteed the onions and garlic in canola oil instead of butter, and added some fenugreek seeds. I also added several big handfuls of chopped fresh spinach. It's still a great recipe even if you turn it into a vegan soup. Oh, and I also didn't process the beans and tomatoes beforehand; instead, I put everything into the soup pot, then half way through the simmer I just blended half the soup in a blender then added it back to the pot. I used cooking sherry instead of sherry vinegar.

I made this for an office potluck and before I was done with my first bowl two of the guys had asked me for the recipe.  I followed the advice of other reviewers with the cumin, coriander and cayenne.  It turned out wonderful and will be going on my list of easy meals this winter because it was SO easy to put together.  Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious and satisfying!  I added the spices that others recommended plus 1 can chopped green chilies.  I topped with shredded cheese & chopped onion.   I intend to make & bring for our Christmas party at work this week!  Thank you.

This soup is out of this world. LOVED it. Next time I'll probably add small chunks of fresh pumpkin when I saute the onions... I will definitely be making this again. And I would imagine it freezes well, so I'll make this for Soup Swap 2011!

This soup is absolutely delicious!  I omitted the ham, simply because I didn't have any.  I also added cumin.  What a great light meal for wintertime!

This is a good recipe.  I decided to try it with the pumpkin because I was torn between making squash soup and black bean soup - couldn't believe I stumbled upon one that was both.  I didn't change any ingredients, however I did puree the beans, tomatoes and ham together.  You can't really taste the pumpkin, so if you're worried about that don't be.  It however adds a creamy texture and additional fiber so no harm in adding it for sure!  I'll definately keep this recipe and make it again.  Thanks!

I made a few changes. . . 4 c of black beans (freshly cooked) sweet potato puree, 28 oz can tomatoes, cumin, bay leaf, red wine vinegar, 1 tbsp molasses, 1 tbsp honey, vegetable broth, red pepper flakes. Pureed it all with a immersion blender. I added molasses and honey to balance the vinegar- a little bit makes a big difference. Will probably make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe and did not like it and didn't even put all the vinegar in.  I went with what some other reviews said and added some cumin.  I also threw in some pasta and then I finally liked it.

This was very good!!  I agree with other posters regarding spices.  I added Cumen and Curry, and upped the onion and garlic by about 50% based on our tastes.  A lovely Fall meal.

So I just finished eating this--it was great!  I actually could not taste the pumpkin at all, but I'm sure it gave it that wonderful body it has, so I don't think omitting it would've been okay.  I used chicken instead of ham, because it's what we had, and used a full pound rather than a half pound.  I also did not have sherry vinegar, so I just used a tablespoon of regular vinegar.  Next time I'll add another can of whole black beans, though, to give it more "stuff."  Overall, great soup!

This soup was amazing!  My husband and I ate leftovers for two days. I added some extra spices (basil, garlic powder, onion flakes, red pepper flakes) and skipped the step of using the onion and garlic.  I also left out the ham and used chicken stock instead of beef broth because it was what was in my pantry.  This soup does not look good... but the taste and texture is fantastic.

This was a yummy autumn soup but i did a couple different things that i think made it even yummier! There is another recipe on here that puts light coconut milk in it... so i added part of a can to the puree and part to my (non canned) steamed pumpkin mash and it made it so creamy and goes so well with the pumpkin. Then when i was cooking the onions etc... i added a little Rum (with honey) and let it sautee for a while. A little extra cumin and a little cayenne pepper made the flavor pop a bit more and My picky Spanish father-in-law was scraping his plate. We didn't even tell him what was in it for fear he wouldn't even touch it... ;) As a compliment i made the sour cream and chive rolls that i found on here and we had a great Sunday afternoon meal. Loved it... will make it again- so easy btw!

This soup was wonderful! A perfect fall dish! It seemed unusual, but I love pumpkin and I love black bean, so it was the perfect combination. As suggested by another reviewer I did add some cumin and cayenne pepper; I also only used two cans of beans, both of which I pureed almost completely, and about 2 1/2 cups of vegetable stock. The ham was a nice touch but I think I might make it without next time. It was a great dish, and I'll definitely be making it again. Thanks!

Awesome soup!  Great flavor alone, but also a good base to jazz up with sour cream, cheese, croutons, green chiles, tortilla strips you name it!  I left out the ham because I didn't have any but can't wait to try that too!  This is going in my regular rotation.

I love pumpkin and black beans, and thought I would love this soup.  I didn't.  It was ok, but I found it a bit odd tasting and looking (no one would even try it but me.) I eat soup every day and am used to having the same soup over and over until the pot is gone, but this one I managed only twice and then I just couldn't face it again.  It wasn't bad exactly, just not to my taste.  I made it exactly as per the recipe. Sorry!

Quick & EASY!!! I had to improvise many of the ingredients but it was still great!!  I only had 2 cans of black beans so I pureed one with liquid from can and left the other whole.  I also made it vegetarian by adding 2 cans of vegetable broth.  I added scallions and seasoned with pepper flakes and a dash of nutmeg.  I left out the vinegar all together.  A dollop of sour cream and it was delish!!  thanks for such a quick soup can't wait to taste it tomorrow!

As suggested, I made this soup the night before it was served.  It was very easy to assemble and very aromatic.  I used rice vinegar (simply because I had no sherry vinegar and) and I believe THAT and the pumpkin were what made this soup so different and wonderful.  Left out the ham, personal choice, but tore up some fresh semolina bread for "dunking".  It was a big hit in my family and we'll be making this again soon.

This is a savory, filling, and yummeriffic soup.  I personally detest ham and replaced it with bacon for my carnivorous boys (next time I'll try veggie bacon :-)  and I was out of sherry vinegar (oh wait, i never had any).  soooo good.    I served it with whole wheat beer bread (if you haven't tried this it is a must) and my gal pal brought a salad (although by the time it got to be salad-time I was stuffed).  Oh, there was copious  amounts of wine too :-)

4 stars as written.  Boost it up a bit by adding 1/4tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1 bay leaf and double the pumpkin.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I think the soup was a little runny, I, like others would reduce the number of cans pureed to one and leave the other two whole as well as reducing the amount of beef broth. I realized towards the end that it needed more spice and added thai red pepper sauce for some heat, cumin, smoked paprika and cayanne. I think coriander would be good too...didn't think of it at the time....I didn't seem to taste the pumpkin so I'm hoping the next time I make it the reduction of broth will help bring the flavor through, overall though a very hearty soup. I didn't have any ham so I threw a little bacon in it and it added a nice, smoky flavor.

Yummy! We used one less can of black beans in order to get a stronger pumpkin flavor. And maybe more pumpkin? Filling and good

I used 2 cups butternut squash instead of pumpkin and it turned out great. I also added some ground red pepper and cumin. Instead of beef broth I used 2 cubes of beef boullion and added it to four cups water.  My boyfriend and I loved this soup.

I served this as a first course for a Halloween dinner party.  The only changes I made were to use cider vinegar and chicken broth because that's what I had on hand.  I added a couple of teaspoons of Minor's chicken stock concentrate at the end to up the flavor a bit without adding more liquid.  Sprinkled with roasted pepitas and sour cream.  Everyone loved it!

I love this soup!  The only things I did different were substituting cider vinegar and leaving out the ham.  As the picture shows, I did add some sour cream to serve.  Thank you for this recipe!

I followed others' suggestions and doubled the pumpkin, but only used 2 cans of beans (1 pureed, 1 whole).  Also used cider vinegar.  Next time will use less vinegar or try red wine instead.

This was surprisingly good.  Very inventive.  We did not add the ham, and we soaked black beans overnight.  I would definately recommend it!

I found it to be a little sour like, I am sure it was the canned pumpkin, so I will use butternut squash if I try to make it again. I always use it for my regular black bean soup.

This is a fantastic recipe for those that are trying to find good flavor and watching how much fiber they eat.  I "skinnied-it-down" by using turkey ham, fat free plain yogurt and olive oil instead of margarine.  I tossed a bit of Chipotle Tabasco as well to increase the smokey flavor.  WOW!!!

Not one of my favorite soups, but it's alright.  I added a little bit of cumin to it, since it seemed bland otherwise.  I think it really needs to set awhile for the flavor to really develop fully.  I'm not sure that I would make this again, too many other great soups to make. Edit: My original rating was three stars, but after reheating this soup, I would definitely make again, it was good!

I made a vegetarian version of this using imitation bacon bits in place of the ham, and veggie broth instead of beef.  I used apple cider vinegar.  It went over well with the whole family; everyone ate it and liked it.  It definitely improves after it sits and the flavors mingle, so I would suggest making it ahead, refrigerating it, and then re-heating it to serve it.

Absolutely delicious! The changes I made were: puree the entire soup, use veggie broth and no ham (vegetarian), and add some bay leaves and ground ginger. This is the perfect HEALTHY comfort food, and I'm so glad I made a huge batch! It goes great with the Cranberry Guacamole also found on this site.

What an odd combonation this is, but this soup is fantastic.  It's so rich and hearty.  But it is a very ugly soup.  I substituted the ham for cocktail weiners cut in quarters since I didn't have ham.  I also substituted with apple cider vinegar.  I also used the can of tomatoes that have the green chiles in them and that gave it quite a kick.  That may not be for everyone.  With the chiles, I don't have to salt the soup, (which is good because I use a LOT of table salt).  Thanks.

So easy!  Didn't change a thing.  Made for Halloween.  It's usually pretty busy at our front door with the 400 to 500 Trick or Treaters, plus trying to get my own three kids ready.  Was easy to make ahead of time, and just simmer on lowest heat. Husband has told me at least 4 or 5 times how much he liked the soup.  (I didn't tell him how easy it was).

I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  The pickey husband loved it!  It was easy and economical.  I left out the third can of beans and only put one can in the food processor.  I added cumin, coriander, and chili powder.  The pumpkin was awsome, but not overpowering.  My husband could not guess the "secret ingredient"- he probably would not have tried it had he known there was pumkin in it.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I've made this recipe several times and it has been a winner for everyone who has tried it.  I can't say that it's lovely to look at, but after the first taste, any reservation is gone.  Even my kids eat it.  I omit the meat and leave the beans whole, but follow the recipe otherwise.  This soup is regularly found on our table.  I usually double the recipe for lunches throughout the following week.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I used smoked turkey necks instead of the pork hock and added a little seasoned salt and a couple of bay leaves for extra flavor. I took this soup to work for a pot luck luncheon and everyone loved it.

This is awesome.  Added a jalapeno, a dash of cayenne and some cumin to up the "kick" and passed Red Hot at the table...  topped with shredded Cheddar, sour cream and corn chips.  A keeper!

Made this last night as I had a can of pumpkin on the pantry...  I only had two cans of black beans, but liked that ratio better so you could taste the pumpkin.  And didn't have ham, so didn't add it.  I was tempted to add cumin, etc., but stuck with my usual rule of preparing a recipe as reported the first time, and was glad I did.  It was subtle, but not boring.  A little garlic bread and a salad, and you are there.

Very tasty!  I couldn't taste the pumpkin, but that's fine with me because I was really just looking for a way to sneak vegetables to my veggie-hating husband.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of sherry vinegar and turkey ham instead of regular, but I doubt that changed the taste much.  There was a lot of ham for my tastes, but my husband loves ham, so it was perfect for him.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious! I made it with sweet potato instead of pumpkin. I chopped, weighed, and boiled the sweet potato and then puréed it with the tomatoes and beans. I only made the switch because I didn’t have the pumpkin. I look forward to trying it with pumpkin.

This was really great, I did make a couple of small alterations: 
add 1/2 TBS cumin
2 tsp salt
To avoid canned ingredients change them out for: 
2 cups of fresh pureed pumpkin
4 fresh roma tomatoes
1 1/2 cups of dry black beans

The black beans you would just want to rinse and then soak overnight the day before you make.

This soup, as written is pretty blah.  I see why it got such excellent reviews because once you add extra onion, a few other kinds of beans, some cumin, some cilantro, and some cayenne, it's pretty good.  When you top it with Tabasco, sour cream, and Fritos, it really really good.  But, as I said, as written, it's not very tasty and I think I review should be written based on the actual recipe not on what happened after the recipe was modified.

I am always looking for new and different recipes to try, but this one i suggest you steer clear off! It was absolutely revolting, so much so I threw the whole lot away.

This is not pumpkin soup. It’s good black bean soup, though.

This turned out great, even though I had a few 'make it work' moments! The only canned tomatoes I had were one with green chiles and the other was 'chili ready with onions' so the soup had a little more kick than I planned so I added double the pumpkin, as well as some cinnamon and cumin! I plan to freeze it for after or new baby arrives and then I will probably serve it with sour cream on top and maybe cornbread on the side!

This is a family favorite! I've made a few modifications... use vegetable broth instead of beef broth, and omit the ham. I also add 1 t. cumin and 1/2 t. chili powder.

This soup is one of our favorite things about cold weather!  It's comforting enough that this is what we chose to accompany watching election results 2016. 
Our changes include using cooked black beans (to avoid BPA, 1.5 cups = a can), Vegetable broth, leaving out the ham, cooking with a couple of bay leaves, and a teaspoon of cumin.

Delicious and a great basis for any winter squash bean soup you want to create. I used a combo of butternut and delicate squashes with yellow split peas instead of black beans. I added a bay leaf, cumin, and coriander as others mentioned. I only had marinara in my fridge instead of tomatoes and I added a cup of salsa verde. Then I added meat from smoked pork ribs instead of ham. Oh my goodness, it was delicious!

This is SENSATIONAL!! Now something I make regularly & everyone that’s tried it loves it and is shocked there’s pumpkin in it lol. I am the queen of tweaking recipes and this one is absolutely perfect exactly as written. AND I think it tastes even better as leftovers. Yum! Thank you for the recipe!

I changed the recipe just a bit, using chicken stock instead and leftover chicken I had in the fridge.  Was a tasty meal, but the pumpkin is definitely overpowered in this soup, so if you are looking for actual pupkin soup, this isn't the one.

Turned out very tasty ! The only thing I did different was to skip the ham and substitute beef broth with vegetable broth (as I am a vegetarian) and used white wine instead of the sherry vinegar. Will totally make again !

This turned out amazing. I made some changes...I substituted the ham with about a cup of diced pancetta. I didn't need as much butter, and cooked the onion and garlic in the pancetta juices and 1 tbsp. of the butter instead. I used rice vinegar instead of sherry vinegar, and added a bay leaf, 1/2 tsp ancho chili pepper powder, a tsp of coriander, 1 tsp of smoked sea salt, a pinch of smoked chipotle salt, and a pinch of rubbed sage. It came out savory and delicious, not spicy but warming.

Turned out amazing and I even forgot to add the 3rd can of beans. I did throw in a jalapeño in the puree for spice but that's personal preference. I let it simmer for 45 minutes since I was cooking something else but I think it made it better

This was a great blend of flavors with a slight sweetness from the pumpkin and nutty earthiness from the black beans.  Blending them made a nice thick base.  Instead of canned beans I cooked 1.5 cups of dry beans in my pressure cooker and then saved out a third of the cooked beans.  Instead of canned tomatoes, I peeled and blended a pound of tomatoes from my garden.  Instead of canned pumpkin, I used some puree left from a Halloween pumpkin I baked.  I put everything in the crock pot in the morning and we had it that night, so the ham also cooked all day.  We liked it topped with sour cream and my husband added red pepper flakes while I sprinkled on freshly ground nutmeg.  Both were tasty.  My husband couldn't stop saying yum.

Great base recipe! I used 1 T. olive oil to saute onions and bell peppers instead of the 1/4 cup of butter (That's a lot of butter!) I also added cumin, cayenne pepper and chili powder because this doesn't have much seasoning at all. You can really use any type of meat you want in this, it's very versatile and healthy! We definitely enjoyed this hearty soup during the cold winter months.

I loved this soup, it is perfect for the fall pumpkin season. I made several alterations, some per the previous comments and some based on what I had on hand at home. I think this is a great recipe to experiment around with. I used fresh tomatoes (3) instead of canned, 5 cloves of garlic, substituted chicken broth (instead of beef), smoked turkey (instead of ham), apple cider vinegar (instead of sherry), and added red pepper flakes, 3 fresh bay leaves, and 1/2 tsp. of cumin. Also, I only pureed one can of the black beans with the tomatoes. It turned out great and has less saturated fat, which is good for people with arthritis!

Solid recipe. I added 1tbs of cumin, red pepper for some extra veggies and 1/2c. of dry sherry inspired by a similar recipe I found online. Instead of ham, I added smoked chorizo I already had in my fridge.

I love this soup! I might a add some cumin next time I make it, but it's delicious as-is. I sautéed the beans, tomatoes, and pumpkin with the softened onions, then added the broth to create some depth of flavor. I used an immersion blender after the whole thing simmered four about 20 minutes, rather than blending the beans and tomatoes upfront.

so glad I found this.  I was searching for a recipe because I had beef stock I'd made (grass fed beef/bones)and wanted to use it all up rather than freeze it.  I still have a lot of beef bones to make the next crockpot batch.  Right now, I get local garden fresh organically grown tomatoes, and always have dried beans on hand.  I had dried black beans so I soaked and used those, and I had a can of pureed pumpkin I knew Id use somehow. I have apple cider vinegar and use turmeric frequently so used those and added some cayenne pepper (tiny pinch) w chili pepper ~ along w fresh ground black pepper and himalayan salt.  (I don't use salt in my homemade stock.)  Some water buffalo yogurt I had on hand as garnish ~ rich thick and delish, and huge pot of soup at very low cost.

I agree with all the other reviews.  The recipe has a good foundation, but bland if followed strictly.  
I substituted a good quality cabernet for the sherry vinegar, and coconut oil for sauteing the butter and garlic. I also added 1 tbsp. curry, 1.5 tsp. cumin and 1 tsp. cayenne to the mix.  Also needed additional salt and pepper.  I prefer vegetable or chicken stock to beef as I think the subtleness of the pumpkin gets overrun with the strong beef flavor.  And finally, when serving, I add sour cream to each bowl and stir.  I also agree it does not need the ham. Top with chive and toasted pumpkin seeds and the recipe is elevated from ok to fantastic!

I made a vegetarian version of this. Used vegetable broth instead of beef and omit the ham and added some fresh chopped kale. Added some cumin, chili powder, and cayenne powder to give it a kick. Only had 2 cans of black beans and subbed the 3rd for great northern.. I only puréed about a can and a half of beans. Still turned out very yummy. Will be making this again! :)

My sister-in-law raved about this recipe and passed it on to me and boy was she correct....delicious!! I did not have three cans of black beans, so I pureed one can of garbanzo and one can of pinto and used the one can of black beans whole. I also used turkey ham. I will be making this again soon!!!

Great recipe as a base. Sometimes the basic recipes are a little bland but that lets you take it to your own personal tastes.(Southwestern, Indian or even well blended for a smooth, creamy experience)
I think you can take it in any direction you want. I added some Tumeric and Jalapeno to add some heat. I also  made cooked my own black beans instead of canned. I then gave it a loose mash to have both the texture from the mashed beans and some whole beans for a more rustic look. I served with Pita and a Zinfandel. Pretty great.

A bit bland, but a good base.  I used chicken broth instead of beef broth, and red wine vinegar, as that's what I had on hand.  After tasting, I added some cayenne pepper and gunpowder (jalapeno pepper spice), as well as some extra black pepper.  I threw in some corn as well, just for kicks.  I may try it again with some of the tweaks other reviewers have used.  Again, very bland on its own, but a great place to start.

This was fine.   I have other recipes for black bean soup that I like better, with a more Mexican kick,  but I was glad I tried this.  If you are trying to get more vitamins in your diet, I would definitely try this, can't beat the nutritional values in pumpkin.  Thanks for posting, I have been wanting to try this for a while and am glad I did.

Oh my goodness, this soup was amazing!  I did add and change a few things, however.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, I used fresh cilantro, chives, red and yellow peppers and included 5 stalks of green onion and left out the ham.  I pureed the entire soup and topped it with some slices of avocado.  Fantastic!!

I am shocked at the ratings for this recipe.  It tasted like weak beef gravy.  There were very little solids in the soup.  It needed much embellishment to get it to taste like anything.  I don't think I will try it again.

LOVED IT! I used fresh pumpkin puree and omitted the sherry vinegar altogether. I also used bacon instead of ham. Cooking the bacon in the very beginning and keeping some of the fat to cook the onions and garlic. It is freaking amazing! Even got my overly critical mother to say it was great and one of a kind!

I'm giving it an extra star for the benefit of the doubt, because I had to make this vegetarian (so veggie broth and no ham)....but it was really bland. Definitely add your own seasonings. I did like that it was a savory pumpkin soup that didn't make use of the usual pumpkin seasonings (nutmeg, etc.) and I've been inspired to try adding pumpkin next time I make chili, so I appreciate that! But I won't make this again. Thanks anyway, though!

I love it, but I omit ham and use half the broth amount.  I rarely use cooking sherry instead i Use 1 tbsp red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp of pure balsamic vinegar.

So delicious!! I followed others' advice and added about 3/4 teaspoon of ground cumin, which helped give it depth. Also put in a generous sprinkle of red pepper flake for some heat. I only had apple cider vinegar on hand, and used 2 T instead of 3. Served with a little sour cream on top, and it was wonderful! I liked the ham in it- made it hearty and filling, but I'm sure it would still be good without.

Had a half a can of pumpkin left over after making a pumpkin streusel cheesecake and received this recipe via email.  Didn't have any ham and used spicy Italian sausage.  It was good, even my fussy husband liked it.  It's going into my recipe box!   My first review.  I love good food but very busy, so when I cook I want it  to be rather quick but tasty.  This will make my soup of he week list.

this was a great soup but, I eliminated the ham and used red wine vinegar instead.  I also added dried cilantro and ground rosemary and anise.  Next time I will add kale from my garden.  I made the 9 cup recipe and it was gone in one sitting.

We made this for Halloween night. This was different than anything I really had tasted before, so my first few bites were interesting. However, I decided that I really liked it and the next day it was even better! The whole family (3 year old to grandma and grandpa) all had similar reactions. They thought it was different, but very good. This has made it into our meal rotations.

I followed the recipe as written, with one small exception; I used red wine vinegar because I didn't have sherry vinegar. I thought it was an odd combination of flavors and I won't make it again. It was slightly better on day two. I'm going to consider some if the improvements suggested by other posters to save this batch.

This was absolutely fantastic, the flavor kind of surprised me.  I'm not usually a fan of savory pumpkin recipes, but decided to give it a go anyhow.  The pumpkin was a very light flavor, most of it comes from the black beans and ham, but it's still noticeable.  I used fresh pumpkin, everything else was canned, and I was pretty happy with how it turned out.

I would say though that I'm not sure if the 25 minutes was long enough, but it's hard to say.  I was still busy pureeing the pumpkin when the onions and garlic were done, so I turned down the heat and eventually removed it from heat for a while so I could get that done.  By the time I got it back on, it had cooled considerably.  When the 25 min had passed, it was no where near thickened.  I put the timer back at 5 min about 3 or 4 times before it finally got the intended thickness.  It was well worth the time it took!

The whole family loved this.  It was great w/o the ham, but it was so much better with it.  I actually used 3/4 lb because my boys love ham.  I followed the recipe,except I used less butter to sautee the onion, and loved it! (oops, forgot that I didn't have sherry vinegar, so followed others suggestions of using apple cider vinegar and a tbsp sherry.) However, I then added a little cumin, cayenne pepper and a little chili/garlic paste and a 1/2 c or so of salsa to kick it up a notch.  It's funny, but you don't taste the pumpkin at all, but it does add a layer of flavor that is just amazing! I am sure any squash would work too. Great recipe as is or kicked up a notch....just depends on what you perfer. Thanks for a great healthy soup!

Odd tasting, odd looking, odd smelling and bland in the original recipe form.  We added a tsp of cumin, a 1/2 tsp of chipotle powder, 1/2 tsp Torani Bacon syrup, extra salt, and 1 can of diced Ortega chilies. Gives it a more southwestern feel.  Top with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and have with some tortilla chips on the side.  Much better.

Very easy and the taste was good! I didn't follow the recipe to exact because of lack of or taste preferences. I only had 2 cans of black beans so I used a can of chick peas. Only added 3 cups of broth and used 1 3/4 cups of fresh cooked pumpkin instead of canned. I decied to make it vegetarian so I left out the ham. Instead of adding vinegar I used 3T. louisiana hot sauce for some kick. Garnished it with plain yogurt, chopped chives and served it with corn bread. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe for a catering that i did. Was very well recieved, however i added a little cumin to this soup and some corn to the mix. This is also very good with chicken instead of ham! 

All in all great soup glad i gave it a try!

Simple to prepare and delicious. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and only pureed one can of beans. I also added some cumin, omitted the garlic and added some pumpkin pie spice. It turned out nicely. Will definitely make again!

I took other reviewer's advice and added cumin and it made this recipe taste too much like chili. Also, I couldn't really taste the pumpkin. It was ok, but if I wanted chili I would have made chili!

Unique and complex flavors, a wonderful soup, more like a stew, and I used a bit of red wine insteadnofmthe sherry vinegar, just before serving. This one is a keeper. I also cooked it a crockpot on low for 4 hours.

We really liked this.  I ended up browning a couple of Italian sausages broken up in with the onion and garlic because I had it on hand and we are not keen on ham.  Used two cans of regular black beans and one of jalepeno spiced black beans which added a nice kick.  Used vegetable broth instead of beef.  Completely forgot to add the vinegar.  Not a problem.  Thanks for a really delicious and healthy recipe!

Oh my goodness, what a spin on blackbean soup!! This is a delicious hearty soup.  Pumpkin was subtle and added a heartiness along with the blackbeans.  The sauteed onion and garlic really added flavor. Hubby and I loved it!

It was great. I didn't have  sherry vinegar, so used apple cider vinegar. I did add 1/4 tsp cayenne and a dash of cumin.  Used chicken stock instead of beef stock. I didn't purée the tomatoes. I added a can of corn. My family loved it.

So glad I tried this! It was unique and delicious. Here are my changes: first, I read the recipe wrong and only bought one can of beans. I just added them undrained and did not purée any. I imagine this made my soup less thick than what it was meant to be, but I liked it. Three cans sounds like overkill to me anyway. I'd think all you'd be able to taste was beans! Anyway my result was a thick broth. The "cover" picture shown with this recipe looks like the consistency mine had. I also did not add any salt since the canned broth, beans, and tomatoes and butter and ham are all pretty salty to begin with.  I used apple cider vinegar and only two tablespoons. I thought it was lacking in depth flavor-wise so I also added two pinches of nutmeg and about half a teaspoon of ground coriander. I garnished with fresh cilantro which really brightened up the final product. Very good soup! I'm betting it'll taste even better tomorrow. :)

I wish I had read the reviews about too-strong vinegar before I added mine... They are absolutely right. Also added the 1t. Cumin and some dried chopped cilantro to try and warm up the flavor. I want to like bean soups and keep trying variations, but seem to like the idea better than the resulting tastes, so take my 3 stars as a non-bean lover...

The recipe was good as a base. I felt it lacked something so I added chipotle chiles and little allspice to give it some depth.

This is a great recipe on its own, but I did take the advice of those who used apple cider vinegar rather than sherry vinegar and it was a hit. I also added cumin, which I always think adds a good flavor to black bean soups.  The pumpkin gives the soups a nice sweetness, as well. Since there are only two of us, the rest of the soup is ready for the freezer for more meals!

awesome soup. it's incredibly easy to make, just chop, saute, dump everything together and let it simmer. it has a nice toothsome, almost meaty taste and i think the pumpkin may be responsible for that. i added extra garlic, because we're major garlic lovers, and used only one can of beef broth because we like soup on the thick side. but no matter what you do, you can't ruin it. i took someone's advice and used coriander and cumin and i think it really enhanced the flavors. i also added an extra can of black beans for more chunk, and about a cup of heavy cream because i wanted to use it up. serve it with sour cream or plain yogurt mixed with a bit of lime juice and it's heaven. not the prettiest soup out there, but you'll be coming back for more and more. thanks for recipe.

Frankensoup: As Hurricane/Cyclone/Superstorm Sandy swooped upon us, I served this soup to great acclaim. Suggested changes I included were:
1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1 bay leaf, chicken broth instead of beef broth, left out ham, apple cider vinegar instead of sherry vinegar, and don't forget a can of crispy corn.The dollop of sour cream is wonderful, also.

Like many people, I changed a few things.  The idea of pumpkin and black beans was intriguing.  I changed it too much to give it a 5 star, but at the same time I have to say it is a good start.  I was surprised how much my family liked it.  Here is what I did and I understand I am falling into the don't rate it unless you follow it exactly category, but this recipe needs a bit extra. I added two cans of the 15 oz pumpkin to thicken b/c it has less sodium than adding 3 cans of black beans w/one pureed so I only added two cans of the black beans.  I added 2 tsp of all spice (mine says Jamaican all spice, but I think they are all the same) to enhance the pumpkin flavor and I went with a dollop of cream cheese instead of the sour cream.  Again, this is a great base, just play with it.

Delicious, nutritious & expeditious!  Hubby said it was one of the best soups he has ever had. Changes made were: 1) added 1 tsp ground coriander, 1 tsp ground cumin, 0.5 tsp cayenne pepper, 6 cloves minced garlic (instead of four) 2) omitted salt & ham 3) added 1 cup frozen corn 4) only puréed 2 cans black beans ( would probably only purée one can next time).  I would take this over chili any day of the week...try it, you will be very pleasantly surprised!

This soup was so good.....hearty & satisfying!  I added corn, extra black beans, cilantro & cumin.  Didn't have sherry vinegar so used red wine vinegar & some sherry. Will definitely make it again.  Served it with tortilla strips & sour cream.  Next time I think I'll only puree half the tomatoes so it might look prettier like the picture here. Wasn't that pretty, but YUM!

I can't say that I followed it perfectly, but I think that the cover photo should certainly be different. Not only does the soup look like mud, but it lacks texture. I recommend only blending one can of black beans, and using chunks of fresh butternut squash along with the can of pumpkin. Otherwise, the soup is a nice base.

Used 1 can of Rotel tomatoes and added a few shakes of cumin and coriander.  Tasted the soup before the spices, and was amazed at how the cumin and coriander additions really made the soup pop.  It was a delicious soup that I will definitely make again.

Great Soup! I added cumin as well, and a little dash of cinnimon! Great flavor!  I might also just puree one can of black beans first for a little chunkier texture.  I left out the Ham, but added corn.  Delish!

This soup rocks. I have a hard time finding sherry vinegar but have tried sherry, red wine vinegar, sherry and red wine vinegar. It changes the flavor but it is a great soup. It has become a winter staple.

I cut the recipe in thirds, did without (and didn't miss)the added salt, forgot the dollop of sour cream--and it was still very, very good.  In the photo I see green something or other (not noted in recipe) floating in the soup.  I think some chopped kale or spinach would not be amiss.  The sherry vinegar really makes the dish.  We had a piece of fruit, a slice of flax bread toast with the soup and found it quite filling.  Thanks for nutritious, high fiber supper.

Overall recipe is a winner!  I did add some coriander, cumin and a little chili powder for extra kick (why i only gave 4 stars).  I also only puree 1.5 cans as I like my soups to have a little texture.  A great way to use up some leftover pumpkin from Halloween!

Excellent!  Per other reviews, I left out the ham, added a teaspoon of cumin and a bay leaf, and used 2 tablespoons white vinegar (that's what I had on hand).  I sauteed the onion and garlic, then put everything in the crockpot and let it cook on low all day.  It turned out great!

I loved the soup until I pureed it. I hated it when I added the vinegar. Like others I used applecider vinegar instead of the sherry vinegar because this was all I had on hand. If I make it again I will definitely not puree the beens and I will not use the vinegar. I'm afraid I was very disappointed in the soup.

Some reviews said the pumpkin was subtle so I change out one can of black beans for an extra can of pumpkin. This was just an okay recipe maybe because I used too much pumpkin

This is delicious!! I left out the meat, used vegetable broth, and added 1/4 tsp cumin, coriander, chili powder and paprika, and also used red wine vinegar (3T) and 1T of apple cider vinegar. Used fire roasted crushed tomatoes too. It is absolutely delicious!!! If you want it chunkier, just puree one can of the beans with the tomatoes, and leave the other 2 whole.

Odd.  I didn't love this soup, but it was strangely addictive and once I started eating it, I couldn't stop.  I made a few changes.  Only mashed up 1 can of black beans.  Added cumin and cayenne to the onions while they sauteed.  Used more like 20 oz pumpkin.  Left out the ham.  Used chicken broth instead (because I had it on hand).  And at the last minute, I added a few dashes of nutmeg b/c it seemed a bit lacking.  I also let it simmer about twice the amount of time called for.  Oh and I used apple cider vinegar instead.  At first, I was afraid it would be too vinegary.  But that didn't wind up being the case at all.  Brought it for lunch today and topped it with a dollop of Greek yogurt and a touch of shredded cheddar.  I would make it again.  Easy enough.  And... yeah... something about it I really liked.

I'm vegetarian so I made the soup without ham. I added cumin, a small small piece of scotch bonnet pepper, and dumplings made of white flour, flax seed meal and corn meal. It was very popular in my house, even my toddler couldn't get enough! Thanks!

Surprisingly, this is a very tasty soup!  I'm glad I tried it.  I totally forgot to serve it with the sour cream.  Doh!  Most of the family loved it.  The picky one said that it was ok.  One suggestion, don't increase the pumpkin...it makes for a very strong pumpkin flavor.  Thumbs up on the additions of cumin, coriander, and curry.  I can see cilantro in this, too.

This is a *huge* favorite in my family -- I've been making it about five years now.  My version is slightly different.  I do not use ham, but rather a nice, flavorful, slightly spicy sausage.  (andouille works nicely)  I use only two cans of beans, and I use red wine vinegar, just a splash, which is very nice.  We often have this the night before a holiday meal as it is not difficult to make, and you can keep it either on the stove or in a crockpot, and guests or cooks can grab a bowl as it suits them.  Wonderful for football games too.

This soup is outstanding! Added cumin and cayenne for extra flavor, and added one extra can of diced tomatoes without pureeing for added texture. I also used less beef broth to thicken it up a bit. I was hoping to taste a bit more pumpkin flavor, but other than that it was terrific and very simple and quick to make.

I liked this one quite a bit.  I also used Apple Cider Vinegar rather then the sherry.  I tasted it before putting the ham in and really liked the flavor.  Wasn't as big on it with the ham in it, but still got complements about the meal.  Definitely good weird :)  I think next time I'll skip the meat.

Very good - the ingredients sound a little weird and the color is kinda sketchy! I followed another member's advice and pureed the tomatoes and one can of bean. I liked it chunky. Will make it again.

In my first try with this I used both sherry and cider vinegar. Still not enough flavor. The original got 4 stars for good body and texture but too bland on the flavor.I had a lot of leftovers so I took the advice of previous posters and added more spices to my leftovers. MUCH better! I added 1/4 tsp each cumin, coriander, chili powder, red pepper flakes and paprika.It's not a lot of spices at 1/4 tsp.....just enough to make a *big* difference.

This is a fantastic fall recipe - healthy and hearty! I added an extra can of black beans to make it chunkier (still pureed 2 for the broth), and replaced the sherry vinegar with apple cider vinegar. I added both cumin and coriander, as previous reviewers suggested. Lots of rave reviews in our house!

so good!  you really do not notice the pumpkin, except that something is a bit different than the black bean soup you are used to eating.  we made the changes that a lot of reviews suggested:  only pureed 1 can of beans to leave it a little chunkier, used diced tomatoes with chiles to spicy it up, no ham & veggie broth, used apple cidar vinegar, added cumin, a bay leaf, and red pepper flakes, and served with lite sour cream and green onions.  great recipe that even the boys can love!

Really one of the best 5 star recipes I've made in awhile.  I loved it.  I only pureed 1 can of beans with 1 can of tomatoes.  I then added ANOTHER can of tomatoes to the soup with the 2 leftover cans of black beans.  The extra texture of beans and tomatoes was great.

YUM!We did make adjustments based on all the reviews read. I did saute paprika, cumin and cayenne with onion and garlic. I only used about 2 Tbls of butter.I used 1 Tbls sherry and 1 Tbls apple cider vinegar. I used a can of butternut squash instead of pumpkin. I used homemade chicken stock (only 3 Cups). I only pureed the tomatoes and some of the beans. I can't imagine it being any better. The butternut squash was great. I will also try pumpkin sometime. Oh,yea, I did add a pinch of sugar at the beginning. My picky hubby and very picky father-in-law loved it.We put a dollop of sour cream on top in our bowls. Thanks..will be making a lot and will be sharing this with my girlfriends!

I really liked the soup.  It’s a very simple and easy soup.  Nothing gourmet about it, but it is very comforting on a fall night.      I made a few minor modifications based of other reviews.  I added some smoked paprika, cumin and cayenne pepper with the onion and butter to sauté.  I also used a 29 oz can of pumpkin since I really wanted that to come through more and I used a can of diced tomatoes with chilies.      All in all it’s a great recipe on the budget while satisfying.

An excellent way to use up the end of a can of pumpkin! I added some dried ground chipotle pepper towards the end, and subbed green onion because that's what I had. The pumpkin rounds it out nicely without being overpowering.

This soup was a very good, tasty comfort food for a chilly day. Even my 6-year-old brother loved it! I used apple cider vinegar, bacon instead of ham, and doubled the amount of bacon. I used crushed tomatoes intead of pureeing them, and I added extra onion and garlic. All in all, a very tasty, easy-to-make soup.

Excellent flavor!  Very easy to make.  I used a center cut of ham with bone-in to add flavor.

This is a great recipe. I used red wine vinegar and added cayenne pepper (1/4 teaspoon). I also garnished with cheddar cheese. Great on a November night!  Never tasted the pumpkin (and at least doubled it!).  Thank you!

Fantastic! Followed the recipe and added some suggestions: bay leaves, ground coriander seed and cayenne pepper. I doubled the recipe for a larger crowd and added 1 teaspoon of coriander, 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne, and 3 bay leaves. Probably won't added the cayenne next time. This soup makes a great alternative to chili and is filling.

Awesome! I did change it up a bit...pureed 1 50oz can of beans with can of tomato, 1 cup beef broth and the precooked garlic and onion. Then mixed with 3 cups beef broth and remaining ingredients. No ham. Served and added thin slices of avocado, drizzle of good olive oil

I loved this recipe! I put all the ingredients in a slow cooker instead of a stockpot to blend the flavors better. Plus I added an extra can of beans and cummin.

After reading most reviews, I decided to make this soup with a few variations.  I used tomatoes with chilies as recommended and added cumin.  I also left the onion out because of my husband's allergy.  We like the soup a lot, however when I make it again I will eliminate the ham.

I did quick and easy adaptation of this recipe, using two cans of refried black beans and one can of whole (rinsed) beans, two cups of salsa in place of the tomatoes and onion, added a Tbsp+ cumin and only two Tbsp of vinegar.  I think the vinegar does spark the flavor, but it should be added to taste.  I started with 4 cups of broth and added about another cup of water to thin the soup out a bit.  I did use ham and had homemade pumpkin puree.  Great taste for almost no effort!

This is a yummy soup and quite forgiving!  I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used Rotel, I didn't have sherry vinegar so I used cider, I didn't have beef broth so I used chicken broth and I didn't have ham so I sent my husband to the market! Just kidding- I skipped the ham but will pick some up for leftover soup!  The beans and pumpkin flavors complement each other beautifully!  Thanks for sharing, this is a keeper!

I completely left out the butter to eliminate the fat.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  I also topped with some fat free sour cream before serving.  Great on a cold evening!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this over Thanksgiving weekend.  Very good and good for you.  Thick soup.
I didn't have the sherry vinegar, so just added some white vinegar.

This soup is easy to make and tasty!  I added pepper to the garlic and onion while cooking, and omitted the salt completely. I pureed half of what the recipe called for and left the rest whole. I added slightly more pumpkin (about 3/4 of a 29oz can) and a whole pound of ham. Great recipe.

This is one of my favorite black bean soup recipes! As a vegetarian, I omitted the ham and used a vegetable broth and it turns out great. I make extras for the freezer and take them to work.

Thank you, REEDYGAL. We loved this recipe and will make it again.  Didn't use the ham as another reviewer suggested and substituted cider vinegar for the sherry vinegar. Very good in the fall when the outside temperatures go down.

Good! I added a little extra spices, but it was a nice way to use up the extra pumpkin I had! I also used only 3 cups of water, 1 can pureed beans and 1 can whole beans. Nice and hearty.

Will become a regular soup for our winter meals. A winner. Used dry black beans istead of canned (soaked overnight, cooked next day), added Italian flavored diced tomatoes (what was on hand), used 4 boullion cubes to make my beef broth. Had no ham, fried bacon in pieces and added. Rest of recipe stayed as offered. A hit all around. Next time will venture more pumpkin, was so mild my secret ingredient was not guessed.

Very different and good!  I added an extra can of diced tomatoes and can of hominy and omitted the ham. It was a little salty so next time will try and cut some out.
