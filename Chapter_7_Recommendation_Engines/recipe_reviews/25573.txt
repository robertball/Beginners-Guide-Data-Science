Wonderful and moist.  I made a coconut glaze for the top: 2 tablespoons of margerine, 1/3 c. sugar, 1/3 c. coconut, and 1/3 c. milk (heat and allow to cool slightly). I'll definitely make this one again. A great way to use up my freezer full of bananas!

This was an easy and pretty cake.  I used another reviewers idea and made a coconut topping, this gave it something a little more than just a banana bread taste.  I also used 1/2C applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil - no loss of taste or consistancy.

This was quick to throw together, but takes awhile to bake. Like Charlotte, I only had chunk pineapple on hand, so I chopped it up some. I baked mine in 2 (9x5 inch) loaf pans; it filled them about halfway, which was perfect. I think it would work well in 2 (8x4 inch) loaf pans also. I topped mine with a coconut streusel made with 1/4 cup butter, flour, sugar and coconut. It's easy to remember, because it's all equal amounts. Just mix until crumbly. The cake was very moist and good. I make this for my girlfriend's family, and they all love it, even those who are jealous!

Delicious!!!! You can use this cake for breakfast or dessert. My can of pineapple was 20 oz so I doubled everything else, halfed the oil and replaced the other half with applesauce. It was wonderful. It made one bundt, 1 large and 1 medium loaf pan. Next time I'm going to try a powdered sugar glaze over the top but it was wonderful without. My mother-in-law thought it was so good that I could sell it!

This cake is so good!!!  I used self-rising flour and eliminated the soda and salt.  And I only had chunk pineapple so I just cut it up some.  This cake (bread) was so moist and had a perfect crumb. I didn't have any problems at all.  I will be making it a lot because it seems that I always have bananas that are over-ripe.  Oh, and I used a Bundt pan (very pretty). Thanks Carol!

I've made this recipe for a couple years now.  My friend's parents said it was the best cake they've ever had.  Perfect for breakfast with coffee or afternoon with tea, but it doesn't need a hot beverage, it's so moist!  Everyone loves it.

Wonderful recipe! This was easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand. I used a Bundt pan and the cake came out perfect. This is a great one for those that don't like overly sweet desserts.

This is the exact recipe my family has been using for over 40 years.  As a kid, when asked what kind of a cake I wanted, this was the one.  We've always added a light glaze.  Nothing esle is needed for this special treat!!

This is a dynamite cake, but, why are the instructions and baking times shown for a 10 inch tube pan and the photo of the finished product shown for a 13 x 9 pan (or a 17 x 11 pan)?????  The baking times would differ based the type of pan used.

IMPRESSIVE!  Even more impressive, I only had to use ONE bowl to put this together! Wonderful!  I was able to use two round 8" pans and a small loaf pan!  I gave away two and ate one!  perfectly moist!

I started making this recipe about 35 years ago but somehow lost the recipe. I would make one almost every week when I was younger. I've been looking for it online for about four years. I was elated to find it as the first recipe that popped up when I found this site. The only thing that I would change about the reciped is to check the cake at 1 hr. to see if it needs to go the last 15 mins. My oven must be a little hotter, because it dryed out a little. It was still very good, though and everyone loved it! My son (who doesn't eat cake) likes this one! My grandbabies love it, and it's very easy for my four yr. old grand-daughter to help make it. We had such fun and she was so proud!

Taste was delicious! I used a bundt pan for this and I thought it would NEVER be done. After 65 minutes the top (really the bottom) of the cake was beginning to burn despite it being on a lower rack. I poked several holes with toothpicks in various parts of the cake which came out clean. Done, right? No. After the cake cooled I was disappointed to find the cake partially unbaked when I cut into it. I baked for another 20 minutes - for a total of 85 minutes and it was still the consistancy of very moist stuffing. I ended up cutting the unbaked part off because part of it was still edible. Kinda disappointing but to no fault of the author. I just won't use a bundt pan next time.

Loved this recipe.  Had been looking for something to make with the pineapple I have lurking in my cupboard and I found this!!  My whole family loved it.  I made two loaves and they were both gone the next day.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this cake as written and it turned out wonderfully.  I like how high it rose while baking and stayed that way once cooled.  The cake was done at the 75 minute mark, in my oven.  Once cooled, I dusted it with powdered sugar.

Wonderful recipe, I made these into cupcakes for a children's party.   Cooking time 20min.  Makes about 28 small cupcakes. I added 1 1/2 c sugar instead of 2, added an extra banana and they still turned out great.  I will definitely use this recipe again and the children loved them!!

I accidentally made a nice discovery! I forgot to add the eggs and it turned out great! Mind you, I halved the sugar and used 2/3 c. oil. That made the potential batter lighter so it didn't need the eggs for volume. GREAT starter recipe for modifications.

I made this in a tube pan, it came out so moist. The texture and flavor are  outstanding. I made a coconut glaze, a suggestion from a previous reviewer. The glaze and cake were a perfect match. I think that using a tube pan is the way to go for best results when baking this cake.

This cake was very good.  I used 1 cup sugar and 1/3 cup Splenda for baking.  Everything else was by the recipe.  It was good enough to bake for a cake/pie auction at church tomorrow.

First review I have written, and had to for this "bread" that sirves well as a cake. Very moist, very rich, and was a hit at a family picnic. Have tried with fresh pineapple, added slivered almonds,extra banana,all work well. Baked in a Bundt pan, and just topped with powerdered sugar.... it's delicious. Thank you!
