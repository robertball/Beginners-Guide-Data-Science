I absolutely love this recipe! However, I made a few changes to use up some things in my cupboard. To make clean-up easier, I sprayed the dish with PAM, used 1 small can of green chilies instead of a jalapeño while browning meat, 1 c. of sour cream instead of yogurt (I didn’t have any yogurt in the fridge) and 1 can of enchilada sauce. I dipped each WHEAT tortilla into the sauce before filling. I also poured remaining sauce over enchiladas before I baked. WONDERFUL! This tastes better than a local caterer's recipe. Well done. Also, made these again and topped with fresh chopped cilantro and black olives when the dish came out of the oven. Yum!

These were very good.  Both my husband and son liked them a lot.  I used sour cream instead of yogurt, and jack instead of mozzarella cheese, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  I found that 1 1/2 lbs. of meat was a bit too much to fill the tortillas and still be able to roll them up, so I just sprinkled the extra meat on top.  But probably 1 lb. of meat would be ample for the recipe.  Also, heating the tortillas, covered, in the microwave, to soften them a bit would make them easier to roll up without without cracking.

Even though the chicken soup scarred me, I tried this recipe anyway.  This was the best dish that I have served in a long time.  I used flour tortillas, sour cream instead of yogurt and chedder jack cheese.  This reminded me of a favorite dish that I like from a mexican restaurant.  Also, use a 9 x 13 pan when cooking.

Although my eyes widened at the thought of mixing cream of chicken with beef/mexican food, this was great!!  I ommitted the jalapenos but added 1 4.5oz can diced green chilies to the soup/cheese mix.  I used 1/2 cup yogurt and 1/2 cup sour cream and used half moz cheese and half 3 blend mexican cheese.  I also used flour tortillas and turned out great (HOWEVER-remember to grease the baking dish or they will stick!!).  Served with shredded lettuce and chopped green peppers and we all thought they were terriffic! Will make again!!

This was a great starter recipe, but I made some changes like many of the other reviewers. I used Campbells southwest cheese soup instead of the chicken soup, regular onions instead of green onions, and sour cream instead of the yogurt. I also added a can of diced green chiles, and used flour tortillas. It was fantastic! My boyfriend wouldn't stop eating the filling with the torts. even before I got the chance to put it in the oven to bake! This will go in my recipe book for sure!

These were very good, my whole family enjoyed them.I used flour tortillas instead of corn and substituted sour cream for the yogurt. I also used shredded cheddar cheese, but next time will use a mexican shredded cheese blend. Whenever I make a dish like this I pour a little taco sauce in the bottom of the pan, this keeps the bottom of the tortillas from getting hard.

My husband and I had these the other night.  We make a new recipe every Monday night to keep our tastebuds happy.  We live in Texas and have tons of Mexican food available, but these were by far better than what most restaurants serve.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe.

Made this recipe a little healthier.  I used LOWFAT yogurt,98% FAT-FREE cream soup, only 20 oz.of ground EXTRA LEAN TURKEY, 2% MILK mozzarella cheese, FAT-FREE FLOUR tortillas (softened in microwave) and fresh diced tomatoes on top. What a great flavor! The creamy mix with the mexican spices is unique and delicious. This now goes to the "favorite" file!

This recipe was disappointing and would be better named "American Enchildadas".  To be fair to the submitter, I always follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it, but my family thought these were bland.  I usually make chicken or seafood enchiladas with a green or red sauce and I thought the ground beef would be a nice change.  The soup, yogurt, and mozzarella sauce was interesting, but there was too much of it and the ground beef filling for only 6 corn tortillas.  Also, the taco seasoning didn't seem quite right and perhaps the recipe would have been better if I had used my own seasoning combo instead of the taco seasoning mix and had used monterey jack cheese instead of the mozzarella.  I won't make these again.

I have changed a few things with this recipe since it was first posted.  I use tortilla shells instead of the corn and most often use sour cream.  I have also used cream of mushroom and onion soup, and it is great.  I use tex-mex cheese bblend in the mix and once they are all rolled and in the pan I also spoon sour cream over top and then more tex mex cheese.  Onions and peppers are great fried in with the beef or chicken when I use it.  Another thing I often add is some salsa prior to rolling.

I loved these!!!  I was out of cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of mushroom and I used sour cream in place of the yogurt.  I did not have mozzarella on hand so in went some cheddar cheese (about twice as much as was called for).  I also put some sliced black olives in with the meat mixture!  Even though the way I made it is a real artery stopper upper, it was just sooooo yummy!

I have made this recipe about 10 times and it is a family favorite!  I use sour cream instead of the yogurt (I made it once with yogurt and my family prefers the version made with sour cream instead of yogurt).  From making this I have found that substituting fresh chives for the green onions works fine (for those times when I had no green onions but my chive plants are always producing).  Also I have found that when I have no jalapenos that tabasco peppers work as a good substitute (I grow tabasco peppers in my garden).  The one time I used a habanero, my family said it was a little spicy for their tastes - but I enjoyed the extra heat of the habanero (with any pepper I don't clean out the seeds, I just dice and add it in).
  
A tip I used from another review is to heat up some oil in my cast iron skillet and to "heat up" the tortillas about 3-4 seconds each side before putting the filling in.  This makes for an easier time  rolling/folding them and IMHO it also gives the tortillas a better taste.  I usually use corn tortillas, but have used flour tortillas the same way in this recipe with great results.    

I would also like to give a big thank you to the poster of this recipe, as my family loves eating these.

As suggested by other reviewers, I used sour cream & southwest pepperjack soup for the cheese mixture.  I also added more cheese and used a mixture of cheddar & mozzarella.  For the beef I only used 1/2 bunch of green onions, 3 cloves finely minced garlic & a shallot also finely minced along with some onion powder.  Instead of packaged taco seasoning, used one found on AllRecipes.  Used chicken stock in place of water.  For rolling the tortillas (flour - personal preference) I put a skillet of heavy cream on low & dipped them into it first so they are easier to roll.  Topped them off with the red enchilada sauce from this site before spooning the remaining cheese mixture over the top.  Seems like a lot of alterations but it really wasn't.  Excellent recipe.

VERY yummy! Tasty and simple, although next time I will use flour tortillas as suggested by others.  I used supposedly high-quality corn tortillas and they ripped open even though I was very careful not to over-fill them.  Also, next time I will garnish with chopped tomatoes and cilantro, this would lighten up the recipe a bit.  By the way, if you're making 6 enchiladas, they won't fit in a 7x11" pan.  Try 9x13 instead. Also, you'll have lots of delish leftover ground beef...I put mine in hard taco shells the next day - YUM!  Lastly, don't forget to wear gloves while dicing the jalapeno!!! (I learned that lesson the hard way)

To keep my flour tortillas from turning into nasty mushy dough, I first LIGHTLY grease the glass dish with meat shortening,  then I lightly butter and place the tortillas butter-side up on a metal baking pan in my oven @ 350 for about 5-6 minutes prior to stuffing with meat.    I also added the soupy cheese mixture only around the perimeter of my glass baking dish and the ends of the enchiladas, leaving the very center of the dish covered only slightly with a dusting of shredded mexican blend cheese.  Don't crowd the enchiladas in the dish, give them a little room between each other for the heat to circulate.  this keeps them crisp.  Good recipe, kids loved them and I made it again yesterday!

My co-worker and I both fixed this recipe on the same night.  She and her husband
absolutely LOVED it!!  My daughter was watching me fix it and wrinkled her nose at
the time.  By the time dinner was served, she was asking for seconds!!  Even my 3
year old son cleaned his plate!!  My husband, who cares very little for any type of Mexican
food voiced his approval!!  Excellent recipe!!!

This recipe is excellent!!  I noticed some reviewers seemed to think something was missing...I always make it with 2 lbs. meat, 1/2 a bell pepper, a little more jalapeno, half the taco seasoning and 3/4 can red, hot enchilada sauce.  All those extra ingredients add a lot more flavor.  Also, I use flour tortillas instead of the corn.  You'll have to use a 10x15 baking dish just to fit it all.  It is a lot more delicious this way!!!

A great recipe! Very easy, very flavorful and delicious. I added some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to the cream sauce for some extra kick. The smoky chipotle flavor goes REALLY well, but this recipe stands up fine without it as well.

These were good but not great in my opinion.  Corn tortillas tear easily when rolled so that was a small problem.  I left of the pepper and green onion (family preference).  I did make a few additional enchiladas filled with bbq chicken and glazed onion.  Make sure you cover the enchiladas completely with the sauce and foil, unless you want the edges to be crisp.

This was a great basic idea.  The cream of chicken soup really adds a great flavor, but like a lot of others, I nixed the yogurt and substituted sour cream.  I also added a can of drained black beans in with the meat, veggies, and taco seasoning, and on top, added mexican blend cheese and a can of enchilada sauce before baking.  Very filling, but a great recipe!

This recipe was absolutely delicious and I still have my husband of 6 months believing I am a good cook! I omitted the peppers and onions, added light sour cream instead of yogurt, added only 3/4 pound of meat and substituted a can of corn for the rest of the meat (since I'm not a huge meat fan). I make this all the time!

Super easy, super fast! Great if you are in a hurry. I used flour tortillas because that was all i had. However, for those who have trouble with corn tortillas falling apart, you have to dip them in hot oil for about 3 seconds first and they will fold nicely. I also used green chilis since i don't like hot stuff. Make the Mexican Rice II recipe on this site and it makes for a fantastic meal.

There were a winner!!  I used green chilis instead of jalapenos and sour cream instead of yogurt.  Use the mozzerella cheese...it will suprise you!!  Tastes just like a cheese sauce!  I put enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan, I only used 4 tortillas....i stuffed them to the max!! also added some salsa with the beef & cheese mixture.  Put the rest of the sauce on top and topped with some more mozz cheese...baked for 30 mins!  Absolutely wonderful & will definitley make again!

My stepdaughter made this with flour tortillas, which we didn't really like. So I made it with corn tortillas, and it was much better. I omitted the jalapenos and substituted a small can of green chilies. I also added a small can of sliced ripe olives (drain first) to the meat mixture. But I cannot for the life of me understand how all that meat mixture will fit into only 6 tortillas! I used nearly an entire 24-count package. I also discovered that smearing the cheese mixture onto the tortilla, then adding the meat mixture, works better - gives the meat something to cling to. Seam side down in a glass 13x9 pan works well. Just be sure to spray the pan with non-stick spray first. This recipe is a keeper; we absolutely love it!

I thought these were excellent!!!!  I substituted the sour cream for the yogurt and used a combination of shredded cheeses I had (mozzarella, monterey and colby), also added garlic, paprika, and chili powder to the meat.  The only problem is the corn shells broke easily.  Next time I will use an enchilada sauce to soak them in first.  Also, would use additional sauce for the top of the dish.  Will definetly make again!!!

This was a VERY good dish.  I used shredded Mexican cheese (combo of Monterrey Jack, Cheddar etc),fat free yogurt,98% fat free condensed cream of chicken soup, and flour tortillas (instead of corn) since I already had those.  If you want a bit more of a bite, I'd recommend using 2 jalapeno peppers (instead of 1).  Also, VERY important: if you bake them in a glass Pyrex dish like I did, DEFINITELY spray your dish with Pam otherwise the tortillas will stick to the pan (a pain!)  However, after the first bite, I forgot about that and just concentrated on enjoying the meal.  All my husband said between mouthfuls was mmmmmmmmmmmmmm......

My whole family LOVED this recipe...I did make a few changes. I used flour tortillas(that's what I had on hand) and I used sour cream instead of yogurt and used pepper jack cheese instead of mozzarella. This is the best enchilada recipe I have come across in a long time!!Thanks for submitting this recipe ~ I don't think my husband will let me go back to regular enchiladas after trying this one.

My family REALLY enjoyed this.  Great weeknight type of meal.  When I cook Mexican I usually lean toward more authentic - but you don't always have the time for that!  I have to admit that I was very skeptical of the cream of chicken soup - but with the mozz., the sauce reminded me of the white cheese sauce you sometimes get at Mexican restaurants.  I used the low fat cream soup, 1 pound on meat, added ancho, black pepper, white onion, corn and diced red pepper to the meat mix.  I also drizzled some red enchilada sauce on top of the dish, along with diced green onion and cilantro. Definate do again.  Tasty and easy to boot!!

These were sooooo good and easy.  I used green chiles instead of jalapeno's, sour cream instead of yogurt, Mont. Jack cheese instead of mozz., and flour tortillas instead of corn. I'm planning on trying the yogurt next time, without letting the boyfriend know!

These were great!  However, to satisfy my family's tastes I used flour tortillas, omitted the jalapeno, and added a small can of green chiles to the cheese/soup mixture.   Yum!

Ive used this recipe for about two years now, the only difference in mine and this one is I do not use mozarella cheese, I use the cream of chicken soup and a jar of salsa mixed in the soup let it warm up on the stove mix about 2 tsp of taco seasoning mix in the soup, pour over the ENCHILADAS, top with two cups of cheddar cheese. Yum!

Very good and very easy to make!  I substituted garlic for the jalapeno pepper and sour cream for the yogurt.  I also used flour tortillas since I prefer them to corn tortillas.  This recipe is definitely worth trying!

These were good...I did have some trouble rolling them up.  I also used sour cream instead of yogurt...I will make again, but probably try to spice it up more.  Thanks for posting.

This was my first attempt at enchiladas, and they were delicious!! I added Extra Spicy taco seasoning and a little extra jalepeno, because I like spicy stuff. I used cream cheese and "Tex Mex" blend cheese (because I was too lazy to grate it all), which was still great. I also used flour tortillas, because that was all I could find, but didn't listen to previous advice- you HAVE to grease the pan with these. Also, I seem to have gotten almost twice as many enchiladas as expected... not a bad thing, in my opinion, just be sure to have extra tortillas on hand!

When I first read this recipe and saw the serving sizes I was skeptical. 1 enchilada would fill up my husband? Ha! I DID end up with way more beef than I needed but wow!! 2 enchiladas=overstuffed husband! And better yet, requests for a rerun at some point! That's high regard indeed!

These were very, very rich and yummy.  I didn't have jalapenos so I used mild green chilis.  Next time I will use jalapenos because the spice would have complimented the creaminess better.  My husband hates cream of chicken, but loved the creamy sauce.

This was pretty good. I also subbed sour cream for the yogurt, cheddar for mozz and used the southwestern soup instead of the cream of chicken. To me it needed something hence the four stars. Next time I'm going to stick with the recipe -like i probably should have - and maybe the chicken soup will do the trick.

I loved this recipe! My 2yr old loved it to. I made a few changes though. First I used half a sweet medium onion to brown with the ground beef and a small (3oz) can of roasted jalapenos. Be sure to use corn tortillas or it will be soggy. Also, I used sour cream instead of yogurt b/c that is what I had. I added one can water to the cream of soup mixture b/c it was really thick.  After, I put 1cp of Mexican shredded cheese on top. Finally after it was baked just before serving I topped the dish with fresh diced tomatoes and green onions. It was beautifu as well as so easy and good!

Unless I really hate it I don’t usually rate a recipe low. This was a pretty good dish but the recipe itself was not good enough to give it five stars. I was a little skeptical about mozzarella and non-red sauce on beef enchiladas but I had the ingredients on hand. It made tons of meat and cheese mixture for 6 little 6”tortillas and a 7 x 11 pan and I only made 1 lb. of ground beef.  This could have easily been stretched into 10 or 12 tortillas in a 9 x 13 pan. The stringy gooey aspect of the cheese was the best part but the flavor was nothing extraordinary. I used sour cream but yogurt wouldn't have made it any better. I left out the jalapenos and used regular onion and bell peppers. Maybe the extra heat would have pepped it up a bit. I meant to put some additional salsa on top of the servings but forgot. I’ll try that tonight with the leftovers. For color I sprinkled a few crushed orange nacho cheese flavored tortilla chips on top because this looks pretty bland. It won’t get thrown out but I doubt I’ll make it again and from a cheese-aholic that is not very high praise.

Pretty good, we enjoyed this recipe.  I used canned jalapenos and it was too spicy.  Used fat free plain yogurt and reduced fat cream of chicken soup, taste was not low fat-ish at all (fooled my husband).  Topped with salsa perfected it.

I used Campbell's southwest cheese soup instead of the cream of chicken soup.  I substituted sour cream, like another member mentioned, and used a mexican cheese mix.  I always use more cheese than called for.  Just a tip, you must soak the corn toritillas in warm water or milk before trying to fil and fold them, otherwise they will break up.  Pretty good, but different so not my favorite.

These were good, but there didn't seem to be enough beef flavor--it was somewhat overwhelmed by the chicken soup.  Next time I will try using 8" flour tortillas so that I can fit more beef in them, and using an extra package of taco seasoning mix, but the meat didn't seem to be seasoned quite enough.  Also, the 6 6" tortillas did not fit well in the 7x11" dish, it works much better in a 9x13".  I definitely will try this recipe again!

I made these with flour tortillas. Good but next time I will change by using mushroom soup instead of chicken and using only 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning. Pretty good.

I made this and my whole family loved it! I made a double batch and here are the adjustments I made: 
I used half yogurt, half sour cream
I used 1 package of taco seasoning and 1 package of the dry enchilada sauce mix
I used red enchilada sauce and dipped each flour tortilla in the sauce before filling it (this makes it easier to roll the tortillas up as well)!
The double recipe made a bunch, though...next time I will make a regular batch, with my modifications!

I tried this recipes with a few alterations suggested by others (i.e. sour cream instead of yogurt, pepper jack instead of mozzarella) and a few of my own (roasted salsa in in meat mixture, extra cheese on top), and this turned out GREAT!  I am not a very good cook, but this recipe was extremely easy and my boyfriend says I should definitely make this again.  As someone else mentioned, the it did take a little more time to cook then was called for (about 40 minutes).  All in all, a definite keeper!

Yogurt is the secret ingredient here. My whole family loved this amazing dish. I used only 1lb of ground beef and it was more than enough. Don't hesitate to add the entire jalepeno (or two). We don't like spicy-hot foods and the whole pepper wasn't too much for us. Corn tortillas add extra flavor and texture but if you dislike corn tortillas, I'm sure flour would be great, too.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was good but if I make these again I would thin out the cheese filling....way too thick, I would add the soup and yogurt to the beef mixture and thin out with water or chicken broth and save the cheese to melt on the top.

Absolutely wonderful! Like others, I made the following changes: used sour cream instead of yogurt and added a can of enchilada sauce (half on bottom of pan, half poured over top). Yummmy! The chicken soup sounds strange but the cheesy sauce was absolutely amazing so don't doubt it!!

I accidentally put cheesy flavored taco seasoning on the ground beef.  It still was incredible!  I am going to try and make a dip out of this for football season.  That cheese combo is out of this world.  I'm trying to think of what else I can put that on.  For now, I'll make a dip with some taco meat on the bottom.  That being said, this recipe as is is amazing!  Thank you for sharing.

I really liked this a lot, but I made a lot of modifications, per everyone's suggestions. I used fat free sour cream instead of yogurt, low fat/low sodium creamed chicken soup and I also used a 1/2 can of enchilada sauce to line the backing dish prior to placing the enchiladas in the pan. I also tried some with ground turkey breast and some with shredded chicken....both were excellent. (I did make some without the canned enchilada sauce, but I found it lacking flavor....could be just a personal preference.) I really loved this as a base recipe because you can choose to make it low fat, really spicy or not.  Thank you thank you thank you....this will become a staple in our house.  Oh yeah...and my husband loved it!

Instead of the cream of chicken soup, I use an enchilada sauce from this site.

I also use flour tortillas, omit the jalapenos (my GF doesn't like hot spices) and whatever cheese I have on hand.  This has become our favorite dinner.

This was really good... I was a little unsure when I saw beef and chicken soup, and since I didn't have any on hand anyway, I used cream of mushroom.  It was very tasty.  Also, as per other reviewers, I used sour cream instead of yogurt, and chedder instead of mozzerella.  If it is too salty, I reccommend using the low sodium taco seasoning.

I wasn't a huge fan of this. Next time I will use fat free sour cream instead of yogurt (the yogurt was OK, I just think I'd like the sour cream better), and I will use green chiles instead of the jalepeno. I also had a hard time rolling the smaller tortillas, and might use the 10 inch ones instead. I used Monterey Jack and Cheddar instead of mozzerella since that is what I had, but I think mozzerella will be a much better choice!

I made these per the recipe except that I used 12 tortillas and layered them in the dish, making a sort of Mexican lasagne.
Delicious!

Made these for supper tonight and they were scrumptious! Husband wanted to make sure they were added to the regular rotation. Like some of the other reviewers, I used sour cream instead of yogurt and used the packaged Mexican cheese blend. Also fried the tortillas a couple of minutes. Made 8 large servings.These are great!

These enchiladas were so good and a really nice change from the typcial "red sauce" enchiladas.  My whole family enjoyed them.  The only changes I made were 1/2 yellow onion in place of the green, and sour cream in place of the yogurt (only because that is what I had in the house at the time).  I also used 1/2 mexican blend cheese and 1/2 mozzerella.  I served them with Mexican rice and letuse.  They were fantastic! Thanks for the great recipe, Vanessa!

These were pretty tasty!  We also used sour cream instead of yogurt and since I am vegetarian we replaced the beef with veggie meat.  I think they could have had more stuff in them, like some vegetables or peppers or something.

I really appreciated having this delicious recipe as a base with which to be a little creative.  The yogurt instead of traditional sour cream was much healthier and made the dish taste like Mexican comfort food. I just sauteed diced onions and green peppers before browning the meat. Once the taco seasoning/water had simmered, I added the vegetables back to mix with lots of cilantro. Because I only had 1 pound of ground beef, I added a can of drained black beans along with some green verde sauce in place of the green chilis. All I had was shredded cheddar cheese so I used that instead and since I don't own a 7x11 pan, I just used a well greased 13x11 pan. Since the pan was larger, I used 10 six inch flour tortillas and put the remaing sauce and some cheese on top before baking. My husband really enjoys Mexican food and this easy recipe was a real winner in his book. Tasted as good or better than favorite restaurant enchiladas! Thanks for a new way to use ground beef.

Took everyone's advice.. used Pam to spray bottom of pan, put some enchilada sauce on bottom of pan, filled shells with 1/2# turkey and 1/2# ground sirloin cooked (added cooked yellow pepper, then the soup and sour cream mixture. Folded and put toothpick in to hold. Poured rest of red enchilada sauce on top, a little more shredded cheese.  When done, and on plate, topped with a good brand of salsa, black olives, and shredded organic lettuces.  One of the best meals so far!!!

I love it!!! I made it last night and it tasted better than enchiladas on a menu at a restaurant. I used sour cream (about a half a cup) instead of yogurt. It truly was extremely delicious. The green onions and jalapeno pepper makes it taste scrumptious! I recommend this recipe if you like enchiladas. It is not a lot to do to make it and you will definitely enjoy it!!!

I just love this recipe! The first time I made it I followed the recipe but this time I did what a few people said and dipped my tortillas in red enchilada sauce.  It made it even better! The whole family has approved this one.

This recipe is very good and easy to make. I didn't brown the onions and jalapeno with the meat as I like the onions and jalapeno to have a bite. I used 1 pound of meat instead of one and a half as the recipe called for. Very tasty and will make it again. I might try a lower fat version by cutting down the amount of cheese and using low fat cream of chicken.

I changed this a little to use up ingredients that needed to be used before they expired. It was awesome! The best enchiladas I have made!!! I used half cream of chicken and half cream of mushroom soup, Colby jack cheese and I poured enchilada sauce over the top along with the leftover cheese mixture. Also I didn't have jalapenos so I used leftover green chili salsa, I mixed a little of that with the beef mixture.

I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of celery soup instead. I didn't have a package of taco seasoning, so I used 1 T taco seasoning from a recipe I found here and 1 T flour, then added the water. I didn't have regular yogurt so I used 1/2 c vanilla yogurt (not recommended because it made it sweet) and 1/2 c cottage cheese. I also used large flour tortillas because that is what I had on hand. I did cover with aluminum foil because I was concerned they may dry out. I got 5 large enchiladas that were a bit sparse on filling, but that was my fault. VERY TASTY!

This was a fantastic recipe! I used 8 medium sized flour tortillas instead of corn. I also only used 1lb of ground beef instead of 1 1/2 and it seemed to be the perfect amount. 
Has anyone made these the night before and baked them in the oven the next day? Wondering if I can already assemble them the night before and just stick them in the oven the next day?

We loved this recipe!  Even my 22 month old devoured it!  We used sour cream instead of yogurt (although I would have preferred yogurt for health reasons, but we didn't have any).  We also substituted the jalapenos for a can of green chilis.  I only put half the taco seasoning, only because that seemed like a lot...and lastly I added a just few spoonfulls of green chili sauce into the cheese, sour cream mixture.  The end result was fantastic.  Will definitely make this again!

These were much tastier than I expected. I used Greek yogurt, which was not thin enough to get "runny" when diluting the cream soup, so use regular yogurt (or yogurt + milk, whatever). I used 12 of the 6-inch tortillas, I could not have properly folded this much filling into only 6 of the little ones (and I only used 1 lb of ground beef, so you might need a few more to do 1.5 lbs). I stole someone else's idea to sprinkle the extra meat across the top and quite liked that idea. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is right on!  I spiced up the meat a little and used flour tortillas and  Sargento's authentic Mexican cheese mixture.  I also used lite sour cream. They were quick and easy and everyone enjoyed them.  I will make them often.

Good recipe, I thought these were quite bland for my taste though.  I used regular chopped onion, and added minced garlic, chopped pepper, and 2 jalepenos.  I also think I needed to put more of the sauce/cheese mixture inside wraps.  I will probably try again with some more adjustments.

Tastes great!  Used regular onion instead of green, mexican cheese, and then put some rotel tomatoes on top (1/2 can no juice).  We both really enjoyed it.

These are amazing!The main reason is the sauce---I wasn't bold enough to use the yogurt (I substituted fat free sour cream) but go for the mozzerella, it will surprise you! It made the best, white cheese sauce, very creamy and wonderful. Like something from a restaurant.

This was pretty good.  I meant to put diced green chilis in, but forgot.  I think 1 1/2 lbs. of ground beef were too much.  I think 1 lb. would've been fine.  Also, I think bigger tortillas would've been better then all of the meat mixture would've fit.  Also, the tortillas cracked very easily.

I really loved this.  While it was not "traditional," it was very tasty.  I would add another jalapeno for a bit more zest.  Like others, I used sour cream instead of yogurt.  I also used Pepper Jack.

Turned out great! I used ground turkey and added green chilies. My husband thought it was a little rich but I loved it. I had the leftovers the next day.   Worth a try.

Family really liked it. I did use regular sour cream and not the plain yogurt. Do heat the tortillas before filling or they will tear when you try to roll them

Very good and easy to customize since I have picky kids.  I made the tace meat without the onions and jalapeno's.  I made 3 enchiladas with just the taco meat and added chopped pickled jalapenos to another 4 and put in a 9 x13 inch pan.   Next time I will do the same, but may add some regular red enchilada sauce to the the bottom of the pan.

So awesome. Added yellow, red & orange diced pepper & onion to the meat mixture (had no taco seasoning so I threw in a bunch of random spices); instead of yogurt/sour cream I use HELLUVA DIP - it adds a great flavour. Mixed that with the chicken soup and cheese. Filled 5 9'' flour tortillas, fastened the tortillas with toothpicks (great tip so they stay together), sprayed my glass pan with pam prior to putting the enchiladas in and voila!

This is such a great recipe to expand on, I LOVED the idea of adding cream of chicken soup and yogurt (or sour cream in my case) to the filling which is why I chose this one to try. I used 1 pound of ground beef to which I added 2 cloves of garlic and minced onion along with the green onion and taco seasoning, and 1 small can green chiles since I didn't have any jalapenos, which was plenty for the 7 flour tortillas I used instead of corn (I also added about 3 oz. cream cheese to the meat mixture, just for a bit more richness).  Make sure you oil your baking pan before putting your enchiladas in, it will make serving and clean-up SO much easier.  My husband loved it which makes it a keeper, thanks for sharing this.

This was good BUT I did make a few changes.  I save myself the time and mess of rolling the tortillas (plus, unless corn tortillas get heated or oiled they don't go willingly into rolls lol w/out crackin') I took a stack of corn tortillas right out of the bag and cut them into small squares (like 1 inch by 1 inch).  I then tossed all the main ingredients together in a bowl and put it into a glass 9x13 baking dish.  Then I topped it with the soup mixture (reserving some shredded cheese to top and melt in the last 10 minutes of baking).  ALSO: Instead of a jalapeno I used a small can of diced mild green chiles.  I used cheddar cheese instead of mozarella and sour cream instead of yogurt.  This made it super easy and yummy too.  :)

A++++ Awesome recipe!! I did alter a few things based on previous reviews & threw my own in as well & this turned out soooooo unexpectedly wonderful! I browned hamburger meat with reg yellow onions, not green, added in a few old el paso sliced green peppers & cooked that all up. Added in taco seasoning & water & let that cook till water absorbed. I used flour tortillas instead of corn & sour cream instead of yogurt. I did not have shredded mozzarrella, so in the soup mixture I used about 1 1/2 cups mexican shredded cheese. I did have slices of mozzarrella, so I laid a slice of moz on each tortilla, then scooped the hamburger mix, & the soup mix. I only had a little of the soup mix left, so I just spread it out then over the tortillas. I let these bake until the tops were a light golden brown. I sprinkled more mexican cheese over top & cooked until it melted down. I diced up some tomato & sprinkled over the top once I pulled out of oven & these were wonderfully crisp on the outside, nice & gooey on the inside. A great flavor! I wish I would have had some black olives & green onions also to sprinkle over the top, but this was a hit with myself & my fiance'!!! Great recipe. (I served w/refried beans & mexican rice)

Wow!!!! These were totally awesome.  My husband couldn't get enough of them and requested that I make them often.  I did substitute the green onions with white onion and the yogurt with sour cream as others had suggested.  I also put the tortillas in hot oil for 3 seconds on each side before wrapping them.  Definately a keeper - thanks Vanessa!

I made these at the recommendation of my sister.  My husband really liked them.  I was skeptical of the Cream of Chicken soup at first, but found that it is really good.  We don't like yogurt so I used sour cream instead.  Being pregnant, jalapenos are too spicy so I used mild green chilis instead.  I also used flour tortillas and co-jack cheese.  One way of making them more quickly is layering tortillas and filling in a pie plate sprayed with nonstick spray and baking with cheese on top.  This makes it into an enchilada pie of sorts and the cheese on top helps the visual appeal.  This recipe also freezes well.  I have also made this with cooked, diced chicken and it turned out wonderfully.  I would recommend this.

I loved this! I changed it a little bit. I cooked the ground beef with onions, which is what I had and black olives and mushrooms. And I used a can of red enchilada sauce and sour cream instead of yogurt. I'll definitely add this into my menus in the future.

THESE WERE THE BEST!! I HAVE MADE THEM 3 TIMES IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS.  I DID LIKE SOME OF THE OTHERS AND USED SOUR CREAM INSTEAD OF YOGURT AND USED S.W. PEPPER JACK CHEESE SOUP.  I ALSO MIXED UP SOME ENCHILADA SAUCE TO POUR OVER THEM WHILE COOKING.

i made  this as per the recipe and used corn tortillas as  i can't eat flour ones.  Make sure you warm the corn tortillas before you try and put the mixture in them it makes them easier to handle.  A big success especially with the mexican rice

I made this tonight and couldn't even finish eating what was on my plate.

The yogurt and cream of chicken mixture should never be used with beef.

I also had trouble rolling the tortillas. They all cracked.
I won't make this again. Ever.

Excellent beef/chix combo! Many have asked for the recipe, especially that of the terrific, creamy white sauce to use on any number of dishes. Great leftovers if they make it that long.

I'm from Texas and with all the Mexican restaurants around me, I have grown to demand authentic, spicy Mexican food and know what's good and what's not in town.  Even though this recipe isn't authentic at all and was probably invented by somebody from the North, I did make changes.  I made spicy enchilada sauce with chili powder, cracked red pepper, and many other spices and dipped each tortilla entirely in there before filling.  I then added the meat and cheese, chicken soup and sour cream mix in the tortilla, closed the tortilla and topped it with that mix and then drizzled the red sauce over that.  They were phenomenal.

Don't know what all the rave reviews are about.  We liked the beef filling, but the sauce was awful.

This recipe was great..Kids loved it...I had a burrito kit on hand so used that..I substituted green pepper for the jalapeno (my family doesn't like hot foods) Also used sour cream instead of the yogurt. I didn't have Cream of Chicken soup so used Cream of Celery instead..It was still excellent and I can't wait to try it with the Cream of Chicken soup next time...

This is an excellent recipe.  A very different take on enchiladas that my picky husband and kids loved!  It made tons, I think I got 12 enchiladas in my 9x13 dish.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

My family loved these.  I doubled (I double everything, see my other reviews if you are a doubler.  I didn't make them up all at once.  I used 1/2 gr. chicken.  I also browned the meat, drained and rinsed it.  Then put it back into the pan and cooked 1 onion and 1 garlic clove into it.  Very tasty

So good and easy to make! I didn't have any leftovers with this recipe!  I often work late so to save time I make the meat mixture and cheese mixture earlier that day and combined them at night... they tasted fantastic!

Made this dish tonight for dinner.  Did use Sour Cream instead of yogurt and mexican cheeses with just a little mozzarella.  I used 10 6" flour tortillas and still had some meat left over.  Froze it for tacos later. My husband and I, and one grandaughter liked it and said I should make it again.  I will!  Thanks, Nannie

I was a little hesitant at the thought of mixing cream of chicken soup with beef, but most of the reviews were positive, and I thought I would give it a try, and let me say that it was absolutely wonderful.  This enchilada recipe gives it much more of a kick than plain beef rolled in a tortilla shell.  I didn't use Mozzarella cheese, because Mozzarella cheese seem to go better with Italian dishes better than Mexican dishes.  I used cheddar/Jack Monterey combination, and used 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 sour cream.  It was FANTASTIC!!!!

This recipe was delicious! My husband (very picky eater) rates this a 4 1/2 5 star dinner- very impressive for our house! I added chili powder to the soup mixture and onions. The corn tortillas definitely fell apart so if I was serving guests I would dip them in oil like the other review stated, that would have been helpful to roll them up. Made a lot too! *****

We loved this recipe! I suggest quick frying the tortillas in a couple tablespoons of oil first to keep them from breaking when you roll them up. It adds a little more time, but well worth it.  I was a little skeptical of the ingredients at first, but they are a great combination, thanks for a new family fave!

Absolutely amazing.  I loved these.  Most of all it was the  sauce, I think the filling is pretty common.  The sauce was sooooo good.  I had company coming that afternoon from out of town and wanted to prepare as much as I could before.  I mixed the sauce, browned the beef and sliced up the tomatoes and lettuce for the top.  When it was time to eat I just reheated the meat and rolled them up and spread the sauce.....SOOO GOOD.  My father in law loves enchiladas and he couldn't get over the fact that he loved them so much without the red enchilada sauce he's used to!!!!!

yummy!!  I made this for my in-laws.  BIG HIT.  I too replaced the yogurt with sour cream as suggested.  The corn tortillas tend to fall apart a bit.  Put them in the microwave for 30 seconds to keep them together better.

This recipe was great!!  We thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  I used flour tortillas and after rolling them up, I flipped them over, so they stayed together better.  I did not use yogurt, I used a mixture of sour cream and milk with the soup, and used one cup mozzarella cheese and one cup cheddar.  They had to bake for about forty minutes, which is longer than the recipe calls for, but this was a great meal.  I will definitely make this again!!

Nice change of pace from chicken enchiladas. I used sour cream instead of yogurt, a Mexican cheese mix instead of mozarella and flour tortillas. Turned out well. Husband thought it could use a little salsa mixed in with the meat. I might try that next time.

This was really tasty and very simple to make. A few changes I made were to use canned green chiles instead of jalapeños; corn tortillas instead of flour; enchilada sauce poured over the enchiladas before putting cheese mixture on top. Don’t let the chicken soup and plain yogurt scare you...you won’t taste either! I will make this again!

I really liked this recipe, however, i did make a few changes. I didnt use the jalapeno pepper, instead of a green onion I used a red onion, used flour instead of corn tortillas, and I used sour cream instead of yogurt.  I topped mine with tomato and olives as well  My family is not big on a lot of spice so this was perfect for us. If you want it to taste like traditional enchaladas this may not be the recipe for you. But my super picky husband did like it!!! One thing I would do differently is put a little sauce on the bottom before sticking in the enchaladas  so the bottoms arent so hard.

This was easy and delicious!  I subbed cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken soup, sour cream for the yogurt  and shredded "mexican blend" cheese for the mozzarella (this is what I had on hand).  I served black beans and a salad on the side.  Very nice meal and my family loved it.  Thanks for posting!

Good easy recipe.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used Campbells Nacho Cheese soup instead of Cream of Chicken.  My son who does not like enchiladas did like these!

We did not think the sauce and the beef enchiladas went together.  We topped our's with salsa and it helped a little.  Won't make again.

This is a great recipe.  I used ground venison, added 3 chopped poblano peppers and did 1/2 jack and half mozzarella cheese.  I also used low carb mamma Lupe's wheat tortillas.  That's the only thing I didn't like but the flavor was awesome and the poblano peppers made all the difference.  Next time I will use flour or corn tortillas.

Husband claims that these were better than restaurant quality. I followed the directions to the tee. The only thing I am going to make sure I do next time is to buy larger corn tortillas that way I can make it look like actual enchiladas!  Loved it, will cook it again.

I didn't have any green onions on hand so I made do without.  My family enjoyed it and my teenage son could have eaten the whole pan by himself!

these were so good! I am not calling this a review as a review would be making it exactly as written. I added a can of green sauce as my family loves it and I have already been in trouble with them before for dry enchiladas.  I used cream of cheese soup, sour cream instead of yogurt and Monterey jack/cheddar blend. lastly flour tortillas as hubby hates corn so I let that ship sail years ago. the four stars, then, are for the idea. Brava. it is now a keeper

Fantastic dish. Family loved it. I used 2lbs of beef but divided into 2 aluminum foil about the size of 8x 8 pans but not for sure of size. Did not use olives or peppers but did use green onions  also added whole corn drained to beef mixture. used Greek plain yogurt not sour cream as others suggested   I also warmed my 15 or so corn tortillas in microwave with wet towel for 1 minutes like another person did. Sprayed Pam in pans. Then put 1 huge tsp of cheese mixture in tortilla then added beef mixture on top n rolled n placed in pan. Added leftover cheese mixture on top of tortillas n then added salsa. Yummy n kinda healthy..baked 350 for 35 mins together.

Delicious!!! Made the recommended substitutions of green chilies instead of jalapeños, sour cream instead of yogurt, and 1cup Mexican cheese and 1 cup mozzarella instead of 2 cups of mozzarella, based on what I had in the house and previous reviews. Turned out the best enchilada recipe I've made yet! I broiled for the last 4 minutes to get a nice cheese crust on top along with the olives and green onions.

I was interested in trying this as a easy weeknight meal.
I thought it was a little off with adding a can of chicken soup, it was... I think the other reviews suggestion to add cheddar cheese  would make more sense the next time.
It's an easy dish just needs some tinkering to add it to the weeknight menu rotation.

Very good!  Kids loved it.  I used 1 lb. lean ground beef, multigrain tortilla shells, light sour cream instead of yogurt, and regular chopped onions instead of scallions.  I also did the chili peppers instead of the jalapeños.  I know it seems like I completely changed recipes, but I used all the recommendations from previous reviews for the changes, which seemed to make sense since everyone said the changes worked out.  I will make again!

If you decide to put two jalapeños [I'm Mexican so that's what I did haha] umm put a tomato in there like purée the tomato and add it in so it isn't so spicy and is a little saucier. I used Velveeta texmex cheese... And I did use the yogurt it was delicious. Do not be scared to use the yogurt.

These were delicious!! My husband loved them, too. They were great straight out of the oven and as next day leftovers served cold. Will definitely add these to our regular rotation. I followed the recipe with one change- I added diced white onion to the beef and skipped the green onion.

Very easy to make... Used corn/flower combo tortilla as it was all I could locate that day. Came out great with them. Also drizzled some medium red enchilada sauce for an added kick. Leftovers reheated in micro well and there are none left.

I want to apologize to the original submitter before I review this because I kind of did with what I had! I needed a quick recipe with ground beef and this was a great outline for what I had in my pantry. These were my changes: I used 1 lb ground beef, regular onions instead of green, diced green chiles instead of jalapeños, sour cream instead of yogurt, cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, flour tortillas instead of corn, and a mixture of cheeses that I had on hand. I know its really different, but wow it turned out great!!!

6" tortillas seem too small for how much goes into them and the plain yogurt somehow overpowered the dish. I suggest using sour cream like other reviewers suggested.

Great recipe.  We don't do ground beef often and I would probably use shredded chicken next time.  I did use sour cream in lieu of yogurt and lightly dipped flour tortillas in enchilada sauce prior to filling.  Also, I use the Bill Echol's taco seasoning from this site...so much better than store brands.  Thanks Vanessa!

This is the second time in a month I've made this because it's amazing!  I wasn't sure about the cream of chicken at first but WOW is it good!   I added a few extra things I had on hand like a can of rinsed black beans and a can of fire roasted tomatoes to the meat mixture.   Like other reviewers I used sour cream in place of yogurt.  I poured 1/2 can of enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan and then poured the rest on top over the creamy cheese sauce.  Then topped with extra cheese.  A new family favorite!!

At first the food snob in me shied away from making this because it called for 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup which reminded me of casseroles from the '70s and '80s. I got over it. This recipe was very easy and tasted delicious. I only used 1 lb. 93% lean ground beef and it easily filled 8 6 inch tortillas.  I used lean sour cream in place of the yogurt, 1 small can green chilies in place of the jalapeno, and flour tortillas in place of the corn.  I microwaved each tortilla for about 3 seconds before filling them.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  This is a good weeknight recipe.

This was awesome! Everyone loved it. I added ingredients to make it fuller (can of re fried beans and can of diced tomatoes). I didn't have yogurt so I used French onion dip. I also used two taco packets instead of one because I didn't want the beans to make it too bland. I am now expected to make this once a week!

Loved this dish! I broiled them for 5 minutes to make the top more crispy. Next time I would grease the baking dish though as the enchiladas stuck to the bottom and were hard to scrape out. I also served them with spanish rice and guacamole.  Will definitely make again!

I will make these again and again.  They are so good!  That sauce is unbelievably good!  I did make some changes as other reviewers suggested and based on my own personal tastes.  Husband HATES jalapenos, so I used a can of green chilies, sour cream versus yogurt and added a can of Rotel tomatoes, monterey jack versus mozzarella and lastly, flour tortillas instead of corn.  I did spray the pan with some oil before rolling the tortillas so they wouldn't stick (had that issue before....not pretty!).  Made the Best Spanish Rice from this website as a side dish.  I could've gorged myself.  Next time I will add some black beans as a side as well.

These enchiladas are so good!  I played with it a little bit the second time, but the first time was great too!  I used flour instead of corn tortillas because that's what we had.  I put the green onions in with the soup along with a can of diced green chilis.  I put the soup mixture on the stove on low just to get it to meld and it helped with the spreadability!  I sprinkled fresh cilantro on top because we had some on hand.  DELISH both times!  My husband and his friends agree.

I thought this was great.  My family asked to save the recipe to make again.    4 stars since I made changes.  No jalapeños, used flour tortillas, sour cream instead of yogurt, and only 1 cup of mozzarella since it was all I had.  After making the enchiladas with the cheese soup mixture and meat, I added 1/2 cup of milk to the remaining cheese soup mixture to thin it out just a bit.  I was also able to make 12 of the enchiladas.  Was plenty to feed family of 4.

I made this recipe exactly as directed, and it was fantastic. I really enjoyed how few ingredients were required, and I was impressed by how much flavor it had. Prep was about 15 minutes and cooking took 20. I had enough filling to make 10 tortilla shells, which was fine - now I can eat it longer! Next time I might use fat free varieties to ease up the calories (so I can eat more at once!), but it was great as written. So, now for the full disclosure: after trying it per the recipe we added salsa and avocado on top, and that made the dish go from fantastic to out-of-this-world delicious! If you want an easy to cook meal with excellent flavor - look no further. And feel free to experiment with other mexican inspired toppings. You really can't go wrong.

My husband absolutey despises Mexican food.  So, while his favorite dish is a chicken and spinach dish I came up with, I thought I would try and incorporate that.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken we had, added the spinach, used sour cream in place of the yogurt and for the cheese I used a 1/4 cup of mozzerella and the rest cheddar.   He LOVED IT!!  He actually ate 4 of the 6 and wanted to know if he could have the rest for lunch the next day!!!  DEFINITELY a keeper of a recipe!!!

Meh. These were so-so. Even tho my hubs and neighbor had nothing negative to say, they didn't offer any positive feedback either.... Don't get me wrong. Our enchiladas weren't awful, they were just mediocre and a little mushy (at least for my liking). Having said this, I must admit I made a few minor changes. My grocer only sells beef in 1 1/4 lb. packages, so that's what I used. I also chose flour tortillas over corn ones (personal preference) and subbed a 4 oz. can of diced green chiles, sour cream and Mexican-blend cheese for the jalapeno pepper, yogurt and cheddar / mozzarella cheeses called for (I already had these items handy). My final change was to dip each tortilla in red enchilada sauce (just a light dipping). I poured the remaining (~ 1/4 c.) sauce on the bottom of my baking dish so that my enchiladas would not stick. I recommend skipping this step. It is totally unnecessary, but sounded like a good idea when I read one of the reviews suggesting it in the first place. :( Served with Mexican rice, fiesta corn, my neighbor's homemade salsa and margaritas (compliments of my AWESOME hubby!). Maybe your family will love these, but we'll pass on a repeat at our house. Thanks anyways, Vanessa. :-)

These are so good. I like using the chicken soup instead of the red enchilada sauce, much creamier. I changed a couple things as well. I used shredded beef that I cooked in the crock pot with onions and taco seasoning, and instead of peppers I mixed can of green chilies in cheese mixture, super nummy!

Pretty good enchiladas!  Even my son who does not like Mexican food ate it!  It was a bit too salty with all the combined favors so next time I think I will substitute low sodium cream of chicken and use my own Mexican spice for the beef.  Overall - great recipe that was super easy to prepare and tasty!

My husband LOVES this recipe and begs me to make it. I modify it a bit, using sour cream instead of yogurt, half moz/half cheddar for the cheese, a can of enchilada sauce (that seems absolutely necessary) and olives on top. When I was pregnant I used canned chilis instead of jalapenos.  Good recipe though, it is part of the usual suspects in our house.

Easy and tasty!! Used sour cream as suggested by other reviews and 1/2 can of Rotel instead of the jalapeno.  I divided the cream of chicken mixture in half. Mixed 1 part into the meat after it was prepared for easier assembly and reserved the rest to cover the enchiladas. We've tried dozens of enchilada recipes and could never get the 4yr old to eat more than a nibble. The entire family enjoyed every bite!

Hubby and daughter loved this version as it's rich as savory without being too overpowering. I was less impressed and still prefer the red sauce version. Good recipe for those who don't really care for traditional enchiladas (like my hubby and daughter).

Very very good indeed. A definite keeper. I didn't know what to think about the cream of chicken soup, but followed the recipe to a T and it came out great. Definitely restaurant style and flavors blend well and are not overpowering. Yum

Great Enchiladas!  We don't like our food to be too spicy or hot, so I only used 1/3 of a jalapeno pepper in the mix.  I also used taco sauce on the bottom of the 9 x 13" pan so that the tortillas would not stick.  Poured more taco sauce on top of the enchiladas and added some fresh chopped tomatoes and grated double cheddar cheese.  Also squeezed the juice of one lime on top, then baked for 30 mins at 350.

These were wonderful. I doubled the recipe because I was having company so instead of the fresh jalapeno pepper, I used 1 4.5oz can of diced jalapenos and 1 4.5oz can of diced green chilies.  I also substituted sour cream instead of using the yogurt. Instead of mixing 4 cups of cheese inside, I used 3 inside and used the remaining cup over the top.  I used flour tortillas and dipped both sides in enchilada sauce before filling, and sprinkled the remaining 1 cup of cheese on the top afteward.  I did not use the remaining soup/sour cream/cheese mixure on top because it was plenty enough inside. I just used the 1 cup of plain cheese.  My husband and father in law are AWESOME cooks and are the type that RARELY go out to eat because they are never happy with their food. Both of them RAVED about how tasty these were, and said they would definitely eat them again. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Good recipe.  Found that I had way more of the cheese/soup/yogurt mixture than I needed - and I cut the beef down to 1 lb and I still had extra!!  We used corn tortillas, which I love...but may go for flour next time as they are bigger and may allow for more filling!

I wasn't sure about using the cream of chicken, but turned out alright. I thought it was a tad salty, perhaps due tot he taco seasoning.  The jalepeno pepper I used was not spicy enough. Maybe next time I'll use something with more heat. I served with salsa and homemade guacomole. I thought it gave the enchiladas that extra kick i needed for this recipe.  I'll look into making my own taco seasoning next time too. But goos base recipe.

Very tasty! the only thing I did different was add a can of el pato sauce. I added a bit in the meat and once all of the cheese sauce was poured over the enchiladas I added the remainder of the el pato sauce on top. will make again.

These were REALLY yummy! Like everyone else though, I changed them to suite our tastes.
I didn't have green onions so used a small white onion instead. Left out the jalapenos. Didn't add the water, but put about 1 cup of mild salsa in my meat mixture when it was cooking. I think I used more then a cup of yogurt, I just eyeballed it, it was closer to 1.5 cups. I also used a mixture of cheddar and gouda cheese and not mozza.
Will for sure make again. Thank you for sharing!

This was so good! Creamy and tasty. I did not put the jalapenos in only because my little kids would not eat it if it is hot. But did not change anything else! VERY GOOD and my kids gobbled it up!

Made these tonight. I used flour tortillas instead of corn because that's what I had on hand. Also, with the cheese mixture I used sour cream, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, Jalapeño & Monterrey Jack cheese and Queso Blanco. I also chopped up the Jalapenos, green onions and used half a red onion with the ground beef. When everything was done, and beside putting the xtra cheese mixture on top I also put a can of Rotel on top. It was excellent!! We have leftovers for tomorrow! I plan on making some Spanish rice with the leftovers!!

This was my first time legitimately cooking, mostly because I am no good at it, but wow these are good! I used sour cream instead of yogurt, & poured enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan & on top of the enchiladas. VERY filling! Also discovered the difficulty of rolling corn tortillas. Making this again.

This was pretty delicious! I substituted shredded chicken for beef and sour cream for yogurt (what I had on hand) and it was devoured. Thank you for such a delicious and easy recipe. : )

So I did like other people and lined the bottom enchilada sauce, i used green sauce cuz i like it better.  I went w/out the jalapeno just because i didnt want too much spice, but everything else I did as the recipe said.  Ive never made enchiladas before and these were super simple and got great reviews at the potluck i brought them to.  I'll def make them again!

DELISH!!!!!!! It was a bit cheesy for me but my family LOVED them! Very, very flavorful! I used flour tortillas instead. I think next time I will add enchilada sauce over the enchiladas before I cover them with the cheese mixture.

This was so good!   I did follow the advice of some and used enchilada sauce at the bottom of the pan as well as on top of the enchiladas.   My two youngest thought it was too spicy.    My husband, oldest daughter and I loved it!   Next time, I'll make half with enchilda sauce, half without.

These were awesome my 5 kids and my husband loved them!  They were easy to make and nice and cheesy!  I am always looking for fast and make ahead recipies since I need to get dinner on the table for a hungry brood after work!  The only changes I made were to lighten it up a bit: 93% lean ground beef, reduced fat cream of chicken soup, lowfat daisy brand sour cream, and reduced fat mexican style shredded cheese!

I JUST made these and they're AMAZING. I followed the recipe near-exactly, save that I accidentally grabbed diced green chiles instead of jalapenos so that's what I added instead. I also used the tiny flour tortillas cuz thats all I could find - and I made 10-12 mini enchiladas out of the mixture, and still had leftover meat and cheesey goodness to pour on top of them. baked 'em 23 minutes and let 'em sit for a few more out of the oven - they're AMAZING. I could definitely see where the jalapenos would spice them up a bit more, and will try that next time (and I will read the label on the can a bit closer!). thanks for a fantastic and surprisingly easy recipe for enchiladas - this one's a keeper!!

Great recipe for enchiladas, like many, I changed a few things.  First big thing is I used rotisserie chicken for my meat, as well as using some left over "hoppin johns" as a kind of bean spread inside the corn tortillas too.  Used a can of enchilada sauce, 1/3 spread on the bottom of the pan which made cleanup SO SIMPLE, the other two thirds on top of the completed enchiladas, before I spread the remaining cheese mixture.  For that mixture, I used healthy request cream of chicken soup, part lite sour cream, part cottage cheese, part plain greek yogurt, finished with about a cup of cheddar/jack cheese.  Used the remaining cheese to sprinkle on top.  Delicious!

This was really delicious!  I took the advice of another reader and used sour cream (had no yogurt).  With the cheese and sour cream mixture I added about a 1/4 container of enchilada sauce. When browning the beef, I added a can of green chiils (had no fresh jalepeno), as well as half a sweet onion (had no green onion) and then I added some green peppers and mushrooms.  It turned out so delicious!  Served with Mexican rice!

I really like this recipe.  I was scared by the chicken soup mixed with beef, but it makes a really yummy creamy sauce. I do like to jazz it up a little. In the meat mixture, I add corn and a can of diced tomatoes and jalapeno instead of just the jalapeno. It has been a hit when I share it with friends. Very tasty given its simplicity.

SO YUMMY!  We have always used the same recipe for making enchiladas (a family recipe passed down).  However, I decided to give this one a try...and everyone was THRILLED with the end result.  Here are a few things I did differently:   Sour cream instead of yogurt, added a can of diced green chilies, and added a little extra cheese.  Also, added some chopped onion as well as the green onion.  To add a little extra sauce I mixed one can of enchilada sauce with sour cream and put half on the bottom of the pan, and the other half over the top with the soup mixture.  We also used flour tortillas instead of corn.  VERY GOOD!!!!  I made half with chicken and half with beef--both turned out awesome!  We will be using this recipe in the future for sure!!!!!!  Thank you.

This was a really nice change for a beef enchilada. There was too much sour cream/cheese though, we all agreed on that here. I only used 1 lb. of ground round and I got 14 enchiladas from this so I can't imagine how anyone could only get 6. I made two pans. I used Lawry's brand taco seasoning and some roasted Hatch chile I had in the freezer. I didn't have yogurt so I used sour cream. Also no mozzarella so I used a four cheese mexican blend. I used freeze dried chives and a couple of shakes of onion powder since I didn't have green onion. This had a great flavor and were tasty. The Hungry Teen though didn't like these and only rated it a 3, which means "edible but don't serve it again" in our house. Maybe the sour cream sauce just didn't work with the beef for us.

I know I'm going to get in trouble for this but I had to change a lot based on what I had.  I still thought they were fabulous, great comfort food!  I used 1/2 a yellow onion, omitted the jalepeno, used about 2 T of Taco Seasoning I (from this site), sour cream instead of yogurt.  My only complaint is the shells kept splitting and it should state to cover with foil.  I'll definitely make this again.

AWESOME! I made this for my husband with the jalapenos and for the kids and I without. I used sour cream instead of the yogurt because I'm a sour cream freak. My husband could not get enough. He said he was full at 2 but he ate 5. My husband had me make 30 of these for a football game.  I made 15 with chicken instead of beef. They were great. Every one wanted the recipe. I also added green pepper in when cooking the beef or chicken. Gave the meat a wonderful flavor.

Good, but far more work than I anticipated. Corn tortillas break easily, so be careful; I placed the wrapped tortillas seam down to keep each one from flopping open. I scattered the extra hamburger mixture on top of what turned out to be more of a casserole, underneath the cheese mixture. My wife liked the recipe too.

I made these last night for dinner and they were wonderful. My son is sooo picky and even HE enjoyed them. We ate the leftovers today for dinner. After wards he said asked me to make them again.  Okay, soooooooooo I made a few changes.  I use sour cream instead of yogurt.  I also used corn tortillas instead of flour. I also put salsa at the bottom of the pan so they would not stick. I will make these again. Thanks for sharing!!!

I really hate when people change up recipes but I have always made my enchiladas close to these and had a can of cheese soup and wanted to try this recipe. I added chopped onion to the meat mix, and then a can of chopped chilies. I also soaked the tortillas with red enchiladas sauce and they followed the recipes with the exception to adding the cheese soup instead of the cream of mushroom. I also used the four cheese baged cheese instead of the cheese listed here. With the incorporation of the cheese soup and yogurt and it made my normal enchiladas fantastic. Thanks so much.

I made these with cream of mushroom and sour cream instead...I know I know, I changed the recipe. These changes allowed for a nice sauce inside the enchiladas. Although these enchiladas were decent the first day I cooked them, they were EXCEPTIONAL two days later after the ingredients had a chance to meld. I will be making these again.

I didn't care for this dish and neither did my children. The tortillas completely tore apart after rolling and there wasn't sauce that the traditional enchiladas normally have.

BEST ENCHILADAS EVER!! I as well used sour cream and cream of mushroom with monterey jack cheese. Instead of regular rolled up enchiladas i made an Enchilada Pie, just layer ur baking dish with tortillas then meat with cream sauce and you have and Enchilada pie!

This recipe is so delicious. I was a little skeptical with the soup but decided to make it anyway because of the other reviews. I substituted the yogurt for low fat sour cream and added mexicali corn and rotele tomatoes. My boyfriend and I stuffed ourselves it was so good and we have leftovers.

I only gave this a 4 because I did follow the changes listed in some ppl's reviews.  I used sour cream, cheddar cheese, and green chili.  Everyone liked this one made with the changes.

I am giving this a 5 although I made my own changes. Since I can't say how this tastes with yogurt and the other changes I made I thought I'd rate my version... With my changes it was just delicious!

I omitted the yogurt and substituted sour cream.  
I omitted the jalapeno pepper and substituted a small can of diced green chilis.
I omitted the corn tortillas and used flour tortillas instead.

I also doubled the recipe so I could freeze a batch but in doing so I still only used one small can of diced green chilis so it wasn't overpowering in the spice department...

Just incredibly delicious!

This recipe was really good, but I did make a few changes to satisfy my taste buds! I used flour tortillas in place of corn, sour cream instead of yogurt, and I used half taco seasoning, half enchilada seasoning. I served this dish with mexican rice which was a big hit!!!

These were pretty good - I'd make them again, but they are basically a soft taco with really good cheese sauce.  I would add more to the meat mixture, such as tomatoes, cilantro, etc. next time.

I made it twice once using sour cream instead of yogert...the yogert was much better i think the sour cream made it too rich.  overall very good will make again.

This was a great meal. I made a few changes. sour cream instead of yogurt, jalapenos in a jar about 1/4 cup instead of a fresh one. mozz cheese and chedder cheese (we love cheese) flour tortillas. I also added a bit of refried beans to the tortilla before the meat and cheese mixture. This dinner will be a keeper and something we serve regularly.

These were delicious!!  I was skeptical of the cream of chicken soup but it worked well.  I used light sour cream instead of yogurt and low fat cream of chicken.  I also made some with rotisserie chicken instead of beef.  My husband asked me to make "cheesy beefy enchiladas" for his birthday.  He LOVED these!  I will definitely make these again.

This is a really tasty "twist" on the traditional beef enchilada.  I substituted non-fat yogurt and low fat cream of chicken soup.  Omitted the peppers and used flour tortillas (personal preference).... Still came out wonderfully rich and filling.

I used sour cream instead of yogurt, a cheddar/mozarella mix, and flour tortillas (time to clean out the cabinets!)...I also cheated a little with store bought enchilada sauce. I added some to the meat and then stirred about half a cup into the cheese mixture. It turned out really well, even as leftovers the next day!

Really really yummy!  My boyfriend who is normally a picky eater loved them.  I used sour cream instead of yogurt and used 1 cup mozzarella and 1 cup cheddar instead of 2 cups mozzarella, I added some cumin, and I used whole wheat flour tortillas instead of corn ones.  Delicious!

I had to cut the onions and jalapenos (simply because I didn't have them available) and I substituted sour cream for the yogurt. This was such an easy recipe and the smell was divine! My husband came home and had two portions and could have eaten more, except that he wanted leftovers to take to work. Will ABSOLUTELY be making again soon!

I love this recipe!
You read it and you think... Whaaaaat? Cream of chicken soup? But trust me it turns out good. Warm the tortillas first to prevent cracking. There WILL be leftovers. Make sure you put sauce in the inside and cover the tortilla on the outside.. Otherwise they will be dry. Serve with SALSA because this recipe is not the least bit spicy (In my opinion) It is definitely amercanized.. but its still good.

This was a big hit with my kids and my husband (no small task, I assure you!).  I, too, substituted sour cream for the yogurt and flour tortillas for the corn tortillas.  This is going on the permanent rotation for us.  Thanks, Vanessa!

This did not have a Mexican taste at all.  I was totally grossed out eating it.  It was way too salty and I didn't like the cream of chicken soup taste - way too overpowering.   Will never make again. Yuk!

I've made this dish a few times now and thought it was time to rate it.  DELICIOUS!!!  I like it better each time we've tried it.  I have used 10in tortilla shells and prefer cheddar to mozza.  I think I will also replace the yogurt with some sour cream.  Super leftovers!  Tip:  grease your dish well.  Thanks for sharing this dish, Vanessa!

This was delicious! I added a some diced tomato when I was rolling them up. Found that it made about 12 enchiladas using the small size torts. Cheesy, beefy, creamy and good.

I was really unsure how this was going to turn out after I made the cheese mixture but it turned out fabulous.  I added minced garlic and another jalepeno pepper (still wasn't enough kick, but thats just my personal preference) and I used a mixed taco cheese instead of mozz, as well as sour cream in place of yogurt.  Also, I used larger (10 oz) flour tortillas.  The edges got a little brown on the top where I didn't have the cheese covering it and the bottoms ended up kind of hard (I would recommend some Pam for the dish) but they were so good it didn't really matter all that much.  I will definitely make this again.  I fed it to my boyfriend and 3 of his hungry co-workers and they all loved it too!

Great recipe!  I just used flour tortillas instead of corn and I added two jalepenos instead of 1 for a hotter flavor.  Next time I'll try a mexican cheese mix instead of mozzerella just to see how it tastes.  It's a really simple dish to make, but looks and tastes like a lot of effort went into it.  Super!

My family loved these, but I too made a few changes. Since my husband does not like sour cream and that is what I had on hand (rather than the yogurt), I used 1/2 the S. cream and 1/2 can of the condensed soup. I added 1 can Enchilada sauce (1/2 can with the cheese and S cream mixture and 1/2 can on top). I used shrededed Mexican cheese and added chopped black olives on top.  We will be having this dinner again soon!

These were very tasty.  I used both mozarella and cheddar cheeses.  One jalapeno didn't add any spice - I would increase it if you like even a little bit of heat.

Very tasty!  I used flour tortillas since that's what I had on hand, and I also added sliced black olives.  You don't need salsa, sour cream, or any other toppings for this - there is plenty of the  yogurt/cheese sauce to cover the enchiladas.

This was a nice easy supper. I think next time I'll use cubed chicken breast meat though. It's a personal preference but ground beef paired with creamy sauces aren't my favorite.  I served this with salsa which really helped to cut the richness in taste.

I made these using Mrs. Espy's Sauce and had to throw them out without eating them.  The sauce just ruined them.  I'll try to make them again using some other kind of enchilada sauce.. the filling and doing the tortillas that way was a good idea..

I have never made anything mexican except tacos and taco dip....this was easy and wonderful. My fience was really impressed and so was I. It was wonderful. I also used flour tortillas and heated them in the microwave first so they would fold easier. I served mine with lettuce, salsa and sour cream. A complete meal with refried beans and spanish rice.

These were fantastic! Anyone looking at the recipe that is hesitant about the ingredients - don't be! The yogurt, chicken soup, etc makes it! We used both corn and flour tortillas and both worked really well! Thanks so much for this! Will definately make for company on Mexican night!

These were great!!  I also used reduced fat sour cream instead of yogurt and also used lowfat soup.  I used only 1lb of hamburger and had enough for 9 enchiladas!  Great change of pace from traditional, will make again!

These were really yummy!  Made them for a Mexican fiesta night w/ friends and all were impressed! The corn tortillas did tend to crumble a little bit but they turned out just fine!  I too substituted sour cream for the yogurt and also diced green chiles for the jalapeno!  The meat mixture was also enought to fill more like 10 tortillas rather than just 6 like the recipe states!  Yum Yum!  A keeper!

Talk about EASY! I had leftover beef from hamburgers we made & I'm glad I found this recipe. I, too, was a little thrown by the cream of chicken soup, but it sure made for a tasty sauce (and I'm a "red sauce fanatic," so that says a lot.)I used half mozz/half cheddar, used up some extra fresh spinach by shredding that along with some cilantro and threw it in with the beef mixture. Served with dollops of sour cream and a side of salsa - excellent!

I have made these several times already by the request of my husband. I always use sour cream and half mozzarella, half chedder. I sometimes use mushrooms, chicken, or shrimp in place of the beef and it is always great. This one is a keeper!!!!

Since I don't like enchiladas w/ the red sauce I was thrilled to find this recipe.   I used sour cream since I did not have plain yogurt and I added 1/4 cup of salsa to the meat.  Turned out great!!! My husband and I really enjoyed these enchiladas.   Thank you! :o)

These were great. I was a little concerned-- cream of chicken soup with beef?--but these are fantastic. As a bonus, I had all the ingredients on-hand. Like some of the other reviewers, I too used sour cream instead of yogurt, but it was fine. Quick, easy & delicious.

Great recipe, very easy to make, and very filling.  I used sour cream instead of yogurt, flour tortillas instead of corn, and they came out super.  Next time I will add a red enchilada sauce once they come out of the oven.  All in all, a great recipe.

I really liked it but it didn’t mention black olives in the recipe even though they were in the picture. The sauce tasted great but the color was very light instead of the usual red sauce.

I made this recipe as instructed.  I served the enchiladas with sour cream and cilantro.  I made a side if refried black beans.  I had a guest from Mexico for lunch.  He raved about my  lunch.  I changed nothing and it was delicious.

Substituted cottage cheese for yogurt (because I didn’t have plain yogurt on hand) and they were delightful. Hubby loved it!

Thanks for a great recipe. I did make a few changes. I swapped the yogurt with sour cream, used both canned diced chiles and fresh chopped,  seeds removed jalapeño. I fried my tortillas before dipping in the enchilada sauce. I made a casserole instead of rolled for lack of time. Tortillas, soup/sour cream mixture, meat, cheese, sauce., repeat. Finish with tortillas, cheese, sauce, green onions, olives on top. Cooked according to original recipe. This recipe was absolutely delicious the BF and I loved it! Thanks again for the original recipe and all the reviewers suggestions as well! This is a keeper..

My family loved this,  I did  modify the recipe. I increased the hamburger mixture to make more, diced yellow onion and a can of mild green chili’s.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 can fiesta nacho cheese soup, 2 cups sour cream,  low-fat Mexican cheese  and fat free cheddar cheese.  Super yummy.

Ok, I made this this afternoon for dinner. Wife loved it. I was kind of perplexed as to why we weren't using any enchilada sauce or black olives on top... so, made it as directed. The meat was tasty and the cheese sauce was very good. I couldn't find CORN tortillas at my local Food Lion so had to use the flour kind. Not sure if I didn't cook it long enough, 25 min, or what went "wrong" but the tortillas were "soggy". However, it was all good paired with spanish rice. I would have eaten it all but wife said no. Mmmmmmm, lunch manana.

I’m Mexican-American and I thought this was the worst Enchilada recipe I’ve ever tasted.  I wouldn’t even call them enchiladas, it was a mixture thrown together.  I had to throw them out.

This was terrible. Substitutions included tuna instead of ground beef. Allergic to cheese so used leftover kale. Instead of cream of chicken soup used homemade vegetable stock. Didn’t have taco seasoning so used just garlic powder and a pinch of cinnamon. Instead of tortillas used manicotti tubes which looked like enchiladas but tasted like pasta. Don’t know what I did wrong. Will not make again!

There are no words for how un-Mexican this recipe is.  I will give the author props for at least using corn tortillas which is the proper tortilla for enchiladas.  Why use canned soup,  canned enchilada sauce, packaged seasoning,  yogurt and mozzarella cheese?  Not Mexican.  It might be a good recipe but it is not Mexican by any stretch.  I know because my family is Mexican.  People make this stuff because they don't know how to make traditional Mexican food.

Why would you use mozzarella cheese in a Mexican food dish? I would think Jack cheese or cheddar would be better and sour cream instead of yogurt. Seems to strange for me to try as submitted. With some changes could possibly be okay.

Added sliced olives inside the enchiladas and garnished on top. Made the night before, covered with foil for 30 min and baked uncovered 20 more min. Husband and 12 year old son loved it.

Verrryyy good dish! I did add a little more water to the meat while it was cooking just so the taco seasoning could be absorbed a little longer. Also like many other reviewers I used sour cream and added a little cheddar on top while it was heating up just to make it prettier. Keeper! thanks

Let me preface this by saying, I hate to cook, but I’m trying to turn over a new leaf. I used the indgredient and measurements as provided in the recipe, except I used sour cream instead of yogurt and flour tortillas instead of corn. Making this dish was easy until I had to roll the enchilada. Apparently I can’t roll an enchilada to save my life, so after a few tries, I have up and made what I will call....an Enchilada Pie. It was delish and I will definitely make it again.

I layered mine more like a casserole because I didn’t have time to roll them. I used the 1lb ground beef. Next time I’ll use more. The soup and sour cream made a lot!  I stuck with the mozzarella cheese like the recipe called for. It was good!  Even my picky children liked it.

bland. I didn't like the soup, yogurt, mozza. I would have changed the cheese and maybe used sour cream like others did. I won't make this ever again.

Using sour cream and cream of mushroom soup were the only two changes I made since I had them on hand. Oh, and I used 1 lb. venison burger since my husband hunts. It’s just the 2 of us and this dish reheats really well for leftovers!

This is my go-to recipe, but with a few changes. Personally, I really like sour cream instead of yogurt. Admittedly, I've never made it with yogurt, but sour cream just sounds better. There is way too much meat mixture and cheese mixture for just 6 tortillas! I usually buy a 20 or 30 pack of tortillas and use most of them. Also, I always use red enchilada sauce over the top. Otherwise, they are dry. Good recipe though.

Really yummy! Definitely staying in the rotation. I used picked jalapeño because I had that on hand. Also swapped out the yogurt and used sour cream (they were out of plain yogurt at the store) and used flour tortillas. Doubled it to make more to have leftovers.

My kids and husband loved this dish. I did follow some reviewers suggestions and substituted the peppers for the green chilies, the yogurt for the sour cream and the corn for flour tortillas. I also added enchilada sauce to the bottom of the pan and added some on top to give it more of a wet, juicy enchilada feel.

I made these substituting sour cream instead of yogurt. I used tortillas from the local tortillaría, warmed on a skillet before being used in the dish. Man this dish was great. Kids argued over who got the last one. We will be preparing this again.

Made it for my family since I’m on a restricted diet.  All but the pickiest kid enjoyed it.  The wife said 4 stars.  The oldest said 5, and the middle kid said 0.  The baby ate a whole one by herself, so that’s a 5.  She kinda picky too.  Looked and smelled delicious!

Everyone enjoyed the "lasagna" for the delicious taste and plentiful amounts. ( I wasn't able to make individual enchiladas because the tortillas I bought were too small.) The only thing I changed was the amount distribution for each ingredient. I will make this again, for sure!

I added red enchilada sauce to it and it was even better. Try adding it to the bottom of the dish and a little on top

I made this dish as written, and unfortunately I wasn’t that impressed. The dish wasn’t horrible, but it’s not something I’d make again. I found the cheese mixture to be sort of gummy, and the beef filling was a little on the bland side. The amount of time and effort that went into preparing the dish just wasn’t worth it considering the quality of the finished product. I’ve had frozen burritos and enchiladas that were just as good.

I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken because that's what I had in the pantry.  I liked the mushroom and will stick with that substitute next time.  Instead of using fresh jalapeno, I added chipotle sauce to the cheese mixture.  I used shredded cheddar and topped with shredded cheese over the cheese mixture, which got nice and brown in the oven.

I was worried about making these considering it uses cream of chicken soup. I was correct. They just had a strange taste. Definitely better recipes out there. I won't make these again.

Easy to make, and sooooo good! All 5 of my kids liked them too (which is a rarity). After taste testing the beef mixture, I added some salt, pepper, and cumin so that it wasn’t so bland (depends on what type of taco seasoning that you use I suppose). I also garnished with some lettuce, tomato, and sour cream...out of this world!

I was looking for recipe for enchiladas that were not too spicy...my mom finds any enchilada sauce spicy. Like other reviewers I worried about yogurt with cream of chicken soup to make enchiladas but these were super easy and super yummy!!! Only change made was adding jalopenos to my individual serving at end instead of cooking with ground beef. Thanks.

the portions are all off. 1 and 1/2 pounds of beef for 6, 6 inch tortillas? incorrect.  Cheese mix didn't taste half bad but overall an incorrect recipe. You'd be better off finding another more thought out recipe.

I followed the recipe pretty exactly with the exception of using flour tortillas and a Mexican blend of cheeses. I did also make a homemade red enchilada sauce to line the baking dish with and pour a little on top. My husband and daughter loved them. I thought there was way too much of the cheese mixture which made it seem like they were all cheese. I will definitely make these again but use less of the cheese mixture. I think I will try some pickled jalapeños on top as well. With those modifications I think it would be a five star recipe. It would be great with shredded chicken as well.

My kids loved this. It was a good change from chicken enchiladas.  I didn’t have yogurt so I used sour cream, jalapeños so I just skipped them, or Mozzarella so I used a Mexican cheese blend.  Turned out great. I really don’t think you can mess this recipe up.  It’s definitely comfort food.

It's a really good recipe, I substituted cream cheese since I had no plain yogurt on hand. I also used a mixture of white and yellow cheese since that's what I prefer on Mexican recipes. My family enjoyed it and I will be making again, I'm considering adding yellow corn to the ground beef mixture right after it's cooked for some different texture and flavor.

I added enchilada sauce as it was definitely missing something from the recipe.  Also 1.5lb of beef is a bit too much.  A pound at most is all that's required.

This is a really great alternative to our usual "taco Tuesday". (Really any type of Mexican Tuesday) My son and I thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I made a few changes, some as per suggestions from other reviewers, some because of what I had on hand. I did not have green onions but I fried about 1/3 of a vidalia onion with the ground beef. Once the beef was nearly browned I put a can of green chiles into the meat mixture and opted not to use a jalapeno. Also, I made my own taco seasoning instead of using a pre-packaged one. (Once I started using the "Taco Seasoning 1" recipe from this site, my son asked me never to use pre-packaged again.) Then with the cheese mixture, I used sour cream instead of the yogourt and I had some pre-shredded cheeses including "tex-mex" and "habanero". I used a bit of both. After spraying the baking dish with Pam and assembling in flour tortillas, I baked for about 15 minutes and then topped them with additional shredded cheese and baked for another 10 minutes. My son loved it so much he requested the leftovers for breakfast the next morning!

My husband is such a picky eater, and he loved it. Wants me to make it again. I can see using chicken or shredded beef , and just keep this as my basic recipe. I did use sour cream because I only had flavored yogurt, and I drenched the corn tortillas in green enchilada sauce, and then poured the rest of it over it before baking.

Never made enchiladas before and these were great.  My husband really liked them too.  Followed the recipe almost exactly, except for the yogart that I substituted sour cream. I also didn’t have any taco mix on hand so I made my own using a recipe from All Recipes.  Thanks!

This was good and even my picky 11 year ate two servings. However, the sauce is very thick and not what I was expecting. And the main picture has some sort of red sauce...how??  There isn't anything red in it.  I did add some taco sauce to the beef and to the cheese/soup mixture. I added seasoning to both as well, b/c there was no levels of flavor.  It was ok, but I think there are better enchilada recipes out there.

Didn’t have plain yogurt. Omitted it.
Used half ground turkey and half ground beef.
Added a can of diced tomatoes with chilies to the meat mixture.
Used about 1 1/2 cups of medium cheddar and 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheeses. Added a small jar of salsa to cheese mixture.
Poured a can of enchilada sauce over the casserole before putting in the oven. 
Baked 30 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncovered.
Topped with sour cream to serve.

I was not a fan of this recipe. I made it as written but didn't have quite enough of the cheese mixture to have it all covered. The taste just didn't say enchilada to me.

I only switch out sour cream for the yogurt because I always have it on hand. Stick to everything else! Especially the mozzarella.

I love this recipe. The only change I made was I used jalapeno relish in place of the jalapenos. I will certainly make this again.

Very good dinner.  This was easy and fun to make.  Just let me add a little tip;   Since some corn tortillas that are bought from the store, has been on the shelf and dried out.  As such, the tortillas may be brittle and fall apart when you roll the enchiladas up with the filling.  I suggest that you take a little bit of time to slightly heat the tortillas up prior to rolling.   I used a little bit of olive oil, by brushing it onto the tortillas while heating them up made the tortillas easier to roll with stuffing in the enchiladas.   It also allows the cheese and spices to soak into the tortillas easier.       Either way, I enjoyed the recipe

My family LOVED IT!!!  I made a batch big enough for 10, used 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of mushroom soup (only because 1 can was in the wrong spot and I didn't realize it until after I opened the can - but you couldn't tell by the taste), also used lg can of Diced Green Chilies instead of Jalapenos, and added 2-3 TBS of fresh minced garlic.  Also added extra cheese on top! Yummy! Yummy!  Yummy!!!

Made some changes and it turned out perfect! Substituted sour cream for the yogurt. Shredded 1 cup sharp cheddar and 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Softened the corn tortillas by stacking them and wrapping in a damp paper towel then microwaving for 1 minute. Used a can of red enchilada sauce and dipped both sides of the tortilla in the sauce before adding filling. Sprayed pan with cooking oil first. Topped the enchiladas with the cheese mixture, any leftover meat, then the rest of the can of enchilada sauce. Shredded additional cheese on top, and added sliced olives.

This was really good, especially the leftovers!  I wanted to give some to my mom, so upped the meat to 1 lbs each of ground beef and Turkey,  and used 14 tortillas.  This meant I had to add about 1/4 cup sour cream, as I'd used up all my yogurt.  I also added /3 cup Hernandez guacamole salsa to the creamy mixture.  That really added extra zip!  Instead of the jalapeno, I used a can of diced green chilies, also added a can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes with chilies, and some fresh chopped cilantro.  Also, only had just a  little mozzarella, so used that and 2 cups of shredded Mexican cheeses. Topped with scallions, olives, cilantro and the bit of mozzarella I had.  It was so good!  Writing this review makes me want to make it again tonight  ;).

This recipe is easy to put together and adjust to your taste, and the result was delicious. I used a 4.5 oz can of chopped green chilis in place of the jalapeno pepper and added about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of tomato puree to the sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. It's a keeper.

Great. I  was dubious about the cream of chicken soup-don't be! They were creamy and pretty nearly perfect. I made as given, then poured 2 small cans of red enchilada sauce over them, sprinkled with shredded 4-cheese Mexican cheese, baked about 30 minutes then topped with sliced black olives and chopped spring onions, and served sour cream on the side. Spanish rice was also a side dish. Highly recommended.

Easy and delicious! Like many others, I substituted sour cream for the yogurt. I also put some enchilada sauce down on the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking - a small can was more than enough.

I replaced the yogurt with sour cream. These are easy and inexpensive to make. I add enchilada or taco sauce to the sour cream/soup/cheese mixture for a bit more flavor.

I was pretty nervous about this recipe because honestly it sounds awful. But I made it with no changes except a can of green chilis tossed into the meat. These were so freakin' good. Husband and kids loved them and they're so easy. I will make them all the time. I microwave corn tortillas for about 20 seconds before filling and rolling them. Seems to keep them from cracking.

I made and am reviewing the recipe as written, although with some tweaking, this could be 5 Star. As is,it was somewhat dry although the cheese mixture is genius and very good. I would have liked more of it! I would have never have thought of that combination. Changes I’d make: definitely drain the grease from the hamburger mixture and spray Pam on the baking dish before you place enchiladas in it. Warm the tortillas before you roll them or they crack and look messy. (Still taste good though!)  Pour some salsa on them and then top with the leftover cheese mixture and bake. Sprinkle diced tomato and sliced black olives and top with sour cream as you serve.

We both loved this dish.  I altered it to suit our tastes a bit.  I added diced onions, garlic powder, salt, pepper and diced bell peppers to my hamburger meat as I browned it.  I also used large size soft flour taco shells (what I had on hand).  After I drained my meat (2lbs to make up for the larger shells.) I added a small can of hot green chilies and 2 envelopes dry taco mix to the drained browned hamburger meat as well as a can of drained black beans.  I used  sour cream in place of the yogurt,  used shredded taco blend cheeses, the soup and some mozzarella cheese.  Rolled meat and cheese mixture in shells put them in a greased baking dish and topped them all with the remaining cheese mixture and added sliced black olives.  Baked for 25 minutes.  Hubby and I both had seconds and can hardly wait for leftovers tomorrow.  Will be having this often!

This is delicious! My family loves it and it's super easy to throw together. Definitely a winner in my house! I have made it multiple times. I use sharp cheddar or a Mexican blend of cheese instead of mozzarella and I typically use sour cream vs the yogurt.

Prepared this dish exactly as posted. My husband and I loved it.  I did heat a small amount of oil in pan for large corn tortilla shells heating them for 3 seconds on each side to make them pliable and easy to fill without cracking.  Delicious! Thanks!

First time home making enchiladas and I was not disappointed with this recipe. I believe next time I might make some changes to make it my own, but an awesome base.

This is great the way it is, but today I changed it up quite a bit...i didn't have all the ingredients. I used one cup mozzarella cheese and one cup Italian blend cheese and I changed the cream of chicken soup to cream of celery and used flour tortillas. On top of the cheese mixture I put a 16 ounce jar of salsa and sprinkled some extra Italian blend cheese on top.  I have to say I like my version better.

I used sour creme instead of yogurt.  Topped with olives and scallion tops.  Next time I'm going to use 8 inch corn tortillas.  Too much meat for small tortillas.  My wife liked them so I will make this again.

These are YUMMY!  I only made a few changes to use what I had on-hand:  
Flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas,
Sour cream instead of yogurt,
Yellow onions instead of green onions,
Three blend mexican cheese instead of mozzarella,
Green chilies instead of jalapeño pepper.

I'm Hispanic and am used to my tia's delicious homemade enchiladas.  I'm no where near them when it comes to skills in the kitchen, which is why I'm here on AllRecipes.  These enchiladas were delicious!  My husband loved them!!  I, like others, did change some things.  I used flour tortillas, i also substituted a can of green chilis for the jalapeño and sour cream for the yogurt.  I also added a small can of red enchilada sauce because that's how I like my enchiladas.  One other thing, the recipe says to add meat and then the cheese mixture.  I found it way easier to spread the cheese mixture on the tortilla first AND THEN add the meat.

I used ground turkey, onion soup, reduced sodium taco seasoning, flour tortillas, onion and minced garlic. I always over season "taco meat" with Mrs. Dash, oregano, and cilantro. I loved that these were "dry", just like Mexican restaurants. My boys liked them also. Don't forget the Pam spray!

I made this for a pot luck luncheon and it was well received.  The luncheon was at a senior center and some were sensitive to the spicyness.  This was probably because I used a brand of taco seasoning that I hadn't used before and did not know how spicy hot it was.  I have mixed up the taco seasoning  from this site and will use that next time.  One nice thing is that you can reduce the spicyness to your own (or your guest's) taste.

After reading several reviews, I made a few adjustments and love this recipe.  I spray a 13x9-inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray, then use a regular onion, chopped, in place of the green onion, colby-jack in place of the mozzarella, and light sour cream in place of the yogurt.  I wrap my tortillas in damp paper towels and warm in the microwave to make them pliable.  I spread about 1 heaping tsp. of the soup/sour cream/cheese mixture on my tortilla, then spread with the meat mixture and roll up.  I get about 12-15 enchiladas this way.  When I'm done, I add one can of enchilada sauce to the leftover soup/sour cream/cheese  and beef mixtures and spread it all over the top of the enchiladas.  I cover the top with more cheese and bake, as directed.  Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro and green onions.  Very tasty and versatile recipe.  Thanks, Vanessa!

So I did this with coconut oil to grease the pan. I used whole grain spinach tortillas and then green chilies instead of jalapeños. SUPER yummy!! And so easy to switch up.

Very Good! I did use the suggestions about  substituting the sour cream and  I used a can of drained tomatoes with green chilis instead of just the green chilis because thats what I had on hand. I forgo  the jalapenos because I didnt want it hot. Family loved it. We will have a repeat performance in the near future as well as making it to my cookbook of favorite recipes.

These were certainly quick and easy to make, but I found them a tad salty on the account of the soup and taco seasoning. My 4yo loved it though, so will probably make it again, just not very often due to the sodium content.

Pretty good enchiladas for last minute plans. I used sharp cheddar cheese for more flavor. The cream of chicken mixed with yogurt and cheese made a good, creamy filling. I recommend topping the enchiladas with some salsa to give it a little extra pizzazz.

I gave it 4 stars because it tasted good, but I don't know what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exactly, but mine looked nothing like he picture. The reddish meat sauce didn't come through to the top, and it looks like there are black olives on top, but that isn't in the recipe either. Mine was all white and sort of dry. As I said,  I followed exactly as stated.  Any help would be appreciated,  because I don't know anyone who cook Mexican food, and I've only had it a couple of times in my life.

My 10 year old kids really liked this.  It's a mild Mexican recipe they'll love and easy enough to make in a pinch.  To add a bit more flavor and kick, next time I'll try Monterey Jack cheese on the adult side of the baking dish.

It was good. My family liked it and would eat it again. I substituted sour cream and green chilies as well. (may  add chilies and jalapeno next time) I however made the mistake of dipping the tortilla in enchilada sauce as another reviewer suggested. Don't do that! I believe that may be why they turned to mush. However, I do like the addition of adding enchilada sauce on top and maybe a little less cream soup.

I followed the recipe as printed and the tortillas cracked and broke while I was filling them and before I could put them in the pan.  I also sprayed the pan with Pam beforehand.

This was sooo good! I used precooked rotisserie chicken instead of beef, plain greek yogurt, and I topped them with gaucamole, sourcream and salsa for serving. Yum!

I followed the recipe with some changes.  I used sour cream instead of the yogurt.  Used 1 1/2 packages of the taco seasoning with 1/2 cup of water.  My husband and adult son ate it  but asked me not to make it again.  I was surprised there was no enchilada sauce.  It was very dry but did have the soup mixture in each enchilada which helped.

*Sprayed the pan with Pam
*Browned the beef with a whole onion
*Per other reviews I dipped the corn tortillas in warm enchilada sauce
*Used sour cream instead of yogurt (didn't have yogurt) 
*Used Rotel green chiles with tomatoes (love tomatoes and spice)
*Added spicy jack cheese to the mozzarella (love spicy jack) 
*Tripled the recipe to fill the shells and to get more sauce

Was a hit with picky teenage boys and I have been craving it for weeks. Who knew that SOUP would be delicious in enchiladas??

Normally I make recipes as is to give proper credit to the original chef but added personal tastes to this one for more enchiladas, kick and sauce.

As I was preparing this, I was reminded so much of another AR recipe, "Angela's Awesome Enchiladas."  They are very similar in both prep and execution. I followed this recipe fairly closely, only adjusting the seasonings a bit more to appease family tastes. I did heat up the chicken soup/yogurt/cheese mixture and added about 1/4 cup of that to my browned ground beef. I also whipped up the 10 minute red enchilada sauce (AR recipe) as we prefer red sauce over enchiladas. Pretty good for Sunday dinner!

This is delicious! I added a few extras to the gr beef as it cooked including blk olives, fresh chopped tomatoes, and a can of grn chilies. I substituted sour cream for the yogurt and that mixture is delish! I added fresh chopped onions to mine as I packed it only because my husband doesn't like them. I also soaked my tortillas in enchilada sauce and poured some on top as well. I'll be making this again!

These tasted great and were easy to make. I substituted ground turkey for the beef and only used 1/2 of a jalapeño. My 8 year old son was a huge fan! These will definitely be a regular for us.

Except for including cheddar cheese with the mozzarella, I made this as written.  But let's face it:  There has to be a typo with respect to the number of tortillas.  I made 10 (6") enchiladas, and had 1/2 pound of meat filling left over.

Very yummy recipe! I didn't want to take the time to fill each enchilada separately, So I just made it one big casserole. 6 tortillas topped those with the ground beef mixture, then cheese mixture (also added a little salsa to the cheese mixture). Then repeated the layers one more time and added just a little four cheese Mexican blend cheese  (just for a little color) on the top. everyone loved it!

My BF & kids loved this dish. I did use corn totillas but I made sure I sprayed Pam on the bottom of 13 x 9 pan & added about a 1/4 cup of spaghetti sauce on bottom. It was already opened in my frig. I also added fresh garlic when I made the meat sauce, & I added a 1/2 can diced tomatoes with chipotle chilies & used the juice of that instead of water to meat mixture.

Made 11/15 with large flour tortillas, chopped onion, green pepper and some frozen corn,  with hamburger, and taco env. Sauce was FF yogurt, cream of chicken soup and mozz. Would be easier to manage serving with the 6" tortillas suggested in recipe, but with that amount of filling, the recipe would make more than 6 enchiladas. Next time will search for another recipe.  Did not care for the taste of canned soup although the yogurt, soup/cheese mixture moistened the filling and coated the outside of the enchiladas nicely. If made again, continue to add green pepper, onion and some corn with meat, the taco env, FF yogurt and  Campbells Southwest Cheese Soup as some suggested, and change cheese to Mexican mix or Monterey Jack and use smaller tortillas.  Topped with sliced black olives before baking and chopped scallions when out of oven. Serve w Mexican rice.

Delicious!! Used pepper jack cheese instead of mozzarella and a small can of roasted green chilies instead of a fresh jalapeño pepper. Made it like a casserole. Used Pam and put a layer of tortillas on the bottom the meat mixture. I topped the meat with about 1/3 of the cheese sauce mixture, then another layer of tortillas followed with the rest of the cheese sauce. Amazing!!

I changed to chicken breast, added hot salsa to the meat mixture. Also added cilantro to meat mixture. Instead of mozzarella, I used a Mexican 3 cheese mix (same location in store as all the shredded cheese) Used a whole fresh jalapeno as well. once all were rolled and in sprayed pan, before adding the remaining cheese mixture, I added 1/2 a small can of enchilada sauce. Topped with cilantro before severing.

I'm giving this a 4 star rating to compromise.  My husband gave it a strong 5, I gave it a 3.  He thought the enchiladas tasted better than what you get in a restaurant.  I thought they were OK, but not as good as the traditional recipe.  I used white onion and cream of mushroom soup, as that is what I had on hand.  I will try this recipe again using the soup called for in the recipe.

I made this receipt exactly as published, it was okay but needed a few changes for the next time I make it. I want to substitute the cheese to a Mexican cheese,(mozzarella is too bland and Italian) substitute the plain yogurt to sour cream , and add extra spices. I found the sauce didn't seem enough for the top and didn't melt that great. Someone even suggested Campbell's Southwest cheese soup which I may also try if I can find it.

I made these wonderful enchilada's with ground chicken instead of ground beef (to make it kosher), and still it tastes excellent! the cheese mix only came out really liquid, so instead of baking, it was more like boiling..

My family and friends love this casserole! It is my standby to take to pot luck dinners. I use flour tortillas instead of the corn tortillas. Occasonally, I change it up a little by substituting shredded chicken or ground turkey for the ground beef. The chicken is so easy, I just dump the boneless chicken in my crockpot and let it cook for a few hours until it shreds easily by pulling it apart with 2 forks. I also use plain greek yogurt since it is thicker and creamier, and it high in protein.

Hubby and I loved this! I used chopped red onion for the green onion.  I used 6-in. corn tortillas and was able to fit 11 rolled enchiladas into a 13x9" pan. Had a couple tablespoons of leftover beef mixture that I sprinkled over the whole pan, then topped with remaining cheese/soup/yogurt mix. Used Greek yogurt, btw.  Topped with some chopped green onion before popping in the oven. Garnished with chopped lettuce and some taco sauce. Totally delish!

Made exactly according to recipe.  I was skeptical of the ingredients, but wanted to try it out without any other "however"s added or changed by other reviewers.  Turns out, the flavors meshed and my husband loved it just the way it was.  Served with guac and chips.   Five stars!  Thanks for sharing

This was delicious and easy! What I changed was  

1.  Yogurt to sour cream,
 2. Added about 1/2 a can of water (from the soup can - I played with the amount of water to make enough liquid for the tortillas to absorb the sauce.)
3. Used Mexican 3 cheese mixture rather than mozzarella
4. I made this an easier recipe by changing the arrangement.  I took 10 - 12* corn tortillas and cut them into wedges (Tortilla chip style).  I mixed the meat, sour cream, and soup into the the meat sauce.  I added the cut corn tortillas and mixed all of it together.    Sprayed a casserole dish with Pam and put the mixture in.  Used the 2 cups of cheese over the top then baked as directed.  It comes out casserole style.
*The number of corn tortillas you put in will depend on how much liquid is in the meat and cheese sauce.

I have not made this yet but I want to, my only question is: I do not see enchilada sauce on the ingredient list, but the picture looks like it has enchilada sauce?

Spice it up!  Not sure how these are "enchiladas" without the sauce, but a good base recipe for the filling. I try to stick with whole foods as much as possible so I omitted the condensed soup - instead used a cup of organic greek yogurt and 1/2 cup sour cream mixed with 1 cup jalapeno jack and 1 cup sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella. I like traditional enchiladas, so I flash fried a drained 14 corn tortillas and used a large can of spicy enchilada sauce.  I poured enough sauce to cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan, then put the rest in a shallow dish so I could dip the tortillas before filling them. While rolling them I also added 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion to the filling.  Once done I poured the remaining enchilada sauce on top, then added 1/2 cup of mexican queso fresco to the top as well as green chives from the green onion.

I followed the recipe exactly only used ground moose instead of beef and made my own taco seasoning. Sooooooo delish!! Will definitely make again and add this to my recipe book. I had friends from Mexico staying with me and this is what I made them. They were skeptical and kept telling me they weren't real enchiladas. Hahaha they ate the whole pan! Only thing I did differently was I quickly fried each corn tortilla in a little bit of oil before wrapping. That is the traditional Mexican way.

This was delicious!  I was worried about the yogurt, but the reviews convinced me to try it. My son made a claim on seconds after the first bite. My husband liked it, but said he wished it had more spice (I thought it was just right). I will put green chilies in it next time. I layered the tortillas and filling instead of rolling the enchiladas because I'm lazy.

I added a can of tomato sauce to the cheese mixture, also added a little enchilada seasoning to the cheese mix as well, I too used sour cream instead of yogurt, need to make the cheese mixture more runny to make the enchiladas soggier as they are at restaurants

I tried this recipe and I also used a can of chopped chilis instead of an jalapeno. Cooked it along with the beef. And I used sour cream instead of yogurt. And I also used cream of chicken soup with herbs, much tastier!! And the fresh cilantro on top gave it that extra flavor that I thought made it complete!! Great recipe and really appreciate the different inputs and ideas of others, thanks!!

Cooking spray is necessary. I doubled the cheese, using cheddar, used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and had more to pour on top. I left out the yogurt.

Loved this recipe!  I've never made enchiladas before and wanted a quick easy recipe to follow.  Perfect!  The outcome did not taste quick or easy.  The enchiladas were tasty, cheesy, beefy and absolutely delicious. My family raved about them.  I substituted sour cream for yogurt because I already had that in the fridge.  Salsa was added as a final touch on my dish just because I like salsa.  Enjoy!

This is a good base recipe, however we altered the recipe to flavor it to our liking. Here are the additions we made.

1. Sautéed ground beef with 1 diced yellow onion, 1 3oz can hatch green chiles, and taco seasoning. Only add the can of hatch green chiles if you like it spicy. If you live in the Midwest, this will probably be too spicy for you. However it will taste good if you live in the SW

2. Since we didn't have sour cream or yogurt, we used 1/3 cup jalapeno/artichoke dip from Costco as a thickener to add to our can of mushroom cream soup and shredded Mexican cheese. We added 1/2 of this mixture directly into the ground beef after it was cooked. It was easier to mix the cream mixture to the ground beef rather than trying to scoop the ground beef and cream separately into each tortilla.

3. To prevent the corn tortillas from breaking, it's important to use fresh, soft and pliable tortillas. However even fresh tortillas or a microwave will not prevent the tortillas from cracking. Take a skillet and put a little oil in the skillet. Lightly fry each tortillas in the skillet with the oil. Not only will this prevent your tortillas from breaking, but it will also help the enchilada sauce stick to the tortillas when you dip them into the sauce before rolling them up.

4. Pour the remaining half cream mixture down the middle of the pan. Sprinkle shredded 4-cheese Mexican cheese on top with 1/4 cup sliced olives and 2-3 stems of chopped green onion.`

It was a big hit with my husband. I did change the yogurt to sour cream and used a Mexican blend cheese instead of mozzarella. Lastly, instead of the jalapeño I went with green chiles and topped with enchilada sauce.

Easiest enchilada dish and my family loved it. I used corn/flour tortillas (yes, each tortilla has corn and flour) I also added green enchilada sauce to the yogurt and cream of chicken mixture. Added flavor and thinned the sauce. Delicious!

This was really good, I added some sour cream and used it for dipping. The Taco seasoning I used was just a bit to overwhelming and I should have added a bit more of the sauce inside, It was still wonderful :)

Great recipe. Although to the inconvenience of not having all of the ingredients, I switched the yogurt for sour cream, the green onions for regular yellow onions, and the cream of chicken soup for cram of mushroom soup. It still turned out great! There was a little too much beef to fill the 6 tortillas, but that just made a good snack :)

Just made this.  Pretty good.  I used regular onion instead of green, fajita seasoning instead of taco and flour instead of corn tortillas.  I think some cilantro and sour cream on top makes it perfect.

I modified the recipe so that this could be flour less and made in a large pot.   I sautéed onions,  green peppers,  olives and a few tomato slices in a large pot first.   I then added 1 lb ground beef and added homemade taco seasoning.   Then I added plain greek yogurt,  about 4 ounces of cream cheese, a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies,  some half and half, a can of black beans drained and mozzarella cheese.   this turned out like a hearty soup.  Excellent!

Very good recipe. Stayed as true to the original recipe with what I had on hand. Used about two TBSP on dried mince onions in place of green onions, sour cream in place of yogurt, and only had hard taco shells, so I crumbled them up threw everything together prior to baking. Finally, added about a cup of Cheddar Cheese on top prior to baking. Again, very good recipe. I am really impressed how Cream of Chicken soup compliments a beef dish. Would actually be a great dip also. With the meat in it, I am sure it would be a "main" dip dish that could satisfy a hungry crowd at a party. I love spicy food and while not extremely spicy, it suited my tastes. May put more diced jalapenos in it next time. It will be fun to experiment with this dish. Definitely a keeper.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was a big hit with both my husband and my 3 year old daughter.  Based on some of the other reviews, I used sour cream instead of yogurt and a small can of diced chiles instead of fresh jalapeno.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef, in an attempt to make it slightly less unhealthy.  I liked that I could prep it and get it ready to go in a casserole dish ahead of time and then just pop it in the oven right before dinnertime.

This is my first attempt at enchiladas, and wow what a fantastic recipe! I adjusted the recipe based on others reviews, I added a can of green chilies and omitted the jalepeno, a diced green pepper along with diced scallions, to the meat. I used reduced sodium taco seasoning,  and 12 inch wheat tortillas, as well as low fat sour cream instead of yogurt. I was skeptical about the cream of chicken soup, but this is a must have ingredient. It adds a creamy flavor bomb to the cheese mixture, and it is one of those super secret ingredients that makes this dish fabulous instead of just good. I also used half mozzarella and half Mexican cheese blend shredded cheese. I dipped each tortilla in enchilada sauce before I stuffed them as well. Warning***wet tortillas are a bit messy and slippery! But it is worth it. I fit 6 into a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish that I sprayed with PAM, and dumped the rest of the enchilada sauce over the top. Added a few left over dollops of cheese soup mixture and topped with shredded cheddar. I cooked them for about 30 minutes but might let them go longer even next time. I served these with fresh chopped cilantro and diced roma tomatos sprinkled over the top. My end result resembled something from a high end fancy Mexican restaurant and the taste was out of this world! My husband couldn't stop raving about these! I think this is a great starter recipe, listen to the reviews and you have a recipe that will impress guests and definitely a keeper.

This was great! Whole family loved it, even with the jalapenos. I used 1 reg onion and sour cream instead of yogurt and a ton of cheese. Next time I'll add some red pepper to the meat as well.

these are awesome!! next time you want to try a new twist on Mexican, this is it. I used whole wheat tortillas, instead of corn, and added a small can of green enchilada sauce with the yogurt/cheese mixture. my family said they were the best ever. great job on this one!

I would have given this 5 stars but there were so many alterations. I took others advice and used sour cream instead of yogurt. Also I used half Mozzarella cheese and half Gouda cheese. I'm a huge fan of Gouda cheese and I needed some more cheese for this recipe anyway. I used chili peppers instead of chili's. I bought the chilly peppers by accident not really knowing there was a difference between that and regular chili's. I also added a little ketchup to the meat/taco seasoning mix and used regular onion. Everything came out fabulous! I served it to my 8 year old son and he absolutely raved about how good it was. He wants me to tell the whole family the recipe and wants me to teach it to his kids when he gets older and has some. LOL. I have to say that was the best review I'd ever heard. My son pretty much wants this enchilada encoded into his DNA he loves it so much. I will definitely make this again. If you want to follow my version just make sure to only use half Gouda. Too much Gouda might make this too salty.

Fantastic! I used what I had (didn't intentionally substitute)--fat free sour cream for the yogurt, ground turkey for the meat, and a small can of Ro-Tel for the jalapenos. The only issue I had was with my 6" corn tortillas--they *all* broke after I rolled them up. (That never happened when we bought fresh tortillas in San Antonio--alas, maybe Northeastern PA isn't the tortilla capital.) I ended up having a ton left over after doing 6, so I got out a package of flour fajita tortillas and made about 8 more. Served with chopped lettuce, onions, and green and red peppers for garnish--absolutely lovely. Husband gave two thumbs up.

Mistakenly purchased mini tortillas so I did a casserole with this recipe versus enchiladas. It was great. I was hesitant about this because of the chicken soup but I was pleased. I swithced out a half cup of the cheese for pepper jack for a bit extra flavor.
I also used to small cans of salsa verde, picky....don't like it to dry or to moist. it turned out PERFECT. 
It was just enough filling for an 8X8 and an 11X7.
Oh! I also did not use taco seasoning cause I'm already going above 
and beyond with the sodium in this but I used some NO salt seasoning on the beef and added an extra serrano pepper, 3 large garlic cloves and generous sprinking of organic red pepper flakes that make Everything Good : )
I will definately use this again. I picked the meat out this time but next time will make a veggie version for self and the meat version for
my family. And I did olives at the end and forgot the cilantro. I LOVE cilantro, will not forget next time! THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE.
This is first time I haveever commented. Never learned to cook, this site has changed my domestic bliss to include the kitchen area!!! THANK YOU FOR THIS SITE.  Also....didn't use the green onion, used equal parts of white and yellow.

Try this with American Cheese! 
Ok, yes i didnt follow the recipe exactly like its listed, but it was soooooooo good. The only thing i changed was i used american cheese instead of the mozzarella cheese. I also used sour cream in place of the yogurt. This was so good. Also i put salsa on top as well. yummy!

Very good. I substituted a can of green chilies for the jalapeno (what I had on-hand) and used 8 flour tortillas in a 9x13" pan. Plenty of filling and the family loved it.

Great recipe. I used sour cream instead of yogurt.  I also substituted white onions and a mexican blend of cheese.  I also kept approx 1/2 a cup of the cheese to the side to sprinkle on the top.  I made 12 enchiladas with the mix.  Also, if you have trouble with the tortillas drying out when cooking, try dipping the corn tortilla is hot oil for 2-3 seconds before filling.  Makes them a little softer and lets you roll the tortilla without it breaking or tearing.

Made this recipe last night and was a little disappointed.  the cheese sauce never quite melted or became "saucy". Perhaps it would help if you slightly heated the cheese, yogurt and soup before assembling the casserole.  I will try this again since the taste was pretty good.  I was just wondering if anyone else had the same problem...

I was skeptical about these ingredients, but this turned out pretty good!  Not very spicy, and very creamy.  I used sour cream instead of yogurt, and a can of diced chiles instead of the jalapeño.  I used WAY more than 6 tortillas.  I think I wound up with 12.  Perhaps I didn't fill them up as much as I should have.  Pretty good for a family dinner.

Very yummy! I used sour cream instead of yogurt, just b/c thats what I had on hand. I put pepper in the sauce, and a can of rinsed, drained black beans into the meat mix, and let them cook with the taco seasoning... I also omitted the jalapeno. This turned out Great, and I have since made it a cpl more times. And the pan is aways cleaned out.

Great!  I only changed it up by using sour cream instead of the yogurt and fiesta blend cheese instead of mozzarella.  Really delicious!!!

The weirdness of this recipe intrigued me. So I tried it! I love the cheese sauce. I used sour cream, no yogurt. This recipe took care of my enchilada craving perfectly, thank you!

I didn't use the onions, or jalapeno pepper, but I followed the recipe to a t.  Well I also used the sour cream instead of yogurt..YUMMY.  Everyone loved them. I also think it is a must to cover the enchiladas with the extra cheese and meat too, helps.  Also make sure to stuff the enchiladas, makes them tasty!! Loved it..thanks again.

Yummy is all I can say.  I added a can of chopped jalapenos because I was lazy and I didn't want to chop one, and I used sour cream instead of yogurt.  I also had beef and filling left over so I just put it on the top and baked for 40 minutes covered then uncovered it and baked for 10 more minutes so the top would get a little crispy.  So so good.  My bf ate all the leftovers already and wants me to make another batch today.

Yum! Made these with ground turkey, threw in a little enchilada sauce that needed to be used up, added corn to the mix and wraped in whole wheat tortillas. Will be making these again!

Not bad!! Even my husband, who's not a big fan of cheese or sour cream enjoyed this. I did substitute the yogurt for sour cream and omitted the jalapeños.

Great easy Enchilada recipe.

Pretty good! I love the creamy sauce. I used Greek yogurt instead of regular American plain yogurt.  If you *are* going to go by the recipe and use yogurt, use Greek if you can because it's very creamy, much like the consistency of sour cream.  Also Monterrey Jack cheese, to me, has more flavor so I used that instead of mozzarella cheese.

This was excellent! I made it with flour tortillas and cheddar cheese. It was a little sloppy getting out because the flour tortillas are soft but they tasted so good no one cared what they looked like!

We added onions, green pepper and garlic to the beef, and hot salsa to the cheese mixture, with a 'mexican 4-cheese' instead of mozzarella.  Overall, pretty good and we enjoyed it, but the chicken soup gives a little bit of a weird flavor.

I am making these for the second time tonight.  My family squealed in delight when I told them.  This time i am using Healthy Chioce cream of chicken soup and turkey instead of ground beef.  This will lower the fat and sodium content quite a bit.  The jalapeños can be served alongside for those who want them.  All, Greek yogurt is a fantastic and very healthy substitute for sour cream.  If you have weight issues at all I sous recommend sticking with the yogurt.  Enjoy!!

Simple and delicious! Considering my husband and travel alot and mexican is our favorite cuisine,we have ordered enchiladas from restuarants throughout the lower 48.  This recipe ranks right up there in the top 10 in our book.  Like others, I used sour cream instead of yogurt and added onions to the ground meat.  Also, I traded queso cheese for the mozzarella.  DELICIOUS!  Will definetely cook them again.

I had a new container of yogurt that was about to expire so I searched & found this recipe.  I originally gave this recipe 2 stars because I could taste the yogurt in the finished product the first day & I hated it.  The second day I couldn't taste it all & it was great!  I only made two changes to the recipe 1.) using fresh roasted hatch green chile instead of jalapenos & 2.) using sharp cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella.  I also served these topped with lettuce, tomatoes & guacamole.

These turned out good.  I did use sour cream instead of yogurt.  I also ended up using 1 more can of cream of chicken and 1/2 of sour cream.  Im glad i did becuase I think it woudld of ended up a little dry.  I will for sure make these again as my son and hubby really liked it.

I only give this a 4 because I added enchilada sauce to the bottom and top of the dish which made it perfect! Without the sauce I thought it would have been way too dry.  I also used kraft's "authentic mexican" cheese and it was DELICIOUS!

This was a great recipe but I did modify it a bit.  Because I was serving it to my spice-weary kids, I left out the jalps.  Instead of yogurt, I used 1/2 cup light sour cream and 4oz of Neufchatel. (LOVE the cream cheese flavor in mexican dishes) I also used %98 Fat Free crm of chicken soup and a mexican cheese blend instead of mozz.  Definitely spray the pan before putting them in.  Also, before covering them with the cheese mixture, I spread a layer of salsa on top.  YUMMY!  Next time I will try it with chicken.

This is absolutely great!  I served this to Dutch people..who don't eat this kind of food, and it was gone in 1 minute!  I changed it a bit by using flour tortillias and did not find chicken soup in Holland and used cream of mushroom instead...it was wonderful!

Great recipe!!! I used the king sized corn tortillas which I think add more flavor then the flour tortillas. I also sprinkled the green onion over the top of the entire dish. Yummy!!!

Delicious! Even my picky-eater boyfriend loved this! I prepared exactly (minus using a 9 x 13 pan) and it turned out great! This recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing!

Awesome recipe! I just changed the jalapeno to green chilies and the yogurt for sour cream and it was the best enchiladas that me and my husband  have ever had!

these enchiladas were a big success. i decided not to use the full can of soup, more like a quarter, and i heated my tortillas in canned enchilada sauce. heating them this way makes rolling a bit tricky, but totally worth it. i made more than the recipe suggested, because i know my family has a big appetite, but they finished almost all of them- a big cheesy spicy delicious plate of goodness.

Followed the recipe exactly, except I don't own a 7x11 baking dish, so I put in a 9x13 and had room for a couple extra tortillas, which was fine, since there was more than enough meat mixture.  The cheese sounded strange to me, but the exceptional meltability of the mozzarella made a very creamy enchilada sauce.  Yum!

These were good but not exceptional.  I would make them again but not often as they are very rich.  They were better with red enchilada sauce drizzled over the top.  Next time I think I would put some enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan before baking.

Just made this for dinner, its creamy and delicious!  Left the recipe as is except for using green chiles instead of jalapenos.... love how easy this is and not too many ingredients. Can definitely be tweaked for personal preferences too.

Awesome! Used sour cream instead of yogurt and mainly green chiles (just a little jalapeno too) so they weren't too spicy for the kids.  I made extra and froze them!  We're really looking forward to having these again!  Thank you!  =)

These were absolutely delicious. It had a bit too much cheese sauce then i'd have liked but it was still really good. Next time I won't add as much.

Tim made these! Used sour lean rather than yogurt and reduced fat mexican blend cheese rather than mozzarella. Also used flour tortillas. One enchilada was plenty for me (very filling). Suggest adding refried beans next time.

Overall, this dish was just okay.  I'm not sure why this recipe is so highly rated.  It was a bit too rich for my taste, and the chicken soup really took out any authenticity that the dish might have otherwise had.

I used chicken seared in olive oil with taco seasoning instead of ground beef. I could only find flour tortillas. I divided a can of refried beans amongst the enchilladas as well. So yummy, quick and easy compared to most enchillada recipes, and i loved the creamy white sauce on top, sprinkled with cilantro to complete!

Easy, delicious recipe!  The changes I made were using sour cream instead of yogurt and added a can of enchilada sauce to the soup mixture to help thin it out a bit.   I spread a bit of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of a light sprayed 9x13 dish to prevent sticking. My 4 year old son loved it!

Good, I have a similar recipe that calls for chicken instead of beef,  adding 1/4 tsp cumin to the sauce, using flour torts, and cheddar/jack cheese. I tried this recipe, and even though good, the chicken one is better

My kids FINALLY liked an enchilada recipe.   I think the reason this is a winner is it used the cream of chicken soup and mozzaralla cheese blended so well with the spicer beef/jalapeno mix.   I did put some enchilada sauce and some cheese on top while it cooked.  I'll definitely make again.

This was delicious.  We are vacationing and I didn't have a big enough pan to roll the enchiladas so I layered this like lasagne...flour tortilla, meat mix, cheese mix, repeat.  Had to use sour cream instead of yogurt.  Very good.  Will make again.

This recipe was great! Very easy to make, and was ready to go in the oven in about 15 minutes.  The only change I made, like many others have said, was using sour cream instead of plain yogurt (mostly because plain yogurt tends only to come in large containers, whereas you can buy a small container of sour cream).  I was a little dubious about using condensed cream of chicken soup, and mozzarella cheese in this recipe, but I used them as mentioned in the recipe, and it was truly delicious.  I'm keeping this recipe to use in the future!

I thought it was a simple recipe and tasted very good.  I don't like to cook with processed food, it would be nice to find something to use in place of the canned soup.

wonderful wonderful recipe.  The only thing I changed is that I make a red enchilada sauce, and dip the tortillas in the sauce before assembling.  Then pour a little more sauce over them, then top with sliced black olives and fresh cilantro!  the whole family loves them!

So delicious! I pretty much followed the recipe the way most everyone else did. Ground beef and some onion. Didn't have yogurt either, so i used sour cream. I also put a litte bit of enchilada sauce on top of the enchiladas before i put them in the oven to give them a little extra zing and then added some fresh diced tomatoes at the end. SO YUMMY!!!! My husband scarfed it down and said that HE was taking the leftovers to work (we'll see about that!).

I liked these enchiladas, but my family loved them. Even my picky 12 year old devoured an entire plate of enchiladas that I served with Mexican rice and refried beans. For that reason alone I will be adding this to my recipe box. For what it is worth I do have a few suggestions. If you drain your meat after browning it, you will need to add more than ¼ cup of water when you add the taco seasoning. It will cook off, but you need enough water so that the seasoning gets to all the meat evenly. I didn’t have an entire cup of plain yogurt on hand, so I added sour cream to make a full cup and that seemed to be fine. You definitely need more than 6 tortillas. I probably used 10-12 that filled a 9x13 dish. And to make the tortillas pliable enough so that they don’t crack while rolling, wrap them in a damp cloth towel and heat them in the microwave for @ 2 minutes. Be careful of the hot steam when removing from the micro.  The two outer tortillas that touch the towel will not be usable, but the rest are steamed to perfection and easy to work with. Simple recipe that will please most people.

This was an overall good enchilada recipe.  My husband described it best by calling it a mix between a taco and another "soupy" enchilada I make. I currently have two staple enchilada recipes; the previousy mentioned "soupy" version and a spicy sour cream red-sauce version.  Although this was good, it just isn't going to replace the other two. Glad I tried this through!

I was a little leery of a recipe for enchiladas that contained condensed chicken soup, but the enchiladas were delicious.  I ended up using cream of mushroom soup and my own mix of spices instead of a packet of taco seasoning (cheaper).  I also put regular white onions in with the meat b/c I didn't want to buy green onions.  It was well received by my family.

After I printed this recipe I went to the freezer and found no ground beef. I used chicken breast instead, boiling and shredding the chicken before adding it tp the spices and water. It turned out wonderful! I'll try it next week with beef. Thank you!

These were overall very tasty.  However the only problem I had with rolling up my corn tortillas was that they would tear as I was rolling them up.  I did heat them up before hand to make them more plyable, but it didn't seem to work.  Still very good though!

A friend shared this recipe with me.  While I thought the combo of beef with chicken soup sounded odd, I tried it and is sooo good!  I also added a can of black beans to mine.  Definately a new family favorite!

Very good!  I took other suggestions and made a few minor tweaks.  I used 1 can of green chiles rather than the jap. I made the taco seasoning mixture since had none on hand (used easy recipe on this site).  I used 1/2 c plain yogurt and 1/2 sour cream.  I poured green enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan so enchiladas would not stink and it added a very nice flavor.

This recipe was easy to make and delicious!  Like others, I added chiles instead of jalapenos.  I added a little cholula and cumin to the cheese mixture on top of the enchiladas, just for an extra kick.  Next time I'll use low-fat cream of chicken and yogurt to spare some calories.  The flavoring is so good, I don't think we'll even notice the difference.  Great recipe!

We LOVED this recipe--so easy!! I used only 1 lb. beef and chose sweet onion over green onion, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I was tempted to throw in extra stuff because it seemed "too easy"...but I didn't, and it was delicious just the way it's written!  Excellent reheated, too (I'm eating the leftovers now)!

This recipe was great.  I did do a little tweeking....I used sour cream instead of yogurt, like someone else had suggested.  I also added green chiles, in place of jalalenos, and black beans to the meat mixture.  I used flour tortillas and dipped each of them in enchilada sauce before filling.  My husband loved it too!

Tastes great with low-fat cream of mushroom soup and low-fat sour cream (instead of yogurt).  My boys (2 and 4 years) loved it!  Taco sauces in the bottom of the pan worked well as another reviewer suggested.

These were weird. Granted, I am from New Mexico and I knew these would not be traditional New Mexican enchiladas. I think a better name for the casserole would be Taco Casserole. I sub'd sour cream for the yogurt like others suggested and I think that was a great idea. Also, I bought cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, it still turned out well. 
All in all, an okay recipe.

Very good recipe!  The only reason I give it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because i love dipping my enchiladas in salsa and this creamy recipe doesn't go with salsa - but aside from my personal preferences I this recipe is great as written and i will be making it again.

This recipe is amazing! I did make a few changes. My meal plan went from serving two people to seven without another trip to the store, so I used 2lbs of ground beef. I had a ten pack of corn tortillas and I sliced them into fours. I then lined the bottom of my 13x9 pan with tortillas, then a layer of meat, then a layer of the sauce mixture (I used sour cream instead of yogart and used half Mozzarella/half Mexican Blend for the cheese) I was able to layer it all 3 times and then added another sprinkling of shredded cheese on top of the entire dish. Baked it for 20 minutes and perfection! This was great! and everyone loved it! Even sent the wives home with the recipe! This one is definitely going to be made again!

VERY Good!! surprisingly delicious for really so few ingredients! And I just loved the creamy sauce on top...I was out of yogurt, so I used half-n-half (which I know is high fat, but it was all I could come up with)...anyway, my three year old AND my 13 mo old ate it!  I also used a whole chopped poblano instead of the jalapeno.  Excellent recipe, I will make it again and again I'm sure!!

I gave this recipe 5 stars b/c it tastes absolutely delicious.  I used flour tortillas and it still turned out great.  I suggest cooking at a higher temp...just be sure to check often.  Next time I will try it with chicken.  If you are big on appearance, this recipe looks disgusting.  Taste weighs more than looks with this one.  1lb of meat is enough.  Last, I used sour cream instead of yogurt.

Really good!  I made this because Plan A for dinner didn't work out and I had everything on hand for this.  The only change was I substituted fresh jalapeno for dried habanaro reconstituted.  Insignificant change.  My 8 year old wouldn't stop eating!  Even my picky husband admitted that it was good.

We loved this recipe and being from Texas we know our enchiladas!!  I did substitute sour cream, topped with lots of cheese, and dipped my corn tortillas in hot oil prior to filling. I rolled 8 enchiladas, then used the remainder for a small one dish layered casserole for leftovers.  It would have easily made 12 enchiladas.  YUMMY!

I used only 1 lb. of ground beef and used sour cream instead of the yogurt.  I also used 1/2 can of the cream of chicken soup and added 1/2 can of green enchilada sauce.  Used flour tortillas instead of corn.  For the cheese I substituted cheddar, jack, and a little mozerella.  Great recipe!  I was hesitant to try because of the soup, but it is really good.  Thanks!

I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for a different way to fix enchiladas.  I wasn't quite sure how cream-of-chicken soup would taste on enchiladas.  However, all the reviews of this recipe were good so I tried it.  They turned out so good I have since replaced my enchilada recipe with this one.  They don't look very gourmet when they come out of the oven, however, they taste great.  Absolutely wonderful recipe!

These are great. I have made them twice now. I double the recipe except only use 2 pounds meat but more would be fine for 8 inch shells. I use no-fat sour cream, low fat soup and 2 percent mixed Mexican cheese. I do like regular enchilada sauce so I put some in the bottom of the 13 X 9 inch pans and pour the rest on top of the cheese sauce. Yummy, thanks for the great recipe!

Good Stuff. I gave it a four becasue I eat with my eyes...and it looks gross once you scoop it out of the pan. I also found that the recipe could easily be cut to 1lb ground beef.

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made this time and again and it is a favorite in my house.  The only ingredient I change is sour cream instead of yogurt.  I also heat up refried beans and layer the beans, meat and then cheese/soup mix inside the tortillas.  To make it extra cheesy, I sprinkle a heavy dose of cheese on top before popping it in the oven.  The extra cheese and refied beans make it de-lish!

These are really great!  Very easy to make and so tasty!  I use Monterey Jack, Colby, and a little mozzarella for the cheeses.  We use chicken instead of beef and actually prefer that in our house (though it is still delicious with the beef).

I used Dyann's suggestions to make this a little healthier and my hubby and I enjoyed these very much. The first time I made these, I used cream of mushroom soup and I will go back to that next time. This will be one of my regulars.

I have been searching for an enchilada recipe to try for my first time, and this was the best! My very picky fiance loved these. He heated some up last night and said the only bad thing about them were that there weren't any more! I of course substitued the yogurt for sour cream, dipped the tortillas in enchilada sauce, and drizzled a little on top. Topped them with the extra jalapenos that were left over in the can, and added lots of cheese during baking time! What a wonderful recipe! Thank you soooo much for sharing!

Tasty..tasty!  I made a few minor provisions.  I used the combined cream of mushroom and chicken can of soup which I think was amazing.  I also omitted the peppers and used a can of diced green chilies.  I sprinkled the remaining meat ontop when baking. MMMM..also don't need quite as much meat.

These were very good! I was a little scared to make it with the odd mixtures, but I followed someone else's advise and put in 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 yogurt with the cream of mushroom. I also added 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 sharp cheddar cheese. The servings say 6, but I made it for 3 and there was none left over!

I gave it 4 stars...but not from lack of taste. I didn't think it made enough sauce. Next time I make this I will add more & also try using flour instead of corn tortillas. I did use sour cream in place of the yogurt. I will make this again... good recipe. Thanks!

This is a good recipie but I would suggest substituting the yogart with sourcream.  I made it both ways and my family did not like it at all with the yogart but loved it with the sour cream.  I added a can of chillies to the ground beef in place of the peppers.

I wouldn't say it was fabulous...it was okay but probably won't be on my favorites list.  Most of you out there are rating your own recipes - not this one.  It was good for something a little different.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe and it was a hit!!  I was making this to feed some starving (picky) kids and they absolutely loved it.  The white sauce was a interesting change from the enchilada sauce I am used to.  Everyone loved it... A+ from my family. Thanks!!

Delicious! The whole family loved these. Our 3 1/2 year old exclaimed "Mom, make these everyday!" I was a bit skeptical about using the cream of chicken soup, but decided to give it a whirl. I could not even detect it in the finshed product. I used a whole milk locally produced plain yogurt. It worked great. I did add about 1/3 of a cup of salsa verde to the sauce. It added just a bit of tang. I think these would be great with chicken or even a vegetarian version with beans. This was a nice change from the regular red sauce. You gotta try them.

Easy and delicious!  My family loves this one.  I substitute jack for the mozzarella and sour cream for the yogurt, and also use flour tortillas but that's just how we like it.  Great recipe, thank you for sharing!

Since we love to eat Mexican, i fixed this, and my husband actually said that he liked it!  Will fix again in the near future, but will probably cut back on the yogurt, husband said it was a little overpowering!  Tastes even better when you reheat the leftovers!!  :)

This is actually a real good recipe for a quick meal. I was wondering if the yogurt was going to give a weird flavor but you couldnt taste it! I would make again. I didnt put any of the cheese mixture into the tortillas, I just put it all on the top and still came out good. I was just in a rush!

My first enchilada recipe, and I wasn't that impressed. The taste wasn't spectacular, and the  tortillas stuck to the bottom of the pan, burned on and rock solid because I didn't know you're supposed to put a bit of the cream soup mixture in the bottom. The jalapeno pepper actually gave me acid burns when I chopped it raw, and my hands hurt for days - NOTE: the acid burns out in cooking, I guess, because it wasn't as nasty to taste cooked as it was raw, but I'm not kidding about the burns. They REALLY hurt for two days - protect your hands. All in all, I found another recipe that I like a bit better (Chicken Enchiladas V) which is a perfect base recipe to which you can add or subtract as you wish - tastes better and not so friggin' painful ;}~

Like many others, I was wondering how the chicken soup would be when combined with the yogurt and cheese, but it was great!  I would use a combination of cheese next time, perhaps taco cheese or something with a wee bit more kick. It's certainly not a "pretty" dish, but you can jazz up the presentation a bit with some salsa drizzled along the top and perhaps green and black olives as a garnish - cilantro would be great, too!  This turned out to be MUCH better than I thought.  Wonderful!

So amazing, wonderful texture. Only change was to dip the tortillas in enchilada sauce before filling & rolling, and to pour the leftover sauce on top of the casserole before baking. Will make this again and again.

Fabulous recipe! I took the advice of other reviewers and used sour cream instead of yogurt, cut the mozzerella cheese back to 1 cup and used a mexican cheese blend for the second cup, and used flour tortillas. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef (our preference). My husband loved the kick from the jalapeno pepper and I adored its cheesy goodness! I'll definitely be whipping this up again very soon. Thanks for sharing:)

This was really good!  However, I made some changes.  1- Sour cream instead of yogurt.  2- Medium Sharp Cheddar instead of Mozzerella (I didn't have any mozzerella).  3- Whole wheat, low carb tortillas instead of corn (personal preference).  4- No jalapenos for us - we don't like that much heat.  Also, I put a thin layer of salsa on the bottom of the 9x13 pan (I doubled the recipe) to keep the enchiladas from sticking.  All in all, it was delicious.  Normally my family doesn't like leftovers, but there was a race to see who'd get them in their next day's lunch.  This dish didn't look that great when it was finished, but it's yet another example of not judging a book by its cover.  It made my whole family very happy!

This is our families favorite mexican dish.  It is just spicy enough to satisfy my hubby, but still mild enough for the little ones.  The only change I make is using flour tortillas (personal preference).  Absolutely delicious!

We really like these, although I also thought that mixing the chicken and beef would be a weird combination.  I like to use freshly grated pepper jack cheese instead of the mozzarella and 1 and 1/2 serranto peppers for a little more heat. In order to keep my tortillas from cracking, I keep a little skillet on the stove heated under med high heat and throw the tortilla in the dry skillet for about 10 seconds.  This keeps everything together.  I have used both full fat and low/non-fat versions of the soup and yogurt and honestly, I think that the lower fat options make a better sauce.

These were very good and very kid friendly.  Both nephews loved it.  Like the other reviewers I used sour cream instead of yogurt and then made one batch beef and one batch chicken.  This is very quick and tasty.

I think it's the creamy mixture that really makes these tasty.  My modifications were using flour tortillias, sour cream & Campbells chili verde soup.  I also added mexican spices to the ground beef.  Had leftovers for lunch the next and I think they were even better.

It was good. I followed some reviews - sour cream instead of yogurt, used some flour and some white corn tortillas, Southwest Pepperjack soup instead of chicken soup. Next time I will bake them shorter than 20-30 minutes. The ends got crunchy, and definately didn't taste like enchiladas (my husband even joked that I invented "enchilada-tacoes", but overall meat tasted great...

These enchiladas are as good as you'll find in a restaurant!  I took the advice from other reviewers and used sour cream instead of yogurt, skipped the jalapeno and split the shredded cheese into 1 cup mozarella/1 cup cheddar. Soft flour tortillas were the perfect touch and don’t forget to use non-stick spray in your pan for easy clean up.  My husband doesn't care for white sauce (soup in this case) so I used enchilada sauce in a jar and he was full of compliments over the dinner!  He wants them made when guests come to visit...SCORE!

This is another one of those recipes that I find so often on this website that I get requests for all the time. I was kind of skeptical when I learned that cream of chicken soup was an ingredient in a Mexican dish, but it turned out excellently. Everybody loved it and let's face it people; the reason we all love to cook is for positive reinforcement.

A lot of the reviews commented that using the cream of chicken soup with ground beef sounded weird but it was good.  I disagree!  If I make this again I will surely use chicken instead of beef.  The sauce was good.  I would add some green chiles to the sauce though.

We had different ratings for this.  I didn't like it at all (I won't touch the leftovers) -- if I tried this again, I'd use chicken because the creamy sauce was OK.  My husband cleaned his plate (and ate the rest of mine too).  Still looking...

My husband and 3 year old loved this.  I'll be making it again.  I used green chilies instead of Jalepeno and sour cream instead of yogurt, and used a cobly/monterey jack blend for the cheese. All of which I already had on hand.  Worked great.

Very good recipe! I did make a few changes, however.  I used fat free sour cream instead of yogurt, chicken instead of beef, left out the jalapeno pepper, and used flour tortillas.  Also, I used 1/2 mozzarella & 1/2 cheddar cheese. I'll definitely make it again!

I love this recipe!  I have given it to others and had comments that it tastes delicious!  It's great as-is, the only change I made that does taste better is I used Monterey Jack cheese instead of Mozzarella, and I don't add green onions because I don't care for them.

My wife said these were better than hers. That is pretty good because she gets compliments on hers from everybody. I used sour cream instead of yogurt and added a little cheddar to it. I also used mild green chiles because my mother-in-law does not like hot stuff.

These were very tasty.  I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion to dip the tortillas in enchilada sauce before filling.  I poured the left over sauce over the top before baking.  I also used sour cream instead of yogurt.  Great recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed these!  I have always enjoyed enchiladas with a white sauce (and you can't get any easier than the white sauce in this).  I used 1/2 Cup sour cream, and 1/2 Cup plain yogurt.  It was fantastic!  Next time I will try with all yogurt... I'm not sure it needed the sour cream.

Thanks Vanessa for a great recipe.  I made a few changes due to four kids and a mother who isn't into "spicy."  I deleted the peppers.  Two of my kids and I don't care for the sour cream, so we did use the yogurt unlike the suggestion of many others.  I also used half Jack cheese and half Pepper Jack cheese.  I dipped the corn tortillas in oil and then in a separate pan I dipped it in red enchilada sauce.  Pour a small amount of the red sauce on the botton to prevent them from sticking.  Top the enchiladas with the red sauce and the remaining cheese.  With the kids and a husband who loves leftovers I made 24 enchiladas and I'm so glad I did.  There was only a few left!  I used 3 lbs. of ground beef and it was all used up perfectly.  The combination of the ingredients, however odd, tasted fantastic.  I will definitely be making this again.

Good recipe!  Diced green chilis are a great substitute for jalepenos.

We both liked this and thought it was a great change from our regular enchiladas. We are vegetarian so I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead, and a vegetarian ground meat substitute for the beef.  Loved the zing that the yogurt gave this, and made it seem so creamy!

I made this using 1/2 of the recipe for "Taco Seasoning I" (on this website) for the taco seasoning. I used smaller corn tortillas (even though I have terrible luck with corn tortillas breaking on me). I ended up with 12 enchilladas in a 9 x 13 inch pan. I sprayed the pan with Crisco spray first. I also used the reduced fat cream of chicken soup, which didn't seem to go as far, so I ended up throwing another cup of cheese on top before baking. Everyone loved it, and I would definitely make it again (except maybe use flour tortillas instead).

This is one of my personal favorites not to mention that my boyfriend and both of our families love it!  This is definitely a keeper (although I did use sour cream instead of yogurt)

Excellent recipe with a few changes:  used green pepper instead of jalapeno (all I had on hand), substituted sour cream for yogurt, used monterey cheese instead of mozzarella and flour tortillas instead of corn.  I also poured about 6 oz of enchilada sauce over top and then sprinkled with about 2 ozs of shredded cheddar.  Recipe made 8 enchiladas with meat mixture left over (used for tacos the following day's lunch).  Yummy!  Will try with chicken next time for something different.

Wonderfull! I thought I made sure to make extra so my husband could have some for lunch the next day. No way they were gone in no time. I used sour cream instead of yougert I also used a red sauce under the creamy one. This is the best enchiladas I have ever had. Every one at my house agrees. Thanks a million.

This recipe was a little to sweet and rich for my tastes.  I made it without the jalapeno thinking my kids would eat it then.  My 8 year old did, but the others, no way.  If I do try this again, I think I will mix a can of red enchilada sauce with the filling and see how that turns out.

We just did not care for the chicken soup taste.  I add some green chili peppers and substituted sour cream for the yogurt.  I will use this as a base and top with the White Cheese Sauce from this site and see how that turns out.

Delicious!  I also used sour cream instead of yogurt, flour tortillas instead of corn, chiles instead of the jalepeno and doubled the sauce.  It made 8 enchiladas instead of 6.  My 5 year old asked me to make this again tomorrow!

Wonderful enchilada recipe and very easy too! My husband said it was his favorite mexican dish that I have made so far. The only suggestion that I have is to somehow soften the corn tortillas before adding mixture because mine ended up breaking, but it was still good. I will try with chicken next time.

Pretty good, although I'm accustomed to using a tomato-based enchilada sauce. I loved using the Cream of Chicken soup though. I'll probably be combining this recipe with my own recipe using enchilada sauce. Thanks, Vanessa!

Very easy to make and good. I thought it was weird that mozzerella and cream of chicken soup were going into these. But I didn't change anything. These weren't anything I would serve to guest - but this is a quick recipe that is good enough for me to make again for my boyfriend and I.

WOW!! What an easy dish to prepare! Unlike most enchilada dishes the steps were easy and the taste was fabulous! I used fat free sour cream instead of yogurt, and the result was wonderful. My husband requests this dish on a regular basis! Thanks!

Well this was easy enough that my boyfriend made this by himself while I was napping.  We were suspicious about not needing enchilada sauce, but after trying it, it was completely unnecessary.  This tasted almost as good as the 2 1/2 hour enchilada recipe I had made before.  We also used sour cream and a four cheese mix, which worked out beautifully.  THANK YOU!!!!

This recipe is great!!  Everyone I have served it to loves it.  I generally use sour cream instead of yogurt and Mexican Cheese in place of plain moz.

Pretty easy to make.  I used only 1 lb of ground beef and it was plenty.  Also substituted fat free sour cream for the yogurt and it's delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Wow,color me impressed! This recipe is wonderful. I did however do a few adjustments. I used sour cream instead of yogurt. I also put a tbs of medium salsa on the meat mixture followed by the soup mixture. I also used a tad bit more cheese then the recipe called for. My family loved it!

This was delicious.  I used Monterey Jack with peppers instead of the mozzarella, fat free sour cream instead of the yogurt, and served green chile enchilada sauce on the side.  Very simple and easy. The cheese sauce was outstanding.  My husband loved it.  Thanks :)

These were the best thing that I think I have ever eaten!  I used fresh flour tortillas and I used the sour cream in place of the yogurt.  I think that I love these so much that I am going to make everyone else in the family sick of them because I plan on making them all the time!  Thank you so much!

While this tasted great, the tortillas fall apart far too easily.  I think I will look for a flour tortilla recipe in the future, but will still use this occasionally.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This was so AWESOME!!!! And leftovers were great too! I also thought that a chicken and green chile mixture would be also be a good filling. Yummy!

My family was getting tired of my chicken enchiladas and this was a great substitution.
I did not have yogurt one night and used sour cream instead and substituted 
Monterrey Jack for the mozzerella.  I really like this recipe and tried it with the yogurt
tonight!  We'll see the results in about 30 minutes!!  Thanks Vanessa

Was running short on time so I made a casserole out of this..tortillas then meat then cheese sauce. My husband raved over this.
