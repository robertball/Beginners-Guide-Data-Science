Thank you Chef John! This was a great success, tripled the recipe. Made 36 sandwiches for a gathering of friends. Nothing but compliments and directions to the Allrecipes website.  Cooked the meat and onions the night before. Also prepared the bread. Brought the mixture to room temperature before adding the remaining ingredients the next morning. Prepared the sandwiches before the guests arrived covering with plastic wrap and refrigerating.  Judged when we may like to eat, slipped away and preheated the oven.  With short baking time everyone was able to enjoy a warm sandwich.

Loved this! I used diced bell peppers instead of the pickled ones and added canned mushrooms. I cooked them with the onions. I also used full size rolls instead of the little buns (I made it for a fun dinner) and it was really excellent.

I had most of the ingredients for this leftover in the fridge. Threw it together quickly and topped some toasted sourdough bread with the meat mixture.  Covered that with cheese and melted it in the oven. DELISH!! Hubs and kiddos loved every bite. Thanks Chef John!!

Excellent! It was hard for me to find the perfect sized rolls but used Costco mini dinner rolls and it came out great!

This didn't do anything for us as far as enjoyment to eat. We thought about making some changes, then decided to just make our Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches like we normally would. Nice idea for a change, but I for sure want red peppers not pickled ones. The cream cheese didn't do anything for it either.

This was great! The only change I made was to use jarred banana peppers because I could not find pickled peppers. Yum!

I liked this recipe before I even made it. That’s a good start! Unfortunately, I used a too strong, provolone (Belgiosio). The provolone overwhelmed the ol’ taste buds. I will make again soon, with a mild or medium cheddar. I did substitute with ciabatta rolls. Kudos!

Awesome, my hubby said it was the best home-made sandwich ever! I followed directions as is, although I could only find an 8 oz block of provolone at the grocery...which seemed like plenty enough in the finished sandwich. A 1 lb steak made enough for 2-3 sandwiches on a regular bolillo/hoagie-size roll.
