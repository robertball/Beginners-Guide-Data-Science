Got lazy and instead of making individual enchiladas, lined  a large baking dish with corn tortillas (gluten-free), put the chicken mixture in, covered with more tortillas and covered witht the cheese and cream and baked it, it worked well.

One way to thicken the sauce is to use sour cream instead of whipping cream.

My friends and family have loved this recipe. I made it the first time with the recommended double serving of cream sauce. I definitely think that is necessary.    The second time, I replaced a cup of heavy whipping cream with 8 oz of cream cheese. THAT was pretty amazing. It thickens things up a little and makes the whole dish just a little creamier. Try it!

This recipe is perfect!  OMG, the filling is unbelievable.  The only thing I did different was to not use the red bell pepper.  I don't know what people are talking about with the sauce being too thin...it was perfect when using the exact proportions as written.  Too give this an extra kick, try adding a dollop of sour cream on each serving.  I thought I had the best chicken enchilada recipe.  Not anymore!  This is my new one!!! Thanks for a great recipe! You know, I just went back and read the opening paragraph where the author said she usually doubled the whipping cream and chicken broth.  I think that would make this recipe PERFECT!  Just wish I had read that part before I made this batch, which by the way, made TWO complete meals for a family of four.  I cooked one pan and froze the other.

I made this for me and my husband. Being that my husband will eat basically anything, he thought everything tasted great! However, this recipe would have received 5 stars if the sauce was creamier or thicker.  I even read some of the reviews before I made this dish and some people said the sauce was too thin.  So as I prepared the dish, I added cornstarch to the sauce but it still would not thicken.

These were delicious!!  I used Kraft Fat Free Cheddar for the filling and used regular Monterey Jack on top.  In order to make my sauce thicker I simmered the cream until it was reduced by half and then added the green salsa.  It wasn't so runny doing it that way. I'll be making these again for sure!!

These are great.  My only suggestion is to roast the peppers.  Its also a great way to use left over chicken or even turkey.

Made this for a birthday party last night-everyone enjoyed. I did make two changes: 1. used a rotisserie chicken from Costco for chicken meat - great time saver 2. did not put green chilies in the filling, instead I used them in the sauce which I substituted from another recipe on this site. The sauce is 1/4 c. butter, 1/4 c. flour- melt butter, stir in flour and cook several minutes. Stir in 2 c. chicken broth and heat until thickened. Off heat, whisk in 1 c. sour cream and 4 oz green chilies. Pour over enchiladas and then top with cheese. Bake per recipe instructions. The heat of this dish is on the milder side, so I think I will add green chilies to the filling next time. Definitely will make again.

These were great. I did end up baking them about 45 minutes with the foil over the top of the dish and 20 minutes with the foil removed. I think this helped make the dish even better compared to previous reviews. The sauce was pretty much non existent baking this long because it absorbed into the tortillas. The tortillas were not soggy at all, they were perfectly crisp. The flavor was excellent and we will make again. My husband said this is one of his favorite dishes he has had. They also reheat excellent. YUM.

Outstanding! This is the best thing I have ever made from this website and I have made many items. For those trying to "thicken" the sauce, good luck. It's whipping cream and chicken broth - it's not meant to be thickened up.

We make this recipe exactly as stated, but we only roll about 5 or 6 enchiladas in an 8x8 pan and halve the whipping cream / chicken broth / monterey jack items accordingly. Then we take the leftover mixture and freeze it in 3 separate containters (each holding enough for about 5 or 6 more enchiladas). When we want to make it, we just thaw the mixture, wrap it in tortillas and top with the whipping cream / broth / jack cheese. We eat this twice a month!

Outstanding recipe.

I had to make a few minor adjustments due to what I had on hand - regular salsa, jalapenos, and Mozzerella and extra-sharp Cheddar. Oh, and I used McCormick's chipotle pepper powder. I thought the cream/broth would be too thin, so I heated it up, and stirred in some more cheese. Much better! Thanks, Molly!

It took a long time to prepare, but the outcome was great.  The only thing that I wish could be different is a thicker sauce.  My family loved it!!

I have made this recipe for years and years - served 50 people at my daughter's college graduation dinner with it.  There is some prep involved, but the beauty is it can all be done well in advance.  Then, company comes, or the party starts and about 40 mintues later you have a phenomenal dinner.  I serve it with a black bean and corn salad* with lime dressing.  Garnish the enchiladas when out of the oven with fresh guacamole, sour cream and home-made salsa and serve with tortilla chips to dip and chase the goodies with.  It is great for a buffet dinner.

I use a whole roasted chicken, chill it then shred it instead of the boneless breasts.  DO NOT DOUBLE THE CREAM AND BROTH!  It is not supposed to be a 'sauce' just moisture for the enchiladas.  So much more flavor and so little work.  I am making it this week and finishing the meal with a Pot de Creme made with Kahlua.  I will be the popular girl then!

Pure AWESOMENESS!!! I made the recipe as stated but halved the cumin.  I also seeded the chipotle chilis  so they wouldn't mess with the texture.  My husband loved them he said the flavor was great but he didn't like the feel of the veggies.  I knew he was like that so I browned the onion and bell pepper which added a great flavor element but next time after doing that I will hit them with the blender stick or food processor before mixing with the chicken.  I also added some garlic powder to the mix and the sauce.  And you definitely need a little more sauce, I just poured more cream over after topping it with the cream/broth combo in the recipe...maybe 1/2 cup or so.  So to some it up these were awesome and will be my go to enchiladas.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Thank You Molly!  I cut the recipe in half and still had a tray of enchiladas.  I agree with doubling the whipping cream and broth although I stayed true to the recipe first time around.  My company also loved this recipe.  I used authentic flour tortillas.  The flavor was wonderful.  I made the base a day ahead and rolled them the day of serving.  Left them without the cream/broth until time to go into the oven.  Exceptional!

These were excellent for me.  The wife and kids thought they were spicy. I really enjoyed how the tortillas firm up as if it was fried.  Next time I guess I'll leave out the chipotles and maybe find mild green salsa.  (Which I couldn't find)  These are a little bit of work, but worth it.  I ended up with 10.  (I think my chicken breasts were bigger than the norm)

Enchiladas Suizas is my favorite dish from my local Mexican restaurant and even though theyre not the same, they are still really good! I definitely will be making my own changes to tailor it to my tastes, but I would happily make the original recipe again too.  Makes a lot of food too!

Am I the only one who had trouble figuring out what to do with the chicken after it was cooked?  Shredded it, and then ended up chopping it a little finer in the food processor.  If using 1 chicken breast/person, breast should be small.  I had major leftover filling (not necessarily a bad thing).  Also, I always forget to spray the aluminum foil so the cheese doesn't stick.  Wrote it on my recipe to remember next time.  Like others, I doubled the sauce and substituted 8 oz. cream cheese for 1C whipping cream.  Served w/sour cream on the side at the table.

These were really good, husband and young kids all liked it.  I cut up a whole cooked deli chicken, used about 3/4 cup salsa and 1 chipotle pepper  because I was afraid it would be too spicy for the kids.  Next time I would try the 2 chipotle peppers.  I did double the sauce as recommended.  It made 1 large pan and 1 8x8 pan.  I froze the smaller pan and can't wait to eat them again!  They were great! Even better the next day (the sauce thickens up a bit).

Loved this recipe but I would definitely double the liquid as some say and I always use more cheese.  The big secret here is to make it the day before and heat up next day for recipe at its best and to avoid that too watery look from the cream.

Excellent recipe, if you play with it a little. I read the reviews saying that the sauce was too thin so I melted the cheese into the cream and broth and cooked it on the stove until it thickened a little. I left out the chipotles in adobo partially because I didn't have any but also because I think the flavor may have overpowered the flavor of the green salsa. I can't say for sure how the original recipe tastes, but with my small adjustments they were amazing!

The chicken filling is delicious in this recipe - I could eat it with a spoon. I wasn't so sure about the flour tortillas. They soaked up all the liquid (there was a lot of runny liquid as others have said) and made a mushy tortilla. My son loved this recipe as is, so I suppose a 4.5 star rating is more appropriate. I might better enjoy either a thicker sauce, or a corn tortilla :)

This recipe is very good, although I made quite a few alterations to make it better and easier.

This recipe is super yummy!  Like others, I changed it up just a tad.  I leave out the cilantro, personal preference.  I love the sauce so over low heat I combine 2 cups whipping cream, 1 cup chicken broth and 8 ounces of cream cheese until it is smooth and then pour it over the enchiladas!!  My son requests these every time he comes home from college!

Since poaching(or boiling) the chicken breasts will actually make the chicken breast dry out, try following alternatives:

 - use dark meat (thighs/drumsticks) and POACH gently
 - to save time, buy a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from your super-market
- substitute sour cream for whipping cream
- substitute queso fresco for the cheddar and/or Monterrey jack.  Queso fresco has a texture similar to Italian ricotta.

I was really disappointed with this recipe, since i do have small children I did half of the peppers to minimize the spiciness and even then, it tasted really bland and I totally agree on the sauce being too thin,runny and tasteless, will not be doing this again.

I totally enjoyed this recipe!  I cut it in half since my kids don't eat ANYTHING!  It was nice and moist inside.  I didn't make the white sauce bec I didn't have whipping cream.  Instead I added a bit of salsa w/ cheese to top before baking.  My husband and I like things a bit more spicey than this so I'll prob add another chipotle pepper and/or jalapeno next time. You should definitely try this!

Really good, but watch out if you don't like spicy. I used one chipotle in adobo and it still had quite the burn! I used half and half instead of whipping cream to cut the fat just a bit.

I LOVE this recipe!  I found this recipe (or one very similar) on a different site a couple years ago and it is my number one Mexican dish.  I misplaced my original version, so was happy for find this one on allrecipes.  You can play with the peppers a bit, I omitted the red bell and chipotle peppers simply because I have small children who are picky.  My only suggestion would relate to the sauce at the end.  I sprinkle a generous amount of cheese over the enchiladas.  I then mix the cream and broth as directed, but use my judgement in how much I drizzle over the enchiladas.  I haven't measured exactly how much I use, but I always end up pouring some out.  I think the full amount would be pretty soupy, but that's just me.  I also haven't found it necessary to remove the foil.  Overall excellent!

Wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! I've been making this dish for years and it is a hit - every time! I would normally make a huge batch, make one pan out of the mixture and freeze the rest :)

My husband thought this was awesome, and I enjoyed it, but I didn't like the way the sauce looked at the end.  I think the cream may have gotten overcooked as it separated from the chicken broth.  The enchiladas didn't look fabulous, but they sure tasted great!  I also added sour cream to the filling to make it more moist.  Thanks for the recipe, and I will make it again.

Wow wow wow. I didn't have any adobo peppers so I substituted for 2 finely chopped jalapeños and cooked them for the last 2-3 min with the onions and bell peppers. The meat mixture made too much for 12 tortillas so we had enough leftover to repurpose for a yummy Mexican brunch dish! After 10 min baking without the foil I broiled for 1 additional minute to get a bit of charred bubbliness on the cheese. My husband was so stuffed but refused to stop eating until his plate was clean!!! This was a crowd pleaser we will definitely be adding to our rotation of dinner recipes.

Fabulous recipe. I made a few adjustments though. I boiled the chicken in chicken broth for 10 minutes then set it on low for an hour before shredding it. Chicken came out amazingly moist. I used corn tortillas. I briefly fried the tortillas in a small bit of olive oil to soften them before rolling the enchiladas. I used a combination of queso fresco and Montery Jack cheese for the topping. I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream to sauce after reading other reviews about the sauce being too watery. Husband said these were the best chicken enchiladas he's had... even better than any restaurant.

Made several changes, as I was trying to duplicate my daughter's favorite dish at a local Mexican restaurant. I left out the red, green and chipotle peppers. Used diced cooked chicken I had in the freezer. Used all Monterey Jack cheese (no cheddar). For the sauce I used cream cheese and chicken broth, with a little sour cream. I was able to get 14 enchiladas, so I used 2 11x7 pans and doubled the sauce as recommended by others. The dish turned out TERRIFIC and very much like the restaurant dish. Will make again.

These were very good.  Although the kids didn't want them because of the peppers in them (and there weren't even that many), the adults found these good and quite filling.

FANTASTIC recipe!! We had a little extra chicken filling mixture leftover, so I made little burritos with it throughout the rest of the week for lunches. Definitely enhances the flavor as the days pass! I'm also doing weight watchers, and found if I leave the monterey jack cheese off the top, the taste is not at all inferior... and I save 4 pts/serving.

Make this recipe TONIGHT! :)

I make these all the time! I follow the recipe exactly. The sauce thickens and absorbs into the tortillas, not too thin at all. I have used this filling inside traditional enchiladas as well. AMAZING! These freeze well too (without the sauce)!

Great recipe, I have made this recipe many times in the past 10 years and it has been a big hit each time.  I  make half of the preparation without  chipotle in adobo sauce, for people who don't like spicy food, and double the sauce.  It also freeze very well without the sauce. Then I add the sauce when I reheat them.  When ready to serve, I add fresh diced tomatoes, diced avocado and cilantro on top of the casserole.  Serve with green salad and citrus vinaigrette.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using cilantro. There's cilantro paste in my green salsa, though, so I figure some flavor was there. Never had the chipotle peppers like that and they were so tasty! I'll definitely be using those in other recipes. Kid and husband both gave this a 4 star rating but no one could really tell me how to make it better. We all agree we will have it again. This made a TON so next time I'll definitely cut the recipe in half.  Per the submitter's suggestion I doubled the sauce and I'm really glad I did. I think they would have been too dry otherwise.

This is a favorite of everybody that has them.  I wish the Mexican restaurants would have this on their menus.  Only thing I do is cut back the heavy cream and then replace it with La Crema.  Truly delicious.  FYI this recipe makes 20+ enchiladas.

Great recipe. I doubled the sauce as other cooks recommended, as the filling made 20 enchiladas. I also cooked it longer-45 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered. I will definitely make it again.

This was super yummy. I had a few tweaks: roasted chicken breast on the bone in the oven (super juicy) or use store bought roast chicken.  Instead of adding the green chili's to the chicken, I pureed them in a food processor with the chicken stock and then added the cream. The kicker is to add extra cheese to the top of the enchiladas before covering with the creamy sauce mixture and letting casserole sit for 20 mins before cutting into. The sauce was a perfect consistency!. I wish I had taken a photo :(  Next time!

Great version of this dish.  I omitted the peppers and cumin  since both are hard on my stomach (only kept the green chilies and used mild), and it still came out great.  Bonus points for the fact that it doesn't break the bank to buy the ingredients.  Will make this again.

I made this over the weekend and it was pretty good.  I used regular salsa instead of green salsa and omitted the chipotle peppers because my fiance doesn't like spicy.  I went with what some reviewers suggested and used sour cream instead of whipping cream for the sauce.  I kinda regret my decision because it congealed on top while baking.  Even though the taste was good, it had a funky texture.  But that was my bad and next time, I'll use whipping cream.

We enjoyed it.  I cooked the chicken breasts (used 3 large ones) in the broth of one can. The broth was reduced to 1 cup, which was exactly enough for being able to double the cream and broth.  I forgot to buy cilantro - that might have improved the taste!

I made this for 13 people, doubled the recipe.  Everything was perfect.  For the sauce I did 1 cup of sour cream, 1 cup of whipping cream, and 1-1/2 cup of broth.   I boiled it over low heat to thicken.   I didn't want it too thick but not too thin.  It soaked up perfectly.
