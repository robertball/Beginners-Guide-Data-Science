FYI: According to Jacques Pepin on one of his TV shows, if you blanche the basil briefly it will not oxidize and therefore will retain its green color. I would imagine this would hold true for the spinach as well.

My hubby and I thought this recipe was delicious.  Its fast, easy, and much lighter than a regular pesto sauce.  I forgot the olives but it was still good.

I thought this was a great variation on typical basil pesto.  Sometimes I find the basil and pine nuts too strong.  The spinach and walnuts mellowed it out and the olives were a nice addition.  I only had parmesan cheese so did not use romano.  It was delicious!

This is a wonderful pesto. The addition of black olives added another dimension. I followed the recipe exactly except I used aged gouda cheese instead of the Romano.

Excellent! Tried this for the first time with the Pesto Tuna Salad with Sun-Dried Tomatoes recipe on this site, resulting in an unusual and very tasty dish that was a hit at our house. I used about half the cheese called for in the recipe.

Maybe I didn't do this recipe right but I thought it was TERRIBLE!  Mine came out a pasty whitish grey color, which was very unappetizing.

I halved the recipe, which amounts to about a cup or so. The only thing I omitted were the pine nuts; they are somewhat pricey and I don't particularly care for their flavour. That said, I increased the amount of walnuts to compensate. I used 1/4 cup of sliced black olives from a can and reduced the Parmesan to an equal amount as the Romano. I upped the garlic to 3 large cloves. I may have used a little more EVOO as I maybe have used a tad too much spinach. I love how the spinach mellows the basil a bit, as it can be an overpowering flavour. The sample spoonful I took tasted amazing; can't wait to see how it pairs with my pasta and pizza dinner I have planned later this week. Most likely going to be my go-to recipe for 'green' pesto!

It's really good on bread & i'm gonna try it on pasta later, but by itself it tastes like the ingrediants should be more balanced out. So i reccomend using less cheese and less garlic, maybe more basil. Only because some of the flavors overpower the others.
