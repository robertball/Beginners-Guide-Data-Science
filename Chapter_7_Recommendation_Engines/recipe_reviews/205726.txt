My whole family gave this a thumbs up. I used all the same ingredients, but changed the methods. Using bone-in thighs, I removed the skin, trimmed the fat, and seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper. Then, I just mixed all the other ingredients (minus butter because I didn't cook the onions beforehand) and poured it over the top and baked it at 360 for about an hour (just until the internal temperature reached 170). Cranberries were WONDERFUL in this, and the meat was so tender and flavorful just like it was slow-cooked. went with steamed rice. DELISH! Update: passed this recipe on to my friend who is a beginner cook and she said "it was a hit" with her family. Thanks again for posting this. I now keep whole cranberry sauce as a "regular" stock item in my pantry!

I submitted this recipe, and I just wanted to add that I usually use chicken breast (I feel the contrast between the moist cranberries and the white meat is better than if it were brown meat) and I also use red wine vinegar (I'm not sure where they got apple cider vinegar from)and the chicken is great with steamed rice, thanks Andrea J!

Turns out I didn't have any chicken, but I did have some meatballs frozen.  I did the sauce and put them in the crockpot.  6 hours later on low it was fabulous!!!  This is some awesome stuff!

Whole family liked this, my husband LOVED it.  I used the chicken breasts and baslamic vinegar (didn't have red wine vinegar) after I read what  misscarolb wrote as corrections to the original recipe she submitted. I cooked everything at 350 because I used boneless breasts and a pyrex dish.  I forgot to add the brown sugar, but it didn't need it, as it was very sweet without it.  I misread the recipe and took the onions right out after cooking them at the beginning for 15 min. and put them into the sauce, but it still tasted fine.  I turned the chicken in the butter so both sides got some, and baked covered with foil for about 20 min. Then I put the sauce on and baked covered about 10 more minutes. I took the cover off for the remainder of the time until the chicken was 165 F inside. Lots of delicious sauce. Great with rice.

I just made this tonight and paired it with mashed potatoes. I used 1.5lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs and kept the sauce measurements the same. The step of scooping the onions into the sauce, what about the chicken broth already in the dish with the chicken? I combined it to the cranberry mixture because the instructions didn't specify not to. This might be the reason why my sauce was a little on the soupy side. I must add that the overall flavor is a little too sweet. I will definitely be making this again but will be using less sugar. The flavor is tangy, sweet and sour, it reminds me of BBQ sauce, in a good way.

Good, but not amazing.  The good thing is, it was very easy to make.  However, I thought the combination of flavors became one big oniony-ketchupy mess.  Certainly more than tolerable, but a bit unnatural.  I think the vinegar, onion and ketchup detracted from the subtle delightfulness of the cranberry.  Still, most people would rave about it.

I used chicken tenders and ended up using a 14oz can of cranberry sauce.  My entire family - including young children like it.

This was a nice change from the usual, though I would not make it again for chicken.  My husband mentioned that it would be good on a beef or pork roast.  I think it was just too sweet and it seemed to overwhelm the chicken.  Maybe I'll try to use it on a roast next time!

I made this twice and omitted the sugar the 2nd time I made it. I like cranberries, but this is still really, really sweet.  Just FYI, the recipe says it feeds 6 people with 3 lbs of thighs.  I weighed out 3 lbs of thighs and it allowed only 1 thigh per person.  My family is not made up of huge eaters, but everyone would want 2 pieces, since they're only thighs.

Pretty good!  I added a tsp of balsamic and reduced the ketchup (personal dislike of ketchup).  Could have used minced garlic added as well.  Hubby says to keep this on file!

Pretty good flavor, although I suspect that you would want to drain the chicken fat before adding the sauce so it doesn't make soup.  I used distilled vinegar, and might add a little garlic too next time and a little less ketchup maybe.  Would definitely make again!

I really liked the sauce, but wasn't all that crazy about it on the chicken.  Weird, I know.  :)  I wonder how good this would be mixed with cream cheese as a spread.  Hmmm ... I wonder ... :)

My family loves it. We live in Thailand and we are used to spicy food. I added about 1 1/2 tablespoon of chili powder in it. It tastes great. Thank you for sharing!

I pan fried the onions because I was pressed for time.  I made this recipe leaner by transferring the chicken to a fresh baking dish and discarding the accumulated fat before adding the sauce mixture (after the initial 25 minutes of baking), and by removing the skin before serving.  I was hoping to cube and toss the leftovers into a wheat berry salad, but alas, there were no leftovers! :)

Kinda weird...or maybe just different. I used left over homemade cranberry sauce in place of the can but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was a good way of using up the leftover cran.sauce but i wouldnt go out of my way to buy a can and make this again. It was just ok.

This recipe was given to me 42 years ago by my mother in law. I use chicken breasts (slice them  smaller so each person can have one)  sauted then removed to a baking pan. Sauce is made by combining/ cooking all ingredients and pouring over and baking until done. Serve with rice, green veggie and salad. 
Yum! Great for Christmas. Can easily double for party.

Too sweet! \The second time I made it, I used tomato paste, 1/4C brown sugar, and fresh cranberries. I threw all the ingredients in the food processor and spread it over the chicken, and it was much better. The next time I might try roasting baby carrots in the baking dish along with the onions.

We loved this, and the sauce is yummy. I sauteed the onion and butter in a frypan then tossed the rest of the sauce ingredients in-put the boneless, skinless thighs in the oven for 20 min. took them out covered with the sauce and cooked uncovered 25 min. longer. Oven was set at 350 (I over-looked the 400 called for in the recipe)and there was a lot of juice so I upped the temp to 400 and baked 10 min more- when I took the pan out the sauce thickened up, so maybe I shouln't have added the extra 10 mins. Most cranberry sauce in a can is 11 oz. which I used. I have tried recipes that call for dry onion soup mix; but we really liked the fresh onions in this as is less salty and fresher tasting. Goes good with cooked rice.

Love this recipe. It's sweet and tangy and easy to prepare. On weeknights I prepare it the night before and keep the final 20 minutes of cooking for when I get home from work. I've also put the sauce on the raw chicken and cooked it for 45 minutes straight. Comes out great either way.

This was ok.  It was a bit on the runny side; maybe I did something wrong.

Excellent recipe!!! I switched to chicken breast and used red wine vinegar. It was so moist!!  I also used cranberry sauce that I made from scratch.

I liked how easy and flavorful this was. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. Turned out delicious.

I read the submitter's review and used red wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar and used boneless skinless chicken breasts rather than the thighs. I followed the instructions for cooking the chicken except I adjusted the time. I cooked it about 20 minutes, then drained the juice, then topped it with the sauce, and cooked another 20-30 minutes.  My husband and I loved this. I served it with rice and baby lima beans.

Was very skeptical of this recipe buy glad I made it. I used the jellied cranberries instead of the whole and it was great! The whole family enjoyed it with homemade Mac n cheese

I'm a  big fan of cranberries and at first I  thought  twice about trying this only because my kids aren't.  Then I  thought, why not, I  was tired of the same old  baked salt &  pepper  chicken I  usually make.  To my surprise,  the kiddos LOVED  it.... never told them what kind of sauce  it was but  they didn't care because they even asked for seconds :)  Thanks for this recipe, oh ya, I  did use it on  baked  drumsticks and thighs,  yummy!!!! :)

We found this to be enjoyable, but seemed to be lacking a bit and tanginess.

The chicken was really juicey but I thought it was kind of bland!! I used chicken drumsticks maybe that was a bad choice?? Not a fan of this recipe!!
