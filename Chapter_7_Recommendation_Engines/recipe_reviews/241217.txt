These turned out very well! I doubled the recipe and had to substitute for a few of the ingredients that our local grocer didn't have and they were great.  The kids like them too. We will keep these stocked.

Very delicious!!  And completely guilt-free with all those incredibly healthy ingredients!  I omitted cardamom because I didn't have it (and increased cinnamon to 1/2 tsp).  I did have to substitute peanut butter for almond butter because I didn't have any, so it was probably a bit sweeter than the original version.  I used the full amount of spirulina and maca powder, and you could definitely taste them, but it was subtle.
