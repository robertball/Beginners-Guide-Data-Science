This is a real winner. I increased the proportions, because I had a lot of chicken. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom, because I prefer it. I used 2 boxes of chicken stove top combined with two cups of water and 1/2 cup of butter. I figured with the mention of mushy stuffing that doubling the water may be too much.

I took the extra couple of minutes to thinly slice one onion and two stalks of celery. I added half the vegies to the bottom of the cooker and sprinkled them lightly with sage. I then placed the seasoned chicken(a bit of salt and lots of pepper, garlic powder and paprika)on top. I added the remaining vegies and another sprinkling of sage and finished it off as the recipe stated.

The addition of the onion and celery really helped the flavor of the chicken and the soup. Now the stuffing that is touching the sauce does get a bit mushy, but the rest of it is nice and fluffy so to me it combines to be perfect.

This was a perfect comfort meal on a summer day without the work.

This was a BIG hit for my first slow cooker meal! I used/love chicken stuffing instead of cornbread. The only complaint I had was the chicken was a little dry and tasteless (but VERY tender!); To fix this I used a lemon/olive oil/garlic marinade for 4 hours and browned each side of the chicken (on stove) before putting in slow cooker. A LOT better with these adjustments.

Very tasty for something so quick and easy to prepare.  In my quest to add more veggies to our diet, I added a bag of frozen green beans in the bottom of the crock pot.  The stuffing mix I had was chicken, not cornbread, but by the time I found that out, I was already committed.  It tasted like Thanksgiving.  YUM.

I'll admit, I made some very small substitutions to make this a little more healthy - I used 99% fat-free cream of chicken soup, and I replaced both the margarine and water with fat-free chicken broth.  But this is a super-easy recipe, and got many kudos from my family.  And, even better, it takes so few ingredients, so it's very inexpensive.

This was great!  I made a few small changes though.  I used chicken broth instead of water, and chicken stuffing instead of cornbread.  It came out GREAT, in fact, there were no leftovers!

This was a very easy recipe. The stuffing was perfect, the chicken was perfect- I did add one envelope of onion soup mix to the cream of chic soup with about 3/4 cup water- but I read the reviews and added a bag of frozen veggies to the pot. I ended up cooking 7 hours on high- I was gone- and while the chicken was PERFECT the veggies had disintegrated to mush. Very tasty, but mushy. Next time I will use fresh raw veggies instead. Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  I made it with thin pork chops seasoned, frozen corn and added an extra can of cream of chicken/mushroom soup.

After reading all the reviews, I was afraid it would turn out too mushy.  So I cut the amount of water in half.  It turned out great!  In fact, I think the next time I make it, I will use the full amount of water, just to see what the difference it.  This is such a good recipe!  Even my picky 2 year old LOVED it!  Can't wait to make it again!  By the way, I used the cornbread stuffing mix (as the recipes calls for) and it was fabulous.  My husband said it tasted like Thanksgiving dinner.  Yummy!!  Thank you!!

So easy, so delicious, so juicy, so tender!  I love this recipe!  Brought leftovers to work and I could cut through the chicken with a plastic fork, no knife required.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Yes, the stuffing is a little mushy but that's how I like it.  Great comfort food.  Husband, 5 year old, and 1 year old liked this as well.

Don't delay, make this today !

Really quite tasty, and SO easy!  I omitted the butter in order to reduce the fat content, and I don't think it made any difference as far as taste, because it was very rich.

This recipe was super easy.  I did season the chicken before putting it in the crock pot, using boneless skinless breasts.  They did come out a little dry, so when I make it again, I think I will try others suggestions of using frozen chicken breasts, or maybe cut the 4 hour cooking time by 30 minutes.

So easy and so delicious. I followed the recipe just as is except I used cream of celery soup instead of the cream of chicken. Just a personal preference. Most of my crock pot chicken recipes call for 6-8 hours on low heat so I was a little wary of cooking for only 4 hours.  The timing was perfect. The stuffing was moist and not mushy. My bag was 8 oz. instead of 6 oz as called for in the recipe. I used the whole bag but didn't change the recipe amounts of butter or water (I used chicken broth instead of water). The chicken was tender enough to cut with a fork, there was plenty of gravy and the stuffing was just right. I plan to make this again and divide it into 2 dishes and freeze it so that we will have a ready casserole for 2 when we need it!!

This was an outstanding meal!  I did triple the recipe.  I woudn't use quite as much lliquid the next time, however.  I omitted the butter to cut back on some of the calories and used all chicken stock in place of the water and butter.  LOVED this! A keeper for sure!

Well here is my take...good recipe just tweaked it a bit...I tried it as the recipe states then adjusted it to our family needs and tastes..My husband had a heart  attack a couple of years ago and need to limit sodium and fat...  First I cut the chicken into bite size pieces, then used two cans of low fat, low sodium, cream of chicken soup, and homemade stuffing with real celery and onion.(just make it less moist)  So I can adjust salt accordingly..(we were overpowered by the salt in the stuffing mix)...but otherwise a keeper in our recipe collection..

Family loved this, the chicken just fell apart, very moist. The stuffing turns into a yummy thicker gravy along with the soup. My only suggestion is if you thought the stuffing was going to sit on top and be just stuffing (i did lol).. nope.. make a side of it for your dinner. :)

It was delicious and every bite was eaten.  I accidentally cooked too long, but it was still good.  I would add more chicken and another can of soup next time to have more servings.

This was so easy to prepare! The whole family loved it. I used 5 chicken breasts, 2 cans of soup (cream of chicken and cream of mushroom) and 1 box of Turkey stuffing.  I added a bag of frozen veggie mix (california style) to the bottom of the crock pot before adding other ingrediants. I cooked on high for an hour and then low for 2 1/2 hrs. Family said this is a keeper!

Awesome easy meal.  I used large, frozen chicken breasts.  To make it weight watchers friendly, I used 98% fat-free condensed soup, and 98% fat-free chicken broth in place of the water.  No butter, it's not necessary.  I also added some carrots, celery, and onion to the bottom of the crockpot.  It was excellent, with plenty of flavor.  Husband loved it too.

We really enjoyed this.  I made this as written, except, I started out with frozen breasts. I cooked on LOW for 4 1/2 hours and the chicken was tender and perfect. I was a little leary that there wasn't enough liquid for the stuffing, but it turned out really well. Thanks for the recipe!

So delicious and so easy!  I didn't have a can of soup on hand so I made my own.  Love that I could make an all-natural soup for this and it still took less than 15 minutes to assemble.

We loved this. Used 1 huge chicken breast and cooked it on low all day (started from frozen) with the cream soup and a chopped onion. Then added the stuffing mixture about 4 hours before serving. We used a box of stove top for the stuffing

I liked it but like others have mentioned it was mushy. I would make it again but with a few revisions to prevent mushiness.

DH said in a rather flat voice that this dish was "interesting." In other words, "Please don't make this again." The only change I made was to reduce the water, and add a few carrots I needed to use up. This was a bland dish. It's the same as Swiss Chicken Casseroles, minus the cheese--but the cheese is needed to add flavor. I won't make this again.

This is really good.  You can also bake it in the oven at 325 for 2 hours.  Also if baking it, I would make the stuffing according to package directions.  Top with shredded cheese. Yum

I really wish this had turned out better for me! Mine also ended up a a little "soupy" but still smells and tastes SO good! I did realize the problem though- it's our slow cooker. Ours is not the standard round crock pot, our is large and oval, spreading all our ingredients out in a thin layer. I WILL make this again, but following other suggestions. I'll make twice the stuffing using less water, and marinate the chicken in an onion/garlic overnight. Keep in mind, if you are using chicken breast with the rib meat, extra juices/fat will add themselves to the mix. This was so simple and tastey, I highly recommend when craving home-tasting comfort food!

I seasoned my chicken breasts with poultry seasoning first, also added 1 can of cream of celery, and as others suggested mixed my stuffing w/chicken broth instead of water, and added two cans of New potatoes....the chicken was so moist and even my 5 year old loved it!!!

This recipe was a great foundation! I added a bag of frozen mixed veggies to it and a can of corn. It was great! I love how the stuffing was nice and fluffy, I was afraid it would be soggy...not at all! Will definitely make again!

This was awesome with some fixing.  Like others, I added 1/2 a medium onion, chopped, 2 sticks of celery, chopped, but I also added chopped carrots and diced potatoes.  Place all veggies in the bottom of the crock pot and add seasoning, thyme, minced garlic, poultry seasoning, and some rosemary.  Put the chicken on top and add Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup on top.  Add the stuffing according to the original recipe.  Just make sure that you cook it long enough so the potatoes cook through.  This we will defiantly have again.

Great recipe!  Everyone loved it, the stuffing was a little mushy, will reduce amt of chicken broth next time.  Overall, great taste and fell apart - no knife needed!

This is so easy my husband can even make it, and its good comfort food.  This recipe is always a staple when I go out of town and the guys are left to fend for themselves.  Also its a good meal to put in the crockpot before a Friday night football game b/c my DT is always hungery when he get home. Thanks for sharing.

What a wonderful, comforting dish this is!  I seasoned the chicken, dredged it in flour, browned in a little olive oil, put a bag of frozen peas and carrots in the bottom of the slow cooker, put the chicken on top along with healthy request cream of chicken soup (Campbells) and topped with chicken flavored stuffing with low sodium chicken broth in place of the water.  YUM YUM YUM!! Fantastic recipe, will be making more often, thanks so much!!

This was OK.  The taste was good, and it was simple to make, but everything was a little mushy.  Everything just kind of ran together and it was hard to tell what was what.  Stuffing doesn't take long to make, so it might be better to cook it separately.  It would also be good served over mashed potatoes instead of stuffing.  Also, I thinly sliced an onion and put half under and half on top of the chicken.  I think this added some flavor.

Very nice quick and easy way to get dinner on the table on a busy day. My stuffing turned out a bit mushy but I'd still make it again. These are my changes: 1. use chicken thighs - I can see why some reviewers said their chicken was dry if you used breasts. 2. sprinkle seasoning on the chicken before adding sauce - pepper, garlic powder, etc. 3. it did not need 1/4 c. butter. Next time I'd try adding about 1 T instead.

Ok.. I make this once a week, I have the actual "crock pot" cookbook.. Try browing the cutlets in flour 1st before adding them to your slow cooker.. and only add 1/4 cup water.. it makes the stuffing crispy and A-MAZING. . (spray your cooker with pam before using!)

I am trying to get into cooking while chronic fatigue of unknown origin is controlling my life.  This recipe was appealing as there was no work in it.  

It tasted ok to me.  Nothing fantastic but lately nothing does. What I require recipes for, mostly, is the cooking time.
This cooked perfectly in 4 hours.

I just used a package of chicken, I didn't notice the weight. Next time I will sprinkle pepper on the chicken, put the cream of chicken soup in first and place the chicken in. I will then flip the chicken over so both sides are covered in the soup.  I will also double the stuffing and thus the water.  

Thank you for posting this no fuss recipe.

Update: I'm making this today and to add some flavor I added 1 packet of dry onion soup mix.

I fixed this tonight for supper and my husband raved about this meal. I served it with cranberry sauce. 
The only thing different I did was I added chicken broth and not water. I also put a pinch of poultry seasoning in the stuffing. Overall I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

This was so good!  It was like Thanksgiving in a pot.  I only did one thing different.  Instead of 1 can of Cream of Chicken Soup i added two so it would be extra saucy.  Will definitely make again!

This was okay. The chicken seemed a little dry to me, but otherwise it tasted good and was a nice, easy dish to make for a weekday. I used chicken flavored stuffing mix.

WOW!  This is sooooo good!!!  I didn't do anything to the chicken, I did use 2 cans of soup and used chicken stuffing.  I also cooked on high for 2 hours, 15 minutes.  It was DELICIOUS and my chicken was nice and moist!  Will DEFINITELY make again (and again, and again!).

Delicious. I cooked and cubed the chicken before I put it in the crockpot. Brought this to work for a potluck and everyone loved it.

My husband and I really liked this. I will make it again it was so easy. The only thing I changed was to put a little garlic powder and kosher salt on the chicken and add a teaspoon of better that boullion to the water. Oh and I used smart balance instead of butter.

Comfort food at it's finest! My DH is not very fond of stuffing (good - more for the rest of us!) but he loves the chicken in gravy. I just love the whole casserole and how very, very easy it is to make.   Sometimes I season my chix with garlic powder, black pepper, onion powder and a dash of poultry seasoning and sometimes I don't. I have doubled and even tripled this and it always pleases. Thanks for a regular at our home!

So yummy!  I used more cream of mushroom and seasoned the chix with S, P and poultry seasoning.  I also laid the chix on some celery stalks to keep out of the liquid.  My chix was not try at all.

I lightly seasoned the chicken, but that is the only change I made to this recipe and it was wonderful!  It turned out much better than I thought and the chicken was so tender, no knife needed.  Will definitely make again!

This was wonderful!!  I added a second can of soup as suggested.  I also used the chicken with herbs.  I usually use this in place of plain cream of chicken.  I  doubled the stuffing and liquid. I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder and pepper.  I used chicken broth in place of butter.  I was almost out.  ;)  It was wonderful. My son loved it.  I have almost no left overs.  This is a keeper!

My family LOVED this! The only thing I changed was the soup: I used cream of chicken with herbs because my husband hates mushroom flavor. Everyone cleaned their plates and said this recipe was a keeper. I used the thick cut chicken breasts and they did not dry out.

I used chicken broth in place of most of the water and reduced the butter.  Skillet sauteed two chicken breasts that were first left overnight in a marinade of olive oil, crushed garlic cloves, and lemon juice (as suggested by another reviewer).  Cooked it in the crockpot on low for 4 hours and on warm for 30 minutes and it came out very mushy. Not a pleasing texture.  This dish might better be made in the oven. 
** Update: Made again, this time using frozen (unmarinated) chicken, frozen green beans and carrots, a can of cream of chicken and mushroom combo, unsalted butter, fresh-pressed garlic, and a can of chicken broth in place of the water (plus pepper and a little salt).  I also wound up using around 3 cups of Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing because otherwise the mixture was too soupy.  Cooked it in the crockpot for 4 hours and it turned out mushy and not very flavorful.  It's okay, just not a recipe I'm interested in trying again when better ones are out there.

Easy!  Yummy! And, of course, I made adjustments.  I have the HUGE crockpot, so I did six chicken breasts.  Before I topped with the large can of cream of chicken - I put in a bag of frozen "Normandy Mix" veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots).  I, too, used chicken broth instead of water with the chicken stuffing mix (I used two boxes).  No need for salt, and the mixed veggies cooked down to almost unrecognizable - except the carrots.  It was almost a surprise when you got the wonderful taste of cauliflower.  Husband raved, pre-teens raved, and even the two-year old ate more than five bites.  This recipe will make it into the rotation!

Tasted great. Substituted the water with chicken broth based on other reviews. Also added chopped onion, garlic and celery to the stuffing and seasoned the chicken with garlic pepper powder. Left overs tasted even better, will definitely make again.

Very easy to make and delicious!  I doubled the recipe but only had 1 can of cream of chicken soup, so I substituted cream of celery soup for the 2nd can.  It really does remind me of Thanksgiving dinner!  Thanks for sharing!

This is really tastey.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I seasoned my frozen chicken breasts with pepper, paprika and sage).  Thought it turned out great!! I see that the stuffing could be a little soggy - but it reminded me of the stuffing that comes out of the turkey -- delicious!

This recipe is fantastic! My family loved it (including my 2 picky children) and it was super easy to make. This recipe is a keep for sure. I used Cream of Mushroom instead of Cream of Chicken because it's what I had on hand.

I have been making chicken & stuffing in the crockpot for years, but never using the pre-packaged stuffing mix.  I didn't personally care for the texture of this dish much.  It was fast and easy, however, deserving the 3-star rating.  I believe I will go back to the homemade cornbread method, however.  The flavor was OK I guess...

This recipe was just okay. I went ahead and used chicken broth instead of water and I didn't have any cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom soup. In the end you couldn't tell what cream of soup was in there anyway, it was just a big gooey mess. I also topped the finish product with swiss cheese to give it a bit of a bite. As written it would be a little plain - I added spices to make the chicken taste a bit better. I used garlic and some oregano.

This was both easy and tasty. I used leftover stuffing from Thanksgiving that I had frozen. I just put the thawed stuffing over the chicken breasts and soup and let it cook. So easy and so good! I will try it again with the packaged stuffing, but doubt it will be as good as with the homeade. Still, I'm sure it will be good. A keeper!

So fast and easy!!  I used 4 frozen chicken breasts and cooked for 6 hours on low and the result was DELICIOUS!  I added an extra can of cream of mushroom soup and a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  I also used chicken broth instead of water and used stove top chicken flavored stuffing.  It's like a little Thanksgiving dinner in a pot! So Yummy!

Excellent recipe -- easy and very tasty.  The chicken comes out extremely tender.  In fact, I think it is the first time in 30 years, my husband told me how tender the chicken was!  I followed the recipe exactly.

Good, but not excitingly great. My biggest suggestion is the put the stuffing in halfway through, because mine was a little mushy. Also, I started with frozen solid chicken breasts and didn't need to add any time. I love a recipe I can start from frozen!

I am giving this 5 stars because I made lots of changes, some I didn't intend to and it still came out very tasty.

I accidentally opened a can of cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom ( which I was going to substitute) and I didn't have any boxed stuffing so I used pepperidge farm stuffing in the bag and I added some onion and bell seasoning to the stuffing.
I used 6 4 oz chicken breasts and I put 3 in the bottom with half the soup on top, then the other 3 with the rest of the soup with a little salt and pepper. Put the stuffing on top. I admit the cheese was a bit strong but overall the chicken was moist, the stuffy was tasty not soggy at all. I think next time I might try putting some potatoes in as well.

Great easy recipe, definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good.  I love that it cooks in the slow cooker!  Next time, I will use a box of chicken stuffing instead of the cornbread (I think the cornbread stuffing lacks flavor).  I will also only use one can of soup.  I used two this time, but it was pretty saucy & the stuffing was kind of soggy.

This recipe seemed promising but came out poorly. I did exactly as recommended but the soup just laid on the top of the chicken and the stuffing was bland. Don't think I'll do this one again.

This is a great recipe.  I doubled the stuffing and the soup because we have a family of six.  Wonderful comfort food.  The flavor was great and our 4 kids liked it too.  Thanks for a great quick cheap and easy meal.

This was very tasty!  I will definately make it again.  Last time I added more water that suggested because I thought it would burn.  Big mistake!  The stuffing turned out too mushy however it still had a great flavor.  Next time I will follow directions exactly.

What an EASY recipe to make such a delicious dish.  The ONLY thing I added was sprinkle ADOBO seasoning on both sides of the chicken before putting it into the crockpot to add flavor to the meat.

I have made this recipe lots of times.  I guess I have confused with with another recipe along the way and sort of made my own version.  I have changed the cream of chicken to cream of broccoli and cheese.  I cook the potatoes in with the chicken as well so that its all cooked in one dish.  I also use stove top with just enough water to make it damp not wet instead of the corn bread stuffing mix.  It is the first recipe that I have taken off a website that has been requested in my house regularly.

Turned out fairly well. The chicken came out a little bit dry, but the chicken itself may have not been super fresh.

Super easy and quick prep recipe. I read the reviews and decided to only use half the amount of water. The chicken burned on the bottom and the stuffing was dry. Next time I will use the whole amount of water. The taste was still good though. I definitely recommend this.

This was very good. My picky son even ate it.  I did put onion and celery in bottom of crock, seasoned my chicken and used my own cream of chicken recipe, added poultry seasnoning and chicken broth. A big hit, thanks for posting.

I did not have cornbread stuffing, only regular bread stuffing, but followed the recipe as if it were the recipe cornbread kind.  Turned out fine in crockpot. Loved it.  Smelled and tasted like I was eating Thanksgiving dinner. Looking forward to leftovers!

Husband loved it, I liked it a lot, but thought it was a little salty.  I cant blame the recipe though, I used a generic stuffing, they may have been it.  VERY EASY to make, I love these easy recipes!!  Thanks!!

Eh, this was too condensed soup tasting which is icky to me.  I liked the stuffing idea so on another occasion I used chicken stock and more veggies skipping out on the condensed soup.  Tasted much better and great that I can use the crockpot too.

Great recipie. Did some changes.  Used mushroom soup (what I had) mixed with a little chicken broth and a 1/4 pkg of Lipton's onion soup mix.  Used chicken stuffing and low sodium chicken broth(instead of water) and added canned chopped jalapenos(hubby likes hot stuff) to stuffing.  Yummy, hubby happy!

Yummy and easy.  This was my first slow cooker dish and I will be definitely be making it again.  I thought the chicken was a little bland so the next time I make it I will follow the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and add some spices to the chicken beforehand.

I almost didn't make this recipe because the pics make it look really unappetizing, but I needed something easy and ready in less than 5 hours.  It really turned out great!  My husband loves stuffing, so he was really pleased.

This was terrific! I did season the chicken with poultry seasoning before adding the soup. I also substituted reduced sodium chicken broth for the water. My husband and I both loved it!

Oh my gosh!  This was Thanksgiving in a crockpot!!  I did follow the advice of some other reviewers and added an onion and some celery along with some seasonings.  S & P and poultry seasoning.  I used the cornbread stove-top stuffing but mixed with low salt chicken broth to cut the fat.  I cooked on low for 4 hours and it was perfect.  Served with some cranberry sauce along side and some fresh cooked vegetables and it made a Sunday dinner feel like a holiday.  Loved it!

This was SOOO easy!  I used Stove Top Chicken stuffing instead, and used 1 1/4 cups of chicken broth instead of the water and butter.  It turned out so moist and delicious.   I am definitely keeping this recipe and will be making it again soon!

My husband is a very picky eater. His response to this was amazing, he said "We should have this for thanksgiving" ... and it was so easy to make.

Excellent and so easy...added 6 chicken thighs skinless, can of 98% FF cream of chicken; added a can and a 1/2 of water and mixed.  Added fresh carrots, and topped with 6 oz chicken stuffing.  I pushed down on the stuffing so that it would get "wet".  cooked on low for 8 hours.  came out like a stuffing stew...so good!

Excellent, simple recipe! I nearly doubled the amount of chicken and used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup in order to get plenty of sauce/topping. Also, I added sliced swiss cheese to the top about 30 minutes before we ate. The swiss could also be put in between the soup and stuffing I believe.  Either way, it was delicious!  Will make again and again!

We liked this quite a bit.  Used cornbread stuffing in a bag instead of stovetop mix.  Also used broth instead of water.

I followed the recipe except using homemade chicken broth in place of the water in the dressing mix.  Only used 1 tablespoon of reduced fat margarine also.  Very tasty for such an easy recipe.  I placed my blsl breasts in the crockpot right out of the freezer.  This keeps them more solid without becoming mushy.  Cooked for about 5 hours on low.

I put some chopped onion and minced garlic in the bottom of the crock pot.  I used four chicken thighs.  It was okay...I think I would have liked it better if I had used chicken breasts.  I threw in some frozen peas and, as others mentioned, found the stuffing was a bit mushy.

This is a great dish! I loved coming home to dinner already done. I cut up chicken tenders, substituted chicken broth with basil & garlic for the water, and added garlic & onion powders, basil, and pepper. I will certainly be making this dish again. Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent and easy recipe.  I made some adjustments: substituted soup with 1 c. light cream (10%), added chopped mushrooms, toasted pecans and dried cranberries.  It was delicious, will definitely make it again!

I made this chicken and stuffing in the crockpot today.  It was very easy to prepare.  I had to increase the size of the dish and had to improvise to use what I had on hand.  I had one pkg. of cornbread and 1 pkg of turkey stuffing mix, so I mixed them together and doubled the water.  I also wanted more sauce so I mixed a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of cream of chicken together and poured that over the chicken.  Halfway through cooking I stuck a butter knife down the side of the crockpot in a few places to make a little pathway to help the soup make its way up to the stuffing, so the stuffing didn't dry out too much.  It came out well despite my changes. The chicken was easily pulled apart with a fork.  I'll definately make this again.

I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, but it really was quite good!  I thought the stuffing would turn out mushy, but it got crisp on the top how I like it.  I did put a quartered onion and some mushrooms in the bottom of the slow cooker, for extra flavor.  Good stuff!

Really good. I made a couple of changes which I loved. My chicken breast were huge so I quartered them and seasoned them with Old bay and pepper before I quickly browned them in a small amount of olive oil. I sliced up an onion real thin and added about 1/3 to the bottom of crock (sprayed first) threw in chicken, rest of onion on top with some baby carrots, soup then stuffing. I was in a huge rush and added too much chicken broth to stuffing mix so it ended up as part of the gravy...I'll slow down next time but I had it all done and was back in the car in under 20min.

This recipe smells and tasted delicious, but was slightly disappointed because the stuffing was very dry(dressing on the top was charred and horrible) I will decrease amount of water next time to see if dressing has a little more substance-- It is worth trying, just keep in mind if you don't like runny stuffing, you'll have to adjust the ingredients a bit! Other than that, a hearty and simple meal

I had all the ingredients on hand so I tried this recipe, a little hesitantly...It was delicious!  I've made it at least ten times since.  I always season the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder first, and usually add 2 cans of cream of chicken soup because we love the gravy.  We also perfer chicken flavored Stove Top stuffing over the cornbread stuffing.

So easy to make!  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and I also added one chopped medium onion overtop of the chicken.  There is a similar recipe to this called Chicken Supreme III but it is cooked in the oven.

I followed the recipe exactly using stove top turkey stuffing in place of cornbread.  This turned out great!  It is a great way to give some of that Thanksgiving flavor to an easy weeknight meal any time of the year!

This was SO easy and my 2 year old LOVED it!  It lacked a bit of flavor, but its a great easy meal that dosn't need much doctoring.  The chicken was so nice and tender too!  I'll definitely use two cans of soup next time as the 'sauce' was yummy!

This was pretty good!  I put it in the slow cooker before I left for work, and cooked it a full 8 hours.

Mods (I used what I had on hand):  c/o mushroom soup, homemade croutons (skipped the butter), olive oil to grease the crock, beau monde seasoning on chicken, chicken broth instead of water, and added some carrots and celery.

Next time I'd add vegetables again (onion, green bean, corn) and maybe a layer of sweet potato.  I'd choose one or more low-sodium products, but my guest didn't think it was too salty.

I marinated the breasts in Montreal Chicken season with Olive oil then browned on each side before putting into the crockpot.  Also, used unseasoned stuffing mix that I added chicken stock (instead of the water) onion, celery & minced garlic to.  Cooked on high for 2 hours then low for 2 hours.  Our family loved this recipe, was good heated up for leftover lunch the next day as well.
I gave the 4 stars because I had to change the recipe a bit, but otherwise would have given 5.

Great recipe, very quick and easy.  I did mix frozen corn in with the soup to add some veggies to the dish.  I also put the chicken in while frozen and cooked about 5hrs.  Very good recipe, will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I realized that as I went to put the chicken in the crockpot, I had bone in, with skin chicken pieces. I quickly pulled off the skin and worried that the 4 hours wasn't enough. Yum... it was perfect for the whole family, very tender.

Came out perfect. I used Cream of Chicken Soup and Creamy Onion Soup, and seasoned the chicken with Bay's seasoning, EVOO, lemon juice and Garlic. The chicken was juicy... perfectly seasoned. Will use again!!!

Fantastic recipe!  I made a few modifications, and it turned out perfect.  As suggested by other reviewers, I substituted chicken broth for the water.  And I used Stove Top Savory Herbs stuffing because that was all I had. I'm sure it would be just as good with any flavor stuffing.  My husband loved it, and requested that we have it again soon.

Five stars for ease of recipe and straightforward goodness. The chicken came out very tender, everything was juicy and savory. I did try to flavor up the chicken with a little pepper, garlic salt, chopped onion, and sour cream (I have no idea) put on top of it. Recipe seems very forgiving - the sour cream didn't screw it up and I think the onion or any other veggie for that matter would be a good idea.
Only thing I would suggest is maybe buy a lower sodium version of your stuffing, if available. Between the soup and the stuffin, it was all a little salty and 'packaged' tasting for me.

Terrific Sunday dinner. I used half the amount of water and a box of Stovetop chicken flavored stuffing. It was very tender, flavorful and satisfying. Will be making this again this weekend. Thanks for the recipe.

I substituted chicken stuffing mix, because my family prefers that.  This was very simple and quick to put together.

This was great for my first crockpot meal. Nice and easy, and very tasty, even with improvisions. I used a garlic cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, and I added a one can of drained french style green beans on top of the soup and under the stuffing. Also used chicken stuffing. Turned out wonderful! My neighbor even asked for the leftovers! Very easy to modify, very tasty.

I took the chicken, soup and stuffing and mixed it together in the slow cooker and cooked it for the suggested time. It came out great! I read the other reviews and some said it was mushy, but I hate dry stuffing. It was just like my Grandma used to make! It filled me and my boyfriend up, and there were leftovers for lunch the next day. I will be making this again! Thaniks so much!

Way too mushy. I did make modifications so it would taste better. I added a can of celery soup, basil, and onion powder. It definitely tasted better. It was so mushy I put it in the oven and put cheese on top. Tastes great with modifications!

This tasted great and was very easy. THe only thing I did different was that I boiled the chicken first because it was frozen. Since the chicken was done when I put it in the crock pot it took half the time.

I hate to give such a poor rating but this was really nasty and pretty much tasteless. I replaced the water with chicken broth and added some chopped onion, celery on the bottom of the crock pot underneath the chicken, I also rubbed the chicken with garlic powder and a little bit of salt. That didnt help this dish... the chicken had NO flavor and the stuffing was all mushy. :(

Yum!  Quick, easy, and very tasty!  The chicken is very tender.  Everyone at my house liked it and asked me to make it again.  Oh, by the way Susan, I'm about four miles from you in Byron!!  Small world :)

I tried this recipe on my huband. (He's not much of a chicken fan.) He loved it, especially the stuffing. I've made it a few times since, and added an extra chicken breast. I've added this recipe to my collection. thanks!

This was REALLY yummy!! I ended up using Cream of Onion soup because that's all I had on hand. One of the chicken breasts was frozen because I decided at the last minute to up the number of chicken breasts I used but after 4.5 hours it all turned out spectacular!  If you're looking for a good hearty meal that's easy to make this is your recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!! Oh, and I also used chicken flavored stuffing mix instead of the corn bread one.  Maybe next time I'll use that just to actually follow the recipe! :)

very good recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of water and it was delicious.  Next time I think I am going to add some veggies.  All in all this recipe is definitely on my too make again list.

This was a wonderful, easy recipe!  It was super fast to throw together.  I didn't change anything about it!  When it came out of the slow cooker the chicken was so tender it was falling apart!  It was delicious!
