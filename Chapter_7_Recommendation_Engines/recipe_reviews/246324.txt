I didn't get to finish before the post was made...  silly me.   No yeast was my naan search.  Was making butter chicken and really like the naan with it.   Easy to mix, used a rolling pin and it got thin, much thinner than other recipes that u have used.  I added ground cumin instead of seeds .    Nice flavor, nice smell.   Easy to roll, not sticky, put on my skillet with a quick spray of oil and was perfect. Throwing away the other recipes I have.  This was fast, easy and exactly what I wanted.

I have made this twice. The texture is good, but it was a little bland to me. So I added a 1/2 tsp of salt. But overall, a great alternative to the two-hour naan.

I just made this as directed.  They look just like the picture!  I added more flour during the kneading and shaping to make it easier to work with.  I plan to use these for pizzas tonight and I'm sure they can easily hold up to whatever toppings I put on them and maintain their shape and density.  In hindsight, I should have substituted the cumin for oregano.  But then, I wasn't thinking about pizza when I was making these.  Good recipe.

Great recipe for a quick naan-like bread! I added 1 tbsp of Fage yogurt and used cumin powder instead. I’d make it again, only making smaller, thinner sized portions...I also cooked mine on a griddle, 400° is about right. Bon a petit...

I have made this recipe several times. It's quick and easy! I have omitted the sugar and replaced the cumin seeds with lots of garlic. It's delicious and a great addition to many meals!

I was impressed on my first try. I didn’t add the cumin which I will try next time. Though My son thought I had added too many eggs because it had a ‘made from scratch waffle’ taste. No eggs added I also thought it had a bit of a breakfast flavour but I would make again and would Tweek  it somehow. I loved how it puffed up in the frypan! It would be great with curry! My son suggested chopping up some cilantro finely and rolling the dough in it and it was delicious! Thanks!

This was quick and easy, exactly what I needed. My only complaint is that I required an additional 1/2 cup of flour or more to get the texture right. However, bread recipes are never perfect with cup measurements in place of weight. I did what another reviewer suggested and added salt and I'm glad I did. I highly recommend adding it in.

Would definitely make again. Never made naan and didn’t have yeast. I left out the cumin seeds because I didn’t have them and added fresh chopped garlic and garlic powder. Even though I made it for a curry, I ended up making mini pizzas with them because I liked them so much.

Big hit with the family. I liked it because it took only 30 minutes rather than the 3 hours I’m used to. I thought it was bland, but added some spicy mango chutney and it was fantastic.

This was an excellent alternative to having regular store bought bread or rolls for soup. I added a twist by sprinkling garlic powder. My family loved it and they were dipping the leftovers in salsa (go figure). Will definitely make this again.

So good and so easy to make. My husband complimented it over and over. Added 1/2 tsp salt (just in case) but probably would have been fine without it. Thank you. Quick and simple and went really well with Indian Butter Chicken.

I substituted 1 tablespoon of milk or so with plain non-fat yogurt and it turned out perfectly chewy, it added a bit of subtle flavor to my "naan".

I made this recipe with gluten free flour and it was easy and delicious! (My gluten eating friends and family even liked it).  They just needed a little bit longer cooking time to turn out soft and yummy!

These were delicious. The store was out of pre-made naan so I tried my hand at it. Took awhile on the stove but was worth it, all the family enjoyed it with our butter chicken. My only complaint - it definitely needs salt!

I added 1/2t salt and cut back to about 1/3c milk. Perfect and will make again. Kids loved it and it was quick. What more could anyone ask for? Also tried with seasonings, like Mrs Dash and cinammon -sugar. Great base recipe.

Quick and easy but, made as is, the dough is extremely wet. I needed to add about a half cup more flour to make it manageable. I squashed pieces of dough out on my floured cutting board and got seven pieces, would’ve been eight if I hadn’t made the first one too big. It was definitely bland so I brought a shaker of flake salt to the table and everyone used it. Next time I’ll add a half teaspoon salt to the recipe.

I made this in a pinch when I couldn't find gyros in the store. It is fast , easy and tasted pretty good. I did add salt as some other suggested and I think this helped.  I will use this recipe again for tacos if I'm in a pinch.

I made it with cinnamon.  It's a learning curve. First 2 were too thick with poor bake. 2nd two shaped to size and thickness of flour tortilla.  Those were perfect. Slathered with real butter cinnamon and sugar. Indian fry bread-like!  So good.

This is a fast way of making naan. You have to  roll the naan as flat as possible for best results. I will definitely make this again.

Definitely thinner and a little more dense compared to a yeast recipe, but quicker and easier if you need a quick flatbread. I always add a little more seasoning than what this recipe recommends.

The taste was good but they came out too heavy. Did I use too much flour? Did I press them too thick? Would like this recipe to work.

Good, quick substitute for naan.  I used ground cumin, which worked fine.  I will definitely try the cinnamon too.

This comes together fairly quickly  and the directions are clear and easy to follow. I really didn't care for the cumin seeds, perhaps an acquired taste. Thanks for sharing, I'll make these again.
