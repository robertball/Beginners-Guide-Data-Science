I squeezed my lime wedge into my drink instead of garnishing. I LOVED the tartness of this drink.

This is an easy sipping drink for me. I prefer to shake a cocktail with juice mixers. It seems to taste better that way.

Was in the mood for a cocktail last night so I tried this. And let me tell you. First, I'm not much of a drinker but this right here...OMG it definitely packs a punch. Be careful though it will sneak up on you. Thanks for a very nice recipe.

So fresh and light, perfect in the sunshine! I made mine with "lite" (no sugar added) juices to save some calories and it was still great.

The hot August sun made me desiring a refreshing no nonsense alcoholic beverage.The Sea Breeze cocktail has achieved a place in my heart as far as thirst quinching summer cocktails go.Tart from the lime,but oh so refreshing and pleasant! I love that this drink doesn't break my wallet with all the expensive liquior one is required to buy when making a really good cocktail! Like another reviewer,  I squeezed all the lime slice into my glass and let the it drop on the bottom of my ice filled glass. I had to substitute Diet cranberry pineapple juice instead of cranberry and grapefruit juice because that is what I had in the fridge. I am looking forward to another soon! ;]

Interesting! We used to make these by the pitcher every summer but ours were more of a greyhound cocktail with some cranberry thrown in - - we used about four parts grapefruit juice to one part cranberry juice and always a few lime wedges squeezed and tossed into the pitcher. But this is great too, just different.

I tried it because of the high ratings, it's overly tart for me, everything you make it from is bitter/sour.

We made this as written. Yumola! My 93 year old mom said, "Oh! A nice 'kicker' that's refreshing, too!" Definitely squeeze that fresh lime in the drink. It makes the difference. Thanks!
