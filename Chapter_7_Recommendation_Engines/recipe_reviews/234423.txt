I don't know what this is? Is it meant to be served completely cooled like a candy? Or is it just called "fudge" because of the thin fudge like appearance when cut in squares? I assume it's an egg bake breakfast dish but I'm still not sure. It's super rich and the jalapenos add a nice bite. I served it with pancakes for breakfast and while it was ok I don't see it being a repeater at the LTH house. (I will try a completely cooled square later just in case that is how it was meant to be served and update the review if necessary). THANKS for the recipe!

Super simple and quick to make. Was a hit at the bbq I served it at.  I added a bit more jalape√±os.  I'll have to experiment and try using some garlic and other items in it just to see what it can do.

My jalapenos weren't hot so all I got was baked cheese with bits of green pepper crunch which actually was good but I missed that kick. I live in AZ and it was green chile harvest at the time so I decided to replace the jalapenos with roasted green chiles the hot variety. DEE- licious! Next time I will make sure my jalapenos are hot and try it again. Overall I think it's a great low carb snack recipe. Extremely easy.

This came out well. The kids even ate it. The cheese hides the heat of the peppers well. I used two jalepeneos rather than canned chopped. Add salt and pepper to taste.
