It was quite good and tasty altho I would add more tuna and anchovies next time as I want more protein in my pasta.

Hearty, flavorful and satisfying,  Don't forget the anchovies or capers!  I think it would be great with any pasta on hand.  Very much like a quick and easy puttanesca. I used a heaping Tbsp. of dried basil and added black olives, YUM!
