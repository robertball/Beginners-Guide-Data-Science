I absolutely love this 'ice cream'.  Trying to make it with less calories, I only used 2 tbs peanut butter.  Delicious! Didn't miss the rest of the peanut butter. It does melt rather quickly so I placed it in the freezer for about 10 minutes before serving it. Thanks for the recipe.

Peanut Butter Banana Ice Cream Haiku: "Peanut butter rocks. Add banana? Magical! My favorite combo." I used honey-roasted peanut butter that I ground at Whole Foods and sprinkled some honey-roasted peanuts on top when I ate it - heaven! After processing the banana and peanut butter; however, I put the mixture back into the freezer for awhile so it wouldn't be so custard-y.

I saw the recipe in All Recipes magazine.  Their recipe called for  2T milk (I used almond milk).  My opinion: super easy, great consistency, needs more peanut butter.  I think the combination of my bananas not being too ripe and not enough peanut butter had me a little dissatisfied.  I'm going to let the rest of my bananas ripen a little more, add a little more PB and maybe a little vanilla extract the next time.  

Also, I don't recommend leaving the bananas in the freezer so long.  I had mine in for 4 hours and I had to wait for them to defrost a bit before I could use them in the food processor.  So if you do leave them in a long time, give them some time out to get a little softer to better blend in the food processor.

I love making banana "ice cream"--so easy to whip up in my single-serve Ninja.  This is definitely the way to make it--with NO milk added. And adding peanut butter makes it even better. Mine sat for a bit before I could get a pic, so it looks a bit melted, but it still tasted great!

This is amazing! It definitely tastes like ice cream and coming to think of it, it's the dietary equivalent of eating one banana and one tablespoon of peanut butter per serving which is pretty healthy. I can't wait to make this again!
