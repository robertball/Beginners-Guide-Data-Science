This recipe turned out great. I used frozen huckleberries and followed the recipe, except I added a little more almond extract and used whipping cream to brush the crust. Baked it for 45-50 minutes, watching for the bubbling to begin and making sure the crust didn't burn. I was worried it would be runny, but I let it cool completely and it turned out perfect! Delcious a la mode! This recipe is a keeper! I can't wait to try it with blueberries!

Sooooooooo delicious!   I used frozen wild blueberries - just tossed them in frozen and had great results. Not runny at all. Used the French Pastry Pie Crust from this site and it was flaky and simple to make. Will definitely make tis again.

Almond extract makes almost any pie better. :D Seriously though, this is a wickedly good pie. I modded it myself by using a lard-based homemade crust, which made it so flaky the pie nearly crumbled if you even looked at it the wrong way.

Used frozen wild blueberries - 6 cups (two bags), added 2 tbsp more of flour and doubled the almond extract. YUMMY.

This was my first attempt at a blueberry pie (for Christmas no less)and it came out great!  I even forgot the butter at the end and it was still great.  Other than that mistake, I followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing (except maybe a drop or two more almond extract.  I loved the way it didn't ooze into a messy, soupy mess when cut and the taste was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't love this one but it's not bad. I did not love the secret ingredient, or the cinnamon. I think I could roll with one or the other but not both. Also, the author is dead serious about 5 1/2 cups of berries. I used a 16 oz bag of frozen wild blueberries, because clearly I have no concept of how much frozen weight translates into cup volume (and I still don't because I didn't measure my frozen berries to find out how much I was off by, which is my own fault). Anyway, 16 oz of frozen berries is not enough because my pie had that "too much flour" texture in the filling, which is 100% my own fault. I made this as a no-topping pie and that worked fine with the given cooking time, following the same rules for covering it and then uncovering it. This is a good recipe, I just don't love the cinnamon and almond like I thought I would. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly like the recipe said and it was delicious. I let it completly cool before cutting it and it was set perfect. My family thought it was the best blueberry pie they had ever had.

Wwwwow! This was a terrific recipe! Made for Thanksgiving and my 4 year old son CLEANED his plate! I used  1 cup of  fresh blueberries and two cups of canned strawberries, but the end result was just as yummy.

My family loved this pie.  It was very tasty.  I’m not sure if it came out exactly right.   The berries remained whole for the most part and did not create a jelly-like filling.  Perhaps I needed to let it bake a bit longer.  However, it was good enough to try again.

Exceptional fresh flavor, and most wonderful blueberry taste. Not cloyingly sweet, and the almond and cinnamon do not overpower- -  just perfect.   Alas, wild blueberries were not to be had.  My  supermarket fresh blueberries tasted a bit bland, so I added 2 tsp. of fresh lemon juice to give them some tang and 1/2 Tbsp more flour for my very juicy berries.   No other changes.  When the pie was  completely cooled, it  thickened up just fine. This recipe is terrific! Thanks for sharing.

Turned out amazing!!! Made this last year as well and my 6 month old at the time loved it as well. Always a big hit. Used wild fresh blueberries. They were abundant this year. I didn’t make any changes. Did bake it just a bit longer for the crust to brown up a bit more.

I used regular blueberries, but my pie came out real sloppy. Also, I found the baking time needed to be longer (I use an oven thermometer so I know the temp was right).  I will make it again because the flavor of cinnamon and almond extract was wonderful. When I make it again I plan to make the following changed; cut ice cold butter with the sugar, add 2 tbsp more of flower with it, add lemon zest to the blue berries, bake at 425 for 15 min, cover the crust and bake for another 45 min at 350.

The pie is great but what I loved the most is the crust recipe.  Hands down, the easiest no fail ive ever made.  My other recipe i have used for 20 years may be a little bit better, but way more room for error, more time and more mess.  Have used this crust many times with other pies.

Best blueberry pie I have ever made.   I doubled the almond extract and a dash more of cinnamon.  Used Pillsbury refrigerator pie crust  ... perfect.  I love using only 1/2 cup of sugar as I am working hard to cut sugar in our home ... this helped for a dessert for company.  Thank you!

The amount of sugar is perfect, so the flavor of the fresh blueberries shown through. I forgot the almond extract but added the zest of half an orange and that was a wonderful idea. The pie was perfect and I will use this recipe again.

I followed the recipe and I too found the almond (which I thought sounded like a great idea) and the cinnamon overshadowed the blueberries.  Not bad, but not my favorite.
This was my first blueberry pie, not like my Mom's.

While the consistency was perfect, the flavor was awful. The wild blueberry flavor was completely overshadowed by the almond and cinnamon.

Absolutely delicious.  Didn't change a thing.  I didn't have a blueberry pie recipe in my box, so I must not have made one I loved before.  This was it!

A BIG hit at Thanksgiving! I really liked this pie and used all fresh spices from a local spice shop. I noticed the butter pooled on mine but I think I should have added a few more vents on the top - used a butter knife to make 5 small slits around the edges and everything mixed perfectly.

Great recipe, it was the first time I made a blueberry pie and I was a little nervous but it turned out amazing! The almond extract added is great
