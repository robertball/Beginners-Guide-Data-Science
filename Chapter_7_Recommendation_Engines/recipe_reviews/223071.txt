This recipe was really good!  I had never had celery root before but my husband requested it so I found this recipe, one of the few on here for celery root.  I forgot to put the pecans in at first but added them after we ate half of it.  It tasted almost the same with or without them. I liked it a little better without though.  My husband couldn't really tell either way. I followed the recipe exactly other than that and it was nice and refreshing.  I will definitely be making it again!

This salad is truly a refreshing change to the idea of "salad". I do not use the salt as I don't usually add salt but it can be added after if it is required.
