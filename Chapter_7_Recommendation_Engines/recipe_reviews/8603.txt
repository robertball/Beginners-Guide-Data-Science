Needed more salt in the walnut mixture. I didn't think it was anything special.

This is an incredibly easy and delicious recipe! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts so it was healthy also. The flavor is great and smells good when it bakes. thanks for a great recipe!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The baking mix was a good idea vice breadcrumbs.  I used chicken breasts and added seasoning salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the baking mix.  The last 20 minutes I turned up the temperature to 375 to make sure the breading was crispy.

I substituted the whole chicken for chicken breast tenders. They came out delicious and perfectly crispy.
The only ingredient I did not add was the pecans. It is a great, easy recipe!

Very simple and yummy! If you drain them on a paper towel after they are cooked they are not so greasy.

This was a nice alternative to the egg yolk/breadcrumb option for baked chicken.  My husband and son loved it with some hot sauce on top!  I used chicken tenders and baked them too long (they only need about 30 minutes) so it was a little dry.  But the topping was nice and crispy.  I left out the salt but otherwise made as written.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used 1/4 cup almond flour instead of pecans, and added garlic powder and a little extra salt.  I also cooked my chicken on a rack in the pan and used canola oil cooking spray instead of the butter.  The results were crispy and delicious!

Truely a good recipe.  Like the buttermilk  baking mix.  I used chicken breast with skin and ribs.  When baking it comes out very juciey.  I did not have any evaporated milk so used an egg substitute instead with nice results.  Give it a try I think you'll like it.

I have a very similar recipe but it includes a little curry and Old Bay seasoning. They add a depth to the flavors.

I USED CHICKEN BREAST INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE CHICKEN.  THE CHICKEN WAS VERY MOIST AND TENDER.  MY HUSBAND WHO IS A PICKY EATER EVEN LIKED IT.

Best, most moist chicken we ever had!!  Made two slight substitutions, but it worked well.  Instead of evaporated milk, I used sour cream thinned with a bit of regular milk.  Walnuts in place of pecans.  Made four large bone-in breasts with skin -- baked  @ 350 for an hour, then browned them at 425 for about 5 min.  I took another's advice and sprayed the top of the coated chicken with Canola spray.  I rarely use oil spray for anything, so this was going out on a limb, but I'm here to say this was outstanding!

This was really good. My son made this for dinner. He added more paprika, some garlic powder and onion powder. Also used buttermilk instead of evaporated milk. Soaked the chicken in buttermilk for about 30 minutes. Baked these on cooling racks so it would crisp all over. Very easy recipe. Thanks!

Minus the nuts this was a hit with my husband and grandkids. I did add more salt on top the coating and baked them on a rack. Juicy and crispy, will make this again.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe and thought it turned out very good...my suggestions would be to chop the nuts a little finer than just chopped. If they're too big they won't stay on the chicken.  Secondly, cook on a rack.  I just baked mine on a foil lined baking sheet that had a rack laying across it and it wasn't soggy at all. My chicken was a little larger at a little over 4lbs. and I cooked for 1 hour and 10 mins and it turned out perfect.  Definitely saving this recipe.

Tasty and easy recipe. I just used bisquick instead of a buttermilk coating and it's plenty flavorful.

This was okay.  The breading felt very floury instead of crispy and the flavor was a little strange.  I won't make this again.

I've made this recipe multiple times, beginning with exactly the way it's written and then tweaking the spices to look for the "best mix."  Tonight I made it as written except that I substituted Old Bay seasoning for the paprika, and instead of a full cup of baking mix I used 2/3 baking mix and 1/3 panko breadcrumbs for the coating.  Very tasty.   I've always used skinless boneless chicken breasts with this recipe and maybe that's why I don't get that crispiness.   Still, a nice meal!

great recipe. I left out the pecans, and I think it was very tasty. I added garlic powder, dry ranch mix, and salt and pepper to the baking mix. My kids and husband loved it.
