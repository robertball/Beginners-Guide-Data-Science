I don't particularly like vodka. Why, you ask, am I making myself a 'Great White Cocktail?' Because I'm a huge fan of shark week and it is just sooo cute! The blood drops should not be optional! All that being said, this is one of the tastier Cosmo recipes I have tried. Couldn't find white cranberry juice in the entire grocery store, so it's Ocean Spray Wave Apple White Cranberry Cocktail. w00t
