This one is delicious and very rich. To save time I used pre-ade frozen puff pastry dough and lined he holes in a muffin tin with the dough to make individual cups. I cooked the cups first and then added the filling and cooked as directed. It made great little individual appetizers!

If you are pressed for time, I used the Betty Crocker Pie Crust in a box.  It seems to work just as good.  Also tried it without pine nuts and seemed to have a bolder taste to it.

Instead of messing with making my own pastry dough I used phyllo dough, which was an adventure...next time puff pastry! But the filling was delicious! It's very savory and bleu cheesy and was a huge hit with our guests. I also swapped out the pine nuts for slivered almonds (last minute error, I forgot to get the pine nuts!)

I modified this a bit.  Mine was more of a Tomato Blue Cheese Tart. I also used Pillsbury's ready-made pie crust for the bottom crust. Ricotta Cheese, Blue Cheese, Egg, topped with sliced Tomato. Delicious!  This would be fabulous to serve to company for a brunch.

I've gotten requests for this every holiday (and sometimes in between) since I first made this in 2002.  It is absolutely delicious

This was a very tasty appetizer!  My husband liked it.  I don't particularly care for bleu cheese, but this was good, not overpowering at all.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I substituted less dry parsley.

Not a bad recipe.  I've made it a couple of times and family generally likes this recipe but, I've modified it by reducing the amount of blue cheese in the recipe.  I found the full amount to be too overwhelming.
