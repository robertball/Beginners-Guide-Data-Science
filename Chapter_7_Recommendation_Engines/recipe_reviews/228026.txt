I did not have sugar free butter flavored syrup BUT what I did have was homemade butter flavored pancake syrup that I used in it's place (I assumed that's what the submitter meant.....for me, it turned out and that's really all I cared about). I also did not have mexican vanilla, I used a tablespoon of regular pure vanilla extract because that was all I had. I honestly did not have time to babysit it because I threw everything into the crockpot, tossed the ingredients together and put the lid on it and crossed my fingers that it would cook just fine while I was at work. When I got home from work, my kids and I were overwhelmed with the smell of awesome. I did remove the cover and cooked an additional 45 minutes, then I just dumped the apple butter into my food processor and pureed it until smooth. We had this spread on homemade yeast waffles this morning--oh. em. gee. This is AH-mazing. For real. Even without me here to babysit, it still turned out perfect. I'll use this recipe again. VERY impressed.

I made this just as recipe called for, only difference is that I couldn't get 10 lbs of apples into my crock pot.  So I measured 14 cups of chopped apples and found that was 7.5 lbs and adjusted recipe to fit.  With a diabetic husband, I'm always looking for low-sugar, yet tasty recipes, and this sure fills the bill for yummy apple butter! Already sharing the recipe!

I've made this the last two years and my kids love it!!  We make it when making applesauce and I've found the 10 lbs apples equates to about 12 cups applesauce.  I omitted the sugar-free butter syrup and added 1/4C dark brown sugar (or less).  Cooking it overnight with the lid cracked works great and smells wonderful.
