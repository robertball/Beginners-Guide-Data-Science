I made this for the Recipe Group. I didn't want to mess around with all the layers, so I didn't. I will probably make it again, but I might change it up a bit! Thanks :)!

This is the yummiest dessert EVER if you like coffee flavored stuff.  I doubled the filling and used 3-4 cups oreo crumbs and put it in a 9X13 instead of a loaf pan. came out awesome! Also for people that don't like a really strong coffee layer just mix it both layers together for a milder taste, still delicious!

I made this recipe for Recipe Group, I didn't want it to go to waste or eat it all myself so I cut the recipe down enough to fill 3 smallish dessert glasses. To reduce the fat a bit I used fat free condensed milk, I also did not add the butter to the cookies but just used the crumbs. Low fat cream cheese would have helped reduce the fat too. I initially froze it as directed but decided to serve it from the fridge which made it very creamy and light, almost like a mousse. The cream cheese flavor was a little overpowering but that was probably due to reducing the recipe. Both my daughter and I enjoyed this. A small portion is very satifying.

One of my kids doesn't like coffee, he and his sister ate the whole piece between them. I too forgot to add the butter to the crumbs, it really didn't need it (saved a few calories). Hubby thought it was really good. Rich and creamy.  The coffee flavor was just perfect.:) I found a can of sweetened condensed milk with 1/2 the sugar.  I wanted a bit more contrast so I added more crumbs to the middle. This was just wonderful on a hot summer evening. Thank you Andy, I will make this again!

I made this as the Recipe Exchange Group Recipe for the week of August 30th. I say 3, husband says 5, we'll go with a 4. To me this is ultra-sweet and ultra-rich, richer than ice cream actually, and much sweeter too, but it's still good, don't get me wrong. I certainly won't have any qualms about finishing small servings. My husband suggested we eat this for dinner every night instead of real food :o) Chocolate and coffee, both right up his alley! Thanks for the recipe!

Really yummy! I replaced the whipped cream with cool-whip for DH's sake. Probably will do it in a casserole dish next time with just two layers, only because it was a pain working with the crumb mixture in the loaf pan. Definitely a keeper!

This is a great make ahead desert. ( to keep on hand) Once this is frozen I slice it and wrap individual pieces  in wax paper.  Keep in the freezer.
