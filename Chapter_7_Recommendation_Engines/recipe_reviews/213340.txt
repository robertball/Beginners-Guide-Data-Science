Excellent! I made this recipe as written, except I doubled it and sauteed the cabbage for the Colcannon in my bacon pan instead of microwaving. The stew will thicken and reduce, so be careful with the salt - I added half before putting in the oven and then (very lightly) salted to taste when it was done. The Colcannon is perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a fantastic recipe! I made the stew with a can of Guinness beer. After browning the meat in a skillet I threw everything in the crockpot and cooked on low for 7 hours. The meat was very tender. The colcannon was delicious. I made the entire dish ahead of time and microwaved it when we were ready to eat. The stew and colcannon combination is really good together. The adults loved it and my kids ate it without complaints!

I never rate a recipe as I rely on the women to tell if its good or not. But this stew has to be spoken up about. It is purely a mans stew. Strong and robust I made this on a hunting trip with my buds they just loved it. It realy is great

Holy moly, this recipe is amazing. I only had 2lb of meat on hand, but treated the recipe as the original 8 servings for the remaining ingredients. This is so delicious. I used 4 cloves of garlic because I love it, and since I had ground thyme instead of dried leaves, used 1/2 tsp. When browning the meat, I salted and peppered the meat to impart flavor throughout the cooking process, but still added the salt and pepper called for later in the recipe. For the colcannon, I used about 3 times the milk called for. These changes are all minor, and I would trust this recipe over and over! It's wonderful! Can't wait to eat it again, and I'm still finishing my plate. :) **Update: Don't use Guinness! I used Guinness the 2nd time I made this and the bitterness was overwhelming for my 2lbs of meat and really ruined the dish for me. Using a less bitter beer is the way to go.

This was excellent! I didn't have any dark beer so I just used regular beer but added a bit of molasses. I also only had a pound of stewing beef so decided to try something completely different - I added about a pound of boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into cubes. Used red cabbage instead of green because that's what I had in the fridge. Gave the potatoes a unique colour. Overall the flavour of the whole meal was superb - especially the potato cabbage bacon combination. And like others I did not cook the cabbage in the microwave - I sauteed it a bit in the bacon pan. Definitely a keeper! (My mouth is watering just thinking of this dinner - we had it last night and I could eat it again tonight but alas no leftovers!)

Excellent! As someone who is not a fan of corned beef I was looking for another main dish I could serve. This was it! I did brown the meat and coat it in flour as the recipe directs but then I put all ingredients in the slow cooker for 7 or 8 hrs on low. Perfect! Also didn't want to hear it from my critics about "ruining" their mashed potatoes with cabbage so I pureed the cooked cabbage and then blended it into the potatoes. It did have a very light green tint but I made no replys to the comments and no one was the wiser!:) I also held out the bacon pieces and let those who like bacon add it at the table. If everyone likes bacon I would definately not leave this out as it gave the colcannon a finishing touch. This is definately a keeper! Thank you for the great recipe.

Word to the wise. Do not use Guinness Stout. My guinness loving husband and I found it so bitter as to be inedible. I have strained off the broth and I am trying to rescue it with beef broth and seasonings. This seems unfair to rate since it appears the beer is at fault. i have had several friends who made it and they loved it, but they did not use a bitter stout. Thanks for sharing.

This is a terrific flavored stew. I omitted the flour and used guiness beer. Even though I only used 1lb of beef I kept the same ratio of braising liquid and braised on the stove top covered for 3 hours 15 minutes to a tender meat. I don't bother with thick sauces or reducing - the flavor of the braising liquid and the veg and meat was like an au jus over the colcannon. Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly and I think it would have turned out really good except that I used an extra stout beer which made the stew really bitter.  Fortunately, I found a nother recipe that called for extra stout beer + 3/4C chopped prunes to offset the bitterness.  I had some prunes on hand so I added them and cooked it for another 45 minutes.  Those prunes saved the dish and disintegrate into the broth almost completely.  Next time I make it I'll use half beef broth 
and half beer + the prunes.  Mmmm.

A couple of reviewers have mentioned using Guinness beer without the stew being bitter.  Don't make the mistake of thinking all Guinness is equal.  There is a huge difference between canned/bottled Guinness Draught beer and Guinness Extra Stout beer (available in bottles only - without the little widget that makes the Draught beer foamy).  Guinness Extra Stout has double the alcohol and significantly more hops than its Draught cousin.  If you make this recipe with Guinness Extra Stout you WILL have a bitter stew on your hands.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because of the calcannon.  1/4 cup of milk was not nearly enough and I ended up using three times that amount to get the consistency I wanted.  I also "made it naughty" by using 1/2 C butter + 2 teaspoons of the rendered bacon fat (I omitted the salt).  Not exactly healthy but oh so good!

Sooooo good! Used the slow cooker so I did have to add two cups of beef broth to keep the veggies under liquid the entire cooking time (7 hours on low). Then I thickened it at the end with some flour because we like a thicker stew. It was amazing! The colcannon was delicious as written! Used the leftovers for shepherd's pie after adding some peas. Two meals in one! Who could ask for more? Try this recipe!!

This recipe is AMAZING! I didn't have a dutch oven. I made the stew in a pot on top of the stove then put it into a casserole dish to bake in the oven. I never had a good "stew recipe" before. I followed it exactly and got nothing but huge raves. The gravy is dark and so very flavorful. You must serve with biscuits for dunking. Thank you so much for sharing this one.

I made this Gluten Free (by substituting Red Bridge gluten free beer and my gluten free flour mix my recipe on here or use rice flour.) This was incredibly flavorful despite my not having bay leaves or thyme!! (I sprinkled in some marjoram instead.) I will also try it in a crock pot. I'm sure my Irish great-grandmother must have made this!

I was so happy with how this stew turned out. The only changes I made were to use pre-cubed beef stew meat Guinness instead of beer and pre-crumbled bacon for the colcannon (I ran out of time and just so happened to have some in my refrigerator). The colcannon was just buttery enough and the cabbage was perfectly cooked. I always hand-mash my potatoes so that's the only change I made to the methods. The stew had the perfect amount of liquid and the beef was so tender. The carrots didn't turn to mush which I was concerned about. The overall flavor was excellent. My husband even loved it! I will definitely make this recipe in the future. In fact I'm thinking about serving it to friends next time we have them over for dinner.

This is the only beef stew recipe I can imagine ever using again. I made it as written it was delicious. I doubled the beer to make it soupier and added about 1 1/2 tb of brown sugar to cut the bitterness and it was delicious. I made it today but just added the potatoes diced used 32 oz of beef stock (had a recovering alcoholic eating with us) and a fresh tomato and it was delicious. Can't really go wrong with this one.

Very delicious hearty and rich. I didn't have any really dark beers around so I fittingly used and Irish Red Ale(one I actually homebrewed!) in this recipe and all of my friends loved it it got demolished(in a good way). I would definitely make again.

This was outstanding - Thanks so much for the recipe! Even my picky husband raved over it. Apart from using twice as much milk in the potatoes I made this exactly as written. I didn't uncover after 45 minutes though because it didn't need to be reduced any further. Next time I'm going to increase the beer a bit but that's all. This recipe is a winner!

We tried this recipe for the first time on Sunday evening. I've never tried Colcannon before and it is delicious! I found it amazing that mixing simple ingredients such as mashed potatoes cabbage and bacon could make such a wonderful combination! My oldest daughter is not a fan of mashed potatoes or cabbage but she ate a plate full of the Colcannon! The stew for me was average (3-4 stars) but I honestly believe it was due to an error that I made. I did not buy the right kind of roast meat and I didn't add enough beer. My stew ran out of liquid so I added broth and it didn't come out very flavorful. The beef flavor of the meat I chose (it was on sale) was overpowering. I still give the recipe 5 stars though because I think it would be 5 stars if I had done it correctly. The heavenly Colcannon deserves 5 stars on its own! Even with the errors everyone said it was very good and they want me to make it again on St. Patrick's Day! I definitely want to give it another try this time using the right meat. I'm excited to see how it turns out this time around. Thanks for the great recipe!

This stew is grand! I have made many stews so far but they always seemed to be missing something. This stew however embodied the flavors I expect of a stew...full rich and savory! I doubled the carrots and onions and took a German Schwarzbier instead of a Guinness to give the stew a little more body....it was sublime! So good that it would make a good low budget Christmas dinner!

My only complaint about this was there wasn't enough!!! OMG this was sooo good! The meat was incredibly tender it melted in my mouth. There was five of us and the whole thing totally disappeared! I also used guiness - no trouble with bitterness. I think this was better than corn beef and cabbage. I added a couple of tablespoons of sour cream to the colcannon to enhance the creaminess. Deliciousness!

Delicious! I think next time I will add more carrots and onions to it and maybe even throw in some turnip. I might add some beef stock to it next time as well so there is a little more gravy. I used more garlic than it called for and a little less worcestershire sauce so it was more to our tastes. I didn't microwave the cabbage because there is really no need. I just put it in with the potatoes for the last 5 or 10 minutes and strained it all together. It was fabulous! Definitely one of our faves!

Great flavor all around! There wasn't as many vegetables as I would have liked. I think I would add more carrots and maybe some green beans to the stew and cut back on the beef a little bit.

Wonderful flavor wonderful aroma. I used beer I had on had instead of dark beer but it's hard to imagine this could taste any better than it did. I've never reviewed anything on this site before but this is so good I had to rate it. My husband who usually just eats what's put before him raved about it too.

Excellent recipe! I used Guiness and some extra seasonings on the meat. I also simmered it with the lid on for several hours and the meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender! I took this to a St Patrick's Day dinner and it was a huge hit! Next time I am going to save myself a huge amount of time by buying stew meat that is already cut up! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

If I could give this a 6 stars rating I would. This was amazing. My picky kids even liked it. I did however change a couple of things. I added salt and pepper to the meat while searing. I also didn't use a roast but rather already cut stew meat which made it easier. I cooked it for 8 hours on low in a crock pot. I also added a flour rue to thicken the stew towards the end. It was perfect! Oh and I used a 14oz can of Guiness!!

The beef was fantastic this way. Cutting up the meat was the biggest chore and all the work is on the front end. The only change I made from the recipe was to saute the cabbage in a bit of the bacon grease instead of microwaving it.

A new family fave! Changes: Put in the slow cooker for 8-9 hrs on low I still browned the meat and I used olive oil. Added beef broth as needed and sauce was still very thick. Added about 2 cups of beef broth. Used instant red potatoes

Followed other reviews: Made the recipe for 8 as written but used only 2 lbs of meat for family of four and enjoyed some leftovers of this great dish! Sauteed cabbage in the bacon pan after removing most of the grease. Used 3x the milk for colcannon. Salted meat before browning and added the salt called for but it ended up a bit too salty will stick to recipe next time.

First let me say that ANY stew that gets 5 stars from me is outstanding...I'm NOT a stew lover! Add to that I'm not a fan of things braised in beer. And that's ALL this is braised in. But boy we both loved this; did not change the recipe at all. And it will be repeated...in fact I'll probably double the recipe next time so I can freeze it!

I used just the stew part of the recipe and OMG yum. I browned the beef and threw all the other ingredients into the crockpot to cook throughout the day. I used a bottle of Killian's Irish Red. My roomies loved it too I was quite stingy with the leftovers I'm afraid!;)

This was the hit of our St. Patrick's Potluck! I made the colcannon with turkey bacon and it came out great! Like it so much I plan on making that as a side for other dishes. The beauty of it is that it was so flavorful none of the kids realized they were eating a veggie along with the potatoes! Great recipes! Thanks!

YUMM! Really really really tasty! I'm making this frequently from now on. I used guiness and it was delish! Next time I'm just going to get already cut stew meat because it took forever to cut it into chunks and remove all the fat!

Made this on St. Patrick's day since my husband is not a corned beef fan and I am really glad I did. Such a wonderful and flavorful dish and the beef was unbelievably tender. Also loved the colcannnon! I made it almost exactly as written except I added a bit more milk and salt to the colcannon. I also added a little corn starch to the beef liquid to make it more gravy consistency. I used Harp Irish beer for the beef and it worked well. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. My husband does not want me to wait until next St. Patricks Day to make this again!

This recipe is definitely a keeper!!! The flavors all meld together so well and it is a wonderful meal to make for St. Patrick's Day! I did add extra onions and carrots since I like to have a few more veggies in the stew. I used Guinness for the beer and it was great. The only change I made was for the colcannon. As suggested by other reviewers I sauteed the cabbage in the bacon fat rather than using the microwave. The flavor was amazing! Thanks so much for the recipe - it got rave reviews last night at our St. Patrick's Day/College Basketball party!

Delicious crowd-pleaser! I will definitely make this again. Changes I'd make: 2 cups of onions and 2 cups of carrots (because I like lots of veggies and they sort of disappear in the beef mixture)... add 2 cups of celery and add another cup of cabbage to the colcannon. This meal absolutely needs soda bread on the side so don't serve it without it! There's some excellent juices that would go to waste without some matching Irish bread to soak them up;)

Made exactly as written using Guinness Stout for the dark beer. I did add some mushrooms (sautéed) that I had in the fridge and I'd do that the next time too. The colcannon is good enough to stand on its own as a side dish. Very different from any beef stew that I've ever had but we really enjoyed it.

Fabulous! I won't be saving this for just St. Patrick's Day. It's very flavorful and the meat is so tender it melts in your mouth. As for the colcannon it was wonderful too. I followed another reviewer's advice and cooked the cabbage in the bacon grease as opposed to steaming it in the microwave. That's definitely the way to go in my opinion. Not healthy but delicious!

So delicious! Very Rich flavor. I added an additional 6 oz. of Guinness then at the end of cooking tightened up the sauce with a cornstartch and cold water slurry. The sauce was so silky! Highly recommend this recipe. Made it for a potluck and not only did it get RAVE reviews but the dishes came home empty!

I wanted something different for St. Paddy's day so I thought I'd try this recipe. It was good but the beer was so strong it overpowered everything else so it wasn't as yummy as it could've been. Next time I would water the beer down and I think it would make it taste a lot better.

This is such an great recipe. Very rich and decadent tasting. I used a big can of Guinness for the beer and the stew was awesome. Never had Colcannon before but it was so good. I cooked the cabbage in the bacon grease just for added flavor and had to stop myself from eating all the cooked cabbage by itself. Thanks so much for an excellent recipe!

5 stars! I sort of followed the recipe. I did as any cook would do and jazzed it up; a little of this and a pinch of that. My stove broke as I was preparing this dish so out came the crock pot. I did the bacon dripping thing on the cabbage; was great. Really the cabbage dish is a meal unto itself. Got raves!

This was fantastic. I followed the recipe cooking methods and plating near exact. I realized the beef I bought was only 2lbs and not 3 but used it anyhow. I highly recommend buying the beef pre-cut or having the butcher do it. That was the most time consuming part. I have a covered microwave bacon cooker so I just cooked it that way. It saves on dishes and mess. I also did a thick cut bacon and cooked it until very crisp. I weighed the 2 large russet potatoes I used and they came out to be about 1.5 lbs and so I just used that amount. For the beer I used a bottle of Sam Adam's as that was what I had. I liked the stew but found the colcannon to be absolutely delicious. It is so creamy! The only downside is I only got about 4 servings. However I enjoyed the meal and the two recipe parts complimented each other well. TY Happy St. Patricks Day!

I made it pretty much exactly as written except after braising I put it all in the crock pot on high for 4-5 hours. Only other change is that I cooked the bacon in the microwave rather than a pan and it was low-sodium bacon. Used a can of Guinness. Came out gorgeous - not bitter. Husband says it's a 5 star meal. One reviewer commented that it'd be better with more veg and I agree - another couple carrots would be good. I'm glad I didn't reduce the broth because I really like lots of broth with the colcannon. Husband prefers less broth but that's easy enough to do when serving - just use a slotted spoon. Surprisingly the colcannon wasn't as nice on its own (I tried it out of curiosity). The cabbage stands out too much with its inconsistent texture. But with the stew it's incredible.

I'm not real fond of Irish stew but it was a great combination served over the top of colcannon. While the colcannon was also good I can't say that I would make this one again. There are better colcannon recipes out there.

I have to add my voice to the chorus!! I had this dish a bit ago and it was SO good! Easy fantastic recipe. I made the stew exactly as written except at the end I felt it wasn't soupy enough for me so I added some beef broth. I have made colcannon a couple of times and this is definitely the best. My only change was I used half potato and half celery root to reduce carbs and because I prefer that combo better.

I hate to be such a downer but this was not to my liking at all.:( Admittedly I only made the stew part of this recipe so I am basing my opinion solely on that part of it. Since I was only cooking for two people I scaled everything by half (I made 4 servings worth expecting leftovers). As such I used half a bottle of beer (Guinness Stout) - but I wish I would have used the entire bottle instead.... After removing the lid from my Dutch oven (i.e. after the first 45 minutes) my stew wasn't as saucy as I thought it "should" be. By the time I took my stew out of the oven most of the liquid had completely evaporated. My meat was dry and overcooked and the stew itself had a bitter aftertaste. Considering this was the star of our St. Paddy's Day meal everything else I served with it lost its appeal as well. Maybe this will float your boat but it did absolutely nothing for me. Thanks anyways MNIKOLAISEN.:-)

I will be making this again! it was really good! i wanted something besides corned beef for st pat's day. I didn't have the dark beer. But it was still wonderful... i was really wondering if those potatoes with cabbage and bacon would be good. That was the best part my husband even liked it and said he would like it again too. It was very filling. I did not make a bunch of it though. I made the stew in my pressure cooker because i came home to late to bake it.

Since I often cook for company I am always looking for new recipes & since it is almost St. Patrick's Day I was looking for something Irish. I had never heard of Colcannon & thought it looked interesting even though I thought cabbage in mashed potatoes a bit unusual I was game. Made it last night to serve tonight but since I had never had it before my husband & I had it for dinner last night. YUM! It was delicious & the meat was so tender! I did make some changes out of necessity. Had no beer so I used molasses instead & it was SO good! Tonight I added peas ( because I was afraid there wouldn't be enough - for leftover's tomorrow!) & it was wonderful! Everyone ate it up! I liked it better without the peas but I still give it 5 stars! I will be making this again & again!

I wanted to serve this for a Wednesday night church meal for about 90 people. I used O'Douls non-alcholic beer and added a can of beef broth and cooked it in a roaster oven for about 8-10 hours. The meat was falling apart tender. For the colcannon I used Hormel real bacon bits and Idahoan Brand instant potaotes to save time. The onlly other change was I forgot the fresh parsely. I had never made this before so I'm not sure how the O'Douls changed the tastte but everyone sure raved about it. I'm not a big cabbage fan but the potatoes were great. Just a note: I always use the Idahoan instant potatoes for church meals and large gatherings and you can't tell the difference. Excellant recipe.

My review is based only on the Irish Stew portion as I didn't make the colcannon. The meat turned out very well and was fall apart good. The stew was good but I feel it needs something else to give it a flavor boost. Next time I would definately add more veggies. I felt the meat to veggie ratio was way off and needed more color and substance. All in all a good recipe that could be great with a few tweaks.

I really wanted to like this by the number of high reviews but this didn't work at all for us. I made exactly as the recipe stated using Guinness dark beer. It turned out unbelievably strong and bitter. The colcannon had good flavor but we couldn't eat the stew at all. Recipe called for dark beer....maybe the problem was using Guinness but this did not work for us.

Excellent! Excellent...I sauted the cabbage in the bacon pan and cooked the stew in the crock pot; but other than that followed the recipe to a tee. this will be done again and again.

I made this in my pressure cooker for St. Patrick's day! It was wonderful. I cooked the stew for 20 min. at 15psi after browning the beef and then I cooked the diced potatoes and chopped kale in the pressure cooker for 6min. on a steamer with one cup of water. I did omit the bacon! I am in love with this kale potato recipe! And I will not save it for just St. Patrick's day! This is going in my regular menu! Thanks for a great recipe.

DELICIOUS!! Made it exactly as written except for 1 bay leaf instead of 2 (ran out). SOOOO good. Flavorful tender meat and carrots with "gravy" that was flavorful but not over powering of any one flavor. As good as the stew was the potatoes are what set it apart and made this such an amazing dish. The only change would be to add more fresh parsley because it gives it such a unique taste (although this isn't necessary). Made this for St. Patricks Day but loved it so much it will be made again before next year. Thanks for the easy restaurant quality meal!

I really didn't think my family would like it because of the Guinness. No fear. It was loved and my husband even commented that Colcannon was needed to balance the rich flavor of the stew preferring it to plain mashed potatoes. Thank goodness for an alternative to corned beef. Next time I'm going to try it with lamb.

So yummy! This recipe is very similar to how I usually make my beef stew. I loved the idea of serving the stew over colcannon instead of adding potatoes to the stew. It was one of those "why didn't I think of that?" moments! Made a couple of minor modifications as some reviewers mentioned: used about 3/4 cup of milk for the colcannon and sauteed the shredded cabbage in the bacon fat. And because I like them I used about a pound of baby carrots in the stew. Otherwise I followed the recipe as is. All I had on hand was Sam Adams Winter Lager and it was tasty but next time I think I'll use Guiness (and a little brown sugar to cut the bitterness)like I usually do for my beef stew. And there will definitley be many next times!

I was very impressed with this recipe. It does take some time to cook but the results were great. I didn't have a dark beer at the time. I used one cup light beer and 1/3 cup port wine. Again very good. My only suggestion would be to up the amount of ingredients especially the colcannon. I followed the directions as is for 8 servings and only got about 4 decent size servings.

I looked for a St Patrick's Day meal that didn't involve either corned beef or lamb and this is what I chose. We were not disappointed! I used a red beer instead of a dark (because that was what I had in the house) and like some other reviewers I cooked the cabbage in the bacon drippings rather than the microwave. I did wind up thickening the stew liquid with more flour before I served it which made a rich and tangy gravy. I used a bit less meat and added more carrots and onions but that is just a personal preference. Since I didn't have a Dutch oven I simmered the pot on the top of the stove at low heat for a couple of hours and the beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender. Serving the stew on top of the colcannon was a wonderful combination. This is a definite keeper! But getting 8 servings from it as written? Not in my house - perhaps we just enjoyed it TOO much!

Made this stew and colcannon for our St. Patrick's Day dinner. It was very delicious. Meat came out super tender and I loved the flavor of the stew. I used Yuengling Black and Tan. The colcannon was delish also. I will probably add more cabbage next time because I love cabbage. I didn't microwave the cabbage I reserved a little bit of the bacon fat and fried the cabbage until it was tender. It is very filling.

I was very concerned about the negative reviews claiming that this stew was bitter using Guinness Draught. Ignore them! This stew has fantastic flavor. The coffee/burnt flavor of beer gives the stew a different yet remarkable taste. The thing I did change from the original recipe is that I simmered the chuck roast pieces with the seasonings and some beef broth in the Dutch oven for about 45 minutes prior to adding the beer and vegetables. I then cooked in the oven as directed to assure that the meat was melt in your mouth tender without having mushy carrots and onions. I also added some celery that I had in the refrigerator. This stew served over the Colcannon is a keeper. Thanks

Awesome! Big hit when I brought it in to work on St Patricks Day. I added more beer than it called for to make more broth/sauce. Just added a bit more of the seasonings to make up for it. Colcannon was awesome to. Recipe very easy to make I did not stray far from recipe at all.

This turned out well for my St. Patty's dinner but I would add the following chances. I added 4 carrots total and still would add more if you want more gravy at the end of cooking then add 2 c. of half beef broth half chicken broth and leave the lid on while it cooks in the oven. I only had 1/2 c at most with 1 c.

This is our new go-to stew recipe...made this for St. Patrick's Day since we had just had corned beef and cabbage...everyone was raving over it and my son said this is his new favorite meal!! Won't make beef stew any other way from now on!! (Did use 2 cans of Guiness Draught though to make enough sauce)...and also sauted the cabbage in the bacon fat as another reviewer suggested:-)

My husband and I made this recipe together for a Pre-St. Patty's Day celebration dinner. It turned out very nice! We cooked the beer braised beef for half the time (we also halved the recipe and used 1lb of meat instead of 3lbs) and it still came out delicious. We took a slight detour with the cabbage. Instead of Microwaving it we sated it w/ turkey bacon and eliminated the salt. Enjoying left overs today.

Prepared this exactly according to instructions. Very good. Husband and stepson raved! Used Guinness draught not Guinness stout. Guinness draught is very smooth and not bitter in the least. It has a ping pong like ball in the can called a widget. It is supposed to be there so don't freak out.

This stew is Great! The Colcannon is good too but I like Diane's Colcannon a little better. So I make this stew and Diane's Colcannon (which I use diced ham instead of the bacon) for St. Patty's Day! Can't wait till St. Patty's Day; can almost smell that stew acookin.

This has a wonderful flavor and easy to make! Made without preplanning so I didnt have any cabbage so just made the mashed potatoes. My entire family loved it. I had an Oktoberfest beer to use and it tasted great not bitter at all. I used chuck steak vs. roast which made it quicker to cube as that is what I had planned to cook and was just looking for a different recipe. Will be making this alot in the future.

Best stew I ever made. Followed other suggestions and used Guiness draught not stout. Cooked this on low in my crock pot and it was perfect. There is no 'beer' taste to this - just a very good broth. Also for the potatoes I sauteed the cabbage and also some chopped green onions in the bacon grease before adding in with the mashed potatoes. Wonderful!

Oh. My. Gosh. - This was absolutely delicious! Like others I browned the meat and then put it in a crockpot with everything else and it was done in 7 or 8 hours. I used the Guiness Stout not Extra Stout beer and that eliminated the bitterness some complained about. For the colcannon I quick-sautéed the cabbage in the bacon grease to give just a little more flavor. We ate this last night and my husband is already asking when I'll make it again!

Out of this world good. I think i read about 200 reviews before making this dish i had such anxiety that i popped a xanax mid way through prep. What beer? what beer? bitter? not bitter... I finally said to heck with this im using whatever i have in the fridge. I found a guinness extra stout ( my irish friends leftovers) and one funky buddha Wheat beer called floridian. We live in south florida. Anyway I went with the wheat for fear of a bitter stew. I thankfully took the advice of the majority of reviews and used bacon grease with the cabbage and added a boatload of carrots used two large onions. I doubled the Colcannon. Did this whole meal on stovetop with my 26 dollar Crofton 5 1/2 QT Cast Iron Dutch oven. yes folks 26 bucks..does everything yours does.:)- total time is close about 2.45 hours from start to finish. I got a heck of a workout with the prep for this meal. Please sharpen your Chef's Knife before prep. Started prepping at 4pm was eating just before 7pm.

This is outstanding! Made as written however I added a cup of celery as well. It was in the garden along with the carrots and cabbage so i thought what the hay! Let's add celery too! This is going to be a regular dish in our household now. Can't wait to make it for the extended family! Yum!

Definitely should have made more potatoes! I was skeptical that I would not be able to get the cabbage past my boys and they loved it. I use white pepper and sour cream in my potatoes and used Sam Adams winter lager for beer. Outstanding and will definitely make again with double the colcannon.

Fantastic! I pan seared my beef and then cooked for about 5 hours on low in a crockpot. It came out perfect. As for the potatoes they are perfect as is but I added some dried minced onion and a little cream cheese and sour cream which makes them a little creamier. This goes great with the Irish Soda Bread from this site.

So easy and so delicious! I love the idea of serving the stew over Colcannon instead of putting potatoes in the stew. It made the dish so rich and creamy. I will definitely adding this to my winter recipe repertoire.

This "Beer Braised Irish Stew and Colcannon" recipe was very delicious! I actually hate the taste of beer but I wanted to make an authentic ale-based recipe from the land of my ancestors just for the experience. I was pleasantly surprised that the exceptionally flavorful gravy didn't taste anything at all like beer. I can't think of any way to improve this recipe: it is perfect "as is." I will be making it again many many more times. Thank you MNIKOLAISEN for sharing your recipe!

This recipe is amazing! If you cook it in the dutch oven it reduces to a thick gravy consistency. I did use the extra stout Guinness and loved it. It was not too bitter. When it reduced it was rich and chocolaty! I did not make the mashed potatoes because I live in the South. I know how to do mashed potatoes!;)

This was fantastic. I made mine with a milk stout. Much better than Guinness which tends to be on the bitter side when cooking. I changed some things here and there as i do using all recipes however this is a fine road map. Regarding the Colcannon I fried the cabbage in bacon fat and butter instead of steaming it in the microwave. It was the best colcannon i have ever had even as good as the Au Poitin Stil in Lutherhville Md.

Great - thanks for the recipe! I made this for the first time on St Patrick's Day and had thought I found the go-to recipe for each future St Patrick's Day meal until my wife exclaimed that she is not willing to wait a whole year to have it again. She normally eats like a bird but so thoroughly enjoyed the recipe that she had two healthy helpings! I am OK with making it again soon because I thought the recipe was absolutely terrific as well! I made it as per the recipe and I did use a 440ml (15 oz) can of Guiness Draught in the stew. Thanks again for the recipe! ": )

I used Yards Brewing Company's "Love Stout" it turned out so amazing! I actually loved it and I don't like anything cooked with beer. (I made this recipe as a surprise for my husband) We will make this again! (Finely chop the cabbage instead of slicing) (I also had a hard time getting it to thicken so I added a bit of corn starch)

So flavourful! I used a Montreal brewed beer called 'St Ambroise Scotch Ale'. Delish!!! I'm sure the beer you use is everything in this recipe so choose wisely. I only had stewing beef on hand so that's what I used. The Colcannon was also good. I had to add another 1/4 cup milk to give it the consistency I was after. Don't wait for St. Patty's day to make this one. It's a terrific easy stew recipe. Thanks much MNIKOLAISEN.

This was amazing. I used a lighter beer after hearing reviews saying the Guinness was too bitter (I used New Belgium Fat Tire which is an amber). I had a large roast (probably close to 4lbs) so I doubled the liquid/flour. I did find that it reduced too much by the time the meat was cooked so I added a couple of splashes of beef stock at the end. This was so good I have never been a fan of corned beef so I will definitely be making this a new St. Patty's day tradition!

Oh my gosh this is soooooooo good! I have to admit to being skeptical about cabbage and parsley mixed in mashed potatoes but the combination of flavors was incredible. The recipe was followed exactly except for substituting a bottle of Coke for the dark beer. This was served to our youth group for St.Patrick s Day dinner and they came back for seconds and thirds. My husband was bummed that there wasn t much left over for him to eat. This is definitely something we ll have again! Thank you for sharing!

This is fantastic! It's absolutely my favorite stew recipe and I will be making this a lot. The family loved it as well and requested no changes. I made a couple of additions to suit our family. For the gravy I added about 3 cups beef broth (we like lots of gravy) and did 3Tbl flour instead of two. For the colcannon include some onion or shallots fry the onion and cabbage in your bacon grease.

Gave it 4 stars only because it won't be a weekly dinner.  It was delicious, but does take a while to cook.  The slow roasting I think is what gives it the sumptuous flavor.  Note:  I didnt have beer, so I used broth instead.

this was excellent. I fixed this for a crowd and the whole family raved. the only thing I did different was to brown my bacon onion and cabbage together. the stew part has such wonderful flavor perfectly seasoned too. This was served as part of a family St. Patrick's celebration but this is such good comfort food I can see where this would be a great fall/winter hearty meal.

This was yummy. Next time during the second part of the braising process if I do it in the oven I need to remember to stir every 15 minutes or so. The top part was pretty brown and dried out when I took it out so I stirred and put the lid back on to rehydrate so that was fine. Flavor was great.

FANTASTIC!!! I don't have an Irish bone in my body so I was a little hesitant to attempt a truly Irish dinner but went for it since it's St. Patrick's Day. I used Guiness beer. Instead of a dutch oven I simmered it on the stove top for 45 min covered and 20 min uncovered. I also cooked the cabbage instead of microwaving it. Super hearty and really delicious. Great recipe that doesn't need any ingredient tweaking.

I made this in the crock pot. I have a timer so it cooked for 6 hours. (I like things that work while I sleep). Cooled it and put it in the fridge to reheat for dinner. The hubz gave it 5 stars. I made the potatoes with red potato but next time will use the potato type the recipe calls for. BUT....I had to make another batch because my husband ate the whole thing. Its delicious and we both loved it.

I followed the recipe with a few additions. I added more carrots after the sauce was cooked and can see that you can easily add other vegetables as well. I used more garlic and as suggested by another review I used a draught beer and their was no bitterness. While the Colcannon was really nice tasting it was too much Next time I will serve it on the side and not make a well as suggested.

This is my favorite stew recipe. It is delicious! Sometimes I don't have time to make the colcannon so I just throw in some diced potatoes and it's just as good.I make this all winter long.

Phenomenal recipe that needed no tweaks. The only (minor) difference in my prep was to saute the cabbage with the bacon, because duh, bacon renderings make everything amazing. I used a robust Porter that I enjoy drinking. Be wary of your beer choice! If you don't like it's finish to begin with, you won't start to like it as a concentrated sauce! My little kids gobbled this just as enthusiastically as the adults.

This entire recipe is exceptional. I don't understand what happened with some people and Guiness but I used a bottle of Guiness Extra Stout and it was NOT bitter in the least!

This was very good as is. FYI not meant for guiness Extra Stout use the guiness in the black cans (4-pack I believe) The Calcannon was a nice suprise. Though After we ran out we used boiled potatoes from the corn beef and that may have been a better fit with the stew. Next time I will add potatoes to this towards the end and make Calcannon with another entree.

This came out great but I tweaked it by adding a bit more of the herbs than called for using Breckenridge vanilla porter instead Irish stout and short ribs for the meat. Also skipped the bacon (hubby won't eat pork).

I never write reviews but I had to come back and write one for this recipe. It is crazy delicious. We are not beer people at this house but it does something wonderful to the gravy like stew and did not find it to be bitter at all. Good heavens I could eat this forever. I did not make the potato/cabbage combo I just made my typical mashed potatoes and put the stew on top for convenience. When I checked the roast after the first 45 min. in the oven I questioned needing the extra 45 but I am glad I followed the directions. The extra time make the roast extremely tender. The only thing I would do differently next time is add twice as many carrots. They cook down so there is not alot to go around. Great job on this recipe!!

I made the stew in my enameled cast iron Dutch oven using Guinness. Delicious!! I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked the cabbage in some of the bacon grease and I believe that added so much more flavor to the Colcannon. Wonderful recipe I ll definitely be making it again!

This was just fantastic. I followed the recipe almost exact except I cooked the cabbage in the bacon fat and steam with water. I used a local porter beer with no sour taste. Even my 2 year old gobbled it up. Truly is a rich and delicious dish.

The stew was very good but could use a little more seasoning. I used Guinness Draught Stout which turned out great. I would not use cabbage again in the colcannon maybe leeks.

VERY good. Received rave reviews from everyone. Only things I altered were adding about twice the amounts of carrots and onions in the stew. I didn't have any true dark beer on hand so used Fat Tire instead and still tasted awesome. Will definitely make again and will use the Colcannon recipe as a side dish for other meals too!

The Guinness was very very bitter. But I concluded that early enough to balance it out with a packet of Splenda and a splash of the red wine blend we were drinking.

I didn't have any Guinness so used another beer which the recipe says is OK. It was beyond bitter and inedible. But I had company coming for dinner on St. Pat's day and had to serve it. Fortunately I tasted it half way through the baking process and added apple cider vinegar beef bone broth and sugar. I kept tasting after each addition and finally after the sugar was added it was very good. Before returning it to the oven for the final 45 minutes I added another tbs of flour. Served with the colcannon which was delicious and my guests ate it up. I will use red wine next time I make this.

Excellent! I used a Lodge Deep Iron Skillet to cook in subbed coke for beer (I'm married to a Baptist preacher and couldn't get a deacon to go get the beer for me LOL). I used 1 whole Venison Loin instead of beef because it's what I had on hand. After browning meat per instructions I pressure cooked it in about 2 cups of chicken broth for 20 minutes before returning to skillet added extra carrots because I love them (about 5) along with coke spices etc. After bringing to a boil put lid on skillet and cooked in oven for 2.5 hours. About 30 minutes before done I sauteed cabbage in separate skillet with a couple of tablespoons of bacon grease (had grease on hand but no bacon) and red pep flakes. I served cabbage as a separate dish just because I love real mashed potatoes as is. I'm sure combining as directed would be great as well. Family loved it! I made extra stew and will freeze some for later since this does take a good bit of time to prepare. I will be making this again! Thanks for a great recipe!

Classic beef stew - BEST recipe I ve found. Love the flavors. And it solved a problem I ve always had with my stew... the potatoes always get mushy if cooked in the stew. Mashed potatoes are so much better! Recipe easily adapts for a crockpot just transfer the sauce at the end to a pot boil it down and add a cornstarch slurry to thicken it. Thanks Chef John!

My husband and I really enjoyed this stew! I did not make the colcannon. Instead I put the potatoes in the stew. I also added frozen peas when it was time to remove lid. I plan to make the colcannon next time.

I made it as specified and used a brown ale. We like gravy, so I added some broth before I put it in the oven. Great meal !!!
We added some peas to our bowls of beef & colcannon and it turned out to be a good addition.

Super delicious and very close to what's been made in my Irish family for generations. Well at least to my grandmother and the rest may just be a little (read: a lot) embellishment. Only change was personal tastes required double the garlic!

I cooked the stew on the stovetop in a steel stockpot (no suitable dutch oven) and modified the Colcannon to use 2 Tbsp of Red wine vinegar and braised the cabbage in that along with the water and crumbled bacon for ten minutes. These changes were personal thoughts and not intended as improvements but the result was fantastic. This recipe will find it's way into my rotation in general and if I end up opening the pub I dream of some variation of this recipe will be served to be sure!
