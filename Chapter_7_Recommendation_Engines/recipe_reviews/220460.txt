Stew is always a 'whatever I have' mosh pot in my kitchen.  With that said I am rating this with a few substitutes but really do not think it changes the outcome except for minor personal tastes. I used raw apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, regular beer, no parsnips and added peas at the end. Absolutely loved it, had a reminisce flavor of sauerkraut which goes hand-in-hand with corned beef.

Wonderful recipe! It was a huge hit. I added 6 garlic cloves, 1 TBS pickling spice & homemade beef broth.

I made this for our St. Patrick's Day Sunday dinner.  We had our Mexican friends over and they loved it!  Even my daughter, who didn't think she'd like it ate a bowl.  I didn't really make any changes to this at all, just made it as is.  I made a loaf of soda bread and had a bowl of fresh strawberries and grapes and dinner was a huge hit with young and old alike!  The 7-year old Mexican boy proclaimed we were all leprechauns now!

DID NOT care for the “off taste” the stout beer gave it.  It became more of a sour taste than the “pickled” taste of corned beef.

I thought this was delish. I saved it and will make it again.
