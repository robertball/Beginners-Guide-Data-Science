JUST LIKE a PB&J without the bread!  I really didn't think that I would like this & I really loved it.  I didn't have any wheat germ, so I used some oatmeal & blackberry preserves...YUM.  Thanks Cindy!

This was a good recipe, but next time I make it I'll add a little more pb and double the jelly (I could barely taste the jelly when I made it before)  I used oatmeal instead of the wheat germ and it turned out well.

I love this recipie.  In keeping with the berry jelly, I used frozen mixed berries instead of bananas (that and I had no bananas) and it was great.  If you're into lifting and hate those shakes this is a good alternative for you.

This was really good. You will either want to chill this smoothie before drinking, or make with a frozen banana. I did not put any wheat germ in mine, and it was great.

Excellent recipe.  Not only is this smoothie very healthy, it is absolutely delicious!  I used grape jelly instead of blackberry jelly and it was great.  One of the best smoothies I've ever made.  Everyone at home who tried it loved it.

This was horrific! I have tasted smoothies that were average, I have tasted smoothies that were delicious, and this one was neither. I drank about a half of a cup, and after that I had to dump it. What a waste! I used strawberries--strawberry jam, and frozen strawberries.

Wow - PB&J in a glass! I had to try it. I love anything with peanut butter but usually don't "drink" it. I'd much rather slather the stuff on bread or just about anything I can find. This was a nice departure and great for breakfast. I used skim milk, reduced fat peanut butter and strawberry jam - not bad.

Good recipie.  Didn't taste like a PB sandwich.  I didn't have any wheat germ, so I skipped it. I also used grape jelly.  It tasted like a peanut butter banana.  Maybe a different jelly would make a jelly flavor.  Next time I may double the grape jelly, so I can taste it. I will make again.

I used fat free milk, homemade strawberry-rhubarb jam, I used Trader Joe's organic peanut butter and upped it to 1/4 cup. The kids thought this was great. I don't think I'd use the honey next time. My frozen bananas are always a little sweeter, so the added honey isn't necessary.

Yummy! I used a tablespoon each of peanut butter and jelly, a tablespoon of rolled oats (instead of the wheat germ), and no honey, and it was plenty sweet! I also added two ice cubes to make it thicker. Next time I might use a little more jelly since that flavor disappeared a little. I plan on making this smoothie again!

I followed all the directions and used sugar free strawberry jam. The taste was good. I don't know if i would call it a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the bread,  but I could taste the two in the mix.  This was very filling and replaced my breakfast.

I didn't like it much. Husband drank some, and said it was ok, but he has gone off to work and forgotten to take the rest. That pretty much says it all. Thanks anyway.

Surprisingly, I really enjoyed this. I've never put jelly in a smoothie before, but all the flavors came together nicely. I didn't feel like digging around in my freezer for frozen bananas, so I used a fresh one and just added about a 1/2 cup of ice. I also omitted the honey as I don't like really sweet smoothies. It was still plenty sweet for my tastes. Very good, I will make again.

Again, 5 stars after personal modifications.....no wheat germ...anything with the word "germ" can't be tasty...also omitted the honey.  I find no need for it.  Milk, crushed ice, GRAPE jelly and peanut butter.  Yum!  Also tried with vanilla yogurt tossed in for fun and it was even better!

This smoothie was amazingly good.  Here's a tip for the frozen bananas, freeze them peeled and wrapped in foil.  Once frozen the bananas would be hard to peel if you don't do this.  I omitted honey and added 3 T of jelly and added two frozen bananas.  My kids loved it. It will be a great recipes to keep for use of ripping bananas.

This smoothie was really great! I made it vegan by using soymilk instead. I added a few fresh blackberries but that made it a little too watery so I had to freeze it for a bit but it was a delicious treat! I also didn't have wheat germ so I threw in some dry oat bran instead to thicken it up.

This was ok, but I thought the peanut butter was way too overpowering, next time I would use a lot less. I used homemade freezer jam and left out the honey and this was still really sweet.

Did not use Wheat Germ.  Used seedless strawberry jam.  REALLY tasted like a sandwich!  I halved the amount of milk and only used 1/2 a banana and did 1 and 1/2 table spoons of everything else.  Thank you WILL Make this again!

Yum with Splenda instead of honey and 1 Tbsp oatmeal instead of wheat germ!  I do add some vanilla protein powder to make it more of a meal too.

Very good!  Used oatmeal, no wheat germ and strawberry freezer jam.  Sooo go.  Not so sure about the 5 servings though, lol.  My two year old and I shared one blender full.  I was a bit thin,I did use fat free milk, maybe next time I'll use less milk.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't think this recipe was thick enough, so i added yogurt and ice. I also didn't have any wheat germ so I used milled flax seed. This recipe will become a new favorite. It's very kid friendly, I think I'll make it for my brother and sister too.

This was good; a little runny for me. I will add some frozen strawberries next time! My daughter LOVES it, though... thanks!

I left out the honey and it was still plenty sweet. I used skim milk and it needed a little extra, probably because I used extra wheat germ. My daugher loved it.

It was pretty good but I only could really taste the banana. Maybe next time I'll add more peanut butter. I omitted the wheat germ because I didn't have any.

Too watery. I like thicker smoothies. Next time I might try it with half the milk...

My husband said this tasted a lot better than it sounds. He seemed to really like. I made it mainly for him, but I don't like smoothies really.

When I had my wisdom teeth pulled (all 4 at once), I tried tons of smoothies. As soon as my boyfriend made me this one, it's the only one I wanted him to make me after that. Before, he would have to convince me to "eat something" and after tasting this smoothie, I was craving it and requesting to "eat". Awesome recipe, thanks for posting!

I tried this last night without the wheat germ, and used natural peanut butter and grape jelly...it was EXCELLENT!  Thank you!
