These were a hit at my Christmas party.  They are kind of like a meatless meatball...or as someone commented, like a little individual bite of stuffing without the turkey.  I wasn't sure how the margarine would mix in with the rest of the ingredients, so I used a pastry blender to cut it directly into the 2 cups of bread crumbs before adding that to the rest of the ingredients.  I also added just a little oregano for extra flavor.  After adding the milk, I let the mixture soak for about a 1/2 hour before forming into balls.  It would probably be OK to let this mixture sit in the refrigerator for hours before forming into the balls if it fits your schedule better.  Next time I make it, I might reduce the amount of margarine to 1/3 cup--I just didn't see the need for that much margarine.  Also, I had no problem with the final product sticking to the pan after baking as others commented.  Maybe they used "reduced fat" margarine (I did not).  Next time I think I might try adding crumbled cooked bacon in with the mixture.  That would add a little more flavor, although I thought the flavor was fine as it was.  Thanks for sharing!

OK, I played with this recipe! For one thing I thought they were bland, so after I had baked three, to sample, I added a healthy dash of Hot Sauce.  Sampled again and still thought they lacked something.  So I tried them with salsa. I liked that.  So I baked some more and flattened the balls in order to have more area for the Salsa! I may try this recipe again, but I will certainly play around with more spices and perhaps cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon. I did prefer the flattened product.  It is a fine basic recipe, and easily changed to accommodate personal taste.

These were great and toddler-approved.  They don't scream "You're eating broccoli" and they're portable (in fact, my oldest daughter wants them in her lunchbox).  Be sure your broccoli is drained well.  
I simplified the preparation by chopping everything together in my food processor, scooping balls of the "dough" with a cookie scoop, and placing on the baking sheet.  I did bake them longer than stated, for approximately 25 minutes.  I look forward to making these again and adding different ingredients to get a variety of flavors:  Spinach & feta, red pepper & goat cheese, and adding red pepper to the original recipe would be perfect for Christmas!  These would also be good with some added garlic.  Thanks for a fun, versatile recipe!

YES 5 stars!  Be sure though to grease the cookie sheet very well as my first batch stuck a little.  I also cut back on the onion just a tad and next time I'll use fresh onion as suggested by the other reviewer.  I think too that if one doesn't have any plain bread crumbs, seasoned stuffing could be used and cut back on the other spices?  Thank you and I just love this site.  Happy cooking and a blessed Christmas to all.

These are great!  I used fresh broccoli, and I am sure I had much more than the recipe called for, so they were filled with broccoli.  The breading mix just held them together.  These were a big hit last night.  However, I will have to say they are NOT good when they get cold - hot out of the oven ONLY.

Excellent!  I followed advice of others and seasoned them more as well as flattened them a little.  Great base recipe!  I used fresh broccoli, fresh parsley, fresh onion, plain bread crumbs and all sorts of seasonings.  Will certainly make these again!

"As is" these are a little plain.  I would definitely dip them in some sort of sauce, like a spicy honey mustard.  They could also use more seasoning.  I like the poultry seasoning flavor but think some garlic might kick it up a little.  I think next time too, I will turn them half way through cooking so they get brown on both sides.

It was good; it tasted like stuffing with broccoli, but who doesn't like stuffing?  It didn't look as appealing as it tasted, I must admit.  Very flavorful.

These are great! I used a 16oz bag of broccoli, and served them at a party. They are great hot, warm or room temp. Thanks!

I found this recipe very disappointing.  They are very bland and need something to spice them up.  They also look very bland and unappetizing.  Finally the recipe states they are good warm or cold.  I would not recommend serving them room temp/cold.  I will not make this recipe again.

My favorite broccoli recipe, I make them all the time. Only thing I change is I use stove top stuffing for the bread crumbs. Make my own homemade ranch dressing to dip them in. Fabulous!

I halved this recipe as there where only ten of us.  That was a mistake. None left and every one looking for more and they where a real conversation piece (usually everyone just eats and no need to ask what they are eating). Will make again for sure but will make the full amount next time. Thanks for sharing

I have tweeked the recipe just a bit - instead of the poultry seasoning & parsley, I use crushed herb stuffing.  Either way it's a great recipe & I always get requests for the recipe when I serve them at a get-together.

An amazing and nutritious way to eat broccoli. My husband dislikes broccoli but he hardly left anything for me. I substituted a little bit of semolina as I was short on bread crumbs and these turned out wonderful.

I made them for a small family gathering. my family always makes breaded broccoli for our gatherings so I thought I would try this. they were a big hit. I my self would rather have breaded broccoli, but these are healthier as they are baked not fried.

This recipe was lacking in much flavor, as I've seen other posters state. Also, I am absolutely anti-margarine! :) Here are the changes I made:
3/4 stick of real butter, softened, instead of margarine;
1 1/2 cups seriously sharp white Cabot cheese in place of parmesan;
1 packet Lipton Onion Mix in place of separate seasonings with the exception of the salt and pepper, still used that.
Instead of greasing the cookie sheet, I placed them on parchment paper;
Baked for 25-30 minutes until slightly browned and firm to touch.
Full of flavor as long as you like onion and broccoli together! If you want less onion flavor, use half a packet of Lipton mix, just make sure you shake it up so you get seasoning and dried onion and not just dried onion. :)

This was not at all what I expected these to taste like. Just kinda tasted like fluffy broccoli and I had to add salt in the end to be able to handle them. Won't be making these again.

Very disappointing recipe. I adore broccoli, but these were very, very "bready" so they left a funny taste in your mouth. Made them for company and noticed many guests took a bite out of them and put the rest in the garbage. This recipe could possibly have potential with tweaking, that's why I didn't rate it a 1 or 2.

These are absolutely delicious.  So easy to make and always a hit. Great to make ahead and keep in the freezer for unexpected company.  Delicious recipe, Patricia. :) You're on the way to the top 10 with this one!

These were an excellent change from regular broccoli recipes. I added red pepper, feta and spinach and garlic.  and they were very tasty. Even my picky husband loved them!

A little dry and not a ton of flavor but does great as a finger food for my one year old son. Easy to freeze and just pop in the microwave for a minute!

I had to give it a 1 star because it wouldn't let me give any lower. This was the worse tasting. I ruined all my broccoli by making this recipe.

It just tasted like stuffing- maybe we made the balls too big but we probably won't try it again.  Nothing special.

Other than converting to recipe to make 30 I followed it exactly. They were very dry and not much flavor. I will fool around with the basic recipe again though. Nothing like the ones from Friday's.
