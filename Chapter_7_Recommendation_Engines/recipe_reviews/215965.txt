Very good recipe! I usually use Ricotta cheese, but the cottage cheese actually added more flavor. I made them for my boyfriend and he loves them! The recipe makes a LOT so be prepared for leftovers!

my family loved this one.   However I made a few changes...I added Italian bread crumbs to the top with a topping of mozzarella and provolone and it was great.  Good recipe sally!!
