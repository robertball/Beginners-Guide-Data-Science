After reading the reviews, I was more generous with the peanut butter and the bananas.  (Plus, I used very overripe bananas for stronger flavor).  I also added a few good shakes of cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg.  Walnuts and mini chocolate chips are also great in these muffins.

These muffins had so many mixed reviews...I thought I should just stick with making them close to how the recipe said.  I did do as so many others suggested and upped the amount of both the pb and the banana to 3/4 cup.  I did think about adding more flour, but no reviews had mentioned that so went ahead and baked the first batch.  They turned out kind of flat and mushy, so added about 1/4 cup or less to the rest of the batter and the remaining muffins turned out great.  The daycare kids didn't care for the texture the oatmeal gives the muffin, so will probably leave that out and add more flour in the future...maybe ww flour?  These were even better the next day. Oh, almost forgot!  I lightly drizzled these with a thin chocolate glaze (powdered sugar, cocoa, and milk)instead of making the topping...really added to the muffin.

These muffins are definitly missing something, they look beautiful though. I think they need a little more sugar, they just don't taste sweet enough. The peanut butter and banana flavor is there, next time I would double or even triple the sugar. Otherwise, it's a very good muffin.

I usually only try 4-5 start recipes, but I saw that the bad ratings this recipe got was for being too heavy and chewy, and not enough sweet, but that was what I was looking for.
I made a few changes: instead of brown sugar I used regular sugar, a cup of oatmeal, only one banana (I was worried a little bit about this but because Iâ€™m not crazy over bananas I actually felt the taste!) two teaspoons of vanilla and one cup of peanut butter. It came out sweeter then I expected and overall it was pretty good!

These were so moist and delicious!  I really don't see where all the bad reviews are coming from.  I'm glad I didn't listen to them and decided to go ahead anyway.  I did what another reviewer said and doubled the amount of peanut butter and bananas.  Sooo good!  The peanut butter taste isn't well pronounced but it adds to the moistness of the muffin.  It was almost like cake!  Will definitely make this again!

I thought these muffins were very good - a unique flavour, and very easy to prepare.  I've made them more than once.

These are good muffins with a few changes. Since other reviewers said that there wasn't enough peanut butter and banana flavor, I used about 3/4 cup of each instead. They turned out great for me. But since I did make the changes that is the reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars. Thanks for the recipe~

I thought these were good. I used a bit extra peanut butter and used crunchy. Not too sweet, subtle banana flavour, but not bland as some suggest. Certainly not dry. that's an indication that you've left them in the oven too long! Oven times are only a guideline. I added a dried banana on top instead of the topping. (not fond of sugar toppings) I have no idea why so many gave this recipe 1 star....

These are really flavorless. You can't taste the banana at all, and only a vague hint of peanut butter.

OMG... Delish

So I did read the reviews before I attempted this recipe. 

I added the 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead of the oil & 3/4 cups of peanut butter (instead of 1/2 cup) & 1/2 tsp salt & 1/2 tsp Cinnamon & 2 tablespoons more of brown sugar.... 

After reading someone saying that it was still bland, i fixed it up with what every woman i know loves.... CHOCOLATE so i added 1/2 cup choc chips.I didnt make the topping for this i just sprinkled a small amt of brown sugar on top of each muffin for the first 1/2 batch and just tasted this delicious treat. YUM YUM!!!

The half batter left over I decided to add M&M mini's so they are still in the oven cooking up... and i am sure they will be just as amazing as the first batch.

P.S. about 20-25  mins for cooking time at 350 because its still a bit sticky in the middle with the toothpick test at 18 mins.

Enjoy & HEY.... THANKS FOR THE DELICIOUS TREAT my son and my hubby will love these i just know it.   :~}

Very moist, nice mild bananna and PB flavors. I was able to use a gluten free flour blend with great results (dense but not crumbly). I did add stevia to help with sweetness since 1/3 C isn't alot. I feel like these are a great snack or quick breakfast that isn't too junky. Thanks for the recipe!

Add SALT!  The other changes that people suggested were good: add a bit more sugar and flour, and I put 1 cup of banana, but the biggest issue is that there was no salt in this recipe.  I'm a huge muffin baker, and almost every recipe you will find will have from 1/2tsp to 1 tsp of salt in it.  I also added some spices, as suggested.  Great base recipe.

Love PB, Banana and Oatmeal!! I did change slightly based on some reviews. I added more PB (3/4 c total), 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, omitted the oil, used 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce and 1/3 c + 2 tbsp. brown sugar. I did not add the topping. These were great! I think I will add walnuts for more texture next time. Thanks!

I usually read the reviews before making recipes on here. This time I didn't. :( I felt the muffins were too moist in the middle and they sunk. They were too bland for me. Sorry I won't be making this again.

These were pretty good, but i can't say i'll make them again.  I really like peanut butter and banana, but i wasn't real fond of this muffin.  I added about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and i still felt like it was missing something.

These are very good, moist muffins. They are not heavy unless you over mix them. I made them with splenda, but used brown sugar in the crumb topping. I mixed white chocolate chips in half the batch (great!) The whole family enjoyed them.

I did add some salt as previous reviewers had said, but it didn't add enough.  I'll try these again, but with more sugar.

I loved it! Even my 17yo son who hates bananas loved it!
   I did make a few changes. First, I had 2 large bananas hanging around, so I used both. Second, I added a handful of oatmeal to the topping, to give it more body. And my son had a fancy chocolate-orange bar, so I chopped it up and threw it in, Yummy!

I read most of the other reviews and bsse the four stars on the changes I made. I, like many people increased the peanut butter (crunchy) and banana to 3/4 cup and the brown sugar to 2/3 cup. I always substitute applesauce for oil in muffin recipes also. Added 1/4 tsp cinammon and added about 3/4 cup of toasted walnuts to the strusel topping as well. Finally, increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp. Quite a few changes, but came out with a restaurant quality muffin.

This is a good recipe to base a great recipe off of. I swapped the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour. Added fiber & ground flax for a "healthy" muffin. I also added 1/4 cup more banana and peanut butter to make the flavor & nutrition pop. Make sure to use old banana's (the blacker ones) thats where all the sweetnes is.

These Muffins were super easy to make. my boyfriend and dad are huge fans of banana bread, and peanut butter so I thought I would give it a shot. The general consensus was they needed more peanut butter. I put nutmeg and cinnamon in them as another reviewer suggested but next time I will leave out the cinnamon.

These are awesome!  I followed suggestions of others and doubled the amount of banana and peanut butter, added additional flour. I also added some salt (not called for in the recipe), about a teaspoon. This gave them more flavor.  I also did NOT put the topping on them...just sprinkled a little white sugar on them for sparkle. These muffins are not sweet...and that's perfect!

I thought these were great.  I skipped the topping.  I found that there was a very nice balance of flavors and wouldn't change either proportion.  I like that there is very little added sugar and fat besides the PB.  I will make these again for sure!

My DH hates muffins with a passion, so what i did with this fantastic recipe is this:  add 1 cup extra flour, 1 cup of chocolate chips and turned these into cookies, soft chewie cookies!  drop by tablespoon full and bake for 10 minutes!  absolute perfection!  and full of protein!

These are very good! They are rich, but not overwhelming. When I made the topping, I thought it was too wet, so I added a little more flour- but it came out fine. My family enjoyed them :)

As suggested by others, I increased the amount of banana and peanut butter (2 bananas and 1 cup pb).  Also, I used 1/2 cup of all purpose flour and 1/2 a cup of whole wheat flour and white sugar instead of brown b/c that is what I had.  The peanut butter and banana flavor was definitely there but these muffins still need something- perhaps a 1/2 tsp. of salt???  I also omitted the topping just to cut calories.  I will definitely try these again with the salt.

These are great!  I did add more peanut butter (personal preference ~ I love peanut butter!) and decreased the milk by the same amount.  My picky 15 month old has eaten 4 of them since yesterday!

made exactly to recipe and found these muffins to have a nice flavor but they were very dry.  Made up for the dryness eating them with butter, and coffee.

I think these need more peanut butter and banana!  They were very tasteless...all I could taste was the oatmeal.  However, they were very moist.  Probably won't make these again unless I make revisions.

I have to go with a lot of other reviewers and say these muffins were on the bland side.  They were, however, very moist and I could taste the peanut butter and bananas. The topping was too moist & sticky to be "sprinkled" over the top, but I managed.  With a little more flavor these muffins would be great!

I liked the basic recipe.  Very healthy.  Not sure what people were expecting.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the topping, and I made them in a pan instead of muffin cups.  Topped with my peanut butter frosting, amazingly moist snack cake loaded with oatmeal, ripe bananas, and peanut butter.  Great way to use up those bananas, will make again.

These muffins were ok right out of the oven, but once they sat overnight they became mushy. My fiance who will eat just about anything wouldn't even tough these!

You'd be surprised what 1/2 tsp of salt will do for this recipe.  Mix it with the other dry ingredients and you're good to go.  Major oversight when writing this recipe.

these were ok - unique taste, but a little too much on the bland side...  also, the second day they got really mushy.  I probably won't make again, since no one really cared for them too much...  unlike the chocolate chip banana muffins I made the same day :)

I enjoyed these; however, I found that if you add an extra bit of brown sugar and a bit more banana they come out quite nice.... (also added some walnuts one time -they were great as well)

These turned out pretty good.  I added 3/4 cup creamy peanut butter instead of the 1/2 cup, and mashed 3 bananas.  They are pretty tasty, and a good way to get some healthy type foods into my picky kids!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I was hesitant to try this because of the few bad reviews, but I'm so glad I did, as I now have a new addition to my breakfast lineup!  

I used all whole wheat flour & natural peanut butter.  These came out FANTASTIC.  Even though I did not add the topping, they were very tasty and plenty sweet without it!

This is yummy, yummy, yummy...  I could go on forever!  Omitted the topping, just my preference.  Baked in my stoneware muffin pan, came out awesome!  Stupid site wouldn't allow me to post a photo, 960 pixels x 960 pixels kiss my lower muffins!  :D

I made this with coconut flower rather than all purpose, as well as added 1/2 cup+ of bran (on own, not as replacement). I also substituted Splenda for the brown sugar, egg whites for the egg, 35% cream in place of milk, coconut oil in place of olive oil and used natural peanut butter.
For those who are gluten + lactose intolerant....these turned our Great! The batter was thick, but the muffins were moist inside and crunchy on outside when finished. I also used the leftover mix to make cookies with; taste & texture are great!

I do suggest upping the banana content and possibly peanut butter too.

I did not do the topping. 

basically made my own recipe with this ones outline!

I followed the recipe exactly even though I read the reviews, but wanted to see for myself.  I enjoyed them!!  I agree that it needs salt and cinnamon.  I also think I might try crushed banana chips and raisins next time, and there will be a next time.  Thank for sharing!!

Mine did not rise like they should have. I made them exactly as the recipe stated. I thought there was just enough PB flavor and absolutely not enough Banana flavor. I'm sure my husband will love it the way it is. The tops did not brown as fast as the bottoms. I would absolutely add more banana and something to help it rise a little more

Great recipe!  I increased the banana to 3/4 C. like others recommended, but didn't have enough pb on hand to increase to 3/4 C (will do this next time). I did use 1/4 C. extra each flour and oats bc the batter seemed thin.  I used agave syrup in place of brown sugar and did not do the topping.  The muffins were not very sweet, but that is what I was looking for.  I would definitely make this again!  Great breakfast or snack for toddlers and kids!

I made these last night, and thought they were actually pretty good. I read previous reviews and knew they would not be very sweet which is usually a good thing for me, but I would probably still add a little more sugar, double the banana and add a little cinnamon next time. They ARE really pretty!

great recipe!  I used 3/4 cup peanutbutter and kept to the recipe withe the banana.  I also cut the oil to about 1/2 tbsp because peanutbutter already has oil in it.  I did not mash the banana all the way so that there would be some chunks in the muffins.  Hint: 1 large banana= 1/2 cup mashed banana (with chunks left).  I don't think I needed to up the banana, it was fine, but the peanutbutter definitely needed to be increased.  Could use some cinnamon and nutmeg though.

I added a whole large mashed banana. I made no other changes. I think if I hadn't added the whole banana, the batter would have been too dry. My kids and husband ate these but didn't seem to be overly excited about them. This was a good way to use up peanut butter, oatmeal and banana....I just think it needs a little something.

The consistency was fine- moist and appealing.  I also doubled bananas and peanut butter.  But if you are using natural PB as I did, you will likely end up with banana flavored doggie bisquits.  Go with the Jiff for this one folks!

These are fabulous. I don't understand "tasteless" comments. I tripled the recipe because I had so many overripe bananas. I put in about 2 cups of mashed banana. I also quadrupled the topping because I like lots of streusel. To the topping I added about 1/2 cup of oatmeal and some cinnamon to the other ingredients. This alternation made 2 loaf pans and a dozen muffins. Excellent recipe!! Thanks!

I usually count more of the 5 star reviews and go from there.  I love quaker oats so I added 1 cup  instead of the 3/4 cup.  I did not add anymore peanut butter but added another 1/2 cup of overripe bananas(they're more flavorful).  I also changed the vegetable oil to 1 tablespoon instead of the 2 tablespoon.  I will still give this recipe 5 STARS!!!

I was looking for a higher protein muffin for my kinds in the morning.  My kids loved that it tasted like peanut butter and bananas!

GREAT RECIPIE!! I doubled it and made a bunch. They were great and my two boys, 2 and 3 loved them. I was hesitant to make them based on the bad reviews, but glad I did anyways. This will defiantly be a keeper of a recipe.

I thought these were a little bland and dry. I had added more very ripe bananas but this did not offset it. I won't make these again.

I thought these muffins were good.  For lack of brown sugar, I used 1/3 cup of honey instead, four very ripe bananas and nearly a cup of peanut butter.  Because we eat creamy p.b., I added about 3/4 cup of crushed peanuts.  Then I put a thin layer of left over chocolate cream cheese frosting on top.  Yum!  Very moist, too.

So so bland. I even read comments of adding cinnamon and nutmeg, still did nothing. I used an extra banana AND they were extra ripe too, it did nothing. I added chocolate frosting to try and salvage 2 batches. I wasted so many ingredients. I would not attempt this again. There is no flavor. I also used sunbutter instead of peanut butter.

I used 3 bananas. I didn't have baking powder so used 1 tsp. baking soda and 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup milk. I used coconut oil. Made 6 large muffins. Baked at 375 for 20 min.  Texture was good. They were ok but I would not make again. They had a strange taste which could have been from the sour cream or maybe my PB was too old. Not bad, but not a favorite.

I followed the recipe but added chopped pecans (I hate chocolate in muffins).  I used Adams natural peanutbutter which has much less sugar.  The muffins were good, but not quite sweet enough.  If I make them again I will add more sugar if using the natural peanutbutter.  I suspect had I used a more mainstream brand of peanut butter, like skippys, they would have been just fine.

I think this is the first time on All Recipes I've made the recipe without reading any reviews first. It sounded good, had some nutritious ingredients and most importantly, called for items I have on hand (I broke my ankle and cannot drive!). The only adjustments I made were olive oil and less of it than called for and I doubled the recipe. My version contained three bananas. The taste is very good but mine are on the gummy side. I also ended up with two dozen muffins and two mini-loaves since I want to give them away to friends and co-workers. Overall, I like the results but wish I'd used a bit more flour. Oops, almost forgot, I don't have quick oats so used old-fashioned.  I will make them again and experiment with the ingredients a bit more.

The only change I made was using the jumbo muffin pans, so I had to increase baking time by about 10 minutes.  These muffins are deliciously moist and flavorful.  I love the struesel topping.

I tried this (wanted a breakfast muffin for my kids) with a lot of the comment in mind. Here's what I did:
Upped flour to 1-1/2Cups. Upped brown sugar to 1/2Cup. Upped PB to 3/4Cup (1/2 creamy/ 1/2 chunky). Upped banana (put in 2 med/lg bananas). Added salt. I did not make the topping. This made 18 muffins (one ice cream scoop batter per muffin).

They were still pretty lackluster. Not BAD, just not YUMMM! 

Next time (and there will be a next time) I would:
Up sugar to 3/4 Cup. Up PB to 1 Cup. Sprinkle with sugar & cinnamon  or an oat struesel. I might also add craisins (kiss don't like raisins) and/or cinnamon to the batter.

I thought this recipe was a little different than the usual muffin recipes I make, so I wanted to give it a try. Peanut butter and bananas are two of my favorite ingredients. I tried one about 5 minutes out of the oven, and it was super fluffy but not very sweet or big on banana flavor. Next time I make these, I will use white sugar and an extra banana.

My family loved these. I skipped the struesel  topping and just sprinkled some course raw sugar on top for a little sweet crunch. I may have  added some extra pb as I did not really measure (not quite doubled) and threw in a handful of mini chocolate chips. Used two VERY overripe bananas. The muffins were plenty sweet and moist and heavy and hearty on a cold winter morning.  I am about to make them again per my family's  request.

Definitely add extra peanut butter, banana, and some sweet aspect. I'll probably try honey next time I make them, this time I tried dark chocolate. They're suuuuuper heavy and really filling though, so you only need one!

We did not like it at all. The muffins came out so bland that the only flavor left was the peanut butter.  They were unsalvageable. I tried adding chocolate spread to the muffins but son still hated them.

This recipe came out perfect for me. The only changes I made were an addition of 1/2 tsp salt, I substituted soymilk for milk, and I didn't do the crumb topping. The muffins came out moist, chewy and delicious. Added benefit: I have Type 1 Diabetes and  these muffins didn't cause a sudden spike in my blood-sugar level ...now if only I could limit myself to eating just one ;)

They have an good texture and flavour overall.  I added 1 cup of banana and an extra 2/3 cup of flour.  Next time I would maybe add in some chocolate chips to bring out the peanut butter in a different way.  They are lacking something I feel.  When you bite into it, you have to almost search for the flavour as the texture is the first thing you notice, not flavour.

I substituted half the flour with whole wheat flour, which worked well.  I also didn't have quick oats so put slow cooking oats in my food processor, which worked very well and elminated the texture issue for my kids.  Pureeing the banana instead of mashing the also worked well for texsture.  Great flavor.  A little more butter would be even better!

Great taste. Great texure! I read reviews first. In case your not sure this is Not a cup cake it is a muffin. It didn't need more sugar. The only thing I changed was, I added more oats, and put a couple chocolate chips on top. It's a heavier muffin like they made in the olden days. Not anything like processed. So if you like fluffy cake like texture this is not for you. If you like old fashioned from scratch recipes this is for you.

I made some adjustments based on other reviews. I used one large banana, about a cup of crunchy peanut butter and more like 1/2 cup oats so it wasn't as oaty. I just used flour for the extra oats. Then I added no oil, just some apple sauce instead. Maybe a touch more sugar because I read that they weren't very sweet and a little cinnamon. I also didn't make the topping. I just added slivered almonds on top. They are very good!

Baked longer than indicated on the recipe, and definitely needs 2 or 3 times more sugar. Otherwise, they're ok.  Mini chocolate chips would make them better!

My ten year old wanted muffins and made them herself.  She followed the recipe and they turned out lovely. Not too strong in flavour but a nice blend of peanut butter and banana.  Definitely going to do this one again.

I increased peanut butter  & banana to 2/3 cup & used old fashioned oats instead of quick oats. For topping I used 1/4c. Brown sugar & 2 tsp cinnamon mixed together & sprinkled on top before baking.

After baking these muffins, I realized there is no SALT in the recipe, so they turned out kind of bland. If I were to make them again, I would add a pinch of salt with the dry ingredients and maybe a dash of cinnamon in the crumble topping.

I love that you can read the reviews and decide if you should tweak the recipe or not! I do not like things overly sweet, especially my breakfast food, so I was not worried about the review that said these were not sweet enough. The level,of sweetness was perfect. I did increase the mashed banana to one cup and the peanut butter to three quarters of a cup.  I did not have quick oats, but my regular oats were fine.  The topping looked way too plain, so I added about a half cup of chopped walnuts, which made a delicious crunchy topping that reminded me of the sweet nuts you get at festivals.  I buy chopped walnuts, but find them way too big, so I chop them down a little bit more, so they get incorporated better into whatever I am adding them to. These were the best muffins and this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is my first time rating a recipe, but I just have to say my kids LOVE these muffins, and they're pretty healthy so I enjoy making them.  I would've given them 5 stars, but I had to change the recipe a little bit.  I just leave off the topping and add 1 C chocolate chips instead, and then I use 2 ripe bananas and 2/3 C peanut butter.  The choc. chips add to the sweetness and flavor and make them very tasty.

Loved it! Subtle flavour and not too sweet. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable  oil and it adds another dimension of flavour. A pinch of Nutmeg really helps too!

These muffins are just okay. I should have added a half tsp of salt and more banana. I used natural peanut butter which might be why the peanut butter drowned out the banana.

I love peanut butter and banana sandwiches..why have I never thought to make peanut butter banana muffins before??? Wow, these were so good! I was nervous if these would come out good based on other's reviews, but I'm so glad I tried it! I think the ripeness of the banana/type of peanut butter is why it got all these mixed reviews. The bananas should be really ripe, the skin should be almost black. Yellow or green bananas don't have much taste to them on their own, so you definitely won't taste them baked with other ingredients. I switched to using natural peanut butter(the kind you have to stir), a few years ago, and there's such a taste difference from the other stuff(Jif, skippy, etc). The natural stuff, I have a jar of Smucker's right now, actually tastes like peanuts! lol It makes a HUGE difference, taste wise in baked goods.  I would suggest investing in a PB mixer though if you switch, about $10. Anyways, sorry for the ramble! I made this recipe as written, only thing I added was pumpkin pie spice, which I always add to banana bread and I used oats in place of flour in the topping. Thanks so much for the recipe, definitely 5 star worthy! :)

I read the reviews and then added additional peanut butter but it is still a very bland muffin.  I would not recommend making this recipe. Stick with a standard banana bread recipe and just proportion them into muffin cups.

These are pretty great.  I made a lot of changes, but like the end product.  I used gluten free flour and coconut milk, used 3/4 sunflower butter, and flax to replace the eggs to make these muffin allergy free.  I also doubled the bananas, added a touch a salt, and skipped the oil but used apple sauce instead.  I also upped the brown sugar by a couple of tablespoons and added mini chocolate chips.  My (allergic) family is enjoying these and I'm super glad I doubled the batch!

I didn't have oats so used all flour and added a half tsp of salt. I used two large bananas I had that were about to go bad...the muffins definitely tasted like banana. Also substituted Nutella for peanut butter, which is much sweeter. The sweetness came out just right, not too sweet. Skipped the topping to save calories. They came out light and moist...more like banana chocolate cake than a muffin. They were pretty good.

I agree with all of the above comments.  I almost added two bananas, probably would've had more flavor, they were moist.  In place of veg oil I use coconut oil!

Great recipe to start from. I changed it up a bit and used two packets of instant maple nut oatmeal instead of just oats- this gave the muffins quite a bit of flavor. I also used a bit more peanut butter than was called for. And I added cinnamon to the crumble on top. I followed all other ingredients according to the recipe. They came out delicious! And took no time at all to make. I will definitely make these again with my own adjustments.

Not having time to read reviews, I made this just as the recipe stated (except substituting 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat, but I always do that).  These are really great muffins - tender texture with a little added chewiness from the oats.  The banana flavor offsets the peanut butter.  Any muffin with a crumb topping is coffee worthy to me.

These turned out really good. I came across this recipe when I had already started making a similiar one for cookies. I decided to switch to this. I used this recipe as a base, and then changed things up a little to use what I had on hand. I left out the egg, and used apple sauce, also, I only had one banana, so added a jar of banana cream pie baby food dessert(I know sounds strange), for added flavor and texture. I had no butter or margarine, so left out the topping all together....added a bit more sugar and peanut butter, and used maple syrup (in place of the vanilla), as I already had it in the bowel from the previous recipe I had started. I baked them just a little longer. They turned out a bit flat, but just the right crispness on the outside, and moist but just the right amount of chewy inside. I topped with a bit of jam and served warm....My daughter loves them!...overall, I think this recipe makes a great starting point, and leaves a lot of room fro adjustment for ingredients and personaly taste...Thanks! :)

I really liked these muffins. They are a little squishy feeling when fresh out of the oven but a few hours later the texture was perfect! I added extra oatmeal (on accident) and more bananas and I really liked them. My friends enjoyed them also and my 17 month old charge loved them also (he's the toughest critic)!

it is an excellent base or start point.  I didnt read the reviews until after I baked it. It does seem to lack an ingredient. I am no a seasoned enough baker to know what it exactly calls for. I am guessing maybe cream cheese in the batter. I wanted a smoother texture and a richerness to it.  I would make this again - add chocolate chips and nuts as well as some cream cheese.

I had to review this one as I read many negative reviews.  The peanut butter and banana flavour wasn't strong but they were still delicious!  I added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, decreased the baking powder to 2 tsp and omitted the topping.  I didn't measure the bananas but used 2 medium sized ones.  I would make this recipe again for sure.

I thought this recipe was great!  The only change I made was using half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose.  My family limits sugary foods so when I make baked goods sometimes they end up too sweet for us, but these muffins came out tasting just right.

These turned out really good, although 20-22 minutes is probably a better cooking time. As others did, I upped the peanut butter to 1 cup. They were very moist. They may not be the sweetest muffins, but that did not bother me or my husband. These were the perfect breakfast after our Saturday morning run.

Next time I make these I will make the topping first so that the butter can harded back up and actually crumble...not clump.  And will add more peanut butter and banana...thought they could use more flavor.  I always alter recipes a bit anyway.  But overall it is a good recipe...Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I used 3/4 cup of mashed banana and peanut butter (I used Skippy's Reduced Fat) and added a little more flour. They were so good! Oh, and I think my addition of chocolate chips (instead of the sweet topping) helped.

I added more peanut butter and more banana as other reviewers had suggested and while I could taste each element and the muffins turned out very moist, they were just BLAH.  I do not think that a muffin texture is strong enough to handle peanut butter AND banana (and I even added in a 1/2 cup oats for some texture!)  This needs to be modified into a cookie and then maybe it would be worth eating.  I gave it two stars because it was a great tender & moist muffin and the protein kept us going in the mornings.  The flavor just wasn't there.  I will not be making this recipe again.

I really liked the basic recipe.  I did add a pinch of salt, plus 1/2 c. milk chocolate chips; and I also substituted crunchy peanut butter.  Rather than the streusel topping, I just used sanding sugar.  Next time I will try making them with whole wheat flour and topping them with chopped, salted peanuts.

Yummy!  Despite the negative reviews, I followed the orignal recipe.  They are delicious. I did use a very ripe banana, they were sweet.  For those who want to change it up, you could add peanut butter chips or chopped peanuts, or both. You could also use granola cereal for the streusel topping.  I am calorie/fat conscious so I prefer the orginal recipe.

Used almost a cup each of the peanut butter and really ripe bananas and some extra brown sugar.  I used half all-purpose flour and half white whole wheat flour and added dark chocolate chips.  Pretty good but the flavor is very subtle.  Made 40 mini muffins.  Would probably make these again for a change of pace or when I want some extra protein in my breakfast but I like my modified "banana banana bread" recipe better.  (The flavor shows up the next day.  My husband loved these.  They peanut butter intensified over time until it overpowered my desire to eat them but he chowed them down by himself.  I thought they peaked within a day or so.)

It was fairly good, not bad, but not great.  There was something missing and I can't put my finger upon it.  I followed the recipe and the batter was a bit soupy.  So I added 1/4 cup more flour and 1/4 cup more oats.  They were nice and fluffy and not hard, dense, or gooey.  I'll keep this recipe and tweak it until I have perfected it for our family.

My 2 yr old and 4 yr old LOVE these muffins! I had to hid the container of them. otherwise they would have eaten all of them the first day! I did follow the advice of other reviewers and increased the amount of PB and bananas to about 1 cup.

These are okay tasting, but to me they are a little too bland.  It just seems like they're missing a little something.  I added about 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and a pinch each of nutmeg and salt, but that didn't make much of a difference.  They seem to lack substance to me; I may try increasing the peanut butter next time.

I took these to work and got great compliments. I added salt, extra peanut butter (crunchy) and bananas and reduced the milk slightly. My son sprinkled dark chocolate chips and some of them,,,that was a nice addition.

Moist, delicious, my fiance loved these! Changed I made: double peanut butter, added cinnamon, a little nutmeg, and chocolate chips. Took longer to cook, around 21-22 minutes (I think b/c of the p.b.).

I thought these muffins turned out very well, especially considering that I forgot to add the oats!  I like the combo of peanut butter and bananas, and think the flavor came through just fine. I will keep this recipe in mind next time I have some over ripe bananas again.

Glad I didn't read any reviews before making this for the first time or I probably would've kept searching.  The only variation I made was a tsp of honey.  I got 16 muffins instead of 12, had just enough topping to cover all & it smelled wonderful baking.  
Came out light & fluffy, subtle in the banana & peanut butter area but I wasn't expecting it to be overwhelming.  
Obviously, we all have different expectations in a muffin.  Some want a stand homebaked treat while others are expecting those big, dense monster muffins you find in professional bakeries that cost $3 each.  
The only thing I would change is the name.  We'll be calling these Elvis Muffins since they use PB & bananas!

These are absolutely the *moist* delicious! My kids loved them and they are picky. I followed the recipe exactly. My banana was not even quite over ripe (I microwaved it for 30 seconds to help me mash it), and maybe added a tad more vanilla than it calls for. I had three! For an afternoon school snack, I will add chocolate chips.

I actually had this in the oven before I saw the low rating on this..hoped for good results but was disappointed.  I had the ingredients on hand, that's why I went this recipe but I won't make them again - there was very little flavor, and they almost stuck to the roof of my mouth with dryness.  Even warming them in the microwave and buttering them didn't help much.  Sorry...

I would have rated a 4 star but, I have had muffins that were healthier (than 42% fat) and tasted similar & even better. My family liked the crispy topping and they were nice & moist... just not a wow flavor. Will keep looking for a "wow! is that good!" muffin recipe.

yuck. I doubled the sugar, peanut butter and banana and still found them rather bland.  They were also very dense and just not at all appealing.  I will definitely not make these again.

This recipe took longer than 10 minutes prep time.  I made them exactly as the recipe specified.  It took one banana to make 1/2 cup of mashed banana, not enough banana flavor in my opinion.  Also, the streusel topping seemed too moist and was hard to "sprinkle".  I don't think I'd make again.

These muffins were great!  They were very moist and flavorful.  I didn't make the streusel topping but even without that I thought they were great.  Next time I'll probably add a little more peanut butter but overall they're really good and easy to make.  I hardly ever bake and I found this recipe to be a snap.

these muffins were not what i expected...they were heavy, sticky, and the crumb topping was not crumbly at all...i will not be making these again.
