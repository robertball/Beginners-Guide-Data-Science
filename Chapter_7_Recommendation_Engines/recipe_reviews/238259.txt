Yummy!  Added toasted black sesame seeds and then served on top of wonton triangles sprayed with olive oil spray, sprinkled with white sesame seeds, toasted about 5 minutes in the oven.  Put a sprig of cilantro on each slice and serve!  Rave reviews from guests.

We had high hopes for this but found it a waste of a good sushi-grade Ahi Tuna steak. We love Poison Cru and our recipe for that. It's just like being back in Tahiti. That dish also uses fresh Ahi, lime juice, and coconut milk, but it highlights the fresh tuna rather than masks it with over-potent flavors blended together. We had to try this, but we won't make it again.
