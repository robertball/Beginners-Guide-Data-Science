A huge disappointment.  The chicken itself was OK but the breading stuck to the bottom of the pan when I turned IIt and what remained was not very flavorful.  If you're looking for the perfect fried chicken, this is not it.  My quest continues.

The chicken itself was very juicy.  Unfortunately the crust fell off after it was out of the oven, and didn't have much of a flavor and the crust was a bit bland

I had 12 boneless/skinless chicken thighs so I altered the amounts to reflect this. I scaled to 2 servings to use 1 cup buttermilk in a ziploc bag and added all the seasonings except for the seasoning salt I used Mrs Dash garlic &  herb. I let the chicken soak all day it the milk mixture in the fridge. For the flour,  I used 1 cup in a ziploc bag and added the seasonings again as above. I skipped the egg step, I just shook the chicken pieces in the flour ziploc bag until totally covered. I fried the chicken thighs 2 minutes each side then kept them in a 350 degree oven while I was getting the rest of dinner prepared. I served with mashed potatoes, corn and sawmill gravy, my family really enjoyed this, the chicken was super tender and flavourful.
