This is a great sauce. I found it to be missing a bit of richness, so I added one cup of chicken stock and let it reduce down, I also added some fresh basil right before serving. I served the sauce over spaghetti with homemade meatballs. The result was fantastic!

So I really enjoyed how basic this recipe was.  I was in desperate need of utilizing too many left over Costco tomatoes and this was right up my alley.  I didn't have tomato paste, but seeing a review wishing to omit anyway - I did.  While I was sauteing the onions I felt like it was missing the "smell."  So I added 3 cloves of grated garlic and dried basil.  It turned out fantastic!  I can still smell my sauce now - Yummy.  Thanks for the recipe.

SOOO easy, but I wasn't crazy about the tomato paste.  Since I was using garden fresh tomatoes, I wish I'd skipped the 'canned' paste because I think it took away from the flavor of the fresh tomatoes.  Can't beat it for ease and it was good- just not quite what I was looking for tonight.  Thanks for the submission!

This was a really good starter recipe. I gave it 4 stars because it needed more taste. I added fresh minced garlic, and mushrooms to the red onion in olive oil. I also added basil. The tomato paste tasted like a tin can but it did thicken it up. I ended up creating my own dish by cooking chicken in a separate pan and then allowing it to cook with the sauce. 
I added a little bit of sugar and parsley while simmering it. It needs a little more flavor. Buttering your spagetti noodles did the trick for me.
Thanks for the starter recipe! It got me cooking this tasty dish.

This was just what I was looking for.  Very good sauce, and easy to adapt to a variety of uses.  I thought it was just a bit too oily - would reduce oil by at least 1 tablespoon next time.

This was a super fast and easy recipe! My family really liked it but I did alter it a bit.  I followed some suggestions of other reviewers and reduced the olive olive.  I also added some green onions to the white onions to be sauted.  When the sauce was simmering, I added some dried garlic, dried basil and grated romano cheese.  It was GREAT!

i find it very hard to get my kid's to eat jars of sauce. But they all really enjoyed this quick and easy sauce and the best thing about it is you can also add whatever herbs and spices you like just to add to the flavour. Great alround sauce thanks Lima

I actually think this is five stars, but only after a few additions. I sauteed some minced garlic with the onion, ditched the tomato puree, and added some basil, oregano, savory and thyme. Tossed it with rotini, feta, peas, a bit more olive oil and vinegar, and tomato-onion tuna. Mmmm!!

This is a great recipe that is easy in a pinch. I added fresh garlic with the onions and then put in some fresh basil with the tomatos. My 2 year old son and husband loved it!

Someone gave me fresh tomatoes and I needed a way to prepare them (I won't eat them plain), and this recipe was great! As other reviewers stated it's a good base that can be dressed up any number of ways. I personally added minced garlic, basil, oregano, peppers, a little sugar and salt, and 1 cup of chicken broth, then let it simmer and reduce and thicken for a few hours. It was great with spaghetti and meatballs!!

This was super easy and yummy.  I love to make things from scratch but didn't have lot of time on this day. I was looking for a pizza sauce recipe and used this as a guide - draining off the extra liquid after letting this simmer for a while.  I added sliced mushrooms, a touch of red wine and omitted the tomato puree.  This is a good base for  making red sauce.

Very good "base" for a sauce but I did have to add a few things. I added a can of chicken broth, a pinch of thyme and oregano, plus about 2-3 table spoons of sugar, and half a hand full of flour to thicken up the sauce, over all it turned out very good.

Fantastic! I followed a bit of advice from other reviews. I reduced the amt of olive oil to 2 tbsp and added 1 cup of chicken broth and reduced. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic, garlic powder, dried oregano, dried thyme, and dried basil. The sauce was fantastic as a vegetarian tomato sauce. I used the leftover sauce as part of the marinade in the "marinated grilled shrimp" recipe found on allrecipes.com.

It's good.  A little watery, but I did use extra tomatoes.  I also added some green pepper and garlic with the onion and some basil with the tomatoes.  I simmered it for a couple hours, too.  It was easily eaten and I'm looking forward to the left overs tomorrow.

Yay!  This was just what I was looking for - a simple, pure recipe.  We are eating on a Daniel Fast and can only have pure veggies, no additives or sugar.  So I used a can of Firey Diced tomatoes, skipped the puree, added some minced garlic, then blended the cooked ingredients to make a smoother sauce.  Smells wonderful cooking and is tasty!  Thanks!

The first time I made this I used garden fresh tomatoes and omitted the puree, and I didnt really care for it, too plain.

The Second time I used garden fresh tomatoes and used the tomato puree that has garlic and basil, I also added fresh garlic and basil. I used less chopped onion and used onion powder (I dont care for onions texture) and it was wonderful! this will definitely replace bottled pasta sauce for a quick meal.

So delicious and so easy! Great way to use up all of the extra ripe tomatoes from the garden. After reading the previous reviews, I also added some chicken stock, garlic, and basil. It was fantastic!

Very good basic recipe that you can spice to your liking.  Some reviewers have said they did not like the "tomato paste."  The recipe calls for tomato puree which is not paste and is far less sweet.

This is a great base, but I added to it to suit my own tastes because on its own it's kind of bland. I added garlic to the onion, and added a pinch of red pepper flakes, dried coriander, dried basil, and dried thyme. I also added about half a cup of frozen spinach, as it needed to be used and it's also how I sneak veggies into our diet. Once it was all cooked I let it cool a bit and threw it in the blender. The only downside to adding the spinach is the color is a bit off and looks a tad unappetizing, but was still tasty nonetheless! I'll keep playing with it! :)

Great basic recipe! Like many other posters on here, I altered the recipe a bit. I added some fresh garlic with the onions, left out the tomato puree, and added some dried basil. Yummy. Next time I will try using a bit chicken or vegetable stock as some other reviewers have, I didn't have any on hand this time.

I was craving spaghetti.  Really enjoyed this  easy recipe. Like others I added garlic with the onions and sauce but omitted the paste because I didn't have any. I added several spices lrosemary, Italian seasoning, and two spoonfuls of mild sugar free salsa. (Next time I will get seedless tomatoes!) 

Since I am sugar and carb free right now I added my sauce  to my grass feed beef.  I sauté my beef with a broccoli coleslaw mix, to make soft veggies like noodles!  Thank you for the basic recipe,  I used it last minute, but plan to try the sauce with other tomatoes.

Very good.  Not thick, and need to add spices to taste but a good base for easy sauce!

I was in the process of making some personal pizzas when I realized we had no more pasta sauce! I scrapped this recipe together, and it was very good! I altered it slightly. I used half a chopped onion, and sautéed it in 1.5 Tbs of olive oil until it was more than translucent, almost caramelized. I then added 3, chopped roma tomatoes. I had no tomato puree, so I went ahead and sautéed the fresh tomatoes until it was fairly broken down. I added Italian seasoning, basil, thyme, bay leaf bits, pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, and a generous amount of garlic powder. After all that, I did find it was missing something. I took a cue from MRSMLINE and instead of adding chicken stock and waiting for it to reduce, I added a tsp or half a tablespoon of Better than Bouillon (chicken). It turned out very tasty for the pizza, but it was especially good the following day. I could see myself making this tomato sauce for an entire pasta meal. It is definitely worth trying. It's a great base for adjusting to your personal preferences.

Just what I was looking for.  I had some store-bought chicken and four cheese ravioli that needed a simple tomato sauce.  Thanks!

I made this and it turned out really nice. I used sake instead of white wine and spiced it up with a little chili/sambal sauce and let it simmer for at least a half an hour. My husband loved it and and tells me I have to make it in bigger batches next time since I followed the serving for 4 recipe. I also added a little garlic and chicken stock to make it a bit more robust.

This is a good start but will definitely need other ingredients based on your tastes.  I added more tomato puree to thicken, sauteed mushrooms, garlic, basil, italian seasoning, oregano, and some sugar.  Everything else I added was to taste after I completed the recipe as stated.  Very fresh tasting sauce.

Bland as shown but a good base to add your own seasoning and spice things up. very simple so I'll be making this again with the suggestions of other reviewers.

I loved this although I did add a little minced garlic. It’s so simple and quick but tastes so fresh!  I don’t think I’ll buy pasta sauce again.  I added a little extra lean ground beef and bell peppers and had over zucchini noodles.  A little fresh Parmesan- viola!

I added a little oregano, garlic powder, fresh green pepper  and a dash of sugar. My husband says it was the best.  My neighbor left a bag of fresh tomatoes and peppers on our porch freshly picked that day.

I have never made tomato sauce from scratch and I gotta say it was to easy to not do it again! I loved it! We ran out of sauce and we live in the woods so a trip into town is just that, a trip! So I am thankful we had all the ingredients on hand, it was hit. Thank you
