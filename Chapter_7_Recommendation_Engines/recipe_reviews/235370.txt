This is probably the best pulled pork I've had and I have made a few! I had a 7 lb. pork shoulder to use,cooked it using 1 box of unsalted chicken stock in slow cooker. I used the spice rub minus the flour searing it on all sides per instructions for 8 hours on high. We used Dave's bbq sauce from this site(warm)on the side. Pork was delicious with sauce only the top of the sandwiches. Best spice rub ever!

This was tasty. I didn't find this very spicy at all and I am a spice wimp most of the time. Next time I'll up the hot sauce and/ or cayenne. It wasn't very sweet which was a nice change from the usual pulled pork

I wanted to go a little lighter on the heat so I substituted Red Pepper Flakes for Cayenne Pepper.  Turned out great.

Didn't take to long getting all together and browning outside. 30-45 min with sauce time. Before tossing in crock pot.      Everyone loved it.   Cooked side by side with another.  So family taste tested and approved recipe is a keeper.
