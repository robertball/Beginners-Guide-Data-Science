Pretty good, and easy to put together. I used about 1/2 cup of honey instead of the Splenda. I also added sliced onions, since I had some sitting around. My sauce was thin -- I guess due to the reduction in sweetener. It was tasty anyway. Thanks!

Super easy dish to make.  My husband and I loved it.  He's philippino, so this reminded him of chicken adobo.  The sauce is running but it went well with the other sides we had.  We ate it with steamed veggies and brown rice.  Will make this again.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was awful!!!!! I followed it perfectly. The sauce never bubbled and reduced. I think the Splenda should be replaced with brown sugar

Delicious!! I made some changes I added 1/2 cup of honey instead of Splenda like another reviewer suggested, I left out the white wine because I didn't have any, and added a clove of minced garlic and sprinkled onion powder on the chicken instead of garlic powder, combined all the ingredients in a resealable bag and cooked it on top of the stove instead of the oven.

Will try this recipe using brown sugar or agave.  Always give alternatives when using artificial sweetners.  Spenda is poison, google it!

It was good, but the sauce didn't reduce in the oven. So I poured it into a saucepan and reduced it on the stove.

We loved these chicken strips but I would never use Splenda on anything. I used honey and it turned out great!

I made this with only one substitution... I used one cup sugar instead of Splenda. Sauce was good but very thin. Chicken was good but not coated well. Next time I will try reducing the sauce BEFORE I coat and bake the chicken.

Delicious!!!  The kids ate it up!!!  My picky husband loved it to.  The only thing I didn't do was the Splenda. I just didn't have any in the house. Instead I used 1 cup of sugar and a cup of moscato wine.  Next time I will follow the recipe exactly to see if it can taste even better.

I don't know what went wrong, but this came out terrible when I made it. It took forever to cook, never got sticky, and it just tasted like I had dumped way too much soy sauce on some chicken strips.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. It was okay, but was nothing special. "Basting repeatedly" was also a semi pain. I've had better meals that took less effort and time to make so I probably will not make this one again.

This sounds like it would be very good, quick, and easy, Serve with green beans and a 1/2 twice baked potatoe. Nice meal.
