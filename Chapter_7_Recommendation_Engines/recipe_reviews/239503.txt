I admit I was a hard sell with this dressing, I thought for sure I would hate it. Honestly, I ADORE IT. I did increase the granulated garlic, dill weed and curry powder but other than that, I kept to the recipe. The longer this sits, the better it gets. Totally addictive. EXCELLENT WITH HOMEMADE PITA CHIPS.

I served this dip with a tray of crudites and my kids were fighting over the last cucumber spear. Even though I used a very heavy hand with the spice I still felt the dip was missing something. I added a tsp. of salt and a scant tsp. of sugar and it all came together.

My husband, who is normally not a big fan of dip, pronounced this delicious! I love dip and also thought it was great. I added a small amount of finely chopped spinach and a little more dill than called for to give it good color and texture. Very quick to throw together with ingredients I always have on hand.

This was absolutely delicious! I made as written and the hint of curry was soooo good! Don't shy away from adding the curry, it isn't hot/spicy at all. It just gives a hint of warmth and an extra kick of flavor! We tried this with chips and french fries- both great! I can't wait to try on a sandwich or burger as a spread!

I have made it several times.  It has become a family favorite.  I have used lime and lemon and varied the amounts of the ingredients.  It is always good.  You would have to go way overboard with an ingredient to ruin this recipe.

Think I may add bacon some day.

Not my favorite.  I made it exactly as directed and let it sit for over 2 hours and it was very bland except for the overwhelming celery salt taste which I thought was odd because there wasn't that much in the whole thing.  I tried adding more of some of the other spices but just couldn't do anything to make it taste less like just creamy celery salt.  IF I made this again(which I probably won't) I would omit the celery salt altogether.

Thank you for sharing!  Made it exactly as written (almost, I had no fresh parsley, so I used cilantro and no fresh dill so I used dry).  I was looking for a dip to use with seasoned pretzels (recipe on this site) and didn't want the same ol' dry ranch and sour cream recipe.  This was perfect.  Sort of refreshing and it would compliment any flavored chip, pretzel or fries.

Easy dip with on hand ingredients, I added cayenne pepper instead of the curry and it was great too!
