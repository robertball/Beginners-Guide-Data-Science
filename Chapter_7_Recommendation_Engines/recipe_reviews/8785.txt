I was skeptical...but this was great! Reminds me of a smothered/baked chicken. I would recommend salting the chicken before shaking it in the seasoned flour. Yummy!

I have never cooked fried chicken before. I was skeptical that this would turn out, but I was happily surprised. I fried chicken legs and I followed the recipe exactly. When the legs came out of the final simmering pan, I wasn't happy with how soft they were. I wanted my fried chicken crispy. I took the chicken and put it in the flour and seasoning again and fried it for another 5 minutes. We loved it! I enjoyed the extra coating and was so pleased with the outcome I will surely make this again. This is great, even a novice can cook this successfully!

This was AWESOME!  Everyone I made it for said it was the best fried chicken they had ever eaten.

I used this simple recipe with the sour cream recipe I found on here and I finally got it right. I used whole legs, next time I'll just use drumsticks. You are going to need more than a tablespoon of oil. Not a low fat recipe, but a great comfort food!!

oil amount has to be wrong, i used about 1/2 inch of oil, coating was too moist for me so i cooked 10 min longer without lid, flavor was 5 stars. Will be better next time.

What a wonderful recipe!  The chicken was amazing, very delicious and not dry or soggy.  You definitely need more than 1 Tbl of oil for the pan to get an inch.  I only added enough to make for 1/4 inch, and it was at least 3 Tbl.  I didn't have any sherry so I used 1/2 cup brandy and 1/2 cup apple juice.  Very moist texture and yummy flavor!

Another skeptic turned believer! This was absolutely delicious and a wonderful surprise. I use my own spices (Lawry's garlic salt, celery seed, black pepper and poultry seasoning) in my breading mix, but I cooked everything exactly the way it said. I cooked my vegetarian's Morning Star chicken tenders right in the sherry with the regular chicken and both kids asked for seconds. This recipe is a keeper!
