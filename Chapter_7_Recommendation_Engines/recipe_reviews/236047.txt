Fantastic! Just like mom used to make.  No it doesn't taste like coconut. It tastes like rice pudding but is dairy free for those with dairy  intolerance.  I used Jasmine rice, but often cook with brown rice and look forward to trying  that too.  A healthier treat.

I used maple syrup instead of sugar.  I also cooked them in my kid's mini doughnut machine and they were delicious.

I used coconut yogurt instead of coconut milk and in the glaze as well, gives it just a little tartness...Delicious, the family all loved them
