Very easy and really yummy. We doubled the recipe, but only used two full jalapenos. 6 jalapenos for 4 servings seems really crazy.

Well, this is easy enough. Interesting that the recipe photo shows beef chunks and carrots, neither of which the recipe calls for. A photo showing the actual prepared recipe should be added. That said, I made this without the jalapenos but needed to add quite a bit of seasoning to make it palatable. I also threw in rainbow carrot chunks. We ate it, but won't be making it again.

I made this recipe but I changed a lot of things from the original recipe. The recipe says 1 pound of ground beef, but the photo shows beef chunks or stew beef so I got a pound of stew beef. The recipe also didn't say any veggies for this it just did red potatoes, I did carrots that were already in my fridge and packaged and then I also added 2 celery sticks and some mushrooms. Also there was a photo of this recipe that showed carrots in it but it was not listed on the recipe. For seasoning I found the beef broth and water wasn't enough for flavor so I added season salt,  Worcestershire sauce, some red wine, some more onion already chopped and minced , minced garlic, these beef seasoning cubes forget what their called, dried thyme and 2 bay leaves. It turned out great! Lots of flavor and the whole family enjoyed it.

I concur with others who said it was bland - I had to add salt and pepper.  Next time I would also add carrots to the ingredients to take away the bland look of the stew.  I should also note that I cut way back on the peppers. Whether one uses pepper or not does negate the need for normal seasoning.

Too many jalapenos. I am a fan of spicy food but this is practically inedible even if you remove the seeds. Even looking past the jalapeno problem the food was pretty bland, it needed more seasoning.
