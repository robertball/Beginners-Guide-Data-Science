These were great! Just like Nonna used to make. very moist. If you don't have cake flour use: 1 c of all purpose flour minus 2 T, then add 2 T of cornstarch. Blend well.It works for most recipes. Thanks, Liz for this one.

This taste just like my Grandma used to make.  It is so easy and just one bowl to clean, if your a true Sicilian or would like to be one, try these.  Yummo!  Kid friendly finger food.

Excellent recipe, always a hit with the family.  I like to add in 2 tablespoons of almond extract, too.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were pretty good.  We definitely liked them better while they were hot. We did not care for the leftovers.

These were very tasty--sort of like rich doughnut holes. Kids would probably enjoy helping mix the batter and of course eating them, but the actual frying is probably best left to adults or older teenagers.

Just like Nona made!   Thank you Liz, how I have missed this from my childhood.
