Very good recipe! I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be for a whole pound of pasta (16 oz). I made it with a whole box of macaroni and there was *plenty* of cheese sauce. Be patient when heating up the milk/flour mixture and keep stirring. Heating it on anything besides low will probably cause it to burn on the bottom.

Great recipe, will make again.

This was a good macaroni and cheese recipe with a little zing. I made this recipe using an entire box of elbows and as another reviewer noted, there was plenty of cheese sauce. Be sure to use fresh grated cheese (not the pre-shredded stuff) – I think it makes a big difference! I didn’t have any croutons on hand, so I topped the casserole with seasoned bread crumbs instead- it was delicious!  Everyone gobbled up this comfort food with a kick- we will definitely make again!

This was great and easy! I kept the cheese sauce exactly the same but added turkey kielbasa, frozen peas and brocolli to the dish before I put it in the oven. My husband loved the macaroni cheese and the add-ins.

Goodbye kraft mac and cheese. This recipe is amazing! Super easy to make and definitely a pleaser of all. I didn't add the mustard or crushed red peppers and it was still the best mac and cheese ever! Will add those both next time.

This was just ok. The sauce tasted good after mixing it up, however, it seemed a little bland after baking. My husband is a fan of both pepper jack cheese and djion mustard. He was surprised dijon was an ingredient as he could not taste it. Easy to make, but will need alot more tweaking to get 5 stars.

This is an awesome recipe!!So easy to make tastes great the next day!! I omitted the spicy ingredients so the kids could eat it too and I added some shredded mozzarella cheese only because I didnt have quite enough colby and monerey jack. Delicious!! My husband and children loved it!! I do plan to try this with the spicy ingredients as well. I do agree with the other reviews that this recipe really does need a whole 16 oz of noodles because there is alot of sauce. Other than that Great!!

It was really good! My kids don't normally eat mac & cheese but they liked this,the croutons were a nice touch. I found the cheese to make this kinda exspensive though.

very yummy indeed!  I followed the recipe exactly, except of course - I doubt any of my ingredients came from California.  I think they came from good old NY dairy farms.  I used skim milk too, not to save on fat - just because that's what I drink.

This is awesome!! However, I live in TEXAS therefore I used Texas butter, Texas milk, Texas cheeses. Not sure if there is any difference with California products ... I added a jalapeño, chopped fine to give it that bite instead of crushed pepper flakes … Also tried with crushed buttered cornflakes on top ... I think it also needs a whole 16oz macaroni instead of just the 8oz

I made this because it combinds two of my favorite things, spicy foods and mac n cheese! It wasn't as spicy as i'd have hoped and it was really hard to grate the pepperjack. I didn't care for it, however I brought it to work and everyone there liked it.

This was bland & dry.  I followed the recipe to a 'T' so I am not sure what the problem was but it was not a hit at my house.

This recipe was indeed easy to make, and delicious too.  I made it for a dinner party and all of the guests really enjoyed it.  Upon the recommendation of previous folks' comments, I used 16oz of the Elbow Macaroni and that seemed to be the perfect amount for the cheese, but the next time I have 8 people over for dinner and make this recipe I will definitely make a double batch!  I'm also planning on making this again sometime next week and adding in peas and some type of spicy sausage...lots of ream for improvision with this dish.

Perfect combination of savory and spicy.  The only differences I made were to add Ritz with butter on top and I didn't have enough colby jack so I had to add a little sharp cheddar!  Yum Yum delicious!
