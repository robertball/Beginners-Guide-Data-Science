This was dissapointing. I was looking for a traditional mayonnaise recipe. This did not taste at all like mayonnaise! If you are looking to make mayonnaise from scratch, I'd suggest doing a search on any internet search engine for "mayonnaise recipe" and following a more conventional recipe. Oily and yuk! Note also that this recipe was submitted by the California Egg Commission - was this a product endorsement or a real recipe??

If this ends up oily you did not mix it enough or added the oil too fast.  This is a great recipe because it really is very thick, like whipped cream.  I added more black pepper and a dash of white pepper for a little kick.

This was not a great recipe.  It took a lot more time than my old mayonnaise recipe in order to get it to thicken.  I think something must have been left out of this recipe, perhaps the whites of the eggs?  When it did thicken, it was still not very thick and I was unable to get it to thicken more.

This recipe worked great for me.  I think the previous person may not have mixed it well enough.  I used a bowl and a hand-held mixer to make it. If you don't mix it really really well it is a oily mess. :)

I found this to be a terrific recipe. I like that it's cooked. I added slightly less oil (about 3/4 cup) plus I added 1 tsp of honey. Tastes better than store bought!

The first time I made this recipe it was very messy but I tried again and cooked the egg for longer (until it began to resemble a cornbread in consistency). My family loves it.

Silly to put it in the blender when it's such a small amount, once cool just whisk in the pan while adding oil a little bit at a time. Mine never got to a bubbly stage on low heat, quickly turned to a soft thick custard and would have scrambled if I hadn't acted fast.

I used  1 Tbs already prepared mustard instead of the dry mustard and 1 Tbs of water.  I didn't add sugar. Everything else is the same. 

The cooking goes really fast, so watch it closely. It tastes like it already has been made into a macaroni salad sauce rather than a true mayonnaise.
