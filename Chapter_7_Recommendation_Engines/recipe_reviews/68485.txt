For a second time experimenting with tofu and as a newly transitioned vegetarian, I would have to say that I'm impressed with this recipe.  I found it quite tasty, but as another reviewer wrote, I will probably use a bit of meat rub next time and allow it to marinate a little longer than 3 hours.  I would also try dicing the tofu instead of slicing it as it was kind of messy upon cooking.  Altogether, this was a fabulously tasty dish and I can't wait to prepare it again.  Thanks for sharing!

Super EASY and crazy TASTY! Adding a little bit of dry BBQ rub to the tofu before hand gives a little spicy action to the dish. I also broiled the tofu instead of baking it for an even greater texture. Great recipe!

This is one of my favorite ways to eat Tofu. Really nice flavor.:) I just try to marinate it as long as possible.. and the best thing about this is how simple it is.

Loved the idea of this recipes since it's so simple. I marinated to tofu overnight and added some granulated garlic and course ground black pepper. The flavor was AMAZING! I would recommend using extra firm tofu for this and maybe even if you have frozen tofu to defrost it and use that kind. Tofu that has been frozen tends to stay together better!

I couldn't find the VH Rib sauce as suggested so used Famous Dave's BBQ sauce. Turned out ok. I froze the tofu and thawed it first to give it a better texture. Then I cooked it as the recipe stated. I have to say it was better the next day after it sat in the fridge.

Was very disappointed in both the flavor and the texture. I love tofu in stir fry and cooked up with fruit but this was just unimpressive.

This was really really good. I've been looking for palatable tofu recipes. For me it's a "texture thing." I crumbled it to look more like ground beef then I cooked it with brown rice and added some Frank's Hot Sauce (I like spicey). I'll definitely make this again and I think I'll try some other store-bought marinades like Cuban mojo-style or chimmichurri.

Wouldn't do this again. The texture of the tofu didn't send us anywhere. A drawn out process for relatively low yield. We have other and better ways to prepare tofu.

I dried the tofu for an hour on a towel then marinated it in BBQ sauce for 18 hours. The sauce didn't penetrate the tofu at all. Let's be honest with ourselves here.... This is tofu bathed in barbecue sauce. You might as well eat a sponge bathed in barbecue sauce.

I think this recipe really depends on your barbeque sauce...the tofu didn't absorb the taste well.

This was ok. The first time I served it over white rice. The second time I marinade it in soy sauce and served it over some stir fried green red peppers onions and noodles. It is an easy way to create a meal.

I don't think I marinated my tofu long enough or maybe I didn't use enough liquid. I had it marinating for a full day and yet when I cooked it it didn't really taste like much. It wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be.

This is the first tofu recipe I've ever tried and I simply love it! It's so simple and full of flavor. It has a really nice firm texture and the barbecue sauce cooks up like grilled chicken! Mmmmm.....

I really liked it. Used some of the other reviewers suggestions. Extra firm tofu. Froze then thawed. Marinated over night in hickory smoke bbq sauce. Covered in garlic and herb bread crumbs. Fried then baked. Made for thanksgiving. Even my meat-lover brother liked it.
