This was really good. I skipped from putting it into a wrap. Gave some to my mom and she loved it. Will be keeping this one. Thanks!

This was yummy.. I had this both hot and cold and it was great both ways.  Next time I will make more sauce and keep some to drizzle over the rice. I did cook the carrots briefly... tossed them in with the rice during the last 5 minutes of cooking
