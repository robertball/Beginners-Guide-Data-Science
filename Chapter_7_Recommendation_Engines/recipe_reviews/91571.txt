I used my homemade bread to make these and they were gobbled up my my kids (and me) instantly!  We tried them with cream cheese, jelly, and salsa--all very tasty and SO easy to make.  A new favorite in our house.

I filled these tasty little cups with torn-up slices of honey roasted turkey, topped them with small pieces of swiss cheese, and popped them back in the oven until the cheese melted.  They were a huge hit with my coworkers, and no one could believe how simple they are!  I can't wait to try them with different meats and cheeses!

A creative recipe! The possibilities of fillings are endless. I made a cheesecake type filling. They were good.

They may take some prep time before getting them in the oven, but well worth the work!

These are the perfect bit-size hor d'oeuvres for any type of party that you want finger food at.  I made these for my sister-in-laws bridal shower and they were a hit!!  I made 3 variaties: white bread toast cups with a BLT filling (bacon and mayo mix topped with sliced grape tomato and little lettuce leaf; wheat toast cups with chicken salad filling topped with almond slice; and rye bread toast cups with reuben dip filling (filled these and stuck in oven on low temp until filling was warm and melty) ... they were all delish!!

This is great.  I can use my own diet breads and be able to stick to my diet.
