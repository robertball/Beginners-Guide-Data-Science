Very good recipe.  I reduce the amount of peppers and onions (I love the onions but many people are not too fond of onions in general!).   A keeper!

My whole family loved this!  Tangy is the right word to describe it...it's just an extra punch to plain old cornbread.

Umm,Umm, GOOD! I used minced jalepeno because I didn't have any green pepper. You might want to alter the baking time. Mine took 35 min. Delicious, moist & flavorful. Don't think this will be too hot or spicy, it's just right!

Easy to make, very moist and delicious! I leave the ground red pepper out so ours is not spicy at all. Highly recommended!!
