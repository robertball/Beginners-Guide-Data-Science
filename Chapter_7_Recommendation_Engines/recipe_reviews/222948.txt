a cup of oil and a quarter cup of butter? Ugh.  I pan fried the potatoes/squash in a couple of tablespoons of butter and that is all.  There is no need to go through with all the oil absorption, it cooks just fine without.  As for the rest, tasted delicious, even when I discovered I had no garlic and had to use garlic bread topping instead.

Very very good, but a bit rich with all that butter and oil.  I cut back the oil to about 1/2 the amount called for because I just knew from reading the recipe that it would be too much for me.  Still, I really enjoyed the end broduct, the yellow squash is a great addition to classic potatoes and onion.s  Thanks for sharing!

Just used two or three tables spoons of butter and caramelized the onions before I added the potatoes, cooked for about 10-15 minutes than added the squash and cooked another 5 minutes. Came out perfect!

I have fried squash, onions and potatoes together for a long time, all I do different is I coat the veggies in flour and season with salt and pepper. Shake off the excess flour, and start off with about an inch of shortening or oil in a skillet. When they are browned I stir them and if I need more grease I add it then. I have also fried them in the oven and it takes less grease. Either way it is a southern staple at my house in the summer...very good...

Great flavors, but as many other said...way too much oil. 3T of EVOO to start. Finishing  it with some butter to taste when squash was added did the trick. I didn't have three yellow squash so I used one squash, one zucchini and half a red pepper instead. Looked colorful and tasted great.

I made a little changes, I used a little bacon fat, with butter and held the potatoes. OH MY, this was the best.

My family and I thought this was delicious. I did not use any oil though, only butter. I also skipped the garlic powder and pepper flakes. My sister asked me for the recipe. I will definitely be making this again!

This was such an easy dish to make. I was cooking potatoes and thought what if I put in squash...did a search and this was the first recipe that popped up.  It was so flavorful. Yes I will make things again.

I decreased the oil by half and didn't even add the butter.  The end result was still pretty greasy.  Next time I won't add the onions until I put the squash in.  Diced onion does not need to cook for 30 mins.  They were pretty much burned black at the end of the cooking time.

Though a bit monochromatic, this was a tasty dish that helped me use the three squash, six Yukon gold potatoes, and onions I had just received in our produce box! I had to add a bit more salt than suggested since potatoes are so bland otherwise. This might also be good with curry powder, but Iâ€™ll have to try that some other time!

Used much less oil, just enough to fry without burning. Made with fresh farm veggies as per recipe. Delicious

Delicious! Like others, I used half the amount of oil as adjusted. I also sprinkled a little bit of shredded Parmesan cheese on top!

Cut way back on the oil to start, added more as needed.  I also cooked some bacon to add, and used a little of the drippings for frying.  To top this off sprinkle on some Old Bay Seasoning. Left-overs are great for breakfast with eggs on top.

Out of the ballpark home run hit for our entire family!  My kids love vegetables, but they had been challenged with squash.  Not now, they are asking me to make this again today.  Thanks for your simple recipe!

Had some extra squash from my farm-share and this was really delicious. And I'm not that fond of squash!
