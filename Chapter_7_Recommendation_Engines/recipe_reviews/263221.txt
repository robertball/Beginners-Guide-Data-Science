Excellent! The recipe doesn't state the size of the salmon fillets, but I used 6-8 oz center-cut pieces that were about 1-inch thick. I only used half the amount of marjoram, and I felt that was plenty.  The salmon was perfectly cooked after 12 minutes, a juicy medium-well. Loved the extra honey-mustard topping at the end. A keeper!
