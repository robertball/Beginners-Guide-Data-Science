This is a recipe I also use and get rave reviews over.  However....I adapted it 3 yrs ago from TX Land and Cattle restaurant's version, only they use brown sugar and Shiner Bock dark beer!  With this bourbon version, I lay my fillets out and gently press the brown sugar into the fillets, then sprinkle them with the bourbon - I let them "rest" for about 30 minutes before quickly browning the sugar glazed filets over med-high heat in a non-stick saucepan, about 2 min each side. I wrap up the cooking process by popping them in the microwave for 1-1 1/2 minutes, depending on the thickness of the filets. These filets make a terrific presentation in a romaine-based salad with a topping of honey and brown sugar glazed coarsely chopped pecans (Johnny Carino's restaurants serve it like this) Enjoy! Impressive and will work well over the holidays.

Absolutely wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I'm not sure why the previous reviewers experienced burned food, I had no problems. Just in case though, be sure not to use too much heat. Good luck!

The only change I made to the recipe was to soak my salmon in milk first to help counteract that fishy flavor. I was hoping that the bourbon would make "saucier" caramel but it all evaporated off & the caramel was indeed, caramel. I made extra to use as a topping & as soon as it hit the plate it solidified into a pretty tasty, chewy morsel of caramel. But who wants to peel caramel off their plate? LOL The flavor was great paired w/ the salmon though so next time, I'll add the bourbon later so that it doesn't all cook off. I paired this w/ brown rice cooked in wine & chicken broth & a salad w/ rice pudding for dessert. Thansk for a nice recipe Debbie F...we enjoyed it.

Delicious! I took the advice of another user and added 1/4 cup soy sauce and a crushed garlic clove, added with the bourbon.  I let the sauce simmer to a glaze after I removed the fish.  The glaze is very flavorful/sweet, so if you are afraid of overpowering your salmon, I'd skip this recipe or leave the extra glaze off.  I, however, enjoy the strong, sweet flavor and used a generous amount over my fish and brown rice :).

WOW!!!!  Only the words of my fiance could do this recipe justice.  "This is like gor-met or something!"  Very simple to make.  I served it with white rice, corn on the cob, and cherry tomatoes in dressing.  It was a very appealing presentation.  5 STARS!!!!!

I used Schwans frozen salmon pieces, which when cooked produced a little more liquid than the original recipe called for.  To compensate, I left the salmon in the pan, turned the heat off, and continued cooking my vegetables.  This worked out great!!!!  The sauce formed a thin crust on the salmon.  The flavor was wonderful and the leftover salmon was great in a caeser salad the next day!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband raved about it!  Definitely fit for guests and it tastes like you spent hours on it, but it only takes minutes.
I will be making this on a regular basis.  This is the best salmon recipe I've ever tried.

I thought this was very good, but it was VERY sweet - I love sweet sauces with meat, but it was a bit too sweet for my husband and daughter.  If you like the bourbon taste, also try the orange and bourbon grilled salmon recipe - it is awesome!

this was a great recipe...i def. took all the suggestions....i 1st soaked the fillet salmon in milk for about 10-15mins...then i laid the fillet in a baking pan added the dark brown sugar and the bourbon to the fillet. Then 1 min later i added some slices of pineapple with a pinch of pineapple juice to the fillet, bourbon, and dark brown sugar. I let it all soak for 30 mins. Then after the 30 mins was up, i pretty much followed the direction as stated....Melted the butter in a skillet( REDUCE THE HEAT). I then added additional dark brown sugar( about 1/4 cup) to the melted butter, then i added the fillet...cooked it for about 5mins, turned the salmon over and poured the previous bourbon that was in the baking pan over the filler, then continued cooking the salmon for another 5 mins. After cooking the salmon in the skillet i then removed the salmon from the skillet and placed them in a flat plate and microwaved them for 2 mins to allow for a better thickness....After microwaving i used the glaze from the skillet and poured it over the salmon( I must add that if you are not in a rush wait for the galze to cool down to allow for a thicker glaze).....I was in a rush and i just poured it over and it was still great...I just made this today for a potluck i went to and did not even taste it...Everyone who attended the potluck LOVED IT....They were mad when it ran out....Will def. make again....As far as the sides goes...I made wild rice to compliment this....

I found this recipe at this site, and have been using it over and over, learning from it how to love salmon, since I was told to eat it for my high cholesterol.

BUT: A WARNING to the wise!
I thought it would be healthier to bake it. On opening the oven, fumes & flames shot out & burned me, sending me to the ER with second degree burns!

This site should always include precautions about cooking with alcohol!

Very fast, very easy, and very tasty, this is a fantastic recipe.
I actually had no bourbon on hand, but the Canadian whisky which I did have worked perfectly.

I have used this recipe several times with fresh salmon.  Everyone compares it to a gourmet meal prepared in an expensive restaurant.  I make no changes to the receipe as written, however, the fresh alaskan salmon I have been using is not real thick so I have to cook on low to barly medium heat.  Just adjust temperature according to salmon tickness.

Excellent! I had some slivered almonds on hand, so I threw a few on top of the salmon. I served with parsley-ed potatoes and fresh steamed green beans and we had a fantastic meal for about $3.50 a plate (and I'm including the price of the whiskey). Warning - if you have sauce left over in the pan, immediately fill the pan with water. Do not sample the leftover sauce! My husband had to forcibly take the pan away from me.

I made this last night for my boyfriend (my first homecooked meal for him!) and we both loved it. I used Jack Daniels whiskey & light brown sugar because that's what I had on hand. I usually end up over-cooking my salmon, but this one came out perfect. We live in Alaska, so we take our salmon seriously and this is definetly a new favorite!

Very good recipe.  My BF cooked this and I was quite impressed not only with the taste, but b/c it only probably took him less than 30 min to prepare and cook.  It has a very sweet taste, but definitely not overpowering, it blends well.  I'd strongly recommend this recipe to anyone who has gotten bored with the typical salmon and lemon or salmon and dijon taste.  A different way to serve this fish and very presentable with a garnish of persley or any other fresh green leaf.

Best Salmon recipe for glaze lovers. Couldn't believe how fast and easy this was. Taste was spectacular and fish was perfectly done. Must be careful to put on MEDIUM heat. I burned the sugar the first time and had to start again.

I am very fond of salmon, I have almost exhausted all salmon recipes so coming across this was marvellous. Not only was it enjoyable, it was sooooo easy to prepare. I also added some pepper flakes and substituted the whiskey for good ole Barbadian Rum (the finest). If u are contemplating this recipe, contemplate no more, it's what's cooking!!!!!! Five Stars for sure!

I served this for my husband the first night he got home from a one year tour in South Korea.  It felt like we were at a resteraunt. I served it with wild rice, brown sugar glazed baby carrots and a nice bottle of Chardonnay.  This will be a regular for us now!!!!

This is by far the best recipe I have ever tried on this site - and I have tried a lot. This is the only one I have made no changes on. I would have given it 10 stars if I could have. Delicious!

This was a huge hit. 

Instead of cooking it completely in the skillet I cooked on the skillet for 1 1/2 minute per side and then grilled the salmon, basting each piece when I turned them, to keep the flavor in tact. 

It was such a huge hit, I will definitely make it again.

This was very good. I made it for Christmas Eve dinner for my husband and me and we both enjoyed it. I do think the glaze was too thick though... it was actually  more like caramel with a boubon kick than a glaze/sauce. It was very tasty though and I will serve it again!

My husband loves this recipe.  I've also made it with soy sauce instead of bourbon when I didn't have any on hand.  It worked well and wasn't quite as sweet, so some of my family preferred the soy sauce version.

Pretty good recipe for when you can't grill it.  I slightly modified it by using fillets and Southern Comfort.  A non-stick skillet is a must!

MMMMMM,mmmmmmmm.  My husband doesn't like salmon, but I thought I could mask the flavor with this sauce.  I loved it - he loved the sauce.  Next time, I'll try it with tuna or mahi,mahi.  Super quick and easy.

This came out great.  It has inspired me to try various other simple butter/alcohol/sweetener sauces on fish, and many of them are very good.  I suggest experimenting with various combinations.  One that has come out well for me after a little tuning is using honey and amaretto with some mustard also.

Truely wonderful, easy, delicious salmon recipe.  I made it exactly as stated. Just added chopped  pecans to the sauce after cooking the fish as a topping.  Placed on a bed of cooked brussel sprout salad (check out the photo). Makes a nice contrast to the sweetness of the fish and sauce.  This is good enough for my next dinner party!

Solid recipe, I added some soy sauce and garlic to the bourbon and used a little less butter than recommended. Turned out well.

These were delicious and *very* easy to make.  My husband gave it 2 thumbs up.  I cooked these in a non-stick skillet which I hardly ever use, but I think this is necessary for this dish.  The tops of the fish come out picture perfect and there was plenty of sauce for 4 salmon steaks.  I served these with green beans and couscous.  

My only issue was with the texture of the fish, but I used frozen fish and I really don’t know how long they have been in the freezer.  Also, 10 minutes total may have been too long, or perhaps my heat was too high.  I will make these again and try to remedy these issues.

Fabulous recipe. Love this sauce. Maybe I didn't let mine cook long enough- the sauce didn't seem thick enough, but it was amazing any way.  Great flavor!

I made this for dinner last night and we loved it.  My husband said it should become a regular in our house.  I cooked it over medium in a non-stick pan and had no trouble with the sugar burning as long as I stirred it frequently.

This is a great recipe!  I loved the glaze.  I agree that it would be great over a rice pilaf.  I can also see making sweet potatoes as a side dish.  Yum!  I made this with a garlic butter asparagus and the flavors were too different.  It was sweet and I will cut down on the sugar a bit next time but it wasn't bad, I don't like food to be overly "sweet" so I am very aware of the sweetness.  My husband loved it and I think with the right side dish it would be really good.  I never knew bourbon would make such an awesome glaze?  I used really cheap bourbon I keep on hand for brining turkey and it was still great.  Thanks for this recipe.

I really liked this salmon, but my husband loved it. He wanted more sauce. Don't cut back on the bourbon, though, or the sugar in the sauce may  make it harden up or even crystallize.

We just love salmon and ususally grill it outdoors but it was dark and freezing so I needed a good indoor recipe!   This was VERY tasty, however it got almost burned since I had to cook it longer than 10 minutes.  The sauce was extremely yummy......  Yes, we'll do this one again sometime soon....

This was very easy to make, and a big hit with some people who don't normally like salmon.  The flavor of the bourbon and brown sugar covers the salmon taste, without destroying the salmon's delicate texture.  The sauce is good enough that I want to try it with other pan-seared meats as well.

My husband made this for Valentine's Day for us, and is making it again tonight for my birthday. This has become one of my favorite meals! He cooked the salmon exactly as described in the recipe, and everything came out really well. He used Jim Beam Red Stag bourbon (which has a cherry flavor), and the flavor was great!

This recipe is very good!  I made it two nights in a row - the first night for a dinner party and the next night for the remaining salmon fillet (uncooked) we had left over.  Doing so presented an interesting experience:  the first night, with 5 smaller fillets in the pan, the sauce was perfect.  Tonight, with one fillet, but the same quantity of ingredients so we'd have extra sauce, it caramelized.  Either way, it was still good, but I guess the recipe cooks better with more fillets to absorb the sauce.

I made this with the recipe on this site titled, Green Beans with Almonds, and put the salmon on a bed of long-grain brown rice.  The combination was awesome!  "Gourmet like a restaurant" was the compliment it got.  Given that I am still rather new to cooking, this was high praise to receive!

I agree with the reviews that said it was too sweet. I even added some chili powder and cayenne to the fish as a rub, but it wasn't enough to balance the sweetness. This dish may be lacking in acid; I won't try this specific recipe again.  Sorry Debbie, it was just too sweet.

I used this recipe for the 1st time I ever cooked fish &  I'm so happy I did! This recipe is easy peasy & DELICIOUS! Made dinner with sauteed green beans & roasted potatoes for the boyfriend & he gobbled it up, requesting seconds. The only thing I changed is I subbed bourbon for soy sauce bc I didn't have any bourbon around. Sad. Also, be careful! The sauce thicken's really quickly.

I'm giving this a 5, even though it was a bit too sweet.  We LOVED the ingredients, and I think the next time I'll cut back a little on the brown sugar and add a little garlic.  We loved the flavor of Jack Daniel's!  Served over sticky rice?  Ohh, YUM!

This would have been great if I didn't follow the reviews that said adding soy sauce was a good idea- it isn't. Thankfully, the way I did the salmon was cooked partially in the brown sugar-butter mixture flesh side down then finished in a 350F oven for 15-20 mins and then did the sauce, adding maple whiskey and soy. Served the sauce on the side, and no one liked it. The salmon with brown sugar glaze is tasty, not too sweet at all. Of course, this is meant to be eaten right after making, other wise it turns to caramel. I will re-make a small portion of sauce without soy for the leftovers.

Really good!  It is pretty sweet but very tasty.  Now I don't have to order this at our favorite restaurant, I can make it whenever I want & save money!  Thanks for sharing.

I did NOT like this recipe. All I could taste was the brown sugar.  It was way too sweet, but flavorless...just sweet. Will not be using this recipe again.

This was very good. I used salmon fillets instead of steaks. I'm not really a salmon lover but I'm trying to incorporate more fish into my diet and this made it more enjoyable.

This was pretty tasty and I liked it more than I thought I would. My husband loves sweet sauces on salmon, but I usually like more garlicky/dill flavors. This was sweet but it was tasty. I followed the ingredient list and portions exactly but I cooked it longer.  I liked it best when I sprinkled green onions on top. Thanks for sharing your recipe :)

This was a good recipe. I unfortunately had no bourbon (not much of a drinker) and no money to get it (under-employed, under-paid). But, I did see that one cook used soy sauce instead, so I thought I'd try it out! I think I would have used less soy sauce and more brown sugar, but it was a quick and easy glaze to make my salmon more palatable (not much of a salmon-eater, but I'm trying to eat healthier!). Thanks!

If you have a bad piece of salmon and want to mask the flavor, this is the recipe for you. It was way too sweet and a poor choice for a good piece of salmon.

This recipe was terrible. The glaze overpowered the salmon, the sugar burned, and it just tasted way too sweet.

Was disappointed in the heavy bourbon taste.  I followed recipe, didn't change anything.  Used dark brown sugar as recipe stated and I kept the heat on the lower side which didn't burn the sugar.  Salmon was done perfectly.  Husband said  "too heavy bourbon taste".  I agreed.
2nd review: Made again without the bourbon, drizzled a little low sodium soy sauce around salmon instead.  Very good.  Not super sweet with dark brown sugar.  Would rate 4 stars now.

My family just finished this meal and I have to review it immediately!  I followed the advice of many other reviewers and added approximately 1/4 cup of lite soy sauce and 2 small cloves crushed garlic. I added onion powder at the end, but would have used scallions if I had them.  It was still sweet, but the sauce is completely gone!  I also cooked the salmon on low heat to prevent burning of the sugar, then removed it to hold in the oven while I reduced the sauce over medium heat while stirring continuously.  Wonderful, wonderful taste!

I was a hero with this recipe.  Very easy and tasty.  My kids loved it.  Next time I would lighten up on the bourbon a bit...a little of that flavor goes a long way.  Also, I used filets instead of a steak cut.... It took about a minute(of cook time) off of each side.   Served with rice, salad and fresh fruit...what a hit this made!!!

I followed this recipe exactly, and was very disappointed.  It was so sweet that we couldn't even finish it.  I thought the bourbon would counteract the sweetness of brown sugar, but I will not be making this again.

After reading previous reviews, I sprinkled each filet with salt, used a combo of half butter and olive oil, and cooked the fish over lower heat than stated.  Turned out great!!  Will certainly be making this again!

Love this recipe.  Great way to get my family to eat their fish.  My husband does not like fish, especially salmon.  He loved this.  I served it up with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  Definitely a new favorite.

This was excellent!  I used blackened salmon that I got from Sam's Club, and reduced the serving size to 2.  I used Splenda Brown Sugar and reduced that to 2 tablespoons instead of 1/4 cup.  It turned out delicious.  Will definitely make this one again.

FANTASTIC!  Made this with filets, rather than steaks.  The trick is the low heat.  Excellent flavor and a great sauce to drizzle with.  Simple ingredients and a quick prep time.  Highly recommended.

I was thoroughly disappointed with this receipe dispute the rave reviews. Over medium heat, the sugar burned and hardened and I served "candied salmon". - the sugar flavor overpowered the fish and the flavor of the bourbon was subtle if not missing altogther. Future alterations - I'd keep the heat to med-low and cover the dish to cook the fish throughout. I'd add the bourbon during the last couple of minutes of cooking and plan on a 15-20 min cook time. I'd also reduce the amount of sugar and butter.

Usually when I make salmon only the outside has any flavor.  This was delicious all the way through, quick, easy and my husband ate seconds (and this NEVER happens with fish).  Also, I substituted half Smart Balance and half Smart Balance Light for the butter (why eat salmon if you're going to add all that saturated fat?) and it glazed up nicely even with that change.

This is a great recipe, quick and easy for entertaining.  However, I did add a few extras! 1 large crushed garlic clove and about a 1/4 cup soy sauce, and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  Wonderful!

The ingredients to this sounded so wonderful, but I wish I had read more reviews first.  It turns out lots of reviewers had trouble with burning the sauce, but no one had posted that recently.  So I only read the first page of reviews and burned the sauce.  Once it is even the smallest amount burned, it will continue to blacken until it's tar by the end of the cooking time.  I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because I imagine it's mostly my fault that it didn't turn out well.  I will make it another time and see if I can keep the heat low enough to not burn it. If I can, I will add stars to my rating.  If I can't, I'll take some away because maybe it's the recipe and not just me.

This is excellent, but it's so rich I had heartburn for hours afterwards.  It was worth it! I used Jack Daniels and I served it with baked potatoes and peas.  I think flavored rice and fresh asparagus would be much better, but the salmon is to die for! I will definately make it again. Thank you Debbie!

Very Good...But better if you omit butter, let salmon set for 1 or 2 hours in the brown sugar and bourbon. Then put on grill!

Made this on a Saturday night in for someting special, it was awesome.  We served it with wilted greens and wild rice and it was excellent.  I do not like sweet food, and I had no problem with this, we can't wait to make it again.

Very pretty, but WAY TOO SWEET - & I used 1/3c brown sugar.  I love what most people call "too rich" or "too sweet," but this baby is too sweet for even me.  I'll try substituting some soy sauce for the bourbon & reducing the brown sugar.

We did not like this recipe.  I ended up with a thick sweet burnt sugar coating that spoiled some expensive wild sockeye salmon.  I realize I am in the minority, so maybe it was the cook, but I won't make again.

This recipe is fabulous.  My husband and I really enjoy salmon, but I have been making the same old lemon-garlic-dill salmon forever!  This was a great change, and I look forward to making it for guests.  Thanks for sharing...awesome!

I had a hard time believing this could be as good as everyone says because it's so simple and there's no marinating.  The salmon picks up the flavors very well and the flavor combination is great.  It wasn't too sweet for me, but I can how it would be for some.  My only change was seasoning pieces with salt and pepper (habit).

Such superb results for such an easy recipe!  Hubby forgot to pick up bourbon so I used Bushmills Irish Whiskey instead.  Made this as a main course for a dinner party and everyone raved!  Delicious and will definitely make again...

This was delicious and fast and easy to make.  I tweaked it a little: as a reviewer suggested,  I sprinkled brown sugar on the salmon before cooking it, but used only about 1 Tbsp of sugar for 4 fillets.  I then mixed about 3 Tbsps of low sodium soy sauce, the juice of half a lemon,  1/2 tsp of honey,  and 1 shot of bourbon, and sprinkled a little on each fillet.  I let the fish sit for about 20 mins, then pan fried it 2 mins. each side (the fillets were thin).  When the fish was ready, I took it out of the pan, and put in the rest of the sauce, boiling it until it thickened.  I poured this over the fish and served it with rice and asparagus.  Delicious!

Delicious and easy!  I did add 1/4 cup soy sauce and 2  crushed garlic cloves to cut down on the sweetness based on other reviews.  It was just the right amount of sweetness.  Will definitely make again!

We thought this would be strong and tasty, but really it was just sweet (too sweet). You could smell the bourbon while it was cooking (for much less than 5 minutes a side!), but when it was done it didn't tast smoky, just sweet. It was something different, but not what we like or were looking for, unfortunately.

This is the first time I've ever been disappointed by a highly rated recipe on here. I had to cook  the salmon longer than the 10 minutes in the recipe, which led to a caramel sauce that solidified the instant it left the pan. To make matters worse, the salmon was not done. If I were ever to make this again I'd cook the salmon a while before creating the sauce.

I think this failed because of me, because everyone else seemed to have success.  I used med-low heat, but the sugar burned, made a huge mess and the salmon didn't really cook through in the time (Probably due to low heat).  I'd give it another try if it wasn't going to take me forever to get burned sugar off my pan.

This was good, but next time I will not spoon the sauce over the salmon....it was very thick and caramel-like and stuck to our forks drawing long strings of the sugary substance from the plate to our mouths....not an easy eating experience.  Once we scraped the sauce off the remaining salmon, we really enjoyed it.  To sum it up, we really liked the flavoring the sauce gave to the salmon, but didn't enjoy the sauce itself.

My oldes son (age 7) is a little foodie. He won't eat anything red or pasta unless its in a cream sauce. He absolutely loved this one and it was very easy to prepare. Will be a staple in our house now.

So easy. So fast. So yummy. I didn't have enough bourbon in my cupboard, so I mixed in some Jack Daniels as well.  Worked just fine.   Next time, I might try a little less butter so it's not quite as fattening, but not sure if that will work as well or not.

Very easy and good.  I thought it was a little sweet, but my husband thought it was one of the best salmon recipes I've made.

I love this recipe.  My husband (and even my picky in-laws) love it too!  I marinate the salmon in the bourbon/brown sugar mix for about 30 minutes before cooking.  It is my favorite recipe on the entire website!  Thanks so much.

This recipe is awesome, although I changed it a little. Instead of burbon, I added soy sauce....so tasty.

My steaks were slightly bigger than 6 oz each, I kept the sugar and bourbon at the amount suggested and let me tell you... this was sickenly sweet!! I felt like eating a bag of Dorito's right after!! Way too much sugar. I liked the flavor but it needs to be balanced somehow. Either reduce the sugar considerably or ... maybe that soy sauce addition some reviewers are talking about is the key!!

This was very good, but very sweet. I halved the recipe, used 2 tablespoons tequila and one tablespoon soy sauce in lieu of the bourbon. The sauce was delicious! It would have been great over a bread pudding or cinnamon rolls. I really liked it on the salmon, but I can see how some would find it too sweet. Do be careful of the stove temp - I cooked on pretty low and it worked out great.

Delicious!  Wouldn't hesitate to serve for company either but proud to serve family.  Only changes to recipe I made were to briefly soak fillets in milk, then sprinkle with garlic powder (had no fresh, egads!) & pepper, then add 2 T soy sauce to sugar mixture prior to adding fish.  Very tasty, nice sauce with the perfect consistency.  I read reviews who thought it was too sweet, but not for our tastes.

Really the best! Especially if you are not a big fan of fish. I make this once a week for my family so we can get our recommended serving of fish in once a week. So yummy!

This Salmon was really good. I doubbled the recipe and added some scallions at the end.  I also used Southern comfort instead of Burbon but that was because I didn't have any burbon in the house. The family loved it and my son who could b e a bit picky ate 2 servings. Definately a keeper.

My mom has been making this same recipie for years, she talked a chef at a certain resturant into giving it to her, after my parents ate and fell in love with this divine salmon dish. The first time I made it for my husband of a year and a half, he swooned! Its just such a great combo! I recommend it to everyone.

I followed the directions as written and personally really liked this, even though it is quite sweet. My boyfriend, on the other hand, did not like the sweetness of it. I prepared as written and served it over a brown rice with sesame green beans on the side. Made for a very nice meal. I will make this again... just not for my boyfriend. :-)

first, i soaked the fillets in milk per other reviewers, and then gently pressed the sugar in the fillets, sprinkled the bourbon on top and let them rest for an hour or so (again, another reviewer's advise).  i could not even eat it. it was waaaaaaaaaaay too sweet, and i usually LOVE sweet things. this was just too much. i really thought it would be better.

I tried this recipe but wanted to cut down on the fat/sugar content so I substituted 2 Tbsp of worchestershire and 2 Tbsp of lite soy sauce for the 4 Tbsp of butter and added a Tbsp of olive oil.  I whisked in a 1/4 cup of brown sugar (instead of 1/2) and let that heat to a boil over medium heat before adding the salmon which i peppered on both sides with fresh ground pepper.  I didn't change the cooking times or instructions after that.  The family enjoyed it; especially my 13 year-old son!

This easy recipe tastes very good!  Be EXTREMELY careful with the heat!  Use less heat rather than more or the sugar will caramelize.  Yuck!  I had obtained a free bourbon salmon from Publix so just used this recipe to compliment.

I am a huge salmon lover and get nervous if too much is done to it. This recipe was fantastic and three years later, I still get regular cravings for it. Sometimes it's a little too sweet so I decrease the sugar content just a little.

This was just ok for us. I had no problem with the sauce burning or anything, but to me it was plain. Boyfriend said it was "nothing special." Not sure what I expected this to taste like, but whatever I was expecting, I didn't get it. I'll probably make this again but try to change it some for a different taste.

Ver Good no doubr about it. I just felt so guilty enjoying it with all that butter and calories. The glaze goes a long way too. I should have used a few more slabs of Salmon to use it all up. it was so good I was drinking it with a spoon. Delicious!!

Wonderful.  I used light brown sugar (all I had); less butter; more bourbon.  I also covered the pan while the salmon was cooking.  Very tender and a lovely, not-too-sweet flavor.  (I served with wild rice and steamed veges).

It is really good and easy to make. But next time I will like to add a little bit of orange or lemon zest, garlic or onion, salt and pepper. That will make it even better.

Very easy, delicious recipe. I had no trouble with the sauce burning, though I did cook it over medium-low heat. It might be a little sweet for some tastes, but I liked it.

We had no brown sugar, so I made some 1:2 molasses to white sugar.

I thought this was just okay and thought it needed more flavor.  My husband really liked it though.  Not sure if I would make it again.  Sorry

A yummy inventive way to cook salmon.  Add a tablespoon or two of lemon to give it a fresh sweet tang

This recipe was excellent! I kept the skin on, and once the salmon was cooked it peeled off very easily. My pieces were a little large so I cooked them slightly longer than the recipe called for. Overall they were very miost and full of flavor.

I sized this down for 2.  It didn't really work.  My  salmon steaks were very thick and required a longer cooking time.  I did cook the fish on med-to-med-low but I think that the sugar carmelized too much because of the longer cooking time.  The sauce turned into a goopy total loss.  I did like the taste of the fish itself but I had to pry it from the pan.  It was far from pretty.  Will try again for 4 steaks and see if it I get better results.

This is so good!  I've made it several times substituting the bourbon with brandy (it's what we had in the house the 1st time I tried the recipe).  This is my husband's favorite meal now!

I loved how quick and easy this recipe is, which makes it worth keeping.  It is however, a little too sweet for my taste; I topped it with Mango Salsa, which helped cut the overly sweet taste.

I'm sorry but I did not like this recipe at all.  It's way too sweet and I even added some red pepper flakes to the sauce but that didn't help.  It's candied salmon.  Took one bite and put it in the fridge.  Will let my 3 year old granddaughter try it and see what she says.

I suppose it could be good baked a different way (grilled, wrapped in aluminum foil) but why waste salmon with this recipe when you could make it as ginger salmon or honey coconut salmon.  Both recipes are in allrecipes.com and so superior to this one.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was quick and very easy to make. I added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar at a time through out cooking to make sure it did not get overly sweet as other people had indicated. We will use it again, thanks for sharing.

My husband made this the other night and we just loved it.  I first sprinkled the salmon w/some spices (garlic, lemon pepper, salt, pepper etc.) out of habit but the sauce was so delicious (I kept scaping the pan to get every bit of it), we probably didn't need the extra spices.  Will definitely make this constantly (it was so easy!).  Thank you Debbie.

This Salmon recipe is so delicious and easy! I served with jasmine rice and baby carrots.  After removing cooked salmon from the pan I added cooked baby carrots, gave them a swirl around the pan to pick up some of the bourbon glaze and plated next to salmon. I spooned remaining glaze over the salmon. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was fast and really easy. I made the salmon with asparagus and brown rice and it was delicious. The salmon I used has the skin on, so I put it skin side up at first, and then flipped the fish about 5 minutes into it. I didn't have bourbon, but I did have Tennessee whiskey, and that worked out just fine. I'm sure you can get more creative by using flavor infused whiskey (like cherry).

I made this and it was a big hit with the wife, and I loved the too.  I did make some changes and here are my suggestions: First, pat the salmon dry so it's seers and does not steam in the pan.   Second, season both sides with salt and pepper. Next, I made the glaze without putting the salmon in the pan. I added the butter, brown sugar and liquid. I did not use all bourbon, I used half of the recommended liquid as Brandy and the other half was low sodium soy sauce and hot teriyaki sauce.   Once the glaze was melted and combined which was about one minute I poured it into a small bowl and set it  aside.   I wiped out the pan and added olive oil and then seared the salmon skin side first for 2 to 3 minutes per side depending on its thickness.   Once the salmon was seared I reintroduced the sauce and coated the fish on all sides for about an additional minute. I plated it with some asparagus  risotto  and it was wonderful

For those who said the sauce became carmel, you most likely used margarine instead of butter!  Do not do that.

Outstanding! Wouldn’t change a thing, except I’m out of bourbon, so substituted cognac. I will definitely make this healthy, delicious recipe often, making sure to have some good Kentucky bourbon in house! Everything finished "as advertise"!

Delicious and quite easy.  I would recommend spraying pan welll with cooking spray.  I used a bourbon infused with maple for added flavor.  Rinse pan out shortly or you're in for some pot scrubbing!

A little too sweet. Would have liked the sweetness combined with some savory flavors. If I try it again, I will try some of the other reviewers advice re: adding garlic and soy.

Super easy to make! I didn't have any Bourbon, but I followed someone's advice on adding soy sauce and a clove of garlic (chopped). I was afraid that it will be too sweet, but it wasn't. I like it and I will be making it again. :)

This was awesome even though I didn't have bourbon (my brother recently polished off the bottle ... And I will definitely make with bourbon soon!) I used soy sauce instead and added a dash or two of toasted sesame oil. Magnificent! Served it with grilled asparagus as suggested. Thank you for the idea! The brown sugar is fab!

Everyone loved it, was asked to make it again for company. I did make an addition of chopped pecans. Served with braised brussel sprouts and saffron rice.

This is very sweet...the fish ends up with a nice flavor but resist the urge to add more sauce to the fish after cooking.  Ends up tasting like candied salmon (if there is such a thing) on thin pieces of fish.

Excellent taste!  My husband and I like salmon, but have tired of it fixed the same way.  So I decided to try this recipe.   I didn't have any Burbon on hand except for honey flavored.  Well that was the kicker!  What flavor...I will make it again the same way and soon.

I am compelled to rate this recipe, though I have never rated one in 10 years of using Allrecipes.  It was a perfect recipe, just as it is.  I used Irish whiskey, Tullamore Dew; and my husband, who is not crazy about fish, overcame the initial skepticism at my using his whiskey for the fish at first taste.  Now we want to try the same thing with pork chops.  Kudos, DEBOKC on the superb recipe!

Just made this tonight.  I took the advice of previous cooks and reduced the brown sugar by half.  Everything else I left the same.  It was still plenty sweet and yummy.  My hubby likes a little bit of heat, so I sprinkled creole seasoning over his.  The buttery-sugary-bourbon glaze is divine.  Serving it with a simple salad.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS! I didn't know how it would taste because of the smell and how the bourbon tasted all by itself but man was I suprised! I bet this would taste great over rice, I'm definitely going to try it next time. This is DEFINITELY a keeper!!

My boyfriend likes it but was too sweet for me.  I like spice with my salmon and I should have known better.  The brown rice turned out great with a slight variation on the broth and water.  And I made steamed broccoli with it.

Excellent salmon recipe. The only changes I made were to saute some garlic with the butter,substituted brandy for the bourbon, and add a dash of worcheshire sauce. perfect, fast and delicious recipe.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe!!  I did not change a thing.  I do however, highly recommend doubling the sauce...you will want more!  For sides I did Success Rice brown rice (takes only a minutes and is perfect every time) drizzled with a little of the bourbon sauce, and asparagus & sweet onions sauteed in olive oil.  Served with a nice dinner wine, this is an inspiring meal... My Sweetie and I have added it to our list of all-time favorites.

This was incredible! My boyfriend had gotten a very nice, dark beer for Christmas I ended up using instead of the bourbon - although I expect you could use any dark beer and have it turn out well. I ended up using some rather thick fillets, so I cooked them over med/low temp for around 13-14 min, because I was afraid of burning (which I didn't have a problem with), so next time I think I'll stick with med. temp and it would cook faster. I served this over rice (I soaked up any extra glaze with it - so good!) and then also served steamed asparagus spears. Very cheap (about $7 for two large salmon fillets), delicious, and healthy to get that serving of fish in! Highly recommended.

Fantastic!  I have made this recipe a few times and we absolutely LOVE it.  The first few times that I made it I grilled the salmon, which meant that I didn't follow the instructions, I just mixed up the ingredients, placed the salmon in foil, poured the marinade over the fillets and grilled them till the were done.  It was wonderful.  BUT, following the recipe as written is much, much better, make it exactly as stated and you will have rave reviews.  My hubby says that this is his all time favorite way to have salmon.  Perfect for company, restaurant quality UMMMMM! Thanks Debokc

Too sweet for my taste.  It needed something tangy to round out the flavor, I think.  But it was good to try.  I think I'd try a little citrus if I try it again.

I love salmon but this sauce did not cut it for me.  My BF and I both agreed that it was edible but nothing more than that.  Sorry but I would recommend a lot of other salmon recipes on allrecipes.com besides this one.  Thanks anyways!

The brown sugar and butter give the salmon a thick molasses like syrup that is sweet to the taste buds. Once you move past those indulgent flavors the bourbon settles in giving the meal a warm southern kick.

Succulent, scrumptious,with mouthwatering flavor.  I followed the recipe as submitted except I used light brown sugar.  It was 103 degrees today so this was a great way to have a fabulous meal without using the oven.

This is an interesting recipe, but it is too sweet. I used 2 tbs brown sugar (I had only 4 salmon pieces) and 3 tbs soy sauce and the salmon still was sweet. The bourbon flavor was a little overpowering.

This recipe is awesome. Gourmet tasting. I didn't have any Bourbon in the house but I did have Brandy. I followed the recipe as it was listed and it was a little sweet. Probably because of the brandy. So, at the end of cooking I added some soysauce to it to counteract the sweetness and it made a wonderful combination. Remember this is only due to the use of the brandy versus bourbon.  Fantastic and thank you.

This recipe is fantastic as-is!  I've made it several times with great results, and it's now a favorite of ours.  For variation, try using Amaretto (like Disaronno) instead of the bourbon - it's yummy served on a spring mix salad with pecans.

I tried this recipe. It turned out great and I liked it, however, my family gave it a thumbs down and said to never make it again. While I liked it, I have had better prepared salmon and only planned to make it again if everyone liked it. There is nothing wrong with the recipe itself, just not to our taste

Wonderful!  I added fresh minced garlic, but otherwise made it just as the recipe stated.  My husband is temporarily on a completely salt-free diet for medical reasons, and it's nearly impossible to find decent recipes that don't call for salt.  I did add salt to mine at the table, but it was great even without it.  I'll make this again!

Yummy! Patted the salmon with salmon before placing in the heated butter. Cooked one side of the salmon, when I flipped it, I poured the bourbon on the salmon.

this was great! i took other reviewers' advice and let the salmon soak in the bourbon/brown sugar mixture for 3O minutes first and poured it over the fish in the pan after turning. i kept my flame on low and it turned out terrific. i also let the glaze thicken before serving. thanks!

This was a good recipe. I enjoyed it very much and it was easy to make. I didn't have dark brown sugar so I added a 1/4 tablespoon vanilla extract to light brown sugar. I don't usually saute salmon, only bake it, so I wasn't sure when it was done. Be careful not to over cook it!

i had the same problems as some others who tried this.  the sauce burnt on my stove's "med-low" setting.  it didnt have a whole lot of flavor (not a shock since there's no salt or pepper).  this one didn't work for us.

This was a bit too sweet for my taste.  It overpowered the salmon. It may be better if done with chicken. I will try that next.

This was really lack luster how I prepared it.  I used half the amount of butter and brown sugar.....mistake I guess since it was really plain tasting.  I wanted to avoid the "hard candy" effect that some reviewers mentioned, I ended up with a blah dish.  May or may not try again.

I followed the recipe exactly and got mixed reviews.  My husband and I thought it just okay - the glaze tasted basically like maple syrup, barely a hint of the bourbon.  On the up side, my two boys (ages 1 and 3) LOVED it.

My husband loved this recipe.  He said it looked pretty enough to be in a magazine.  You have to serve it with rice.  Remember with this recipe...low and slow.  Soak your pan in hot water and you'll have no problem getting the glaze out of your pan.

This wasn't that great for us... but it did cook without any problems so it has at least taught me that I can indeed cook fish! I think we just didn't like the sweet brown sugar with the fish.

I used salmon filets, but it still turned out well.  It took a little longer to cook.  The glaze is very messy, so be prepared to clean up immediately.

excellent dish.  the only problem i had was that the sauce got a little burned.  i think i needed smaller fillets than what i used to shorten the cook time.  extremely quick and easy recipe.

This was very tasty, but I wasn't sure whether to take the skin off the salmon or not.  I went ahead and peeled it off.  I overcooked it a bit, but that was my fault.  All in all it tasted wonderful.  The bourbon wasn't overpowering but gave it a great flavor.

This was an ok dish.  When other reviewers said to watch the temperature, they meant it.  Once the brown sugar is even slightly burnt, the sauce is not as good.

10/24/19 - very good and easy, Steve gave it give stars! 
 12/22/2004 - Very easy and very good!  The sauce was a little sweet for my tastes but my then-husband loved it and said I definitely have to make it again!

It was ok.  Nothing too special.  I added some toasted pecans which was nice, but I probably wont make it again.

Very easy and fast to make. A sweet taste on the fish is a little weird, but not bad at all. It was a hit with my family.
I decided that butter will be too rich, so I substituted with equal amount of Brummel & Brown spread. That added a little salt and a lot of liquid to the mixture - more than it would have been with the butter.Because of that my glaze was a little too thin. Next time I'll use less spread and more bourbon, and possibly a little seasoned salt.

I love salmon but this recipe was not very good to me or my family.  I don't know what exactly it was that didn't work out for me, but I won't be making this again.  However, it is easy to make.

Simple, delicious and finally what  I’ve been trying to replicate what was served to me in favorite restaurants. I used the same recipe with diver scallops and added a little Fresh lemon and what a simple elegant dinner served with tricolor tortellini and grilled veggies.  Finger licking delicious my husband said it tasted just like the restaurant salmon that we frequently order.

I was a little nervous making this as I am new to cooking but knew sugar burns super easily. The best advice if new to cooking with sugar like this is to stir it the whole time until you put the fish in. This way it doesn’t stay in the same spot and doesn’t burn the sugar. The dinner turned out great and will be doing this again.

This was great, not too sweet.  I did adjust all ingredients to about 1/2 since I only had one salmon steak that was about 10 ounces.  Will make again but make the larger amount of sauce.  Sooo good.

It was quick and easy to prepare. I would make it again, but it was  little sweet for my taste. I would probably add some soy sauce or some miso to make it a little more savory.

Great recipe; I see people buying same type recipe already prepared, but that is just not me.  I’ve made it often and I haven’t changed a thing (well sometimes if I don’t have bourbon, I’ll use Jack Daniels).

Delicious. Didnt make any changes.... but once when I made it  the sauce was like candy... thick and chewy.  Probably something I did wrong. Made it about 3 times and everyone REALLY loves it.
I usually marinate salmon in just a little MILK for an hour or so before. Keeps the salmon moist and juicy inside.

We both thought that the sauce was too sweet. If I made it again, I would add something in or cut the brown sugar down to at least 1/3 c.

Letting the sauce thicken more might've also helped. With such a short cooking time, the sauce was still pretty thin. Next time I would remove the salmon and continue cooking the sauce.

Definitely a keeper!  I'm always looking for alternatives and tried this.  Everyone loved it - esp. my 12yo who loved the idea of "alcohol" (oh, my!) in his dinner.  Good flavor, quickly prepared.  Thanks!

Great change of pace. Very sweet. May use less sugar next time. Watch out when you add the bourbon!

It was good but thought very sweet and had hard time to make sure sugar did not burn while cooking. Will make it again with a few changes.

Husband liked it OK but I thought it was awful. Too sweet and the suace way overpowered the salmon flavor. I am taking this out of my salmon collection. What a waste of yummy stuff.

I found this a little sweet for the fillet piece of salmon I had.  Using a thick piece of fish it would be better.  I tried to use the grill instead of in a pan which was messier but still worked using a Cuhicinia sheet.  Really moist! I would try again using a tin foil "boat".

I don't like fish to say the least. This is really good. Used fourty creek for bourbon/whiskey. Amazing. Added lime and cilantro to the rice once as well as mango another time and it pairs we'll with either.

Great recipe, simple, and fast. A couple things I changed/added:

(1) Rubbing brown sugar into the fish adds a lot of flavor. No need to wait for the sugar to soak in or anything.

(2) I used a Canadian whiskey instead of bourbon, which gave it a slightly maple syrup taste (it was great!)

(3) After cooking, I sprinkled some salt on the fish. This gave it a nice contrasting flavor, as opposed to just sweetness from the sugar and whiskey.

i made it according to the recipe.  It turned out great and will make it again.  I was hoping the sugar would put a crust on the salmon.  It did not but the taste was amazing.  Please be careful adding the alcohol as it nearly flamed our kitchen.

I only cooked two salmon filets but followed the recipe exactly.  I liked the extra sauce which I spooned over the filets after serving them on top of asparagus.  The flavor is outstanding, cook time (10 minutes) perfect.  What an easy recipe.  Will definitely make this again.

My entire family loved this!!!  Do you have any idea how hard it is to please 6 different people with 6 different tastes???  lol  I did use Apricot Brandy instead of the Bourbon simply because it was what I had on hand.  This was crazy easy to make and I will definitely add it to my rotation of recipes.

I made this tonight exactly like the recipe, no changes, unless you count Canadian Whiskey rather than bourbon, but since I don't know the difference that didn't matter.  I melted the butter and actually let it brown since I have had browned butter over salmon and know that it gives the salmon a very good flavor.  I then added the brown sugar, to the skillet, stirred until it was melted into the butter then put the salmon on top.  After about 4 min I added the whiskey and stirred it in. I was afraid I was going to end up with a brittle, crunchy mass rather than a sauce, but I didn't have a problem.  I turned the salmon over, cooked for a few more mins and served over wild rice.  I put a bit more sauce over the meat also.  I served roasted garlic asparagus as a side dish and a green salad.  The sauce was sweeter than I like with salmon, so I think the next time I make it I will cut back on the sugar, may or may not add a touch of citrus juice or soy sauce, but not much. I have had many of the restaurants versions of bourbon salmon and have always liked them, but they are not quite as sweet.

I did have to taste the leftover caramel sauce, just could not resist.  I think I will have to try making that and pouring it over a cake of some type (salmon-less of course).  I think the sauce on it's own is yummy, just a bit too sweet for the main course.

I didn't have any bourbon so I used coconut flavored rum. Also used light brown sugar. Made extra sauce. Husband loved it.

I made this and added soy sauce and garlic as another suggested. My husband all the while thinking it was going on the grill. When I told him it wasn't we put it in a container to marinate overnight. Put it on the grill in tinfoil the next day and this was OUR best meal yet with salmon. I don't usually like sweet but the soy sauce and garlic clove made it superb. I beg you to try this recipe as you won't regret it.

This was excellent.  Recipe is similar to others I've tried using brown sugar or molasses.  Only difference was I used dark rum because I didn't have bourbon.

I made this recipe following the directions, including serving it with brown rice and asparagus. Simply delicious and definitely a recipe which will be made many times. 
I buy Scottish Salmon, and this glaze enhances its flavor. The brow rice is perfect with the sauce drizzled over it.

Great recipe, the sauce is very sweet. I reduced it down trying to thicken and ended with a very nice Carmel by a little too much reduction! The salmon had great flavor and was well cooked by the 10 minutes recommended.  I would suggest only 8 mnutes.

I make this frequently and it works well on stove top but do be careful not to burn the glaze. Another option that is wonderful is to place the glaze with the bourbon or whiskey mixed in into a foil tent. Place the salmon in the foil and spoon the glaze over. Grill on medium heat for about 5 minutes. Amazing!

Wow!  This is so easy to make and quick, too.  I cut the recipe in half because I only cooked one large salmon steak.  It weighed a little less than a pound.  When I put it in the skillet, I put the skin side up first, then turned it over to complete the cooking time.  It was very tender and delicious.

Used AL foil to bake and as described skin side down.  Added a squeeze or two of fresh lemon.  Mustard of choice was honey-mustard.  Have made this now 4-5 times in the last 3 months.

I only had light brown sugar so added a little molasses. Really liked the additional molasses and will add a little regardless of what kind of brown sugar I have on hand. 

Cooking time of the salmon needs to be adjusted for thickness of your fish. 5 minutes is too long for the salmon pieces I had.

This sauce would be good by itself on ice cream!

this was a good recipe, Ive made it three times. but.... the first time it was too sweet with the Brown sugar.  second time I cut the sugar to half, but the bourbon flavor was too strong.   the third tie I used the recipe as is, but only very lightly brushed it on, and baked it for 20 min til it was fork-tender.  just right!!

Made this with choice salmon my husband caught.  Big mistake.  Medium heat as called for in the recipe is too much heat.  The sugar and butter burned to a nasty sticky muck.  Won't make this again .

Made this tonite as written and it was OK - but won't make again. Too sweet for us - reminded me of maple syrup on salmon. Glad we tried it so thank you for sharing the recipe - just too sweet for me.  We didn't use the extra sauce on our rice just kept it plain steamed white to cut the sweetness.

I really wanted to like this, as I wanted another recipe for salmon besides my usual.  We ate it but did not enjoy at all.  Hubby said not to save this recipe.  Sorry, but it was a waste of good salmon and really good bourbon!!  An expensive bad experiment.

This was a really good recipe. I might cut back on the butter next time as it seemed too much for the salmon we had. This is very easy to make in a cast iron skillet and tastes great.

I've been making a version of this recipe for 10 years that adds soy sauce to the mixture.  I mix 2 parts brown sugar, 2 parts bourbon, 1 part soy sauce and stir to dissolve the sugar. Then marinate the salmon for at least an hour before cooking.  Then I bake this -- skin side up in the marinade -- at 425 degrees for about 10 min or til fish flakes and sauce starts to boil.  The soy sauce seems to keep the sugar from burning.  You can also add one part vegetable oil to the marinade to help prevent burning or if in case you want to grill the fish instead.  The sauce is quite good over rice but I usually serve this with roasted sweet potatoes and drizzle the sauce over that.

I've made this recipe several times and it is one of my favorite ways to make Salmon.  I do however, use an iron skillet.  I've never experienced burnt sugar and always have a wonderful glaze for the salmon.

I make salmon at least once a week only instead of bourbon I  marinate salmon in 1/2 cup of soy sauc e  1/4 c of rice vinager 2 tbs dry mustard while I prepare rmy rice and veggies.   10 minutes begire dinner is served sear fish in cast iron skillet , sprinkle brown sugar on top as it cooks, then sprinkle on reverse side when flipped over. About 5 minutes on each side. Just as tasty and half the work on a busy week night.  Both are delicious!

I've made a version like this for years.
Short version:
Take your  favorite b-b-q sauce and add the brown sugar to it and make a paste with a splash of your favorite bourbon.  Baste the fish with all the sauce and sprinkle finely chopped pecans on top. 
Bake at 350 until the fish is done and the coating is caramelizing.

Awesome! Superb! This is so simple, and so delicious that words just can't do it justice.  I only used 2 skinless salmon filets and kept the measured amounts for the butter/sugar & bourbon to the recipe.  Husband just loved it!  It will be a staple recipe here for salmon!

Personally, I hate salmon. My husband does too, but his cholesterol was very high and I wanted to try something healthy. After much to do, I finally got him to try a bite and then two bites and then he either secretly liked it or got used to it, but it disappeared. I thought it was good, so an overall success story, Thanks.

I have made this many times and it is always a winner. I do it on real charcoal with indirect heat to give it a smokey flavor. I add pecans and have even splashed a bit of orange juice . The best trick when grilling is to mix the marinade, drizzle it on then take the unused portion to the stove and reduce to a glaze which I serve at the table. Everyone raves even those who don't like salmon!
Thanks for an amazing recipe!!!

This would have been 5 stars for the flavor but the sauce turned into a chewy caramel and couldn't be eaten with the salmon.

This. Was. Awesome.  I made several of the tweaks suggested in the comments: 1) added approx 1T of minced garlic 2) 2T of soy sauce 3) 1/4 c chopped pecans and a couple of my own: 4) 2T red pepper flakes after I rinsed, patted dry and sprinkled salt/ pepper onto the filets.  This is absolutely added to my “regular rotation” of recipes now - in fact, I think I’ll be making this with chicken thighs later this week!  I’ll serve it with rice to make sure I don’t waste a bit of the sauce.  Might even try adding a hint of Chinese 5 spice too....

I thought it was great - prepared it substituting some scotch for the bourbon, and added a quarter cup of soy sauce. I'd strongly recommend the soy sauce, I think the dish would have been too sweet for me without it. Would go great with rice, this is how I'll serve it next time.

Yum! I added the soy sauce and garlic mentioned in other reviews. I had no problems with burning, just do not use high heat. I will make this again!

Every time I ask my daughter what she wants for dinner for the past few years, it's always this, tilapia or chicken n dumplings. This recipe has been so made dozens of times by me. I highly recommend!

Cool recipe but definitely wouldn't recommend cooking your salmon on medium heat with a gas burner. Burned all the sugar which made it taste like burnt everything

Excellent. Made as directed, full sauce, only two fillets (Serving Two). Took someone's suggestion of moving the salmon around the pan slightly while cooking to prevent it from sticking.

I had high expectations from this recipe so I was very disappointed when I found it to be too sweet and strongly bourbon flavored. Seeing the glowing reviews, I think it might have something to do with my use of sugar free syrup rather than the brown sugar called for in this recipe (a certain someone cannot have sugar). Or could it be my cooking skills?

This had such a wonderful flavor!  The only reason I couldn't give it a 5 star rating is because the glaze never thickened up.  I left it simmering in the pan for a few extra minutes after taking the salmon out, but it was still very watery.  I will probably make again if I can think of a way to tweak it.

I used 1 1/2 " thick center-cut salmon steaks for this, and even over a low flame, the sugar burned before the fish was done. Lots of smoke, a big mess, inedible (expensive!) fish. Oh well.

Highly recommend!!!!I was on terrible streak of messing up recipes, and this brought me back  YESSSS!!!!!  The first time I made it I did slightly burn the butter, but that was totally my fault. The next time it was perfect and beyond delicious. We all loved it, even my daughter who is not so easy to impress. She asked for more the following day. 

Since I've purchased or drank bourbon in my life I subbed the bourbon with a half soy sauce half mirin mixture. It was perfect!

Not bad. I threw around the ingredient amounts since I was only cooking one salmon steak, and I used Disaronno since I didn't have any bourbon on-hand. I think I would have liked to marinate the salmon in something first, because the brown sugar glaze flavor really didn't penetrate the surface of the fish.

This was the best, easiest salmon recipe ever. I made a few changes using Splenda brown sugar to reduce the carbs, and added 2 tablespoons of light soy sauce. The soy sauce added a nice amount of salt. I like Scottish salmon and Jim Beam Bourbon. Family loved it, including the cat who got a bit of the skin!

The sauce/glaze was way too heavy for my tastes - it overpowered everything.  The sauce was very tasty with the rice, but we ended up enjoying the pieces of fish that had the least amount of sauce on them and the least saturated.  I think if we make this again, we'll decrease the sauce, maybe thin it out, etc.
