This recipe is always a hit with my family and friends.  I make it without the MSG and onion salt.  I always double this recipe, because it's never enough, use 2 green onions, 1 1/2 Tblsp. Worchesteshire sauce and the "family size" pack of dried beef.  Reserve a little of the beef to roll the ball in...it makes a pretty presentation.

Great with wheat crackers!

Yummmm! This is my husband'd favorite year after year. It'a always the first one gone. This is such good stuff for such an easy recipe to do. The directions don't say it but that you have to rinse the salt from the beef first and then chop the beef into tiny pieces. I reserved some of the chopped dried beef to roll the finished balls in. Great with veggie sticks, Wheat Thins Big crackers and Triscuit crackers. I made two smaller cheese balls. A keeper ... great meat and cheese ball recipe!

This is the worst recipe I have ever tried! It sounded great & I made it for an OFFICE TEA-it was so bad that everyone threw it out!I knew it didn't taste good to me, but it was to late to do anything but take it-I would not recommend anyone trying this, you will be wasting Cream Cheese & Dried Beef.

Very quick and easy recipe.  Delicious.  I did leave out monosodium glutamate and used onion powder instead of onion salt.  I received tons of compliments on this cheese ball!

This is a wonderful cheeseball!  Exactly what I was looking for, and it was a huge hit at my best friend's bridal shower.  I added about a teaspoon of horseradish for a little extra bite.

I've used a similar recipe for years. I use 2 pkg. cream cheese to dried beef, green onion to taste and worchestershire sauce.  NO salt or MSG is needed.

Great recipe, but if you value the health of your brain PLEASE omit the MSG! It is a neuro-toxin/exito-toxin that you should avoid at all cost! Do some research!

I've been making this recipe for years and its ALWAYS  a hit!  I substitute a few drops of pepper sauce for the worceshire.  I see the note about washing the beef and I don't agree with that.  Use it as it is.  I'm pretty salt sensitive yet it seems just fine.  I don't use the msg either.  This is one of the easiest recipes!

Very good! I have made this for years and my friends and family LOVE IT!  Doesn't last 30 minutes at my house. I add a little extra worcestershire sauce and seasoning salt. Leave out MSG!

This is a very good simple cheese ball.  Please DO NOT use MSG.  It does nothing to enhance the food and some people are sensitive to it.

Great tasting cheese ball.  Maybe the person who gave this a bad rating had used not so good cream cheese.  I personally like to use the very thin sliced chipped beef or ham(both are good) cut into very small squares and soaked in worchestershire sauce.  I also roll the ball in the same beef or ham. Everyone loves it!

RINSE THE BEEF!  If you use the real DRIED BEEF, rather than the cheaper smoked beef, it is very salty. I ruined a double batch by not rinsing.  It was just to terribly salty.  Headed back to store for more beef and rinsed it.  Ahhh, success.  I don't use MSG.  I did pick up some horseradish the 2nd trip to the grocery store and added a bit.  Emmm, good.  The green onions are a must.  They add nice color and a bit of sweetness.  I use all of the onion, white and green.  This is so addictive.  I've had before but never made.  At work there was a carry-in for Easter and I could have sat down with a spoon and consumed the whole thing.  I asked for the basic receipe, stopped at the store and then checked out allrecipes.com.  This is a winner!

RINSE THE BEEF!  If you use the real DRIED BEEF, rather than the cheaper smoked beef, it is very salty. I ruined a double batch by not rinsing.  It was just to terribly salty.  Headed back to store for more beef and rinsed it.  Ahhh, success.  I don't use MSG.  I did pick up some horseradish the 2nd trip to the grocery store and added a bit.  Emmm, good.  The green onions are a must.  They add nice color and a bit of sweetness.  I use all of the onion, white and green.  This is so addictive.  I've had before but never made.  At work there was a carry-in for Easter and I could have sat down with a spoon and consumed the whole thing.  I asked for the basic receipe, stopped at the store and then checked out allrecipes.com.  This is a winner!

This cheese ball is always a hit.  I use red onions instead of green. I add a little bit of horseradish and do not use monododium glutamate. I also use a little extra Worcestershire sauce.

This cheese ball is always a favorate!  It is also dorm/small kitchen friendly.   But... I do change a little bit, instead of onion salt, I use garlic powder since there is a lot of saly in the dried chip beef.  I don't use the glutamate... and to make the pieces nice and small to more evenly mix I put them in a small food processor.

My mother has made something like this before.  I changed it up a bit, by taking out the msg and onion salt, and added shredded italian cheese, garlic powder and italian seasoning.

Have made this recipe (without the MSG) for years and it's always a huge hit!  I also substitute garlic powder for the onion salt as there's plenty of salt in the beef.

This is a hit at all my get togethers.  I leave out the MSG, and I too, rinse the beef before chopping it.  Instead of making a "ball" out of it, I shape it into a small loaf. Serve with wheat thins, because they aren't very salty.

This has become a holiday tradition for us!  My husband loves this cheese ball and drools over the idea of having it at Christmas. :)  I don't use the MSG.  I do shape it into a ball and roll in chopped pecans.  Delicious!!!

If you like dried beef, you'll LOVE this cheese ball.  It is a little salty though.  The next time, I think I'll try washing the dried beef before I chop it or maybe buy the lower sodium dried beef.  Also, I added 1/4 tsp. onion powder instead of onion salt.  This recipe does not need any added salt of any kind!  I also added 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder for added flavor.  My daughter and I love this dip and will definitely make it again!!

Awesome!I tripled and froze two for those treat days at work that sneak up on you. Omitted green onion and msg, and used onion powder in stead of onion salt, as I find it's salty enough. Rolled in finely chopped walnuts. Co-workers snarfed this down!

I looked this recipe up because I had lost my original recipe. I'm using this on Christmas Eve - minus the MSG. After reading the reviews, I wanted to state that I am not a salt lover. I will not be adding the salt or MSG, and I ALWAYS rinse the dried beef before adding. Always turns out perfect for me this way. If you want to get extra randy with it...substitute the Worcestershire sauce for Tobasco or Texas Pete. Thanks for posting this recipe! I feared the husband would be going without this year. :)

This is a great cheese ball.  I too use onion powder instead of salt and leave out the MSG...it's just not necessary.  Great with buttery round crackers!

I took others recommendations and didn't add the salt. I don't think I nor anyone else could have eaten this with any extra salt, and I eat more salt than anyone I've ever eaten with. I would suggest onion powder if you want the extra onion flavor.  Also, I din't add the MSG, and it was delicious!

I've been using this same recipe for years.  It's always a hit at gatherings.  I don't use the monosodium glutanate, and sometimes I add a little garlic salt instead of onion salt. Either way, it's very good.

If you expect to eat this, you MUST rinse the salt from the meat.  The recipe overall is excellent though (i don't use MSG either), even if you forget to rinse and rinse and rinse and rinse.....

Very tasty!  I subtracted the MSG and used beef jerky. I subbed onion powder for onion salt.  Figured the salt in the jerky would be plenty.  Also molded the mixture into a ball and rolled in a 1/2 cup of pecans.  Makes for a nice presentation and mild nutty flavor.

Exellent cheeseball! So tasty, so easy to do, and with ingredients that are so easy to find in the grocery store! This tastes better as each day goes by! I surrounded it with Ritz crackers, and it was a hit! I did however, omit the MSG.If you are looking for an all-around, classic cheeseball that is easy to make, and easy to transport, this is it! Even people who normally don't like cream cheese or drief beef loved this! A keeper!r

Even people who normally don't like cream cheese or drief beef loved this! A keeper!r

This is the one Grandma used to make!!!  My Mom was quite pleased when she took her first bite.  Brought back some memories for her too!  I left out the MSG and of course...HAD to make a double batch (which still wasn't enough)!  YUMMY!!!

I have been using this recipe for over 20 years.  Mine is a little different. I do not use the MSG why would you?  I use 1 tsp. garlic salt and use a small minced onion and put 3 tablespoons of sour cream into the mixture.  Then I cut little squares of dried beef and cover the outside to make it prettier.

This is DELICIOUS.  Maybe the best guy dip in the world. Make it next time you have a group of XYs sitting around your television. A friend made this and I nearly didn't taste it. Once I did, I couldn't leave it alone!  NO ONE EVER NEEDS TO CONSUME MSG and this recipe doesn't need it for any reason.  It's yummy.  Culinary crack cocaine.

This is our favorite cheeseball recipe!  Whenever the family says they're making cheeseball, this is always the one that has been made from as far back as I can remember.  Ive made others but this always seems to be the classic that you can't go without.  I dont use the msg.  It just depends, but sometimes the amounts of the green onions and worchestershire sauce are upped :)  We always roll the outside in more chipped beef.  Great cheeseball served with veggies and crackers!

Great recipe, but I used more green onions and omitted the monosodium glutamate.  I would let the cheese ball sit overnight so the flavors meld.

After reading some other reviews complaining about salt I had to wonder if there may be different kinds of dried beef.  The meat we get here from the deli section of our "amish" market is not extrememly salty and when mixed with the bland cream cheese is in no way overpoweringly salty.  I do not make it with MSG but do like the Worcestershire sauce for the flavor it adds-I would recommend less than doubling the amount though if you're using 2 blocks of cream cheese.  I also have omitted the onion salt on occasion and haven't missed it with the nice fresh flavor of the green onion.  Our family really enjoys this-- my mother-in-law always puts butter in hers which makes it less dense so it spreads easily but won't make a ball well.  Enjoy this yummy snack!!

I was happy to find this recipe on this web site!!!

We made a couple of changes...  
Omitted the MSG
Didn't add the dried beef (couldn't find it at the local grocery)
Put it in a bowl instead of forming into a ball

It had good flavor but its very important to use the right products. First, onion salt is absolutely horrible but when switched to onion powder its fine. Also its very important to have good dried beef, if your getting the salty kind in the jar or plastic pkg then it will be a salty dish, I'd suggest trying to locate a good brand or even better, made from a smokehouse or deli.

This is a good, basic recipe that my mom used to make for Christmas Eve snacking.  We usually skip the onion salt and MSG and just use 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt.  She would cover the ball in another few ounces of dried beef so it would travel well.

I could not eat it as it is written. I wish I had read the reviews first, it was way too salty with the Worcestershire sauce, MSG, and onion salt (all of these ingredients are very salty). I am working on altering what I made with additional cream cheese in the hopes of cutting the salt so that I can serve it today. If not, I will have to start from scratch. 
   I will make this again, but without the above ingredients as others have suggested. I just wish they had not altered it and then given it five stars. I believed the stars and made it as written. Don't make my mistake!

My husband just LOVES this cheese ball! We follow the recipe exactly, except for the green onion (he really hates those), and we use a bit more dried beef than called for, and we don't find it too salty at all.

I usually add some minced garlic about a teaspoonful or maybe a little more and since I am allergic t Worcestershire sauce I leave it out.

The is the only cheese ball I will eat  Do not put the MSG or the Onion salt in it. It makes it way too salty.  To have enough you will want to double the recipe.

Actually made this twice this weekend for 2 different events, haha. Only changes I made were I used a little onion powder and garlic powder in place of the onion salt, and halved the MSG- it was a big hit! First batch I covered it in dried beef, second round I didn't have enough left so I covered it in extra scallions. It was super easy and very yummy, I will definitely make it again in the future.

I used dried beef(in a jar) and thought this was salty. I think next time I’ll substitute the onion salt for onion powder.

This cheese ball is delicious! It is a little bit salty, but that is actually part of what makes it taste so good. I omit the MSG and use seasoned salt instead of onion salt. I use 3 green onions (just the green part, chopped very fine) and a 2.25 oz jar of name brand dried beef, also chopped fine. It is a mess to mix with your fingers, so I mix it by cutting the ingredients together using two butter knives. I use plastic wrap to make it into a ball and roll it in about 1/5 of the chopped beef that I have saved and not mixed in. I wrap it in a new piece of plastic wrap and store it in the fridge on the plate I plan to serve it on. I serve it with Toasted crackers.  It does not fail to be devoured!

This is a very a salty recipe.  If you don't like salty foods, I would avoid this.  Since, I can't take MSG anymore, I used seasoned salt instead.  I liked it.  It has potential for more flavor.  Overall, it was a good recipe.  I will try some of the other suggestions to see how those variations go.

I used the first three ingredients and accent (excluded the last three ingredients). The taste came out great. Everyone loves it. A friend of mine adds a Hidden Valley ranch packet to hers and it tastes the same. Hope this helps if anyone would want to try it again.  To me Accent is a flavor enhancer. you can use a little at a time until your taste buds reach your desired flavor. I also like to spread it on buttery town house crackers.

This could've been so good if I'd listened to other reviewers and rinsed the salt off the dried beef! But no, alas, I did not listen and served a salty ball of salt to my guests. And I didn't happen to have MSG on hand,  shocking I know, so didn't add it. Also, I used onion powder in place of onion salt. I will make this again, because the base flavor was yummy, but I will definitely rinse the beef. And add a little dijon mustard. If not for the crazy saltiness, I would've given this 5 stars.

I've been making this cheese ball for years and my whole family loves it.  I do not use the onion powder.  I do use Accent.  I have tasted others that omitted the Accent and it changes the whole taste!  Do not omit the Accent!  It makes it wayyyyy better!  I sometimes change it up and use chopped ham too.  I also use a little chopped sweet onion along with the green onion too.  I will be making this cheese ball forever.

I was looking for a slightly different recipe when I came across this one. I made it as directed (x2) and it was very good, but not exactly what I was after. I ended up adding some garlic powder, Lawry's, and an extra cream cheese to thin out the onion ratio a little.

Using the amount of dried beef in the recipe was way too much and too salty. Substituting a 2oz package of Buddig beef was  perfect and not at all too salty.

I have made this cheese ball for years & everyone loves it!! I do half the MSG/accent. Seems way to salty if you add what this recipe calls for.
