My family LOVED it!  I didn't have self rising flour so used regular flour and a teas. of baking powder.  I didn't put in nutmeg.  I added vanilla.  I was worried about it being too sweet, but it was perfect.  I served it w/ vanilla bean ice cream.  WONDERFUL!

I made this for my family, and made no changes to the recipe.  It was a winner!  We loved the crusty top. Serve warm with fresh whipping cream or vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Way too sweet.  I made this using 1/2 cup sugar in the batter, 1 tablespoon in the peaches and 1 tablespoon sprinkled on top.  It had the perfect sweetness and I could actually taste the peaches.

This was great! I ended up using 2 15 oz cans of peaches. And I was worried that it wouldnt all fit into the 8x8 pan. But it fit perfect and turned out yummy. I would also next time sprinkle brown sugar on top instead of white sugar.

This was really delicious!  I took the advice of another poster and reduced the amount of sugar, and since I only had 29 oz. cans of peaches and a 9x9 pan instead of 8x8 I ended up using most of the peaches from the larger can in order to have enough fruit in the cobbler.  Not sure how it would be fruity enough with only a 15 oz can!!!  I also sprinkled brown sugar on top instead of white sugar because I thought it would look prettier that way - So yummy!

This is the same recipe that my Grandma makes for peach cobbler, and the one I still use. Grandma always used a cast iron skillet, her own peaches that she canned herself and she would wisk a tablespoon or so of cornstarch to the peach "juices" in the saucepan before she added the peaches and sugar. At the last, before she put the cobbler into the oven, she'd sprinkle a little sugar over the top. To this day, it's one of my most favorite desserts. I've tried to make this in a baking dish or pan and it just dosen't taste as good as it does when it's been cooked in a cast iron skillet, to me anyway. To really take it over the top, try this with cold vanilla bean ice cream!

I have tried this recipe three times and each time my family loved it. The only changes that I made was, instead of putting two tablespoons of sugar on top, I only put one and I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top also. This recipe is a keeper and I will continue to make it in the future.

Very good, my husband loved it ! A little  sweet for me so I cut out the sugar sprinkled on top half way thru baking. Also I did not have self rising flour so this one time I used Bisquik. The recipe went into my "keeper" file.

Best Peach Cobbler recipe I have had.  I love Peach Cobbler and have tried tens of recipes that aren't nearly as good as this one.  It is so simple too!  I love the warm chewiness of this cobbler.  It is starting to become a signature dish of mine and I am getting requests to make it now.  :)
I cut the sugar in half and omitted the sugar in the peaches and also on top of the cobbler as it cooked.  It was totally not necessary.  I also used all purpose flour and added 1 1/4 tsp of baking powder to the batter.

We tried this for 30 people and not sure why, but it didn't work at all.  Was very dissapointed.  Could be how the numbers changed in the conversion!?

This had great flavor--however, the texture of the dough was like rubber. i was embarrassed to take it to the office so i made banana pudding instead. I ate one serving of this cobbler and this is NOT the cobbler recipe for me.

This is the only way my mom ever made any fruit cobbler. Years ago when she made it we knew we were going to get homemade ice cream and were so excited we could hardly wait. Its the only way to eat this cobbler is with ice cream. Nowadays I eat it with Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla. Its great if you ever start making it like this you will never go to any other.

Oh! My! not good...not sure what happened, but it came out sooooo dry.  I was so embarrassed when my client called and told me that they were very unsatisfied with it.  She said it was more like a bread pudding than a cobbler.  I thought they are suppose to be a little juicy "she said" well I will not be doing this one anymore. One good thing about it, it smelled so good baking.  Well, off to hunting again.  Sorry :-(

I did not really care for this cobbler.  I think by melting the butter in the baking dish before putting in the other things, the end result was a cobbler with a greasy oily bottom crust.  I will keep looking for the right cobbler recipe.

This tasted pretty good but looked sloppy. Was way to sweet. Made it for company and they liked it but I don't think I'll be making this again.

yes this recipe has been around for MANY years. It is very good. I never add the extra sugar to the top because it makes it a little too sweet for my taste.

Hmmmm....very good.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the sugar on top....Instead of all white sugar, I combined 1 tbsp brown sugar with 1 tbsp white sugar.  Yes, it is sweet, but that's the way I like it. I'm sure I'll be making this one again :-).

It was so good!!! I did make a few changes though. I didnt use as much sugar. I used less then a full cup in the mixture and then did 1T on the top and sprinkled cinnamon on top. I also threw some blueberries in with the peaches which made this AWESOME the blue berries made it not SO sweet and added just a little tart. It was wonderful with vanilla icecream!

This was rich and flavorful. Perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I only had a 29 oz can of peaches and just used them all. This was great but the pan was really full and I had to use a piece of foil beneath to protect the drips. Yes some butter did spill over during baking. Thanks this was fabulous!

I made this, and took everyone else's changes into consideration, except the ones that thought it was too sweet. I LOVE sweet and sugary. When I boiled the peaches, I added 1/8 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/8 cup of brown sugar. Also, when it came time to sprinkle the sugar on top at the end, I added 1/8 cup of brown sugar to the white sugar. This, by far, was the best peach cobbler ever! My kids really loved it too!

Apparently I did something terribly wrong, it looked great after 30 mins but when I put the sugar on top and placed it back in the oven after 20 mins it started to burn. It was so hard once I removed it from the oven that it was inedible :(.

I am sure this is very yummy. I must have done something wrong because mine turned out to be like sweet bread with peaches laying on top. The doe soaked up all the juice. I will try it again eventually and double the peaches or 1/2 the doe.

This one deserves 10 stars!  A friend who was home sick for Texas asked me to make Peach Cobbler.  For whatever reason, I had never made a Cobbler before and just assumed you needed fresh peaches which aren't available in Feb.  She said her grandmother made it with canned peaches all the time.  So, of course I turned to AR to find a recipe.  This was sooo easy to make!  I  followed the recipe exactly except I did 1 T white sugar and 1 T brown sugar when cooking the peaches as another reviewer suggested.  Well my friend loved it and in her words "It never stood a chance".  I already bought another can of peaches to make again real soon.

For some reason this didn't turn out very well for me. It wasn't bad, but I've definitely made a better cobbler before (I chose this recipe due to its simple ingredients and easy prep). I did have to make a few changes, so maybe that's why it didn't turn out so great. I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used 1 cup of all-purpose flour plus 1 tsp. of baking powder. I used 1/2 a stick of butter for the bottom of the pan and that was plenty! And I didn't have 2% milk, so I did half skim and half whole milk. Things I'd do differently are: lessen the amount of milk in the flour mixture (it ended up baking with a weird texture), add more peaches, put the peaches in first then drop the flour-milk mixture on top, and sprinkle the top with cinnamon sugar. I've had/made better, but overall it was a pretty good cobbler

I always double this recipe.  One is never enough whenever I serve it.  The only substitution I make is 1/2 cup brown sugar w/ the peaches.  We like that better.

AMAZING!!  I add extra cinnamon to help add a little extra flavor to the dough.  Seems to cut some of the sweetness from the sugar.  Also found that just doubling everything works well for a 9x13 pan.  Will continue to make this!!

I didn't try it because I am not in to peach cobbler but the person I made it for said it was delicious!  I only used 3/4 cup of sugar like some of the others and I also used a 29 ounce can of peaches.  I think the recipe calls for half that much and I don't think it's enough.

Oh Boy.  Did I mess up.  I found a 15 oz. can of peaches that were not in heavy syrup.  I tried to make up for it by adding a bit of simple syrup I had on hand and also by cutting a wee bit down on all the other ingredients the recipe called for.  What resulted was a bit disastrous.  I cooked it for the maximum time suggested (45 min.) which over-caramelized the "crust" and rendered it rubbery and essentially uneatable.  My bad.  I am going to try again because I see potential...

Sorry folks! I went back today and reviewed this recipe,making sure I followed it correctly.I've  baked my entire life,but must say,for me,this one was not great at all. It wasn't cooked in the middle-was all doughy,it burnt and stuck to the pan... and well... just a huge flop. I've never seen another peach cobbler made w canned peaches that requires more than 30 min maximum to cook.Yet this one,says to cook 30 mins,remove from oven,add the 2TB of additional sugar and then bake for 30-45 min more! And I did have to cook it longer,just so the top was anywhere near golden and the liquid gone. Not sure what we will do with the leftovers today....maybe it softened overnite.

Everyone loved this peach cobbler and it was so easy to make. I read several reviews and cut down on the sugar a little and used brown sugar for top. I will  definitely  make it again.

Very easy to make and delicious. I did use a 8x13 dish instead of an 8x8 and I simply doubled the recipie. The only thing I might change next time I make it will maybe to use 3 cans of peaches instead of the 2 I used for the double recipie.

This cobbler was very good.  I cut the sugar in the batter down to 3/4 cups.  I only had one 15 ounce can of peaches, but it didn't look like there was enough fruit for a cobbler.  I added another can of drained pears.  It turned out great!

This is a good recipe, BUT I was VERY disappointed when the end product seemed more like peach bread then peach pie. It should call for a lot more peaches!

Not what I expected.  My husbend is from the south and looked at this and didn't even want to eat it.  I will say it did have a good taste but not southern peach cobbler we are used to.

I love this easy recipe. I added just a few more peaches (like a small can with out adding any more juice) the second time and it was perfection!
