I use green apple and I soak the raisins in hot juice and drain well before adding to the salad. This is also good with sour cream with a little vanilla flavoring stirred in. My kids like this as a breakfast salad, I like it wrapped in leftover ham.

We loved this recipe!  Based on other reviews I added less cinnamon and used craisins instead of raisins.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving this year.

I made this for my 3-year old for lunch today and she said it was too "spicy", so yup, the cinnamon's a bit over-kill. Otherwise, I followed the recipe w/ the exception of using 1 c. of thinly-sliced baby carrots, toasting the walnuts, and only using 1 apple. It's a great recipe (and we love the name "Bunny Salad"), so we'll definitely make it again, but decrease the cinnamon, and maybe sub plain or Greek yogurt for vanilla, and up the celery to more than 1 stalk.

I used less than 1/2 the cinnamon and didn't care for the flavor in this combination. I would leave the cinnamon out and maybe add some pineapple tidbits.

Every child ate it!  My mother-in-law said it looked very "Food Network". :)  Also, I prepared mine the night before and had no problems with discoloration or soggy-ness.

Made for Easter Bar B-Q, had way to much left over to be happy with this recipe. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and lessened the cinnimon.

I didn't have time to grate, so I thinly sliced the baby carrots.  I also added some sunflower seeds on top.  This is a good salad.  I'll find out tomorrow if my kids like it.

It was a hit at Easter dinner! I mixed the juice, yogurt and just a couple shakes of cinnamon together and it came out yummy. I bought already shredded carrots (1- 10 oz bag) so it was quick and easy to put together. I used Gala apples for a little bite, toasted the walnuts and omitted the celery. We will be making this again for sure.

It's a solid potluck dish! You won't want to share with anyone though. ;)
Here's my style:
Plain Yogurt (+sugar to taste),
Golden Delicious Apples,
Golden Raisins,
No Celery,
Chia Seeds.

I really like cinnamon so I used the regular amount.

I never know how to rate a recipe like this. As written, it would get 0 stars, but I followed other reviewers' recommendations to drastically reduce the cinnamon, and now, it's probably my favorite carrot-raisin salad! I cut the recipe in half. I used 1/2 the cinnamon, which might still be a bit much. But I like the flavor the cinnamon lends to the carrots and apples; it just should be subtle.  I also used fat-free vanilla yogurt and omitted the walnuts since I didn't want the extra calories. Now it's a 5 star recipe.

This was very good, and easy to make.  The only change I made was to use just a small sprinkle of cinnamon, since several people said that the amount called for in the recipe was too overpowering.  I could still taste the cinnamon, but it was just the right accent the dish needed.

Just what I was looking for!  Apple added interest and flavor, celery  added a nice crunch. Substituted mayo for yogurt & lemon juice because thatâ€™s what I  had on hand.  I used baby carrots & shredded in food processor.  Easy peasy, thanks for sharing!

Very refreshing salad and the yogurt makes a delicious, not-too-sweet dressing.  I chose to omit the cinnamon.

I liked this. I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts and plain yogurt and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract instead of vanilla yogurt. I also soaked the raisins in hot juice like another reviewer suggested and halved the cinnamon as other reviewers suggested, but I might not mind a little more cinnamon. Oh I also added a little bit of fresh grated ginger.

Absolutely what I was looking for in a fruit/vegetable salad. I did just use plain low-fat yogurt as it is a staple in my pantry but sweetened only lightly to my taste with maple syrup. Sometimes I use craisins instead of raisins . Basic recipe is great as is.
