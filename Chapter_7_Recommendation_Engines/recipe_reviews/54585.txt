Oh my. I can't believe how good and how easy these were. Not for everyday but for a special treat, wow! I've been curious to try this for a long time and I'll tell you, all I did was heat a little bit of canola oil in a small saucepan, mix some bisquick with water to pancake consistency, dip two oreos in the batter, and fry them til golden while I cooked my spaghetti on the other burner. It was that simple. This is one where you don't even need to print out the recipe. I can't believe how good these taste. Sampling the two I made was just perfect also because a little of these go a long way. But I will definitely make these again for family members to try! Thanks for sharing.

These are amazing...I can not believe that these exist and I have never had them before.  The only thing I have done differently was to add a little bit of vanilla extract to the batter.  These are so amazing.  (I also had some mini snickers here and added those to the batter and fried them up....also amazing.)  Thanks for the post...delicious.

I wasn't really impressed. I don't know if I did something wrong, but they weren't tat good. The recipe and reviews looked like they would be amazing! However, They turned out incredibly soggy and mushy. It could have been since I used vegetable oil since that's all I had. I can't see how it would change it quite that drastically. I might give it a shot some other time, but we'll see.

These are fabulous! Just like the fair kind, but better because you can eat them while they are fresh!

I had been wondering how to make these ever since I had them at a restaurant in Aruba while on vacation. I added a bit of vanilla extract to the batter to sweeten it up a bit, fried them in the oil just long enough to get a light brown color, and took them right out. They turned out great, just like I had tried them before.  I'd try them next time with a chocolate sauce.

Disgusting! I followed the directions exactly. Oil was 350 on the nose and used correct oil. They were mushy. Would rather stick my oreo's in peanut butter.

These turned out really well! I halved the recipe because I just wanted to try them and they had a great taste. I did add 1 tablespoon of sugar to the batter just to sweeten it up a little and had to add a touch more water to thin it out a bit. This is not something I would make often, but it was fun to try them at home! Thanks for sharing. :)

Fun to make. Family loved them.  Real quick secrete "Freeze the cookies for 30 minutes first" they will come out perfect every time.

I haven't heard of fried cookies before, but was just at a small fair where they had twinkies and candy bars you could deep fry! Never had them...read a blog on here (love to host) about his deep fried happiness...and decided to search for recipes of deep fried recipes. Come upon this and since having all the ingredients decided what the heck! And am I EVER glad I did. They were pretty taste! A tasty snack that I could literally only have about twice a year, but they are REALLY good! Who knew? (Obviously the poster and others who have had this before ha!) Thank you so much! I'm going to try this on the hubby and kids tonight...report back later!

Toxic! And by 'toxic' I mean addictive! You don't notice that you've eaten a lot until your stomach starts to hurt. :) I used Bisquick, and I omitted the icing sugar. The cookies were plenty sweet without. I had a bit of a problem with the batter bubbling away from the cookie. Next time, I'll try letting the batter rest for a little while before I dip the cookies. Thanks, McCartney4175, I've never had these before but they're great!

This is SUCH a delicious treat...they are best hot, fresh from the deep fryer. The chocolate gets nice and soft and the cream is melted, but not too much. A million times better than any doughnut. I crave these all the time!

Very yummy when they are hot... but the next day they get soggy and cold....Still good but just not as good as they were when they were hot.
