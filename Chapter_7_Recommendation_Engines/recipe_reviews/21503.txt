My family thought this was good when cooked following the recipe.  The only thing I would change would be baking it in muffin tins so that there are more crispy edges, and adding a little bit of minced onion for flavor.  Otherwise this is a really good, really easy recipe!

There was nothing about this recipe I didn't like. It was quick and easy with a minimum of ingredients, though I did add some minced onion, dash of salt and a little pepper.  It made a wonderful salmon loaf just like my Mom used to make.  My grandkids, ages 4 through 16 loved it served with creamed peas and fried potatoes.  I will be using this recipe from now on.

I like to make individual patties with this mixture and fry them in a little butter in a skillet. I like the greater proportion of browned outsides when it is made that way.

We're trying to get more fish in our diets, so I thought I would give this a try. I added some diced onion and celery (maybe 1/4 or a 1/3 cup of each) and I used less milk so it wouldn't come out soupy. I also used crushed Ritz crackers instead of saltines. Tasty! My husband, who prefers tuna to salmon, seemed to enjoy it! Thanks so much for the recipe. :)

This recipe is wonderful!  I didn't have any saltines so I used club crackers instead and it was wonderful, in fact, they probably made it more buttery and rich...delicious!  I recommend you leave the bones and skin in the salmon, they are very soft, and you will never know you are eating them.  You can easily "smush" them up, if you want, but they are so full of calcium and protien you really should leave them in.  Also, I added chopped onions and celery for a little zest! Give this recipe a try!!!

Deeeeelicious! Reminds me of my mom's & I think it's better than a recipe I already make because cracker crumbs are used instead of bread crumbs. I did add some chopped onion----mom did that!!! A good choice for Lent, with raw fried taters and creamed corn on the side...mmmmmmm! Comfort food!

Good basic recipe; great with a little "dressing up!"  I drained, skinned and de-boned the canned salmon.  I also added onion powder, celery seasoning and lemon pepper.  I used crushed seasoned wheat crackers and saltines for the crumbs (plus I made more crumbs to sprinkle on top of the loaf!)  I also served this with dill sauce made from 1/2 c fat free mayo, 1/4 c fat free sour cream, 1 T lemon juice, 1 T milk, 1 t dried dill weed, 1/2 t sugar and 1/8 t pepper.  The whole family loved this!  Thanks for the recipe....

I can't believe how much I liked this recipe but I admit that I made a million changes. First off, I subbed the two tablespoons of butter for one tablespoon of olive oil because why would you add unhealthy saturated fats to salmon's healthy omega-3s? However, I really don't think the olive oil was necessary either and next time I'm leaving it out. I used 1/4th a cup of milk and only 1/2 of the salmon water and the moisture level was perfect. The perfect amount of saltines would be 14. To avoid blandness, I added 1 TB spicy mustard, 1/2 ts black pepper, 1/2 ts chilli powder, 1/2 ts curry powder, 1 minced fresh green chilli pepper, and 1/2 cup minced onion. Sounds like a lot but I ended up with a perfectly spiced, yummy loaf that wasn't bland at all. Try out my version, y'all:)

Simple recipe and good. I also used the butter crackers and also added some thyme. This recipe is a keeper. Will do as others suggested and double recipe next time.

Good basic recipe but needs  to have regular stuff added like green pepper, onion, parsley, celery, Worcestershire etc. to make it great.  I used oatmeal instead of crackers because it's healthier.

This recipe wasn't what I thought it would be. Sort of bland. Needed something, just not quite sure. My kids said they want salmon patties next time. I know they like them.

This is a great basic recipe. As with any "meatloaf" type recipe, almost anything can be added to customize it to your family's taste. I doubled the recipe hoping for leftovers for my lunch the next day. After adding minced onion, a few deops of liquid smoke, and a touch of cayenne pepper to the mix - it ALL disappeared at one sitting ! Quick & easy dinner entree !

This is a great base recipe. I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and added green peppers, onions, old bay seasoning, dijon mustard, and paprika. It was very good with the changes I made, I've never been able to get salmon patties not to fall apart and never thought to make it into a loaf. This is definately something I will be making often.

I grew up eating this version of salmon loaf, and this didn't disappoint! I didn't change a thing, but next time I will add some chopped onion. I served it with curried rice pilaf and steamed baby carrots.

This is my kids favorite Lent meal. I have always added chopped onion and a tablespoon of lemon juice. My side dish with this has always been my special from scratch macaroni and cheese.

Slightly bland, but the basic recipe idea is solid. If I make it again, I'll probably try to mix in a few more vegetables and spices.

I add a little dried mustard.... about a teaspoonful, and a couple tablespoonsful of grated onion, plus some chopped parsley.  I used canned milk.  It is much richer that way.  A little coarse ground pepper, and yum.  OH, and I put the melted butter over the top for a wonderful crust.

This was enjoyable!  I did tweak it a bit though.  Didn't have crackers, so used fine bread crumbs.  Ended up probably about doubling the crumbs and milk, to give it a little more body.  Seemed kind of plain, so added herbs (parsley, dill, oregano, etc.).  Topped with french fried onions the last few minutes of baking. Turned out GOOD.  Served with mixed veggies and broccoli/cheese rice.

This tasted like comfort food with a few minor changes! I read other reviews and added some minced onion and thyme and skipped the butter altogether. I also used Ritz crackers instead of saltines. This will be perfect for Lent!

made a very small loaf, I would have doubled all ingredients. I also added garlic powder and seasoning salt. Used unsalted crackers. Found it should have had more crackers in it, very moist.

Wow! Very easy and very good. A great way to get some salmon into the diet, especially if your not so fond of it. I will add some minced onion next time as suggested.

Good concept-but pretty bland.  Needs flavoring or spices to taste.

Really yummy and easy!  I had only 12 oz of canned salmon (2 6-oz cans) but kept everything else the same except I added some minced onion.  It turned out great.  My seven y/o loved it too!  My hubby and I agreed that this would be good for brunch as well as lunch or dinner, depending on what is served along side.  I will be making this again!

After losing a recipe for Salmon Loaf that my mother had given to me years ago, I tried this recipe. The only thing different was that this recipe didn't include onions, which I added - a medium sized onion diced. And... it pretty much tasted the same! Great recipe, but I always double it as a single batch doesn't make very much.

I've been looking for this recipe for about 5 years.  Your's definitely the best.  Even my Mom likes it and she is SO picky.  (That's not necessarily a good thing, but she knows what she likes). This is much better, hers was very dry and had no flavor.  Good job

Tasty.  As another reviewer recommended, I picked the skin and bones out of the salmon.  Although I have been told that the bones "melt" while cooking, the extra effort was worth the peace of mind it provided.  I used Ritz Crackers instead of saltines since that's what we had in the cupboard and it tasted just fine.  I doubled the recipe and used a 9 X 9 glass baking dish, which worked well.  The loaf was moist but still set-up well.  I served the salmon loaf with baked potatoes topped with French onion dip, since we didn't have any sour cream handy.  I also served buttered corn, cottage cheese and wheat bread for a simple, but tasty evening meal.

I have made this many times.... I usually double the recipe... I use fresh/frozen salmon, about 2 lbs, I  lightly poach it first.... just enough to get the skin off... I also  add fresh chopped garlic, parsley, basil, and cilantro to the butter before mixing it in... Very popular with the family...

My gramma made this for us almost every Friday growing up.  We had our with lemon juice, and fries or fried potatoes. I don't like fish in any shape or form, but love salmon loaf.  My hubby (who loves fish) is not looking forward to it.  I'm positive I will change his mind!!!!
Thank-you so much for the simple recipe.

great base for a recipe, highly customizeable, I added minced red onions, capers, lemon juice, and small diced red and green bell peppers, mixed in some thyme and dill for an herb touch, and left out the salt, capers provide enough salt, also I went with half club crackers, half saltine.

This recipe was great! My fiancé is not a big fish fan, and he really liked it. I went with other reviews and took the 1/2 cup milk to 1/4 cup. This made for a thicker more loaf like dish. Saltines still make it taste great since other reviewers said they used other crackers.  I also used Mrs. Dash 'table seasoning'. It has the perfect aroma and flavor to compliment this dish. It is also salt-free so it will not make the fish too salty for those who do not care for it. I will probably double the recipe next time to make a thicker loaf, but the crispiness was great. It was his favorite part! I bet this would also make a great salmon patties! Thanks so much for submitting this recipe!

This is the same recipe my great aunt has made for years and I love it but......
I don't see where the cucumber sauce recipe that goes with this loaf?
The cucumber sauce recipe is a MUST for this loaf and its simple and easy to make. So, here it is:
1/4 cup mayonaise
juice of 1 lemon ( I used bottled )
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup cucumber (with peeling) chopped fine
put all ingredients in blender and refridgerate.
I have to double this recipe because my husband makes a pig of himself when I serve the salmon loaf. Also, it doesn't compete with the flavor of the salmon itself like tartar sauce would.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and baked these in a muffin tray. They turned out crispy on the edges and quite tasty! Very simple recipe, I made it in 5 minutes using ingredients I already had around the house. Added diced yellow pepper for flavor. Simple and good.

I have made this Salmon Loaf so many times I practically know it by heart.  This is a great, quick, and easy meal when you are on the go.  One thing that I added was some more butter and crackers...I used these wheat club crackers and they made it taste even better!!! This recipe deserves 5 stars (no matter what)!!!

This was really good. I didn't have any crackers so I substituted with potato flakes. Also, I added lemon pepper seasoning on the top. I'll definitely make this again.

Good way - relatively - to use leftover fish.  I had leftover red snapper.  I didn't add the butter, but instead added about 1 tsp horseradish, 1 Tbsp parmesan cheese, & fish stock to moisten.  I subbed wheat bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs, too.  I also made patties instead of a loaf.  No, I'm not very good at following a recipe.  ;D  'Cooked them about five minutes each side.  Be sure to make some cocktail sauce to go with them.

This is a great recipe for Salmon Loaf.  We served it to 20 seniors at the apartments where I live and they thought it was the best they had ever eaten.  We did add some onions to it and seved it with a white sause with frozen peas.  It was delicious. The sauce really added to it.

This is a simple and tasty recipe.  The first time I made it, it came out WAY too salty (I suppose because the canned salmon already had lots of sodium), so the second time, I did not add any salt, and it was better.  I also removed most of the larger bones from the salmon on my second attempt.

Holy  I had fun with this one.  The recipe is so open to other things... Fresh sliced mushrooms, sliced yellow and red baby peppers, Pressed garlic and Chopped onions were my veggie addies.  on top I crushed crackers, mixed in Parmesan and melted butter to make a Parmesan crust.  should have added some salt though to compensate for the mushrooms...

This recipe was super easy and fast (I used muffin tins and cooked for 20-25 minutes).  MY only complaint is it was bland, so we added tartar sauce as a topping when we served.  That made all the difference!

WOW!!  I was a little nervous about making this recipe because my husband has a favorite salmon loaf recipe that his mom gave us, but he said that was the best salmon loaf he's ever had.  He really liked how moist this recipe is.  He practically licked the dish.  The kids ate it all.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was add minced onion like some of the other reviews stated.  Awesome and easy recipe with ingredients you always have on hand.

This is a very versatile dish.  I baked it in a muffin pan and they came out as good, crispy medium-sized pieces.  The advantage of the muffin pan is evident when one puts different spices and flavorings on top of the pieces.  I used Mrs. Dash's lemon and garlic marinade and hot sauce on some, Indian chili sauce with bean paste on some, and left others plain.  This is very good when saucy and spicy.  I recommend this dish because it is salmon, it is a different texture, and because one can easily adjust it to taste.

This recipe was average tasting.  Salmon patties are far better.  We did add onion/garlic powder & a dash or 2 of LA Gold (hot sauce) but still thought the overall recipe tasted bland.  Won’t make this 1 again.

This is a nice quick recipe for those nights when I want dinner in a hurry. I add a finely chopped onion, 1 tsp dried parsley and a tsp of thousand island dressing sometimes if I want more flavour. This is on our regular weeknight menu. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a really good recipe. Being from the Northwest, my Son and I love salmon. I had leftover salmon that I had baked with lemon, dill and butter. It was so good, I almost didn't want to put it into a loaf. But since there was not enough for two and I had to use it up, this was the perfect recipe as I didn't want to fry them. I followed the basic recipe but tweaked it as per other reviewers. I changed the recipe to six and added two eggs along with dill, rubbed thyme and onion powder. I also used ritz and other types of crackers. It turned out wonderful and crispy on top. I also used a dill sauce from this site that was really good with this salmon loaf. Thanks for the recipe

Very good recipe. Simple and tasty. I left the bones in, but next time I think I'll take the bigger (spine) pieces out. They did get very soft but were still firm enough that I knew what it was. Also for best results I reduce the liquid from the can of salmon by a bit less than 1/4 cup. Ate leftovers as sandwich with a slice of melted cheddar and tomatoes. Very good! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

Great recipe. I added medium minced onion and substituted lemon-pepper. I had size small eggs so I added an extra one. It came out really moist. My boyfriend loved it.

My husband loved this.  I used cheddar Ritz in place of the saltines and made my own honey mustard sauce for topping salmon.  Will make this again, soon.

I doubled this recipe and added a squirt or two of lemon juice. Also, I used one drained and one undrained can. I like it a lot better than salmon patties.

This was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. I made it exactly as written, except my loaf pan was a slightly smaller 8.5" x 4.5", and I baked it about 5 minutes longer. It was slightly falling apart - I prefer meatloaves and such to be kind of firm. Pretty easy to make though, and nice enough, but I suppose some kind of herbs or seasonings would have jazzed it up a little.

Well I basically used this recipe as a basis and then made it my own from there. I didn't have quite enough salmon so I added tuna, which my boyfriend loved. I used some oatmeal since I was out of crackers (but I would prefer the flavor from the Ritz like someone suggested, I think) and some finely chopped green onions! It was a hit :)

Wow, this is a great base for salmon loaf and the beauty is that you can add spices and herbs to your liking. I made a few changes.....I used half of the milk like other reviews suggested and also added about 2 T fesh lemon juice. A few shakes of dried dill weed and some fresh basil I had on hand. I put a few diced onions and celery in. Used olive oil instead of butter. I baked them in muffin tins sprayed thoroughly with Pam and had to cut and scrape each one out, so I won't be doing that again.....at least not with those aluminum pans. They are cute though if you can get them out. Good Luck. I will make these again!!

Great simple, healthy recipe. I use canned red (sockeye) salmon, 7-grain crackers instead of saltines, omit the salt, and add diced onion.  We love it and make it frequently.

I have tried many different recipes.  This one is by far the best.  I used spiced stuffing inplace of crackers and used minced onions and minced garlic because I had these on hand.  Also chopped hot peppers (Food blender very fine chopping)  It worked out nicely.  Everyone was well pleased.

I heeded all sorts of advice on this one.  I reduced the milk, added diced onion, hot sauce and plenty of spices.  I served it up and was asked why are we having cat food for dinner.  Needless to say not a hit with my family.  Thanks anyway.

not terribly impressed with this recipe.  firstly, this made such a small loaf, my family of 2 adults and one child devoured it in one meal and was still hungry.  it was quite mushy, as well.  certainly not what i remember my mom making for us kids!  will continue hunting for a better salmon loaf.

This was very good and my family enjoyed it.  I made it with fresh salmon because I happen to have a fillet in the freezer (I ground it up in the food processor).  I also used Ritz crackers because that is what I had.  I think I will add an onion next time I make it, but overall this was delish!  Thanks.

This is a great recipe! I highly recommend using a quality canned salmon. I added some salt-free seasoning (Mrs. Dash) and a little dry mustard for extra flavor. I served this with brown rice pilaf and veggies. Yum!

This recipes starts out not looking too great... canned salmon  is a bit on the gross side.  But  the end product was wonderful.  I added seasoned salt instead of regular (which I'll skip next time since it turned out a bit salty). also added a few more crackers (whole wheat brentons) and some minced onion.  All in all, a very good recipe. I'd make it again.

The flavor was great, but I added a bit of onion powder.  (I like my salmon to not be over-ruled by any other flavor!) The texture could be just a bit less moist; maybe a tad less milk.  I'll definitely be making this one over & over since it's carb-friendly and even my super-finicky six-yr-old loved it!

Delicious!  I made it as directed, for the most part. As another reviewer suggested I crushed up 14 saltines. Omitted the butter, was going to add olive oil, but it already looked moist enough so I skipped that part. For the salt&pepper I used fresh ground lemon pepper.  Couldn’t find my loaf pan but I remembered a tip from America’s Test Kitchen - they recommend not using a pan because it traps grease, fat, etc., and can make the loaf soggy. So I just shaped the mixture into a loaf shape on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Came out with a nice crusty edge and so moist! Like tasting salmon loaf my mum used to make. Hubby really enjoyed it. Going into menu plan rotation. Thanks so much for sharing this with us!

Not bad, mine needed a bit more milk, but my current oven is pretty wonky, it looks way more appetizing than the pic for this recipe. I wonder if some sauteed onions would've helped the flavor profile a bit too. Mash up the salmon bc it always comes with so many bones that is just gross. Overall good recipe.

As others, I added a bit of chopped celery and onion for a bit of crunch.  This works for either a loaf or in patty form.  Easy and good!

I have been making this recipe for quite awhile now and thought I needed to finally rate and comment on it. It is a regular dish that I make for dinner and my family LOVES it. The only thing that I change up is I use Ritz crackers,add 1/2 cup onion (diced), garlic powder,ground black pepper, and I use 2 cand de-boned samon instead of boned it make it so much easier. I am so glad I found this recipe it has mad my meal planning go alot smother when it is a fish night.

This is the same recipe my mother used to make with one exception.  She used to use 2 egg yolks to the mix.  Then she beat the egg whites until they were stiff and folded them in.  I do the same except I like to add diced green peppers and onions.  Good recipe!

This was not very good, at all.  I was looking for an alternate way to cook canned salmon, rather than frying it, and this just doesn't cut it.  I was afraid of it being too bland, so I added some onion and some spices.  In addition, I was afraid it would be incredibly soggy, and it was - even after I drained at least half of the juice from the fish.  The changes that I made were the only reasons that it was edible.  I might consider making this again if I drained all the juices, but I doubt it.  It was pretty gross.

Good simple food that was easy to make and even easier to eat!  Discarded most of the water in the salmon can, and left bones and skin in (bones are a good source of calcium), but mashed these thoroughly. Used only 1/4 cup milk-- more than that would definitely have been too much and made the loaf too moist for my taste.  Added: Mrs. Dash table blend seasoning, black pepper, 1/4 cup minced onions, three minced garlic cloves, 2 tblspns. fresh parsley, lightly sprinkled some rubbed thyme in, and after it was in the loaf pan sprinkled some parmesan cheese very lightly on top.  Done in the stated time.  Used a dill sauce recipe I found on this site, that was a mistake!  Next time I might want to serve this with a warm cheese sauce (yeah!).  Served the loaf alongside roasted potato wedges and baked asparagus spears.  Minus the dill sauce a perfect, comforting little meal, good during the wintertime but probably all year round as well.

Easy recipe to make. I didn't have crackers or milk on hand, so I subbed all-purpose flour for the crackers. I found the salmon to be salty already, and since I'm African-American and have a family history of hypertension, I decided to leave the salt out. Only one problem--the loaf fell apart when I tried to cut a piece, but that was okay because it tasted so good. Thanks.

I followed the recipe (I used fresh salmon fillets) but added the following ingredients for more flavor and color: lemon pepper, onion, dill and red bell pepper. I served it with a creamy lemon/dill sauce, it was very good.

As written this recipe is pretty bland. Needs some onion, maybe a dash of Tabasco, or a shake or two of cayanne to bring it up a notch. With those additions, it would rate a 3 or 4 star rating.

This had good flavor but mine turned out a little too soft.  I think maybe there was too much milk in it.  I will definitely make again and reduce the milk.

This was quite good. I used the cooked salmon in the package rather than the can, similar to the packaged tuna, and this had a nice mild flavor. Since there is no added water in the salmon, I added a bit more milk and put in a squirt of wasabi mayo that I had, as well as about a tbsp of fresh lemon juice. I used reduced fat butter crackers, added some onion powder, and omitted the salt. My family enjoyed it a lot, even my son, who initially said "yuck" when he saw it, then changed his mind after he tasted it!

This recipe was not only easy to prepare, but absolutely delicious!  I will definitely prepare this recipe again soon.  My mixture was of the consistency that it could be poured into the pan.  I baked it for about 1 hour and 5 minutes, because I prefer foods a little overdone.

This is a very good recipe, but if you want to feed a family of 4 you will need to double it.  This will a little leftover, but the original does not feed four!    In retrospect, as I look at the recipe, I should have known that ONE can of salmon could not serve 4 people.  I also increased it werve 40 at the local homeless shelter (using my math!) and they loved it!  Everyone wanted seconds...

My mom and I have been making a variation of this for years.  We just called it salmon casserole.  We used a good size, deep casserole dish or you could use a lasagna casserole dish.  Two 14.75 oz cans salmon and remove the bones.  We would break up (not like bread crumbs, just broken up) 2 tall packages, not boxes, but the packages of saltine crackers, so 1/2 box of saltine crackers.  So we only used three ingredients:  salmon, crackers and milk.  We would layer the salmon and crackers alternatively and the very top layer would be crackers.  Then pour the milk until you see it come up just a tiny bit on top.  Really just until you see the milk.  Then we'd bake for 1 hour and it was at 350 degrees.  If you wanted it more well done, you could add more time.  I now use the salmon pouches that have the bones already removed and just use enough pouches that equal 2 14.75 oz cans.  I also use the unsalted tops saltine crackers.  I've been eating this for over 20 years and I love it leftover the next day as well.  It's very healthy!

Added a little onion and served it with fried potatoes and creamed peas.  Family thought it was the best salmon loaf they’ve ever had.   A great recipe! It was delicious.  Definitely will make it again.

Out of saltines, so I used bread crumbs. I added another egg, 1/2 diced onion, some roasted garlic, dried herbs, mustard, fresh orange squeeze. Dill paste, and and another 1 /2 cup bread crumbs plus some additional leftover salmon. Frosted the top with 50/50 combo of mayo and mustard.

Excellent budget salmon meal. This is a keeper. Followed recipe - plus added 1/2 onion  steamed in Microwave, and chopped garlic. Also, substituted Ritz crackers.

Was a little too too moist.  Will make it again with less liquid- - either milk or juice from can.  Definitely good!

I'm one who reads all reviews before baking and follows changes that many people make.  This was no exception.  I added chopped onion which I sauted briefly in olive oil and added a pinch of curry to the mix.  I also added a bit of Dijon mustard.  It turned out very well.  I made a dill sauce to go with the loaf and we enjoyed this very much.  This is a great and inexpensive way to get salon into the diet.

Was looking for a basic recipe like my mom made.  This is it!  She added 1/2 cup of frozen peas (for "color") and I added 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon paprika.  I also sprinkled paprika on top.  (FYI:  12 to 14 squares of soda crackers makes 1/2 cup crushed.)

Now I know why I don't use canned salmon... I think it's hard to get excited about it no matter what you do so it. I made this exactly as written and it was kind of like hot tuna, didn't really get a salmon flavor. We added some hot pepper sauce and that kind of helped the taste. I'm sure some folks will like it but we probably won't have it again.

Technically I made it,  but I changed a few things.  I used fresh salmon instead of canned, added bell peppers and onions, and barbecue sauce to give it more like a meatloaf appeal...

Didn't use butter or  oil as used Deming's Red Wild Caught now marketed under Double "Q"  ( Walmart carries it) Sockeye Alaskan Salmon, added lemon juice,  lemon zest, dried dill, thin sliced spring onions,  tops and all, and topped with ground pepper and dill, no added salt.  Really want to zazz it up?  Sprinkle top with Spice Island Ground Chilpolte Chili powder. Terrific!!  Made it numerous times.  Family and friends love it! Loaf  Quick, Easy, and tasty.  Put in parchment paper in my  loaf pan.  Awesome-no cleanup!  Top with Opadipity  Greek  Lite  Greek Yogert dip made by Lite House.  Great straight from the oven to the table or cold.  My go-to meal when we want something special! Also can "glam" it up with a fresh sprig of dill!

I thought the first time it was a little bland.  Next time I used pepperidge farm dressing(chopping very fine) instead of crackers or bread crumbs, I used the reserved salmon juice plus milk to bring it to right amount, I added a half teaspoon of Old Bad seasoning, about a 1/3 c very fine chopped onion and red bell pepper . and 3 drops of Tabasco Sauce.  This all gave me a great flavor!

As with other reviews, I added some diced onion, parsley flakes and dill.  I also used Ritz crackers instead of saltines.  The loaf did turn out pretty good and will make again.

This is very similar to a recipe my grandmother had for salmon loaf, except she used breadcrumbs or plain bread and added onion and parsley. Always a household favorite, and I still make it today--though I save myself the labor of cleaning the salmon (which my grandmother did each time she made it) by buying the cans of flaked salmon.  It was the first recipe I requested when I moved out on my own!

My mom made this for us growing up, one of our favorites!  I like to mix in some shredded cheese (and I don't add salt or pepper).  I think onion and celery would be good, although my husband loves this just the way it is.

I just made this. Switched the cracker crumbs for a gf bread crumb and added dried minced onions. I used 3 small cans of salmon.  It turned out very good and was a lot easier than patties and no oils to fry it in.

Wanted to like this recipe more than I actually did.  I too added some extra flavors to spice it up (salt-free Spike, lemon pepper, onion...) but the problem was the consistency.  Perhaps doubling the recipe would make a better loaf (?) I wanted to give the loaf a try, but found myself wishing that I had made patties instead...  Not bad, but not great.

I was looking for a good base recipe for Salmon loaf.  This was pretty good.  the changed I made were to add cumin, mushrooms, peppers, Feta cheese, cream cheese ( no butter) and I used wheatabix instead of the crackers.  I also added some hot sauce and chilies.  I was very happy with the results.

Made it this evening for dinner, added about a tablespoon of Dijon mustard in the mix.

We will be making it over again, might try other variations (like some kind of sauce on top toward the end.

This was wonderful!  It was a tad bit bland - but I topped it with a dill sauce, so you couldn't tell.  Might add some more spices next time, but I will definitely use this recipe again!!

I think this recipe tastes great. I added 1 chopped spring onion and a few chopped celery leaves.  However, even though I let the top get crispy and brown, the inside was mooshy.  I didn't like that. :-(
