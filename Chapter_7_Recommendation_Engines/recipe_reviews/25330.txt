This is a really good, basic veg*n chili! I prefer to cut down on the fake meat and add in black and kidney beans, but it's good either way.

Great quick lunch on a Fall day! My additions were:  doubling the chili powder and adding in 2 cans of rinsed black beans & 1 can of diced tomatoes. I really liked the flavor of the liquid smoke in this!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Great Chili...Disregard "he" who made the commentary about the Worcestershire Sauce...There's a reason this recipe calls for vegetarian Worcestershire sauce...Because it's well....VEGETARIAN... : )  Lovely Recipe.  I added a lot more beans :)

I give it one star because it contains Worcestershire sauce which has anchovies in it!

This was fantastic. I doubled nearly everything and made a few alterations: A can of beans (pinto, black, red), a can of crushed tomatoes, a shallot, vegetable broth instead of water, 1 small can of pickled Serrano peppers, and spicy brown mustard instead of dry.

I am going to say I loved it, but I did not use vegetarian "crumbles". Instead I crumbled extra firm tofu. I also had some bean sprouts that were crisp and I threw them in. I ate mine with vegetable chips and it was definitely a tasty meal. I also put in some salsa since I had no red pepper flakes or chili powder. Never let not having all the ingredients stop me from trying out a recipe!!!

Loved it, but I also added my own flair to it. Borracho beans and black beans. First time making a vegan chili and it was pretty interesting and easy.

My only issue is the recipe calls for WAY too much liquid smoke.  I could have cut it in half or more.  It's very powerful.

This was very easy to make and delicious. My family loved it. I added black beans and a little bit of maple syrup. I used regular Worcestershire sauce because I didn't have vegan. I definitely will make this again.

I was surprised that this dish would be so delicious! I really liked the smoked liquid flavoring in the chili. I used vegan beef that had it's own flavoring which made it really good. It was a bit too watery so next time I will cut back on the water. The cilantro and scallion were a nice touch for a garnish. I am definitely going to make this again!

I added a can of red kidney beans otherwise I stuck to the recipe. I found it to be a little rich for the first few spoonfuls probably due to the liquid smoke. Next time I'll use half as much but still overall pretty good chili!

I made this with tvp that I cooked with cumin, oregano, vegetable broth, and soy sauce, then added the onions, sauteed for a bit, then continued with the recipe. Excellent. ^_^

Really good, and filling! I have always been skeptical of veggie crumbles, but this was a really convincing vegetarian chili. Yum.

I really liked this dish the first day. It was a little spicy for my kids and I don't recommend it as a left over. I had this with brown rice :-)
