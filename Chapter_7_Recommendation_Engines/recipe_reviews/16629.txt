I'm only going to rate this a 3 for one reason.  The recipe as listed is not very good.  However, with the help of other reviewers - it becomes one of the best enchilada sauces EVER.

First off, I used half California Chili Powder and half New Mexico Chili Powder (available in the Mexican food section of your grocery store in little baggies.)  I used chicken broth instead of water, 8 oz. of tomato sauce instead of 4 oz, and added 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. cumin, and 2 tsp. turbinado sugar.  I made beef enchiladas and they were AWESOME!

So don't be afraid to try this recipe - just doctor it up a bit!

Muy bien!  It is a very easy recipe to follow.  However, one should be aware of the type of chili powder they are using. I am quite experienced in Mexican cooking & I use a home made chili powder so cut down the amount of chili powder to 3 tbsp. But for the less experienced cook may take a little time adjusting the amount to their particular taste. This is definately a recipe one should try if they want a true home made Mexican enchilada sauce.  It is well worth the effort of experimenting with various chili powders.  Once one masters this part of the recipe it is really easy to make.

This is real close to a recipe I make. I use 3 T  veg. oil and only 1 T flour. Same amount chili powder. Get a good quality chili powder and add slowly to get to your liking. I use 2 C low sodium chicken broth instead of water.Gives a richer flavor. I use 10 oz. tomato paste,1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp. ground cumin and 1/2 tsp salt. Cook oil and flour 1 min. add chili powder and cook 30 seconds. add rest of ingredients and cook 10-15 min. This makes a bit thicker sauce and is really good. Thanks Brenda!

WOW!  I was really nervous about this.  I usually use the can sauce, but I couldn't find my regular brand.  I took the advice from another review- using 3TBS oil (but I used butter instead) and 1 TBS flour, but I sauteed some minced garlic in the butter first, then instead of 1/4 can tomato sauce, I used 1/2 can.  I was so scared I was going to have to throw out my veggie and chicken enchiladas, but not only did it taste wonderful, my husband had three servings that night, then polished of the rest the next day.  I only got to have one serving!  He said it was better than the can kind! I'll be making it again this week.  Thanks so much for the recipe and the tips!  Just a note, even if it doesn't taste that great by itself, it's incredible when on your enchilads.

I took the advice of the other rater's and to this recipe added 2 tsps of sugar and 2 tsps of chicken boullion powder since it was a bit bitter.  It was excellent.   Put it over homemade enchilada and backed ....was wonderful.  Will make over and over again.  Thank you.

The consistancy and appearance of this sauce is almost identical to what you find in the canned sauce, and tastes every bit as good or better. The flavor is going to depend on what you use for "chili powder". Many commercial products add spices to ground chili and chiles vary in taste and heat. I used pure ground chili (chile rojo) found in the Mexican section. Be prepared to experiment a little. I added 2 tsp. of sugar as I thought the flavor of mine was a little bitter.

I will never buy can sauce again.  My family is Hispanic and they love Mexican food.  It seems the can sauce is always too spicy for my little ones.  Now I can decide how spicy it is by putting a little less Chili Powder.  It is fast and easy.

I was actually quite surprised. This was VERY good, and I am very hard to please when it comes to enchilada sauce. I did change it a little. I doubled the recipe. Like others, I used chicken broth.  I used crushed garlic. But most importantly I used El Pato Jalapeno tomato sauce and a can of Herdez red salsa. I was a little hesitant to use the Jalapeno tomato sauce since it is very hot, and hubby hollers when I use it in anything (and he's of Mexican heritage, go figure.) I would have used El Pato hot style tomato sauce (in the yellow can) but didn't have any. But actually, with the chicken broth and water, it was perfect and hubby really liked it. Oh, and come to think of it, I didn't double the chili powder! An oversight on my part while I was doubling the recipe. Thanks Brenda. I will no longer use the can or packaged stuff, and the ingredients are things I almost always have in my kitchen.

This is my new favorite enchilada sauce.  I use the bulk chilli powder at the grocery store and it is just right (not too hot).  This is alot more like a authentic enchilada sauce than other recipes I have found.

I also used 2 cubes of chicken boullion and 1 tsp of sugar. I used 1/8 c of ancho chili powder and 1/8 cup of Chipolte chili powder. I made ground beef and cheese enchiladas with this sauce. My boyfriends 15 year old son told me he loved me after I made this!!

As is, this recipe is 4 stars - mostly because it is the perfect foundation recipe for what I call "red mexican gravy" which can be used on enchiladas or anything else you want to pour it on.  It becomes a 5 star recipe if you do two things-- use chicken or beef broth instead of water, and use a high-quality chili powder.  Really, this recipe is only ever going to be as good as the powder you use, so make it a point to use a good one.  I used a good New Mexico chili powder and high quality beef broth and this sauce was ROCKIN'.

This is one of those recipes you can't judge by itself.  Have to have it ON something to know.  
Oh, btw, made this with (altered) Fiesta Chicken (turkey) Enchiladas & YUHM!
Heated 2T olive oil & added 2T flour.  Cooked a minute.  Added 1/4c chili powder (cheapo $.50 Walmart kind, mild) mixed with 1/2t oregano, 1/2t black pepper, 2t (tolerable, but too much; trying 1t next time) salt, 2t sugar.  Cooked about a minute, stirring constantly.  Gradually added 8oz homemade turkey broth, then 8oz tomato sauce.  Simmered 10 - 15 or longer. This makes about 2 cups.  Reheat in glass, not plastic.  
KEEPER!  BIG NEWS - at least to me - The second ingredient in my chili powder is salt.  Salt probably isn't needed at all in this or any recipe using a salted chili powder.  Check your labels!

4 stars for what I ended up making. Based on other reviews, I used chicken broth instead of plain water; added 3 pressed garlic cloves with the chili powder; and a whole 8oz can of tomato sauce. What I added myself was a teaspoon of chipotle in adobo for a bit more smoky flavor and heat. [Put the whole can in a mini-processor and puree it. Then drop teaspoonfuls onto a plate and freeze it. Once solid, place all the drops into a bag and keep in the freezer until you need.] It had the perfect consistency. I won't buy a can again!

I have never made Enchilada Sauce before but when I decided to make some Chicken Enchilada's I decided to find a recipe for some homemade sauce.  This recipe turned out perfect.  Since I had boiled chicken for the enchiladas I reduced the broth left from cooking the chicken and used this instead of the water.  I also used the whole can of tomato sauce. The sauce did have a slight bitter taste so I did what some other reviewers had recommended and that was to add some sugar.  I also added some cumin.  This recipe makes a lot. I will never buy canned enchilada sauce again.

This enchilada sauce was delicious!  I did take a couple of the reviewer suggestions.  I used 8 oz of tomato sauce instead of 4. For the chili powder I used 2 T ancho chili powder, 1 T chili (just says chili powder on the label) and 1 T of the taco seasoning recipe on this site by bill echols.  Also, I added some veggie bouillon with the water.  

I put it on refried bean enchiladas that I got from cookinglight.com.  

Very yummy!  I will definitely make again!

I've discovered I like making my own sauces since I get to control what goes in and this recipe is no exception.  

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and found it a good start but there were some things missing.  Looking through the other reviews, I agree.  Added 1-2 tsp of sugar, some cumin, and used chicken broth instead of water and wowza so much better.

Wonderful enchilada sauce! I used chicken broth instead of water, cut down the chili powder a bit and used 8 oz tomato sauce. Much better than store bought!

I used ladyhen76's changes/additions and this was very good in an enchilada casserole I made. (It tasted yucky and grainy by itself but good once cooked into something.) Great way to control what's going into your body (including salt) is to make it yourself! It was easy.

This was my first time making enchilada sauce myself.  I'm not sure why, really, since I make nearly everything from scratch, but with this sauce I normally just grab a can at the grocery store.  Not anymore!  This was so easy to make, I always have chili powder around, and it tasted better than the store-bought stuff anyway!  One tip for anyone making enchilada sauce for the first time, the recipe states to "salt and pepper and garlic powder to taste".  Be fairly liberal, because this does require a decent amount of these things.  I used probably 3/4 t. salt, 1/2 t. pepper, and about 1 t. garlic powder.  Also, after simmering, I thought this could be a little bit thicker, so I added about 1/2 T. of tomato paste.  This was so good and made awesome chicken enchiladas!  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I made this with dollar store chili powder and it was very good.  I did add a the cumin, sugar, and oregano as one reviewer suggested.  Yummy, won't be buying canned again and tonight I'm trying it with the New Mexico chili powder.  Great basic recipe to play with!

I also followed the suggested subs for this recipe: chicken broth instead of water, and add 1 can (8 oz) of tomato sauce. I also added some onion powder, oregano, and 1 tsp. of sugar to the mix based on my personal taste. Definitely will use again.

I enjoyed the flavor of this sauce with additions.  I like onion and garlic in mine so I stirred in chopped onion and garlic in with the spices and cooked them in the oil.  I added a touch more tomato sauce and cumin to taste.  I also used chicken broth in place of the water as other reviewers suggested.  This sauce has a nice, silky texture.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is a WONDERFUL base recipe for enchilada sauce.  Yes, you may have to tweak it and spice it up a bit more but I think it's better to have a recipe that you can add to and make it "your own" rather than a recipe that is set in stone and you find it too spicy once you've got it made.  I followed the recipe exactly as written first to see how I needed to spice it up to my tastes.  I then added 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 TB taco seasoning, and instead of just 1/4 cup of tomato sauce I added the entire small can (which I think is 1 cup).  This made the BEST pan of enchiladas I have ever made in my life. It tastes like it came from a restaurant.  Thank you, Brenda! I will use this over and over!

Very good sauce.  I have never made this before and was expecting it to be similar to the can stuff, but it was way better.  Thanks

Delicious! Easy and so tasty. I used ancho chile powder, regular chili powder and about 1/4 tsp chipotle powder until I had the amount listed. As far as garlic powder, I just gave it a sprinkle or two. Probabably less than 1/8 tsp. I will double this next time as we really wished there was more. This was great on my enchiladas. My husband thought it was a little spicy, but my son and I loved it. I will admit maybe I did go a little heavy handed on the chili powders. Thanks, Mrs Espy, I loved your sauce!

This was a great recipe. I tweaked it based upon what other reviewers said:
3 TBS oil
1 TBS flour
I added crushed garlic to oil 
I also added 1tsp oregano, 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp sugar. Also a shake of cinnamon:) I added 1/2 teaspoon paprika and 2 cups chicken stock instead of water. I omitted the tomato sauce because I dont like tomato sauce in my enchilada sauces. It came out AMAZING! My husband LOVED it. He had double servings and polished off the dish the next day. All I have to do now is find a really great recipe for the inside of the enchilada! I will definitely make these again. Family favorite:)

This was just OK. Too thin for our tastes and it needed some essential seasonings such as cumin. I enjoyed the "Ten minute enchilada sauce" on this site much more.

Even adding a lot of garlic powder because it says to taste, for us, this still needs more flavor added, other than just chili & garlic powders & salt.  (i.e. cilantro, lime juice, finely chopped onion, cumin, etc.)  I really appreciate the basic recipe though, and it still is wayyyy... better than salty canned enchilada sauces.

What a great sauce. Easy to prepare and so good. I added cumin and a whole can of tomato sauce(6oz)so that my 2 and 6yr wouldn't think it was too spicy. But if you like spicier than follow recipe. I also added crushed garlic to mine. Combined this recipe w/ ground beef enchiladas and we were in heaven with every bite. Will make again and again.

I used this sauce for homemade enchiladas that I made. I didn't have enough chili powder so I used a packet of taco sauce and it turned out great. I will use this recipe over and over as it beats any canned sauce!

Did NOT go over well in my house...both my husband & myself felt it was rather flavorless so we kept trying to add a little more salt as the recipe indicated & after it cooked (we made it a Enchiladas recipe from here)it just got worse--Sorry!

This is wonderful to make if you don't have any enchilada sauce on hand. I think mine would have turned out better if I had a better quality chili powder.

We loved this and it was so easy.  I froze the little bit we had leftover and used it again however the consistency and color were really unappealing after freezing.  Next time I will make a little less sauce or make more enchiladas!

Great recipe! I was very intimadated at first when I saw it. But after reading a few reviews I changed it up a little and became very confident it what I was doing. 
Suggestions:
Use 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water.
Make sure your pan isn't to hot!
Stir! Stir! Stir!
I used 1/8 cup of McKormicks Mexican Style Hot Chili powder and 1/8 cup of McKormicks Chili Powder. (Using the Mexican style gives it an extra kick, but not to spicy)
Add a pinch of sugar after it has simmered and thickened up. It will remove the bitter taste from the chili powder!.

ENJOY!!!!

I made this yesterday. I was in the mood for enchiladas and had no sauce. I saw this recipe recommended on a chicken enchilada recipe review, and I had all the ingredients. I had NO idea that it could be so easy to make great sauce! Wow! Now, maybe it was our chili powder, but it was a little over the top on the chili flavoring. I'll use a little less next time. It was the overriding flavor on the tongue and left a little burning too, so I'll cut back.I sprinkled some sugar into it, which helped a little bit but not enough. I also used chicken broth instead of plain water. One thing is for sure - there is no need to buy canned enchilada sauce with this recipe making it so easy! I made the cottage cheese enchiladas from this website, a double batch of this sauce, and we had an amazingly great dinner that tasted just as good today as leftovers. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! YUM!

I had no idea it would be so easy to make my own enchilada sauce from scratch! While I keep away from cans and mixes for most everything else, I always use canned enchilada sauce. Not anymore! Within 3 minutes of starting it on the stove, my husband commented that it smelled really good. It was then that I knew it would turn out well. Our enchiladas are in the oven right now, but the spoon of sauce I tried was amazing and quite spicy. Instead of regular tomato sauce I used the El Pato yellow can and some pureed tomatoes since I was tripling the recipe and needed more tomato. I also added some cumin and paprika just for good measure. The flavor was so much more complex than canned sauce and worth the few extra minutes to put together. I can't wait to try the enchiladas! I know that I probably should have waited to write the review until AFTER eating the finished dish, but what I already tasted was incredible, so I can only imagine how great dinner's gonna be!

I used hot chili powder from Sauers. I used less oil and omitted the salt. A simple and very delicious recipe that I used in a casserole since I didn't have a jar of enchilada sauce on hand. I will make this again!

Didn't have any enchilada sauce so was looking for a quick and easy recipe to make instead.  This one fit the bill!  All of the ingredients I had on hand and it was so easy to make.  I may never buy store bought enchilada sauce again!  Thanks for the tasty recipe!

I made a few changes off the bat (butter instead of oil and chicken broth instead of water) and then doctored it up because I wanted a sweeter, more tomato-y taste so I added another 12 oz of tomato tauce (2 8-oz cans total) and 2 T of catsup.  It doesn't taste out of a can and it was very good.

Outstanding!! recipe. I used this recipe along with another review by LADYHEN76 that used chicken broth instead of water, I used (low sodium broth) always can add more salt to your liking if needed. 8 oz. tomato sauce instead of 4 oz. Half and half of New Mexico Chili powder, CA. Chili powder = the 1/4 cup chili powder, 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. cumin, salt & pepper to your liking and if you want to add some other spices like garlic powder or onion powder (little bits at a time) go for it. Oh and here's a great idea for an Enchilada dish, you can buy an already cooked whole roasterie chicken (large one from Costco or grocery store) cut up with some chopped cilantro and green onions No seasoning on the chicken add a ladle or two of the sauce to the chicken and don't forget the CHEESE I used 1 pound of already shreaded Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese combo in a bag and mixed a hand full or two in with the then roll them up in a greased dish then top with remaining cheese and chooped onion and bake till bubbly. Awsome! Enchiladas!!  Thanks to you, Brenda and Ladyhen76   Great recipe!

Thanks Mrs Espy... I'm really glad to have a recipe for an Enchilada Sauce that I can make instead of having to use store-bought. I used less water than called for and about twice as much tomato sauce.  Also equal amounts of chili powder and paprika.  Added a dash of cinnamon, lots of garlic powder, and some generous shakes of hot sauce.  I used the sauce for Black Bean/Spinach Enchilada Pasta... but while the pasta was cooking I dipped some tortilla chips in the sauce for my appetizer!

I will never buy canned sauce again after making this recipe.  I doubled it, using 4 c. chicken broth (2 cans) and 2 8 oz. cans no salt tomato sauce. I also used 5 Tbls oil with 3 Tbls wondra flour. Wondra does not get lumps! Best flour on the market.  I know people have said in earlier reviews to not skimp on good chili powder, but I used what I had which was my own store brand and was just fine. I did the cumin and oregano thing as others have done....to taste. I really doused the sauce into my beef mixture as well as over the enchiladas This sauce tastes better than my favorite Mexican restaurant where I always order the enchiladas. My son took a dish of these enchiladas into school for a party in his Spanish class and got extra, extra credit for it.  Hooray Mrs. Espy for this wonderful recipe.  Big hit around here!!

While this was simmering, I didn't think this was going to work - or taste very good - but it was wonderful on our beef enchiladas. The only change I made was I used jarred taco sauce in place of the plain tomato sauce. Very easy and delicious. Thanks, Mrs. Espy!

Very good, very easy!!  I was happy to find such a simple recipe the very first time I tried to make it.  I was getting headaches from the canned stuff, who knew it has MSG.  This one is great, almost as easy and better for you than the canned stuff.

Excellent!  Just like what you get at TexMex restaurants here in Houston.  I didn't have enough chili powder so I "handmade" some, but it still turned out wonderful.  I had my doubts while I was making it, tasting it by itself I was thinking it wasn't so good, but once it melded with those corn tortillas and cheese --- OH MY!!!  Definitely a keeper - I have an industrial sized jar of chili powder now!

I ran out of canned enchilada sauce in the middle of making enchiladas one day and found this recipe. Very easy to make, and tasted great. I may use some of the other reviewers suggestions next time and try adding chicken broth in place of the water, but I will use again. Thank you for sharing.

This stuff is really good.  I used it in the cottage cheese enchilada recipe on this site and my family loved it!  As I said in that review, I left out the garlic and salt, because my parents don't like thinks too salty or garlicky and they said it was perfect!  Thanks very much Brenda Espinoza for the super recipe!!!!!

This is my LEAST favorite recipe in all of this site. I cannot figure out where the five star rating came from. Even after adding the chicken stock, beef stock, sugar, and everything else in the kitchen, trying to just get it to taste decent it still tasted terrible.My chili powder is really good in everything else, but even that could not help this disaster! The canned stuff is MUCH, MUCH, better than this. Thanks, Mrs Espy, but no thanks for this leaves a LOT to be desired in enchilada sauce. Sorry.....

Just what I was looking for!  I used leftover vegetable broth instead of water and it was just perfect - much better than canned, and more convenient with such everyday ingredients.  Thanks!

YUM!  My husband & I made a bunch of this to go with the "Cottage Cheese Chicken Enchiladas", also on this site.  We served them to 4 of our friends and everyone loved the dish.  We'll never buy sauce again when it's this easy to make!

Wow! The best sauce not from a restaurant! Easy to make too. I used chicken broth, as most reviews suggested, but other then that, kept it the same. Not too much heat, and the kids enjoyed it also. I used it over Hearty Beef Enchiladas, and everyone had seconds.

I just got done making this just as the recipe directed. I dont normally like enchilada sauce because its too watery and tastes to bland and weak. This sauce has an AMAZING flavor. I'm waiting for it to thicken up, if it doesnt i'll add a little thickner (incorporated sauce and flour) to it. Otherwise  wouldn't change a thing about this recipe and I have no idea what kind of chili powder I used:)

Use chicken broth instead of water and add a little onion powder and you've got yourself a five star recipe.

Ok, I really liked this sauce the first time I made it except it didn't make enough.  I also only added a few Tbsp of chili powder as well as some paprika( you need that, it does make a difference) and some cinnamon.  The second time I made it I followed the recipe and added the full 1/4 cup of chili powder.  Now, I like spicy food but there was no way anyone could eat that.  I had to keep adding liquid to try and tone it down then it just basically ruined the batch.  My suggestion is to add Chili powder a little at a time, let simmer in between each addition and keep taste testing it.  Then you can get it perfect for your family.  Also, it was so easy too.  I'll never buy store bought sauce again.

It seemed a bit too thin in the saucepan (next time I will use less stock). It still had great flavour, and the enchiladas turned out very well. I'll definitely use this again!

Ok...I made the mistake of making this without reading the reviews...big mistake.  The way the recipe is written is really, REALLY bland.  I like the idea of being able to make my own sauce, but I would have to doctor it up quite a bit to get it the way that we like it.  As written it's ok....but it could be great.  Thanks for the post.

I use this recipe everytime I make beef or chicken enchiladas.  For some reason, in my area of Toronto, I can't find packages of dry enchilada sauce mix, so I decided a few years ago to use this one.  It's fast and easy.

Luckily I had a can of enchilada sauce in the pantry, cause this was totally inedible. I thought it tasted tinny, and my husband simply couldn't tell what it tasted like.

Easy to throw together for a last minute recipe.
Each time I make this enchilada sauce I double the ingredients for an extra batch that I freeze for later.

Unlike commercially manufactured enchilada sauces I 
can control the amount of ingredients-especially the
salt content.  Cookgirl

An excellent sauce that I will use, unless I find something even better.  You can adjust the chili powder for more or less spice; I used standard chili powder and some Chipotle and Ancho chili powder and not even the full amount the recipe calls for and it was too spicy, so I added 2 8 oz cans of tomato sauce to reduce the burn!  I also added a couple tsp. of sugar as others have suggested.  I used chicken bullion in place of water for flavor. I HIGHLY recommend this sauce!

After moving to New York from Texas, I've been desperate for Mexican food.  A visiting friend made me cheese enchiladas using this sauce.  If you don't add the full amount of water it will be unbearably thick, but if done correctly, this tastes very authentic and is restaurant quality.

I love this recipie, I have to agree with the others on using the right brand of Chile Powder.  I also found that I was able to stretch the recipie by adding another 1/2 cup  of tomato sauce without losing any taste.

Good but needs way more heat. I left out the bell pepper and added granulated onion instead. It was to thick for me. So I added some water.   Good. Makes a lot!!!! Will be making it again.

I made this sauce following some of the tips by changing to 3 Tbsp olive oil, 1 Tbsp flour, chicken broth, 15 oz can crushed tomatoes. It came out wonderful. Never knew that making this sauce was so easy as I prefer not to buy canned sauces. Thanks for this recipe!

This is an excellent enchilada sauce recipe. As others have commented, I took their advice and added 1tsp cumin, 2tsp sugar. My wife is an enchilada connoisseur, and she thought it tasted just like a restaurant. Definitely a keeper.

I previously had a recipe for enchilada sauce from this site, however sadly it's no longer there.  I made chicken enchiladas for a Quatro de Mayo party since I had to work today so I tried this recipe with some of the recommended changes listed in the reviews:  used butter instead of oil, sautéed some garlic in the butter prior to adding the flour, used a combination of regular chili powder and adobe chili powder (about 2/3 and 1/3) but kept to the 1/8 cup total. I added 1 tsp of of cumin and 1 tsp of oregano,  used chicken broth instead of water, and used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce since I doubled the amounts. Simmered it for about an hour.  It was delicious!

Four stars because I made changes, but the changes made a really amazing sauce. I used California chili powder, a whole can of Mexican tomato sauce, one tsp. cumin, one tsp. Oregano, and one tsp. sugar. I used butter rather than oil and sautéed a bit of garlic in it prior to adding the other ingredients. I also used broth (veggie) rather than water. So great with these changes!

Really good sauce.  The only thing I did different was add chicken broth instead of plain water and used 8 oz of tomato sauce instead of 4 oz.  it was excellent.   Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This is basically the same sauce I make.  The only change is to add the chili powder AFTER you add the water.  If you burn the chili powder it tastes bitter.  Also add the water slowly, and whisk it in that way you wont get as many lumps.

This sauce was wonderful, it reminds me of one we used to get at a favorite restaurant that closed it's doors after 50 years.....I won't be missing it as much now.  I used the chicken brooth, cut back on the chili powder and added a pound of cooked ground beef, we poured it over chhese enchiladas, my family is already asking for seconds, thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe.  I made changes based on other suggestions, using chicken stock instead of water (1/2 water 1/2 chicken stock), 8 oz can of tomato sauce, butter instead of oil, adding cumin, used 2 kinds of chili powder.  Its so important to toast the spices in the roux before adding the liquid.  It is just a great recipe that reminds me of my favorite mexican restaurant

Maybe I did something wrong here. This was my first attempt at enchiladas and it was no good. It just tasted like tomato sauce. I think I will buy it next time

This is a great base recipe, but I made a few tweaks-first I sauteed garlic in the oil and used chicken broth in place of water, added oregano and cumin and a pinch of cinnamon.  Also, I added a can of tomatoes w/green chilis and put most of the tomatoes inside of my enchiladas with the rest of the filling.  Excellent!!

This turned out really good! I think it would have been even better had I had some better chili powder like the other reviews suggestted. I made chicken enchiladas so I used my broth from the chicken which I think made it better. It had a really good flavor. I wanted to make my own sauce because all the store bought has MSG and I was pleased with how this turned out. :)

Very good! I used chicken broth instead of water and since I didn't want to waste my can of tomato sauce, added the whole can. SO good, I will never buy canned stuff again!

Good enchilada sauce base.  I added cumin, pinch of red pepper flakes,  pinch oregano and used 4 cloves garlic (instead of garlic powder).   Much better than the canned stuff!

Very easy and quite good. You can vary the flavor by using a different specialty chili powder. I always use chicken broth instead of water. Love it!!

I just made this sauce for an enchilada recipe I found on here. I didn't want to use canned. This is so good. I made a few modifications. I doubled the batch. I also made this with chicken broth and added cumin. YUM! This is so good.

I used El Pato tomato sauce, added some dried oregano, and omitted the salt.  Very good.  Made this for "Cottage Cheese Chicken Enchiladas" from this site.

This recipe was wonderful!!!  I am allergic to onions so I usually have to avoid pre made mexican sauces.  This was the answer I was looking for.  I use this on chicken and cream cheese enchiladas with rice and cheddar cheese inside as well.  Thanks!

I was going to make Chicken Enchilada Soup from this sight but I didn't have any enchilada sauce.  I looked at what was on this sight and decided to give this one a try.  It was great!!!  I will never buy enchilada sauce again.  Not only was this good but it was so easy to make.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great Stuff and so easy to adjust once you have a basic recipe!  I did end up adding some cornstarch in cool water towards the end because it wasn't quite thick enough. My BF was so happy because enchiladas are his all time fav and he said these were just as good as the restaurant. Overall very pleased :)

I made this recipe on a clean out the fridge night.  I had about a cup of chicken broth left so I cut a cup of water and added chicken broth. I also cut way back on the chili powder to keep it mild for my kids and husband.  It lacked a little something so I added a half a tablespoon of sugar and that seemed to balance it out just right. I simmered it for at least twice the amount of time called for because it was a little thin. It reduced down nicely. Used this over the top of Chili Rellenos Casserole.

I would have given this a 5 star, only we like more tomato in our sauce.  I upped the tomato sauce to 1 cup and left everything else the same.  I am a mexican food junkie, and this is way better than anything in the local restaurants. Super yummy!

As per the advice of other viewers - I doctored it up.  It transforms into one of the best enchilada sauces on the planet!  I used half California Chili Powder and half New Mexico Chili Powder.  You can find these in the Mexican food section at the supermarket in the little baggies.   Instead of water, I used chicken broth,  8 oz. of tomato sauce,  and 1 tsp. oregano, and 1 tsp. cumin.  I made chicken enchiladas and they were the bomb!  I will definitely make this again :-)

This sauce was so easy.  I was hesitant about adding that much chili powder, but it wasn't too much.  Next time I'll try substituting chicken broth for the water as other suggested to give it a little more flavor.

A healthier, tastier alternative to canned sauce. I made this several times now. Based on other reviewers, I replace the water with chicken stock and add my chili powder based on personal taste.

Good recipe but the type of chili powder does make a difference.  I've made this recipe several times with minor changes.  I prefer to use less chili powder and add some cumin and it was also excellent made with powdered taco seasoning instead of chili powder and the grandkids loved it. Next time I'm going to try using chicken broth instead of water.

I thought this was a very good I added a little ground cuminseed to it and it was very good. It was a last minute decision to look up enchilada sauces and it was much better than the packages I usually buy. I will use this more often

I doubled the tomato sauce and used chicken broth instead of water as suggested by some others - This sauce is much better than any canned sauce I have used.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this was nothing like any enchilada sauce I've ever had. VERY watery, no real flavor other than the chili - was like hot water mixed with chili powder.

This is very good.  We use it on every enchilada recipe we try.  We found that we use 1 tablespoon of hot chili power and 2 tablespoons of mild chili powder.

I thought it was great - I added a little more tomato sauce than the recipe called for, but I don't know that it was necessary.  Didn't taste too bitter to me at all.

The recipe text should definitely warn about the chili powder. Mine was horribly hot; unbearable, really. It sounds like it could be better with a different chili powder, but that's the most important factor.
