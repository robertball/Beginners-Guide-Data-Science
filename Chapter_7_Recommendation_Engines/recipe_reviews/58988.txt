This recipe has errors in it that cause peoples' rice to become "mushy" or displeasing.  It is because of the wrong instructions given. You should never soak or wash the rice in cold water as directed, because cold water will disrupt the cooking process when the rice finally enters the boiling water. You should soak the rice in luke warm to room temp water.  And further more, you should NOT boil the rice for 15 minutes, this is called "over-cooking" this is why your rice will come out mushy.  You should only boil the water for 5minutes.  It depends how long you soaked it, the longer you soak it the shorter time it needs to be boiled. If you soak it for 30minutes you should boil until 10min max.  But if soak for more than 30min then please only boil for 5 minutes and then transfer to oven.  The recipe given above is wrong and not in conformity with how good Qabuli or even good rice is made, that is why too many people are coming up with "mushy" rice.

The first time I made this recipe I tossed it; the rice was mush, but it had a good flavor.  I made it again, cooking the rice for 3 minutes after returning the water to boil.  I also skipped making the sugar syrup with oil. I tried that twice and had carmelized sugar in oil both times. Instead after mixing the rice and carrot together with the spices, I sprinkled on the sugar and proceded as written.

The raisins are a nice touch.  The dish smelled delicious, but the flavor was nowhere near as strong as the fragrance for me.  I thought the rice was awfully boring and won't be making it again.  However, I have found a new friend in golden raisins.

Odd.  My rice also ended up like mush, and after baking comes out like some sort of rice casserole.  The instructions for cooking rice are unique so I think I'll stick to cooking it in the normal fashion next time.  I also had a problem with the sugar in oil not dissolving properly.  The flavour of the dish is interesting - halfway between savory and sweet.  I have no idea if this is authentic or not, but personally didn't do it for me.

It was great to have a different taste to normal steamed basmati. And an easy recipe to follow. The only change I made was I added the spices first, to let them cook a little followed by the rice and carrots and raisins. Thank you for sharing.

I doubled the amount of spices, and this still came out bland.
