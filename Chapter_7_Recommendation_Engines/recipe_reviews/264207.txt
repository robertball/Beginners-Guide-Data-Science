Carefully read through the recipe before making. Even with the ice, you’ll need more liquid. It’s thick as pudding. Also, it needs something sweet added. I ended up adding an extra half cup of water and a date for sweetness.

I'm going to sub for lily's low carb chocolate and make sure the peanut butter is unsweetened. Going to follow advice and add more almond milk or ice.
