This was delicious and I did make a few changes.  I left out the creole mustard, adding in about 1 1/2 tsp emeril's bayou blast.  The crabmeat I used was a fresh, pasteurized product, thus it had no liquid -and therefore wasn't salty, I also used fresh shrimp, instead of a canned product I didn't use the parsley either...this was a great recipe, one that we will be having again soon!  For those who couldn't figure out what to do w/ the cream...try reading step 2 in the directions...if you still can't figure out what to do w/ the cream...just face it you probably never will.

I used this recipe as a special in my restaurant with some small changes, and the feedback was fantastic. My changes were only to add some diced onions and bell peppers to the sauce (Sauteed) and then finish it off with some bread crumbs to brown under the broiler. Great way to get rid of some extra grouper and crab meat!

YUM. Oh, don't use flounder though. It turned out WAY to soft for this recipe, but had a great flavor. I thought the flavor was a little on the weak side, so I tripled the cajun seasoning to my liking, and just went ahead and poured the whole 8 oz. container of heavy cream in because it was a little thick for my liking (I wanted the sauce to cover the rice also.) Before I poured on the crab/shrimp mixture, I sprinkled goat cheese over the fish & rice. FANTASTIC. Definately add the cheese for a more dimensional flavor. (If you like goat cheese to begin with of course :)

I would try this it kind of sounds good but what do I do with the cup and a half of heavy cream? 
After the ingrediants it's never mentioned again.
I kind of assume that it goes in the "Creamy Crab and Shrimp Sauce" but I've been wrong before.

This is a definite keeper! I used catfish instead. I also added a little cornstarch to the sauce to make it creamier. I added a little garlic powder along with the other ingredients for the fillets. Restaurant quality!!

Just okay as is. I loved the Creole mustard and the Cajun seasoning, but this was seriously in need of some color, some punch, some zip!  And I mean both in flavor as well as presentation.  I garnished this with some finely chopped red and green bell pepper and, while it was a great improvement,  for us the dish still wasn't worth the time and money to prepare it.  More than anything else, it was basically just heavy and rich.

With all the "heavy cream" confusion, I ditched it and went for my healthy favorite, fat-free sour cream. About 3/4 cup stirred in with the seasoning worked nicely. Also, to the sauce, I added some grated garlic (cooked with the butter and mustard) hot sauce, dill, and a dash of worcestershire. This was quite good, although I took someone up on the suggestion of serving it over rice, and wish I wouldn't have taken away from the other flavors. Garlic salt added into the rub will also give the fish more flavor. Thanks for the recipe. Will make again!

I substituted fat-free evaporated milk for the heavy cream and eliminated the shrimp due to an allergy, and this was still great!  Serving the grouper over rice was a perfect way to soak up the creamy crabby sauce.

I rubbed the fish with olive oil and bronzed it lightly with a blackening seasoning.  Then added the butter and cream to a saucepan where i added some off the counter creole seasoning (at least that was what was on the packet) and tossed in a small piece of andoule sausage for flavor.  I added the parsley about a minute before it was done to help preserve is body.  This was a much better way to combine the flavors.  1 tsp is too little on the seasoning to.  keep adding until the flavor suits you.

A definite MUST COOK for those who want to impress family and guests.  I substituted Zatarain's Creole Seasoning (a little over a tsp) & didn't add any salt to the sauce besides what is in the Creole Seasoning.  Also omitted lemon juice & opted to let my family squirt lemon on top if they preferred.  Used uncooked shrimp instead of canned.  My family LOVED it.

I LOVE this dish.  I make it frequently.  If you don't have the creole mustard, just add a squirt of dijon.  Just as yummy.

The first time I made this, the guys loved it, but it was off for me.  The second time I made it I added onions and diced garlic to the butter before adding the cream.  It tasted better but a little off, so I added just a little bit of sugar to taste.  We are from the deep south, so I added extra creole seasoning as well.  I added the crab and shrimp after the heat was off to keep it from cooking to nothing.  Delish.

Excellent dinner especially when using fresh grouper.  Prepare fish with a small amount of olive oil & garlic/herb seasoning and let sit in refrigerator for an hour or so before broiling.  A keeper recipe.

This was a very tasty sauce and very easy to make.  I seasoned and sauteed bay scallops in a little bit of olive oil and used them in the sauce instead of the crab and shrimp, and it was delish!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Instead of the Cajun seasoning, I used Old Bay because I had little ones eating it as well and didn't want it to be too spicy.  Everyone loved it.  The sauce is great and it would go well served over pasta, however I made rice pilaf.

I was going to make this dinner for Christmas Eve dinner. I went to whole foods and bought very expensive grouper, fresh shrimp and phillips crab meat. I made the recipe exactly right. I put it over rice like someone suggested. The recipe tasted somewhat bland. I also do not suggest putting it over rice.

Being from Louisiana, I avoid using canned crab and shrimp if I can get fresh. The juices of fresh seafood add so much to the flavor as it cooks or "soaks" in the sauce. I believe they call the "marrying" of the ingredients. Otherwise tis is a GREAT recipe!

Very good. Made some changes, I did not have crab meat but I had some fresh small shrimp and bay scallops and I added green onions. I omitted the mustard. I had Mahi Mahi on hand and that's what I used and once in the oven I put Panko bread crumbs on top to give it a little crunch. Mahi Mahi was delicious and the "shrimp/scallop" sauce gave it a nice touch. This goes to my recipe box. Thank you.

excellent recipe. I paired this with some wild rice and "pan-fried asparagus" for hubby's b-day dinner.  He thought it tasted like a high end restaurant meal.  My son thought it was the best grouper he'd ever had.  And we eat grouper alot.

Using only the shrimp, not having crab meat on hand, left this fish moist and flavorful. Clean up was a snap. This worked out well for us.

This is a must-have recipe for anyone who likes seafood. It was delicious and easy to make. I was unable to find creole mustard in my grocery store so i just added more Emerils bayou blast instead. Quick tip: if you are using canned crab meat as opposed to fresh, it is very salty. keep that in mind when flavoring your sauce. I would definitely use this recipe when having friends over for dinner. It has everything you look for as a crowd pleasing dish: different from everyday, full of flavor and spice, interesting ingredients that will make your guests think that this dish was very challenging.

my husband is not a fan of seafood (unless it's fried) but he ate all of this.

This was so good. I used 1/2 pound fresh shrimp and cut up. I also added mushrooms and served over wild rice. We will be having this again.

I didn't have any Creole mustard - so I just used Ole Bay, salt/pepper to taste. I seasoned the fish and shrimp w Ole Bay, pepper and Garlic/Parsley powder. I pan seared the Tilapia in butter. I added 3 tablespoons of tempered sauce to 1 table spoon of cornstarch (1 teaspoon should be sufficient) and whisked until smooth, then added the mixture back to the sauce to thicken it up a little. WHAT! THIS SAUCE HAD YOU LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO SLAP!!!

I've only tried this once, but it was just okay.  I followed the recipe as directed and just didn't think it had all that much flavor.
