It sure would've been helpful to know that the evaporated milk needed to be in the freezer for 30 to 60 minutes before it would whipped into peaks… This totally messed me up.

I am so happy to see this recipe as I had lost the one I used years ago and I mean maybe 40 years!  This is a great recipe as it was less expensive than condensed milk and whipped up beautifully after the milk had been refrigerated overnight.  No one knew it was evaporated; they thought it was whipped cream!

Made is a second time to see if letting the evaporated milk needed more time in freezer or if jello needed a lot more time to partially set.  Same results.  Mush!  Never set up at all.  Something is missing from the recipe.

Tasted good, but it never firmed up. Glad I tried it before bringing it to a hostess' home.

Followed recipe precisely, but it refused to set up and I ended up with a graham cracker crust-lemon mush disaster. Sweetened condensed milk was whipped for ages and never reached a stage where peaks formed, and in 20 years of cooking, I have never heard of that ingredient being able to do that... are you sure you didn't forget something here?

I really liked this recipe! The lemon cake turned out just as I hoped. I found the instructions easy to follow. For me, the jello/evaporated milk mix settled well.

I had the same problem as others where the jello settled at the bottom in places. Never saw the notation about putting the milk in the freezer either.

It has a weird color as I picked up lemon pudding instead of lemon jello. So I had lime jello and used that. It was delicious anyway. I would add you do need to have cold beaters, bowl and milk so it makes soft peaks.

I’m so excited to find this recipe! My mother used to make this 40 some years ago & I’ve not been able to locate her recipe. She always used Milnot and it was a big production to put this dessert together but oh soooo good! Can’t wait to make it for my family at Easter!

I have tried to make this twice and both times it didn't come out. The first time the jello sunk down to the bottom and the next time the jello didn't set so I tossed it.

Glad I read the recipe completely before deciding to make it, otherwise the freezer time would have been a real pain. Lovely, light lemon flavor.

So happy to find this recipe.  My mother used to make this in every possible flavor and color when I was a kid.  For such a simple recipe, it can fail in so many ways.  First, I never use softened water (it seems to keep the jello from setting).  Next, the evaporated milk must be well chilled.  (or it won't whip up correctly)  Then the jello mix must be "partially" thickened in the fridge.  I stir it every 20 minutes or so to keep it evenly chilled, but not hard on the edges.  It's ready when it's the consistency of egg whites.  Whip the milk on high until it's huge and pretty stiff.  Then I add the jello mixture to to milk and keep whipping.  Once the color is pulled through the milk, it's ready for the crust.   (If the jello is too thin, it will sink to the bottom.  If the milk too liquid, it will never set up.)  If it doesn't set, you can always throw it in the freezer.

This is a perfect summer dessert! I love that the lemon flavor is fresh because you use real lemon! Plus the topping of graham cracker and sugar just adds a wonderful flavor and texture!

I love lemon and this dessert was just ok.  Matter of taste.  Do not take it personally.  Over and out.
