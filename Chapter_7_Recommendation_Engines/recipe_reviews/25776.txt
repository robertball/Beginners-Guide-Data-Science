This was a very yummy, chewy cookie that my whole family loved!  I made it extra chocolatey by adding chocolate chips.  The add-ins are endless with this cookie.

Yummy Recipe and sooo- simple! The cookies are chewy like a brownies. They do stick to the pan even with greasing it. However they're worth it. Next time I'll use parchment paper to see if that helps.

Loved 'em!  Easy, chocolatey, convenience of cookie with the taste of a brownie.  Did not spread thin at all, followed the recipe to a T (except I didn't have chocolate pudding mix so I used vanilla). Oh, and I just spooned them out instead of rolling, made 31 perfectly round and thick cookies.  Will definitely make these again and again! Thanks for sharing the recipe! :o)

These cookies rock! They are so simple to make and are super chewy and chocolatey. I like to make cookie sandwiches with them by spreading buttercream frosting btw two cookies.

it's not really a cookie. It's a very thin brownie that is circular. But you can adjust it by adding a little bit of flour (or less oil?) until the batter is less goey and more firm. But it is still a pretty fail cookie. And you have to bake it for longer than 6 minutes... more like 10 or more minutes. Until it gets puffy. I had to put it back in the oven for 5 minutes before it puffed up

these cookies were good as far as taste but presentation wise they were a total mess. I think there is simply too much liquid. I would try using just two eggs instead of three. I also tried chilling the dough for a bit to help with the spreading but it didn't do much.

Not bad tasting; moist and chewy. But not worth the hassle. They spread very thin in the oven and are difficult to get off pan even with greased cookie sheet and spatula. I would rather just make brownies.

I made this recipe according to the directions and then added 1/2 cup of flour. It scooped nicely with pampered chef small scoop and baked 7 min. They turned out melt in your mouth. I also added Heath milk chocolate bits. I will defiantly do these again. I sprayed my pan with olive oil spray and they came off the pan no problem at all!

I just made them but i put 1 big chocolate chip in the middle of each cookie and on a couple put red and green sprinkles on it in honor of xmas but i like the plain ones better. I wasgoing to put powdered sugar on the plain ones but i didnt have any. Parchment paper help with the sticking and we only put in 2 eggs rather then 3.

If you like brownies you will love these cookies. I followed the recipe to the "T" and was very satified. I sprayed my air bake cookie sheets with Pam and used a metal spatula and the cookies came off just fine. I may try using a little less oil and/or egg next time to see if it helps in terms of making a more "cakey" cookie.

I just made these and am eating one now... they are awesome!! I did alter the recipe using the suggestions of others; I only used 2 eggs and only used 2- 8th cups of oil instead of 3. Also I greased my cookie sheets with Baker's Joy and they didn't stick!! Hope this helps someone in the future. =)

I actually did follow the recipe to the T. I had all the ingredients. I measured the oil exactly. But there was no "rolling" anything into a ball. And I did find they stick with and with out greasing the pans. I used stoneware which is well-seasoned. I also used chunky chocolate brownie mix. I'm sure they will be a hit at the dance tonight. Next time I think I will make them smaller... More to love. Thanx for the recipe.

Made according to recipe. Used a Ghirardelli brownie mix that already had chocolate chips in it. I added about 1/3 cup chopped hazelnuts. Baked 7min. 40 seconds; cookies slid right off the sheet after cooling. Easy - Yes! Delicious - Yes!

I'm eating a cookie as i speak... and i must say that it's definitely worth a try! Like some fellow reviewers before me i only used 2 eggs and i used a little less than 3/8 c. of oil. The cookies stuck to the pan but they taste nice and chewy. The sisters love 'em!

These turned out great! I couldn t find a 19.5 oz brownie mix so I bought 2 16.5 oz. brownie mixes with walnuts and used what I needed to make the right amount. Then decided to add a little more to compensate for the walnuts. Reduced the oil by just a little. Baking time 8 minutes. Definitely will make again so easy

Fantastic! My son informed me on a Sunday late afternoon that he needed 4 dozen cookies for the High School concession stand. They had to be ready and packaged by two's before Monday at 3pm! Its late Sunday all the stores were closed I had very little sugar left and no ready mix cookie dough. Furthermore I had to work all day Monday so Monday baking was out of the question! ACK! I found this easy recipe. I had the ingredients...and in no time I had all the cookies made packaged and ready for the concession stand! YEAH! Yummy recipe like this saved the day! Thank you! Oh and I topped the cookies with Mini M&M's. Fantastic!:-)

Just make sure your brownie box is 19.8 oz. Used an 18 and had an ungodly mess. Added flour & then they rolled. Good tasting but messy to make. Added chopped walnuts & put 1/2 maraschino in center while still soft.

I read all the reviews ahead of time. Be aware that the average American brownie mix is 15 oz. So taking into account 15 oz Brownie Mix and 5.1 oz pudding (I used vanilla) I used 3/4 c veggie oil and 3 eggs. I then added a bit of flour (sorry didn't measure but enough to make it stiffen up to cookie dough consistency). I cooked them for 8 minutes and they were delicious!
