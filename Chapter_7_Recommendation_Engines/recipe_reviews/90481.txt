Excellent as well as very easy and quick to make. I didn't have any roasted red peppers, so I just used fresh and it was still excellent. Quick, easy, very tasty and healthy to boot - what more could you ask?  Will definitely make this again!  Edited to add:  Have now made this with fresh peppers and roasted red peppers - no discernable difference in taste. Might as well use fresh - it's cheaper!

This was an interesting method for cooking chicken as I'm used to sauteeing it in either butter or olive oil. I thought I'd try this route for healthy cooking but the broth evaporated before the chicken was fully cooked so I ended up adding butter & olive oil after about 10 minutes. Although not how the original recipe intended, it turned out really good. If you don't have roasted red pepper on hand, you can just put it over a gas burner flame or grill it on a BBQ, black scorch marks and all, then peel, seed, and chop it up. It worked out great that way. When I added the vegetables, I covered the pan to keep the chicken moist. Total cook time was more like 10 minutes for 3 big chicken breasts plus 8 minutes more after adding the veggies. I think next time I might saute the chicken in olive oil, deglaze the pan with broth and then add the veggies chicken for last 10 minutes. The balsamic ties the strong flavor of the vegetables together with the chicken nicely.

EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! I am on the South Beach Diet Phase 1 and I reaaly enjoyed this recipe!
The 1/2 cup of chicken broth had evaporated when it was time to add the veggies, so I added more.  It made a good sauce for the chicken.  I double the vinegar and it gave it a little "kick".  Since I didn't have any low fat cheese, I skipped it.  I will prepare this often but will make sure that I have the low fat cheese on hand in the future.  My husband loved it as well. He said "It's a keeper."

This dish is WONDERFUL. Instead of the chopped tomato I used diced tomatoes w/chipotle. It added even more flavor. It was easy and delicious.

This dish was awesome!!!  The only changes I made was I added some chopped fresh basil, a little extra balsalmic vinegar, and stirred in the (low-fat) mozzarella cheese.  Served with Italian Rice from this site.  It was so good that I don't know if I will be able to wait til lunch today to have the leftovers!  Thanks so much for the yummy, pretty, healthy dinner!

This was fantastic.  My chicken was still a little on the frozen side, so I diced it before cooking it.  Other than that, I followed the recipie exactly and it came out great.  The ingredients complimented each other quite well.  I will probably increase the amount of broth and serve over some pasta next time.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!! I made it for my luncheon group & for some dinner guests & everyone wanted the recipe! This is easy to make, but tastes & looks like you slaved for hours. The flavors meld together wonderfully & an added bonus, it is very low-carb for us dieters!!!

Very good!  I'm not sure how much broth I used, I just poured it in the pan, I added the chicken and cooked it covered.  I add the veggies and cooked them covered.  The chicken came out so juicy and moist.  The added cheese was great!  I will make this one often!

I loved this! The flavors tasted great together. I put the leftovers in a tortilla wrap and it was also very good. I roasted my own red peppers in olive oil. Would definitely recommend.

This is a family favorite. This recipe isn't just delicious but makes a pretty dish. I love the combination of the peppers, asparagus, and balsamic. However, I did makes some changes. I browned the chicken first and then added the broth (as suggested by someone else). I increased the garlic to about 4 cloves and the balsalmic to 3 tbls. I also sprinkled the chicken with a little bit of red pepper flakes. And to thicken the sauce, I mixed about 1 tbls of flour with some broth and added it to the dish before adding the tomatoes. I served it with rice which worked well with the sauce.

Kind of bland. I added four cloves of garlic, crushed because you get more flavor that way. I also had to add more chicken broth because it evaporated while cooking the chicken. I used roasted red peppers from a jar and fresh asparagus and omitted the tomatoes, but used the balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. I even added some Parmesan to the mozzarella and it was still nothing to die for. I was pretty disappointed because of all the rave reviews, but I can't figure out what would jazz this recipe up. Likely won't make again, but no offense to the recipe poster - obviously it's good to many others. Just not for me.

Surprisingly good! I used a full can of chicken broth, 2 garlic cloves, and 2 teaspoons of basalmic vinegar. I had to drain the broth before I added the cheese.

The only thing I'll do different next time is that I will not salt the chicken. The dish is pretty salty already.

This is such a great recipe I've made it twice in one week!  

I did tweak it a few ways:  I sauteed the chicken in olive oil to brown for about 10 minutes before adding the broth (about 1 cup.)  Instead of fresh or canned tomatoes, I used sun-dried along w/ the asparagus and roasted red peppers. 

I also used extra balsamic vinegar and a mixture of shredded asiago and parmesan cheeses on top.  I served it over brown rice.  Delicious!!!

Yummy, easy and can be super healthy!  Use parmesean instead of mozzerella to reduce the fat, but keep flavor.  This is also great when using fresh broccoli florets (don't forget those yummy broccoi stalks too, just peel them and cut into bite size pieces first.) instead of the asparagus.  I make this one often!

No leftovers!  I sprinkled a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the chicken first and browned it well in olive oil with some onion and shallot before adding the broth.  I also added a little white wine and a healthy dash of red pepper. Fantastic, will be making this again and again.

Yum!  Easy, quick, and healthy!!  Tasted great, nice & fresh.  I only give out 5 stars to a recipe I could eat allll the time, so this is 4 stars for me, but really worth your time :)

Followed exactly, came out perfect.

THis is such a great recipe!  I make it with a little extra broth (or water and boullion).  This last time I made it, I cut the chicken into bite-sized peices.  Presentation is a little better with the whole breast, but it cooked so quick!  I think start to finish was 20 minutes.  I also used canned diced tomatoes.  I look forward to trying with fresh tomatoes though.  Delicious! And I feel like I am eating healthy!

This was a really great recipe!  Served it to a couple of my girlfriends with French Baguette slices on the side and everyone loved it.  I did add extra garlic and balsamic, started the chicken with cooking spray instead of the broth, and had to roast my own peppers because I didn't have any jarred.  The flavors are spot on.  I think next time I will probably double the veggies and broth and probably quadruple the balsamic.  There was plenty of chicken to go around but we all could have done with another helping of the veggies.  Fabulous!

My husband loved this. I served it over garlic mashed potatoes, and having made sauce by adding more chicken broth, poured that over the whole thing. He said it was like a dish from a restuarant. This one's a keeper! So's the husband. :)

I really enjoyed though would agree with more broth and like the idea of a couple of other vegetables being added.  Hope the leftovers are as good.

Made this last night and was pleasantly surprised with it.  Given the ingredients I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but everyone really liked it, the flavors work really well together.  I served it over brown rice that I prepared with chicken broth and garlic instead of water.  The only change I made was to use a fresh red pepper.  The only thing I might do different next time is brown the chicken a little bit before adding the chicken broth.  I prefer my chicken that way.  Will definitely keep this one on hand!

This was a very tasty dish and would be perfect for entertaining because it make such a beautiful presentation. I did make some adjustments though. I seasoned the chicken with fresh black pepper and non-salt seasoning (I used Penzey's Mural of Flavors) and browned the chicken in pan first; removed chicken. Then I slowly added 1 cup chicken broth to deglaze the pan -- getting up all those great brown bits. I added chicken, red peppers, asparagus and garlic to pan; covered and simmered like in original recipe. Before adding the tomatoes I stirred in some arrowroot starch to thicken the sauce (arrowroot keeps the sauce clear unlike adding cornstarch). Added some whole grape tomatoes and heated them through. Once I plated the dish I omitted the vinegar and squeezed some lemon juice on top and sprinkled with fresh chopped basil and the cheese. Yummy!

Simply delicious.  My chicken needed more than 1/2 cup of broth (more like 3/4 cup), but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Wonderful meal.  It didn't even really need the cheese, but it added a nice touch to it.  Will definitely make this again.

Excellent!  Only change I would make would be to brown the chicken instead of cooking it in the broth.  Otherwise, quick, easy and delish!

I was so excited after seeing the great reviews, but I just didn't care for this dish at all. I followed the recipe to the T! My husband says it's a 4, I'd only give it two stars (more for the health than the taste). Disappointing, I won't make this one again.

Healthy and tastes great! I added zucchini & mushrooms. Also, I didn't use the cheese for less calories and it still tasted great! My boyfriend is a very picky eater and liked it! I will make this again!

Great dish!  I did season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper before hand and then browned the chicken before adding the broth and rest of ingredients.  Also, I bought FRESH roasted red peppers from the pesto bar at our local supermarket.  More expensive but worth it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is such a delicious and easy recipe! I substituted the balsamic vinegar with a balsamic vinegar salad dressing that also had sundried tomato and roasted red pepper flavoring in it. It added more flavor to the dish! I also agree that 1/2 c. chicken broth is not enough, it evaporates so you will need a little more. I will make this again! :)

This is literally one of my favorite dishes.  I could eat it twice a week and still love it.  I prefer to get fresh tomatos and core and seed them.  I also double the amount of veggies instead of using pasta or rice.  I double the amount of garlic and balsamic.  This dish is amazing :)

Followed the recipe exactly and the dish was robust and full of flavor.  Served this with a light pasta and salad. My family loved it. I think next time I try it I will add olives, which I think will add a nice zest.

Scrumptous! Looks beautiful as well. The roasted red peppers make the dish a hit. I added more chicken broth and more balsamic vinegar, which my family loves, as well as melting the cheese in the skillet before serving over rice. Some warm bread and butter and you have got a great meal. Thank You for Sharing

This recipe was great! It had everything you would want in a healthy recipe. Tons of flavor, good protein and veggies. Can't wait to make it again. Just a side note: I did not have chicken broth so I just threw in a little dash of extra virgin olive oil to keep everything from sticking to the pan. I covered it after adding the veggies to retain as much moisture as possible and everything turned out wonderfully!

Wonderful recipe.   Only change I make is to saute the chicken first in a little olive oil.    Other than that I can't think of anything else to add to it.  Will be made many times even when asparagus is not in season. Thanks for submitting.

This is a fabulous and easy receipe. I didn't have chicken broth on hand so I drained the roasted peppers juice and water to make 1/2 cup. It worked perfectly fine. I also added onion. I served with rice and broccoli and it was perfect and a very healthy meal.

This is so simple but it is fantastic!  I like my veggies crisp tender so I had to change it up a little.  I sauteed turkey cutlets in a little olive oil and set them aside.  Then I added the aspargus (I like the thin stalks) and garlic and cooked them in a little olive oil over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes.  I added the roasted red peppers and tomatoes and cooked about 2 minutes to heat through.  Then I added a few tablespoons of balsamic.  We topped it with a little bit of shredded Asiago and served it with Smashed Potatoes and Cauliflower with White Cheddar Cheese.  Yum and so beautiful!

This was wonderful and tasted better than I imagined because I had my doubts.  The chicken had a wonderful flavor!  I never cook chicken in a skillet or in the oven, always turns out tough for me.  I cooked the chicken by putting it under the broiler, until almost done, turning once; this gives it a nice golden color. I used more than 1/2 cup of broth, just kept pouring in as I needed it.  I also used just about double the asparagus, we love asparagus.  I used fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of the mozzarella.  I missed the step of adding the balsamic vinegar forgetting to add it, but it was very delicious without it and look forward to next time trying it with balsamic vinegar.  My picky son even liked it!!!  This one is a keeper!!!

I omitted the tomatoes (hubby's not a fan) and used a pepper trio rather than all red, but otherwise tried to follow it exactly. Both of us chose to add more balsamic vinegar than was called for. I served it over fettuccine, though perhaps a smaller noodle would have been better. The amount of time this took didn't measure up with the average dish.

The veggies tasted great together, but I found the chicken to be bland.  Next time, I'd add the garlic from the beginning and season the chicken more heavily.

Very yummy and easy recipe! I made a few minor changes. I used a whole can of chicken broth and fresh bell peppers instead of jarred. I served it with garlic and olive oil flavored couscous. The flavor was just great. I will definetely be adding this to my dinner rotations.

Fantastic recipe.  The roasted peppers add a perfect sweetness with the balsamic, and the asparagus is a great crunch.  Thanks!

This is so delicious! (I did not add balsamic vinegar, there's already enough acidity from tomatoes and roasted peppers. Didn't have to add mozzarella to compensate for the acidity either.)

The chicken turned out quite dry though.

This recipes is super easy and delicious.  The balsamic vinegar really gives it a nice flavor and keeps it from being a run of the mill healthy recipe.

Excellent! I used thin chicken cutlets and dipped them in an egg and flour coating before sauteeing in olive oil. After adding the veggies, I added a cup of chicken broth and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar for a little more flavor. I then simmered the whole dish together while I cooked some noodles for a side dish.

Used Brussels sprouts instead of asparagus (the asparagus was nasty at the store), fresh red pepper, and only 2 chicken breasts. Served over whole grain rotini pasta.  Very tasty dish.  The Brussels sprouts needed a bit more cooking.

This is very good, and based upon my and other reviewers experience, easily adapted. I had frozen bells on hand, so I used those. I had chicken tenders, so I used those. After quickly browning the chicken, I followed the recipe except that I covered the skillet, which I feel is necessary to slow evaporation and steam the veggies. Going into regular rotation!

Makeing this with chicken was awesome, I browned the chicken first to give it a bit of color.  I tried it with pork chops. WOW!!! My family went nuts. This time of year fresh asparagus is available in abundance. I again browned the chops first, cooked them a wee bit longer then the chicken to make sure they were done properly and followed the rest of the recipe. You really need to try it. Really good.

My boyfriend described this as "tasty", but said he would add more tomatoes and more cheese.  Of course, I had already doubled both of those, knowing he would say that!  I made several changes, but all staying within the idea of the recipe.  I increased the broth to 1 cup as several reviews had said it evaporated and still ended up adding more water to the pan.  I didn't want the added salt of the broth, but white wine would probably have been good as well.  I used 1 fresh red pepper and 1 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, and increased balsamic vinegar to 1 Tbsp.  I also used garlic salt on the chicken and omitted the fresh garlic (boyfriend's preference, not mine).  Served with mashed potatoes.  Definitely will make again.

This is a great one.  I will keep it and us it again.  I added some sliced sundried tomatos for a little extra taste.  Next time I will use a sweet white wine to poach the chicken with.

This is GREAT! I was a little worried it might be a bit blah, but no! It's wonderful! Very flavorful. The splash of balsamic vinegar at the end gives it just the right *hint of a* punch. I'll be making this again and again! **Update: Just realized I forgot to use the chicken stock - I only used light olive oil to saute the chicken. Still turned out great!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It is full of nutritional goodness without giving up any flavor. I actually forgot to put cheese on it and it was still great. This is a great recipe to mix different vegetables with. I think next time I am going to use spinach instead of asparagus.

This recipe definitely deserves a 5-star rating!  I'm attempting to teach my boyfriend how to cook, and gave him this one to try.  He needed very little guidance from me, which scored some points with me already.  I've tried sauteeing veggies in chicken broth before, but never received THIS MUCH flavor out of it!  What a great-tasting combination of veggies.  I also liked that the only seasonings used were salt and pepper...talk about low maintenance!  I added an extra clove of garlic, but unfortunately, did not realize I was out of balsamic until dinner was cooked.  This dish was still great without it, but I can see how the vinegar would make it so much tastier!  Will definitely mak this again.  (You can't beat how low in fat and calories it is, either.)

Overall, this was a good recipe. I will be making it again, but with a couple of changes.  First, I didn't use the chicken broth; rather, I browned the chicken in tablespoon of olive oil.  I used frozen asparagus (12 oz. bag) and red/yellow roasted peppers (just a minor tweak).  Lastly, I substituted Parmesan cheese instead of the mozzarella without any of the vinegar.  It tasted wonderful!

This dish was just okay.  What I liked about it is that the recipe took a very short amount of time, and had fresh ingredients.  What I'm not fond of is the poaching method for the chicken, I thought that cooking the chicken this way led to the chicken itself tasting bland and not taking the flavor of the other ingredients on.  If I were going to do this again, I would use sun dried tomatoes, rather than the roasted red peppers which is more personal preference than anything.  I would add some white wine and the chicken broth after pan frying the chicken breasts.  Finally I did not have mozzarella and instead used provolone which turned out even better.  This recipe provides a good foundation for a great weeknight meal if you tweak it based on what you like.

I made this tonight and loved it!  Wonderful flavor which I attribute mostly to the peppers I roasted on the grill last night.  I actually forgot to add the cheese and I didn't miss it.  Not sure I need to add.  Thank you for sharing this.

I wasn't too sure about trying this but asparagus was on sale.  I am glad I did, it was incredible.  Definitely one of my favorite recipes and its healthy.  I didn't change anything but I may try some of the other readers suggestions next time.

I really liked this recipe though I will admit, I made many changes. I breaded the chicken and fried it first. Put it to the side and boiled the asparagus in the chicken broth and a little white wine. Then added chopped up peppers and pepper. Once that was tender, I added the chicken back to the pan and let it cook for 10-15 minutes. The liquid thickened and I served with pasta. A great basic recipe that I tweaked a little!

This recipe looked beautiful!  It tasted good too, but I found it a little bland.  I would add more garlic next time and maybe some sliced green onions.  I appreciate the recipe...it was nice to find something low fat and tastey!

WOW was this delicious. I definetly had to add a lot more chicken broth, and there wasn't really any sauce left in the pan, just a bit from the Veggies. I also kept the broth on Medium-Low as opposed to Medium-High heat, and cooked the chicken breasts about 7 minutes, then flipped them over and cooked 7 minutes on the other side before adding the veggies.

My advice is don't change the ingredients whatsoever: and don't skimp on the pepper and balsamic vinegar!! I'd give this even more stars if I could.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I added about 1/2 cup of white wine along with the broth at the beginning and it added a little more flavor.  My husband loved it and even my son who does not eat asparagus completely enjoyed it.

Go with fresh peppers- red and yellow for a better crunch and prettier presentation! 
Fresh mushrooms would be a nice addition I think, and I will try that next time.
Served over white rice makes it a little heartier too.

I was a bit disappointed in this dish and found it to be on the bland side.  It was ok, but not sure I'd made it again.

This was very easy to prepare and pretty tasty. I was cooking 2 whole chicken breasts instead of halves, so it took a bit longer and required about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of broth. I also added more garlic. A heaping tablespoon of the pre-chopped stuff in a jar. We love garlic. The sauce seemed a bit runny, and I wanted to serve over pasta, so I threw in half a can of cream of chicken soup that was leftover from another meal. This thickened the sauce nicely and served well over angel hair pasta. We then topped with Parmesan instead of Mozzarella. Yummy!!

I thought this recipe was delicious and healthy.  I followed some of the suggestions and browned the chicken first in olive oil and onion, and also added more chicken broth so that I had some sauce to pour over the brown rice.  I used goat cheese and my husband used feta cheese, both of which were good substitutes.  The dish is such a lovely presentation and I almost hated to mess it up by eating it, but so glad I did.

I use pepper jack cheese and increase the broth then thicken just a bit with cornstarch and serve this over Penne pasta! I also almost completely cooked my chicken before adding the broth. Was quicker and I was sure the chicken was completely done.

I made this using 1lb chicken breast tenderloin.  I cooked the chicken in a skillet with some olive oil.  I put some balsamic vinegar and minced garlic (more then the recipe states) in with the cooking chicken.  After I added the other ingredients I added more balsamic and some garlic powder.  At the end i added some corn starch for thickening.  The recipe as written would not be well seasoned.  It needs the additional flavors that I added. I give the recipe 4 stars as written.  I would give it 5 stars with the tweaks.

Delicious! I followed the recipe, only adding a few more garlic gloves, a bit more broth as the chicken and veggies cooked, a shallot, some olives and some feta cheese that I had on hand in addition to the mozzarella. I love one skillet dishes! Definitely will be making it again.

I enjoyed this, although I improvised a lot because I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used Better than Bullion instead of chicken stock and I didn't have any roasted red peppers (and was too lazy to roast the fresh peppers I had) so I just threw chopped red peppers in.  Also, I added some thyme and used grated asiago cheese because I didn't have any mozzarella.  THe flavors tasted fantastic together, I was really pleased.  Especially since it didn't require a lot of work on my part to make this dish, it just sort of cooked itself and I was able to do other things while it was going.  I'll definitely make this recipe again!  Adding it to my recipe box as we speak :D

chicken was so tender, but only cooked for abt 5 min before adding veggies, used Heirloom cherry tomatoes instead of Roma, seasoned with Italian seasoning, and Quatro Formaggio instead of mozzarella.  Also added pine nuts and used Penne.  delish!

Loved this recipe. I used mushroom base instead of chicken broth to add another layer of flavor.  I also used chicken tenders for ease and substituted Parmesan Reggiano  cheese for the mozzarella.

Boreingggg.. I thought it was bland, needs more. Followed the recipe exactlly, chicken was tough, way over done by the time the asparagus was tender. We cld'nt tell that the peppers were roasted, so for a cheaper verson id use fresh red pepper, or yellow for more color. On the plus, it was easy.

Mmmmmm! Hubby and I both LOVED this one. My only changes were: a bit more balsamic and I covered the pan as I cooked it (just added more chicken broth as needed.) Next time I will try cutting the chicken into cubes or taking someone else's advice by adding basil or serving in a tortilla. Great easy dish!

I was skeptical, but the chicken turned out really juicy and I actually enjoyed the asparagus cooked this way!  I normally do not like asparagus.

Yummy! Just a  couple of minor changes starting with topping with Feta cheese, great flavor! Also used Rotel instead of Romas as that was all I had. Also, did not have fresh asparagus so used canned and it was DELUXE!

This recipes was excellent.  I made it for my boyfriend with a few minor changes.  He asked when I could make it again. I was worried about the chicken being bland so I pan friend it in some butter and white cooking wine and roasted garlic.  I served it with couscous. AWESOME!!

I served this dish over sun-dried tomato cous-cous.    Changes I made:  Rubbed the chicken breasts with a poultry rub and sauteed that one side before placing in the broth.  These lent to more flavor, better texture, and a huge improvement in visual appeal.  I also had to use 2 cups of broth (made from bouillion cubes)...had I not, the liquid would have completely boiled down.  I added it as necessary.  I also added extra minced garlic, 1 tbl of dried basil, and 1 tbl crushed red pepper flakes.  Additional comments:  LOVED the balsamic vinegar.  Since it was not specified in the recipe, I added it on top of the chicken/asparagus after I had plated it and then added the cheese.  I thought the balsamic vinegar added a wonderful "layer" to the flavors.    We will make this again.

Absolutely delicious.  I forgot to pick up fresh tomatoes so I opted for a small can of diced tomatoes.  I sauteed some onions and mushrooms in Smart Balance spread (rather than butter) and balsamic vinegar and served them on the side, but we ended up mixing everything together so I may add directly into the mix next time.  Sauce is very flavorful but thin.  Everything (including a few spoons of the the sauce served on top of brown rice... well, what else can I say except... YUM!

Very impressive-looking for how little work it is. Beautiful colours and the balsamic adds great flavour. The chicken didn't come out as tender as I would have liked, so next time I'm going to cut it into thinner pieces for reduced cooking time. Definitely add more broth to be able to enjoy the delicious sauce.

This was EXCELLENT, delicious and beautiful.  I used canned diced tomatoes with chipolte which I'm sure gave it added zing.  Put it on a platter, sprinkled with cheddar cheese and drizzled it with the balsamic vinegar.  We felt like we were in a fancy restaurant.  Can't wait to fix it for guests.

I altered this recipe a bit.  I had to continuously add more chicken broth and I also threw in a yellow bell pepper along with a red, and rather than using roma tomatoes (didn't have them on hand), I used a can of petite diced stewed tomatoes with green chilis.  I also used shredded cheddar cheese rather than mozarella (again I used what I had) This was insanely good and one of the family favorites.  The cheese and balsamic vinegar really gave great flavor to the veggies.

This recipe is fantastic! I wish I could have used the balsamic vinegar (my boyfriend doesn't like it) and I prefered it without the tomatoes, I made double and brought it to work for lunch. It was just as delicious as for dinner. I'm in Italy and on the south beach diet, which is difficult because of the different food they have here. This was easy because I can find everything here since it's all fresh!

Very tasty.  I seasoned the chicken with a little garlic pepper before cooking in the broth.  I waited until the last 3-4 minutes to add the asparagus so it was crisp-tender.  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes.

Absolutely Delicious!!  I doubled the garlic and used substantially more chicken stalk as it evaporated quickly.  I also ended up covering it as the liquid cooked off too quickly.  I sprinkled with parmasean at the end. vs. mozzarella.  This was a huge hit with my husband too-  We can't wait to eat it al fresco with a big loaf of crusty bread and a glass of Cotes du Rhone- this dish is fabulous!

I've only made this once so far, and it was delicious! My only problem was the sogginess of the leftovers. I think perhaps next time I'll separate the veggies and chicken before refrigerating.

This recipe was a huge hit with the family, who marvelled at how moist the chicken breast was, and the great melding of flavors. I love that it's healthful, requires no oil to cook, and has loads of veggies. I cooked it with chicken breast tenders, and cooked it for less time in more broth. I also added white wine for flavor. Thanks for this recipe, I am always looking for healthy recipes and new ways to cook chicken breasts, and this will be a new family favorite.

This is great!  I didn't have roasted tomatoes so I used sun dried instead.  I skipped the cheese topping and this dish was so good, I wanted to lick my plate.  This is good enough for dinner guests, for sure!

I made this for my Boyfriend and we both LOVED IT - made enough for 4 and there isn't any left!!!  

I made a few changes - based on other recommendations as well as our own preferences....
* bought sweet roasted red peppers that were packaged in canola oil with spicy red peppers (zip!) - after removing the peppers, I reused that oil to brown the chicken (also "marinated" cubed chicken with extra chili pepper flakes and some oil)
* used 4 cloves garlic (1 clove with oil/chicken and 3 with veggies)
* used 'herbed' chicken broth (Campbells)
* Biggest change - instead of mozzarella I used goat cheese (with pepper-corn)

The tastes blended magically, not bland at all, and my BF is a spicy food fanatic, while I'm not, and it was perfect for both of us. Served with chicken flavour rice (uncle bens)

THIS IS A KEEPER recipe! BF said it was the best dinner he has had in months! I agree! :)

I just made this dish and couldn't believe how easy and quick it was, besides being healthy.  I served it with orzo on the side.  I used the recommended 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar.  Next time, I'll make it two.  Definitely a winner!

If youre looking for a way to add flavor to this one, grill the chicken separately, then add to the meal and heat through. I like to add Mccormick steak seasoning to the chicken to really kick it up. This is one of our favs and an awesome low-cal meal.

This didn't do it for me.  Yes, it is very healthy, I guess I don't care much for poached chicken.  And the cooking time is way too long for a chicken breast.  I cooked them for maybe 5 minutes before adding the asparagus not 15 minutes as stated in the recipe.  I won't be making this again.

This recipe was fantastic!  I pounded the chicken breasts and lightly dredged them in flour first.  I sauteed them in olive oil and followed the recipe according to directions.  Added a bit more chicken broth and garlic.  The blend of flavors was so good (and colorful!) that I think I'll skip the cheese next time.  The whole family loved it - even our resident asparagus-hater.  We'll have this again.  Thanks!

Except for adding a little extra garlic, I followed this recipe exactly.  I thought it tasted only "ok", but rated it 4 stars because it was easy, nutritious, colorful, and the children liked it!  I may make this again, only substitute canned artichokes for the asparagus.

I thought this was very delicious! I don't care for tomatoes so I left them out and accidentally forgot the vinegar. Then I added fresh basil because I had some left over and it was a perfect compliment. I did get nervous at how cooked down the chicken broth was so I added a tablespoon more a couple of times.  Served it on a bed of wild & brown rice for a flavorful and healthy meal. There was a lot of cheese, so cutting back on that would save on calories and saturated fat.

Excellent!  Fresh flavors that I served over angel hair pasta. I kept an eye on the broth and just added as needed.

Wow, was this ever good.  Fixed this last night using a left over chicken breast. Since the chicken was already cooked I cubed it and added it the last five minutes of cooking the asparagus and peppers.  Served it over linguini.

I made this dish with fresh green beans instead of asparagus, because I am not paying 4.99 a pound for it and having to throw half of it away because they were so woody.  It was great.  I did add some cornstarch to thicken it a little and I used parmasean instead of mozzarella just because I had it on hand.  I would also liked to have sprinkle it with a tad bit of fresh basil, but I didnt have any.

Loved it-left the tomatoes out by mistake, and did add a bit of olive oil to help the garlic and asparagus cook (put chicken in oven to warm while veggies cooked)-definitely will make again

My fiancé and I really enjoyed this dish.  We both love spicy/extra seasoned food, so we took advice of other readers and added basil and 3 small chopped chipotle peppers.  We served it over brown rice and it was delicious!!  The low calorie/high protein count makes it all the better!

Wasn't super thrilled with this recipe. It was too bland. I increased the vinegar to 3 tsp, and it was better. Chicken was tough. Next time I might use tenders instead of breast.

Great use of fresh ingredients for a simple and delicious meal! I added a little more garlic, and topped with feta instead of mozzarella, which added a great flavor. Definitely will be making it again!

I followed the basics. Tweeks - 1. pounded and marinated chicken breast in a little lemon, oregano, garlic and pepper. 2.browned chicken in some olive oil spray (spray the chicken, not the pan)over med-high until just barely done (it should be soft to the touch). 3.removed chicken (keep warm) and added 1 c low-salt broth (a little white wine if you can spare some), asparagus (green beans are an economical substitute), peppers, green onion - all cut into 1 1/2" pieces, and of course more garlic, 4. cooked covered on med-high for 3-4 minutes (watch it and add broth as needed you want this to be kind of soupy.  5. Now here's the secret ingredients - stir in 2 tsp (or more to taste) anchovy paste and 2 tablespoons of capers. It gives incredible depth to the dish and the desirable umami flavor through out.   6. Added chopped tomato with juices (I used one medium tomato per chicken breast - you want this real juicy) 7. Return chicken to pan and let everything heat thru. 7. added white balsamic and salt to taste.  I find it doesn't need much if any salt. 8. Serve in bowl with crusty bread to sop up the juices.

This was delicious!! Super easy & quick. A few of you complained that the broth evaporated before everything was done- I had no problems, so you might need to cut your chicken into smaller pieces (not do a solid breast) and/or turn the heat down. I added onions to mine & served it with some delicious Risotto.  Plates were cleaned, so it will definitely be made again:-)

This was very easy and very tasty! I cooked up all the broth and had to add a little extra. Forgot to but roasted peppers so broiled afresh pepper in a pinch and added it in. My husband and I ate everything. The balsamic and cheese really did the trick! Adding to my recipe book.

My family loved this recipe! Our picky 14 yr. old even ate his asparagus! I followed the recipe almost exactly, however covered the skillet and lowered heat for the last 5 minutes before adding tomatoes. I also used an additional teaspoon of vinegar. Served over a cup of brown rice. I will definitely save this to our recipes!

Oh SO delicious!!!!!! I used a whole can of low sodium chicken broth and fresh peppers (that's what I had on hand). I also used two extra cloves of garlic then served over pasta. It was extremely flavorful and simple to put together. A great one-pot dish that's healthy, yummy and beautiful. This will definitely be one of our go-to meals from now on.

Loved this recipe for the ease and for the wonderful flavor.  My entire family loved it even the one who is not a big red pepper person.  Definitely a repeat at our house.

Not bad, not good.  Took several reviewers recs and added more garlic, chix broth, seasoning, etc., and it still had no flavor.  BORING.  If it hadn't been for the vinegar, there would have been almost no flavor. Could probably be tweaked to be good, and maybe some day I'll try, but then it won't be this recipe anymore.

Very easy, great flavor.  I used 2 cubes of chicken broth, added 1/2 t of thyme. Used can of diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro (Ro*Tell).  Used Laughing Cow Herb&Garlic triangles instead of mozzarella. My husband, who usually says things are okay, said this was pretty good!

This is needed a little more flavor.. we added crushed red pepper for a little kick but it was still missing something. We made rice a roni and mixed it all together and that helped the blandness.

Great recipe, and looks fantastic! I sliced the chicken breast (stretches it out further - I probably had a higher ratio of veggies), and I did saute it in a bit of olive oil, and added some cooking wine instead of the chicken broth. I also added mushrooms to the veggies. The balsamic vinegar added great flavor, and the cheese sprinkled on top is perfect!

This was excellent - and so healthy. I made a few changes, so I could use up produce on hand, like fresh red peppers, Beefsteak tomatoes, and a few fresh mushrooms. We served it over rice and will be amking it again.

Quick, easy one dish meal -- very tasty!  I didn't have any tomatoes on hand so I used a can of crushed tomatoes and it was fine.  Also added another 1/2 cup of broth when I added the asparagus.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I sliced the chicken into strips and rubbed it with Kitchen Bouquet (a good trick to give chicken more flavor).  Otherwise prepared as written.  Was not at all dry.  Served over the Cheesy Polenta from this site.  Yummy! Added note: Prepared again, this time with diced Italian tomatoes, Cavenders, extra garlic & mushrooms.  Served over angel hair.  Even yummier!

YUM!! I think this may be my new favorite meal! Definitely restaurant quality!! I did make a few changes though…I dipped 1 pound of thin cut chicken breasts in flour which I seasoned with seasoned salt and fresh pepper. I had to cook my chicken in 2 batches (there was not enough room in my pan) so I used about 2 cups of chicken broth total…the flour seemed to soak up the broth so as I turned the chicken I added more. When the chicken was done I removed it from the pan and added the garlic (3 cloves) and veggies. I let them cook for about 3 minutes and then placed the chicken breasts on top of the veggies, covered and let simmer until the asparagus was tender, topped with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and lots of mozzarella cheese and covered until the cheese was melted. I can’t wait to eat the leftovers today for lunch!

Just OK.  Took longer to cook chicken than the recipe indicated.  Needed additional garlic and salt to give it some flavor.  Will not make this again.

This was OK, but not great.  Maybe it's because I just don't enjoy roasted red peppers from a jar - they seem kind of slimy.  I might try it with just fresh red peppers.

I had high hopes for this one as we love chicken and asparagus but it was not that good and I wouldn't make it again.  Sorry I bought the fresh asparagus and the roasted peppers and put them in this recipe.  They would've done much better on their own as a side dish.

This recipe was great!  My husband and I both loved it and thought the flavors went wonderfully together.  The only thing I did differently was to add some chopped fresh basil and a little more broth while cooking.  Keep a close eye on the asparagus to keep it from getting overdone.

I had to use 16oz of chicken broth.  It seemed like it evaporated every time I turned around.  I must say the aroma was incredible!  I wasn't totally blown away by the taste, but it could be because I had to use so much broth.  My husband thought it was great and didn't notice the peppers (he hates them).   

Made it again today (7/1/08) - used the right amount of chicken broth and just added garlic powder.  Very good!  Loved it!

This is supper yummy. I made the recipe with only few altercations, I only had boneless skinless thights added a little more garlic and topped with chedar only because I didn't have any white cheese in the house. This is exceptional. I served over 1/2 Carb penne pasta. Will do over and over.

This recipe was just stunning, especially given how good it is for you.  I was in a rush when serving, so I completely forgot the vinegar and cheese, and it was still great!  I used organic chicken, which I think may have made the chicken ever more flavorful and moist.

I took others advice on this one, to many good tips not to. Browned the chicken, added chopped onion, extra garlic & a bit more spice. served over orzo. Tender & flavorful I did use chicken tenderloins & they came out perfect. Pretty easy, & I'd make it again. Thanx to everyone for the good suggestions.

Made this at the Firehouse!  The guys loved it.  Used chicken pieces and browned it first before adding chix broth.  Served it with Risotto.  Really easy.  Will make again.

Excellent!  What a great dinner to have when you've worked all day and don't feel much like cooking - it's easy and quick and very delicious.  I made it last night and served with brown rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought that this was one of the best recipes my family has tried so far.  My children were a little fussy about the asparagus, but soon came to like it.  I did not have roasted red peppers, so I used fresh red peppers instead.  This is a very pretty dish and I will use often.

Great recipe!  Quick, easy and very tasty.  My 5 year old loves it.  The only thing that I do different is cube the chicken to bite size pieces prior to cooking it.  YUMMMMY!!

Excellent!  I took the advise of an earlier reviewer and just prepare the chicken in olive oil rather than using the chicken broth.  This was very easy to prepare-will definately make again.

Easy, tasty, and healthy! We roasted our own red peppers to avoid the fat from the oil in pre-made roasted red pepper jars. We also used provalone cheese instead of mozzarella for more flavour.  Highly recommended!

This was delicious!  My boyfriend does not care for chicken breasts (says they are always dry) but he actually said that he liked this!!  The chicken was very moist.  One thing I did a little different was that I covered it when I first put the veggies in for about 10 minutes.  (Don't know if this helped to seal in more moisture or not.)  I also added a bit of white wine to the chicken broth, as others had recommended.  

I will definitely make this one again!

I am trying to find healthier, low-calorie meals to make.  I made this last night and was pleasantly surprised at how good tasting it was!  I did double the amount of chicken broth, based on other comments and I also covered the pan during the 15 minutes while the chicken was cooking.  Other changes:  I doubled the amount of garlic and increased the amount of both asparagus (I had a 10 oz package) and roasted peppers (I had a 12 oz jar).   I will definitely make this again!

Made with wild cherry tomatoes and added basil, but otherwise kept to the recipe. I'm glad I made extra - my husband and I are both looking forward to leftovers.  We will definitely put this in our rotation.

5 stars except I changed it up a bit with extra butter and garlic, rice wine vinegar to deglaze the pan-baked chicken after poaching it.  The roux was super flavorful and strong- used heavy cream to soften it. Love that it didn't use any spices! Thank you for sharing this delight!

It needed more flavor, so I added juice from 1/2 lemon, zest, and a bit of cayenne.

Next time I'll skip the tomatoes and add broccoli instead. Roasted the peppers on the barby. Delicious.

Wow, with a few mods this is awesome. Following a few others ideas like thinly slicing 4 cloves of garlic then cut them in half, finely diced 1/3 onion. Sauted both if those in 1 1/2 T olive oil for 2 - 3 minutes. Sliced 2 chicken breasts in 1/2 inch slices then turned up heat to med high and cooked until no longer pink. Added the chopped roasted peppers and 2 T juice  and chopped stems of asparagus (cut about 1 1/2 in.), with 3/4 C chicken broth and 2 t. flavored butter .  Cooked  about 5 mins, then added asparagus tops and tomatoes cooked for 2 mins. Added 1 more t. flavored butter at end. Served over angle hair pasta, unbelievable flavor and light sauce.

This is a very filling and tasty healthy meal.  I have made it twice and word of caution.  The first time I used roasted chipotle peppers and that IS NOT the same as roasted red peppers.  LOL  The first time I wasn't able to review as I couldn't taste anything for several hours, my own fault.  When I made it last night with the correct peppers we have decided that not only is it a tasty meal but also very great for presentation which makes it that much more filling.

I roasted a fresh red pepper instead of using canned ones but otherwise followed the recipe. The flavors were ok, but boiling the chicken in broth resulted in poor texture and dry chicken, and the asparagus was a bit over-cooked (we don’t like ours mushy). I should have known better, but the ratings were great so I just followed the recipe... bad idea.

This was enjoyed by all my family.  Easy to make and we found it to be very tasty.  I doubled (or more) the chicken broth as suggested by another cook and used fresh red peppers. Delicious!

Excellent flavor and super easy. I added more garlic, vinegar, and cheese than called for, and served over quinoa. Like others mentioned, I needed a little extra stock too.

I followed the advice of others and browned the chicken in olive oil for a few minutes before adding the chicken broth.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  My boyfriend loved it, saying it tasted like it came from a fancy restaurant.  I will definitely make it again  !!

I made this w/o many changes except I used red peppers and a few onions that I cooked till soft.   A very flavorful dish and just as good for leftovers.

The recipe was a little bland for our taste.  I added some Italian season at the end.  Also, I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes.  Still a great recipe.  Everyone loved it.  We  will definitely make this again.

Great starter recipe - a bit bland, so I added more garlic and a little crushed red pepper - otherwise I'd make it again... Nice and light!

It's okay. I serve it tonight (New Year's Eve) for my husband & I. I cut the chicken in strips. I overcooked it. I served it over wheat pasta. Next time more garlic & a little more balsamic.

This was so yummy. We don't care for balsamic so I used garlic vinegar. I also used halved cherry tomatoes. It had so much flavor and the asparagus was excellent.

This was really a very light refreshing dish.  I loved the fresh asparagus in it, and I made it with brown rice on the side and we all enjoyed it.  I used more balsamic then the recipe called for, but I love balsamic vinegar.  Will for sure make this again!!!

This was excellent! We used almost twice as much veggies, garlic and vinegar as the recipe specified, though. And we cubed the chicken so it didn't have to cook so long and would mix up better. It was delicious and will make it into our menu book. Thanks!! Sometime we might try it with a bit of cooked pasta mixed in for a one-pot, standalone meal.

Fantastic and supper easy! I subbed in snow peas and one fresh red pepper for the veggies because that's what I had in the fridge, and it was still fantastic.  You just pop the chicken in the broth (low sodium) and let it cook while you work on a side dish and the veggies.  I had a meal on the table in 30 minutes, and the flavors were superb together! Served with some out-of-the-box parmesan risotto, and it was great.

Amazing dish! It tastes great, looks great and is quite simple to make.  Next time I decide to make this I think I'll leave out the salt though. I used low sodium broth and it was still a bit salty for my taste.  Over all it was an excelent meal that I will definately make again. Thanks for sharing :)  ps; The only cheese I had on hand was an Italian mix with asiago and it went well with this dish.

I cut the chicken in thin slices (makes it easier for my husband who has Parkinsons) and sauted it quickly in a little olive oil.  I then added the broth and proceeded with step two of the recipe.  I covered the skillet while cooking, about 10 min, and it came out perfectly.  Served it over pasta.  For our taste, I will add a little more garlic and some basil next time.  I have fresh asparagus and this is definitely a recipe I will use again and again.

A winner at our house!  I first pound the chicken tender and even then cook with slightly more broth. The flavors are perfect however I do add a bit more balsamic vinegar at the end.  We like it tossed with tortellini!  A definite keeper!!

By far my favorite recipe!!  Cut the chicken up before you add all the asparagus and it is wonderful.  You can add some mushrooms and rotel tomatoes as well for a fast, tasty, healthy meal.  I've made this 3 times in the past two weeks and will be making it again in a few days....I can't get enough!!

Delicious!  Will definitely make again!  I didn't have time to marinate for 30 minutes - they still turned out very flavorful.  I had to substitute a few ingredients but it still turned out awesome and so pretty!  Served it over leftover chinese white rice; the next day ate it over a salad at lunch time.

This recipe has very good flavor and as others have suggested, the balsamic vinegar is essential. I added both more of the vinegar and approx 5 cloves of garlic smashed and chopped. I also had 2 lbs of chicken breast.  One suggestion though, when sauteing the chicken in the broth not only add more broth but 1/2 the cooking time or your chicken will be tough. It is a husband pleaser, quick,{especially if you cut up the veggie ingredients ahead of time}, and I will definitely try this again.

This was so healthy and delicious. Had to add a little more chicken broth. Even my children scarfed it down. I will happily add this to recipes that will be made more than once in out home. This will be great to make on super hot summer days as its the kind of meal that wont drag you down.

Way better than I expected. I didn't have any tomatoes, used way more garlic and asparagus than called for but it was still great. Edit- nothing exciting actually. It didn't reheat well.

This recipe is awesome!  I added portabella mushrooms, extra chicken broth and used cooked chicken from a whole chicken that I had de-boned.  It came out great.   I cooked up some egg noodles and topped it off with the Chicken with Asparagus and it was great.  I also used just a little Six Italian Cheese on the top.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

I added a lot of garlic to this recipe as per other reviewers suggestions, but this still turned out extremely bland.  Both my husband and I gave it a thumbs down.

Although I have 3 children, they have quite sophisticated palates.  Everyone thought the chicken was bland.  I may experiment to figure out what can be done to give the recipe the right kick.  I even followed others suggestions for more flavor.  Can't imagine how bland it might have been otherwise.

Delicious!  The balsamic vinegar is key.  I made this in January, when fresh tomatoes taste like cardboard, so I used a half can of diced roasted tomatoes with garlic.  It worked well, but I'm looking forward to trying this again in the summer with fresh tomatoes.

This is fantastic!  You can make it exactly as described and it will come out perfectly.  We are big veggie eaters in my house so I doubled the amount of asparagus and tomatoes and put a few more red peppers in and it was perfect for us. A keeper in my kitchen!

I wasn't expecting much from this dish, being that its just so easy. But there's something about the combination of everything that made this dish ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I rarely make a dish on a regular basis, but this is such a delicious, nutritious and economical dinner that I'm sure to make again and again!

Very very good. The only change I had to make was used canned diced red tomatoes instead of roma since I was out, and used 2 garlic cloves since we love garlic.  I added in recipe box in March 2006 and finally made it today.  Can't believe I waited this long for such a gread dish!

I roasted red peppers from my garden and added two diced, roasted red chile peppers as well - added a nice bite to the dish.  Added a little extra chicken stock at the beginning, at the recommendation of another reviewer, which worked well.  Served it over rotini pasta - my family loved it.

This was very tasty when served over jasmine rice. I also used 1 cup chicken broth. Also, I used three cloves of garlic and threw in a couple of dashes of dried basil. Tasty and easy weeknight dinner, thanks!

This recipe was outstanding. I didn't need to change a thing! I am going to make it again this weekend because after eating it, we want it again. I added more chicken stock as I went along because I wanted more of a sauce, but that was personal preference. yum yum!

This recipe was very good and I plan on making it again! The only thing I did different was added a little more garlic like others recommended and added onions and used fresh red peppers instead of canned...very yummy

Mmmmmm good! I used a jar of marinated red peppers, added a little more garlic, Italian seasoning and a can of stewed tomatoes instead of roma.

I loved this and it was a huge hit at the table!  I used parmesan cheese and added more aspargus and roasted red pepper since I didn't figure it'd hurt.  I also used more broth and a little white wine than the recipe called for.  I'll make it again!

Love this recipe! I cooked it about a year ago, and loved it. I was looking at this recipe again and I seem to remember baking it in the oven instead of stove top. Has this been revised?
Either way, it's a great dish!!
Thanks!

This was really, really good!  The only changes I made were to add 2 T. of butter to the chicken broth, more balsamic vinegar (cause we love it) - maybe 2 T., and a little grated parmesan before adding the mozzarella.  My husband using his finger to scrape up the left-over sauce, and he was a little miffed that I had only made enough for the two of us!  I think, even with the added butter and parmesan, this is a very healthy dish, and will make it's way into our permanent rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was good but not great. I guess I had expected alot more with the high rating.  I agree with another poster that the veggies would have been good as just a side dish and left out the chicken.  I will probably make again with just veggies as a side dish.

Quick, easy and absolutely delicious. I didn't have any chicken broth on hand so I used a half of a chicken bouillon cube with the water instead and it was great.

This was good but not as great as I thought it would be.  Maybe next time I will add the cheese (which I omitted this time) and cook the veggies a little less, they were a little soggy. I will definitely do this one again.

Four stars because my husband really liked this dish.  I thought it was just o.k.  I used 2 cups of ck broth instead of 1/2 cup, like others and served it over white rice. I will make it again and try it with pasta next time.  I also drizzled more balsamic vinegar on mine.  Still not quite enough of a kick for my liking. I'll add red pepper flakes next time and maybe some italian seasoning.

I thought this was great, my husband just rated it average (hence the 4 stars).  I followed the recipe with a few minor changes: diced chicken prior to cooking and seasoned with a Garlic and Wine spice (from the Melting Pot) instead of S&P, doubled the broth, added a little cornstarch dissolved in cold water to thicken the sauce.  The vinegar added a nice tang, and overall I think the flavors worked very well together.

This was a good recipe for us.  I sliced the chicken breasts and they cooked up much quicker than the recipe indicated. :)  I couldn't find roasted red peppers, so I tried a few chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (with the sauce rinsed off).  It made it quite spicy and my husband liked it.  I will keep looking for roasted red peppers.  The asparagus blended nicely with it, too. I might try serving this over rice or noodles next time, too...  Thanks!

Tastes delicious.  Definitely a keeper.  I needed about 2 cups of stock.  I had to keep adding so that it wouldnt cook dry.  I also think it tasted better without the splash of vinegar.

I was hoping to love this recipe with all the rave reviews, but even with 3 cloves garlic, sauteing the chicken first with salt and grill seasoning and a bit of cayenne, more balsamic and roasting my own bell peppers, it still seemed lacking in flavor.  I may try it again though cause the 9 and 6 year old ate it and said it was a keeper...

This is by far my FAVORITE new recipe. I was a little skeptical that it might be a little bland but I am SOOOO impressed. Changes I Made: 3 or 4 garlic cloves, 1 c. Chicken Broth, A pinch of red pepper flakes and using garlic salt for seasoning instead of regular salt.

For being so healthy it was AWESOME. The picky boyfriend had two servings.

Ten minutes was too long for my asparagus! I prefer it tender-crisp so next time I'll only cook it about 5 minutes and then add the tomatoes. Maybe go a little longer on the first step to compensate. This also could have used a pinch of red pepper flakes.

Delicious!  It wasn't until I looked at the final dish that I realized this is a very similar dish to my favorite frozen entree from Lean Cuisine.  I will definitely be making this again - and will probably add artichoke hearts (as suggested by another reviewer) or serve over pasta.  Thanks for sharing!

This tasted great. We are not tomatoe or red papper lovers, so I did not use red peppers, and used Sun Dried Tomatoes instead of the tomatoes shown. Used 2 garlic gloves, and Cajun seasoning & garlic salt as seasonings. My husband loved it!  Will add mushrooms next time.

Followed the recipe exactly. Found that chicken broth was gone by the time the chicken breasts were done (15 min) Necessary to add more of the same. Overall, the dish was good, chicken was moist but it could have used more spice to liven up the flavor. Good reduced calorie meal.
Had it again, no change. Girlfriend gave it a 5*...............moves it from 3* to 4*.

Absolutely delicious, especially for a low cal, low fat recipe. My husband loved it too. I used a roasted chicken from the grocery, and added extra roasted red peppers and asparagus. Next time I will add fresh mushrooms. Thanks for the healthy recipe!!

Really yummy. Put 2 tablespoons of Balsamic. And added Italian seasoning. Served over rice. But would be good over pasta.

I am thrilled with this recipe - quick and tasted great!  I'm always looking for something I can throw together at the last minute and be happy to serve to anyone who may come in.  I always make a dish exactly as written the first time and tweak it to our taste after that, this recipe won't need that!  I didn't measure the ingredients exactly, just pulled them off the shelves and "eye-balled" it.  Over rice was great, pasta would be wonderful.  You may want to add more broth if you prefer a moister starch.  I'll be sharing this with family & friends!

Just when I thought there was nothing  I hadn't already done with chicken...this found its way to my email, and what a delight it was tonight! I didn't have any jarred roasted red peppers so I made a few fresh ones on the burner real quick...just as good in my book as if I'd used the ready-made variety.  Thanks for such a colorful, flavorful recipe!!

MMmmmmmm!! I cut the recipe in half and used one chicken breast, chopped up- I cooked it in the broth and drizzled w/honey, sprinkled w/salt & pepper. I think I probably used more tomato than called for, and I added the balsamic twice (once to the chicken while cooking, then more again just before adding the cheese) for a stronger flavor.  I can't wait to try it with other veggies and with homemade roasted red pepper!

I think this recipe is very good. However, I have made some changes. I use a whole can of chicken broth and cook the asparagus until slightly tender.Then I take the asparagus out ans set aside. Then I place the chicken in the remaining broth and season with what feels right that night (rosemary goes well). Then I pretty much follow the recipe as follows. I drain any extra juice at the end, then throw the cheese on. If you like your asparagus more on the crisp side, follow the recipe.

This recipe is REALLY good. Next time I'll probably slice the chicken into strips just to make it a bit easier to eat. Also, the broth evaporated pretty quickly so I poured in about a 1/2 cup of white wine to continue cooking the chicken. I also added 2 diced Serrano peppers in with the asparagus since I like things spicy.  Lastly, I used about twice the amount of roasted peppers since I love those... and it was a wonderful dish!!

Used canned asparagus and put it in the last minute just to warm it. Fresh would have been much better, but I didn't have any. The balsamic is an excellent flavor addition. Served with rosemary baby red potatoes. Will make again with fresh asparagus.

Even my tomato-hating husband loved this one. He's on low-carb, me low-fat - it worked for both. And the 11-year-old picky eater asked for seconds. I used regular Rotel tomatoes for an extra kick. Will definitely make again.

This is one of the best recipes I have found on this site.  After reading the reviews, I wanted to try it but I wasn't sure I was going to like it.  I browned the chicken breasts in a little olive oil before cooking in the broth and I also increased the garlic to 4 cloves and the vinegar to about 3 or 4 tsps.  My husband loved it too.  I will 
definitely be making this again.  It is good enough for company.

This was good and easy to prepare.  I made a few changes.  I made my own roasted red peppers by sauteing some fresh peppers I had on hand in olive oil and garlic.  I also started the chicken breasts in olive oil and garlic before adding the broth.  I used thin chicken cutlets which greatly reduced cooking time.  I used low-fat mozarella as well.  It was very filling for such a low fat/calorie meal!  I served with a side of brown rice.

A very tasty dish with asparagus. I skipped the mozzarella cheese to keep it on the lighter side and used canned stewed tomatoes since i didn't have any fresh ones -- it was still delicious and easy! Oh yeah, I used a reviewers suggestion to add some cayenne pepper, too.

This recipe was scrumptious!  I added a little more chicken broth than was called, and since I like a little "kick" to my food, I sprinkled it with cayenne pepper while the veggies were cooking.  I also served this dish over brown rice.  It helped to soak up some of the flavors.

This recipe was very good. I changed a few things though. I roasted the asparagus with garlic separately and kept it as a side. I also added alot more garlic to the chicken. I also made it with coucous as a side. Very figure friendly and delicous. I will definitely make it again.

Very good!  A keeper for sure.  I had to add more chicken broth to it as the chicken cooked.  Next time I'm putting in more vegetables along with some mushrooms and onion.

My 13 year old son and I loved it!  I'm a garlic lover so next time I'll add lots more.  No other changes necessary for me.  Thanx a bunch for sharing the recipe!

Wow!  That was yummy.  We served with Pasta Roni Angel Hair Pasta with Parmesan Cheese.  It was a huge hit!

This is a terrific dish.  I changed it a little by cutting the chicken up into bite size chunks since I have three toddlers.  This greatly reduces the cooking time (almost by half).  Everyone in my family raved about this recipe and the kids didn't even care they were eating asparagus!

The chicken was amazingly tender and juicy, next time I will add red pepper flakes and brown before poaching. Next time I  will try a different vegetable other than asparagus (personal preference). Overall a very quick, easy and healthy meal. Thanks.

Very easy and good.  I cooked the chicken in the skillet and removed it.  Then, I added the broth and the other vegetables.  I added mushrooms and used sundried tomatoes, since they were in the cupboard.  I added more chicken broth towards the end of cooking to get more sauce.  Before serving, I added the chicken back in, then served over rice.

This was a surprise of how delicious it was and with so few calories or fat grams!  It was also easy, fast and colorful. I served this with a baked potato but will use either noodles or rice next time.

I wish the sauce was thicker, it was like broth. My husband enjoyed it though, the cheese especially adds. I served it over pasta.

I thought this recipe was just okay.  I added some garlic salt to the chicken and sautéed it in olive oil before poaching it in order to add a little extra flavor, but it still tasted kind of blah to me.  The asparagus also didn’t taste like much, although that may have been my fault inasmuch as I steamed the asparagus before adding it to the chicken mixture and I think that took a lot of the flavor away.  I must say though that the red peppers and tomatoes tasted wonderful with the garlic/chicken broth mixture, and if I can figure out a way to make this dish a little more flavorful I will probably try it again.

This was pretty good.  I did have to substitute green beans for asparagus so that may have taken away some of the overall flavor.  Will try again.

I used broccolli instead, steamed for a few minutes till crisp tender. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was great. Even my kids loved it!

FANTASTIC!  This recipe was excellent.  I forgot to add the cheese at the end and it was still phenominal. I can't imagine cheese making it any better. And THAT is saying something because I love cheese.
