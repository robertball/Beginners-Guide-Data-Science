We really enjoyed this! I did use my own roasted peppers rather than the jar/canned version. I also skipped the cottage cheese (as I knew my Italian hubby would not approve). I was in a hurry to get dinner on the table tonight so after draining the pasta I just tossed it right with the alfredo/veggie mixture and skipped the baking. I served it with some crusty bread sliced tomatoes and fresh basil! Yum! My whole family enjoyed it!

This was a big hit I excluded the mushrooms because my son doesn't like mushrooms but it was delicious topped off with Parmesan cheese

Was looking for a recipe with pasta artichoke and roasted peppers. Like another reviewer I skipped the cottage cheese and baking. I used diced tomatoes instead of the alfredo since I'm lactose intolerant. Came out great!

The vegetable ingredients are supposed to be put into a food processor and pureed to then cook in a pan. After adding the broth sauce and cottage cheese to the cooked vegetable puree you have a creamy but low calorie sauce! You then mix in your pasta and you can bake in a casserole with a little cheese or crumb topping or just simmer in the pan for 10 minutes
