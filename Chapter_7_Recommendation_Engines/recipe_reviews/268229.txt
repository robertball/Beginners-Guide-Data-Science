The recipe was very tasty.  I used no-salt chicken stock and the salt in the can of corn was enough for my husband and me.  The pasta was a bit soggy, perhaps it was because I used whole grain.  I used garbanzo beans instead of white beans which worked out well.  Next time, I think I will use garbanzo beans again, and then use another kind of bean instead of pasta.

This was excellent! I made as directed except that I switched out a carrot for another can of beans due to personal preference. The one thing I will mention is that the zucchini turns to mush and disappears leaving only the skin visually. Not a big deal but seeing how zucchini is bland to me, I'll just leave it out altogether next time.  Great soup and super easy! 5 stars all the way!
