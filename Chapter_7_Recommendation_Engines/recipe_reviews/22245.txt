My husband asks for this!  Try adding a bit of minced garlic to the butter, putting a bit of Greek Seasoning in with the mixture, and topping with whatever kind of cheese is on hand before baking.  It is the perfect "stand-by" budget-wise main dish.  Kudos to Ya-Ya, and thanks for shaking it with us, Nicole!

My family went WILD for this! I am not a very good cook, and the first time I made this, I messed up the recipe a bunch of times and it still tasted DELICIOUS. The second time, I followed the directions perfectly acurately, and it was EVEN BETTER! If you don't taste this dish, there is something wrong with you.

This is fantastic...I have made Sicilian spaghetti and didn't care much for it, so I sort of had that mindset with this recipe, but I changed my tune after one taste...AWESOME! Thanks!

If you use way more oragano, garlic powder, salt, creole seasoning, and powdered parmesan cheese, it's THE BEST!!!!!!!

This is a good recipe when your cupboards are bare and you need to go grocery shopping. I'll be honest - I don't get step 3 where you "brown" the butter. I did it but I felt silly as my microwave looked at me like I was crazy and wondered why I wasn't using him instead...BUT it worked. (or at least...the dish didn't taste bad).  A twist to butter noodles BUT needs some veggies or something for color. Overall - a decent, low-budget lunch. I wouldn't recommend but I can't say it tasted bad either.

This was pretty good.  I added garlic as was suggested in another post and also added shrimp.  I topped it with goat cheese.  Yum!  Hubby liked it and asked for seconds, a true sign of his sincerity.

I thought this recipe sounded a lot better than it actually tastes. The noodles were all stuck together and the cheese would not melt. My husband and kids were not impressed. I thought it was okay, although I would not make again. Thanks anyway!

Everything was soo yummy and perfect before I baked it, the browned butter, smell of oregano and parmesan.  But...when I baked it, it never got bubbly like the recipe said and also dried out a bit.  I didn't use fresh parmesan so that may have made a difference but...it was still tasty!  I will make this again with a few tweaks.

I'm Greek and I have never had spaghetti soooooooo good. I had to substitute the parmesan for orange cheddar cheese because my husband is allergic to parmesan. But oh my, it is so good, it just had to be Greek.
I will be making this forever now, it's a keeper. Thank you.

This was okay but it needed something to give it some more flavor. I only used 3/4 cup of cheese and fresh oregano, which I htink made a big difference. I will make it again, however I will add some garlic to the butter like someone else suggested. It was a fine side dish for our pork roast.

A big hit with my parents, and very easy. I used grated parmesean...was a little coarse. I would reccomend it for someone looking for a quick, tasty pasta dish.

Just ok.  Nothing special. Not a lot of flavor, even when added garlic.  Prefer spaghetti olio aglio (which is with olive oil) over this....tastier and healthier.

Sometimes something simple is just what's needed. This was fast, simple and yet delicious! I used grated parmesan but next time will definitely use the shredded. Otherwis, I went exactly by the recipe. I served it with steamed brocolli florets with butter and salt, and garlic toast. Great for a change, and my Mom loved it!

I made this the other night for my sister and her family. My brother in law just LOVED it. I used an Italian cheese blend and I think that made it a little too dry. Next time I'm going to try myzithra (sp?) cheese like my sister does when she makes a variation of this recipe. I also followed others advice and used a Greek blend seasoning and garlic. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This is more Browned butter & Mazithra cheese recipe, which I love as well.  
When I was growing up my Yiayia (grandmother) would melt butter in a pan.  Once melted add a good portion of "Shaker" parmesan cheese (not fresh as it does not brown the same).  Keep frying & stirring until the cheese browns - you will see a definite change in colour.  Once that is done pour over your pasta.  You can add hot chillies or whatever else you like.  Mmmmm, this has saved many a family meal over multi generations!

Not exactly sure what makes if "Greek."  I topped it with some diced tomatoes, pickles and hot sauce along with a sprinkling of cheese.  As I was cooking for one, I reduced the amounts accordingly.

I also prepared it in a cast-iron skillet which allowed Me to transfer it directly from the stove-top to the oven without having to dirty another pan.

I am only rating this 4 stars because I added to the recipe. I followed the recipe as written except I added minced garlic to the butter and chopped up some marinated artichokes and tomatoes to the pasta.  I also seasoned with a little creole seasoning.  This was really good and I will make it again.

I didn't have oregano so I added tomatoes instead. I also added a slice of Swiss and mozzarella cheese that I broke apart and put on top before placing in the oven. It came out great! My little sister asked for thirds.

Spaghetti was very dry and not tasty. If you do decide to try it plan on adding more ingredients like tomatoes and heavy cream.

It's so simple yet so good! Basic comfort food. My "Ya-Ya" put red pepper flakes in a shaker beside this so you could add them to taste; perfect for us kids!

This was good although when put in the oven there were some parts that came out hard from the cheese.  It did have good flavor (I added minced garlic to the butter) but seemed like alot of butter and was a little greasy.  Will probably make again but maybe add some cream and use less butter just a personal preference.  I would suggest trying it as is first and see what you think then make changes to suite yourself.

Yes!  This is almost the original Alfredo recipe that I use from my Fanny Farmer Cook Book, which was written I think about 100 years ago.  No oregano, half cup butter and the cheese...melt it in cooked fettuccine noodles...and Bob's your uncle you have a sinfully delicious side dish!

i really enjoyed this as well as my family.  It's a great change from having a sauce.  I just used extra cheese.

My husband has a Greek heritage and I remembered he said he liked spaghetti and she put cinnamon on it.  We didn't have a full cup of parmesan and we're just two people anyway so I cut the recipe in half and also added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  It turned out okay, and I liked it will enough but I do think I like tomato sauce much better. Probably just because that's what I grew up with, so the noodles did seem a little bare to me (we like hearty tasty sauces with lots of vegetables too!)  When my husband is able to try it I think that will be a better test for how good it is! ;> Hopefully he will like it and it will bring back nice memories from his childhood!

Well, it's just what you'd think, pasta, butter, cheese. And I am NOT complaining..I really liked it! Good for when you don't feel like having red sauce.  just paired with a good green salad to balance it out.

Very Tasty!!! I loved it. However, I did make a few changes to the recipe. I did not use all the cheese it recomends, I also did not use all the oregano. It tasted very good just the way it is, but I did add some spaghetti sauce at the end. I will definetly make it next time, however I will use less butter, maybe 4 1/2 tablespoons instead of 6.

Sorry, I read the reviews and tried to spice it up a little bit since I was in a pinch, but the family did not care for.  After reading the nutrition facts for this one entree I felt even worse feeding this to my family as a dinner.  Sorry won't be making again.

This recipe came out wonderful!! I looked at the basic recipe and happened to have a bag of Sargento Bistro Cheese in the fridge (a blend of Asiago, Romano and Mozzerella). I did chop 2 cloves of garlic and sauteed them in the butter. I also coated the noodles in the butter sauce and made individual servings quite easily. I have a nephew who doesn't believe it's spaghetti unless it's red, I added spaghetti sauce to his in the layers and he nearly licked the bowl clean! This smelled great while cooking and paired well w/a ceasar salad and garlic bread. Will definately make again even when not in a pinch!

I made this recipe exactly as it said and it was just not what I expected. My husband and kids liked it, but I thought it just had way to much parmesan cheese in it and it was very overpowering. I will not be making this again.
