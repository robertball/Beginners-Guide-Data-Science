I made some slight changes, but this turned out beautifully!  Used less Angel Hair.  2 Tbs Olive Oil, and sauteed some minced garlic, red onion and a full can of (Drained) diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano and basil.  Spiced it up with some Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle (oregano / thyme & basil), S&P, red pepper flakes, and parsley.  Tossed over the noodles and topped with a bit of Parmesan.  Couldn't believe the tomato-hating husband was eating - AND LOVING - it!  Adding this to rotation.

To add more flavor, roast the tomatoes, add a few shakes of crushed red pepper, add a tablespoon of lightly crushed fennel seed, and definitely add parmesan cheese!

I made the recipe as is but after tasting it, I added a little more EVOO, a half teaspoon more of oregano and basil and a half teaspoon of crushed red pepper flake. I liked that this was a quick side to throw together, it paired well with meatloaf.

This was exactly what I was looking for.  A very tasty, light pasta dish.
I had to make one substitution- used one can of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of the fresh.  Very Good Recipe!!! Will make again with the fresh Romas.

I made this recipe for 2 and we both really liked it, although I made several changes.  I used half a pound of pasta (rigatoni), 2 diced roma tomatoes, half of a red onion, twice the amount of basil but same amount of garlic, olive oil & oregano, and then I added salt, black pepper, pine nuts, and shaved parmesan.  We'll definitely make it again!!

This is a fantastic recipe if you are looking for a very basic pasta dish. I do make this often, but I have changed a few things. To start, it needs salt. Without salt, it would be nearly tasteless. Also, it does need more tomatoes, and a little more olive oil than called for. I add the extra oil during cooking so that the flavors have a chance to blend. I also let the mixture simmer longer than called for. I do add different vegetables, depending on what I have on hand. I have used different types of pasta, and have found that my husband and I both prefer angel hair above all others. I now use all ingredients to taste, after having experimented with the recipe quite a bit. In all, it is a good starting point...but it does need a bit of work.

I make a very similar version of this recipe all the time.  It is a staple in my house.  I have added different veggies and meats to mix it up a bit.  Even without additions it is delicious.

Hubs and I both really enjoyed this.  I used orzo rather than the angel hair pasta, only because I never can find enough reasons to use it.  Fresh, clean flavors, excellent side dish for a variety of main dishes.  I used fresh basil (because I had it) and for my tastes, would have preferred this without the oregano, which I thought was just a little heavy and distracting.

My family thought this was very bland. The recipe called for 4 plum tomatoes, I used 6. I also increased the garlic to 5 cloves. I used a large onion and kept the oregano and basil the same as called for. I didn't use the full pound of pasta as it would have been way too dry and not enough tomatoes in it.I sprinkled with extra olive oil before serving. I may try this again as it is an easy recipe, but I will increase all ingredients until I get the right combination and flavor that I think it should have. I really don't know why it had no taste with all of the onion, garlic, etc that is in it.

I did not care for this. It had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. Everything was just bland,. We had to add cream, an additional tomato, double the seasoning, add red wine, and double the garlic.

Great recipe!  I wanted a large dish so I used 5-6 hot house tomatoes (plus 2 small Romas), a full large onion, a full package of fresh basil, and double the oregano.  I also added about 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes which added the perfect kick.

I also make this recipe a lot, but I didn't realize it had a name!

I like to add some white wine, crushed red pepper flakes, and parm cheese to the sauce while it's cooking.  (Also, I leave out the oregano, but that's because I don't like the flavor of it.)

Oh yeah, and sometimes I'll add some fresh seafood to the mix....scallops, mussels, clams, shrimp...whatever looks cook at the deli!

We Loved It! However I did 2 slight changes- I used can diced tomatoes w/the liquid and added 3oz lowfat cream cheese just to add a slight creaminess to it- YUMMY! I'll do it the same next time but prob add spinach!

Pretty good!  I cut the olive oil down to 1 Tablespoon, added 1 medium zucchini and only used 1/2 lb of pasta.  These changes cut the calories on this dish down to 300!  I also think that using fresh herbs would really make it more flavorful.  I thought it was tasty, but not amazing.  It was also very fast to prepare.

This was a great, light dinner. I added some browned ground turkey for my husband and that was a tasty addition without making it too heavy. I used canned, diced tomatoes after reading a review and it tasted great.

Great basic recipe. I used a bit more garlic and onion, and I eyeballed the seasonings. I topped everything off with a nice Italian shredded cheese blend. Tasty, quick, and economical, thank you.

I made this as a late night light meal for my hubby. He has to have meat, so I topped it with some chicken. He LOVED it! The only change that I made was to add some red wine vinegar, to give it an extra kick!

I was getting bored with always making either rice or potatoes, so I was very excited when I came across this recipe. I love to make this as a light and yummy side dish with dinner, especially when it's hot outside. It goes great with the lemon herb pork chops that you can also find here on this site, or any other meats for that matter!

Family really liked this recipe however I thought the basil and oregano was a little too overpowering. I will definitely make again but cut back on those 2 ingredients. Very good though.

Very good! I didn't change much except added some white wine, a dash of crushed red peppers and a tiny bit of mint. Also, cubed some "gourmet" seasoned mozzarella and put on it just before serving.

This recipie is AMAZING! The only setback was the amount of the tomato mixture, when I make it again I would double the recipie. I'm usually a horrible cook, but having recently gone vegetarian and only being 17 I have had to start making my own meals when the rest of the family eats meat. This was really quick and really easy! My mom and younger sister even ate my pasta instead of the spaghetti my mom had made. I will definitely be using this in the future! (:

I couldn't wait to try this while it was cooking because it smelled so wonderful but it turned out to be a huge disappointment.  It was very bland and there were way too many noodles compared to the rest of the ingredients.  I even tried to make it again, cutting the pasta in half but it was still bland.  Angel Hair just doesn't hold this sauce.  I will not try this again.

I made this with about a cup of frozen cherry tomatoes from my last year's garden and a small can of tomato sauce.   I added some balsamic vinegar and brown sugar as I sauteed the onions and garlic and pureed the cooked sauce with my hand blender to smooth out the tomato skins and add body to the sauce.  I was really happy with the results and served with "Garlic Bread Fantastique"...this was a fantastic meal!

Just made this for dinner. I wanted a light pasta dish to go with the Salmon with Lemon and Dill I found on this site that I was making for my husband. We both enjoyed the pasta. Instead of fresh tomatos I used diced canned but otherwise I followed the recipe. Thanks!

We made this while on vacation and didn't have the tomatoes or onion so left those out. We paired it with Garlic Chicken and the whole dish was very garlicky and tasty. 
The pasta came out way too oily but next time I won't add as much to solve that. 
Will make again for sure!

Nice easy dish, only problem is that their is not alot of flavour.  I changed it a bit by adding some mushrooms that I had on hand, and that came out really good. It also would be good with parmesan chesse.

This was most likely the least flavored dish that has ever been created.  I don't even know where the 4 out of 5 stars came from.  I would rate this 0 stars if that was an option.  Don't waste your time or money.

This was prety good. I wish it had made a little more tomato mixture but now I know to double the recipe. It was really simple to make and great for all those tomatoes we grow in the summer!

This Recipe starts off ok, but is very bland.  You need to increase the garlic and the tomatoes.  Do not use the whole amount of pasta.  If you follow the recipe, you will be sprinkling garlic salt or parmesan cheese on the finished meal.

This is a great base. We add whatever we have to the sauce (mushrooms, red/yellow/orange pepper, etc.). This is best with homemade pasta. We make this quite often.

This was good, but I agree with the rest of the reviews that there wasn't enough of the onion/tomato mixture for the pasta.  I added balsamic vinegar to the onions and tomatoes, but it was still a bit bland.  I just reheated the leftovers and added crushed red pepper and seasoned rice vinegar.  That gave it a lot more flavor.  This is a very good basic recipe, that allows for a lot of changes to suit your mood.

I love the idea of this recipe, but would change a few things.  It seemed like too much pasta for too few tomatoes and garlic.  Next time, i will make only 1/2 a lb of pasta for the same amount of the other ingredients.  I also added cubed Brie cheese, an idea I got from a favorite restaurant-this made it wonderful!

This recipe was good however I found it really bland.  I wish I would have read the other reviews first and used their advice when making it.  I will definitely make it again this time adding white wine, double dipping the chicken, and also adding more garlic and paprkia to the flour mixture!

This was a really great pasta recipe.  I did try adding the mushrooms and a few substitutions of may own.  I even used bow tie pasta instead of angel hair pasta and this also worked fine.  Thank you for such a great and tasty recipe.  You must try this one!!!!   Diane

My husband loved it, and he is the pickiest.  I used sea salt and fresh ground pepper blend to zip it up some, as well as upping the garlic to 6 cloves and the tomatoes to 5.  I only used half the amount of pasta called for.  It's a nice, light, fresh tomato sauce.  My husband says I'm gonna be making it often.

I was excited to try this dish out. I wish I had read all of the reviews 1st tho.

The sauce was very tasty and made my kitchen smell like heaven.

However the dish as a whole is extremely bland. Which is odd considering all the flavors in the sauce.

WAY WAY too much pasta. If I make this again I will be putting in a lot more veggies and some cheese sprinkled on top. Also make sure you cut the pasta in half!

This sounds like a great dish, but if you follow it word for word you will be wishing you had ordered pizza for dinner.

This was so good!  I changed the recipes a little bit to give it a more intence flavor.  We love garlic so i added close to 6 cloves and increase all the spices by about 1/2 teaspoon.  It pasted the ultimate test-- my meat and potatoes hubby took it for lunch the next day!!!

I made this as stated, although added fresh basil as a personal preference. There was entirely too much pasta! I would definitely only use a half pound. It also seems bland regardless of the various spices. Adding parmesan cheese adds just the right taste and is delicious!

I tried this recipe but added cooked shrimp to mine.  It came out wonderful!  Add the shrimp just at the end when all other ingredients are simmering just to let them heat through, then toss with the pasta.

The flavors in this were good! I recommend doubling the amount of vegetables and all seasonings, to keep it moist and flavorful. Otherwise, the amount of pasta is a bit suffocating lol.

As written, this is a little bland for my tastes. I did add a little extra garlic, and swapped one of the tablespoons of oil for a tablespoon of butter for some added creaminess and flavor, but we still needed a good bit of salt at the table. I will probably make this again, as it's a nice easy dish that's surprisingly filling, and it looks like it will be easy to modify. Next time I'll try adding parmesan and cream to the sauce right before tossing, and definitely asparagus.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The only change I made was that I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 2 reg sized cans of diced tomatoes Italian style. I will make this again and again, and maybe try adding other veggies I have on hand. This is a keeper!!!

We tried this recipe because we were so overwhelmed with Roma tomatoes.  I'm so glad we did. The basic recipe is delicious but I made a couple of changes to make it basically a one dish meal. (I know, it's not the same recipe!)

I made the addition of adding ginger to the recipe when I put in the onions and then when the angel hair pasta was just barely al dente, I added shrimp and the tomatoes into the pan.  This allowed them to cook a couple of minutes prior to putting the pasta into the pan and didn't overcook the shrimp or dissolve the tomatoes. 

If we have anything with this meal in one dish, it is usually garlic toast. DELICIOUS

This was really good! I didn't have an onion, and the only cheese I had was Gouda, but it turned out delicious. My husband, who hates fresh tomatoes, loved it.
