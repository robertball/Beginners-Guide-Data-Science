Perfect!  Followed the recipe to a T and it was great.  There were a TON of leftovers. I used a 5 pound roast.  I put some of the extra meat in the fridge for later and still had a lot of leftover meat.  I filled my muffin pan with scoops of meat.  Each individual muffin tin holds the same as a typical sandwich.  I put the muffin tin in the freezer and froze the individual serving size leftovers.  After about 2 hours I took the tin out removed the meat  muffins.  Next they went into a ziploc and they will not all stick together.  To reheat just pop one in the microwave on 50% power.  These are great for a quick sandwich, with rice, with beans, or with eggs.

Absolutely delicious!!! I would give this one 10 stars! I cooked on low for 10 hours, then shredded and kept it on warm for a couple more hours. I am seriously keeping this recipe forever. This is the perfect weekend bbq/potluck food, and went great with grilled corn on the cob and red potato salad. Also, when you shred the meat you can remove most of the fat. I think you could do without the oil. I used kraft honey bbq sauce - just what I had on hand. SOOOO tasty. You can't stop eating this.

I pulled 40 lbs. of pork using this recipe for my son's graduation party. I also froze it before reheating it in crockpots. I received many compliments.  It turned out much more moist than the root beer recipe I tried earlier. I did serve BBQ on the side, but I'm not sure it needed it.

I love this recipe! I've made it several times and everyone always goes crazy for it. I use a 6-7 lb. bone-in shoulder. I've used a deboned and a bone-in and the bone-in definitely comes out a little tastier. I leave out the oil and the chicken broth, because I think the broth makes it too juicy and I just don't think the oil is necessary. Instead, I just put in the entire bottle of barbeque sauce. I use like 10 cloves of garlic and a huge vidalia onion. You don't have to bother chopping up the onions or garlic too small because by the time it's done, they're all dissolved. I put in closer to 1/2 cup brown sugar, 8 or so drops of Liquid Smoke, two tablespoons of chili powder and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. In my opinion, and I think everyone I've fed this to would agree, the cinnamon is KEY. It makes it SO GOOD and adds such a depth of flavor. The recipe doesn't mention this, but make sure you put the roast in the slow cooker fat side up so it can drip down into the meat while it cooks. I cook it on low overnight for about 12 hours, then pull it and remove all the fat, strain the liquid and add it all back to the cooker for another 4 hours or so. The leftovers really do taste better every day. Make sure to make a semi-sweet southern slaw to go along with it - HEAVEN!  ;)

Made this with a 6 lb. pork loin roast I had bought on reduced for quick sale. I followed the ingredients increased for my size of roast, except for using dry mustard in lieu of prepared and adding liquid smoke. I cooked on high two hours and then low for seven. I took the meat out and it shredded with complete ease two hours before serving, then placed back in the crockpot. There was alot of liquid and needed to reduce a good two cups worth after placing the shredded meat back in the crockpot. Added a bit of BBQ sauce and liquid smoke at that point to give the meat a bit more flavor, even though it was tender, still lacked that BBQ flavor. After another two hours this was the best tasting pork I've evern made in the slow cooker. Our guest even requested to take home some for lunch the next day. I'm not sure I'd add the broth next time, I feel the fat in the meat made plenty of juice.  *Note when placing meat in crockpot, always leave the fat side on top so the juices sink down into the meat while cooking...read that somewhere.

I was so excited to try this, but ended up a little disappointed. Although it was very easy to get together and the pork turned out perfectly and just fell apart, the taste just wasn't doing it for me. It was way too sweet for me, I was hoping for more of that smoky flavor. If I make this again I won't be adding any sugar, maybe more vinegar and maybe some liquid smoke to give it that pulled pork flavor.

Good flavor. Estimated cooking time was about right. The only change I made was omitting the thyme as I don't like the flavor with pork. I'll definitely make it again.

This is an excellent recipe.  My family loved it and it quickly disappeard.  I used a 2 1/2 pound pork roast and it turned out perfect. I have tried to find a good recipe for pulled pork for years.  My search is over, this is it!

HOLY COW!  I put this roast in the slow cooker for a full 24 hours, on Low the entire time.  I turned at 4 hours and again at 12 (although at 12, it just fell apart and continued to do so throughout the day).  At the end of the 24 hours, the meat was dark brown from soaking up sauce and the most incredibly rich, moist, tangy and delicious BBQ that I have ever had in my entire life.  It was so juicy and delicious that we didn't even need any extra sauce or additions.  I can't believe how amazing this was.  Would HIGHLY recommend cooking for a full 24 hours on low if you can plan it that way.  Great with beef roast, too!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I doubled because I had an 8-9 lb. roast.  I did everything according to recipe EXCEPT I didn't use oil (NO NEED!), and no chicken broth (no room & no need!), AND no Thyme as I AM NOT A LOVER, Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet & Spicy (because this is the BEST for pulled pork), placed onion slices on the bottom of crock pot, placed my large roast on top of onions, mixed all the other ingredients in a bowl and poured over roast turning several times to coat.  Made sure fat side of roast was on top!  Set Crock Pot for 10 hours, after 5 hours removed pork and shredded, removed bone, placed everything back in sauce, covered and cooked for 7 hours longer (ended up being a total of 12+ hours~the longer the BETTER!  YUM, YUM, YUM!!  Served with Greek Pasta Salad (made the day prior), corn on the cobb and apple sauce.  Definitely toasted the buttered buns (which is a GREAT touch) and my family ages 8 to 54 GOBBLED IT UP!!!  I always make much more so I have leftovers (even better the next day), and extra to freeze as well (for a later date).  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE.  I have made pulled pork several different ways and I NOW think that this is my NEW FAVORITE!!  LOVE LOVE, and THANKS AGAIN!  HAVE A FULFILLING DAY!  :)

Excellent recipe. I made this for a pot luck at work and it was a huge hit! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but did not use the chili powder (I was out). I seasoned the meat with Famous Dave's Rib Rub and added a tsp of liquid smoke. I cooked it for 8 hours. The meat was falling apart, I had a hard time getting it out of the crockpot to pull it apart.  There was a lot of liquid left so I ladled some over the pulled meat and discarded the rest. Served on rolls with Serbian syle coleslaw.  DELICIOUS!!

Very good pulled pork. My problem was the sauce was too runny I couldn't really taste the flavor of the sauce and the flavor didn't stick to the meat. My solution..after the pork was removed and shreded, I dissolved 2 TBSP corn startch in 1 TBSP apple cider vinegar and added it to the sauce. It thickened right up so the flavor (which was amazing once thickened)actually stuck to the meat. It was the first time my husband asked for seconds when I made pulled pork.

This is AWESOME! This will be my go-to recipe for pulled pork from now on. The only change I made was omitting the oil as I just couldn't see the need for it and reduced the thyme to a little less than a teaspoon. After shredding the meat, I poured the liquid into a measuring cup which separates the grease from the other liquid, then poured about half of the liquid back in with the meat. There will be a LOT of liquid, which is fine, but you don't need that much in the end. Try this! You will not be disappointed!

10 stars would be a better rating for this one. We absolutely LOVED this pulled pork. The flavors are perfectly balanced. The cider vinegar is a must for this type of pulled pork, so don't leave it out. When you add the pork back to the slow cooker, it soaks up all that flavorful slow-cooked juice and is just divine. Do put it back in, you'll be glad that you did. Didn't change any of the ingredients, cooked on low for 10 hours, and look forward to homemade pulled pork many more times in the future. Hubster said it is THE best pulled pork he's ever had in his life. He is a big fan of pulled pork, so that says a lot. Thanks so much for sharing this stellar recipe!  :)

First off this is the most amazing pork i have ever had.  I used a 8 lb pork shoulder bone in much better flavor when the meat has the bone in it.  I doubled the recipe i didn't use the oil which is not needed because the fat from the meat  makes the sauce oily enough also didn't use thyme because i just don't care for it.  cooking times i changed based on how big the meat was i cooked it for 7hrs on high then another 3hrs on low and omg it was falling apart amazing tenderness when i took it out it was already shredding it was so tender. couple things i would recommend is place the dice onions on the bottom and place the meat on it to avoid having the meat touch the bottom.  also make sure u place the meat fat side up to so that way the  fat drips into the sauce.  another big thing is the sauce will be oily u cant fix this because the meat is fatty dont trim the fat first because it keeps it moist while in the slow cooker also i didnt sear it first either the fat is easily removed when u shred it.  to avoid the oily sauce once it was done i placed a whole bottle of bbq in the pot and returned the meat to sauce all shredded and kept on the keep warm setting for 20 min then served makes a huge difference  next daythe sauce will thicken  also the bbq i used was called dinosaur bbq original. i used the meat for tacos and the next day for sandwiches  enjoy this recipe its awesome and remember  dont be discouraged from the oily sauce after  it will happen since the meat is fatty

This recipe was great and a big hit with my dinner guests! )if they only knew how EASY it was!). I left out the mustard (somehow missed it when I wrote down the recipe) and the onion (didn't have one). Still was a great recipe. I will follow it to the "T" next time! Thanks!!!!

This recipe is the BOMB! Like many folks...this was my first time cooking a pork shoulder. The oly changes:
1-DO NOT add veggy oil. Are you crazy! Pork always makes its own oil.
2-1/2 can of beer instead of broth.
3-I smoked my meat for 1.5 hrs with a charcoal grill and hickory wood chips.
4-5lbs TRIMMED pork shoulder (I would suggest trimmed to reduse amount of oil)
5-2 heads of garlic (1 head crushed in pot when slow cooking. 1 head inserted in meat when smoking.
6-Remove meat from pot to shred (drain "juice" before putting meat back in pot. Add sauce along with the onions and garlic from the juice back to pot. Add juice accordingly...I like my pork not to jucy).
7-Enjoy.

Made exactly as written.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and for me the key to these sandwiches is a little extra BBQ sauce piled on top.  It was a hit at the party I threw...no leftovers!

Made this for superbowl sunday and it was a hit with everyone!  I read a ton of reviews and since everyone said it was watery and too sweet I made a few changes to remedy this...I used half of the cider vinegar & half the chicken broth, and doubled the BBQ Sauce (1.5 cups - half Sweet Baby Ray's and half a Hickory Smoke BBQ sauce).  Cooked on low 12 hrs.  I still had to reduce it quite a bit after taking the meat out (I did this in 2 batches), but not a big deal since it reduced within a few mins.  With these changes it's a definite 5 star recipe.

Excellent recipe.I used a 6.5 lb Boston butt and cooked it on low for about 9 hrs.Took out the meat ,removed as much fat as possible as I was shredding it. wrapped the meat separately and chilled the remaining meat juices in a pot overnight in the fridge.The fat solidified and I was able to remove it all!Then added some Sweet Baby Ray and Wahoo sauce to the liquid and then used a stick blender to smooth out the sauce.Added the meat back to the sauce and put it in the fridge overnight to intensify the flavor in the meat.Served on toasted sandwich buns -yum!!!

Very good. And easy. Use a quality barbeque sauce. I like mine on the spicy side but live with someone that likes bbq sauce sweeter so. He wins. Could use some salt and pepper IMO.

I have made this recipe 3 times now. What I like to do after I have shredded the meat is add it to a hot skillet with some olive oil and brown it a little bit. I think it really brings out the flavor of the meat better. After it is brown (takes about 5-10 minutes, stir it a lot) I take a few ladles of the sauce from the crock pot and add them to the skillet. I butter and toast fresh bakery buns (Bollilo or Bratwurst) instead of commericially packaged hamburger buns. I like to add a slice of American cheese and a Claussen pickle slab and voila! Culinary AWESOMENESS!

Pulled pork is something not seen around these parts but having seen it on different cookings shows, we thought we would give it a try.  We found this to be an awesome meal.  Didn't have buns so just ate it on a plate with some Dijon mustard on it and a side of homemade cabbage rolls.  Lots of leftovers, so definitely will buy some buns and try that way with some cole slaw.  Thanks, cmcreight.

Fantastic!  No veg oil needed.  Cooked on low for 10 hrs while at work, no thyme (personal taste), shredded and returned to crock pot and doused with spicy bbq sauce (Stubb's) - hubby and kids loved it!!  Took leftovers to work and had to print out recipe!!  I think the combo of vinegar, worcestershire, chili powder, mustard, brown sugar, and bbq sauce gave it that sweet/spicy/tangy kick that makes for a great meal!!  Thanks for Sharing!!

Blech! The sauce this created was watery & useless. I couldn't get it to reduce down to something usable and ended up just putting more bbq sauce on the pork. The meat came out fine, but more because it was a nice cut rather than the cooking process. I will keep searching for a good pulled pork recipe.

So Yummy. Made this for my partner and I and it is the best pork recipe I ever made. I omitted the thyme and clove because I didn't have any and you couldn't tell. I also put in a few dashes of hot sauce and liquid mesquite smoke. I only had a small two and half pound roast beings its just two of us' so I cut the recipe in half. Next time I will find a bigger roast. I also used 4 big cloves of garlic, we love garlic, but could of used more. I had to use red wine vinegar & beef broth beings that is what we had. It did make any difference it was so fabulous. A must have recipe. This is one of those recipes you keep secret, lol. I tried kaiser rolls toaster as per recipe and tried another on a plain hamburger bun and they were both great. This is not as hard as it may look, so easy. Make it in the morning and go about your day and dinner is ready. next time I will try this over white rice. YUMMY!

UPDATE: Made this again for the second time. I still could only find a 2.5lb pork roast. Again I omitted the thyme and clove because I don't have it & do not like clove anyway. I use Jack Daniels Original #7 Recipe  Barbecue sauce. That is so good. Again I used red wine vinegar & Chicken Broth. This time I did not cut the recipe because I wanted more sauce. Always add 4 cloves garlic, little more Worcestershire. I add a few dashes of hot sauce & Mesquite Liquid Smoke. This brings so much more flavor to the roast. About teaspoon each. Everyone asked me "What is that flavor?" It is those

Very good!  Everyone raved!  I put this in the crock pot in the morning and it was done when I came home for dinner.  I think next time I will try cutting back on the oil, didn't seem necessary in the crock pot. When it was done I drained the liquid into a pot, skimmed off the fat and reduced the liquid until it was thick and poured back over the pork.

Wow - I followed this recipe exactly (except I cooked on low for about 10 hours) and it was absolutely delicious.  My whole family raved about it.  I ended up prepping the night before and letting the roast sit in the crock with all the seasonings in the fridge.  This kept it easier for then next day.  This recipe was delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

Awesomely delicious! It even impressed the in-laws - who are country-folk. Couple very small changes - we removed the onions with a slotted spoon before returning the shredded pork to the cooker. We also drained the remaining liquid and spooned it back over the pork until it reached our desired amount of moisture - if we had used all of it would have made ours very "soupy". Overall, an outstanding and super easy pulled pork recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious and easy recipe.  The only change I made was to remove the pork from the cooking sauce; and refrigerate the sauce until the fat came to the surface and skim it off...our pork shoulder had quite a bit of fat.  Then I shredded the pork and added it back to the sauce.  Whether this comes out as a "sweet" pulled pork or a smokey one is going to depend on the barbeque sauce you use.  My husband felt the one I used was too sweet for his taste so I'll adjust that for the next time...because there will be a next time for this one!

I don't really understand something here...you have a list of ingredients you could use as the base for a home made BBQ sauce...and you add a cup of store bought sauce...this recipe sounds good, but I would take the vinegar, brown sugar, mustard, Worcestershire, chili powder, onion, thyme and garlic, add ketchup, some molasses, paprika, ground white pepper, and some cilantro, mix it all together until well blended, and use that as the BBQ sauce instead of some random store bought nonsense. Just my opinion.

This was delicious! I took some other people's suggestions and used 1 1/2 c bbq sauce, 2 T mustard, 2 T Worcestershire, 1 1/2 T chili powder, 1/2 t thyme, and 5 cloves of garlic. It came out really well. My advice is to let it cool if you can to scrape the grease off.

To give more flavor:  1) left out chix broth-it's just flavored water anyway. 2) used 3 T of chili powder and should have used more.  It didn't make it hot, just deepened the flavor. 3) used 1/4 c  yellow mustard. 4) used a rich bbq sauce as the vinegar and mustard will spice it up.  5) 1 1/2 tsp liquid smoke. 6) and as always, more garlic. 

All the juices and fat rendered when cooking dilute the sauce so make sure it is very strong when you make it.

Yummy. I did 2 things different. I used a pork butt and I also used dijon mustard. Both changes in my opinion didn't change the flavor at all. I have tried several recipes from this site for pulled pork, and so far, this one is my favorite. I am not a big vinegar fan so I was worried about using it but I'm glad I did. It gave the meat a slight tang to it. I served it on texas toast with dill pickle slices and raw onion slices. Tasty!

Decent.  I think next time I would omit the thyme, it does not match the flavor profile and adds a bit of an "aftertaste."  Otherwise fairly happy with the results, sauce consistency is decent (maybe a little on the thin side) and has a nice smokiness to it.

I cooked this exactly as directed and it was amazing, the only thing I did different was after I shredded the meat I did not return it to the slow cooker because it was too greesy and thin. I put all the shredded meat in a deep dish and added some of the original sauce and additional BBQ sauce and then it was moist and full of flavor.

EASY!!! Gotta love it.  This is a very tasty crock pot Pulled Pork recipe.  It is so flavorful after returning the shredded pork to the crock to soak up juices.  I made this ahead of time - day before -  as the main dish for a casual dinner with guests.  Heated it back up in the crock with a little water to moisten.  It was delicious and tasted freshly cooked.  Great meal - especially for a busy person.

This was fantastic. I made it exactly as written and my husband raved over it, though he suggested we top the sandwiches with sliced banana peppers next time for a little extra zing (not that it wasn't tasty enough already). Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for 25 people just as the recipes says except that when I pulled the roast out to cool and put the sauce in the refrig to cool so that I could remove the fat then I cooked it on the stove for about 30 minutes until it thicken.  Pulled the pork and put it back over the meat and continued cooking it for about an hour.  I thought that the sauce was going to be too vinegary but I was totally wrong.  It was wonderfull!!!!!

loved it!!! used beef broth instead of chicken, omitted chili powder and used bone-in pork shoulder chops (which were much cheaper, and the bone added flavour and the meet fell of it for easy removal when pulling).  So good!!

I'm amazed how many people give THEMSELVES five stars on this recipe after they make multiple changes to it. I'm giving it five stars as it's written and yes, I've made it...Twice since I saw it because I lost my old recipe. Mine called for coffee instead of the broth, but no matter, this is an excellent recipe as is and I made it as is. For the people who make multiple changes and post LONG  paragraphs about their changes, may I suggest instead of giving yourself a five star on this,  simply submit Your own recipe, let others judge Yours  and leave this one alone.  I see this happening on Every recipe I look at on this site. 
I've been making pulled pork for years, I'm from the south, seventy years old and this is darn good. 
Try making it as it's written. Give the submitted their credit for it.

I am very surprised this has as many stars as it does. I was extremely disappointed in this recipe. The pork itself came out fine but the sauce was tasteless, watery and just simply not good at all. Luckily I was able to just take the pork and mix it with another barbeque sauce recipe to save it.

I pulled out my measuring cups and spoons and followed this recipe to the "T." The only exception was I didn't have an "extra large" onion so I cut up two medium ones.
The flavor was good but I found it to be too runny for pulled pork, not nearly thick enough. I don't mind "sloppy joes" type stuff but when it makes the (toasted) buns like mush, I'm not terribly happy. We went through several napkins per person. Glad I didn't make this as a first-time dish for guests (a golden, rule, I know, but I break it constantly). I also expected it to be a little spicier - I think because of the chilli powder- but it wasn't spicy at all.
For the work included in this recipe, I'd rather throw a pork roast in the crockpot with some good high-quality bbq sauce and let it be. All the extra work wasn't worth it. Sorry.

My husband I absolutely love this recipe.  The recipe says it is for 8 servings, but we got 14. 

The only addition I made was to add 3/4 tsp. Liquid Smoke to the liquid, as well as substituting dehydrated onion flakes for a large onion.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and shredded the pork and put it back in the crockpot for another half hour before serving.  

Then, with the leftovers, I removed the pork from the juices and spooned it into a muffin tin (12 small muffin-sized servings.  I did the same with the leftover juices.  

Put the pans in the freezer until pork mixture and sauce mixture is frozen and place them in a gallon-sized freezer bag.  Each muffin-sized portion (and of sauce, too) is enough for one sandwich and can be heated in the microwave for use.  Put in a little extra BBQ sauce on each bun if desired.  

My husband asked me to "please make this again" and I definitely will.  Freezing in individual portions makes it so much easier to use up the leftovers without them spoiling in the refrigerator.

Love this recipe!

I have made this several times now, and it is always  enjoyed by the whold family (no mean feat in my house)!  I don't change the recipe, except to try different types of bearbeque sauce.  It cooks perfectly every time and is so easy to make.  The flavor is not too overpowering, but strong enough to make you want more!!  I can't fault this recipe, it is delicious.

WOW!!! I had some pull pork this summer and they used root beer. I didn't like it, it was TOO SWEET. So, I went looking for a recipe that didn't have root beer and saw this one. I was hungry just reading the ingredients. LOL. This was SO GOOD!!!!! The only thing that I changed was the chili powder. I used chipotle powder instead. Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper!

Really good Pulled Pork. It just needed some salt, my only complaint. Never time, I will season meat with salt and I know it will be even better!

A definite keeper...  I served this on girl's night - all of us over 50 - and everyone loved it!!!  They all wanted the recipe and it could not have been easier to prepare.  I put a 6 lb. boneless pork shoulder in my slow cooker on high for 6 hrs.  I made 50% more sauce and it was the perfect.  We had it on multi-grain kaiser rolls with a caesar salad - just fabulous.  I followed the recipe except for  1. I did not have apple cider vinegar so I used the same amt. of white vinegar and added about 3 Tbsp. applesauce, and 2. I used a combo of bbq sauces (a couple of Bullseye sauces and a couple of Diana sauces).  I omitted the chili powder, and we did not butter the buns.

Had it today. Hubby loved it so did everyone else. Hubby likes his bbq pork to cook in the bbq sauce. Brother, his wife and son were impressed. Nephew had seconds, he's a pickey eater. My mom said she don't like hot, said it was spicy but not too hot. I will make again.

Perfect recipe and made in electric pressure cooker in 90 minutes. 

I cooked on high for 90 minutes and just increased water to 2 cups. 

I did not use any sugar because bbq sauce is sweet enough. 
Also did not use oil because pork releases its own oil,  and did not care to use any broth as I prefer the natural taste of the pulled pork to shine through. 
I also added some liquid smoke to taste for that authentic Texas type pulled pork flavor.

It was delicious and I prefer to use the pc to the slow cooker since I do not like to leave any cooking appliance on when I am not home, due to a previous house fire which was caused by an unattended slow cooker many years ago.

The pressure cooker recipe is really delicious, and fast too, and my Texas dinner guests visiting from Texas all gave it the thumbs up, and requested the recipe too. 

Great pc recipe if you do not want to use a slow cooker, or have no time to smoke or bbq a pork butt or pork shoulder for pulled pork recipes.

I have been looking for a recipe like this for years.  Simple, and one that everyone in my family loves..  I did not use thyme in my recipe and I cut the onion in half.. It cooked down beautifully and the house smelled wonderful.  I have made this recipe twice this month.  My family now has another favorite meal!!

We really liked this, especially with a mound of coleslaw on the sandwich. I did find the need to serve with a side of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, as the recipe by itself needed just a smidge more flavor.

Delicious! I mixed all of the ingredients in a glass measuring cup and poured over the pork. I followed the ingredients list but left out the thyme and added a "dash" of cinnamon. After removing the roast I strained the juices and refrigerated over night to remove the excess grease.  Before putting the juice in with the roast I added cornstarch to thicken a little, as one reviewer suggested, but also added more bottled bar-b-que sauce them mixed it in with the pork.  It was so good and received great comments...Love the review section of your recipes!  It really is helpful and inspires me to experiment.....

I have tried many pulled pork recipes, & this is the worst I have tasted.  There is NO barbecue flavor at all.  That one little cup does nothing for the taste.  The sauce was too watery & just has an off flavor.  I won't throw it out, but it will be my own recipe when I finish "doctoring".  I don't rate a recipe unless I follow it to a "T".

This is going to be dinner for tomorrow after school! One thing that I am going to make sure is to use a certain brand of BBQ sauce that our entire family loves; "Sweet Baby Rays". I can't wait as I can imagine it is going to taste so darn good! I like the idea of toasting the buns in a fry pan too! I would like to find a recipe for adding a sauce to the buns, like a local Restaurant in Muskegon, Michigan uses on their pulled pork sandwiches too. It's name is "31 Barbecue" which may be named that because of the Highway 31 nearby, I am not sure. It has been there and is well known for many many years too. Always a full lunch crowd.

Cooked this on low for 12 hours removed the meat and shredded. I strained the liquid through a sieve and poured it into a gravy separator. Using the grease from the roast I made a rue, thickened up the sauce and returned it with the pulled meat to the slow cooker. I served this on nice rolls with a side of flavored rice. For me I prefer to roast a rubbed pork shoulder in the oven as to get that tasty bark on the outside. I made this because it got such rave reviews with so many giving it five stars. I did not like it that much perhaps because I have tried many ways to roast and pull pork and have had better results.

I made this recipe as stated with a 4.5 lbs pork loin. It was delicious for all and easily kicked up a notch with Tobasco sauce. I cooked on high for 3 hours, then on low for 4 more. Shredded the meat and returned to the sauce. Family rated it as A+. This recipe is easily adapted for more flavor as you like. Will make this again for sure!

Ama-zing! I'm not even a big pork person, but this was awesome. I threw in some spicy thai chili sauce (because it was on hand) and served it as pulled pork over ramen noodles rather than buns, but I will try it as a sandwich too. SO GOOD!

Seriously; mouth is watering just thinking of it.

So freaking good. The ONLY THINGS I do differently is I reduce the apple cider vinegar to 1/4 a cup and bring the chicken broth up to 3/4 a cup to replace the missing liquid from the AC vinegar. I do this because I do not like the acidic taste. However what you can do instead is make the recipe exactly as it’s written, and then taste it. If it is too acidic add 1/8th to 1/4th teaspoon baking soda to neutralize the acid without changing taste. It’s basic science and will save your meal if you’re sensitive to acidic taste :)

This turned out great.  My wife is not a huge pork fan, but she loved this.

I used a 6 quart oval slow cooker and the pork fit perfectly.  I used a Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and it gave it a nice sweetness.  Use something different if you're going for tangy.

I put everything in except the pork first and mixed it all together well.  Then I put the pork in and nestled it into the mixture until it was mostly covered and resting on the bottom of the crock.

When the pork was done cooking, there was a lot of liquid left.  So, I removed the pork and ran the liquid through a strainer.  Be sure to push all the solids against the strainer to get all the liquid out.  Next, I ran the liquid through a degreasing cup and into a large sauce pan.  Then I put the sauce pan on the stove and reduced the liquid until about half was remaining.

Once I was happy with the sauce, I shredded the pork and put it into the sauce.  I mixed the pork and the sauce well and then it was ready to serve.

Wow--I am SO disappointed in this recipe. The whole thing tastes like thyme (which tastes like mold to me) now. I added some more bbq sauce hoping it will counteract/cover up the terrible thyme taste so I can salvage it.

The texture of the pork was very nice, but the sauce was lacking.  It needed much more flavor so I added more garlic and chili powder. Finished it off with some balsamic vinegar.  Added an excellent note.  Also used my spice rub it kick it up a notch.   Did not use chicken broth

I just made this, and it was phenomenal.  Now, this is my first time even USING a slow cooker, but the results were fantastic.  ANYBODY can make this.  I left out the thyme, and used white wine vinegar instead, since I had no apple cider vinegar.  The meat was fell apart beautifully after 6 hours!  Also, I have posted a picture of my meal!

I followed the recipe to a "T" and the meat turned out super tender.  I am going to rate this at 3 stars.  I thought the taste of the apple cider vinegar was very strong.  If I made it again I would use white vinegar and reduce the amount of it by half.  The sauce was a little runnier than I would expect for a pulled BBQ recipe.

This really is the BEST slow cooker pulled pork recipe EVER! I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce & Gouldens mustard in place of the yellow mustard. I left out the thyme because my husband despises thyme. I used a bone-in pork shoulder. The meat was so tender & tasty. Thanks for this great recipe!

I doubled this for a large gathering and just about everyone there was pleased with it. I cooked it in the slow cooker overnight on low for about 12 hours, then put it in the refrigerator the next morning. After it was cooled, we pulled the meat, put it in an oven-safe dish and drizzled it with honey BBQ sauce. Closer to dinnertime, I popped it in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes and it was perfect.

This made for an excellent dinner and lots of yummy leftovers. I prefered mine without extra bbq sauce on it as the meat was flavorful and tender on its own. Would make this again!

This recipe was fantastic. My boyfriend and I don't usually eat pork, but this recipe was recommended to me by a friend I really trust. So, I made it and we devoured it. Its great because I put it on before I left for work and he was able to have dinner when he got home. I followed the recipe exactly, that's why I gave it 5 stars. I usually won't rate 5 if I change the recipe.

I have been very loyal to another pulled pork recipe on this site until I came across this one and decided to give it a whirl.  So glad I tried it, it's delicious! I added 2 tbsp of liquid smoke to the sauce mixture and it was perfect! Definitely reduce the sauce before using it on your sandwiches if you like a thicker sauce.

This was definitely easy overall but I wish I would've eliminated the fat on the roast before cooking because it was hard to get it after it was cooked and everything was so tender.  I used a 4 lb bone-in roast and cooked it on low for 7 hours then high for 2 hours.  The meat had a nice sweet flavor to it but required additional bbq sauce on the bun.  I think next time I'll sear the roast before cooking as it seems to keep meat more moist.

I made this for supper last night.Have never had pulled pork of any kind before. It was AWESOME!! flavour flavour!! Our picky 16 year old requested that I make it "lots more". The only changes I made was a used a couple of spoons of brown sugar & I'm not a big fan of thyme so I just sprinkled in a wee bit. I used bullseye hickory smoke flavoured bbq sauce and fresh homemade buns (toasted as suggested)
 FINALLY--a way I can eat roast pork without feeling nauseous & tasting it for two days!! Thank you for sharing this recipe :)

Great! I cut the recpe in half since my roast was on the small side - turned out awesome!!! The only changes I made aside frm cutting the sauce in half was to strain the onions out of the sauce before shredding the meat and adding it back to the sauce, also I used white wine nvinegar as I didn't have apple cidar and it turned out great.  I used Diana's Sauce Western Smokehouse flavoured bbq sauce and it tasted amazing!!!

Very good. I made it just as the recipe says. When I make it again I think I might add a little more spice to it and maybe try to thickin the sauce But it was good as is. This was deliciouse, we had it on wheat buns and had macaroni salad as a side dish.

Great recipe! If you think your pork isn't tender enough. Lower the heat to Med or Low and go for 8 hrs. Also, if you like the smoked flavor, add some liquid smoke. I used hickory and it tastes perfect!

THIS ONE'S A KEEPER!!!!
I omitted the oil and just sprayed the crockpot with cooking spray. I also used Kraft honey BBQ sauce. Followed directions to the t, but scaled to the 3lb roast I had on hand. DELICIUOS!!! My husband and beagle were salivating before it was through cooking!!

I gave the recipe as is 4 stars, because I feel that you do, like other reviewer said, have to add more BBQ sauce than what the recipe calls for.  I also think that taking the liquid that the pork cooks in out of the crock pot and putting onto the stove to reduce also is needed for those that like a more thick, sticky BBQ sauce.  I find that adding a bit of tomato paste and simmering for about 20 minutes or more greatly improves the sauce.  Also, I like to take an immersion blender and blend it until smooth.  I then shred the pork, put it back into the crock pot, add half of the reduced sauce, and use the other half for topping.  Yummy!  The ingredients in the recipe do make a very yummy sauce!

I was expecting this to be GREAT based  on all the great reviews but I'm not happy with it at all . The flavor is so so, the sauce is much too watery. The meat is nothing special. Maybe that's the way Texas pulled pork is supposed to taste? I know Ive had it at airports in Texas and didn't care for it but I thought it was just lousy airport food .  I really wish I liked this recipe.  If I make it again, I will not add the chicken broth and  I'd cut out the sugar. Also , I would cut the mustard in half or eliminate it all together.

This is the best pulled pork I have ever had!  Sooooooo good.  After cooking it for about 8 hours in the crockpot, I shredded the pork, then let the shredded pork cook in the sauce for another 1 1/2 hours before serving it.  My husband is not a big pulled pork fan but couldn't get enough of this and asked for it to be cooked again.

I made this with six pounds of chicken breasts instead of pork to make it kosher and it tasted great!  I ended up using more BBQ sauce (Bullseye this time) with some extra garlic and it got rave reviews at my office!

Made this last night to take to a picnic today.  It could not have been easier!!!  I cooked it on low for about 8 hours and woke up to an amazing aroma in the whole house.  Shredded it with two forks and put it back in the pot.  The meat was amazingly tender, can't wait to eat some today with a little hot sauce!

I absolutly LOVED this! I didn't change the recipe at all, I just let is cook on the low setting in my slow cooker for 14 hours (overnight). I flipped the Pork Shoulder roast about 10 hours in... SO DELICIOUS & TENDER! Definitely sharing this recipe & I will most certainly use it again!!

This was just what I was looking for. Sweet and savory and just how I like it! I made it exactly as written (except no thyme). I even had a 5 1/2 lb loin and the sauce went far enough for all the meat. I was actually a little nervous about the chili powder, but it blended nicely with the sweetness of the other flavors. Highly recommend this recipe!

Absolutly AMAZING. My boyfriend loves pulled pork and he melted at the knees with this recipe. I made a few small changes. I used a pork butt roast (very similar area of the pig, and by butcher recommended I use that instead). I also cooked it on low for 12 hours. For the bbq sauce I used a texas style bbq sauce. I highly recommend heating up more bbq sauce and topping your sandwhich with it. and of course, some home made slaw (best sandwhich ever!!!)

This is perfectly delicious! It is a great southern style pulled pork, just like I used to get in North Carolina. I cooked mine on low for about 8 hours in the crock pot. It smelled great almost instantly! Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was great!  I followed the recipe to a "T", except I cut back a little on the chili powder since my father doesn't really dig spicy food.  I also think that you could do without the oil in the beginning; I think it just adds unnecessary fat to the dish.  I turned the roast about halfway through cooking to ensure that it all got simmered in the yummy sauce and served them on buttered, toasted potato slider rolls.  Soooo good!!!

If you like your pulled pork with a thick barbeque sauce this isn't the recipe for you. I followed the recipe exactly besides added more garlic (to me no recipe calls for enough). The meat was very juicy, tender, and had a good flavor though. The meat is good but the sauce is just not cutting it for me. I am going to try this recipe again but once the meat is done cooking I am going to pull it out and mix it with my own barbeque sauce.

All I can say is WOW!!! My husband is a BBQ sauce "snob", he raves about my homemade sauce and says that's all he will eat. Well, I decided to make this recipe and follow it for the sauce. The only things I did different was, I put the roast in slowcooker before going to bed, around 10:00 with the chicken broth and garlic. The next morning, shredded it, dumping the dripping, and started over with fresh chicken broth and followed recipe "except" used dried flaked onion. Let it slow cook few hrs. more with sauce, and OMG, it was "delish"! Hubby said he was pleasantly surprised, and it was definetly a keeper.

Wonderful flavor. I cooked overnight on low. Sauteed some onions, green bell peppers and tomatoes in garlic flavored olive oil to compliment BBQ sandwiches. Shredded some pepper jack cheese for those who like cheese.

Excellent recipe! It was very easy to follow and required pretty common ingredients that I already had or bought and will use again for something else.  It was better the next day, I think!   Even a very picky eater who "doesn't like" onions and mustard ate this.  I only told him after he ate several helpings that the recipe contained both ingredients!!

Delicious and so easy.  The pork shredded beautifully after 6 hours in the slow cooker.  I like my bbq sauce a little sweeter, so next time I'd up the sugar or cut the vinegar or worchestershire sauce back a bit.  Other than that though, no complaints, my husband loved it!

What a great recipe! I love that all of the ingredients are things that you would normally find in your pantry.   The only change I made was that I mixed all of the sauce ingredients together in a large mixing cup before pouring it over the roast. And I used fresh thyme sprinkled on top, rather than mixed in the sauce. Lovely!   And easy!!!

I have tried making pulled pork once before and didnt like the sauce. So I thought I would try once more. I slow cooked it all day and then again the next day and it was so good. This one is a keeper.

Pulled pork perfection!  Per my hubby- easily as good as from any restaurant we have been.  I used a Boston butt roast and omitted the onion.  I also heated up all of the ingredients for the sauce together before adding them to the slow cooker.  I cooked it on high for 5 hours and then shredded it, at which point I also removed the fat.  I left it in the slow cooker on low for another 3 hours.  Perfect.

Wonderful recipe for an easy do-ahead dish.  I mixed all the ingredients together before adding the pork, to ensure even distribution of the flavors.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce with this and spread a little on the bun before eating.  Very good.  Next time, I may try adding a dash of Liquid Smoke, but it was fine the way it is written.  Thank you , Catherine, for sharing this recipe.

Wow, Wow, Wow. You will not believe how good this smells cooking and the eating is even better. I will mention that someone was concerned about too much vinegar,  but while the vinegar is a bit strong at first, it cooks out and gives it a really nice tang. Used Sweet Baby Ray's molasses sauce, and I am not a big pork eater but could not stay away from this.

Fall apart tender with good flavor -- not too spicy, just enough to tantilize.  We had it first over potatoes but will do the bun thing with extra sauce for the leftovers.

I'm a native Texan and have been smoking pork butts for many years so I thought I would give this recipe a try since it looked simple enough. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned soupy with a funky taste and nothing like Texas pulled pork. Found another recipe on this site for slow cooker pulled pork which used root beer and that turned out great!

Great recipe. Put the frozen pork roast in the crock pot on low for 10 hours with the sauce, shredded it and put it back in the sauce for awhile. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise. Delicious!

I loved this recipe. I read the reviews & made some changes. It turned out delicious. My family loved it. I made the pork the day before my get together & finished with the sauce the next day. I didn't add the vegetable oil, chicken broth, thyme or butter. I used a bourbon & brown sugar bar-b-que sauce. I cooked the pork (bone in) on low for 10 hours in the crock pot in the mixture & there was a lot of juice as mentioned. I shredded the pork & placed it in the fridge. I took 3/4 of the juice & refrigerated it overnight then in the morning I pulled off the layer of fat & then thickened up the sauce with cornstarch & water. I placed it all together in the crock pot on warm for a few hours & served on buns. I also made cole slaw from all recipes & it was a hit.

I must have made some error, but the thyme was way too overpowering and made the meat taste old. I used "thyme leaves" from the herb department. Maybe that was wrong? Too bad. It looked so good.

Sauce was watery and had a strong vinegar taste. I added more BBQ sauce, but it didn't  improve flavor that much. Added some corn starch to thicken sauce and that helped a bit. Meat cooked nicely and was tender, but flavor was just so-so.  Wasn't thrilled with this recipe and won't make again.

This was a pretty good recipe!  I omitted the veg oil, chicken broth, and thyme.  I used half a can of beer in place of the chicken broth.  I also added 2 tbspns of hot sauce and a 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  Cooked on low for around 8 hours.  A lot of reviews I read said there was a lot of sauce, and while there was a good amount, it was really tasty.  Def worth a try and I think it would be good for serving a large number of people.

This was really good! I used a 4 1/2 lb. pork shoulder that was frozen and let it go on high for 3 hours, then backed it down to low for another 5 hours. The pork was very tender and juicy and shredded easily. Served on mini yeast rolls with a macaroni salad on the side. Will definitely make this again!

Loved this recipe.  I made it according to the directions using Sweet Baby Rays Sweet & Spicy BBQ sauce. It turned out so good and was just as good for leftovers the following day.  This is a keeper.

Did not like.   No taste at all.   I kept adding to it.  Finally just drained all juices and added good BBQ sauce.  Too much liquid that made it soggy..

Made this but added dark beer instead of broth and vinegar and a little liquid smoke and red pepper sauce for zip. It turned out very good. The family gave it thumbs up! Thanks.

Wow was this good!  My only change was adding some black pepper and red pepper flakes.  But you can't go wrong with this.  Make sure you use good BBQ like Sweet Baby Rays.  Tried this same recipe with chicken but it wasn't very good.

Fabulous dinner and so easy. I dumped everything in the crock pot from the start and then did nothing until just before dinner, I pulled the meat apart. I used a tenderloin straight from the package partially frozen, red wine vinegar, Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce, 1/3 Texas sweet onion. The chili flavor in this is strong but it is not hot. Medium spice level. I'll definitely be fixing this again. Thanks for the Texas pork.

Overall I thought this recipe to be fantastic.  My husband has been the cook in the family; he was in awe with the outcome.  I did make a few changes; I put McCormick grille master rub and salt and pepper on the roast and let it set overnight.  I also took the suggestion of other readers and mixed the sauce ingredients the night before.  I also placed the onion on the bottom of the slow cooker as others had suggested.  I also added a tablespoon of honey and 2 tbsp of liquid smoke to the sauce. I cut the vinegar to 1/4 cup As another reader had stated the sauce was not thick enouuugh so I thickened with cornstarch and a bit of water.  I felt there was too much sauce for the meat and if prepared it again I  would add less to the pulled pork and put the remaining sauce on the side. I cooked the pork in the sauce on low for about 7 hrs, pulled it apart and added back to the sauce for another 2 hrs.  I was delicious.

This turned out good, but the dried thyme was WAY overpowering. The pork was tender, juicy, and had great flavor, but next time I'm cutting back or omitting the thyme.

I made this exactly as written but the dried thyme overpowers all the other flavors. Would NEVER make this as written again! The pork flavor would be there but the thyme is so off-putting.

Decent recipe, but I felt that the sauce was too spicy and watery. I wound up just saving the sauce for later and using BBQ sauce on top of the pork. After about a week, I reduced the original sauce, added a drop of liquid smoke and added some honey and then used as a wing sauce which turned out awesome.

Recipe as-is was very bland.  It tasted more like a regular pork roast, not BBQ.  I had to make significant adjustments for this to taste good.  I probably won't make this recipe again.

Very moist. I'm from the South so I'm a hard critic. A little bland for my taste. Something was missing that could have made it better. It was sweet and tangy but lacking spicy and salty flavors.

Made this exactly as listed except I didn't have the Apple Cider Vinegar, so we used Balsamic vinegar instead.  This was delish!!!  It was so juicy, so flavorful that we will be making this one again and again!!!

Excellent recipe.  Pork turned out great. I used two 2 pound pork loins and used almost the full bottle of my favorite bbq sauce (Dinosaur sensuous slathering bar-b-que sauce) put it in the crock pot on low for about 10-12 hours, shredded it right in the crock pot and then stirred the pork in the juices, served with fresh Cole slaw ("Sweet restaurant slaw" recipe from this sight) there are hardly any leftovers every time I make this. I cut back just a little on the thyme and added several dashes of liquid smoke as others have suggested.

Hubby and I always use the McCormick packet because it makes a very good and easy pulled pork but I forgot it once so I found this recipe instead...wow!  What a difference - just as easy but so much better - we'll never go back to the packet!

This recipe was outstanding!  I made it for the Super Bowl and everyone loved it!  We had tons of leftovers, since there was only 3 adults eating it, but it got better and better as the days went by.  My husband didn't want BBQ sauce, he said it had enough flavor as is.  I made pulled pork with root beer and this recipe is SO much better.  It's something that tasted like it came from a restaurant!  Hardest part was pulling apart the meat.  WORTH IT!!!  (I didn't have chicken broth so I used a beef bullion)

Leave out the thyme. I put it in, even though I know I've never been a fan of it and I regretted it sooo much. It overpowers and ruins the flavor of all the other spices. Just ditch it and I'm sure it will taste much much better..

This was wonderful!  Only change I made was used 1 t. packaged chili seasoning as had no chili powder.  We at it without bread as we are cutting carbs but had cole slaw as a side.  We went back for seconds!

Spectacular!  I had to make the recipe without Worcestershire sauce, and with dark brown sugar instead of light, but it was two thumbs up from my family and guests.  Makes plenty for leftovers and a second meal.

Pretty darn easy, pretty darn tasty.  Definitely have bbq sauce on the side (as pictured) as most folks like that extra kick on their sandwich.  But it's not because the pork lacks flavor.  After about 5 hours, I had to cut the hunk of meat into smaller pieces as it wasn't cooking as quickly.  Otherwise, cooked as outlined in the recipe.  It was a big hit.

Amazing! I absolutely loved this and I will never be making pulled pork any other way. I'm not a huge fan of the taste of BBQ sauce, but the flavors of these ingredients were tangy, spicy, sweet, deliciousness!!

This is a great recipe! I think I would take one of the recommendation of another reviewer and make a bit of extra thickened sauce to put on top.  I would totally make this one again!

Sorry, but I have to agree with those who say it was on the bland side.  There wasn't much flavor and it was quite liquidy.
Quite disappointed, really, because I can usually count on the highest-rated recipes to actually be the best.  Not this time.

I made this tonight, thought it was ok. Was not as impressed as the other people who reviewed it apparently. My pork shoulder had the bone in it and weighed in at 7.30 lbs. Not sure if the way the recipe automatically doubled itself was a factor but didn't have quite the flavor I was looking for. I prefer it to have a bit more of an acidic vinegar flavor. I did not think it was bad but I would probably try another recipe before using this one again.

Cooked this while visiting my family in England - they LOVED it. Mum has since added this to her pot-luck repertoire and it was a hit with all her UK her friends too. 
Omitted onion second time I made it, and it was still superb - didn't miss it.
Have also used this recipe with a beef joint and it was delicious - a great, versatile sauce.

I made A VERY POPULAR BBQ SAUCE from this site to go with this pulled pork.  It was very easy and tasted great.  It will be perfect for our small group meetings.  Thanks for sharing!

Really good, but nothing to die over!  I guess I just like a sweeter pork flavor, but this is still yummy!

Just finished making this, and my family thought it was from a local BBQ joint. I added Agave Nectar and Dijon mustard to the mix and it came out extra sweet and tangy.

Good recipe.  It was a bit too much an the vinegary side, and I love vinegar, but it may be because I made homemade barbecue sauce for this recipe.  Next time, I'll try a store bought kind or reduce the apple cider vinegar in the recipe if I use my homemade sauce again. (note for myself: if making my homemade sauce, eliminate salt and slightly reduce Worcestershire)  I also did not have yellow mustard since it's not something we use, so I substituted horseradish dijon.  At the end, I did feel like it was good but missing something, so I added some root beer (probably about 2/3 can) after reading some other recipes and then simmered in the slow cooker for a little while longer.  That seemed to do the trick.  Next time, I may add some hot sauce or cayenne for a little kick.

This makes incredible pulled pork.  Left out the vinegar b/c my family doesn't like it.  Rubbed the meat with Stubbs spice rub and garlic powder before put it in the cooker.  Made the whole house smell awesome and tasted amazing in tacos with cabbage, lettuce, cheese, sour cream and chives.  Served with carrot apple salad and strawberry rhubarb crisp.  What a meal!!  Thanks

We followed this recipe to a T and found it had very little flavor.  We ended up doctoring all of our portions with more bbq sauce.

I thought this was great, followed recipe exactly except the only pork i could find was a 4 lb pork loin roast, and it tasted great! Cooked on slow for 10 hours, shredded it, put it back in for another 30 minutes or so. After i shredded it, i poured out probably 1/3 of the liquid though. GREAT!

Made this the other night and it turned out amazing! 
Cooked it for 8hrs in the Crockpot.  I used "Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ" sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

Two thumbs up! This was so tender and juicy! My family LOVED it! It is great to fix on a weekend when I can just throw it in the slow cooker & let it cook while we do things around the house. We ate it on buns & plain with a side of veggies & starches. We have since decided to try it on baked patatoes next time! My husband was not happy when he had to eat tub BBQ after eating this!

I doubled this recipe since I had an 8+ lb. pork shoulder and it came out delicious! This recipe reallyrocks! Not only did we enjoy it but our company loved it and so did a picky 3 year old and 7 year old. That's impressive :0)  I cooked mine for 8 hours on low, shredded it and then put it into a 12-inch saucepan with the juices to reduce...which worked out wonderfully. It not only flavored the pork even more, but created a thicker sauce for our sandwiches. I will be making this again very soon and can only hope I have leftovers this time around! Thank you for sharing!

Our meat came out tender and juicy - loved that part, but the "sauce" was really runny and didn't have much flavor. Next time I'll add a lot more barbecue sauce or have sauce available at the table to add. It was too watery for us, and the buns got soaked.

This was a very moist tender pulled pork recipe.  I added 1/4 c of vinegar as others recommended but think I may cut that down even more and not use the thyme.  My husband loved it .  I served with Mom's coleslaw recipe (find here at allrecipes) and whole wheat toasted hamburger buns....very tasty.

I made this yesterday for company...perfect! We trimmed some of the excess fat off the pork shoulder before adding it to the pot. I also used a separator to remove any remaining grease in the sauce. The meat was so tender and juicy and the flavor was amazing. Everyone loved it. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Not a lot of sauce for the sandwiches but a lot of flavor. I had a bottle of barbecue sauce on the table for those that like more sauce. It is a real easy to prepare recipe. Tastes great.

I have 4 boys and this is a family favorite.  My 13 year old son loves to cook.  This recipe is one of his "go to" meals.  He also makes his own Rootbeer and it is a special treat when he makes the pulled pork and rootbeer for our family.  He toastes his buns and adds a slice of provelone cheese.  The older family members place a couple of onion rings on top.  It is delicious!

Awesome recipe! I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I substituted with 1/4 cup vinegar, 1/4 cup lemon juice and 2 tablespoons apple juice. I used some of the juice leftover in the crockpot and added it to my homemade BBQ recipe. So good!

Very yummy pulled pork.   Except I cooked it on low for 12 hours, the extra few hours really made a difference when I did a taste test :)  I did add a couple of drops of liquid smoke and some sea salt.  Everybody loved it on rolls topped with coleslaw.  For sure will be making this again.

From all the good reviews I thought the salt in the broth and BBQ sauce would be enough to season the meat, but the meat lacked something even with all the spices going in there.  If I make this again, I will definitely salt the meat to bring out the flavors.

After trying several recipes, this has become our favorite. I usually use half of a sweeter bbq sauce and half of a smokier one and the flavor turns out great. Top with some coleslaw and it's delicious! Have shared this recipe with many.

This had a lot of flavor and was tender.  I cooked it on low for 12 hours and it was perfect.  I personally prefer the North Carolina style pulled pork, but this was pretty good too.

Super delicious. I tasted it after shredding up the meat and decided it needed a little something so I added some molasses and a wee bit of crushed red pepper and chipotle powder. Soooo yummy.

This recipe was very easy and extremely satisfying!! My hubby could not stop saying how great it was from the moment he took a bite.. until we went to bed! LOL! It literally melts in your mouth. I used a 2.5lb Roast and kept the recipe the same minus the chili powder and thyme because the BBQ sauce I used was very spicy as it was. I cooked it on high for 2 hours then turned it down to low for the remaining 5 hours. Since I left the ingredient amount the same I had to drain a lot of the liquid b4 returning the shredded meat back to the cooker. It made for the best pulled pork I have literally EVER had!

There are better pork recipes in the crockpot on this site.  This was ok, not bad, not stellar, just ok.  Proof once again that you should leave pulled pork to the Appalachians and the Texans should just handle their beef. :-)

I've made this recipe three times now, so it's time for a review. Five stars. Yummy delish! Next time I might make it a day ahead, keep the meat out of the sauce after shredding, refrigerate sauce and meat separately overnight, pick the solidified fat off the top of the sauce, then combine and reheat (just to cut down on the fat a wee bit). Either way, I haven't done that yet and it's fabulous. No need to try another pulled pork recipe. Thank you so much!

I followed this recipe exactly using 8lb bone-in pork. I typically like my BBQ tangy and spicy - NC style - but wanted to try something different. While my pork was properly cooked, the flavor of the sauce just didn't do it for me. It wasn't bad by any means - I just found it to be a bit too mild for my tastes. To note: I kept the sauce recipe at the same measurements even with a larger pork shoulder. Once I had the butt in the (large oval) crockpot I was glad I didn't double it because there simply wasn't that much room left over. It didn't matter because the amount of sauce was plenty for 8+lbs of pork. It was drowning. With that, I agree with others... no need to add oil and I don't feel the chicken broth added anything but unnecessary extra liquid. Thank you for sharing.

Didn't change a thing to the recipe.. except.. After three attempts with good results I decided to make one small change. I took all the ingredients. Put them in a small bowl. and mixed them well. Left them to rest for about 30 minutes. Put the pork roast in the slow cooker and gently poured the marinade over the roast. covered and set on low for 10 hours. The mixing allowed the ingredients to mingle and made sure the sugar was in solution. No burning to the walls of the slow cooker.

This turned out like sloppy joe pulled pork for me. I had to eat my sandwich with a fork it was so wet and viscous, and the BBQ sauce was diluted and  tasteless

Absolutely no flavor in the sauce except for straight up vinegar.  I used a strainer and separate the sauce and onions once you I pulled the pork.  I added the onions back into the cooker along with the pulled pork (along with salt and pepper) and added a tried and true BBQ sauce which saved the whole meal.

I used sweet baby rays bbq sauce and after I shredded the pork I placed it on cookie sheet and placed in broiler to burn tips. Really added a nice flavor and texture. 
Great and easy recipe. We all enjoyed it.

Followed exactly as written except that I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used ride wine vinegar. This is ABSOLUTELY delicious. I pulled apart the pork and then added back to the juices, added seasonings to taste and kept on warm until I was ready to serve it. Everyone RAVED. Incredible .... :-)

This method makes WONDERFUL pulled pork sandwiches!!!  I DO cut the vinegar down a little, and the BBQ sauce recipe I use is Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce.  I make a batch of that sauce, use some for the pork, serve some hot on the side for the sandwiches, and then freeze the rest for another time.  Even my husband's 94 year old grandpa said this was the best pulled pork he'd ever had and asked me for the recipe for this and the sauce too!  :D

I love to cook so much, that even when we go on vacation, I insist on doing the cooking. Normally, I tweak most recipes but I have to say this one is OUTSTANDING as written.  I can't understand why some reviewers were disappointed with this recipe!  My husband told me how good it was with just about every bite!  And our guest raved over it. After I gave Allrecipes the credit, and because I'm fairly new to the Deep South (SC), I bragged to my dinner company, "Not bad for a Yankee!"

Wonderful!  Great way to combine the sweetness of the brown sugar that the hubby loves and the tang of the apple cider vinegar that I love in a good, barbeque sauce.  We let this slow cook all day and loved the results.  Made some homemade slaw to go with it and it was fantastic!  2 thumbs up!

This was very good. I left out the thyme and oil as well as the chicken broth (didn't want it to be too liquid-y). I used whatever bbq sauce we had (which was Stubb's) and it went really well.  Cooked for about 9hours low, then shredded the meat and dumped it all back with the sauce and let it sit for another hour or so. Delicious sandwiches! Will definitely make again!

Well... I suppose I should have started cooking this bad boy at 7am. I put it on at 10am and it is now 6:30 pm and its still got a good couple hours to go to fall off the bone. The sauce however, is pretty darn tasty even though it is sooooo liquidy !!! I may try this recipe again and will most likely cook it for well over 10+ hours on low next time!!

Made this recipe in 6 crockpots(250+ guests) using 8 pound bone in pork shoulder/butt roasts and doubling ingredients for our son's graduation party. Everyone raved about it. Our guests said it was the moistest pulled pork they have ever had, the most flavorful, and hands down the BEST pulled pork they have tried. I was just in a panic because I couldn't find the printed copy and couldn't locate the recipe. I have now made sure it is in my recipe box, printed and able to be found for future use. You will not regret trying this recipe!

This recipe completely rocked!!! I must admit I blindly threw on a bunch more mustard and brown sugar, plus about 1/4 more vinegar.  After I shredded it, I strained the onions cuz I hate the texture of them... re added the meat, coated well and left it on low another 3 hours... I tell you what, I ate nothing else for 3 days!!

So easy, affordable, and versatile. I used 1/2 the amount of BBQ Sauce, so that I am able to use the leftovers for Pulled Pork Tacos. It worked out great, since more sauce can be added onto the sandwich and usually is. I also used 3 lbs of pork and 1 lb of beef. Everyone had seconds-- give it a try! :)

I did not care for this recipe. I added 3/4 the amount of thyme called for and it was way too overpowering.

Just made this for my daughter's first birthday party for 60 people. Everyone was so impressed and loved the recipe. I would add more garlic next time, but that is only because we love garlic! I made 28lbs of pork shoulder and I probably have 8-10 lbs left (but we did cater in a bunch of other food too).

I did this exactly, so i thought. There's always room for a mistake. However, I came home an hour later and was repulsed by vinegar and onion smell. That's never happened. I was SO disappointed.

Too sweet, not enough zesty/spiciness for my family.  I made pulled pork a few weeks prior and used the pre-measured spice mixes from the grocery store.  I'll try another recipe next time.

Excellent recipe!  Mine turned out a little spicey as I was generous with the smoked chipotle chili powder that I used in place of regular chili powder.  It added a nice flavor to balance the sweetness.  Highly recommend this recipe!!

I made this three times so far and we just love it.  Made it straight by the directions except for using brown mustard instead of yellow because we never by the yellow kind.  This is a keeper, and will be made again and again.  I never thought I would like a crock pot BBQ pork, but this is it.  We're going to serve this when the kids and grands come out for their annual visit.  Thanks for the recipe cmccreight.

Both of my boys and my husband said this was the best BBQ pork I had ever made.  It is delicious!!  My husband smokes pork in the smoker for 15 hours and it is wonderful but for a much quicker pulled pork sandwich that is just as awesome - this will be my "go to" recipe.

I made this for company over the 4th of July.  I made it a day in advance and I'm glad I did.  I wasn't too impressed with the flavor when I took the pork shoulder out of the crock pot and started to pull the it, but letting the flavors marry overnight made a huge difference.  It was very good and my guests thoroughly enjoyed this pork served over Kaiser rolls, with sides of slaw and corn on the cob.  It was pretty "soupy," and I was concerned with fat.  So I remedied that by storing the meat separately and put the juice in a large measuring bowl over night.  Then I could easily skim off the fat and reduce the juices in a pan before adding the pork to heat it up the next day.

Tried this again, used the exact measurements as stated in the recipes, except i used non stick spray instead of the oil, then added half of the copped onion on the bottom of the slow cooker, place pork on top of onions, pour on top of the roast: broth, vinegar, worchestshire,bbq sauce, mustard. Sprinkle on top of roast chili powder,thyme, and the remaining onion. Roasted for 6 hours on high. Great on Naan bread and restaurant style coleslaw.

I just have to weigh in on this recipe!  I am not much of a cook, I cook the same things over and over.  My daughter asked for pulled pork for her graduation party. I thought about buying it already prepared through a BBQ restaurant.  I was searching through the recipes on the internet and noticed this one had tons of positive  reviews.....which I read and thought I can do this.  So simple and fantastic! My husband was like make sure you have a back up plan....that was not needed as this pulled pork recipe was so stinking good that my daughter was happy and everyone at the party said how wonderful it tasted. I did leave out the thyme and the oil and added salt and pepper.  Will make it again and again.

I am so not a cook but I did try this recipe.  1st time I left the fat on cause I didn't know any better.  2nd time cut the fat off.  
I left the garlic out because my husband has an intolerance to garlic.  Once I used brown sugar BBQ sauce and 2nd time I used Maple BBQ sauce.  Everyone that I served it to loved it and I have shared this recipe with many of them.  Thanks so much!

This was outstanding!  I tasted it before adding BBQ sauce to it and thought it was better without the sauce.  It was very flavorful, moist and tender.  My favorite for impressing company now!

Delicious! I omitted the thyme. I browned the pork roast with  a tablespoon of olive oil before putting it in the slow cooker. Same with the onions, browning them and mixing all the ingredients together pouring it on top of the pork roast. This was awesome and so easy to make.  Very tender and flavorful.

The best pulled pork I have ever had!!!  Beats restaurants! :)  I served this at my baby's baptism yesterday, and it was all gone!  My husband loved it, and I have leftover rolls (Hawaiian bread) and I think I'm making it again for us this week! :)  I think it was more of a tangy pulled pork, and not as sweet as some.  It was soooooooo good!!!!   Thanks so much!!!  

Only change I made:  Less thyme, less onion, no oil.  I'm sure if you added the full amount it would be just as good!! The changes are not necessary.

Very tender and delicious. Added some cinnamon. Used apple juice and cider vinegar instead of apple cider as we didn't have any. I would have given the recipe 5 stars except my husband decided it needed additional barbecue sauce at the end. Will definitely make again with the bbq sauce at the end.

Outstanding recipe! I used this for a crowd of 40 and everyone raved over the meat. I cooked an 8.5lb, a 7.5lb and a 7lb and just doubled the ingredients for each. Cook time about 9 hours at 200 in my cast iron Le Creuset pots. I only added back about half the juices after straining out some fat. Served in a Kitchenaid 6QT Slow Cooker using my Presto griddle to toast buns.

For a slow cooker "BBQ," this was pretty good. I used sweet baby ray's original sauce, but next time I will cut back on the brown sugar and up the cider vinegar. I might also up the mustard a little bit. I'll admit I am a BBQ snob, as I have my own smoker, but for a weeknight pinch, it came in handy when my son was begging for some BBQ. 

I really like the buttered & toasted buns, and I'll be doing that from now on with all my BBQ. We used pull-apart rolls that I buttered and toasted to make little sliders.

Bottom line: If I need another slow cooker BBQ, I will come back to this one.

Made this tonight, only parts I changed was no chili powder and didn't use the chicken broth. My family loved it! I was hesitant at first thinking it might taste weird, but I put my faith in the ratings and posters- and they were right! It was absolutely amazing!!! This is a 'must try' recipe for a easy delicious dinner. Thank you ever so much for posting this amazing recipe!

Family loved the flavor, me not so much. I didn't care for the overly vinegar taste so I added more BBQ sauce to counter the taste. It did turn out more liquidy so I removed most of it from the slow cooker and thickened it in a saucepan and then returned it to the slow cooker to marry up with the meat once I shreaded it. I will try this again but will probably add less vinegar, more garlic, more brown sugar (or honey), less chicken broth.

Absolutely fantastic! I've made this several times now. I used Sweet Baby Ray's honey barbecue sauce, and mixed some extra in just before serving. Other than that, I followed the directions just as they were. I topped the buns with chipotle mayo, which worked really well. A very flavourful recipe!

This was very easy. Great recipe for that BBQ taste of summer. I omitted onions and used onion powder, also I think next time I will cut down on the chili powder b/c mine turned out very spicy and I like more of sweet BBQ. Going to recommend to my friends!

So sorry, but we didn't like the strong taste of the thyme. I'm sorry I didn't leave it out. I didn't use the juice after it was done but just shredded and added jar barbecue sauce to the shredded pork. There was a slight taste of the thyme but not as bad.

This is excellent.  I omitted the thyme as I don't like it but otherwise I didn't change a thing.  It makes a ton and the leftovers are even better, I think.

I thought this was very bland. For all the spices that went into it, I felt it needed something else. I will probably use BBQ sauce to give it more flavor. Should have read more of the reviews. I guess it was either you like it or it is just ok. Don't think I will make it again. Too many other recipes to try. Sorry. Maybe it is just me. I used a pork shoulder roast too for more flavor but it just didn't have it for me. I will take it to my family reunion tomorrow and hope it gets eaten as I bought an 8 lb. roast.

I made this for Father's Day and everyone LOVED it!! I followed the recipe to a T, only thing I added was a drop of Liquid Smoke. Put it on an Amoroso roll with a little horseradish and a slice of fresh provolone, YUM!! Will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe.  Made it for a group.  Some liked the amount of sauce; others thought it needed more -- that was an easy fix -- pass the BBQ sauce.  I think your choice of BBQ sauce is a key to making this a great recipe.

My family is not a fan of vinegar-based Texas BBQ, in general, but I thought I'd try this because of the apple-cider vinegar...it turned out FANTASTICALLY.  :)  I substituted soy sauce for Worchestershire sauce since I didn't have it on hand, and still was perfect.  Thanks a million for sharing.

Made this exactly like the recipe says and found I needed one more hour (total 7 hrs.) on my Rival Crock Pot (mine has four settings 4-6-8-10 hr.) I did it on high "6" and then added one hour.  It was very easy to pull apart,but I like a heavier sauce, so we served it at the table with Jack Daniels Original Recipe BBQ sauce and it was super tasty. I'd definitely make it again.

VERY GOOD! Used 2 lb pork shoulder with bone in.  High heat 4 hr, low heat 45 min and was done.  Used white wine vinegar (had on hand).

Didn't have a pork shoulder roast in the store smaller than a 7 lb., so I adjusted the recipe accordingly.  IMO, this just isn't worth the time and what little effort it requires.  We found it rather bland tasting, even after adding a little more Bar-B-Q sauce and all seasoning after removing the roast from the liquid.   Have already deleted from my recipe box.

I misread the recipe and added 1/4 c mustard instead of a Tablespoon.  Even so, this turned out fantastic.  My husband isn't too fond of prepared BBQ sauce, so actually it ended up being a good mistake.

This makes the best pulled pork!!!  I cook mine in the crockpot on medium for about 8 hours, and the pork just shreads with a fork!  The meat is very tender and flavorful.

Love this recipe!  First time I made pork and it turned out fantastic.  Great recipe for weeknights when you want an easy dinner.  I only used a 2lb roast, but kept the amount of remaining ingredients the same.  I left it in the crock pot on low heat for 8 hours and it turned out very tender.  Delicious!

Cut back on the vinegar and added more chili powder and garlic.  I also salted the pork butt prior to adding the other ingredients.  Based on previous recommendations, I dumped half of the liquid and the remainder was the perfect amount.  Served them on slider buns with cole slaw and bbq sauce.  Got raves from everyone at the party!

good recipe! I used country style ribs, there the pork butt ribs, same as pork butt roast only less fat.
I left out the thyme because we are not big on it.

after draining the liquids, pulled the pork and returned wih just a little bit of the jucies left in the crockpot, added 2 tsp of pepper, & a teaspoon of jack daniels mustard and added 1/4 bottle more of bbq sauce left in crockpot on low for an hr to keep warm.

perfect .............served with coleslaw from this site, ( moms coleslaw) fantastic and easy.

This was fabulous!! I ended up using white wine vinegar (instead of apple cider vinegar) because that was what I had on hand and used a little bit less than the recipe called for.  I also added a few more garlic cloves. I think next time I will add a little bit more BBQ sauce to counter the sweetness of the sugar.

Since my roast was still partially frozen, I cooked it in the oven all day at very low heat.  The result was an excellent pulled pork recipe.   Even though I did alter the cooking method I followed the rest of the recipe and indredients omitting only the thyme...it turned out excellent.  I skimmed off most of the fat before mixing the pork back in to the sauce.

This was excellent and was a big hit at the recent Super Bowl party!  I removed the liquid from the crock pot, however, before putting the meat back in.  Using a ladle, I then began to add back just enough liquid to keep the pork moist.  I also tried to save as much of the chopped onion back in to the meat as well.  I then added another cup of barbeque sauce for a little more bbq flavor.  Having too much liquid will ruin the pulled pork so it is necessary to add back only enough liquid to keep the port moist!

I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  Best pulled pork I've ever had.  Followed the recipe almost exactly.  I didn't use onion because of personal preference.  This pork was amazingly tender and juicy.  I will be making it again.

Great recipe! But, like another reviewer I agree with leaving out the thyme. I made it with the thyme and it added an odd flavor to the meat. I will leave the thyme out next time I make it. I used the 6 hours on high variation which caused a little scorching on the bottom of the roast but not enough to negatively affect the flavor.  I added another 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce right at the end before spooning onto buns and it was perfect. I sent my old pulled pork recipe to the trash and replaced it with this one.

I usually don't take the time to write reviews but I wanted to do so for this recipe.  I am a vegan, the only one in my household so have never tasted this but the aroma is outstanding and those I make it for have all given a thumbs up.  I haven't changed a thing.  I do compliment it with a Jim Beam barbeque sauce I make myself.  It's Super Bowl Sunday and I am off to put the pork into the slow cooker.

Amazing.... enough said..
Only thing I changed was the Worcestershire sauce and only because I didn't have any, so I substituted A-1 for it..Worked fine. Right this moment I am getting prepared to use this recipe for chicken in a slow cooker... and my tummy is already growling at me.  :)

Very good and easy to prepare. My family really enjoyed it. My only question is which type of barbeque sauce is best to use? As we all know there are many choices. I had Sweet Baby Ray's on hand and thought it was too sweet for me personally with brown sugar already in the recipe. Smokey may have been better. Any thoughts out there?

I followed the recipe exactly and I thought the taste was great and so did my husband. The recipe was also pretty easy. My only wish is that there was a little less liquid and a little more kick and less sweet. That's just my taste but it was still really good!

I wish there were more stars to rate with!  Fanatastic recipe.. a new favorite in my house.  My husband is from the U.S. and lived in the southern States for awhile and said this is the best pulled pork he's had since he was last down south.

Though I rate it 4 stars it could easily be 5 stars. Not sure the shoulder piece used in the recipe but mine resulted in very fatty juices. I followed the recipe and was too much fat. I then had to could off the meat to either drain or cook off a lot of the juice, per serving. When I do it again, (and I will),  I will modify the recipe by skimming the fat off the juice before adding the pulled pork back in, or just remove 80% of the liquid, then add more BBQ sauce if needed. I grew up on this stuff, and my memory is it needing more not less juice/sauce. But the taste is better in this recipe. Also I will add in liquid smoke next time. But a great recipe..

WOW, so very good! First time I ever made pulled pork and it was delish!!  I will be making this again for sure! I made a few changes...I did not use the vegetable oil, it seemed unnecessary.  I also had only a hot and spicy BBQ sauce in the house, and I didn't want to overwhelm the dish, so I only used half a cup.  I also used a whole cup of chicken broth and upped the brown sugar to half a cup.  I completely omitted the mustard, as no one in the house likes it, and I don't ever buy it.  Small changes, excellent meal! Try it, you won't be sorry!

This was an easy recipe, and had great flavor.  there was more than enough juice after cooking, so I took another readers advise and strained out most of it.  We have 1/2 in the freezer for a later recipe.  Looking forward to it down the road.

I tried this recipe last week and it was a great hit for Football Sunday.  The one flavor that stuck out was the apple cider vinegar...so I would cut it back a little but it was still very good.  Leftovers the next day thicken up better than the day it was served.  Great recipe, will definitely use this one again.

Just let me say, you would be crazy to try any other recipe!!!  this one is the best.  I did not put all the ingredients in with the pork while it was cooking.  too much fat to drain out later and I didnt want to lose any of the seasonings upon draining and straining later.  Heres what i did: one day prior to serving, I cooked the pork roast in the crock pot for 5 hours til shreddable.  Then I strained out all the leftovers from the crockpot that was not juice......I then added all the ingredients and put the pork back in and pushed it all down so it was well coated with all the sauce.  I put it in the refrigerator for the next days Packer game.  It soaked up all the delicious flavor and was the best.  I will never used just barbecue sauce ever ever again.  This rocked!!!!

I used cooking spray instead and didn't put butter on the buns to save a few calories. Otherwise followed exactly and it turned out fabulous. I cooked on low for 9 hours. Thanks for the recipe.Super easy & super tasty!

Overall I really liked the flavor of this recipe.  I did add a few more cloves of garlic for my personal taste.  I used a red onion because I prefer that flavor.  I used a 4 lb roast but you could easily increase that to maybe 5 for the amount of sauce the recipe makes.   After I shredded the pork and returned it back to the sauce, I added a big squirt of bbq sauce.   I did mine on low and it went about 11 hours and it was perfect.

My hubby loved it, after reading the reviews I did not add any sugar, till the very end and just added a tiny bit of brown to counteract the chili powder as he does not like things to spicy, might just cut down on that next time.  Sliced my onions used Stubbs Mesquite bbq, a tablespoon of mesquite liquid smoke and a shot of soy, I think I will be making this again, even made my own bread for the sandwich, cooked it for almost 10 hours on low

AMAZING home cooked pulled pork!  Tastes just as great as when I make it with the seasoning packets from the grocery store - better even!  The only change I made was to use regular vinegar instead of cider (I didn't have any in the house) but it was still fantastic!  I did find the onion a tad overpowering, so I will probably cut it down next time...but overall...will definitely make again!

This was a awesome dinner. Served to my husband and 4 kids all finicky eaters it was a family hit.  Turned out delicious melted in your mouth, fell apart, tender, juicy.  Next time I wont add the vegtable oil, it doesn't need it. I did add 1tsp. Hickory liquid smoke.  Used 4.5lb pork roast cooked low 10hrs, didn't even have to attend to it, plenty of juices and alot of meat, no bottom scorching.  Other than that followed the recipe.  Butter some extra large hamburger buns, placed them butter down in the oven to get a firm crusty bun a must otherwise the bun is to mushy for my taste after the juices hit it.  Thank for a wonderful dinner.

The best pulled pork recipe I've tried!  Flavor was perfect (I used Kraft BBQ sauce).  I made it in a LeCreuset Dutch oven in the oven and cooked it for several hours.  Tasted great the next day (in case you want to make it in advance).

This was really good but a tiny bit watery for me. I had to double the recipe because the store only had large portions of the pork. Very good flavor! Yumm

My family really liked this but I wasn't sure what kind of barbecue sauce to use and there was a lot of liquid when done. I drained quite a bit off.

This was just okay. I followed the recipe exactly but the sauce was too runny for my taste and didn't stick to the meat like a thicker sauce would have. If making it again I would omit some or all of the chicken broth and some of the cider vinegar.

Delicious. Made just as recipe was written and it was fantastic. Tasted even better the next day. Only used a 2.8lb cut of meat and got about 10 large sandwiches. Pulled pork sandwiches are only as good as the BBQ sauce you top them with so splurge and buy a good one!

This recipe is simply AMAZING!  I didn't add Worcestershire sauce because I didn't have it and it was still so good!  Was a little intimidated by the amount of chili powder but it didn't taste spicy like I thought it would.  EXCELLENT!

This was good! I was worried that there was too much liquid but it was fine. I skipped the brown sugar, chillies and thyme and it still came out great. I think the apple cider vinegar was the key.

I followed the recipe as written and the pork was very tender and flavorful. It was very easy to make. The only thing I would do differently next time is to reduce the vinegar since we felt it is a tad bit vinegary for our taste. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Easy to follow recipe.  My kids added more Bull's eye BBQ sauce when they ate the pulled pork for dinner.  Otherwise, would make it again.  The sauce after cooking in the slow cooker is pretty thin (watery), and does not have a lot of flavor.  Definitely adding more BBQ sauce gave this pulled pork more flavor.

Have to say, everyone was loving this pulled pork!  Myself included.  Only variation I had made was instead of using chili powder, I instead used some red cayenne pepper.  Same amount, just wanted to give it a little extra kick and it did.  I also used a "texas" style bbq sauce which also adds a little heat.  But it wasn't over bearing.  Even my wife, who isn't into spicey food so much, loved it.  Was my first time with a pork shoulder and this recipe was super easy (prepared on lunch break to be ready by dinner time when I got back home from work), and was delicious.

Super easy to make, the hardest part of this recipe is being stuck in the house all day smelling it cook away!

When picking your BBQ sauce pick one that isn't hugely bold flavored because you really don't need the extra (we used bullseye and hubby thought it was a bit too much) And there will be lots of liquid left over, You can easily discard half while keeping the rest to moisten the meat!

Served with a coleslaw and it was a big hit! We'll for sure be doing this one again!

I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it and cooked for 16hours on 225 The pork melted in our mouths! The best pulled pork I have ever had! The only change is next time I will add a little more of a spicy BBQ sauce. Thanks for a outstanding recipe!

Omitted oil. Pork was fatty enough. Made lots of liquid, used a smaller roast. Adjust pounds according.

This was very good. My son loves pulled pork. i was a little concerned, the vinegar is pungent but it translated well on the palate. served on onion rolls and just had chips on the side for a quick dinner.

Easy to make, came out  little to sweet but I did use a Tony Roma's Brown Sugar blend (it's what I had). I'd use a different bbq next time.

AMAZING. The flavor is absolutly delicious. The only suggestion I would say to cut is the veggie oil, no need for it. Turned out beautiful and tastes amazing reheated

All in all, I thought this was a good recipe for making easy indoor pulled pork sandwiches, if you expect it to taste like smoked pork it doesn't, but still very good and easy!

This was a little too sweet for my taste, although otherwise was quite tasty.  I wound up adding more vinegar and mustard to cut the sweet, but next time I think I'll just leave out the sugar.

This was delicious! The only thing I changed was I didn't add any thyme (because I didn't have any) and I used minced garlic instead of crushed garlic. I plan on making this again. Thanks

I followed the recipe exactly as written. And than made some additional changes. But the recipe as written is very good too. I just like our meat a little spicier so I added a lot more chili pepper to it and also added some root beer for the extra sweet kick. So tender so juicy. Def something worth making again! UPDATED: It is almost impossible to mess this up. Have fun with it I would say you could totally spice it up and with that sweet touch it makes it soooooooo yummy!

I made this recipe exactly as listed. This was a great way to cook the pork - it came out beautifully in terms of texture.  It was tender and perfectly cooked. It just didn't have great flavor and seemed a little sour. I think the vinegar made it sour and the chicken broth diluted the flavor of the bbq sauce. I will make pulled pork with this process again but will continue to look for better flavor.  So many ingredients - just ok taste.

What makes this so great is adding the pulled pork back into the sauce.  Keeps it moist.  Drain slightly when putting on the rolls and we used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce on the sandwich...perfect. Watch out for the chili powder..I used hot and it was really spicy but when on the bun with the BBQ sauce it mellowed out a bit.

I am always looking for new recipes to try. Yesterday I made this pretty much exactly as written. I used bone in country pork ribs which I got on sale for $0.88/lb. The house smelled wonderful and I have never seen my husband so blown away (he loved this) and he was right! About 2 weeks ago we went to a highly acclaimed BBQ restaurant in our area. BJ said..."Now THIS is what I'm talkin' about...THIS is what I wanted 2 weeks ago and didn't get.  You could open a restaurant and just serve THIS. You'd be famous!!" I made coleslaw to go with it.

This came out fantastic!  I made a couple changes.  1. I used a 6.9 lb pork shoulder with the bone because that was the smallest at the store. 2. I substituted a beer for the chicken broth (per another reviewer's suggestion) because I didn't have any chicken broth.  Because it was larger, I cooked it on high for 9 hours.  One mistake I made was not turning it over about halfway through, so the top ended up not as cooked as the bottom.  The rest was falling off the bone and so moist though. Both my husband and my 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVED it.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce and ended up using some more when I made the sandwich because I love the taste not necessarily because it needed it.  This had a great vinegar-y, spicy taste to the pork, which is my favorite kind of BBQ.  Edited to add: DO NOT USE THYME! I made this a second time and used 1 tsp of thyme because I couldn't remember if  I used it last time. Well it ruined the entire taste.   Yuck.

What a wonderful winter meal. My husband and I fixed this Monday night for dinner Tuesday.  We had a 7-8 lb pork shoulder and after reading some of the reviews made the following changes...same amount of liquid but no oil and substituted beer for the chicken broth.  Cooked in the crockpot on High overnight. Wow the house smelled great in the morning.  Everyone loved it including our 4 year old granddaughter!  Brought some to work today so now this recipe is making its way around the office.  We will be making this again.

Oh, this is VERY tasty! Followed the directions exactly.  I did however use olive oil rather than veggie because all I had was olive oil but I agree with another poster and I think the oil could have been skipped.  Nice juicy sandwiches, that had my hubby asking for leftovers for days. lol

I thought I would have left overs, no such luck.  Everyone stuffed themselves.   I used a six pound pork shoulder and slightly increased the recipe portions to accomodate.  This is a new favorite.

This was a good way to use up a pork shoulder roast I had. Very SWEET, I usually like my pulled pork more BBQ tasting. I read a lot of the reviews before making and only changed 1 thing upon recommendations. I used pineapple juice instead of broth, glad I did. I don't think I would have enjoyed the flavor with chicken broth. I think I'll make this maybe once or twice a year for a change in our routine recipes.

This turned out soooo good. I made this for a baby shower at work and everyone LOVED it. I mixed all the ingredients together except the chicken broth and dried thyme (didn't have any or couldn't find it) and poured it in the bottom of the crock pot, then put my frozen roast on top of that. I started it at 7 at night and let it cook on low until 6:30 am. The meat was so  tender it had already fallen off the bone. I shredded the pork and strained the liquid. Put the pork back in the crock pot and added about 1 or so cups of the strained liquid. Once I got to work I put it on low and added about half a big bottle of sweet baby rays sauce to it and cooked it on low until lunch. Everyone loved it there was none left. Will be making this a lot! Thanks

Yummy!  I did do some changes though.  Instead of chicken broth I used pineapple juice. I placed the onion on the bottom of the crock pot to make a barrier between the pork and the bottom of the pot.  Then after I pulled the pork I cooked an additional 6 hours to absorb all the wonderful juices.

Would have put it as a 5 star but since I have never had a pulled pork sandwich, I don't have anything to compare it to.  The flavor is great to me. My husband says it's missing just a little something.  Very easy to make.  The house smelled wonderful all day!  Will make again.  Play around with a few different spices.

We didn't like the Tyme and honestly, it's more work that most and not all that much better.  I used Newmans BBQ Sauce.

So much better than regular BBQ pulled pork!  A little too much liquid if left behind for my liking so I use a bit less broth & ACV.

Delicious! And easy! Accidently bought bone in loin and it still worked out fine. Put out dinner rolls (cut) and it worked  out perfectly  for a pot luck as it gave a smaller serving.  I left out the thyme on purpose.

Yum. I did cook it a little longer and then shredded & put back in the sauce for while to soak up the juices. I did cut back slightly on the Chili Powder ever so slightly.

I am sure this would be ideal if there were some alterations.  First off there is way too much thyme and that’s all you can taste.  I would also probably 1/4 or no apple cider vinegar.  I agree with others there is just way too much liquid.  Sadly the thyme literally over powered the whole thing.  Not even extra bbq sauce would cover it up. Ugh!

This is the second time I've made it and would recommend a few extra steps and a change or two.
1. When shredding the meat, remove the fat.
2. Allow the liquid to cool and refrigerate overnight.  Skim the hardened grease from the top of the container.
3.  Reduce the liquid by boiling and thicken it slightly with 1 1/2 tsp of flour as you would gravy (flour and a little cold water)  The slightly thickened consistency helps keep the pork coated.  This in turn helps prevent the juice from soaking into and creating a soggy bun. 
4.  If you use an intensely flavoured BBQ sauce (which is many but not all of them), you may want to reduce the amount you use.  It can overwhelm the other ingredients in the sauce.  You can always add some to the sauce when thickening it.
5.  Because I only added 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce, I added just a little less than 1/8 tsp of smoke flavour.

Rave reviews! Teaching youngers here though. Watched the vid. No can do. We chopped the onion, placed in cooker. Scored and salt n peppered the roast, placed in cooker fat cap up. Whisked remaining ingredients in a bowl, poured over roast.
10 hr over-night cook.
Shredded the roast. Instead of putting it back in the almost 2 qts liquid, reduced it to two cups, then poured over roast, more intense flavor! (See? Didn't change 1 ingredient!)
(We prefer Everett & Jones BBQ Sauce from Oakland, Ca., not an ad, just saying.)

I tried to make it exactly.  Although, when I went to cut up my onion, it didn't look that great so I used an envelope of dried onion soup mix instead.  This was amazing!!

I like to work off base recipes and then kind of create my own thing.  Using this as a base recipe ended up with some of the best bbq pork I've ever had. I had. 1.5 pork tenderloin.  I used 3/4 cup of sweet & thick Heinz BBQ sauce and omitted the brown sugar. I added 3/4 cup of chicken broth and 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar. I used a bay leaf and a tsp of thyme, 1/2 of a large white onion, paprika and black pepper sprinkle, 2 garlic cloves, couple squirts yellow mustard, onion powder and a tsp of liquid aminos.

I omitted the oil and halved the sugar after reading the other reviews. I also used fresh thyme as I had some in the garden. The BBQ sauce I used has a significant smoky flavour. I strained the sauce before adding the shredded meat back in. It was absolutely delicious and was completely devoured at the pot luck dinner I took it to.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but I did make some substitutions. Anyway, super easy and yummy!! THE OTHER REVIEWERS ARE RIGHT. Adding oil is pointless. There’s plenty of juice and oil in the end. And it does come out quite juicy/liquidy. I chose to remove it gently and NOT shred/pull the pork and fixed it with scalloped potatoes and green beans. And THEN for the left overs I I pulled it and made it for sandwiches. Just to keep things interesting. Do yourself a favor, sub the mustard for Sweet Baby Ray’s mustard BBQ sauce. So amazing!! Yum!! Followed another reviewer’s advice and added a dash of cinnamon. Added incredible depth of flavor. Will make this again and again!

I leave out the oil and use  bone-in pork.  I've been making this same recipe for 20 plus years. I like the suggestion from someone else about freezing leftovers in muffin tins then putting the frozen portions in a freezer bag.

I omitted the thyme, doubled it, and made it with pork tenderloin. It was a great success! I will be making this again for sure. I might add red pepper flakes next time.

I followed this recipe almost as written. EASY & delicious. I cooked, low, overnight in my crockpot for 10 hours. The last hour, on high, without the cover as this seems to cook off any excess liquid. I did not use the chicken broth...as previous ppl noted it was not necessary. I shredded right in the crockpot & let it cool, then took off excess fat. It is perfect on the toasted rolls! BTW....I am not much of a cook so this was a pleasant surprise.

Yup.  5 stars. Made this on Sunday hoping to take leftovers for lunch this week, but the family devoured it instead. I followed the recipe - did not make any changes.  Besides the great taste and the easy preparation - the ingredients are all common that we had in the fridge/pantry. Thanks for sharing.

The first time I made this I did just as instructed. The 2nd time I used chicken in place of the pork. 
My family loved it both ways! As a matter of fact my daughter canceled her caterer for her wedding because she wants me to make the pulled chicken!
Going to try it with beef next!

I used a pork tenderloin instead of suggested cut.  Left out the Worcestershire sauce since I didn't have any on hand.  Smelled great while cooking.  Turned out quite dry. Flavor just ok since meat was dry; added more barbecue sauce to it for sandwiches, which helped.   Will use some of the pork in enchiladas or something with a sauce to mask dryness. Would adjust the cooking time down.

I was shocked from reading all the good reviews how badly this tasted! The vinegar is too strong... it has more of a "Carolina Barbeque" taste. The sauce is very runny and thin, and the thyme should have never been added. It was terrible and my family hated it!

I made the recipe as is except for the thyme. Don't like it. At the end which was about 5 hours, I discarded most of the juice except for about 2 cups, skimmed the fat off the top,  shredded the meat and put it back in the pot.  Added more BBQ sauce and it came out perfect.  This was my first attempt at pulled pork and I will definitely be making this again!!

WARNING!! This does NOT taste like BBQ.  This DOES taste like really good pot roast from Ecuador if you were to add a pinch of cinnamon.  NO BBQ pork EVER includes chili powder or onion as it ruins the flavor profile.  Not even in Texas where they'll fight you if try and put beans into their chili. Now, my wife is German so she had no idea she was making a batch of Yankee blasphemy for my southern family.  This might top the time she called my mom and asked what stores carried green tomatoes so she could make fried green tomatoes.  Anyway - just know what you're in for in case you've never made real BBQ.

So I followed what most people did. No chicken stock and no thyme. I doubled the recipe with 2 shoulders totalling 8 lbs and cooked it for 10 hours on low. I hate fat so with surgical precision I removed all the fat from the meat and shread it. My 8 lbs netted me 3 3/4 lbs of fat clean meat which is really shocking. I know it's pork but wow. I put it in the fridge over night. Meanwhile I strained the fluid and our that in the fridge overnight too. This morning I skimmed all the fat off the sauce and boiled it down to 1/2. It's thicker and more concentrated. I have just put the meat and the sauce back in the slow cooker and tossed it all together to mix. I'm leaving it there for 3 hours. At present it looks right and tastes decent so stay tuned. So far it has been a very easy project. I had hoped to get more than 3 3/4 lbs of pulled pork out of it but that's life.

Follow up. The consistency and juiciness of the meat is perfect and it's very tender. We are not a sweet meat family. I usually cut the sugar by half in recipes that call for it. I thought about it and should have gone with my instinct. Next time I make it I will cut the brown sugar by half but otherwise it was very good.

I have made a certain pulled pork recipe for several years, but decided it was time for a change.  I made this recipe, leaving out the chicken broth (as I did not have any) and the oil (no need for oil as pork is pretty oily).   I followed another reviewer's advice and mixed the sauce ingredients and poured them over the roast in the pot. I cooked my 4 lb bone-in roast for 10 hours on low in my slow cooker.  Also, I followed a different reviewer's advice and when the cooking was done, took the roast out and let it cool for about 20 min before shredding it and in the meantime, poured the liquid into a pan and reduced it on the stove for about 20 min.  I wanted the sauce a bit thicker so I thickened it with 2 TBS corn starch dissolved in 2 oz water,  then whisked it into the sauce until thickened.  This process is a must if you want the sauce to adhere to the meat, otherwise the sauce is too watery. Put all the pork back in the slow cooker and mix with the thickened sauce.  In the end- DELICIOUS!!!!  The best pulled pork I ever made!  Will definitely make again!

Everyone loved it.   Caution - do not use too much liquid ingredients.   When the pork cooks it will generate a lot of liquid.

I don't like using the high setting on my slow cooker but I didn't have 10 to 12 hours to cook it on low so I went for it. After 6 hours other didn't shred very good. The sauce was watery and was in desperate need of salt. It was bland which was surprising since the ingredients had such strong flavors. I don't think I'll be using this recipe again.

I did make it, without the onions since my child doesn't care for onions. However when it finished cooking is was bland. So I drained off all the pot liquids and added some honey BBQ sauce to it. Shredding with forks and it was awesome!

I've made this recipe lots of times. It's one of our favourites, so much so that my daughter has requested it for her birthday meal this weekend (two batches - one for her friends and one for the family) :) I use less chili powder, two teaspoons instead of one tablespoon. There are rarely leftovers :)

I would recommend putting half the BBQ sauce in at the beginning, and half in about 20 minutes before you eat it.  The flavor comes out stronger.

This was by far the worst bbq I have ever tasted in my life.  I have had bbq from nearly every corner of Texas, and from great places all over the South Eastern US for that matter, and I can assure you that there is nothing Texas about this recipe.

If you follow instructions and break apart the pork and then put it back into the slow cooker it is like a meat soup.  I removed half the sauce before I out it back in but it was still soupy.  My recommendation is to cut all liquids in half before you start and trim all the fat off the pork before putting it in.

Had a bunch of people coming over and wanted to give this recipe a try. I put it all in the slow cooker (onions on the bottom, pork on top and then the marinade) the evening before and left it cooking on low for 24-hours. In the morning (12-hours in) I took the layer of fat off the top of the pork (it just fell away) and broke the pork up a little with a fork. Around lunchtime I skimmed off the oil and fat from the top and gave it all a good stir (and a taste, of course) - the pork had fallen apart completely on its own by this point and tasted delicious. I stirred (and taste-tested) it a couple more times through the afternoon as the marinade reduced and the porked turned a lush brown. By the evening there was very little liquid left, just a big pot of perfectly juicy and flavoursome pulled pork which garnered lots of compliments and recipe requests. Will definitely make this again.

I really liked it. Didn't have chicken broth so I used just some water.  Didn't have bbq sauce (can't believe it!) and used ketchup, mustard, sugar, & apple cider vinegar  instead. 
Cooked it on low for 9 hours to get through the workday. Turned out very good!

I am making it right now.  This time I used my own barbecue sauce.  I also like to add a little extra spiciness with some cayenne and 1/4 tsp cumin.  My chili powder has some in it already but the extra cumin brings out the savory in the sweet pork.  I top it off with homemade slaw (less mayo more vinegar and spice)  I also used torta rolls and they held together well, like a ciabatta.

Early today I made this for the first time.  OMG, this is to die for.  It is absolutely delicious. Very tender and slightly tangy and a hint of sweet.  My son loves it so much.  He devoured two BIG FAT sandwiches within minutes to my surprise.  My husband and I love it as well. I didn't change a thing in this recipe. I followed this same recipe to a T.  This recipe is a keeper.

Wow, this turned out delicious!  A few ingredients I didn't add - personal taste, but did add in about a tsp of  liquid smoke.  I love that you can change the ingredients in the sauce a little to your liking and it still turns out great.  It was a hit for our family.  
I was surprised how inexpensive pork shoulder is too. I used a 3lb roast, that's what the meat counter had, and just decreased the sauce a little bit.

Love it! Not too sweet which is how we like it.  I followed recipe as is except I did not add the teaspoon of vegetable oil - there is usually enough fat in the pork to prevent from sticking to bottom of crockpot.  Also I cooked on low for 9 hours and it was fine.  Serve with sweet corn and beans in the summer or with mac and cheese and green beans in winter.   Easy weeknight dinner.

I just put this in the crock pot but I tasted the sauce and I know it's going to be perfect. Changes I made: I used a chili-infused olive oil instead of veg oil;  1/2 cup Guy Fieri's habanero-mustard wing sauce instead of plain mustard; and 1 T Cumin; and I cut slits in the roast and stuffed them with crushed garlic cloves, all due to personal preference. I didn't think about adding the liquid smoke. I'll run in there and add that. 
There was a little more than a cup of BBQ sauce in the bottle and a lot was stuck to the bottle so I poured the vinegar in the bottle, shook it well, then added it to the measuring cup I was using to make the sauce. No waste.
This is going to be wicked-good for Memorial Weekend Sammiches. It's going to be raining the whole time so we're bringing the bbq indoors. Thanks for the recipe. I know I'll be using this again and again. I'm already thinking of how good this will be in warm flour tortillas with Mexican rice and black beans.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe with 2 four-pound boneless pork loin roasts. I had run out of regular chili powder, so I used chipotle chili powder, and instead of my usual molasses-y barbecue sauce, I used Famous Dave's Devil's Spit sauce.  Cooked on low for 10 hours. The juice was VERY spicy, but when I mixed in the shredded pork, the spice quotient mellowed out to a nice "kick".  Very tender and juicy!

Yummy! A little tangier than the root beer recipe. I cooked on hi for 6 hours. Next time I think I'll stick closer to 5 or 51/2 as it is a little dry. Still very yummy though!

Made this for tonight's dinner and wow, so tender, moist and flavorful. I made this with a 3.25lb pork butt and let it cook in my slow cooker on high for 4.5 hours. It smelled awesome and I couldn't wait to dig in. I used a mesquite flavored bbq sauce to cook it in, then after shredding it (oh it was super tender) I lathered it with a sweet, smoky, tangy bbq sauce. Next time, I'll skip the chili powder and add smoked paprika and add more garlic.

I made this exactly as written and it turned out great!  It was flavorful and tender and juicy.  I asked the butcher at the grocery store for a 4 pound roast because what they had available in the cases was 10 pounds or more.  The butcher happily cut me a smaller roast.  The recipe made way more than what is listed.  I froze half of it.  I will make this again and again!

Followed some review suggestions.Did not add broth. past experience proved it was not needed. Did not have cider vinegar, so I omitted that.
Used a little liquid smoke, BBQ sauce & maybe 1/4 Cup juices last hour of cooking. Fantastic!!!

Very Very Good. Cooked low for 6 hours then shredded it returned it to the juice and added an additional 1/2 cup of bbq sauce. After another 1.5 hours I removed it from the juice and it was awesome.

Unbelievably Yummy!! Best pulled pork ever!! Not smothered in BBQ sauce - sauce brings out the flavor of the meat and its a thin red sauce the meat soaks in. Won't  ever use another recipe

This has a wonderful flavor!  Just right, in my opinion.  Made as written, except I used about 4 lbs of frozen pork chops (you know when you buy pork chops in bulk, there are some that aren't shaped like a chop, and not really suitable for standard pork chop recipes?  I used those.)  Served on a toasted hoagie roll.  Put the leftovers in my muffin tin, as someone else suggested, and froze.  They do make a good 1-person serving.  I know, because my husband requested more of the pulled pork the very next day, so I thawed two and made sandwiches again!  A keeper!

I let this cook about 12 hours, then shredded.  It wasn't really tender and it seemed bland so I added 1 Cup more BBQ sauce (Stubbs), 1 tsp salt and another Tbl of chili powder and let it cook for 6 more hours.  It was great after that!  I also used beer in place of chicken broth.

This recipe was just okay for me, i followed it exactly but it just tasted like pork cooked in bbq sauce to me, i could of left out everything else i added to the sauce before cooking and nothing would of changed.  I think i expected a bigger bolder flavor, and thicker sauce i guess, mine was watered down. Anyway it was fun trying this recipe in any case

Of all the many recipes I have made my boyfriend, he says this is his favorite. My only complaint is this came out a bit to vinegary for our tastes, and I could not get the sauce to thicken up without pouring into a sauce pot and heating on the stove. I think cutting back the vinegar and chicken broth will make this a real winner!

Tasty, but made these changes. Seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Place on hot gas grill and gave it a grilling/char on the outside. Placed in crock pot with onions, thyme, vinegar, and chicken broth. Cooked for the size of pork I had. Removed pork and shredded and separated the fat out. Also separated juices in crock pot. Returned juices, meat to crock pot and added barbeque sauce to my taste along with other ingredients. Simmer on low to blend flavors.

This recipe was amazing!  This was my first time attempting pulled pork and it was a hit for our Fourth of July celebration. I followed the recipe exactly and the result was heavenly!! I will try it with chicken next. Thank for such a good recipe.

Amazing...made this so many times I don't even measure ingredients anymore. Will add liquid smoke or smoked paprika once in a while. Used wild pork on occasion, too.

Didn't fly over well in our house. We trough most of it out. I believe it was too different with the apple cider vinegar & such. Would have been better if it was more simple.

Excellent! So simple and easy to double.  I used a hickory bbq sauce to add a smokey flavor.  Could also use a touch liquid smoke to create the same effect.

Very easy recipe, used beef broth in stead because I didn't have any chicken broth, other than that I followed the recipe and it was the best pulled pork I think I've ever had.  Bravo.

Made  pulled pork using this recipe for dinner today. We loved it...will use it again for sure.  Just one note: I did not use any chicken broth. Also I used a pork dry rub on my meat before placing in the crock pot.

I don't cook, I don't pretend to cook, but this was very, very easy and very good.  One question...It came out a little watery.  cooked 5.5 hours on high, we were hungary and it smelled so good we couldn't wait for it.  What do people recommend to make the "sauce" thicker?

This is the first time I've not liked a recipe that was so highly rated but this one was very bland and far to much juice. I drained the juice and mixed the meat with BBQ sauce and that was delicious.

Though not what I had originally expected, this recipe still turned out great! I used Kraft BBQ sauce, and cooked on low for ten hours. It wasn't really a problem, but I did notice that you have to eat up the sandwich pretty quick because the juice from the pork will drain into the bun (could probably strain pork). Also, in some of the photos of this recipe, I noticed that they many have added some plain BBQ sauce to the sandwich before eating. I would recommend adding some as a sort of condiment to the bun, because although the flavor of the pork was good, it could use an extra punch.

I made this recipe with chicken because I don't eat pork. It was delicious! The flavor was great and I added a little more vinegar and some cayenne pepper for a little kick.

I have never had Texas Pulled Pork so this rating is basing on our own personal tastes and not whether or not this is authentic.  After cooking on low all day the roast was simmering in a lot of juice.  I shredded the meat and stirred back into the crock, but the juice did not help flavor the pork.  We still prefer "BBQ Pork for Sandwiches" which has fewer ingredients/more liquid but seems to yield tastier meat.

I used this recipe with two 2lb loins of pork. I followed this recipe to a 'T' and it came out amazing!!!  Not too sweet, just absolute perfection!  Will definately be making this recipe on a 10 to 12 hour slow cook when I know I'm gonna have a massive hangover! :)

Made this meal with the exact recipe using Open Pit (not my first choice but we had an over abundance of it) Before shredding, I took a little bite and thought that it was a bit too tangy and vinegary (and I love vinegar).  I also thought the thyme made a bit too much of a presence, but once I added the extra sweeter BBQ sauce, it was unnoticeable.

To save this meal, I added some sweeter, thicker BBQ sauce (maybe about a 5-second squirt of it) and some more brown sugar, which probably didn't do much. 

I let it cook on low for another hour so the shredded pork soaked up the juice and it was delicioso.

I made this pulled pork recipe for the Super Bowl and everyone 'liked it', however I was not too convinced simply because it left a weird aftertaste in my mouth that I found unpleasant. I personally don't think that good pulled pork needs so many ingredients to taste good; with a few simple ingredients+seasoning and a good quality BBQ sauce you can achieve an amazing tasting pulled pork. This is not a keeper for me :(

Not up to the positives that were posted, but good results.  The meat turned out tender and I used a 4 lb butt. VERY important to trim away all external fat.  The result still had a lot of grease (typical for a butt) and I decanted the oil before putting the shredded meat back in the pot.  The variable in review results could be because of the type of BBQ sauce and I used Krafts regular.  I would not use as much vinegar next time because the sauce, mustard and the worcestershire already have a tang, and it overwhelms the dish and your house for six hours.  I used the thyme and the cayenne to recipe spec and the taste was just right. Ready to shred in 5 hours after cooking on HIGH.

This was the first time i made pulled pork, and my guests really enjoyed this recipe. Make sure you cook the pork with the fatty side up. After shredding the meat, put it back in the liquud to simmer for a bit.

Put this in the crockpot before bed and pork just fell apart in the morning.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. Perfect for lunch on a cold winter day!

Followed the recipe nearly to the letter--used dark brown sugar instead of light and cooked it for 8 hours on low--and it turned out great! I do not, however, understand how it would be barbecue-y enough to just put on a roll and go. I added a lot of barbecue sauce afterward I got all the meat out of the very thin 'marinade' it had cooked in. Great flavor.

This is a great recipe.  I did not tweak the recipe at all.  The pork comes out juicy and tender.  I have a hard time finding a 4 lb roast (can only find 5 lb or larger), but that doesn't ruin the recipe at all.  I prefer a bit more BBQ taste, so I serve some extra BBQ sauce on the side.  I also serve on butter toasted kaiser rolls and the leftovers freeze well.

Tried this recipe for the first time with a little less than 4 lbs of pork shoulder, and cooked it in the crock pot for 6 hours. It came out super moist and tender, wonderful flavor. My suggestion is that if you don't love the taste of apple cider vinegar, to use just slightly less. Also, using homemade chicken stock is ideal, but the flavor was incredible regardless, the final product didn't need anything else once it was done.

I have done this one and it is really great. I did change a few things. I added a tablespoon of liquid smoke, an extra tablespoon or two of red wine vinegar, and used spicy brown mustard. I like the North Carolina vinegar barbecue, which is why I think I like the extra ingredients I used. Used pork loin as well, since I did not have the pork shoulder. Made extra sauce for the side. Freezes well, and has been a big hit at church and school functions. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic. Will be making this regularly. I followed all of the directions except for 2 things (left the Thyme out-not a fan and we didn't have Worcestershire sauce so used Teriyaki). Everyone bragged about it.

I made this for my family a couple of weeks ago and they LOVED it!!!  I followed the recipe (except I omitted thyme).  The  ingredients are common things that I had all the ingredients in the house, and I love the simplicity of throwing everything into the crock pot and having supper ready at the end of the day.  The result was moist, flavorful meat that was so yummy I'm making it again tomorrow.

This is the first recipe I've tried from here that I seriously didn't keep, not a single bit. My husband who is not a picky eater didn't even like it. I prepared and cooked it exactly how the recipe said but with the exception of a vinegar taste, I found it to be disappointingly bland.

This is NOT the basic pour a bottle of prepared barbeque sauce over your shredded pork.  I loved that the recipe makes its own sauce as the pork cooks.  You can add more bbq sauce on top of your sandwich if needed. But the sauce itself is delish!  Great job!

I made this and I didn't know what to think of it. It reminded me more of seasonings put on stew beef. It wasn't bad but the base flavor didn't truly remind me of a pulled pork BBQ sandwich. The sauce as others mentioned was very runny. It does reduce if left on low but it never thickens. The next issue is there has to be liquid smoke in there because although I added a tablespoon it still didn't have a BBQ flavor. Both issues are due to the ingredients however. The 5 1/2 lb shoulder fell off the bone at 5 hours on high. The meat was moist and tender so I'm giving the recipe 3 stars.  A friend of mine made pulled pork at my house with the meat on low in the oven about 8 hours and used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves. He put salt, pepper and  season salt to taste and I have to say, his was better. He made his sauce on the stove and added to the meat after he trimmed and shredded it. The sauce was thick and good. He did return the meat/ sauce mixture back to the oven so they could marinate but it was delicious right then. His sauce was not runny after marinating in the oven either. Just a thought.

Had to use my bottled rootbeer BBQ sauce and with this recipe, it was delish!  Only had a pork loin a little under 2 lbs and I didn't have any garlic - so I had to use garlic powder instead.  This is a great recipe.

Made this last night, to be ready for lunch.  Oh, my husband usually likes me to tweak recipes but he begged me not to change a thing on this one, which is high praise!  I took other's suggestions and left out the chicken broth and added cinnamon.  This is divine.

Adjust the vinegar and sugar based on your BBQ sauce.  This is great but could become very tangy or sweet depending on the sauce you start with.  There is a huge amount of juice.  I had 1.5 quarts! I used a 5 lb shoulder without increasing anything else.  I used beer instead of broth.  I reduced the juices without the meat and liked the result.  I am going to cook the next one on the stove so that I can take the lid off after the meat is mostly done.  This should let the liquid reduce without an extra step.  I offer two types of BBQ sauce and hot sauce so the guests can get their sandwich just like they want.

I made this for a crowd and also grilled turkey legs and sausages the day I served this. I tend to read all the reviews as well as google other recipes for suggestions when cooking, so here's the modifications I made. I used an 18 oz bottle of BBQ sauce, Bavarian beer vinegar, red wine instead of chicken stock, omitted the oil and thyme and added more garlic, the onion and some green peppers, also chopped. I cooked this for 10 hours the day before my party and then shredded the meat and refrigerated the meat and sauce separately. The next day, I defatted the sauce (there wasn't really much fat) and heated everything back in the crockpot for about 2 hours. I served with small buns and this way people could have more than one entree. Since I had free time on the morning of the party, I prepared a large casserole of fancy Mac n cheese and popped that in the oven when the guests began arriving. Definitely a great, easy menu for a crowd.

This was excellent, and a hit!  I made this along with Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs over the weekend for a family birthday party and the pulled pork was gone in a flash!  I used 2 pounds of pork tenderloin, so scaled back the recipe by half.  Put it in my slow cooker the night before to cook and had the timer on for low for 8 hours.  So tender!  Turned it back onto the warm setting just before our company arrived and added a bit more BBQ sauce at that time.  So yummy :)

This was my first time making pulled pork; love, love the flavor. I took a few suggestions from others and I omitted the oil, no cloves but substituted with garlic powder. I will be making this again!

Delicious!  Easy to do, I used 6 lbs of pork butt, skipped the oil and the chili powder, and added the 1 tbsp cinnamon that someone had reccommended. Very flavorful, everyone loved it

Overall, this is a good recipe, largely dependent on the type of barbecue sauce used. You could probably omit the brown sugar and not miss it, as it is too sweet for my taste. Also, like other reviewers, I think it has too much liquid in the finished product. Reducing the liquid by half before adding the shredded pork and adding some liquid smoke would improve the taste. I've found that 10 to 12 hours on Low is the perfect cooking time. Have made this twice now and find that with these adjustments, might be a 4 star recipe.

Woo - made it JUST as written except the Worcestershire Sauce (who knew I was out of it???) and my family swooned!  It is a perfect summer recipe - no heating up the kitchen and the flavor was wonderful - 4 lb shoulder roast in 5 hours.  Bam!

I haven't made this yet, but I'm thinking if this were prepared in a pressure cooker, it could be ready in well under half an hour!  I've done spare ribs, etc. in about 20 minutes.  It's tender as can be--melt in your mouth and tastes like it's been simmering all day.  Plus, you save on gas or electricity by cooking this way.  Served over rice; there's nothing better!  I love that I don't have to start dinner much before I'm ready to eat.

I did just as directions said, meat turned out delicious and moist. However, I would advise seasoning with salt/pepper first on the meat then putting in crock pot. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

cut the recipe in half and used 2 pounds of chicken vs the pork.  was good but nothing amazing.  would be good (and easy) to make for a pot luck or to have on hand for a cook out.

Loved the tenderness and flavors however I would definetely cut the thyme by 2/3 so it doesn't over power the barbeque flavor.

Pretty good...not 5 stars in my opinion. I made this with a 4.5# bone-in chuck pork roast. For MY taste...it was too onion-y (I put most on top...1" dices) and would not do that next time which "might" redeem the recipe. Also, the juice was just way too oily. I did not add oil (based on reviews) and painstakingly removed the fat when shredding. I read numerous reviews and decided to cook it on low over-night (approx 9 hours). I took it out to shred, and poured the juices into a sieve to remove the solids and then added the juice and shredded meat back into my Rival 6-qt crockpot for about 2 more hours. The meat was plenty tender and juicy. What I didn't love was the flavor.  I tried to doctor it up by adding more Sweet Baby Ray's Sauce...which helped.  I finally decided to put the meat in the fridge while I put the sauce on the stove to reduce due to it being fairly "watery".  I finally gave up on the sauce after a couple of hours - it thickened but was just too oily.  I served the meat, which I heated with an additional 1/2 - 3/4 cup BBQ sauce, with warmed BBQ sauce for those who wanted more BBQ flavor.  My company seemed to enjoy the meat. It was not "bad", just didn't bowl me over like "Slow Cooker Pulled Pork" recipe from this site. Because tastes vary, I do think this is worth giving a shot, but for my own taste, I am on the fence as to whether or not I am going to give it another shot with some changes.

This is the best pulled pork recipe!  I use this recipe all the time and everyone loves it.  I don't add the oil as it doesn't seem to need it. There is a lot of liquid in the end which I usually discard most of and add more bbq sauce.  This one always comes out nice and moist.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is outstanding!  I combined all the sauce ingredients the night before and stored that covered in the fridge so all the flavors would meld together. I followed the recipe just as it was except for the thyme and the oil. (I omitted both)  I also added 2 tbs of liquid smoke like another reader suggested. I cut up my onions the night before as well so that I wouldn't have a big fuss in the morning, and I liked the idea of putting the onion slices on the bottom to act as a rack for the meat. I started out by cooking on high for the first hour and then turned it down to low for the another 8 hours.  2 hours before guests arrived, I took the meat out of the cooker and shredded it on a platter....I poured the juices through a collander catching most of the fat and all of the onions.  I added a little cornstarch with cold water to thicken up the sauce.  I returned the meat to the slow cooker and then poured the sauce evenly over it all.  2 more hours this way on low and I served it on whole wheat buns with cole slaw, corn bread and big ol pickles!  A meal I'll be repeating for sure!

This is my go-to pulled pork recipe because I love how you make your own sauce instead of just totally relying on a bottled sauce. I mean, there's nothing wrong with a bottled sauce for one-step convenience, but this recipe has that made-from-scratch deliciousness that comes from adding a little of this and a little of that. I've made this several times, thinking I'd have leftovers for the next day. But no. Served with homemade apple coleslaw, this makes everyone beg for more. And I love it when they beg. Don't you?

This had to be the most amazing pulled pork I've ever made. I used 2 lbs of pork tendlerloin instead of the 4lb pork roast. I left the rest of the ingredient amounts the same. To make it even a little easier I used frozen chopped onions instead of chopping my own. This was so, so tasty and will become very regular in our menus.

This was delicious!  Best slow cooker pulled pork we've tried yet.  The vinegar wasn't overpowering at all, it added just the right amount of tang to balance the sugar and sweetness in the bbq sauce.  Will definately make this again.

Great! So far I have used this recipe with a pork roast, chicken, and a deer back strap. The deer turned out so tender it fell apart.

Before you start, know that this recipe has a LOT of leftover liquid, but it is very useful, so hang on to it in the freezer!

First time I made this it was pretty good. Wasn't quite enough bbq for my taste, so I added more. It gets 4 stars for being fairly easy, and making a lot of food (which was the point)

The second time through, I made a LOT of changes. Different portions of everything (mostly just guessing), and I seasoned the pork beforehand. I took out almost all of the juice and stored it in the freezer, and put the pork in the fridge overnight. The next morning I cooked it on low with some bbq, brown sugar, and some leftover drippings from the day before, and it turned out amazing. Definitely a good recipe.

This was my first time making pulled pork and it was perfect!  I did cheat a little and bought the pre-measured spice packed for pulled pork from McCormicks.  It had the same spices and it saved me money.  I also added a cup of ketchup instead of bbq sauce and didn't use any chicken stock.  I cooked my 4 lb shoulder on high for an hour and low for 7 1/2.  I will definitely be making this again!  My boyfriend and I didn't even bother with the buns and we each had seconds.  Yummy!

I made a 3.5 lb pork roast using this recipe, but in the oven at 225F for 4hr 15min. Poured off the sauce and reduced it slightly in a pan, while I shredded the pork. Added meat to the pan, stirred and served. Absolutely fabulous recipe. Will use it again and again and again. Thanks for sharing.

this is an excellent base recipe!!!! 2 tsp. liquid smoke.. 2 chopped chipotle peppers(in adobo)...and searing the roast in a pot (on all sides) before adding to the slow cooker....makes this recipe out of the park!!

This has a great taste but I found it to be a little watery at the end.  All I did was remove the pork & shred it, then add only some of the sauce back in, enough to moisten the meat.  when I served it on sandwiches, I let each person add the desired amount of bottled BBQ sauce.  That wound up being perfect.  Thanks for the recipe; I now realize how simple this is to make!  Great for crowds  :)

This recipe is great I added a little extra chicken broth I felt there wasn't enough liquid for the sauce. I also added about a cup more of BBQ sauce after I pulled apart came out great.

This made really great pulled pork for slider night in our house. Might try adding a few other spices to bring out that pork flavor some more but this is a great recipe even without.

Bland. I am still looking for the right combination of ingredients to bring this to life.  I added a shot of bourbon and couple of ozs. of molasses.  I am guessing that plain whit vinegar instead of apple cider and lessen chicken broth might make this more tangy.  Maybe some red pepper flakes would help - but this recipe needs help.

This is the first time I've ever made pulled pork.  It smelled so good while it was cooking!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very watery so instead of putting the pork back into the juices, because I was worried it would be to runny,  I just added a whole bunch of Sweet Baby Ray's brown sugar BBQ sauce to the pulled pork and it was so delicious!  Everyone loved it!  We topped the sandwiches with the Easter Grass Slaw from this site and it was so good!

This recipe was delicious and full of flavor, but I thought it was a little watery.   I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using Pam to spray the dish and not using oil.  I would not hesitate to make this again.

Have tried this several times now, and am NEVER disappointed!  My family LOVES the way it smells all day while it's cooking.  I usually do cook it 8-10 hours, and spoon off the grease occasionally.

I used five pounds of pork roast and as a result I needed more BBQ sauce than I had on hand. I'm still giving it 5 stars because it was wonderful and would have been better if not for me.  Tons of leftovers which I always love.

I follow this recipe completely for the cooking, however, I also usually serve it with a side of bottle barbeque like Smoking Joe's hot N' Spicy or something similar to add a bit more tang to the sandwiches.

This recipe is perfect! Only thing I did different was use vegetable stock instead of chicken because I had some I needed to use. It's a keeper for me. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I adore this recipe. I'm making it for the 4th time today, and am already excited for dinner. I normally use more BBQ sauce for added flavor. We make enough for leftovers, and it's almost better on following days. I used leftovers once to make a makeshift shepards pie (using bbq sauce in lieu of gravy or other liquid), and it was so good it was almost criminal.

Absolutely amazing recipe. I did not have any cider vinegar so I replaced it with balsamic salad dressing.

This is excellent!  Just the right amount of sauce for the pork.  Don't need to change a thing.  It also freezes well.  I make a bunch and freeze it in small portions for a yummy lunch or quick dinner anytime.

So good....skipped the vegetable oil and used cooking spray instead, skipped the onion because I didn't have one, and used Famous Dave's original BBQ sauce.  Cooked on low for 10 hours and it turned out great!

This was my first time making a pulled pork but omg it turned out amazing. I had to alter the recipe a bit due to lack of ingredients, I used beef broth instead of chicken, didn't any of the vinegar, onion or garlic cloves (used a bit of powder instead). I also didn't have any brown sugar, lol! But its obvious you can work with what you have and still make it work. I'd say the two key elements are the broth & bbq sauce! I cannot wait to make something like this again! Just delicious!

Very good. A definite keeper! I added a tsp. of smoke, like the smokey flavour, but next time I'll cut down, by 1/2, on the vinegar and sub some dry white wine. Removed the meat and put the sauce into a small pot and add 2 TBSP. with water at the end to make a thicker sauce. To good to throw out.   Well done and thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe and easy to make.  I cooked in slow cooker on high for 3 hours and low for 3 hours and turned out great.  I did cut back on the thyme as others suggested - used about 3/4 tsp.  All in all an excellent recipe.

I made this exactly as written using a 4.5 pound bone-in sirloin roast I found on sale for 99 cents a pound.  What a bargain it turned out to be with this recipe.  We found it excellent and with just the right touch of sweet-spicy flavoring.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This needed something - wasn't "tangy" enough for my tastes - maybe needs extra barbeque sauce...

I followed this recipe exactly but after I removed the pork and shredded it I drained all the liquid out of the crock, added the pork back, and drizzled with a touch of bottled barbeque sauce. I haven't found a slow cooker pulled pork recipe that I don't have to do that in the end. The pork needed salt but otherwise was a good method. We serve ours with toasted (sometimes buttered) french rolls and sweet pickles on top.

Very good!  I unfortunately forgot the onion but it was still great without it.  It will be too soupy if you keep all of the liquid in it - just add enough of the juice back in after shredding to keep it moist.  Makes A TON of leftovers.

Made this for my friends the other day. Followed recipe to a T, except I cooked it on high for 4 hours, and then slow for 3. 
I rarely cook pork, and didn't know that "pork butt" in fact comes from the shoulder. I used a 7.5 lb pork butt and doubled the rest of the ingredients.
IT WAS AMAZING!!!
My friend from Tennessee said it was the best pulled pork he's had in a long long time. 
Thanks for sharing!

Used a 3lb pork roast for 5 hours and made no other changes and it was delicious.  It will definitely be added into my recipe book for dinner.  This would be great to serve when having guests (vs burgers).  I made ours with sweet potato fries and it was perfect.

It was definitely better than any store bought pulled pork out there. That said, there was something about the sauce that was lacking. I won't make this recipe again but it made for a decent dinner.

This is the best pulled pork recipe I've ever made. I didn't use the worcestershire sauce because I didn't have it but other than that I followed the recipe to the t.

My husband loved this recipe.  I made it for his birthday and he couldn't get enough of it.  I didn't have any because I am not a BBQ fan, but I asked him how he would rate it.  He said it could have been a little bit sweeter, but other than that it was the best home made pulled pork he had ever had.  He said compared to his favorite from a BBQ place, this was a close second.

This recipe was sinful, it was so good!  I used a 7 pound pork shoulder butt, and so I used about 150% of everything in the sauce, to include the spices.  There was plenty of sauce left over, and after the pork finished in the slow cooker, I had to skim off some fat.  Next time, I might consider not increasing the amount of the ingredients for the sauce, even with the larger cut of meat.  Definitely toast or pan fry your buns because of the liquid that the meat holds after cooking.  I put our crock on "low" for about 7 hours, pulled the pork, returned the meat to the crock, then continued on "low" for another 3-4 hours.  Melt in your mouth good.  No need to eat out when you have this recipe!

I liked the flavor.  It didn't get the meat tender enough for my liking.  I had to use a knife and shave the meat.  Next time I'll use the same recipe, except I'll cook it in the oven @ 350.  Cook it 1 hour for every pound of meat.

This recipe was o.k. I thought that the thyme made it taste like roast chicken (weird) and that the sauce was not sticky or gooey enough. More like a pot roast than pulled pork.

This was excellent!  Wonderful flavor.  I did add more barbeque sauce than it called for.  I removed the pork after 10 hrs., shredded it, then drained about half of the sauce; added pork back and even added additional barbeque sauce at that time.  It helped it be a little less watery.  I used a combo of Stubbs original barbque sauce and the spicy flavor. Also added a Tbls. of soy sauce.  Very good!

I have made this twice now and both times it is perfect!  Just the way I like it, not too vinegary and tender.  Plus, you don't have to do the final step so for those in the house who do not like sauce, can have their "plain" (yet very flavorful!) barbecue.

This recipe was pretty good just a little too sweet for me.  I like my pulled pork a spicy with a hint of sweetness.  I try this recipe again I will use less brown sugar.

This was WAY too sweet for us.  I'd make sure to watch the sugar vs. your choice of bbq sauce and the amount of sweet that will add to the taste.  Also, be sure the pork has very little fat covering it - I don't frequently make BBQ in a crock pot and ended up with a much fattier liquid than I wanted. I would also dice and not chop the onion so it cooks down more.  This was not my favorite recipe, I wanted more smoky bbq flavor with the ease of crock pot cooking.  I'll keep searching for one I like.

I thought this was a great recipe!  I used KC Masterpiece Original and it was great.  My only changes are I omitted the thyme and in the future, I would use half of the brown sugar.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written, and in the end I found it to be edible, but not pleasant.  It was WAY too sweet, and the barbecue sauce flavor was too much.  The texture did turn out great, and it looked fantastic, but when I bit into it, I just got this overwhelming tangy, way-too-sweet mouthful of barbecue.  I will either have to keep looking for another recipe or perhaps read some of the reviews to see if anyone had some suggestions to cut that sweetness.  Thanks for the recipe, but it's not my cup of tea.

I just made this for July 4th...*Note I'm a vegetarian, but my guests were not, so I went for it.  
EVERYONE loved it!  
I used Bullseye Mesquite BBQ sauce $1.99 from Smart and Final.  I followed all the directions.
With the Mesquite it was tangy I read you can make it sweeter with honey BBQ.
Thanks!

Fantastic!  You can vary the flavor by your choice of BBQ (spicy, mesquite, etc).  We use a slow cooker or a dutch oven on low for a real slow cooked taste based on the size of the roast. Remove the bones towards the end, turn up the heat and reduce the sauce & meat together for a thicker consistency. Delicious even without a bun!

This recipe has wonderful flavor.  Since I was only cooking for two people, I used a smaller pork roast rather than the shoulder.  The taste was good, but the meat was a little dry.  You really need all the fat in the shoulder.  So if you're cooking for a crowd, don't waste money on a more expensive cut of meat.  Go for the shoulder as indicated in the recipe. You won't be disappointed.

I would have to agree with the previous posters' reviews in that the sauce has no flavor.  I did take their advice and season the meat before slow cooking it but when I went to shred the pork, it still didn't have a lot of flavor.  I had to put even more salt in the sauce, more bbq sauce and almost a tablespoon of red pepper flakes!  After all of my doctoring, it is pretty good.  I had some leftovers and they will get eaten.  But will I make this recipe again?  Nope.

This was totally not what I expected.  I ended up basically with a pork roast floating in a thin flavorless liquid. I ended up removing the roast from the liquid, pulled the meat apart, put it back in the slow cooker with about a cup of Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce with some teriyaki sauce added to it.  That helped a great deal.  Also, the meat needs to be seasoned prior to cooking.  I rubbed mine in seasoning salt, paprika, pepper, & Grill Mates mesquite and it was still bland.  I guess I'm just used to my meat having much more flavor than this turned out.  Will not be making this again. Update -- I am updating this rating because with the changes I made the meat is delicious the 2nd day.

I love this recipe. I have made it probably 5 times so far. Every time is fantastic. It is the only slow cooker recipe I don't ruin. Its awesome and feeds a family of 5 with leftovers.

Followed the recipe exactly. Thought this was good but not great.  I thought the vinegar taste was too strong. I might make this again, but I would try a different recipe first.

This recipe yields a ton of pulled pork! It was my first attempt at making it and it got tons of compliments. I'm not sure I need to try any other recipes.. this one is a keeper!

I made this the other night, I don't eat pork but my family does, I asked my husband to taste it, and the look on his face said it all, I left the room and he decided to serve himself.  Came out very good.

I live in Texas .  . . . this rocks. I make the recipe using only 2 lbs of meat and the meat-sauce ratio is just right for us. I also use Coleman's dry mustard rather than prepared. And if you don't have a slow cooker, brown the onions in the oil first, then brown the meat a bit, and add the sauce. I keep it at low for about 3-4 hours and it's great.

Amazing! This was the perfect Super Bowl food! I followed the recipe but used 5lbs. of pork and added a little more chicken broth and bbq sauce and cooked it on low for about 7 hours. It was so tasty. I will be making this for every Super Bowl party from here on out! Thank you.

Delicious!  Although I did change it a little to   remove some of the sugar.  I used 1/4 c bbq sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, and 6oz can of tomatoe pasted instead of 1 c bbq sauce.  And instead of the sugar I used 1/4 tsp pure stevia extract.  Plus I left out the chili powder and thyme.

The flavors in this recipe are excellent. I made no changes, but I did cook on low for just under 10 hours. I could barely remove the roast without it falling apart. I shredded the meat and returned it back into the slow cooker while I toasted the buns and made some coleslaw. Very easy and a perfect busy day meal.

I love slow cooker recipes, and this one was terrific.  I followed the recipe exactly and cooked it for about 7 hours on low/medium.  It shredded perfectly and tasted great on our homemade honey wheat sandwich rolls.  This one is a keeper!

Delish!!!!!!   My husband was skeptical about doing pulled pork in the crockpot.. but he loved it and said it was even better than smoking it on the barbeque!   So easy to make too - the prep took less than 10 minutes.

This was excellent. I used a Boston Butt and followed the recipe exactly. Put it on before we left for church. It was ready by the time we got home. We had corn on the cob and fresh sliced garden tomato with it for a great summer sunday meal. I will make this again many times. Thanks for sharing it!

I made this for my family and they seemed to enjoy it.  I had 5 1/2 lb pork butt and cooked it on low for 9 hours.  After putting in all the ingredients, I sprinkled the top of the roast with garlic powder and also added a couple of splashes of liquid smoke.  After cooking, I drained the juice from the crockpot and put the shredded meat back in with a cup of BBQ sauce.  Delicious.

This turned out great - just mixed in a bit more bbq sauce right before serving so it'd be extra saucy. Also, cooked it on low for about 9 hours.

I served this for July 4th on steak rolls with cole slaw on the side for guest to add on top if desired.  It was delicious and I was very pleased!  I used a 5 pound roast, honey BBQ sauce and a very large vidallia onion.  I did not use the oil in the bottom because there was plenty of fat on the bottom of the roast.  I did not add extra BBQ sauce before serving. However, I had sauce available for guest to use if wanted.  Thank you  Catherine for providing us with such a easy and delicious dish.

This was delicious!  I changed the recipe slightly by adding liquid smoke.  I lessened the bbq sauce, added more garlic, and cooked the pork for 6 hours on high, 3 more on low.  This made the meat extremely tender.  I served over french bread as the hamburger buns literally melted upon contact with the juices from the dish.

Easy and delicious!  I omitted the thyme and oil.  I added a bit of ketchup and a few shakes of hot sauce to the bbq sauce/vinegar mixture.  My daughter said it was the best BBQ sandwich ever, so it's a keeper.  My husband had two huge sandwiches and asked that I make again soon.  Served with my homemade coleslaw (killa!) on the side and french fries.

Very good!  I doubled the sauce since my slow cooker is an oval shape.  I forgot to add the thyme, but it was ok without it.

I used the receipe as printed, but increased or  added to it as follows:  2 tbs of mustard  6 pound shoulder roast, increased barbeque sauce (sweet baby rays sauce) to 1 3/4 cups,  and added  2-3 tbs of cholulu hot sauce.     I changed meat preperation as follows: I rubbed shoulder roast with JOHN HENRYS PIG  RUB and cooked on charcoal grill at 275-300 for  1 1/2 - 2 hours with indirect heat to give the meat a smoked flavor.  I than placed the roast in the  slow cooker followed the recipe cooking directions.   The meat finished up with a spicey smokey taste. Adds about 2 hours to cooking time, but gives you more flavor. Thanks for great receipe, Qwikdraw

I thought this was really good.  My slow cooker took longer than 5 hours to finish it though.  I only dumped half the sauce back in with the pulled pork as well since it would have been too much.  The toasted bun adds ALOT I would not skip this step.

My husband asks for this about once a month.  I made it the first time without the onion because I didn't have one and the next time added the onion.  We both prefer it sans onions.

This was absolutely wonderful... Melts in your mouth. Followed recipe with the exception that I did not have any dried thyme but it was still great. I will make this again and again. A definite keeper that will go into my recipe box. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Made this twice now and it turned out great both times.  The only change to the ingredients was that I left out the onion (because a member of our family objects to them strongly), and it was still great.

Oh Wow!!!!  I have been slow cooking pork roasts for a long time, and they have never turned out this good!  I did everything except used thyme, because I didn't have any.  Also, my roast wouldn't fit in my crock pot, so I put it in the oven at 300 for about 3 hours, then upped it to 350 for the last hour and a half.   This tasted like professional barbecue.  So yummy!

This is very tasty!  I had leftover pork chops that I want to reuse in a different dish.  This was it!  I cut the recipe in half, shred 3 pork chops, sauteed the garlic and onions in a saucepan, added the other ingredients and left it on low for 15 minutes to let the flavors combine.  Then I added the pork chops and heated through.  It was a great way to use our leftovers.  I would also love to try this recipe as it was intended.

This was the best pulled pork I have ever had. I actually used a 7 1/2 lb pork shoulder bone in and cooked it on high for about 7 hrs and used all of the ingredients listed. It was awesome, the bone came right out completely clean. My husband and his friends ate it all!!! I plan on maaking again this weekend for the World Series game. GO PHILLIES!!!

Absolutely delish! We loved it, I made homemade WW Buns to go with it. Mine was a big 6 pounder so I cooked it on high a bit longer. Fantastic! Everyone loved it & I'm glad I have leftovers. I was even able to freeze some.

This was absolutely the easiest thing!  I couldn't find pork shoulder so I used pork sirloin and it turned out really well.  A huge hit!  This is definitely giong in my go-to recipe box!

This was fabulous and I made a ton of it to serve over 100 hungry party guests.  It was so amazing that even my full blooded Hawaiian friends asked for the recipe!!!

Very, very good recipe!  I made exactly as written and it turned out wonderful!  My husband doesn't like a lot of sauce on his pork so after shredding the pork I only added a small amount of the juice back into the meat.  It really was amazing...can't wait to show my mom up with this one!  Will definitely make again!

fantastic! i would suggest a sweet molasses based BBQ sauce because the apple cider vinegar gives it a nice tang. freezes superbly and is good in the fridge for like a week! only gets better lol.

YUM. I skipped the vegetable oil. It was unnecessary. I had to use dried onion because my husband hates fresh. This was so tender and flavorful. It cooked all day on low and was ready when we got home from work. Made great leftovers too.

I have tried other pulled pork recipes and didn't like them at all.  This recipe is awesome.  The change I made was to add only 1/4 cup of vinegar instead of 1/2 cup. I was afraid that it would be too much vinegar. I used a pork tenderloin to cut down on the fat.  It was great and I will make it again.

I absolutely love pulled pork and was very happy to find this recipe.  I didn't change anything in the recipe and it came out delicious!  I did take it out of the crockpot after 5 hours instead of the full 6-7 hours.

I used a 4 lb. Pork Loin instead of a 4 lb. pork shoulder. All I can say is, out of 4 lbs. of meat, there was none left over.

This is a great recipe and one I will make time and time again. - D. Brown

Texas girl here that’s been in South Florida with no BBQ worth calling BBQ anywhere near me. I added more garlic (doubled it) & did everything else as stated. It was delicious & we’ve been enjoying the leftovers for two days now!

great recipe,  I halfed it with a 2lb  pork loin and tweaked the ingredients due to being out of chicken broth, I just strained the noodles from a can of chicken noodle soup and no problem.

Sauce was too watery and flavorless. Would have saved time and been 100 times better cooking it in plain water, shredding it, and dumping generic bbq sauce on it. Really don't understand all the 5 star ratings.

I made this in a pressure cooker and it turned out pretty well. It was only my second time using my pressure cooker, so I didn't adjust the liquids and it came out a bit soupy. Once I'd boiled it down it was DELICIOUS. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious!!  I made it as written except skipped the oil and cooked it in the slow cooker on low for about 18 hours. While I was shredding the pork I skimmed the fat off the remaining juices and reduced the liquid before returning it all to the crock pot to keep warm until my guest arrived.

What can I say that hasn't already been said? I followed the recipe exactly, and I loved the result. I think a lot of the credit goes to my choice of sauce - Famous Dave's Devil's Spit. Good for people who love a bit of spice. This is now my go-to recipe for pork BBQ.

The use of thyme was very unusual and overpowered the taste. If we made it again would definitely be omit that spice from the recipe. Certainly an easy meal to make but not at all our cup of tea. Far better recipes out there.

We found this to be bland. Next time I’ll add some liquid smoke  or maybe more barbecue sauce. It’s close, but it needs something.

Kept the recipe pretty much as is, and the kids (and others at the family gathering) loved it!  The only changes I made were:

- Using a bigger pork shoulder roast (5+pounds) and cooking it longer to compensate for the larger size.
- Used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of 1/2 cup (because the tetra pack came in 1c. size and to compensate for the larger roast). 

Huge success, and well-liked by all!  This is a way easier recipe than the one from my slow-cooker book at home - no searing and pre-cooking of the onions!

I've been wanting to perfect my pork shoulder cooking both on the grill and in the crock pot.  On the grill I am 0 for 1 and in the crock pot I am 1 for 2.  My 1 in the crock pot was a GRAND SLAM thanks to this simple recipe.  The flavor is amazing and the pork pulls apart effortlessly.

The only mistake I made was doubling the entire recipe because I had twice the meat (pork shoulder).  Doubling works for everything except the cayenne.  Although it's fantastic to me (I love spicy foods) no one in my family, except my 9 year old, will touch the stuff.

Next time I make this recipe, which will be soon, I'll double the recipe but keep the cayenne as recommended.  

Thank you for saving my average.  Looking forward to trying it again so the whole family can experience the greatness.

It was nice however there was too much vinegar in the recipe so had to balance it out with some of the other ingredients. My recommendation is to halve the vinegar content as  half a cup is way too much...

I made this recipe using pork tenderloin instead of shoulder. After 6 hours on high, it did indeed shred very nicely! However, I found the flavour of the apple cider vinegar was a little too pronounced, and overall the flavours of the BBQ sauce and brown sugar didn't really "cling" to the meat.

I made this twice in a week!  We really enjoyed it the first time, cooked it on high as noted.  Second time, tried it on low overnight and it had a really strong burned flavor.  I will give it another try...on high :)

I used a 5 lb. pork loin.       The juice was to thin and it was more like it was boiled.  So I ended up taking it out of the crock pot after it had cooked the required time  6 hours.    I put it in my oven in a shallow pan and added about half the liquid from the crock pot and baked it at 350 for an additional hour to brown it and so the juice would cook down and thicken.     I will say it was ok after cooking it in the oven with the lid off the pan so the juice could thicken up and the pork could brown.    I doubt I will make this recipe again.

Wow- that is a pulled pork recipe!! It was amazing, everyone gobbled it up. Leftovers gone early the next day. It looks like a long recipe but it's all normal handy ingredients and you just dump them into the slow cooker so prep and cleanup is nothing. A truly fine and well put together recipe. The only thing I changed was I  skipped the onions and cut back on the mustard so that everyone would love it.  And they really really did!  This is my new pulled pork recipe for every time. Thank you for sharing!

Really liked it, pork was awesome, i strained the sauce and reduced/thickened it on the stove top, before adding the meat back in. Worked great.

This came out so well. I am still new to cooking and this was so easy to do. The only difference is I used an instant pot to pressure cook on high for 90 mins and did a natural release. I will definitely do this again.

Wickedly good!
I wasn't expecting much with this because I have always thought pulled pork was just ok. This was AMAZING! I used the ingredients but eyeballed the measurements in a hurry, turned the slowcooker on, and walked away.  My foodie family loved it, argued over the leftover bits in the bowl, declared that I definitely needed to make it again, and that I didn't make enough. This one goes in the books as a house staple! To be clear we used farm fresh pasture raised pork shoulder roast, whether that had an effect on taste..maybe, I can't say, but I'm not going to do it any other way to find out ;) this was awesomeness. 
From a serious foodie family

Ran out of liquid about two hours before it finished. However, it had already cooked for eight hours, and two of those hours were on high. The pork roast had thawed overnight in the fridge before hand. Added half cup of water and a few more squirts of barbecue sauce. Delicious!

I used a 2.5 lb pork loin and cooked on low for 8 hours with everything else as written in the recipe.  It was fabulous!  Served with coleslaw and cornbread pudding.  Great recipe- thank you!

amazingly good in a short amount of time.  I followed this recommendation - though they cooked if for much longer - my results in 6 hours were perfect  - I pulled it out and shredded / added some more bbq sauce and put in the oven to warm until needed                                                   :
 I use a 6-7 lb. bone-in shoulder. I've used a deboned and a bone-in and the bone-in definitely comes out a little tastier. I leave out the oil and the chicken broth, because I think the broth makes it too juicy and I just don't think the oil is necessary. Instead, I just put in the entire bottle of barbeque sauce. I use like 10 cloves of garlic and a huge vidalia onion. You don't have to bother chopping up the onions or garlic too small because by the time it's done, they're all dissolved. I put in closer to 1/2 cup brown sugar, 8 or so drops of Liquid Smoke, two tablespoons of chili powder and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon.

I really wanted to love this recipe. The meat was just way too wet and soggy for our liking. We did not put the meat back in the juices either. I’m fact, i tried to steam some of it off in a pot on the stove but it didn’t work. Glad most everyone else loved it!

Have to agree with the less positive reviews. The sauce for this is definitely too watery and lacks in flavour. I think most of the problem is the large amount of fluid that cooks out of the onion. I'd probably skip out on the chicken broth entirely next time to try and compensate for that, and probably double the BBQ sauce. I also added some salt and some sriracha to give it a little heat.

Ehhhh, just ok. I followed the directions to the letter and I wasn't impressed. It wasn't bad by Any means but I wouldn't make it again. My husband who loves good bbq and isn't as picky as I am also thought it was just ok.

Brought this to a work pot luck and everyone was asking for the recipe!  I used two 3.5 lbs roasts (I have a big slowcooker) and put it on low and let it cook it overnight (~12 hours) and BOOM it is now a favorite.

Very good flavor! I would leave out the thyme next time I make it.

Yes, really delicious but I have to say I loved it much better the 2nd day!! The flavors absorbed into the meat more and it was even better!

Followed the recipe all the way, besides adding a little apple butter for the fun of it. 


Cooked on low for 10-12 hours, flipped it a couple times and basted it. Then let it rest, then shredded it, and put it back into the pot to soak up the juices. Kept it on warm.  Turned out delicious! Will be making again.

This pulled pork was awesome! I felt the Thyme was too overpowering for this recipe and will omit the next time around, but I will definitely be making this again. I made 1.5 times what the recipe called for and it fed 5 adults and 1 toddler and I have a TON of leftovers. I froze 1/2 the leftovers in a muffin tin for 2hours and then put the “muffins” into a ziplock freezer bag! Now I have perfect sandwich sized leftovers!

We enjoyed this recipe.  Left the mustard out due to a food allergy in the family.  Next time, I may reduce or look for a substitute for the apple cider vinegar as I didn't love the smell of it while the meal was cooking all day - but the taste was good.  Served topped with coleslaw on soft rolls.

My son wanted barbeque for his birthday party and I didn't want to spend a ton of money. We ordered brisket and sausage from our favorite barbeque joint but I opted to try pulled pork on my own, thinking it would at least turn out good enough to fill up our guests bellies. It was a huge hit! I'm not usually a very successful cook, but I was told the pork was better than the restaurant bought brisket. Others just assumed the pork was also from the restaurant.  I passed this recipe out several times at the party. I will definitely be making this again!

This was the best pulled pork recipe we have tried so far, didn't even need extra BBQ sauce!

Only change I made was I used a Dutch oven instead of a slow cooker, and cooked in the oven at 325F for 4 hours.

You may want to adjust (perhaps eliminate) the brown sugar, based on how sweet your preferred barbeque sauce is.  I used a sauce that is already somewhat sweet (should have thought of this in the first place) and this recipe came out too sweet for my tastes.  I will try it again, with the same sauce, but eliminate the brown sugar.

Made 30# of this for meals on wheels. I didn't have the thyme but it turned out just fine. Also didn't use apple cider vinegar. Just used regular. I use what I have on hand and it turned out perfectly slow cooked for 12 hrs.

Made this recipe but changed a couple of things. Did not use the onion because they make me unhappy and the pork came out great after cooking on high for 4 hours and then in low for another 4.5.  I added a half teaspoon of liquid smoke to add some “smoke flavor”.  I will do this again as it is a simple way to have moist, tender pulled pork with little intervention.

Fast and easy and the meat cooked well, but the flavor was a bit meh. Probably has a lot to do with what BBQ sauce you use, but I found the sauce to be way too watery to be really usable, so the flavor fell short.

It was just okay:  too much thyme & vinegar and it was way too watery.  I’d suggest removing the cooked pork from the crock pot  and shredding it,, then using your favorite BBQ sauce for sandwiches.

Very easy and straight forward recipe to follow. I made a 5lb roast so I adjusted the ingredients accordingly. I only added about 1tbsp of the brown sugar to have a more savory flavor. I also added S & P to the pork before putting in the slow cooker. Once done I strained the sauce, added a corn starch slurry, and reduced it in a pot before adding it to the meat. The pulled pork was very tender and flavorful. I'll use this recipe again!

made it about 1/3 rd the amount as I'm alone, but am totally disappointed. I think all those extra ingredients take away the true flavour of the pork. Especially disliked the apple cider vinegar flkavour. think that apple sauce as a side dish would do better than the intrinsic sauerness of the applecider in the finished pulled pork.

I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't add thyme, I even toasted the buns.  I thought this recipe turned out way too runny.   I had to take out most of the liquid when it was done because it was like soup.  The flavor was also pretty bland, so I ended up adding more BBQ sauce.   IF I was to ever make this again (because it was easy) I would only use half of the broth if any at all. (I think a dr. pepper or some other cola would be better.) I wouldn't use the oil at all it was super greasy.  I'd also add a dash of salt.

This is the best pulled pork recipe I've come across! It's so easy, with very little prep time! perfect for busy family life!

I used it to make pulled pork burritos (we get many meals out of it) and use the leftovers for pulled pork on the top of burgers and just pulled pork in a roll for lunchtimes. It's absolutely delicious!

Fantastic! I use the sauce portion of the recipe to re-purpose my pork roast leftovers. My family loves it. I use the juice from cooking the pork in place of chicken broth. One of the best parts of this recipe is it uses ingredients I always have on hand.

Terrific.  When it was done, I added another cup of bbq sauce cause we like it saucy.  Made onion Stearns by thin slicing a sweet onion and tossing them in flour and quick fried to crispy. Coleslaw on top... YUM!

I used honey instead of the brown sugar, and chipotle chili powder. It turned out fantastic!!! Extremely flavorful and easily shredded. I also used Gulden’s brand spicy mustard instead of prepared mustard. We served it on long rolls with tomato onions and pickles. Extremely tasty!!!!!!!! Also used a bone in pork shoulder on sale at my local grocery store.

Very good recipe, my husband thought it excellent and he used to work in restaurants for years. I never knew it could be so easy to make pulled pork. I will never buy it already prepared again. Cooked on low for about 11 hours, pulled apart beautifully. Makes great sandwiches.

This is an easy recipe to put together.  The meat is flavorful, the sauce was too thin for our taste.  I will do something different next time.  As I said the meat had a good flavor.

I've been making this about once a month for a couple of years now,  everyone loves it! It's so quick to put in the cooker and the house smells amazing! It's so easy my 12 year old often makes it himself.  A great way to feed a crowd,  too!

This is a tasty pulled pork recipe. I followed it exactly except for the chili powder which I did not have on hand. There was quite a bit of juice so after shredding I put it in a serving dish and ladled some of the juice over it.  I definitely will use this as my pulled pork recipe in the future, it has a wonderful flavor.

I tried this recipe a while back and didn’t enjoy it. So I decided to try one more time before writing it off. I’m so glad I did. Seems last time I probably didn’t get a good roast. This time it shredded much more easily. I omitted the thyme and oil as previous reviewers suggested. Cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours then low for another 3 1/2 hours and the meat was shredding easily at that point. Lastly, because I wanted a thicker sauce, I reduced the liquid from the crockpot (it takes a while as previous reviewers mentioned) and added a tablespoon of cornstarch. Now it’ll be my go to for pulled pork!

Very tasty. I did not have apple cider vinegar so I used regular white vinegar. I also added a bit more brown sugar and used less BBQ sauce. I did not have a pork shoulder roast but had a pork sirloin roast that I used instead. My first time making pulled pork and it turned out well. Will definitely make again.

My boyfriend and I absolutely love love love this recipe. We used to frequent a popular hipster BBQ joint near by regularly to have pulled pork. I stumbled upon this recipe and figured I give it a try; it's EVEN better than the popular spot in town. Last weekend we were feeling nostalgic and went for dinner at our old BBQ spot, $75.00 later and we left unsatisfied. Went to the market and picked up the ingredients and put it in the pot for this week. No more eating out and getting pulled pork! I did modify the recipe slightly; added 1/2 cup more broth and BBQ sauce, used a whole clove of fresh garlic and 1/4 cup more brown sugar ( gives it an extra tangy taste) also I cook it on low for 9-10 hours as another reviewer recommended. Comes out perfect every time and no matter how big of a pork shoulder I use there is NEVER left overs!!

Not bad, but a lot more work than what I usually do. I usually just slwo raost it in rootbeer then shred and sauce. The flavor of this recipe has more of a variety of tastes going on, but for us, we just prefer the simple sweet flavor. We serve it wiht coleslaw on top for a sandwich or make "piggy mac" macaroni topped with pulled pork. Thanks for the recipe, it was a nice change of pace.

This was the best pulled pork i have ever had, made it for a large gatherine and every person there complimented the recipe! I did make a rub on the meat before I put in the the crockpot, I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, and McCormicks hamburger seasoning. After it was done cooking and I shredded the meat, I felt it needed more bbq sauce, so I added another 1/2-3/4 of a cup, and let the meat sit in the sauce for another two hours before serving. I will use this recipe again and again, and several people asked for it! Thank you!

I followed the recipe except I put the slow cooker on low for 12 hours while I was at work, it was super easy to put together .But after 12 hours it smelled amazing and was easy to pull apart but the pork didn't seem to have absorbed any of the flavor leaving it tasking bland.

Very good recipe. I did eliminate the broth and oil as it already made a ton of liquid on it's own. I was short on time so I put the crock pot on high for 5 hours for a 7lb pork shoulder.  I pulled it apart, took off the fat, and let the meat sit in the juice for another hour or so.  Super tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is a winner! My tweaks: used white vinegar instead of apple cider, ran low on BBQ sauce so I added a couple dashes of ketchup, substituted a dollop of Better than Chicken bouillon for broth, and replaced  Yellow mustard  with Dijon (no veg. oil either). Mixed all ingredients and coated the pork shoulder (trimmed of fat). Braised in the crockpot set on low for 12 hrs, stirring  after 7 hrs (no need to shred as the meat easily fell apart).  Delicious and the sauce was not too runny.

I did not like the taste of the sauce at all. I found it had way too much vinegar. I scooped out the meat and onions and discarded the sauce, then added bottled BBQ sauce and some brown sugar to tone it down. I will not make this again.

I made it but only  did a teaspoon of both the thyme and the chili powder since I was making it for my 5 and 2 year old.  For me that was plenty of spice however, I still think even just a teaspoon of thyme was a bit much.  Next time I may even omit the thyme all together.  Otherwise , it was pretty good.

I followed the recipe exactly. The pork was tender but not really flavorful, even after shredding it and putting it back in the juice for awhile.  I had to add more flavor to the shredded pork, more barbecue sauce, brown sugar, and some hot sauce.

I did make it the day before I needed it and after I shredded it, I put it back into the juices and let it sit overnight. Then o drained 2/3 of the juices and added just a little BBQ sauce. Honestly, it was delicious on its own after sitting all night in the fridge. But I had already made my mom's BBQ sauce and so I added a 1/2 cup to it.  People said it was the best pulled pork they'd ever had!

The best pulled pork recipe I’ve ever made and I haven’t even tried it yet! I used a 3.5lb pork loin and sweet baby rays brown sugar and hickory bbq sauce and it’s coming along perfect. I put everything in the pot and put the diced onion on top then sprinkled the brown sugar and let it carmelize for the first 90 min then I flipped the pork over and spooned the juice on top and added more brown sugar. I tried a little bit of the juice when I did this and man oh man it was perfect! Ill be serving it on potato rolls that I’m going to butter up and brown on the stove top. I’ll have coleslaw in the side. I’ll definitely be making this again and again.l and again!!

Though the meat came out incredibly tender (I cooked on low for the first three hours, high for the next three, followed by the warm setting till served)  the taste just wasn’t what I was expecting. I’m giving it three stars, as personally it represents just an average score. If you enjoy a slightly more sweet and sour taste, this is your recipe. What it lacked for what I was aiming for was a hint of smokiness and a little more molasses flavor.  I used a half and half mix of bulls eye and sweet baby ray’s sauce and it still lacked.  Would I make it again? Yes - it was easy and the ingredients were everything I had at home. Is this something I would make to impress a guest? Unfortunately no, I may shop the market some more to find that right crock pot recipe. 

Last note: This recipe lacks salt. If you make without using rub, additional salt is needed.

Pretty good! I omitted the vegetable oil and the thyme but used all the other ingredients . My family really enjoyed this.  I used Sweet Baby Ray’s spicy BBQ sauce. Also I cooked on low for 10 hours and at the 3/4 point, dumped approximately half the liquid out. Will make again.

I loved how tender the roast was. I did a 6 lb bone-in roast for 7 hrs on high and it just fell apart. However the sauce was so gross smelling (very vinegary). I dipped my finger in to taste and it tasted so oily I just couldn't put the meat back in. So we just put the meat on the buns and topped with a store bought BBQ sauce. Disappointing.

This recipe was amazing, but I made a couple of changes to send it over the top.
1.  I did not put the oil in the slow cooker. Instead I heated up a skillet to medium high heat, and use the oil to sear each side of the roast for 2 to 3 minutes.  It carmelized the meat and added a depth of flavor and texture to the recipe. I think everyone should do this. 
2. I personally don't like excessively sweet BBQ, so I slightly reduced the brown sugar and I made sure to use a barbecue sauce that was not overly sweet.  It was still plenty sweet enough to be called barbecue. This is really a matter of personal taste. 

This morning I put this barbecue pork (with a little extra BBQ sauce) on crispy hash browns with melted cheddar - it was to DIE for.

So delicious! This amazingly moist, tender, and flavourful pulled pork will have your mouth watering for more. Some tweaks I made:

1) No thyme / no chicken stock
2) Add 5 drops of liquid smoke
3) The sauce will come out extremely soupy due to the water from the pork shoulder. Put the liquid in a pan and reduce it to almost half, then mix it with the shredded pork. Don't use cornstarch to thicken it as you will get a diluted flavour from all the water in the sauce.

It was okay. It didn't have enough flavor for my taste. Just my opinion.

My oldest son picked this recipe as his choice to cook.  After looking it over, and reading reviews, I did make a few small changes.  We seasoned the pork and seared it in a pan of hot oil until brown.  Then we put it in the slow cooker and followed the directions from there.  I have found that recipes don't call for seasoning the meat if they put it in a slow cooker.  But, this came at really tender and very good!

Easy to shred, but the flavor wasn't there. It was pretty bland and the bbq didn't really seep into the meat even though I slow cooked on slow for roughly 15 hours total.

I have this cooking in the slow cooker, now.  Just wondering why the recipe calls for BBQ sauce and then all the ingredients that go into BBQ sauce, too.  Why not just add ketchup and increase the vinegar, sugar, worcestershire, etc that go into BBQ?  I guess I cannot submit this without a rating, so I will randomly assign it a 4 and adjust the rating after it's done.

Made this for the super bowl and it came out great. I could only find an 8lb pork roast so I doubled the marinade. My main issue was the left over sauce was weak/dilute in flavor. I collected the juices after pulling the pork and put it in the freezer. When all the fat came to the surface I scooped it out. Then prior to the game I simmered it down to reduce the volume and then put the pork in. Delicious.

I made according to the recipe and was very pleased with the results.  The consistency of the sauce was perfect - I did not have to thicken.  My husband loved it.  The only change I will make is next time I will leave out the thyme as I found it to be a little overwhelming but other than that 5 stars!!!

Excellent!  After putting the oil and the pork in the slow cooker, I mixed the other ingredients (except onion & garlic) in a large measuring cup and stirred with a whisk making it easy to pour over the top.  This is my go to recipe for pulled pork!

I didn't toast the buns, instead, put a little bbq sauce inside the bun, a little cole slaw and a heaping of the pork on top of that. So good!

GREAT! Such rich flavor and so easy. Served it on southern-style biscuits with cheese and sliced spicy pickles (and a bit more of our fave BBQ sauce).  Our piece of meat was a bit smaller than called for, so we had a lot of sauce, but it's hard to complain about that!

I come from a family of BBQ experts so I never really tried to compete on their level.  But when I saw this recipe and the reviews, I thought I would give my husband a treat since pulled pork is his go-to when we eat out. Well it was fabulous.  I followed the recipe to a T, and it came out perfectly.  There was a lot of sauce when I removed the pork to pull it, but I just put it in a saucepan to reduce while I was pulling the pork and used just enough of it to give the correct consistency to the finished product.  The best way to adjust this recipe to your taste without making significant alterations is to use your favorite BBQ sauce.  I use half KC Masterpiece Original and half Jim Dandy's Habanero for a little kick.  After my husband declared himself obsessed, I made this for my "expert" family members.  Guess what?  I'm now an expert too!

Really good pulled pork. The only thing I will do differently next time is to cook it for longer. I feel like I should have cooked it for 8 to 10 hours because it didn't shred easily.  At least it was one of those recipes you can start before bed or before work in the morning and have something really yummy for dinner that night.

This is incredible. Usually I stray away from recipes and do my own thing, but I stuck to this one and it paid off.

The only thing I'd do different next time is maybe add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up, but it may not be necessary on a 10 hour cook.

Followed this recipe almost exactly, and my dad and I both had an awesome BBQ night. I followed others' reviews about dissolving 2 tbsp cornstarch in 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and adding to the broth after taking the meat out for shredding. Really thickened it up and made the sauce saucy and sticky. Also, doubled the garlic because... garlic. Next time, I'll add more heat (spice); I felt this recipe was sweeter than I prefer.

I never make meat.  That's my husband's realm.  Being the new year, I decided to try something easy to get my feet wet.  Everyone LOVED this!  Super easy to make.  I substituted Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, but otherwise made it exactly the same way.  Wonderful recipe!

I added salt and pepper to the pork roast, extra garlic.  Used brioche burger buns, and added homemade cabbage slaw.

I made three different pulled pork recipes for my family last summer and this one was the winner.  I used a homemade smoky mountain chipolte bbq sauce and ancho chili powder.

Family loved it!  I offered to serve it on buns, but they wanted it on fresh, lightly toasted flour tortillas every time.  A keeper!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is my family’s absolute favourite pulled pork!
There are just two things we do differently: add an entire bottle of bbq sauce (we use original sweet baby rays) instead of one cup, and mix about a tablespoon of cornstarch in with the shredded pork & sauce at the end to thicken it up a bit. With those two adjustments, it comes out perfectly at 6 hours every time, and it provides enough to feed us for a few days!
The toasted buns are a really nice touch. We also make homemade coleslaw and serve it on top of the pulled pork between the buns. Sooooo good!

Fantastic love the the way you put it all in the slow cooker and let it cook. Easy to prepare and tastes so yummy. I didn’t put as much chilli powder in it coz we don’t like it hot. Have shared recipe with other too

I made the recipe as written.  It was OK.  a little bland and for some reason the meat was not as tender as I expected.  Next time I would use the same recipe but add more spices, vinegar and mustard.

I cooked in low for 10 hours. Very tender! Shredded around hour 8.5   Based on other reviews I added some about 8 drops liquid smoke and 1 Tbs cinnamon. I think the cinnamon really helped up the flavor.

Made this today, it turned out perfect! I will say that it makes a bit more than 8 servings for anyone counting calories, you can easily half a "serving size" of this and still come out with a nice size sandwich. I couldn't find a 4 lb shoulder pork cut in the stores near me, but even with my 3.4 lb roast though I still had plenty to go around.

This does not taste like any pulled pork I have ever had.... The sauce isn’t good at all, I used Diana gourmet bbq sauce which I love,hence why I figured it would be good.... My family won’t eat it. Too bad to waste the ingredients on this!

I only had a 2 lb pork loin roast so I halved the recipe. Added the liquid smoke and substituted dry mustard as the other reviewers recommended. Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. I put the garlic and onion in the bottom of my slow cooker, rubbed the roast with the dry ingredients and let it rest for an hour. Added the wet ingredients and let it cook on low for 9 hours overnight. We do not eat a lot of pork around here,  but this was delicious! Will make again, and will be a go-to for parties.

Turned out amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and cooked it on high for 5-6 hours. It pulled apart easily and had great flavour. Be sure to remove extra fat from the outside of the roast before cooking - I missed some and had to remove it as I was pulling it at the end, much more time consuming.

I made this recipe for my sons birthday party, but used chicken breast instead. The pulled chicken was used as part of a nacho bar and was a HUGE hit. I'd recommend freezing some for a later date- it's delicious!

It was perfect. I didn’t even have to dirty another cutting board to shred it I just shredded it in the slow cooker. I was also able to skim some of the fat at the top layer and later on add a little bit more of my favorite barbecue sauce. I did use five big cloves of garlic but the recipe is excellent. Will make again !!

Really tasty. Left out the thyme and chicken broth and used 4 cloves of garlic. Used a smokey brand of BBQ sauce (Bullseye). Added some smoked paprika and a touch of cinnamon. Will definitely make again!

I was a little worried as this was my first time making pulled pork.  I was also using a 14 lb pork shoulder butt for a large group.  I had to split the roast into 2 slow cookers. Doubling the other ingredients was more than enough.  Based on reviews I skipped the thyme.  Since I was serving it for a football party I started it the day before.  I cooked it, pulled it, separated the fat from the broth mixture and then refrigerated the pork overnight in the liquid.  The next day I reheated the pork for about 2 hours on high using only a cup or two of new chicken broth and BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Rays Hickory and Brown Sugar was awesome).  I was concerned it would be dry but it wasn’t.  It turned out great!

Do not add the barbecue sauce to the crock pot for cooking.  strain the cooking juices through  a sieve to a saucepan and simmer on high for one cup. Add the reduced braising juices back to the pulled pork, and then add your barbecue sauce to your taste to the pork you will use for sandwiches. This way, you can use the basic pulled pork recipe for tacos or any other recipe without having the barbecue sauce in it.

This is amazing and the meat just falls apart.  I did ladle off the fat at the end. No other modifications. Delicious and super easy

I LOVE this recipe! I’m making it for the second time today. I thought everything was absolutely perfect, except I did add more barbecue sauce and halved the pepper. It was still delicious the first time even though it made my nose run into it! If you love hot sauce and hot stuff, leave the pepper be! If you aren’t so fond, just cut some out. You can always add more later!

I followed step by step and it was very tasty. The juice is not thick after cooking so I would suggest a slotted spoon and having the meet on a hard roll. We had soft buns but the juice dis disk through the bread. Some good eating no matter what. Get down and enjoy it!

I used pork tenderloin instead of pork shoulder and it was still perfect. Great recipe, super easy. Even my two toddlers loved it! It makes a huge batch though, so be ready to freeze some unless you're cooking for a huge crowd.

I don't love the taste of meat (including pork) so like my pulled pork saucy. This was a great recipe (especially if you like the sauce taste as much or more than the pork taste)! Fairly easy to make: I used a pork butt instead of shoulder and didn't use any oil. After shredding the meat, I drained some of the sauce (it was pretty liquidy) and added some extra bbq sauce to thicken it a bit. Worked great. Ate it with some kohl rabi and apple coleslaw (which paired really well) and topped with jalapeno havarti.

Great recipe!  Only complaint is that it was a little soggy, but my toddler devoured it so I'm not complaining!  I served it platter style (not on a bun) with mac and cheese, green beans, and side salad.

Followed the recipe and loved how easy it was to shred the pork. My family and I  did not like the thyme  so will skip that next time I make it. Added some barbecue sauce when I reheated it and put it on  slider buns.

I slow cooked it for 8 hours one day to use later in the week. I did not add chicken broth, and it wasn't necessary because there was a lot of liquid.

Overall this was a great recipe, I've made it a few times.  I did find this recipe way too sweet (and I have a sweet tooth)!
I made some revisions: I use avocado oil instead of veg. oil; maple syrup instead of brown sugar (but less then 1/4 cup).  When I didn't have chicken broth I just added water.  I also added a bit of bourbon & a few squirts of ketchup; bay leaves and all spice balls.

I love this recipe. I make it exactly as listed and for the brand of barbecue (since this will effect your flavor a lot) I use Stubbs: Sticky Sweet.  Its fantastic. I find it a little runny after the cooking so I add a little more after its done to my liking. The other thing I change is I do a TEASPOON of the Chili Powder instead of a whole tablespoon because I find it cuts too hard on the other flavors when I do a whole tablespoon but thats just my preference, otherwise I'd rate this a 4.5 just because of the (in my opinion) excessive chili powder. Since thats not an option, I put four stars because I really really like this, except for the amount of chili powder and the fact I add extra bbq at the end I dont feel its fair to rate it five stars because I like it with my changes but I feel as a base this is a great recipe.

Very disappointed. Yes, the meat fell apart but the taste was very bland.  Good thing I made it a day ahead of when I needed it.  I'll have tomorrow to doctor it up.

This was my first time using a slow cooker. This was so easy!! I had a 4.0 pound pork shoulder. Prep time was 15 min, how easy was that? Set my cooker for 5 hours and the meat was perfect. I did however taste it and it needed some cayenne, so I added 3/4T to the pot, put the meat back in on warm, andv2 hours later it was great. I'll  do this one again. 
How did i not realize how easy a slow cooker was?

This was a great recipe. I was in a crunch for time so I made it in my electric pressure cooker instead of the slow cooker. I did it for an hour on my steak and meat setting. I removed the pork and shredded it. I put the pork back into the pressure cooker and cooked it for another 30 minutes on my steak and meat setting. Thank you so much for this recipe.

When it's too hot to fire up the smoker this recipe makes a respectable  pulled pork for sandwiches!  I made recipe exactly as shown except I shredded the pork during the last hour and did not add the sauce/juice back to the pot. I prefer a drier sandwich with lots of coleslaw. I did half the  recipe and  used my 1.5 qt slow cooker with a small pork loin.

It was pretty good. At first i found the flavor a little lacking so i added some extra mustard and brown sugar. As well as some ketchup and more barbeque sauce, and handfuls of cheese to try to thicken up the sauce. I was unseccesful lol. Next time i may make a rue to help.

Delicious! Made my 16-year old son very happy. I did skip the thyme (didn't have any) and chili powder (don't like it).

I made this exactly how the recipe show and OMG it was so good!!  I will keep this to make again for sure. I slow cooked it almost 6 hours on high in my pressure cooker, shredded it, then pressure cooked about 12 minutes to really get the flavors through it all.  Awesome flavor!! thanks for sharing with us :)

Tender, juicy, flavourful...made it with 2 adjustments others recommended: leave out chicken stock but use a whole bottle of bbq sauce. Glad I did or it would have been way too liquidy.
There was a flavour I didn't like and I think it might have been the apple cider vinegar which came through VERY strongly.
(I messed up the cooking time...couldn't figure out why it was so tough at the 6 hour mark...just see now the recipe said to cook it on high. So, it took my roast 9 hours to tenderize on low and I had to stay up until 3:30 in the morning. My mistake, don't make it yours. I'll make it again without the apple cider vinegar.

I made this for tonight’s dinner and everyone loved it. I thought there was too much onion but they all cooked down. The house smelled amazing. My daughter does not normally like pulled pork and she made 2 sliders. My roast was bone in and a little on the fatty side. I picked out the fat when I was pulling it (the dog was happy to eat that). I will definitely make it again. The only change was to use grainy pub mustard instead of regular yellow mustard because I didn’t have any.

I made no changes with this recipe and the sauce was waterery and not very tasty at all!  I ended up making a new sauce and adding it to the cooked meat!  I will not be making this again...total let down for the amount of stars it received! I would not recommend it to anybody!!!

Excellent recipe, just the right mix of tangy and spice. I did not add any oil and I used a boneless pork loin. Cooked in my crock pot on low overnight, then shredded the meat and returned it to the sauce. The buttered buns made it really special. No question will make it again!

Really good recipe, however you need to fix the discrepancy between what the video says and what the typed up recipe says regarding how long to cook this on the low setting. The video says *up to* 8 hours on low, whereas the recipe states 10-12 hours on low.  Just FYI anyone who is reading, I did it on low for 10 hours.

It was very good easy to make. I cooked it on slow for 10 hours. I didn't want it to get dry. I wish I would of pulled off the fat before I shredded it.  Dumb part on me. Next time I will do that.

One of the easiest recipes I’ve ever made. Since I was limited on time, I put it in my instant pot for 90 minutes and it fell apart. Everyone at my party talked about how good it was. I also put a dry pulled pork rub on the meat beforehand.

This was my first time making pulled pork. It was good, I didn’t have dried thyme and used ground thyme. I can’t remeber how much I used but it was way too much. The next time I make this I want to add strips of bell pepper to it. Some how I want to add more acid to it too, but I don’t know how.

Very good. The magic was in the BBQ sauce I made from Allrecipes (Irene's).  I used the high power x 6 hours. Next time I will try the low power for longer.

This recipe is awesome! I have made this twice in two weeks now because pork shoulder has been on sale! The only sub I did was add really spicy bbq sauce because we like spicy food and then subbed a shallot for the onion because I didn't have any onions. Great recipe, super easy to make, and seriously everyone loves it! Thank you for this!

I liked this recipe but some things you need to know. Oil is not ever needed in slow cookers. I never use it. The second thing is that this recipe has too much vinegar. I use about half of what is listed. I also usually substitute chipotle powder for the chili powder (but not as much) to get some heat.

No worcestershire or brown sugar so I used a dollop of Alaga syrup for flavor. Cooked it on low for about 11 hours. Shredded easily.

This is one of my favorite recipes!  I made this last month and I’m entertaining this evening and thought, perfect and can mix this up in the morning and clean all day. It is delicious. I season brown my meat before putting it in the crockpot because I think it adds a little something, but it’s so tasty!  I skip the onion because I have seasoning in my mix. I love this recipe. The pork is so tender and the sauce is fabulous :) id recommend this to anyone.

I used red wine vinegar because the apple cider vinegar had expired and I also used onion powder because of time and it turned out great! My only critique is the the BBQ sauce was sweet and made the pork a bit on the sweet side so I plan to use a more smokey/hickory flavored BBQ sauce the next time I make this. Otherwise it seems like there is plenty of room to adjust the flavors to anyone's liking. This is easily one of my favorite slow cooker recipes.

I made this today and my family loved it. The only change I made was to omit the thyme. We're just not a fan. This is definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing!

I liked the flavors in this so much! However, I did not like the method. Concerning the fat, there is a much easier way to do this. I used a pork loin and cooked it in Beef Broth and Apple Cider Vinegar. I did this on high for 6 hours. When my timer beeped I took out the loins and drained the broth. This took out much of the fat in itself. I put the pork loin back in and then added the flavors that were in the recipe. I doubled them because of the size of my loin. I put the slow cooker on low (warm would work just as well) and kept it there until I was ready to serve. None of the flavors were wasted, as when I was ready I could shred the meat in the slow cooker and mix it all in the sauce which became a little thicker. Everything incorporated very nicely and my family loved it! (My choice of BBQ is Sweet Baby Rays Original as well)

It was excellent!  I did simmer down the liquid at the end and served extra barbecue sauce on the side. Oh, and I made it in my Instant Pot and cooked it for an hour.  I sauteed the pork in the Instant Pot at the beginning - not sure if it mattered.  Yum!

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times now, and varied the recipe after the 3rd cook! I decided to review after this cook because it was just so #$%^&* good! Rubbed the seasoning, "{Paprika, Cayenne, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Cumin, Ginger, Salt, Pepper, and Brown Sugar, ea  tbsp}" onto the butt and slow cooked for 8.5 hrs and let rest for 2 hrs, the Pork Shoulder Butt was 9.2 Ibs. no liquid added, that meant no vinegar, no broth and no mustard, except  1 tbsp of soy sauce, 1 tbsp of worcestershire sauce and 2 tbsp of Wrights Hickory Smoke the juice from the butt rendered as it cooked and shredded after a total of 12 hrs however again, only cooked 8.5 hrs at 225f and a total rest time of 4 hrs, 2 in oven turned off and 2 sitting out of oven and it shred like absolutely nothing ......... Awesome Basic Recipe to explore as you wish! The recipe was cooked in a Lodge 9 quart Dutch cast iron Oven.

Worked out perfectly. I used the low and slow method and added a couple little extras which were; about a tbls hoisin sauce, about a tsp of mesquite seasoning. And for the bbq sauce I used Sweet Baby Ray’s hickory brown sugar sauce. It was so tender, Smokey and wonderful for an autumn bbq. I also went for a slightly bigger piece of meat.

This was easy and delicious, family loved it. Made exactly as the recipe called for and there is nothing to change , I didn’t add the chicken broth as other reviewers recommended and the sauce turned out perfect, enough for the 7 lbs bone in pork shoulder.  As other reviewers recommended, I did leave the sauce in the fridge which made removing the layer of grease so easy. It’s a keeper.

So delicious!! Idk what other people are talking about when they didn’t like the flavor..it’s bbq and pulled pork!! What’s better tasing than that? I did add a 1/2 tbsp of cumin and parika to mine a sprinkle of an “Arizona” seasoning. I also addeed 4 strips of bacon cut in to pieces and used a 3-4 lb cut of pork tenderloin and it made plenty for two. Sprinkle some cheese and shredded some cabbage and heat up som bbq beans. Every bit my boyfriend took he said “mmmmm”

I omitted the thyme, but followed all of the other instructions to the letter. At the end there was quite a bit of fat/oil on the surface, so I skimmed a lot of that off to keep the pork from being too oily. It turned out very good, and I served it on toasted buns with coleslaw, chips, salad, and pickles. Delicious for a summer lunch/dinner!

This was really good. I didn't add the oil or chicken broth and it turned out just fine. I cubed the pork before putting it in the slow cooker. This made it really easy to shred the pork at the end. I'll definitely make this again.

Love the apple cider vinegar, gives it a nice tang. I made the spices into more of a rub. Delicious!

I made this in a hurry in the AM. All ingredients are things you have in the pantry or fridge. My husband and 2 teenage sons had emptied the crockpot by the time I got home from work. I take that as 5 stars!!!

It was a good flavour, but me boyfriend is the pulled pork aficionado and he said that it was good but not amazing. It would be better if the sauce was thicker and had a bit more flavour so we're going to play with the base BBQ sauce and try a thicker/more flavourful one.

This recipe smelled awesome while I was cooking. When finished, I dipped the liquid out of the slow cooker and then shredded the pork inside the cooker. I then added back liquid as I shredded to get the right amount of liquid. I was afraid it would be too liquidy if I used all the juice. The first thing I noticed when I tasted was that it needed some salt. I rechecked the recipe to be sure I hadn’t left it out. I would think it could use about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt stirred in at the beginning. I also thought it needed a little more kick so I added about a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne and stirred in. All said, great recipe and will definitely be doing it again,

We really like this recipe. It's not super unhealthy and sweet like a lot of the recipes for pulled pork. it was easy to make. It had simple ingredients. I didn't have to run out to the store and buy ingredients. We are planning to make it again tomorrow  which is what reminded me I needed to write a review. Because the recipe calls for 1 cup of already made BBQ sauce I think that you get to impact the flavor of the sauce. You can pick a bold and spicy BBQ sauce or you could pick a mild garlic BBQ sauce. I like having this choice. Thanks for the recipe. I recommend it. Also, I am giving it 5 stars because there is nothing I would change about it.  it is simple and easy to make. Clean up is easy. Food tastes awesome.

I made this tonight for a family get together and it was a huge hit!!! I used a 6lb pork butt roast  and cooked on low for 13 hours. I did not use oil, thyme, or broth. I added an extra tbsp of chili powder, doubled the brown sugar, used 10 cloves of garlic, & doubled the bbq sauce. I have tried a lot of slow cooker pulled pork recipes and this is by far my new favorite. I paired it with my cilantro lime coleslaw. The whole family was asking when I'm going to make this again!!!

I’ve made this many times and my family loves it. I’ve even made for work pot lucks, it’s always  a winner. The only thing I’ve done was omitt the thyme (I don’t like it) and added in less sugar. Great receipe

Wasn't bad..usually make it with root beer but wanted to try something different this time. I would use this recipe again, but I'd halve the amount of vinegar to 1/4 cup. I substituted 1/2 cup of salsa for the onion to give it a bit of a kick.

This was terrific. I followed the recipe but used about 2/3 of the meat as that’s what I had. Great flavor! We had it first just for sandwiches and then as leftovers on nachos !

Way too watery and bland once done.  Once the meat was tender, I had to scoop out all of the liquid (A LOT) and then added a ton of BBQ sauce, letting it cook in that for another hour to soak in the flavor.

Reminded me to much of cafeteria food.    Had a bit to much vinegar for my liking.    Ended up tossing most of it.   I usually cook pork on the BGE.    So using a crockpot/slow cooker was definitely a step backwards for me.

Wasn't a fan of the chicken broth in this, was a bit of a conflicting flavour.  

Good news...  made a ton of food which in turn made for using the pork in other recipes very easy.

Best pulled pork recipe I've ever came across. I try and make it at least once a week. I found its best with Bull's Eye Original sauce. If you want extra flavor pour a splash or 2 of beer.

Woweeee! This  was the best pulled pork! The sauce was nice but I drained some of it and put new bbq sauce on it. It was so moist and flavorful. You gotta make this one! Kick the soda can and add some thyme! :)

This is a great, no-nonsense easy and super tasty recipe! I have officially stopped looking for a slow-cooker pulled pork recipe after making this for our gang!

Made it according to the recipe with the exception of cooking it for longer based on so many of the review suggesedtions. In the cooker at 9am on low, shredded at 5pm and back in sauce and ready for the New Years Eve party at 8pm. Just incredible!

I followed the recipe nearly exactly. The only thing I did was put in a quarter cup less broth because I read that other said it was runny. It was still all liquid. My entire family of nine hated it. Every one said it tasted like vinegar but had no flavor, which they didn't understand but hated. We will never again make this.

Identical to a favourite recipe passed to me by a friend. Used pork loins (what I had on hand) and turned out beautifully. Shredded the pork and returned meat to soak in the juices for the last 30 minutes - nice moist result! Loved the tangy taste of the apple cider vinegar (yet another use for that kitchen essential).

This recipe was too sweet for me but it is easily adapted using the same ingredients! I cut the sugar in half and upped the vinegar and mustard. I like more tangy BBQ.  I also added some fire  roasted tomatoes for an underlying flavor. Great recipe you can easily fine tune to your own taste!

Followed the recipe to a tee! All the members of my family could not stomach it. The smell of vinegar filled our house, we are not much for vinegary products and this one tops the list. I wouldn’t add the apple cider vinegar unless that’s something your family loves!!

I cooked the roast overnight on low, about 13 hours. Then I removed the roast from the liquid and let it cool, just breaking it into junks (not shredding). I put the liquid in a bowl in the fridge to be able to skim the fat. Letting the roast sit and cooling the liquid was about 2 hours. Probably didn't need to be that long but it worked perfectly. Then the liquid and roast went back into the slow cooker on low for another 4 hours. Wonderful. By the time it was done, the meat was shredded. I followed the recipe exactly for a 7-1/2 lb. pork roast.

So i made this two different ways, and both times the taste left me wanting something...more. There is no boom, or kick, or even a distinct taste. Its just pork, and sweet pork at that. I agree with other reviews when they said thy would omit the sugar, and put more vinegar next time. I think if you like sweet pulled pork, its a 3 star recipe. 
P.S. DO NOT USE CINNAMON, someone said to use a teaspoon. Not a good suggestion at all, i thought it would turn out great the first time, the worst deicsion ever

I read several of the reviews from others and followed some of their suggestions.  Definitely don't need the oil or the chicken broth!  Cooked it on low for 12 hrs, was perfect for overnight.  Added the cinnamon and 8 or 10 drops of liquid smoke.  Very nice deep flavor.  Also strained the liquid and added it back to the shredded pork.  Made this on Friday night to be served on Sunday for Christmas Eve.  Perfect, easy, crowd pleaser!

Love this recipe and make it all the time. I do not add chicken broth or oil because the pork shoulder is always juicy/fatty enough. I also substitute maple syrup for brown sugar for a delicious Canadian twist on American classic.

My family loved it! Easy to make and turned out beautifully. I didn't butter the buns, but other than that, I made it just as written. I served bbq sauce on the side (used Stubb's), in case people wanted extra. Also served w/ spicy pickles and mustard.

No Changes. Changing makes the recipe no longer the original. Is the only pulled Pork recipe I ever use. Will not even research another again. This is it. Many all good compliments. Nothing more to be said.

Best of all pulled pork recipes I’ve tried. The sauce has tremendous flavor and is worth the prep time. I added a little liquid smoke to deepen the flavor. Also, I skimmed about a cup of fat off after I removed the pork for shredding, then put the pork back. Serve with cole slaw, pickles, and your other favorite sides.

Amazing!  Loved this recipe as a sandwich!  Made as written, but skipped the thyme because I'm not a fan and used minced onion because I didn't have an actual onion.

I forgot to thaw my pork butt in time to cook it on the Kamado over the weekend. Pressed for time, I decided to try it in the crockpot on Monday.  I did not have high expectations. This recipe was okay, but generally bland. Some salt and BBQ sauce helped. Personally, I will pass on this one in the future.

Overall good and good flavor to the pork. A bit too much liquid for my liking so I would omit the chicken stock next time. I would also cut down on the onion - I think it only needed 1 medium sized. I used a 5 lb loin so I cooked it for about 6.5 hours. After if was shredded, I threw it in a pan with another two cups of BBQ sauce and let it incorporate. We like ours saucy and not so "wet".  I will make it again with these modifications.

This recipe was extremely simple but packed with flavor. It definitely leaves plenty of liquid behind even after you shred the pork and add it back to the crock pot. I stuck pretty close to the recipe; the only addition I made was some fresh cut grape tomatoes (they were lying around so why not). They definitely added another flavor depth but not necessary if you don't have the lying around. This is restaurant quality pulled pork, my boyfriend couldn't get enough!

The Apple cider vinegar didn’t give it as good of a flavor as I was expecting but the meat was extremely tender. I would make it again but with modifications.

Good as written.  Extremely easy.  On recommendations from others, did not use vegetable oil. Only other changes I made were to increase chili powder to 2T and to mix all ingredients together in a bowl, then spoon some in bottom of crock pot before adding roast. Poured remainder over roast and cooked on high for 3 hours, then 2 on low. Shredded meat, put back in crock pot with sauce for another hour.  Sauce was very thin so thickened with 2T cornstarch dissolved in 3T chicken broth. Toasted rolls and slices of Provolone cheese made a perfect sandwich.  My picky son rated it "delicious".

I made the recipe x1.5, keeping all the ingredients in the right proportions. Sauce was meh, it needed more BBQ flavor. I think next time I'll use the other popular pulled pork recipe and just go with BBQ sauce and stock to make it. This was a disappointment.

Made this pulled pork recipe today. It was delish! The only change I made was to omit the thyme. Some in the family like it saucier than others, so once it was removed from the crockpot and pulled a portion was set aside to add additional BBQ sauce. Our favourite is cattle boyz. Toasted our buns, added some coleslaw and then the pulled pork - yum!  A hit with everyone. Will definitely make it again. Thanks.

I used sweet baby ray BBQ sauce.    For serving I had some homemade Cajun candy jalapeño and coleslaw.   Put all on the sandwich.    Grandkids went back for more.  Actually everyone did.

A real winner!  I didn't have all the right ingredients so I made some substitutions and it still turned out great.  

I didn't have apple cider vinegar and used red wine vinegar instead.  I didn't have chicken stock, so just added salt to hot water.

I'm sure it would have been even better with the correct ingredients, but this is one of those meals you can fudge and will still come out great.

Best I've had so far. I did a few changes though. I used the mustard to rub the roast as a base for a dry rub. I then seared the roast on all sides before I put it in the slow cooker. I also mixed all the ingredients in a separate bowl before adding to the roast. When I removed the roast from the slow cooker  to shred, I also  strained the juice into  my gravy fat separator. After I remove the fat, I then reduced the juice by 25% before I returned it to the slow cooker with the onions that I had previously strained. I then returned the pulled pork to the slow cooker and held the temp until serving.

I AM MAKING IT NOW!  It just falls apart when its done.  We add a little sauce on our buns and it is the best.  First time I used water instead of broth.  2nd time I cut the water altogether, it is plenty juicy, being pork.  this time I really tweaked it with various other spices.  can't wait!

This is delicious!  Cooked a 5 lb pork shoulder with the bone in, and pretty much made as written, with adjustments for the increase in pork.  Pulled the pork after about 5 1/2 hours, then cooked on low for another hour.  Did add some cornstarch to thicken up the sauce a bit, but that's just a personal preference.

Absolutely amazing recipe! I've done it twice and it always comes out great. I cooked it in a covered cast-iron pot at 325°F for 4-5 hours and the pork always comes out tender. Defiantly going to be making it again!

Make sure to start early--it's best when cooked long and slow. I added more cinnamon as someone suggested and skipped the soup. Still needed to drain excess liquid--but keep the onion "mush" which is full of flavor!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was delicious! I've never had tangy, savory, pulled pork like this before. It was delicious, a HUGE hit with my husband and young kids. He was eating it out of the bowl! We also tried the buttered toasted rolls and they made quite a difference too. I'll never serve bbq the same again. I've made it twice so far and I will probably start making this for family gatherings and more often for dinner. I omitted the thyme the second time around simply because I didn't have any and it was still amazing.

Yummy!!!!  Turned out perfect. Part way through the meal my dad (79 years old) went to the kitchen and got a little storage container to make sure there would be some left for his lunch the next day.  And it's a good thing he did, because there wasn't anything left.

Made this according to recipes and it turned out ok. Definitely  not a show stopper. Lacked the wawoom flavour I was hoping for and ended up saving dinner by adding a lot of BBQ sauce.

I made recipe as written and loved the result. After pulling the pork and putting it back in the juices it sat on warm for some time which I think enhanced the result.

My roast was only 2 pounds so I adjusted the ingredients and cooking time accordingly. I omitted thyme because I didn't have it. Other then that, I followed the directions and it turned out great.

Turned out excellent and no reason to look for another recipe. About 13-14 hours.  Pulled the meat apart after 6- hours then let it cook Drained a little of the fat and let it cook with the lid open for another 7.   As others suggested never added any oil.

FABULOUS!  Followed directions as listed until the end.  After shredding the meat and separating  the fat from the sauce,  I put the meat back in the slow cooker with the sauce and cooked for 30 min on low.  I then took it from the slow cooker and put it all in a large frying pan and cooked the liquid down while at the same time crusting up some of the meat.

I assembled the ingredients, dumped everything on top of the pork, and turned  the crock pot on.  My husband trimmed it up and pulled it apart. And we ate sumptuously!
Easy & delicious.

This is an amazing recipe!!  I used a 3.4 lb roast and I omitted the vegetable oil - it would have turned out much to greasy had I added the oil.  It was a hit!  My entire family loved it and it was so easy!!  I will definitely make this again!!!

It was a big hit in my family! I used 3 pounds of pork and cooked for 6 hours in slow cooker (high), but added another 3 minutes (high pressure) in the last minutes.
As other people said, there was quite a lot of juice. I took away about a half oil with a big spoon. 
I recommend this recipe to everyone! It took me only a couple of minutes to prepare. Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe. By busy mom with three kids. ;-)

I've made this several times and it's my go-to for pulled pork. I've found the amount of chili powder to be too spicy for our taste,miso I tend to half it. I also add about 1 tsp of liquid smoke.

I made 2 batches of this (8 lbs total).  In the first one I pretty much followed the recipe, but added a tsp of liquid smoke and omitted the oil.  It tasted ok, but I felt it was missing something.  I took a small amount  and mixed in my favorite BBQ sauce and it seemed to solve the problem, but IMO was still, just ok.  The next 4 lbs I prepared, I added a tablespoon of salt, 1 tsp liquid smoke (still omitted the oil) & wow, what a difference!  SALT!  Another reviewer also mentioned this and I too was surprised with all the rave reviews no one else has mentioned a lack of salt, and I'm not heavy handed on the salt, but it definitely needed additional flavor. For my party, I combined the two batches and had BBQ sauce on the side so people could top their sandwiches off if they liked.   At the end of the night there was only about a cup of the pulled pork  remaining.  I'd say overall it was a success, but I'd recommend adding salt - 1 tablespoon for 4 lbs of pork.

I thought this was excellent!  I made it with a 7 pound roast and adjusted ingrediants accordingly.  I did not include the chicken broth either and there was plenty of juice.  Delicious!  The whole family loves it!  Thank you for sharing!

Not only is this the worst pulled pork recipe I've ever tried it's the worst recipe I've ever used from this site. I cannot believe how many people liked this. I was a little leery when I first read it because it called for no salt and spice rub on the pig. And the amount of onion looked ridiculous. Sure enough, the pork turned out watery and flavorless. This is a swing and a miss.

Made it pretty much as recipe suggested but added more garlic and cayenne pepper/ crushed red pepper because the more spice the better. And again rough cut the onion because it will part of the sauce once it cooks for that long. If I'd had some liquid smoke I would've added it.  I also used pork butt because that's all I could find. I put the fatty side up to cook, and when meat was fully cooked I took it out and cut the fat off. Shredded meat and through back in the sauce. Definitely make some creamy slaw to go with it. Overall this was very very good.

Followed the recipe and we loved it, meat just fell apart like a good pulled pork should, also very tasty, had it on night with tiger bread and as there was plenty left had it again but this time with nachos. Highly recommend the recipe.

It was delicious.I cooked it on a Saturday and my whole family raved on how good it tasted.I refrigerated the left-overs and on Sunday after church decided to make bbq nachos.I topped tortilla chips with pork,tomatoes and cheese and heated in oven until cheese melted then topped it with my left-over cold coleslaw.It was even better this way

i left out the chicken stock as many suggested but since i use the "better than bouillon" paste instead of liquid i mixed some paste into the cider vinegar. Otherwise I followed the instructions and reduced the sauce down while I was shredding the pork, adjusted for seasoning with a spoonful more brown sugar, some salt, an a splash of vinegar and god was this good! Fed five big eaters in my house with leftovers. They're telling me it's the best pulled pork they've ever had!

Was so easy to make and the pork was tender and pulled apart easily.  First time making homemade pulled pork and it worked to perfection. Reduced the sauce on the stove before adding it to the sandwich. I will try a different BBQ sauce next time.

I'm diabetic with several other dietary restrictions so I made this without the brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and used gluten free buns.  It was delicious!  It's always exciting to find recipes that I can adjust to my needs, that still turn out well.

I followed the advice on some of the reviews and left out the vegetable oil and chicken broth. Good decision. My family liked the flavour and the pork was very tender. I would choose a better cut of pork as we found it a little fatty. But that's just our preference.  Overall very good.

I have always madenpulled pork with either Sweet Baby Rays or a combination of just a few seasonings. I decided to try this and what a great idea!  This pork is amazing!!! It deserves 10 stars at the very least. The only changes I made were , spicy mustard and white sugar just because I was out of the others. Best pulled pork I've had

I've tried several slow cooker recipes for pulled pork.  I did substitute brown spicy mustard for the yellow.  It's personal preference.  I didn't change anything else.  This is the best one I've come across.  Don't look any further.

This would be great if you omitted the Thyme!  I feel it was an over-powering flavor and it ruined it!
I will definitely make this again but not put any Thyme in.
(And I agree with others.....did not use the oil----not needed)

I followed the directions without any adjustments but the sauce was too watery. The meat was fine but the sauce had a weak favor.

Not sure what happened, I followed the recipe and in the end when I pull out the meat, it didn't retain ANY of the flavor from the juices. Then when we poured the juices on top, it seemed like it needed some salt or something? Not making this again. I cooked it for about 7 hours and it was still a bit dry, but fully cooked.

I made it last night.  It is great but I would only use the Regular Barbeque sauce from the brand recommended.  I used the sweet and spicy and it was too much with the apple cider vinegar and brown sugar.  It smelled and tasted amazing.

I used no chicken broth, 2 heaping tablespoons of brown sugar and omitted the thyme. I also added some smoked paprika.  It's still on the sweet side which I would imagine depends on which BBQ sauce you used. It's very good.

I made the recipe as written, using Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce.  There's a little something missing in flavor, but I'm not sure what.  I did not butter or toast the buns.  I have half the recipe in the freezer for a pre-prepared meal.  When we have that, I'll try buttering and toasting the buns.  I can see where that might add to the recipe.  I'll also try adding some dry mustard to see if that takes care of the "something missing."  Thanks for the recipe!

this was wonderful, everyone loved it. i was hesitant about the mustard because its not something we eat very often but i gave it a go, was really mild flavour by the end of the cook. didn't add the chilli and reduced the sugar and also added salt.  paired it with home made brioche buns and homemade coleslaw.  will definitely make again

So tasty and simple. Made sure you use your mixer to 'pull' the pork.

Pretty good, but sauce a bit more watery than I anticipated and very sweet.  Had with cornbread instead of buns, perfect for soaking up the sauce.  Will try again with different bbq sauces.

Very good flavor, and will most certainly add this recipe to my rotation, but if I wouldn't have poured off the sauce and reduced it on the stove top by about half before adding it back in with the pork, I would have had to rate this much lower.  It's an easy enough extra step  and definitely worth it.

Followed recipe exactly. My husband usually smokes pork for the family and it is an all day thing. It was so nice to put this together and have the day free. It was very good and I will definitely make it again. Thanks!

This is a simple recipe that yields flavorful results. Instead of chicken broth, I tried apple cider to mirror the apple flavor in the apple cider vinegar. It worked. Also, I wanted a stronger garlic punch, so I used garlic powder. I did use the raw onion, however.  After it had properly cooked, I removed the braising liquid to a small stockpot and, after de-fatting it, boiled that liquid down to a perfect sauce which I poured on the meat to infuse it with the sauce. A winner, pure and simple!

I omitted the oil, as I did not see the need for it (the pork roast has it's own fat).  I used dark brown sugar instead of light brown sugar and spicy brown mustard instead of yellow mustard, as that is what I had on-hand.  I tweaked the recipe to suit our preference for a more bolder and spicier flavor by doubling-up on the sugar and mustard - and added 1/2 cup extra BBQ sauce.  Also, I added about 1.5 tsp sea salt.  This was a big hit with my family and I am adding it to our monthly dinner rotation.

First time reviewer. I like it a lot and will make this again for sure. The flavor was outstanding. The one difference I guess was the chili powder, I bought hot by mistake so didn't use the entire amount called for, but the dish wasn't hot at all. Thanks for posting. I used sweet baby ray BBQ sauce....

This is a wonderful recipe exactly as written!!!   And to the person who said it was too sweet and not smoky enough, you probably used a BBQ not to your liking.  1/4 cup brown sugar wouldn't make it too sweet but using a honey or brown sugar BBQ would add to that.  I suggest you use a vinegar based sauce such as the new Heinz Carolina Vinegar style (I almost cringe saying that because I like "mom and pop" type BBQ sauces and not big brand names but the stuff is good!)    It has a bit of a smoky taste too but definitely not sweet at all.  You could also add a bit of liquid smoke as you suggested.

Delicious! Didn't use oil or chicken broth.  Pretty thick. Use a bit of broth if you want it a bit saucier.

I have made this several times and it is good, but in my opinion the sauce is a little lacking.  I need to tinker with it to see what to do, perhaps reducing the juices after pulling or something, but it is missing SOMETHING.  It might be just that I am trying to imitate pulled pork that has been cooked on a smoker and then pulled and sauced, so there is going to be no approaching the standard and I just need to reset my expectations.  It is still good and my whole family enjoys it and there is tons for leftovers that freeze and reheat well.

I just did it, I followed all the directions to a T and added some of your suggestions and recommendations.  And as everyone else here, it was a hit, delicious!  Actually,  am  on a "forever/for the rest of my life" diet, so I try to avoid eating  barbecue sauce, so I will  like to do this recipe again without the barbecue sauce, I am sure it will be very good too.

I followed the recipe and it was delicious! The only change I made was adding a little cornstarch/cold water mixture to the sauce at the end as it was a little runny, so that thickened it up just right and made a nice gravy-like sauce.  Yummm! Served it over mashed potatoes, with coleslaw, and it was a hit.

Very good recipe. Much better than the McCormick seasoning pack I normally use. I read the reviews and added cinnamon.  Boy am I glad I did. It adds amazing flavor! I froze the leftovers. Will see how it is when I reheat. Will be my go to recipe for Pork Roast!

Pretty dernt good. I added the cinnamon as one reviewer recommended. That came out really good. I used Baby Ray's honey sauce and will probably change that next time. A bit too sweet with the brown sugar but still really good. The kids liked it, that means a lot.

Really easy and flavourful recipe. As others stated, there's a lot of liquid to this recipe. I simply removed what I wanted, and added a little more  BBQ sauce before serving.

I ended up not adding brown sugar, since BBQ sauce has quite a bit of sugar to begin with, and used Kinder's "Roasted Garlic BBQ sauce". It cooked a bit faster than I expected (which was fine), but that's probably because I used a 2lb pork butt and not a 4lb. I used telera rolls instead of hamburger buns. Overall a pretty good recipe

I used less onions and drained a lot of the liquid created during the cooking process.  The result was a very tender pulled pork for yummy sliders.  It was a definite hit at my husband's birthday party.

I used a pork butt with bone in, it was already seasoned from store with BBQ season so I skipped the chili power and just added a pinch of cumming to it. I used baby rays sweet and spicy sauce, a small onion instead of a large (large would have been good if I'd had it) and a chicken bolion cube with 1/2 cup water instead of the broth. I left out the thyme bc I didnt have any. This is a mild version of BBQ pulled pork - which my family and I loved - it didn't overwhelm the meat with too much sauce or flavor - it was A perfect amount of taste vs. meat. Oh and I just threw it all in a crock pot around 9 on high and by 2/3 o'clock i pulled the bone right out and we ate.

I used a pork loin instead of a shoulder roast and it turned out fantastic! The next time I make it, the only change I will change will be to leave out the thyme, I thought it gave it an odd flavor. (not overpowering but I think it will be better with out it.)

Amazing and tender. Instead of using chicken broth, I substituted it with beer. Also, I set it on low for 10 hours. The pork fell apart easily. 

Side note - to make it gluten free, I used Omission Lager for my beer substitution.

This is a go-to. I add mushrooms about three hours in. Use Lillie's Q Carolina bbq sauce. Served with tortilla chips and veggie side is my favorite way to eat it, but sometimes I use buns. Reheats well with leftovers. Also good with mashed potatos, mac and cheese, and bbq sauce drizzled on top gravy-style.

My family LOVES this recipe.  Although I put it in my Insta-Pot to have it sooner.  We saute the onions in the pan, then add the other ingredients except veg. oil, followed by a pork shoulder of whatever size.  A 3 lb shoulder takes about 90 min plus maybe 15-20 of slow-release.  The 5 pound shoulder I did last night took over 2 hours, next time I would cut it in half first.  
After we shred the meat, we put it on a quarter cookie sheet and spread it out evenly and broil it on high to give it some nice crusty edges, before serving it with the buttered and grilled potato buns, with a side of bbq sauce.

Made the recipe as written. Cooked on high for 6 hours as pressed for time. Not the greatest pulled pork I've ever had but not the worst. Would have preferred a sweeter, less vinegary sauce. The sauce was very watery so I poured it into a saucepan and reduced it. Will not make this again at least not without some adjustments.

This is the best pulled pork recipe!  The only change I made was I used less thyme, because I was afraid I might not like alot of that taste in it.   About a half hour before serving, I added a little more babeque sauce.

Excellent recipe and will make again, for sure!

I added more mustard and used a bit less barbecue sauce. My kids (a bit on the picky side) loved it! They ate the pork and skipped the bun :)

I have made this many times and love it.  What I do about a half hour before dinner is drain off all the liquid, shred the pork and add fresh barbecue sauce to the pork in the slow cooker.  I often add back a little of the cooking liquid too.   I let it go while I finish making everything else.  The result is a gooey yummy pulled pork with a ton of flavor!

We used a pork loin roast and everything else was to the recipe. It turned out very moist and delicious.  This is definitely one recipe I will be saving. I might play with it but it's great as it is.

I loved it but next time will omit some of the liquid because it was beyond moist, it was like the meat was wet. But the flavor was amazing.

This is the first time that I have cooked a pork butt any way other than on my smoker.  This recipe did not measure up to pulled pork BBQ  from a smoker however it was pretty tasty and, in truth I guess that that is an unfair comparison.

On the plus side it was done in about 41/2 hours and I would have had to babysit the smoker for 10 to 12.

If I try it again I will reduce the amount of Liquid by  a third to a half and will eliminate the onion.

When it was all said and done;  It was pretty tasty on a bun with some cole slaw on top.

This was an easy, really good recipe.  The pork was melt in your mouth tender and mighty tasty!   Because my roast was a little smaller, the amount of pepper may have been a bit too much. We still enjoyed the sandwiches with Lexington BBQ dip from our local Lexington BBQ restaurant where I also got some red slaw and regular slaw.  For our meal I also had baked beans.  Made for a terrific meal!

Followed the recipe pretty closely, adjustingfor the quantity of pork I had. Like another reviewer mentioned I didn't add the vegetable broth, but  did add adobo and chipotle Tabasco to taste.

I've made several times. The first time exactly following the recipe. I have omitted the Thyme. It over-powered the entire dish and I only used 1 teaspoon.
Second change, since I have a "diabetic" in the household, I make the brown sugar using molasses and Splenda and use Kraft Hickory Smoke BBQ Sauce. BBQ sauces like "Sweet Baby Ray's" and "KC Masterpiece" are already very sweet. This way I have more control over the sugar content.
Finally, I "sear" the meat prior to placing in the crock-pot. I like the added color.
It is a great "base" recipe and I will use it, over and over. It is always fun to experiment with different seasonings and methods.

So simple! I added a few ounces of coca cola & no broth. There's was plenty of liquid. Strained it & rendered it into a bbq sauce - was super good! I cooked on high for about 3 1/2 hours - and never checked it. Was perfect!

Didn't make any changes other than mixing all ingredients and then putting in the Polk butt fat side up.  Mine was 7 lbs so it required longer cooking time.  I thought it was great, my husband wanted less onion next time.  He'll be happy with a bottle of sweet baby rays BBQ sauce,  I prefer less sauce than he does.

Very good! I followed everything to a T. Only thing I would change is the amount of thyme. I would put less in there.

I followed the recipe and did not make any changes. I would make it again with a few changes to fit our taste. There was a lot of liquid after cooking and shredding the pork. The BBQ sauce flavor was milder than expected, too. After refridgerating the leftovers for a day, we cooked some in a pan to reheat. It took care of the excess liquid and had a stronger BBQ sauce flavor, which we preferred.

This is an excellent recipe!   I followed the ingredient list (no thyme) almost to the letter (did add a little mesquite liquid smoke) and slow cooked on low for approx. 18 hrs.   After pulling the pork, I also reduced the cooking juices until thickened and then added additional barbeque sauce ( Sweet Baby Rays Sweet & Spicy) and low cooked for 2 more hrs.  Reducing the juices eliminated any runniness.  Final was browning Brioche buns with butter and YEOOOWEEE GOOD!!  This was my 1st attempt and everyone thought I was a master barbeque chef!!

I made the recipe as it was written, except that the pork shoulder I had was 5 lbs. It was delicious! My dinner guests all agreed. I ended up with a lot of sauce after it finished, so I took some of it out before returning the shredded pork to the crock pot. Will absolutely make it again.

My family loved this recipe.  I made it to with a maple syrup barbecue sauce and it was out of this world.   For left overs we did have to add more sauce.    This recipe makes a lot!  10 servings easily.

Followed the recipe except in the end. After I took the pork out to shred, I reduced the juices left in the pot on the stove by about one third and that thickened the sauce up to the right consistency to add back in. Excellent! It's now part of my family's favorites rotation.

I have made this a couple times now. After you shred the pork take 3/4 of the juices from the slow cooker and out them in a small sauce pan. Use a slotted spoon to extract the onions, and pork pieces. Mix 2 tablespoons of flower with some cold water and mix the paste into the saucepan to make a thicker sauce/ gravy. Take the remaining 1/4 of the juices and the extracted onions and mix that into the shredded pork. It is more than enough to flavour it and you get a thicker sauce for your sammies.  Angie's dad's coleslaw recipe on allrecipes.com goes great with this.

The pork came out very tender but the sauce was just okay.  I was expecting something more flavorful with all the great ratings.  I cooked it for 10-12 hours on low and the pork when shredded wasn't runny in the sauce.  I found the sauce bland and added more barbecue sauce and some scriracha.  You might as well have added a sloppy joe type sauce.  That's what it tasted like to me.  Or maybe just use your favorite bottle bbq sauce.  Anyway, I wouldn't brag about the recipe to anyone and prob won't use again.

Made recipe exactly as written. My only critique is that there was quite a bit of liquid when it was done, and I had to drain a cup or so to reduce the rest to what I thought was a more barbecue-like consistency that would not soak the buns/rolls I wanted to use. Having said that, the end result was really delicious - not too salty or sweet, and I would not hesitate to use this recipe again (but w/o the residual liquid, if I can figure out how to do that - otherwise, I'll just drain it).

12  hours on low worked best for me.  Doubled the chili powder.  Definitely skim fat off the sauce and reduce on stovetop.  I put the sauce in the refrigerator  for a few hours.  Fat comes off easily then.  Mild, you could definitely heat up the taste with hot sauce if you prefer.

Didn't put oil in the crockpot, my piece of meat had enough fat on it.  Didn't add the thyme like others said. Loved that most ingredients are typically in the pantry already. Wished the sauce was a little thicker, but the taste  was good.

Instead of chili powder, I used a tablespoon of cayenne pepper, and I also used a little bit of extra brown sugar (like another 1/4 of a cup). Came out really amazing, received a lot of praise from the 9 other people that it fed.

For sandwiches, I put cole slaw, bread and butter pickles, and a little of the BBQ sauce that I cooked the meat with on as condiments. This made some of the most amazing pulled pork sandwiches I have personally consumed.

The meat was incredibly tender, but agree with other reviews that it is bland overall. Once we added some salt, pepper, and extra BBQ sauce, it seemed to help a lot.

I liked the dish but I would leave out the apple cider vinegar next time . It didn't agree with my stomach. It's really good the next day as I tool it to work and added veggies on the side. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very tasty. I had to substitute oregano for the thyme (as I couldn't find in my cupboard). I doubt it made much difference. I have eaten this as a sandwich, on a main dish with sweet potato & greens. I have topped greed salad with the shredded meat for lunch.  I would make it again.

I cooked it exactly as the recipe read.  It was very good.  Instead of putting it on buns I poured it over baked potatoes.  It is very tasty.  I might try eliminating some of the liquid in the future like the broth.  I use "it's better than bouillon" so I could still use the flavoring.  Definitely will make again.

Have made it several times as family loves this BBQ. Not a fan of thyme, so I simply omit or occasionally throw in some cilantro. I also combine the ingredients for sauce in mixing bowl then pour over pan-seared pork. Never fail recipe. Many thanks.

Yum! This recipe looks great! I've never used yellow mustard before! We used a pork tenderloin for a lighter recipe. For more visit www.mapleandgreige.com

Added extra 1/2 C Sweet Baby Ray's to start.   Substituted 1/4 C red wine vinegar and 1/4 C water for Apple cider vinegar.  Stirred in another 1/4 C SBR after shredding.   Used 4.5 lb shoulder, probably should have reduced 1 C of liquid prior to placing pulled meat back in crock, was a little juicy.   I like my BBQ more tangy than sweet and thought this was excellent!  Makes plenty, photo taken after three of us ate it for dinner.

4.5 stars. Hubby loved it and it was good for me. It's a Carolina type BBQ and that's not my fav. Meat was tender and wonderful. I just put more BBQ sauce to my liking on mine.  I used a chipotle BBQ sauce and chipotle seasoning for half the chili powder. We like a bit of heat. I removed half of the juice after returning to cooker. Ty.....i made again in the IP cooked 5lb butt for 80 min, quick release. next  time I will only cook 75. Came out awesome

I made it but made some changes. During the initial cooking period, I used beer in the crockpot. When I pulled the pork roast and shredded, I poured off the remaining beer and used Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sause. Makes a nice simple recipe.
GOOD to the last morsel. You will have to experiment to find what beer you like. I prefer to use a dark beer , like a porter.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated, but 1/2 the amount because I only had 2 lbs of pork tenderloin. It is tasty, however, I did need to put bbq sauce on my bun for some extra flavor. It came out a little watered down to me. My husband loves it, but with the extra bbq sauce added also. My toddler wasn't impressed- but that's not surprising. :) We will make it again.

Really loved this recipe, made it with your recipe first and then I tried just  2 changes, I used pork tenderloin and used muscovado sugar , but at only half the amount that was in the recipe. Both way's worked out great. Will definitely make this again.

This was so good!  I didn't put two garlic cloves in it because I don't like a strong garlic taste. I put in one.  Everything else was put into it, and wow, what a treat!  The aroma was so inviting.   I have saved this recipe.  This would be a good recipe to take to a potluck.  There is only two of us, and I froze it for future sandwiches.

Very good meal- although, this is certainly not low calorie! I pretty much followed except I only used one cup of half and half and then the other cup I used 1 cup of 1% milk and it still turned out amazing!

Easy and delicious !  No chili powder on hand, forgot thyme and still turned out well.  Added about a tsp. of smoke flavoring.  No need to add BBQ sauce.  Tastes great without !  Also....recipe did not call for trimming fat which I usually do for pulled pork.  A little tricky to pull off at the end but I think added to the moistness (cooked on low for 12 hours).  Topped with wilted arugula to mimic pork and broccoli rabe.  Yum !!!

As a Native Texan raised on smoked meats & pit BBQ...this is the closest you can get the "easy way".  We have been using this recipe for over a year probably once a month and it's a huge favorite!  I follow the recipe to the letter, but after cooking & shredding I take about 1.5 cups of the cooking liquid (skim off most of the fat), mix it with 1.5 cups of fresh barbecue sauce, put it all back in the crock pot for an hour...it's AH-MAY-ZING!

This recipe turned out very well, but next time I won't use as much of the vinegar.  It was a little too much for me.  Otherwise it was a hit with the family.

I just made this pulled pork using pork tenderloin.  I knew that tenderloin can be dry, and there seems to be a myth that it doesn't shred.  It shredded just fine. 
A few changes I made: I used 2 pounds of pork tenderloin (instead of 4 pounds of pork shoulder) which entailed 2- 1lb pieces.  Worried that it might become too dry and lean, I doubled the oil, and kept almost everything else about the recipe the same (same liquid 
and spice as original recipe).  I added a tsp of liquid smoke.
I cooked the recipe for 4 hours on high, then another 2 hours on low.
Husband really liked it.  We usually do a smoked pork shoulder with rub in our Bradley smoker, but that's his cooking baby.  We currently have 6 inches of snow on the ground and hubby's sick...so I thought I'd give this a try.
No where near as good as the Bradley smoker, but a relatively quick and easy, leaner, and pretty tasty pulled pork nonetheless.  Might make again.

LOVE this recipe. I doubled the BBQ sauce and used a pork LOIN. It shredded very well!! I didn't have chicken broth so I used water and was satisfied with the result. Easy recipe! Everyone enjoyed it :)

I cooked it low for 10 hours, placed the pulled pork back in the sauce and kept it on warm for a couple of hours, the meat came out OK, not so much sauce.  It was kind a bland for me.  I used Saltlick BBQ sauce.  I will probably cook this again but do some of the reviewers suggestion like add smoke flavor and used a lot more BBQ sauce than a cup.  Probably a different BBQ sauce too.

We enjoyed this but I won't make it again.  As several other reviewers commented, there is too much liquid at the end. When I took the pork out, I thickened the sauce over the stovetop with cornstarch/water  in order to get a thicker consistency.  The taste was good but that was extra cooking time I wasn't counting on. I may try this again with 1/2 the liquid as someone else recommended. (For those who are saying the Thyme is too strong...I believe you have to use ground thyme instead of thyme leaves).

Given the review saying this was too acidic I reduced the vinegar to 3/4 cup. I did not add salt, and increased the amount of meat to 5 pounds. Excellent. Next time I will add more spice.

This is my go to recipe for when we have company. Everyone loves it. The only thing I omit is the Thyme. I toast the buns and add pickles and coleslaw to the buns and its perfect!

This was really very easy to make.  I was worried about the thyme overpowering things, but it did not over power in taste, just smell.  This made a TON of meat! I used a five pound pork roast and we had at least two pounds leftover.  My family likes Carolina style BBQ sauce, Cattleman's gold is the best we have found, but more and more companies are making it now.

I made this a few weeks ago and am making it again now. I discovered that it is very good and doesn't need any barbecue sauce added as the flavors are so good.

I  made 9 lbs of this recipe, and it came out AWESOME!  
I had to substitute the apple cider vinegar with half  white vinegar and half rice vinegar.    
Family loved the left overs also. Great recipe.  Thanks.

Followed exactly.  Great taste and the family liked including a 9 &11 year old.  You could do a slightly larger roast with the same ingredients so it feeds more or to have more leftovers.

This was an excellent recipe. However I did find it in need of an additional tablespoon of chili powder for our taste.
Also I used wild boar shoulder instead of domestic pork.
I served it for a BBQ party and everyone rated it highly.

Great recipe. Turns out well every time. The first time I made it, I took it to work for a staff lunch, and it disappeared like snow before the sun! Many compliments. I’ve changed it up slightly a few times depending on what I have in the house, but kept it basically the same.

I made this for a potluck at work. I used beef in place of the chicken broth and added more spices per previous reviews. There is a lot of liquid, but if you are going to let it keep warm during an event or even don't use it all the first time the liquid really absorbs.  Next time I will be more generous with seasonings.

Great, Great.  I used a 5lbs. bone in shoulder, it really does add flavor!!  I browned it first in an iron skillet then rubbed it with  the mustard, then dusted it with a combo of basic rub and the thyme.  Next time I will add about 1 tea of liquid smoke to the chicken stock.  After shredding just place it back in the pot on the warm setting and let it absorb all that great sauce.  Don't skip this portion of the process.  I cooked it 12 hrs on low.

This recipe was perfect. I took the meat when my slow cooker cut off and it feel apart as I wanted. Then I took 2 forks and shredded the meat. I put the liquid that was in the slow cooker in the refrig to congeal the fat so we could remove it. Then we put the meat and liquid back in the cooker to keep warm with a small crockpot at the side full of BBQ sauce and used Hawaiian rolls for the slider. Everyone at the reunion loved it

Delicious and easy to make. Left out the oil and thyme (personal taste) and added cinnamon. I did still have to add BBQ sauce at the end after shredding to pump up the flavor. Would make it again.

It was pretty good but needed a few tweaks to balance the flavors. I added in typical salt and pepper and then more chili powder cuz I like a little kick. My husband said its the best pulled pork I've ever made!

Did the exact recipe to a T and watched the video. The pork turned out rubbery and did not pull apart whatsoever. Very big waste of money/time.

This is a fantastic recipe that allows for lots of customization. I find the flavour you get is very dependant on the BBQ sauce you choose, so make sure to choose wisely!

The sauce can be a little bit runny when all is done, so feel free to add some corn starch or other thickeners.

Actually found it to be surprisingly tasty, i didn't add thyme, coated pork with mustard and seasoned, added a fig balsamic  glaze with the bbq sauce, cooked on high for about 4hrs
It wasn't overly sweet, mild apple cider taste with bbq sauce

I tweaked it a little by doing a salt, pepper, Adobo, garlic powder and chili powder rum than seared the roast in a cast iron skillet. After I cooked my onions and garlic a little and deglazed the pan with the chicken stock and poured it all in. I would do less thyme next time though. Also I did the 10 hrs on low. Very tender. I made a quick slaw too  with the per bag of mix added mayo, red wine vinegar, salt and pepper. Perfect tang and crunch.

I doubled the recipe because my pork roast was nearly 8 pounds.  Other than leaving out the thyme, I followed the recipe and cooked it in crock-pot overnight.  I pulled the meat apart, discarding as much fat as possible.  I used a separator cup to get as much grease as possible out of the liquid before adding back to the pork.  I continued to cook on slow for a while longer before serving on buns with red slaw  Our family loved loved loved it.  We had a lot of leftover to enjoy again.  Will definitely make this again.

I cook my pork, with water,  in the slow cooker all the time. It always comes out moist.  Have never cooked it with the sauce because I usually just put large chunks in a glass casserole dish and broil with a sauce on top for 3 minutes each side.

 I liked the sauce; it was tangy. I did remove a lot of sauce because it was too much, and added the shredded pork so it wouldn't be too saucy. Thanks for the recipe!

I used 4 1 pound pork loin and trimmed any fat.  It was the best pulled pork sandwich.  I don't really care for sweet BBQ sauce, so this was perfect.

This is the perfect pulled pork recipe. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to thicken the sauce after returning the pulled pork to the crockpot. I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar and then cooked the shredded pork for another 2 to 3 hours on low. DELICIOUS!

Made this for Sunday dinner and my family loved it! Followed ingredients exactly. Only change I will make next time will be to cut the 1/2 cup vinegar to maybe a 1/4 cup. Overall though, very yummy.

I made 1/2 recipe with a pork loin.   I did not have apple cider vinegar so used some balsamic vinegar, did not use chicken broth, was moist enough.  I also used slightly less chili powder since my husband doesn't like hot stuff.  Very good and tender.  Will definitely use again and try with apple cider vinegar.

My husband loved it! This was my second time making pulled pork but my first time with this recipe. It was perfectly tender. It literally fell apart. The flavor was great. Although, when we made the sandwiches, we added additional bbq sauce on the top. Overall, I was very satisfied.

Yum! My fiancé is a chef so I'm constantly trying to "wow" him at dinner and this recipe definitely got a big wow! He loved it and kept telling me how amazing dinner was. I followed the recipe exactly but I always sear my meat before putting in the slow cooker to create a Maillard reaction and add some depth of flavor to the dish. We will definitely be having this again!

I made it using a whole pork loin, added some side pork strips to give it a bit more fat. It came out awesome! I made it for an after golf dinner for 14 people & they loved it.
Thanks for the recipe..Deb

Excellent, easy, and wonderful recipe!  No changes necessary.  I never liked pulled pork until I made this "for my husband."  I think I ended up eating just as much as he did.  Wow!  This is a keeper.  For the 1 cup of BBQ sauce, I used Sweet Baby Ray's.  My favorite.

The pork turned out really great, but the sauce was just watery and awful. Luckily I had an extra bottle of BBQ sauce to thicken it up and add some actual flavor. Disappointed. =(

Given the large quantity of great reviews, I was really hoping I'd like this recipe a lot more.  I followed it to a T, the only difference was I used about 3lbs of meat instead of 4lbs.  I reason I hesitate with this recipe is due to the amount of vinegar.  While I've had plenty of vinegar based BBQ sauces before, I feel that it overpowers in this dish.  If I make this again, I will either lower the amount significantly or cut it out completely.  Per other reviews, there is plenty of liquid in this dish & it wouldn't miss it.  Besides the vinegar, I really did like the flavor and ease of the recipe.

Used  a 5-3/4 lb. shoulder roast and altered recipe slightly using beer instead of broth, smoked paprika and ground mustard instead of prepared. Cooked it in slow cooker on low for 18 hours.  The amount of thin juice was excessive at 8 hours,  but after 18 hours, it dissipated to the proper thickness.  I added a little more beer to moisten it and revive the beer flavor.  Everyone loved it!!   Next time I would omit the salt though.

Was awesome,  did the 10 hour low version.  Needed a dash of salt and a little extra brown sugar.  Also found that near the end the liquid was a bit thin so I put the slow cooker on brown for about 45 minutes with the lid off and it reduced a bit and was good when I put the pulled park back in.

This was really good, it just turned out a bit too soupy.  will use less liquid next time.  cooking is all about making adjustments to suit your own tastes.  For the first time cooking pulled pork, it turned out great.

I love this! I made this for this past 4th of July, ( had a little gathering) and it was a big hit. I used 6 pounds tho. Made it again July 29th and I followed the recipe but used my own portions of the ingredients and it comes out the same. So as long as you use what it says, you'll have no problems making this a great meal.

After the cooking period the crockpot was literally half full with a very watery liquid (plus the fat from the pork). It completely watered down any taste of bbq sauce and most of the seasoning and wouldn't stick to any of the meat. I drained all of the liquid. I then took half of the liquid and put it in a small saucepan on the stop top. I added more bbq sauce and liquid smoke and then whisked in some corn starch and let it simmer for a few minutes until it was thicker. I added it back to the pulled pork and left on warm for 30 minutes. The pork with this sauce was delicious!!!

This turned out very good. The only thing was that there was too much liquid after cooking. I drained off more than 1/2 of the goodness but it would have been too juicy otherwise. I would make this recipe again for sure but maybe cut out the chicken broth because you really don't need any extra liquid.

10 hours on low, fantastic.  May want to add some more chili powder next time.  It turned out slightly sweet, but still great.

Made it exactly as stated! Great will do it again. I had a family picnic recently and made two crock pots of pulled pork, using two different recipes from this site. This was by far the winner with my crowd. Very tasty, tender and not too sweet, it was just right. I had most of the other pot left over.

I followed the recipe except for the amount of garlic (I doubled it) and the cooking time. I set my timer for 3 hours on high, and it was cooked through after only 3 hours. I'm not sure if my crock-pot is extra-powerful, but the meat was super tough and did not pull apart easily at all. The taste was very good, but the dryness and toughness of the pork was disappointing. If I try this again, I will probably set it on low and see if that helps.

It is lighter than your standard pulled-pork recipe, which I appreciated. I am also a fan of vinegar based things, so this was perfect for me and my family. Thank you

The recipe is ok, its a good overall description of how to make pulled pork. Of course a recipe for something like this is subjective and is not an edict set in stone. I cant believe that the best rated comment here is someone suggesting to add "liquid smoke" . Liquid smoke contains methanol, acetic acid, acetone, furfural and various tar and related products. I love adding poison to my families table.

The wife and I made this recipe and it came out delicious! Tons of flavor! We used Cookies BBQ sauce. It did come out a tad runny as far as juices go. That could have been related to the pork we used however. We would definitely make this again!

I thought this was very good and easy, however I seasoned the pork by using a rub all over the pork then browned it before putting it in the crock pot.

Also I felt it had too much liquid, was almost like it boiled so if I make it again I will reduce the liquid.

This came out great with a few tweaks.  I only had a petite roast (about 2.5 lbs) so i cut all ingredients in half except I doubled the worcestershire sauce  and used the 1 full Tbsp of chili powder and full 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also added a 1/2 tsp liquid smoke.  I also left out the oil and onion. I sliced the roast down the middle so 2 halves fit side by side in the crockpot which allows them to sit in the broth better. I also grilled the roasts on the gas grill (high, 3 mins. per side) to get a little charring on the outside.  I cooked it low for 8 hours in the crockpot, removed the meat and allowed it to cool. then I reduced the remaining broth by 1/2 by cooking it down on the stove top.  squishing the meat by hand caused it to fall apart and I added it back into the sauce which the meat soaked up 100% after a a few more mins in the crockpot (no drippy sauce at all).
it came out FANTASTIC!
thank you!

Very good flavor. Only change I would make next time is to go back to using a pork loin instead of the pork shoulder/butt roast so there isn't as much fat. I usually use a pork loin when I make pulled pork but  I wanted to use the other because that is always what it says in pulled pork recipes.

I made 65lbs of pork for 120 guests for our RV Park 4th of July celebration.  I chose it based on reviews and did a trial run with taste testers but was disappointed due to lack of flavor so I changed the chicken broth to Pepsi and the original bbq sauce to Hickory to add flavor.  It was better but still I think my regular Pepsi and brown sugar would've been better and a whole lot simpler.  I cooked some on high for 5hrs, low 10hrs, and low 12hrs. I recommend the 10hrs...the meat slides off the bone and is easy to shred with 2 forks.  This recipe was just "ok" and everyone added extra bbq sauce on top. Kind of dissapointed.

This recipe is AMAZING. I have made it twice for parties we have had and both times everyone raved about it. For the BBQ sauce I have used Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ and I think that added extra sweetness to it. I will definitely be making this again! For the record, I'm an American living in England and this is by far the best pulled pork I've had while living here and it was so easy!

Is was super simple and flavorful. My only complaint is that there was way to much liquid. I poured most of it out and then just added more BBQ sauce. I omitted the thyme and added a little liquid smoke. Next time I would leave out the chicken broth in order to reduce the liquid content.

No changes, and it came out perfect. My mouth waters as I write this.  It would be easy to doctor up to suit individual tastes -- say, add some  red hot pepper flakes, but it's great as is.  And the comment about the ton of leftovers is correct:   I'm single, live alone, and have feasted on it for days!  Besides Austin City Limits, this pulled pork recipe is the best thing about Texas I can imagine!

Great recipe I followed recipe completely until the end but I did not return the meat to its juice. I added barbecue sauce, more brown sugar, season salt, apple cider vinegar to the meat mixed it and cooked in the crock pot for an additional 40 min. Turned out EXCELLENT.

This one is very good.  We have 2 people in our house that can't handle the hot pepper.  Just leave it out.  We do add a little liquid smoke and a few shakes of dried basil.  I also make my own bar-b-q sauce.  (because I have to stay away from pepper) Basil is my pepper.  Works great.

I thought I had found the perfect recipe, and was so excited to try this, with all the great reviews.  Unfortunately, neither my husband nor I cared for it.  The apple cider vinegar smell as it was cooking, and the taste of it when it was done, ruined it for us.

Mostly followed the directions -omitted oil and thyme. Once it was done, took meat out to shred and just poured some of the juices on the meat (I did not transfer it all back in as I didn't want it too watery). Turned out amazing! Made it for a group for a summer BBQ and got rave reviews! Definately will make again!

Amazing flavor!!! Added a little more BBQ after pulling it out and shredding it and it really did the trick! Best pulled pork I have ever had! My family loves pulled pork tacos so this is definitely a new favorite.

This was really good. I made a smaller 2 lb pork ribeye roast it was really good. I halved all the ingredients except the brown sugar. I used oregano instead of thyme because I like the flavor. I also added a pinch of cayanne. I didn't use chile powder I used paprika instead. I would make this again highly recommend and the time is right. I did not find it to watery I did add more Stubbs bbq sauce before serving. A keeper.

My husband and I both loved this recipe. I put some more bbq sauce on top of it after it was done just to get a little more flavor. He didn't, and he loved it just the same.

Too much moisture for crockpot cooking. I left out the broth and still had too much juice when it was done. But tastilicious regardless.

This was a crowd pleaser! I used Brioche buns which were a perfect match with the pork and did not toast my buns (and wasn't necessary).

absolutely perfect! we cooked ours on high for about 5 hours, and it was some of the best pulled pork we've ever made. The only change we made: we added a spoonful of grape jelly and used white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar (because that's what we had on hand). Incredibly yummy, this will make our regular meal rotation for sure.

We enjoyed it.  I did not add the oil.  Cut down the sugar to two tbsp (we are trying to reduce sugar intake) and added  tsp liquid smoke.  Lots of liquid in the end.  I just pulled the pork and shredded it.  I did not put it back in the liquid due to all of the grease.  We just added bbq sauce and piled it on buns.  Yum.

This is the most delicious pulled pork recipe out there. I've tried all the recipes that say you just need root beer or coke but those ones just don't compare to this recipe. I always take the braised pork and then cook it in a pot with all the juices(liquid)from the slow cooker so that the sauce just gets right in the meat. It's really good! I always serve it with coleslaw.

Will definitely make again! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars because  I didn't follow exactly. I added beer instead of broth- it's what I had and another had suggested and omitted the thyme because I'm not a huge fan.

We loved this barbecued pork but had problems. I had a two pound frozen roast that I put in the crockpot along with half the Iingredients. I highly recommend that you follow the directions and not use frozen meat. I cooked it on high for 5 hours and it did not shred. I had to put it in the oven with bottled barbecue sauce and cook for a few hours to get it to the point of shredding for supper. It was delicious and we has lots of leftovers.

My family and I love pulled pork and I keep my eyes open for different recipes to try.  The apple cider vinegar sounded like an excellent idea!   I did make changes based on other reviews (no oil, no broth, no thyme) and I added a fair amount of ground chipotle (family favorite) and liquid hickory smoke--it was EXCELLENT.  Took it to a picnic and had very little left over (I'm glad I had some to enjoy at home).  My boys said it was the best yet and have already asked for it again.  I use leaner pork loin to start with, and skim the fat before combining everything so the flavors are strong and satisfying--not heavy or oily. THANK YOU for this recipe!

For the time and effort this dish requires the payoff didn't meet expectations. Taste was bland and uninspired. I love pulled pork but this dish was a let down.  If I tired it again I would add a few more spices to add to the taste. Also because it isn't smoked it really misses out on that rich, full flavor smoked meats have.  I found there to be too much liquid.  It isn't pulled pork as much as it is a stewed, shredded pork.

Incredible taste. Easy so time was spent visiting with guests. So easy to shred and so tender. Drawback; was a little difficult to get it to thicken so the meat wasn't too wet for the buns

This makes a ton! I used a 3lb piece of pork loin (not tenderloin) and dumped it in the slow cooker still frozen. Ran out of Worcestershire so I subbed soy. Also threw in peel from half an orange and 1/2t hickory liquid smoke. 7-8 hours on high (due to being frozen) and was perfect. I'm in Boston and I fed it to people from North Carolina who approved (and they know their pulled pork)!

THIS is the pulled pork recipe I've been looking for.  The sauce is what was missing on the other pulled pork recipes on this site. Old fashioned, perfect pulled pork.  Just the right amount of tang.  
The only thing I didn't do was use smoke flavoring.  We don't care for it.  Instead, I started a slow fire, with wood chips on my grill.  I put all the charcoal and water soaked mesquite chips on one side and the pork roast on the other.   My purpose was to smoke it, since I don't have a smoker.  I left it in there for several hours, turning it every half hour.  Seasoned using basic seasonings.  Then added it to the slow cooker.  Yes, it took a long time-but the results were worth it.

I followed the recipe more closely than I normally do, but used a lot more chilli and pork scotch fillet instead of shoulder roast on my butcher's recommendation. I also cooked it for a few hours longer. The recipe was very easy to follow and I was very pleased with the result. I didn't make burgers but served it with tortillas and black beans. The discerning dinner guests were all impressed.

I made it and it was very good. Though the meat didn't fall off the bone. It could be because it was the first time I ever made pulled pork and messed up the cooking. I cooked for five hours. Six might have achieved the fall off the bone perfection

Needs a 1/2-1 tsp of liquid smoke depending on your BBQ sauce. 1/2-1tsp crushed red peppers if you like it spicy. Other then that, this pulled pork is a great one. Make sure to use the best BBQ sauce possible. Don't buy cheap stuff like Kraft BBQ sauce. It will taste way better if you spend a few more bucks on Stubbs sauce, or Sweet Baby Rays is pretty good.

Made this twice.
First time I left out the chilli and sugar, left the skin/fat on until just before pulling, doubled the recipe for a larger piece of pork. After 5hrs, it was very runny so I reduced the liquid over the stove and added back to the meat at the end. left for another 1hr. it was delicious but very fatty!

Second time, I used the original recipes ratios with a larger piece of pork (5-6 pound shoulder)
I used 1/4 cup of the sugar, did not use chilli, added liquid smoke. I also cooked 3 onions in oil and 4 tsp smoked paprika to get it caramelised and smokey before I added to slow cooker.
I then removed all the skin from the pork, browned the pork shoulder before putting everything in the slow cooker. 
I kept the skin/fat for crackling at the end.
Cooked this one for 8hrs.

Both times cooking this, there was ALOT of liquid and I had to separate and reduce this before adding back to the pork after pulling it. Well worth it for max flavour!!! 

Served with crackling on the side.

This is my favorite pulled pork recipe. Followed the directions exactly and this is restaurant quality. Actually a lot better than pulled pork I've had in restaurants. Make exactly as described and you will not be disappointed!

I didn't change anything to this recipe. It was very good. I took it to work for my co workers and they all loved it. I just think there was a little too much juice. Next time I'll put a little less chicken broth, no oil. And a little more bbq sauce. I used Jack Daniels No. 7 bbq sauce. It was excellent!

I used a picnic shoulder that I had in the freezer. It turned out pretty well just as written. Living so close to Memphis it wasn't the kind of bbq I am use to but was unique and tasty.

This is really good.  I used a 2.5 lb. pork shoulder roast, trimmed the fat before cooking.  I halved the sauce ingredients(used about 3/4 cup bbq sauce), but omitted the veg. oil, chicken broth, and thyme. Cooked on high for five hours, removed and shredded meat.  Poured sauce in skillet and let boil on stove for a few minutes to reduce, also skimmed off a little fat.  Returned meat to slow cooker, covered with sauce and left for two more hours on low, stirred a couple of times.  Consistency was just right for sandwiches.  Served on grilled ciabatta buns, extra bbq sauce optional.  I didn't need any , it was delicious!  Oh, and I did sprinkle the shredded meat with a little salt.

This recipe is so easy to make you wouldn't think it would produce the mouthwatering restaurant quality meal that it does.  

The pork turns out melt-in-your-mouth tender and the sweet tangy sauce is thick and rich.  We served it on a sesame seed bun, with mounds of dill pickles and ripple chips on the side!

Excellent and easy!  We will definitely do this one again.

I give it two thumbs up or 5 stars!

My husband is kind of a food snob but this recipe sent him back for seconds! It was also super easy to make. You literally just put all of the ingredients in the crockpot, stir, turn on, and dinner is ready 5 hours later. I did let mine cook for 7 hours (we just so happened to leave the house) and it turned out perfectly. I was able cut the meat with one fork. This recipe is definitely going to be a family favorite. Oh! And toasting the buns! OMG!!! It made all the difference! So good!

I made this for my husband and several friends. They loved it! I used about a 5 lb. pork shoulder blade roast and used everything in the recipe except the thyme. I cooked it for 7 hrs on low, 2 hrs on high, and an additional hour on high after it was shredded. It was so juicy and delicious, and the house smelled amazing while it was cooking! We poured it over hoagie buns with coleslaw and fries on the side. It was easy to throw together before leaving for work in the morning, and it was ready just in time for dinner. I look forward to using this recipe many times in the future!

This receipe is a hit with my family.  I do make several changes.  I leave out the broth.  I add a can of tomato paste and oregano, thyme, smoked paprika, cumin, and a pinch of cinnamon.  If I think the sauce needs some more liquid I add 1/4 cup of water.  I also somtimes substitute balsamic vinigar for the apple cider viniger.

Great stuff! I altered the recipe a bit as per the advice of others in the comments. I left out the veg oil and chicken stock, used oregano rather than thyme, and changed the chili powder for a mix of cayene and smoked paprika. Those who complain that it doesn't have that smokey BBQ flavour, well, it won't simply because it's been nowhere near smoke! I might try using liquid smoke at some point, or it can be finished off in a foil roasting tray under the lid of a hot smokey BBQ to try and impart some of that smokeyness.

Yum yum! In the past I've always made pulled pork with just a spice rub, and then added the barbecue sauce at the end. This was SO much juicier and more delicious though, we'll be using this recipe from now on!

This recipe was very good. I will be making it again with just a couple changes. I will leave out the chicken broth, and increase the amount of BBQ sauce. There was way too much thin liquid left at the end and not nearly enough BBQ flavour. I did what another reviewer suggested and froze the leftovers in a muffin tin and then transferred to a freezer bag. Now its super easy to enjoy all the leftovers!

Quite liked this one, made it according to recipe, just added an additional squirt of BBQ sauce on top when putting the bun together. I only had 2.2 lbs of pork so I halved the recipe. Saw others added a touch of liquid smoke so did the same...great addition!

Great recipe. I used it for slow cooker pork chops,  instead of pulled pork, and it worked great. The sauce was thick and I thickened even moe by adding cornstarch to it in a pan, and then pouring it back over the meat. My only change was to use water, as I dislike chicken broth. Next time, I would up the cayenne for a little more heat.

Usedlow-sugar brown sugar (Truvia) and left out BBQ sauce. Perfect.

This recipe yielded the best pulled pork I've ever made.  I started with a lean shoulder, which was nice and followed the recipe with a few exceptions.  1. I increased the yellow mustard to about 3 tbsp, 2. I cut the brown sugar slightly and 3. I omitted the thyme (I was all out!). Also, we enjoyed our sandwiches on plain, fresh white bread.... Which I think was perfect!  Sauce had a great tang and the pork was super tender.  This will be my go-to pork shoulder going forward - even my kids (5, 8) had seconds!

This recipe was delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  Very moist and the toasted buns gave it just the right flavor.  Will definitely make this again!

I have been making this recipe for a year or more now.  I love it.  It is delicious.  Especially when you top the pulled pork sandwich with the Creamy Spiced Coleslaw recipe on this site.

this recipe in the slow cooker just didn't work! After 6 hours on high the meat was so tuff. I put the meat and sauce in my pressure cooker for 40 minutes and it came out soft and tender. Flavor was good.

Fantastic recipe. 
Was a bit watery, so I left on high with the lid off for 45 mins  at the end. Worked a charm :)

Family loved it!  I made this with a few tweaks, I omitted the thyme  (just a personal preference)... After getting everything ready I realized I didn't have apple cider vinegar,  HOWEVER... I just happened to have a an Angry Orchard hard Apple cider Ale, and it worked absolutely wonderful!!!  I've always added beer to my BBQ sauces anyways and this turned out so juicy and tender!

This was sensational!!!  I cut all of the fat off the pork before popping it into the slow cooker and just turned it every 2-3 hours to make sure it stayed moist.  I slow cooked it for 8 hours, then took the pork out and shredded it.  I tipped half of the juices out of the slow cooker, squeezed a generous amount of smoky BBQ sauce into the mix together with a heaped tablespoon of cornflour to thicken it up, then put the shredded meat back in with the juices and slow cooked for another 1 1-2 hours.  Heaps left over but my family absolutely loved it!!

The four stars are for the recipe exactly as written.  And with apologies to those who would prefer that we review the recipe exactly as written:  I substitute root beer for the chicken stock and don't add the barbeque sauce until after the pork is shredded.   I  remove the pork and let it sit a few minutes before shredding in the expectation that some juices will seep back into the meat.  l reduce and thicken the cooking juices with corn starch and I add the barbeqe sauce at the end before adding the thickened sauce to the shredded pork.   I freeze any leftovers in  two serving packets.
And I serve with mashed potatoe rather than buns.  It is a great recipe that I come back to every time I find pork on sale.

T'was delish, I didn't add the vegetable oil due to the fat on the shoulder, and I added a dash of cinnamon. Everyone said it was the best they'd had. I cooked on low for 12 hours because I had to start it before work so I didn't want to put it on high. This was my first attempt at pulled pork! I am proud of myself.

It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.  Next time I may double up on the BBQ and use less onion.

This is absolutely fantastic! Bonus, we ate delicious leftovers for a week! My husband (who is not a cook) made this using tenderloin and Stubbs spicy bbq sauce - plus, top it with some good coleslaw - and it was divine! We have batch #2 in the pot now and I can hardly wait 30 more minutes for it to be finished! Thanks for posting this delicious pulled pork recipe, don't change a thing!

Very tender meat.  A little on the sweet side.  Hubby likes black pepper, and will probably use less acv and brown sugar and more bbq sauce!

It was amazing! Best pulled pork I have ever tried! Used Monterey Jack to top it off and all on an onion bun, toasted with garlic butter. Yum.

The taste of thyme was too pronounced and there was a lot of liquid.  After I shredded it and before I put it back into the crock pot, I ladled out an extra 2 1/2cups liquid.  I also added extra BBQ sauce to try and combat the thyme.  Whether or not you ladle out some of the sauce before adding the pork back to the crock pot is entirely personal preference though, as is the amount of thyme.  We're not huge on it in my house, so next time I make this I'll halve the amount called for.

I used a 4.8 pork shoulder added 12 0z of chicken stock to compensate for the larger cut of meat.  I also added 2 TBL of Liquid Smoke.   A little on the 'watery' side but tasted great.

It definitely made a lot of liquid as was mentioned a few times in other reviews,  but I'm not sure that would preclude me from using all the same ingredients next time.  The only changes I made were: I added a bit of liquid smoke and after it was done, I added more bbq sauce.   Everyone loved it.  It was a hit.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. It didn't say if the four pounds was bone in or boneless, but I went with bone in for the extra flavor. However, after the 5-6 hours of cooking, it was VERY watery so maybe it meant four lbs boneless. To thicken it up, I cooked it on high for an additional two hours with the lid opened for steam to escape. I used sweet baby rays bbq sauce and unfiltered apple cider vinegar. It had a weird after taste that I'm not sure was due to my choices, or just the recipe in general. I would taken another star off for that, but my sister claimed it was the best that she ever had so I gave it back.

Made this yesterday in my pressure cooker as it's 36 degrees outside, so needed it done quickly. Added some HP sauce as I was out of Worcestershire sauce and added the last of an American smokey bbq sauce with Jack Daniels. Absolutely fantastic, having pork sliders tonight with slaw. Yum! Will definitely do this again.

This is delicious! It's a very versatile recipe you can adapt to suit your own tastes. I followed people's suggestions to add cinnamon and cook it on low for 24 hours (I had 20 by the time I was ready to cook). I also strained out the onion and garlic (I added about 8 cloves) after about 12 hours, since my mom is allergic. I served that as "chutney" for the onion-eaters, and it was good. I replaced the sugar with maple syrup and left out most of the chicken stock. Be sure to cook it for a good amount of time after pulling it apart because that's when the flavor really sinks in. I added a bit more bbq sauce after pulling. And use a BIG roast because the leftovers just get better and better! I originally served it over English muffins, then had it on tostadas and in salad. Coleslaw is a MUST. Can't recommend this recipe highly enough!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  When we ate the pulled pork sandwiches we put a little bit of coleslaw on the bun and it was delicious.   I cooked it for 10 hours on slow cook.  Will make again.

It turned out really well. My husband and son  really liked it. In fact , I will definitely make it  a lot. Had great flavor. One review suggested salting a little before cooking it . I'm not sure if that helped but will do that from now on. I also squeezed some honey in with the other ingredients we like a sweet taste. I also drained some of the juice from it and added more barbecue sauce after shreddeding the pork b/c I wanted a thicker sauce. I returned the  shredded pork and extra barbecue back to the slow cooker to keep it warm. I served mine on unbuttered kaiser rolls.

I used a 3 and a half pound boneless roast and it filled 24 sandwiches.  They were really easy to make and the flavor was very good.  I could really taste the cider vinegar influence.

This was really good! My picky three year old ate a whole sandwich. i slow cooked it for 4 hours on low then 4 hours on high and it was falling off the bone when i took it out of the slow cooker! This made enough for my 5 person family plus extras for lunches the next day! Im always a fan of leftovers! will definitely make again

Delicious!  Made it as described but left out the thyme because my son is allergic to it.  It was very tasty.  Our family of four all went back for seconds and nearly demolished a 3.5 lb shoulder roast.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue Sauce which is on the sweet side and this added a nice tang.  The only change I would make next time is maybe add some salt to the meat before cooking.  I salted it at the table and it definitely kicked up the flavor.

I followed this recipe exact. There was alot of liquid left in the slow cooker after the cook time. I personally did not care for it, but my husband and daughter liked it. I was hoping to get pulled pork that is served in barbeque shacks but this did not meet those expectations. I probably wont cook this again.

It is awesome!! I didn't have regular chili powder so I used chipotle chili powder and didn't use quite as much.  End result was kind of sweet and spicy. Great recipe!!

Very tender. Did not use the chicken broth. Had enough liquid without it. Used 7.5lb pork roast butt in crockpot on high for  7 hours. Tip:  after removing bone and fat layer, shred the pork using the kitchen aid mixer paddle. Less than 2 minutes, all the pork is shredded and ready to eat. So easy.

We are not big on pork in this family but I decided to give it a try. Followed the recipe exactly and can't get over how the pork fell apart with just a fork! Kids can't get enough! Loved it!

This stuff is fantastic! I used a smaller pork shoulder so it took a little less time. I also used a honey bbq sauce so it would be a little sweeter and malt vinegar just because I couldn't find any apple vinegar. Slow cooking is the way to go. Throw everything in and do something else for the afternoon.. Just awesome flavour !

We thoroughly enjoyed this with only a slight change to the recipe: I used boneless country style ribs and they were truly tasty.  I modified the process just a bit by putting the onions on the bottom of the slow cooker first and then added the meat.  Also, to get all the spices mixed,  I combined all the wet ingredients with the spices  and then poured it over the meat. Wonderful weeknight entree!

This was the first time I made pulled pork. The only thing I did different was using a pork tenderloin.  Next time I will use a little less onion. Seemed a bit much and I love onions.

Made it according to the recipe, terrible!
 Reworked by adding a package of dry onion soup mix and more BBQ sauce. Was a lot better then . Would not make it again. A lot of work when Onion soup and BBQ sauce does a better job.

I used Kroger mustard barbecue and pork loin because we are watching calories and carbs. It was still quite tasty but different. We added tomatoes to it when we ate it and found that was what was missing.

Delicious! In my slow cooker, it took much less time than the recipe called for, so adjust accordingly. This makes a huge bowl of leftovers, and it's even better the next day. Served on toasted challah buns, it's pork nirvana!

Super easy, pretty inexpensive for the amount it made, and very yummy!! My son added extra bbq sauce on his when I served it but I didn't feel like it needed it. Big hit, will definitely make it again! (I left out the thyme cuz I didn't have any.)

Made this exactly as instructed and it was awesome. My boyfriend loved it! One mistake I made was placing the roast fat-side-down. Should be on the top so it melts down into the roast!! Yummm. I also used more garlic than called for, about 4 cloves. I froze my leftovers in muffin tins and placed them in a freezer bag once they set the next day. This was a great strategy. About one muffin tin let sandwich. Also so great with rice!!

Although this pulled pork was good and very tender, it wasn't perfect. I enjoyed that the pork wasn't completely soaked in BBQ sauce (like so many other recipes where all you taste is the BBQ sauce) but rather, stood alone in a more clear-style sauce. However, the taste of the pork itself was not perfect to me. It was tangy and sweet but not in the right proportions. I wish the meat itself has been saltier and less tangy. I also felt the onion pieces were overpowering, next time I will either chop them finer or quarter them so that they can be removed when the pork is being pulled. Not a bad dish by any means, just not quite what I was hoping to get out of it.

This recipe is great. My picky family loved it. The pork came out tender, so I just shredded it in the crock pot. Only thing I eliminated was the Thyme, and that's because I didn't have any on hand. I will be making this again.

I made the recipe for 26 people and had to cook that much meat longer. So I roasted it at the suggested temperature then turned it down to 200 and covered with foil, baked it all night in the oven. It was the perfect blend of burnt tips and tender meat. My guests ate every bit.

This recipe is now a family favourite! I changed it up slightly by using hot English mustard instead of a yellow mustard (well it was still yellow!) and it added a beautiful kick to the flavour! Also added a bit more garlic, but everything else was followed exactly and it was the juiciest most delicious meal! I also served it up with tacos and a home made guacamole to make it a TexMex styled meal, not allowed to make tacos any other way now!! Thank you!!

Delicious!! My twenty something sons went bananas over this barbecue! It's a keeper. So easy. My one son doesn't like spicy food so I decreased the chili powder to about 1/2 tsp. and I didn't have any thyme.

My new go-to recipe!  Took longer than the time stated, but well worth the wait!  Serve this with sweet and tangy coleslaw and Pork & Mindy's BBQ and you've got a great meal!

It has become a staple for large crowds. I use Wegmans Memphis BBQ sauce for the BBQ sauce and it gives it extra flavor.

This recipe is amazing!!
My only advice is to ensure you use a good pork shoulder from a BUTCHER. I've made this a total of 3 times, and one of the times I bought the pork shoulder from a supermarket and you could see and taste the difference.

The best recipe I've found so far for pulled pork.  Used Kraft Sweet Honey Barbeque sauce instead of Sweet Baby Rays.  Also used 3/4 of a large videla onion.  Everyone loved.

I have made this twice. I have been keeping sugar out of my diet so I haven't used barbeque sauce, worsteshire (sp?), or brown sugar. I substitute raw, unfiltered honey for the brown sugar. I also use one tablespoon of sea salt. It turn out quite nice. I am experimenting now to improve the BBQ sauce free version. Maybe on a cheat day I will follow the recipe as listed. I am sure it is even better.

Excellent! If you love the slightly spicy flavor, I used chipotle chili powder instead of normal chili powder. Amazing!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I used a larger bone in pork & doubled the recipe. I strained the juice before mixing it with the pork to get rid of the bits of fat floating around. It was delicious!

Very good! I followed the recipe. I cooked this for 6 people, two of whom are quite picky. Everyone, myself included, loved it. Next time, I may double the recipe, so there will be leftovers for lunches.

Really delicious!. Just by chance, I had found baby Ray sauce in a uk supermarket this morning. I wouldn't bother with the chicken stock next time, and I reduced the remaining liquid down, on the stove, before mixing back through. Yum

Slow Cooker Texas Pulled Pork Haiku: "Perfectly porky! Slow and low, it fell apart. This made a mountain!" We ate a ton, ate even more the next day, AND I froze some too.  Followed everything as written other than skipping the veg oil on the bottom of the crockpot. Can't think of anything that I would do differently when I make it again other than maybe plan on having company over to share it w/!

There was WAY too much liquid for the meat! I strained off at least 3 cups of liquid and tasted it. The meat was tender but there wasn't really any flavor. I won't be following this recipe again.

Like others, I omitted the oil (no need) and onion (didn't have). I cut the recipe in half and found that 5 and a half hours was plenty of time to cook and fall off the bone. Instead of returning it to a pot full of mostly grease, just served after shredding. The thicker sauces tend to liquefy in the heat so if you like a lot of sauce on yours, set some aside.

Amazing, I used a apple whiskey BBQ because it was on sale and pairs well with pork. I personally never measure my spices but this combo is to die for! I made this for my family because I don't like pork and ended up eating it with them. I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe as written. Very tasty and full of flavor.
The next time I make this I will cut the thyme to 1/8 tsp.
It was too overpowering with the recommended amount.
 I also used cornstarch to thicken the sauce as someone suggested. Great input.  I omitted the oil as well. 
 I will make this again. With this adjustment. Thanks for sharing!

I have always wanted to try pulled pork and I am really impressed with how this turned out! I ended up buying two different cuts of pork (shoulder + rump) that were approximately 0.5kg each. Aside from the type of pork and the amount of pork being a bit less,  I added some chili flakes and some onion + garlic + cumin powder. I started it at 2pm on high, and by 7pm the pork was ready to be shredded, so I did that and put it pack in the pot. I then continued to cook it on high without the lid until 8:30pm to help dissolve some of the juices as there was quite a bit. This might have been a matter of having less pork than what the recipe called for, as well as quite a bit of juice got added from the fat of the meat. I served this on a ciabatta bun with greek yogurt slaw and my partner and I  devoured it! When I took it out the next day to serve left overs, I noticed that there was a significant amount of congealed fat. I think next time I am going to do my best to cook it a day before I want to serve it, just so I can separate the pork from the juices , then the fat from the juice at room temp, and re-add the juice to the pork. I will say choose your BBQ sauce wisely as I feel that different ones will transform the flavor. We used Club House Whiskey Smoked BBQ, I will definitely try this recipe again!

I've made this 3 times now;  most recent was last night.  I thought I'd put in a review!  I personally would add more BBQ sauce (maybe 1/2 cup more?) to give more flavor.  I cooked a 4lb pork butt for 10 hrs on low.  Meat was very tender, but not real flavorful.  I followed recipe exactly, but omitted the oil and thyme.  WAY too much liquid, so I get rid of half of it, then put shredded pork into the saved half of liquid.  I always end up adding more BBQ sauce to thicken and add flavor.  (usually 1 cup).  I will make it again, but will have to have more BBQ sauce on hand.  Oh, and add those french fried onions on top of the pork in the sandwiches!!!  They add crunch and GOOD flavor!  My husband & son will NOT eat these without the fried onions!  BETTER than cole slaw.   Serve the sandwiches with:  corn on cob, baked beans, watermelon, cole slaw, etc....

Have cooked this quite a few times and is always a hit. Instead of using just normal BBQ sauce I use Sweet Baby Rays Hickory and Brown Sugar sauce, it just seems to give it that lovely smokey flavour that you are missing by cooking it in the slow cooker.

Perfect!  I reduced the chili powder to 2 teaspoons.  We had a lot of leftovers and discovered this freezes really well for future meals too.  This is by far our favorite pull- part pork recipe.

Great entree. Made so much I had to give some away, I should have used my favorite bbq sauce but I used a new brand and didn't like the flavor that much. Once I added my own sauce it worked out perfectly. Needs a little more flavor though, more onion or garlic or some kind of bold flavor.

This is what I think of when I think of pulled pork. I used the Sweet Baby Ray's as directed. Good stuff. Crowd was pleased. I bought a 6lb. bone-in shoulder that did not fit in my 4qt slow cooker. Had to hack through that bone with a sub par cleaver to make it fit. That was tough.

I made this for family and neighbours. Everyone loved it, I got to many compliments.  This will be my go to recipe for pulled pork. I used a 6lb pork loin. I used 1.5x for the rest of the ingredients. Garlic I used 3x. It is highly rated for a reason. Great recipe - thanks for sharing.

I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I omitted the chicken broth and veg oil as my roast had plenty of fat on it for moisture. I feel the thyme would taste off in this so I left it out. I did add chicken bullion for flavor. I added a pint of my homemade BBQ sauce and left out the onion as I was out. It cooked on high for about 5 hours, then on low for another 5. For the last hour of cooking I removed the roast, shredded it with two forks, skimmed the fat from the top on the liquid in the pot and then put the shredded pork back into the liquid. I added a touch of store bought BBQ sauce and let the flavored meld for an other hour. Served on homemade buns.

This by far has been the best pulled pork.  I didn't add barbecue sauce because my husband doesn't like it and it was perfect even without it. Will be making this recipe from now on.

I just did a few things differently for personal preference only. I put the chili powder directly on the roast, eliminated the thyme (don't like thyme) and increased the vinegar for a more Carolina-like taste. Otherwise, followed the directions and it turned out fabulous. Will be doing this again - with an 8-lb. loin roast - in a few days to take on vacation to Lake Placid. Thank you!

I'm currently away at training, so I having to learn how to cook.  Needless to say, I miss my wife's awesome kitchen talent! I made this in my 2qt crock pot and followed the recipe exact, but cut the ingredients straight in half.  It came out amazing and the guys loved it.  I will be making this again, especially when I get home and cook for my family (for once!).

I loved the flavor of this pork. I think the thyme made the difference. Didn't try liquid smoke but that would probably make it even better. Too much liquid though.  I was afraid to remove liquid because of the awesome flavor. Agree that the veg oil is not necessary. May try without chicken broth and cookin it longer. The combo of spices and flavor so was great though!

This is a really good recipe.  I have a small 3.5 L crock pot.  Used 2 smallish roasts (about 1 kg each).  Cooked it on low overnight for 12 hrs.  The meat just fell apart when I took it out to shred.  The recipe does make quite a bit of liquid, but I think all the ingredients should be used to get the right flavour.  I thickened the liquid a bit with 1 TBLSP of corn starch and then poured about 1/2 of it over the meat when I returned the meat to the crockpot for a couple of hours.  Very good - I should have made more!

This is by far the best recipe for pulled pork I've tried yet! My fiancé agrees and the only thing I changed was less oil. One of the other great things about this recipe is that it still has a great bbq flavor but it's not to overwhelming so when we use it for leftovers,we can do tacos,nachos and pizza!!

Pick the barbecue sauce that you like, it makes a big difference to the flavor. The pork cooked up tender and juicy.?

Great recipe!  The only thing I did differently was to add 1 teaspoon chipotle power and 1 teaspoon ground cumin to add a bit of heat after I added the pork to the sauce.  Definitely making this one again!

I made this just as the recipe is presented. It's ok but lacking the sweetness I'm used to in pull pork.

Family loves it.  I like to cook on low for 10 and refrigerate overnite so all the flavors sink in and cook on high next day for 2 hours and serve.  Use baby rays  bbq sauce and mix flavors,  sweet vidalia is awesome.

I doubled this recipe with no issues. We tend to like the pork really juicy so I added a bit of extra BBQ sauce and chicken stock. I paired it with some Amish Cole Slaw and Potato Salad (which were both made a day ahead) for an easy meal for 11 people. Plenty of leftovers, and everyone ate well.

Made this the other day for friends. Awesome. Made some fresh coleslaw to add to the sandwich, what a great combo. Love the tip of buttering and grilling the buns. It added real southern home style authenticity, not that this recipe needed any more.

This was the best pulled pork recipe I've tried.  Everyone raved about it.  I added smoked paprika and used quite a bit more BBQ sauce than the recipe called for.  I used part Stubbs original and part Stubbs spicy.  Just the right amount of heat.  I spent a good 10 minutes skimming fat toward the end of cooking.  I had the meat in the slow cooker on low for 8 1/2 hours and then shredded it.  Very moist.  I served it with grilled pub rolls and creamy spiced coleslaw.  A hit!

made a few changes, first off I used a 4pound beef roast, instead of the pork. just what i was in the mood for, omitted the thyme, as suggested in a review, added cinnamon and liquid smoke and cooked in crock pot on low for 22 hours. i feel like it tasted kinda burnt, and a little greasy, so maybe next time i'll omit the oil like suggested. meat had very little fat on it so didnt have to worry about getting it off, fell apart on it's own through out the day, was very good, even so that the pickiest eater in the house went back for seconds :) we served them on toasted grinder rolls, with the tops cut out in a v shape rather then cut on the sides, with butter and shredded cheddar, just put in oven on 400 for a few minutes. got alot of compliments! thanks, def a keeper!!

This is a really good summer recipe.  Put it together and go to the beach, come home to a delicious dinner.  This works great in tacos. Or enchiladas, salads, wherever your imagination takes you.  The depth of flavor is wonderful.  Don't think you'll be disappointed in this one.

spices really came through in this recipe. I used a 3 lb. pork butt and followed the recipe exactly. I found the sauce to be just enough and it clung to the meat nicely. The only change I would make next time would be to omit the brown sugar as I found the sauce to be too sweet for my taste, but that could be because my BBQ sauce is sweet to begin with. Thanks for a great recipe. This one's a keeper.

It was very good. I'll make it again. Tip: Use a slow cooker plastic liner to make clean up super easy! You can find them in ziplock bag isle at the store. It's like a baking bag that you put in your slow cooker. Then when you're ready to clean up you just throw the bag away and you're done! Once you use these liners you'll never go back to the old way again.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but this definately wasn't done cooking in time, so I let it cook longer till it would pull apart, it then came out tasting like Corned beef....Wondering what I could have done to screw up an easy recipe.

Awesome recipe. I made it exactly as directed and it was great! However I did feel like I had to skim the oil/fat layer off the top of the sauce once the meat was finished cooking. And added extra BBQ sauce before serving to thicken it up a little. But flavor was great. This is my new favorite way to make BBQ especially in the winter when I can't grill.

Took a bit of a risk making this for Sunday dinner as I had had pulled pork once but the family hadn't. My wife was a little skeptical. However, there was no complaints as everyone's plate was cleared - even the fussy eater finished his. Easy to make and it just fell apart after I removed it from the crockpot. Served with coleslaw on toasted hamburger buns.

Every time we go on a ski trip or camping trip we make this.  It's delicious and is easily doubled to feed a crowd.  Just before serving we butter and toast the buns in the oven, and make coleslaw with dressing to put on top of each sandwich.  We use shredded cheddar cheese and extra bbq sauce for toppings as well.  I am always asked for the recipe!

Tryed this and it was very good however I would leave the chicken stock and thyme out of it. I am not a fan of the spice and the chicken broth made it too watery.. Also for the flavor I recommend 2 cups of BBQ sauce not one..only because for me it wasn't enough and I had to add it on the buns.

Everyone loved this recipe!  Simple and great tasting. Even tried it with chicken, delish. Good to make for a crowd but if you do, there is no need to multiply the sauce per pound of meat.

So delicious! This was my first time using my slow cooker and I could not be more pleased. Used a total of 5 lbs of pork and cooked it on high for 5 hours. Used all ingredients except the chicken broth (all out) but the pork still came out very juicy. It was actually a tad bit too watery for my liking so I'll probaly use half the amount of apple cider vinegar next time around. Used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy bbq sauce which was so yummy.

Perfect! I mixed the ingredients into a sauce and poured it over the roast in the crock pot (except thyme, didn't have any). I liked it so much, I made it again to reserve as a sauce for serving (brought it to a boil and let it thicken up). Next time, I'll just double the recipe.
When it was cooked through and tender, I drained off the cooking liquid, pulled it, and added some of the reserved sauce. Topped it with coleslaw, onion, and pickle on a toasted bakery roll. Absolutely perfect!

Absolutely the best pork I've had!!!! We made 9lb shoulder, so doubled the ingredients and added canned banana peppers. The only "change " I'm going to make next time is use a lot more onions & garlic, it's the best relish u can find for the sandwich.

Marinated a pork butt not a tenderloin in apple cider vinegar with a habanero, then used a dry rub placed in slow cooker with garlic, root beer and Worcestershire sauce for five hours then added just a little spicy bbq sauce.  It was ahhhhhhmazing. The left overs were added to my trash can beans the next day

This recipe is great! I tried a similar one last year, but couldn't find it so searched Pinterest and this is one of the best pulled pork recipes I've tried. I didn't have apple cider vinegar, so used balsamic vinegar instead, and it worked great. I also let it slow cook on low for 7 hours. I'll keep this recipe and use it often!

I am allergic to worcestershire sauce so I made a couple of changes. I added 1/2 can of coke, 1 tbsp of lime juice, 1 tbsp soya sauce, and 1 tsp cayenne. It was a big hit.

My family loves this recipe.  I did a slight variation.  I cooked the meat in 1 can of root beer for 5 hours until it fell apart with a folk, then drained it.  Then I added in the marinade and refrigerated for 24 hours.  I also added in a few tbs. of liquid smoke and a little more garlic.  The next day I reheated it through in the crockpot and served on toasted buns.  The meat was tender and juicy and infused with the bbq flavor.  It really pays to give it that time to marinade.

I sprinkled my 2.5-lb. pork sirloin roast with salt, pepper and chipotle powder about an hour before cooking. I didn't have broth so I used scotch ale instead. After shredding, I turned it back on high and took off the lid and it thickened up nicely. I also loved the toasted bun idea. Overall, delicious!

Taste was ok, I simply thought it was too "liquid". Needed to be thicker, going to try a bit of corn starch next time to help the consistency.

Another one of my mistakes.  I added WAY too much barbecue sauce (5 cups and not sure how I read that) so it was very overwhelming.  

We will definitely try again. For now...a five.

Tried this recipe tonight and it was instantly a favorite. I used a recipe for homemade BBQ sauce I got from this site and did not add as much onion as this recipe called does but the result was amazing! Thanks for submitting this recipe.

Good recipe with a few changes. Omitted the sugar, BBQ sauce, thyme and mustard used in the cooking and added 3 tbsp. of liquid smoke instead with the other liquid ingredients. After you cook and shred the pork, put in a pan and now add a whole bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce. MM MM GOOD!

I was in kind of a rush when I prepared this for a pot luck for our Climbing team. It had a sweet taste but was pretty dry for me, again, may have been the rush, but I recommend this recipe.

Made this with a 5 lb. pork shoulder.  Did not use the Thyme as that flavor would not have appealed to me but aside from that this was a GREAT tasting recipe.  Cooked it in the crock pot for 6 hours and it was very tasty.  The only down side to this recipe is that the sauce is a bit runny so when you put the meat on the bun the bread gets soggy very quickly which was a major turn off for my family and what caused us not to rate it with 5 stars.  I feel that this recipe would be better off if used not for sandwiches but for just eating pulled pork, the next time I make this I will eat it that way with garlic/butter toasted bread and a hash brown casserole!  You have to try this recipe it is very good!!!

I made this recipe after getting tired of using the packets of dry seasoning mix ( McCormick). I don't like pork smothered in BBQ sauce, and this turned out PERFECT!! A little spicy and a little sweet. The family thought it was great and  it was gone before I knew it!

Very good but I didn't use chili powder or thyme bc I didn't have any.  Definitely worth making again.  Next time I will try it with thyme and chili powder to see the difference.

This is it! The most flavorful slow cooker pulled pork recipe I have ever made or tasted. Please if you are debating between this and the rootbeer one, make this. I have made both and the other pales in comparison. I followed this recipe exactly, except used a 3lb loin roast with the fat trimmed off. Cooked high for 5 hours and kept the crockpot on warm for the rest of the day. About an hour before serving I shredded it up and threw it back in to soak up more flavor. Toasted onion rolls and topped the pork with coleslaw. Perfection! It does make a lot though so I am freezing the leftovers for another meal later this month.

I have never made pork shoulder roast, ever. Today I followed this recipe and it was perfect. My family loved. Next time I'll get more meat and have a family (siblings and parents) party. Again, it was great. Thank you.

This was very tasty. I used apple cider vinegar and the vinegar taste was quite strong. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will cut the vinegar in half.

It had way too much liquid. The flavor is good but just not smoky. I would probably not use as much vinegar next time.

This recipe gets 3 stars for convenience, but the flavor was unfortunately mediocre.  I did leave out the thyme as some suggested, but I don't think it would have made that much difference.

Fantastic pulled pork! I used a 5lb roast and intended to follow recipe exactly since it was first time. Accidentally forgot the brown sugar and Worcestershire, but since I used honey barbecue sauce I guess it made up for omitting the sugar. I did add a couple dashes of liquid smoke, though recipe didn't call for it. Served on fresh Portuguese rolls for my son's 17th birthday party so did not bother to toast and butter the rolls...didn't think it was worth the trouble. Everyone loved it!

This was worthwhile making and I have saved the recipe to make again. It really was tender and fell apart as I lifted the meat out to "pull". I would agree with previous comments that the oil and broth were probably not necessary, but I would have to prepare without to make this call.  I didn't think it was too sweet at all and my 8 year old loved it.

This was my first time cooking a pork shoulder, and I guess I didn't realize what a fatty cut of meat it is.  Mine was 7 lbs, bone in, and I adjusted the ingredients accordingly, omitting the chicken stock and vegetable oil.  It took a really long time to cook to the point where it could easily be shredded, probably due to being a bone-in roast.  At the end I had to go through and pick out all the fat and try to skim the sauce.  The amount of fat truly disgusted me and I had a hard time enjoying the meat because of it.  However, it did have a good flavor in the end and my family enjoyed it, so I would make it again, but next time trim off the majority of the fat beforehand.  This would be a great pot luck dish with these adjustments.

maybe it was the meat that I used; a 2.5 lb. pork serloin roast, but I didn't care for the sauce either. It tasted sour. I put it all in fridge, no fat rose to the top. The next day I put it on the stove & added a mixture of 2 T. cornstarch to 1 T. apple cider vinegar to thicken it. Also, added a couple sprinkles of cinnamon, couple T. br. sugar, & a little more bottled bbq sauce. Simmered, now its back in the crockpot. Hoping I'm able to save this!

Like the picture shows, it needs more BBQ sauce. It is not as flavorful as I thought it would be, but adding premade BBQ sauce like in the picture makes it better. I might try a different recipe next time

Meh. It was easy to make, and fell apart great, but the taste was not there. If I were to ever make this again, I would at least half the vinegar as it overpowered the taste and left the pork a little too greasy for my liking. My boyfriend did enjoy it, and we've already eaten three meals of it... it's not bad but I'm not all that impressed either.

This was so great, and easy too! We didn't include the thyme because we didn't have it and didn't really want it anyway. We bought little mini slider buns and made sandwiches.

My husband, who would eat BBQ for breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday said this was really good. Based on others' comments, I used marjarom instead of thyme because I think it works better with pork. I also used a couple teaspoons of pure Indian chili instead of a tablespoon of the McCormick's type chili, which is really a blend of spices and not pure chili.

Excellent!  I made this according to the recipe, and it was the best pulled pork I've ever had!  My family loved it as well.  It did take longer to cook in my crock pot -- almost seven hours on high until it easily pulled apart, and I then cooked it another hour on low.  I served it on Hawaiian rolls -- delicious.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made a few adjustments (Not adding mustard, oil or thyme, cooking on low for 16 hours, taking out pork, shredding it, removing a lot of the juice, then cooking it in a bottle of my favourite BBQ sauce for another 8 hours), but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

I strongly recommend cooking it for 24 hours if you can as advised by previous reviews. 

It was amazing! Everyone loved it, and even the veggie was eyeing it up!

This recipe was excellent!  I added some cinnamon as another had suggested to deepen level of flavour.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Perfect amount of liquid. It all absorbed after the pork was shredded and allowed to cook for another hour.

This was a great recipe. I followed exactly as above but with a 10 pound pork shoulder and cooked on low for about 16 hours then turned to keep warm. It was so tender and the flavor was so good my family didn't even need BBQ sauce on top. They all loved it.

To reduce the amount of liquid (and fat) I first seared the roast on the grill and then cooked it in beer for 5-6 hours. Removed the roast to shred and emptied the liquid from the pot, then followed the recipe....delicious.

This was outstanding! I let it cook on low for two hours and then bumped it up to high. The flavors really melted in your mouth. My husband, who is typically not a huge eater, ate two full sandwiches. I will definitely make this again!

Made the recipe exactly to the letter with all fresh ingredients except cooked it 6hrs at 225 in a dutch oven. Know one here at my house liked it. I think it was the thyme in the recipe that gave it a funny taste. super disappointed because it had so many good reviews. It was super tender, pulled apart easily and smelled ok. It just had a real distinct flavor and didn't taste like any pulled pork i ever had which is alot living here in texas.

My supermarket didn't have any pork butt so I bought a pork loin. Everything else was exactly as written but I was still nervous. It ended up great, not quite "pulled" but still delicious. I served it on a toasted bun and cabbage slaw with banana peppers. My husband added extra sauce from the roast, extra BBQ sauce and cheese but I had mine with just the slaw. I will make this again but hopefully with the butt like suggested.
Slaw: 2 cups shredded purple cabbage (thinner the better), 2 tbsp white vinegar, mayo, minced onion, 1 clove garlic, 2 tsp sugar, salt and pepper.

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was easy to put together and the meat was very tender.  Just needed some extra barbecue sauce put on the finished sandwich product.

This recipe sounds promising! I am making it right now in my pressure cooker, as my slow cooker cracked. We're moving, so I  am hoping this will be an easy quick reheat meal that we can just eat on paper plates until all the moving is done. I mixed the sauce ingredients up then poured over the meat. It seemed simpler that way. It's cooking now and smells amazing!

This is the best pulled pork ever. Super easy, and everyone loves it. I have made it 3 times in the last few months. I actually get a craving for it. I also have used this sauce recipe as a marinade for brisket. I have a small crock pot, so I cut a 4lb. shoulder in half, freeze the other half to make later. I make the full recipe other than that, and just let it go all day. It makes enough for the 3 of us to eat for supper, and leftovers for the next day.

I made this today in our new slow cooker. My husband loves pulled pork sandwiches. He said this was the best he ever had. I did not modify the recipe and it came out perfectly. We will be making this one again!

Made recipe per directions.  Came out great!  Even my picky eater loved it.  I used the idea suggested by another post to freeze extra servings in individual portions(I filled small glass custard cups).  Since there are only 3 of us at home right now, I also had enough for another meal which I am going to serve over rice.

This was a big hit with family! The added chili powder was a wow factor! However, if you have 'hot sensitive' people in the family, you should use less chili in the recipe.

Would give 5 stars with the following tip. I made this the day before a party and it tasted dry. I drained most of the liquid then added sweet baby rays and placed in the fridge overnight. Reheated the next day it was moist and awesome!

This was okay, it was too vinegary for my taste, next time I will only add 1-2 tbs of vinegar and double the bbq sauce.  I like my bbq much thicker.  Thanks for a base to start with.

Overall the taste was just not there.  I had to add seasoning at the end for some flavor in the soupy sauce.  I'll stick with my hawaiian version of pulled pork.

Delicious!  Full of flavor...the pork fell off the bone...I put the
pork in the crock pot in the morning and by dinner time it was ready
to serve.  Couldn't have been easier.

We've made this recipe multiple times in the past few months and my family loves it! The few things I've done differently are: I mixed all of the ingredients (except the pork and oil) together and poured that over the pork, I have added some Penzey' s spices to the mix and I shred the pork right in the crockpot. One less thing to wash.

First attempt at pulled pork!  It was very good, will definitely make again.  2 small complaints.. was a little too sweet, and a little too watery.  Will try some others advice of adding a little liquid smoke, less sugar, and perhaps a little cornstarch to thicken.  But really, tasted as good as any restaurant's!

This recipe is outstanding. I doubted using it because I have a wonderful slow cooker pulled pork recipe and I wasn't sure I wanted to try another one. So glad I did. I served it for a 4th of July supper for friends and it was a big hit.

Made this yesterday and it was AWSOME!  Tweaked it just a bit by substituting beer for the stock and Splenda brown sugar substitute.  I also stirred a tablespoon of corn starch into the juices to thicken just a bit.  This is without a doubt, the best pulled pork I've ever had.  WONDERFUL!!

Made the recipe but used a 6 pound roast and made 1 1/2 times the ingrediants for the sauce. Next time I think I'll just use a single recipe of the sauce. The flavor was great,(better the second day) but there was way too much liquid and it just turned out too runny. Will definately make it again, also with a little less thyme.

Excellent! To make it gluten free, I used HP sauce instead of Worcestershire. I had ran out of chili powder so I used 1tsp. ground  chipotle pepper which gave it a mildly spicy kick. It was yummy with coleslaw on one half of the bun. 
Definitely will make this a favorite.

I used an 8lb pork butt, cooked on low for 10 hours in a crockpot (overnight). It was amazing!!!! Doubled everything except the thyme which I only added slightly more. It was too much. Leaving the thyme off would make this taste even better but that is just our preference.

Thanks for sharing this recipe--it was a hit on the 4th of July! I doubled the recipe for a 5.4 lb roast and made a rub out of the brown sugar, yellow mustard, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, garlic and thyme. I then seared the roast in the oven at 420F for 30 minutes. I used the same measurements above for the vegetable oil, vinegar, and onion but substituted more chicken broth for BBQ (I like adding it individually) and cooked on high in the slow cooker for 5 hours. A+++

I liked it and everyone seemed to enjoy it; however I used a 4lb pork roast in a crock pot for 5 hours on high and i felt the meat was a little dry tasting, maybe I need to check this about 4 hrs? Maybe cook it slower on low heat for 6 or seven hrs.( any suggestions)

Made for 4th of July gathering and it was a hit.I made a 6 lbs. shoulder and adjusted the recipe.I would omit chicken broth next time. It had too much liquid when I took out pork to shred.That is when I added honey chipotle barbecue sauce to give it more heat and flavor. Will make again, Maria.

Made this for a Fourth of July dinner.  Was very good but I did add a little honey to the sauce in the end.  Also, because sauce was a little thin,  I thickened it with potato flakes.  Was enjoyed by all

This is far the best pulled pork ever! I used a lean
cut (pork sirloin tip roast) so there was no waste or fat. Also, we 
served cole slaw right on the sandwiches.  I will try this for beef and 
chicken sometime and just alter the spices. Great recipe!

Having friends from out of state and I made this pulled pork recipe in my crock pot.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was very easy.  The only thing is that I sired for a minute or 2 on each side before placing the meat into the rock pot. I also made the sauce the night before and placed in a mason jar in the refrigerator  to allow the flavors to blend.  I put this in the crock pot and we went out for brunch and took a leisurely drive in the country.  Came back to a wonderful smell of BBQ throughout the house.  We had this for dinner on toasted buns and also had cole slaw on the side.  We, along with our guest enjoyed it and they insisted on the recipe.  Loved it! I'd rate this a 5.

I've used other recipes for Pulled Pork sandwich and it was easy and great. This one I tried seems got me way too much liquid and too diluted taste. I have to painstakingly taken out the bits of chopped onion and garlic, as my family don't really like them in there. I also have to add more BBQ sauce at the end to get the taste right. Will go back and find my other recipe in the future for pulled pork.

This was a delicious pulled pork recipe and was so easy.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I thought there was a little too much liquid to put the shredded pork back into.  Next time I would remove some of the cooked liquid before returning the pork back into the cooker.

Followed the recipe to a T as well, however it was way to sweet for me, if I where to make this again I would leave out the thyme, didn't care for the flavor it gave. Guess I'm old school and like BBQ pulled pork.

This recipe is so easy! Not too many steps/ingredients, and AMAZING results. My husband and I couldn't wait to try this one out for our friends and family. Big hit! You can spice it up by adding some home made pickled jalapeños to your sandwich when ready to serve.  This will definitely be added to my regular lexicon.

Found this recipe a few weeks ago, and decided to use it as the 'test' for the slow cooker my husband bought at least 8 years ago!  The only change I made to the recipe was to add some liquid smoke -- and the resultant sandwiches were excellent.  Was so thrilled with the performance of the slow cooker that the next week I made a slow cooker ranch chicken recipe from this site -- really yummy too!

I made this for my family, it was easy and they loved it so much. I cooked on High for 5 hours it was perfect.  Now I put to much butter on the buns, so they fell apart and we had to eat with forks.  Next time I will toast them in the toaster and omit the butter and frying them in the pan.  You must try this......

The flavor was pretty good, but the sauce ended up just being too runny! Pretty much water consistency by the time it all cooked down. I like mine with a little more BBQ sauce flavor, personally.

This was okay after the slow cooker, but it was really good after heating it up a second time - needs more time for the flavors to meld.

Nice recipe.  Never realized how much work it takes to make pulled pork; this definitely helped put that in perspective.  Also, even 2.5 pounds has made me around 10 sandwiches worth, so keep that in mind when buying the pork shoulder.

My husband can't stop talking about this! It was really good and I made it just as it's stated. Mine was shred-able in 6 hours for a nearly 4 lb roast. Thanks for the recipe. I was looking for one that didn't just ask for a bottle of bbq sauce thrown on top and this was perfect.

I  'd never made pulled pork before I tried this recipe. Now it has become one of my families favorites. I like to start this early in the day when I 'm going to be busy. Thanks for  another great recipe!

This totally hit the spot.  I omitted the thyme and used some chipotle mustard I had on hand instead of the prepared mustard. I used a 3 1/2 LB pork butt and had it on low (10 hour setting on the crock pot) for about 8 hours. I'll add either some salt or more vinegar next time but the overall taste was great!.  The consistency of the sauce was perfect.  I strained some to use to dip our sandwiches in. I would definitely make this again.

So delicious!!  My pork roast was too big for my crockpot so I put it in a roaster at 175 overnight.  I added whole cumin seeds and skipped the chicken broth.  Thankfully we have a lot of leftovers in the freezer....  We'll be enjoying this again and again!

I loved it!  My picky teen who complains about everything gobbled it up.  Not a complaint from her at all.  Excellent and will make over again & again.  I am not the type to give 5 stars unless deserved.  This is, without a doubt, worthy of this rating!

This is delicious!  I followed it exactly, except I didn't have any thyme. I probably wouldn't have used it though, it is not my favorite spice.  It is a delicious, easy recipe!  Was great served on warmed buns and will use it again!

We made this for my daughter's first birthday party...I was told it was tasty by the guests but it just wasn't hitting the spot for me.  It almost had too much of a vinegary taste.  Love pulled pork sandwiches, maybe it needed just the simple bbq sauce and brown sugar! My husband liked it though.

This recipe was amazing!! First i used 2 lbs. skinless and boneless chops because I only have to feed me and my husband, so I halved the recipe but kept 1 cup of BBQ sauce. Before I shredded the pork I drained the juice into a bowl. I put the shredded pork in the crock pot and poured the juice back over until it was the concistancy I wanted. (I was afraid from the other comments it'd be too soupy) It turned out great and my husband really enjoyed it. One of the other firefighters asked for the recipe as I always have to feed at least one of them :)

I've tried this recipe a few years ago and it's been one of our favorite meals.  My kids loved it and keep asking me to make more.  We just had some last night!!!  The only thing I changed was that I used my own BBQ sauce and add a few drops of Mesquite liquid smoke.

I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce.  I find it too rich and sweet, and find it overpowers other flavors.  But I am a fan of a good pulled pork sandwich, and this recipe provided the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had.  I used Sweet Baby Rays Chipotle BBQ sauce. The meat was moist and delicious, no BBQ on the side required.  The apple cider vinegar makes every bite amazing!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good. I did make some minor changes. We don't eat pork, so I used a cheap beef roast. I used italian seasoning instead of thyme, and chipotle chili powder. As well I had a beer on hand and used the instead of chicken stock. It was a little spicy for the kids, but they eat some it anyhow. Next time I will cut down the chili powder a bit. Also needed to cook for a full 6 hours on high. I also had to keep adding water to it. Enjoy!

This was the first time I've ever made pulled pork, and I'm telling you it was amazing! The best pulled pork I've ever eaten. Mine was just under 4 lbs. Left it in the slow cooker for about 5 hours on high. It just fell apart. After shredding the meat, we only added some of the liquid back in and mixed in more of the BBQ sauce. Served with grilled Texas toast and potato salad. I'm so proud of how it turned out, and this recipe will be a staple for me now!

PERFECT. First time my husband would try a recipe.  He admitted it was better than anything he made in the past.  I have been told to use only Allrecipe from now on.  (I did not tell him that I have been using this site for several years.)  I just told him "Yes Dear".

Recipe created too much liquid.  As other reviewers stated, I eliminated the broth and thyme and used dry mustard.  Also I cooked it at 10 hours and pulled the roast out 1 hour before serving, pulled apart, and put back in crock pot to simmer in the juices.  The taste was good but swimming in too much liquid.  Need to adjust it and will try it one more time.  ( I was cooking a 4.5 lb roast)

Although there were no rants and raves, I think it came out good. Very tender.  I used a lot more BBQ sauce than it called for though. 3/4 of a bottle to cook it and then another cup mixed in after shredding it.  I would use this recipe again though.

I used a 5 lb pork roast and, with all the liquid, you can get away with using a bigger piece of meat (6-7 lbs) with the same proportions for the remaining ingredients in the recipe.  I added the onions and garlic to the bottom of the cooker and mixed the liquids together in a bowl before pouring over the roast.  I'd cut the brown sugar down in half (a bit too sweet).  I also used black pepper liberally over the roast.  We have never had pulled pork before today (Super Bowl Sunday) and it will be a great recipe for serving a crowd.

Followed this exactly and it was out of this world good!  I had a ton of leftovers and used them to make pulled pork enchiladas later in the week and those were even better.  This is going to become a staple in my house.  Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe! I followed it exactly, but added a couple drops of liquid smoke as per a few other reviewers suggestions, and it turned out perfect! I'll try it without liquid smoke next time to see if it really makes a difference, but I'm sure it's delicious either way

This was amazing-I had everything in the house already except the thyme, which I left out and I cut back on the chili powder so it wouldn't be too spicy for my young daughters. My whole family loved it!!!

I love this recipe. It is the only recipe I'll use for making pulled pork. I use a bone in pork shoulder roast and it comes out so tender and juicy it just falls off the bone. I also don't add sauce on top of the sandwich. I put some provolone or swiss cheese on it and broil for a couple of minutes. Nothing crazy but it's my favorite sandwich EVER!

soooo delicious! i made a pulled pork poutine out of this instead of the burgers the recipe recommends - just put some french fries in the oven, then grate mozzarella cheese on top of them when they're done & pile some of the pulled pork on top of that! this recipe makes A LOT & there was also a lot of juice left over in my slow cooker that i had to dispose of.

Loved it! Used a 4lb pork butt roast, and it came out perfect. Didn't have garlic cloves, so I used 2 tsp garlic powder. And left out the mustard, and after it was all done cooked pulled apart I added another cup of bbq. Delicious! Thank you, was a great hit for our New Year's Eve!

this was really good and easy, I seared the roast in a skillet and left out the oil. I mixed all ingredients together, and added liquid smoke, bay leaf & soy sauce. I put a layer of onion on the bottom of crock pot, put roast on top then poured the  concotion on top, cooked on low all day, it was tender, juicy and flavorfull. Thank you.

LITTLE TOO SWEET. I accidently bought Honey BBQ Sauce... I'm not sure if that's what caused it too be too sweet. Next time I will try regular sauce and possibly less brown sugar.. Other than that it was delicous!

I used this receipe because I was out of the mix that I normally use and all I can say is WOW!!!! I made a couple slight changes (no onions or garlic but I used a little garlic powder & a dash of onion salt.) The was the best BBQ pulled pork I have ever made. Oh and I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

Good, but a little dry.  However, I expect my crock pot runs hot as I have had trouble with it before.  Take my review with a grain of salt!

I get great compliments on my pulled pork, and I have used several different recipes- this one is good. I mixed all the ingredients before adding them to the pot. The pork roasts I have used lately are on the fatty side, and since I live in a very rural area, I buy what I can get. Anyhow, I refrigerate the crock pot after the cooking process (usually overnite) to make sure I can get most of the fat out of the meat when I shred it, as well as the layer of fats congealed on the top of the juices. Makes for a much leaner, richer tasting sandwich filling. Toasting the inside of the buns in a skillet makes a world of difference as well. This is an ez ez crowd pleaser.

I thought this recipe was pretty tasty, but like other reviewers, my sauce came out a little bit too thin also. After reading hallshire's review, I dissolved 2 TBS of cornstarch in a small bowl with 1 TBS apple cider as suggested and then dumped it into the sauce once the pork was removed. This did help to thicken up the sauce a lot; yet it still didn't look like the main picture. Maybe this was because I put the shredded pork back into the sauce as stated in the recipe, rather than just spooning it on? I think next time when I take the pork out to be shredded, I will still use hallshire's suggestion, but I will drain half of the liquid out first before adding the corn starch/vinegar mixture. I think I might also spoon the sauce over the pork, instead of dumping the pork back into the sauce so that I can control the amount and not have it be as "soupy". Still a delicious dish and highly recommended! To me this sauce is way more tastier than bottled barbeque sauce.

I made this exactly by the recipe and it turned out pretty good.  One thing I changed was after shredding the pork I did not put it back in the crock pot with all the juice.  Instead I spooned some of the juice over all the meat and let it marinate in that over night in the fridge.  The next day I heated the meat and poured heated barbecue sauce over it.  It tasted wonderful and everyone loved it!!

Delicious! Omited the oil at the beginning. Used leftovers to make fried rice the following night and something similar to a Korean bulgogi the 3rd night.  Everyone from my 2.5 yr old to my hubby loved it.

This is one of the best pulled pork recipes I've tried. It's so easy to make, the meat just falls apart and has a wonderful flavor.  I think the thyme really adds some pizazz to it.   My husband loves it as well. We've already had it 3 times in the last month!

This was very flavorful. I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and added much more cayenne because my husband and I enjoy spicy food, although it still wasn't very spicy. Topped it with coleslaw and it was AMAZING...It was a bit liquidy but that was my own fault. Had I trimmed the fat prior to cooking I don't think I would have run into that problem, but I suppose a bit more barbecue sauce would help too. Great recipe!!

This recipe created a tasty tender meat. We melted cheddar over the meat for added Flavor.

Great and easy recipe. I used the lowest carb buns I could find and didn't butter them.

I did not care for this recipe. Had very little taste. I like pulled pork with more BBQ flavor. It was very tender though.

Excellent pulled pork recipe. Prepared as directed with no changes. I did use Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, also cooked on low for 10 hours.  Next time I may add Cayenne pepper or crushed red pepper flakes - not for everyone, but I like extra heat.

It was good blend of flavours, the only thing I would change is adding salt. Noticed many reviews said the sauce was too watery - I usually set all the sauce aside and add it to the shredded pork until I have the right consistency. I've tried 4 or 5 different pulled pork recipes in the last little while and this is the one I will stick to for a while.  Delicious served on a bun with coleslaw on top and great as leftovers.  Will make again.  Thank you.

The recipe was good but next time I would leave out the thyme.  It kind of overpowered the flavor of the meat.  The pork came out real tender and hopefully next time when I leave the thyme out it will taste much better.

This is absolutely my go-to recipe for pulled pork from now on. Scrumptious!!! DH agrees. Now we'll see how our guests react this evening. I cooked this yesteday afternoon and refrigerated it overnight. Of course I had to taste test it occasionally for tenderness and flavor and definitely was not disappointed. I'm going to heat it up, shred the meat and hope that time really flies until dinner-time! I would like to cook this once a week, but I'm afraid that would be overkill. I may cook seveal pork shoulders and freeze the shredded meat in muffin tins to have on hand for unexpected guests or occasions. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent recipe - my family asks for this one regularly! The only thing I change is using onion powder, because onions and I don't get along, and cutting down on the brown sugar slightly and using a tablespoon of honey in its place. Oh, and adding a bit of fresh ground pepper. :) (In addition, if you're not a fan of thyme, you can about halve this and it's still fine. You can't leave it out though - some is still needed. :) ) Definitely five stars!

This recipe had way too much of a vinegar flavor.  I should have caught this before hand but 1/2 cup vinegar with only 1 cup of BBQ sauce was too strong.  I had to add more BBQ Sauce, sugar and some lemon juice to balance the acidity.  I also like spicy BBQ sauce so I added some red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper to taste.  Never really got rid of too much vinegar.  Could have easily done 1/4 cup or less.

Big hit at our Super Bowl party! I substituted pork loin for the shoulder roast which is a leaner cut of pork and cooked for 2 hours longer due to the lack of fat in the loin cut.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent!  I don't have a variation just yet but probably will not need it!  It's so full of flavor without being too overwhelming with bbq sauce. My only change was to cut the onion in larger pieces which was a GREAT idea.  My husband loved them as much as the pork!  They were almost like eating candy!

I made this recipe for a family BBQ and used about 7lbs of pork butt instead of pork shoulder because the shoulder had skin and I didn't want to go through the trouble to trim it. When the meat is done, it is tender and juicy--I would definitely use the pork butt cut again. I also served with a side of BBQ sauce and asian coleslaw. Everyone loved the dish and wanted a recipe! Can't wait to make this for the next party!

I used Yakisoba sauce in place of the worchestershire sauce and left out the onions.  I used Cayenne instead of chili pepper.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

This was so easy, and really good! I doubled it and froze half. I had to drain it because it was so juicy. Delicious. My kids loved it, too!

First time making pulled pork.  I used a 2 1/2 lb boneless pork roast, cooked for 5 hrs on high, shredded and cooked for another 3 hours in the sauce on low.  Was really good.  No Baby Rays sauce in Canada so used Diane's Honey Garlic!

Perfect the first time.  I used this with a 3 lb pork shoulder roast.  One of the best barbecue sandwiches I ever had.  Served on kaiser rolls.

First time I ever made any kind of pulled pork. It turned out awesome and everyone couldn't believe I made it. Great recipe and so easy. I had everything on hand. Only had to buy the pork & buns to plan the meal.

I loves this recipe.  First time I tried to make pulled pork and will be making it again.  I may tailor it more for me but what a great jumping off point.  You can't customize something unless it starts off great.

Very good pulled pork.  I did not place the pork back in the cooking juice.  Once it was pulled, i tossed it with some good BBQ sauce and warmed in the oven or on top of the stove.

This was so simple and delicious. As I was smelling it the thyme was a little over pouring so I added some honey to sweeten it up a little. I will definitely make this again but with 3/4 of a tsp thyme!

I was so disappointed in this recipe. I made it Memorial Day weekend for a house full of people. I followed it exactly and it smelled delicious while it was cooking. While my guests and I thought it was ok, it was way too bland and the flavors just weren't quite right. It was also a little soupy so I left the top off the slow cooker to thicken things a bit which only helped a little. I lived in the South for many years so maybe I was expecting something different but I definitely won't try this recipe again.

This came out better than expected.  My husband is very picky and he actually told me it was good and he would have it again.  I loved all the flavors, it was so tender, very tasty.  Only one who didn't like it was my 10 year old son, he said it was too sweet for him...go figure

I made this for a small group at church.  I got RAVE reviews.  I doubled it, making an 8lb pork shoulder and there was barely any left.  Very easy to throw together in the crock pot and just forget.  YUM!

Meat turned out great, sauce was spicy and sweet, tangy just like I like it!  I will however make one adjustment next time I make this recipe: The garlic will be omitted. I don't know if it was my garlic, but two clovers was just too much and this garlicky taste doesn't mix well with the wonderful, smoky barbecue flavors rendered by the other ingredients in the recipe.  Oh, and I also added some liquid smoke. Tastes great.

This was really good - incredibly tender, good flavor.  I made as directed except for the chili powder.  I used half as much because I was afraid it would be too spicy for us - next time I will definitely use it all.  Definitely a keeper - going to use the leftovers in taquitos tomorrow!

BEST bbq pork I've ever tasted! I followed this recipe exactly EXCEPT I left out the onion because I didn't have one. It doesn't have a very strong BBQ sauce flavor at all, it just has a really great sweet and spicy flavor. I used a bbq sauce with a bit of a spicy kick.. it turned out FABULOUS! I definitey will make this again.

So delicious!  I used a pork tenderloin instead of pork roast and it fell apart!  I've gotten rave reviews, picky eaters devoured it and it is just as good, if not better, the next day.

I love this recipe, and it is very easy to make. I let it cook for 10 hours on low and add 3-4 cloves of garlic. I think the amount of liquid is too much for a 4 lb roast, so I recommend about 6 lb of meat for the same mix of sauce. Excellent flavor.

awesome!  Made this recipe for the first time two weeks ago - followed the recipes exactly and my 2 teenage boys loved every morsel.  The wonderful aroma drove the entire family crazy all day while it was cooking - including the dog.  The recipe is coming out again tomorrow for Super Bowl Sunday.  Go Vikings - oh wait, they aren't playing!

I unfortunately did not like the flavor of this pulled pork. It was easy enough to put together - and I followed the directions exactly - except that I used 8 thick pork chops instead of a roast. I cooked them for 4 1/2 hours on high and they fell apart. The flavor was very...pungent. I took the pork out of the crock pot, shredded it, added just a little of the sauce back to it (pureed to take out the chunky texture of the onions), drained the rest of the sauce out of the crock pot, put the pork back in the crock pot and put my favorite BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's Original) back in. So, I was able to save it, but as written, I didn't like this recipe.

This turned out fantastic!!! I used a Boston Butt, since it was on sale at our local market. Pork was so tender and flavorful. I didn't realize till I started cooking that I didn't have worcestershire sause but it still turned out great. I thickened some of the sauce and drizzled it on the sandwiches. Everyone in the family loved it. An absolute keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing Catherine!

Very good flavor! Family all loved it! Thanks, I'll be making this again. But, next time I'll be sure to remember to trim the fat off and omit the chicken broth. There was so much liquid in the pot that I'll just add a bouillon cube instead.

I made this according to the recipe with the exception of deleting Thyme and adding 1 tbs hot sauce, and a couple dashes of liquid smoke.  I whisked all the ingredients toghether. Then I put the pork in the slow cooker, chopped onion on top, and poured the mixture over it.  It was fantastic. This is the best pulled pork recipe that I've tried yet.

Really good version of traditional, Southern BBQ Pulled Pork. Just a few tweaks: used a whole bottle of bbq sauce; used sweet vidalia and; added pepper to taste. Buttering the buns is a definite do! Y-U-M! Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe....perfect blance of sause for pulled pork sandwiches.  Ommitted one star because it was a little sweeter than I typically like, but with a few changes, I'm sure I can find the right balance...but my husband thought it was great and asked me to save the recipe

Made this for a New Year's Day celebration with my extended family and it was a hit! Even the kids asked for seconds. Followed the recipe except left out the BBQ sauce and allowed people to add it to their own sandwiches at the end. Yummy!!

This came out very greasy and bland in my opinion.  I would not make it again.

Pretty tastey for slow-cooker style, but I think I just prefer barbecue style pulled pork.  I will make this recipe every time I make it inside the house though!

I would give this 3.5 stars ... it was good and I enjoyed the leftovers for a couple of days. Great for a fast dinner by just reheating.  Next time, I would pull some of the juices out of the crock pot and add quite a bit more BBQ sauce at the end. The recipe was good, but BBQy enough, in my opinion.

This was a good and easy recipe.  It was a little tangy for my liking but my husband and 2 kids loved it! I did everything the recipe called for except add the oil and garlic. I let it cook for 6 hours before shredding. Everybody went back for seconds!

I followed this recipe to the T, and it was ok. Next time I make it, I'll make my own changes because the thyme was overpowering.

This recipe is wonderful!  I trimmed two pork loin roasts and cut into 3 peices each.  Salt, peppered and coat with BBQ dry rub and placed in fridge overnight.  Also the night before I made mainade only omitted mustard, chili powder and brown sugar.  Then added 1/2 cup honey and 1 can of chipolte peppers (sauce included).  Through it all in the crockpot in the morning.  Cooked 9 hours, shredded and cooked another hour.
