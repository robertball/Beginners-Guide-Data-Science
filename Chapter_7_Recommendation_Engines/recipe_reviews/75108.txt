Made  and assembled the french bread & rasberry/cream cheese the night before and put in refrig.  Also made egg mixture the night before, then in morning just heated griddle and dipped bread in egg mixture and browned on both sides, stayed together and was very tasty.  We love cinammon but 2TBLS was too much, next time I will use 2teas.  also I used 9 oz. rasberry to 8 oz. cream cheese and this was very tasty.

I used this recipe to help me re-create an amazing stuffed french toast I had at a brunch with friends. I used a disposable pastry bag to apply the raspberry/cheese mixture, which made things a lot easier.
In place of the confectioner's sugar,I made an irresistable topping using 1/2 C Oats, 1/2 C brown sugar, 1 C chopped pecans and 3 TBSP honey. Spread evenly over the slices and baked at suggested temp and time. RAVE reviews!!

So good and though I didn't need to change a thing I did replace half of the milk with orange juice on my second try - added a nice twist. Thanks!

So-o-o-o-o good ladyhen76!  My husband (who does not generally like breakfast) loved this, and so did my 8 children!  A nice change from traditional french toast.  I did use half the sugar, then topped with whipped cream!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Make the cream cheese the night before so you can have a nice and quick breakfast the next morning.  I used raspberry sauce from the white chocolate raspberry sauce recipe on this site and it was delicious.

Way too much of almost everything!  My family would not even eat it.  Way too much cinnamon and I love cinnamon.  The middle does not cook and is soggy.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was still too much.  The idea is good but I would take a regular french toast recipe and add a Little vanilla, cinnamon and sugar at best.

I also owned a B&B and came across this recipe about 6 years ago. It is so easy and yet so good. I sliced the french bread a little thicker  and then made a slit to stuff the cheese into the pocket. Everyone loved it.

The only change I made was using half brown sugar and half white. I found there to be an excess of both the egg mixture and the raspberry mixture, but then maybe my loaf of French bread was smaller, I don't know. We came up with 7 'sandwiches' from it. Still, excess aside, this was delicious. I wouldn't eat it all the time (can only take that much sweetness here and there), but it's definitely a lot more fun to make this yourself and not have to go to ihop.

For taste, the recipe is sublime, but probably unnecessarily sugary.

I used reduced-fat cream cheese and sugar-free strawberry jam in place of the raspberry puree. I also reduced the amount of sugar a little in the batter. After making the recipe once, here are the suggestions I would make:

1) Use reduced-fat or fat-free cream cheese.
2) Use sugar-free jelly.
3) WAY reduce the amount of sugar, probably at least in half, or skip it altogether. Next time I'll probably skip the sugar in the batter and just top with berries and powdered sugar instead. While the original recipe is quite scrumptious, it's absolutely way too sugary for a breakfast food. And that's coming from someone like me with a huge sweet tooth!

I made this with the Amish White Bread (recipe on site) and it was, all-around, a delicious meal, but I hit the gym afterwards because it is definitely not at all healthy.

DELICIOUS!!! I used blueberry preserves in place of raspberry puree (quicker and cheaper). You do not need a whole cup if you do this. I also used a loaf of italian bread and cut it myself (makes a bigger portion), but the french bread is good too. This french toast is to die for! The smell alone is delicious!

This was a huge hit for me on Valentine's Day.  I didn't have raspberry puree so I did use fresh raspberries instead. I mashed them up quite a bit on put them on the skillet with some brown sugar. Then I mixed them into the filling.  I also used some heavy cream with the milk because I like the thick and fatty stuff :)

Very nice recipe, and the partner gave rave reviews.

This recipe is so wrong on many levels. 1 cup of sugar what for???
This is how I make stuffed french toast:

filling: 1 8oz pkg light cream cheese beaten with 2-4 tbsps chunky thick jam I love apricot at Christmas I use finely chopped cranberries
egg mixture: 4 eggs, 1 cup milk, whole milk makes it creamier but I do use skim, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon, whip together until foamy

I use whole wheat bread, 12 to 16 slices to make 6 to 8 sandwiches depending how much filling you put in each, challah is excellent too as is raisin bread.

make sandwiches with the filling, dip into egg mixture on both sides and place in a large pan or tupperware container, if egg mixture is left over I pour over top the sandwiches, cover and refrigerate overnight.

The next morning preheat frying pan or griddle and cook approximately 3-5 minutes per side until golden brown.

serve with maple syrup or fruit puree.

Made for Mother's Day brunch.  I used a panini maker to knock them out.  I had extra Rasberries and Puree so just put them on the table.  Very nice new flavor and twist on French toast.

I used the reviews from this recipe to make my stuffed french toast for the first time. I would definitely use the 8oz cream cheese to 9oz raspberry mix. I also had problems finding "seedless raspberry". So I just used Red Raspberry Preserves (that had the seeds).It was still really good and I was not bothered by the seeds at all! Also a huge TIP: BUTTERFLY EACH SLICE OF BREAD THAT MAKES IT VERY EASY TO FILL, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LINING UP THE BREAD...IT WORKED GREAT!

Wonderful!  Served this for Christmas breakfast with a variety of toppings (powdered sugar, nutmeg, whipped cream, syrup).  The favorite combo was whipped cream and nutmeg on top.  I also subbed reduced fat cream cheese without anyone noticing and stored the sauce in a small ziplock bag - then cut a small tip and piped into bread pockets on Christmas morning.  Thanks for a great special occasion recipe!

This was good, not great. I don't like how the cream cheese was mixed with the raspberry puree. I sorta prefer when you can appreciate each separately. I think this would've been better if you put cream cheese on one side of bread and the puree on the other. I recommend putting sugar in the puree, not the egg/milk mixture. We enjoyed this nonetheless.

Very good.  My husband and I made this on a Saturday morning instead of going out for breakfast.  I used half the sugar and used whole wheat bread and used strawberry preserves.  Would make it again!

This recipe was okay.  My family ate it but it was nothing special, kinda bland and nothing I'd make again.  The toast didn't stay together after it was cooked.  I did use fat-free cream cheese instead of regular.

the filling mixture is also way too sweet.  1 oz cream cheese/2 TBL of raspberry preserve is perfect.

Very yummy.  We all loved it, even my 2-year old. I also substituted 1/2 cup OJ for 1/2 cup milk, but didn't really taste it.  And there was ALOT of leftover filling and egg mixture, but we're freezing the filling to make it again.  Probably will reduce the egg mixture next time and add some orange liquor or extract to increase the orange taste.  I thought about sweetening the filling next time.  My husband says no, to leave it as is.  I guess it depends on how much of  sweet tooth you have.

Much easier than I imagined.  I used fresh peaches and mixed them with the cream cheese and a bit of Splenda.

I made this for Father's Day for my husband, myself and kids. I followed the recipe exactly, except that the store didn't have French Bread, so I used Italian bread, which worked beautifully. I put the cream cheese mixture on half the bread and folded it in half.   This was AWESOME! For anyone who says that it's "too sweet"... I don't think it's too sweet at all. It's as sweet as I expected something made with sugar and stuffed with raspberry would be.   EVERYONE loved it! If you like IHOP's version of stuffed french toast, this is even better. :)

These were delicious and so simple to make!  My boyfriend told me I should start my own I-Hop!  The only thing different was that I used strawberry preserves instead of raspberry puree because honestly, I'm not quite sure what puree is or where to find it.  I bought one of the really long french loaves at the store, and have made 6 yesterday, 3 today, and have enough for more tomorrow!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was good, don't get me wrong.  But I wouldn't make it again the idea is way better than the outcome.  I don't like french toast on french bread, first of all.  I know this review is a little vague, because the IDEA is so good.  Just didn't turn out like the idea in my head.  Hence three stars.

Great change from the usual. I really liked what was added to my normal egg and milk batter. But I couldn't get a good texture from the raspberry cream cheese.

Very Good Recipe, especially after using some of the reviews to improve it.  I used only 3 eggs and about 1/4 cup of milk, and I left the sugar out of the mix completely.  I only used a pinch of cinnamon.  Instead of using 2 seperate slices of bread and sandwiching the filling, I cut 2 inch sections and "butterflied" like I would if i were going to stuff a pork chop (easiest way to explain it).  It worked really well, but next time I think I will cut 1.5 inch sections of bread, they were a little thick.

I've been eyeing this for a while and I finally had the opportunity to try it this morning to make a special breakfast for my bf. I halved the recipe except for the cream cheese - would do it again (the cream cheese stuff is delicious). I didn't have french bread so I took slices of regular wheat bread and folded them in half around the filling. Nothing fell apart, they soaked up the batter well, and they cooked through just fine! If you do this method, though, make sure not to oversoak or you'll get a gooey mess--but as always with french toast, you don't want to undersoak either.

This had such potential.  The thought of rasberry cheesecake on toast sounds amazing, but all I got was a soggy, gooey mess.

Really good.  The outside gets a little carmelized, probably from all the sugar in it.  I used day old portugese sweet bread from this website.

These were very heavy, very different and yummy.  I found I didn't need quite as much cream cheese and used challah bread cut in 1 inch slices.

I have not tried this recipe, yet! But as I was thinking about, you could actually make any kind of purée for this, strawberry blueberry blackberry! I figured it would have the same outcome! So if you you don't like raspberry make it with something else!

This was sooo good. We used about a third cup of fresh raspberrys w/ 1/2 of the cream cheese block. We used one less egg, and still had way too much leftover. IT was GREAT though!!!!!!!!! We loved it!

Really good recipe, but I'm confused as to the instructions.  You're supposed to cut the loaf into 1" slices and then cut each slice in half.  I thought this might be very difficult to do and couldn't see the point.  Why not just cut the bread into 1/2" slices in the first place?  Then I read ROBYNBNB's suggestion of just cutting a slit into the 1' slices and filling it with the mixture.  That made a whole lot more sense to me and it worked wonderfully! Thanks for a great recipe and great suggestions to make it better!

I would give this recipe a four an a half if available, but from what I've tasted I'm going with the lower. Today is my second time making them, first time tasting. The first one was soggy, so I had to be careful with the heat. After turning it down, sides still got burnt cause frankly I suck at french toast. The taste for me, using homemade strawberry freezer jam an cream cheese from the tub was lacking. Didn't love it. My brother, however, ate at least three [[sandwhiches]]. I take it he enjoyed it =) Thank you for this novel twist on french toast

This is the best french toast I have ever had!  As Amy said, this beats IHOP's stuffed french toast hands down.  I made this recipe with the "French Bread" recipe submitted by Janet Vink, and my own homemade strawberry jam.  As others suggested, I prepared the filling and egg mixtures in advance, which was a great idea.  It turned out perfect.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This french toast is so wrong, but sooo good!  Instead of raspberry puree I just used a little less than a cup of raspberry jam & it was really good.  Cut up a loaf of Italian bread I had sitting around & used that to make this for brunch today; it was VERY well recieved.  I did cup the white sugar down to 1/2 a cup & also sprinkled some nutmeg into the milk/egg mixture.  Loved the end result, if I were to note anything it would be that I would like a little more cream cheese flavor next time.  :)  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!!

This was pretty good.  I had frozen raspberries which I defrosted.  When I was making my puree I think it got way to funny because when I mixed the 1 cup of raspberries with 4 oz of cream cheese it was runny.  I used the sauce to drizzle over the french toast.  I think texes toast would have been better.  I also would omit the sugar in the liquid dip, no need for it.

The best french toast I ever had! I used texas toast and instead cream cheese inside, I drizzled cream cheese icing on top. Perfect! I made it with a few different fruit filling, all were great. Thanks for the recipe =)

It sounded amazing, but it was just okay.  I think next time I'd recommend slicing the bread VERY thin... or just making regular french toast with this recipe and topping it with the filling.

This was awesome!  The only thing I did different was put 1 cup of caramel syrup instead of the raspberry and this was delicious!  My whole family loved it!
Thanks!

An awesome, easy breakfast!! Very rich and filling.  I made some adjustments to make it healthier and less sweet, otherwise it would've been too rich.  I used regular slices of whole wheat honey bread because that's what I had. I only used 1/3 cup of sugar, but I think I will cut down even more next time.  I used raspberry preserves because that is what I had.  I used 2 tsp. of cinnamon. I also used 3 eggs and 1/2 cup of egg substitute, and reduced fat cream cheese.  Everything turned out great and I had extra mix left over.  I'll definitely be making this again.

OMG.  My husband LOVED this.  We made it a bit more healthy by using fat-free cream cheese and a whole grain bread.  I think next time we may use egg beaters or mostly egg whites.  Make sure you leave the bread out overnight for the right consistency.  I would like a bit less cinnamon, but my husband liked it as is.

Absolutely delish!  I served it with maple syrup and raspberries mixed with bananas and a smidgen of whipped cream.  Finished off the meal with sausage, egg nog, coffee and orange juice.  Great Christmas breakfast!  Thanks!

I served this for a Christmas Brunch - it was incredible!  I made a few modifications to the recipe though, I cut amount of sugar in half, I used mixed berry puree instead of just raspberries.  It was delicious!

We liked this a lot.  I made it for Valentine's Day.  I used Raspberry Preserves.  But it really didn't feel "stuffed" to me.  However, it was VERY tastey anyhow.

This reads like a dessert rather than a breakfast food. Starting out your day with a heavy load of sugar is a good way to gain weight and set yourself up for a hard crash after the sugar high.
However, it would make a good dessert in small portions.

It was a really good recipe, tasted amazing, the only problem was when you were cooking it, it was pretty hard to tell if it was done or not because of all the cinnamon, but still a really great recipe.

Made the recipe as written and it turned out great.  Lots extra of the filling so we served it on the side and people loved the option of adding more or not.  I read the reviews that it was too sweet but we didn't find it so. But definitely a special occasion dish.

Excellent it was a hit with the whole family.  It was very filling I could not find raspberries fresh or frozen so I used cherries to make puree and it was excellent.  But 1 cup of sugar for serving for 6!!! really? no way. added no white sugar but about 2 tbs of honey and it was plenty sweet wont even do that next time.   Yes the center is soft so if you are texture averse to that this may not be the recipe for you.   We will make it again.

The egg mixture is spot on! Delish, even used it for regular French toast. When I made the stuffed version, I only had 1/4 of a block of cream cheese. I just added a heaping spoon of blueberry preserves and beat it with an electric mixer. The filling made three “sandwiches”. I used thick bread, so one was quite filling! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Tasted a lot of sugar, not really any other flavor. Cinnamon made the pieces come out looking too dark. The filling wasn’t anything impressive. Overall disappointed. I’ll stick to just my regular way of making French toast.

A new family favorite for special mornings!  I tried this for my family on Christmas morning and got rave reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used seedless raspberry preserves.  Delicious just as written.   So rich you almost didnt' need syrup. Next time adding a berry compote with a splash of Grand Marnier and whip cream as toppers might be fun.

I used slices of white bread since that's what i had on hand.  Added a  1/4  cup of heavy cream.  I also used strawberry preserves, and 8oz of cream cheese .  I used 1/2 cup of sugar. 
 Didn't really need syrup, unless you want a sugar high.  LOL

I have mixed feelings about this one. I had similar issues as some other reviewers: It was somewhat soggy and there was way too much cinnamon, so much so that a half hour after eating it, my throat was burning. I love cinnamon, but it was just too strong in this quantity. In addition, the cinnamon taste was competing too much with the raspberry filling. I think with less cinnamon, this would be a good dish. However, the reason I gave this recipe 4 stars, is because the next day, this was SO YUMMY. I'm not sure why, but the overpowering cinnamon taste was mostly gone and the overall consistency of the dish was so much better (not so soggy). Do yourself a favor...make this the night before, refrigerate, and heat up in the morning for a tasty breakfast.

What is the sense in cutting the french bread in 1 inch slices then cutting each slice in half ???
Just have the bakery cut bread in 1/2 inch slices.
I reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, reduced eggs to 3, and reduced cinnamon to 4 teaspoons.
If you do not have the puree, use any jam or preserves to taste.

After reading other reviews, I modified it to have no sugar or cinnamon in the egg/milk mixture,but instead applied a cinnamon/sugar topping to each slice as it fried.  I also made this recipe once before and had soggy bread and would have given it a poor rating. 

So this time, I fried each slice separately as normal french toast, and then put the fillings between two slices and confectioners sugar on top.  My hubby bought strawberry cream cheese, even though I had fresh sweetened raspberries ready.  It still tasted good.  I mixed 1/2 cup creamy whipped cream in to the cream cheese to help the texture. which was probably not necessary.  Everything was very good, and I will probably make it for  Christmas brunch with the family.

By far the best French Toast I've ever tasted. I did soak these overnight (flipping once) and bake for 40 minutes on 350 degrees. Absolutely delicious.

Excellent....used strawberry preserves, as it was all I had on Hand. Also liked using half and half rather than milk

My weight-conscious family gave it a thumbs-down, saying it's too much like dessert to have for breakast.

Its creamy and delicious but not as crispy from the outside as i hoped. 
I made it a healthy version i used (fat free cream cheese and fresh raspberries) for the filling . Low fat milk and stevia sweetener instead of the sugar.
Used a fat free oil spray instead of the butter and topped it with fresh berries and organic honey.

This was good but nothing too special. Partially my fault as I didn't have french bread on hand but figured it would still be good on regular bread. I also thought I had more cream cheese than I did but made it anyways. It was still good, but not wow good like I thought it would be. I'll have to try it again this time with the right ingredients!

TOTALLY delicious!!!  I made this as is, and everyone LOVED it.  I made it on Christmas morning and what a treat it was.  
The only thing I will change next time is less milk in the egg mixture. That's only because of a personal preference for more "eggy" french toast.

I love french toast but was disappointed with this recipe. The middle was soggy and it was way to sweet for me....and I love sweets. I even added less sugar than called for.

Very good.  This recipe is easy to scale for 1 or 2 people.  I used 1/4 of the recipe for my son and I.  I used strawberries in place of the raspberries and topped the french toast with extra sliced strawberries and "the absolute best pancake syrup" from this site.

Okay. So, here's the deal. I made these for my boys for breakfast. They wouldn't eat them. Not a fan of cream cheese, I found out. But, I loved them. Not like cheesecake, but still a good combo. I didn't have French bread, so I used a whole wheat sandwich I had on hand. So. Four stars based on my assessment. My kids on the other hand wouldn't eat it.

WOW! This was REALLY good. I've been wanting to make a stuffed french toast and I found the recipe i'll use from now on. I used strawberry jam since I didn't have raspberry and used a little bit less cinnamon (2T seemed a little excessive).

i was worried at first because the egg mixture seemed to be excessive but it all turns out just fine in the end. I did however cut the bread into 1/2 inch slices, and i used a raspberry preserve instead. I'm sure there are tons of other ways of going about doing this one but its a keeper! i cant wait to serve it up to my niece and nephew.

Very easy, don't let the "Stuffed" scare you.  I sliced the bread about 1/2 inch thick and then made the "sandwich".  My husband and I loved this.  I'm not big on syrup so this worked out wonderful.
