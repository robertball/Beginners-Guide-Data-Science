Great recipe, but so spicy! Wow! I will definately go light on the red pepper next time.

The Cilantro and Garlic with the Red Wine Vinegar was a great touch. Will use again!

My husband and I love this sauce! It went great with the risotto I made and was delicious on the steak, and it wasn't too spicy for my taste either! Thanks!

I was actually pretty disapointed with this recipe. The odds are I just prepared it wrong, as I am new with the whole cooking thing, but I felt that the sauce was too strong.  My dad liked it however, so maybe it's just personal taste. It was okay, but I most likely won't cook it again.

Sounds great and tasty and I look forward to fixing but I can't find the Red Wine Vinegar italian Herb.  So I bought the seasoned rice vinegar basil & oregano.  Thinking of mixing it with red wine vinegar.  Any other suggestions?
