My husband LOVED this dish! The flavor of the meat is so wonderful, that we will use Greek dressing as a marinade in the future!

Nice blend of flavors - I used Greek Souvlaki Dressing from this site and I added some torn romaine lettuce (didn't need it - would be lovely as stated in the recipe - but I had to use it up) and used a Mediterranean Herb Flavored Feta.  I usually go for the Thai or Asian flavored steak salads, but this was a nice change!
