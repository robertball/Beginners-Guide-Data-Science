I adapted it for California style.  i used the entire 16 oz bag of small shells 1 can of black olives 5 cans of tuna, in water drained whole dill pickles in my quick chopper..just thru them in sweet relish Giuliano jalapeno spread (its really a jalapeno relish)  this is delish on everything fresh ground pepper hot chili flakes lots of mayo and juice of any of your relishes to thin it out i uses 2 red onions chopped shredded carrots for color lots of celery   put all the chopped, mayo, tuna, etc in a chilled bowl and blend together, just everything.  rinse the pasta in cold water to chill and dump in and mix and mix taste and taste. let the flavors blend and fuse overnight.   you can sub small cooked shrimp for the tuna too sometimes i put small chunks of pepper jack cheese. This is the bomb!

This is from the author of the recipe, I think that maybe 1 and 1/2 cups to 2 cups of mayonnaise may be enough, depending on how you like it.

Changed this recipe a tad.  I added Black olive  and substituted Spiral for Macaroni! I also added some Garlic Salt for taste.  It was a little bland without.  My family Loved it! I could of added green onion,but didn't think of it until it was too late! Oh, I used 1-16 oz. box +1/4 of another box of pasta.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was perfect!!!  The only thing I did was add black olives because I need some more color!  It was a big hit. Try it, you will love it, and of course, add your own touches!!  :)

This would have been a great salad, however two cups of mayonnaise is way, way too much. This much mayo ruins this which has great potential. Try it with 1/2 cup instead...

Delicious! I added cubed cheddar cheese as well (not very much...) and omitted the celery since I'm not crazy about "crunch" in my tuna salad. Delcious!

I've been making this for years with the addition of some lemon juice to offset the fishy taste and a whole cucumber partially peeled in stripes and chopped.  I usually use a whole box of small shell macaroni and other ingredients, to taste, so we have plenty of tasty leftovers.  It's even better the next day?

This is basically my recipe except I also add fresh lemon juice to the salad, a little mustard to counter the mayo, and garlic powder.  No olives.  Top with smoked Paprika.
