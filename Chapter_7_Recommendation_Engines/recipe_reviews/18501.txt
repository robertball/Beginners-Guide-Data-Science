This is a great recipe. Just like the one my Mother-in-Law always made! The only thing I do different is to place the cut up rhubarb in a bowl and then add the flour, sugar mixture.  Mix it well. This keeps the flour and sugar from clumping together. I also dot with butter before adding the top crust.

Awesome pie!!!!! My roommates LOVED it!! Tangy, yet sweet....i added a little bit of cinnamon too....but oh so easy to make!!!

Oh yes, instead of putting the flour on top of the rhubarb, i mixed the flour, sugar, and rhubarb all together first then but it in the pan....more even distribution of flour and sugar

This is a great pie! I was out of OJ and went in search of a recipe with ingredients I already had in the house. I came across this one and made it this afternoon. We had it for dessert tonight and everyone in the family (all 6 of us) love this pie. We love rhubarb and its nice not to have the flavor cammoflaged by something else. I'll make this one again many times this summer! Thanks Michelle, great recipe!

I enjoyed this pie and would make again with a few minor adjustments. It was a little to thick, so I would reduce the flour by a couple Tablespoons. I would also at 1/8 -1/4 teaspoon of salt to bring out the rhubarb flavor. And I might even reduce the sugar a bit. This is a good basic recipe that's easy to tweak to your personal preference. I recommend it!

This pie was super easy to make.

It tasted great!

I just found the sugar/flour mixture settled to the bottom and made too thick of a sugary crust at the bottom.

I may try less sugar next time or mix in some softened butter to stick it to the rhubarb better before filling the pie.

The flavor was good but there was much too much flour in this recipe.  When I was putting the filling in the crust Iused a slotted spoon to just use the Rhubarb and there was still too much flour.  Made for a very firm pie.  We like a little moisture.  Would be great with less flour.

This was really easy!! I did make some changes as suggested in other reviews.  I used 1/2 cup of flour instead of 3/4.  I also mixed the rhubarb, flour and sugar together (with a little cinnamon, and nutmeg) in a bowl, then I poured it into the pie crust.  I also made 8 steam slots instead of 4.  I will certainly make this again.

I made this for my Brother-in -law who said that rhubarb pie was his favorite,  he eat three pieces(after he had a full plate of dinner).  I had never made rhubarb pie before but this was easy and turned out great!  Will be making again, I already have a request.

Too much flour.  Made the rhubarb juice too thick.  I cut my rhubarb thin, and I believe that is why.

A suggestion: when making a pie that is likely to "boil over", Tear 1 1/2 in. strips from an old sheet, wet and wrap around edge of crust before baking. Any liquid will be absorbed by the cloth instead of spilling onto floor of oven. This is far superior to foil, and isan"old-timey" remedy.

This was the first time I've made rhubarb pie and it came out perfect. I used Pillsbury frozen pie dough, mixed everything in a bowl then put it in the pie crust. Took all of 5 minutes to prepare. I followed the recipe exactly.

Delish!  I made two pies:  One exactly as written and one modified with suggestions as I really wanted to review the recipe and wanted to review it as written.  As written: came out good. No big issues with clumping as some suggested.  I made sure the sugar and flour were well mixed before sprinkling on top. As modified: I added cinnamon and salt reduced flour and combined in a bowl and dotted it with butter.  I found I didnt really need the butter and could have used the measured amount of flour.  Next time I will use the salt and cinnamon and the listed amount of flour and sugar but will also add an egg mixed in to give it a little more binding and wont use the butter.  Good recipe as written or modified to your preferences.

This pie was very tasty and amazingly tasty.  I've never made Rhubarb pie before.  I spread the rhubarb over the bottom and topped with the flour- sugar mixture.  It helped the top crust remain very crispy and flaky.  I wanted to mention with the flour sugar mixture on top of the rhubarb, no sauce bubbled through the vents.  I liked the thickness of the pie.  When you cut the pieces, the filling didn't ooze out.  It kept its shape like a custard pie. It took two of us a couple of days to eat.

I used 6 cups of rhubarb instead of the 4 and used Splenda instead of sugar.  Unfortunately I forgot to increase my sugar with the increase of rhubarb, so even though a little tart it is an easy recipe. I also decreased my flour to a little less than 1/2 c. even for the 6 cups of rhubarb and it still was a little dry.  All in all, it is a good recipe.  Thanks.

I've found with this recipe, it makes an extremely thick pie. The flour definitely needs to be reduced.  In addition, it will be quite sweet if 1 1/4 cups of sugar is used.  When making this recipe, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and increased the Rhubarb to 5 cups. Next time I will reduce the flour quite a bit.

This was originally the way I made my rhubarb pies also. I then decided to change it a bit. I mix the flour and salt with the rhubarb in a bowl and then instead of sugar, add 1 cup of honey. Top the pie with a couple of teaspoons of butter, put on the top crust and make air holes. Comes out delicious. The honey gives it more flavor and just the right amount of sweetness.

I used this recipe and made mini fried pies. I used a standard pastry recipe, cut into small rounds. Added filling, folded over and sealed. Then deep fried for 3 min. They were SOOOOOO good. The only change I made to the recipe was that I added lemon juice.

I made this pie on Saturday and it turned out great - everybody liked it.  Great recipe - will make it again soon. I mixed the flour and sugar together in a bowl and added the rhubarb; mixed well. I added the mixture to the prepared pie crust.

Way too much flour!   It made the rhubarb thick & floury tasting. Pretty easy recipe though next time I will try it with less flour! I would think that 1/4 cup would be plenty and not take away from the rhubarb taste.

This is a five-star recipe with some simple modifications. I took tips from other reviewers and reduced the sugar by nearly half, added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and decreased the flour in the filling. I also sprinkled the sugar over my rhubarb ahead of time and allowed it to set, then added the flour and mixed together before pouring it in the pie shell. I used turbinado (raw sugar) instead of white sugar. This pie was a big hit at the bake sale and I loved it, too.

Used 5 cups rhubarb.  Also layered 1/2 rhubarb, 1/2 sugar mixture, rest of rhubarb, rest of sugar mixture.  Turned out good for my second-ever pie.  Will use this recipe again.  Baked 40 min.

This was a fantastic pie for all the rhubarb lovers out there! I followed the advice of others and cut back on flour. I only added 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup of flour. I also added 5 cups rhubarb instead of 4 cups, and I added some cinnamon. Was very tart and sweet at the same time. We loved it!

I made this pie today and it was excellent!  I did use a sugar substitute and less flower as suggested.  I also added just a drizzle of honey.

This is a fast and easy recipe that will please everyone who loves rhubarb.  Like others, I reduced the flour and also dotted the top of the fruit with 1 tsp. of butter. It's great served with a whipped topping.  You'll love it!!!    Ellen

The first time I made it, it was fabulous. However, I then made it for a family get-together and it was soupy, had clumps of sugar, and the rhubarb ended up crunchy. I followed the recipe as I did the first time so I have no idea what happened. I will not make this recipe again.

I mixed it in a bowl and added cinnamon before putting it into the crust. Easy and everyone that ate it in the office party loved it!

This is a great and easy recipe. Keep in mind that early rhubarb is juicer then end of season. You may have to adjust the flour by cutting back one tablespoon later in the season.

So easy... my family just raved about it.  The only thing I did differently is allow the rhubarb with flour and sugar mixture to sit overnight before baking.  (I didn't have enough time to finish it in one day) ... no sogginess here... just perfect.

Very easy but the filling came out much too thick.  My rhubard was very thin and perhaps that was the problem.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I followed the recipe exactly and the pie tastes like flour.  I am not an expert baker but it needs something else?? More sugar maybe...cinnamon???  Sorry but I think I will look for another recipe for my next pie.

Simple and delicious! I agree that the sugar and flour should be combined in with rhubarb and mixed, I did keep about 1/5th of the sugar and flour mix to top the mixture.  Also I did not have an egg to brush over the crust and it turned out fine.

I usually make strawberry/rhubarb pie but forgot the strawberries and tapioca pudding so searching for a recipe with just rhubarb.  This pie came out perfect. I had a 10 inch pan so I added 6 cups of rhubarb and put less flour in and it came out perfect. I added sugar crystals on top of the crust and it was so pretty.

I put 6 cups of thinly sliced rhubarb. (It barely closed)! I also added 1 teaspoon of almond. It was a bit tart but was excellent with vanilla ice cream.
