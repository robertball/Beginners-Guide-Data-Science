Tried this with frozen corn niblets rubbed with a little olive oil, spread on aluminum foil lined cokie sheet at 375 degree oven for 30 - 40 min. (stir from time to time) proceeded with rest of recipe as idicated. This does change a lot to the final taste by adding a lot more flavor. Also great with a little sour cream added & served on Corn chips as appetizers.

Absolutely delicious!  I put this with diced tomato, advacado and red onion into warmed corn tortillas and topped it with a tiny sprinkle of mexican cheese.  Best tacos ever!  My husband insisted that I never make anything else.

The best thing about this dish is that it's versatile: you can omit any ingredient you don't like, or add anything you have on hand. You can eat it with corn chips, tortillas or just with a fork! My favorites are black eyed peas, black beans, corn and green peppers. Also works with Caesar garlic dressing. Some days I bring a batch in to work and we all eat it.

Black bean salad recipes are pretty much the same, one to the next.  What drew me to this recipe was the cumin and it proved to be a nice addition.  I used fresh lemon juice and olive oil rather than the balsamic vinaigrette for a lighter, fresher taste.  For the "seasoned pepper' I used Montreal Steak Seasoning.  That, too, was a good choice!  And simply for a little more crunchy texture I threw in some chopped celery, especially since I omitted the corn.  Fairly basic, but neverless tasty black bean salad, which certainly can be tinkered with to suit your own tastes.

Cheating a bit rating this recipe when I changed it so much apologies! Here goes: Used fresh cilantro, substituted black beans for skinned, seeded and diced tomatoes, used red onion instead of ones stated and for dressing whisked together balsamic vinegar, juice of one lime, splenda sweetener, salt, black pepper and of course the cayenne and cumin stated. Left for two hours and served with veggie bean chili and white rice: FANTASTIC!!!

I have made this salad several times for potlucks -- it is always received very well, and people ask me to continue bring it! Don't be afraid to up the spices a bit -- I added extra cumin, cayenne, and pepper, and people really enjoyed it.

great recipe... (I added more cayenne pepper for an extra kick) I brought it to a picnic recently  as a side dish and almost everyone there asked me for the recipe! I plan on making this again as a main course and putting them on tortilla wraps.

My family and I loved this recipe.  I took it to a Cinco De Mayo celebration and it was a hit!  Very flavorful.  I added fresh cilantro and omitted the onions.  I also mixed brown sugar and lime juice into the dressing and added salt and ground pepper to taste.  Wonderful!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Very easy to make. I would probably turn the heat up just a bit on this the next time. Next time I may try it as an appetizer with some good tortilla chips.
Thanks for great recipe!

Ok as written. Spectacular with the following changes: skip the salad dressing and "seasoned pepper" and instead add a hint of olive oil, some lime juice, and a dash of black pepper. Substitute 1 and 2/3 of a cup of freshly made black beans for each 15 ounce can, use around 1/4 of a cup of fresh cilantro, chop and add add two ripe tomatoes, and lightly mix in a ripe avocado at the very end. With those changes this was a refreshing salad that paired well with the grilled salmon we were having. Can't wait to make this again.

I made this for a potluck today at work and it went over pretty well.   I used light balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  I also used fresh ground pepper instead of seasoned pepper, red onion, 1/4 tsp cayenne, about 1/2 cup fresh chopped cilantro (instead of dried) and added half of a fresh squeezed lime.   Instead of canned corn I took a 16 ounce bag of frozen corn kernels and rinsed them under cold water to thaw and drained well. Next time I'll double both the cayenne & lime. I'm also thinking of adding a can of tomatoes/green chilies when I make it again to add a little extra kick.  But as is, it's very tasty.

I love this recipe.  I followed the recipes excactly and will be making over and over again.  It's so simple to throw together and tastes wonderful.  This could be eaten alone, in a tortilla, or even made into a soup.  I love it!

Very good!!  It was actually best 2 days after it was made... the flavors were even better.  Next time I might try adding some fresh cilantro and perhaps a little more spice.  But it is very good as is, too.

Excellent!  This salad is quick, easy to make and delicious!  You can also omit the vinagrette and just use vinegar to omit the fat and oil.  My family is hooked on this salad.  We make it once a week!

Very tasty - my only complaint would be to use a pre-made salad dressing, so I used the Spiced Balsamic Vinagrette recipe on this site which is also excellent.  Perfect combo.

I added the juice of a whole lime and a handful of chopped cilantro, and cut back the vinaigrette to a third  cup.  The vinaigrette was a little overpowering for me, so the lime toned it down a little. One can each, garbonzo,white corn,yellow corn and black beans.   definately a keeper, a good crunch.

We love this recipe. It makes a ton so I often make it with only one can of beans and one can of corn while keeping everything else as written. For extra color I use red onion if I have  it in the house.

Awesome! Absolutely delicious. Leftovers were equally yummy.  Excellent with fresh parsley instead of cilantro.  And the lime really does it in this recipe...don't skimp on it! I'll make this again and again. Thanks, Bonnie!

I took this to a potluck, and it was a big hit!  I used balsamic vinegar instead of dressing and left out the cilantro (which I detest), and it was very good without being greasy.

I made this the other night for a pre-July 4th gathering and it was a hit.  Since it was so hot out, I wanted something cold and also something without mayo, meat or anything else that could easily spoil.

I used Newman's balsamic vinaigrette dressing, organic canned black beans and organic canned kernel corn, a red bell pepper, and green onions; I omitted the regular onion.  I goofed when making this and didn't mix the dressing ingredients separately as the recipe called for, but just tossed everything into a bowl at once and mixed it...and it was still great.  As one reviewer suggested, I added a bit more cayenne pepper, as most of my friends like a little more heat, and it was just right.

My plan this weekend is to do what another reviewer suggested and use this as a filling for tacos.

Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious!!!  I used this recipe as a template and modified to taste. I only used a pinch of cayenne pepper and cumin. I didnt have balsamic vinegarette so I just used balsamic vinegar and I doubled the cilantro. I also skipped the bell pepper because I'm not a fan.  Adding tomatoes is a must!!  I would have included avacado, but there weren't any ripe ones at the grocery store.  This recipe is hard to mess up and is sooo tasty!!

This recipe was so easy and SO good! I made it twice in the last 2 weeks and got so many great reviews. It is so refreshing and tasty. You can eat it so many ways; plain, on a salad, with crackers, on rice or in a burrito. Will definitely be a frequent in my house.

Simple and so flavourful!  I think that next time I might up the spices a bit, especially the cayenne, to give it more kick.  I halved the recipe and mostly stuck to it, but used regular black pepper, only green onions, and fresh cilantro.  Made it for a barbecue potluck -- I let it sit in the fridge overnight and the flavours were great!

I've made this before- however, I'm much more a fan of this recipe with a vinaigrette made from lime or lemon juice with oil instead of the basalmic. I also use red onions chopped finely instead of scallions. The soft crunch of the onion is more satisfying, and I like the brightness of the lime with the cilantro and cumin. Just make not sure to overkill on the lime- which is easy to do. I also add a smidge more cayenne- I love the heat! I use this on tacos, with chips, on eggs- you name it!  Its just a great way to get in extra protein and some veggies. Fresh Corn is so much better! But I regularly used frozen when its out of season. :)

MY dad's wife used to make this a lot. My sister and I could never get enough of it. Recently, I attended a birthday party for my best friend (a vegetarian) and told her I would make something. This was the first thing that popped into my head. I was VERY glad to have found it here! I made as directed, which filled a large mixing bowl. When I took it to the party (there were only 7 people there) I was afraid I had made too much. EVERYONE loved it. I got compliments from every single person there on how it tasted. One girl liked it so much, she topped her hamburgers with it. At the end of the night, all of it was gone. And now my boyfriend is requesting that I make more of it. **NOTE** I serve this with Tostitos Scoops!

I really liked this combination; however, I did find that it needed closer to one cup of the balsamic vinaigrette. With that modification, it was divine!

Made this for my carnivorous family and they loved it.  Used fresh cilantro instead of dried and threw in some green bell peppers.  Good for lunch the next day, too.

What a great recipe!! The only thing I changed was I added a 4 oz can of diced green chilis, added a bit more cumin, and used low fat version of the dressing. It was a huge hit!!

This is the best "all recipes" recipe I have made yet!  Everybody loved it, and my uncle who complains about everything, had seconds and thirds!  It also is one of the prettiest dishes I've made (and easy)!  I'll definitely make it again!!!

This is a great dish!  Perfect for potlucks...in the morning you simply grab it out of the fridge and go.  I added a bit extra red pepper and cilantro.  This is fabulous when it's scooped up with a tortilla chip and washed down with a margarita.

Amazing recipe...I make it whenever I´m invited to a picnic, baby shower, etc.  The ONLY difference is that I add FRESH cilantro and a medium diced avocado.  Other than that...fabulous!

I really like this. I make it a lot, as I don't get a lunch hour at work, but am off at 2 and home at 2:30. It makes a great, already prepared lunch. I serve it on top of a green salad, scoop it with chips, use as a topping for tacos or fajitas, or even just eat it as a side dish alongside some grilled chicken. I have since tweaked it, though to be more friendly to my normal eating lifestyle. Instead of balsamic dressing, I just use balsamic vinegar (or red wine works well too).  I season with 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp cayenne. I use 1/4 cup freshly chopped cilantro, one stalk of green onion, and a chopped red bell pepper. It's perfect just like this, and oil free.

This recipe is super easy and totally delicious!  I brought it to a potluck today and it disappeared very quickly.  It makes a ton - so don't double the recipe if you plan to eat it as a side dish.  I used leftover corn on the cob (sliced off) for the corn and it was scrumptious.  I didn't have time to refrigerate it overnight but it still had a ton of flavor.  Makes a great filler for fajitas too - just add your meat of choice!

I use this recipe constantly and vary it widely. It really is a great basic recipe to futz around with. I use garbanzos, add other veggies, add cheddar or feta or canned peppers depending on what is at hand. Use beans, corn, and and awesome vinaigrette and the possibilities are limitless. (Do try adding cheese, but only at the last minute or it will get soggy.)

I have made this 5 times in about a month and a half. My family LOVE this. I alter the recipe a bit by adding pico de gallo, and a yellow onion instead of scallions. We ate is as a salad for 1 day and this discovered this is way better with Tostitos lime chips!

This was great!
I made this and ate it in the same night without marinating as instructed. It was still good, but i have to admit, it was much yummier the second day.
I did not use the dried cilantro, but fresh. I made my own vinaigrette, using balsamic vinegar and olive oil, and also squeezed a lime over it!
So good. :)

Excellent!!!  So full of flavour.  Served some of this to a friend of mine and she loved it.  Wouldn't stop talking about how delicious it was.  I used mixed beans instead of black beans and added parsley instead of cilantro cause I didn't all ingredients.  I'll definately be making this on a regular basis.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great salad to bring to picnics because you don't have to worry about refrigeration. I like to use frozen corn instead of canned because it tastes fresher, and fresh chopped cilantro. I use more cumin than listed, and I also add some chili powder and the juice of a lime.

This was the yummiest bean salad I've ever had! I was a bit weary of the acidity of the vinegrette, but when I allowed it to marinate and cool, I was pleased with the fruity, sweet taste of the vinegar with the salad. It kept well in the fridge and still tasted great after a couple days. Super recipe, would make again and again. Thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe!  We prefer the fresh cilantro, but this has been a big hit at home and at the office!

Wow, a dish my kids and husband all loved!  Served this as a side to a Mexican dinner and it was a big hit. (Don't know if it 'keeps well' as there wasn't a bit left!)

Very delicious! Unfortunately I didn't have any cilantro so I skipped that ingredient, but I will definately make sure I add it next time.

Great recipe. I stuck to the recipe the first time. Fantastic! Just the right seasonings. 
The 2nd time, I only added fresh cilantro vs. dried - EVEN BETTER! 
I'll keep making this. I use this for a meal & for dinners when I have night class. Very filling, and so delish.

I made this for the first time tonight and really really liked it but I did tweak it a little bit.  I took the advice from the other recipes and used fresh lemon juice and olive oil instead of the vinaigrette, and also the Montréal seasoning. I also used fresh corn right off the cob since I'm  making this in the summer.  Next time I'lll use fresh cilantro because the dried cilantro you couldn't really taste.  I only marinated for about an hour and it tasted great.  I think next time I will combine this recipe and the black bean and corn salad II

This salad is delicious & so easy to throw together!  The flavor of the black beans mixed with the corn, onions & spices is perfect.  This dish also lasts for days & can be used as a main dish or a side.  I made it for myself & my boyfriend, this time... but I think I'll also make it for the next potluck I go to!  Excellent!

This recipe is excellent.  This salad was really good, especially on the 2nd day after marinating.  My family, friends and co-workers loved it.  They all want the recipe; also, it was fun preparing it.

This salad is not only healthy, but attractive and tasty!  We had it as a side dish with grilled chicken (topped with bacon, cheese and green chile).  It does make a lot... we also ate it with tortillas chips for a couple of days afterward.  We made just a couple of changes... used fresh cilantro, red and yellow bell peppers, red onion (and less of it for my kiddos' sake), more cayenne.  AWESOME!!  You can really adjust it to your liking and our dinner guests were so impressed!  This is a new staple in our family!

Quite tasty, but the recipe makes a ton.  Be sure to scale down if you are not planning on feeding 20+ people!  I added avocado and it was yummy.

for an alternate dressing you could use: 1/4 cup of olive oil,2 tbsp red wine vinegar,1 clove minced garlic,1 tsp each of salt and ground cumin and 1/2 tsp each of black pepper and sugar.using 1/4 cup of fresh coriander really makes the difference.great with chicken or fish along with a simple rice.

The first time I tried this, I thought it was very good, but it wasn't as zippy as I was expecting.  I assumed it was the salad dressing I chose. When I tried it again, I halved the recipe, but accidently added the full amount of spices.  That turned out to be the best mistake I ever made because this time it had the kick I was looking for.  So I always double the spices now.

This was a huge hit. I  used fresh corn and fresh cilantro though and right before I served it I added fresh-squeezed lime juice. I think it needed it to doctor up the bottled vinigarette dressing. My non-black bean eaters were converted1

I made this for a cook-out this past weekend and everyone loved it. I did make a few changes. I added the juice of 2 limes, because I found the balsamic to be slightly overpowering. I also added chopped jalapeno (sp?), because I wanted it to be a little spicier. I made it the day before and used some that night as a topping for grilled tuna. It was delicious. In fact, I'm getting ready to make another batch now. Thanks for a great recipe

Very good.  I tried marinating it for just a couple of hours and hubby hated it.  He tried it again two days later and LOVED it! Marinating over night (at least) is the secret to this recipe!

Everytime I make this, I wonder why I don't make this more often.  It's so easy to make and tastes so refreshing.  It's wonderful for summer BBQ's because there's nothing that spoils quickly in the hot sun.  Everyone that's ever tasted this has loved it.  Oh, I usually add more onions just 'cause I like them so much.

I have discovered that the things I couldn't stand to eat as a child, have a soft spot in my heart for now.  Number one on the list...Black Beans.  I love them, and this recipe is perfect.  it's cool and refreshing, and the 5-year old in me now yells, "Yes!  Black Beans!"

I make this over and over again! I rinse the black beans in a colander & I use the low-fat version of the vinaigrette dressing.  This recipe is very flexible and I add different ingredients.

This was good but I could not resist adding celery, green bell pepper, fresh cilantro instead of dried (and much more of it) and a must have - tomatoes! I used Italian dressing I made from a package and used more vinegar than oil. Very good.

Made pretty much according to recipe, but I did add fresh cilantro the morning of the party.  It was something different and healthier than the usual picnic salads, but I didn't think the taste was overwhelmingly great.  I doubled the cumin and would probably use more.  Will look for another recipe.

I love this!  Very adaptable and delicious.  Also good with raspberry vinaigrette and a little lime juice, instead of the balsamic vinaigrette.

This was very good.  A wonderful blend of tastes!  It tastes great on tortilla chips.  It makes way more than the six servings indicated, too.

Being a meat eater, I have a hard time finding things I can make for my friends who are all vegan/vegetarians.  This hits the spot for all of us.  Adding fresh chopped cilantro on the side is recommended for those who like the flavor.

I followed the recipe except for the onion.  Since my mom isn’t a big onion fan, I chose to only put the green onion.  It was enjoyed by all at Father’s Day BBQ.

I love this dish!  It's easy to make, inexpensive, and everyone always loves it.  The only variation I've made is I use 1 can of black beans and I add fresh cilantro.  I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Like another poster, I added in tomatoes and avocados and I used a lot of cilantro. This is a great base recipe that you can mix up and change depending on the tastes of your guests.

I served this to a bunch of high schoolers (and a few chaperones) and it was a big hit! I got several compliments. However, I added a LOT more seasoning than what the recipe called for- specifically more pepper, cayenne, balsamic, and a whole lot more of the cumin. I kept adding until I thought it tasted right. I tried roasting the corn ahead of time like someone else suggested, but I won't do that again. I personally like the fresh taste better, and it certainly didn't add enough to the dish to be worth the trouble of this extra pre-step. I left out the chopped onion, only because I was serving it to a group that might not have wanted raw onion breath at their special event. I will definitely do this recipe again, with the added flavorings.

Love this recipe! Make it all the time as quick dinner addition to meat, rice, lettuce wraps. Always a hit! Add 1 or 2 chipotle peppers for additional smoky flavor.

This salad is amazing! I double the spices & use homemade balsamic vinaigrette. I use corn cut from the cob instead of canned & 'PC blue menu' black beans to cut out the sodium. I add fresh cilantro & extra red pepper too. Even my husband loves it & he isn't a huge fan of black beans. It definitely needs to sit overnight, but it is awesome!!

I thought this salad was great!  I took reviewers suggestions and made some changes.  Wasn't sure which suggestions I'd like so I hedged my bets, split the recipe in half and did different things for both halves.  In both salads I used corn off the cob that I had frozen over the summer, just thawed it out.  Also used fresh cilantro for both.  In one half I used a white onion and green onions and in the other half I used only a red onion.  I keep tasting both and can't tell a true difference between them.  The one with the green onions looks a little prettier though with the extra color.  Next time I might just use only the green onion and nix the white and reds.  I also used another reviewers suggestion of putting it on a corn chip and then I put a dollop of sour cream on top.  When I mixed the sc into the salad it took away from the color of it so the dollop on top looked best.  The longer it's marinated the better the flavors.  Will definitely make this again!

Added pasta to make it more mainstream for a summer birthday get together.  A nice change from the normal mayo based pasta salad.

I like it, i give it 4 stars cause i am was the obly one eating it at my last BBQ and now I am stuck with a bunch. First i changed the number of servings to be for 20 people, I had 34 proplr over. When I start to BBQ everyone comes out cause they know I get down on the grill. so when I made it for 20 it looked like i made enough for 40-50 people. So remember that when making it makes a lot. I also added tomatoes from my garden and green bellpeppers as well. I put fresh Jalepenos on the side cause i like spice but not everyone does. All in all it was good recipe but it makes a lot.

I have made this twice in the last month. Once for a luncheon at my home, all the guest loved it and once for a 4th of July picnic. Everyone there that tried it loved it to.  The hostess asked for the recipe. I halved the recipe both times.  It makes a lot of salad.

A very good salad that is not so spicy that kids won't like it. Easy to put together, and looks nice too. Served with grilled mexican chicken for the meat eaters and home made tortilla chips. thanks!

Very good, and very easy. To make it a bit healthier I used light dressing and hominy instead of sweet corn, and it tasted great. The recipe says to let it sit overnight, but I found that it tasted better right off the bat, at room temp.

Great side dish - the balsamic w/ the spices comes out good.  Refrigerated mine overnight to really let the flavor soak in.

I doubled the spices like another reviewer suggested, and this dish was phenominal!  And it looked pretty, too.  Unfortunately, it was hardly touched when I took it to a BBQ on the 4th.

Very tasty! I used green instead of red peppers, and oregano instead of cilantro. We ate it with tostito chips. I also imagine it would be good with guacamole and sour cream, however, then it wouldn't be as healthy. This recipe does make a lot, you could cut it in half and still have enough as a side dish for dinner.

This recipe is universal.  You could eat it cold or warm it up and use with grilled chicken or fish.  Goes great with brown rice when you add a little bit of honey to heated bb&c salad.

This was the closest recipe to a black bean and corn salad that I had at a pot luck years ago. I remembered most of the ingredients but had to make a few changes. I didn't use the vinagrette. I just used the juice of one lemon, instead of canned corned, I used frozen Hanover corn microwaved for about 90 seconds. I used a red onion and different color peppers to give it a festive color. Added more cumin and red pepper flakes for some kick. Goes great with fish or grilled chicken.

Excellent salad!  I made this with fresh cilantro because it seemed wrong to do it any other way.  Pretty versatile, too (on tortilla, with chicken, add rice, etc).  Will be using this recipe all summer.

One thing to note, this seems to make more than six servings.  My finished product was at least ten cups, and I only added 1/2 cup red bell pepper into the original recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I made it twice.  I did add a little bit more spice as my family likes it hot.  I served it to a group of international students and they ate it all!! Thanks!

I used fat free italian dressing in place of the balsamic vinaigrette and didn't have red peppers so I just used green. Would have been nice with the red peppers and some fresh cilantro.
I'm just not used to eating beans like this cold, but my husband liked it.
Might make this again.

This is amazingly packed full of flavor and super easy to make.  A huge hit with my husband and a guest.  I used one can of black beans instead of two for more of a crisp experience with the corn and red peppers.  We might use some onions next time too.

This is a great recipe, and even if you improvise it's hard to mess up.  It must be made the day before, and I highly recommend adding a bunch of fresh chopped cilantro the morning of, but I'm a fresh cilantro freak.  Try adding a couple tablespoons of good quality balsamic vinegar.

This was good, although I added fresh cilantro instead of dried, the juice of 1/2 lime, and three seeded plum tomatoes.  Had some friends over and they loved it!

This was a nice side dish I served with pico de gallo chicken quesadillas I got off this site.  It was quick and easy to make. I put the pepper and onion in the mini food processor.  I didn't have any dried cilantro so I used fresh and really liked the flavor.

This was just OK to me.  Kind of bland.  In defense of the recipe, I only let it sit 9 hours in the refrigerator instead of overnight.

I served this salad for a Teacher's Appreciation luncheon and got rave reviews.  They wished I had doubled it!  I added fresh cilantro the next morning (about 1/2 cup chopped) because I thought it needed some color.  Excellent recipe and easy!

I have made many recipes from this site, but this is the first one I have reviewed.  This salad is excellent, made it for a BBQ this weekend with 18 people and thought my husband & I would be the only one who would eat this.  Everyone loved it.  Made my own balsamic vinaigrette instead of using bottled.  Will be making again soon.

Great recipe!  My husband and teenager both loved it.  I added 2 stalks of celery, sliced and used 2 sprigs of fresh parsley in place of the dried cilantro.  Will definitely make again!
