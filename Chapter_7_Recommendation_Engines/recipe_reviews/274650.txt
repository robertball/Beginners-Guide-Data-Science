Made as written and this turned out pretty good but was too sweet for our tastes. I also felt like there were too many steps and too much hands on which took away from the ease the Instant Pot is supposed to provide. The pork was super tender though so I am giving this 4 stars. I would definitely make this again but would skip making the sauce and just use our favorite Kansas City style bottled sauce which would eliminate that extra step that I didn't care for that resulted in an overly sweet sauce.
