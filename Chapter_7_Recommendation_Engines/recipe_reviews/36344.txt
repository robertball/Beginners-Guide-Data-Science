Quick and easy!  I used boneless chicken and marinated overnight.  A nice and tangy flavor!

I didn't really care for this.  All I could taste was the mesquite smokey flavor.  I marinated for several hours and maybe that was why.  I won't make again.

Excellent! Used boneless skinless chicken breasts and only marinated for a half hour. Very moist and great taste!

I made this for a dinner party and used a shallow glass baking dish, covered tightly with plastic wrap.  The only snag was that the store only had the McCormick Mesquite Grill Seasoning in a glass jar.  I used what would be a double dose and worked out great on the grill.  It is a 5-star recipe!  Fab reviews from all.  Uncooked leftovers hit an iron pan the next day with wonderful results m-m-m-m-m!

This recipe is delicious.  The chicken is very moist and tender.  I marinaded the chicken for a few hours and used boneless chicken breasts as well...it's a keeper!!

Couldn't find the mestique marinade so just used a cajun seasoning mix and added a few drops of liquid smoke. The lime / smoky flavour went right through the chicken. Would have liked a bit more sweetness to balance the tartness of the lime. Other than that it was very yummy.

Sorry to say, but this just wasn't one of our favorites. The first turn off was the smell. Something about the mixture of ingredients just didn't smell yummy. Everyone just thought the flavor of the chicken was just *okay*. I will not be making this again.

This was so delicious!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and marinated for 24 hours. Also used olive oil and doubled the lime juice. Loved the smokey flavor here.  Easy and very tasty. Thanks!

This was an excellent marinade.  I used boneless, skinless thighs, marinaded overnight, and grilled on the gas grill.  My 4 boys loved this dish!

Loved this and it couldn't be easier!  I had Weber brand mesquite marinade but otherwise followed the recipe.  Let it marinate about 30-40 minutes and grilled it.  Even the kids couldn't get enough!
