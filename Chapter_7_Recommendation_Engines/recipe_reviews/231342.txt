I did this in the crockpot, so I only added 1 cup of water plus the cup of wine.  Hooray for a no 'cream of yuck' soup recipe!  I wanted our sauce thick (that doesn't happen in the crockpot) and I added a nice flour/cornstarch/butter mixture over medium heat, and then put it back in the crockpot to keep warm and get the starch taste out.  I also added about 6 ounces of mushrooms, just because I had them.  Only used 2 tbsp each of worchestershire sauce and soy sauce.  Omitted salt and only used 3/4 tsp total of pepper.  I figured with the gravy mixture there would be salt enough without a full 1/2 cup of sodium filled soy and worchestershire.  As for wine...I used a nice tempranillo.  Definitely something we will enjoy around here more often!

My family enjoyed this.  I followed the review of Arizona Desert Flower (thank you!) and made slight modifications.  I did not brown my beef or sauté the onions (I didn't have the time nor do I really think it's necessary, in my opinion).  I cut my beef tips (or stew beef) into very small bite-size pieces and threw them in the crockpot.  I chopped a sweet onion and added it to the crockpot as well as three (3) 6-oz cans of mushrooms (would've preferred fresh, but canned was all I had on hand).  Used 1 cup of warm water and added a 30% less sodium packet of brown gravy mix to it.  To that mixture I added 1 cup of red cooking wine, the tablespoon of minced garlic, 2 T of worcestershire sauce and 2 T of low-sodium soy sauce.  Combined it all thoroughly and poured it over the beef tips, onions and mushrooms (no need to mix).  Added a small amount of freshly ground pepper and freshly ground sea salt to the top.  I let it cook on low all day (9 hours).  Just before serving, I used a sauce pan to make a roux of melted butter, flour and a bit of cornstartch to serve as a thickening agent.  Added it to the crockpot, gave it a quick stir and let it rest another 15 minutes or so.  I served this over egg noodles with Brussels sprouts.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I followed the recipe closely except for the following, I used low sodium soy sauce, low sodium brown gravy mix, did not add any additional salt and added green peppers. I found it to be rather watery and will next time follow the previous reviews with adding less water and thicken it.

This is an excellent recipe, lots of flavor! A couple of simple changes: I made it in the crock pot without browning beforehand. I didn't have dry gravy mix, so eliminated the water and used a cup of prepared 'au jus' from a jar. I used coarse ground pepper, but not the cracked pepper, as I suspected it would be too much for my family. I was right about that, and will probably cut back from the 1 tsp of ground pepper next time. There WILL be a next time!

Since I wanted a thicker sauce, but cooked it in a slow cooker, I only used 1 cup of water.  The sauce was still a little thin, so I stirred 1 tablespoon of cornstarch in a tablespoon of water, then added it to the slow cooker.  The sauce thickened a bit. I also added a cup of sliced mushrooms. Overall, it was a delicious recipe.

Made this on a cold, rainy day in the crockpot, my guys gave it a thumbs up when served over noodles as suggested.  As noted by others, it is a bit watery so in my case I simply added an additional packet of gravy mix and omitted the salt.  Extended it a bit by adding mushrooms and sliced celery, otherwise just as directed.   It has a nice 'bite' to it thanks to the pepper and wine combo.  Will make again.

'My husband loved this, he doesn't like anything.  I used a shoulder roast for the beef.  I cut it into pieces like stew meat.  It was  very tender.  The only wine I had was Merlot so I used it.
