You left out: drop by teaspoonfulls on a greased & floured pan (or use Pam for Baking - works better). Then let dry for 8 hours (or overnight)before baking. Cookies will then develop the propper frosting-like crust on top. You can't make these cookies in rainy or humid weather.

I make these often. I use the bulk/bagged anise seed in the Hispanic food section, rather than the overpriced little jars in the spice section. Also, rather than beat the eggs and sugar that long, I just mix the two, then let them sit until the sugar is dissolved (which is the whole point, anyway). Yummy, always! I like mine a bit on the chewy side.

I made my cookies much larger than teaspoon drops and they turned out wonderfully.  Let them bake longer (until edges are slightly brown - like the color of antique book pages).

Great.  However, my husband (and his brother and uncle) remember their grandmonther's (mother to uncle) cookies were very hard and dry and stood up like little mountains. Apparently the dough must be very stiff to keep it from drooping to flat cookies.  How can we change the recipe to make this happen?

I followed the recipe exactly down to using small eggs.  It produced a nice consistancy drop dough,  due to having a very hot oven I shortened the cooking time to 10 minuets which produced a beautiful golden brown bottom.  The upper side was nearly white, the flavor delicate, but lacked something to make them memorable and equivalant to the rest of my Holiday cookie tray.  I'd say this is a good everyday cookie for those who like the flavor of anise but find the Italian cookies too pungent with the anise oil used (which I prefer). A good cookie to be served with strong coffee.

I liked, but a little too crispy for me so I reduced the baking time to 10 min. I also didn't care for the large pieces of anise seed so I put it through a pepper grinder and used 1/2 Tbs. instead of 1 Tbs.  The flavor was very mild, which I like.

Interesting texture.  Initially sweet, then fades to anise.  Might be good with a light sugar glaze, too.  Will make again.  Addicting.

This is very similar to the Aniskuchen recipe in an old German cookbook I have. It has obviously been "Anglicized," and I'm glad to see it here. The original recipe calls for leaving the cookie trays set out for a couple of hours for partial drying, just as one leaves Springerle out to dry before baking. I'm glad of the tip about small eggs. Maybe that's why my results are inconsistent. Thanks.

These had an intriguing texture and taste.  Unfortunately, after about 3 days their texture started to get a little strange. Very good if they are eaten fresh.  I used a large egg with no ill effects, and substituted about 1/2tsp ground star anise.

AnizeplaÃ«tchen!  Thank you, thank you for posting this!  My Barbadian-American mom and I used to make these every Christmas; but somewhere along the line I managed to lose her recipe.  Have searched high and low but never found just the right recipe -- and now, here's the closest approximation I've found to date!  I remember her recipe called for beating the batter for 20 minutes, dropping the batter onto a baking sheet and then letting these self-frosting cookies sit overnight before baking (in order to form the topping).  Whatever...  Thanks again for posting this; can't wait to get home and try it out!

Pretty delicious.  Not so sure what exactly the taste is.  Very something my grandmother made.  Kind of bland, but good.

This cookie yielded great results even at altitude!!!  I set the oven to 360 degrees and the cookies came out great.  I baked this for my son's Ethnic foods unit in Social Studies.  It was so easy to make, even HE could have made them.  It's a GREAT quick dessert!

The flavor was great,  but the cookies didn't flow out as they should have. I let them sit overnight but they still looked like the spoonfuls of dough that I placed on the cookie sheet.  I think that I may have used too much flour for the egg-sugar mixture. I will try again!

I looked at other reviews before putting these together last night. I ground the anise in my herb (coffee) grinder and added a teaspoon of cardamom to the dough. Spooned them onto my cookie sheets and let them sit in the cold oven (my house is 65 degrees) over night and just finished baking them up. SO good, and perfect with coffee! The self-iced top is beautiful! Also, I greased my parchment paper before I set the dough on and had no problem getting the cookies off the paper.

I don't know what I did, but mine came out totally wrong. They look more like drop biscuits or dumplings. :(
