This recipe came together nicely, and was enjoyed by all with biscuits on the side.
I did add about one cup extra of rice, and one whole chopped onion rather than just a third - we like onion!  Next time, I may try using only one can of tomato soup.
All in all, a satisfying autumn dish!

Great recipe. I added salt, pepper, basil and garlic powder to the mixture giving it more flavor. I also used Red Gold diced tomatoes that had garlic, basil and oregano.

I give this five stars because of the concept. I LOVE stuffed green peppers. But making them often has numerous tedious steps. And my hubby likes to put little to no effort into preparing and eating food. Having to cut up the stuffed pepper to eat it required a little too much effort for him. So whenever I did make them he would groan a little. So to have all the flavors of a stuffed pepper but in an easy to eat way is a huge winner for me. I followed the recipe pretty close as written. I added an extra pepper and boiled the two peppers for about 4 minutes. It was almost too long as the peppers were in the verge of being overcooked. After cooking the ground beef and onions I added a teaspoon of salt and a little garlic salt and some garlic powder. Mostly because I did not have diced tomatoes with garlic on hand. Those were the only changes I made. It was so tasty and we loved it!

This was so good!  I added salsa and pasta sauce instead of tomato soup and spiced it up with taco seasoning.  Will definitely make again!

I used my own variation with fresh diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauces,  but still very good!
