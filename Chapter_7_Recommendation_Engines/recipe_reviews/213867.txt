I needed something quick & easy for a family gathering, it was a huge hit. I omitted the peas and ham, used 1/2 herb & garlic & 1/2 regular cream cheese & added some fresh parmesan cheese on top.

Excellent dish! Creamy and delish! However, I omitted the peas. I would have given it 5 stars had it had a bit more seasoning. I added garlic powder, black pepper and dried thyme leaf. I will definitely make this again!

I used plain greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.  Adds tons more protein and calcium.  This was a hit with my family including a teenager and a 9 year old who has Celiac Disease.  DELISH!

I did everything except used other types of potatoes, used milk instead of broth, and don't like ham. It had a creamy rich taste, and browned very well. My potatoes weren't soft enough, they had a funny taste, and were too strong flavored for me with half the cream cheese reccomended. Will try using broth next time...

I made this in a slow cooker.  It only took 2 hours on high.  I think it would turn out better in with a nice crisp top in the oven, but it was perfectly fine in the slow cooker.  I also added chopped onion and a bit more potato than called for.  Very nice, the whole family enjoyed this.

I have been looking for a scalloped potato recipe that was as good as Reser's Bistro potatoes which we get at Costco and this is it!  I left out the ham and peas and prepared it exactly as the recipe called for--absolutely great!  We were scraping the side of the dish after it was all gone!  Will be making this again soon!  Easy, tasty and so very creamy!

Made them for these for the guys at the fire house on my cook day. Everyone went back for seconds. Next time I would boil the potatoes for a little bit first so it wont take so long to cook in the oven. Will make again!!!

Just didn't have enough flavor for me. It's a good base for scalloped potatoes. Next time I will likely add onion and garlic.

This was excellent!  I followed one recommendation and substituted plain yogurt (greek) and left out the peas.  I added 1/2 onion thinly sliced and then quartered.

Delicious as is but my son will not eat peas mixed with his potatoes so My own little tweaks: simmer the potatoes in the broth and a little milk with garlic and onion to speed up cooking.  Then I add the sour cream cream cheese and cheddar to the hot potatoes, stir, pour in baking dish.  Bake 1/2 hour and top with grated parm/romano cheese. Back in oven for few minutes to incorporate the topping.. No ham and no peas.  Yum.

I used Velveeta instead of cheddar in the potatoes and just before they were done I topped them w/ some cheddar and swiss.  I also added some garlic powder, chopped onion and mustard.  These are amazing and I think this is how I'm going to make them from now on.  I also used fat free cream cheese and low fat mayo to lighten them up a little.  YUM!  Thanks!

better than my crock pot ones EVERY TIME, it's now the way I always make them! however, I am very against any uncooked or too hard potatoes and occasionally you get that open baking in the oven, where they cook too fast on top and bottom and some in the middle are more crunchy than I like. I have had some success sealing the top in tinfoil and taking it off for the last ten minutes or so for the cheese to brown, but my favorite way is to just boil the sliced taters until half done, drain the water and finish in the oven for the hour. Perfection every time!!!! I also double the cream cheese and sour cream because we like ours heavy on the sauce!

AMAZING!!  So easy and delicious!  I omited the peas (I'm not a pea fan) and added french fried onions to the top (Recommend to everyone).  It added extra flavor without overpowering the dish.  I also used a chicken boullion cube as I didn't have chicken broth on hand (worked great!).

Very creamy and flavorful dish.  Had to amend a bit.  Didn't have sourcream or ham so I used cream of mushroom soup and leftover J'Ville brats.

I didnt like it.  I followed the recipe exactly, the pototoes took way longer than an hour to cook.  If you like extra rich extra creamy extra cheesy dishes, this is the recipe for you.  Definitely not for me.

The cream cheese flavor was very strong in the otherwise bland sauce. Also, the potatoes took much longer than an hour to cook, even after parboiling them first. I will stick with the old cream-of-mushroom soup and hashbrown recipe from now on.

I tried to double the recipe but had no luck in getting all the potatoes cooked thru.  Then in reheating in microwave, they stayed hard :(

I made these to go with xmas dinner.  They were a hit!  Everyone loved them.  6 people ate almost 3/4 of this dish (along with the prime rib and the rest of the meal).

Fantastic!  Easy to make (no peas).  Added some green onion otherwise followed recipe.  Everyone loved this and I'll be making it again!
