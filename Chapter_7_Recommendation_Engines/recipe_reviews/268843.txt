Sooo good!  A bit spicy, so if you don’t care for heat, move along. This is not the recipe you’re looking for. My creole seasoning (Tony Cachere’s) is nicely spicy and salty, so omitted the red pepper and salt. Potatoes only needed 8 minutes on boil before adding the corn. At the end, set the raw shrimp on top of hot veggies so I could see that they were done. Will definitely make this again since my hubby loved it as much as I did. May add more shrimp. Would go well with a good bread and a salad with oranges, red onions and avocado. Thanks Ashley!

This was a really nice surprise.  I made this exactly as stated in the recipe but using cajun seasoning instead of creole.  Bursting with flavour and very simple to make.

Very, very good! Nice addition to the rotation! The only caution is that if using Tony Chachere’s for the creole seasoning (or similar brand), there is plenty of salt.  Don’t add extra. It will also be spicy so no need to add pepper flakes when cooking, people can add their own after to kick it up even more. I used red potatoes and could have cut back on cooking time a couple of minutes. Family loved it.  Also, I used regular beef (Pre-cooked) beef sausage and it was fine.  If you want to adjust heat/sodium there are easy recipes on this site.

Except for reducing the amount of Creole Seasoning from 3 tbsp to 2, I made this exactly as directed.  And my family loved it.

Great recipe framework.   Easy to modify everything from ingredients to adjusting the spices to suit your family and friends.  You can also adapt for Vegetarians, low sodium, low carbs...just keep an eye on what is in your fridge or shopping cart and you can please the crowd.
PS: Great the next day so do not be shy with quantities.

Made this as is and the whole family loved it. Next time, I might divide it into 2 sheet pans to get more char on it, but it was good as is. My 8 year-old daughter didn't like the andouille sausage, but it was pretty spicy. She LOVED the shrimp though amd her picky-eater dad and I like it all. This is definitely going in the dinner rotation!

Super easy and very good.  It was a bit spicy for my taste, but my husband thought it was awesome.  Will tone down the creole spice a little next time.  I used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning.  It makes a lot!

I left out the potatoes cuz the pan was already so full of food and we didn't need the added starch.  Family raved over this.  Thank you for the recipe!

I thought it was pretty tasty. Be forewarned, it makes a lot of food. I feed a family of 4 and we ate off of it for two days.

According to my husband, this was one of the best meals I’ve ever made!  Of course he loves spicy.  If you’re not into spicy, you may want to adjust the level of heat.  It was way too spicy for me!!!

Great recipe!  It is very spicy so if you don’t like the heat you may want to half the mixture.
