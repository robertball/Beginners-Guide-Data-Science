Loved the crunchiness and the toasted almonds.  I also added dried cranberries and thought they were delicious.  Really healthy eating really quickly!

I needed an Apple Carrot Salad recipe for 400 kids. Not only was this recipe a snap to make, it multiplied well and was extremely healthy. I did omit the almonds (in case of nut allergies) and replaced them with raisins. I thought the salad was delicious, the kids though it was pretty good, for something healthy.

This was OK.  I added raisins which was good.  Probably my biggest mistake was with the salt and pepper... I would just leave it out entirely.  I may try it again but this time I'll probably add some ginger.

We thought the honey made this salad a little too sweet for our taste so we used the leftovers in place of shredded carrots in a carrot cake recipe and had the yummiest carrot cake ever.

Very good flavor - sweetness of carrots, honey & apple.  Got limp pretty fast though.

Absolutely delicious!  May want to consider draining the shredded mixture before adding the honey and lemon juice and such.  Mine was just a little bit runny from the extra juices.

Love this. I spread this into a large Romaine lettuce leaf and call it carrot boats. My kids love this and it is a convenient food for travel. I noticed the type of honey I use changes the amount of sweetness. 
THANK YOU Colleen for sharing this recipe!

An extra apple and also almonds to the recipe. Also a 1/4 c dried cranberries.  By doing this a tartness was added to compliment the apples and honey. Very good.

This is better the next day after the flavors have mellowed.  It's a great summer salad, esp for those who dislike the kind with raisins.

Nice simple recipe...very fresh and clean.  I prepared it exactly as written and felt like it was missing something, so I added the juice from half a lemon and a pinky finger's worth of fresh grated ginger....added just enough extra oomph to satisfy.  The honey flavor is my favorite part though.  Will definitely make again.

I had my doubts about this carrot salad, but I really liked it. I omitted the almonds but followed the recipe otherwise. It just didn't seem like 8 servings to me. In fact, I made it into 2! ***I've made this salad numerous times, always using a sweet apple like honeycrisp and omitting the almonds. I believe it's my favorite carrot salad! I especially like that there's no mayo in it.

Excellent recipe! I used garlic salt and a bit of seasoning salt, mixed it with olive oil in a large freezer bag. Followed the directions and everything turned out perfect! Add whatever spices you like.

This recipe was excellent for me with a few changes.  I added a few raisins (cranberries would also be nice), a dash of ginger, and about 2 Tbs. of light mayo for a little creamy texture with the crunch.  I did omit the salt and pepper. Delicious.

very good!!! Simple and easy, and very low sodium if you leave out the nuts!
 A healthy sweet and sour.. will take away that chocolate craving in a minute!
Loved it!

I thought this was pretty good! Like someone else I thought the honey made it a bit too sweet so I added some plain nonfat yogurt and liked the little zip that provided. I also omitted the salt and pepper and added raisins. Thanks for the recipe.

For the simplicity of this, it is delicious. I left out the salt and pepper b/c I forgot! But it still tasted great. I didn't have almonds, so I added pecans. The only thing is, that it doesn't make a lot... so I added some grapes to it, too. I'm hoping my daughter will like it enough to take it to school! Thanks for the recipe.

I absolutely loved this salad, but they may be because I am a carrot lover. But anyways I watching my weight so I subbed the almonds for sesame seeds. But in the future plan to try the recipe with almonds!

What a great way to change up carrots!  I didn't add salt or pepper.  Craisins or raisins could have been good, but we all had seconds of just the apple with carrots and the honey/lemon juice dressing.  Some sprinkled almonds on top and some left it plain.  Will make again

This is good and simple to make. I omitted the almonds due to food allergies and added raisins as other suggested.  I used less honey than the recipe called for and it was still too sweet.  I’ll adjust that next time as I will be making this again.

This was just OK.  I shredded my carrots and apple by hand, and I think it would have been better to have used my food processor because it got mooshy.  We are so used to seeing raisins with this type of salad that it's hard to get past not using them.  The combination of apple and carrots is an interesting one.  Thanks for the idea of this.

A tasty simple recipe. Like some others, my family found this a bit sweet but I find the amount of sweetener required depends on the carrots.  I now use just under 1 Tbsp of Agave Syrup and add more after letting the flavours combine, if a sweeter taste is desired.

I made this recipe using the raisins instead of almonds. I also used fresh carrots from our garden. Although I enjoyed the recipe, my family didn't so much. I might try it again only I may add some ramen noodles for crunch next time.

Yummy! I’d did a couple of alterations. I purchased some date syrup in Israel on a recent trip, so used that instead of honey. Also added chopped, pitted dates! Worked very well!

I followed the recipe exactly and found the dressing to add little to the flavor. I let the carrots/apple marinate in the dressing all day and added the almonds just before serving. Barely tasted the apple. Probably could have doubled the dressing ingredients. I used matchstick carrots from the  produce section but grated the apple fresh.
I probably won't make this again.

I would say that this is a good salad as is, and worth a try. I added a pinch of ground ginger and about 1 Tbl of sesame seeds to make this even better. I used a slotted spoon to serve it because it does give off quite a bit of moisture. I will make this again for sure. It compliments the turkey meatloaf with quinoa from this site very nicely.

1.  Use a tad bit less honey.   2.  Use a tart apple.  I pref Granny Smith for this recipe.  3. A dollop of plain yogurt is great for those who want a creamy carrot salad.   4.  Don't make extra bc crispness is an important part of this recipe, and this salad gets limp overnight.

So nice to find a carrot recipe with no refined sugar. My 12 year-old son was skeptical at first. He and my husband both had second helpings. We like that there are almonds but no raisins.

The balance of honey and lemon juice took away the carott taste, and added a bitter taste. Overall, this recipe is a good carott diet.

This is delicious carrot salad.  I did add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and instead of the almonds, I added one half cup of raisins.  This was a nice addition to our meal.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Colleen.

This was super easy to make. I added 1 TBSP of apple cider vinegar for a little more tang, and 1/4 cup of raisins for sweetness. I used bagged shredded carrots so it didn't turn into mush as easily and just chopped the apple rather than shredding it. I'm definitely making this again.

My whole family loved this. Forgot to add salt and pepper but I don't think it needs it. I used agave nectar instead of honey. It is very good with raisins also, and I think it would be great with cranberries. I used two apples.

This salad is shredded carrots and apples, slivered almonds, and honey and lemon juice.  I didn't think it needed salt or pepper, as it had just the flavor I was looking for.  It’s fresh, low cal, low fat, and low carb.  Easy to make and such a nice option to the traditional mayo version.

Crunchy, tart and sweet. Excellent accompaniment to chicken breasts for a summer meal. 
Lacking lemons, I ended up substituting a combo of fresh squeezed orange juice and vinegar which worked quite well.

I like the almonds in this salad.  Very mild flavor; nice for children.

This was a great refreshing and healthy recipe. The apple really complement the carrots and the honey just brings it all together. I just tossed everything in the food processor, except the almonds, and pulsed a few times. I didn't blanch the almonds. I refrigerated it for a couple hours before serving and the almonds were soft by the time we ate it. I don't like raisins, but other people I served it to thought they would be a good addition. 
I'm planning on making this again for Thanksgiving to balance out the heavier dishes.

I made this recipe tonight and my whole family loved it - even the kid who doesn't like veggies! Simple to make with basic ingredients, but the result was complex and satisfying. We all agreed it was reminiscent of apple pie (maybe it was the apples and honey?) Will certainly make this again.

Wow, great fast salad!   I made it with walnuts instead of almonds and cut the honey in half and it turned out GREAT!  Thank you!

This was good.  I didn't have any almonds, so I used raisins.

We thought this salad was very bland. Really needs something, I just don't know what.

Not bad, not fantastic. I was the only one who touched it after one taste at dinner... Probably won't make it again, but thanks.
