I have made similar to this recipe for years now, but I precut the pastry before baking to a uniform size.This prevents breakage of pastry and the under-side is flatter which makes stacking easier.I also use less flour in the custard.Hope this helps others with assembling and presentation.

I saw another mille feuille online which calls for lesser plain flour, I reduced the plain flour to 4 tbsp. I used only 2 sheets of frozen pastry and it took only 10-12mins to bake. My advise is to cut it into serving size before dusting the sugar. Overall, it was presentable and taste yummy and worth a try.

I thought the custard tasted of flour. It wasn't very nice. Next time I will use a different pastry custard recipe. Overall, the dessert was OK.

okay, so ihave made some changes..
i used 4 tbsp of flour.
and i dip each baked pastry with meletd choc on the top.
i used sliced strawberry instead of any other fruit used in the original  recipe.
turned out great..but a very bad looking dessert.
all the pastry puffed and i cant put them in layers...the custard  run down .....>.

Yummy! I didn't have a vanilla bean or castor sugar so I followed an already tried-and-true recipe for pastry cream from here: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/pastry-cream-2/detail.aspx , which came out excellent. Followed the rest of this recipe and used raspberry preserves instead of apricot. Very good and my husband and friends loved it!

I made a bit different version of this recipe.  I used instant vanilla & pie pudding & strawberries. I drizzled it with a square of semi-sweet chocolate. Very good !
