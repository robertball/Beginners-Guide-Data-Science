Extremely sweet. I made another recipe almost identical to this but with a bit more pineapple juice. Both are very, very sweet. Next time I will try it without the sugar and only add a little at a time if needed. Thank you for the recipe.

I make this but I use a large can of pineapple juice and no sugar/ water mix. The bananas are the star of this punch.
