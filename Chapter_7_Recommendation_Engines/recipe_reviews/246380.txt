Thank you so much for this easy recipe.  I promised my husband and others working with him Reuben casserole for dinner & I forgot to get 1000 island at store.  I chopped up some sweet brine pickles I had canned last summer since no relish on hand.  Turned out great & made the casserole awesome.

I have never liked Thousand Island dressing, too sweet.  This was perfect and took minutes to make.  I will never buy store again for my husband.

My guys thought this was pretty good.  It lacks a little from some other recipes we tried but good in a pinch just the same.  Gets better if you let it sit a day or two before use.

I used our homemade green tomato relish and the horseradish and Worcester made it extra special. Perfect for Reubens!! Thanks

I made this just as the recipe said except for I cut it in half cuz it was just me. Instead of using horseradish I used Horsey Sauce. it's going to be yummy and my Ruben.
