This was alright.  It wasn't as good as I expected.  My only change was to add around 1 tsp. of garlic powder.  I probably will not be making this again.  It was just too bland for me. I will not be making this again.

We were skeptical as this dish was cooking, but have no fear, this was delicious! Didn't have Kaiser rolls, so we piled it on Texas toast and put them in the over open-faced, which browned the top nicely. 

It didn't look all that appetizing, but we were pleasantly surprized at how tasty this was--like a very cheesy cheeesburger.

This looked like "hamburger helper without the noodles on a bun."  Taste was okay. I think the meat mix could benefit from some spices, even though I did add a dash of garlic/onion powder when I added the soup...but it needed "more." The combination of the funky look and mediocre taste makes me wonder if I'll try this again. It wasn't bad but I think it needs a little more "Umph" to get me to make it twice. However, it was a snap to make!

Did not like this, at all. The mushroom flavour was overpowering, it was too bland, and crusty bread ended up going soggy!! That never happens! I highly recommend anyone skip out on this one, and I will not be making it again.

Adding a little beef base with water, then adding the mushroom soup and cooking down another 5-8 mins before adding the cheese seemed to help my ground round. I also added fresh garlic with the veggies. I think ground chuck or a good hamburger meat can make a great difference.
My husband thought it tasted like a ground beef "Philly Steak" sandwich.
Very, very tasty and a much better alternative to a sloppy joe!

Our family really enjoyed this recipe, but I did add to it for more flavor.  As a starting point it is great, but bland.  It needs salt and pepper to taste.  I also added a teaspoon of chopped garlic and 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce.  This gave it that philly cheesesteak flavor.  I am trying to watch my bread intake so my serving was baked in a yellow bell pepper.  I doubled the mushrooms as well as chopped the onions and peppers up real well so the kiddo wouldn't feel the need to pick them out.  (she didn't!)

Very good!  I used fresh mushrooms and added garlic.  The second time I made these, I didn't bake them, just toasted the buns and served open faced.  Added some pepper and spices too.  Really good!

This is a great to-go dinner. I made it one night before my husband and son left to go hunting.  I left the sandwiches wrapped in foil and placed them in a brown paper bag to go - they were still hot when they arrived and they both loved them.  It is now one of our family's favorites.

I DOUBLED THIS RECIPE USING A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO POUNDS OF HAMBUGER WITH TWO CANS OF SOUP, MINE WAS NOT RUNNY AT ALL, I DID NOT ADD THE MUSHROOMS AS I DIDNT HAVE ANY BUT WE REALLY LIKED IT, I DID ADD MINCED GARLIC (I DO TO JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING) SUPER EASY AND NOT A LOT OF WORK OR CLEANUP!

Surprisingly good1 I did modify it a little. I'm not big on mushrooms or cooked-in onions, so I left both out. I sauteed some peppers and fresh minced garlic and browned the meat in that. Once brown, I added the cr. of mushroom. I used onion buns and baked the open face style. I had the meat on one side and topped that with french fried onions. On the other side, I put the cheese. I baked it at 350 for about five minutes to crunch up the onions and melt the cheese. Really tasty! Tastewise, I'd give four stars (because I like to reserve five for really outstanding dishes). However, it's so quick, easy, and FILLING, that it gets five stars!!!

I thought this was really good and so simple. The only thing I added was some garlic powder. Will definitely make again, and maybe will try it with some type of noodles instead of making sandwiches, just for something different.

I decided to go for it, but instead of the mushroom soup( my family isnt a fan of it) I used velveeta cheese and fresh mushrooms that we sauteed in a bit of garlic and butter.. But all in all, it was very tasty. Thank you.

All six of us loved this.  It's a keeper.  I am not sure why people said that it was mushy.  Mine was perfect!  Only thing I did was a fresh black pepper to mine.

We really liked this one!  I adjusted the seasonings to my family's taste.  Also, I noticed that several other reviewers just toasted the rolls instead of wrapping the sandwiches and putting them in the oven.  That worked out perfectly for my family, as everyone likes a different amount of filling on their rolls. I have made this recipe several times and it is fast, easy, and very tasty!

Well, I'm certainly glad I didn't skip out on this recipe like others suggested. With a little loving care and some much needed seasonings, these turned out really well. I didn't see the need to assemble and wrap the sandwiches in foil, so I just toasted the buns and everyone made their own sandwich. I don't like canned mushrooms, so I sauteed fresh with the onion and pepper. Thank you Allison!!

I have a husband and 4 kids ages 9,7,4,and 2 and we all love this recipe. One thing I have found is that alot of people complained it was soggy but I solved that. The secret is to use cheep and thin tin foil if it is too thick they turned out soggy.

I thought something that called for so much cheese couldn't possibly turn out wrong, but I was mistaken. Maybe there was something wrong with my method, but the filling was entirely too runny and pretty bland. I'm not even certain that adding some spices to the beef could improve this recipe.

I didn't add the mushrooms but did everything else per recipe.  It's really good, not great but I will be making again.  Oh, I did add some minced garlic but I always add garlic to ground beef.  So to sum up, this is easy and tasty.  We ate it all.

This was pretty good. In the middle. I went ahead and added 1 tsp of garlic powder as others had done. Next time I don't think I will. I also didn't use a can of mushrooms, so I don't think what I did was true to form. Still, I will probably make it again. Thanks.

This was a very good starter idea.  I seasoned the beef as I browned it with garlic, seasoned salt and some Montreal Steak Seasoning.  I skipped the green pepper, because I don't like it and used fresh mushrooms. I also used the regular Grands biscuits (not the flaky layers) that I had on hand.  I cooked them up and hollowed them out.  Whatever we didn't eat at supper, I rewarmed for leftovers for myself the next day.  They got a little soggy, but they were so good it was worth it!  I love cheese, but didn't use quite the whole 2 cups.   This will definitely be made again at my house!!

My family really liked the recipe, but I added about a 1 1/2 tsp Mrs. Dash for a little bit of spice as my husband likes spicy things.  It also worked well for a cooking group that I am part of, however I did not stuff the buns prior to freezing.  In the summer, they work well to heat them on a low grill outside instead of in the oven and create extra heat.

YUM!
