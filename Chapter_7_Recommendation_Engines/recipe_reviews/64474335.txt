I hit enter before finishing my review.  What I was going to say is this recipe is easy to play around with ingredients.  The must haves are the pasta, Worcheshire, garlic, the two soups and sour cream.  Those are a must, but you can play with the rest.  This recipe is the perfected one, but for a new cook, you can try it simple and it is still absolutely delicious.  I have even used hamburger or no meat at all.  My favorite pasta to use is either angel hair or fettuccine, but you can use whatever you like.  Itâ€™s all GOOD!

Once discovered, this 2-pan recipe could easily become a staple.  Dress it up as you wish (spicy, savory, etc,), the base recipe is solid on its own.  Don't forget the bay leaf.
