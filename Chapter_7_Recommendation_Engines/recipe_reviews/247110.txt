Used prepared curry powder about 1 1/2 T rather than individual spice ingredients (for speed and convenience) and the diced tomatoes; also added green pepper and fresh mushrooms.  This turned out wonderful.  I did not put the eggs in the sauce rather placed them on top of the rice and spooned the sauce over.  Beautiful presentation, great aroma and flavor.

As this recipe is stated, I rate it four stars. Good, but not perfect. Some of the other comments suggest adding some other veg, I also recommend this. Made as instructed, this is a very onion heavy dish. It would definitely benefit from  some addition of peppers and diced tomatoes without changing the nature of the dish over much. I will be making it again. Also, a Punjabi friend suggested to use lemon juice and not vinegar, but that may be a regional thing.

I used chopped tomatoes and 2 oz of tomato paste  (didn't have puree), afterward noticed the cook's note that you can just used chopped tomato, so next time I'll leave out the paste.  I thickened it a little with a tsp of cornstarch in a little bit of cold water.   As suggested, I served it over rice.   When I make this again (and I will), I'll try one of the reviewers suggestions to use prepared curry powder.   I was reluctant to tell my husband what was for dinner, because he can be a little picky, but he LOVED this.  I think it could use a little more spice; I thought it was just a tad bland, but it may be that I used so much tomato that it watered it down.  This will be on the regular rotation for Meatless Monday.  It was good.

I made this and it was divine. It took no time at all and we couldn't believe how great it was. This is about to become one of my regular weekly staples.

I took the submitters advice and used tomatoes since I didn't have tomato puree on hand. The blend of spices resulted in great flavor. Next time I'll top this with some Sriracha.

This was good! On the advice of other commenters I threw in some additional veggies--frozen peas, and some mushrooms I happened to have in the fridge. I also used a can of diced tomatoes in addition to a small can of tomato sauce (I don't find a huge difference between tomato puree and tomato sauce besides cost, myself, so I nearly always use plain tomato sauce when puree is called for). I always have a jar of ginger garlic paste in the fridge, so I used a nice dollop of that instead of separate ginger paste and garlic paste. I left out the black pepper because not everyone here likes things hot. Next time I might cut down the coriander just a bit, and honestly I can't help wondering how this would taste with a can of coconut milk.

Really delicious, especially if you're low on groceries. The best part about curry is that if you're familiar with making it, you know that you can substitute or add any ingredients you have on hand.

One word:  delicious!    I absolutely love anything curry ... this is going to be a repeat.   

I didn't have the garlic and ginger pastes - so I used my usual curry seasoning  with some extra ginger ... turned out great.  (I ordered those two items for next time.)
