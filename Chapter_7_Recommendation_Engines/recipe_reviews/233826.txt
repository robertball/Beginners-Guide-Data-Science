I have been cooking corn like this for years but I do it in the microwave. Do not do with plastic in the microwave use glass or ceramic that can stand higher heats. Melt butter in microwave in glass container add sugar heat again. (Microwaves vary too much to put exact times so you just have to watch it until you know your microwave.) Add corn and cook until heated through. Do not overcook. Best canned corn I have ever found is Walmart brand yellow corn no salt added. Better than anyone else's canned or frozen corn! I also add a touch of garlic powder but I love garlic.
