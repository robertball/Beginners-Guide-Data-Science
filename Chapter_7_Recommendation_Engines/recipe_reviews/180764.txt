This recipe is delicious! I decided to bake instead of broil - 375 degrees for 30-40 minutes worked well.  I doubled the sauce recipe and it gave it a good amount of flavor. I also made cuts into the Salmon so that the sauce/ glaze could flavor the inside of the meat.  I served it with Jasmine rice & mixed vegetables and it was a delicious meal!

Use honey instead of brown sugar, add some soy sauce, use dry prepared mustard and you have the exact recipe that Windsor Court Grill Room uses for their Honey Mustard Glazed Salmon

This was delicious.  I love salmon so I'm always looking for ways to prepare it.  This was simple to make and kept the flavor of the glaze.  We put it atop a lightly greased broiler pan (a little water on bottom pan to help steam it) and it baked for about 11 min's.  We also used a d.j. mustard with 'honey' in it which was a compliment to the brown sugar...Yum.

If you add about 1/2 cup of Jack Daniels whiskey, a little minced garlic, and a tsp of lemon juice to the base recipe marinade, it takes an already great recipe and makes it outstanding!!

Excellent! My husband and I loved this recipe. Very easy to make. Don't forget to foil your pan since the brown sugar burns on the pan and some of it does run off as cooking.

This is a recipe I'll make again for sure!  Not only is it quick and easy, but the flavors are perfect together.  I didn't pay this recipe very much attention until I saw it printed on a card on the counter where I buy my fish--which also happens to be a very popular fish restaurant in my area.  If I change anything, it may be just to bake it at 425 rather than broil it.  Thanks!  UPDATE:  I baked it at 400 for about 15-18 minutes, and we liked it best that way.  Very good!

I have to confess that I was a little skeptical about this recipe at first because the basic ingredients are only dijon mustard and brown sugar, but it was very taste. I marinated for 1 hour and we grilled instead of broiling because we prefer this way.

This was VERY good but I added extra dijon mustard--big mistake!  I thought it would run off and make a sauce but it didn't.  Live and learn I guess.  Definately try this recipe!

This recipe is great. It's so fast becuase there's no marinating yet it's packed full of flavour. I love it! My 2 yr old son will even eat it. I serve it with rice and asparagus.

Very good but never cook fish until it "flakes easily". It flakes easily when it's DRY. It should gently pull apart when pulled with a fork and still look moist without looking wet. With experience you'll know.

This is a must try! I use to hate salmon and Dijon mustard but this has become a weekly dinner in my house. Is even great left over the next day. I  do not broil mine though. I cook it for about 30 min in a 350 degree oven! Love love love!!!

It was a lazy Snday afternoon when dinner was upon me.I had taken out the salmon and saw this recipe for it last night. I put the sauce together and forgot to add the S & P. I poured the sauce on and nuked it for 10 mins. The family ate the whole thing!  The sauce was Delish! Quick, easy peasy and Yummy! THANK YOU Tamara!! I will keep this in rotation.

The recipe is very good!  Thanks for that.  The picture, on the other hand, looks like open heart surgery, or maybe a liver transplant.  Honestly, who in their right mind would put that picture on here.

Edit to say ... thank goodness they changed the picture!  Now it looks as good as it tastes.  :-)

I made this last night, and it was delicious! Next time I will make a double batch to coat the salmon even more.  It made a nice thin crunchy little "crust" on top, but my salmon was so thick that I wished I had used more.  Will definitely make this again, it was too easy!

Loved this recipe.  Used brown sugar with splenda to cut the calories.  Baked it instead of broiling for 25 minutes covered with foil and then broiled for 4 minutes. Delish.

Winner, winner salmon dinner.  This was delicious and my 4.5 year old son loved it!  I followed the ingredients for the recipe exactly, and used two salmon fillets, just shy of a pound.  I had to adjust the cooking method, because I tend to overcook things when I broil them.  I wrapped the fillets in silver foil, placed them in a pan, and cooked for about 23 minutes at 400. Superb.  Thanks Tamara for a great recipe!

Amazingly easy and seriously delicious! The only change I made was using spicy brown mustard instead of dijon cause that's what I had on hand. This is my new favorite salmon recipe!!

This is a surprisingly tasty recipe, given how few ingredients there are in it. We had it for dinner tonight and it is quick to make, and delicious. Next time, I am going to add some garlic, just for an extra zing. Thanks for sharing Tamara.
P.S. I made this recipe again and this time used honey for the brown sugar as other reviewers have suggested, added 1 clove of minced garlic and 1 tbsp of soya sauce, marinated the salmon in the mixture for 2 hours and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. A very good variation.

My whole family loved this!  Simple and delicious!  We grilled the salmon on a cast iron griddle and served it with green beans with satueed garlic mushrooms and bread.

This is my husband's rating. He really liked the glaze and wished it could have been applied thicker without falling off. I, however, wouldn't rate it a 4 because I simply don't like salmon, and the smell about killed me as I was cooking it. ALSO, use foil! I didn't, and my pan will never be the same. I will admit though, the glaze was quite tasty to get me through it. (I can't wait until people quit giving us free salmon! Can't they give us tilapia or something?)

I added a squeeze or two of honey to this, used about 1/2 tsp mustard powder, a squirt of yellow mustard (since that's all I had) and I added a little bit of minced garlic and a "tinse" of lemon juice. Cut some slits in the fish to let the glaze run through, and put a layer of tin foil on the bottom of the pan. Marinated about 10-15 minutes. Really tasty! Next time, I'll try substituting some honey instead of the brown sugar instead of adding it, since it made the sauce a bit too sweet. Thanks!

Followed recipe exactly... but it doesn't specify what temp for the broiler. I put it on medium and after 4 minutes there was a horrible burned smell. All the glaze was burning! After 10 min everything touching the sugar was charred and the salmon was a little dry. Not a bad idea but I think it would be better to have baked it first, then broilit a minute or two.

This is my new favorite way to eat salmon!  The easiest recipe EVER, and the flavor is so multi-dimensional!  I doubled the sauce and that was probably too much, but better that way than too little.  Also I'm intimidated by the broiler so I wrapped the fillets in foil packets and stuck them in the oven at 400 for about 40 minutes (they were thick).  Amazingly moist, tangy, sweet fish that I will dream about tonight!

I have a little foodie in my house and he doesn't like traditional kid fare and is a very slow eater. I don't think I've ever seen him eat something fast, but I think I blinked and his plate was clean! I will do this for him again and again and again...

This was a fantastic recipe! My girlfriend and I were looking for a simple way to make some tasty salmon, and I don't think we could have chosen a better recipe. An exceptional dijon mustard is highly recomended.

The broiling didn't work for me, after a few minutes the sugar started burning and it was not cooked all the way through. BUT, I reduced the heat to 320, covered it on foil and stick it back to the oven .... it was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!! thanks for the recipe...will do again baked not broiled. :)

for some reason the glaze kind of dried up and got sticky in the over...I was expecting more of a barbecue glaze kind of texture but it got so viscous that i didnt enjoy it. My boyfriend loved it. I will try baking it a at a lower temperature.

Delicious!  I loved the flavor this had.  I did 3 salmon filets but kept the same amount of sauce.  I only had honey mustard though instead of dijon but it was still very delicious.  Will do again!

I typically make the recipe for balsamic glaze salmon found on this website (also outstanding) but decided to give this a try after receiving it in an email today.  It was a great alternative to one of our favorite dishes and definitely a keeper.  Highly recommended.

I dislike salmon...easily my least favorite fish! YET I tried this and my family LOVED it! I baked it in the oven at 375 for about 25 minutes. Sadly I forgot to spray my foil lined pan so dealt with some sticking (totally my fault!) yet the end results were flavorful, a little sweet, and my 7 and 4 year old cleaned their plate! This one is certainly a keeper!

Holy moly.  The ingredients made me wonder how in the world this could be so amazing... but I promise you.  This is the easiest and most delicious recipe in my repertoire!!  Follow the instructions exactly, do not deviate and you will have the most tender and flavorful salmon!!  Just the right amount of sweet, and I love that the broiler crisps the edges just perfectly.  Warning:  it stinks like you would not believe while preparing and cooking, but do not be fooled by the stench!  My entire family gobbles it up and my husband gives me that look of adoration that he only gets when eating for some reason (lol).  Thank you SO much for this outstanding and easy recipe!!

I was unsure about the dijon and brown sugar together - interesting mix of ingredients!  Tried this and we enjoyed it.  I did bake my salmon at 400 instead of broiling it.  Served with Lemon Basmati Rice from AR and some steamed carrots/broccoli.  Great meal!

This was easy but was a little sweet for us. Follow the instructions - we bought wild caught sockeye salmon which was really red, and I kept thinking it was underdone and kept cooking it until we killed it.

Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best!  You really can't beat this for a quick and delicious topping for salmon.  The sweetness and little bit of spice from the mustard go great with the strong flavor of salmon.

Excellent sauce but needs to be doubled. I'll remove skin next time and coat both sides. Broiling also left very little sauce, so I'll bake at 350  and seal in foil for a moister salmon. Everyone loved the sauce.

A little too sweet for me and I think the sugar kind of burned slightly on the fish...however...the texture and taste of the salmon was excellent once I scraped off the parts that burned a bit.

A little less cooking time...got really done in only 15 minutes in the lower oven...Broiled for 5 minutes and then baked at 350 for 10 mins and it was much better this time

This was so yummmmmmmm!  after reading a few reviews i decided to also add a little dried mustard and a little soy sauce...a little goes a long way to alter the flavor from the original recipe. It was a crowd pleaser and can't wait to cook it again!

I do the same recipe but omit mustard (don't like) and use teriyaki sauce instead. I also cut into the salmon and rub the sugar-sauce in and broil exactly 12 min. I serve with rice on the side...so delish :)

I fixed it just like it said and was really great. I served it with a side salad of fresh greens of choice, sliced beets on top and French dressing. So easy and so great.

So simple and tasted really good!  A hit with my whole family--even my picky 3 yr. old!  Made exactly as the recipe says, and served with rice and broccoli as suggested.  A FAST dinner that seems like you fussed even though you didn't.

This was very tasty and VERY easy.  I used the recipe calculator to reduce the servings to two. I rubbed the fillets with a slice of lemon, sprinkled on some dry dill weed along with the salt & pepper, covered them with the sauce and baked them for the full 40 minutes.  Served with buttered noodles, steamed snow peas and decorated the plates with lemon twists. Pineapple wedges & red seedless grapes were dessert.

Made as directed. Came out excellent! Simple, but very tasty. The brown sugar and Dijon mustard are the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. The sauce would also top any variety of meat; be it chicken, steak or pork; very well! I loved this and will be making it again.

I make this recipe often.  My 8 year old son always asks for it.  It is such an easy recipe.  I make mine a little different.  I coat the salmon with a thin layer of dijon mustard and then I pack brown sugar on each fillet. Putting a little water in the pan also makes for extra glaze.  Delicious!

We love this recipe! I used the listed amount of sauce on 1 pound odf salmon. The only change I made was to bake at 400 for 25 minutes, instead of broiling. It turned out perfectly!

I quite enjoyed this recipe!  The only differences I did was use salmon steaks (they were on sale), some chopped chives, and a bit of melted butter for a nice toasty skin.

Super easy & amazing taste.  I followed original recipe without changes.  My 4 year old kept asking for more!  

A few tips:
  
(1) If broiling, set the rack in second from the top level because the broiling pan will give it extra height and you don't want to burn the glaze.  It took about 10 minutes to cook.  I poured a little water in the broiling pan and just used Pam to spray the grill, no need for aluminum foil.  Broil on LOW.
  
(2)  I made this recipe for 3 average size fillets and coated most of the top with glaze.  Although delicious, I think mine could have used more glaze coated thoroughly and perhaps letting it fall into the sides of fillet.  So for me, it wouldn't be enough glaze for 4 servings, just make more.

Great recipe, thanks!!!

Oh My! Okay if you are not used to broiling- be VERY careful... I hadn't even hit the recommended time for broiling, and I smelled smoke. Opened the stove to have the classic "cooking for my boyfriend for the first time and lit the kitchen on fire" moment.

This was absolutely delicious! I had never really cooked fish before so I was a bit nervous I would mess something up but it was perfect! And very easy, particularly for a beginner like me. I followed some of the previous reviews and baked it at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. I used a clear 13x9 baking pan and laid down foil first. When my husband and I went to lift it out of the pan, the skin came right off (and onto the tin foil, thank goodness)! I got two fresh, rather large filets from the Publix seafood counter - one side still had the skin and I cooked it skin-side down, no problems. I also put about a 1/4 cup of water into the pan with the fish. This will certainly be a repeated go-to in the future! (Oh! I also used dijon mustard with honey.)

Simply delicious!  Extremely easy. 1 1/2 times the topping to coat an entire fillet.  The most moist salmon I have ever had and my mustard-hating, fish-denigrating son really likes it!  Ha!

We're big salmon people and love this combination here. It felt odd at first mixing mustard with the brown sugar, but it makes for an excellent glaze. Also, quick and simple!!

This is my new favorite salmon recipe! Sooo good! I used honey dijon because that is what I had in the fridge. I probably will make more glaze when I make this for my husband as I used 3/4 of the glaze on one fillet (just for me!)-- the extra sauce is so good! I served it on top of jasmine rice.

Iv made this twice now, very tasty! I can even get my fussy non-salmon eater to say he really likes this! It's a tinge to sweet for me, I'm gonna try and add a bit more mustard next time. I also just bake this, 5 mins at 375, flip over, slather with sauce and throw it back in for 5 minutes.

Very easy and very delicious. The sweetness in the brown sugar counters the spicy Dijon mustard nicely, leaving a sweet, flavorful glaze that was so good.
Definitely put foil on your pan - cooking spray is no match for the sticky sugar.
Next time I think I'll let this marinate for a few hours to let the flavors really permeate the fish.

It was good don't get me wrong. Very easy as well. The salmon itself was bland though. The glaze provided some flavor to the outside however not enough to make the entire fish taste good. I think I would marinade it first. Hubby said it was a little sweet but he is more of a savory person, he still liked it though. It was a nice change in pace:)

Absolutely delicious! I used 1/2 of a freshly caught Coho and it was a big fish so it took more like 20 minutes to broil. Also followed the advice of other readers and added a splash of lemon juice and soya sauce as well as a wee bit minced garlic. Definitely will make again!

Very simple and easy, I only made two servings and gave the recipe four stars because if I woud have left my fish under the broiler for 10-15 minutes I would have had a charred mess.  Mine only took 6 minutes.  Great flavor with simple ingredients, but watch your fish individually under the broiler carefully.

Great recipe. The flavor is perfect. I cooked with Tilapia instead of Salmon and it was a good substitute. I would definately make this again.

I didn't care for the dijon mustard, so I modified this one --- I used about a 1/4 c of Alaskan Sourdough Salsa and same for the brown sugar, then broiled under low flames for about 10 minutes ..... OMGoodness!  Moist, delicious, and the glaze was nice.  A definite treat!!

We liked this alot!  It was quick, easy, and tasty.  I took the advise of another reviewer and baked it at 375 for about 30 minutes.  It literally melts in your mouth!

I followed the recipe exactly.  Broiling the salmon kind of carmelizes the brown sugar on top.  Yummy! This is so good!  My husband usually has to choke down his fish, because he doesn't care for fish.  But he raved about this dish and even took leftovers for lunch!  I served it with rice and sauteed zucchini, mushrooms and red onion.

Very good!  My only suggestion would be to reduce the cooking time to 7-9 minutes.  We had large filets and 10 minutes was too long.

This was good, quick and easy.  I did have to mix up my own Dijon mustard because I didn't have any and that recipe turned out to be quite spicy but I don't think it hurt this recipe at all.  It gets 5 stars because my extremely picky 4-year-old ate it with no coaxing or bribery!!

Excellent Flavor..my only problem was when broiling it burned and started smoking before fish was done...I will probably bake it next time or cook half way flip and put the sauce on.  We loved it otherwise.  Thanks

Utterly scrumptious! I baked salmon instead of broiling (375 deg. about 35 min.).  I've made it several times now and need to wait awhile, as I don't want to "OD" on it! After the first time, I made extra sauce and spooned it over -- sweet but tangy. Wonderful!

This recipe was great!  I did double the sauce recipe, and added water to the broiling pan.  Made some Garlic Redskin Smashed Potatoes with this.  Big hit!

I have a similar recipe, only I add dill (1T).  If you double the glaze recipe, with dill, and keep half aside and add 1/2 c mayo it's a great sauce for the table.

REALLY easy. I should have checked after 10 min as I over cooked even on Lo broil but the flavor was great. My husband is not a fan of mustard but the brown sugar mellowed it out perfectly.

Tremendous! I added a splash of soy sauce and marinated the salmon in the glaze for an hour before cooking. Also added a touch of dill. A fantastic way to boost salmon into the realm of OMG I CANT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS IS!

This is so quick and easy. To help remove fishy taste I thaw or soak it first in buttermilk. Then we like citrus on fish so I put orange slices on top while baking. It gives the smallest hint of orange with all the sweetness. I serve with rice and sugar snap peas.

This is a great recipe, but if you will marinade overnight and add 1 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup soy sauce and fresh chopped chived, you will enjoy it even more.  One of the few recipes for fish that does not taste fishy even when it's cold.

I only give this 3 stars because, like JoeB, my salmon burned to a crisp!  And I even measured the distance from the heating source beforehand.  Next time I'll grill it --- even with the coating burned, the salmon was juicy and had a great taste.  I'll make it again.  Also, I used wild salmon, which is probably a better taste to start with.

This is now my go to recipe for a quick salmon dish. Really, really good. I really didn't change a thing, though I was mindful of a reviewer saying there was too much mustard taste for her, and made sure the fillets were coated with a thin layer of Dijon. Served it with jasmine rice and a cucumber salad with rice vinegar and sesame oil. Very fast and tasty.

Absolutely fabulous!! My boyfriend said he would eat this every night. I broiled 2 8 oz filets for 15 minutes and it was a perfect glaze. So so easy as well! This is a great dinner in less than 20 minutes. This is a keeper for sure. THANK YOU Tamara!

This recipe is so good that my mouth waters every time I think of it! I added a little lemon juice and Jack Daniel's (like another review suggested) and it came out great. I'm so impressed that I've even passed this recipe around. One problem I had was the glaze dripped off the sides of the fish and burned to the metal pan I was using, so next time, I'll use foil to avoid the mess and the burned glaze smell. Anyway, it was fantastic, fast, and easy!

Wow!!!!! So easy and amazingly delicious! The only thing I did differently was I wrapped the salmon in foil and baked at 400 for 15 minutes. Everyone loved it, and I'm totally in love with how easy this was. Definitely making this again!

This recipe was sooo good yet super easy too! I seasoned my salmon with garlic salt, pepper, and smoked paprika. I got more creative with the glaze though. I used mostly dark brown sugar but also added about a tablespoon each of honey and organic agave nectar. (We like it sweet in my house! ) I also did not have any Dijon mustard in hand so i just used plain old yellow mustard. At the suggestion of another user, i cut a few slits into the salmon to let the glaze get into it more. I cooked the fish 24 mins in a foil lined dish and covered with foil as well. I broiled it on low for an additional 3 minutes. Super fast and delicious meal. My favorite comment on dinner: "I've never had fish like this. It's amazing! " Thanks for a great recipe. Definitely going into regular rotation!

I made it as recipe stated but doubled the sauce, which turned out to be unnecessary and a waste. This was really delicious and my 2 & 4 year each ate a 6oz piece by themselves. My 4year asked for the leftovers for dinner the next day which is even more amazing. Neither boy likes mustard so I was worried they wouldn't like the taste but they both loved it and gobbled it up. I baked my at 425 for about 15 mins. Thanks for a keeper!

Super easy and fast. I used the helpful reviewer, Ashley's advice, and baked it instead of broiled it. I find broiling creates lots of smoke, and I'm not sure how to ever avoid that.

Really good flavor!  Will make again.  Used the baking option of 375 for 30 minutes and fish was rather over done.  Would bake again but not for the full time.

This is so good! Ive made it twice. Both times i changed the ingredients to 2 servings but i really should not have. We wanted more sauce. I will double a full serving next time. I also added 1/2 T of jack daniels this time as suggested by a reviewer and it was perfect. Dont decrease the sauce! And use fresh salmon!

Couldn't grill because of rain, so needed a quick recipe to do inside.  Only change I made was to add a little soy sauce.  Great flavor!

Easy to make and delicious!  We made it made it in a pan on the stovetop with a bit of water to poach the fish first then put the sauce on after the fish was turned over.  Turned out great!!

My kids love salmon, and they said this was the best I've ever made.  I doubled the sauce, based on another review, but I don't think it needed it (a lot of runoff).  I also slashed the salmon which seemed to work well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I admit I did season the fish some with spices and rub a little lime in it prior to the mustard sugar glaze. This came out so good my husband begged for seconds.

It was pretty good. Don't like it too much with Salmon though. My hubby said it was a little too mustardie, I didn't mind b/c I love mustard! We broiled it for like 7 min then turned oven to bake 400 degrees b/c the glaze was starting to burn and the fish turned out cooked perfect.

This is so simple yet so delicious!!!  The glaze works magic with the salmon, and I actually followed the "How to Cook Salmon" video also on this site.  I've cooked it many times before, but it didn't wow me.  This cooking method and these ingredients WOWed my whole family!  It was so flavorful!  Definitely a keeper if you want young children to try this super healthy fish.

I just made this dish. One word - AMAZING. I baked it at 400 degrees for 15 min instead of broiling but that was the only change. The family absolutely loved it - so easy. This is definitely a keeper.

Great recipe. We didn't change anything and have had it several times now with great results. I do not like mustard so I was slightly apprehensive but the end flavor is sweet with just a little tang. Very good!

Fantastic recipe. Made it for friends & it turned out great. Did double the sauce & marinated it in the fridge for a few hours. Great, easy recipe!

I made this dish last night for my husband and I, and it was a hit with a few minor additions. I added a little bit of garlic, lemon zest, and about a 1/2 cup of Wild Turkey American Honey Bourbon (I have a serious sweet tooth) to the base recipe and let the salmon marinate for a few hours. I baked the salmon at 375 for 30 minutes in foil pouches with a few apple slices and a little additional pepper and it turned out great!! It was something my husband said he'd definitely eat again. :)

This was a good, easy salmon recipe! Nice flavor without being too sweet. I used a red onion, and wish I would've let it cook on the sauce pan for longer than 15 minutes to make it softer.

Quite delicious. Wild caught salmon is preferred but, farm raised will even take to this glaze very well.

Don't skimp on the pepper, use fresh ground, even found in the Dollar Store, it helps to accent the tart of the mustard and offset the sweetness of the sugar.

Don't overcook your salmon - better rare then well done...

As a side dish I made the most delicious Oven Roasted Asparagus recipe.

This recipe has great potential, but it was not a home run for me. The flavor combinations are great, but it was not strong enough for me. Next time I will either marinade the salmon in the glaze for a bit or slice the top of the fillets as someone else suggested and see if that helps the flavors sink in more.

YUM, YUM, YUM - this one was great.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce.  I also added some honey and some soy sauce, so technically I change the recipe quite a bit, but this was a GREAT base to get my ideas rolling.  And broiling was definitely the way to go cooking the salmon - it was cooked to perfection!

Very good, but because the sugar was burning I had to halve the broil time and finish baking the fish in 350 degree oven.  Next time I'm going to make it on the grill.
Update: Made the salmon on the grill tonight and it was perfect.

Wanted something simple yet good and this fit the bill!  Mustard gave it a nice tang next to the sweetness of the sugar.  Will keep this in my repertoire!   I Will try another reviewers suggestion to add garlic and lemon juice for a variation.

I accidentally used half of the mentioned amount of dijon mustard and commented when it was done that it was amazing and it wasn't too mustardy compared to the honey-dijon salmon that I usually make. I would definitely recommend this but cut the mustard amount in half.

Delicious! My 1st attempt at salmon and yummo. I was out of Dijon, so I used regular yellow mustard. Maybe a little less brown sugar next time but good recipe. Thanks : )

I couldn't decide between 4 or 5 stars, but due to its simplicity, I gave it 5 stars.  Next time I will try some of the additions other reviewers have suggested.  I really did love how quick it is - no marinating time and broiling is a snap.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good salmon recipe.  I love the broiler induced crust.  Maybe next time I will add some ginger.  I think that would set it off.

Very quick and easy to prepare. Tastes great! My kids all enjoy salmon and two out of three were happy with this. It does have an unusual look when finished and I think that was the main turn off for son number three.

This was very good - I triple-the recipe because I had 1.5lbs of salmon to cook and it was just a little too sweet. I would recommend increasing the proportion of mustard to brown sugar for large batches. But overall this is a keeper.

We just finished having this wonderful Salmon recipe with baked Sweet Potato and vegetable medley and it was fantastic!  I love Salmon but wanted to try it with a different taste.  This hit the spot!  Thank you Tamara...  you gave us a winner!  Cook it just like it is written or use the other suggestions...  You wont be disappointed!

My mom liked it. I didn't. The  mustard and brown sugar just didn't pair well with the Salmon..in my opinion. (So I am rating it based on what my mom said.)

This was excellent!  I don't usually like salmon because of the fishy taste.  The brown sugar and dijon mustard glaze took this taste away.  The combination of the two ingredients was great.  I did put the fish too close to the broiler and the sugar started to burn, so make sure you put the fish at least 6 in away.

Delicious. I also doubled the sauce, using half brown sugar and half honey, plus a couple tablespoons soy sauce. I broiled in oven.

Excellent as written.  Everyone in the family loved it.  It is now my favorite salmon recipe- both for taste as well as ease of preparation. There is absolutely no reason to tinker with this recipe.  No need to marinate, add seasonings, or otherwise alter this recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love Love love this recipe.  It is so simple and as my husband said 'tastes outstanding!'  I did change just 2 things.  I added a little butter to the sauce mixture and I baked it instead of broiling it.  375 for about 40-45 minutes.  Turned out great.

This is so delicious!  My husband really wanted to try a salmon recipe with brown sugar.  I was worried that it would be way too sweet for my taste buds, but with the dijon!!  Mmmnnn soooo yummy.  We didn't change anything on the recipe, and I think I will keep it that way. :)  Thank you for the great idea!

Not bad at all!  I think it would taste better with a little something to balance out the sweetness ... maybe soy, something salty.  Also might add a little cayenne for some kick.

Fantastic. My husband and I splurged on the good Salmon at Costco. I did double the sauce, because we love sauce. I also added some soy sauce to it like someone else suggested. Just a dash. I did broil it, and that made the sauce like candy on top. My husband that doesn't eat much fish, sure gobbled it down. Will pass this one along. Marcie

This was absolutely amazing! I baked mine for 15 minutes and it was perfect. However, the dijon mustard I used was a bit too piquant for my 18 mth old. Will definitely make again for guests, though.

Thank you for such a delicious, simple recipe!  I made this for my family, and we all loved it.  My husband and son love salmon, but I'm not too fond of it.  I usually end up eating a few bites, then giving the rest to one of them.  Not this time!  I ate it!  It sounds almost too simple to be good--but it is great!  I followed your ingredients exactly.  I did bake instead of broiling, but only because my vegetable and baked rice were already in the oven.  Wonderful!

This was exceptional, especially considering how simple it is. I didn't think I would like it that much, but I loved it. Instead of using the broiler, I baked at 400 degrees for 10-15 minutes. (I had another dish baking, that's why I did it differently.) Great way to make salmon.

Salmon is my husbands favorite and this was a really good recipe. I thought I had the correct mustard, but since I did not I used a brown spicy mustard instead and it tasted very good. My favorite part-VERY EASY!

This is an awesome recipe!! I don't usually like dijon mustard, but it was really good with the brown sugar and salmon. I used thawed salmon filets that were fairly thin and baked them at 375 for about 10 mins. and then finished them under the broiler for another 5 mins. or so...they turned out perfect! My five year-old loved it, too! I will definitely be making this often!

Why oh why would you ever order it at a resturant when you can make it at home better.  This is great! A keeper and a crowd pleaser.  So so easy. Amazing !!!!  My kids love salmon, but it can get boring.  This recipe is reminds me of why I love salmon so much.

I liked the flavor of the glaze however I had to take it frome the broiler and bake it.  The glaze started to burn on the pan before the salmon was done.  I think it would have been even better if I had let the glaze marinate for a while to give the Salmon more flavor.

Great.  I added a bit of honey.  I was worried because the glaze smelled like straight mustard,  but incredibly i couldn't taste teh mustard after it was cooked.  I used my george foreman grill and after they were cooked i drizzled the glaze that collected in the tray over the fish.  Will make again.  I'm interested to see how this glaze works with chicken..mmmmm

The glaze is so simple but don't let that detract you from trying it. I added rosemary and it was delicious. Because of the brown sugar, it may look like the glaze is burned after five or so minutes, but it tastes good nonetheless. I served with broccoli and brown rice and it was great. Nine minutes was enough in the broiler, so be sure to watch it.

I really enjoyed this because it was so simple. The dijon/brown sugar combo was great for salmon. I may try some of the other suggestions next time like marinating it, only because it was a tad on the dry side.

I loved this. I made it and it was so easy and good. I cooked it with asparagus and baked red potatoes. My husband really like it too. He only wished there was more. I gave him half of my salmon because he kept looking at it after he finished his.

Perfect for grilled salmon!  I used spicy brown mustard with the brn sugar. We usually use a sweet teriyaki for salmon, and my husband and I both thought this was a perfect combo of sweet and tangy, and that it complimented the flavor of the salmon very nicely. Easy, on-hand ingredients, inexpensive, and a new favorite!

This was very good.  Next time I'm going to put slits in the fish before adding the glaze.

We made this tonight for dinner. My wife and I both loved it. But I had a problem with broiling: it caught fire. Fortunately, I saw it before it got too bad. Ended up baking it instead.   Next time I will bake and then may try the broiler for the last minute or two to caramelize the glaze.

the first thing I noticed about this recipe, other than the simplicity of the ingredients, was that nobody changed the recipe!!! No reviews say it's good but change this and add that, basically changing the recipe entirely! This recipe is amazing... Easy, fast and everyone loved it! Definitely a keeper!

Hubby supposed to be eating more fish, but he doesn't like it, so I decided to try this and he LOVED it.  That's a huge statement for him.  Definitely a keeper.

Wasn't my favorite salmon glaze.  I wish it was thicker or gave the salmon a nice carmelized crust.  But is was tasty, I would just modify it next time.

My husband really liked this.  I have had an aversion to salmon the last two times I have made it, so I couldn't eat it after I made it.  It smelled great (not common for fish) when it was done cooking.  It was also really easy to make.

Hubby and I both really liked this one.  It was very easy and very good.  This is now tied for #1 for our favorite homemade salmon.  We'll definitely make this one again.  I broiled it for about 10 minutes- next time I'll probably go closer to 11-12 minutes.

Great recipe -- we loved it. The only thing I couldn't figure out was the glaze; "whisking together" the brown sugar and the Dijon really didn't seem to work...it was more like clay! But the flavor was perfect. We'll make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic!  I've tried many different marinades and glazes, but none came out this well with so little effort.  The only thing I did was add some cayanne pepper to the mustard/brown sugar for a little kick.  I do not like fish (husband loves it) and I'm constantly trying to find something that will help me work it into my diet and this one is a keeper.  I will definitely make it again.

Added white wine and lemon juice to brown sugar & mustard.. prob better to put over salmon and let sugar/mustard be a dry “sauce”.  
This is an easy and tasty way to bake salmon!

I love this recipe but when I made it, on the spur of the moment I didn’t have the Dijon mustard so I used yellow mustard and I added sweet basil and tarragon to it and it was delicious. So I imagine I will try it the original way one day but for now my substitutions worked well.

I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar, would have liked to have used tin foil so as not to clean pan but overall it had great flavour. Perfectly done at 10 min on low broil. Easy!!!!!!!

I loved this! It really only took 10 minutes under the broiler and was cooked to perfection. The glaze is delicious! My daughters did have some taste issue with it as they couldn't get over the idea of mustard on salmon.

I baked it at 400 for 18 minutes. It had just a bit of tan on the top.   My only concern is: boy does the sauce burn and the smoke and smell were really bad even with the stove fan on (broiling it would be worse). Second try same problem, I wouldn't broil it. I wouldn't be able to cook it for company because of the smoke smell.  Oh! I liked the addition of pecans!

I did have to cook it for somewhat longer before it was no longer dark pink, and I also had three fillets, so I had to reduce the brown sugar and the mustard by about a fourth.

Love it!  I made this super simple recipe, but I made a slight change to the cooking method.  I wrapped my broiler pan with tin foil, started the fish on the grill to give it a smokey flavor, then moved it inside to the broiler to finish it up.  (And keep an eye on it!)  The best part of the fish was the crispy thin super glaze.  I thought I had overcooked it, but it was excellent!  The thin part of the fish was sweeter, the thicker part of the fish was savory.   Served it on yellow rice and green beans.  I would DOUBLE the sauce for 4 fillets!

The glaze is very good and so easy.  Salmon is ready in a snap.  Great for a fast dinner. My family prefers a heavier glaze so I double the recipe.

This recipe is AMAZING! I mean even the kids can’t get enough of it. I have followed some of the changes in the comments to enhance the recipe though. I heat the oven to 375 and cook it for 30-40 mins. I also read the last time I made it to add small cuts in the salmon and make sure the brown sugar and mustard goes in there and it was one of the tastiest things I’ve eaten! I sometimes also add a little more brown sugar so it stays on the salmon when cooking.

OH MY!!  I made this recipe last night.  Unbelievably good. I will definitely make this recipe at least twice a month. Has plenty of possibilities by changing the dry spices.  And, since my husband and I like more savory than sweet dishes, I reduced the sugar to 1 Tbs. packed brown sugar and added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. onion powder, 1/2 tsp. black pepper and 1/4 tsp. sea salt to the mixture.  I then stirred everything  in a small bowl and basted the salmon steaks (two, each about 6 oz.) on all sides, placed on a rack inside a small baking dish and broiled for 15 minutes.  I did reserve about a tablespoon of the basting mixture for serving.  A definite keeper.  Thank you Tamara.

Very easy to make, only issue is when I put it 6 inches from the top of the broiler, it started to burn, so you have to be super careful about watching it. After some of the spill-off sauce started to burn, I put it lower down for 10 minutes, then back up top for the last few minutes, that worked well!

I also add panko bread  crumbs on top of the brown sugar/mustard glaze and.  It gives the salmon a nice crunch.

This was super easy but so sweet I couldn’t really taste the salmon. I will try some alternatives as others have suggested.

I’m not a fan of mustard so I wasn’t sure I’d like it but it was delicious and it definitely pleased the family. I plan on making this often.

My husband does most of the cooking at our house, but tonight was my turn.  I made this, and my 7 year-old daughters told me it's the best salmon they've ever had.  Better than Daddy's. (Then they told him!  LOL!)

Easy to make and VERY tasty.  Keep an eye on it in the oven. my oven is hot and needed a fraction of the time suggested. I turned off the broiler and let it bake while I finished the sides.

My husband always cooks our fish, and does it on the grill. I made this dish and he loved it; he keeps asking when I’ll make it again...
I used the broiler pan as directed and it made a mess. Next time I’ll try tin foil on the top rack also, cutting holes so the sauce can drain. I’ll also make extra sauce.

I love this very easy salmon recipe. I watch the video and by gosh I didn’t even know the pan that was in my broiler could be used to cook on, this video was life-changing. I cooked it for 10 minutes on low then five minutes on high, I wasn’t sure what the broiler should be on - it turned out fabulous.

I used honey instead of brown sugar and the glaze was just too runny so I don't know if using honey had anything to do with it. I also added a couple tablespoons of soy sauce as some people were commenting that it was too sweet. I didn't find it too sweet after adding the soy sauce but just runny. I also started to bake it but after seeing that the glaze was just pooling on the salmon, after about 5 min. I broiled for a few minutes hoping it would get a little "crusty" but it didn't. It still tasted good though so I will try again.

After reading reviews I was concerned about the sweetness of this recipe, after all, never heard of sugar and fish. This recipe is fantastic! It definitely has some sweetness that cuts the fishy taste of salmon but is hardly too sweet in my book. The fish broiled at 550 for about 10 mins and was cooked perfectly although my filet was only 2” thick. The only downside to this is the skin doesnt have a chance to crisp but the flesh comes clean of the skin with no effort so easy to eat around. Very surprised at the simplicity and that sugar and fish go together.

This recipe is everything I’d been searching for. It’s super easy and it’s delicious!!! My man absolutely loved this ;-). I didn’t change much,  I just added a little maple syrup & a little honey in the glaze because I like it real sweet. I also doubled the ingredients because I like it super saucy too. I’ll definitely be making this over and over for everyone I know!

I loved it! The only thing differently was that I did bake on 350 for about 25 mins or so instead of broil. Definitely use foil to make it easier to clean. I will be making again!

I like fish dinners and I'm always looking for different ways to cook fish. I was skeptical about this recipe, but I tried it and like it a lot. I'll make it again. I used spicy mustard in replace of diijon mustard.

It turned out really well. I followed the advise of doubling up on the glaze/sauce, substituting honey for brown sugar, and baking at 375 for 30 - 40 min. Sooo sooo good.

I don't normally like salmon but my husband does. So I figured I would give this recipe a try and it was the best salmon I have ever had and I wanted more. my husband loved it also. we had pan fried broccoli with garlic and butter as a side with it and paired really well.

YUM! This recipe was awesome and so easy to make! I looked at the reviews before I made it (something I always like to do to get a consensus about the recipe) and I did use some of the suggestions others had! I doubled the glaze recipe &  added 1 TBSP of honey and 1 TBSP soy sauce to my glaze. I also cut small holes into tops of salmon fillets before I salt & pepper, then coated mix on top and let marinate in fridge for about 1-2hours. I then put fillet on aluminum lined baking sheet then poured mix from container on top again. I baked them @ 350 degrees for 40 mind (check after 30 to make sure you don’t over cook!) The glaze did burn on the foil but the salmon was lovely; very moist & juicy without drying out and glaze was thick enough. They turned out DELICIOUS! We were all fighting over the last piece and this is one meal that I know we will eat the leftovers haha. Thanks to OP for this recipe & I will be keeping it in my book for next time :)

The only thing better than fresh caught salmon is using this recipe to cook it . I baked it rather than broil and doubled the sauce to use over the long grain wild rice I made with it. Much better than the salty soy sauce recipes.

I cooked it partly in a grill basket on the grill and then broiled it a little.  Served it with shaved brussel sprouts sauted with shallot, bacon, red pepper and small baked potatoes.  Easy and very good!

I used fresh salmon instead of frozen.  Also each salmon steak  was over  6oz. I used 1 cup packed light brown sugar and 8 Tbls.of dijon mustard.

This recipe is great, easy and quick.  This takes very little time but has a lot of flavor. No marinading for hours. I even used regular mustard and it's still delish. I also like to add chopped green onions on top for garnish and taste.

This salmon was amazing! I used Splenda brown sugar with the Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Hands down the best salmon I have ever tasted. I served it with crispy roasted Parmesan potatoes.

I had a piece of salmon that was about 10 ounces total.

I had about two extra tablespoons of bourbon left in the bottle, I also used a tablespoon of soy sauce and 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  Hubby loved it.  I thought the sauce was a little "runny" except for where the sugar got very gummy.  Since I changed the quantities, no question it changed the dynamics.  It was still very tasty.

Made this recipe as is, was very good. My salmon filets were very thin, and so I only broiled them about 5 minutes. Paired with steamed asparagus and jasmine rice.

So good and so easy!  I made more sauce than was asked for and put in a bit of soy sauce.  Next time I will make even more sauce and may let it marinate a bit.

I will definitely make this again! I made this for me and my mom ! She said I should be proud of myself ! Only thing I changed was I added two teaspoons of honey . Delicious. My fiancé is not a fan of fish but this he likes a lot . I got fresh veggies and steamed them. Boiled my potatoes and then cut them in halfs, heated a pan with olive oil, sea salt and chili powder and set them all facing down . It gave them nice taste and a little crunch. !!

Everyone liked it, from 7 years old to 67. What I liked best was the limited ingredients - many other recipes are complex and increase prep time. One caution - I never broiled salmon before and even though it was in for half the recipe time, it was overdone.

yummy and so simple.
we dont like the smell of fish in the house,  so we bake it on
an outdoor Weber grill in a cast iron pan, then 
brush the glaze on. Delicious

I would make again but bake instead of broil.  It had a good flavor but the top got a little burned after broiling for 9 minutes and the inside was still undercooked.

I chose to bake this for 15 minutes at 400. I liked how this was ready to go in the oven in literally 5 minutes. And it came out delicious. But the kids complained about the strong taste of Dijon mustard. They still ate their portion, but ask me to use less of the mustard next time. Maybe, it's the brand of Dijon I am using ?..

I love the recipes its simple and not to fatting it gives the salmon flavor hides the fishie smell lol I hope it works thanks for the idea

Would give 10 stars if I could. Did the foil package as someone suggested baked in oven 400 for 25 mins. Will make again often.

I absolutely love this recipe. It's really the only way I do salmon. I always have those individual frozen portions of salmon from Costco in my freezer  and it's a quick easy meal to do with rice and a green vegetable.

This was very good and so easy to make.  Next time I will make some cuts in the meat so sauce can get in.  Serve with Jasmine rice next time too.  Bake 375 for 30-40 min.

Don't think about it! Just do it! Simple, easy and wonderfully delicious! I added a teaspoon of soy sauce to mine and used organic light brown sugar and placedsalmon on aluminum foil before broiling on low for approx 15 - 18 minutes. I did put a few drops of water at the bottom and coconut oil just to make sure the moisture remained (you can spray the pan with cooking spray instead). The recipe is great just as is. You don't have to add anything to it. I served the salmon with brown rice and stir fry vegetables (carrots, peas, broccoli) and made some extra sauce to cover  lightly over the vegetables. You won't regret this. The kids are asking, is the food done already?!?!? The answer is...YES!

I don't like mustard but the combination with the brown sugar was tasty on the salmon.  I would recommend making more of the sauce so there is plenty.  Will make it again.

This was excellent!  First time making salmon.  Followed the instructions exactly. My broiler has Hi and Lo, so I broiled on Hi for 10 minutes and it turned out fantastic! Served it with brown rice and broccoli.  Will definitely be making this again!

This was the best Salmon I'ver ever cooked. I usually cook it for my husband. I opt out for steak but my Dr. gave me notice... so I tried this and it never tasted fishy. It was restaurant quality! I will make it again... many times!!

I loved this salmon,  it is so simple yet abosutely delicous sand elegant. Make sure you let it become a glaze under the broiler, it's not just a sauce but crystallizes.

Delicious, I cooked it for 10 minutes on high broil on tinfoil and it came out perfect. I recommend putting olive oil on both sides     before you salt and pepper it. The Dijon brown sugar glaze gave the fish a brown finish on top and it looked beautiful.

I've made this recipe more times than I can count and the only major change is a switch to truvia, for less calories with the same taste; sorry to sound like an advertisement yet the product is just fantastic with this yummy recipe for those of us attempting a healthier lifestyle. Thanks Ashley again for the original recipe.

Made this with my 8 year old. Placed the salmon over rice. All 4 kids and both adults (all picky eaters) cleared their plates without a word in between (couldn't get bites fast enough!) This was incredibly simple and absolutely wonderful!  My broil has high/low options, I did high and it was perfectly cooked in the middle rack.

This turned out great! Thank you Tamara!
It didnt say what temp to preheat the broiler but mine automatically went to 525° so I guess thats right. Only problem and why im not putting 5 stars is because the majority of the topping slid off and onto the pan and the slid off topping burned on the pan so I couldn't reuse it. The topping on the salmon did not burn. This was so much easier than doing it on the stove top and tasted really good :).

Very surprised this simple recipe was soooo delicious. I didn't use enough salt and pepper at first but just sprinkled some on at the end, and it was all good. I thought all of the brown sugar was going to make it super over-the-top sweet, but to my surprise it wasn't. I used honey mustard with the brown sugar and it tasted absolutely amazing. I broiled it on low for 20 mins... Which was five minutes too long, but it was still very moist. Next time I think I will broil on low for only 15 minutes and make MORE salmon. I had no leftovers! Ugh!!!! Love this easy recipe.

The reviews from mother and husband were good. Will do again. Next time I will let it marinate in the fridge a day before to really integrate the flavors. Simple and good.

My kids hated this dish (3, 5, & 7yrs), and I disliked it as well.  The dijon and brown sugar flavor combo was weird.

Followed the recipe of baking instead of broiling at 400 for 25 min. Substituted Agave Honey, dijon mustard, and bread crumbs on top. Delicious!!

This is a quick and easy dish to make if you are short on time and low on ingredients. The dish was flavorful, but may not be so enjoyable to guest who don't like their main entrée to be sweet.

I keep looking at other salmon recipes but I keep going back to this one. It is extremely simple to prepare and the flavor is outstanding. I bake it for 30-40 minutes at 350 instead of using the broiler. It's just easier.

Super!  Hubby said it was the best salmon he ever had.  Made according to recipe. I was worried about burnt glaze, so next time I may bake it for 10 minutes and then broil for 5.

I made it exactly, and it is amazing! One of the best salmon recipes. Baking it keeps it really moist, and the glaze is sweet without being too overpowering. Great served with white rice and a green veggie.

Hubby and I tried this with our salmon steaks and he loved it! Called me today and asked if I could put the trout (office peer gave him) in the same marinate. We were planning to grill but weather is yukky so we will cook in foil with the marinate. Didn't see why not so I will let you know how it comes out!

I don't usually put bad ratings on here, but mainly just want to remind myself not to make this again by mistake.  This salmon was wayy too sweet for my taste.

This was delicious!  My daughter devoured it, and she doesn't like mustard.  She could not taste it out right, just the right twang.  I used the foil on the baking pan to collect the sauce.

I liked it better with spicy brown mustard. I think the brand of Dijon I bought was horrible, so I used  what I had.

Couldn't stop tasting sauce before I put on the salmon.   So easy and few ingredients, I was a little skeptical,  but it was delicious.   I also added a little honey,  but not much.

This has become my go-to method of preparing salmon. I like that the recipe measurements were easy to divide for a single portion. Served with a side of broccoli, it's a quick and easy weeknight meal.

Loved it... I'm a big fan of the sweet salmon. Instead of broiling it I put it in the oven at 375 for about 40 mins and served it over rice :)

This truly was an outstanding, easy, quick main dish.  The broiler needs to be on high.  I do not have a broiler pan, so I used my cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil and a cooling rack placed on top.  The salmon then sits on the cooling rack and the drippings land on the aluminum foil and not the cookie sheet.....super easy clean up.  I did let the salmon marinade for a couple hours.  I also substituted soy sauce for the salt.  Excellent!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  However, I like it saucy, so I doubled the mustard/brown sugar glaze.  I had leftovers and ate it the next day on top of a salad.  It was just as good on the next day.  Highly recommend this recipe.

I just made this for dinner and it was so good! I can't wait to make it again. I baked the salmon in the oven on 375 degrees for about a half hour. It was moist and not overly seasoned; it was just right!

So easy and so good! I didn't think I had enough brown sugar so I added some Pick-a-pepper sauce to make it sweet and hot. My salmon was thin, but it only took 5 minutes under the broiler. Awesome!

simple, easy and delicious!  My husband, who is not a salmon fan, really liked it, and didn't ask for lemon or other sauce to hide the salmon flavor (which he usually does).  Even my super finicky daughter liked it!  This is definitely a keeper.
I used dark brown sugar and a mix of country dijon with whole mustard seeds and a dijon garlic aoli, as these were what I had on hand, and it came out terrific!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Great, easy recipe.  Nice that I already had the few items for marinate already in my pantry.  My boyfriend only asked that I use a little less brown sugar next time ... but he is sensitive to sweets, so that makes sense.

I thought this recipe was really blah. Not much flavor came through at all and I tried making it both as the recipe suggested, and also marinating the salmon with the sauce for 20 minutes first. It tasted fine both ways, but that was the salmon, not the sauce.

My family and I loved this recipe.  I don't usually broil so at first I was a little weary,but it was delicious and easy.  It reminded of the salmon in resturants.

Absolutely delectable!  Such a great glaze, and so fast and easy.  I used dark brown sugar - all I had, it was perfectly fine.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I thought it was an amazing recipe.  I added a pinch more brown sugar and it turned out perfect. :) I made it with green beans and rice pilaf.

Very good and simple. Turn up the broiler to high at the last minute to caramelize the sauce a bit more if you like.

This was surprisingly good. I have been looking for a recipe to make salmon suite my taste. It  has a sweet taste, but not to much. Takes out enough of the 'fishy' taste for me to tolerate and actually really like. Kids and husband loved it too!

Great recipe!  I added soy sauce and used cayenne pepper as well as paprika to season the fish.  I also added two tablespoons of honey.  It was spicy and sweet!  Yum.

I tried this recipe and absolutely loved it. The broiler on our oven is broken so I baked them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes as one of the other reviewers had suggested and the fish came out soft, moist and yummy!!! will definitely try this again.

My husband and I make a similar recipe with whole grain mustard and brown sugar.  We place a whole salmon filet on a wood plank and grill it - it's probably the best salmon I've ever had.  Even my picky brother said it was the best meal he had on his trip to the PacNW.  The mustard and brown sugar can't go wrong.

I made it exactly like the recipe, only I cooked it in my toaster oven at 400 degrees for 18 minutes. It was juicy and tender and the glaze was delicious, not overwhelming. I used Jack Daniels honey dijon mustard. Yum! Thanks for the quick, easy recipe.

I was pretty skeptical about making this - the idea of dijon mustard and brown sugar just didn't sound good and I hate honey mustard - but I was swayed by the great reviews.  Let me tell you, this was amazingly good - 5 stars and I don't do that for just every recipe.  I'm pretty critical.  I followed the recipe to the letter, served it with a regular, brown and wild rice pilaf and spinach saute'd with butter and garlic.  A fabulous and super easy dinner.  This one's a keeper - thanks Tamara, for posting this one!

Loved this recipe! I followed the recipe's exact instructions even with the 6 inches away from broiler fire instruction. My husband doesn't like sweet food but he did say it tasted like it came out of a restaurant. The only think I will add is that if you have a broiler like mine that only has a "Hi" and "Lo" setting, broil on "Hi" for 5 mins and "lo" for the next five. You get that golden brown look but not burnt taste.

So flipping good! I added a drop or two of soy sauce on top of my salmon just before placing it in the oven. Came out super moist!! Went great with some fresh green beans and my homemade mashed potatoes with chive & sour cream. I would have posted a picture, but it didn't last long on our plates. I also love how easy it is! Worth trying for sure!

Excellent simple recipe. I added soy sauce to make it into more of a paste (as much without making it watery). I also added a tea spoon of fresh minced garlic. I allowed it to marinate for a couple hours in the fridge. Cooked a full 15 min. Will definitely make this recipe again.

OMG. So quick and good.  I served mine on a bed of hot slaw. Heat a skillet and throw in some broccoli slaw, Sprinkled with brown sugar, teaspoon of the mustard, sprinkler with garlic powder.  Heat though, then add a splash of rice vinegar.  Sprinkle sesame seeds on top of everything.

My wife would eat salmon every day of the week if the rest of us would let her.  But, we ALL agree that this was the best salmon I've ever fixed.

This was very good. I roasted mine at 400 degrees for about 13 minutes and it was perfectly cooked and flavorful. It is a nice change and quick to prepare!

Delicious!  I took the advice of a couple reviewers and added a little bit of sweet hot mustard and a splash of soy sauce, and my fiance raved about it.  I also baked it at 400 for 18 minutes, but I'm sure it would be delicious broiled as well.  Thank you Tamara!

I didn't like the flavor combination with the salmon, however, we are going to use this with chicken and pork chops because it will be absolutely awesome.

I made this with 2 (3 lb) salmon fillets, doubled the recipe, and scored the fish into serving-sized portions before adding the glaze.  It was delicious!

This was okay.  Prepared according to the directions except I grilled it.  Too sweet.  There are much better ways to prepare salmon.

Sensational! This was so easy to prepare and tasted superb. I didn't alter the recipe in any way and thought it fantastic. This recipe is a keeper due to the great taste and the effortless preparation as well as the fact the minimal ingredients are often on hand.

This was a success.  My husband thought it was restaurant quality and my son who is not a fish lover enjoyed it as well.  I was happy it was so easy to prepare.  Will fix again; this one is a keeper.

Not a fan!  I followed the directions exactly and it was nearly inedible for me.  My husband liked it ok but I had to wipe my salmon off and put some salt and pepper back on to be able to finish.  The combo of the dijon and sugar on salmon just didn't work for me...I think maybe on chicken instead? I would also use less mustard. It overpowered the salmon rather than highlighting it.  Sorry for the bad review, just didn't work for me.  I did enjoy it being broiled though, I will use that cooking method again for my salmon.

Quick, simple, and great!  No adjustments made.  Even those who don't (or didn't) like salmon went back for seconds.  Will definitely use again!

This is the way I will cook salmon from now on. I only had plain mustard, but it still turned out great. Even my picky daughter ate all her salmon. Thanks!

I used steelhead trout for the fish and spicy dijon for the mustard.  We really loved it.  I think you could get away with a little less sugar for those that are health consciences.  We will definitely make it again.

I'm not sure why I didn't experience the 'greatness' of this recipe. It was waaaay too sweet for my taste, and I definitely have a sweet tooth. The mustard and the brown sugar just didn't work. :-(

This recipe was just so so for us...I love Salmon and am always looking for new ways to prepare it...my hubby likes it with a touch of sweetness - so thought this wld b perfect.  It was good, but much of the taste was lost on the thicker parts.  I used a cut filet - not steaks and prepared it on the grill...maybe the oven baking would make a difference! Will experiment and try again. Thanks!

I haven't tried to cook salmon before because actually I'd nevered ordered it in a restaurant before but I wanted to give it a try. It was O.K., however, don't think I will fix it again. Want to try blackened salmon next time.
