These were quite tasty! The only change I made was adding a bit of garlic powder and oregano. I will definitely be making these again. They were perfectly chewy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. 
Next time I will likely brush with butter instead of egg, just so they're a bit buttery/salty on the outside.

These turned out great! I made mine 6in long but I think I would make them a 7 or 8in next time.  They Remind me of  a soft pretzel or Olive Garden bread sticks.
