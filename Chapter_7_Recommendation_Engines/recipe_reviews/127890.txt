I am a former Starbucks Manager. Pumpkin spice was my favorite (and cinnamon dolce).I followed the recipe to the letter but use 2% milk. I thought this was a good recipe without using a milk steamer. Steaming the milk is what makes it sweet. I am not sure if any of you are aware (many of our customers werent) that you can buy any of the favor syrups from Starbucks. I bet using there favoring and this way would taste pretty close.

I don't rate many recipes, but had to rate this one!  A++++, 5 stars, best ever!    For those complaining it's not sweet enough or not enough coffee, add more coffee, add more sugar.  It's simple.  The allrecipes.com police aren't coming to get you if you change it to your liking!!    I have been trying latte recipes all week and this one is my FAVOURITE!  And my Hubby's top 2 (he can't decide!)  Don't skimp on the whipped cream either!  I swear, I could sell these out of my home and run the local 'gourmet' coffee place into the ground!    Thanks for the recipe!  Fantastic!

I just took the easy, cheater way out and put together in makeshift form:  My typical 12 oz traveller cup, tossed in some 1% milk, a splash of vanilla, tsp sugar, and a few shakes of Pumpkin Pie Spice.  Didn't froth it up or anything.  Turned out really well - very nice change.

I filled my drinking glass 2/3 full of cold milk, then placed it in the microwave for about 2 minutes untill it started to froth and bubble. I stirred in the amount of sugar, vannila extract, and spice. Then I filled the glass up the rest of the way with coffee. My coffee machine doesnt have a "strong brew" button like I've seen on other coffee machines so I just doubled the amount of coffee I put in it. For 4 cups I added two scoops (a little more than 2 tablespoons). The spice does not dissolve fully and likes to settle to the bottom, I just keep a spoon in my cup to stir it back up every once in a while. I also doubled the spice because my glass holds a little more than typical coffee mugs and I just really like pumpkin flavor. This was a wonderful recipe and I will defidently be making it over and over again!

Quite fabulous! My four-year-old daughter and I wanted a coffee drink, and I thought this might be nice. We used 1½ cups of 2% milk, a tablespoon of sugar, around ½ tsp vanilla, a couple shakes of cinnamon, and a shake each of nutmeg, cloves, and ginger (most pumpkin pie spices are a mixture of these four spices). We used about half of the milk mixture and half of a strong Christmas-y coffee and we stirred in a couple tablespoons of whipped topping. Really good! Oh, and I didn't use a blender, but I whisked the hot milk mixture until it was frothy (took a minute or two). Awesome, although some spices settled to the bottom. Oh, well. :) Thanks for sharing, Zippy!

I made this like I was making cappuccino. I recommend using vanilla syrup instead of extract because the extract left it feeling like it was missing something; also double the pumpkin pie spice if you like a lot of flavor.   It ended up like this: For each individual cup mix 1 cup milk, 2 splenda (what I always use) or sweetener of choice, 1/4 tspn pumpkin spice, 1 Tbsp Vanilla syrup. Froth in cup using steamer. Then add your shot of expresso. Tastes great!!

This is a good alternative to any coffee shop's pumpkin spiced latte and the instant mixes - quick to make and very yummy.  I reduced the amount of milk and instead of using hot milk and then whipped cream, I added warm milk I had preparred in my milk frother, which turned out very well. I will definetly make it again and will stop buying the instant mixes you get at the stores.  After using less milk, this is a keeper.

Enjoyed this drink, however I would add a bit more coffee next time.  I too added more sugar than the recipe suggested and used 2% milk instead of whole.  Will definitely make again!

This was very good but it tasted more like flavored hot milk instead of a latte.  If you could add more of a concentrated coffee flavor It would be better.  I will be making this again but just as flavored milk.  Might be something the kids could have to make them feel special.

not bad at all.  I would defiantly make this again, and skip the fancy coffee place on the way to work.  However, I added more spice, and it was more to my liking.

The first time I made this I liked it, but the spices didn't dissolve.  The next time I made this I doubled the spices and added it to the beans in the grinder portion of my coffee maker.  If you don't have a grinder, you could add the spices to the grounds when brewing the coffee.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.  Great recipe!

I really love this recipe!  I use demerara sugar in place of white and I add a bit more coffee, not much just a bit to suit my taste.  I found this to really take my craving for Starbuck's away.  I have purchased their syrups to "copy" their drinks, but that does add quite a bit more sugar and therefore, calories.  This recipe is a winner!  The best of both worlds.  Thank you!

I love this recipe.  It's just enough sweet and it is sooo foamy and delicious.  I make it for the whole family, although I delete the coffee for the kids and instead, add a tablespoon of bittersweet chocolate chips to the hot milk in the blender for a rich flavor just for them.  God Bless!

This turned out good. I scaled it down to one serving and it was perfect. I feel like it needs a little something tough.

Wonderful, delicious holiday recipe!  I added about a cup of pumpkin pie filling and whisked it into the milk, and didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so used ground nutmeg, ground cloves, cinnamon and ground ginger.  Oh my...  Just made my third batch.  My husband is enjoying his with coffee, but I am a tea drinker.  The flavor is even better with tea!~

This is near exactly how I make my pumpkin spiced latte. I use an Aerolatte whisk though, so much "easier" than a blender. I usually use vanilla coffee beans so I leave out the vanilla and just add the pumpkin spice to the whipped cream. I also don't add sugar, but that is personal preference. I made for someone else and they wanted the added extra sugar. It is so simple and delicious and there is no need for the heavy flavored syrups they use at the coffee shops. I love to make this every fall!

Cozy and delicious! I like that it's spicy but not quite as sweet as Starbucks version. I'm sure it's even better with whole milk, but I used skim and it's still wonderful. I did not find it to be gritty at all. Very good recipe, thank you!

As good as Starbucks only cheaper.  Recipe was just as good with skim milk, no whipped cream and weaker strength coffee.  Lots of room to play around with this recipe.

I used to work at Starbucks, and in response to the comment below, you CANNOT buy the Pumpkin Spice Syrup that I know of. You can buy others (Vanilla, etc). This is a very close substitute, though. I do like my drinks a little sweeter and love the foam so I use my steamer, but the sugar and pumpkin spice is awesome. Well done on this.

This was a decent copy of a Starbucks pumpkin spice latte (and so much cheaper, too!). I didn't think the flavor was quite strong enough. If you really want to taste the coffee AND the spices, I'd recommend adding more or cutting back on the milk just a little. It was an easy recipe I would definitely make again. I used a pumpkin pie spice recipe from this site to mix the spices myself, making the whole thing really economical.

Wonderful recipe. I worked at Starbucks for a little while in Europe and we did not serve the pumpkin spice Latte so it was nice to make one myself. I made the pumpkin Spice myself since I can't buy it here. Mix 1/4 cup cinnamon with 1 Tbsp each of ground ginger, nutmeg, and ground cloves. Thank you very much

CAUTION:  I burned my arms making this recipe.  Hot liquids in a blender can make the lid come up and allow the hot milk to explode out.  This recipe was really good, just use caution!

My husband and I really liked this!  It's a great fall-worthy latte that is cheaper and lower in calories than Starbuck's version.

This is the first time I've written a negative review. The concept is good, so I'll probably try tweaking the recipe, but my husband & I agreed that it tasted like warm milk with spices. I couldn't taste the coffee at all! If I try this again, I'll definitely use more coffee and less milk. I do like the idea of being able to make pumpkin spice lattes at home but my attempt today tasted NOTHING like Starbucks.

This was ok.  Not nearly as good as Starbucks/Caribou or places like that but it was ok.  I followed the directions exactly.

I used espresso because I had some. This was real good. I made just one serving for myself last night as a treat as I was home alone and really enjoyed it! Tasted like the coffee house one I tried a few years ago!

I followed the directions except just made it for one cup full. It was EXCELLENT, and while not exactly the same as a Starbucks, it will certainly help my wallet!

I added more sugar and milk so it would fit in my mug.  definitely make sure your coffee is strong otherwise the result may be a bit weak.  other than that...this is GREAT!  Say goodbye to spending big bucks at Starbucks, hello frugal yumminess!

:(      I am SOOOO sad that this did not work out. My husband and I are both obsessed with the Starbucks pumpkin spice latte so I was thrilled to see this recipe and have been talking about making it for 2 days now...and it just does not taste good (to us anyway).  It is in fact very gritty (ick!!) and not near as flavorfull or strong as Starbucks.

This is a great , lo cal treat if you make it with sugar substitute. I used a bit more pumpkin spice and vanilla, and light cream mixed with 1% milk (all  had in the house.) My 13 yr old Starbucks fan couldn't tell the difference, and it saved over $3!

Wow.  I'm so happy I found this. It was so good I  made it 2 days in a row. I don't drink whole milk so I used 1.5 cups of 1% and 1.5 cups of half and half.  I also followed the other reviewers and used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I only have flavored coffee in the house so I used apple pie coffee and made my usual amount for hubby and myself. The wand hand mixer worked well and saves cleaning the blender.  Thanks for posting!

I had high hopes for this recipe but was disappionted. It came out really milky and not very spicey. I ended up having about 2 cups of the milk mixture left over and I had to add about 2 extra teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. people said thay like it but no one wanted another cup.

This was pretty good. It was a little bland, next time I will try adding some real pumpkin. I used light soy milk, Splenda, and left off the whipped cream to make it healthier.

This did not disappoint! Made it with 2 cups of milk(actually used vanilla almond milk) and warmed the blended milk mixture up in microwave for 2 minutes because I like my lattes hot. Also added a few dashes of french vanilla powder creamer for extra flavor. Can't wait to have another and for so much less than at Starbucks. Though I did brew Starbucks coffee :)

this is pretty dang good! I forgot to thaw my whip cream in time (bummer!) and i did use a blender to thoroughly mix the ingredients and to foam it up a bit. I also used 1% milk (all I had) and did not use exact ingredients... i just kind of put in what looked good. It is quite delicious even without the whip... but I am looking forward to this weekend when my whipped cream will be ready!

Tried it again this time with the whipped cream! it was awesome!

I actually followed the recipe to the letter on this one, and it was just OK. It did not inspire me to want to make this over and over again. I really like Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Lattes, and this just didn't make par for me.

I used some strong coffee, 1/2 & 1/2, forgot the vanilla, added 2 tsp. sugar, a couple dashes of pumpkin pie spice and topped it off with whipped cream and another dash of PP spice. My sister-in-law was here and I made it for her for brunch, she loved it!

I used fat free milk and put about 2 cups in a glass jar with a lid, to that I added vanilla, sugar and pumpkin pie spice.  I shook the jar for a minute to combine, and get frothy, then I put it into the microwave to get  hot.  I don't have an espresso machine...wish I did though! And my blender is on the fritz....so as we speak coffee is brewing on the strong setting and I added a little extra grounds to it.  The milk mixture smells great....THIS WAY TASTES ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE STARBUCKS!! I'm thrilled...this will save me $$$!!

Absolutely delicious and my new addiction!  I really enjoyed this latte, especially being so fast and easy with minimal ingredients.   I like that it doesn't include pumpkin puree, so I don't have to open a can and freeze the rest.  I even used 2% milk and it was still creamy and tasted like the real thing.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I am in love! I usually order this with "1/2 the pumps" because it is too sweet. This is juust right. You can adjust the sweetness to your taste!

I hate to give someone else's recipe a low grade, but although this was easy, I wasn't impressed.  Maybe it was the brand of spice I used (freshly bought, McCormick), but I found the taste underwhelming.  Mostly was vanilla and coffee flavor with some grittiness from the spices.  Tried adding extra cinnamon and nutmeg (a favorite of mine), but not much improvement.  Wondering if it would prevent grittness and improve flavor by putting spices in with the ground coffee before brewing?  Sorry, but mostly was a grade C- vanilla latte, to me so I won't make it again.

It's really good, but it doesn't have any pumpkin in it. It's just like a spiced latte- A very good latte. I think next time I'll add a little bit of canned pumpkin or some pumpkin flavored Torrani instead of the vanilla.

Yummy! I made this to have before school and shared it with my younger brother and sister (10 and 11) and we all loved it! Really quick and really easy. The only thing I did different was to add a couple of spoonfulls of pumpkin puree to the milk mix. Oh, and a little extra sugar because of my sister. Thanks for the great recipe!

Instead of a blender this is what I did.  Put the milk, sugar, and pumpkin pie spice into a saucepan over medium heat stirring constantly and being careful not to scorch the milk.  When it is good and hot, combine it with the coffee and vanilla.  Then you can top it with the whipped cream and spice if you like.  You will get that great frothiness of a real coffeehouse drink.    Starbucks is still the best, but this is pretty good.

Very good, but too sweet for my liking.  The second time I made it, I cut the sugar back by 1/2 and upped the vanilla 1/8 more and perfection!  Thanks for a yummy recipe idea!!

This is pretty darn tasty indeed!  I always keep KLIM powdered whole milk around, which gives coffee drinks a really rich flavor.  I scaled the recipe to one serving by mixing several tablespoons of powdered milk with 1 cup of hot water, a few teaspoons of sugar, a splash of vanilla, and a couple dashes of pumpkin pie spice.  I also added a dash of cloves, but will leave that out next time since it overpowered the other spices.  To get a nice, frothy consistency, I used a hand blender to mix the milk and spices and then added strong coffee to taste.  I typically don't add whipped cream (since it's unnecessary calories and fat), but I may try making this again with evaporated milk for even more richness.  Maybe even a spoonful of canned pumpkin?  :)  Will definitely be making this again!

Pretty darn good, but I took out the coffee (I know it's SUPPOSED to be a latte but...)  I heat 2% milk add 1/2 tsp sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.   A nice, easy morning treat in the winter.

Tasty!  I don't usually a blender to make this; instead I just combine the ingredients together before dividing into mugs.  (I use a blender sometimes and prefer it that way, but tend to skip this step because it's simpler).  I often substitute honey for the sugar and prefer to double the coffee.

This was very delicious.  I didn't have whole milk but I did have half and half and skim milk.  I used half of each.  I also didn't use the blender.  I just frothed it up by hand.  My dad had a cup with me and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will make this again for sure.

Very very good!  I had some extra whole milk to use up and this hit the spot on this nice, fall day!!  I have a sweet tooth though and put in a couple extra teaspoons of sugar.

This drink is delicious!  If you're making only a single cup like I did, use a scant 1/4 teaspoon when substituting the 1/2 and a pinch of pumpkin pie spice.  I also used the milk frother of my cappuccino maker to quickly heat up the ingredients.  Homemade pumpkin pie spice was fun to make in advance, too!

This is a very comforting latte for a cold fall or winter night or anytime! I used regular coffee since I already had some brewed and it still was very good especially if you prefer only a light coffee flavor. I followed the recipe exactly except I blended the milk with a frothing will instead of the blender and that gave just as good a result.  Overall, one of my new favorite home made lattes!

Instead of whipping cream, though I frothed milk and sprinkled some brown sugar on top :) Better than starbucks, hands down!

Yum! I used all of the ingredients as stated but did not use a blender. After I poured the hot milk mixture into each coupon I used my AeroLatte to get it to foam up and then slowly poured in the hot coffee. My family really enjoyed this treat and look forward to having it again. Thanks!

Yay!  Zippy I love you for putting up this recipe!   Starbucks doesn't have Pumpkin Spice Latte in Japan...I (and I think many, many of the foreign people here!) have been really, really wanting one with the weather getting cooler.  This recipe isn't exactly like the Starbucks one, but truth be told, I like it better.  I used a kilimanjaro coffee and skipped the whipped topping...the milk was frothy enough that it wasn't necessary.  Sprinkled some extra sugar on top with the pumpkin pie spice and it was perfect.

I made this just now, because I didn't have any canned pumpkin. I do like it, but it is missing something, not sure what it is. I make mine in my Frap Maker, which makes foam like nothin gelse, and it's wonderful... I think I'll keep trying some things and see if I can't get it to my liking just a bit better... Overall yummy!!!

I had trouble with the flavor of this drink. It was amazingly smooth, but a little off. I am going to try it again this time with more coffee and less milk. We'll see how that goes!

It was pretty good, but a lot of work.  Not sure I'll go to the trouble again when I can just use the Pumpkin Spice Latte creamer and get a close taste.

I made this with 1% milk and followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any whipped cream.  This was so yummy and even my skeptical boyfriend was impressed!  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  Just what I needed on a cold day.

Very strong instant coffee finely gave this a good coffee taste, I doubled the spice and it still didn't have much flavor. However, blending the milk makes an excellent foam. We have been using this recipe for the past month and substituting the pumpkin spice for 2 tbls.(per cup) homemade cinnamon syrup or gingerbread syrup.

I really enjoyed this but next time would use more coffee and spice. I like this recipe because it uses extract and spice rather than syrup. That way I can have stevia in it instead of sugar to sweeten.

I made this for my boyfriend and he said it deserved 5 stars for a homemade version without having an espresso machine.  I tried it and thought it was good, but not over-the-top outstanding.

This drink is so good!  It's warm and cozy and just the right amount of sweetness.  I used almond milk because that was all I had on hand, but it tasted great.  If you heat the milk in the microwave for 3-4 minutes it will get it as hot as the milk at Starbucks.  I will definitely make this again!

Made this for my husband who absolutely LOVES Starbuck's pumpkin spiced latte. He was very impressed and so was I. No need to spend $5 at Starbuck's... make your own.

I always have the problem of the spices just separating from the drink and I hate the texture of the separated spices. I do not think this is comparable to starbucks at all. Perhaps it is something I am doing but I've tried mixing it in at different times, blending it together, and more but they still just seem to separate.

This is sooo good.  Starbucks cannot compare.  I've blended and heated this in my Vitamix, had it cold and microwaved the milk with the sugar and spices until it frothed.  I've also tried different "milks": skim, evaporated skim, and half and half and various combinations as well...they are all great, but my favorite is mostly skim w/a bit of half and half.  Excellent recipe for us pumpkin latte lovers.  Thanks for sharing.

When I first made this we had to use apple pie spice instead, and we added some cinnamon. It was amazing. When I replenished my pumpkin pie spice, it was even better. We would only made a cup at a time and now I don't even use the blender. Just heat the milk in a coffee mug and add the rest.

Great idea, but after making this several times I recommend using more coffee.  Equal parts strong coffee and milk work well.  Blending this works OK, but you can get a really cheap battery powered frother that will really whip up that milk for a nice "professional" froth.

Found it to be a little too much milk - not enough coffee. I would drop it to 3 cups of milk and increase the coffee.

Loved it!  The only thing I did different was added  2 tsp. smuckers pumpkin spice ice cream topping to the milk mixture just to trump up the pumpkin flavor a little more.  This is an excellent recipe!

Yum! I have a Nespresso machine, so I used 3 2-oz shots of espresso. Actually, now that I'm writing this, I realized I got proportions all off btw milk & coffee, but that's okay, there's lots of wiggle room. I had no whole milk, so I used part 2% and part half & half. So good!

I have a Cappachino/Espresso Machine which I haven't used in about 4 yrs, but I think I'll try using it for this recipe. I could make the coffee adding the vanilla and pumpkin spice. Then making the froth I would just use the milk and sugar. Then just adding the spice on top of the froth. Will have to play with this over the weekend and I'll give you an update. Sounds delish - can't wait!

This recipe is great! I used a little less sugar than what is called for. I like this version a lot more than Starbucks', which is too sweet for me and a bit artificial tasting. This version was perfect and very easy to make.

Overall it was excellent. I DID use more coffee however. I used 8 oz coffee in 1/2 a batch for "just me" which would make it 16 oz for the whole recipe. I gave it a star less since I did change the taste a lot by using nearly3x more coffee to milk.

I found the flavor to be delightful and loved that I could use my regular coffee and did not have to buy expresso beans!  Do make sure that you brew your coffee double-strength, however.  Delicious!

Yummy, I used a sprinkle of ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg as the pumpkin pie spice-couldn't find it in the store?

I scaled down the recipe to only one serving.  When made as directed, I actually thought it was pretty bland and needed to add quite a bit more sugar to get the taste that I wanted.  Kind of disappointed, but is a good base for some tweaking.

Maybe a touch too sweet but overall nice flavor. Will the pumpkin pie spice ever dissolve? If it's in boiling hot coffee maybe?

Definitely need to blender to whip it up, otherwise it's a thin drink. I made it the first time as the receipt stated, second time I doubled the sugar, but I guess that's up to taste. 

I enjoyed it :)

This recipe is amazing! For one or two servings I do 1 and 1/2 of a cup of milk. Instead of a blender I used a whisk and a large bowl. But any way you make it, I'm sure you will love it!

The recipe as written is okay. I had to add more coffee and more spices to flavour as I wanted it though. I don't have a blender but I have a french press which I used to mix the milk mixture and froth it. Looked pretty, just needed adjusting for better flavour.

This is it!  Best alternative I've found to spending $4.50 on a PSL. I used regular coffee with hot half and half but otherwise the same ratios. The vanilla is what made it for me.

I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I totally diy'ed this! I took some butternut squash and mashed it up and added cinnamon and ginger (didn't have nutmeg or cloves either!) I put it in with the coffee and then strained the whole thing. Since I'm lactose intolerant, I added some almond milk and agave syrup. It was awesome!!!

I've made several different pumpkin spice coffees lately, and I didn't care for this one. It has too much milk, not enough sugar and not enough pumpkin pie spice. (For 1 serving, I like the ratio of 1/2 c milk to 1/2 c coffee.  Add sugar until it's sweet enough. And use 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice per serving.) I liked putting it in the blender--I have a single serve Ninja. It was nice and frothy and didn't take as long as whisking it on the stovetop. I would give this only 2 stars, but for the blender idea, I've upped it to 3 stars.

I didn't use the blender, just added ingredients to milk, microwaved til hot, and stirred well into hot coffee. 
It's delicious and easy and I will definitely make again (I live 2 hours away from the nearest Starbucks, so this really hits the spot! Thank you!)

I liked the way it smelled but the fact is it didn't have any pumpkin flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and even increased the pumpkin pie spice and it didn't help.  I probably will not make this again.

Where to start ?... 
I have had an all recipes account for years, this is my goto site for new recipes and I have yet to find a recipe I didn't like!
Now... I have been seriously been thinking of getting an expresso machine for the last year, and until today I didn't even think it possible to make lattes without a machine - I was in my grocery store and looking for something new and yummy in the coffee isle - and when I saw expresso I thought hmmm how it would be nice to make some type of coffee house drink with it - so I searched how to make a latte and this was the first link on the page. I finished my shopping grabbed the things needed and went home to play! I didn't have a blender so I was a little discouraged - but thought hey I bought everything - there has to be a way to make it work - a FOOD PROCCeSOR ! I broke the recipie in have just to see if it would work- I used my Keurig and brewed a cup of expresso (came out perfect) and put the other ingredients in the food proc. and was amazed when it turned nice and frothy, I let it stay in there for a min or two then put the mix and expresso together - added a bit of extra sugar (I prefer very sweet coffee) and tasted - love it so much! 
I think I will try a few different variations such as using heavy cream in place of some or all of the milk, trying agave to sweeten, and mess with the coffee to milk ratio just to see what tastes best but I will certainly not waste my money on an expresso machine nor will I blow money in a

I made this using my Nespresso machine. I combined the milk, sugar, spices and vanilla extract in the aerocinno. Poured the heated mixture in a mug and used a Lungo pod and poured that on top of the milk mixture. It was better than the Starbucks pumpkin spice latte in my opinion because I find theirs too sweet. This was bliss. Thanks for sharing.

This was okay. I didn't feel like the flavour was strong enough.

I enjoyed this. Added a little extra pumpkin pie spice and sugar as it didn't have quite enough flavor for me. Like everyone else, I enjoyed everything but the little bit of spice you find in the bottom. Not identical to Starbucks but worked for me! It saves me an hour trip to the nearest SB and the months' long wait for one!

It's good for a warm cup of milk before bed. Very mild and soothing.

This is yummy. I'm a pumpkin flavor fanatic this time of year! This was a very good substitute for the pricey ones I usually buy. Only thing is, the pumpkin pie spice falls to the bottom of the cup :( Other than that, it's easy and delish. Thanks for the recipe!

To much work for something that I didn't care for. Very disappointed as we make lattes daily & thought this would be nice for the fall season.

Regarding frothing the milk: I just did it myself, in my coffee cup, in about 10 seconds using a small whisk and rolling it back and forth between my palms.  I can't believe it was so easy!  I used 1% milk.  I'll be working on the balance of coffee and sweetness, but just wanted to comment on the frothing.

Great Recipe! I added a bit more white sugar and pumpkin spice to it, and also added a pinch of allspice too it. I couldn't believe how much it tasted like an actual Pumpkin Spice Latte from Starbucks! I will definitely be making this again!

This was very good!  I used fat free milk and heated it in the microwave till hot, and cut it down to make one serving.  I think next time i will use more pumpkin pie spice, i could taste it but i wanted more! Thanks for a great recipe for Thanksgiving morning guests!

I thought this was great!  I made a low-fat version of it, mixing 2 cups 1% milk and 1 cup fat free half & half.  I also passed on the whipped topping.  The coffee I used was Green Mountain Coffee's Dark Magic Espresso Blend.  Yummy!  Great alternative to Starbucks!

Definitely don't skip the blender and don't use skim milk. I tried both, but it was so much better (and frothier) as the recipe is written. Plan to use this all fall! Thanks!

I've never had one of these from a coffee shop, but this is really really yummy, and much much cheaper.  I used 1% milk and made my own pumpkin pie spice with cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  I didn't have any whipped cream, but it was fine without it.  I will definitely make this again.  It's so perfect for this time of year when I am craving everything pumpkin.

Make 3 easy changes to make this a 5 star recipe.  This is supposed to be a pumpkin spiced latte but where's the pumpkin? To get that pumpkin flavor I added 2 tblspns pumpkin puree to the milk before I heated it.  Also, this recipe needs a bit more sugar & quite a bit more pumpkin pie spice. Delicious!

It is very good. It is not the same as Starbucks. Expect something differant and delicious.  I liked that there was real pumpkin not some fattening syrup. I made mine with soymilk. I liked it but would not compare it to a coffee shops coffee. Just a good old down home winter drink.

This was good, but I think it could definitely be better.  I scaled it to one since I was just making it for myself.  I thought it needed more pumpkin flavor, so I would add more pumpkin pie spice or if I already have a can of pumpkin open I would for sure add some of that, and I would probably add a bit more vanilla.  I did omit the whipped topping since I didn't have or need any.  EDIT:  I doubled the pumpkin pie spice and vanilla, but it still really needs more pumpkin flavor.  I think some canned pumpkin would be perfect!

This was really good! Since my local Starbucks is about an eighty minute walk round trip, I decided to make my own. Although the whole milk would make it more decadent I was going for I'm not  going kill my good streak for the day drinks so i used skim. I heated everything except the coffee and whipped cream together in a pot on the stove, and while that was heating i made double brewed coffee. Then i mixed it all up together in my blender. I didnt even have to use whip cream, it foamed up so much it formed its own. Best homeade latte I've made yet.

Very disappointing after going through all the work.  I even added 2 T. of pumpkin, but that did not help to make it great.  I would not try this again.  Can't really say what I would do differently to make it better.

I've heard so much about starbuck's pumpkin spice latte, that when I seen this recipe, I had to try it. It was ok, but didn't have much coffee or pumpkin flavor. I upped the coffee, lowered the milk, added pumpkin puree and more pure vanilla. These changes made all the difference. I replaced the sugar with stevia. This drink was a good end to a very good day:)

Very good on these cold wet fall days! I only put in 3 Tbsp sugar (I think Starbucks is too sweet). Thanks for the delicious drink!

This is great!! I make mine with 1% milk and splenda instead of sugar. That way it is a sugar free, low fat latte. Starbucks doesn't have the sugar free pumpkin spice latte, so I usualy miss out every year. I make these every morning. My husband likes his with whole milk so it is creamier. Thanks for the recipe!!

Found this recipe on here last night, and made it for my boyfriend and sons.  Although the hot liquid in the blender did not go so well, and I had  no whipped topping, it was still a big hit.  Now I've been asked to make this every morning from now on.

i used  two shots of espresso in each serving and i steamed my milk with the sugar, vanilla and pumpkin pie spice (so it wasn't grainy) me and my husband really enjoyed it and next time i may add a touch of half and half and a little more sugar and spice. frothing it with a steamer is better then using a blender if you have one. i left out the whip too.. and just sprinkledthe spice on the foam.

This will be a new fall ritual at our house.  My kids love it, too.  We turned the AC down and sipped these last night.  It may be 85 degrees outside here in Tampa but we felt like autumn had arrived.  I used decaffeinated espresso - double strength.

Great on its own as is and easy to customize, like I did (and I'm no barista!).  I stuck my version in the customized tab.  Love that you don't need fancy gadgets!

What a delicious treat!  Instead of using whipped cream, I used the frothy part of the cream to top it off. Just pour the coffee in first.  As you pour the milk out of your blender, hold a spoon over the spout to keep the froth from pouring out.  Then scoop the froth into the cup after pouring the cream.

This was a good start at a recipe.  It needed lots of help....like pumpkin for starters.  I added (canned) pumpkin, used brown sugar and used my own blend of cinnamon, fresh ground nutmeg and ground cloves.  There was absolutely no need for a blender, as I added the freshly brewed coffee to the saucepan with the simmering milk (that had the pumpkin and spices whisked in).  Vanilla syrup would be nice for those who like it sweeter. Like I said, this was a nice "idea" recipe.

I would not stop going to Dunkin for this. It lacked flavor and was not good. Sorry I went out and spent almost $6.00 on pumpkin spice. The coffeemate pumpkin creamers are even better than this.

I made the recipe bigger for my family and had to add more sugar and cinnamon to make it the way we like it.  Overall, a good recipe, just a few tweeks to make it perfect.

Wow, this is fabulous! After reading a few other reviews, I made the following revisions- made 8 oz. espresso (needed more to balance out quantity of milk), used 2% instead of whole milk, used 4 Splenda (equivalent to 8 tsp. sugar), a tsp. vanilla, and a tsp. pumpkin spice. Without these changes, I feel like it would have been a bit too weak on the flavor. This has saved my pocketbook (and waistline) from Wawa Pumpkin Spice lattes! Thank you so much!

This is a nice flavored pumpkin spice latte, considering it doesn't even have pumpkin in it. I actually like it better than the fake tasting ones at Starbucks. The spice is nice and mild and not overpowering but the coffee is too light for me, and I used espresso. I had to use double the amount to get the flavor I wanted.

I made this to go with the whole "spiced" theme of the breakfast,
only I made it iced and with an extra "concentrated" shot. Nummy.

This was Yummy!  I have the Braun Tassimo TA1200 Single-Serve Hot-Beverage System
and I felt limited on flavors.  I used this recipe as a guide with my latte drink.  I put a Tbsp. of sugar, 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp of vanilla in the cup; then used the espresso cup for the machine and then the latte cup.  Once that was ready, I added whipped topping with a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice.  This smelled so wonderful and tasted just like spiced coffee I order from restaurants.
