This was a yummy bread to go with Potato Soup.  Our whole family-Mom, Dad, and 4 boys-loved it.  The only thing we would change is not as much mayo.  If you are not a big mayo person, you may want to reduce that part.

Wow!  This was great.   I did not measure the butter/mayo... I simply generously buttered the bread, then spread a thin layer of mayo.    The reviews said the Parmesan cheese ratio was way to much, so I just lightly sprinkled the bread with Parmesan.  Then I sprinkled garlic powder and topped generously with the other two cheeses.  I did not broil, just baked it at 350 for about 8-10 min. while my pasta cooked......and it was perfect.

I cut up real garlic and melted it with the butter in a bowl and then spread it on the bread, instead of using garlic salt, which was really good!

I LOVE THIS BREAD! I love bread and I have made many recipes and have to say that this one is now my favorite! I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the mayo back. I just spread an even layer of mayo on top of the butter. Instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder on top of the butter and mayo layer. It does broil fast...so make sure you keep a close eye on it! It melts in your mouth and my family loves it!! I have also added thinly sliced tomatoes on top of the butter/mayo layer for a little variety and it was yummy! Thanks for a great and easy recipe! My family adores this...and so do I!!

This was very good, but I admit I did make some changes.  1/2 cup mayo just seemed like overkill, honestly.  Why so much?  I lightly spread butter on my bread, and then very lightly spread some light mayo on.  I only used 1/2 cup of parm, but I kept the other cheeses the same.  I added 4 chopped garlic cloves.  It was wonderful, especially with the garlic.  I used an artisan loaf of multi-grain sourdough.  We had this with Wild Rice Chowder.

Very good.   I did not use any butter & did not use 1/2 c. mayo (I used Miracle Whip Light).  I also baked it rather than broil.

This bread was AWESOME! I took the advice of another reviewer n added sliced tomato...... Needless to say everyone is asking if I can make it again tomorrow! ;0) I also did not use as much mayo, just a light to regular layer. But even without the tomato (I made half w/ tomato half without) this bread is soooo much better then regular garlic bread. I will never make "regular" garlic bread again!

Yum! I needed a quick yet filling late-night snack for my husband when he got home from work, but I ended up eating it myself. I used leftover steak rolls instead of bigger bread, and it still worked very well. I followed some other people's advice as far as only spreading on a layer of mayo, mixing all the cheeses together, and baking instead of broiling - actually I baked it until everyhing started to melt, then broiled it on low for a few minutes to make the top toasty. Next time, I may try adding some canned chicken to the cheeses to make it a small meal, even though it is excellent as is.

We did NOT like the taste of hot mayo!!  I even drastically cut it down as suggested and only used a thin layer over the butter.

We thought this was delicious! I halved the amount of parmesan and used light mayo. Spread it on San Francisco Sourdough (from this site) and baked it on the bottom rack of the oven for about 5 minutes, just to crisp up the bottom, then broiled till bubbling. It would make a great appetizer. Loved it Debra!

Wow- I used english muffins, halved- I didn't measure the butter or mayonnaise, I just spread it on each halve, sprinkled the garlic salt and parmesan, and grated the cheddar cheese directly on each muffin. I broiled it on high, set my timer for 3 minutes several times and continued checking to make sure it wasn't burning. SUCH a yummy recipe!!

Well... not as good as I had hoped, but I will make again - minus the mayo and maybe the butter. Family didn't like it the way it is written, but there is hope with modifications, I think.

Wonderful bread!  I made my own French bread.  Then I took 2 T butter with 3 cloves garlic minced and cooked some in pan.  I smeared this on the bread and then smeared on Miracle Whip instead of Mayo.  I did the same amount of cheddar and mozerella and then sprinkled on Parmesan.   :)

I found there to be way to much parmesan cheese in this recipe, or maybe I mixed all three cheeses togethor before puting it on might work.  If not the top turned before the parmesan cooked on the bottom layer. Thanks anyway!

This is a great bread that tastes amazing with the marinara sauce 2 recipe from this site.  I kept everything the same except I used Miracle Whip instead of the mayonnaise.  I didn't measure out the Miracle Whip, but a half a cup would have been WAY too much.  I just spread on a generous layer of it and it turned out fine.  Be very careful though, I didn't even have the bread under the broiler for a full two minutes and it burnt!  Next time I will bake it so it can cook a bit longer with out burning it so badly.  Tastes awesome though, I will make it again.

Wow.  I thought this was wonderful.  I added a bit more cheese to it only because we LOVE cheese.  This was excellent.  It only took about 3-4 minutes under the broiler before it started to get crispy.  Excellent recipe and recommend to all.

We didn't have any mayo, but that might not have worked in it's favor.  
The garlic salt made it pretty saltier than we liked, maybe next time we'll just use chopped or minced garlic.  
The cheese combo was delicious!   I guess I never thought of putting cheddar on my garlic bread, and it worked very well!

My mom has made these all my life, we add scallions, mix it all together as a spread and then apply it to the breads. So Good!

I made this last night with Potato Soup and it was delicious!  I would probably use a little less mayo next time, but my family loved it.

It was good! For my recipe, I didn't measure the butter or mayo, I just put however much I wanted. I put it on two simple bread pieces and put a nacho cheese blend on it as well as garlic powder.
