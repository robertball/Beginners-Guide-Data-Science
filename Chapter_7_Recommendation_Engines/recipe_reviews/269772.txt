Delicious.  I used oven ready noodles but soaked them for two minutes in boiling water so I could cut them to fit in the peppers.  Also, I always blanch my peppers for 10 minutes before stuffing them.

Just the right size for two of us. Only had enough meat for 3 peppers but I had large peppers. Will definitely make again

Delicious! Way more stuffing than the peppers would hold so I also ended up with a mini-lasagna.

Easy to make and absolutely delicious. My husband loved it. I hate leftovers but ate the leftover pepper for dinner the next evening and it was just as good. You could easily make this with ground beef or chicken and adjust the spices to fit the situation.

This was a delicious portion-controlled version of lasagna.  The peppers were tender and the filling well-balanced.  I added a dollop more ricotta than the recipe required to insure generous layers.  I'm a lazy cook, but this was well worth the effort.

Italian sausage adds a little kick but i would recommend a dash of red pepper flakes. I also used Red Peppers which give it a sweeter taste. Everyone loved it.
