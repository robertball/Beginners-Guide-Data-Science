My first reaction was yuck. It got a little better after it cooled slightly. I only made one sandwichbut threw most of it away. My son hated it.

Really good, but I still prefer the grilled PB&J sandwich on this site.

My daughter made these as a late night snack for us and it was a nice twist on the original. Just watch cuz the PB does get a little runny and hot. It is great that way though.

We did this recipe and also the Griled Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches recipe on this site. The other one won out.
