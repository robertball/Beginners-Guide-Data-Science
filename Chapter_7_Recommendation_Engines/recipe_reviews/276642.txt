I've made these for years, only I add chocolate chips to mine to add a little extra fun and of course for our chocolate lovers in the family.  I fold them in at the end before spooning them out to set overnight.

Our family has been making these as long as I can remember, Mother, Grand Mother, and Iâ€™m carrying on the tradition.  When I get it right they are perfect.
