I have been searching for a "Healthy" bread recipe and one that I could incorporate with more flax seed.  Well, this is the one!!  This is a fantastic bread recipe.  I believe this is healthy AND tastes good.  This is a nice heavy bread and is so good toasted.  I used 1/2 cup flax seed in place of the grapenuts & it turned out perfectly.  

I am going to make my next batch into rolls. I think they would go over really well in this family.

Thanks so much for the great recipe.

This bread rocked, and our family didn't think that this bread was too sweet, especially for meats like honey baked ham or turkey.  I used 1/2c. flax seed instead of grapenuts because I didn't have any grapenuts in the house.  I also cooked it at 375 for about 35 minutes and let it have 2 risings.  (I don't have a bread machine.)  Delicious!! Try it!  you won't be disapointed!

I am russian and been loking for  taste of the bread like I had at  my homeland .This bread has very close taste to my childhood's bread.Very good!!!I didn't use honey and brown sugar (I don't like sweet bread.I am excepting sweeteness in the cake,not bread)I added 2 tablespoon white sugar so yeast rise well,but it didn't give sweeteness to bread,just perffect balance of the taste

this bread was delicious.  i left out the sugar as it was sweet enough with just the honey and used a combination of cracked wheat and flax seeds instead of the grape nuts.  thanks for the great recipe.

I made this bread yesterday afternoon exactly a written in a Sunbeam on whole wheat setting.  Nice flavor but very dry and crumbly. Won't make it again.

This was a delicious loaf!  I didn't have any grapenuts cereal, so I just used the equivalent measurement of Multigrain Cheerios.....what a success :)

Super super bread! I halved this recipe since my bread maker has a small flour capacity and it turned out one small loaf that was completely devoured by 3 people before it had time to cool (literally, it was gone in about 10 minutes). This is SO good and I love the fact that it's not too sweet and it has a great crust and texture.

Great bread!  I knew this would be eaten quickly, so I doubled the recipe!  Instead of using brown sugar, I just used more honey.  This bread bakes nicely in bread pans in a 400 oven for 30 minutes.

Very nice bread!  I love that it uses my favorite cereal, too--gives me a wonderful reminder to buy it!  I left out the brown sugar bc I figured the honey was enough, and I added 1 tbs of vital wheat gluten since I don't have bread flour.  It was a bit dry; had to add 1/4 cup of water to get it to make a workable dough, but that's okay.  It's not uncommon to have to add liquid or dry ingredients to get the correct consistency with bread.  I baked in the oven at 375 for 50 minutes and got a nice browned and crunchy loaf.  thanks for the recipe!

very good bread: nice texture, great taste.  Great way to use up Grape-nut cereal that I bought during a weak moment, then regretted...

This was such a wonderful bread! A great change and accompanied our St. Patrick's Day dinner beautifully! It is sweeter than normal breads, but everyone in the family liked it a lot. I'll be using this recipe again! One Change, I didn't have any Grapenuts, so I used 1/2 cup milled flax seed

I loved this--it's sweeter than most yeast breads, but not as sweet as a cinnamon bread. You can definitely taste the honey, and best of all, it's got a slight crunch from the Grape Nuts.

I really shouldn't rate this, because I didn't have the cereal and used oats instead. BUT it was delicious!!
