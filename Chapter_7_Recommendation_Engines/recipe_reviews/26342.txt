fantastic recipe - my boyfriend loved it. be sure and cook the pudding mixture until it is *very* thick (I cooked mine until it was so thick it almost wouldn't bubble anymore), and it will set up perfectly and keep for several days.

this was a huge hit and i have been asked twice for the recipe. the 2nd time i made this i used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg and when i put in the rum i also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  (the 1st time was a trial run and the 2nd for thanksgiving dinner )
 i kept in fridge overnight and until it was time to serve and it got quite runny after a short time sitting on counter. the 2nd time i froze it overnight and transferred to the frige in the morning until time to serve. this was much better ! i really wanted something different and unique and this was excellent ! 
the only other thing i recommend is that you look up the meaning of fold in a cook book -that helped me the 2nd time. i have been asked to bring this for x-mas as well --- thanks rodney !

Yummy is correct.  I made this for a christmas pie.  I followed the recipe exactly and it set perfectly.  When cooking the pudding I cooked until it was very thick.  I let it cool completly in the refrig.  When it was time to beat/mix the cooled pudding it was to thick so I had to beat it with some of the whipped cream first.  When it was beat then I folded in the rest of the whipped cream.  It set nicely.  Next time I think I will try it with a graham cracker crust.

This sure was yummy!  I had to make no-bake pies for Thanksgiving as our antique stove wasn't yet hooked up to the gas.  Made a Chocolate Eggnog Pie once and wasn't impressed..but decided to try this one anyway.  Ohmigod, it was out of this world!!  Gotta be an eggnog lover for this one, it was fantastic! The only thing different I did was to beat the cream to stiffer peaks.  Then I folded the cream in, and left it to chill overnight. You will not be dissapointed in the pie!

Outstanding! My husband and kids love it. I cut the cream in half and added 2 tbl of rum and 1 tsp of vanilla. The consistency was perfect, like a banana cream pie. I could eat the whole thing myself! I plan to make this again for an upcoming family Christmas party.

Fantastic!  Made this for Christmas dinner for the first time.  Made a day ahead for maximum chill time.  Was a hit with everyone.  Very rich and creamy - great with coffee.

Nice, smooth flavor.  But, it didn't set up at all, it's more like pudding than pie.  I noticed a few other reviewers had the same problem...maybe I needed to cook the pudding a little longer.  I rated it a 3 simply because we had to eat it with a spoon, rather than slice it.
I will try using this recipe in a trifle because the flavor is delicious and light.

This is for eggnog lovers only! We love eggnog, so naturally we loved this pie. It had such an intense egg nog flavor that I think next time I may substitute a bit of the eggnog for whole milk. Mine set up very well, just following the directions. Be sure to use cook and serve pudding and not instant and cook til it is very thick. I used Cool Whip instead of heavy cream and it turned out great. I had to beat the coolwhip and chilled pudding mixture together to get it the right consistency and no lumps. I used a graham cracker crust. A great pie for the holidays!

This was a great recipe! I do recommend it frozen or defrosted VERY shortly before serving. If you're going to make more then one just make sure you have a big enough mixing bowl! I did cut out almost 1/3 of the cream, but then again I tripled the recipe! Anyway, maybe experiment before bringing one to the dinner party... =)

I won 3rd place in the dessert contest at a Christmas Party last year.  A couple of the judges came up to me and told me they never heard or tasted a eggnog pie.  They loved it.

This pie has become a requested tradition at our holiday feasts.  I'd be disappointing everyone if I didn't make it as often as possible while eggnog is available.  I absolutely love this recipe - Thanks, Rodney!

Oh, my, this is rich, but I knew it would be. :) I followed the recipe pretty closely. I forgot to add the rum extract before chilling the pudding (which was so thick that stirring it was tough) so I added it before beating the pudding later on. Oh, and I only used 1Â½ cups heavy cream and I beat it to just shy of stiff peaks (I wanted to be sure it would hold its shape in the crust!). I needed to add a little of the semi-stiff cream to the pudding when beating it. I used a pie crust made from crushed 'almond snap' cookies and butter (baked at 350 for 8 minutes, cooled before filling!), the subtle almond flavor complimented the egg nog nicely. I forgot the extra nutmeg on top, but that was quite fine too. One more thing: I made it around 9 pm Christmas Eve, covered it and stuck it in the fridge overnight, and we ate dessert maybe 6 pm Christmas Day. It held its shape beautifully and was a cinch to cut. Thanks, Rodney. We're all egg nog addicts and this was a nice way to include it in our Christmas dinner dessert!

Instead of folding in the whipped cream, I made it a double layer, with the egg nog flavored custard on the bottom and the whipped cream on top. Very good and gives a better presentation.

This pie was so delicious.  I made it for a family Christmas party and everyone raved over it.  The pie wasn't liquid but I would have liked it a bit more set but I think the reason it did not set up so well was because the box of cook and serve pudding I got was 3oz and that was Jello brand.  I don't know if another brand makes the right size box but missing 1.6 ounces of the thickening agent could be the reason so many people on here haven't had a real firm pie.  I would definately make this again.

This turned out very well for the Xmas holidays. what I did was use it as a filling for the Kuchen shell by SHER15, I added more fresh ground nutmeg,3 cap fulls of spiced dark rum, and cooled the mixture in the freezer for an hour. then proceeded with step 2, but the key thing is after folding in the whipped cream (used heavy cream) put it in the shell and wait a night before serving, the flavours will blend nicely.

This is fantastic!!! All of our Christmas guests loved it....I had no problems with it setting up and the flavor was excellent. I did take one reviewers suggestion and used half the amount of whipping cream and not having rum I used 2 tablespoons of whiskey. I'm not sure why some people had problems with it setting up unless they accidently used instant instead of the pudding you have to cook. Everyone loved it and next time I'll have to make two pies!!!!

I had leftover eggnog from Christmas and didn't want to waste it.  Found this recipe and it's great!  My husband loves it!  I'm a BIG fan of Nutella so I warmed some in the microwave for 30 seconds, put it in a baggie, snipped off a corner and drizzled it all over the pie.  It was a great addition.

I wasn't totally thrilled with this recipe, and I love eggnog. I love how easy it was to make, but it was lacking something - I can't quite put my finger on it. The texture was nice and fluffy, which is great after a heavy holiday meal. I probably wouldn't make it again, though.

Delicious!!! Super easy. Cook the pudding until very thick. I made the recipe verbatim first and it was great. Second time I used cool whip instead of homemade whipped cream and it turned out just fine. I also tripled the rum, I couldn't taste it at all the first time. Serve frozen - it's delicious!

This was pretty good.  I used a graham cracker crumb pie crust and liked it for the contrasting crunchiness since this pie is so creamy.  I think I will try halving the recipe and spooning it into mini phyllo tart shells.

This is a great, light pie. A nice alternative to pumpkin pie, and very kid friendly. I used a graham cracker crust. Like others stated, you must cook the pudding mixture until it is VERY thick, almost gooey. It takes a little more work to fold it in to the whipped topping, but it will set well.

I loved the idea of this pie as something unique over the holidays, but yet made with something common over the holidays. My pie didn't set up as well as I'd hoped, so I stuck it in the freezer and froze until firm. We quite enjoyed it frozen with additional whipped cream on top.

Wow, is this rich. Cut the pieces small! I thought this had way too much cream. I whipped the cream, and ended up with enough filling for two pies! If I make this again I will use half the amount of cream called for and leave out the rum.

I used a prebaked graham craker crust. I brushed the crust with egg white and popped it in the oven on 375 for 5 minutes. I let the crust cool before filling. This pie has a nice creamy texture- easy to make- friends raved about it. I left out the rum and it still tasted great!

Great pie that's become a holiday standard. Easy to make and a little too easy to eat--if I don't watch myself, I'll eat half of it by myself. It's always well-received and I'm often asked for the recipe. Everyone's always surprised at how easy it is. Definitely a keeper.

This pie had a delicious flavor to it.  I like this one a lot better than the one floating around that calls for instant pudding. This one is very thick and filling!

I found this recipe 22 years ago on the back of an eggnog container.  Wanted to know if there was a new version of it but it's exactly the same.  It's a winner every time I make it.  Just sent husband to work with two of them for a holiday party and it was a hit.  I add the real rum, and use a graham cracker crust.  YUM!!

My husband's coworkers keep a look out for the eggnog to hit the grocery shelves, then promptly tell him to tell me so that I can make them this pie.

I was absolutely skeptical about this whole concept. I am super picky about my eggnog. I left the rum out of this (our family believes that eggnog is best pure and not watered down by the alcohol) and was very light handed with the nutmeg (I find it to be a very over-powering spice). I unfortunately forgot to take a picture and there was nothing left after it hit the table. This is gonna be a new family tradition. THANK YOU so much for sharing this!

I've made 4 of these this year.  My family loves it.  I used a whisk to mix the eggnog,pudding mix and nutmeg on the stove top.  You must cook the mixture until it is very thick. I used heavy whipping cream and a stand mixer and whipped it until I had very stiff peaks.  All of them turned out beautiful and delicious.  Even used a graham cracker crust on one.     :)

I made this pie for Christmas, and it is YUMMY!!!! Just like the name says! It was easy to make and has a wonderful taste and texture! I added a little extra nutmeg and used rum extract and put it in a graham cracker crust! I will definitely make this one again. My sister thought it was a store-bought pie!

I made this for my daughter's pie tasting event in her classroom and it got the most votes for best pie! I followed the recipe exactly(but used graham cracker crust), paying attention to the reviews that suggested cooking it until it was very thick. It was delicious.

This is really rich, so one pie goes a long way! I modified it by first baking a basic pumpkin pie, freezing it, then making this pie and layering it on top. I kept it in the freezer like other recommended, and the consistency turned out perfect.

The only change I make is that I omit the rum and use vanilla in its place.  My family loves when I make this pie as our Christmas dinner dessert.

This recipe was very yummy.  Being only a 2 person family, I decided to cut the recipe in half.  I used the small box of cooked pudding instead.  I cooked the pudding to real thick, refridgerate for 2 hours or so.  Then whipped the cream real stiff and fold that in and set the pie over night in the fridge.  Wonderful.  I've made it several times now and have shared it with others.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and I am preparing to make it again this year.  If you have to eat it frozen or with a spoon, you didn't let it thicken enough!  It needs to be more flubber consistency before you stop cooking it. (Once you add the whipped cream, it will be prefect).

This was awesome! Made enough for two pies. The hardest part is whipping the cream, but that is an awesome activity, made easier with chilled metal bowls.

I started making this pie 15 years ago, out of a wild idea, (Shamrock foods was the first contest i entered it in) i use instant pudding,  and sub eggnog for the milk, and add 2 packets of dream whip with pudding and whip, then fold in fresh whip cream at the end, It is so much better if you use fresh nutmeg from the nut itself.

Wonderful recipe. The people at my work loved it! No leftovers for me. I would add a little less whipped cream, maybe a cup and a half instead of two cups. And also a little more rum. I'm thinking 5 teaspoons instead of 2.

Excellent flavour. Dusted mine with cinnamon and vanilla powder.  I did use a 9.5 pie pan, as the filling is quite a lot.  Also, I only had a 3oz package of pudding, not 4.6 oz.  After chilling the pudding mixture, make sure to stir it very well then fold in with a third of the heavy cream.  Then the remaining 2/3 of the heavy cream to keep it from being too deflated.

This was a huge hit! I took others' advice and froze them overnight, helped with the travel time to work too. Also used a pre-made graham cracker crust(toasted per package instructions). It was a bit sweet, but hey, it's the holidays! Also used the tub cool whip because I didn't buy enough heavy cream. That might be why it was so sweet.

Very good, but does require a lot of cream.  Also, the slices didn't hold the form since it was pudding-like, but overall a great holiday recipe.

If you are like me and burn your pudding on the bottom, I have found that heating my milk or eggnog in this case before cooking it with the pudding on a double boiler helps A LOT!  The pie was really yummy, maybe to creamy which seems weird to say.  I would try the recipe out before you bring it to a gathering so you can tweek it if needed.  I will make it again, didn't know there was an eggnog pie, how festive!

Wonderful pie--very light and fluffy.  I used my own, tried-and-true pastry recipe, but followed the recipe for the filling.  This was a nice alternative to other, heavy desserts.  I will definitely make this again--I think it's now a Christmas tradition!

This was so easy and so delicious.  I used a tsp of rum extract instead of real rum, but stuck to the recipe exactly other than that.  It was creamy and so festive.  The kids loved it too. I will definitely make this again.

Nice creamy taste.  Would only be able to eat a small slice at a time though since it's pretty rich tasting.  Would make again, though this time i would actually bake the crust (which i'm an idiot and forgot to do)

This was a fantastic pie and gone in a flash at a Christmas party. I made mine with a homemade graham cracker crust. I traveled 1.5 hours to a party the day it was served. I put it in the freezer for two hours beforehand and the pie maintained a nice whipped texture by the time we arrived.

Tasted great, but using it as a pie filling didn't go over well.  Substitute the pie crust to a graham cracker crust would make it better.  I used the remaining filling as a dip with graham crackers.  That went over better than the pie.

Not sure what we did, but this did not take well. Although the taste was very nice.  I believe this may have ben operator error.

Taste delicious but does not set right. Looks more like pudding after you add the heavy cream. Next time I'll add less heavy cream and see if it sets right added some whip cream from the can on top and some nutmeg other then that great recipe

My family enjoyed the pie not a strong alcohol presents.  The only thing the pie did not thicken up.

I agree with all the other reviews.  Great taste, awkward conistency.  I made it twice, second time was better when I cooked pudding until VERY thick and bubbly.  Then I really beat the cream A LOT and I thawed it in the freezer.  Also, I couldn't find heavy cream, so I substituted 1 1/2 cups whipping dream, worked great.  Not sure I'll make this again anytime soon.

This recipe was so easy and fast, it felt like cheating!   Adding pumpkin spice to the top of the pie instead of nutmeg added an extra layer of taste to the pie.  I also used graham cracker pie crust, which was so yummy.  This is perfect for someone looking for a delicious and unique Christmas dessert!

This is a big hit at our Christmas dinner - especially with those who get tired of pumpkin pie.  It is really refreshing and tasty.

Served to relatives at Thanksgiving, and they ate every crumb! At their suggestion I tried freezing one before serving, and it was great that way, too!

This pie was a smash hit.  I made it for Christmas dinner.  It went well with dinner because it is silky smooth and light so everyone had room for a piece (and wanted more).
