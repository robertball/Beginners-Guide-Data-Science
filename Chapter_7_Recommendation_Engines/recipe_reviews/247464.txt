**  My picture is the dark soup with the whisk in it** I made a few changes to this recipe and it came out amazing. First off, are used wild mushrooms that I forged and dried from earlier this year. Are used golden chanterelles, Cinnabar red chanterelles, and hen-of-the-woods. I also only sprinkled a little bit of oregano no because I wasn’t so sure this was the right herb for this dish.  I added a dash of Cayanne pepper. I also added a very large spoon of puréed pumpkin.  At the end I took a little bit in 2 cups and add heavy cream to one and sour cream to the other. Both were very good with the flavor but the heavy cream with a little bit better. I ultimately use the sour cream because I needed to have a cream for whipping cream today.

This is another variation on cream of mushroom soup that's delicious. I recently enjoyed a cream of mushroom soup at a restaurant, which used tarragon. A very nice addition or alternative to a thyme based soup. I used thyme and tarragon, along with a bit of sherry, for a rich a delicious cream of mushroom soup.
