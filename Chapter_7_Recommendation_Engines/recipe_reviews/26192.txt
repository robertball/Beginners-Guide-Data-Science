These are wonderful! Iâ€™ve made them twice, the first time as stated and watched as my roommates devoured them. And the second time just today but this time instead I substituted lemon juice and zest for all things orange, at the request of one of my roommates, absolutely delicious as lemon drop cookies too!

That was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used butter in both cases instead of margarine. Perfect result. Cakey, and soft cookie. I sanwiched the icing between two cookies, and felt that something was missing, so I dipped half of the whole into melted chocolate glaze. Perfect combination of flavors! You can't go wrong with orange and chocolate! Thanks for the recipe, pretty and delish!

Very easy and quite good. I was a little concerned when I was mixing the batter since the consistency was a little gooey but it was great in the end. the sour cream really makes the cookies light and fluffy. Next time I make these I will use a bigger bowl to mix in, medium was too small. the dough spattered when I mixed all the flour (one cup at a time) in. The icing was easier to work with once it cooled down and became thicker.  I will add a little more orange peel zest to the icing next time, just for  a stronger flavor. Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper.

These were a hit at my party. The recipe certainly made plenty. Instead of dropping them by the spoofulls, I pipped them out into small little rosettes and used the icing to sandwich 2 of the cookies together. These freeze very well and are very tasty. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a very good cookie and a versatile base for variations.  I have done a lemon version (excellent) and today a cranberry-orange version. I added a large handful of dried cranberries that I ran through the food chopper. Tasty!!

Delish!  Co-workers were ridiculously enthusiastic.  Wish I'd doubled the frosting, though.

I was looking for a good orange cookie recipe and I found a great one! Make sure you use a zester for the orange zest. If you grate it the cookies won't be nearly as good. This recipe makes a lot, so store them in the freezer with waxed paper between layers.  They freeze and thaw well.  They are a little bit of work, but well worth it in my book.  Yum!

Just made these tonight. Delicious!  They took 10 minutes in my oven, and instead of the recipe for the icing, I felt the cookie rich enough as I used butter, so I made a mixture of icing sugar and orange juice and brushed it over each cookie.  So good.  Great for young children as well.

Texture was very good - light and tender. I would, however,  always sift my dry ingredients before adding. The only other issue I had with this recipe is to add some vanilla extract. I made it once, as written , and then again with the addition of vanilla. The second batch was much better, with the cookies having more depth of flavor. I added 1 tsp to the batter and also  1/2 tsp to the frosting.

These were pretty good at first.  But they got kind of soggy.  I also had a terrible time getting the frosting to be the right consistency.  I had to add a lot more powdered sugar.

I really liked this recipe!  I substituted butter for margarine, in the cookie dough and in the icing, and added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. orange extract to the cookie dough.  I did not put the zest in the icing, only in the cookie, but the end result was a nice, delicate orange flavour, not too overpowering.  I only added 2Tbsp of orange juice to the icing, making a sticky Buttercream type frosting.  This recipe makes a lot of cookies, but there wasn't quite enough icing for all of them.  I will definitely be making these again!

Delicious as written. I used Wilton cookie sheets and they did stick a little, will use parchment paper next time. Excellent recipe for a shower or party.

Loved these, especially the frosting.  Without the frosting, the cookies are not that sweet, but the frosting makes them really good.  They are soft and cake-like cookies that the whole family really liked.

These are definitely interesting - but that's a good thing!  They are cake-like, as the description states, and remind me of cupcakes.  They're delicious!

My only qualm is my own fault: I made them a bit too thick.  I liked Dree's idea and did it myself, but they're simply a little on the large side.  Next time I'll just have to make them thinner!

Absolutely wonderful cookies.   I baked on parchment paper and they set up beautifully.  Doubled the frosting recipe.  I topped one batch with melted white chocolate thinned with a little cream and some orange juice stirred together.  Also excellent.

I used butter hoping the flour-y taste would be less noticable....the icing helps, but I must continue my search for cakey texture but better flavor.

Great recipe, had plenty of frosting. I added some cream cheese to make the frosting not so sweet.  I'd probably make more of a cream cheese frosting next time.  Still a great and easy recipe.

These were fantastic!!  I dipped some in chocolate.  I also kept some without icing and they were great too.  My husband took a couple dozen to work and they couldn't stop raving about them. Easy recipe to follow.  Give these a try you'll love them!!:)

These are, by far, THE BEST cookie I have ever eaten.  I followed the recipe exactly and them came up so moist and soft (cake-like).  I used exactly 3 large oranges for the zest, plus the juice from these oranges was exactly 2/3 of a cup!  My Italian family absolutely loved these.  I wouldn't change a single thing about this recipe. Yum!

Wow these are awesome! Very light and moist!! I can't wait to bring these in to my company's potluck tomorrow. I added some food coloring to the frosting to make it orange for halloween, and added a few chocolate chips (see photo). I, like others, made more frosting (just half). Also I baked on parchment paper which worked out great. Thanks for the recipe!

These are fantastic, nice and light, soft and moist. The flavor is wonderfull, but I'm sure I probably put in more zest then called for, I also used fresh squeezed juice. These freeze very well, I always make sure to have some in the freezer for unexpected guests and to put on trays for hostess gifts ( I never go anywere empty handed).

These are a lot like cookies I made all during my family's growing years,  (I had lost the recipe in many moves,,,)  I love them...need lots of willpower to keep from eating too many of them!

It is warm where I live, and I keep them in the fridge--even in the winter--to keep icing from getting soft.!

Really tasty, very soft and muffin-like, which I'm okay with, and kindof expected by reading the ingredients. Any muffin batter can be baked as a drop cookie, actually. I used butter and light sour cream, zested 3 oranges which yeilded me exactly 2/3 cup of juice, and I added chocolate chips and skipped the frosting. I even baked some of the batter as muffins, which turned out really well.

did not like these at all!  too cakey.  I almost felt like I was eating muffin tops rather than cookies.    I gave it 1 star because cookies were "orangey" but this is not a recipe I will ever try again (unless I'm in the mood for muffin tops).

hmm..not what I was hoping for.   They are indeed cakey..really cakey.  Like a cupcake top.  I guess I was hoping for something with a little more "substance" to it?   The frosting had nice flavor though and I'd use that again on another cookie recipe.   If you want something like a mini-cake then this would be for you.

This is a perfect tea cookie, soft and cake like. Just the right amount of orange flavoring. I used butter and also made extra frosting. Using a #70 cookie scoop I got 118 tea cakes with this recipe. I will use this for my next tea party.

Delicious. Very soft and not too much orange flavor. Will definitely be making these again.

Good at first...but did not keep my family's hand in the cookie jar and asking for more. When a cookie gets old in this house, it is not considered a hit.

Delicious! The cookie itself is not very sweet..(which is good thing b/c the icing that goes on top is).  I used vegetable oil as a substitute for the margarine (didn't have any).  Also used whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose, no one was the wiser.  Will be making again for sure!

I've made these for Christmas the last couple of years and will make them again this year. I think the cookies are good but everyone else thinks they are amazing and they get eaten very quickly. They taste a little like trix cereal to me. Mine flatten out a lot during baking and look like little pancakes maybe because I use butter instead of margarine. Also I've tried freezing them and they do retain their flavor but they stick together a lot even though I flash freeze them first. They are definitely better with the icing.

These are great cookies and speedy vs. cutout cookies.  I make them at Christmas time too, just use different colored frostings.  For Easter, pastel colors are great.  I use a butter-cream frosting on them - my basic cookie frosting recipe.

Really good, took some time (I gave up on grating for the frosting, just used orange extract since I ran out of oranges) and used butter and a teaspoon of vanilla.  Almost scone-like with a mild orange flavor that makes them addictive.  You'll definitely share these, recipe makes a lot.

These turned out great. I didn't add the orange zest to the icing, cause I ran out. The cookies are a little dry and better with the icing

These are definitely cake like as advertised.  I halved the recipe and used my medium cookie scoop to make the cookies.  I ended up with 30 large (to me) cookies that baked perfectly in 8 minutes.  I didn't use the frosting recipe exactly, as I have whipped cream cheese frosting in the can, so I added some orange juice and zest to get it to taste orangey.  Worked really well.  Easy to frost, good to eat.  Thanks!

These are too cake-like for me.  They have a nice flavor but I like my cookies chewy. If I want something that has the texture of a cake I'll bake a cake. 
I found that the smaller you make them the better they work.  Too big and they get too dark on the bottom.
You don't need to use much of the orange juice to make the icing, I only needed 1 Tbsp.  After grating the orange rinds, I put them in a bowl and snipped them with scissors until they were small enough.

I made these cookies, I didn't add any extra flour, as suggested, so they did spread a bit more than I thought they would. They came out absolutely delicious! My husband took them to a work party and people enjoyed them so much they asked to take some home.  I'm thinking of making them with Lemon next. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

The cookie itself was blander than I was expecting, and the frosting was runny and difficult to work with.  Combined with the tops of the cookies being round, it meant most of the frosting ended up running off, leaving a sugary shell, even though I added twice as much sugar as recommended to try and thicken it and also didn't use all of the orange juice.

If I try this again, I will probably:
 - use a spoon to flatten the cookies a little before baking
 - Use a different recipe for frosting and add the grated zest to that.
 - Possibly try to increase the cookie's flavor with extra zest or orange extract.

(BTW - I got enough zest and juice for the recipe using 6 oranges, if anyone's curious how many it takes.  Also, the recipe's numbers are pretty easy to halve, since this makes a ton.)

Growing up my grandmother would make these around Christmas time every year. She passed away a few years ago and so my family had kinda lost the recipe. They had always been my favorite cookie and while a couple family members have tried to replicate it they've usually fallen a bit short. I found this recipe and decided to try myself. I replaced the margarine with butter because margarine isn't real food and added a splash of vanilla extract but otherwise I followed exactly and they were absolutely delicious. It  really helped bring back memories as they tasted so similar. I will be making these again. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough icing, and I didn't use much per cookie,  so I'll scale that up a bit next time

I have been making orange cookies every year at Christmas for many years.  I tried this recipe this year. My husband said these were the best ones yet. Will save this recipe for many years to come. I used butter, we do not use margarine.

I was very excited to try this recipe, as a sort of welcome to spring, and I had several orange laying around. But it did not turn out very good at all. I was extremely disappointed. The cookies turned out too soggy. The texture was a little off too. But this could have been an error on my part, I'm not sure.

These were amazing! I had a hard time keeping on the cookie rack cooling, everyone just came and stole multiples at a time! Making the batter I had my doubts, because of the sour cream it did smell a little funky to me. But when they came out of the oven they were ahhh-mazing! Also I did have a little trouble with the icing, but I just added more confectioner sugar and it turned out fine! I do agree that the icing was more citrus-y then the actual cookie, but together they were a smash!!!! great recipe!!! I will definitely make them again!!!

these aren't really special. they aren't bad, but they aren't anything i will make again. i wanted to make a cookie that wasn't "standard", and citrus sounded good. the cookies are very cake-like, which is fine, but the flavor is very muted. and they are not as orangey as the frosting. i'll eat them, but i doubt even my six-year-old will ask for them. no one raved.

i enjoyed these. my partner wasn't a big fan and neither were a couple of her co-workers.
make sure to grate the orange zest really well...my grater isn't the best so i had to use the bigger side. not the best idea since having bigger chunks of orange peel to chew through isn't really pleasant.
i doubled the frosting as well as done by a previous reviewer said. good idea because the frosting highlights the cookie well.
