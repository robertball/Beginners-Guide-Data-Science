I made these for the first time this morning, exactly as the directions stated.  The results were flat, burned on top, raw inside BUT smelled awesome.  Since I think this recipe has great potential, I wanted to post my ideas.  First, I think real butter would be better than shortening, personal prefernece.  Secondly, instead of baking soda, I think you need baking powder because they didn't have nice peaks, they were flat and they sunk in after they cooled a bit.  Also, I think tossing in chopped dates, walnuts, and raisins right before filling the muffin cups would be fantastic.  I think baking them at a lower temperature longer would elimintate the overdone outside/raw inside problem.  And next time I'm going to use pastry flour because these had flour lumps in them and I don't want to bother sifting.  Lastly, I think adding an additional 1/2 cup of brown sugar would be even better!

I was sad to see this recipe get low ratings, as it is one of our favorites!  I make no changes except to make them into mini muffins (easier for mini mouths)...bake at 400 for 10 to 12 min.  As long as you cream the brown sugar with the butter first before you add the milk it blends beautifully.  I do sometimes top these with a little cinn. sugar or a powdered sugar/cinn glaze drizzled over top.  These are awesome!

Yummy recipe! My sister loved it! Used butter instead of shortening and ended up with 18 muffins. Also set the oven to 380 degrees and coked them for 17 minutes, came out like a dream. Also teastes great when you sprinkle more brown sugar over the top before you put them in the oven!

I make these with butter (room temp) instead of shortening because I am not a fan.  No other changes.  They are delicious.  They are a denser muffin.  Served up with cinnamon butter they never make it through the day.

Nice recipe, very tender result right out of the oven, good flavor with the brown sugar.   The next day the muffins were good too, and not too dry or dense.  I added a little crumb topping  to the baking process, you can find a good version of the crumb topping with the recipe "Blueberry Crumb Muffins."  Will be making these again!

I followed the recipe exactly as is and had great success.  The creamed brown sugar and shortening doesn't quite want to blend into the milk, but turned into great little pockets of sweetness inside the muffins.  I also ended up with 18 muffins instead of 12.

The review that suggested cooking at a lower temp for longer was right on.  I did all of the suggestions she stated (except for adding fruit to the muffins) and they turned out tasty and fully cooked.  They never did get to be a fluffy muffin like one would hope but the flavor was still good.

I figured the person who posted this made a mistake with the different powder ...so i also corrected it ...they turned out fine for me...but they were a little dry, i did them a second time with a little sourcream in the batter ...that was very good. keeps them moist.

These are awesome!  My kids loved them! But I would bake them at a lower temp for a little bit longer.  Plus, I would make 18 of them instead of 12.

Great recipe! I took the advice of others and baked them at 380 degrees for 17 minutes. I also added a dash or two of cinnamon and nutmeg. Delicious and perfectly moist!

These were great!  Real good with a cup of coffee.  I used a mini muffin pan and baked for 10 minutes.  I don't use shortening when I bake so I used butter instead.

You could really taste the shortening and I used exactly what the recipe called for.

These were pretty good, but they didn't quite get the crusty top I expected - more of a thin layer.  Nice texture, but just kind of "there" - kind of on the bland side.  I might make again just because they call for shortening instead of butter and they're quick.

Bumping this up a star because my family really liked them and wants them again.
