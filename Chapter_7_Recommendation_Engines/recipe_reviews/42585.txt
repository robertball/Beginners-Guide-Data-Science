Very Good, I changed a few things to make this restaurant quality: I only used 2 shallots, finely chopped, no onions, only 1/2 lb bacon and 4 boneless skinless chicken breast, 1 can peas, 1 cup heavy cream, 4 egg yolks, 1& 1/2 c shredded parm cheese and 3 cloves garlic. I grilled the chicken breast, slice them thin and set aside. I also cooked the bacon along with the shallots, then added garlic. I added the peas (drained) and the chicken at the end, topped with fresh cracked pepper. Very good and VERY easy

OH MY GOD!  This recipe was so good I cried eating it. And afterward, I wished I could spend the rest of my life with a woman who could cook like this.

My DH and I made this for supper last night, and the end result was pretty good, but we did change the recipe quite a bit; here is what we did.  We were only cooking for 3 people, so we cut the recipe in half for starters (using only 1/2 lb of linguini).  We cut the bacon into small pieces and browned; about halfway through the browning process, we  added a half a large  onion, diced (it could have used more though).  Once the onion was cooked and a bit caramelized, we added 1 clove of garlic, minced (should have used 2 cloves).  We cooked that together just until the garlic was fragrant and meanwhile we cooked the pasta.  In a small bowl, we whisked together 2 eggs, 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup whole milk (we didn't have any cream on hand), 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg and pepper.  Once the pasta was done cooking, we added it to the pan with the bacon and onions, piled it up high and dumped the egg mixture on top.  Working quickly we folded the egg mixture into the pasta so as not to cook the eggs.  Once thoroughly mixed, we removed it from the heat, tossed in some fresh flat leaf parsley and ate it (topped with more fresh parmesan and pepper).  It was very tasty and we will make it again (with my suggestions) for sure.

I have made this many times and my family loves it!  I, however, fry the bacon cut up first,remove some of the bacon fat and then fry the onions, shallot and garlic.  This gives a good flavor.  I also temper the egg yolks by warming the cream and temper the egg yolks and then put it all together. Love it!

Too much grease and oil, so with some modifications this was a 5 star recipe. 

I cut the bacon back by 1/3 and fried it first (set it aside.) Then I drained off more than half the grease and sauteed the onion in it. (Didn't have a shallot so skipped it.) When the onions were almost done added 3 crushed cloves of garlic and a couple tablespoons of chicken broth. Used 3 eggs instead of 4 egg yolks and whipped them into 1 and 1/2 cups of heavy cream. Then when pasta was done I tossed it with the onion/garlic mixture and added the cream/egg mixture to it, cooking and tossing until it started thickening. Then I added 1 cup of parmesan and 1/3 cup mozzarella and tossed. Then seasoned it with a little nutmeg, black and cayenne pepper, and salt.

delicious and easy!
I've made this one a few times already, each time slightly altering it with whatever I can find in the refrigerator. Great with mushrooms and sauteed in white wine. Thanks!

This was very good.  I thought it was weird, not to cook the eggs, but it turned out well.  I didn't have any shallots so I skipped that part, drained all the bacon grease, and used only half the noodles.  I was great!

I could feel the inches being added to my waistline, but this was without a doubt one of the most delicious dishes ever!  I cooked the bacon separately to make it crisp, then cooked the onion, shallots (only 2) and garlic in the drippings.  I also used a full cup of heavy cream.

This dish made my family go nuts! A little change I made was to deglaze the pan after removing the chicken, with about a third of a cup of dry white wine (which was just sitting there, open, on my counter).  Also, pancetta is amazing in this recipe!  One tip for those who have had problems with curdling or the egg/cream mixture getting weird when mixed in: keep the heat fairly low when reducing the sauce, just a simmer. After adding that to the pasta, toss it around a little bit to cool things off. Then, slowly add the egg/cream mixture so that it isn't 'shocked' by the heat. You can add a little of the pasta water to thin things out for serving, if needed. I also added some chopped parsley to the final product, just to brighten it up a bit.

My family loved it, though I made a few changes.  I fried up the bacon, removed it to cool, drained some of the bacon fat, and then cooked the shallots (only 3), onion, and garlic in the bacon grease.  I also used 1 cup of heavy cream, 1.5 cups of shredded Parmesan cheese, and four egg yolks.  At my husband's request, 1lb of white mushrooms sauteed in butter and white wine and 1 cup of cooked peas were mixed in at the end.

I made this last night using diced ham, one shallot, olive oil, minced garlic, no onion, 3 eggs, milk instead of cream, lots of fresh parmesan, pepper and parsley, some nutmeg, which gave it a complexity, and some butter at the end for added richness.  It was restaurant quality, looked wonderful on a platter, tasted great. Will make again .

Wonderful, quick and easy! I omitted the olive oil and shallots, used 3 cloves of garlic, whole eggs instead of just yolks and half and half instead of cream. I added the cooked pasta to the pan I was cooking the bacon and onion mixture in, and stirred it around for a minute to make sure it was nice and hot. Then I poured the half and half mixture (I used extra) over the hot noodles and stirred around until it was hot and thickened. I just didn't like the idea of eatting the raw egg. Tastes great, and is even good at room temperature. Thanks for such a great recipe with simple ingredients, that I almost always have on hand!

This was awesome! Tired and relaxing at home on a weekend...makes perfect comfort food. I would use a little less onion, more cream and remember to save your pasta water to make for a better sauce.

Easy recipe, great pasta, just like in Italy, not flooded by sauce. Great with a salad. Add lots of blackpepper. Go easy on the salt you may have very salty bacon.

This is a tasty dish! I did saute 2 chichen breasts (Cut into bite sizes) to the bacon for more meat. All I had was maple flavored bacon but it gave it even more flavor. And I left out the egg but it was delightful! Thank you for the recipe!

So simple, so good. My bf wanted me to use angel hair (which I HATE)... and I definitely think sauce would be better on other kinds of pasta - but the point is that sauce was really good. I was worried that using milk instead of cream would affect the sauce since I didnt have any, so I added an extra egg and reduced the milk amount instead. Realized after wards that I wasn't supposed to use whole eggs, so the recipe is forgiving =) Thanks a lot, made a great dinner.

This recipes just wasn't my cup of tea. It was easy to put together but it was kind of blah & bland. I followed the recipe exactely & wouldn't make again that way. I'd definitely have to spice it up a bit.

What can I say this was the BEST pasta dish that I have ever made. I changed the recipe a little bit as I did not have all the ingredients and based on the reviews. 
I cooked 4 strips of bacon drained most of the fat and then sauteed the garlic then added some  2 min.  steamed broccoli and the bacon strips. I used 4 egg yolks, 3/4c. heavy whipping cream and 1c. grated parmesan cheese. My dog is a strick meat eater and begged for a taste of the sauce; gave her two noddles and she brake danced all over the floor. This is a KEEPER, Thanks!

Ten years ago today, I met my husband while backpacking in Florence, Italy and we ate Fettuccini Carbonara at a trattoria.  I made this recipe for him tonight to celebrate that magical evening, and it was absolutely perfect.  Yes, like others said, it would be quicker to cook the bacon separately, but simmering the bacon at medium heat with the olive oil, shallots, onions, and garlic created an amazing flavor combination. The shallots got a bit crispy and I was afraid they were burned, but really they just got this great sweet flavor.  I probably used a cup of cream instead of half a cup, and I threw farm-fresh asparagus into the pasta water for the last 3 minutes.  Never to be forgotten....just like the night we met!

Wow!  AWESOME recipe!  I made a few small changes as well - did 1 cup cream (could have used more since I did a full pound of pasta, and it wasn't as liquid as I would have liked, or just use less pasta next time!).  I also added peas because that's the way I've always had it eating out.  I fried the bacon first, super crispy, then used some of the drippings for the onion and garlic (didn't have shallots).  I moved the onion, garlic and bacon to a bowl and then made some very thin, pounded chicken breasts in the same skillet.  Served the chicken on top and it was a HIT!  Am adding this to my forever recipe book and will make as often as the urge hits me!

Great recipe!  I replaced the bacon with pancetta & reduced the number of shallots to 3.  Next time i will use 3 shallots again & cut out the additional onion.

This was very tasty!!! I made this for my husband for Valentines Day and he really enjoyed it.
I doubled the Cream mixture because it just didn't look like there would be enough for 16oz pasta. It was perfect.
I didn't have shallots so just bacon, onion, and extra garlic.
This was the first time I'd ever made Fettuccine Carbonara and I'm very happy with the way this turned out, plus hubby loved it. Unfortunately, it has to be a dinner for special occasions only because of all the calories and carbs. I think I gained 20lbs eating this tonight! Well worth it!!!!
Yum!

This is impress the hell out of your friends kinda stuff.  Wow.  I got worried when the onions turned to mush, but I guess that's what they were supposed to do.  Yummy!!  Thick, rich, delicious...can't ask for anything more!

We had this tonight and DH thought it was terrific - and that's good enough for me! (I loved it, too.)  I made some changes but I think it would stand on it's own without my changes (except that the Pancetta is a must).  Here's what I did.  I cut the recipe in half except for the egg/cream/cheese - I don't like dry pasta so more sauce is better as far as we're concerned.  I used pancetta - about 4 oz. instead of bacon - not as greasy and much more authentic to a real Carbonara.  I chopped the pancetta into small pieces and sauted with the onion, shallots and I added about 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms, too.  Used lots of garlic - about 1 T. minced - everything tastes better with garlic!  Cooked pasta and just before it was done, I added about 1 C. frozen peas - drained it all together then put the pasta and peas back into the pot.  Dumped on the pancetta/veggie mixture then folded in the egg/cream/cheese mix.  The key is to do it all quick, while the pasta and pancetta/veggies are all hot.  I'll be making this again - a great recipe for company.

This wasn't all I had hoped and dreamed.  The sauce gelled up with the eggs, and wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.  It could be good though with a little modifications.  I think I will try it again sometime, just a little different.

what a great recipe!  

The first time I made this recipe, I followed it to the T.  But just like every recipe, they need to be adjusted slightly...

So...I omit the shallots completely and sautee the onion and bacon, and lastly add the garlic.  I also add in green onions and subsitute 1/2 cream for milk.  Oh, I also put in 2 eggs - whole.

It's a great recipe that I've made for friends over and over!

Bon apetite!

This was not as good as I thought it would be. The onions and shallots burned, even though I followed the recipe to the T. There was to much bacon and not creamy enough for a real carbonra.I don't think I will make this again.

After trying the Carbonara II recipe on this site and being dissatisfied with it, I looked for other recipes to try to save it and I went to this.  It made it taste somewhat better, but it was almost just the same, just with "milk".

Really good....Didn't have any Heavy Cream so I melted 2 tablespoons of Butter and added Milk to obtain the desired H.C measurements...Also didn't have any Fettuccine so I sub with Linguini seeing as how pasta is pasta :-) ...Browned Bacon 1st by itself then added to the onions & shallots....Used the Egg Whites mixed with Cornstarch as a coating for my Chicken Breast....It gives Chicken a nice crust...Make sure it is a little stiff and not watery....Will make again....

My 40-something son came over for a birthday dinner. I thought he would want a grilled steak or prime rib but instead he said..make me the Gold Coast Spaghetti you gave me as a kid.It was my favorite special dinner. This recipe is similar. I must have cut it out of the Chicago Tribune 30 years ago. I use spaghetti. The bacon is fried...and then onion is sauteed in the bacon fat. I use 1/4c dry white wine and cook the onion until the wine is evaporated(he says I used wine even when he was small..what was I thinking?)Can't remember using cream, but 3 eggs and plenty of grated cheese.Combined altogether. As usual he loved it!

This would have been a five star if I'd read the reviews first and browned and drained the bacon before adding the onions and shallots.  The bacon didn't crisp up and the onions caramalized right to the pot.  That said, it tasted great.

I had to adapt this slightly since I didn't have shallots or cream. I had already cooked bacon from a couple days ago and i'm glad because it would have been too oily with all the bacon grease, if I cooked this the same day I would only reserve a tablespoon or two of the grease for good flavor. I also added a little garlic, can't make Italian without it. :-)

I also changed how I used the eggs, I used whole eggs and cooked them sunny-side-up for just two minutes maybe in the saute pan, then added the pasta, milk, and park to the sauce pan and mixed all together, breaking the yolks and mixing thoroughly.

For those who had problems with sauce consistancy, I recommend using a real parmesan, the harder the better. Your deli section of the grocery store usually has employees who could recommend. But this sauce is not supposed to be creamy like Alfredo, I reccomend using Greg's Alfredo recipe on here if that's what you want.

I love this pasta. I keep coming back to it. I'm sure it's tough on the waistline, but it is so rich and delicious. Great comfort food, and delicious enough for guests. It's a nice change from other pasta recipes. I make it exactly as written with amazing bacon from the butcher.

A great hearty pasta dish. I changed the serving size to 3 and it fed my husband, son, and me. Changed a few things in the recipe I added a whole clove of garlic and used normal whipping cream rather than heavy whipping cream. I also garnished with chopped tomatoes and red pepper flakes.

We thought this was a fantastic dish. Like other reviewers, we only used 1/2 pound bacon, 3 cloves garlic, 1 cup of peas, 1 cup cream, and 1 1/2 cups Parmesan. We also fried everything in the bacon grease and omitted the oil. For some reason, our parmesan didn't melt, so we had to microwave it after it was done. Next time, we will leave the mixture on the hot (but off) burner while the fettucini is cooking to make sure everything melts together. We may also add chicken or shrimp to make it heartier. Great recipe!

Top notch fundamental carbonara recipe. I made it just as laid out by the author and it's terrific.  It is easy to see that by adding a single new ingredient as a theme, you can vary this tremendously. I will try adding, one at a time: fresh red pepper strips, large mushrooms, large shrimp, large scallops.

oh, this was goood!  I made a few changes like using  half-and-half because I didn't have heavy cream and I added sauteed mushrooms and I doubled the sauce-----but here's what I found interesting: I doubled the sauce but didn't have enough Parm. to double so I used a grated Mexican cotija cheese instead and the dish still tasted fabulous!  I didn't double the egg yolks and it was still nice and rich.

I make this as is and have made it time and time again.  The reason you don't have to cook the eggs is that the eggs cook and stick onto the hot noodles so there is no need to worry about using raw eggs.

This is a traditional style Carbonara.  Tastes delicious.  My family prefers more sauce, so next time I will add more cream to give the consistancy preferred.

Delicious.  My 20 month old daughter, who usually stubbornly insists on trying to feed herself with a spoon (she's just not coordinated enough yet),loved this so much that she threw down the spoon and started shoveling it in with her hands as fast as she could go!

This was delicious and so easy to make. I subsituted cream with coconut cream and it added a really lovely nutty flavour. I am looking forward to making it again and adding some more vegetables. Must try.

Absolutely fabulous! And the recipe lends itself to tweaking. For instance adding a little less cream, or more cheese, or using ham instead of bacon. Always turns out great!

This is so delicious! I make this all the time.. I add pees and 1 cup of parmesan  since my husband and I love cheese. Sometimes I omit the shallots since I don't always have it on hand.. But yummm I love this and so does anyone who eats this..

This was awesome.... just like the restaurants!  I made a few edits however.  I used only a 1/2 of an onion and used 4 large garlic cloves. I used thick smoked bacon and added peas at the end of the cooking.  I added 1 cup of cream and the parm at the end of the cooking time and kept on low to warm.  I didn't add eggs at all. This was so yummy!  I also made my own fresh fettucini.... a must!

Had never made Carbonara before, and this was really good. I used about 7 pieces of leftover bacon from breakfast and added chicken (thin strips and cooked separately) to make up the difference. I also heated everything up together in the skillet just before serving as another reviewer suggested, and it was delicious. Even the kids liked it!

I hate to do it because I so do not like being critical of others creativity but this recipe was very bland to me and my family.  Also, the sauce was a bit too gritty.  I think that it might have been better to use fresh grated parmesan instead of shredded.  It became a little clumpy as we ate it.

maybe it was something I did, but this creation did not turn out well, the sauce did not come together, I even tried heating it up on the stove to allow the cheese to melt in, but it just didn't absorb  into the pasta, it became more of a separate entity w/in the dish. I did add chicken & mushrooms, it was tolerable to eat, my BF who had been working in the yard for 6 hrs straight came in & gobbled it down, however, he was starving. I may give this a go again at some point.....

It was o.k., I don't know about just mixing the sauce and throwing it on the noodles b/c then it tastes all grainy from the Parmesan. I think next time I'll try to slowly heat the sauce just enough to melt the cheese before pouring it on top.

Soooo Good!!!  Add less fetuccine and it will be more saucy.  I used only sweet onion and garlic with the bacon and it was amazing.

oh my god this was TO DIE FOR! Here is what i did: used 200 grams pancetta, I would use 100 more grams next time, but a pound seems like too much. I used 3/4 cup heavy cream, 1/4 cup skim milk, 1 cup parmesan cheese and 4 egg yolks for the sauce.. it was very creamy and not dry at all that way. .my family loved it.. I didnt have shallots so i used half of a large onion and 2 green onions.. and omitted the garlic .. wow, great recipe! this is my new favorite pasta dish :D

Excellent, but a heart breaker.  This recipe called for an entire package of bacon.  Are you kidding?  Now I LOVE bacon, but this could give you a serious heart attack just thinking about it.  I did it according to the directions the first time and it was very tasty even though I forgot the garlic.  (And why add oil when you're going to saute the onions in the bacon grease anyway?)  NEXT time, however, I plan on microwaving the bacon on paper towels to get the stuff cooked faster (it took forever to saute) and get the fat crispy without loading the dish with bacon grease.  I will save a strip or two to saute the onion.  I might even cut back on the quantity of bacon.  But otherwise it is really good.  I didn't give it 5 stars just because it's a total artery clogger.

I forgot to read the other reviews that mention to make the bacon separately, so all the onion, bacon and shallots burned and made the sauce unedible.  Sorry, I didn't like this.

I cook the bacon flat on cookies sheets in the oven and saute a large chopped onion in a frying pan. I add a cup of heavy cream to the onion pan after I pull it off flame. I beat three whole eggs which I toss with the cooked pasta first by itself. Delicious!

Fabulous!  I have only had carbonara once in a restaurant, and have never been able to get close to the taste. This was perfect.  The only things is I needed more sauce, because I had throat surgery, and I have to have wet everything to get it to go down..2 thumbs up.

This recipes is absolutely fabulous! It's also fairly easy (just prep everything before you start cooking).  Also, try the sauce without the bacon.  It makes a fabulous alfredo sauce.

I made this completely by the recipe for Valentine's Day (my wife loves carbonara).  It was fantastic!  Very rich and tasty.  The only thing I can say is just be sure your pasts is done (I've had trouble timing my ribbon pastas as perfectly as spaghetti).

This recipes is absolutely fabulous! It's also fairly easy (just prep everything before you start cooking).  Also, try the sauce without the bacon.  It makes a fabulous alfredo sauce.

I made this type of sauce for the very first time after having had it "out".  I was very disappointed.  By the time the bacon got evenly browned the shallot was burned which added a horrible flavor to the overall finished dish.  The extra grease from the combination of the olive oil and bacon made a very heavy feeling on the stomach after only a couple of mouthfuls.  If I made this again I would not use the olive oil and I would render the fat off the bacon first.  Remove the bacon and then saute the shallot, onion and garlic.  I would use 2 eggs, complete with whites or egg substitute to try to keep this heavy dish "light" and I would use 2% milk or evaporated skim milk.  I was overall very disappointed in the results.

Have tried several carbonara recipes and must admit this was by far the best.  I also as mentioned in several reviews reduced the oil by cutting the olive oil by one tablespoon and replacing 1/2 of the bacon with small cubed proscuitto.  I added peas and 1/4 cup mozzarella.  It was fantastic!

This is an amazing side or main dish, I didn't have any shallots or heavy cream so I omitted the shallots and subsituted the heavy cream with about a quarter cup of cream cheese... Totally yummy!!

Did not like the way the pasta completely clumped together.  The sauce was not light and creamy.  Family liked the flavor but not so much the dry texture.  Was (almost) a nice side for some grilled steak in place of a plain old baked potato.

APPEARANCE: 5/5
AROMA: 5/5
SAUCE: 5/5
BLEND: 3/5
OVER-ALL TASTE: 4/5

I made this on the night of December 31, 2012 and asked the opinion of the ones who tasted, and they liked it. What i didn't like about it is the sandy/course feeling in the mouth due to the grated Parmesan cheese and a dry feeling in the mouth, i should have doubled the sauce to increase the creaminess and avoid the outcome to be dry. Well, I just started cooking and this one is a keeper ^_^ and by the way, the taste is soooo great! Don't forget to add salt and pepper in the preference of your taste!

                                                              N.J.D.R

I really thought this would be gobbled up by my pasta loving kids.  What's not to love...pasta, bacon, cheese, cream.  It's worth another run past the family, but if not received better next time, it won't make it into the menu rotation.

I loved this recipe but unfortunately I had to take off a star for the kid rating. My kids really didn't like it I don't know why. I did in fact reduce the bacon to half a pound and it was still really good.

I used half the amount of bacon and made the bacon a few days ahead.  Then I quickly sauteed the shallots then added the chopped bacon to reheat along with the peas.  Didn't use onion. Otherwise followed the recipe and it was fabulous.  Kids at pasta feed loved this.

I made this with mozzarella instead of parmesan and doubled the amount of cheese listed it was lovely. my only regret is that i didnt put more cheese in to make the sauce thicker.

VERY GOOD! But I did feel quite guilty after eating this awesome dish. The taste was wonderful, but the pound of bacon seemed like a lot. I believe the only thing I substituted was I used onion in place of shallots. Shallots just aren't available where I live. Will definitely make again :) One of my new favorites.

This was rich and lovely--my husband and son loved it.   But I modified it a bit due to ingredients on hand:  no shallots, 4 eggs in place of egg yolks, 1% milk in place of heavy cream and sauted the onions in bacon grease--then drained most of it, but added some melted butter at the end.   I've also made it with ham instead of bacon which was good, but not quite as wonderful.

Awesome recipe.  I didn't have any bacon on hand, but I did have smoked prosciutto and leftover bacon grease (I save it and keep in the freezer).  Garnished with fresh chopped tomatoes and parsley.  Yum!

This has been my go to Carbonara recipe for years. The only thing I do different is I only use shallots no onions and I mince them small so they melt into the browned bacon. I like to use big fancy rigatoni for this recipe it really wows guests.

Very good recipe.  I used milk in place of cream as we didn't have it in hand - the result was still very rich and creamy.  Next time I  will cook the bacon separately, I had to drain a lot of fat from the bacon/onion mix even though I just used half the amount of bacon.  Best eaten hot.  I will definitely definitely make this again.

This was a good change in flavor. Tastes a lot like fettuccine Alfredo. Next time I want to caramelize the shallots. Me and my husband truly enjoyed this.

I made this recipe with what we had on hand, and it turned out delicious.  I cooked it in a big stainless steel electric wok- which allowed me to easily toss everything together!  First I used olive oil spray and omitted the shallots, but snipped 4 slices of bacon and fried it in the wok, adding 1 minced onion and 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I also added the chopped leafy green portion of 1 bunch of bok choy.  For pasta I used Barilla Plus Rotille (in the yellow box) and I cooked frozen soybeans with the pasta.  After draining the pasta and adding it to the wok, I tossed in shredded Asiago cheese and finely chopped walnuts, and 4 whole eggs, tossing to mix everything together-- and served this with pan sauteed boneless chicken breasts.  The flavor was amazing, my husband raved and even my toddler ate 2 plates full!!  I used low-sodium bacon, and the flavor was incredible.  I  omitted the cream- the texture and sauce was just right without it, and milk would have been to runny (which was all we had.)

I thought this was pretty tasty and simple to make.  Next time, I think I will allow the eggs & cream to sit out and warm just a little while cooking the other ingredients.  The sauce was a little too cold for my liking.

OMG this was sooooo yummy! I loved it! To make things easier on myself I used my chopper on the onion, shallots and garlic and cubbed the bacon. I cooked them all together at the same time. (and it turned out great) This saved a couple steps and cut the prep time. Oh, and I only used 2 shallots because that is all I had. Would also be great with chicken and peas as one review stated.

This was really good.  I used less oil and turkey bacon.  I didn't have shallots, so I left that out.  I doubled the sauce and I'm really glad I did because it wouldn't have been enough had I just made it as written, it was almost not enough sauce doubled.  I will make this again.

This is delicious! This is a rich, restaurant quality meal with a fairly small amount of effort involved. I combined many reviewers' suggestions and adapted the recipe as follows: I omitted the oil (instead use the grease from 1-2 strips bacon; microwave the rest to cut the fat), omitted the shallots, doubled the garlic, used 1 c. half and half instead of cream, and added 1.5 cups peas to add more flavor and nutrition.

I was concerned about how the raw egg would taste but after the pasta sat for a few minutes it was great! I added shrimp and used green onion in place of the other onions. My husband loved this dish... thanks!

Mmmmm, really good! I mixed the cream, eggs and cheese together before pouring on as mentioned and it was SO creamy! I loved it and so did my boyfriend. VERY filling too. I get home from work late and I need to find meals I can make in a hurry so we don't have to eat at 8:00, and this was so quick. I loved it!

delicious! this is practically the closest thing to restaurant-quality carbonara that I've tried.  I added peas for color and extra nutrition.  Also, the sauce is pretty thick, so I added a splash of skim milk to thin it out.  Shallots are what make this recipe so great- don't substitute them! yummy!

Very simple with great results. Had to make do w/o shallots and subst. 2% for cream. Topped w/ pesto chix breast for tasty, colorful & quick supper with a beautiful aroma (bacon, onion, garlic) which filled the house.

GOODNESS GRACIOUS-- this was awesome! I was such a bad girl though- I used the bacon grease insted of the olive oil!( no not all of it- I cut the recipe to 1/3 )-- It was excellent! (next time I will follow the recipe-) It tasted just like what I had in an Itlalian restaurant once. They did not use onion though. It was worth every calorie.!!

I did not enjoy eating this dish.  I took other's advice and cooked the bacon seperately. I definitely think that is a better way of preparing it. I just did not feel that the dish had the flavor that I was hoping for.

Outstanding Dish and easy to make.  The only change I made was that I used one and half cans of evaporative milk since I did not have any heavy cream.  This is a recipe I well definitely make again and again!

I have never had this before but my husband loves it. This was so easy and so good! I will definately use this again and again! After reading many reviews I did cook the bacon separately and I also used half and half instead of the heavy cream. I skipped the onion and just used the green onions. It was fantastic!! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is probably not the most healthy dish to serve, but it tastes so darn good, that I can't help but be in love with it. Someone else recommended to take the bacon and onion out of the pan before you continue with everything and I agree. Thanks. I love to make this now.

Another winner!  I used extra garlic & less onion, but the really important part is to have everything ready to serve before mixing the sauce with the pasta.  If you serve right away it's creamy & perfect.  If it stands it thickens, but is still tasty

I had fresh fettuccini pasta and I also added peas and tomatoes just so I could get some veggies into my diet. I used Fat free half and half and tossed in some cut up salami. I've made this w/o the changes too and it is still good. Thank you for sharing!

After trying this a few times, I find it works best to cook the bacon first until it's just starting to brown, then add shallots and garlic (skip the onion).  That way the shallots and garlic don't burn while you wait for the bacon to brown.  Also, I drain the noodles (make sure you've started them early enough so they're ready by the time the sauce is) and add the egg mixture, then spoon into bowls and add a bit of the bacon/shallot mixture on top.  Trying to mix the bacon in doesn't work very well.  It's hard to get an equal amount of bacon in each serving.  I still highly recommend this recipe!!  My 10 year old begs me to make it!

This easy a very simple and delectable dish. We added shrimp to it as well as tried to double it. It turned out delicious buy was a tad bit rich. If you do double it, don't double the cheese or cream. Determine your portions and rate it from there. We will make this again. Very good, very simple. If we had just followed it as said, it would have been perfect.

Granted I changed the pasta to whatever I had in the cabinet that would hang on to the sauce- I also added mushrooms & asparagus... Absolutely wonderful & easy!  This is my second main entree meal that I've attempted - easy, looking like a chef, & I'm rocking it!!

Tried this yesterday and instead of bacon i replaced it with boneless chicken and cut them into pieces. Instead of only using egg yolk, i used the whole egg and only used 2 instead of 3. Lastly i top it with some broccoli and a sprinkle of some dried parsley. It was delicious.

Trying not to be critical. First off, WAAAYYY too much pasta and bacon for the amount of sauce. Second to many egg yokes for this small amount of sauce. We also don't like bacon in the house, so I substituted for 1/2lb ham (fat trimmed off). Doubled up on the cream to 1 cup, doubled up on freshly grated Parmesan to 1 and a 1/2 cup, and 3 cloves of garlic. Then when everything is combined and mixed, heat up on the stove very low heat in heavy bottom pot to melt the cheese for a few minutes, add a little milk if too thick to your liking. Turned out perfect that way.

I'm making this tonight for supper and I can't wait.  I plan to serve it with a tomato/bocconcini entree and garlic bread.  I have left the eggs and cream on the kitchen counter so that it can be used at room temperature and to avoid the pasta being cold as per other reviewers.  I am going to only put green onions in and not any other onion as I think that would be overpowering.  I'm looking forward to supper. :-) October 22nd, 2014 and I am making this again.  This time I think I'll add mushroom when the bacon is cooking and might try with the onion.  I'm sure it'll be delish!

I did not like this at all. I was highly anticipating this to be really great but it wasn't. I found it to be incredibly bland. I would recommend adding shrimp and perhaps cayenne pepper.

My husband wanted to try this. It was a little too rich for my personal taste.  I remember thinking that I would never put that much bacon into something but I wanted to make it per the recipe. I should have listened to my gut (no pun intended) because it made me physically sick (bad acid reflux because I was very pregnant). I still give it 4 stars because my husband really liked it and it turned out exactly like it was supposed to. It is one of the truest to traditional carbonara recipes I could find... it was my own fault for eating rich, creamy, greasy comfort foods while pregnant.

Made exactly how recipe called but skipped shallots, did not have any. My husband and son thought it was okay. I felt it was missing flavor. And I should've cut bacon smaller. Also made extra sauce but this time used onion powder, garlic powder, instead of the actual produce and found that the flavors were alot better. Will make again but will use powders to make sure onion and garlic flavors stand out.

Very good traditional carbonara. A little heavy on the onion/shallot, and a little light on the bacon, but overall very tasty.

I would make this again - one of my favorite meals. Very flavorful. Everyone loved it. I was tempted to not use all the bacon because it seemed like so much but I was glad I did. It added a ton of flavor. I did not use shallots, just the onion. Bacon should be cooked on low heat so it will take awhile and the onions should not be crispy like other reviewers commented. My guess is their heat was too high for the bacon. Also I used all the grease from the bacon in the pasta and the dish was not too greasy. The bacon fat gives flavor! Eat immediately. The longer it sits the more the consistency of the sauce changes.

Very good.  I let the bacon crisp before adding shallots and garlic (drained the bacon fat).  I skipped the onions and added some green peas.  The sauce was a little too "eggy" for my taste, but my husband loved it, so it will go into the rotation.  Great way to use up leftover half-n-half.

This was a great weeknight dinner. I didn't have any shallots, but I beefed up the recipe a little with some chopped up marinated artichoke hearts and a can of mushrooms added to the bacon when I added the garlic. I also added about 1/4 c. of white wine at the same time. I didn't have any cream so I used milk instead, which was good. Next time I will double the cream sauce part of the recipe and cook the bacon sans onions to begin with in order to let it get a little bit crispier.

Really great.  I was looking for a last minute dinner idea so i used the ingredient search and wa la.  I would definately double the sauce as everyone else has said.  Used lots of s&p and extra parm right before serving.  great week night dinner

Made this with the addition of italian sausage and was wonderful. I had to make double the carbonara sauce but I made an entire 1 lb. of noodles, bacon, and italian sausage. Made for 2 we had leftovers for 4 days!

So yummy! I cooked the bacon first without the olive oil and onion.  Halfway through cooking the bacon, I poured off most of the bacon grease and added the shallots and garlic.  An interesting twist is to add red pepper flakes for a bit of heat.

This is my favorite in a pinch meal of all time!  I always have bacon in the freezer, and I use half & half that I always have on hand for my coffee in place of the heavy cream.  I found frozen chopped shallots in the freezer section, plus I always add an extra clove of garlic in with the onion and a pinch of nutmeg with the egg yolks.

Very good recipe. I used linguini instead of fettuccini, and following others' suggestions, used half a pound of pasta instead of a full pound. Used 2 shallots, no onion, half in half instead of heavy cream, half a pound of bacon, one egg. I cooked the bacon first, then cooked the shallots and garlic in some of the leftover bacon grease (poured most of the grease out). My ten year old didn't really like it, especially the shallots, but I think my older daughter will like it.

What a great lunch?! Too bad I didn't have fettuccini, had to use orzo. I sprinkled more parmesan on top. Nice recipe.

Very good. To make it more saucy I doubled the cream. I also added garlic, shallots and added a moderate amount of black pepper.   Substituted prosciutto for the bacon, added in some leftover roast chicken for more meat.

Followed this recipe and it turned out perfect.  I did use turkey bacon instead of regular bacon and the kids loved it.  When they ask for it again you know its a winner!

This was OK. Frankly, I did not find it all that flavorful and definitely not worth the fat and calories. I won't be making again.  Thanks for sharing!!

A lovely taste, but the recipe calls for far too much pasta vs. sauce. I highly recommend either of the following options: a) use less pasta, or b) make double the sauce!

Easy to make.  I diced everything before hand and cooked the bacon previously so when I got home from work it went even faster.  I can't wait to try it with proscuitta and maybe even peas.  Did it this first time exactly how the recipe is...great!!!  My 3 year old and 6 year old ate an entire plate!!

Pretty good for my first try at it. It was a little heavy, so I may try half and half next time. Also, I need tyo find a way to keep it hot. My hubby sugested heating up the actual plate to help keep the pasta warm, becasue It is not nearly as tasty when it cools down.

This recipe is very good! I made a few changes to suit my taste. I halved the original recipe cos I was only cooking for 2. I also omitted shallots but used 1 large onion instead. I added 300g fresh mushrooms cos we love mushrooms. The end result was very very good. My husband loved it! :) Thanks!

I cut the fat & calories big time--mainly because of the ingredients I had on hand.  It was still sooooo good!  I only used 1 T olive oil, 1% milk instead of heavy cream, 1/2 lb of bacon instead of a whole pound, & 2 egg yolks instead of 3 (because raw eggs are icky!) 

I also added some grilled chicken, basil & oregano.  

This is a GREAT recipe & I'll make it as written as soon as I have all of the ingredients.  We all loved it!

Wow!! Amazing recipe. I needed a snack and had pasta only enough for 1, so I approximated the quantities for 1. I used too much milk, but that is my mistake and other than for that, it was the best. I did use 2 cloves for garlic (we Indians are very fond of garlic) and we were out of shallots, so omitted that. I also spiced it up a little by adding a sprinkling of chilli flakes. And I used milk instead of cream, and an whole egg. It was yummy :)

Edit : I make this atleast once every week. It is extremely delicious and easy to make..

Absolutely excellent!  It sure does make a TON though.  Thankfully I made it for guests last night so we don't have massive leftovers!  I did cook my bacon separately.  I added 2 more cloves of garilc, mushrooms, peas, and grilled chicken and I used whole wheat linguini.  I cannot say enough about how fantastic it was!

I had REALLY high hopes for this dish. But it was just SO bland!!! I did this to a T and just felt like I was eating the equivalent of a plain bowl of pasta.  Not one I would use again or recommend. My hubby had maybe two bites.

This recipe was delicious. Even my extremely picky boyfriend loved it, and has since requested it for dinner. I have made this recipe a few times and I have altered it to my liking. I use pancetta instead of bacon, half & half instead of cream. I have also added mushrooms and peas. Just watch the salt with the addition of the pancetta

very good. best carbonara I've made so far. sauce was light, tasty and not too heavy. I used 4 cloves of garlic, half n half instead of cream and ham instead of bacon. I also added some basil at the end. Make sure to let your pasta cool a bit before adding the cream/cheese/egg mixture or the sauce may get too heavy. Make sure to season well with S+P as it is a lot of pasta.

Definitely did not live up to the ratings that drew me to it in the first place.  Unfortunately, I didn't read all the reviews - and I agree with those that note to cook the bacon first.  It took so long to cook the bacon with the onion and shallots that by the time the bacon was done, the onion had no flavor left.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out with very little flavor for the amount of work, and we both ended up with stomach aches after all was said and done.  For all that went into it, seemed like something was missing.  If I was to cook it again, I would do the bacon first, then add the onions, shallots and garlic.

My family loved the dish.  I made slight changes:  used 1 c. half & half instead of cream, cooked bacon separately, and sauted shallots and onions in a little bit of the bacon grease.  I also served cooked peas and sauted chicken breast strips on the side.  Most in my family added the chicken to the pasta and liked the flavor.  I thought the sauce was a little dry but overall we liked it very much.

Sorry, but I was not impressed with this recipe.  I followed the instructions exactly, so I don't think I made any mistakes.  It tasted like flavorless pasta.
I won't make this again.

This was absolutely delicious.  I always knew there was something missing from mine and it is the eggs.  Makes it very rich, thick and creamy.

My boyfriend is a trooper and will eat anything I cook for him.  This carbonara disappeared!  He not only inhaled it for dinner but ate it for lunch and dinner the next two days.  It was super easy to make and obviously was a big hit!

Had high hopes because I love the ingredients.  By cooking the bacon with the shallots neither is able to crisp.  The height of their flavors cannot be reached with this method.  I would try a different recipe but would fry the shallots alone, then fry the bacon alone.  I don't like bacon that looks uncooked and it wouldn't brown.  Flavor was good but not much sauce to speak of.

It turned out awesome.  I used 1 1/2 pounds of bacon and added chicken.  I increased the egg yolks to four and increased the cream to account for the extra meat.  Added extra Parmesan cheese on top.  Added cherry tomatoes for a little acid to cut the heaviness.  Everyone loved it!!

I made the change of using seasoned chicken rib meat, cooked shrimp and I substituted tofu shirataki fettuccini for authentic fettuccini pasta.

Made recipe as is, definitely wasn't bad, it had a good flavor for sure. Next time though I am going to try 1 cup of heavy cream instead of 1/2 cup, it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked, it was a little thick and hard to stir.

I knew this recipe appeared to be exceptional when I first read it but, as a personal chef to the stars, I have to modify everything. So here’s what I did. I doubled the sauce mixture. 6 yolks, a cup of heavy cream and a cup and a half of fresh Parmesan Cheese. Next, I cut the bacon back from 1 pound down to 3/4 of a pound but also added four slices of black forest ham and four slices sandwich turkey.Additionally, I added a bag of frozen pea and 1 cup of the pasta water.This made it mine and I’m now adding it to my new cook book!!  Amazing!!

I made it with 3/4 cup cream instead of the 1/2 cup., and substituted green onions for shallots (as I didn't have any shallots on hand). 
Easy and fast to make. Very delicious.

I slightly modified this recipe where I did not use the eggs and  added roughly 3 tablespoons of butter along with some fresh  basil where end result was a very flavorful dish.

I followed comments using 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and I used 2 cups Parmesan.  I love cheese! I didn’t have shallots but onion was enough. I also used garlic to our taste.  The family loved it and we’ll be having this again! Yummy

Wasn’t sure about this seemed like a lot of onions. I didn’t follow the recipe exactly. I doubled the “sauce” part and added peas and it was awesome. Definitely a keeper.

I made this according to the recipe. The consistency was spot on. The second time I made it I used pancetta instead of standard bacon. It was much more authentic and reminiscent of the carbonara I became used to years ago. I was tempted to subtract a star, but just substitute pancetta for bacon and all is well.

Very good. Carbonara is not Alfredo as some of the other reviewers seemed to want it to be.  Carbonara is very simple and wonderful. This is a good solid recipe. As is so often the case in recipes the execution is important. Using good ingredients and warming the eggs helps the outcome. We had this tonight and it's very good.

Don't change anything!  It the first time around at least because this is delicious. Most certainly gives the one I had at a restaurant a run for their money and it's pretty easy to make. Only down side - do not make this if you are watching your calories.

Awesome recipe. Mushrooms and more garlic. I put cooked peas on side for who ever wanted to mix them in.

It was pretty good, but I feel like the portion suggestion is a bit off. I would suggest serving this to about 4 people, not 6.

I made it but I used 100% lactose while milk instead of heavy cream.  And 4 eggs. After I mixed in the milk and eggs and butter to the frying pan, with the fettuccine, it was kinda like cooking eggs and got eggy a bit. I added chicken, mushrooms, bacon and parsley as well. The outcome was kind of disappointing. Too much egg and not a taste of the cream sauce. It's kind of like eating just plain pasta with chicken, bacon, mushrooms, and parsley. I must of cooked it wrong or something.

It's ok. Add more cream, cheese and one more egg yolk to it and it would get 4 stars.

I make this all the time and my family loves it! The key to this recipe is carmelizing the onions properly and adding the right amounts of salt and pepper. My wife won't let me change a thing on this recipe cause she loves it so much!

Most disgusting dish I've ever made. Ate a few forkfuls and threw it out.  If I were to ever try again, I would cook the bacon first. Then saute the onion/shallots in the bacon grease. Would not add a whole large onion, not 5 tsps of olive oil. Ended up too onioney and too greasy.  Couldn't even taste the cheese...

I will make it again soon. However, I will make sure the bacon is extra crisp since it softens when you add the cream/egg/cheese mixture.

I found it bland and tasteless. Before I stored a lot of leftovers I added more cream, the rest of the parmesan and a bit of white pepper. I had originally cut out the bacon and added broccoli and  sauteed mushrooms.  I had originally had this dish at a wonderful family owned Italian restaurant near Boston. They made it with the vegetables I did and added the bacon I can tell you that the leftovers, heated up were absolutely delicious!!!

This dish was very tasty, but much too greasy from the bacon fat.  I did drain off a good amount of the fat, but I think I would drain it all off next time.  There's plenty of bacon flavor without needing the grease.  I topped it off with some grilled shrimp.  Next time I would add a bunch of veggies: mushrooms, peas, spinach, tomatoes.

We really enjoyed this dish - with a few minor tweaks. Carbonara is one of my favorites so I was pleased to find such a simple recipe. Unlike other attempts on my part, the eggs were really easy to incorporate when added to the cream and grated cheese.

Here are my adjustments: Excluded shallots because I didn't have any. Completely drained the bacon/onion mix before adding to pasta. Wound up using about double the cream to keep the cheese from becoming stringy. 

Note: For this dish taste its best make sure pasta is al dente and that the bacon gets completely cooked.

We made it with Zoodles instead of noodles. We also put it in a casserole pan, sprinkled with a little bit of bread crumbs and Parmesan and baked it for about 1/2 hour after mixing it all up.

Quite good, but I had to reduce the fat/calories. I substituted 1 cup half & half for the cream, only used 1/2 packet of bacon ~ cooked it and drained off the fat. Added peas and chicken breast and upped the garlic to 3 cloves as another reviewer recommended.

Before you cook this, stop and read the review by 072705r.  It's one of the top-rated ones and should be easy to find.  The adjustments suggested in that recipe resulted in a truly delicious dish.  The texture was not quite as creamy as I would like (the parmesan makes it just the slightest bit stringy but makes the flavor irresistable) but other than that this is a truly delicious recipe.  When they say "restaurant-quality" they really are not exaggerating.  I will certainly be making this again.

This was a comfort meal like no other! Very rich and filling.

 I used pancetta instead of bacon since it's well Italian and I like the taste better for this particular meal. I reserved pasta water since this dish can dry out very easily when you add the parmesan cheese when it sits for a few minutes. I like the cream sauce a little looser. The thick pasta absorbs the liquid quickly. 

Waiting for the next day of indulgence to make this again! 

Get the warm italian bread ready for this meal!

Very tasty recipe!  I adjusted the ingredients for 3 servings so the heavy cream measure was reduced to 1/4 cup.  The cream/ egg yolk/ parmigianno mixture disappeared right into the fettuccine.  I would make  more of the sauce next time as I cook for my hubby and I only but we like a wee bit of leftovers for a heated up snack the next day, which is why I adjusted to 3 servings.  The onion/bacon combo is simply delicious so I will make this recipe again but make more of the sauce so it will be creamy...  Easy and yummy recipe; thanks for sharing!

This is not Carbonara, it's fettucine with cream and bacon. There is never ever cream in carbonara which is why you will find this much heavier and oily than the real thing.

This was great, it had a texture Ive never achieved in a pasta sauce before; really silky... in the back of my mind while I ate I thought "are these eggs really cooked?" And it was a thought that decreased my enjoyment of it. But perhaps Im just paranoid cause I feel fine afterwards

Looking at the various photos, I see that many people have not followed the recipe's (somewhat vague) instruction to use bacon "cut into strips." Instead, they've chopped, diced or crumbled the bacon. I've found that when I'm working with long pasta shapes (such as this recipe's fettuccine), it's always best to add other ingredients that have first been cut into similar long, thin shapes, such as by julienning. Such shapes allow the added ingredients to mimic the shape of the pasta, flex & flow with it, cling to it and, effectively, become entrained with it. Short or chunky shapes, on the other hand, just can't behave that way, and will instead tend to fall away from the pasta. (In other recipes that call for chunky pieces of vegetables, use a short pasta shape instead.) So try slicing the long, raw bacon strips into three lengths of approximately equal length. Then cut each of those strips lengthwise (not crosswise) into three fat matchsticks. (And if any of those strips are all or mostly fat, just discard them.) As for the raw egg yolk that's justifiably giving many reviewers pause, I suggest buying pasteurized eggs, if you can find them.

Good food.  Picky children enjoyed it.  I couldn't get heavy cream at the store and substituted directly for Half and Half (without making a roux with butter as advised) and pleased to report it worked out really well.  Not 5 stars as there is not much in here for the health conscious.

It was excellent and the entire family enjoyed it. The only suggestion I would give is to par cook the bacon first so that it will crisp up a little more. 
We will definitely be making it again.

Delicious. I changed the recipe just a tad. Didn't add the onion but did add a can of peas and an extra shallot. I used some really good Parmesan cheese and used spinach chive linguini instead of fettuccine. Excellent.

Very nice - made it as per instructions. Very cheesy and we are cheese freaks so that was good. Next time may add a splash of vermouth or vodka to it to pep it up a bit.

Made this exactly as the recipe called for.  The shallots made it a little sweet, perfect for me, not so much my husband, however, when we peppered, it was wonderful.  Will add some red pepper flakes and half the shallots next time.  I did like combining the cheese, egg yolks and cream before adding them to the noodle mixture, didn't worry about scrambling the eggs.  A couple of thoughts, leave the shallots, onions and bacon to cook down until the bacon browns a bit, this takes some time which allows the flavors to develop.  Make sure to use plenty of salt and pepper to balance the sweetness of the shallots.  Save some of the pasta water so that when the cheese sauce thickens, you can thin it out a bit.  This will become a regular in our meal rotation.

Not the healthiest dish out there  (I added more bacon) but absolutely delicious! Not for every day but coupled with a nice salad it makes a great comfort food dish.

Excellent! Family loved it. Made some shrimp on the side with some of the drippings from the bacon, so I tasted with and without shrimp. Both were good.

Recipe is great as is!  Seems a lot of onion and shallot when prepping, but turned out fantastic!  Bacon and Parm reduce the need for salt when finishing.  We trimmed some of the bacon fat out.  Enjoy!

I added sliced, grilled chicken marinated in olive oil and Frank's red hot sauce, used half and half instead of cream, only used onions and 6 slices of bacon and  9oz of fresh angel hair pasta. It was great!

This is pretty darn good as is hence the 4 star review.  When I make it now for my family I alter it for our tastes.  I use pancetta in lieu of bacon - it does not overpower the flavor of the sauce.   I triple the garlic and then use black pepper encrusted Romano cheese that I grated. The difference between an ok sauce and a great sauce is the ingredients which in this case is the cheese. If you want the wow factor then select good fresh (well in this case aged Romano) ingredients. I also add just a dash of cayenne. Change it up and serve over pan seared zoodles instead of pasta to get more veggies consumed ;).    Remember that packaged grated cheese although perhaps more convenient has added non-caking ingredients and is no comparison to a good fresh but aged Parmesan or Romano!

I did make some changes, I used a whole cup of heavy cream, 4 egg yolks, 1 1/2 cups Parmesan, half a small sweet onion and no shallots, kept the pound of bacon, and added some diced chicken I had leftover and frozen. It was delicious and with more cream and egg was a little bit more saucier than most recipes, which I love. The girlfriend loved it too!

Loved it. I used half the pasta and half the bacon/pancetta but kept everything else the same. I like things saucy. I cooked and drained bacon/pancetta  first. Set aside. I saute the shallots in the same pan with a little butter.  I also reserved 1/2 cup of the pasta water adding it back in with the pasta and bacon. It helps the sauce stick. I will make this again. I served with peas.

Delicious! I had to leave the cheese out, since my son doesn't like cheese. But he loved it! I added the cheese on my plate and I loved it! It was a hit by everyone else, too! The other change I made was to cook the bacon first, then saute the rest in just some of the drippings.

This carbonara was fabulous. I didn't have a shallot so just used onions. I also took the bacon out of the pan and drained the fat. Once the pasta was done, I added that to the pan that had the bacon in it. So lots of good flavor there. I would definitely make this one again.

Yes, I added 1/2 & 1/2 because I needed a thinner sauce.  But, my question is how you keep the dish warm/hot?    I hate luke warm pasta.

Used this as a base but changed a couple of things and it still turned out fab! Used leftover baked ham (smoked), half and half instead of cream, spagetti instead of fettucine, no shallots, onions or garlic, added broccoli instead of peas, a big hit!

Incredible recipe - more than just the sum of its parts. Our whole family loved it. I did make a few changes - extra garlic and shallots, but no onion.  I fried the bacon up first, then drained off most of the grease, and fried the shallot/garlic in that. Used some pasta water to de-glaze the pan, and used about 3/4 c of cream.

Delicious! I had fat free Half & Half, which worked well.  I heated it in a bowl sitting on the water heating for pasta.  When the pasta water was ready, I removed the bowl from over the water and added the pasta to the water.  While that was cooking I tempered the yolks, added the cheese to the FF Half & Half, and stirred in the yolks right as the pasta was cooked.  So simple and delicious.

This is one of my husband's favorite dinners!  I used 1 cup cream, as per reviewers' suggestions, and it was perfect.  I also added 2 chicken breasts, cut in thin strips and cooked with basil and olive oil and added an extra clove of garlic to add a little more flavor.  It turned out fantastic!

Good, but was much too dry for our tastes. I would have prefered doubling the sauce portion.  I also made a few changes based on other reviews. I used half the bacon and added two grilled chickedn breasts (cubed). Used two cloves of garlic. I also added peas, but made the mistake of using canned peas that came out mushy. Bad move. I should have used frozed peas and steamed them before adding them in at the end.  The recipe was good, but really needed more cream.

This was ok but not great, the onion was overpowering. I used 3 eggs instead of 4 egg whites, and also used half a large onion instead of the whole thing. It still was just a bit too "oniony" for my taste. I don't remember carbonara being that oniony at all. Next time I think I'll cut down to 3 shallots and maybe use 1/4 of an onion.

Like the flavor but have issues with the pasta absorbing all of the sauce. Personally not sure how to fix that, will have to try other recipes.

YUMMY, this came out so good.  I made it for my in-laws and everyone loved it.  I def, will be making it a lot more. I also make it with homemade fettuccini pasta, which soaks up all the flavor.

Yum! I substituted for gluten free pasta due to wheat allergy...It was very creamy and rich. Yum! Delicious!

you really have to make sure that you use good bacon.  i found that a little more cream as well, and good quality parmesean really made a difference.  we also sauteed some mushrooms with the bacon and onion mix, very nice.  chopped up a big handful of parsley at the end, and mixed it in.  cleanses the palate, makes it seem not so heavy, but does not take away from the flavour.

addendum: artichoke hearts as well are very good

Absolutely delicious. I made it for my boyfriend (an extremely picky eater) and he ate the whole serving dish himself. I have and will make this again in the future.

Tasted pretty good however I thought it tasted way too like bacon.  I would try another time with less bacon or try another recipe.  Thanks.

This carbonara was excellent! I made it pretty much as is, the only difference being that I added more parmesan cheese (I love that stuff!), a little bit extra bacon and 1 more egg yolk. It was delicious. One of my favorite new recipes. I'll be adding this to my regular recipe box.

This is a great recipe! I love the sauce made out of egg yolks and cream. I substituted smoked salmon for the bacon to make a semi-vegetarian version, and it was delicious. Definitely a keeper.

I used this recipe the very first time I made carbonara.  It was so easy and flavorful.  I made it for my dad who often frequents Italy and he said it was amazing!

I've been searching for the perfect carbonara recipe and I've just found it!  Taste and texture are right on the mark.  I didn't have any shallots, so I used onions and it was still terrific.  This is the recipe that I will always use.

Not worth it. Takes ages to prepare and you don't get anything for your troubles compared to one of those preprepared sauces available at the supermarket. Maybe this is an ok basis for something more.

This seemed very similar to what my mom used to make all the time, but she refused to share the recipe! Much like everyone else, I used 1 cup of cream as the sauce was much too thick. I also used green onions instead of regular onion. Added at the last minute and a little bit as a garnish, looked and tasted fabulous!

LOVE IT! I sautee'd mushrooms with the onions in a touch of bacon fat instead of olive oil, omitted the shallots because I didn't have any and added steamed sweet peas at plating for color and taste. Also added chicken breasts strips browned a bit of the bacon fat. Husband who hates cream sauces LOVED it! Tasted even better the next day when everything had a chance to blend over night! Definately a keeper!

The flavor of this dish is great but the sauce is too thick. Not sure how to make it lighter but it would be much better!

This dish was quick and easy and tasted pretty good.  The family raved about it.  I added chicken which was good.  Could have used a little more flavor and would definitely be better with a smaller pasta.  Like another review said, the bacon and chicken didn't mix well with the fettuccini unless you sprinkle it on top after mixing the pasta with the sauce.  Will probably make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was very creamy and rich, the only downside from it is that I used too much onion. I would recommend using a relatively small onion.
