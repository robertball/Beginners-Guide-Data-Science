The pumpkin flavor wasn't as strong as I had hoped for.

I liked this recipe, we had it with salad and bread for supper.  I had about 6 cups of leftover pumpkin so I used that instead of canned, and because i used extra pumpkin i used 2 cans of coconut milk, I didn't add any salt, otherwise i used the same amount of other ingredients as the recipe called for and it had good flavour.  I'm sure using the recipe as written would be just as good.

I'll admit that I was skeptical of the weird flavor combo, but it works.  I used a homemade chicken broth with no salt at all, and the soup was still way too salty! I'll cut it down to 1 teaspoon salt when I make it again. This is a nice soup when you are in the mood for something different, but I don't think it would be one I'd put in the regular rotation.
