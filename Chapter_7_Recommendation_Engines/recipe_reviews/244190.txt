This was a nice side dish. I had a smaller bag of frozen artichokes in the freezer and added a half a chopped up red pepper and half of a diced onion, I did not add the cayenne pepper.

It went well with a steak dinner, one thing I would do differently next time is add a splash of lemon juice after cooking.
