This was decent, but was missing something.  I'm going to keep searching.

I tasted the sausage mixture before it was baked and it was kind of bland.  After I added some garlic powder and some red pepper flakes, they turned out very good.  I would make them again.  I also used reduced fat Jimmy Dean sausage and it only came in a 12 oz package, not 16.

I made these for my hubby since he loves mushrooms.  I used the hot sausage variety instead.  These turned out very delicious.

Very good, substituted a homemade Cheese and Basil Sausage, taken out of the casing and chopped very fine after cooking and mixed bread crumbs in the mix instead of sprinkling on top.
