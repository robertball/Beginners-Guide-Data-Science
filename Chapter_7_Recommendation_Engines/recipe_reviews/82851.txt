This was very good. I used only one cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream. I  omitted the peppers and used only one celery stalk. We aren't big on pickle relish so I cut that way down, but that is just a personal preference. I used leftover ham. Thank you.

I didn't measure the mayo; just spooned it in until it looked right. I'm not a meat eater, but I really enjoyed this on party pumpernickel. The sweet relish cuts the saltiness of the ham.
