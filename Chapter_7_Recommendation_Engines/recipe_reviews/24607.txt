What an innovative idea! I love the pungency and meatiness of the olives, and the garlic gives this delicious spread a robust punch. If you serve it as suggested, the french bread should balance the saltiness of the olives. I can't wait to use it on pizza in place of basil pesto. Thanks for a great idea, Behr Kleine!

This is a delicious appetizer.  I had it at a Greek restaurant, and then found this recipe.  It tasted like the appetizer at the restaurant, and guests loved it!

This dip was so easy.  I garnished the serving tray with sliced roma tomatoes to add on the bread if desired.  I will make this again and again.  Wonderful with a nice Cabernet.

Omitted the pecans due to a nut allergy, otherwise concluded that we didn't really need them. This was kind of salty and oily,  yet ideal served on mini Melba Toasts as a snack. The toasts just soaked up any run off anyways.

Nice flavors in this, and easy to make too.  It makes a bit more than I expected, but that's okay.  I'm the only one in the house that likes olives, so it's up to me to eat it, but I think I can manage.  I had whole pecans but just pulsed them a bit in the food processor before adding the other ingredients and it was fine.  thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful!  Unfortunately, I only realized after I started that my food processor didn't work so I had to chop everything by hand.  The flavor was delicious though, and I think I liked the more robust texture better in the end anyway.  Served with toast rounds as a thanksgiving appetizer.

VERY SALTY (much too salty).  I used VIGO Greek Olives and maybe that was the culprit.  I would suggest rinsing the olives well and drying them to cut the salt.  I like the idea of this recipe so I may try it with black olives instead.  I agree with the reviewer who commented on the color.  It was pretty yucky.  I garnished it with parsley, which helped.

This is one of my favorite appetizer recipes. everyone who tries this requests the recipe. LOVE it. I add more garlic and serve it on crackers as well. It helps if you have a palate that enjoys a lot of flavor.

Absolutely delicious! The pecans really added some oommph and texture. Next time I might add some fresh parsley.

I liked this a lot! Because the reviews were a bit mixed, I decided to go with black olives. Kalamatas are too pricey to try a new recipe with. Don't understand why they're so expensive; they're olives for corn sakes, not truffles! Anyway, didn't have pecans so I subbed with walnuts. Didn't have any feta either, so I used parm instead. All worked well. As for the saltiness one reviewer commented on; yes, kalamatas are extremely salty and of course the cheese has it's share too. I'd say a good rinse of the olives should help. As for the color some people didn't care for; well, you're right, it's not all that pretty, but a sprinkling of fresh parsley, diced tomatoes and scallions to garnish redirected the eye somewhat. Thanks so much Behr!

Wow!!!  Delicious!  If you have a palate that loves complex foods, try this one.  The only thing I did differently is that I toasted the pecans first.  Loved it.  Not beautiful but I topped it with a sprinkle of feta cheese and a pinch of parsley.  Served it with a light an airy bread that I sliced thin, topped with olive oil and baked until slightly crisp.  Yum!

This was very good stuff. I'd never had anything like it before, let alone made it at home.
The Woman I Love didn't want to try it, so I ate it all by myself in six days. It was enough for two whole loaves of French bread (warmed and sliced, as suggested).
This was the first time I'd ever bought either Calamata olives (as the ones I bought were spelled) or Feta cheese. I had several fetas to choose from, and picked the "crumbled traditional" style. It wasn't mentioned in the recipe, but I assumed the olives were to be drained of the brine they came in. I had larger packages, so I measured out the proper net weights of the pecans and olives.
The whole recipe made quite a bit; I don't have a proper food processor (yet), and it pretty much filled up my 3-cup "Chef's Chopper".
The results were pretty salty, but not too much so. One very minor complaint (echoing several previous reviewers) is that it sure isn't very visually appealing. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Thanks!

I thought this was much too salty and I found the color unappealing.  I served the left-overs on celery to my Atkins Diet Dad and he loved it.  I think the celery cut the saltiness a bit.

The flavors are so intense and addictive:  I made it for a goodie day at work and it was pretty much all I ate the entire day, LOL!!  Delicious recipe, it got raves from all of my co-workers; I'll definitely make it again.

I think this is so addicting. I don't even like olives, but something about the combo of ingredients I cannot get enough of.

I love this tapenade, and have made it several times.  I use one large clove of garlic only- any more than that and I cannot taste anything else!  Cannot imagine what this tastes like with 4 cloves of garlic!  For me, the original is not too salty but has too much garlic.

I really like this stuff, it is unique and very robust with flavor.  I can understand others' comments about the saltiness but you must expect that when using Kalamata olives.  While primarily a dip, I can see it being used as a sandwich spread--kind of like Schlotsky's deli, used in bread recipes (perhaps a Tbsp or two in "Jo's rosemary bread"?), or mixed with pesto for a unique pasta sauce.

This is a most excellent addition to any vegetarian cook book! The flavors are intense and go great on crostini brushed with olive oil and baked.
