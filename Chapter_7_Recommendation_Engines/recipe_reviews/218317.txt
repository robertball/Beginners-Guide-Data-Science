Boiling works fine, but you can really punch this up with a smoky flavor by roasting the peppers and even the tomatoes on the grill until the skins turns brown and is easy to remove. (Just cut a small X on the bottom of the tomato to help the skin slide off.) After roasting the skins, just place the veggies in a paper bag and let them steam for a bit, then remove the skins with a paper towel. I always use gloves to skin the peppers! Here in Tucson, AZ, chiles and peppers are plentiful and can be super-hot! You can knock back the heat by removing the membranes and seeds from the jalapenos, just use the flesh. My blender/processor does not like cilantro unless its been pretty chopped up first; the stems tend to just go 'round in circles and never chop up. 
I only add 1/2 lime, increase garlic to 5 bulbs (but we LOVE garlic!) and to make a more authentic verde flavor, I add roasted green chiles, skinned and seeded, with a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. Finally, let it sit in the refrigerator for an hour, then taste...you may want more lime at that point. Since there are many natural variables that will affect the heat of this basic salsa, be ready to punch up the heat with 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne or knock it down with sour cream, greek yogurt or even avocado. This is a great basic recipe that you can make your own! Keep covered in the refrigerator, and watch out...it can get hotter the longer it sits. Thanks, Trey!

This recipe is a great way to use up jalapenos! We tripled the recipe, but only used 20 seeded jalapenos - it was still really hot! We just put all the peppers and tomatoes right on a charcoal grill and flipped them around until they were dark all over. We skinned the tomatoes but not the jalapenos. I do think this recipe could use more garlic - we doubled the garlic and roasted it, but still could have used more. I used yellow onions, because that's all we had on hand. My husband thinks this is the best salsa he's ever had, and it was so easy to make in the food processor!

WOW! This is the kind of salsa you sweat while you cook and eat!  I took some other reviewers advice and roasted the jalapenos in the oven, as well as the onions and garlic.  I doubled the recipe because I had so many peppers from my garden and used a whole bulb of garlic and I think it's great.  I'm freezing some in ice cube trays to put in chili once the weather cools down, I know it'll be the perfect addition.  Great recipe with tons of uses!

This has the potential to pack some serious heat!  I erred on the side of caution and only used 7 jalapenos, deseeding all but two and it was plenty hot for me.   I also subbed  1/2 tsp sea salt for regular salt.   My husband said it was just as good, if not better, than the green salsa served in Mexican restaurants.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

This salsa tasted like something we would get from our local Taqueria!  The heat starts subtly and builds.  At times it was too much for me - which is why I gave it 4 stars.  My husband, on the other hand, embraced my challenge to eat spoonfuls of this and gave it a 5 after downing some milk :)  We used 10 fresh jalapenos to 4 tomatoes with a medium sized bunch of cilantro.  I initially used it to dress taco salads, but we ended up eating the majority of it with tortilla chips (and a healthy dollop of sour cream).

Watch the steam coming from this stuff when you're boiling the jalapeño and tomato. It will make you cough and have your eyes watering . Just a warning.

Seriously hot even when seeding some jalapenos. I will let my husband be the judge of that since our spice level differ but for sure, I will make some  more when we have a get together to test out who's the biggest wimp lol. I wanted to charr my jalapeno's/tomatoes on the grill but it wasn't working, so I pan roasted it intsead and covered it. Also, used kosher salt and doubled the garlic.

I love this! I used the recipe amounts to a T but I used 10 small jalapeños and two huge tomatoes. I also used a large onion. I tossed the onion quarters, peppers and tomatoes in sea salt and a little oil....then put all them on my broiler pan and I let the jalapeños get nearly black. I seeded them all as well.  I ended up adding a small tomato at the end. I used 1/2 a tbs of cilantro, 1 tbs of salt and 1/3 of a tbs of pepper. it turned out amazing.

It tastes amazing, but is extremely hot!  I still loved it, so not going to knock stars for the surprise.  I definitely plan on making it more in the future, but will probably de-seed all but two of the jalapenos.

How long does this salsa keep? I have a glut of jalapenos and I'm looking for new recipes that will keep us going for the year.

Great recipe!  You could swear it was made with tomatillos.  As others have mentioned, the heat is moderately hot.  Since my wife has a much lower heat tolerance than I, I made a separate batch, substituting 3 Anaheim peppers for the 12 jalapenos; she also thought it delicious.  Definitely a keeper.

I modified this recipe a bit.  I use 12 jalapenos, 6 tomatillos, 1 onion, 1 bulb of garlic, juice from 4 limes, 1 tbls olive oil, a healthy amount of cilantro (never measure it, I just put in tons!)  a bit of garlic salt, about a tbls of white vinegar.  blend everything in a food processor then simmer it on the stove for about a half an hour and jar it up.  I get 3 regular mason jars out of it and use it on taco salad.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I go through a batch in about 2 weeks and am now adding a ghost pepper to the mix to give it more heat and that nice smokey flavor from the jolokia!

First let me say that I would have given thus five stars if it didn't call for 10 jalapenos and/or warned about how raging hot it would be.  That being said, once I doubled everything else except the jalapenos and added it to the original recipe the flavor was really good, with a little kick at the end. The recipe itself was really quick and easy.

I would also recommend if you are using a blender to blend all the ingredients except the tomatoes to a little bit thicker than the texture that you want and adding the tomatoes at the end and blending just enough to blend the tomato.  I found that doing it all at once made the texture a little too thin.

LIke some others we grilled the peppers, onion, and added a grilled red pepper, and an entire bunch of garlic!

We've made this recipe three times. First time was with all seeds, second with no seeds, and last time with 3 peppers having seeds and that was the right "heat setting" for us! So basically, you can control the heat by how many peppers to remove the seeds from.

There are a couple issues with the recipe:  1.  the fumes given off  during simmering  were very strong.  2.  The recipe doesn't call for removing the seeds.  I removed the seeds and the salsa is still very hot, and I like hot, but ...

Maybe the jalapenos are supposed to be tiny and the tomatoes supposed to be greener? I used 7 jalapenos that were picked a week ago and two slicing tomatoes, and it came out hot as hades and an odd grey-brown color. Too much onion, too. But I added a can of crushed tomatoes (the big can), and that did the trick.
So, good enough recipe, but don't expect a mild to hot using 10 fresh jalapenos. Just saying.

I was looking for something with spice and to use the jalapenos from my garden.  I used 7 jalapeno and one banana pepper, 2 tomatoes and eyeballed the rest.  My plan was to use 10 jalapenos but the spice was enough with what I used.  I threw it all in a food processor, so it was definitely soupier than I typically make but it was great.  It made A LOT!

Amazing! Should be labeled, "knock your socks off HOT!" Followed the recipe the first time. 2nd time only used 3 jalapenos and 6 tomatoes but kept everything else the same. It's still hot and I like hot!

Made a half batch with some adjustments and it was fantastic!

I left out the cilantro, simply because I didn't have any, and added 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar, a dash of cumin, and substituted kosher salt for the regular.  I also don't have a food processor so I diced everything finely and let it all marinate in its own juices in the fridge for a couple hours, stirring every 30 minutes.

Very hot and absolutely delicious!

It is good, but  VERY hot.  I followed the recipe making minor adjustments: roasting the peppers & tomatoes, double the garlic, ½ the black pepper and added ½ tsp. cumin.

I used 4 jalapenos and it was too hot. I made it a second time and used 3 jalapenos, and it came out better. However, it didn't have enough flavor. Maybe I could use more garlic next time.

I couldn't get over how eay it was to make! I love the flavor and the fact that, it SOUNDS really hot but it's just right. Especially when you can  use the ingredients from your own garden...... Thanks for the recipe!

Followed directions for most part, but didn't peel tomatoes.   Extremely hot as I kept all seeds in 20 Jalapenos.   Made double batch.   Very good.  Make sure not to over blend and purée.

Lazy tonight. Didn't sauté - didn't boil. Stems handled and then right to the food processor. So mine doesn't have that nice chopped look either. That said - tastes great! Only thing I added were two table spoons of apple cider vinegar and a teaspoon of honey (countering the bitterness caused by processing tomato and pepper seeds). Great recipe - thank you.

It was great very hot! I used a variety of peppers. Hubby insisted on more lemon so it came out kind of tangy, next time I'll use less! Fast & easy!

This recipe is great, I took ellie may's recommendation and grilled the peppers, tomatoes and garlic on the barbeque before blending all the ingredients.  I also used 2x garlic but a bit less onion (wife can't handle too much) and less cilantro as well.  I am very happy with how it turned out, but it is VERY hot!  I mix in a bit of sour cream to cut the heat a bit, perfect!

I loved this salsa, my family loved this salsa.

I did add to the recipe a bit. I added more jalapenos, I added a few tabasco peppers and a few green chile's. Being from NM, we like it mega hot! Plus I had an abundance of all three of the above peppers and needed something to do with them!!
I also doubled the garlic. I used dry cilantro and used only 1 and a half tsps.

This recipe was very yummy, however, I think next time I will use a bit less onion and see how it tastes.

I also think that the next time I make it, I will process it so I can make more and keep it for a longer period of time. 

Very, very easy recipe to make, thumbs up!!

This recipe is really good. I prefer it spicier so I used a lot of jarred jalapeños and 1 and 1/2 fresh wax peppers. It tastes better with more lime juice.
