This was a nice way to add some veg to breakfast. I used Swiss chard and kale as my greens. I chose to saut√© the garlic first, until fragrant, and then add the greens. I also always salt/pepper at every step, as opposed to simply at the end. I halved the recipe for just me, and the egg to greens ratio was a bit off for me, but that is an easy fix. This was make a really nice egg component to a breakfast sandwich. Thanks for the recipe!
