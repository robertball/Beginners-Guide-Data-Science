Absolutely loved this recipe.  SO quick, SO easy and SO delicious!    Note:  1 cup chocolate chips = 6 oz. chocolate squares.

A very easy and testy recipe.  I used high quality bittersweet chocolate chips and it was just right in terms of sweetness.  Served this over homemade vanilla and mint oreo ice cream.  Rave reviews from my tasters.

I consider my self a Hot Fudge snob. I have tried every brand out there. My latest try was CC Brown's Hot Fudge Sauce it is really good. I've tried and experimented with lots of recipe's. This is by far the simplest and the creamiest. Some homemade sauces can turn out gritty. This one is the best!! I used Ghirardelli Chocolate chips and upped the butter to 4 T and added 2 dash's of salt (most recipes leave this out). It is thick creamy and very very good. I am done looking for the best recipe's this is it. So so easy.

Nice smooth sauce, consistancy was perfect--VERY sweet. I want to try this again with unsweetened chocolate, then re-review.

I cannot believe how good and easy this was.  It took minutes to make.  The only change I made was to add a tiny bit of vanilla extract.  I gave my dad a little bowl with this recipe and a little bowl of Smucker's (without telling him which was which) and he greatly and immediately preferred this one.

I said, "wow, if I knew how easy this stuff was to make..." ...  And Daddy chimed in and said, "You'd be 10 lbs heavier?"

Very easy and delicious recipe! I've tried other more complicated recipes in the past but needed something quick for last minute ice cream sundaes. This went over very well with my guests and I will certainly be making it again. I did find with the recommended amount of semisweet chocolate it was a little too sweet and not quite chocolatey enough  so I added some unsweetened cocoa powder to balance it out. I also found out with leftover fudge sauce it is great in coffee for a mocha treat.

This is perfect if you make and chill then use in other recipes, like putting a layer of the fudge between peanut butter cookie dough and baking as a bar. YUM!!

Definitely easy and quick, but I didn't find it to taste anything like a traditional hot fudge sauce. It was more like a pan of fudge that hadn't yet set. Not something I'd make again as-written. (I might try adding some raspberries to this batch to try to salvage it as a sauce.)

A nice simple recipe that tastes better than the high fructose corn syrup you get at the stores. I had all ingredients and made a nice surprise for my wife.

Yummy and so easy! I found the consistency way too thick even with the butter and put about 3 tbsp. of half and half and it was much better. Still thick enough but not goopey. I made myself a banana split with it and topped it with dark chocolate salted almonds. Sinful! I will always be making hot fudge from now on.

WOW!!!! So easy and so amazing. I wanted to make it dairy free so I used coconut cream in place of the condensed milk (no added sugar needed - this is very sweet), and margarine in place of butter. Like others, I added a dash of salt and a splash of vanilla. Both the consistency and the flavor were fabulous!

I had found a similar recipe which called for using the entire stick of butter so I compromised and used four tablespoons. The chips I used were a combination of milk and semi-sweet. While the sauce had a nice thickness to it, I found the taste to be more like flavored condensed milk. To add some richness I put in about two tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa. This seemed to deepen the flavor of the finished sauce. What an easy way to make something so much more delicious than any jarred version!

I would prefer a much darker sauce, but this was pretty spot on for replicating the jarred kind.

This was so very good. I added a teaspoon or a little more of Vanilla (pure) at the end.
Better than I have ever made.

Turned out good! This fits its description pretty well - And its easy, if not fool proof. I chose this recipe because it was easy looking, and I had the ingredients. I used this for Ice cream fudge; I advise using dark chocolate to offset the sweetness of the condensed milk. I used Ghiradelli dark chocolate melting chips.  Again, I strongly advise only using dark chocolate for this recipe, because of the condensed milk. Milk chocolate and bittersweet might still be too sweet.

Excellent fudge sauce.  I used bittersweet chocolate (it’s what I had on hand), and it came out perfect.  (I also added a pinch of salt, just because I always add a pinch...or an extra pinch....to any chocolate recipe).  Creamy and smooth.

Used unsweetened 4 oz baking chocolate and added 1/4 water since some reviewers thought it was too thick or pudding-like. Tastes rich but not too sweet or thick. Didn't give 5 stars since I had to tweak.

Too thick and not rich enough. I added a couple teaspoons of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon, which helped. But not wowed by this recipe's taste or consistency.

Mine ended up way to thick, but I think that is due, at least in part, to the fact that I didn't have any sweetened condensed milk, so I made my own.  I think I may have over thickened it, leading to the over thickness of the fudge sauce.  I used it anyway, just melting it in the microwave for a minute, and adding a little milk.  It was soooo yummy!
