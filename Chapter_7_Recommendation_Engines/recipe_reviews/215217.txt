yummy! and simple. although I strayed from the directions and just used a one-bowl, microwave method: melt the butter in a large microwave-safe bowl, add the marshmallows, microwave for 20 or 30 seconds, stir, repeat until smooth. Instead of using a buttered spoon, just wet your fingers a little with water and get on in there with your hands. the krispies won't stick to your fingers, and it's a lot easier than using a spoon.

You're a genius to put chocolate and coconut in to a familiar rice krispy favorite!  This treat is easy to make and "oh so good"!!  Treats were a huge hit at the office!!

I found this recipe while looking for a recipe for chocolate rice crispy treats. I didn't intend to use the coconut but at the last minute figured what the heck and since I had some flaked coconut on hand went ahead and added it. Everyone raved about this dessert, especially the coconut. It's subtle but just enough. I found this recipe 4 days ago and have already made it for 3 times for 2 different occasions. It's wonderful!!

These are so delicious! There really isn't that much coconut in them, but the flavor really comes through. I wasn't sure how they would turn out using only 5 cups of cereal (versus 6 cups when making regular krispie treats), but they are perfect! Definately will be making these again. Thank you for sharing!

This was perfect for my chocolate/rice krispie craving! I prefer thicker bars, so I used an 8x10 inch pan instead of a 9x13, and it worked beautifully. I also added more coconut than called for because I like it, and pressed semi-sweet baking chips on top to make it extra chocolately in addition to making it look prettier.

I needed to use my gluten-free rice cereal (reg) and marshmallows but wanted a slightly different rice krispie bar. These were simply delicious! Since, I only had regular rice cereal, I added about 3 tablespoon of cocoa powder and whisked it with melted butter.

These were ok.  Nothing spectacular.  I LOVE coconut and was hoping for a strong coconut flavor but it gets lost in the chocolate.  I won't make these again.

SO easy to make.  I wish I had packed the treats tighter so the end result would be more dense.

Made it twice, 1st time to try it out and the 2nd time for Easter.  Family and friends loved them.  Kids go CRAZY for them.  The 2nd time, I added 1/2 a cup of coconut instead of the 1/3 it calls for and it was even better.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!!!

I really enjoyed this version! The coconut added a nice texture.  Even though I always seem to have a hard time mixing these up efficiently they were worth the trouble.  I totally appreciated other people's advice of wetting your fingers with water to press it into the pan instead of wasting more butter.  Worked like a charm!

I only had regular Rice Krispies so I added about 1/3 cup cocoa and 1/4 cup chocolate chips to the marshmallow & butter mixture. Turned out nicely chocolatey with a hint of coconut.

Had a thought being its Christmas.  Might be good to omit the coconut and swap the marshmallows for peppermint marshmallows with the chocolate cereal, or, even split the marshmallows and use 1/2 regular and 1/2 peppermint ones in case all peppermint is too strong.
If anyone tries peppermint marshmallows, please write a review :)

This recipe was definitely a hit! I did add a half a cup of coconut instead of 1/3 and it wasn't too much at all. I used wax paper to pack it together so it wouldn't stick too much and that seemed to do the trick. I will absolutely be making this recipe again!

Easy and delicious. I use chocolate marshmallows if I have them, and a little more butter. I love how fast they come together. Everybody who tries them likes them much more than desserts I've fussed over for hours.

these were so delicious i found myself eating the whole thing and im not even a sweet tooth! The coconut was perfect for me but if you want a stronger coconut flavor you can add more
