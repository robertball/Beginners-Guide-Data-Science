This was the first time we tried hearts of palm and we did not care for them. I was in a rush when I made this so I turned up the flame and cooked it in about an hour total. Next time I will add another can of beans. Used a packet of fajita seasoning. Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and will definitely be making it again. Hopefully I will take more time the next time to let it simmer.

Great dish. I used an Emporium Spice Co. Chili Kit for seasoning. Also added Mahi Mahi to the meat. Turned out great.
