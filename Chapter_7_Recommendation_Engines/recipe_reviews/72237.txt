healthy and delicious with a few easy modifications--doubled the garlic and tomato, drizzled each fish with a small amount of olive oil and omitted the butter, added lots of salt and pepper and a splash of fresh lemon juice, sprinkled fish with dried basil rather than basil leaves (didn't have any on hand). baked in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes in 9x13 covered tightly with foil but can't wait to try it on the grill this summer. i served it up with brown rice and green beans for a nutritious and delicious dinner. i will keep this one in my regular rotation for sure!

This was a great recipe!  I did alter it a bit for my taste - baked it in the oven in a 9x13 pan for 20 minutes at 425 - threw all the indredients on top, included a splash of lemon, left out the tomatoes (don't like them) and I sauteed some onions and portobello mushrooms while I was waiting for the oven to heat up and put those on top too when I baked it.  I didn't have fresh basil on hand so I used dried - still delicious!  This is the first tilapia I've cooked that wasn't just so-so!

I thought this recipe was great; I will definitely make it again!  I tweaked it just a tad.  I only used 1/2 T. of butter on each piece of fish.  I used more garlic because I love it.  I will also use more basil next time.  I didn't have fresh tomato, so I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes, drained.  I squeezed some lemon juice and sprinkled with feta cheese just before serving.  YUM!!

excellent recipe! I changed it around a bit though. Instead of grilling the tilapia, I baked it on a 13x9 in baking dish, at 425 degrees for 20 min. I sauteed some mushrooms and onions in a little butter with some salt and pepper and threw it on top with the rest of the ingredients. Instead of using basil, I used dried parsley, because I didn't have any basil. I also sprinkled the fish with garlic powder as well as fresh garlic because we LOVE garlic. Didn't use the tomatoes, not a fan of them. The butter and wine sauce was amazing, the fish was flaky and delicious...this recipe is a must!

Easy to make with a delicious, full flavor. This is a favorite at my house. I follow the recipe exactly, except that I cook it in foil in a pan in the oven at 400 degrees for around 20 minutes.

It was too chilly outside to grill, so I made this on the stovetop, poaching the fish in a covered saute pan.  Used about a 1/2 can of drained petite diced tomatoes since fresh tomatoes sold at the grocery are still not-so-fresh in the taste department.  Doubled the garlic and basil amounts, but reduced the butter by half.  Once the fish was done and plated, I reduced the poaching liquid by half and poured on top.  Very light entree which was enjoyed by all.  Thanks for an easy recipe!

This was an excellent recipe. I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used diced canned w/ garlic, oregano and basil and added extra garlic.  I do think it could have used more salt, but it was yummy.  I also baked it in the oven at 400 for about 18ish minutes.  Thumbs up!

I cut the wine in half and it was superb. My husband thought this was fantastic, he couldnt stop talking about it while he was eating it and after he had eaten it. I will be trying this with other types of fish as well. It turns out I didnt make enough as my two kids went nuts for this too. I cut the recipe in half since we're not big eaters and made made 2 big filets. Next time I'll make 6 because I think my husband and son will eat 2 a piece. What a flavorful and healthy recipe!

All in all a good recipe....super easy to make, super quick (took the advice of someone else and cooked for 12 mins on the GF grill as it was too cold to grill outside) very light tasing will be great for summer with pasta and a salad. My husband adored it and I will definitely make in the near future. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This wasn't bad.  I used sliced cherry tomatoes (fresh from my windowsill) and lemon pepper.  Way, way too much wine!  Most of it leaked out of the packets, but enough stayed in to keep the fish moist.  I'll make  it again, just with less wine.

The ONLY reason I am giving this a lower rating is that I may have done something wrong - the package of fish was still very watery. So I took out the fish and put it on a pan and baked it for another 10 minutes and it was delicious. The combination of ingredients led to a great flavor...I just had an extra water issue.

Oh my gosh, this is amazing and super easy to make!  I seasoned my filets with salt, Mrs. Dash Original, garlic pepper blend, fresh garlic, fresh basil and tomatoes.  I only used 1 tablespoon of butter and sliced small slivers to cover the filets.  I only used about 3/4 cup of white wine and drizzled over and around the filets.  Baked in a 9x13 dish covered in foil.  And like others 20 mins @ 425 degrees.  Wonderful flavor!!!

I just love this recipe. It can be tweaked so many different ways and still come out great. I only used 1/2 cup of the white wine and drizzled the fish with oilve oil instead of using butter. I didn't have fresh tomatoes so used Rotelle's diced tomatoes with green chilis...spooned some over each fillet.....awesome. Too lazy to pull the grill out of storage so baked them in the oven at 425 for about 20 minutes, then check and bake longer if needed.   Thank you so much for this recipe. Will be making it often.

Very yummy! My husband found this recipe and took over.. :) We used salsa instead of the tomato because that's what we had in the fridge. Great fish recipe!

This was a great recipe, but I put my own twist on it. I melted the butter in a pan. Sauteed the minced garlic. I didn't brown the garlic though. Then I added the diced tomatoes let it cook for a little bit, until I can see the tomato skin starting to separate from the flesh. Then I added a splash of white wine (enjoyed the rest of the wine with our dinner). Cooked all of that for 3-5 mins. While waiting on that to cook down a little bit, I seasoned the fillets with salt and pepper and put each fillet in foil. I created a pocket like the recipe suggested and spooned the rest of the ingredients, dividing them up evenly onto each fillet. Then baked for 15 mins. I served with rice with sauteed mixed veggies and lemons to squeeze on the fish. My husband and daughter enjoyed this recipe so much.

Easy and delicious! The fish is soooo moist and tender. You can also cook it in the oven, also in a foil bag, I find at about 425 for about 12-15 minutes.

So far, this is the best tilpia recipe I've come across. It's not bland, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I like the taste of tilapia with tomatoes :) I honestly did not expect to enjoy it. The only change I made was to use a little extra garlic and dried basil instead of fresh. I sauteed the garlic in the butter because I prefer my garlic to be cooked. Then I added the rest of the ingredients to the butter/garlic mixture and simply poured this over each piece of fish in its own tinfoil pouch. I cooked the pouches in the oven for about 10 minutes on 400. Yum!

This was a quick and easy dish. I had to substitute canned, diced tomatoes for fresh and it still tasted great.  The white wine and butter made a light and delicious sauce.  I used a double layer of foil for the packets and everything cooked in 15 minutes as promised.  Next time, I would add a little more basil.  This is going to be a summertime regular in our house.

I also made a few modifications after reading the reviews. I added chopped onions to the tomato and mixed it in a bowl with dried basil, red pepper flakes, olive oil, white wine, 1 capful of lemon juice & a capful of balsamic vinegar.  I poured the mixture over the tilapia & baked it in foil. It was really good & I'm not a big fish fan. I will make again.

We really enjoyed this easy idea for tilapia!  We used a disposable foil pan then covered with foil & it worked great.  Didn't measure the wine, just poured some over the fish & some in the bottom.

We omitted the tomatoes since we served it with a side of grilled tomatoes.  The combination was great!  (cut tomatoes in 1/2, salt & pepper, drizzle with balsamic vinegrette dressing, sprinkle with parmesan cheese - grill 15 minutes)

We'll make this again throughout the summer, and will likely add fresh mushrooms next time!

beautiful flavor!  Only thing I changed was red for white wine, as I didn't have the later.  Baked in oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and served over whole wheat pasta.  The fresh basil really makes this nice.  Tilapia was very sweet and mild.  Nice easy recipe.

This recipe was wonderful, and fairly easy.  However, it is the middle of winter, so grilling was not an option for me.  I used the oven at 350 with a covered dish, and in 25 minutes the fish was flaking and done.  My husband said he felt like he'd gone to a restaurant!  Another hint, I used a Peach Chardonnay, and then we had peaches and the wine with the meal, it all blended so well together!

This was awesome!  Besides the halved Cherry Tomatoes and chopped fresh Basil, I am a Garlic fan so I used more garlic (2X what was called for here.)  I  was generous with the Butter, dotting each piece with 3-4 shavings of butter pad as well.  I used the Pinot Grigio I had on hand in the fridge.  As suggested by another reviewer, I baked it in the oven in a 9X13 pyrex glass dish covered tightly with tin foil for 20  minutes at 425.  The result was IMPRESSIVE especially for the quick prep/bake time, and ingredients called for one generally has on hand.  PS:  I used fresh/wild Tilapia fillets but I would imagine Orange Roughy or similar would do as well.

As others did, I also used a (sprayed) 9x11 glass dish. In a bowl, I mixed the garlic, basil (a lot more than 4 leaves though... more 20!), tomatoes, and juice of one whole lemon together, then topped the fish. I baked at 425 for 15 minutes for the perfect flake (I used grouper). Will make this again!

Turned out a bit bland and quite wet, even with modifications suggested by other reviewers.  I would probably try it again with less liquid ingredients and more spices.

A great base recipe--one of our favorite ways to eat tilapia. I bake it in a glass 9x13 pan tightly covered with foil at 425 for 18-20 minutes. I use canned tomatoes for ease and reduce the amount of wine to about 1/4-1/3 cup. Dried basil works in a pinch. I've also added capers with great results.

I prepared and boyfriend loved it. I did change a bit. Cut the butter to 1/2 tsp on each filet and used olive oil. This was easy to easy to prepare and used tomato from my container garden and basil from my herb container. I loved suggestions for baking and I was out of charcoal, so threw into oven. yum we will have again.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Tilapia is something my husband is never excited about eating because it's always so bland (at least the way I've cooked it in the past I guess).  He loved this recipe.  I didn't have a fresh tomato, so I used some canned fire roasted tomatoes, and I think they made it that much better.  Thank you!

I'm kind of new on this site and this was the very first recipe I tried that I just absolutely loved! Plus, my picky chef boyfriend, too! I excluded the tomatoes because we didn't have any on hand. I also took a recipe for balsamic glazed carrots (added onions to the mix) and conjoined the two recipes. Other than the carrots needing a little more cook time than the fish, everything was absolutely fabulous!

Well, here goes nothing! I couldn't find tilapia in the (in)convenience store so I had to get chicken instead. Then when I got home I found I'd run out of foil, so I am using baking paper instead, on an oven tray!

But I am happy with the combination of ingredients and hopefully it will be just as tasty as everyone else said, but with chicken instead!

Oh and this is my first review! Go me! :D

This recipe is not only super quick and super easy when done on the grill, but can be done in the oven as well, which is what I did.  I’m not a big fan of foil packets, so I used a couple of shallow individual oval baking dishes.  I made 2 servings for Hubs and me using a mix of fresh red and yellow cherry tomatoes.  I quartered my tomatoes and tossed them in a bowl with the garlic and basil; then spooned over the tilapia.  I couldn’t fit all the wine into my baking dishes, so I used 4 T. total for my 2 servings.  Covered with foil and baked at 350 for about 25 minutes.  Yes, super quick and super easy and super delicious!  Not to mention beautiful using both red and yellow tomatoes!

As written this was not good at all.  Cooking the fish with wine in a sealed foil packet does not allow any of the alcohol to evaporate off.  It just tastes like you are eating alcohol drenched fish (and that may sound good...but it's not).  I won't make it again, but as a suggestion to those who want to, I would suggest leaving the foil packet open to allow everything to still cook together, but also allow the alcohol to cook off.

It was good.  A different way to prepare tilapia.  I added some onions as well and that seemed to make it a little more flavorful.

I have never made fish before, so I tried this recipe since it looked simple and easy. I also added a few things to it as suggested by other reviewers (mushrooms and onion with a splash of lemon) This was really good, we enjoyed it very much...thanks for sharing it!!

Very healthy, very mild fish recipe.  I loved the combination of the buttery garlic wine sauce and the tomatoes and basil.  I baked it at 400 degrees for 15-18 minutes.  It was perfectly cooked.

Very good, I enjoyed the ease, flavor, and speed of this recipe.  I put the foil packet on my George Forman grill for about 12 minutes, and it came out moist and tender, so tender it all fell apart when I tried to serve it.

We followed the recipe, but baked it in the oven in a casserole dish all together. IT was very easy and tasted great! Had to increase the baking time, but it was easy to tell when it was done. The flavor was wonderful! My kids even asked for more! I am saving this one for next time! YUMMY!

For ease, this is 5-stars...however, it is rather bland.  A great idea but definitely needs more flavor.  Perhaps marinating the tomatoes, etc. prior to putting on the fish would have brought out more flavor.

Hubby says it's a keeper!  I modified it like others did, but the basic concept is the same.  I had 1 lb frozen tilapia, placed on foil, doubled the garlic, used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes (with garlic and basil), and sprinkled dried basil on the fish.  Used only 1/2 c of white wine.  Wrapped it in the foil and baked at 425 for 20 min.  There was a lot of juice.  I don't know if this was because the fish was frozen, but I am glad I didn't use a full cup of wine.  It was very tasty!!

Made exactly as written except for using a bit less butter. My fillets were not very big so I grilled the packets 5 minutes per side. It was delicious and I will definitely make this again. I just realised while writing this that I forgot the wine completely...so I guess it is optional...lol

I used a can of tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano.  Served over egg noodles.  Really simple, and tasted OK, but really watery.  I won't rush to make again

Delicious.  I substituted olive oil for the butter to make it a little healthier and threw some mushrooms in to mix things up a little.

Oh, my goodness!  This was the best fish I have ever made!  I used haddock instead of tilapia (had it in the freezer), but will be trying it with other varieties of fish as well.  It was moist and flavorful and we really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this dish for dinner tonight and my husband and I both enjoyed it.   It was almost like something that you would get from Olive Garden.   My husband did request more garlic for next time.  I will definitely make this dish again.

The fish came out beautifully, however the flavor was a little too mild for me.  I"m not 100% sure the cooking time is correct either.  I have a charcoal grill, and I ended up cooking it at 250 for 25 mins before it was finished.  Was still tender and flaky though so it worked out.

I made this in the oven as other reviewers had suggested.  I found it very bland, my husband and I both had to add tons of salt/pepper to give it flavor.  It is very pretty though with the tomato and basil!

This recipe was surprisingly awesome! Very fast and easy to make, and my whole family, including my 9 and 13 year olds, devoured. All I had on hand was the cheapie cooking white wine. It worked great. Served with some a steamed mix of asparagus/brocoli/squash. I will make again very soon.

I tried this with the Tilapia and also fresh haddock - I like it with the haddock better - maybe because it is a "meatier" fish.  I just drizzle the wine once over entire packet and sprinkled a little fresh lemon juice on it befre serving.

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to decrease the amount of wine to 2 tbs. or so for each fish.  In addition to the basil I used fresh parsley and chives, since that's what I had, but I think any combination thats on hand would work well.  I also placed each fish in they're own packet of foil and I baked them instead of grilling.

great way to make fish differently than the norm. next time I will spray the foil with olive oil spray to prevent the sticking though. This was good with plain rice.

Great recipe. It was super easy. My family gave it 4.75 stars!  I followed other's advice and only used about a qtr cup of wine. I sprinkled dried basil, placed a lemon slice on each filet, and baked in the oven @ 425 for 30 minutes.

Very light dinner!  My picky eater kids ate it and asked for more.  I added mushrooms, onions, red pepper flakes, and used dried basil.  Next time I will use fresh basil to brighten it up.  I also baked it in the oven because it's winter in Wisconsin but I can't wait to try this over the fire camping.  It's worth trying something new with a cheaper fish.

this recipe is great...simple and easy. I have cooked a lot of tilapia and some of the recipes were similar. I followed the recipe and just added some capers and nicoise olives cause I love them. A must try, especially for those who do not normally eat fish. It is mild and very easy.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! Since I don't drink alcohol though, we made it with White Grape Juice, and it was fantastic still! Tastes great with pasta! I've also made it with chicken when I can't get a good price on Tilapia, and that tastes fantastic too!

Pretty good! Used a can of drained diced tomatoes, dried basil, cooking-grade wine and olive oil/butter. Cooked in oven 400 deg. 20 minutes.  Next time I'll try with everything fresher and better wine.

So yummy!  I used 1/2 of the wine as suggested from other reviewers.  I also used cherry tomatoes instead of a large tomato.  The kids and husband ate every bit!

I did as others suggested and cooked it in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes. I thought it tasted pretty good, but the sauce was so thin I was disappointed. I will make again though, definitely the most flavorful tilapia recipe I've tried yet. Next time, I may do something to thicken the sauce, or perhaps just cook in the over without covering it in foil so the liquid could cook down.

awesome recipe! thanks so much for sharing this. I've been on a health kick and have been trying to cut out red meat in my diet. This was a GREAT and SUPER easy dish to add to the dinner rotation. I omitted the butter and replaced it with olive oil, I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried basil. Everything I had on hand - except the tilapia. 5+ stars for me!

I love this recipe it is a nice change from the lemon and dill fish we usually make. It is yummy and I always get compliments on it. I believe I add more wine and basil. I really don't measure I just pour it on! YUM!

A tasty recipe in its own right and a wonderful base for customizing. I greased a 13"x9" glass baking dish. In the interest of adding a little zing, I rubbed the fillet's with olive oil a little butter and drizzled with a bit of lemon juice. Sprinkled lightly with ground Cayenne pepper, Celery Salt, salt, pepper and dried Basil. Topped with sauted garlic, Capers and herbed Diced Tomatoes (mostly drained) and baked for 25 minutes at 425 degrees. It was a big hit and the kids tore it up, one after saying she hated Tilapia. Hint: easy on the Cayenne!!

Even though this wasn't my kind of dish (I'm not a big tomato sauce fan) I gave it five stars because my husband absolutely loved it.  He said it actually tasted a lot like a dish that he orders at the Olive Garden.  It was very easy to make - 5 minutes of prep time; I pretty much just did my own thing while it cooked, which only took about 20 minutes.  I'll be adding this one to our repertoire!

This recipe was pretty good - but I think next time I will add some seasoning like Old Bay to the fish before cooking as well as some lemon slices - the fish was a little bland.  Also, I think that it is important to mention that you have to use GOOD white wine, as the fish takes on the flavor.  Cooking wine is a no-no for sure!

Awesome recipe! My husband said "Don't loose this recipe".  My 1 year old even loved it! Didn't use a grill just pan fried in butter and used dry basil.  Still came out yummy!

I make something like this for my husband and I that uses 2 fillets, 3 Tbs of olive oil, 1 diced garlic clove, 3 small fresh basil leaves (torn), 1/2 c or so of cherry tomatoes, 2 Tbs or so of freshly shredded parm cheese, and 1/2 c of white wine. I stir all ingredients together and let stand while I prepare  the fish (wash, pat dry, place on foil in broiler pan). Coat the fish on both sides with ingredients. Broil each side for 4 minutes. It's great, easy and very similar to this recipe.

This recipe was pretty good.  I made some adjustments to accommodate what I had handy.  Instead of the fresh garlic cloves, I first sprinkled garlic pepper on the fish.  The garlic pepper has salt and pepper in it, so be careful not to overload it with garlic pepper because it will become too salty. Then I put dried basil (it was not fresh dried basil).  I then put some garlic powder on it- to enhance the garlic flavor.  I sliced the tomatoes thinly.  The tomatoes were a really good asset to the recipe; they soaked all the ingredients and were really tasty.  Next time I will add more.  Like the other comments, I added just a little butter and enough Barefoot Chardonnay Wine just to get it wet because I did not want it to become a sloppy mess.  Wrapped it in foil and cooked for about 20 minutes.  Then I opened the foil and let it cook for about another 5 minute to dry it out a little.  It turned out wonderful and was not one of my usual hot mess internet recipes.

Tilapia fish is a staple at home. But I am always looking for better ways to prepare it. This was so easY! And so delicious! It was buttery and just the right amount of spice. I am on a diet so I reduced the butter to 1 tbs, (when cold you can slice it very thinly, it was all that it needed!) and dried basil, no fresh available. Next time I am cutting the wine in half. Also I baked instead of grilled. DELICIOUS! Thank you! i'll be making this often!

Not bad, but a little bland, even with fresh basil, homegrown tomatoes & extra garlic. I think I'll try some others before I make this again.

This is my favorite tilapia recipe and I've made it several times.  You MUST use fresh basil and fresh tomatoes or it just won't be the same.  I grow basil and when I harvest it, I put it through the food processor with olive oil to make a basil "paste" and then freeze it in ice cube trays.  I use those cubes to make this recipe... just thaw a cube in the microwave with some butter to melt it and then brush that on the fish.  FANTASTIC!  I make this in the oven with great results too.  I've also served it to company and it got great reviews.

I made this once a few months ago in the oven with canned tomatoes, and we thought it was good but not fantastic. Then I decided to try it again tonight on the grill with fresh grape tomatoes sliced in half - wow, what a difference! The flavors were fresh and light, and the fish was perfectly moist after 12 minutes. The only other changes I made were to use garlic-infused olive oil instead of butter and to wrap each filet in its own foil packet instead of all together in one. Now I would definitely make this for company; perhaps it's the grill that's the difference for those who found the dish a little bland after baking.

WOW! I used a Pinot Grigio and canned tomatoes. Paired it with brown rice and broccoli. This was the best tilapia I ever made. It was so healthy and flavorful. Easily a 5 star recipe!

This recipe reminds me of years ago. In Acapulco where they had huge fire pits, and prepared whole red snapper,(I know "they" re-named it, what's that all about?)by stuffing the opening of the fish with the most simple ingredients: thin slices of lemon; tomato; onion...then they just wrapped it tight in foil and threw it in the fire...OMG it was divine! Not haute cuisine, or gourmet by any means...just fresh, clean healthy. Years later I prepared my take on it with a whole salmon, on the barbeque at a party there were no leftovers...with salmon being a fattier fish, you really don't need an addition of butter, maybe olive oil if you wish to add the flavor, but not necessary. In case you can't tell I'm all about healthy, but not at the cost of flavor...I just try to tweak recipes to make them more on healthy side,but really it's pointless to prepare "healthier meals" if no one will eat them. It's not just about calories but also chemicals, I really try to pay attention to all the garbage the FDA allows "them" slip to us, scary stuff...read those labels. Sorry to have gone on a rant!This recipe is really Yummy, Thanks for sharing!

This was absolutely delicious as written, and pretty effortless.  I had to wrap everything in several layers of foil to keep the wine from leaking out, but other than that, very easy and very tasty.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very delicious recipe. I tried it few times and it always turns out great. The only thing I change is the amount of wine I add.. I go for half of what the recipe calls for so the sauce is a little thicker.

This is a great weeknight dinner.  We followed the directions exactly (except we used dried basil from last year's garden because our basil hasn't come up yet).  The fish was perfectly cooked with 15 minutes on the grill, and the sauce was very tasty.  We served it over brown rice, but pasta would have worked well, too.  This is a definite keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Great quick fix! I wanted something simple to make just for myself, as my family doesn't eat much seafood and our local Dollar Tree started carrying nice tilapia filets. Rinsed, thawed fish went in the foil wrap along with the other suggested ingredients, although I reduced the liquid considerably and still had plenty! (I used about 1 tsp of margarine, 2 tsp of wine, and a splash of key lime juice. I also didn't have the tomato, but look forward to using it next time.) I sealed the packet, baked at 350F for 15 minutes, turned off the oven and let the fish rest for 5 minutes, then opened the packet to discover a perfectly cooked, tender, delicious serving of fish! Wonderful!

I'm a REALLY picky fish-eater, so this easy recipe is a wonderful find. I'll definitely be making it again, and soon! :)

I did make a few changes. First off I used lemon juice instead of white wine and chives instead of basil leaves. I added some dry parsly and basil.. I also baked it in the oven on 350 for 13 mins. This is a great refreshing summer meal. I really liked this and will be trying this out on the grill real soon.  More people need to try this and rate it!!!

This is awesome... tweaked it a little after reading reviews.. added mushrooms and onions.. I sauteed the garlic, onions and mushrooms in butter.. added a can of petite diced tomatoes and some sherry and cooked it together.. decided to try it on top of the stove, pan fried the fish in a bit of olive oil.. then poured sauce over top and let it heat through.. was very good this way.. Thanks !!

This was a great recipe!  I did not have basil on hand (winter) but I did have pesto in the fridge.  So, I chopped the tomatoes &  garlic and added 1/4 cup of white wine with about 1 tbs. of pesto.  Mix it all together and let it marinate for about 10 mins.  Just spoon it on top of the fish in the foil packet.  I think it turned out really good.

This turned out really good. My husband loved it. I used a drained can of chopped tomatoes with basil and olive oil. I also added some fresh spinach and took the other suggestions of baking it in the oven.

Maybe I did something wrong.  I chose this recipe based on the rave reviews, but it turned out just average for me. Except for adding chopped red onion and (like some other reviewers), cooking the fish in the oven, I followed the directions as written.

I like tilapia, so it tasted fine, but it was not especially flavorful.  In the future I'll go back to my favorite tilapia recipe: Easy Baked Tilapia submitted by FMCNerney.

Good - would be better w/ some lemon, parm cheese.  I used Lemon Pepper as well.  Just needs a bit more flavor.

Wayy too much wine.  Perhaps use 1/2 cup or 1/4 cup.  I baked it in the oven for 400F for 10 minutes than 450F for 10 more minutes (the oven times/temp varies according to your brand, of course!).

Simply excellent! The basil added great flavor, the fillets were very moist with a delicate taste. I forgot the butter but still received rave reviews from my dinner guests! Definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS GREAT.SO DID MY HUSBAND AND 2 KIDS AGES 2 AND 4. MY 4 YEAR OLD IS VERY PICKY! I HAD TO TAKE THE LEAVES AND STUFF OF HIS AFTER COOKING. I THOUGHT IT HAD GREAT FLAVOR BUT I USED A LOT MORE GARLIC AND BASIL. I USED A LITTLE MORE TOMATOE.
          THANKS!

I made this tonight for dinner and it is an easy and quick recipe. I used the stated ingredients, but went less on the butter and wine. I also added shaved parmesan to the top of the fish. This was an okay meal, but probably will not make this again. There are so many great ways to make tilapia.

Very good over brown rice! I also put baby bella mushrooms and onions over the baked tilapia (used the 425 and 15 minute idea!). A little less tomatoes than the suggested amount would probably make it even better!

This is good.  However, like a lot of white fish entrees, you need to add a lot of seasoning if you're looking for a flavorful dish.  I added a lot of red pepper and garlic…in hindsight, could have added even more, but I was afraid to over-season.  I'll keep this in mind next time, as I think it's hard to over-season white fish.  There was a lot of excess liquid, but I didn't find it to be a problem, as I just removed the fish to serve it and drizzled the liquid over the top.

Followed the directions exactly! Used the juice to spoon over my side dish. Next time I will use quinoa or rice for the side for the juice. I made the dish with Corvina and used some powdered seafood seasoning for extra taste.

I have been using on this web site for years and I have never rated a recipe before.  But I enjoyed this so much that I had to rate it!!!!   Wonderful and absolutely delicious.  Served it with fresh green beans and basmati rice.  Healthy and simple.  I have been trying to add fish to my rotation and I could never find a recipe that didn't add a lot of calories.   Thank you for sharing!

This is the second time I made this in 4 days. My husband and I love the flavor. The only thing that I changed was to reduce the wine to 1/4 cup to lower the liquid level in the pouch. Great flavor and moist tilapia. Love it!!

This recipe is nice and simple. I also added some onion on top of the fish, and instead of grill I left it in the oven for 20 minutes. I really liked how the tomato turns out, great compliment to the fish!

Delicious! I gave it 4 stars because I think sauteing the garlic first would be better. It was still a bit raw. I used olive oil instead of butter and 1/2 cup wine (Sake) like others suggested. I wrapped in foil as directed and cooked in the oven at 425 for 20 mins as suggested by other reviewers. It was cooked perfectly (except for the garlic).  thanks for the wonderful recipe - I'll definitely be making it again :)

Definately making this one again. Didn't have a white wine open so I splashed in a little rice vinegar.  Mixed last 4 ingredients together before plopping it on the fish and butter.  Tasted great on jasmine rice. Don't forget to use the fish and tomato juices on the rice. Delicious!

This recipe was super easy and so tasteful.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I took all the sauce, put it in a pan and reduced it, it went great to put on top of the fish after.  Great, healthy, flavorful recipe!

Surprised at how delicious.  Used all fresh ingredients out of the garden, and fish off the pier.  A new favorite!

This is a great recipe. I did this recipe a little different though. I added capers and I also used a bag made out of baking sheets. This goes great with white wine and lemon risotto.

Really good.  I reduced the butter and added some EVOO.  Because it was raining, baked at 350 for 30 minute but could have baked for less.  Next time, I will add some red pepper flakes.

Great recipe!  I baked it in the oven at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes in a foil packet.  Instead of a tomato I used a can of Italian diced tomatoes.  I then served it on top of Parmesan Romano rice with a side salad. Delicious!!

One of my all time favorite fish recipes. YUM YUM. The flavors are so simple but they all work together to bring out this really healthy/light taste. I usually add a little more garlic and I use Sake instead of white wine.

Delicious! I followed the modifications mentioned and used olive oil instead of butter. I also cooked each fish in its own individual packet and in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes. The fish came out flaky, and moist. My husband loved it!

This was such a good recipe. The fish was moist and flavorful. I added a lemon slice for each piece of fish, layering lemons and tomatoes. It was quick and easy and very good.

Great recipe, butter is way better but not as healthy obviously.  Didn't use the wine cuz i didn't have any around the house but will try next time with more tomatoes.  Still, very tasty maybe add a little garlic salt too.

Actually, this is more like 3 1/2 stars.  It's quick, colorful, and healthy, but I think it needs more seasoning. We add lemon pepper, salt, oregano, and extra basil plus have fresh lemon to squeeze over the fish on the table.

Terrific and easy.  One of the best fish recipes I have tried.  We only used half the butter and did not use fresh garlic but it still turned out great.  Easy to prep, easy to cook, juicy and delicious fish!

I used more tomato, garlic and basil.  I used 1/2 cup wine and still thought it had a lot of liquid.  It was very good when you had tomatos with the fish, but if you had a bite of fish alone it was a little bland.

I don't know. This just didn't do much for me.  I think I will try it again though with less wine.  But it was quick and easy and had pretty color and I am sure it is pretty healthy.

I loved this dish!  It was so light and full of flavor!  The only thing I wish I didnt do was use up the rest of our frozen tilapia, because they were a little fishy.  But other than that...this is delish!  Next time I will for sure make a trip to the store for fresh fish so I dont ruin the dish again.  Also instead of the foil packets, I used one of those disposable aluminum pans you can buy for like 50 cents.  Its much more durable for dishes like this than aluminum foil on the grill.  And that way you can throw everything in it and carry it around easily.  Honestly I wouldnt see much of a difference in this recipe on the grill or in the oven.  I think just on the grill you get that more intense heat to start simmering the sauce to reduce it more than an oven would.  Either way Im sure this would be great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't in a fish mood but fed this to my BF. He said the "sauce" was very potent - and that was after I cut the wine to 1/2 cup. I used a teaspoon olive oil and a teaspoon lemon over each fillet. One large tomato, four cloves garlic, fresh basil... baked in foil packets at 400* for 20 minutes. BF requested more lemon and olive oil next time as well as a thicker sauce... Will make again!

My family loved this.  I would suggest spraying the aluminum foil with nonstick spray (the fish stuck to the foil when I cooked it).   I used small fillets,  they came out a little dry. I will reduce the cooking time to about 15 minutes next time and I will add a little lime juice for extra flavor.

This was delicious!!  I will be making this again.  I took the advise of someone else's here and added feta and lemon juice.  I didn't have white wine but I had a white wine spritzer so I used that and it still tasted great!

I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried but other than that I followed the recipe. It just came out too soupy not enough flavor. It wasn't bad but not sure I'd make it again.

My boyfriend loved this but I thought it was okay.  It was very light and fresh, but not overly flavorful- just tasted like the wine.  And I doubled the amount of garlic.  Next time I think I will add some Old Bay or cajun seasoning to give it more flavor.  If you don't like fishy taste though, this cooking method takes away the fishy flavor.  It was too cold to grill, so I baked it in a 425 oven for 20 minutes and it was perfectly done.

I made this tonight.  AMAZING!!!! I only had salmon so I used that.  I omitted the butter and used olive oil instead.  Didn't have any fresh basil so I used dried.  I didn't have any white wine so I substituted lemon juice and capers.  Absolutely Fabulous!!! Thank you for a great recipe!!!!

WOW!  I  just  wanted  to  say  I LOVE this! I did everything but the chopped tomato and wine ( I just didn't feel like getting out the tomatoes because I made this dish for just me and I didn't use wine, personal taste ) and it was delish! I heavily  suggest this dish for anybody!

I'm not sure why so many people rated this recipe so highly. It had so much liquid in it that it was a soggy mess as another reviewer said. If I ever try it again I would reduce the wine to 1/4 cup instead of a full cup. The wine overwhelmed all the other flavors in this dish. I added in some Parmesan Cheese and baked it in the oven at 400 degrees since it's only 20 degrees outside and grilling it would be a bit cold. Also, I substituted Pollock for Tilapia but I seriously doubt that would change anything.

Amazing. We're having lots of kitchen problems so I mixed all the ingredients in a little casserole dish and cooked this in the toaster oven at 425 for 20 minutes. It was on the table within 30 minutes of getting home, looked elegant, and tasted like a restaurant dish. I served with the extra juices poured over pasta and green beans. Fantastic recipe.

Very yummy dish. I was cooking for myself, so I didn't want to do all the work of starting the grill. I popped in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes. I also added a bag of frozen vegetables and used olive oil instead of butter. So good! Thanks!

Very good.  Hard to get my husband to eat fish, so the fresh toppings really jazzed it up.  Would make it again.  I made mine in the oven, by the way, as other reviewers suggested.

This was very good.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added more garlic, and I used sherry instead of white wine (didn't have any) and topped it with the tomatoes, some mushrooms and feta cheese.  It came out great.  My husband who hates fish loved it!

It has an "Italian" taste to it. Something that I was expecting. I used a pear heavy chardonnay because I had thought a fruit wine will complement all the ingredients. I used Genovese basil, which is common but doesn't make a difference in the flavor - might as well use pesto. I think a bit of heat would be nice with some chili pepper flakes. Not bad recipe, the prep is right on.

Delicious!!  This was my first time making fish and it was a success.  I baked it in the oven 400 for 20 min.  I also added a few things based on other reviews: Lemon, a must as well as fresh and dried basil then I poured the sauce over the fish and rice.  This was easy to make and tasted light and refreshing.

Great recipe!  The only things I did different were to add some red pepper flakes for some heat and some olive oil instead of butter on the fish.  I also seasoned the fillets directly with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  It turned out delicious, but with a little too much liquid.  Next time, I will halve the amount of wine.

Not bad. Next time I will try some lemon juice and parsley and I will cook it on the stove. The foil packets are more trouble than they are worth given that all you are doing is steaming. The left-overs were really great.

Unbelievably good and easy! I added fresh parsley in addition to the fresh basil. And the lemon juice others recommended is a must, in my mind. 

If all recipes were this easy and delicious, we'd all be eating out a lot less! And more than likely, eating better!

Normally I love tilapia.  I figured this recipe was a "can't miss" kind of thing.  White wine, lots of tasty veggies (I added sauteed onions and mushrooms as suggested, and a nice mild fish to absorb all the flavor.  Boy was I surprised when I took it off the grill and it tasted like...nothing.  It had about as much flavor as if I had just grilled the fish with no seasoning at all.

I baked this on foil in a pan, in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes.  It was good!  When I make it again I will add some additional seasoning salts or some extra "zing" of some kind.

Really enjoyed this!  Easy to prepare, cook and modify.  I could see adding any number of veggies to the foil as it cooked.  Next time, I'll add some zucchini and red peppers.  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is so easy to make and so delicious!  After the tilapia is finished.  I combine the tomatoes and the rest of the wine sauce with bowtie noodles and serve the tilapia over it.  Yum!

Made this for dinner tonight and we loved it. As other posters did, I baked the fish in a 425 degree oven for 20 minutes and it was cooked perfectly. Also spiced it up with some hot Hungarian paprika and white pepper. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Next time I will use more salt, but that was my error, not the recipe's. Great flavor for Tilapia!

My family and I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I make it a lot.  I was little leary about the wine flavor being too strong in the meal and it wasn't, it still tasted amazing!!  I've even tried it with salmon and it was SOOO delicious!!!  I didn't have fresh garlic one day and used garlic powder and we liked it better that way!  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely loved it!  Used canned roasted diced tomatoes & added sliced black olives.  Didn't have fresh basil so used dried.  This will surely become a weekly staple for dinner.

I read a lot of the reviews, and maybe I was expecting too much, but this really didn't taste like anything special. That said, my husband really liked it, so it couldn't have been that bad.

This recipe is excellent! Five stars all the way! It's easy to make,and has a short shopping list of ingredients. It may sound cliche, but put a bite in your mouth and you'll receive a burst of delicious flavor! Also, you could probably make in the oven instead of on the grill if necessary. Best Tilapia I've ever had!

This was DELICIOUS!  I made it just like the recipe says, except for I baked it rather than grilled it. (425 for 20-25 minutes as suggested earlier)
My husband and I decided it was "company worthy" and are looking forward to making it for visitors.  Our 9 year old wanted seconds!

Great recipe!  I'm always looking for new ways to make fish of any kind.  I also used a 9x13 pan covered in foil along with a can of Italian style diced tomatoes.  I also increased the garlic to almost 2 cloves per filet.  Magnificent!

This was definately very easy to prepare! I followed some of the other reviewers advice and added mushrooms. Also I chopped the tomatoes, basil, and garlic, covered it with wine and let it marinade for several hours. I did not use the full cup of wine. I omitted the butter and it was light and delicious.

I made this and grilled it. I didn't measure the wine I made the fish in individual packets and just added the right amount of seasonings and wine to each packet. I used fresh tomatoes from my garden as well. It was good.

This was OK. Needed something though... I added lots of lemon before serving. The problem might have been because I used dried basil, not fresh. So I might give it another try with fresh basil because it's easy and healthy. But otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

This was OK. I was expecting more flavor. It needed one more element. maybe lemon?
It has all my favorite ingredients so I thought it would be fantastic. but it fell a little short. I will make again, but might try to use less wine, and maybe some lemon juice. Or Maybe tomato sauce instead of tomato sliced. Tilapia cooks so quickly, I don't think the flavors had enough time to meld together.

This recipe was great!  I used it with some whiting filets I had in my freezer.  My two previous attempts at feeding whiting to my kids (ages 7,4 and 2) had failed.  With this recipe my 7 year old declared this is good and finished her whole plate.  Her 2 year old brother had 4 helpings and the 4 year old reluctantly ate hers when she saw her sister and brother eating.  My husband and I also liked this.  I will try it again with other fish.

my husband loved this! He ranks all food as “not bad” or “bad”. This dish he called “really good”, and he isn’t a big fish eater. I don’t eat fish at all and am hesitant to prepare foods I don’t eat because it makes it difficult to know if it turned out ok. I know he is picky and doesn’t like tomatoes so to make life easy, I used a couple of spoons of tomato paste straight out of a can and mixed with the butter, garlic and wine. Kept the wine from being too “wet” like i read in other reviews. Used foil, put the tilapia fillets down, used the salt and pepper and then slathered the tomato paste mixture on top, chopped up the fresh basil and folded the foil into a packet for the grill. Not about to have a fish smell baking in my kitchen! To make sure the fish didn’t dry out, I poured the rest of the wine called for into the packet and folded the foil closed. Grilled for 15 min like the recipe called for and he ate two fillets!! If you even knew what a big deal this was you would try the recipe, it must be that good! He even asked me to book mark it so I could make it again, I’m a decent cook, but he could care less about food so this is big!

I was only making one filet ( two servings for us) so cut the recipe down. In the foil package I laid down a bed of par boiled green beans and thinly sliced red onion for the fish to rest on because my goal was a one dish meal. I used half butter and half EVOO,  more fresh basil and garlic. Did not have enough wine for me and the dish so substituted broth. Turned out so wonderful served on a bed of Cacio e Pepe. The BF was impressed so I will have to do this again!

I don’t have an outdoor grilll, so I cooked in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes.  Per other reviews I cut the wine in half and added more salt but I still thought it was bland.. I will try again but will add more salt and something else to give it more zing - not sure what yet.

I’m not a fish eater, but my husband and father liked it! There was too much wine sauce, so I’ll halve that if I make it again. But maybe it would have cooked off faster in the grill...we decided it was too cold outside to grill and baked it at 425 for 20 minutes. We did add mushrooms, skipped the salt for dad and added some after cooking for my hubby.  And we used dried basil. I’ll try it on top of pasta sometime, but we are cutting back carbs and sodium in the house right now, so I stuck with just the fish!

I used this recipe but made on the stovetop in a skillet.  I quartered large cherry tomatoes I had on hand, and cooked in a mix of butter and oil.  I cooked the tomatoes a bit, then added 2 chopped cloves of garlic, before putting the fish in the pan.  I used wine and lemon juice to sauce up the tomatoes and added the fresh basil towards the end.  Delicious, will make again, thanks for recipe!!!!

This is the best fish dish I've ever made and I've made lots! I did add some things for my personal likes but it's 5 stars as written! I used half butter half evoo, added lemon zest and juice of half of a lemon, capers, halved cherry tomatoes, & onion slivers. It actually tastes like a Mediterranean dish except for the basil which I'll leave out next time and sub green olives. I followed advice of other reviewers and upped the garlic but it didn't need it. Oopsies. I served with white rice w/ chives and black beans, the sauce on the rice is delish! Bravo to the submitter!

For the ease of preparation , and the versatility, I thought this was a great recipe.. I used dried basil and canned diced tomatoes --since I didn't have fresh.  I added Magic Salmon Seasoning instead of salt & pepper, but we still needed salt after cooking it (so don't forget the salt & pepper ).  Very tasty tilapia resulted...

I also made this recipe with more garlic and seasoned fish with lemon pepper! I cooked it at 425degrees for 25 minutes. It was flavorful!  I served it with garlic green beans which were sautéed  with a small shallot in olive oil. This was a great dinner and very healthy.

I baked this in the oven at 425 degrees for 15-20 min. Did not have fresh basil but dried basil was as good. I bet fresh basil would make  it superb.  Delicious!

Very good, read first reviews and decided to give it a try in the oven.
Baked it at 380 F for 40 min. / 30 min. with alu-foi on top.
Added canned tomatoes (no added salt, basil) on top, added onion rings on top, used a splash of red wine, since that was what I had, added some beau monde seasoning, (has not a lot of salt) some lemon juice, a little drizzle of olive oil, in place of butter, some dried dill, and a few cut-up black olives. Everyone liked it and some added shredded cheese on top, after it was served at table. Served it alongside sweet potato fries, a little horseradish sauce, green beans and red potatoes for the ones, who detest the sweet ones. Thanks!

Lacked in flavor so, I added a homemade mago-pineapple salsa and then it was excellent.  Adding the flavors from the salsa made this an excellent dish.  It is definately an easy dish.

We really loved this tilapia recipe.  Reading all the other reviews about the fish being bland, I used extra garlic, pinot grigio, and I added Tony Chachere seasoning to each filet (could use Emerils seasoning, too).  I baked it in the oven in a foil pouch.  Delicious!

I liked this but it was too bland - needs more garlic, salt, pepper. Easy modifications--doubled the garlic and tomato,  add lots of salt and pepper and a splash of fresh lemon juice, sprinkled fish with dried basil rather than basil leaves . Bake in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes in 9x13 covered tightly with foil.

I don't understand all of the positive reviews or what I could be doing wrong. I find this to be very bland. I made it twice. First time, followed the recipe with a little less butter and canned tomatoes, pino grigio and baked it. Second time, sauteed some portabella and onions with garlic, used much more salt and pepper, doubled the garlic, quadrupled the basil, used a fresh tomato, chardonnay and broiled. It's rather shocking how flavorless it is with so many great ingredients. Still wasn't enough salt. Squeezed fresh lemon on top, which helped but still, not tasty.

Wonderful!   Flavorful, easy and healthy.  Followed recipe almost exactly - just added extra garlic and only 1/2 cup of wine.  Also added some feta cheese just before serving.  Served with orzo, to absorb the delicious sauce, and broccoli.  Will definitely be making again.

followed recipe exactly except for grilling. put in oven on 350 for 20min.  It was amazing and so easy.  Hubby doesn't like fish and really liked this dish.  The tomatoes are perfect and the whole thing was flavorful.  When they were done I topped it of with shredded parmigiana cheese.  Will do again.  thanks for sharing.

Delish!  I might add a little more salt and pepper, or a few more tomatoes since tilapia is a mild taste.  Also, since I don't have a grill, I followed the directions to a tee, then baked at 350 in the oven...about 15 minutes.  Served with brown rice. Yum.

I only used half of the wine and it was still wayyyyy too much. This was the only change I made.. I think it needs more flavor somehow - maybe cheese?

Excellent recipe!  I followed it almost exactly as written, except made it with two fillets, using one large clove of garlic for each fillet and 1 large tomato split between the two fillets.  It was cooked to perfection in 15 minutes and tasted wonderfully fresh (garlic, basil and tomato were all fresh from our garden!). It was quick and easy and I would definitely make it again!

I commute to the city and I dont have time to cook butt his recipe is a saver. It takes 20 min. I do not use grill I put the fish in the oven on 375 F for 15 min and it is still very yammy. My husband and son love it and I am happy I dont have to be stuck in the kitchen after a very long day.

This one was just "ok".....it needed a lot more spice.  It was good and light and very easy to make...I just need to be a little heavier handed when it comes to the spices.

This was very good, although I did add more basil, some onions, lemon and a few leaves of sage (because I had it). Next time I'll also use a little less wine. Will definitely make it again, though, and maybe add some peppers as well.

Fantastic! Flavor was mild, but very tasty! Paired it with couscous and broccoli. Next time I will add more tomatoes.

WOW I just made this for dinner.. absolutely delicious, and so simple. I also cooked at 425 in the oven for 25 min but than I put it on 450 for an additional 10 minutes only because  my stove doesn't get as hot as it used to. I only had cooking white wine so I used that. but other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  Next time I will be making a double batch because it is already gone and my boyfriend wants more!! Def a keeper thanks for posting!!

This is truly a delicious tilapia recipe.  I served it with pasta primavera, which is perfect for Spring.  Since I believe too much white wine was used for the tilapia recipe, I added some of it to the pasta primavera.

This recipe was delicious!  It was our first grill recipe of the year.  We used frozen (thawed) tilapia and it was great.  No fishy taste.

Appreciate that it is quick and easy, but the fish is bland and tasteless.  I followed the recipe and doubled my seasonings, but the fish still ended up not tasting like anything except tilapia.  I should have reduced my wine as other reviews suggested.

excellent and easy. used olive oil and a can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano. did not drain it. i think i should have. i minced the garlic just because i forgot that the recipe said to press the cloves! (computer is in next room over from the kitchen!) also covered in foil and baked in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes as well. dish was extremely tasty but the fish, while wonderfully moist, was still too moist for my husband and me. next time, maybe i should ditch the foil and bake it uncovered?!

We did not like this at all.  I gave two stars because we didn't follow the recipe exactly, otherwise, I would probably give only 1 star.  I followed the suggestions of many and cooked in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes, wrapped individually in foil.  I also increased the garlic, basil, and tomatoes and halved the wine (I used pinot grigio) as many reviewers suggested.  However, this was still a soggy mess without much flavor.  It was extremely bland.  I think grilling would improve it because it might add some flavor.  However, wrapped in foil with the wine, it would likely still be a soggy mess  Our kids love tilapia, but did not like this recipe either.  I was so disappointed since this recipe has been so highly rated.  I definitely will not make this again.

Made this with Whitefish and omitted the butter to lower the calories. Fabulous tasting!! Poaching the fish in white wine adds a nice flavour.

I was in a hurry so I poached this like I do mussels and it was fantastic. I did not go shopping, so I used fresh garlic, olive oil and generous portion of basil from the tube instead of fresh- a quick, easy and delicious treat. I would do this for a quick company dinner which we do often and spontaneously after work.

It was definitely easy but I found it to be a little bland. I followed the recipe except for adding a little lemon. And I cooked the foil packet in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes as someone else had suggested. I think I would use this technique again but try different flavors next time.

Yummy and light dish!  I baked mine in the oven at 400 for about 20mins and used a small drizzle of olive oil on my filets instead of butter.  Used both basil and roma tomatoes that I grew.  Easy and quick, paired nicely with steamed broc - and low cal too!

I thought this wasn't bad but I didn't think it was fantastic. It's a fast and easy way to prepare some tilapia but I can think of a lot more flavorful ways fix it. I might make it again for myself and tweak the recipe a bit but if I was having company I probably wouldn't opt to use this recipe.

Quite good.  I used grape tomatoes, which I chopped in a food processor with a half an onion and the basil.  I'm a huge fan of the sweetness of grape tomatoes, and it went very well with the grape tomatoes.  I used a Riesling, which seemed a good choice.  Also, I baked this in the oven at 450 for about 30 minutes; 20 minutes was not long enough.

I made this on the grill with a few slight variations based on what I had in the house. I used canned tomatoes with basil and I think that made a difference. My husband and my kids agreed that this recipe is a keeper! It was delicious!

This was SOOOOOOO bland and I even added extra basil and garlic.  I was really looking forward to this but it was a huge disappointment!  There are so many other recipes on this website for tilapia that are A LOT better.  Sorry.

The family snarfed it down including our 2y/o son.  I'm not a fish person, so it was only so-so to me.  I didn't use the butter and used olive oil instead, doubled the garlic and tomatoes, and used red onion.  Really easy and quick!

This is a great recipe, if a little lacking in flavor. I couldn't grill it, so I put the tilapia in a glass casserole dish, topped with aluminum foil, and baked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. I also doubled the tomato, didn't have basil so I substituted bay leaves, and added crumbled feta cheese on top.  It was a good dish, but it could have used a little something. I'm definitely going to use basil next time to see if it makes it better, and most importantly, I'll add some lemon. I feel that whenever fish tastes a little bland, it could use some lemon. My mate and I enjoyed it though, so I'll try to see if I can make it a 5 star meal next time.

This was so easy and it tasted amazing!!! I am very pleased with how this turned out.  I did change it up slightly, rather than grilling it I baked it in the oven at 425F for approximately 20 minutes covered with foil.  As for the garlic, I shredded it and spread it directly on the fish, and I used dried basil as that was all I had!  Again this was a really go recipe!

This was excellent, fresh and healthy!  My family of teenagers loved it.  I added fresh spinach and feta cheese before baking in the oven at 400 for 20-25 mins.  It is very filling and good!!

Cooked recipe as is. It was very good and it was a hit with the family. I added a side of steamed broccoli and brown rice. For the brown rice I cooked it in vegetable broth and added some chopped onions, garlic and all seasoning, my own way to flavor up the rice. Healthy & YUMMMMY...

Wow this recipe was DELICIOUS!  Planned to add lemon juice but forgot so prepared exactly as written, except I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried.  Will use fresh next time.  I can't wait to make this again!

This is INCREDIBLE.
I had some very fresh fish -- so that probably helped.
I made the recipe EXACTLY as stated (I prefer to make a recipe as written before making changes).  I will definitely be making this again -- exactly the same way.
YUM.  Even my li'l ones ate this up!

After salt & pepper on the tilapia, I preped the topping in a saucepan. Melted butter, added 4T chopped onion, 1 sm can of mushrooms caps (halved), 1/4 tsp Tarragon, and decreased the wine to 1/2 cup. Topped the fish & grilled.  I doubled the foil on top & bottom to avoid leaking. This was great, easy, and healthy. Neighbors raved about it.

I rated this recipe with 5 stars because not only was is super easy and quick, but it was also the first time I've had tilapia and truely loved it! I scaled this recipe down to serve only one...me! I made a foil pouch filled with one tilapia, and lots of salt, pepper, garlic, and basil. I also sauted portabella mushrooms in butter and wine and added them to the pouch. I poured wine over everthing and baked in the oven for 30 minutes on 350 degrees! It was absolute wonderful! I will make this time and time again!

I reduced this recipe to feed 2 and baked it at 425 for 20 minutes-- it was a tad overcooked so I'll reduce the time next time.  Otherwise, the flavors compliment the fish well, i'll make it again.

I didn't follow the exact recipe, but noticed the topping was similar to bruchetta so I made a simple batch of that which contained chopped tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic cloves, onion, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I put the butter on the tilapia pieces as the recipe says along with the wine, which I cut down on a little as others had. I loved it! My husband thought it wasn't quite as flavorful as it could be, but his piece didn't have as much topping on it as mine. The more topping, the better! With my changes, I'd give it 5 stars, but I'm guessing it would be a little more blah without the changes. Excellent base recipe though!

This recipe was wonderful. I used dried basil and low fat margarine and it turned and baked it at 425 for 20 minutes in a 9x13 baking pan. Turned out just fine. Will definitely use this one again!

This is a great recipe, however I've made some changes after cooking it a few times. I add marinated, quartered artchoke hearts with some of the oil from the jar and use tomatoes from a can of diced tomatoes.

Wonderful, flavorful, healthy! I skipped the wine (Didn't have any, shame on me!) and it came out wonderful nonetheless. I used fresh basil from our patio garden and and grape tomatoes. It was perfect! I made a pasta side dish with the same ingredients (garlic, basil, tomatoes, butter) and it was a great complement. Add lemon juice and freshly ground pepper at the end to the fish and the side pasta dish for a wonderful finish.

The recipe was a quick fix to our tilapia we were cooking.  It wasn't quite as flavorful as we expected, but still tasty.

Very good. I modified by making it on the stove (ran out of foil), used a can of diced tomatoes and no wine (had none on hand). Also added a splash of lemon juice. Very yummy and my kids ate it too - always gets an extra star for that!

This is the second recipe I've used off this site for making Tilapia but this one by far the best ever! From first bite to last it was great and it was also so easy to make! My hubby couldn't stop talking about how great it was for the entire meal! It was great - I will be making this very soon in the near future!

I loved this recipe!  I had to substitute oregeno and parsley for the basil, but it still was delicious!  I also followed the recommended 20 mins at 400 degrees in the foil in the oven and it worked marvelously! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

I make Talapia a few times per month and this is a good addition to the fish line up. I will add some more spice, maybe garlic or Old Bay, we are used to spicy...very good recipie, especially once I get it spiced up a bit...a keeper

I made this recipe with the addition of onions and portobello mushrooms.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried.  This was one of the most delicious fish recipes I've tried.  Hubby and I even debated about how much it would cost in a restaurant!

This is a beautiful, tasty way to prepare tilapia.  I covered the fish with thin slices of lemon and squeezed juice over it; used petite diced tomatoes.  Very good served with rice.

This is a good basic recipe but it needs some additional flavor. I recommend adding some onions to the packet and definitely add some lemon. I had one piece left over that I sauted for lunch the next day and it turned out even better, I just added a little lemon pepper to it before throwing it in the pan.

Easy is the word.  The flavor was nice.  Easy clean-up so it makes for a great weeknight meal.  I baked the foil packet at 425 for 20 minutes although I think grilling might be the better option.

I decided to bake this for 15 minutes at 425. It smelt absolutely amazing while it cooked! We used minced garlic and diced tomatoes from a can. I couldn't have asked for more from a quick & easy recipe like this.

This came out great! I am always looking for new things to do with fish because my husband isn't the biggest fan, but we both loved this. I used a little less wine as recommended, but it was still very moist and flavorful.

Made exactly per the recipe, but we didn't care for the flavor.  Also, trying to put that much fluid in aluminum foil without spilling all over is a challenge.

I was looking for something to do w/this fish that wouldn't take too much away from the fish itself.  Just wanted to "dress it up" a bit. This recipe was perfect. I used cooking wine instead of regular wine but I don't think it made a difference.  They turned out very nicely on the grill and my 12-year old daughter just raved about them!

Even my very picky tweener liked this, with bananas, oddly enough (but without any topping). I made a few changes...first, I forgot the wine, but it didn't matter, since the broth was excellent without it. I used a drained can of petite diced tomatoes and sprinkled dried basil, plus I had 5 filets and used 3 T. of margarine--what I had on hand--then covered it and baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. The guys drank the leftover broth like it was soup.

Great recipe - doesn't take long to prepare.  Best part is - you can make extra and just microwave, still is as moist and tasty as it comes off the grill!

This was so good and very yummy!  I used cooking wine instead of white wine, and I added a little bit of parm. cheese.  My son gave it a thumbs up.  I grilled it like the recipe said and couldn't believe how easy it was!  Thanks!

This was amazing!! I used breaded Tilapia fillets and it still tasted great! Next time I will spray foil, because I had some sticking problems, but over all a delicious and beautiful recipe!

Well, this was good, but not great.  I used sherry rather than white wine and because of some other comments stating that it was bland, I added lemon pepper to the seasonings the recipe calls for as well as some chopped green onions along with the tomatoes.  Still pretty bland and boring.  
It is however, a really quick and easy recipe, and with a little doctoring up, I'll make it again.  Maybe I'll add some seasoned salt or Italian seasoning next time.  It's hard to go too terribly wrong with Tilapia.

This recipe was a great idea. But for those of you whol like more flavor...the salt pepper seasoning just won't cut it. I always spruce up my recipes by adding more seasoning. And the result was AMAZING!...I scratched out the salt and pepper and added my own touch, keeping the wine, butter, tomatoes, etc... if you want my ideas just let me know... ;-)

I made this last night and it's nothing special. My husband and I like tilapia which is a good thing because that was the only thing we could taste. I used fresh garlic, basil, lemon juice, real butter, plus all the recommended wine. Since Tilapia is a real mild fish, I think that's why everyone else liked this recipe because to us it didn't taste like we did anything to it. (except the garlic and basil smelled real good while cooking). I won't make this again.

Not bad but far from spectacular.  Followed recipe exactly.  Wanted to like it and expected too since it was so highly rated but I think I'll keep looking for a better tilapia recipe.

This was so easy - to make AND to clean up after!  I was out of wine, so I used lemon juice (just a nice heavy squirt, not a whole cup!) and I used dried basil instead of fresh.  The fish was moist, flavorful and everyone raved about it (kids included).  I highly recommend this - especially when you don't want to heat up your house and fill the sink w/dishes!

Thought this was a pretty good recipe.  I meant to add some fresh lemon juice but forgot, and I topped it with salsa instead of the tomatoes.  My picky husband said it was good.  I'll probably make it again but play with the recipe a little to add more flavor.

This was really good and easy! I didn't pay attention to measurements, (as usual) I just piled it all on and added to the tomatoes and garlic some soy sauce. I used my George Forman because we have no grill. Husband said it needed a little more salt but he says this about everything. Will use this method of cooking with other delicate fish.

Due to lack of bbq I had to cook this one in the oven, but it was still incredible. Be sure to use good tin foil, I had some trouble with the cheap stuff breaking and leaking wine everywhere!

I had really high hopes for this recipe because I love fish + tomatoes.  I used fresh garden tomatoes and fresh basil I had grown.  Regretably, it was very bland.  I thought the combo on butter, white wine, garlic would be delish. It was very quick and easy.  I will keep searching for a good  fish/tomato recipe.
