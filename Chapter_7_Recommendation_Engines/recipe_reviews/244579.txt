Juicy asparagus thanks to being cooked in Swanson Veggie Broth! Goat cheese and lemon are perfect compliments. I will be making this again and again!

This was really good! The goat cheese was a great finishing touch, and the vegetable broth added a nice layer of subtle flavor. Will definitely make this again!
