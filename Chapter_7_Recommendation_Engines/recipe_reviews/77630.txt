These came out well. I do think it needs more than a tablespoon of glitter realistically though! Thanks for the recipe :) EDIT 5/11/11: I also ran out of white chocolate before I ran out of PB balls, but I thought it was just me. Another user had the same issue, so I'd melt a full pound of white chocolate next time.

These are sooooo good and very easy to make! They were a hit with my family! I couldn't find edible glitter so I used sprinkles.

fantastic, i made the peanut butter in about 5 mins in my kitchen aid mixer the hardest part was rolling the balls.  these turned out super creamy and perfectly sweet.

This was my 2nd time making pb balls (the 1st was a disaster!) and EVERYONE loved them! They were a little difficult to cover but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty fun. The white chocolate/shortening mix gets really thick as cools but it seemed to be easier to cover the balls once it had cooled a little bit. I melted the chips/shortening in a double boiler (over Med heat, stirring frequently- then constantly once most were melted) and then took the pot and the chilled pb balls to my dining room table to "dip." I used a regular spoon and my fingers to cover the balls in chocolate. I did run out of chocolate, though, and had about 10 pb balls left over... Next time I'll add a little more chocolate chips. Lots of work but the end result is AMAZING. This is a Christmas keeper!

This recipe was just great!  It was like peanut butter fudge dipped in chocolate.  We used white and milk chocolate and both of them were really good.  They are really rich though, so if you don't like peanut butter you might want to try something else.
