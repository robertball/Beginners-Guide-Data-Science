This is really good.  Make sure you have 2 boxes of stuffing mix as this is the amount you will need.  I used 2 cups of grated mild hot pepper cheese and also increased the onion to 1/3 cup.  I also added a little fresh lemon juice to sauce to zip it up a little. I will definetly make this again.  Fresh cooked green beans go well with this.

Really disappointed.  This came out more like a salmon bread crumb dressing.  Need LESS bread and MORE salmon in the filling.

I was very dissapointed, this is the first recipe from this website that was horrible.  It had entirely too much bread in it, just didn't taste good at all.  Sorry.

I found the crust to be unneccessary, and the topping, although tasty is optional.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe, though next time I will spice up the tomato sauce a little more.

This was "okay."  I did add some mixed vegatables to the pie and skipped the sauce (cornstrach, water, and tomatos just doesn't sound appealing).  I think the herb/salmon pairing just wasn't the best.  We ate it, but I prefer salmon patties, if I'm going to be cooking canned salmon.
