5.8.18  After mixing the croquette mixture together, I put it in the fridge to chill for about 10 minutes, making it easier to roll into balls.  I used a 1-3/4” cookie scoop and ended up with 13 balls.  The recipe lists 1/2 cup milk on one line and 2 Tbsp milk below (usually on one line when listing ingredients), so I assumed the croquettes  were supposed to have all of that milk mixed in.  They were a little difficult to shape into balls, and in the future, I might try eliminating that extra 2 Tbsp milk.  I used Panko bread crumbs, and after breading, I put them back into the refrigerator to firm up before frying.  I just held my breath when I dropped the first one into the hot oil, thankfully, it didn’t disintegrate.  The overall flavor is pretty mild, and I thought the dill was totally lost, even after doubling that.  I know moving forward I won’t spring $2.25 to buy a pkg of fresh dill; I’ll either omit it or use dry (probably try the latter).  Would suggest you don’t chop your shrimp too small (I think I may have today), so you get a nice pop of that succulent shrimp when you bite into the croquette.  Fair number of ingredients, but this really is pretty easy to make.  I firmly believe you need a dipping sauce for this recipe, and I used Creole Marmalade Sauce, also on this site.  Thanks for sharing your recipe ZAYO, I don’t deep fry often, but this was worth the effort.
