To make your own teriyaki marinade sauce, mix together 1 (6 oz) can of pineapple juice, 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar and 1/4 cup of soy sauce in a saucepan and cook until the sugar is dissolved.
With wire whisk, whip in 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1 dash of celery salt (to taste); continue cooking until well mixed. Allow to cool before using.

I absolutely love to cook and do a lot of it, which is the one an only reason I consider myself an experienced cook.  The problem with being an experienced cook, is that there don't seem to be many surprises left, whether it be recipes I find, or even the restaurants my husband and I frequent. HOWEVER, this chicken dish, is truly one of the best I've ever eaten! The different ingredients flavored this dish beautifully and it is certainly elegant enough for a dinner party. Thank you Leigh; it's a winner at our house!

Very nice recipe, Leigh! I wasn't too sure at first as to how this combination of ingredients would fly, but as others have already said, all of the flavors complimented eachother and the results were delicious. I used a lot more cheese, and I had to use a red pepper instead of a green. Served with buttered egg noodles and lots of parm. Thank you.

The recipe looked inviting to me except for the fact that neither Hubs nor I are fans of teriyaki marinades.  Marinating the chicken breasts in a Lemon Dijon Vinaigrette was a better fit for us.  I find baking boneless chicken breasts at a higher temperature keeps them tender and moist, so after baking them for 20 minutes at 400 degrees, I topped them with the vegetables and just a little shredded mozzarella (we didn’t want a whole lot of cheese on the chicken) and returned them to the oven briefly, just long enough to melt the cheese. Nice recipe – we really enjoyed it!

Mmmmmm, this dish was great!  I used stir fry sauce instead of teriyaki because I thought it would be too sweet.  I used turkey bacon and pepper jack cheese.  I also marinated the chicken in the stir fry sauce overnight.  I served the chicken with pan-fried asparagus, and it was a big hit.  There were no leftovers at all.

This includes a lot of steps, but it worth it.  I didn't really think that the teriyaki sauce blended with the other flavors, esp. the bacon. Next time I will omit the teriyaki marinade, eliminating a lot of time too and I think it will be better!

This is extremely delicious and the recipe works just as it is written.  The only modification I made was to omit the butter used to sautee the onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms (believe me you do not need the butter) and I cooked it for an extra ten minutes. I will say that this is an extremely filling meal and probably should be prepared for a groups of very hungry people.  I mean, it has bacon, cheese, chicken - it is rich and hearty.  But very delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This had such great flavors. The only drawback that I had with this recipe was that the bacon and butter made for a very rich and heavy taste. I think that if I make it again I will omit the butter. The house LOVED it simply because there was bacon with the chicken. Thanks!!

This was awesome. My whole family loved it. The only thing I did different was omit the mushrooms because we are not mushroom lovers. Definately the best dish I have made in a while.

I used turkey bacon, no butter, incl onions and mushrooms, omitted bell pepper and added onions. also used BBQ sauce to marinate instead of teriyaki. It was delicious. Very flavorful and juicy. I love it and can't wait to cook it again. Just as tasty and way healthier than Chili's.

I was looking for a recipe for Monterey chicken like the one I had at Chilis.  Well I found that one and this one.  My husband chose this one for me to make and I am so glad that I did.  This was absolutely even better than the one at Chilis.   I had to replace the onion for onion powder since the last onion I had was bad on the inside.  Looked and felt fine on the outside.  This didn't diminish the recipe in the least.  I also left out the mushrooms.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks again for the recipe.

The family gave this one 5 stars!  They loved it, as did I.  I would have never thought to combine these flavors, but they worked wonderfully.  I loved the sweet and salty effect of the teriyaki marinade and the fresh vegetables.  I ended up grilling the chicken instead of baking it, but that is the only change I made.  This will definitely be a keeper in my house!

This was awesome and didn't take as much time as I expected. I saved some time by using a 30 minute marinade too.

Delicious supper!  I substituted red peppers for the mushrooms as we are not a mushroom family.  Rather than use the butter, I sauted the veggies in 2 TB of bacon fryings.  Also used swiss cheese because that is what I had in slices.  This was delicious and I know we will be having this one again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It was good, but you need to bake the chicken for 40-45 minutes at 350.  The bacon made it very savory, and I think next time I am going to try it with a BBQ marinade instead.

I made this for dinner last night, but went about it a little differently.  First Hubs grilled our chicken rather than putting it in the oven.  Once it was cooked through, we added the cheese and continued to grill until it was just melted.  While the chicken was cooking, I cooked the bacon, cooled and crumbled it.  I then wiped out the pan and sautéed my veggies.  I used a mix of green, red and yellow bell peppers for added color.  I topped the cooked chicken with the veggie combination and sprinkled it with the bacon.  Yes, we used a little different method and assembled it a little differently, but the result was very good!  I think Hubs liked this one more than I did.  He thought it was excellent, while I thought it was good, so 4 1/2 stars from us.  Update: 3/1/12 - I made this again the same way, but this time neither one of us was crazy about it.  I thought the soy flavor really dominated even though I used a leading brand of teriyaki marinade.  This time it was more of a 3 star recipe.

a few more steps involved than i thought, but it was totally worth it. my entire family loved it! i did, however, change the marinade from teriaki to mrs dash's zesty garlic herb marinade and it was amazing. served it with butter noodles and garlic-bacon broccoli.

This recipe is AWESOME!  What great flavor!  Only had thick chicken (which I normally don't like) and yellow peppers and had no mushrooms.  Made one batch with added chopped jalapenos and monterrey jack (I like spicy) and one batch without.  Both were terrific.  So excited for leftovers tomorrow.

Love all the ingredients - just wasn't that excited about the end result. Chicken was a bit dry - whole dish was a bit dry. This was edible, but won't make again.

Very very good.  Didnt add the teriyaki (didnt have any), so used Worchestshire insteaad.  Other than that, followed other directions.  I dont like green peppers but the flavor combination was delish.  My boyfriend, loved it.

This was fantastic! I marinated the chicken a bit longer than two hours and diluted to take away some of the salty taste.  I sauteed the veggies in bacon grease as everyone recommended and it was perfect. I also cooked the chicken breasts a bit longer because they were so large.  I added two slices of cheese to each one since the breasts were so big.  This was totatlly delicious in every way.  I will make over and over again.

This was great!  I omitted the peppers because we don't like them and used boneless thighs instead of breasts.  I used Ken's teriyaki marinade.  It was pretty easy to make, though a little time-consuming.  We loved the mix of flavors.  I would definitely make it again.

Great company dinner - Made this last night for a dinner party - my guests raved about it!  My sister's husband liked it so much that she called for the recipe this morning - I used mostly red bell pepper - chunked them and the onions instead of cutting into strips and used shredded mozzarella.  In addition to the skinless, boneless breasts, I threw in a few chicken thighs and wings - and marinaded all a little longer because it fit my time frame better - served it with garlic mashed potatoes - yum! It's a keeper, my hubby loved it too it will scale down easily for just the two of us.

Loved it!  Only made one change and used sliced mushrooms instead of chopping them.  This was so easy to make and would be great to serve to guests.  Only ate a small piece of chicken because I gorged myself on the veggies.

That hit the spot!!! I was in a pinch for time and did not have any teriakyi marinade, however I did have BBQ sauce. I just lathered the sauce on the chicken and put in the oven. Then I just threw the cooked bacon/veggies on the chicken, topped it with Cheddar, baked for 5min, and it turned out perfect!!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you for a great recipe. I was getting tired of the same old chicken.

This was OK.  Next time I make it I won't use teriyake sauce.  I didn't think it really went well with the other flavors.  I might also try montery jack cheese instead of mozzarella.

My husband really liked it if you called it something besides Monterrey chicken. This was definitely not a Mexican dish. I didn't really like it. The teriyaki was too dominant and the various flavors didn't really blend well. Sorry. I really wanted to like it since the picture is so pretty (it really does look like that) and Chicken Monterrey is one of our favorite meals at our local Mexican restaurant.

We crumbled the bacon to make it easier to eat and made our own teriyaki sauce to cut back in sodium and sugar. It was delicious!

I loved everything about this recipe! It was flavorful along with the veggies and mushrooms. Cant go wrong with this one. I followed it to a tee and it was perfect! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and used some of the sauce that was made with the veggies and drizzled a little bit on the potatoes. The only thing I would change is the cook time after you put the veggies and cheese on. I popped it back in the oven for only about 7 minutes not the whole 15-20. I felt like everything was perfectly cooked after the 7 minutes. It might have been overdone if I waited the whole 15-20 minutes. I will definitely be making this again!

My family loved this recipe.  I flattened the chicken breasts just a bit, then grilled them on my George Foreman grill, making sure they weren't quite done.  Then I topped them and put them in the oven for 5-8 min.  They we're perfect!

I found that I didn't need even a half cup of marinade to cover four chicken breast halves.  I did use a homemade teriyaki sauce instead of the thinner marinade sauce at the grocery store.  I'm a bit concerned that it doesn't mention saving any marinade to pour over the veggies.  Marinade should NOT be re used.

This was AMAZING!!!!!! The mixture of sweet and salty was incredible, it works so well together. I only changed it a little ( this is too good a recipe to tamper too much with!!) I marinated the chicken over night ans added more cheese. But this is such a great dinner with mashed potato's it is now a regular meal for us!! Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!    Sarah

Mother's Day guests loved it!  I used a "Ginger Teriyaki 30-minute" marinade, and my husband grilled the chicken for me ahead of time.  I didn't use green peppers--no fan of them, and I didn't chop the mushrooms.. just used the pre-sliced. The rest of the recipe procedures were executed as written.  VERY good, and we'll definitely do it again!!

I am a vegetarian, but I do cook meat for friends and family. I am always wary of this because I can't taste it while cooking, but my bf went NUTS over this recipe. So did my best friend. I followed the recipe but I doubled it. I doubled it w/out adding more of the mushroom mixture and it was still plenty for 8 chicken breast halves. So according to my taste testers, it is delicious.

This was the best chicken dish I've made in a long, long time.  It was so tasty! I used a bit of bacon grease instead of butter to saute the onion and bell pepper, wow!  I served this with fresh green beans and a side of pierogi.  Thank you for this recipe!

*** My family liked this recipe. It had good flavor, but I was expecting something alittle more exciting. I did not deviate from the recipe other than pounding the bonless chicken breast to the same height for ease of cooking.The chicken is flavorful and the  onions, mushrooms ect are tasty, but it just didn't wow me. My family did think it would taste great between bread in a grilled melt sort of thing.

Lots of yummy things added to make this dinner. It smelled so good....and didn't take long at all to prepare. Can't make a fair judgement...I do have a cold...BUT everyone said it was good....they liked it. I thought the chicken was a little tough. Even though I had marinated it. Other then being a little tough...it WAS a tasty dish.

I made this for dinner tonight and I loved it It was tender with lovely flavors. My S.O.thought it had too much onion but I loved the sweetness. Will cértainly make again and reduce the amount of onion. Wonderful  recipe! Thanks so much!

Hearty and delicious! Could easily serve 6. Marinated a bit longer (3.5 hours) but then followed the recipe exactly. Served over rice with a side of broccoli. Yum!

Turned out fantastic! I followed the recipe, with the exception that I needed a little more teriyaki sauce because I didn't reserve any (missed that instruction) so I made some new teriyaki sauce that used orange juice instead of pineapple juice for the veggies and it turned out wonderfully! For all of those who think the teriyaki seems weird addition -teriyaki is not simply an Asian sauce-  it is a very basic flavoring combo (sweet, salty, tangy) that goes in a lot of recipes so I recommend trying it the original way before omitting it and replacing it with a different marinade. I had a house full of teenagers and every one of them loved it. Also, all the adults loved it and even the children loved it. Thanks!

Loved it, and even more importantly hubby is already asking for it again!  I know everyone hates when someone deviates from a recipe but after cooking my bacon, I did drain some of the grease but used the rest to sauté my onions, etc.  Just adds more flavor in my opinion but probably not the healthiest!

I would make it again.  I had to make some changes because it is -50F with the windchill here today and I haven't been able to get groceries delivered for a while now.  I had to use canned mushrooms instead of fresh and I used swiss cheese.  Yummy.

Terrific change of pace chicken recipe.  I made only minor changes:  used precooked bacon that I crisped in the micro and crumbled on top of the cheese and made my own teriyaki marinade (pineapple juice, brown sugar, low sodium soy sauce, grated ginger, minced garlic). And used multi colored peppers.

This is a delicious recipe and certainly company good.  I had enough teriyaki sauce on hand for marinade but not enough for the sauce to go on the vegetables so I made some from the review regarding making it from scratch.  It turned out great so many thanks for the review.  Can’t wait to have guests to make it.  It was yummy.  I love All Recipes and use it on a regular basis.

Absolutely loved it just the way it was. Was unsure at first of the teriyaki marinade but it actually went well with the chicken. The only addition I made was fresh cracked black pepper into the vegetable sauté.
Hubby asked that it be added to the regular rotation of meals so I’d say it’s a hit.

This is a very good recipe.   My wife loved it and my hero status is in tact.  I marinated the chicken for an entire day rather than the 1 to 2 hours it calls for.   I also used shredded Mozerella instead of the slices.  I used 1 oz per slice and it was plenty of cheese.

Yummy, this is very good. Only one tiny change I might make. Next time I think I will pound the chicken just a bit to make it flat so the toppings stay on better. I often keep cooked bacon in the freezer and I had some when I made this recipe. Cut down on the work but it would be worth cooking bacon at the same time because it is very good and would be worth it.

This was incredible! The only changes I made was replacing mushrooms with extra peppers because my hubby doesn’t like them, and I added a table spoon of minced garlic to the onions and peppers.

I used a tray of thighs and put them in my InstantPot with the marinade and pressure cooked for 5 mins. ( the chicken was done!). Then I turned the pot on warm for 6 hrs. Then I sauteed the peppers, onion, and mushroom. Put it all together and in my convection oven till the cheese melted. Yummy

This is another recipe that when you read it doesn't sond like it should work, but it was pleasantly surprising.  Made it mostly as written, though I made my own teriyaki and added red bell pepper to the mix.  I'll definitely make it again, but may dial down the sweetness in the teriyaki a little, or punch it up with something savory for balance.  Served it this time with what's becoming a go-to side dish for me; Fettucine with sweet pepper cayenne sauce

The result exceeded expectations - I had to try it when I saw the photo.  I did substitute jalapeños for the pepper and used portobellos for the mushrooms.    Was also good as a leftover.

This wasn't a complicated recipe, but the finished product had a wonderful depth of flavor!  The recipe doesn't tell you to reserve 1/3rd cup of the marinade, so don't use all of it when you initially prepare the chicken :)

I will try this again, when I don't have an interruption in my day.  My chicken was marinating, then I got called away to a two-hour event.  By the time I got home, it was late and I hurried through the process.  Burnt the bacon, but used it anyway.  Loved all the sautéed veggies.  I sliced my mozzarella too thick.  I will make a very thin slice next time or I'll use a shredded product.  The flavors were good.

I made this for my family last night.  It was delicious!  The only thing I would do next time is crumble the bacon.  I think that would be neater and work better, also I'm thinking I may carmelize the onions first, as I love the flavor of the carmelizing.  This recipe is delicious as is, but I would love to experiment with different sauces too.  The flavors on this recipe do work so well together, as other reviewers have stated.  The chicken came out tender and juicy!  This would be great with avocado slices too!  I am always looking for new ways to do chicken breasts, and this recipe was a winner!  Thanks Leigh!

This recipe sounded great but did not turn out that well for us.  I followed the recipe exactly. The combination of teriyaki sauce and bacon was odd and my family just thought the melange of flavours in this  dish was “strange” :(

Substitute butter for coconut oil (and no it doesn't taste like coconuts but it's healthier!!!) and substitute provolone cheese for Mozz. It's a better flavor combined with the suggestive vegetable toppings. Also a little easier on stomach

Very similar to a favorite dish that  was discontinued at a popular restaurant, I love this recipe! It is easy and relatively quick. I don't understand reviews saying it is too involved... I marinate overnight. Plan ahead, marinate 24 hours, prep to cook & serve. 

First, make sure to pierce chicken with a fork or knife to allow marinade to penetrate deeper flavor. (Also helps the chicken cook more evenly.)  Fridge for 24 hours, flipping once mid-way to coat all equally.

I'm not fond of mushrooms, but cooking  veggies in bacon grease leftover only enhances the flavor. So don't rinse the pan- reuse it for the veggies after the bacon.  Minus mushrooms- leaving fungus out doesn't detract from the dish at all. ;) 

I agree with another review stating 20 minutes at 400 degrees is what produces the perfect cooked, moist & flavorful. Up the temp & adjust the time. Then add toppings, switch oven to broil, return to oven & frequently check for slightly bubbling cheese as the cue to done.

I was disappointed in this recipe, was expecting more from it, from the reviews.

Only thing I omitted was the butter, for sauteing the veggies, didn't need it.

Probably would be better as a sandwich, as one reviewer stated, as it tasted like a standard Chicken Philly sub.

Certainly, won't make  it, again, as a main dish.

These flavors worked great together and it was easy to leave the peppers and onions off the kids portions. I think next time to meld the flavors more and save time I’ll bake the bacon in the oven, cube and stir fry the chicken over the stove with olive oil and some garlic, adding some teriyaki sauce at the end, mix the vegetables, chicken and crumbled bacon together and serve with the cheese on top. This would be delicious served on toasted French bread as an open-faced sandwich.

Tasted ok & may make again with my changes. Depending on size of chicken breast, you may want to use less bacon, onion, mushroom, pepper. I had way to much & the stuff didn't begin to stay on the top of the chicken breast. If I make again I'll reduce the amount of the cooked mixture for sure. I ended up with most of the mixture in the pan & I had used a couple of good size chicken breasts. I also marinated the chicken for close to 3 hours & it wasn't enough. Hubby said he couldn't even taste the teriyaki flavor.  Think I'd do for 6 hours for sure.  I'd try an avoid leaving it overnight.

Pretty good. I accidentally added the teriyaki sauce to the chicken in the dish then baked it. I think I added too much. Otherwise it was good. I served over rice pilaf. First time I went to make it I forgot to marinate chicken for a few hours so I had to do it the next night. I marinated chicken for 8 plus hours and it definitely had flavor.

I love this recipe and it can be used so many ways to take chicken over the top.  You could do it with a Mexican theme , Italian theme, oriental theme or just good ole american theme.  I am doing it tonite mexican with boneless pork chops.  Everything is better with bacon and cheese.  Oh and maybe garlic and onion, peppers, artichoke hearts, etc...

I marinated the chicken overnight, baked it as instructed. I used a red bell pepper instead of green. After the first 20 min of baking I topped the chicken with the bacon, onion, mushrm, pepper, marinade mixture and placed it back in the oven for 15 min.  When 5 minutes left I topped with the slices of mozzarella just so all the cheese wouldn't "slide" off the breasts. It's a great tasting recipe but not something I'll make regularly. It was good for a change.

Terrific!!  I made it last night for company for the first time.  Only change was 1/4 lb of bacon (2 pieces per breast seemed plenty) and no butter.  Our guests asked for the recipe.  So good, thank you!

Made this dish this week.  It was so so good... I am already planning to make it again - VERY soon!

I used my own Teriyaki Marinade (Not store Bought) -that I actually got on this site - Just basically equal parts of Soy Sauce, Brown Sugar and Water and then some minced Garlic.  And I put mine in the marinade the night before.  

The flavors were fabulous and the Chicken was tender and juicy.  Everyone raved about it!  My husband already asking when we are having it again. :)

This was a big hit with my family and DELICIOUS! (Not a bit left over, either!) If you need a timesaver, cook the bacon the night before and seal it in a ziplock bag until you're ready for it.

Used the basic recipe. Didn't use teriyaki because it's full of wheat and hfcs. I marinated with olive oil and fajita seasoning. Turned out great.

Excellent ! I omitted butter and bacon from the recipe and only used 3/4 cup of teriyaki instead of cup to lower sodium - only reason why I didn't give it a 5 star! I marinated the chicken in teriyaki and then grilled it to speed up the cooking process. I sautéed the onion, small portobello mushrooms sliced and 2 peppers (one yellow and one orange) added 1/4 cup I reserved from the teriyaki. I baked the chicken with the sautéed veggies but added 2 cups low moisture mozzarella on top. This was great !

I made this today and everyone said it was 100 times better than a restaurants! It was delicious! The only thing I did different was to marinade the chicken breasts over night instead of for 2 hours... Sauce really went straight thru! Wonderful recipe!!

This was awesome!!! I didn't have the peppers or mushrooms (trying to clean the frig out before going out of town) and the only cheese I had was Velveeta but didn't add that until the last 5 minutes of cooking so it wouldn't melt away. Definitely a keeper!

I was a little skeptical...teryiaki sauce and cheese? All I had was some leftover homemade maple teryiaki, which was really sweet. I added some celery salt and hot peppers and it came out amazing!

I make this all the time! Even my 35 yr old son who Hates mushrooms likes it and eats every bite! I use Veri Veri Teriyaki and usually a mixture of peppers as well as any mixed cheese blend I have on hand and real bacon bits.

My husband and I loved this. I thought all of the flavors blended very well together.  The only things I changed was to flatten the breasts before cooking...everything stayed on the breast!  I only had teriyaki sauce (not marinade) and it worked great.  Next time I will use a thicker slice of bacon.

Excellent.  Threw this together at the last minute for our anniversary dinner.  Only change I made was using Monterey Jack Cheese.  A lovely meal.

the recipe was good but the soy sauce was too salty. Next time I will dilute it with some water everything else was great. I cooked the onion,green peppers and mushrooms in some of the bacon fat and use shredded cheese. came out great!

We really loved this dish. It truly wasn't that time consuming or hard to make. I greased the bottom of my baking dish with butter and it really help to maintain the juiciness. I used provolone chesse. A winner. Thank you so much!

Just the right flavor combination of sauce and vegetables. I used shredded cheese instead of the slices but it melted too fast. Next time I would use the slices.

If I could I would rate 3.5 stars as it wasn't exceptional but pretty tasty. The breasts were a little dry. Onions and green peppers are some our favorites which I use frequently. Just didn't go well with this type of chicken recipe. Not something that I would make on a regular basis. Sorry :(

My husband and children LOVED this recipe.  Definitely a nice change for a chicken recipe.   It was so good that the next time I have dinner guests, I will be serving this as main course.   Thank you Leigh for sharing this recipe.
