Yummy!  The one who gave it only 2 stars must have used artichoke hearts in water, because if you use seasoned marinated artichoke hearts, this just bursts with flavor!  I also use fresh grated Parmesan or combined parmesan/romano.  FRESH is much better than  the KRAFT in the little container.  Enjoy.

I thought this was really tasty for being so quick and easy!  No heating up the oven, no mixing ingredients - a real winner!  Definitely use marinated artichokes.  There is some ambiguity as what to use in the recipe, but I think if you used just plain it would be really bland.  I will definitely be making this again!

quite delicious, but a little oily.  perhaps i could have done without the extra butter, as my marinated artichokes seem to have been oily enough.

on second thought, now that i've revisited this recipe and forgot about the oiliness, i DEFINITELY didn't need the extra butter.  VERY oily.

This was great for a simple version of a classic dip. I used artichokes in water, drained in colander and added a bit of salt & pepper w/ the butter step. Topped with fresh shredded Parm., paprika, and served w/ Triscuit's Parmasean & Garlic Thin Crisps. Whole thing was gone in about 5 minutes!

Have made this for several parties - people love it and always think it's a lot more complicated to make than it actually is!  I highly recommend it.
