Yay! First to review and you get 5 stars! I have never had a tuna melt before. Cheese and Tuna weirds me out...not anymore though. :) I think swiss is a perfect choice because it is a mild cheese...normally I don't really go for swiss because I love strong cheese - but with tuna this wouldn't work in my opinion. I added jalapenos for kick because that is me. It is a very tasty and easy recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

Skinnied this up with greek yoghurt and used cheddar for the kiddos. These are fantastic tuna melts! Making round two tonight.

When made as directed this just doesn't taste very good. The cheese was unusually dry after baking and the juice and dill completely overpower the tuna flavor. It made for a disappointing meal.
