This was a little bit too "arugula-y" for me!  Maybe it would have been improved by using more basil and less arugula.  Also, this should be made with a mildly-flavored olive oil, so that the arugula and olive flavors aren't overwhelming.  It's worth a second try, though!

wow--spicy. Tastes great if you like argula.  I added cottage cheese and gave one more spin thru the blender to mellow it out a bit.

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED THIS RECIPE. I had a mix of arugula and baby spinach to use up and have seen this recipe before but never had the arugula. Well tonight was the night for something fast and easy. Also, instead of walnuts, I used what I had on hand that being pecans. Otherwise it was as written and served with penne pasta. Thanks Jessica, it will be made again.

This was fabulous. I left out the cayenne pepper so my picky toddler would eat it. He loved it and so did we. I'm going to make a few more batches to use up my bunch of arugula and freeze them.

Made this for lunch today and it was so fantastic! I've only used basil for pesto and being that I love arugula this was a really nice change. Thanks Jessica!!!!

I didn't have basil, so I used cilantro (see step 1).  It was a bit too peppry for me, and I really like arugula. Perhaps my arugula was not fresh.  
I will try again with basil.

Tasted okay, but had a very strong arugala taste which was almost overwhelming.

This was my first time making pesto of any kind. We had some arugula from our CSA and I was looking for recipes to try it with. DH and I could not really decide if we liked it or not. My three older girls(12,8,6) loved it though. My boys (2 and 5) did not like it at all.  I added some more parm. cheese and it helped a lot.

Best pesto I've ever had, let alone made myself. EAsy and delicious. Had to make sure I used ENOUGH arugula by measuring after the coarse chopping. Think I could eat this once a week.

great way to use extra arugula.  Not too strong.  I followed the recipe exactly, using fresh basil - not cilantro

This is a wonderful fresh pesto. FOLLOW the recipe, cilantro is NOT basil.
