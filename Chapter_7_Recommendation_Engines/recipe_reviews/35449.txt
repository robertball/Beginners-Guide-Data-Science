I can't speak about the pie because I didn't make it, but I did make the vanilla sauce and it was excellent!!  Almost like a "loose" vanilla pudding. I served it over ice cream puffs, but it could have many uses.  It's easy to make, and nice and thick.  I kept it warm all evening in a jar in some warm water on the stove, and it kept perfectly - never separated.  I might use less sugar next time, but it's a keeper!!

This was a very, very sweet apple pie.  It was delicious but I will cut down on the amount of sugar and/or cinnamon chips next time.

OMG! This pie is fantastic. I and my friends who are also on all recipes, have made this twice for our friends at school. We are in college and this recipe is so easy, it can be made right in the dorm kitchens. Each time we made it, we brought it to parties and everyone was begging for a slice. I love this pie and even those who think all the cinnamon would be too strong, it's not. It tastes absolutely delicious and 30 college students don't lie.

Best Apple pie ever!!! I have made it several times. I have even thrown them in the freezer! They turn out wonderful. This pie has become my signature pie and I get requests for it all the time. It is not expensive to make either (an added bonas!) I do not make the vanilla sauce and serve it with home made ice cream insted.

The best recipe I have found for apple pie. It was a little too sweet.  I suggest reducing the amount of sugar and cinnamon chips. The topping is outrageous. This was a great hit at Thanksgiving. Highly recommend this recipe!

This pie was very tastey, but mine was kind of thin.  I think 3 Tbsp. butter on the top is too much.  I would probablly try it again.

This is excellent!  Very, very sweet!  My husband does not like apple pie or any fruit pie, he took a little bite of mine and then grabbed his own piece!  What a hit!  Next, I think I an going to try it with peaches!?

Like one of the earlier reviewers, I didn't made the pie but I made the vanilla sauce - and it was fantastic.  It actually turns out with a custard taste.  My husband and I loved it!

I got so many raves for this recipe with a crust recipe if also found on this site. I made it for Thanksgiving and as a house-warming gift...both didn't survive the hour! The only change I made that was instead of the Hershey chips i used ginger snaps (crushed them up in a food processor) and on the second one I also added about a table spoon of maple syrup to the topping to make it stickier and it made it so much yummier! I will be making this a staple of our holidays!

I love this pie! I make it for all winter/fall holidays. My in-laws adore the flavor and it smells wonderful baking. The only problem has been finding the cinnamon chips out of seasonal times. I can order them from Hershey but they only send a case.

This pie didn't work; the filling was very runny (we had to scoop it out with a spoon), and the crumble was thick and unappetizing (I should have used cold vs. room temperature butter). We ended up throwing out most of it. I've since read that any fruit filling for pie should first be cooked on the stovetop before it's added to the shell and baked; this prevents the fruit from releasing its juices during baking and making the filling runny. I also couldn't find cinammon chips anywhere. In fact, I've never heard of them. I used butterscotch chips instead, but I think the chips contributed to how liquid the filling was.

I gave this recipe 3 stars for presentation and preparation, and 4 stars for taste.  I had a similar experience as some other reviewers where my pie came out very soupy.    And the vanilla sauce did not thicken for me at all, although that could have been due to not having a proper double boiler.  
I would probably make this again b/c I am a huge cinnamon fan, but I would lessen the amounts of a few ingredients, and forget the vanilla sauce altogether.  Thanks for the recipe though!

Wonderful Recipe, Smells amazing the neighbor stopped by!  After an endless search I found the cinnamon chips at Hy-Vee.  I wasn't able to make the vanilla sauce to go with it but the rest was amazing as is and great with vanilla ice cream.  However, I am anxious to try to make sauce.  This is definetly thumbs up!

My family really loves this recipe and Im making it for the second time tonight. I didnt make any changes except for using a little less sugar and using apple pie spice in place of cinnamon. If you cant find the cinnamon chips, check out a Meijer if you have them near you. Great recipe thanks!

I made this sauce to top an apple crunch cake & it's wonderful. I didn't want to go to the trouble of assembling my double boiler, just cooked on lowest setting and stirred constantly. Nice flavor and consistency. Thanks for a yummy recipe. :)

I also found the pie too soupy...the thing was oozing liquid all through baking and for several minutes afterwords! (Put it on a deep cookie sheet.) I'm assuming it was due to the amount of butter, and yet it doesn't taste buttery; so perhaps the soupyness just has to be lived with, if increasing the flour or adding cornstarch doesn't help. I was afraid this pie would be too sweet but I honestly don't think it was. Its hard finding things to do with the Hershey's cinnamon chips and I do think this is a good use of one full bag. I served the pie with ice cream rather than making the sauce so I can't comment on the sauce recipe. I do recommend the pie recipe, although again increasing the flour or adding cornstarch may be a good idea.

THE BEST APPLE PIE EVER!! This was sooo good. I will never make apple pie any other way. It's all about those cinnamon chips! WOW! I made the sauce too. I was a little worried I would not like it but it was great.

This pie was too sweet, but I'm not a big sweet fan to begin with.  It seemed more like a cobbler than pie (due to the consistency-might have been my fault). And, I forgot to use the vanilla sauce so I really can't give an accurate review.

I never thought I would hear myself say this, but it was just a little too sweet and sticky to be a pie.  The crust came out too hard, possibly my fault.

Delicious recipe... we couldn't find cinnamon chips, so we substituted butterscotch chips instead and added extra cinnamon. The pie was a bit too sweet, like others have said. And I don't know what I did wrong, but mine turned out more like a soup than a pie? Oh well... it was delicious nonetheless!

Taste fabulous eventhough the Hershey's cinnamon chips were unable to be found in any of my local grocery stores.  I sure it would be even better if I could have added them.  I will try again soon it I can locate this ingredient

I loved the taste of this.   Like others, I could not find cinnamon chips, but I came across Heathbar chips, so I added them to only the crunch topping.  I used 5 cups Granny Smith and 1 cup Golden Del. applies.  It was not too runny for me, but I did use a deep dish  frozen pie pastry (brushed with egg) and cooked for 1 hour 15 min. until it bubbled through the topping.  My first time ever making an apple pie!

I didn't make the pie, but I did make the vanilla sauce!!  OMG - this is wonderful!  I did not use a double boiler, just a small sauce pan on low heat and stirred constantly.  I slightly decreased the sugar and used Demerera sugar.  Didn't think it was ever going to thicken up, then voila!  It took about 20 minutes I think.  When it was done and I added the vanilla, I then put it through a fine strainer to get the egg bits out.  (Using it on bread pudding.) It is sooooo good - I'm saving this on my PC!  Thanks so much! ;-)
