After tasting this made as written I felt it needed more to balance out the tomato paste. I ended up tripling the horseradish and also adding more lemon juice. This was pretty good and super simple. I enjoyed eating it knowing it wasn't packed full of sugar like the bottled kind you get in the store. Thanks for sharing!

With extra horseradish (x3) since I did not have spicy V8, and extra lemon juice (a whole lemon), a little extra hot sauce, and a half teaspoon of Splenda, it tasted very good!  This would work for a keto diet.
