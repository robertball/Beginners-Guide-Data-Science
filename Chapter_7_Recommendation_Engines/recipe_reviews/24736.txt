This is one of the greatest ways to serve Brie! My friend also adds a unique twist: Get a tube of crescent rolls dough, and line them around the cooking dish, with pointed sides out. Place cheese and filling (we like apricot preserves) on top of dough, and fold the points in toward the center. Cook the same as above. Dee-lish!

I made this for a Tupperware party, and everybody loved it! It was so easy to make and tasted so good! When I went to my friend's party, she asked me to bring this, and I made it with roasted garlic instead, which was awesome! It was gone in minutes.

I took this idea and decided to top with sun dried tomatoes and heat in micro for about 2 minutes and served with sliced french bread.  OH MY GOSH!  It was so deelish and I can hardly wait to try with the blueberry!  I know it has to be out of this world.

I made this using raspberry pie filling and and melba toasts and it went in 10 minutes.  I get requests for it all the time.  I have also made grilled cheese sandwiches using brie and raspberry sauce.

I made this with the Blueberry filling. While I had to cook it much longer than 10 minutes to have the Brie warm and smooth - it was a hit. I served it on the dessert table - with water crackers.

This was a great recipe. Instead of blueberries I used honey and fresh rasberries.  I served it at a party and it went in minutes. I used the baguette slices and table water crackers.Thanks for the great idea.

Mmm, mmm good!  A quick and easy way to make a truly elegant appetizer.  I tried to reheat ours, however, and it almost exploded!

sorry, but this didn't suit our taste.  I had about 25 people over & served it along with several other (great) recipes.  No one cared for it.  As a matter of fact, I threw the whole thing away.  Next time I'll listen to my husband.  He predicted that it wouldn't go over.  Maybe it is because we're southerners....

For all those not enjoying this recipe with blueberry pie filling - you must try it with Stonewall Kitchen's Wild Maine Blueberry Jam, OMG, it's to die for!!!  The jam has whole berries and is perfect for cheese...we also eat slices of brie cold with a dab of jam on crackers and it's amazing too!  Had to share!

The recipe is easy to prepare and can be varied easily.  I did not enjoy this but the guests at my party did.  It may just be an acquired taste for Brie.

I taught an hors d'oeuvre class at my church, and I used this recipe - it was a huge hit!  I took the advice of some of the others regarding the blueberry, so I used strawberry pie filling - YUMMY!!!  I served it on toasted bagguetts.  You can find a 14oz brie wheel at Sams Club for $4.50 - I just used two...A+!!!

The blueberry pie filling just didn't work for me. It is too bland and has too much "goo". I think a blueberry chutney (if there is such a thing) would be better. I've made baked brie with mango chutney and cranberry chutney garnished with bacon crumbles or pecans and that was very well received, I'll go back to that.

The trick is to keep the brie warm and eat immediately after baking. When it begins to cool off it will harden and is not as easy to enjoy. Best to bake (as oppossed to microwave) as instructed and serve in the hot dish. I used a quality blueberry jam and I am sure for variety any quality jam could be used. Nice with an assortment of crackers and bread.

AMAZING! I used seedless raspberry preserves, which I topped with fresh blueberries and drizzled with honey. Increased the baking time to 20 minutes so the cheese just oozed out when cut. I know I didn't quite stick to the original recipe, but I had to post because it was soooo good. I served it for company today and between the 6 of us, it was gone it minutes.

Occasionally, we New Englanders will throw a slice of cheddar cheese on our apple pie (hey, don't knock it till you've tried it!).  With that in mind, I made this recipe with apple pie filling and topped with crumbled, crispy bacon.  Delicious!! Sweet, but not too sweet, and savory without being too salty.  This is a great basic recipe, I can't wait to try more combinations!

I've made this several times and it's always wonderful.  It's a great excuse to use those odd jams and jellies that always call my name in the store.  We recently tried this with Habanero-Peach jelly, and it was unbelievable.  It also made great sandwiches the next day with leftover caramelized onions...or bacon...or...wait...there go my arteries....

This was served at a business Open House 25th Anniversary and was the biggest hit!    There was no time to put it in an oven (as there was not one on the premises), so I put it for three (3) minutes in their microwave until the Brie  was soft...served it on a cake stand with pretzel chips...beautiful, excellent taste, and colorful.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loved it.  I tried the tip suggesting making a pastry cover for the brie.  Although it tasted great, did not look so great.  That will require some tweaking ....

SO SIMPLE.. GREAT
ALSO USE A JELLY INSTEAD.. DEPENDING ON YOUR OWN TASTES.. RED PEPPER JELLY SPICY APPLE, I JUST USE A APRICOT CHUTNEY.. GIVES IT A MORE SAVORY FLAVOR THEN THE SWEET BLUEBERRY PIE FILLING

I didn’t love this, it was just okay.  The blueberry pie filling just wasn’t good enough.  I will try this again but using a puréed raspberry sauce.

I made this for a party of 21 people and maybe a tablespoon was gone by the end of the night.  It was the only appetizer to our meal and they ate dinner like they were starving, so I am pretty sure they just thought the brie was gross.  I know I did. It just tasted wrong. I threw it all out at the end of the night, sadly, because brie ain't cheap.  Next time I think I'll go with the more plebian cheese ball.  At least people *eat* that.

I love Brie cheese and I love blueberries.  However, mixing them together was not a good fit for me or my husband.  Neither one of us liked this.  I was going to throw it away, but my husband is rather addicted to food, so he ate quite a bit of it even though he complained that it wasn't very good.  I had 3 bites and that was enough for me.  I will not be making this again.

I have michigan wild blueberries so I peeled the rine and cut the Brie in half and sprinkled cinnamon sugar and blueberries then capped it with the second half and sprinkled more cinnamon sugar and blueberries on top so I had layers of fruit. Yummy. Served with buttery crackers.  Not as sweet as pie filling.

DID NOT ENJOY THIS AT ALL WITH THE BLUEBERRIES. MIGHT HAVE TASTED BETTER WITH DIFFERENT KIND OF FRUIT. MAYBE A SWEETER FRUIT. THE BLUEBERRIES WERE BLAND WITH THE BRIE. HAD TO THROW IT OUT BECAUSE NO ONE WAS EATING IT.
