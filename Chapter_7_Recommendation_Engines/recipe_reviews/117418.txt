Great with grilled steaks! I cut the recipe in half and microwaved my potatoes to save on time. I left out the basil completely for more a sour crem and chive type of twice baked potatoe. So, with that being said I upped the amount of chives, reduced hte amount of cream cheese a bit and replaced it with a bit of light sour cream. Overall, very good.

This is the first recipe I gave 5 stars too!!

These were sooooo delicious! I added more butter, chives, and cream cheese. I followed another posters tip and rubbed olive oil for the first part of baking for a better taste and crisp.
I added shredded cheddar cheese to the last 5 minutes of baking.

I will make over and over again!! Thanks so much!!

I made this last night with my boyfriend and they turned out really well!

I made some changes to the recipes based on what past reviewers said and added some extra butter and cream cheese. I wound up using a flavoured cream cheese (chive and garlic) and added extra cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and salt. The result was a super creamy, extremely flavourful twice baked potato!

I highly recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a new take on a old classic.

These were soooo good! I added a bit more than 1 dash of cayenne and used  paprika, garlic pepper and fresh ground black pepper rather than just paprika and garlic powder to top. Very creamy but not too cream cheesey. Will certainly be making again and again!

This recipe was suggested to me earlier this week. Thankfully I took the advice! It was very easy to make and came out delicious, as is. A perfect side to any dish, or even as a main course

These potatoes were so tasty and easy, I used 3 medium potatoes and followed the directions. Once I tasted them they just didn't seem quite right so I went by taste before stuffing them into their skins. The result: 3 Potatoes,6 oz of cream cheese and 4 tablespoons of butter. Now for the drizzle part, I drizzled a bunch of butter on the tops of each spud. When we sat down for dinner there was no need to add  more butter or sour cream to the potatoes. Turned out excellent.

EXCELLENT!  My wife ate three halves (and she's a small person)!  I usually tweak recipes a bit, but this was just fantastic as-is.  Well, OK, I did follow another reviewer's advice and rubbed the potatoes with olive oil and sprinkled garlic salt on the outside before baking.   Great recipe, Ruth!

Delicious low-fat recipe.  I added some garlic salt and used Brummel and Brown spread in place of the butter.  It came in at 4 PointsPlus (Weight Watchers) according to the nutrition stats.

I started with five *large* baked potatoes before I noticed that this recipe gives you two servings per medium potato.  With four adults and one kid eating, there were very few leftovers anyway.    Easy to make too.

I had made potato skins a few nights ago and was looking for a recipe to use the pulp with.  I did double the chives and added a dollup of sour cream.  Instead of stuffing back into the skins, I baked them in sprayed muffin cups as directed.  Was very good!  My husband and I loved them.  My five year old daughter ate them, but I don't think she was too excited about them.  However, my eight month old son thought they were great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good and I'm picky!  I did what other reviewers suggested. I doubled the chives (and I used freeze dried) and  used more butter. I also used garlic powder and pepper. These are restaurant quality. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Magnifico! I added a bit more butter and a tad more pepper, but these were great! No muss & fuss dressing your baked potato at the table when you're ready to eat! I rubbed olive oil on my potatoes before baking too. I love the skin and this gives it a flavorful crispiness. Yum!

Delicious! I made these and served them with steak.

I did not use basil since I didn't have it. Also, feel free to adjust the paprika, garlic powder and cayenne pepper according to your liking. I added extra garlic powder and paprika. 

Next time I am going to try olive oil on the skin to make it crispy.

The only change I made to this recipe was that I added some cheddar cheese, other than that followed it to a tee. Very good recipe and I will certainly be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe the whole family loved!

I added the ingredients to leftover garlic mashed potatoes and baked the mixture in a casserole dish.  Very yummy.  I'll definitely make this recipe again.

After hearing the neighbor kids yelling "potato potato" for some unknown reason, I decided it was a sign and made these. It was spur of the moment so I had to do a few substitutions - I didn't have chives so I replaced that with salt free herb & garlic seasoning. I also didn't have milk so I used powdered milk. I didn't feel like waiting for the potatoes to bake so I popped them in the microwave for the first round of baking. I used extra cream cheese as other users suggested, plus I like cream cheese. I sprinkled them with bacon bits after baking. Pretty good! I don't think they're spectacular but they are pretty good. I'll make them again, maybe do a few tweaks.

Five stars!  I made a couple of changes because I lacked those ingredients - used chipotle instead of cayenne, and used neufchatel in place of cream cheese. Came out just great!  I used a potato masher and mixed everything by hand, but I'll use my stand mixer next time. I will be tripling the recipe when I make it again for our Christmas dinner.

I made these tonight for dinner along with bbq steak and everyone loved them.  I had had something like this at a dinner party before and was looking for a recipe to try.  I'm glad I decided to try this one.  The flavour was great, I didn't have chives so I used green onion that I had on hand and mixed the garlic powder right into the potatoe mixture.  Next time I think I'll whip them with a beater instead of mashing them to make it fluffier, other than that we all loved this recipe.  Thanks Ruth

My guys loved this, but I thought it was a bit dry.  Maybe it's just me because I have never been a fan of twice baked potatoes, but it doesn't stop me from trying new recipes.  Maybe next time I'll add more butter into the filling.

Ok. I used neufanchel cheese because I had it from another recipe, parsley instead of basil, added 3 tsp of chopped garlic and sprinkled cheddard cheese on top when I baked them the second time. I also omitted the garlic powder because I had added chopped garlic to the recipe. Great starter recipe!

I made these for Christmas Eve dinner and they were a hit!  The herb and cream cheese mixture was delicious!  My only recommendation would be to bake the potatoes a little longer than the recipe calls for.  I took mine out and had a hard time mashing the insides with the rest of the mixture.  I also used a small amount of olive oil on top of the filled potatoes before putting them back in the oven.  I agree with others that all of that butter would be too much.  Great recipe!!  Definately make again!!

These were "good", not amazing. I made them the day before Christmas, refrigerated them overnight and then baked them for Christmas dinner. I would add a dash of garlic salt to bring out the flavors a bit more.

I used the cream cheese that comes in the tub, the Chive and Green Onion flavor (we use this on our bagels) instead of using cream cheese and chives seperately, but I used everything else exactly as listed in the recipe and they were excellent. Adding a bit of cheese on top during the last few minutes of baking is a personal choice.

These were really good for a low-fat recipe. I added a little cheddar cheese to my husband's potato and took a little taste...but I think the cheese over-powered the herbs.

These were SOOO good! Even with all the changes I made to the recipe, these were amazing and impossibly easy! I omitted the basil, cayenne pepper, replaced the cream cheese with sour cream and the skim milk with whole, and didn't put the potato back in the skin. Sprinkled with a little cheddar on top, these potatoes really hit the spot! By the way, these cook great in the microwave (just cook the potato and add ingredients - it turns out so good!). I will definitely make these again - probably for company! Thanks for the great recipe!

I also rubbed olive oil on the skins, and topped with a little shredded cheddar and finished them on the bbq , they turned out delicious.

This is a winner. I followed other suggestion like coating the skin with a little olive oil to give it a more crispy skin. I also added a little cheese on top in the last 7 minutes of baking.

Awesome! That just about sums it up. Twice baked potatoes are so easy to make and really impress your dinner guests. I like to put a little shredded cheese on top of the potato halves in the final 5 imutes of baking.

I didnt look up this recipe except to see how long to bake it.. the second time, if you will. If you've eaten 2ce baked papas and/or have any imagination as a cook you can pretty much make up your own version.. Here's mine: I baked the potatoes a couple days ago for a baked potato and chili thing, and cooked a few extra for just a recipe such as this.. I sauteed lil pieces of zucchini and onion and garlic, then added the spooned out innards of the potato to warm, adding in some cream cheese, letting it melt in over the stove. Stuff it into the potato skin(i added cheddar in there too-oops forgot) ..(and red wine- i mean in a glass to sip!).. and then baked it for about 20 min. Super good!! but, I could have added a few more spices... Use your imagination and have fun with your cooking!

DELICIOUS! Great recipe. My whole family loved them. They go great as the main course with a salad as they are very filling.

I made these for a dinner party.  Everyone ate the entire potato and raved how fantastic they were.  I made one potato per person.  I added more cream cheese to the mix.  I baked them for about 15 minutes and then added cheddar cheese and crumbled turkey bacon on top and then returned to oven for another 5 minutes or so.  Huge hit! Would definitely make again.

I made these last night with a few modifications: low fat sour cream instead of cream cheese and I added about 1/4 c. mozarella cheese. I used the suggestion of rubbing the skins with olive oil, salt, and garlic powder, which helped a lot; however, I found these to be pretty bland and toward the end I used ketchup to help get it down. Will probably add more spices next time.

Excellent recipe, microwave them instead of baking for an hour, until soft inside, use garlic powder as in recipe instead of real garlic as it does not cook in the mixture for 20 mins. I also added cheddar in the mix and on top.

Wow! Fantastic recipe. The only thing I would do differently is scrape potatoes to 1/4 inch of the skin as another reviewer suggested. This will keep the skins from tearing as easily.

Great taste. These turn out wonderful and leave guests wanting more! Another way to really impress is the size of the potato you use. There is a place called hugeidahopotato.com where you can get a potato that is over a pound!

Simply amazing potatoes!  The only thing I will change next time I make these is to add diced bacon/ham to the filling mixture.  Great recipe, definitely a keeper.

These were very good.  The skins on my potatoes ended up being too thin to withstand the process, so I baked the potato "guts" in a few small ramekins, instead. Despite my blundering, they were creamy and rich tasting.  Not my favorite way to cook potato, and perhaps too much work for the reward, but very good and something I'll make again.

My Husband and I loved this! We had been looking for a good potato recipe, and this was a different and great twist to a twice baked potato. All we did different was add a little more cayanne, and it was wonderful. Thank you!

Nice flavor.Need a little more butter and garlic for my personal taste, but really good recipe.  Thanks!
