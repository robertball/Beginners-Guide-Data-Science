I made 2 versions of this- 1 just as explained in the recipe. It turned out great! Like a pumpkin dump cake. Version 2 I mixed all the ingredients except the butter and I drizzled it on top- turned out more like a bread/muffin. I wish I'd used the pecans and butter and made a crust instead of mixing it all together- both tasted great!!!

It had good flavor but I didn't like the texture. The only way I can describe it is that it was too wet. I wouldn't make it again, but will try to find a variation of this recipe.

I love pumpkin pie and this dessert takes pumpkin pie to a whole new level! It is the perfect mix of pie and cake and sweet and salty! So easy to throw together and very impressive. Enjoy!
