This was great! I highly recommend it. The only thing I would change would be to use a little less olive oil.

Delicious. My family enjoyed this with some chicken I just dipped in milk and plain bread crumbs and pan fried. I mixed most of sauce in Spaghetti and added 1/2 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese in the sauce. Then I placed cooked chicken on spaghetti and topped chicken with remaining sauce. Then garnished with more finely grated Parmesan cheese.
