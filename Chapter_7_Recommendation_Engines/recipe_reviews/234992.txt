12.16.15   The lemonade concentrate and ginger partner so well with the cranberries and apples.  You get a real pop of interesting flavors in every bite.  Since lemonade concentrate already is so sweet and since our personal taste leans more toward “less” sweet these days, I cut the sugar in half.  What I ended up with was the perfect balance of sweet-tart.  The minced apples cooked down to a beautiful consistency.  Trying to get a headstart on Christmas dinner, so this is going into the freezer.  Tessa Goodpaster, thanks for sharing your recipe.  We really enjoyed it, and this may just become my go-to recipe for cranberry sauce!
