Delicious! The perfect fall comfort food! Because it was a busy day, I used frozen stewed vegetables and frozen corn and put in a deep dish pie pan instead of making mini. Used  Guinness extra stout and it gave it such a delicious rich flavor. Definately a keeper.

I used round individual oven proof dishes and covered them with puff pastry. I used ground turkey instead of beef but got a beef flavor with beef concentrate. I browned the meat and removed it before starting the vegetables. I could have par cooked the veggies a little more as they were a bit under done. We thought it turned great.

Used two pounds of hamburger and two packages of frozen stew vegetables. Did not have rosemary, used thyme instead. Got a pinch too much thyme, but still tastes great. Used a bulb of garlic instead of the tbsp of garlic powder. One can of Beef Broth for the beef stock. The dark ale was a bottle of Kalamazoo Stout. Made two full round pies with just a bit of filling left over. Used glass pie dish's. Will I make this again?, for sure...
