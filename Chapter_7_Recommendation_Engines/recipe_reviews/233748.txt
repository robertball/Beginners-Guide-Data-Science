Instead of Miracle Whip, I used a homemade low-calorie ranch dressing (which was made from half sour cream, half mayonnaise). I also added a good amount Frank's Hot Sauce. Interesting side salad for a mexican themed dinner. All four of us thought this would have been better made as a dip with Frito Scoops to eat with it instead of crushed chips inside.

This is so good! I made a couple of changes. I used mayo and more corn and Fritos. I made it the night before, but I added Cheese Chili Fritos and the cheese the next morning. Everyone loves this one.

I just finished eating this at a work potluck and looked on here to find the recipe.  The version I had was served in a 9x13 casserole with the corn chips crushed and crumbled on top.  I was really surprised by this.  I liked it a lot, but the onion is very strong so I would take it easy.  This would make an excellent picnic salad.

We were served this at a church dinner and it was great!  They used chili-cheese Fritos which gave it a little kick.  I have been searching for this recipe for a couple of years.  Our kids kept asking for this recipe I'm glad someone submitted it!

I have made this before with the fiesta canned corn, but the frozen corn and peppers tasted much fresher.  I didn't understand why the milk was needed and left it out.  I mixed everything except the chips and refrigerated it overnight.  I crushed 1/2 a bag of Fritos and stirred them in right before serving.  ( the 1/4 cup called for by the recipe is not even close to enough!)  One suggestion: if you think there will be leftovers, set aside some of the salad before adding chips.  The chips get soggy Nd

I made it according to the recipe and it was awesome!  The next time I used  bottled Buttermilk Ranch dressing instead of mayo and Chili Cheese Fritos and it was even better.  The next time I make it I hope to get enough fresh jalape√±os in it and it will be absolutely perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

For the dressing, I mixed 1/2 dukes mayonnaise with  1/2 miracle whip. I also opted to use the chili cheese Fritos. REALLY REALLY easy and SOOO good! Definitely recommend!

I made it and used fresh summer corn that I cooked and cut from the cob myself. Substituted chill cheese fritos and used a super thick and creamy ranch that i made from a packet. I recommend using a sweet onion like a  Vidalia  so as not to over power and add a finely diced jalapeno for a little kick . This a perfect summer side for cookouts. Delish!!!

It was very good, only negative is I prefer a salad I can eat for a couple of days and this one was not good the next day. Great for large family BBQs.

This was a really good and different salad. I used mayo instead of Miracle Whip but only because of personal preference. I also used 2 cans of kernel corn for convenience sake. I also added quite a bit more corn chips. And skipped the green pepper but doubled up on the red pepper. I think if you wanted this to be really colourful you could add orange pepper as well. The salad was a hit and I'll definitely make this again for my next potluck.

My sister made this salad and everyone loved it.  I like the convenience of canned corn so I will probably use that.  I also liked other reviewers suggestions to use more chili cheese fritos and ranch dressing instead of mayo or miracle whip.
