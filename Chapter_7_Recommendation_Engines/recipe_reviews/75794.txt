I was really craving something with sauerkraut on a cold, rainy day and this did the trick!  Sauerkraut is not usually my favorite, but this was very good.  The apples seemed to cut a little bit of the bite of the kraut.  I didn't do the cream sauce (didn't have the ingredients on hand) and it turned out very nicely.  I also drained and rinsed the kraut to cut the saltiness.  I will definately nake this again!

I typically like apples and sauerkraut. I made this with a smoked turkey kielbasa. But something didn't work for me - I think it was the cream paired with the vinegar from the kraut. I'll stick to no cream next time.

Delicious!  My whole family LOVED it!  I added 1 cup shredded cabbage to soften the sauerkraut flavor, and it was a hit!

Loved this recipe.  I didn't have apple cider/juice/brandy on hand, so I pureed an apple with a couple teaspoons of brown sugar and mixed that in with the cream and drippings.  Also, I use milk or 1/2 & 1/2 because that's what I usually have on hand.  It's our favorite kraut/apple dish.  Thanks!

This was GREAT.  Used apple cider (couldn't find brandy).  I'm not always a fan of apple/kraut recipes, but this was delicious.  Served with mashed potatos, which were great with the cream sauce.

I followed this recipe exactly as given.  We like all the ingredients and are not picky eaters and enjoy trying different recipes.  This one just did not work.  Sauce was runny and the flavor was bland.  Will not make this one again.

My husband loved it.  Couldn't find apple brandy, but used apple shnapps; great flavor!  I also added some caraway seed, this is a great fall recipe.

Awesome recipe!  Great infusion of flavors!  My husband and I totally enjoyed it.  I used a low fat smoked sausage and used half & half.  I mixed some regular brandy and the juice from a cup of manadarin oranges instead of the apple brandy.  I'm adding this to our favorites.

I used Spiced Cider in with the cream and pan drippings.  Without a thickening agent, sauce didn't look like a gravy but more like curdled milk. I had alot of liquid after baking but maybe I didn't drain the kraut well enough or shouldn't have covered.   
The flavor was great but my husband thought it needed more meat.

I was really surprised at the flavor, would definitely make again, but using more sausage for the heartier meal.

I made this last night, it was super easy and a huge hit!  I left off the cream sauce, it seemed odd with sour Kraut.  But I did add the brandy, which sounded delicious.  My husband almost ate it all!

I made this for a cooking party. I was unsure about having a "creamy" sauce with sauerkraut, but I--and everyone else--thought the flavor was great! I couldn't find apple brandy so I used honey brandy and omitted onions to accommodate a friend. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  The taste is very bold and kinda tangy we thought, we will definitely make it again. I didn't have the heavy whipping cream so I used half n half instead everything else followed recipe.

So I didn't have to buy a whole gallon of apple cider I just purchased a small Martinelli's apple and used it.  Fantastic flavor all-around! My wife is still raving about it this morning.

Didn't like the sweet apples and sour kraut combination.
