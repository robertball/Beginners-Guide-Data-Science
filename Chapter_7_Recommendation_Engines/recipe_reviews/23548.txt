My husband was craving lemonade all day. I didn't have any lemons, so I just used the bottled juice and he really liked it. It was a little sweet for me, so I just added water. Thanks for an easy recipe!

I was really craving lemonade one night, so I found this recipe, and went to lemon squeezing. I don't really think it was worth the effort. I had to use more lemons than the recipe called for because it wasn't tart enough- but then I only drank half a glass and threw the rest away because the flavor wasn't quite right. It was the right amount of tartness, and the right amount of sweet- but there was something missing. At this point, store bought is better. Thanks anyway.

At first we thought it was too much sugar. But then we tried it and then it was fantastic. It was the perfect combination of water, sugar, and Lemons.

For us, this was a quite sweet and honestly, too sweet to be "thirst quenching". I loved the exact measurements as it took the guess work out of making lemonade and it gave me a more accurate assessment of how I'll make it next time. Next time, I'll cut the sugar back by half. I think it'll be just right then.

I appreciate recipes like this that give you an actual measurement of juice rather than "the juice of x lemons." Sizes of fruit and their juiciness vary so much! I’ve also found I prefer lemonade made with simple syrup over just stirring in the sugar. However...I know everyone’s sweetness level varies, but 2/3 cup sugar is a LOT of sweetness for this amount of water and juice!  I stopped at half that much, 1/3 cup, which proved to be just right.

I've been ill this winter and I was really sick of water and tea. I thought I'd try this recipe out so I could make keeping fluids in me easier and tastier. All I can say is yum and thank you. I used the bottled juice also and it was very good.

this is great!  a little too much sugar for me, though.  I usually quadruple the recipe and use 4c water with 2c sugar for the  syrup.  Then I add 2c lemon juice, the 5c of ice water, and the 4c of sugar water mix.  this is so good in the summer.  thanks!

This lemonade tasted awesome to me! I'd never really thought much about how I like lemonade, though I've had a lot of it over the years. But I guess I do like it on the sweet side, and this delivered - not too sweet, but definitely not on the tart side. And the density is near-perfect too; not on the weak, watery side, but nice and "solid", for lack of a better word. I followed the recipe to the letter, and though I've squeezed fresh lemons before, this recipe didn't specify, so I just used bottled lemon juice. The recipe is a tiny bit time-consuming, with the boiling and cooling steps, but then again this is far better than just mixing a glass of lemon-flavored powder with a glass of water. This might not be the best lemonade recipe ever, but it's right up there in my book, so I'll give it 5 stars.

A bit sweet for me, so I added more lemon juice and water. Doesn't make much, but if you find yourself with 4-5 lemons and want to use them up before it's too late, this is a good recipe.
