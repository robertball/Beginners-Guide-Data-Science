great recipe 
i also used  agave nectar instead of honey , agave nectar has one of the lowest glycemic indexes for sweeteners and is good for diabetics. i also only used evaporated skim milk for the 2 dairy products and it turned out great

"I made this pumpkin pie recipe,along with my traditional pie. Most preferred the traditional,
but the kids liked it, since I  drizzled melted
chocolate over when cooled. I did however had
to bake this pie a long time before it was done."

I made this pumpkin pie at my first ever Thanksgiving gathering.  I made it exactly as directed, and it's the best pumpkin pie I've ever tasted.  LOVE this recipe and will use it at every Thanksgiving from then until I die.

I changed out the 1/2 cup milk for more of the heavy cream and I used raw honey. Let's just say my parents said it was the best pumpkin pie they have ever had!!!!! It was a smashing hit!!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe... I just love the smooth texture of it!

Very rich & yummy. I used Pumpkin Honey from Flying Bee Ranch and subbed eggnog for the liquid, so the flavor was a little different than the traditional pumpkin pie. Also the texture was a tad more substantial than usual. We really enjoyed it.

I made the recipe exactly as described and it was wonderful... although next time I may bake it just a tad longer. Everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner loved it, even the ones that don't normally like pumpkin pie.

I a 15 oz can of pumpkin and nut milk instead of milk. Also, reduced honey to 1/2 cup. It came out great and was a hit.

I really like that this recipe called for honey; I had never used that in my pumpkin pie making before.  I still needed to add extra spice (i like my pumpkin really spicy) so I added more cinnamon and doubled the ginger and nutmeg.  Like a couple others commented, baking time was longer than stated.

Thought it was a very good pumpkin pie recipe and easy to make for the non-baker that I am.  I think that it needs a little more time in the oven then the recipe calls for my middle was not setting but that could change depending on the oven.

I used real pumpkin instead of store-bought puree. My family loved it. I don't eat pumpkin, so I am taking their word for it that this is a great recipe.

I liked it, my hubby said it was ok!  I had to cook it 30mins extra to get it to set it the middle.  It also uses alot  of honey.  (I used 1/4 cup Pumpkin flavored honey and 1/2 cup regular.  Next time I will melt the honey first as creamed honey was hard to mix in!)

I mixed everything up and then tasted the mixture and I could tell that something was missing. I then looked at the Libby's Pumpkin Pie recipe that I used the other day and noticed that cloves was missing.  I also have replace the milk with heavy cream and it tastes great.  It is still in the oven and I can't wait to try it cooked.
