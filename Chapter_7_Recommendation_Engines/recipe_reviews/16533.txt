It's good, but it needed a little work to make it that way.  For starters, there's absolutely NO way this dough can be rolled...it's way too gooey!  Dropping it by rounded tablespoons is much easier.  Secondly, it takes longer than 8 to 10 minutes...it took me about 13 or 14 to finally get the center to stop being so doughy.  Third, it is a little too sweet, just a little.  Half a cup of chopped pecans takes the edge off, and I added 2/3 cup of toasted coconut for extra flavor.  With a little tweaking, this is one great cookie!

First of all, Amanda, let me tell you that you are my cookie SAVIOR! These are some of the best cookies that I've ever had and I have you to thank for it! I used a sour cream white cake mix and chocolate pudding instead of the butterscotch, along with melted butter to sub for the vegetable oil, and I had a truly phenomenal cookie. Nothing I've made lately has turned out but these cookies! These are my husband's new favorite. I'm never going to try another oatmeal cookie recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

I make cookies for church every week, and this recipe has become my standby...the variations are endless.
I've gotten super raves and requests for the recipe with these combinations, all with Duncan Hines mixes, plus I always add 1tsp of baking powder:
1. golden butter cake/French vanilla pudding/Crasins
2. lemon cake/lemon pudding/lemon zest/chopped pecans/dipped the balls in sugar before baking
3. golden butter cake/cookies & cream pudding/choc chips

At 11pm, realized that I had forgotten to make the cookies I had promised for a co-worker's birthday celebration in the morning.  Found this recipe, and, like others have said...it is VERY quick!

Didn't have white cake or chocolate chips, so I did the reverse -- chocolate cake with white chips.  Used white chocolate pudding instead of butterscotch, and added 1/3 cup of coconut, in addition to the oatmeal.  They're great if you like a VERY sweet cookie.  My kids love them!  They were fairly greasy.  Next time, I'll try using 1/4 cup of oil.

Versatile recipe and nice to make if low on flour and butter.  Perfect for what I needed; have lots of mixes and puddings, and sour cream I needed to use up.  I used a BUTTER PECAN mix, butterscotch pudding, and BUTTERSCOTCH CHIPS.  I also had an egg yolk and some egg wash from a bread I had made, so measured 1/4 of the egg wash and threw in along with the egg yolk.  I therefore added about 1/3 cup more oatmeal.  Used a combo vanilla and butter flavor extract.  These scooped out so easily on the cookie sheet using a cookie scoop and even with a medium scoop, they make alot.  Did not spread much so can put alot on each sheet without fear of overcrowding.  The taste is great and does not taste like cakemix at all.  Tastes like there is a ton of carmel, or brown sugar and butter in them.  Yum.  Also threw in 1/3 cup of raisins and that was a nice addition.  Very nice.

Great recipe, i substituted Devil's Food Cake mix and Vanilla pudding.  Also, instead of 1 cup of choc chips i did one cup mixed of choc chips, white chips and walnuts.  My Husband loved them.

I truly enjoy these cookies!! This is the first time I've ever made "real cookies" before and I found the recipe quite simple. I used PISTACHIO PUDDING mix and WHITE CAKE mix. I love anything pistachio. Also substituted the vanilla extract for ALMOND EXTRACT and added a tsp. of baking powder and 1/4 vegetable oil. I took note from the other reviews. Dough was very sticky and took shape rather nicely. WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!!

Update 12/07: I just made these again and they were the best yet. I made according to the recipe except I used a DH German Chocolate mix and added about 1/2 cup of pecans. These were absolutely wonderful. Super fudgy and no one would guess how quick and easy these were to make. I used a cookie scoop and got 2 sheets of cookies. These took about 12 minutes to bake. 
Previous review of 12/05: These were very quick and easy. I used a Duncan Hines spice cake mix and French vanilla pudding. In addition to the chocolate chips, I added some pecans and a handful of white chocolate chips. I was skeptical about the recipe not calling for any eggs, but they were perfect in texture...they didn't spread too much and the next day are still crisp on the edges and chewy in the middle. Because of the extra ingredients I added, I had to press everything together so it would stay in a ball when placed on the cookie sheet, but it was worth it because the pecans are great with the spice flavor. I used a cookie scoop and baked them about 10 minutes.

These were so simple, and so very good!  Since the recent egg scare,  I've been looking for a cookie that was eggless.  This one wins by a mile!  Thank you for the excellent recipe!

very easy and very soft moist cookie.  So many ways of changing it around by using different pudding flavors/chips/nuts ect.  I added butterscotch chips and pecans.  I did have to cook about 13 minutes at 375.  Made about 20 cookies and were gone the next day. Will definatly repeat.

I am making these right now. My son has already tasted the first batch and before he even swallowed the first bite, he was jumping in excitement. He has a new favorite cookie! It's too sweet for me so I could probably only  have a few. Could not taste the oats, so I will add more next time.  Maybe this will also help thicken it or even add some flour- I couldn't rolled these, I had to drop in tablespoonfuls. I will definitely make this again trying out some different mixes for cake and pudding. I also didn't have insant pudding mix but it seems to have worked. I've had to bake them for even longer also. So great recipe!

I really liked these! Very chewy and tasty. Ahen I first made them I really noticed the butterscotch flavor, but after I kept them in the freezer and then thawed, it wasn't as noticeable. Still it's a great recipe that was so quick and easy to make and tastes great!

I am  not into baking sweets but I did find this to be a very simple and quick recipe for cookies.  I substituted chocolate pudding for the butterscotch because that is what I had on hand.  It will be fun to try this again with different cake & pudding mixes.

Really good.  Really easy.  Really fast.  My hubby just said these may be his new fave. They are really sweet, almost a bit of an overload.  I used a yellow cake mix and butterscotch pudding and some chocolate chips and walnuts.  I forgot the vanilla, but still delicious!  I would say to bake a lot longer than it says, otherwise they seem too undercooked.  I like a bit of a crisp on the edges.  Maybe 15 minutes would be good.  Thanks!!!  I will make again--I think chocolate cake with chocolate pudding & nuts would be so good!!

These are fine. They're tasty with milk. The trick to getting the dough to form balls is to add only as much water as it needs. I didn't use any water as it happened, my dough was plenty moist. But I was able to form balls just fine. I think it would've been improved with pecans as another reviewer suggested. They weren't too sweet per se, but you can't actually taste any oatmeal so some pecans would've given them a bit more texture and of course, tastiness. I'll probably make them again using some nuts in them somewhere, because they are so easy, but they're not at the top of my list of cookies, I'm afraid. This recipe made 30 cookies for me (using rounded tablespoons), and would've made 36 had I not been so lazy and forced them all fit on 2 cookie sheets.

We LOVE this recipe! My son is allergic to eggs and nuts and this recipe is perfect.  We've tried it with a variety of different puddings (even though the butterscotch is very good).  Vanilla with white chocolate chips is good, but chocolate pudding with semi-sweet chocolate chips takes all!

Super easy recipe especially if you are participating in a cookie swap!  I added another 1/3 cup of oatmeal.  It did take my new oven at least 12-15 min. of baking time like another reviewer mentioned.  I made my balls generous so I got maybe 20 cookies from this recipe.

These were a MAJOR disappointment :( I don't know how to describe these other than..... severely lacking "something". Maybe some salt, chopped nuts, and a bit of cinnamon or something of the like would bring these to life? I don't really know, but I'm not about to give up on a recipe that is this easy to throw together! I should also  that I had no vegetable oil on hand, and had to melt down some Vegetable Shortening and measure it out to 1/2C instead of using vegetable 1/2C oil. I doubt it'd make much of a difference in flavor... which is where this recipe lacks. Texture was lovely though! All in all, don't be afraid to add your own pizzaz to this recipe, as it is quite versatile (sort of a [very] blank canvas).

They don't call me Sugarshock for nothing--but these were too sweet, even for me.  The only person who liked them was the kid whose Mom raises him on macrobiotic and only allows him to eat honey once a year.
Maybe if you make the cookies smaller than suggested (say, may three dozen instead of two)  and add more oatmeal, it would cut down some of the intensity of these huge sugar bombs.

Unusual.  I can't really say I liked them yet I couldn't stop eating them, and I normally have no problem throwing something away.  So I'm not sure.  Try it, it's different.

I wasn't a big fan of the butterscotch taste but loved the concept.  I think I will use chocolate cake and pudding mix next time for a brownie type cookie.  Since my daughter liked this cookie I will make again with a few changes.

"Yuck" would be a generous rating. I was very disappointed with these cookies. Far too oily and "unique" taste was not as good as even the most basic Toll House recipe. I won't be making these again.

These are a staple for me...I always have to buy enough ingredients for two batches otherwise they disappear too quickly!  I use at least a cup of oats per recipe, sometimes more, which probably helps to cut down the sweetness.

These were a hit with the kids.  This is the first cookie recipe I've made that actually made more cookies than the recipe stated :)  Not too sweet for me.  I had to bake for 15 minutes.  We'll make these again.

I wouldn't call this much of an oatmeal cookie as I would a chocolate chip butterscotch cookie. There is hardly any oatmeal in it!
It made 3 1/2 dozen cookies and I baked them for 15 minutes otherwise they were uncooked inside.

These are really good, and so easy to make.  The batter was real gooey at first so I put it in the freezer for a little bit before rolling the dough and baking.

What a waste of time and money. You can make much better cookies without wasting time on boxed cake mix or pudding.  Didn't taste good, and no one wanted me to finish baking them all.

If you are used to baked goods that are entirely homemade, this isn't the recipe for you.  The use of the cake and pudding mixes makes the cookies taste "artificial."  However, if you need something quick and easy to make, these are fine.  My husband and parents loved these, but they didn't taste good to me.

Oops!  In my earlier comment about using this recipe to make great brownies, I forgot to mention to be sure to make the changes I stated earlier (ie, substitute 1/4 c. packed brown sugar for the pudding mix, and add 1 tsp. baking powder to the dry mixture) and use a Devil Food Cake Mix.

The chewy/crunchy texture of these cookies is very unique.  They are very easy to make but do require longer than 10 minutes to bake.  I would go 13-16 minutes.  I also feel adding 1/2 butterscotch chips and 1/2 chocolate chip would be a good call.  I added an entire bag of chocolate chips... this was a little too much.

Haven't yet made the actual cookies; the DOUGH is heaven-on-earth! Plus since this batter is egg-free, the kidlettes and I can all fight over the bowl and spoon with impunity! I added cocoanut for that seven-layer bar taste and ohboy. Fast, easy, wonderful. Can't wait to bake 'em!

These cookies were great out of the oven!  BUT after they cooled my family pretty much stopped eating them.  I think they might have been too sweet because of the butterscotch pudding.  Maybe next time I will only put in part of the instant pudding.  They were also chewy when then wee first baked and now today, one day later, they are hard.  I have never had that happen before.

I haven't been feeling well lately so I decided to make some cookies to cheer me up. I typed in "cookies using a cake mix" in my browsers search box and an hour went by without much luck. I finally came across allrecipes.com and the first recipe I see using a cake mix is Chocolate Chunck Oatmeal Cookies. Believe it or not that was 30 minutes ago and the second batch is in the oven! They are delicious and I know that when my boyfriend gets home from work he'll love them too!

I tried this recipe excactly as written, was intrigued by the sour cream element...the only thing I added was some slivered almonds.  Took 5 minutes to prepare the dough.  20 minutes later...party in your mouth...umhumm...yummy. Took some to the girls in my office...was mowed by everyone!!!! Great fun EZ recipe.

These were too sweet for me.  My son loved them, as I'm sure all children will, but I don't think it's an adult cookie.  Very easy, though!

I brought these to the office and they were gone in seconds. Ingredients are strange but work wonderfully.

My daughter, who is not much of a sweet eater, wouldn't keep her hands off these cookies.  Wow!  I was impressed!

This was a very fast and easy recipe to make.  I substituted flaked coconut instead of rolled oats, white chocolate puuding instead of butterscotch, and used chocolate chunks.  Delicious, however, too sweet for me.  My family enjoyed it!
