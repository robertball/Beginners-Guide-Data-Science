This is one easy and quick after work dinner that the whole family enjoyed. I used the grilled & ready chicken breast strips (no need to cook in oil). Used reduced sodium soy sauce. My daughter ate the red pepper so I threw in some sliced carrots. Any veggies will do. It was lacking a little in flavor until I shook in some powdered chicken bouillon granules. Topped with nuts and green onion. My hubby doesn't like nuts in his food and my daughter likes extra in hers (no problem). Served over brown rice. You can even buy the veggies already pre-cut to cut prep time. A keeper for sure!

This is AWESOME. I made it for a dinner party with family and there was none left! I will be making this again:) The only thing changed was I didn't add peppers but that was because I forgot to buy enough!

This was pretty good but thought it was missing something. I realize now that I forgot the garlic. Will have to try again with it.

I followed the recipe exactly. I even added the optional sesame oil which I think it definately needed. We thought it was delicious. Next time I will replace some of the red pepper with broccoli. Other than that it was great!

We made this recipe tonight for dinner. It was excellent! We omitted the sesame oil but left everything else as directed and we will certainly make this one again.

This was ok for a quick Asian style chicken but nothing out of this world will probably look for something better.

I liked this dish as a base and added some different components to suit our tastes. I added 1/4 cup OJ and about 1 Tbsp Worcestershire to the sauce. Added 1/2 c chopped onions to veggie mixture. At the end to give it a bit more sweetness for my son and hubby I added some pineapple and juice.

basic recipe that is good for a quick week-night meal. Sauce could use a little bit of something else (maybe oyster sauce) but everyone can modify the recipe to suit their specific tastes - a great starter recipe to be slightly modified over time.

Ease of recipe gives it a 4 along with simple taste. I think you re to season chicken beforehand though as it ended up a little bland. I didn t as I wasn t sure if sauce would be too salty. Agree with others it needed something Nothing a splash of soy sauce or some salt can t fix along with some red pepper flake.

If only I could give it zero stars...One of the other reviewers commented "this was really good and easy but I thought that it was missing something...." Well it was missing FLAVOR. Plain white rice has more going on than this dish. In fact that's what I opted for after three bites of Asian Chicken with Peanuts. My only other regret is the 30 minutes I wasted preparing it. It's a complete dud; skip it.

It turned out perfectly for me. The seasoning was just right for me. I did add more peanuts because I love them. Ha

This recipe was ok but seemed to need more salt/soy sauce. I would guess if I had used canned chicken broth or bouillon this would not be true as both are very salty and usually have MSG which would affect the flavor.

It was all right. Like many other people said it was pretty bland. Not really good or bad. It's good for making a quick meal but otherwise I wouldn't make it if I had time.

This was really good even though I was out of garlic and had to use garlic powder instead. Very colorful for company. I used one red and one yellow bell pepper. The gravy thickened up nicely although next time I may make the broccoli florets a little smaller (they were pretty crunchy)
