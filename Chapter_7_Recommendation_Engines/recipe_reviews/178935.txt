This is a really great variation on custard - the orange zest gives a fresh zing, while the red tea provides a subtle unique flavouring. However, the yield for this recipe is way off - I used tea cups and barely got 4 - definitely not 12 servings! Either way, great dessert!

I made this with unsweetened almond milk and the amount of sugar was perfect.  I also used 3 whole eggs instead of the two eggs and two egg whites.  I found the flavors in this custard complemented each other very well!

I made this as is (with unsweetened almond milk) except I added a little vanilla extract.  The texture was perfect and the flavor was really delicate.  I made them to bring to my parents house and my mom polished off all of the left overs.  It only made about 8 half full custard cups, though.

Refreshing and silky decadence without a lot of calories!  So far, I'm liking this best made with Red Chai Tea and about half of the sugar.  I add the orange peel with plain Red Tea and leave it out with the already spicy Chai version.  It makes enough to fill four 6.5 oz custard cups.

I love red tea, so I thought this would be great.  I added a little vanilla extract and used unsweetened vanilla almond milk and Madagascar vanilla red tea.  
I think it would be too sweet if one used sweetened almond milk.  
As it is, I found the orange zest to be totally overwhelming.  If I made this again (and I probably wouldn't), I'd leave it out entirely.  The end result tasted, to quote my husband, "just like Fruity Pebbles".  
It did bake up beautifully, though a welcome addition to this recipe would be brief instructions for a water bath, which I had to look up.
