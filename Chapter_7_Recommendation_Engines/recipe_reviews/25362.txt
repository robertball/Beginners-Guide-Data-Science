I was just wondering, if someone changes the recipe, by REMOVING four of the ingredients, and then adding an ingredient that is NOT on the recipe, how can there be a bad rating?  THAT was not the recipe listed.  Maybe people would like it if they followed the recipe.  
I do not know the person who created this recipe, I was just searching for one. And SO many times I see bad reviews, on the recipe but it had been 'adjusted'.  They just gave their OWN cooking a bad review, right?  
(Opening a can of worms, Hmmm?)
Sorry, just my 2 cents

A very good recipe.  I dropped the olives and exchanged the dry chicken gravy mix for the same amount of Lipton Cup-A-Soup Cream of Chicken instant soup mix, same quantity.  The main reason was because all of the gravy mixes had MSG and I refuse to add that to my food.  Secondarily it ended up giving it a better flavor and a slightly thicker sauce.

not a bad recipe ....may tend to be salty because of the gravy mix and olives ...try his: #1 rinse off the olives before adding and #2 add a cut potato to the crock, the potato absorbs some of the saltiness (this is a GREAT tip for all sauces that have ended up too salty)...

We loved this recipe.  How can anyone change 3-4 ingredients and then rate the recipe.  Get real folks, make the recipe as listed THEN rate it.

I made a few changes to this recipe and I was so happy with the results, the most important one was thickening the gravy which I thought was too thin by adding cornstarch and water and turning the crock pot on high for a few minutes after the dish was cooked. I used whole chicken breasts instead of cut into strips and they came out so tender. Also nixed the bacon bits. It was VERY delicious, healthy and hearty. I used a little less vinegar than the recipe called for and chose a quality balsamic vinegar. Served over rice, magnifique!

Excellent, just as the original recipe is written. You can substitute skinless/boneless chicken thighs for chicken breast, I have found this to be (maybe) even better and also more economical. Either way it is a very nice, rich tasting recipe.

If you like pickled things, you will like this recipe. As for me and my family... yuck!
And yes I followed the recipe exactly. I love things cooked in wine especially red wine, but I think the vinegar and green olives were over the top for me. I shall try some other recipes.

My husband and I didn't care for this recipe.  Cooking time is WAY TOO LONG.  I think 2-3 hours would be plenty.  There was also too much vinegar and my husband did not like the olives.  I would cut vinegar in half and then add 1 T sugar to cut the tartness of the tomatoes.  I won't be making this again.

We Love Green Olives, however, this is the first & Last time I'll slow cook them. Why do people change so many things in the recipe & then rate the recipe that they used? I made this recipe exact except for less cooking time. Chicken was very tender but we could not handle the overbearing olive flavor.

This was AWEFUL!!  WAY too much wine.  The chicken while tender, was a yucky grayish color, and tasted like red wine.  I threw it out after 2 bites and my boyfriend and I ordered a pizza. Sorry

Red wine, balsamic vinegar and Dijon mustard is a bad combination (especially with the olives).  I would not make this again.

I enjoyed it; all the ingredients are ones I like. I agree with other reviewers who say make the recipe as is, then rate it. I am tired of reading reviews where so many changes were made it doesn't resemble the original recipe. It does a disservice to the person who offered the recipe.

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I changed a few things.  I used kalamata olives instead of green, used the juice from the olives instead of the vinegar and replaced the wine and gravy mix with 3/4 cup water, 2 Tbsp. chicken base and 3-4 Tbsp. flour.  I served it with white rice and peas and it went over very well with my family of 5 (kids 11 and under).  I suspect this probably changes the taste of the original quite a bit but for those of us that don't have wine and balsamic vinegar on hand these changes work quite well, in my opinion. :o)  Thanks for the recipe.

This is an excellent one pot dish, with everything just going straight in the slow cooker for speed and ease. At the suggestion of another reviewer I rinsed the olives and placed a cut potato in the mix. Not a salty sauce at all. I did not have soup mix so made up 1/2 pint of chicken stock (did this for 3 people). I also had peppers rather than mushrooms and for the last half hour I included rice to mix in with it. This did take some of the lovely sauce away so next time I would cook this seperately.  I think the only other thing I would change would be to get diced/chopped tomatoes that have italian style herbs already mixed in for added flavour.

I'm smiling as I write this! I found this recipe and noted the varying reviews, including the submitter's description of it as a dish that blended good flavors. So, I had to do the experiment. I made it and cooked it exactly as written and made no comment to my guests (who are accustomed to trying new recipes and are very open to new flavor blends.) 

I was reminded that everyone seems to have a different "taster" gene! One thought it was OK but not good enough to eat again. One(a man)thought it was fermented tasting and horribly inedible. One liked it enough to take the leftovers home (she called and said she thought it was much better after she added chicken broth and some herbs to dilute some of the tang.) I think it would have been much better without the wine. 

Nevertheless, the person who submitted it probably got it from someone else who apparently thought it was good and a few others here agreed while some disagreed. I wonder if our vision and hearing are as individualized as our tasting and we just don't realize it?

I only used 1 tablespoon each of dijon mustard and balsamic vinegar because I was worried the taste would come out too bitter after cooking for so long. I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs (trimmed of all fat) because I think chicken breasts tend to dry out in the slow cooker and lose the chicken-y flavor. Otherwise I added everything as written in the recipe. Unlike some of the other reviews, we didn't think it was too salty at all, and javascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$ContentPlaceholder$edit$saveButton','')we really liked the taste of the olives - it was a good compliment to the other flavors. Pour over egg noodles or garlic mashed potatoes and serve with a simple green salad for a complete meal! :)

Remove the olives altogether.  I love olives but this is WAY too much.  It will fill your house with an acrid fog for the whole day and by dinner time you will not look forward to opening that slow cooker.

I didn't care too much for this recipe and the kids were pretty bored with it. I guess it was too different for them. They are all under 10. Not a kiddie food.

Easy and delicious! I didn't have green olives or bacon bits but didn't seem to be missing anything. I added garlic because I put it in everything. I cooked it on high for 3 hours and it came out perfect!

This recipe would work so much better with frozen chicken. I used fresh chicken and by the time the 6 hours were up, it had completely disintegrated. Also 1/2 cup wine is a bit too strong for my Asian taste. I made it for my cell group supper, all my Western friends loved it and all my Asian friends didn't.

My family loved this recipe.  It is very rich and flavorful.  I also made several minor adjustments to the recipe, only because I did not have the listed ingredients.

I used white wine instead of red, and brown gravy mix instead of chicken.  It was still excellent, but next time I will make it according to the original recipe.  I did not find the balsamic vinegar to be too strong, and the green olives gave it a great zip.  

If you want to leave out the vinegar and olives, you might as well just find a different recipe.

I know it really annoys some people when reviewers change the recipe around, but part of cooking is altering recipes to your tastes and what you have on hand. I always read the reviews to see what changes people may have made to improve the recipe. That being said, I was afraid this recipe would be too salty and acidic so I did change it. I used white wine, left out the olives and bacon, used 2 tablespoons yellow mustard, and half balsamic vinegar/half rice wine vinegar because rice wine vinegar is milder. I also used 1/2 pound fresh mushrooms and it turns out my packet of chicken gravy mix was half the size the recipe required. I'm glad I made the changes because while I didn't think it was too strongly flavored, my boyfriend did and I'm sure he would have hated it if I'd use the regular ingredients. It was pretty tart and acidic anyway, but I like that. I will make this again using the right amount of chicken gravy mix and whole chicken breasts!

Loved this recipe - hubby said it was one of his favorites!  I skipped the mushrooms and olives because we're not fans.  I also used thighs instead of breasts.  Used a 19 oz can of diced tomatoes.  Followed everything else and this had a very rich, deep flavor.  Enjoyed this very much!

Excellent dish!  I'm not a huge tomato fan, so I might use a smaller can of tomatoes next time.  Otherwise, it got a "do again" from the family!

I THOUGHT THIS RECIPE WAS TASTY..I LEFT OUT THE GREEN OLIVES AND USED CHICKEN BROTH INSTEAD OF WINE. I ALSO USED MUSHROOM BUTTONS(THEY WERE GOOD ALL ON THEIR OWN..I PICKED THROUGH SO I GOT MOST OF THEM)..I MADE INSTANT WHITE RICE AND GREEN BEANS AND IT WAS A GREAT MEAL.

I didn't cut the chicken into strips, but rather chunks and they were very tender and juicy. I omitted the olives and bacon bits, and the juice was fine without them. This is a pretty good recipe, but I would recommend tailoring it to your personal tastes for best results.

Boneless chicken breasts take a mere fifteen minutes to poach, so if you're going to make this recipe, you might as well save the hassle of getting out your slow cooker and doing it right on top of the stove. To give the dish more flavor, I used bone in chicken legs and thighs which I browned first. I had leftover gravy which I wanted to get rid of, so I used that in lieu of the gravy mix. I had unexpected company last night and altho I was a little nervous due to the many mixed reviews, I must say that I was proud to serve this. My company loved it and so did my family. Thank you Kimber!

I made this for a friend and it was a total hit with her and her family.  She has made it 3 times since.  For my own taste I would decrease the green olives a bit.  I like them, but the flavor is very powerful.

Way too vinegary - couldn't even eat it. Strange because my husband and I love balsamic vinegar and I love green olives. Maybe I did something wrong but I sure don't want to try it again! Sorry :(

I always follow the recipe frist time around. Next time I will NOT put the chicken in for the full 6 hours.  Strips of chicken cooking for 6 hours (especially breast meat) come out like sawdust.  Next time, they go in for the last hour.
Sauce has great flavor, I served over noodles.

I am surprised by the reviews that didn't like this recipe.  My husband and I thought it was delicious!  The meat was tender and flavorful.  We agreed that the olives really added zip and my husband hates green olives.

This just didn't work.  I reeked of red wine -- no subtlety of flavor.  I was able to salvage the chicken by burying it into casseroles, but eating the chicken by itsself was not an option for anyone in my household.

There are a lot of wonderful recipes on this website. Better Slow Cooker Robust Chicken is not one of them. I followed the recipe and was really disappointed in the result. The bacon, redwine, balsamic-mustard combination is too much.

I was very enthusiastic about this recipe because it included some of my favorite ingredients (olives, mustard, wine and balsamic vinegar). So I was really disappointed in the bitter taste. The chicken was tender which I attribute to reducing the cooking time to a little less than 4 hours. Additionally, the presentation was poor. The dish was not pleasant to look at.

This was good.  I didn't use the olives and used fresh mushrooms, instead of canned.  The red wine is what made this dish delicious.  We almost felt we were eating at a fancy bistro.  Nice dish, pretty presentation.  Would definately make it again.

After reading comments, I decided to make the recipe EXACTLY. My hubby and I like all ingredients listed and are willing to be adventurous. It smelled so bad.  I honestly think that the red wine was what pushed it over the top.

All and all pretty good, but chicken was very dry. 2nd time around I cooked it for 4 hours on low and was pleased. Served over plain white rice to soak up all the sauce.

This was a good recipe.  I did make a couple changes though. I don't like olives,  so I used green peppers instead. I used real bacon that I had crumbled, fresh tomatoes and instead of red wine, I used a rose wine.  I kept it in the slow cooker for only 5 hours, served it over rice and it tasted great!

It had a good flavor, but the wine was a little overpowering. When I make it again,
I will use less wine.  I also omiitted the olives and next time, will add onions.  
I served it over egg noodles which was good.

I tried this recipe after my friend recommended it. Now my husband and daughter (whose under 2) both enjoyed it, but I thought that the wine and balsamic vinegar were really overpowering. I agree with another reviewer that I would leave the bacon bits out and use as a garnish; possibly saute the chicken in some of the bacon fat with some herbs before tossing it in the crock pot. So I'm going to play around with this recipe until I like it as well...maybe change the wine used or use white balsamic vinegar instead of red? Thank you Kimber for posting this recipe.

To be honest, I thought it was a bit too much vinager when I set out to make this, but tried it anyway. Only change I made was black olives instead of green. It had too much twang for most of my family. We enjoyed the different taste, but won't be using the recipe again without some changes. If you have misgivings about too much vinegar taste, but otherwise like the look of the recipe, drop the vinagar and try it, as it was a very interesting mix. I served the sauce over egg noodles, and next time will use dark meat chicken.

This was really just not great.  It was kind of tangy, in a strange way, from the wine and vinegar and was too dry.  I just didn't like it much.  I had a friend try it and she didn't like it either.

Tried this tonight!  My husband & I really liked it!  I used white wine (no red), and had no gravy mix, so used Cream of Chicken soup (as suggested by others who reviewed previously). My husband had over rice, and I had over pasta.....YUMMY!  The olives are wonderful in it!  I would make it again...FOR SURE!

so-so reviews by the family ...they liked the sauce, for which I cut down on the wine and added chicken broth. However, the chicken was dry and according to husband had a faint lighter fluid taste

Wonderful Flavor!  Something different!! We both loved it.  The only difference is I didnt have chicken gravy mix, so I used beef!  And I only cooked for 5 hrs on low.
I served over mashed potatoes w/broccoli

Very good chicken recipe.  My husband was very happy to eat the leftovers for lunch.    Recipes that incorporate wine in them call for a sophisticated palette, so if you don't like wine, you won't like this recipe.

I was so excited to make this recipe but turned out to be disappointed with the results. The sauce tastes as though it would best compliment beef rather than chicken, but I guess that's my personal preference. The chicken also turned out pretty dry considering it was in the slow cooker for 6 hours.

This is an excellent slow cooker recipe.  Just fantastic!  I used a full chicken--over five pounds--and scaled the ingredients up so there would be enough sauce (gravy?)--and the taste was perfect.  The chicken slid off of the bone so easily.  This is a truly great recipe!

I really liked this dish.  I made a few modifications to it.. maily because I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used a regualr borwn gravy instead of chicken gravy.  I didn't have any red wine, and wasn't able to get to the store (plus I don't LIKE red wine) so I used a blush wine instead and adjusted the amount so that the juices covered the meat to keep it from drying out.  I served it over rice... but was wishing I had some pasta or mashed potatoes for the "gravy".  Yummy!

Good recipe but a little less spicy than we like. I added chipolte powder and it had a lot of kick to it. 
I'd make it again.

Really tasty...I think I'd up the other ingredients to make a sauce for pasta.  I love green olives so I'll be putting more in next time along with more mushrooms.

I didn't care for this.  I think the red wine made it seem like the meat used should have been beef.  The flavor was good, but the texture of the chicken in the dish didn't seem right.

When she says ROBUST she means ROBUST.  I don't know if it was the wine that I used, but it was overpowering.  IF I make it again (and that's a big IF), I'll decrease the amount of wine and vinegar.  I substituted black olives for green, since my son likes them better.  The chicken was also really dry-- tender, but dry.  The flavors were so strong, this might be better with beef.  It's definitely robust!

I did not use all the ingredients listed, because my family does not care for them.  I left out the bacon bits, mushrooms and olives.  Also, instead of using the balsamic vinegar (since other peoples' review mentioned they did not like the flavor), I simply used the liquid from the canned tomatoes instead; added the can undrained.  Also, a short while before serving, I added about 2 tablespoons of sour cream to it to thicken it up and get a creamier flavor.  We served the chicken and sauce over noodles.  It had a pretty good flavor, but picky eaters probably wouldn't enjoy it.  I'll probably make it again occassionally, but will probably play around with the ingredients to get a better flavor.

It is an OK dish. Very easy to make – chicken is really tender and full of flavor. It was not the most delicious meal, but it was good enough for a family dinner. I did not use any vine and substituted balsamic vinegar with balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing. Taking in consideration other reviews I also added sugar and added only ½ of green olives. I would probably make it again.

Overall this was a delicious recipe.  I served it over rice.  However, the teenagers only thought it was okay, and the six year old tasted it and absolutely refused to eat it.  This is definately more of an adult taste.

I don't know if I did something wrong or if I bought a smaller chicken but the meat was extremely dry. It fell off the bones alright but it was not juicy. I did use the meat to later make "Gram's Chicken Pot Pie" and it was spectacular.

My husband loved this, I didn't think much of it.  It was easy, but the balsamic vinegar takes over the flavor.  Also I think I'd serve the bacon bits on top as we couldn't taste them in the mix.

My family absolutely loves this recipe. I follow the recipe exactly and the flavors meld together into a delicious thick sauce. It's a wonderful hearty meal served over egg noodles or pasta for these colder fall days. I cooked whole chicken breasts in the crockpot for 4 hours on low and then right before serving cut into bite-size pieces. The chicken was moist and juicy.

We thought this was very good.  My husband particularly liked it which was good as I got the stomach flu the next day and couldn't help with the leftovers!  He ate it for three days and still said he would like me to make it again sometime!!

I followed this recipe exactly. It was too bitter for our liking. I tasted it and couldn't eat it. My husband ate a bit more than I did. I'm not sure if it was the balsamic or the wine that pushed it over the top - perhaps it was the combo of the two.

Really good!  I added water chestnuts in the last 10 minutes of cooking, and a package of dried Lipton onion flavoring - and it was really, really good!  I would recommend!  
I agree with a previous writer, it did seem to cook quicker than 6 hours... done in about 4 on low.

Vinegar flavor too strong. Made it twice, second time with less vinegar that recipe called for. Still mediocre.  Won't make again.

knowing that the strips of chicken would be dry if cooked too long, I stuck with the 6 hour cooking time and it was wayyyy overcooked. It was also a bit "pungent" in flavor. Perhaps less balsamic vinegar?

A wonderful recipe that even my pickiest child ate, and he does not like chicken. I did substitute the chicken breast strips with chicken quarters, the balsamic vinegar with apple cider vinegar, and gravy mix with 1 can of cream of celery soup (we had to use what was in our cupboard and freezer). Simply wonderful.

This was really good.  I used a whole chicken and I think this added a ton a flavor.  I surved it over rice and everyone enjoyed.

This was okay.  Not great, but not the worst thing I've ever tased.  I tried to freeze some for leftovers, though, and that did not work out well!  This is not suitable for freezing.

This recipe is unique, that is what drew me to it. I've found some different recipes that end up becoming some of my favorites. Unfortunately, this is not one. I cooked it for half the time suggested by the submitter and the chicken was perfect, tender, not dry. But I HATED the sauce. It turned an unappealing prunish color and just tasted way too much like wine. And the green olives gave it a bad taste (and I LOVE green olives). This is one you will love or hate.

The chicken came out good.  The flavor was nice.  Not too strong as others had mentioned.  With as much sauce as there was, I might also suggest serving over rice or pasta.  Very easy recipe to create.

I used whole chicken breasts, cut down on the wine and vinegar and left out the mushrooms.  I didn't like the smell of this while it was cooking but the chicken was pretty good.  I didn't use the sauce after it cooked though.  The smell just turned me off.

Very good.  Love the flavor.  We don't care for olives, so I substituted them with onion.  I couldn't find balsamic vinegar so I used balsamic vinegarette instead.   I did find a chicken gravy mix with no MSG.  I also used jar mushrooms instead of can.  I doubt there is a difference.  We really enjoyed it and so easy.  I put everything together in a bowl over night and put it in the crocket pot on low for 8 hours before I went to work.

I followed the recipe and found the vinegar added way too much acidity.
