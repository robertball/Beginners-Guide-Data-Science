These were very tasty and easy- I made them right to the recipe.  I made sure my cream cheese was at room tempurature.  I mixed everything but the grated cheese together with my mixer, then folded in the cheese.  I did use a little too much mixture on the first few tortilla's as I came out short on mixture.  So next time I will measure a little better as to how much goes on each one.  I will also try some chopped green onion.  This recipe makes a lot - perfect for a party where you are doing all the appetizer's.  My party everyone brought something, many brought two items.... way too much food, and yet these still got half eaten.  I will make again.  NOTE:  if you have a very sharp serrated knife you dont have to refrigerate the rolls before cutting if you are careful... I didnt and they were perfect - I have excellent knives too though.

What a hit!!  I  made these last minute and they were the best roll-ups ever.  Different from the same ole, same ole.  I had alot of people asking me to email them the recipe.  Thanks.  I've already been asked to make these again in a couple of days for a church dinner.

I didn't have any picante so I used canned tomatoes and garlic added some tobasco and ran it through the food processor to make it smooth.--Worked fine.  I initially served these at a dinner party about an hour and a half or 2 hours after making them.  They were really just so-so.  The next day I went to dinner at a family member's house and I had some rolls leftover that I hadn't cut up yet.  I cut those up and brought them.  Much better the next day!!!!  I really think these need to sit overnight to get the cream cheese more solid as well as to have all the flavors meld together.

I've made these several times for get-togethers and special occasions, and I get great compliments every time.  I don't make any changes at all to the recipe, and I separate the filling into eight portions before I start so I know I'm getting the right amount on each tortilla. I always keep the 'ugly' cuts off the ends of the rolls for myself and snack on them all week after I make these.  It's usually the only way I get any leftovers!

I tweaked the recipe slightly. I omit the onion soup mix and I add refried beans. These are always the first to go at a party. So good!!

I took these to a Christmas party and left with nothing but an empty platter.  Everyone loved these!  I did change a few things to accommodate my tastes.  I used (1) 2.25 oz can of olives and (1) 4.5oz can of green chiles.  I also used one whole cup of picante sauce.  These are so easy & so tasty!

They are ok, I had to add some green onion, garlic and a little bit of cumin to make it taste better and not to taste the cream cheese. people raved at our church dinner about them..Needless to say they were all gone.

The flavor was great but it just seemed to be missing something. My husband thought it just didn't seem right eating it cold so I added the rest into homemade burritos-YUM!

I was so excited to try this recipe, but it was not a crowd favorite. I might have put too much on each tortilla, but it was very strong and I couldn't eat more than one. I had about 25 people over for a Christmas party and I had almost all of these left over and had to waste them.

Awesome!  My hubby LOVED these!  My daughter wouldn't eat them, but she's only two (and VERY picky), so....
Anyway, it's a great little snack or party treat.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were simple and I received rave reviews. I didn't change a thing and they were the first things to disappear.
