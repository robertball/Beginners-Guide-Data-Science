This is incredible.  I ordered a ham for Christmas dinner and it didn't show up so I had to improvise.  I ran to the store and picked up a pork roast and then jumped on my Allrecipes.  What a hit.  The only thing I did different was to cook it in the slow cooker.

I cut out all the sweetener because the jellied cranberry sauce is sweet enough.  I also increased the cranberry juice and used light cranberry juice.  I cooked it in the slow cooker instead of the oven.  Don't neglect the sauce, because pork roast is essentially tasteless unless it's seasoned somehow.

I cut this recipe in half, except for the mustard powder and the ground cloves. This helped balance out the sweet taste. I also used regular sugar instead of Splenda, since Splenda is sweeter, and the previous comments stated that this recipe was very sweet. My family enjoyed this recipe overall, and requested that I make it again!

I only had a 7lb pork roast bone in.  So I doubled the recipe and cooked longer.  It was wonderful.  The entire family loved it.  Had a really great flavor.  Nancy

Wile the cranberry gave the pork a good flavor it was the only flavor it had and was a little simple tasting, I also had a tuff time getting glaze to stick to roast.

I've made this with a different twist. I used whole cranberry sauce and added some hot sauce and onions.  You can thicken the cranberry sauce with cornstarch like gravy.  yum

Loved this roast! It was great to try something different with a pork roast! I just sliced the roast and put it in the slow cooker and added salt, pepper, and a can of crannberry sauce on top and cooked on slow for 6 hours! It was so sweet and delious! Perfect with mashed potatoes!
