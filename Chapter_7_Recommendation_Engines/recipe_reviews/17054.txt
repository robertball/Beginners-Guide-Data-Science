Good but I found it neither sweet nor gooey.  Too much soy sauce not enough brown sugar.  Next time, I would cut the amount of soy sauce in half oto 1/4 cup, double the amount of brown sugar and then add about 1/4 cup of ketchup.  The ketchup will thicken it up to add the aspired "gooeyiness".

I tried this recipe for a party and it got fair reviews.  I thought the taste was o.k. but the wings never really formed a glaze.  They were not all that sweet either and had more of the soy sauce taste.  Normally chicken wings go over big but this time I had leftovers.  Sorry, I probably will not make this again.

I already had 3 lbs. of chicken wings in my fridge, so I decided to double this recipe - and it worked like a charm. I also substitued ground ginger instead of fresh. 1/8 tsp. ground = 1 Tbsp. fresh; I added a tiny pinch, but you'd need even less than that if you aren't doubling the recipe. The sauce never really thickened to a "gooey" consistancy, but maybe I just needed to keep it in the oven longer ... I ended up pouring the marinade over steamed white rice & serving  as a side dish. 

Chicken turned out tender, sweet, and delicious, and the whole meal disappeared within minutes. I'd have given it a higher rating, but for the fact that you have to marinade the wings for 4+ hours.

I doubled the ingredients in this recipe, and it made more than enough marinade for 4 lbs of wings.

Marinating the wings overnight in the fridge gave them an amazing color, even before baking.  I also used a baster to remove about a cup of the marinade before putting them in the oven, because I was afraid it would bubble over and make a mess.  

I baked them uncovered, 45 minutes, turned them, then baked another 30 minutes in a 350 oven. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the wings were a beautiful color, and sweet and gooey as promised. Will keep this recipe!

My boyfriend and I loved these! I followed the ingredients exactly, except I didnt have 2 hours to cook them so I cooked them at 375 for 30 mins covered and 15 mins uncovered and they came out perfect!
The flavor is excellent and tenderizes the meat beautifully, "fell off the bone".
Will absolutely make these again!

This was good but I reduced the time to 2 hours in the fridge.Once it was cooked I then drained the sauce, added enough pure maple syrup and cooked until gooey...about 10-15 minutes at 400(have to watch them though)

I've been making chicken wings something like this for a long time.  I don't add oil to the marinade.  I use a 10oz. bottle of Kikkoman soy, two cups of brown sugar, garlic powder (as much or little as you want) and ginger (again, as much or as little as you like.  I mix everything together in a bowl.  I buy Perdue wingettes and lay them in a large foil roasting pan (like the one you'd use for a large turkey).  I don't use my own pan because I did it once and the clean up still gives me the chills.  This way, the foil pan is deep enough for me to baste without it going everywhere in the oven and I don't have to be careful about splashing or anything else.  And it's great to be able to throw it out afterwards. Make sure you taste the marinade before you pour it over the wingettes.  Just make sure you can taste both the sweet and salt and that one taste isn't overpowering over the other.  The marinade should be on the thick side.  It will loosen up as it gets hot.  Bake at 350 from anywhere to 3 to 4 hours.  The times that I've been rushed and have cooked them for only an hour or two, they've never been gooey.  The longer they're in, the gooier they get.  These wings have always gone over well.

Any recipe that gets my 18mth old to eat meat is AWESOME and my 4yr old loved them too. I did brown the drumettes in a little oil(which cut the cooking time in half)while I was making the marinade. And I also added about two to three tablespoons of lemon juice. But overall great recipe, will use again!!

I was looking for a wing recipe for Super Bowl and decided to try this one out.  Recipe was easy to follow but this one didn't work for me and my family...too salty, not sweet or sticky enough.

Per other peoples' reviews, instead of adding the soy sauce (which, I actually used gluten free soy sauce) and brown sugar as called for, I changed the ratio of brown sugar to soy sauce to be more like a 2:1.  I also tested the sauce before adding it.  My advice is definitely watch the amount of soy sauce because its SO salty!  If you add more sugar than soy sauce, you get a wonderfully gooey-salty-sweet flavor that sticks with the wings.  I added some sprinkles of ground ginger and more like 1 teaspoon of garlic powder.  I mixed the ingredients in a bowl and lined my pan with heavy duty foil.  Clean up was wicked easy and the leftovers?  NONE!!!  Another great gluten free recipe - thanks!

I have found a better way. When you first make the mix, the brown sugar should be at least (if not a little bit more) than the amount of soy sauce. Also, I found out by accident when we had a menu change, that marinating over night really made a positive difference. Turn frequently when marinating. When oven is preheated, sprinkle a very generous amount of brown sugar over the wings. Bake covered at 350 for 45 mins. then uncovered 30-40 mins. Turn a few times. Can increase to 375 or more to crisp for the last 10-15 mins.

Amazing!! They were perfectly sweet and gooey. I felt the need to alter the cooking process, due to the other reviews. I baked them at 400 f degrees for 45-50 minutes. I then broiled them for the next 15-20 minutes turning often, this helped the sauce coat and stick to the wings.

I'll try this recipe very soon as it sounds good.  Someone wrote they used the remainder of the marinade poured over rice.  I would remind everyone that raw chicken, its juices and marinades as well as anything it has touched must be cooked or cleaned thoroughly.  Uncooked chicken and its juices WILL make you ill.  I get great ideas from this forum.  Thanks a bunch!

I can't take credit for this as my friend told me about this recipe on this site, and the chicken wings are outstanding.  However, I made a few adjustments.  First instead of using a 1/2 a cup of soy sauce that the recipe calls for (which is too saltly), I used 1/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce.  I also used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar instead of the 1/4 cup of brown that the recipe calls for.  In addition to the recipe I added 1 big squirt of Heinz ketchup to the mix (about a 2 sec. squirt).  The wings are great.    No need to marinate for 4hrs unless you want to.  I've marinated for as little as 1 1/2 hours and it was perfect.    Definitely will make again, great for appetizers, superbowl parties, etc.

I have made these wings about a half dozen times since finding this recipe. I've experimented with everything from low sodium soy to powdered ginger and every time it comes out delicious. One thing I noticed was happening, however was that the wings would have too much liquid in the pan and not always "crisp" up enough. My solution is to cook for the initial 45-50 minutes uncovered, then drain off some of the liquid and cook for another 20 minutes, flip them, and another 20 mins. I'm telling you- I've taken these to multiple events and they go over well each time, and my boyfriend cannot get enough- he always requests them! Delicious :-)

These were really very good.  I let mine marinade for about 6 hours.  They were so tender and juicy, and tasted great.  My guests and husband loved them.  The only low rating I gave them was quickness.  They're very easy, but they took almost 2 hours to bake and get nice and brown.  Well worth the wait though.  I'll use this recipe again.

I omitted the oil as I think chicken wings have enough fat in them, Used fresh minced garlic, doubled the recipe and cooked them on the BBQ. Could use a bit more brown sugar.

Wonderful!  My family loved these.  I did add corn starch to the sauce to make it thicker and baked uncovered for the last 20 minutes or so, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  A keeper for sure!

This chicken recipe came out delicious. I used a big ziplock bag to marinate the chicken instead of a casserole dish. I made the marinade the night before and put the chicken in the ziplock bag and made sure the chicken was in one single layer and put in the fridge overnight. Then in the morning before I went to work, I flipped the bag over to coat the other side and let that marinate while I was at work, and cooked it when I got home. I put the chicken and the marinade in a casserole dish and stuck it in the oven as directed. It was so good! Full of flavor! I'm making it again with full chicken legs! Thank you for this delicious recipe!

This was good, I doubled the recipe cause I had more chicken. I also did 1/2 cup soy and 1/2 cup teriyaki, instead of all soy sauce. I also added 2 tbsp of molasses. I cooked them in the slow cooker all day instead of the oven. Yummy taste!!! Thanks

I made this for a birthday party. Unfortunately the recipe was neither sweet or gooey, the soy taste was very overpowering. I would make it again for me and my husband, but I didn't find this recipe company worthy.

I agree with others that have tried this recipe...it definitely isn't gooey. It is very delicious though! My husband and kids thought they were awesome. I did follow some suggestions and cut down on the soy and added more brown sugar. I also doubled the recipe since I had a little over 3lbs of wings. Great recipe!!

Too much soy sauce, not enough brown sugar. It looked like such an easy and delicious recipe that I jumped at the chance to present it to my family, though I was disappointed. Doubling the brown sugar, left it still too salty, though it seems like with some serious tweaking it could yeild a decent teriyaki.

NO....NO....NO....!!!!!   MIX ALL IN LARGE PLASTIC BAG SUCH AS ZIP LOCK, MARINATE IN THAT AND SAVE THE GOOEY MESS IN THE PAN WHILE IN THE FRIDGE. SAVES SPACE TOO.  SMOOSH IN THE BAG B/4 PLACING IN FRIDGE TO MARINATE.  AND A TOUCH OF APPLE CIDER VINEGAR WON'T HURT. OTHER THAN THE MESS, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS.

It turned out amazing juicy and tender! Two big thumbs up :) I followed the other users' suggestions and used less soy sauce and added about 1/4 cup of ketchup to make the sauce more gooey. I also replaced vegetable oil with olive oil. I was also short on time, so I only marinated at room temperature for 2 hours, and then baked it covered at 375 F for 45 minutes, and then uncovered for 15 minutes. It turned out WONDERFULLY. Will definitely try this recipe again!

I think this could use more acid--next time I might add some lime juice--but certainly easy and a great texture.

FANTASTIC RECIPE!!!
I made a double-batch of these for a party on Saturday, and they were gone before my fiance even got there.  His best friend ate them ALL and begged me to go back to the store and get more.

I did make two ***SMALL*** changes: Because of the amount of soy sauce, I added an extra 1/4 cup packed sugar. Also, after the 50 minutes uncovered cooking time was up, I turned the oven off and let them continue to bake for another 15 minutes.  The extra sugar makes them good and gooey after you pull them out of the sauce and they start to cool.

I had wings similar to these at the Super Bowl party that we went to, I loved them so much that I searched for a similar recipe and these tasted just like them. I made them yesterday to take to a dinner party as an appetizer, but I didn't want to share.  I will be making these again for sure, this time for just my husband and I to enjoy!  Thanks for the great recipe.

These were very good ~ I did make a few changes, though ~ Instead of soy sauce I used Teriyaki sauce and instead of garlic powder, I used minced garlic cloves. Thanks for such a wonderful and easy recipe!

What a delicious recipe and a HUGE hit at both an office party and a family party we has last night! Every single wing was gone. However, I did change up the recipe slighly. I simply added an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar to tone down the saltyness of the soy sauce. This recipe is perfect for parties and get togethers because once they are cooked you just toss them is a crock and watch them disappear! Way to go Jilly on posting this one:)

I used a reduced salt soy sauce & halved the amount of soy sauce. I used ginger powder, only because I forgot to buy fresh ginger at the grocery store. I was in a hurry, so I boiled the wings first to reduce cooking time & skipped marinating. Wings were very tender, fell off the bone and the sauce formed a great glaze. Delicious. My picky 4 year old said, "this is what I've always expected chicken to taste like."
I'm definitely cooking again!

I made this recipe for wings for our New Year's Eve party and everyone raved about the wings and sauce! I marinated the wings overnight and cooked them in our slo-cooker. That way, we could keep them warm in the sauce and people could enjoy them all night long. My sauce never did really form a glaze - but very tasty. My husband ate the leftovers with a side of rice - and if my husband eats leftovers - you know it must be good! Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I marinated them overnight, turning them once. Cooked them long and slow, foil wrapped for 2 hours at 300 degrees. Finished them up with a quick cook on the grill (1-2 minutes tops!). Too long on the grill will burn the sugar in the sauce. My husband usually lays them all down, lets them sit for 30 seconds, then flips them over. Really quick

Simply delicious, and easy to make.  The only change I made to this recipe was to use 1/2 of Tamari sauce and 1/2 of soy sauce. The Tamari sauce is less salty then the soy sauce, but not as tasty, so I just do 1/2 and 1/2 whenever a recipe asks for soy sauce.  The cooking time was perfect, the meat fell of the bone, but it wasn't dry at all.  Just have to remember to marinate the wings at least 4 hours before cooking, can't be one of those last minute recipes, but it is sooo worth it.

I trid this recipe and I found it entirely too salty. I will not try it again. With a recipe that needs so many alterations, (low sodium soy sauce, less chili, more chili, more garlic, more brown sugar,etc.) does it really deserve such a high rating?

This was delicious!  I was a bit skeptical because it seemes so easy which it was.  But the brown sugar made the dish.  The sauce was great over white rice as well.  The only reason I did not gove it a 5 was because it wasn't that gooey.  I recommend letting it sit out for 15-20 minutes before serving because the flavor gets alot better.  What I also did was put everything in foil and wrap it up for the first 45 minutes and the chicken was falling off the bone since it was almost steamed.  Added more garlic as well.  The last 50 minutes I took off the foil from the top so it browned real well.  Will make again.

Made these a little quicker. Did not have time to marinate so I boiled the wings in the marinade. Once they were cooked I just finished them off in the oven, using the marinade as a glaze. They became nice and gooey. Big hit at a party! Thanks, Ron

Great overall recipe.  I made some changes to mine because I prefer a kick.  Also - some reviewers said that their wings were too salty;  I used low sodium soy and it turned out perfect.

My changes were:
1/2 teaspoon of ground cayenne
1/2 teaspoon of chilli poweder
dash of chilli flakes
1 teaspoon of chilli paste
and I increased the ginger to 2 teaspoons.

And even though this sounds like it is ULTRA hot - it actually isn't.  It has a nice kick, but not so much that you can't eat them.

My guests adored it.

Also - in response to it not getting gooey - this is true, but the flavor is great nonetheless.  Also, I found that if you toss the wings in the cooked sauce and let stand for a while, this does add to the gooeyness factor!  Hope this helped!!

This was great, I added ketchup, garlic and onions to the mix. I baked it then placed it in a crock pot for the football game. Everyone loved them and they were so simple to make.

This is similar to a family recipe I make all the time. I say eliminate the oil. You don't need it. I never use any, and mine always come out sticky (in a good way). Also I add just a 1/4 tsp of mustard to my marinade. I also don't know that they need to be covered.

I was just trying something diffrent, I didn't really think they would turn out good so I only made a few.  Those few came out so good.  It gooed up a little less then I like, but they were great.  I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy.  My mother used worcestershine sauce she said hers didn't goo up, but were good and tasted like sesame chicken

Love them it tried them just a few minutes ago and they were great.
Only thing I did different was left out the ginger and put them in a ziplock bag and let them sit in the marinade over night. Everyone loved them!!!!!

A beautiful looking--gooey wing, as promised.  I followed the recipe to a T and the whole family loved them.  I have tried a variety of recipes with a soy sauce base and this one is great but it's not my favorite so I gave it a 4-star rating.

About 1/3 cups soy sauce and 1/3 cups brown sugar was just right. I like to do these in the crock pot. Put them in on high until mostly cooked, drain out the juice, then add the sauce, turning the chicken every few minutes so they all get coated.

These wings literally flew away at our Super Bowl party!! I made 5lbs so I tripled the recipe. I decided to marinate them overnight and the meat was LITERALLY falling off the bone. So if you don't love wings but can't stand the constant clean up of eating them, marinate them overnight and with no work from a fork, you can eat them hands free. I also used a disposable casserole because it was easier clean up.

This recipe is great on its own, but also perfect for adjusting and experimenting. I've made it at least a dozen times, and finally feel like I've perfected my own version. Definitely try it with freshly grated or minced garlic, I always add a bit of molasses and a splash of sesame oil along with some red pepper flakes. For the people who said that the soy sauce was too salty: I suggest trying a mix of low sodium soy sauce and regular soy sauce. (You might even like it with only low sodium soy sauce but I found it rather bland.) 

Thank you for this recipe, it has become a staple at my house and gives me warm, nostalgic feelings remembering my mother making a similar recipe.

This is a good alternative to hot wings for people who don't like hot spicy food.  Whenever I make hotwings, I make this dish also.  My children love it every time I make it, it's always a hit even with my picky eaters.

I used this recipe tonight. I did the exact recipe except I didn't use any ginger (not a fan) and I used chicken tenders instead of chicken wings. 
Marinaded then in the fridge for about 5 hours. Kept flipping them every 30 minutes. By the time it was ready to cook I cut up the chicken tenders and cooked them in a WOK and made chicken vegetable stir fry!!! CAME OUT AWESOOOOOME!!!!! LOVE THIS Recipe!!! :)))

I followed the directions as written.  These are very good wings.  They are easy to whip up.  They were not sweet to me as written.  I think I'll kick up the brown sugar next time.  Definitely  would make these again.

This recipe is  way  to salty not sweet or spicy enough. The ginger should have given it a bit of a kick. I cooked it exactly to the recipe's specifications and the sauce never got sticky, it just stayed really soupy and the whole meal was like a salt lick. It was just awful.

These are so good we've had them twice this week. Added a bit more garlic and a dash of hot sauce.  UPDATE:I've now made them twice more and both times even though I made them the same exact way there was too much sauce and it didn't thicken or get gooey at all. The only difference was that I used legs instead.

I did the same amount of soy sauce and brown sugar and 1/2 cup of ketchup... still not as gooey as I would have like but they had an excellent flavor.  I also put in some sesame seeds.  Good Dish, I will make it again.

Simply delicious. Like others, I used less soy sauce and more brown sugar. I added some cayene pepper and next time will add more for some extra kick. These were fall-off-the-bone wonderful and will make them for an upcoming party. By the way, suggest removing the tips and splitting the wings for more servings.

Really good. I added a little honey and it made them a bit more stickey and sweet. I made them for the football season opener and they all seemed to disappear!

These wings were great.  I doubled the recipe and it still was enough for us.  I did use a little less soy sauce (low sodium ) and a little more brown sugar and it was so good. believe me if you are a chicken wing lover you need to make alot of these because they're great.

Im sorry but these wings were waaayyy too salty! Im very surprised it got such rave reviews. The base flavor was good but the saltiness made these wings barely edible. Maybe if low sodium soy was used it wouldve been better. Im sorry but I cant recommend this. I give it 2 stars for a good baseline taste.. only if I couldve enjoyed them. :(

These wings taste great, though they do take some effort. You have to mess with them frequently, so you can't make these on the fly--there wouldn't be time. But they are well worth the effort and have a wonderful flavor!

Great! Only thing, I added brown sugar on top before putting them in then again after flipping them. I've made this dish 3X and that seems to take care of the gooey part.

Made these last night for the Super Bowl. The sauce is wonderful! We actually couldn't get wings, so used drumsticks. My husband coated them in flour, salt & pepper and fried in oil just until crisped on the outside. Then put in a baking dish and poured sauce over, baked for 20 minutes, turned over and spooned sauce over and baked another 20 minutes. They were awesome! My boys LOVED them! (I didn't have fresh ginger on hand, so used 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger).

This recipe in all honesty i would not reccommend. There is no taste and the not nearly enough brown sugar., also it is not sweet and gooey. If you have a sweet n sour recipe i'd go with that, or tweak this one with your own extras btw i'd reccommend double up the brown sugar. Thumbs down on this one for me My family also did not like it.

I mixed the recipe as is and taste tested the sauce.  I found it to be way too salty for my liking, and lacking in the sweet department.  So I added about 1/4 cup water, and 2-3 tbsp of honey.  I cooked them covered for 45 mins, and uncovered for 20.  Removed wings from sauce and mixed in some corn starch to thincken, added wings back into sauce and put back into the oven at 375 for 10 mins.  Came out quite well.  I would cut the soy sauce in half and not add water.

Added around 1/8 cup hot sauce. Flavor was sweet, but needed more hotness. Not very gooey. We thought it would be better if cooked in the oven  until done and then throw on the grill until the outside was somewhat crispy.

Made the recipe with ground ginger, as I had no fresh - other than that, I made the marinade as called for.  However ... as the oven was busy, I made this on the stovetop, and it worked out great.  It was seriously gooey, as expected, and came out great.  I just turned the chicken every now and then, and added the marinade a little at a time until it was all in there.  Cooked until done - it was great!

Didn't like this so much.  It seemed to have way too much of a soy sauce taste.  I hate to be a negative one, but just didn't care for this too much.

I didn't have time to marinade as long, but these were still REALLY good!!  My hubby and kids couldn't get enough of these.  I did make extra sauce and kept basting the chicken with it during the cook time.  A keeper.

These were delish. I think next time I will double the amount of brown sugar and I also cooked them uncovered the whole time.

I used low sodium soy sauce and I still thought the sauce came out too salty and strong. Although, my kids did enjoy them.

The sweetness for these was more of an aftertaste, because all that soy sauce was all I could taste initially.  These weren't gooey either.  Will not be making them again.

These chicken wings came out very tasty. I tripled the recipe for my family of 6 (my husband and I, and our 4 boys), and they disappeared in a flash. My only complaint is that the sauce bubbled over the sides of my pan while I had the tin foil covering it, and made a huge mess inside my oven! And it wasn't that I used a shallow baking dish either. I wonder if anyone else had this problem?? I would have given these 5 stars if it weren't for the horrific clean up work that I had to do afterwards.

This is the third time I've made these.  They are nothing short of FABULOUS!  I flip them every half an hour and cook for three hours, one covered and two uncovered.  The last hour, you can see the gooeyness as you are flipping them.  Fall off the bone tender.  Excellent recipe, my family loves them!

These are really, really good.  I doubled the recipe and served then at a pool party this summer.  Mine did not get gooey or sticky but that didn't matter, the meat fell off the bone. The only thing I added was toasted sesame seeds sprinkled on top for presentation.  They looked and tasted great. There wasn't even one left over.

I made this for a Xmas office party it got rave reviews. I more than tripled everything to feed more people and it worked fine. Also I marinated overnight and baked the chicken uncovered longer for a little more stickiness.

Very easy to make, but not too gooey and not enough "spunk" to the taste...perhaps it was becasue I used Lite soy sauce (less salt).  I'll try regular soy sauce next time...and I don't know what to do about the non-gooeyness???

Terribly salty and not at all flavorful. Couldn't taste any sweetness and the garlic powder seems to have disappeared.

it was ok..maybe all my changes made it ok!!
Instead of garlic powder i used garlic cloves(2) and cut them tiny.
instead of ginger root i used candied ginger(5 small cubes)..soaked for 1/2 hour in hot water(!!!!) i used maple syrup as well as sugar and more soy sauce!!! they were sweet but not terribly sweet!!!

To avoid the soy sauce being overpowering, I bumped up the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also didn’t add oil, used ground ginger, and added 1/4 cup honey to add sweetness.  I cooked it exactly as the instructions said, and it turned out delicious and fall-off-the-bone!
