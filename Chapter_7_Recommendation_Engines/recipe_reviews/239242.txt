Nice! I really enjoyed this...a nice change from the usual recipes for chicken salad w/ mayo. Some other great additions would be chopped tomatoes and/or jalapeno peppers, which would make it more like a chicken guacamole I guess, lol. This is something I would make again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

I thought it was too heavy on the onion and not enough chicken, so I added more chicken.

I’m always on the lookout for a twist on the typical chicken salad.  I’m glad I come across this recipe.  It’s easy and delicious, not to mention healthy. I had a very large sweet onion, so I used just enough onion for our tastes.
