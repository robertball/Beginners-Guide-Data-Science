This was very good.  I didn't have All Spice so looked up a substitute for it online and it said to use 1/3 tsp ground cloves, 1/3 tsp ground cinnamon, and 1/3 tsp of nutmeg for replacing 1 tsp of all spice.  I did that and it turned out great.

I made this for my family over Thanksgiving and it was deemed "too sweet" by many.  I added half the brown sugar called for and would suggest that if you try this recipe you add the sugar in portions to taste.  The mulled spices smelled far better than the cider tasted.

The "I hate anything new" guys in my life(ages 3, 20ish, and 30ish) have judged this recipe a success. They say it tastes just like hot apple pie! I added about a tsp.of vanilla and about a 1/4 cup of honey for an even yummier taste. It tastes just like my Mom used to make when she'd bring those little cartons of mulling spices home.

I thought this was good - but a little on the sweet side. I had to add some boiled water to the crock pot to water it down after tasting it. Next time, I'll definitely cut back on the brown sugar.

I followed this recipe as closely as I could, since I didn't have cinnamon sticks, I had to sub in ground cinnamon (1/2 tsp. = 1 stick). Still tastes delicious, and I think my guests will love it. The smell is WONDERFUL!! I also did as someone else suggested and used coffee filters tied with string instead of cheesecloth.

This was very good. Tastes like apple pie. I did not have whole allspice so I just threw in a teaspoon of ground allspice. I would suggest tasting the cider before adding any sugar. Mine was perfect with out it.

I cut this in half but I kept the spices the same. This was a little sweet for me but my husband thought it was perfect. GREAT with a jigger or two of Fireball cinnamon whiskey as a fill in for hot toddy as my husband and I seem to have caught the Death Cold. Next time, I'll add the peel of one orange like the submitter suggested. I think I'll make this again tomorrow!

Very good! I brought it with us when we visited some friends, and they absolutely loved it.  It was too sweet, so I would only use half the sugar called for, if any at all.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and plan on making on Christmas... I only had 32oz of cidar, but I kept the spices the same because I simmered it in a pan for an hour instead of a crock pot. I reduced the sugar to 2 Tbs. Also, I didn't have cheese cloth, so I let the cinn sticks float around, and put the other spices in a tea ball. This makes the house smell great too!

This was very good!  When my parents came home from work they said that the house smelled so good!  Even my brother liked it, and he hardly ever likes anything that I make.  But I had to alter the measurements because of the amount of cider that I used; I had 33 fluid ounces instead of 64,  so I used  3/4 tsp of groud cinnamon, 2/3 tsp of ground allspice, 2/3 tsp of ground cloves and 1 tbsp of brown sugar.  I put the allspice and cloves into a coffe filter tied with string, just as another reviewer suggested.

This was great for a chilly evening fall party!!  I didn't have allspice so I used ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves with the cinnamon sticks.  I was sooo good my kids have asked for it many times!!! Way TOO EASY to throw together for fab reviews!!!

I made this to serve at my cookie exchange, and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I made no changes other than to double the recipe.  The only thing that would make this drink even better is some spiced rum.

Took this to the Christmas party for my kids' daycare, and everyone loved it -- both kids and adults!  So easy and so good.  Definitely a keeper.  I didn't have cheesecloth, so I used a coffee filter held closed with a rubber band, and it worked perfectly.

Great with a little bit of vanilla and nutmeg too. Works just as well with ground allspice and/or cloves if that's all you have on hand.  I made this for all my holiday parties. Serve with spiced rum or vodka.

I make it every winter to warm up.  It's super easy and everyone LOVES it!!  A tad on the sweet side, so I use 1/4C instead of 1/3C of brown sugar - which makes it perfect.  Enjoy!

I multiplied this recipe for 70 people for my local Christmas Downtown Extravaganza. We warmed it over a propane burner. What a huge success!! The temperature was around 40 and the wind was blowing. People were walking up looking for that "delicious smell". I've already received several requests for the recipe. I will definitely make it again next year!! Thank you!

First time I've ever tried making apple cider, and what a HIT!! Whata super base recipe. Everybody really enjoyed it, and there were no leftovers between 5 people :o . The only slight changes I made was using about 3/4 tsp of nutmeg because I didn't have allspice, and I didn't have cheesecloth either, so I put spices in a coffee filter, and tied it up. By the reviews, I added far less brown sugar (less than a 1/4 cup). Also, I added a little bit of orange peel to the cider directly, and served with a slice of orange. Delicious!! I don't like to rate a recipe after making lots of changes, but I really believe most of these spices are quite interchangeable, and the sugar can be added according to personal tastes, without affecting this base of a recipe. Will definitely make again!

Made this for a party and everyone raved about it.  I used a mesh tea ball instead of cheese cloth and substituted maple syrup for the brown sugar.  I also used two 50 oz jars of cider, which seemed good in proportion to the amount of syrup.  It was sweet and delicious but not overly sweet.  It was so perfect having it in the crockpot where it could stay warm for hours and was easily accessible.  I will definitely make this again.

This was great!  Did not need quite as much brown sugar because the cider is so sweet by itself.  Had a home made flavor.

I love this recipe! On cooler days and for holidays, this is PERFECT! (plus it makes your home smell heavenly!)  I use a loose leaf tea strainer ball to put the small spices in, and just let the cinammon sticks float. Cook on low all day - sugar and spices can be adjusted for personal taste. Enjoy!

Easy and Yummy!  We skip the sugar (no need) and brew it in a crock pot for 4 hours.  Make sure to take the spices out after that or it gets too strong.

I thought this was very good and not too sweet, although I have a somewhat stronger sweet tooth than many!  You can put the cloves and allspice in a tea strainer (like you use for loose leaf tea by the cup) if you don't have cheesecloth.

Spicy and tangy. I used the powdered version of the spices and let them just free float in the cider while cooking... then used cheesecloth to strain out the excess before serving. This made the flavor super rich.

This turned out great! I didn't have a cheesecloth and just put the spices in without and they were easy to avoid when filling drinks.

I made this for afternoon visits with family before Christmas Dinner.  We didn't find it too sweet.  I just put in the cinnamon sticks and whole cloves loose, then scooped them out with a slotted spoon just before serving.  And, we splashed in 1/2 - 3/4 cup Brandy which gave us all a nice, warm glow!

I liked this recipe.  I added a small piece of vanilla bean and orange juice to the cider and cut back just a little on the brown sugar.  I had 15 folks over for about 4 hours and they drank most of a large crockpot full.  My son who is 7 years old loved it and wants me to keep making it all winter.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe, I have been making my apple cider this way for years!  It has always been a success.  The recipe I use calls for 1/4 to 1/2 cup brown sugar so I've usually stuck with the 1/3 cup measurement.  While I think it's just perfect, we all have different tastes so start with a smaller amount of sugar first, you can always add more later.  My favorite way to make this is in the slow cooker... it keeps for hours and the whole house smells amazing!!  If there are any leftovers, I just let them cool to room temperature and then pour it into a pitcher and store in the fridge.  Just heat up mugs of cider individually and it tastes just as good... and fyi, it even tastes good cold!

This apple cider recipe is easy and very potluck friendly.  I also agree that the leftover cider is good cold or reheated.  One thing I like about this recipe is I can prep the spices at home and place the brown sugar in a baggie and then prepare this at the potluck or family dinner. I’ve traveled 130+ miles with the ingredients and what a hit this was with the family.  This recipe is easy, travels well and scrumptious.  Happy Cooking & Baking!

Great, easy Recipe! I have made this all winter and my husband drinks it all right up! I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup because it was a little strong for him. I used ground cinnamon instead of buying cinnamon sticks using the conversion of 1/2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon to one stick.  Also, I used ground allspice instead of the whole just because it is what I had bought. I still added a just one teaspoon of the ground allspice. Came out perfect!

Wow! Great cider (and so easy!!!). Made this tonight to go with the pumpkin pie I served for dessert at my family's "after Thanksgiving" dinner. This tastes just like apple pie. It IS sweet, so, if you do not care for sweet cider, this is not for you. My batch was EXTRA sweet because I decided to also add a 1/4 cup of honey (purchased in Antigua - West Indies good stuff!) and 1/2 t of vanilla extract (thanks Cher B for the great idea!). I was craving a sweet drink, not tart (like most traditional ciders are). My bf described this as "sweeter than apple juice"!!! My parents loved it. Altough I usually prepare a different cider recipe, I'll keep this one in my recipe file as well because it is quick to prepare, uses minimal ingredients and has that "apple pie" flavor that I love (my cider recipe does not - and takes much more effort to prepare). Thanks so much for sharing! I am drinking a mug of this right now : )

It's difficult to feel harvest time festive in Florida when it's still 88 degrees outside.  I served this  wonderful cider cold with orange slices to girlfriends during a Halloween Make-up Party.  Now we're waiting for a cold front so we can enjoy it warm. I served it with plain donuts that we fried together!

The wonderful aroma greeted my chilled-to-the-bone guests wonderfully (they were returning from a very cold viewing of our town's Christmas parade), but it was a bit sweet. The adults loved it; the children were not impressed. Still, this is a keeper because it is so easy to make. I'll just cut down on the sugar next time. Thank you for an easy way to bring Christmas cheer to the home!

Made it for my staff's annual holiday potluck. I added apple slices while it cooked. Then, I added whipped topping, caramel drizzle, and ground cinnamon as a topper. Staff LOVED it!!

I added a little orange rind zest. However the recipe is excellent. I just never give 5 stars, even to my own self.

I loved this cider but can't find whole allspice so had to use ground and do some sifting.  Froze it. Good to thaw it and heat it for a winter get together crowd

I made this the first time with ground spices because I didn't have whole ones. The second time I made it, I used the whole spices. Both versions turned out equally well.  It didn't have cheesecloth so I used my large tea diffuser with good results. Both times I had it in my crockpot for 3 hours on high.

This is so easy, and it tastes wonderful.  Put in a crockpot and we sipped all day.  Also added Butterscotch Schnapps and Spiced Rum to my cup.  Just the Rum is sufficient.

This was a hit on my Christmas Eve Brunch. I used a regular  Gallon Apple Cider you buy at a supermarket. And after reading some of the reviews, I did not add any sugar on this one & was glad I did. The cider was already so sweet even without  that sugar. Next time, I will try to use the coffee filter with ties trick. Thanks for sharing your recipe & Merry Christmas!

Very good, perfect for the holidays!!  I read the recipes and cut back on the brown sugar but then didn't find it quite sweet enough.  Next time I will use the amount called for in the recipe.

Absolutely delicious!! I am not a fan of Apple cider but bought some for a pork recipe I wanted to try and had leftover cider. I decided to make this and was so glad I did. Quick, easy & delicious. My entire family loved it , kids included (ages 4 & 5), as we took our hot mugs and sat by our outside fire pit. I even added a half shot of rum to my husbands which was out of this world yummy!!! I made the recipe exactly as written. No changes needed. Thank you!

We had a bonfire and I made this recipe. It was so easy! I did it on the stovetop and doubled it, using a gallon. I used crushed cloves instead of whole cloves. And it was perfect! I got so many compliments. Thank you!

Yum :) After reading the other reviews, I cut back on the sugar by a lot (1 tbsp for 4 servings) because as someone pointed out, people could still add sugar to taste. It was still really sweet! So I give it 4 stars (more like 3.5) because that amount seems high.

Delicious!  I think I liked it cold even better.  Used 1/4 cup sugar and added 1 tsp vanilla.  Didn't have whole allspice so used a bit of ground.  Great flavor, not too sweet or strong, just perfect!
