We went to a playoff hockey game tonight. We just got in, when at 11:45 at night hubby tells me he is craving apple pie a la mode. I get on allrecipes.com and look up apple cobbler and find this gem. I don't have apples but I do substitute a 21 oz. can of store brand apple pie filling for them. I made the rest of recipe as listed and baked in the microwave for 12 minutes. This was 5 minutes to prepare, 12 minutes to bake; it was delicious. This one is a new favorite of mine!!!! 10 stars for tasty, quick and easy (with the pie filling). Thank you!!!!! I will be submitting my picture of this dish.

This a great recipe! My family loved it!I found it very quick and easy to make. I didn't have allspice on hand so in place of the allspice I used 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. cloves. I will make this again. The only other thing I will do different the next time is cook it 10 minutes rather than 12 minutes.  With my microwave, 12 minutes made the topping a little on the hard side.

I liked that this recipe had few ingredients, and included oatmeal in the topping.  I used 6 small granny smith apples, instead of 4 large ones, and doubled the quantity of the topping.  Also added some nutmeg along with the cinnamon and allspice.  An apple corer saved a lot of time getting the peeled apples sliced (not too thin, or the filling turns to mush).  It all fit in an 8x8 clear glass baking dish.  I microwaved it for the full 12 minutes, and everything was cooked through and cooked evenly.  The topping was nice and chewy, not too dry in my opinion.

Might decrease the time just a bit for firmer apples next time, as well as use a little less butter and sugar.  I agree with a previous reviewer -- the topping did not really crumble, and had to be put in pats on top. 

With ice cream and extra ingredients, there was enough for 10-12 people.  A keeper!

I NEVER cook in the microwave (well...maybe popcorn), I only use it to warm things.  My 13 year daughter has recently started baking, came across this recipe, thought it sounded easy, and gave it a try.  It was WONDERFUL!  I can't believe it's cooked in the microwave.  The best part is that SHE can whip it up for me with no problem when we have company coming over!

Excellent recipe, turns out crispy on top. I do not melt the butter, I crumb it in with the flour and oatmeal, it comes out crispier this way.I have actually used this recipe for many years.

Very tasty!  This was much better than I expected for a microwave dish.  I used peanut butter instead of butter and it was delightful.

I decided to try this to use up some baked apples that I had made the night before. It was really good and reminded me of the kind I used to eat as a girl. The only thing I did differently was bake it about 2-3 minutes less since my apples were already done. I bet apple pie filling would be great to use too, will try that next time. Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was excellent -- I am not a big fan of "baking" in the microwave either but this was easy and really did turn out as described. My only suggestion is to make sure the apples are on the larger side...mine were a bit small.

UPDATE: I made this again today with the addition of walnuts and it was devine! Believe it or not, my apple crisp was done in 4 minutes! Next time I will try it with maple syrup. I'm changing the rating from 3 to 4. Also, I scaled the serving down to 2. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Make sure to know how strong your microwave is. I baked mine for 10 minutes and the granola burned and the apple pieces shriveled up. I had also added chopped walnuts for extra crunch. Will make again but will have to cut the time by a few minutes. I should have probably taken it out the moment it started smelling good. :-)

This recipe was in a MW book I bought 30 years ago and we have had it every couple of weeks.  We love it! 

Mine didn't however have allspice but I am sure it is just as good with it! My recipe also calls for 6 cups of apples.  I recently added some cranberries along with the apples and it was very good.

This is a really good recipe. I have made it several times with different fruits. I used canned cherry pie filling with quick oats.. yum I used canned apple not using sugar, with three packets of instant maple oatmeal. How awsome! ( I left out the sugar on the canned pie fillings) When I made it with fresh fruit (apples and cranberries) I slowly cooked the apples and cranberries on the stove top add splenda brown sugar and topped it with Apple instant oat meal WOW!  My hubby who is very picky LOVES this as much as I do. Gave the recipe to my kids and they love it too.

I had bought these 6 mini graham cracker pie crusts that I really wanted to use in an apple pie recipe, but my husband and I ended up using this recipe for the filler; what an amazingly delicious recipe this turned out to be!  We did split the flour, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon, and butter part in half (which we then mixed separately in a bowl, and would then use to coat the apple mix once we transferred it into the graham cracker crusts.  We ended up nuking the initial apple mix for 6 minutes, then baked it in the mini crusts for 10 minutes at 350°F.  SO GOOD.  I had mine with a bit of caramel sauce, and my hubby had one mini pie with whipped cream, followed immediately by a second one with vanilla ice cream.  I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone!  :)  Thank you for sharing!

Made this last night after returning from the apple orchard with a TON of apples. Was tired and wanted something quick. I gave it five stars because it was pretty simple, and quick to make, plus it tasted surprisingly good seeing as it was made in the microwave! The taste was about 4.5 stars, but the simplicity makes it a five! Would make this again in a pinch. I made it in a pie plate, and would recommend putting a plate below that like I did as it tends to boil over, or use the square pan as suggested in the recipe.

Quick, fresh and delicious dessert. I used 3 large tasty honey crisp apples and only about 1/2 of the topping. Didn't peel the apples for health and ease which adds  texture. Could easily substitute Equal or other artificial sugar. Nuked for 11 minutes which was just about right, just a little mushy. Caution: everyone's creations and microwaves are different, so start checking at 7 minutes or less.

Topping was mushy, so I cooked longer but then it became chewy and more tough than crispy and by then the apples were mushy. The topping was also too sugary. I think I will stick to oven recipes from now on.

This was good for a quick, must have apple crisp, fix.  It turned out more like applesauce with a crumble on top.  I have to eat it with vanilla icecream and caramel sauce.  Best Ever Carmel Apple Crisp from this site is amazing but like I said, need it fast...use this recipe.

This recipe was okay for using some old apples and not turning on the oven.  I'd make it again when I want a quick and easy version, but there are better apple cobbler/crisp recipes out there.

Great recipe!  I used pre-cut apples slices from Sam's that I had in the fridge. For the topping, I used 1/2 stick butter (all i had), white sugar (didn't have brown), 2 packets of instant original oatmeal, and the 1/2 cup flour, allspice and cinnamon.  Microwaved about 15 min because it is not a high powered one.  Was very good in a little time with things I had on hand.  ....love when that happens!

This is suprisingly really good.. We are doing a kitchen renovation and only have a microwave to cook in.  After apple picking, I needed to find recipes to use the apples without an over.. this is PERFECT!  I made it with and without the All Spice and it was good either way.

Wanted something quick and easy for breakfast before work. This worked great! Scaled the recipe down to one serving and reduced cooking time to 3 mins. Could probably reduced cooking time a little bit more, as apples were a little mushy. But still tasted great! Love the tart taste of the Granny Smith with the sweet brown sugar topping.

This was good for a QUICK crisp, however the topping did not come out "crisp".  It was more chewy than crunchy and crisp.  Good for a quick dessert.

Yum! I, too, am not a fan of microwave cooking, but wanted a crisp that wouldn't take 40 minutes in the oven. This is surprisingly good and I'd do this again! Thanks for sharing this!

I used one apple and doubled the crisp and it was delicious! I only microwaved it for 7 minutes and it was done but that may be differences in microwaves. Great, easy recipe!!

This is the same recipe from the old Tappan Microwave cookbook. My mother made it all the time in the fall as I was growing up. Everyone who has had it just loves it and the best part is you can't tell it that was baked in the microwave.

Ovens are a rare commodity in China (where I'm currently living) so I was so excited to come across this recipe. I made it yesterday and it was so delicious! It's even great the next day, cold (eating right now!). Instead of allspice, I added a pinch of clove, and I added a drop of vanilla into the butter before mixing it. I also topped it after cooking with some granola to get that oven crunch. Worked out pretty well. And it was so quick and easy! Thanks!!

Just tried this recipe. Yummy! I had loads of apple at home, but didnt know what to do with them so this was just perfect.
It tasted wonderful, and even better with a scoop of almond ice cream :D

I made it with two Fuji apples and in a Pyrex like another reviewer.  I used the recipe scaling feature to reduce the recipe.  I reduced the butter by 1 T. and cooked it for 10 minutes.  The top crust was dry, but overall the recipe was good.  Very, very sweet.

I was looking for a quick dessert, and found this.  I may have rated it higher, but the topping was too creamy to crumble over the top of the apples.  Any suggestions?

This is a very quick and easy recipe.  My 6 year old daughter and I whipped this together in less than 15 minutes.  We used July apples, and they were quite tart-- the perfect foil for the sweet cinnamon topping!  We'll be making THIS one more often!

Yummy!  I used Fuji apples because that's all I had.  I peeled them with a potato peeler, cored, then sliced about 1/4 inch.  I popped it under the broiler for about 2 minutes to crisp it up.  Didn't have any ice cream or whipped cream on hand, so just poured a few tablespoons of milk over the top.  It was yummy and my 7 year old said it's her new favorite.  Thanks!

As a teacher, it was the perfect recipe for classroom cooking in fall.  We did add extra sugar, spices, and oatmeal to make a thick topping.I have made this twice, once in the microwave and once in the oven - both delicious.

Great and quick and raved over.  Changes made: added tsp of sugar and cinnamon to apples and mixed in, dotted a couple of spoons of OJ into the apples, added a couple drops of vanilla to the crumb, used 2/3 granny smith apples and 1/3 red.  Next time would use 50% mix.  Delicious!

This was a super hit with my family (and me!). I used 7 small-medium golden apples, and 10 minutes in the microwave was perfect.  I would prefer the topping a little crisper, but for the ease of making it in the microwave, I give it 5 stars!

I used to make this all the time. In fact, I had been looking for the recipe.  The only thing I did was add 1/4 cup chopped pecan  (or to your liking) to the top and I add few raisins or strawberries in with the apples.  I think I'll try substituting peanut butter for the butter, like someone suggested.   A hit every time!  The only problem I had was that the topping is not "crumbly", so I just added more oats.  My husband likes rhubarb crisp, too.

So it's not a traditional apple crisp, but that doesn't matter at 10 pm when you have the munchies. This is AWESOME!  It gets gobbled up immediately by us, which always leaves us with stomach aches - very rich.

I made this earlier this evening for dessert.  I hate peeling apples, so I only do it a few times a year for my husband's craving for apple crisp and apple pie.    I used 5 fairly large Cortland apples, peeled 3 of them and left 2 of them unpeeled, just diced smaller.     I tossed my apple chunks in cinnamon/sugar before putting the topping on.  I also tweaked the recipe a bit and used 1/4 cup chunky peanut butter and 1/4 cup melted butter mixed.  The PB gave it an extra boost and the peanuts gave it a nice, surprising crunch.    Overall, I think the recipe is okay...I prefer an oven baked crisp over the microwave, even with the ease of the microwave.  Honestly, once you've got the apple crisp prepared in the pan (and assuming you've pre-heated your oven) all you have to do is throw it in there to bake!

I didn't like the texture of the oats in this at all.  I cooked for 10 minutes, and the oat topping was mushy, so I let it sit.  After sitting for several minutes, the oats were both chewy and crunchy- and not in a good way. Hard to describe the texture, but it was hard to eat.  The apples were fine though.  Won't make apple crisp in the microwave again.

I have to give this 5 stars for a dessert that is both satisfying and quick.  I had all the ingredients on hand, including the vanilla ice cream.  I scaled the recipe for 2 people.  I microwaved it for only 8 minutes, but probably could have used only 5 minutes (the cooking time does not scale, so I do recommend microwaving it in a lot less time if you intend on making fewer portions).  However, my daughter did not like it :( Although I'm giving it an awesome rating, it still does not compare to a traditional oven baked crumble.  Thanks for sharing!

My stove is not working so I thought I'd give this a whirl!    My husband is a diabetic, so I used Splenda brown sugar.    It was SUPER easy and was delicious!    Next time--because I am Lazy Cook, I am going to try unpeeled apples!

Great taste and idea! 4 stars because 10 minutes was too long...I don't know if my microwave has extra power or something!, but my apples were mush after 9 minutes. I wish I would have checked them earlier.

I really like this recipe. Living in a small apartment in Japan without an oven, I was missing some of the comforts of home. This recipe was a great find. I can make it in the microwave in no time at all and it has been a hit with all the neighbours!

it satisfied my pregnant craving for apple crisp...but, the topping got really hard and nearly impossible to eat. i soaked the top in vanilla ice cream, but i think that made it worse. i still ate it though ;)

Very good! I upped the dry goods to a cup each, heaped the doses of the spices, and added an extra 2 Tbsp. of butter. The prep took forever, but we LOVE the topping and the apples were perfect after 11 minute in the microwave. It was a hit at our Sunday school breakfast!

The overall taste was fine but there was no "crisp" in this dish. I checked after 8 minutes and removed it from the microwave because it was mushy. Sorry.

My mom just made this and for what it is, it's not bad.  She followed it exactly.  It ended up having a little too much liquid and the topping was quite wet but the flavor was pretty good -even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Next time I'll use 3/4 c flour and maybe add a few chopped pecans to the topping.  This isn't anything I'd serve company but it was plenty good as a little treat for the kids.

This is great as is - I've made it a few times.  However, I recently used this recipe to make a peach crisp - I used 2lbs of frozen sliced peaches, thawed.  I added a few dabs of butter (actually I used margarine) on the peaches probably totaling an extra tbsp and spaced it evenly around the pan and cooked the dish for about 15 min.  it was delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly, except reduced butter to 1 tbsp and microwaved it for 12 minutes. The topping turned out dry (but chewable); whereas apples turned out mushy. Overall taste was ok but I will probably not be making it again :) I will stick back to the much delicious and simple "Microwave Baked Apple" by Nicole M. from this site. Thanks for sharing your recipe anyway, Joy...

This is very easy and wonderful. My family loved it, and I loved that it didn't heat up the house! I used Fuji apples, I didn't have all spice so I added some nutmeg. I also, always, put a little cinnomon and nutmeg on the apples before cooking them; I added just a few drops of vanilla to the butter before adding the dry ingreadiant, (I mixed all the dry together before adding the wet).

Easy, and delicous. I used Macintosh and Old Fashioned Oats, because that is what I had and they still turned out great. I am not sure if that is why my apples were kind of mushy, but I don't mind that. I think if I didn't cook it the whole ten minutes, the topping might not have been done enough. I was happy to make a treat in this heat without warming up the kitchen.

This recipe came out so great! I doubled the recipe and placed the ingredients into a large oval microwave-safe dish. I added about 1/4 cup of sugar, 3 tbsp. lemon juice and 2 tbsp of corn starch to the granny smith apples. I left out the allspice and instead of using melted butter in the topping, I used some canola oil to moisten the crumb topping until it was combined. I microwaved the crisp for about 20 minutes and let it remain in the microwave to cool for about 1/2 hour. It was great not to have my oven throw so much heat and to get such a delicious crisp! *UPDATE* I made this again and added blueberries to the crisp and made it according to the "blueberry apple crisp" recipe on this site (with some modifications - came out beautiful!

So surprising! My husband was even surprised. I made it in a 8 inch pie dish and only needed two large apples and mixed them with some cinnamon and agava syrup before topping. It made a yummy sauce with the juice from the apples while it cooked! The only thing I would change would be the amount of butter in the topping, a little bit on the heavy side for my liking. But is was delish! If you don't tell no one will ever know it was made from a microwave.

I followed the recipe to a T using a deep dish pie plate...came out perfect. It is a keeper! I used an apple wedger to cut the apples and then peeled them. The slices were the perfect thickness.

What a great idea!  I would have never thought to make apple crisp in the microwave!  I made this last night while I was waiting for dinner to finish cooking.  I added a little cinnamon/sugar to the apples, and some chopped walnuts to the topping, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  The topping is not as crisp as it would be if it came from the oven, but if you are craving apple crisp and want it "RIGHT NOW", this is the recipe to go to.  For the most part I will continue cooking my apple crisps in the oven, but if I am in a hurry (or if it's summer time and I don't want to heat up my house by using the oven), I will definitely use this recipe again.  Of course we served this warm, topped with vanilla ice cream.

I had a microwave apple crisp recipe but I couldn't find it so I looked one up on this site. I later found my original recipe and it calls for 6 tbsp of butter instead of the 1/2 cup. I also normally make double the crisp part because I love it. I have always decreased the amount of flour I add as well. I guess I just do this because that was how I was taught to make this recipe. I do have to say this is a great Apple Crisp and a quick dessert to make.

So simple and delicious! I only had 2 fuji apples on hand, obviously not enough for a full-blown apple pie, but it was enough for a crisp! I halved the whole recipe and microwaved everything in a small pyrex bowl. I wish it could make a crispier crust, but I'll take it as is in exchange for the simplicity.

Very nice flavor. I substitued canned apple filling for the fresh apples. The topping didn't get as crisp as I thought but Imay have needed to reduce the butter since I didn't use fresh apples (my fault).

I never use my microwave for cooking, but this was perfect for an apple crisp craving. I used two packets of instant maple & brown sugar oatmeal, and decreased the sugar to about 1/2 cup (could use less). Not the same as oven baked, but this is surprisingly delicious for a fast dessert.

Easy & tasty.  Didn't have allspice so used additional cinnamon.  Also didn't have brown sugar, so used pure cane sugar.  Couldn't crumble mixture because of sugar so just kind of patted over apples.  Topped with chopped walnuts.  Also just cooked 10 minutes, came out great!  Thanks.

This is excellent if made as individual servings in a glass with ice cream and clotted cream added whilst still hot! try drizzling a teaspoon of warm syrup or chocolate spread over before serving!

We thought the topping was dry, and the texture was just not right.  I will stick to making apple crisp in the oven.  My family prefers the moist, warm, soft apple crisp fresh out of the oven.  I tried this recipe to avoid using the oven and heating up the kitchen, but I will not make this again.

This recipe is tasty, the apples are soft and gooey, and taste wonderful. The crisp was a little hard, and it can be a pain if you have sensitive teeth/braces. Overall it was a little dry, but it was an okay recipe.

I wanted a recipe I could make in a cup.  I cut the servings to two servings.  Unfortunately I did not adjust the cooking time enough.  At 5 min it was burnt.  I made it again and only cooked it for 2 min 30 sec.   It came out ok.  I will make it again, but I will keep tweaking the recipe and time until I get exactly what I want.

My family liked this!  I used 6 apples, and that was the right amount, and there was ample topping.  I used a 9 inch round glass pie dish.  It was overcooked at 10 minutes.  The apples were mush.  I will try 8 minutes next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great! I doubled the oatmeal topping ingredients since I cooked it in a larger dish. I also found finishing it off in the over was a great way to crisp the top!

This is really good considering it's a microwave recipe. It was a little sweet for my taste so I use 1/2 cup of sugar now. The people who found the crust mushy probably didn't let it cool long enough. The sugar needs to recrystallize before it gets crisp. Since Joy doesn't mention the wattage of her microwave, I recommend cooking for 6 minutes, and then at 1 minute increments until the apples are soft.

Yum! Apples were tender crisp and the topping was crunchy and the flavor was SO good. Truly a surprise coming out of the microwave! Freshly whipped cream was the final accessory. Will make this again.

I am keeping this because it's so darn simple, quick and easy!  I only had two Fuji apples but used the same measurements for the filling, except I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar rather than 3/4 cup as I was using up what I had left.  I substituted nutmeg for allspice.  Also I used gluten-free granola instead of oats and skipped the flour.  I cooked the dish for five minutes, checking at four.  The apples were soft but not mushy (also I forgot to peel them, which was fine).  Without the flour and at the shorter cook time, the filling was more of a thick syrup.  I'll try adding flour next time to check out the recipe as intended but we didn't mind the dish the way it came out without flour.  Made a great quick snack.

Truly fabulous recipe!  Quick, easy and delicious!  I used a mix of two other types of apples and didn't peel them (because that's where the fiber is) and microwaved for 10 minutes.  Yum!!

This was a great recipe at two am when I wanted some comfort food before bed... like others, I added some nutmeg and cloves. I also tossed the sliced apples in Orange juice before putting them in the dish. I do this with all apple recipes because it complements the delicious tartness of the granny Smith and evens out the sweetness of the typing. In usually to busy to bake so I will be using this recipe again and again to save time. Also when it's Warner out and I don't want a hot oven in my kitchen!

We needed something to use up a bunch of bruised apples here at work, and voila! the extra ingredients are esy to get here without making a mess of the briefcase, and the microwave works fine.  Whoever complained about the crust probably patted it down -- that is not a good idea for apple crisp conventional or microwave.

Great recipe!!  The only things I changed were cooking the apples with a bit of sugar for 3 minutes before adding the crumble and using oil instead of butter, turned out yummy!

This was exactly what I needed! Just bought a big bag of apples and found several of them bruised and crushed on the bottom. I almost through them out but instead I chopped them up and came to find a quick simple apple crisp recipe. They turned out great! Waste not, want not! :)

wonderful!!  it was so good.  the only thing I think I'll change- less sugar it was so sweet and rich.  I will also put more oatmeal- we thought that was a little low.  I'll post more after I refine it.  loved how this turned out so crunchy!!

I didn't have enough apples, so dropped in a few frozen raspberries. Was very good. I missed the richer caramelization that oven cooking would have made. Otherwise, it was great.

I prepared this "almost" as directed.  I just increased the apples, oats and flour since I was having company.  It came out perfect and everyone loved it There were no leftovers which disappointed my fiance so I made him some the next day. I served it on antique plates with fresh whipped cream. As a deconstructed dessert it presented beautifully. Is was definitely the star of the meal.

It actually tasted very good; however, I got on the phone and didn’t serve it to the toddlers until it cooled and the oatmeal caramelized and was to hard for them. They wouldn’t even try it, but the other day I gave them oatmeal which they did not appreciate. Thanks for the recipe!

Great!  I like to eat apples in different ways as a snack and cut down this recipe to 1 serving, and made myself some.  I didn't want to burn it so I only put it in the microwave for 2 minutes and it was good.

This came out perfectly and was great for a late night sweets craving!  I was skeptical about how it would work in the microwave -- but it was PERFECT!  I will make this again and again!

I had two beautiful Gala apples sitting on the counter and I'm really not an apple person, but when I came across this recipe it sounded so delicious I had to try it. Of course  I scaled the recipe back to accomodate my two apples but I basicaly kept everything else the same except I added a handful of craisins to the sliced apples. I topped the hot apples with more vanilla ice cream than needed but it was so GOOD!
