I have never made or had bread pudding in my life and I have to say that this was a huge success with my family.  I left out the slivered almonds since not everyone in the house likes them.Will definitely make again since I always seem to have bread left over from this and that.  Very yummy!

I've gotten a lot of great recipes from Allrecipes.com. This isn't one of them. Made it according to recipe, no changes. I think it was the combination of the cinnamon and almond extract. Served it at my coffee gathering and even the 2 men who attend (and will eat just about anything) didn't like it. I do a lot of baking for the gang & everyone was surprised because that's the first time in 4 yrs I've made something that everyone didn't like.  So I will stick to my cranberry walnut bread pudding.
