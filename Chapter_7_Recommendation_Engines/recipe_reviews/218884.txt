This is my new go-to party dish. The only change I make is that in exchange for the pinto beans (pintos aren't my favorite) I add another can of either black beans or black-eyed peas. 

Every party I have served this at, it gets rave reviews and people want the recipe. I also love the left overs the next day for a healthy lunch.

We make this salad often in our home. Fast to make. We use whatever beans we have on hand, (try anything, even used garbanzos) use either red or green onion (prefer red cause it's crunchy). Like to use 2 ears of fresh corn roasted on the grill for a couple of minutes on each side or boiled for a few minutes, but in a pinch have used frozen and always use roasted red peppers b/c we don't care for the jarred pimento. 
We also use agave instead of sugar and don't need to cook the dressing, just mix it all in one bowl and refrigerate to "marry" flavors. 
I might go easier on the dressing depending on the amount of beans I'm using, but judge for yourself. 
Great side recipe to have on hand. But refrigerate at least an hour. Great to take to picnics also.

I took this to work needing a vagan option that even the non-vegan co-workers would eat.  It was a big hit by all parties.  This will be a keeper recipe.

I made this recipe as written. I don't find it helpful to give a recipe a 5-star rating when you change too many of the ingredients. The only thing I did not like about this was the homemade dressing. It was just too sweet for my taste. I prefer the versions that have a little more tangy flavor. With some tweaking on the dressing it would be better. The vegetable and bean combination was nice and it was a very pretty dish. I was surprised that I would like the pinto beans. Never saw Cowboy Caviar with anything other than black beans and black eyed peas. I did think it was a bit too much corn. Would probably use a cup of frozen corn next time.

After frantically searching the house for my own black bean salsa recipe and not being able to find it, I made this one. Very good. I made the dressing as written but decided to not use it because of how much oil was in it. I made it again using just the rice vinegar and sugar. a HUGE hit at the party. I loved the pinto beans in it because it gave the salsa a softer texture than my original recipe that used only black beans. Really good, thanks so much for posting:)

My family LOVES this! I had been making a version that uses bottled Italian dressing for years. I love this recipe's dressing...so much fresher and lighter. I do cut back the olive oil and sugar to 1/4 c. I prefer red onion. And I don't use celery or pimento. I suggest adding 1/2 to 1 t of cumin to the dressing. It really gives bit of zing without being overtly spicey. Everytime I take this somewhere new I get asked for the recipe!

This is really good, but definitely need to cut down on the olive oil, 1/2 cup is way tooo much.  Also, its good without the salt and pepper.

I tried this recipe as written and served it with dipping corn chips and Tostitos for a recent party.  You really need something substantial to load this dip onto the chip.  It had a really good flavor and made a TON.  So much leftover I had to think about what to do with it after we got tired of the chip routine.  Well I found it makes a wonderful addition to a plain tossed green salad.  You don't even need salad dressing, just toss it all together and maybe add some tomatoes.  This recipe takes a little work to make.  Do not leave out the fresh cilantro, in my opinion that makes the combo all that much better.  I will save this recipe for something special but on those occasions where I'm pressed for time, I think the standard cowboy caviar using beans, corn, salsa and Italian dressing works just fine.

Love this salsa!  I too, improvise with whatever looks good, or that I have on hand.  Decided to experiment, so tonight I made a triple batch and canned it.  Had to make about 7x the dressing - which I know is too much, but wanted to be sure I had enough to fill each jar.  It made 11 and 3/4 jars.  All sealed but one - which I plan to open and eat as soon as it is chilled.  Can't wait!

This was really delicious! I used about 2T of olive oil (max). I used slightly less than 1/3 of a cup of sugar too. My whole family enjoyed it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Everyone loved this! It was so good I ate it for lunch the next day. I used bottled balsamic vinaigrette and squeezed in some fresh lemon juice instead of the homemade dressing. I also swapped chick peas for the pinto beans. I felt it needed something so I added cumin. Just perfect to me!

I made this for Christmas Eve and took to my in-laws and it was a big hit.  The only change I made was I added 2 diced avocados and it was even that much better.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the sauce could be cut back a bit.  I think half the sauce would be enough.

Made it exactly as recipe was given. Wonderful... Will find many uses for this. I'm sure it will be good over fish, on a baked potato, etc. I plan to keep some on hand most of the time. Happy that the recipe was shared, thank you.

I had it at my daughter's Craft Party, then decided to try it for myself.  It was a definite hit!  I added 1 and a half, huge Avocados which made it even better, almost creamy. Since my hubby's stomach is sensitive to strong chili, I added a small can of diced green chili, perfect. It was truly enjoyed. 
 When I make it again, I plan to experiment again. This time I will add thawed from frozen whole kernel sweet corn, because the corn that was recommended just didn't have enough color.  I will include red onions for additional color and flavor, as well as, kidney beans for more bulk.  
I think this CbC is good enough to add to just about any dish.  I may try it with fish, fish tacos or on the side.  No matter which way you serve it, it is so very tasty.  The grandchildren were happy with a spoon and a little bowl each, as did my older brother (who swears he doesn't eat vegetables)!

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. I used chickpeas for the pinto beans and to cut waste I used 1 whole red bell pepper instead of 1/2 each red and yellow. This is SO good. Thanks again Kate for sharing.

Amazing recipe! I didn't have any rice vinegar and used apple cider vinegar instead. I also added shredded carrots … the cider vinegar and carrots added a lovely profile.
Next day the flavors REALLY do pop

2nd time I have made it. I was buying Costco's but tried this recipe and it is so much better, less expensive, and lasts longer. 
I serve it over broiled salmon and sautéed spinach. Tonight it's over pan seared scallops and arugula. 
Love this stuff and so does my husband!

I liked this very much.  I did make some changes.  I added about one half cup of cucumber.  I cut back on oil to about two tablespoons and cut back on sugar to about one tablespoon.  I added half teaspoon garlic powder,  one and one half teaspoons ground cumin, about a teaspoon of oregano (crushed)and about one eighth teaspoon cayenne.

I used seasoned rice vinegar with added herbs and we did NOT like it. I'm not sure if it was the seasoned vinegar or just the rice vinegar. I will use a different dressing.

EDIT: Yeah, it was the rice vinegar! This is an excellent recipe and very adaptable. I like adding halved cherry tomatoes. You can also use bottled Italian dressing.

Followed the recipe almost completely. I didn't have any celery or pimento peppers on hand. Used pickled jalapeños instead  and used 1/4 cup of  apple cider vinegar with 1/4 cup of seasoned rice vinegar to intensify flavour of dressing.  Refrigerated overnight as well. Yummy delicious!!!  Will definitely make again.

Love this salsa!  You can use beans of your choice. One of my favorites is Organic Great Value Tri-Bean Blend, a blend of kidney, pinto and black beans. If you do not jalapeño peppers you can add 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.

I used garbanzo beans instead of white beans and used lime juice for the dressing.  We love the flavor.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Good and healthy for snacks. I didn't have any green onions, so I used a small red one instead, diced. Next time I'll add more jalapeños for more zip. Another batch is in the near future.

This recipe is so yummy and was such a hit!  I could seriously just eat it as a meal as it is full of healthy ingredients and it  is just that tasty.

 I chose to soak and cook my beans instead of using canned beans because that is what I had on hand, I did not have shoepeg corn so I substituted frozen corn, and I also had a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes on hand and thought they'd be a yummy addition and they were.  

This recipe makes a HUGE batch so knowing I'd have leftovers I chose not to drain off the excess fluid and instead used a slotted spoon to transfer the caviar into a serving dish so the remaining ingredients could continue to soak up the goodness until being eaten later.

This recipe is SO delish that I am already planning on making it again for 2 more events this summer!

I will definitely make this again!  Great with chips but it would make a nice side dish or snack eating with a spoon.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the tangy, sweet and spicy flavors.

This is a wonderful summertime side dish or salad.  I often make it a day ahead and it's even better if it is refrigerated overnight.  It travels well and is a huge hit everywhere. My sister in law isn't a veggie fan, but even she loves it and asked for the recipe.  It's great made as directed or easily modified based on what you prefer or have on hand.   Love love love

Made this for our tailgate this past weekend and it was a hit. Everyone wanted the recipe. The chopping takes a while but it's worth it. I'll be making this again.

Very tasty. If we had the capability to rate in half steps (e.g. as with Red Box video), I'd bump this up to 4.5 stars. Prefer this to the plainer versions on this site, altho I've settled on a hybrid with my own tweaks. Having diced petite tomato in the dish is definitely an improvement.

I love this version of cowboy caviar.  Had it at a friend's house recently and was searching for a recipe online.  The sweetness of it tastes great with a salty tortilla chip.
