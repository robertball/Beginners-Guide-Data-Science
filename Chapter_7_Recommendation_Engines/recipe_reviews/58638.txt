I've made this 3 times now, everyone asks me to make it for bbq's and picnics now. 
 I found a way  to make icing it easier without all the flakes getting stuck in your icing, you have to place the flat base facing upwards and the layers flatten out making icing easy. Thanks, great recipe!

My partner absolutely LURVES this recipe, he says he refuses to take it to work now as a snack because he never ends up with any for himself.
When cooking the puff pastry in the oven it blows up like a balloon! Don't be afraid to push it flat immediately after it is cooked to let the hot air out of it. Good Luck!

I used instant vanilla pudding and it turned out great.  I would recommend using all the puff pastry (not 1/2 like other reviewers) and putting it in a 11x7 pan.  I would also double the frosting.  It was delicious - exactly like the vanilla slices I used to get in England!  So glad to have found this recipe - thanks!

Kind of like a giant napoleon pastry. Add a drizzle of chocolate glaze on top of the icing for a little more visual appeal.

Being from England originally I was so excited to see this recipe, I just had to make it. My husband being american had never tried it. The pastry turned out great, although I had to triple the icing to cover the top, as in my local towns pastry shop in UK, I sprinkled coloured suger on the top of the icing. The custard was very thick when I popped it into the refrigerator, I left it there for 2 hours before serving, did I leave it in too long? The custard was sooo runny,  very disappointing. I will be looking for a new Vanilla Slice recipe to try and compare.

Great desert! Very easy and fast to put together, especially if you use INSTANT vanilla pudding and follow the instructions for "PIE filling", not the ones for pudding. Also, cut the pastry sheets BEFORE you bake them. This way, you just have to split them horizontally after they puff and fill them with the cream. Or, if you have the puff pastry SHELLS, just bake them, pop the tops while still warm, then cool and fill them with vanilla cream, fresh fruits and a dollop of whipped cream. I never use frosting, just a sprinkle of confectioner sugar.

I followed this receipt to a tee, and my filling was completely watery. I thought that maybe it would set up in the refrigerator, but after 5 hours, it did not, so I tipped it all out.

I think I will try this with just instant vanilla custard / pudding mix, and then layer it with the puff pastry. 

The icing came out well though !

Very easy to follow this recipe. Everyone at work enjoyed it. 

I would double the amount of vanilla next time and for those that don't like custard all tha much (like me), I would make half the amount of custard. So the filling is not so thick

Try it with passion fruit in the icing - authentic Aussie vanilla slice then, and looks good too.

I didn't know what custard powder was...so I looked online and they said you can substitute instant vanilla pudding for the custard powder, so that's what I did.  I thought it would be weird because you don't normally cook instant pudding.  Anyway, it turned out just fine because I think it's made of about the same ingredients.  This dessert tastes like a custard cream puff.  It's very tasty but it's hard to cut.  I served it with a raspberry sauce and that made it awesome.

It would have been really good except the mixture came out watery. It tasted amazing but it wasn't in tact.

I make this regularly... only problem is that I have to make two... one for the guys at my work and one for my partners work. The first time I made this it didn’t thicken/set in the fridge very well. I now reserve 1 1/4 cups of milk, sprinkle 6 tsps  of gelatine over the top, let it sit for 10mins and microwave in blocks of 15seconds till the gelatine is dissolved. Then add it to the rest of the milk in the custard mix and follow the rest of the recipe. Tastes just like a bakery one!!! Thank you for this recipe ??

I was sooooo looking forward to this.   I made exactly as per directions.  Tasted fantastic but next time I will double the icing and make half the custard filling.  Waaaaay too much custard, hard to handle.

I added a little almond extract to the custard along with the vanilla and also changed the vanilla in the icing to almond. I didn't like the color of the icing with the regular brown vanilla so went for the clear almond. People commented on it.  My Australian friend was a happy Aussie!

I had a request from a good friend from England to make Vanilla slices  So I made a pan and feed it to 4 people who miss the food from home (England).  Loved them, and said they were spot  on, and all of the Maritimers really enjoyed them too. The only thing I would do differently is double the icing, it was just not quit enough to nicely cover the top.

This is a fantastic pudding very much like English custard tart. Had no problems with the recipe. Everyone loved it. All 4 children and my husband too.I left off the icing topping as I thought it was sweet enough.
