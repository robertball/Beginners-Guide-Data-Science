I used Splenda instead of sugar, and since some other reviewers complained that it didn't thicken properly, I added about a Tbsp of cornstarch to the cold water befor mixing.  It turned out great, and to top it off, it's ZERO Weight Watcher's Points!

This is your classic and easy cranberry relish recipe!  I made this last night over the stove.  Combined the sugar and water to a boil for 5 minutes.  Then added the cranberries and let boil for another 5 minutes, until the cranberries begin to burst.  I also added some orange zest and orange juice for a little special flavour.  My dear husband loved this!  Will definitely be making this again.

My family never touches the cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving (we usually use the can) but I'm a fan of it and decided to make some home-made and used this recipe. It was a hit~we didn't have a single bit left over!!!
I did make a few modifications: I used a little under 3/4 C sugar instead of only 1/2. I also put all ingredients into a pot and cooked it on the stove until the berries popped. Then, I placed it all into a blender to make it smooth. I then added some tangerine zest. After letting it cool in the fridge, it was the perfect "jelly" consistency.

I made this on the stove. I let the sugar and water combine over medium heat, put the cranberries in and added orange zest and the juice from 1 orange. I let it all cook together on low for a few minutes and then let it sit in the fridge overnight to chill.

I never knew making cranberry sauce could be so easy!

I used splenda instead of sugar and it was still good! One of my guests cringed when she saw splenda, but said she could hardly tell the difference afterwards! It's so nice to have such a simple, easy task when there are so many other things to worry about when making Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone was so impressed with the fresh cranberry sauce and it was the simplest dish I made!

I've been using this recipe for years.  It's quick and simple and I don't understand why more people don't make homemade cranberry sauce.  Stay away from the can-berry sauce people!  :o)

This recipe was so delicious! It definitely beats the canned cranberry sauce I usually buy at the store. I'm really not a big fan of cranberry sauce (but my husband is) so I mainly made it for him. Needless to say, even I ended up eating some sauce with my turkey dinner! The best part is that it's so easy and fast to make. The only thing I did different was put the mixture in the blender after the berries "popped" to make it a bit smoother.

I make this recipe every year for Thanksgiiving. So easy and delicious!  I let it sit overnight in the fridge to make sure it sets a little.  My family loves it so much and no one would guess how easy it is!

This was better than the ratings! I was very surprised as it is so easy and fast.  I did doctor it just a little by adding a chopped orange and the zest after it cooled for a while and 2 tablespoons of brandy.  I could eat this all day long!

I love cranberries this way. I mush mine up afterward they are done cooking. And I cook them with one cut up pear. I too add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up. Wonderful flavor!

My family usually does the canned stuff and my mother actually will not eat fresh cranberry sauce, but I decided to go out on a limb this year, especially when I realized just how easy it is!  I doubled the recipe and changed it a little: 
1 package of cranberries (approx 1 pound);
2-3 spoonfuls of canned, crushed pineapples (in its juice, not heavy syrup);
1 1/4 cups of white sugar;
3/4 cup water; and
1/4 cup pineapple juice from the can.  Boil the water, juice and sugar until the sugar melts, stirring constantly.  Add the cranberries and pineapple and boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Cranberries will have burst and turned soft and the syrup will turn dark red.  It's sweet and tangy and everyone in my family loved it, including my mother.  I like it chunky, but you can blend it for a smooth consistency.  Chill overnight.  Enjoy!

This turned out great!

I made the recipe for 12 servings and added some orange zest, a tablespoon frozen orange juice concentrate, and a dash of cinnamon  .  After a quick whirl in the food processor, I poured the batch into a gelatin mold.  Great flavors & consistency!

Yum!  This cranberry sauce is *so* good and easy, we'll never go back to the can!  I've made this recipe a few time & found a few changes that make it even better.  First, I reduced the amount of sugar by 25% (I doubled the recipe & used 3/4 cup of sugar) and then the other change I made was boiling the berries on the stove top.  It was just less messy than when I tried it in the microwave.

All in all, this is a great recipe!

I made this on the stove top.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. So easy, I will never buy canned berries again. The kids liked it so much they asked me to make it again on a regular basis.  Even tripling the recipe it didn't last long once the kids got to it.

I believe this is the same recipe you get on the back of a bag of cranberries. Still better than can.

Add a little grated orange rind and juice from the same orange.  You will go nuts over the aroma throughout your house.  Plus, the taste is amazing!

You can also add some kind of nut if you want. Chopped walnuts taste really good in cranberry sauce. It gives you something to chew on!
Thanks for this recipe!

WOW..I had no idea how easy this was! My husband has given up things with High Fructose Corn Syrup in them and the cranberry sauce in a can that we normally got has that in it, so I thought I'd try making it myself, using this recipe. This was extremely tasty...even my two daughters, who are not a big fan of cranberry sauce in general, thought this tasted pretty good and actually ate some!

This was a bit sweet for our taste.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar.  Mine also came out a bit runny-- not sure if it will thicken up in the frig (although it's been in there 24 hours now).  I may add less water, too.  I think with these revisions it will be great.

Made this for Thanksgiving and loved it - making it again for Christmas- to go along with pork loin roast.  

Really tasty!

What I liked about this recipe was the ease of preparation but it was too sweet for us.  I will make it again this way but I'll cut down the sugar and use orange juice in place of the water.   Thanks for sharing your recipe sal!

So easy and so good!  I make this recipe all the time, I've made it exactly as written, and the only thing I've changed recently is to cut the sugar in half. (But I do prefer a little more tart to the cranberry sauce.  If you like it sweeter, this recipe is perfect the way it is.)   Great recipe!

We have some big cranberry eaters in our family.  We've always used can.  They loved it so much more like this!  It was addictive.  I made it on the stove instead of the microwave.  I wasn't sure what to expect with "cranberry popping."  They didn't make a popping sound, or a mess.  They just gently and quietly fell apart.  I put them in the blender to make a smoother consistency.  This will be a holiday tradition for sure!  Thanks for the recipe.

it's so easy and more flavorful than the canned stuff. i made this maybe half a week in advance and just kept it in my fridge.

when the berries popped and i mashed them all with my spatula, i thought the cranberries were a little too bitter so i added maybe like a quarter cup of orange juice and it tasted so strongly of orange that i thought i had ruined it but after letting it cool and turn into slushy jelly in the fridge, it lost the orange flavor completely.

I use recipe this for my homemade party meatballs.  This recipe is quick and easy and is so much better than using canned cranberries!  I combine this with the Chili sauce (ELLENMEL) and Cocktail Meatballs (Lara) recipes on this site.

This recipe was so easy to make.  Having said that, it was wayyyy too sugary.  While I do think I will make it again, next time I will only add 1/2 cup sugar instead of a whole cup.  That is just too much.

Worked perfectly! I made mine on the stove as well. Boiled the sugar and water for about 5 mins, added the cranberries. Then just wait until they pop and it starts to get thick. Then it's done! Super easy and 100x better than store bought.

This was so easy and good! For last year's Christmas dinner I made a complicated Martha Stewart cranberry sauce recipe. This was so much better. I, like others, put everything in the food processor after boiling which produced a smoother texture.

I never touch cranberry sauce.. Mostly because I've never tried homemade and have only had the can stuff.   I made this up following the recipe exactly, and it is so yummy and so easy to make..   After making it myself and seeing how much better it taste and how easy it is to make, I dont understand why anyone still uses canned cranberry sauce, if they dont have too.

I made this for thanksgiving this year.  I have two grown sons that couldn't get enough of it.  It is so easy and a great change to canned cranberry sauce.  I will also make it for Christmas.

It doesn't get any easier than this! I've never liked canned cranberry sauce but this fresh sauce was delicious and so so easy to make. Make sure to use a large piece of waxed paper over the bowl in the microwave, because when the cranberries pop they really explode everywhere!

I doubled the recipe and cooked on the stove so maybe that was the problem, but mine came out very runny. It didn't gel the way you think cranberry sauce would. I even put it in the freezer for a bit and overnight in the fridge and it still was runny.

I made it using Spenda & doubled it.  With the notes from a previous rater, I added the cornstarch as she suggested & a bit of orange zest.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I'll a Jalapeno twist.

I know you guys don't like reviews when the recipe has been changed but I couldn't figure out how to submit my own recipe. I'm creative but flaky.

I used a 12 oz bag of cranberries, not frozen. I used 3/4 sugar, 3/4 brown sugar, 1  cup water, 1/2 cup orange juice, about 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/3 cup raisins.

I followed the cooking instructions and let chill overnight. It came out FANTASTIC!

I'm ashamed to say I've always used canned sauce but NEVER again! I made this in less than 10 minutes on Wednesday, so I had one thing done before the major cooking on Thursday.

I will make two bags of cranberries sauce next time and adjust other ingredients accordingly so I have more left over. I ate the remaining sauce over Friday and Saturday. Absolutely scrumptious.

I can't tell how how good this tasted. It was magical and fast. I got compliments, ooo's and ahhh's from all my guests.

I love cranberries and I love raisins so I'm in heaven.

Just made this, with the slight modification of 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and it is spectacular. I had attempted cranberry sauce several years ago using a complicated recipe that ended up being too watery, so was leary of trying again. This recipe is so easy, and so quick, and very tasty warm. I can't wait to try it once chilled. I will definitely be making this again!

This is an easy recipe, fast and fun to make.  I did a test run on top of the stove and add some  baked apple slices, (cooked enough but still able to hold their shape), and also some orange zest.

For a simple traditional whole berry sauce, this is it! I tried a different alcohol-infused special relish and ended up in the trash! This is it for the purist. My daughter-in-law won't eat anything but the canned jelly, but even she liked this one a LOT!

I Will never buy canned again!  I added a little grand mariner, and the flesh of a naval orange when cooled.  This is the best cranberry sauce ever.  The one question put to me, "why have we been buying canned all these years"?

I doubled the recipe to can the extra. I have two Thanksgivings this year and only wanted to make it once. I prefer to make it on the stove top. I used one cup of sugar and substituted the other cup of sugar for a cup of honey. Simmered until the cranberries were popping and splitting. The key is not to stir it a lot. Sanitize four pint jars and hot water bath for 15 minutes. Easy peasy.

This recipe is good, but can be made much better by adding a finely chopped orange - peel and all.  It thickens quickly when it simmers on the stove.  I have a diabetic husband and use half sugar and half xylitol, or sometimes all xylitol.

This recipe was great, but I changed it up a little.  I  used  Splenda instead of sugar.  I used orange juice concentrate and mixed with the water.  It was great when it came out of the microwave.  I puréed some with my emulsifier, for my husband, for the right texture that he likes.

I made this sauce and it was great.  The next time I made it I added 1 navel orange.  I served it over a 8 ounce bar of cream cheese and nutty type crackers.  It was a huge success and there is enough sauce for 2 bars of cream cheese.  Thank you!

Super easy! Some of the cranberries I had were a little too tart, so after cooking the cranberries I put them in the food processor.  It came out almost exactly like the canned cranberry sauce without the tacky can lines.

A tad too sweet for me, but everyone loved it. I added a can of mandarin oranges and some walnuts.

This was my first time making Cranberry sauce, and my first time ever eating it so I can't really pass too much judement. It was good, but I didn't care for it that much. Could be I just don't care for cranberry sauce! My son absolutely loved it, and seeing how it was so simple to make I had to at least give it 4 stars.
