This is awesome! Used one pound of shrimp. Added avocado to tacos used green angel hair cabbage. The sauce is great! Will make this often.

Fantastic! I didn't have mirin on hand, so skipped that ingredient, but otherwise made as advised. We added avocado to our finished tacos. Absolutely delicious!!
