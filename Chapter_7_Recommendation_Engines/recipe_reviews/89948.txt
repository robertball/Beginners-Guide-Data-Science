Excellent! The onion sauce was delicious. I added a little pepper to the sauce. I used 3 onions and that was enough for my 4 sausages. I used mild Italian pork sausages. Next time I will make more-- Our little family of 3 ate almost all of it.

My husband really liked this and I will try it again. I did add some pepper and used a spicy sausage. If I had not it would have been Very bland. Next time I will do the same thing with the pepper and spicy sausage but use less oil. I found it very oily.

Simple that's what I like. I added a small chopped apple with the onions. Seems like there is just a touch of some kind of spice missing. (Reason for 4 stars instead of 5) Can't figure out what to add for a little more flavor. My husband is an excellent cook & he even liked this. Next time I will put it over rice. Mmmm.

This was delicious! The onion sauce is to die for. We had them in hot dog buns but they would be so good with veggies and some garlic mashed potatoes. Thanks!

This recipe was pretty good. Way too many onions for our family of six. I added pepper to the onions and once the sausages were browned I added them and the pan drippings to the onions and let them simmer together awhile. Served with mashed potatoes.

Good. Very good. The pork sausages came from a Mom-n-Pop Mexican butcher shop dive. That's how I'll use this recipe. Whenever I see a greasy little butcher shop I'll stop in to see what they have.;-) On the down side that's a LOT of onion. And 1 hour is a LONG time to cook them.

I think this is pretty good. I doubled it for our family. Also I added a bit of garlic granules a little pepper and a splash of beef bouillon to it and I found that did the trick for extra flavour.

I used Garlic sausage that I had purchased at a meat market. the sauce was too salty. I used slap Ya Mama seasoning and I used the salt called for in the recipe. Next time I would omit the salt from the recipe. I only used 2 onions...all I had at home. I also cooked the sausage with the sauce for the 30 minutes instead of adding at the end. (I did broil them though)..I think it would have been perfect if I had not added the salt.
