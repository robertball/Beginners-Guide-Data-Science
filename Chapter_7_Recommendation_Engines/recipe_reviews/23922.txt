Green chili stew is a very popular dish in New Mexico which is where I grew up.  I make this easy stew on Christmas Eve (slow cooked in a crock-pot for 6-8 hours).  The level of desired spicyiness will vary for different people.  Canned green chili is too mild for my taste.  For those who prefer spicier green chili, I recommend www.buenofoods.com - a popular New Mexico chili retailer.  You can also choose to make a milder stew and serve extra green chili on the side so people can adjust the spicyness.  I highly recommend you try this stew - it will warm your bones on a cold winter's day.  YUM!

WONDERFUL recipe. I made it even simpler by just throwing everything in my slow cooker and letting it cook for 2-3 hours until tender. I added the potatoes about 1/2 an hour before serving.

My husband really liked this.  He is Mexican and does not like Tex-Mex food, which is what usually passes as Mexican food. He said this was just like something his mom makes, which means it's not only tasty, but also very genuinely Mexican and traditional. I added twice the amount of chopped green chiles, and added the hottest chopped tomatoes with chiles I could find.  It still wasn't that hot, but it was very, very tasty and hearty.

OK I made this into my "own" recipe but used this one as a guideline.  Instead of using beef I did pork cubes so therefore I ommitted the broth.  I would reccommend using about a cup of water instead.  I did not use the cucim but that was because I don't care for it.  I chopped two small jalapeno's and browned them with the onion and meat. I DID NOT add the potatoes.  Instead of using the canned chili's I chopped fresh, about one dozen.  After browing the meat and onions and jalapeno's I mixed everything in the crockpot on low for  as long as I needed.  It is a very good recipe!  Thanks Lynn!

This is a fantastic recipe to try if you've never made Green Chili Stew before. I did make mine with ground beef rather than beef stew meat or pork and used fresh roasted green chili (living in NM has it's advantages when it comes to getting authentic ingredients for this one!) that I purchased from Sunflower Market. A little tweaking of the spices to suit my personal tastes - I like a lot of garlic - fresh tortillas from a local establishment and we were in total green chili bliss! Suffice it to say I won't really need to be buying from local restaurants as I have found something just as good, if not better! Thanks for posting a great recipe :)

This is a great basic recipe but it's missing a few ingredients that would make it traditional, "New Mexican Green Chili Stew." I say, "New Mexican," since few Mexicans cook soley with fresh green chili's. [they wait for them to ripen for preservation purposes & use primarily red] But after they migrated to the US, this Green Chili Stew became more of a necessary adaptation due to income restrictions. This stew was actually created when Hispanics with large families &  limited incomes worked in the Hatch, NM chili fields. Instead of pork or prime cuts of beef, they used hamburger meat though pork shoulder was definitely preferred. [trust me when I say ground cumin & pork go together like helpless women and railroad tracks] Anyway, the more traditional version presents 2 + lbs Hatch Green Chili's, chopped jalape√±os, potatoes, hearty amounts of white onions & celery stalks with leaves, loads of cilantro & cumin, (2 + tbs cumin) parsley, generous amounts of garlic, green/red tomatoes, cayenne and black pepper, red pepper flakes, salt, Mexican Oregeno, bay leaves, Italian seasoning & beef/chicken/vegetable/or pork broth & was always served with warm tortillas. Notice that all ingredients were very easy to come by & cheap for Hispanic workers. If pork was used, they would season flour the meat & brown with garden vegetables then place in pot & simmer until the pork fell apart. This method also made for a thicker stew. Either way, it's a delicious stew & great recipe Lynn!

I used pork loin as I think it goes so well with green chile. Like others, I made this in my slow cooker so I omitted the oil. I used 14 oz frozen green chile (with liquid) so I reduced the broth to 1/4 c. I didn't add tomatoes or potatoes for dietary reasons, but did add about two cloves minced garlic. This is very similar to the way I usually make my green chile meat, but I usually don't add cumin. I'll definitely be adding it from now on. Thanks Lynn!

I made this according to the recipe.  I didn't change anything; however, I did add to it.  I added a large can of white hominy, an extra can of green chiles, and six peeled, chopped carrots.  It came out very, very good.  Next time, I'm thinking of chopping some cabbage, avacado, and lime slices and dressing it like we do posole.  I think it would be perfect for that.

My family and I love this recipe!  I change it a bit, I use pork and chicken stock.  I add coriander and garlic powder (sometimes oregano) as well.  For garnishes, we use sour cream, avocado, and I bake corn tortilla strips that I've tossed w/a bit of oil and salt to add something crunchy.  Haven't tried it but some cilantro at the end would probably be excellent in here.  Awesome as leftovers too.

YUM!  The very best easy soup.  The meat comes out tender and flaky and the soup base is savory-tart and slightly spicy.  Love it and will be making it a regular at our dinner table.

This recipe was good, but 2 pounds of meat was WAY too much. It was unbelievable how much meat there was compared to the other ingredients. Next time I will scale the meat back to 1 pound.

Very good!  I like to use 7oz of green chiles just because I like it really spicy.  Sometimes, I'll add corn to it too..but it's good with or without it.

Excellent flavor and at last something new in the stew department!  I used diced tomatoes with jalapenos as we like things really spicy.  Also doubled green chilies, lots of fresh garlic and used about 6 potatoes for my hubby.  Will make this often this winter - Thank you Lynn!

This recipe is excellent! I made this for my boyfriend who is from New Mexico and was missing his childhood favorite. I have never had this before and both of us LOVED it. We had it for dinner one night and ended up making it later in the week because we loved it so much. The only changes I made was I used 2 cans of tomatoes w/ green chili peppers and 2 cans of green chili peppers. I also ended up letting it simmer after I added the potatoes for an hour to hour and half rather than 30 minutes. 5 stars! I'm going to have the rest for lunch today.

I did this in the slow cooker and took recommendation from another reviewer and put the potatoes in late.  Was a mistake because an hour and a half later, they still weren't done.  Would either leave out the potatoes or put them in at the start.  Excellent flavor and my family loved it.  Served with warm flour tortillas.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

This was really good, but I made some alterations.  We used 4 butterfly pork chops cubed instead of beef.  Cooked it all in a crockpot for about 5 hrs, adding the potatoes about 1.5 hrs. before ready time.  I put in 2 cans of Rotel with Lime and Cilantro.  2 cups beef broth.  1/2 can chopped jalapenos and 2 cans green chilis...oh and a can of Pinto beans.  Also added 1 tsp. of oregano.  My first go round I used the potatoes, but for some reason I decided to try the 2nd day with rice.  I picked out the big chunks of potatoes and added some rice and it was wonderful.  Next time I will substitute rice for potatoes.  This is definitely better the 2nd day.  The jalapenos kicked up the spice a notch, so be careful.  I absolultely love spicy food and had we added an entire can of chopped jalapenos, we would have been in trouble.  Highly recommend this one though and it's super easy!

This stew is delicious.  I brought leftovers to work and people were commenting on how good the stew smelled.  I told them I'd bring the recipe in the next day.
The stew is simple to make.  I use top sirloin (instead of beef stew meat) cut into small pieces.  I also just used one big russet potato, it's plenty.
This is a wonderful recipe that I will make often.

Made this as written except I used pork because that's what I had in the freezer.  This was really good.  Hubby said it was a keeper.  Although not a 5 star (I reserve that for something that's beyond great) this is really good.  Will make again and again.  Love the green chili's - we are don't like real spicy (I do, hubby doesn't) and I would have loved it spicier but it was still quite tasty.  Thanks, Lynn, for a keeper!

Delicious stew!  I used mild green chili peppers and the flavor of them really came through!  We all loved it!  I just used a regular can of diced tomatoes and just added in a couple more mild chili peppers.  Also I had to use about 2 cups more beef broth.  Thanks so much!

Nice, made it very close to directions.  Used pork and beef cubes.  Yummy.  This is a recipes that makes you want to add something, only b/c it's good and makes you want to get creative, not b/c it was missing something.  We will make this again for sure.  Thank you!

So great!  I added worcestershire sauce and a bay leaf for flavor but left out the extra chilies.  I also added carrots with the potatoes.  This made it less like a Mexican stew and more like pot roast!  I also added 2Tbsp. flour to thicken it up at the end.  Great base recipe to play around with.

I really enjoyed this.  It was really flavorful and super easy to make.  It did take an hour longer than stated for the meat to get tender which wasn't a big deal.

This stew is wonderful. My whole family loved it. The only changes I made was to use fresh tomatoes and roasted my own green chili from the farmer's market. Great way to use fresh veggies that are plentiful now.

This is exactly like the stew I had in New Mexico.  The only change I made was I added 2 diced fresh jalepenos because we like a little extra heat.  We fill tortilla shells with the stew mixture and top it with a little cheese and sour cream!! YUM!

Awesome! I used pork and chicken broth ... then followed the recipe almost to the letter with the exception of adding an extra can of green chili! I used extra hot rotel and it does have some kick! Spicy and nice! A keeper!

This was great! I made a couple minor changes to it. I couldn't find the tomatoes with diced green chiles, so I used a can of tomatoes with diced jalepenos. Also, after browning the meat, I dumped everything into my crockpot and simmered it on low for 6 hours. I added the potatoes during the last hour of cooking so they wouldn't turn to much. Served the stew with corn muffins, and it made a delicious dinner.

I cubed beef and threw all ingredients in the crock pot (except oil) and slow cooked for 8-10 hours.  Very easy and delicious.  This is a keeper.

My husband is from New Mexico and I am a NEW cook.... with that said, this is the first thing he ever asked me to make again!! We used ground beef because that's how his mom used to make it but followed every other step just as is.... this was simply amazing and super easy to make!

I had to simmer much longer than 1 hour to get the meat tender. More like 2 hours. I also added garlic instead of garlic salt. Very good.

Really good!  I use this all the time.  Kind of a south american alternative to Indian curry.  I added red pepper for some more heat and threw in a couple handfulls of Basmati rice during the last 20 minutes to thicken.  Yeah!

Delicious! Great recipe. I added a clove of chopped garlic, omitted the onions, and added a can of corn. I did have to increase my cooking time. At 1 hour my meat was still super tough, so I let that sit for about an hour and a half total, then added the potatoes, and let it all simmer for another hour. So... 2 1/2 hours total, but worth every second. Served with crusty bread to dip in the stew. MMmmmm!

Good Stew.  I added one chopped anaheim chili but just about left everything the same.  I cooked this on a Thursday and we ate it on Friday.  The flavors blended nicely.  Glad I tried this one...thankx for sharing.

It was okay - just not what I was looking for.  Maybe I was expecting something with a kick - it was surprisingly mild.  I'm glad I tried it but I'll stick with traditional beef stew.

This is a new favorite at our house - I've made it at least once a month since I first got the recipe.  The original definitely needed more heat for our taste so I use some cayenne or a fresh chile pepper or two (be careful - I learned the hard way that it's difficult to judge the strength of fresh peppers!).  I also like to add a can of corn to up the veggie content.  Try it with the "Best-Ever Corn Muffins."  They're the perfect sweet contrast to a spicy stew.  Happy to see this recipe in the top ten!

We were expecting more from this recipe (with all the glowing reviews).  It tasted all right, but I won't make it again.  I took the recommendation from a previous reviewer and substituted pork cubes for the beef.  I don't know if the beef would have made this recipe any better.

When making New Mexican green chile stew, the 'chili' is spelled with an 'e' - chile!  Chili is something you make with beans - like chili con carne.

The broth of this stew is incredible!  I lightly coated my stew meat with a flour/homemade taco seasoning mix before browning in my dutch oven.  I also added ~1/4 cup of salsa verde that I needed to finish up.  My only comment is that the potatoes, while needed, seem a bit out of place: a bite without potatoes tastes like a mild mexican stew - a bite with the potatoes tastes like a slightly seasoned plain beef stew.  I will have to find a way to remedy this because we all really enjoyed this dish.

Added 1/2 bag of corn.  Ran out of time so skipped the potatoes (would add some Yukon Gold chunks next time).  We came home from a movie to this simmering and ready to eat.  We really liked this! I added green Tabasco at the table, YUM!  Will play with extra spices next time.  And there WILL be a next time.

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I use this recipe with fake ground beef (vegetarian). Other than that, it is excellent! It is a delicious stew, especially if you are familiar with New Mexican green chili recipes. As someone who lived in Albuquerque for 6 years and still craves and misses the dishes now that I'm in NY state, this dish serves as a welcome memory. It's warm, spicey, and so yummy!

I made this stew using pork as someone else had recommended. I also used 1 1/2 cans of chopped green chilis as I was using up some from another recipe. I could have put 2 in as my family loves traditional "green chili" and this was very similar in taste when using pork. I added a pinch of ground chipotle seasoning which gave it a little bite and used more broth than called for as my potatoes were large. We loved this recipe and I am sure we will make it all winter long!

I really enjoy good stew and this is a fantastic alternative for variety. This is so good because the ingredients are nicely balanced. I like spicy foods but I think too much would spoil the already robust flavor. I take it as part of the characteristic of this stew that it is thinner brothed than most people might anticipate but I personally would not change it.

This is a good basic recipe, and Lynn's photo is spot on, but please use fresh chilis, tomatoes and garlic ... plenty of garlic. And 1 lb of beef to 1 tub of HOT green chile. Shake up the beef with flour, plenty of S&P and some cumin before browning. Let it stew til tender, cubed spuds at the end.

I like mine in a bowl with some grated cheddar and sour cream. My DH and kids prefer burritos (fold into flour tortilla, drizzle some juice and cheese on top, nuke for a minute or so). It's even better the next day, if you have any leftovers. Also freezes well (no spuds).

This made me crazy, so have a dutch oven simmering on the stove right now! Enjoy!!

I had the Frontier Restaurant (Albuquerque, NM) in mind when I made the following modifications: seared small cubed  meat, 3 cloves garlic & onions, let them rest & made a rue with 3 tbsp ea. oil and flour, added 1lbs peeled and chopped roasted green chiles &  slowly stir in beef broth and spices, then the meat and onions. Simmer, then added small diced potatoes for the last 30 mins.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I did change it a little, browned the meat for about 15 minutes, removed.  then browned the onion but also added a sliced jalapeno pepper and sliced carrots.  I ended up using about 2 1/2 cups of beef broth.  Instead of adding the potatoes to the broth I cooked them separately  in water with about 3 cloves of garlic.  Mashed the potatoes and served the stew over the mashed potatoes.  It was great!  Next time I will thicken the broth a little.  When a recipe turns out well my husband says "Now that is company worthy!"

This was pretty good with added garlic and a 7-pepper blend when the meat was cooking. I like soft potatoes, so I didn't feel like the potatoes were cooked enough after the full hour and a half cooking, so I extended the cooking time to 2 hours. This would probably be even better in a crock pot. My wife said it was a little warm, so I will avoid the seven pepper blend next time.

My mother use to make this all the time when we were kids and we loved it so I was looking for an actual recipe since you can't "measure" a true Mexican woman's skills in the kitchen. This turned out to be a decent starter recipe but it's lacking in a few areas. It definitely needs celery and for the amount of meat it calls for, the spices/veggies need to be doubled as well. Not to mention the use of minced garlic instead of powder and adding can of tomato sauce for additional flavor.  Also I was very surprised that it only required 1.5 cups of beef broth. I used a whole carton and STILL had to add some water to give it more juice, otherwise it would have been all meat. Either way I made it work and my white husband was satisfied...lol. Overall very soso.

Wow, this soup will stand up and kick you!  It packs the heat.  I made it according to the recipe except I didn't have potatoes, so I added hominy and corn instead.  I also used hamburger instead of stew meat.  Might only add half the peppers next time, and a quarter of the cumin.

This was OK for us.  It needed to cook a lot longer than the recipe stated.  In fact, I think it would be a good one for the slow cooker.  It tasted fine, but the meat was still a little tough.  Didn't taste any thing like the green chili stew I have gotten in NM.  Thanks for sharing.

This will be come a staple in our house. Gracias, Lynn.  I made it mostly as submitted here, just added a piece of pepper bacon to simmer with the stew and I doubled the amount of cumin and included some mild red chile powder along with a pinch of Mexican oregano.  I scrubbed the potatoes well and left the skins on before cubing them. This is a great recipe because not only does it taste really good and is easy to prepare, but you could add extra to it, dress it up with grated cheese on top, serve with tortillas, cornbread etc.; it's just great to be able to make a satisfying dish with all needed ingredients on hand.

This was very flavorful and easy to make.  Based on other reviews I was not expecting this to be spicy at all but it did have a bite to it and I was hesitant to give it to my 18 month old.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding an additional can of regular diced tomatoes since the can of tom with chilis I had were petite cut.  Will make again and maybe try with Pork next time.  Thanks! P.S. Made a 2nd time with diced Pork Loin and added a can of corn and it was fantastic.

I thought this was a fine everyday dinner recipe.  Very easy. It lacked a little something, but I'll figure that out the next time I make it.  I used a very inexpensive cut of beef and it was very tender (Acid from tomatoes) withou having to cook all day or taste like tomato sauce.

I 'accidentally' overcooked this, and it turned out fabulous!  Now I always do it this way ... cook ALL the broth off, then deglaze the pan with another can of seasoned beef broth (and sometimes I add a little red wine) and cook it down again.  Yum!

I prefer pork instead of beef with green chili.  I also use posole instead of potatotes in a 'stew' variation.  I place it in the slow cooker overnight; using lots of garlic, and onions.  The next morning I add the cumin and oregano, salt and pepper.

Love this recipe! The only thing I added to it was a dash of Taco Bell Mild Taco Sauce. I also put this together in the crock pot after browning the meat with onions, and it made for a great dinner.

This is so good.  It has a comforting heat to it.  Not like your mouth's on fire, but you can feel the heat.  I used 2-1/2 pounds of meat and pulled 1/2 pound out before I added the potatoes.  I cut up this meat and used it to make quesadillas.  I would have added some tabasco for extra heat.  Serve with your favorite heated tortillas.  YUMMY!!!!!

This was fantastic! I had never made or eaten green chili stew until now. My boyfriend is from New Mexico and said this recipe tasted better than his own family's recipe. I followed the recipe exactly but I also added 3 chopped poblano peppers that I roasted and peeled. I also used extra lean stew meat that had been tenderized (I hate fatty meat!).

This stew tasted a lot like regular beef stew with a little kick to it. I doubled the green chilies, added a little extra beef broth, added a tsp. of chopped garlic, and used 3 medium-sized potatoes. I put the potatoes in 30 minutes after the stew was started and then I still had to cook it for 1 1/2 hours more to get the potatoes and meat tender. Total cooking time for me was 2 hours. I liked the stew and will probably make it again, but the next time I'll add another can of Ro-Tel tomatoes along with my other additions. My hubby thought it was just okay.

Fantastic stew!  I make Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Meat the day before(substitute dried chili flakes for bottle of hot sauce), shred and add to stew recipe rather than using stew meat. It's fantastic served with warmed flour tortillas.  My hispanic boyfriend and I love this stew!   Thanks for sharing Lynn!  :o)

Very good recipe.  I prefer pork, so I cubed a small pork roast and browned with the onions and some garlic.  Also, I use chicken broth instead of beef, about 3 to 4 cans depending on size of roast and the amount of potatoes. If you have access to a farmers market that offers roasted green chilis I highly recommend using those instead of canned (takes about 6 to 8 large ones).  Fall is the season for roasted green chilis but aren't available in all areas of the country. Enjoy!

Very good.  A good change of pace from the old carrots and potato stew.  I added more diced tomatoes - 10 oz just wasn't enough....

Great base!  I live in New Mexico so I was able to tweak this a little. I used frozen green chili‚Äôs HOT!!, my preference. I added about 3 stalks of celery. Some have mentioned issues with potatoes not getting done. I was told the problem was the acid in the tomatoes. So, when I make now, I peel and dice lots of taters, my preference again, cover with water and microwave 15-20 mins til almost soft. I add the potatoes and about 1/3 of water cooked in at the last to my crock and walk away. This is something I usually have to make 2 batches of...some can‚Äôt do the heat but love the stew.

Made this using fresh roasted chilies (Hatch). I pretty much followed the recipe except increased the tomatoes and beef broth out of concern of having enough to feed myself and three men. It was more of a soup than stew but turned out delicious. Served with cornbread. I will definitely make it again.

Great starting point for recreating a stew that a local restaurant no longer offers. Made similar adjustments to others ‚Äì doubled chilies, etc. Used fresh rather than canned tomatoes, added 3 sliced garlic cloves and 1 tsp dried oregano. And used pork rather than beef. Nailed the flavor I was looking forward to. So happy!

My family loves this stew.  I didn't have the green chili's and just threw it all in a crock pot and cooked on low.  I came out great.  I had just enough heat using the hot Rotel can.  Will make it again and again.

This is a good basic recipe starter for green chile stew.  I always use pork roast or chicken breast and  red potatoes (leave the skin on).   While the roast or chicken is baking in the oven, I put all the other ingredients in a crock pot and let it simmer.  Once the meat is done and cooled, I then cut it in bite size cubes and add it to the crock pot and let it simmer all day.  I use fresh minced garlic and fresh roasted green chile.  Serve in individual bowls and sprinkle with grated sharp cheddar cheese.  Serve with warm flour tortillas.

Delicious! Everyone gave it a two thumbs up and asked that I make this rather the mainstay beef stew. To kick up the heat, I used original Rotel and canned diced jalapenos rather than the canned green chilis.  I also used smoked cumin for a heartier taste.

I love this recipe.  It is simple to prepare and oh so good on these cold, snowy days.  I pump mine up by adding more green chilies.  I use between 6 to 8 small cans of green chilies.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

We had to change this recipe up for a vegetarian version but still really good.  Replaced canned tomatoes and chile with 13 oz. frozen green chili and one chopped fresh tomato. Also added 1 tsp of fresh chopped garlic and one chopped jalapeno.  Used butter instead of oil to give it a good rich flavor.  Added the chopped potatoes with the chili so they could cook a good long time. Great served with fresh tortillas!

I added corn, green beans, cilantro, used ground turkey instead of beef. I also used fresh green chilies I roasted. I threw everything in a crockpot for 6 hrs.  It was great and very healthy. Even with the 6 large chilies I used it wasnt very spicy next time I might use a little jalapeno to spice it up a little.

This was an excellent recipe. I followed the recipe fairly closely. I did use fresh tomatoes and cooked them seperately (homemade version of stewed tomatoes) instead of the Rotel tomatoes. I did not add green pepper/jalapeno to the tomatoes as I was cooking for guests who do not like spicy food. The stew turned out great - not spicy but it had great flavor. I added more potatoes (about 5 medium total) and cooked until the potatoes were very tender and almost mushy. I would make this recipe again.

A definite 5-star rating for this one! My husband and I absolutely love this stew! It has a wonderful flavor and is so easy to make. The only thing I've done differently the last several times I've made it is to add an extra can of the tomatoes w/green chili peppers. This gives the stew a little more body.

This is pretty good as is but the second time I made a few changes:  Added a can of corn, used chicken broth instead of beef, and omitted the tomatoes and just used a can of mild green chilies.  Sometimes I add bacon sliced up and brown it with onions. My husband really likes this soup.

I love this recipe and have been making this for years.  Since my husband loves spicy taste I used a can of tomato with habanero pepper this time.  I also cooked in a crock pot.  He LOVED it!  I did,too!
Thanks for this great recipe!!

This was a great base for green chile stew. We love green chiles so I added an additional can of green chiles. I didn't think it called for enough broth - i ended up using around 3 cups.  A new fave in our house!

This had just the BEST flavor.  Had to change the recipe a bit for what we had on hand.  We had whole pig on the spit to use up.  Guessing about the amount used but thinking more than 2#.  Used 8 Anaheim peppers, roasted, peeled, coarsley cut.  Used 2 t. minced garlic and 1 t. salt, 1/2 t. pepper, 1 1/2 t. cumin, 28oz. (yellow) tomatoes and 4 c. water w/ 4 T. chicken soup base (extra water because wanted extra potatoes).  Chunked 4 medium potatoes then thickened w/ 1/4 c. flour and water at the end.  We are true pork lovers so I think I'll always make it with pork but when the "real pig" runs out, maybe I'll add some liquid smoke to store-bought.  I live where there is lots of Green Chili Stew around and definitely eaten my share.  This is absolutely the best.  The flavor just rules!  Thank you!

I love stew and this one is ok.  I followed the recipe exactly but I didn't get the over the top reaction that others did.

A hearty recipe that I  enjoyed. I spiced it up a bit, because we like it hot here in Arizona.  I was suprised at how flavorful it was.

This was a great recipe. I realized I didn't have any potatoes so I left them out. It didn't matter. This dish was tasty and will be a welcomed addition to the recipe box.

This was just ok. Plenty of flavor, but lacking something...
