I've made this a few times, and I just have to say that it is an awesome oil dough recipe. One downside, it definitely needs something for sweet pies, it is a very savory crust as is.  I usually add 3 - 4 tablespoons of sugar, or add honey in addition to the sugar.  If I prebake it, for things like pudding pies, I even sprinkle some white sugar over the top to bake in during the 10 minutes.   I made one mistake when I used it for my pumpkin pie(I baked the crust first, then added the pumpkin), but I just made another pumpkin pie('tis the season), without prebaking it,  and the crust was PERFECT.  If you double the recipe, it even works for making a 9x13 pie(I feed a LOT of people at times).  Thank you for a recipe that always pleases, and always gets asked for.  Probably will never stop using this...lol.

good recipe - -  very easy!

i recommend mixing the ingredients in a bowl instead of the actual pie plate. it makes less of a mess, and transferring the mixture from the bowl to the pie plate doesnt prove to be difficult.

This recipe was easy and even fun to make.  I didn't pre-bake it, instead I added my pumpkin filling and baked it along with the pie.  Turned out really yummy and flaky.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this crust several times now, and I have recieved compliments EVERY time.   People cannot believe it is a no roll recipe.  It is very crispy/flaky and flavorful.  It doesn't taste like that horrible shortening used in other no roll recipes.  This is very flavorful and SO simple to make.  Wonderful texture.  UPDATE: I am changing my rating to a 5 star - which I do not give out very often.  I have made this crust MANY times now and I get raves EVERY SINGLE TIME.  So, this pie crust deserves 5 stars based on taste and texture alone - not to mention simplicity!

Oh-My-Gosh!! This is, without a doubt, the best pie crust!! I couldn't make a pie crust to save my life, until now. It is so flaky and tender. This will be the only pie crust recipe I will ever turn to. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. 
Update: I use this recipe all the time for pies and quiche, and even some cream soups. It is great with Cream of Carrot soup, Chicken Pot Pie soup or any type of tomato soup. Each time I serve it to guests, they want the recipe. Even my mother wanted it. This is the best for people that avoid butter, margarine and shortening. If you use canola oil, that is much healthier for you. I always make this for a serving of 10, it gives a nice thick crust.

Super easy!  I can't roll pie crust either, and this is tasty.  I added nutmeg as suggested, and placed the crust in an 8x8 spuare pan, topped it with fresh apple pie filling and a little crumb crust to make apple pie squares.  Yummy-and you don't have to eat a big piece-thanks!!

I love making this recipe. Everyone always wants me to make a pie, I usually try not to only because I really hate making the pie crusts. So now, everyone, myself included will be happy I'll be taking request again.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I hate rolling out pie crust, it's so messy, and this is simple, easy, and turns out flaky and tasty.  FABULOUS!

I think for a fast pie crust w/o the worry of rolling, it's really good. I was concerned it would be too oily, but it turned out quite nice. Had a nice flavor and was flaky. I did add 1/2 tsp of butter flavor to it, but otherwise followed it exactly. I used this for apple pie since I failed miserably rolling out a traditional crust! I'll use this one again :)

Although this recipe can't beat a good old flaky roll out pie crust... when you are in a pinch it serves it's purpose. It actually turned out a lot better then I expected. You only need to bake the pie crust first if you are filling with ingredients that will not be baked, such as chocolate pudding. And, if you are making a "baked" pie then just follow the recipes instructions for the baking time and temp.

Excellent.  I left out the sugar, because I was using the crust for a pot pie.  At the same time, I also made the other No Roll Pie Crust recipe on this site...this one is definitely superior to that one.

I have even made this substituting olive oil for half the oil (again for a savory dish, not a dessert pie) and it was delicious!!

This is a 5 star recipe if I ever tasted one, and it has nothing to do with how easy it is to make (and it is incredibly easy)! It was an absolutely perfect crust - rich, moist, flaky, and flavorful. My mom ate a piece of my apple pie and told me I should make the crust that way from now on. Yum! (PS: I added 3 tablespoons of sugar as some reviewers suggested since I was making sweet pie).

i made this using whole wheat pastry flour and 2t of honey instead of sugar.  i used a bit less canola oil because of the liquid in the honey... and cooked it for the recommended time.. it did brown on the upper edges and the rest looked fine. hard to cook to a golden brown when it is already brown when you mix it! anyhow,i do think that it had too much oil or something.. and it could definitely use being more sweet somehow.  I used this for a lemon meringue pie. will make again, but using less oil and perhaps some sugar or some sort or splenda. would definitely be better 'as is' for a savory pie rather than sweet.

This is by far the easiest pie crust I've made - and it tastes great!  I did change the recipe to better suit my preference, though.  The recipe, as is, is a good one - if you like a REALLY flaky crust.  I, however, like my crust a little less flaky.  Flaky enough to crumb a little when you cut it, but not so flaky it leaves so many crumbs behind.  The two things I changed were the oil & milk.  I used 1/3 C oil and 3 Tbsp milk.  This gives it a more dense, yet still flaky crust.

I HATE making pie crust (and a complete failure when I try) and I truly thought I was doomed to never EVER be able to make a home-made crust. I am now a real pie baker, thanks to this recipe. I completly stumbled upon it as I was browsing pie recipes and because of that happy accident my life is now complete. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for an easy, delicious, flaky, no fail pie crust! I will never buy another pre-made, or cry and curse over roll-out pie crust again. One tiny change I make is to put 1T. of sugar instead of 1t. sugar in when I make sweet pies, I leave out the sugar altogether for savory pies. This recipe has changed my life (a little dramatic I know but it's true)!

I also made my own crust.  I altered the recipe and I used 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 cup of grated unsweetened coconut, 1 cup of ground quinoa seeds grond into a flour , 1/2 of whole flaxseeds. Do not grind them for this recipe it will not work well. 1 tablespoon of agave nectar, 1tbs of cinnamon powder,  1/2 tsp. sea salt, and 1tbs of vanilla essence, and 1/2 cup of extra virgin coconut oil.  I got two (2) pie shells from that recipe and I pressed them down into the 9in pie dishes. I took a fork, and punched holes through the pie shells, and I baked them for 45mins. at 250 degrees because coconut oil burns at high temperature, and also to preserve the nutrients in the pie crusts. It was delicious!!! You can still enjoy desserts, just make them a little healthier!!!! Enjoy!!!

I used coconut oil and 1/2 whole wheat flour, and added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, since I was making a sweet pie. The crust is a bit dense, it would be perfect for something heavy like chicken pot pie, but it isn't really quite right for a sweet pie. The taste was good, but I think I was mainly enjoying the coconut flavor.

I've made this wonderful recipe for 40 years as a quick alternative to a rolled crust. Wisk the oil and milk together in the measuring cup before adding to the flour mixture in the pie plate for even blending of the ingredients. I think it works best prebaked (I bake at 425 degrees F.)with a cooked filling such as in lemon meringue pie. However, I was surprised to find that this even works, unbaked, as a quiche crust without getting soggy. When used unbaked, it stays crisper if the pie is baked for 10 minutes at 425 degrees F and then reduced to your pie recipe temp to finish baking. Expect this crust to be tender and crumbly rather than flaky like a shortening rolled crust...different, but good in its own way. I've come to use this more frequently out of laziness, and because I don't want to use hydrogenated fats. I've tried to reduce the ratio of oil, but all my efforts have been less tender. Corn oil and mixed vegetable oils workd just as well.

Easy. Delicious. Buttery--despite the utter lack of butter in my non-dairy version! In the words of my five-year-old: "This is very, very good!" I made it last night for a chicken pot pie. I used only half the salt (only because I've found that things that taste normal to most people taste super salty to me), used olive oil instead of canola, and soy milk instead of regular milk. Mixed it up in seconds. Then, since I needed a top crust as well as a bottom crust, I mixed it up in a bowl and then took some of the mixture out for the bottom crust and rolled out the rest for the top of the pot pie. It turned out perfectly. I have two pre-made pie crusts sitting in my freezer and I think they will be sitting there for awhile...why bother with pre-made when from-scratch turns out so darn good?! :) Thanks for sharing this recipe--can't wait to try it again!

Very, very good pie crust. There was absolutely no need to pre-bake this crust. I used pumpkin pie to fill the crust and it came out perfect. Delicious, slightly crumbly and flaky. It did not fall apart or crumble when slicing the pie and it held together when lifted out of the pan. Definitely a keeper. Almost forgot to add: I added 3 tablespoons of sugar because I like my dessert crusts to be sweet. Thanks for sharing.

This is fantastic!  Used this for a quiche crust and my husband said the next day, "This quiche crust is awesome."  
I did 1.5 times the recipe because I was using a BIG corningware pie crust.  12 inches, I think. The crust turned out light textured, rich tasting, crumbly/flaky, and delicious.  

I use this recipe exclusively now for one crust pie recipes.  Nice not to have to use up butter or shortening to make the crust.

Update: I have used this for years now and it's still my go-to recipe for no-roll crust.  Get raves every time.  I think the milk makes it flaky.  After making it for this long, I now do the mixing in the pie pan.  So thanks for that instruction for those of us who use this recipe a lot!

I am not able to make a crust. I have an apple tree in my yard and wanted to make a pie. Hours before Irene hit us I decided to make one. I looked for a quick crust recipe with ingredients I had. I only added extra sugar per reviews and in under an hour I had a pie. I also used the Apple Crumble Pie recipe from here. Thank you Laura for posting this quick and easy recipe!

Oh my!  I make pie and quiche so seldomly because I can't be bothered to roll a crust - no more!  This is fabulous, flaky, and no mixing bowl or rolling pin required!  I doubled the recipe and used it in a 9x13 pan for quiche and it turned out great.  So happy I found this!

This was very easy to make, but tasted very flour-y and I ended up just scooping the filling out the pie and eating that

Doubled the recipe to fit a 9x13. Made it for a quiche and it was great. Would definitely make again.

Very tender & flaky!!  I am a terrible cook who usually uses a refrigerated pie crust that you just unroll into the pan.  Unfortunately, I forgot to buy one, and the supermarket is a half hour away.  I had no solid shortening and no rolling pin, so I decided to try this recipe.  It is super easy and delicious.  No more refrigerated crusts for me!

I was very pleased with this pie crust.  I made it exactly as written, but pre-baked it for five minutes before adding the filings.  I made the Dutch Apple Pie with Oatmeal Streusel recipe and Mrs. Sigg's Fresh Pumpkin Pie.  Both turned out wonderfully.  The pie crust was very tender and flakey.  This will be my go-to recipe for single crust pies.  It works for both sweet and savory fillings.

Very good.  After reading the reviews I added extra sugar to the mix and I also substituted coconut oil for canola.  Gave it a real nutty kind of flavor.  The crust turned out beautifully with a flaky texture and rich flavor...a great compliment to go with the pumpkin I poured into it.

never made a pie crust before. the texture was good...flaky  and didn't burn. i thought the flavor lacked something...was a little dull. needed more sugar or buttery, spicy something. easy to make though!

This crust is more like a shortbread crust than a flaky crust.  It was very good with a Hillbilly Pie filling from this site.  The filling was very sweet so I didn't need a super sweet crust.  Good.  I will use again.

This is an easy to make crust.  I make it in a bowl and then press into pie plate.  I haven't tried rolling it, but seems like it would roll well too.

I used it with the Lemon Sour Cream Pie for Thanksgiving.  GREAT crust and awesome lemon custard too.

I don't understand why everyone thinks this pie crust was "flaky." Personally, mine was a bit dry.

I must admit I was skeptical at first, but this crust is wonderful! I'm from the old school of rolling/cold shortening cut into chunks/ice-water/small peas & cornmeal...(you know the drill)...and I just didn't think that OIL (of all things!)could produce such a flaky/tender/light/TASTY crust that's made right in the pie plate!! I thought it was not possible...but I'm a believer now and will probably never roll out a crust again!!

This is a decent substitution for another recipe on this site that is similar but uses vegetable oil. I just don't like the flavor of canola oil, and I found that flavor to be pretty heavy in this crust. I will make it again, but with a different oil.

This is the recipe that my mother in law uses for pie crust. She never shared the recipe but I found it here:) Use it for banana cream pie and comes out perfect everytime. I do mix in a seperate bowl rather than the pie plate. We love it!! and easy too!!

This is very good and VERY easy.  I adjusted the recipe for 12 servings because I had a large, deep dish pie plate (pampered chef).  May have been a bit too much dough.
This is so flaky though.  The only thing I would say about the taste, is that it is almost better for a savory type pie recipe, such as quiche or chicken pot pie.  It will work for a sweet pie, like fruit, cream, etc, but it is a little salty tasting.  Still HIGHLY recommended based on ease and flakiness!  Thanks Laura!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

I wanted soooo much to love (or even like) this recipe. I hate making pie shells and thought this would be the perfect solution. It was easy, even my 3 year old had a blast pressing it into the pie plate with me but the end result left much to be desired. It is very crumbly, not at all flaky in my opion and tastes like, well, oil and flour. I will keep this recipe for those times when I need a quick pie shell but would not use this to serve to guests - EVER.

I'm a big fan of this crust. The sifting makes a difference. It works great for the quiches I make about once a week. I think it tastes just as good as crust made from shortening, with half the work. I wouldn't use this recipe if I were making a pie because I like a thick flaky crust for sweet pies, but for a quiche this works great. This is the best oil crust recipe I have come across.

This pie crust would be great with a little added molasses, and FULLY melted butter instead of oil. Makes it less savory and great for pumpkin pies [which, mine at least, already include molasses]

this was my first 'made from scratch' pie crust and i must say it was easier than i expected!  i mixed it right in the pie plate, and while i ended up kneading it with my hands i am not disappointed!  it's yummy, light and pretty.

This is my go to pie crust for quiche.  In the past when I made a quiche the crust was always soggy-even if I prebaked it.  Not with this recipe.  I still prebake with this recipe, but the quiche comes out perfect.  I do prepare the crust in a small bowl and then move it to the pie plate (I find this less messy).

I use this recipe all the time when I am making chicken pot pie in a 13 x 9 pan.  I just double the recipe, I leave out the sugar.  I DO roll out the dough because I need a nice rectangle to cover my potpie, but it is so simple to throw together and makes such an easy & I can have the whole thing ready for the oven in about 15-20 minutes tops.   It is so easy and good - my family loves it this way, and it definitely beats the bisquick topping in my opinion.

I love to bake and feel guilty buying premade pie crust. This recipe is delish and easy to make. I even used it for my top crust on my apple pie. After mixing the ingredients in a bowl I dumped it out on a sheet of waxed paper and pressed it out into a circle. Then I just flipped it over (carefully) on top of my pie and pressed the edges. I will never buy premade crust again. Thank you for sharing! My grandmother would be so proud of me :)

I didn't really like this crust.  Made it exactly as the recipe called for except for adding a little extra sugar.  I thought it was rather bland and I found it oily.  I gave it 3 stars because it was really easy but I will not be using this recipe again.

Great recipe! Super easy and incredibly quick to make! I halved the amount of salt called for to 1/4 tsp though. Personally I don't mind the rolling part when making a conventional pie crust, its all that chilling and resting that bothers me. This recipe takes all that away and more. Flaky too. Definitely a keeper. Thanks Laura!

WOW!  This was the first time I ever made a real pie or any crust for a pie.  I am SO GLAD that I read the reviews and followed their instructions.  My pumpkin pie got rave reviews from my husband who is a pastry chef and he loved the crust.  GO FIGURE!!  I even accidently cooked the pie crust before adding the pumpkin in and cooking it. Thanks to a friend's pie shield, I was able to cook the crust for almost 40min and it didn't burn!!  This is now my go to recipe for future baked pie crusts:)

I use this recipe every year for pumpkin pie.  This turns out perfect every time and I agree that there is no need to prebake the crust.  I follow the pumpkin pie filling recipe and this turns out awesome.  I highly recommend this to everyone!!

Great recipe! I added 3 1/2 tbsp sugar since I was using it for pumpkin pie (Libby's Famous Pumpkin Pie recipe from this site). Mixing ingredients in a bowl rather than the pie plate was good advice to reduce mess. Super easy for someone who had never before made crust.

This pie crust comes out perfect EVERY TIME!  My mom's even rolled it and it came out great.  So simple and consistent results earn this top marks from me.  It's also super quick, I turned out two crusts for a pot pie tonight in about 5 minutes. The only thing I do differently is to mix it up in a separate bowl first.

Wonderful recipe!!!!! I don't like to cook with butter because it's so bad for your health, so this is quite a descovery. I made a quiche and I did bake the crust for about 8-10 min before filling it. Thanks for sharing...you have earned the 5 stars!

This is a really great and simple recipe. I added some cinnamon to give it some flavor, and the texture is great and flaky!  However, the flavor was lacking, and definitely needs more sugar. I didn't prebake it either, and my pear pie came out great :)

This wasn't quite as good as a pie crust made with margarine - it was more crumbly and dry, but boy was it quick and easy, and it tasted good too.

I don't really like rolling out pie crusts, either, thus this is a nice alternative.  It isn't a particularly attractive crust, but is quite suitable for a savory pie.  I melted a stick of butter rather than using oil - with a good flavor.  I'll definitely use this again, but will continue to roll out crusts for dessert pies most of the time.

I liked this crust very much: easy to do, no need to roll and no shortening in it (which I don't like and I can't get easily here in Spain, anyway). I used it for a quiche and I'm very happy with the results. Thank you for the recipe.

My mother always had trouble with pie crust so I waited a long time before wanting to try it myself.  This recipe was very easy and turned out flaky with a great texture.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I used it with a custard pie and ended up tasting the oil more than the pie.  I will definitely keep this recipe and take the advice of other reviewers and try melted butter instead of oil next time.  I do agree, however, that it would be an excellent crust for quiche!  Thanks so much for sharing it!

With temps in AZ, I'd chill this for awhile in the fridge after mixing. (Done 5/12/08). Takes some pressing, but it filled a 9" pie pan with this "dough." BOTTOM LINE: Made a mix of classical Quiche Lorraine filling consisting of 3 eggs, onions, herbs, plus some good Black Forest ham, diced. Unfortunately this ain't no Paté Brisée!!! Nevertheless, in a crashing hurry, it works, and it tastes pretty good!

I chose this recipe because I was looking for a thicker crust than my ready-made crusts would provide.  The flavor was fine, and ease of making was great.  However, it lost two stars because the edge of the crust was crumbly, and even though the bottom of the crust held, my husband said it felt like it "disintegrated" in his mouth.  I'll keep this recipe around, but am unsure if I'll ever use it again...

Wasn't really what I was hoping for. The first few bites weren't too bad but after eating a little bit, it just didn't taste good. The taste and texture just seemed "off" to me. I'll keep looking. I give it a 3 because it was extremely simple to make.

I use this recipe all the time to make crusts because they don't sell pre-made pie crusts in the Czech Republic. This always turns out great, but I make minor changes. I found that there is too much liquid in this so I just decrease the amount of oil and pour in milk till it seems done. I have used this for quiche, chicken pot pie, and even real pies (i just put some sugar in it).

This a simple yet very effective pie crust that can be used with any type of filling. I use this recipe every week for my breakfast casserole, which I sell in our church's coffee cafe.  The crust is simple to assemble and I prefer unbleached flour. I also use a recipe and a half in order to fill my large commercial baking pan.  I do bake it for 8 minutes in a 350 degree oven and then add my egg mixture and rebake. The crust always comes out tender and flaky. I heard this is a great crust for fruit fillings, as well. Just follow the recipe as is and it will work out fine.

I just made this w/lemon meringue pie and the sweetness perfectly off sets the tartness of the pie. This crust has almost the same taste as a sweet crumb topping. I did not have any canola oil so used olive oil instead. Delicious!

This was great!  I was terrified to make a pie crust, but this came out very nice and flacky.  I made two crusts, one was a little 'soggy' but i think that was my fault.  the other was absolutley wonderful.  Thanks so much!  I will be using it again for pumpkin pie this Thanksgiving!

The best pie crust I have ever made uses cream cheese and butter, but with the outrageous price of butter these days, I am always looking for ways to substitute this expensive ingredient. This recipe does the trick. It is easy and convenient to make, and makes a tasty pie crust as well.

Really good crust! :) I made it for a banana cream pie and it turned out wonderful. I can't wait to try this out with a quiche! I'll probably be using this recipe for all the single-crust pies that I make in the future.

Not the best pie crust ever, but oh so easy. I used peanut oil instead of canola, and it was still good.

Very simple, easy to bake with, and good!  Great for pies or quiches, as I used it for both and recevied numerous compliments on the crust.  I'll use this from now on instead of anything pre-baked.

I use this recipe for when I make quiche but I omit the sugar. If I use it for pumpkin pie or other sweet pies I keep the sugar but reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp. Love it. It’s a simple recipe for those of use who just can’t master rolling out dough.

Well it was quick, and easier than dealing with rolling out and transferring my usual crust recipe, but although the no-roll crust came out ok after blind-baking and using it for quiche, the trouble came the next day after the left-overs had been refrigerated then reheated.  The once crispy crust literally fell apart as the oil used separated from it -- was very greasy and unappetizing.  I'd likely use again for crusts I know will be eaten in one sitting, but not for something I know will end up with left-overs.

I didn't have a store bought crust in the fridge, and I hate rolling out pie crusts. The flavor was good, but the crust was very dry and crumbly. I also didn't pat it out evenly, although I did try. I might try this again. Or I might just stop being lazy and learn how to do it right!

This is the only pie crust I make since stumbling across this recipe years ago. Flaky, yummy goodness! For a 9” pie, I make 1.5 servings. Quick, simple, easy. Get ready for most anyone who bakes their own pie crust to ask for the recipe!!!

Fabulous!  Flakey and tasty crust. It remained so for the next day. I definitely will use this recipe again, especially during the summer when making no-bake fruit fillings. 
*Instead of milk I used 2 Tbs. of my homemade kefir.

This recipe is great - I will never attempt to make or even buy another pie crust again.  It is so easy and tastes great.  It's really almost like a shortbread crust and just adds so much to the pie.  I'm not a crust eater, typically I just eat the filling and leave the crust, but not this one - I ate it all!

I love this recipe- when you have three pies to make- and you don't want to mess with rolling out dough- I added regular white sugar an extra couple Tbsp.  For the sweet pies.  Easy and light and flakey!

I was so pleasantly surprised by this!  I used it for Grandma Williams Squash Pie also from this site.  Two new recipes combined, I was sure it wouldn't work.  The crust was as easy as could be!  I did increase the sugar to 1 tablespoon, and added a pinch of cardamom to complement the filling.  It held up to the long cook time with a custard filling perfectly.  It's my new go-to pie crust.  The filling turned out to be amazing also.

Much better than a frozen store bought crust. I will quit buying those now and this will be my go-to for making pies. Easy! Flaky! Tasty! I added 2 tablespoons of sugar to make it sweeter for a pumpkin pie. It was a hit with the family.

I really enjoyed this pie crust when I made it for my pumpkin pies.  I don't normally mind rolling crusts but I figured I would give this a try and I'm glad I did.  One change I made was I used organic extra virgin coconut oil and I can tell you I will never try another kind of oil in it!

I tried this and it was excellent.  So I went one step further I took a ready made crust and made a double crusted apple pie. just leave half inch more crust on top and bottom worked great. But the bottom crust tasted better than the top. so I went one further step and made the top crust with the same no roll crust did on a floured almost flat 10.5 inch plate on top of wax paper and put in FREEZER covered with wax paper. 3 or 4 hours would be sufficient. After filling bottom slide a knife around plate. Let stand TILL PLYABLE. Slide onto pie and then pinch bottom to top and  use fork and press all around. you will be pleasantly surprised. Excess crust can be made into cookies with sprinkled sugar and cinnamon great taste.

I cant make a rolled pie crust to save my life so I wanted to like this, I really did.  But even after a couple of tweaks (an extra tsp of sugar and a tsp of vanilla) it was still not very good.  All I could taste was the oil and it had a "sandy" not flaky texture.  1 star for ease and another star because it wasn't absolutely horrible.

This crust is very crumbly, not flaky. But it's fast and easy and tastes pretty good, though I'd prefer a more buttery flavored crust. I made it with a quiche. Not sure how it would taste with a sweet pie.

This is my go-to recipe for flaky, perfect crust and I have used it countless times. My only changes are to measure the oil and salt on the scant side (slightly less than what is called for). Makes a better tasting crust.  I am so glad I can now make crust without cutting shortening into flour, rolling it out and making a mess of my counters!

I have to admit, this was definitely flaky. However, the crust turned out way too crumbly for me and wouldn't hold its shape. When I cut it with my banana cream pie filling in it, it just fell apart. Sadly, I think I will still be searching for that easy no-roll pie crust recipe.

The whole mixing process took about one minute. I have to admit, the thought that went through my mind was "this was too easy to taste good." But, it really is a wonderful crust! It's very flaky and I think I'll be using it from now on. As another reviewer suggested, I added 3 tbsps of sugar. Next time, I'll increase it to about 4 tbsps.

This is a wonderful pie crust recipe to use for making a savory quiche. I add a few finely chopped, fresh herbs to the pie dough (thyme, rosemary, basil ... whatever your preference) before patting it into the pan. The herbs make the crust extra special--and a perfect complement to my spinach quiche.

I thought this crust tasted delicious for a meat pie I made (the recipe for the filling however, was not delicious). I made a bonehead mistake and wanted to use this crust as a top crust but I didn't have parchment paper to roll it out on so my top "crust" ended up more like delicious patchwork. This was super quick and easy to make and I know I will make this again. Next time I plan on using my food processor with a dough blade to mix and get some parchment paper if I need to make a top crust. Otherwise, just mixing it in the pie dish works wonderfully for a bottom crust! Also, this crust is definitely for savory. I'm not sure how to sweeten it without using a ton of sugar but this crust would be great (it's light and flaky) for quiche, pot pies, etc.

This crust has to be the easiest homemade crust I have ever made. I didn't mix it in the pan I mixed it in a bowl then just dumped it over in the pan and it worked great. I made an apple pie so I didn't prebake it.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe.  I found it for my 10 year old daughter who wanted to make a pie one night and we were all out of store bought pie crusts.  She is now the "Pie Maker" in our house.  Everyone who's tried this loves it.  It isn't a sweet crust, so would be good for chicken pot pie as well as chocolate pie, which is what we usually make, specifically Bev's Chocolate Pie from this site.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I have actually never made homemade crust before but wanted to try my hand at a quiche with crust.  This was the EASIEST thing to make.  My husband said one of the best thing about my quiche was the crust.  He LOVED it!

This was pretty good.  Not like a real pastry, more like a base for a square or bar.  Didn't get soggy.  I will use this again in a pinch. Update - after having used this recipe several times now, this has become my "go-to" recipe for one-crust/crumble-top fruit pies, although I do add a bit more sugar than the recipe calls for. And I mix it in the mixer bowl, not in the pan - it's a lot less mess. I've upgraded my review to 5 stars.  Thank you Laura.

Love this.  I use a large pie pan and it's still a little thick but excellent.  I pat it out well and then stick it in the freezer to chill while I prepare the filling.

I am a failure at pie crusts, and I rely on the store bought ones.  I decided to try this with some fresh pumpkin that I had cooked. It was EXCELLENT.  My husband and I both absolutely love the crust, and talk about easy!!!  This is a keeper in my book!!!

Bye far the BEST quiche crust I've ever made. Did not get soggy, stayed flaky and flavorful even after reheating. And so quick to make! No hydrogenated shortening either! This one's a keeper.
