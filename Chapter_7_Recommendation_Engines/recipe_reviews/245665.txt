I thought it was tasty, colorful and definitely different and I am ALWAYS up for something new and out of the ordinary. I found it while searching for something to bring to a "Moroccan-themed" dinner party. Was going to give it 4 stars. But a friend of mine called the next day to see if they could have some of the leftover carrot dip, her husband absolutely loved it, it reminded him of a house specialty salad dressing he had had at a restaurant once that really impressed him. So for his love of it, I'm giving it the extra star.

I found this very interesting flavor wise and served it with celery sticks and pita bread wedges at a work potluck.  I was received with mixed reviews.

Love the perfect combination of texture and flavors of this dip! I added a bit more cayenne pepper to zip it up.  Also excellent with an assortment of vegetables to dip with.

Really good!  I thought apricot preserves would make this dip too sweet so I used dried apricots and cooked them with the carrots. I made pita chips and took it to a Moroccan themed pot luck and it was a big hit. I will reduce the sesame oil a bit if I make it again as it seemed to overpower the carrots.

taste was nice and different but it turned out more like a soup so i could not take it to a work party. not enough time to buy more carrots and boil them up.
