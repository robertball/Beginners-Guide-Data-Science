I made this and it came out great! Now as white nor as fluffy as that commercial  bread from my childhood but almost identical to the bread my Grandma made every Saturday (several loaves to last for sandwiches throughout the week for a family of 5) and I ate every time I went to visit her. Thank you Chef John for taking me back to the great memories of my childhood!

The grandmother of my best friend in high school used to make homemade bread every week for her family. It was the best I’d ever tasted, and the texture was different than any other bread I’d eaten. We’ve talked many times about Grandma’s bread and how much we wish we had the recipe... but there was none! A handful of this, a pinch of that... was how Grandma made it. I’ve tried MANY bread recipes since but found none that even came close… until now. This bread took my back to my youth and I can’t wait to tell my friend about it. Other reviewers mentioned that is has a cake-like texture and it IS a bit more “crumbly” than some breads but the slices still hold together just fine and the flavor is excellent. It’s a dense, moist, delicious bread that is definitely worth trying!

I love Chef John's recipes overall but I wasn't too crazy about this one. The taste was right but the consistency was a bit to "cakey" for me.  Is that a word?  Anyway, that's what it was.

This bread is really tastey. I'm a beginner bread baker and made a bad sourdough loaf the other day so I needed an easy win. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I love all Chef John’s recipes. He is a genius. The bread was so easy to make and it looks good and tastes even better than its look.

I've made this recipe four times now, each time we love it. This last time I decided to watch the video, I realized I'd been adding way too much flour.  I'm not used to the dough turning out so wet, so I'd keep adding until it resembled what I'm used to. I'm surprised that each time the loaf tasted good. I am happy to report that following the instructions precisely rendered amazing results. This truly is a great bread recipe, thank you for sharing.
