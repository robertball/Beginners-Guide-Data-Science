These had good flavor but too sweet to be good on hamburgers.  I think that I will take these and make sweet relish out them.  It will taste good on hot dogs.

these are good if you take out the sugar. I made mine with a little kick and added red pepper flakes to 2 jars and left out the sugar for the other jars this is the classic dill pickles slice recipe that will stay in my recipe box.. if you like the sweetness keep it in or just try it in one or two jar I don't care for the sweet so I kept it out... thanks for sharing your recipe....

I made these when my garden was overflowing with cucumbers.  I have been in search of a good sliced dill recipe for sometime.  These were easy to make.  I just opened my first jar yesterday when we grilled hamburgers.  Contrary to the first review, we did not find these too sweet for our burgers at all.  They are tasty!  I will definitely be keeping this recipe.

My husband made this recipe for the first time. He is new to pickling/canning but swears he followed the recipe to a "T", except he used a different brand of pickling salt, Morton All Natural Canning and Pickling Salt (already had it on hand, so why buy more?). The pickles turned out WAY too salty for everyone's liking. It's a shame because we have a lot of pickles that probably won't get eaten. This seems to be the only negative review on this recipe, so I'm willing to consider that maybe something he did, or didn't do, had an affect on the outcome. Any input from other users of this recipe would be greatly appreciated.

These are excellent dill pickles. Wonderful flavor. I was given a jar and absolutely love them. The slight sweetness reminds me of German dills.

These were very good pickles. I tried three recipes and my family liked these the best. I only put 2T of sugar.. we don't like them too sweet.

I am new to this,at the end it said cool and store does this mean I don't have to refrigerate the jars.  also, fresh dill is there any way to save it. one bunch was way more than i needed.
