We loved this recipe.  We made a few minor changes by deleting the fennel and using diced tomatoes instead of sauce.  I also did not use the water.

This recipe was yummy.  I served it over basmati rice and my husband loved it!  I too left out the fennel (neither one of us like it), and used stewed tomatoes instead of sauce.  I seasoned the chops prior to cooking and left everything else exactly as the recipe said.  It will be on my new menu rotation!

I would like to add that if the pork is tough, it was probably frozen prior to cooking.  Freezing meat denatures the protein of the meat and makes it tough.  I suggest that for the most tender and flavorful dishes, use fresh meat.  This is especially true for steaks, roasts, chicken breasts and chops (solid cuts of meat).

I made this tonight, it was a very easy and tasty dish.  I followed the suggestions of the previous posters and utilized a can of diced tomatoes with my 6 cutlets.  I didn't have any fennel, so I had to omit that as well.  I loved all the spices and would recommend seasoning your pork loins before browning.  I also added two cloves of crushed garlic while cooking the sliced onions. I also added a bit of Italian salad dressing while it simmered. Next time I won't add the water either, although it didn't hurt the taste. I made a side of rice, with green beans and bisquits.  Turned out great!

Very simple, quick and delicious. I followed recipe exactly except for decreasing the amount of chili powder and it was still very spicy.  I am rating it 4 stars because this should be called SPICY Tomato Pork Loin Chops. I served it with the boxed Pasta Roni - Angel Hair Pasta with Parmesean cheese -it was a great compliment and absorbed some of the heat!!!!  Salad was another "cool" addition! I will make this again.  Thanks submitter.

Very good, and easy. And, thankfully, a good pork chop recipe not so heavy in sugar that my diet can't handle it!  It's always nice to find healthy and tasty in one dish.
I spiced the pork chops before browning, as per some other suggestions
I saw a couple of people called this tough--- I really have no clue how that could be with all the liquids in the recipe, unless they spent too long browning or had freezer-burned chops. Mine were VERY moist.

I love this recipe!  It's one of my favorites.  I especially love the fennel - I double it.  I crush the fennel and add it with the sugar when I cook the onion.  I double the tomato sauce and add a can of diced tomato, substituting the juice for the water.

I haven't made this yet, but it is almost identical to the Old West Style Pork Chops recipe I was given over 30 years ago and is a family favorite. Preheat oven to 350. I use 1 can diced tomatoes, juice and all, fill the tomato can with water, swirl it around a bit and add to skillet. Put 1 c. rice in a casserole dish; stir in the liquids from the skillet; top with browned chops and bake until all of the liquid has been absorbed - about 45 minutes.  This works well in a crock pot, too; add a second can of diced tomatoes and cook on low 8-10 hours.

This is not a good dish at all. The pork came out tough. The taste was all tomato. We all agreed, over dinner, that we would not make this dish again.

Very good and very easy.  I really liked the taste of the crushed fennel.  I left out the red pepper flakes, my chili powder was spicy enough. I did add more onion and sugar (just made it a full tsp.)  Every one loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I used to make this dish, but baked the 
pork chops in the  oven, we were a family of seven, then removed excess grease then added the tomato mixture without the fennel.It was a favorite of our family. 
I used a can of whole tomatoes broken up by hand instead of the canned sauce and added !/2 a bay leaf. 
They liked having this with  crispy homade fried potatoes, just remove the excees fat at the end. To make the pork chops stay flat I usually make a few small slits on the edges. Usually served a salad with it to complete the meal.
I tried adding the fennel to half the recipe and that was tasty too. 
I am now a household of one, so I can make it in a skillet.

I did not care for this. I bought center cut thin-cut pork chops and pounded them even thinner at home. The spices make a very weird and too thick of a sauce. Too much chili powder. Husband and I both said "not a keeper". I served it with couscous to absorb the sauce. Just didn't like it (and I followed it to the letter, other than having to add a little beef stock because the sauce just dried up).

It was a little too spicy and had I added the pepper flakes, it would be super hot. But people who likes realy spicy food, this is a good one!

We really liked this. Though I will admit I made a few changes. I had large, thick bone-in chops and I kept them that way, so of course the cooking time was longer. I omitted the fennel since I don't have any, nor do I really care for it enough to buy any just for this. I did add some fresh rosemary, which is always a nice addition, imo. I used brown sugar rather than white, halved the amount of chili powder since it's a tad strong and overwhelming, and doubled the red pepper flakes (we like it hot!). Oh, and I used diced tomatoes. Whew! Still, I think I was able to capture the gist of this lovely recipe. The thick chops came out so juicy and tender and the overall flavor was fantastic. I think the brown sugar really made a big difference. I served it all over fries and realized this was like a lot of the meals I had in Spain.  Definitely a keeper in our kitchen!

I cooked this recipe exactly as written, and it was great.  If you drop ingredients, like the fennel, you do not have the same recipe anymore.  I would suggest that you try the recipe just like it is, then alter it the next time if you need to.  My whole family liked this one, even my picky 11 year old.  Use fresh meat and it wont turn out dry, unless you cook it too long.

Sorry, this is not a recipe I'll be making again. It was easy to put together and I don't mind a dish with some heat, but 2 tsps of chili powder in essentially only one cup of sauce ? I only used 1½ tsp and I still found it too much. Also, I didn't care for the combination of chili powder and fennel.

Fantastic! Loved the subtle combination of the spices. Crushed all spices together. Sauce Reminded me of mole in texture due to the tomato sauce. Used thick chops and they came out juicy. Will make again!

OMG, delicious!!! When I tell my husband, I'm going to make and "experiment" he says "oh boy", he said "THAT'S A KEEPER"  The only thing I did different was I used bone-in thin, center cut and trimmed most of the fat off. Bone-in gives a better flavor.  We are not really big on Oregano, so I cut that down in 1/2 and used the other 1/2 with basil along with those spices,  THE SPICY FLAVOR OF THE PEPPER/CHILLI and fennel, just a wonderful combination.  We had Parmesan Potatoes and Apple Sauce as sides. (the sauce was really good over the potatoes.)

Very Good, If you don't like Fennel seeds leave them out, the people who said the pork was dry might not have pounded the pork thin, I pounded the pork to about 1/8 inch and it was nice and juicy.

This recipe was delicious! Flavor combinations were great! Loved the little kick of spice! I did two things different - I added 1 clove of chopped garlic to onions, and I only lightly crushed the fennel seeds in order to hold back some of the flavor. I will definitely make this again!!!

Served with a side of rotini.  Added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes for extra sauce. Some strange flavors going on.

It was okay, but I wouldn't cook it again.

Good recipe.  Used almost all the same ingredients.  I used a can of diced tomatoes because I did not have tomato sauce.  I also seasoned the tenderlions with the dry spices before searing them in the pan.

We love this recipe.  I started cooking one night, before I made sure that I had all of the ingredients so I ended up using 'chili ready' tomatoes instead of chili powder and tomato sauce I left out the fennel, oregeno, and red pepper flakes.  It turned out amazing!  My husband doesnt like pork chops, but if I make them with this recipe he will eat it all and any leftovers!

I make almost the same thing except I put the Pork Chops in my slow cooker and use no fennel and diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  I also add green beans and cut up potatoes in the slow cooker and have a whole meal.  The pork chops get so tender they can be cut with a fork.  This is one of our favorite meals.

I didn't have time to read any reviews but when I saw the photo it looked liked diced (stewed) tomatoes so that's what I used.  Because of that I didn't need water.  It was pleasantly spicey.  I will definitley make this again and try different kinds of meat.  My husband loved it, also.

This was exceptional. I did end up baking mine in the oven on 350 degrees for 30 min. I also added a little parm cheese.  Served with linguine and salad.  Very good and nice kick to it!

I really liked this side dish. Mine was a bit too tomatoey for most, but I thought it was perfect. :) Went well with some rice. :)

I guess this just wasn't our thing.  I didn't have any fennel so I made it without.  Maybe we'd of liked it better with.  Will try it again with the fennel.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was 'okay' at best. My kids didn't care for it, and they're quite easy to please. It was very bland.

I tried this tonight and I gave it a 4 star mainly for flavor. There are , however, a few things I would do different next time I make this. Being thin sliced Pork the meat came out a tad tougher then I like so next time I will use a thicker cut for moisture.  The other thing for my family, we like our onions more grilled and not "soft n mushy" so I think I will sautee the onions and add them before serving.  I served this with Risotto rice and asparagus and it was quit a yummy combo ;0)

After reading all the other reviews, I to used a can of diced tomatoes ,seasoned the pork chops before frying & omitted the fennel! I sometimes, put the pork chops in the oven.  It came out great and my family loves these pork chops served over rice!

I made it tonight for the first time using boneless loin chops that I pounded down a little. I made the recipe exactly as stated and the flavor was very good.  I will make this dish again.  By the way, it's low cal which is a bonus!!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe (almost) as is since this was the first time I made it.  I used about 1.5lbs of thin cut boneless pork loin chops (6 total). The one other change that I made was to add kale since I had some in my frig that needed to be used.  I followed the directions, but added the kale after cooking the chops covered for 10 min.  I covered the pot for another 5 min until the kale had wilted and then uncovered for the final 10 min.  It turned out so good! I definitely will cook it again! I love that it is mainly a pantry dish and only uses 1 pot- these are both essentials as the working mother of 4 school aged children.

My family, consisting of three generations of males, liked this recipe, includng the 20 yr. old who loves spicey and the 80 yr. old who generally avoids spice.  A pan of corn bread went will with it, good for dipping in the sauce.  I followed the recipe closely.

I made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it was pretty good, had a little kick to it.  Next time I may use less fennel.  I could tell my husband was trying to figure out what "that" smell/taste was... he also thought it was a little spicy, so I would probably cut down the spice.  But personally I liked it.... thought it was something different to do with pork chops.  I served it with butter/herb noodles.

This recipe was excellent!  I followed it to the letter and wouldn't change a thing.  Moist pork, spicy sauce, served over rice-dinner was a hit!  I noticed that a lot of reviewers left the fennel out, a mistake in my opinion-it really adds to the flavor of the sauce.

Excellent recipe Mlyn!!!  My Boyfriend HATES oregano, so I was very hesitant about your recipe.  He stopped short of licking the plate!!!  Keep the recipes comming.  I did not want to cook that night, but after very careful reading, you just brown, boil add chops and simmer.  It doesn't get any simpler than that.

I didn't use the Fennel b/c I didn't have any, used Italian seasoning in place of the oregano also added garlic, as well as diced up red and green bell peppers! Not a big pork eatting but loved this. Think it would be good with chicken as well and severed over rice.

A very tasty dish! I left out the red pepper, my family doesn't care for a lot of heat. The chili gave it just enough kick for us though. I added sliced mushrooms and served over egg noodles. I didn't see the recommendation but it seemed such a natural. I'll definately make it again, I think I'll add two cloves of garlic for just a little pizazz.

If you like black licorice then you might like this dish because that is exactly what crushed fennel seeds smell and taste like.  The sauce had very little immediate taste and too strong of an after taste.

This recipe was good.  I am not a big pork fan, and I did find the meat a little tough.  The flavor was delicious though.  We actually added 5 cloves of garlic (we love garlic), and used canned tomato's instead of tomato sauce.  I would certainly recommend that change if you are going to try this recipe.  We also omitted the water, as the canned tomato's contained enough.  Overall, a tasty dish, I think I will try it with Chicken next time... mmmmmmm

Yummo!  I made this recipe and took the suggestion of precious reviewers and altered it a tad.  I substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce, omitted the fennel seeds (didn't have any), and used powdered hot sauce instead of chili powder because that's what I had....my husband loved it!  It was easy to make and had great flavor.  I served it with egg noddles and steamed broccoli- very good. I will definitely make this again!

This was a yummy way to cook pork loin chops, turned out moist. Although I did use crushed tomatoes instead of sauce. I will pass this recipe to my children they will love it as it's easy to prepare.

I made this last night. It was delicious!  I went with the other reviews and used stewed tomatoes instead of sauce, eliminated the water and also threw in some garlic with the onions. Will definitely be making this one again!!

Good, solid, simple recipe. I only omitted the fennel due to not liking that flavor.  I found the recipe to be a little spicy, but not overly so.

Wonderful flavor.   I did not have red pepper flakes so I added a hit of cayenne.  Since the sause was just there, I added some zucchini and cooked with pork, adding the last 5 minutes.  YUM!

I used crushed Tomato instead of the sauce. This was real yummy.
I only partial cook the chops in the beginning, placed them in the oven to "keep warm" and finish cooking. Then simmered them for the 10 minutes. Did not use the crushed pepper. seasoned the chops with garlic powder.

I made the recipe as stated, except I didnt have fennel seeds, and even if I did I would not use them.. I had 3 already thin pork chops. I cut back on red pepper,and I had some noodles on the side with the sauce on top. I thought this dish was tasty. I enjoyed it and made it when hubby was not home,he is not a pork chop fan and I m pretty sure he would say nay to tomato sauce on them .

I just made it and it was perfect! I served it over chicken garlic couscous and it worked together wonderfully. Plus, the lunch was ready in 30 min, which is awesome. I omitted fennel seeds because I couldn't find any on the shelves and replaced tomato sauce with tomato paste mixed with water for the same reason. I also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder. The meat came out very soft and yummy. Next time I would only slightly cut on pepper flakes (came out a little too spicy for my taste) and find that fennel, because it really looks like it would add depth to the dish. Don't forget to add water occasionally to avoid burning.

When I was a kid, our family cooked all fish in a similar fashion. Filets were placed in a shallow pan, covered with stewed tomatoes, onion, and bacon slices and then broiled. It produced some liquid, and was very good. No strong flavors of seasoning like the recipe, but similar cooking ingredients.

Usually if there's a problem w/ "tough meat," there could be other issues involved.  
A poor quality of pork could be the problem. Or frozen meat, and/or also cooked in the frozen state and not allowed to thaw. Or overcooking the meat will do it as well. Try it again and see if maybe these were one of the problems.

This was a good dish the hardest part was making the pork chops flat.  Didn't flatten all the way but dish turned out great.  Made with Penne pasta.

This is a great recipe!  We loved it.  I especially loved how easy and quick it was to make.  As suggested by other posters I also seasoned my pork chops prior to browning.  Not big on fennel seeds so I chose to leave them out.  I went with diced tomatoes because that's what I had.  I suggest to do without red pepper flakes if you aren't used to heat.  I plan to cook this on a regular basis.

This was just so-so.  Won't ever make again.  Followed the cooking time exactly and the pork was way overcooked and dry.  Also, the flavor was not good.

I overcooked the chops slightly but it still tasted great! I did add one can of drained stewed tomatoes, as we like a chunkier sauce. Flavors melded together nice and I will definitely make this again.

This was very good. I basically followed the recipe as writtern but omitted the pepper flakes I didn't need that much heat and I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the sauce as others suggested.  I also used thin sliced bone in loin chops.  They were tender and juicy and sauce had a good flavor.  I think the secret to these chops is to not  over cook them when your browning them.

Excellent recipe. Was quick and very easy to make. Eliminated the fennel seed because I didn't have any, and substituted the tomato paste for a can of diced tomatoes. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe. Was still good without the fennel. Tenderizing the meat at the beginning is key to the pork being so tender and yummy! Entire family loved it. Will make again. Thanks!

This is a great simple and quick recipe especially for after work. The first time I made this, it was way too spicy for me but the second time I skipped the chilli flakes and it was far better.  No, this recipe isn't perfection but it's perfect for a tasty mid week meal.

My husband and I both thought this was absolutely delicious. I made it as written, except that I skimped on the chili powder (used about 1 1/2 tsp. instead of 2) and only a pinch of red pepper flakes. The heat was just right for us.   I had thought about putting in some garlic as some of the reviews mentioned, but forgot to add it with the onions--and honestly, I wonder if garlic might not be too overpowering. This sauce is all about the sweetness and flavor of the onions. Can't wait to make it again!

My only changes for this recipe was to only use 1/4 tsp. of the red pepper flakes and add a crushed garlic clove. The sauce thickened up a little too much so I added 1/4 cup of chicken broth near the end to make sure it had enough moisture to simmer. Taste was good!

This recipe was awesome although next time I will make the following tweaks:
  - Triple the amount of sugar
  - Use 1 tsp instead of 2 of Chili Powder
  - Cut out the red pepper

My husband and I are big fans of spicy food, but this was so hot, we could barely get it down!  We can't wait to try it without the overbearing spice, I bet it will be awesome!

I cut this recipe in half and cooked it according to recipe directions with the exception of the tomato sauce and water. I too, thought that a 1/2 can of diced tomatoes would be better. Me and my husband loved it. The fennel gave it a wonderful aroma and taste. I will be adding this to our repertoire of favorite recipes. Thank you Mlyin.

this was excellent.
I used pork tenderloin rather than loin chops, and I substituted fresh fennel (1 cup) for the seed. My family loved it!

We love this recipe. I made a couple of changes though, I did not use  fennel and used diced tomatoes instead of sauce. I also did not add the water.  I seasoned the pork chops before browning and I also added fresh chopped garlic while cooking the onions.

This was really very good, but too much Chili powder, next time I will put in half the amount.

I followed the original recipe. I didn’t have regular chili powder, I had Smokey chipotle powder and I thought it gave the dish a good flavor. I used thin loin chops, which I pounded out. Seared them and then dropped them in the sauce to finish. Personally I think pork chops have become disappointing; they are so lean it’s almost impossible to do the pan seared chops I remember from my childhood. When I make this again I’ll use tenderloin or shoulder chops. The recipe came out great, the sauce was very tasty.

Left fennel out, used more tomatoes, and pureed it - and it was a success.

I have cooked this recipe  a few times already. The only change I made is I added more liquid to continue softening the pork.I used chicken stock instead. I had to keep it simmering for another 30-40 minutes for the pork to be tender. I omitted the fennel only because i don't keep that in stock. But all in all it turned out pretty well.

Outstanding and yummy! Serve as tacos or with rice/beans. Very inexpensive and very easy to make. I made huevos rancheros the next morning with the left overs.

Made this exactly as stated except I halved the chili powder. Not my cup of tea. It does have heat when u eat but I found it too bland. Maybe more fennel as I love the smell. But overall. I thought it was bleh and prolly would not make again

Don't make this thinking it's gonna be like a pasta sauce. 

It's tasty, a bit spicier than i expected (my kids, 7 and 9, said it was too hot). I only used half of the cayenne and red pepper flake.

I didn't make it quite like the recipe, but definitely used the majority.
I do not like fennel, so that was left out!!  I also had some fresh tomatoes that I used instead of the sauce.  I cut up in slivers, added the spices and merinated a bit before cooking.

Spicy! But delicious! Served it with Basmati rice and yogurt side. Perfect coolant to the dish! Really tasty! I used the fennel as a rub with Maldon Salt and freshly ground pepper, Browns the pork on medium high and gently sautéed them. The onions I caramelized and added dry ingredients to them and heated them up and added water and Worcestershire sauce to the tomato sauce which I made this morning from fresh Roma tomatoes and a can of really nice Italian canned tomatoes. With thyme and garlic and onion. Lovely dish!

Needed a new pork chop recipe, so I decided to try this one.  I'm not a tomato sauce person, so I used diced tomatoes with basil garlic and oregano. Hubby wasn't too keen on the chili powder...I will use less next time. I added a can of mushrooms and put it over spaghetti.  The chops turned out great! Don't remember how long I cooked them...I just kept an eye on them as they cooked in the sauce.  I like this recipe because it's a good started for almost any type of sauce: you could make it more italian, mexican, spicy, non-spicy.  Go with your taste buds! Keeping this one handy!!

Very tasty but spicy. Even though I doubled the tomato sauce, no fennel/anise, 1.5 x chili powder, 2x worchestershire sauce, 2x oregano, a sprinkle of garlic salt, and added roasted red pepper we still found the sauce spicy.

I've made this several times and even served to friends when they were here at dinner time.  Very good.  I reduced the chili by half, but really if you love spicy the full amount would be good, too.  Nice and easy meal.  Lots of good flavor.  Pork chops tender.  Always appreciate a good pork recipe.  Thanks!

I needed something quick to cook for dinner. I had pork chops and rest of ingredients so this seemed easy enough. The only thing I extra I added was chopped tomatoes at the end to give it a little more texture. Overall it came out very well and tastes great. We served it over white rice to accompany the richness of the

I had some marinara sauce that I needed to use up -- used that instead of tomato sauce and all was well. Rave review from my guest.

This was so good that my son ate two and a half plates and for him that is serious. I used the left over sauce with some brown rice and peas for my lunch today. I did make some changes only because I did not have everything on hand. I used fresh ground annise instead of fennel, i used fried crunchy onions since I didn't have a real onion,  and it turned out fantastic. We are adding this to our monthly rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

I took no notice of the measures for chilli, pepper flakes, pepper and fennel.  I used what suited my taste.  I had been wanting to make this for some time,  and it was only when I had eaten it and was about to paste the recipe in my own cook book that I realised it was for pork.  I had made it with chicken.  I thought it was extremely tasty and will make it again.  I may try it with pork the next time.  I used diced tomatoes too. only because I didn't have sauce.  I'm sure it would be nicer with a good sauce.

I followed the others suggestions and used a can of diced tomatoes and omitted the fennel.  I also used thick cut bone in chops and cooked it all in a dutch oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes after browning.  We liked this recipe a lot.

I'm grateful I did not read the negative reviews before I tried this.  It turned out absolutely amazing... but then my wife and I doctored it up quite a bit.  Having recently read "The Coconut Oil Miracle", we're on a Coconut Oil kick.  We used a tiny bit of the oil to brown the pounded Pork Chops.  I added a bit of salt and just a sprinkle of shredded Parmesan Cheese and minced Garlic under the meat and browned it INTO the meat surface.   We then added about 3 tablespoons of Coconut Oil to sauté the large quantity of diced Onion as well.  We then proceeded pretty much as per recipe except for adding some Paprika to the spice mix.  It came out wonderful... and the spice mix on the onion is largely responsible.  You need to LIKE onions, and lots of them, to really appreciate this recipe.   I think it's an awesome flavour of the sauce...

This is a yummy easy recipe. I cheated a bit and used italian seasoning with the chili powder and the red pepper flakes. 
I halved the recipe but used a whole can of diced tomatoes.
Overall, very tasty with a side of rice and broccoli. 
Thanks!

I followed the directions exactly, even using the fennel which I am not fond of. You could barely taste it but it gave the sauce some depth. The sauce was really good but the pork was pretty bland. I served it over egg noodles.

Made it with diced tomato instead and was really tender.  It does not go well with microwaving the next day.  It was really tough.  I would recommend marinate it ahead of time to make the meat more flavorful.

I'm not big on these types of recipe's but I really did love it and so did my daughter.  I used all of the ingredients except for the chili powder with a tweak in the amounts here and there.  I did let it simmer for about 45 minutes which made the pork chops fall apart and they were still moist.  Tonight I am trying this recipe with chicken that had to be cooked.  Same ingredients as I used before but added a green pepper from the garden.

We enjoyed this recipe!  It definitely has some heat to it, but we love spicy food.  I didn't have any fennel so I omitted it, I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce (I loved the bits of tomato!) and I didn't cook it as long as it says.  My pork chops were pretty thin so I browned and cooked covered for 10 mins (like it says) but then only cooked uncovered for maybe 10 mins instead of 15.  Will make again!

I made this as the recipe called for with a few exceptions,  I used think bone in pork chops, added chopped red bell pepper to the onion and used a 28 oz, can of diced tomatoes in place of tomato sauce.  Served over hot rice and fresh green beans,  Next time will leave out the red pepper flacks, a little too hot.  Very good, will make again!

This was great. I used diced tomatoes rather than sauce and omitted the water. We used all of the sauce for two of us. I also added sliced mushrooms which I cooked with the onions. Had no fennel but used the other spices as listed-just right for us. This a recipe that would be good with pork, chicken or beef. Thanks.

This was really good, used a can of diced peeled tomatoes and a bit of tomato sauce, (instead of a can of tomato sauce and some water). Served with whole wheat thin spagetti and a green salad. Yum.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I too, left out the fennel and water, but added fresh mushrooms and used a can of Italian diced tomatoes in place of tomato sauce. I served this dish with Tuscan tomato cold pasta and fresh green beans. Followed it up with some homemade choc-oat-butter cookies! Thanks for this recipe. I will be using it agin!

First off...if I owned a restaurant, I would put this amazing Morocco inspired dish on the menu.  The pork chops may have been the most tender I have ever eaten in my life.  Some changes I made were, I used  one can of diced tomatoes instead of the suggested can of tomato sauce.  Otherwise I followed the directions precisely.  I set the finished pork chops over mashed parsnips/potatoes....a 50/50 mixture.   They paired so nicely with the chops.

Used boneless country ribs, Italian diced tomatoes and a green bell pepper
No tomato sauce, water, sugar or fennel. 
Seasoned the meat with Lawry’s before browning.
I let it simmer for 20 minutes covered
Fantastic results!! The boneless country ribs are the end cut of the loin and tenderloin and have very little fat. They are excellent for dishes like these.

Loved this recipe and thanks for all the tips from others that have tried it!  I made my own variation or made changes to this recipe though.  I'm not fond of too hot food so I only put a dash of red chili flakes and half teaspon of chili powder.  I also added green peppers for some colour and used tomato chunks instead of tomato sauce as suggested by others.  I added a few more teaspoon of sugar and used pork rib eye loin (has more fat mixed in it) which made it more tender!  Thanks for this!  My bf and I loved it and polished it off in minutes! :-)

Such a easy and amazing recipe, I didn't have fennel seeds on hand and it still tasted amazing. The seasonings were spot on except for the lack of garlic (which i added). Overall a great recipe and I have made it many times now!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used diced tomatoes as others suggested instead of tomato sauce and water and I used less red pepper since I didn't want it too spicy. It was ok. I made the mistake of following the cook times suggested so my meat was tough and I still used too many pepper flakes so it was too spicy for my taste. Don't think I'd attemt again.

Liked it a LOT.  I left out the fennel only because we didn't have any. I used diced tomatoes with habanero peppers instead of sauce and Italian seasoning in place of the dried oregano. My husband and I enjoyed it and we LOVE spicy but it was too spicy, even with the addition of egg noodles!  I'll drop the chili powder next time if I use the same type of diced tomatoes.  The pork wasn't tough, but next time, I'll thaw naturally and either grill or bake the loins.

I followed the directions of this recipe and ended up with a burnt dinner. The heat settings did not work well as written. The pork was fine, but the sauce was pretty scorched. I think it had possibilities, but I would do a little tweaking. I did not use fennel because we were out.

Nice sauce to go with the Pork Chops.  We wouldn't have minded a bit more of the sauce, so maybe that part could be doubled for about 6 pork chops.

Maybe one of the best things I've made in a long time.  Based on some of the reviews,  I free lanced on some things like seasoning (backed of the chili seasoning to make sure the kids would eat it and lightened up on the red pepper flakes.  Also added italian seasoning) and did a mixture of dices tomatoes and tomato sauce.  Also, I took a recommendation and seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and italian seasoning before I seared them.  All in all, a great recipe.

I too had to make changes...out of Worcestershire/substituted soy sauce; since I doubled the number of chops, I, instead of 2 cans of tomato sauce, used 1 can and 1 can diced tomatoes. Afraid it was too "watery" I added about 2 tablespoons tomato paste to thicken.   My 22 yr old daughter LOVED it! 16 yr old son liked it too!   
Was told this is a keeper! :)

I thought this was yummy; my daughter did, too. I left out the fennel cuz I didn't have any, and served over wild rice. Added broccoli to the leftovers for a super-tasty, easy dinner.

I made this recipe almost exactly as offered omitting the chili powder as I just didn't have it in the pantry. I did add a couple of light shakes of cayenne powder for a small hit of heat. The fennel seed imparts a sophisticated taste to the dish. I did use a can of seasoned (basil/garlic) tomatoes instead of the water. The dish was served over a bed of rice with peas on the side. This is an excellent dish that was easy to make and has a great presentation. I did add one cubed yellow squash for texture and color. Will definitely make this one again.

I thought this was recipe was okay, but not great.  I cut the chili powder down to 1/4 teaspoon and it still was spicy.  I did coat the pork with the spice mixture which seemed good, but I don't think I'll make this again.

This was a pretty good recipe. I added a can of whole green chilies to mine. But next time I will saute a large green pepper & add it to the meat right before serving. Thought it need a little boost.

The onions looked lonely, so I added half a bag of thawed frozen spinach leaves. It saved the recipe. No fennel though. Not a fan. Served over Fettuccine... good choice.

YUM! A hit with both grown-ups and kids. I didn't pound the chops thin, left them thick, and they turned out soooo moist and flavorful. I also used diced tomatoes and tomato paste (I was out of tomato paste) as well as adding some thinly sliced red pepper (on hand and needed to be used). DEFINITELY making this many more times! (Served over egg noodles, might do rice next time?)

My husband loved this recipe and said the chops were tender, which seems to always be a problem for me unless I put them in a slow cooker.  I haven't tried them myself but will try the leftovers.  I too left out the fennel and water and used a can of diced tomatoes and added garlic.

I was hoping for a little more uummpff.  To make this spicier i added some hot sauce.  I also added garlic.  My son I both ate it and it was okay, but probably not something that I will make again.

I really liked this recipe, my kids liked it too. I halved the chili powder as suggested in other reviews. I really liked the fennel seed flavor. It really added a nice touch. We served over brown rice and it was great. Thanks!

This was very tasty, I left out the fennel because I didn't have any but I think next time I would use the diced tomatoes and a little less chili powder for my daughter and then the sauce would be great over rice or noodles. I served it with rice and green beans. My chops were about an inch thick and came out very juicy. I almost forgot, I also coated the chops in flour and seasoning salt before I fried them, personal preferrence

This was good and very tasty.  I would leave out or reduce the fennel seed next time, since it can tend to be overpowering.  I overcooked the pork chops, but they still turned out pretty good after semi-braising in the cooking liquid.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and no water instead of the tomato sauce.  Served with Pasta Roni's parmesan angel hair and green beans.  Great, fast weeknight meal.

This recipe was good. My only issue was that the meat was a little dry but I figure that is probably human error rather than any problem with the recipe. I served it with brown rice, complemented well.

I thought it was great.  I didn't use fennel because I didn't have any, and used Italian style stewed tomatoes with oregano and basil.  I also would cut down on the red pepper because it was VERY SPICY!  I love it, it was overwhelming at times.  Great, easy dish!

The sauce was tasty but the pork was very bland.  I won't make this again.

I served this with whole wheat pasta and steamed brocolli and it turned out to be a healthy hit at my dinner table!
