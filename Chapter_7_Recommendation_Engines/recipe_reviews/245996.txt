Sorry - this wasn't a hit in my home. We prefer just cooking the cabbage and onions in butter, olive oil, and salt and pepper.

I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception that I accidentally added twice as much onion as it called for. I personally despise onion, so I was quite worried about how it would turn out – but it was delightful.

This is just a basic solid cabbage dish. It's better than boiled and not as greasy as fried. The vinegar, sugar and caraway seeds add good flavor and a bit of tanginess.

Great recipe! My husband and I loved this. It was simple, fast, and had tons of flavor. The only thing I changed was to carmelize the onions a tiny bit before adding the cabbage in order to add more depth of flavor. Definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe! It’s the first pan of cabbage I personally made that I enjoyed! LOL! The vinegar and sugar are everything. I used 1/2 a cup of water instead of a whole cup and I simmered for 10 minutes instead of 20-25 because I don’t like my cabbage to be very soggy. I also added carrots for both taste and color (I didn’t have caraway seeds on hand). In the future I’ll also add more onion. Love it!

This is now my go to cabbage recipe, I didn’t realize how well caraway seed went with cabbage until I tried this. I usually add garlic as well, and sometimes throw in sliced carrots for colour.

Easy to make, served it with pork and apples and used the leftovers in pastrami and Swiss sandwiches. So delicious.

Spectacularly good for you, traditional, easy to follow recipe, what more can one want?  I didn't have any caraway and substituted fennel.  Good too.

Nice easy dish that I remember my grandmother making. My daughter came in the house with a smile saying the "house smelt so good".  Good thing I had caraway seeds in the back of the spice cabinet.

This recipe is perfect! We loved the sweet and tangy flavors that married together on the stove while on low. It would be great with some beef! We had it along with salmon for a healthy meal. Everyone wanted seconds!
