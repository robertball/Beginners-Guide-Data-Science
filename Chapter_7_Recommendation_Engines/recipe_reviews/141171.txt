THIS MADE A LOT! But, anyway I thought this tasted pretty good or what I expected. They are a lot like the ones at the Chinese restaurants. Mine were just more crispy or crunchy, probably from the canola versus shortening they tend to use in the restaurants. The filling was delicious on these. The only changes I made was I used low-sodium soy sauces and left out the black pepper. I had thought to cook the filling before frying, but I am glad I didn't because it was fully cooked after the 4 minutes. I didn't realized how many wonton wrappers are actually in a pack! The package is now 12oz instead of 14oz like the recipe suggests. I got 50 appetizers and still have 1 1/2 cups left of filling left when I ran out! I guess I will use it for something else. Because the wrappers hold so much grease, I baked some of them at 375 for about 18 minutes. I lined a baking sheet with foil and sprayed it lightly with some olive oil, and then sprayed the wontons before baking. They tasted very good that way to.

I have made these three times now and everyone keeps asking for more.  For dipping, I poured terayaki sauce in small individual bowls.  TIP:  I froze two dozen UNCOOKED (place them in layers in a small box to avoid breaking off corners of triangles).   Thanks Grandma!

These were amazing! I did make a slight change though, instead of soy sauce I used Sesame Ginger dressing. I served these with "Sweet and Sour Sauce 1" and they were a perfect pair. Thanks!

These are great. My minor changes were to leave out the celery, and I used green onion. I also added 2 tsp of minced ginger and 4tbsp minced garlic. 
I also made a sauce using a 4 to 1 ration of kikkoman soy sauce to kikkoman teriyaki sauce, 1 tsp minced ginger & 2-3tsp minced garlic, which I heated almost to boiling on the stove (about 4 minutes on med-high heat). PERFECT dipping sauce! (you could add a pinch or two of sugar if you prefer the dipping sauce to be a little thicker--or you could use kikkoman teriyaki baste & glaze).
All in all, fabulous, and will DEFINITELY make again! Tastes VERY much like Mama Fu's! :D

These were pretty good but I have a couple of suggestions.  First of all, I used pork sausage (in a roll).  Secondly, I added some Chinese cabbage to the veggie mixture and sauteed them just a few minutes.  Lastly, I would recommend NOT using a deep fryer.  They seemed to IMMEDIATELY rise to the top.  Some were willing to "turn over" but some were not so I had to leave the cover open and hold them down.  Served with Teryaki veggies and dipped them in sweet and sour sauce (boyfriend used sweet chili sauce).  Overall, not bad but needs a bit more flavor - garlic perhaps?

Pretty good, it seems like it's missing something though, kind of bland.  This recipe worked well both fried and in soup.  I only used about 1/2 of the filling for one package of wonton wrappers so I'd cut the recipe in half next time.

These were fabulous!  DH and I made these together tonight.  I had to run and buy a second package of wrappers so none of the meat mixture would go to waste.  Next time we'll use one and a half times the recipe with two packages of wrappers.

I was looking for a way to make these a little more healthy so I baked them at 350 F for 18 minutes. I also substituted the pork with ground turkey and I used water instead of the egg wash.  I bought two packages of wonton wrappers and I still didn't use all the mix. I would make this again :)

These are so good!  Thank you to you and your grandma for sharing this recipe.  The filling reminded me of lumpia filling.  Highly recommend and will make these again.  Definitely need 2 packages of wonton wrappers.

I can't say YUM enough.... this was excellent although I found it tough to find the wanton wrappers but eventually found them at a chinese food specialty store.  This recipe made a ton of wantons and I ended up freezing a bunch to make another day.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'm sure I will be making again in the future.

Excellent appetizer! Quick and easy...very tasty! And,yes,it does have a high yield for the amount of mixture created. It will take at least 2 packages of wonton wrappers to use all of the filling and it is most definitely worth the effort! Save this one to your recipe box. Thank you, Lady_Charee!

These little crispy wontons are a perfect appetizer!  I add in some fresh minced ginger, and I use green onions.

I omitted the celery, added fresh shredded ginger, fresh lime juice and sesame oil to the pork mix... And served with a sauce made of soy sauce, lime and oranges juices and zest from both, more ginger, minced green onion and some agave nectar. Delicious!!!

Time consuming but very tasty, great for parties. I didnt find them bland, although I did add a couple extra cloves of garlic and a little more black pepper. I also added a tablespoon of rice vinegar. Makes about 45 to 50 wantons.

These were fantastic!  I did substitute per what I had on hand - I used salad shrimp and put it through the food processor with all of the ingredients.  I also cooked it in a pan with peanut oil and used only half the amount of oil and only about 2 minutes til' done.  We loved them - thanks for sharing!

So far, so good!  Made a ton of wontons - some for deepfrying, some for baking, some for soup.  They're all flash freezing right now, but I baked a couple to see what they tasted like and I was quite pleased.  Note to self:  brush outside of wrapper with eggwash before baking and try at 350 instead of 375 (mine began to burn).

These are so much better than I thought they were going to be!!  Really impressive.  We made these last night as part of a big Chinese food night, and they were a hit!!  So few ingredients, so packed with flavor.  We will be making these yummy wontons from now on.  Exactly what I was looking for, and never thought I'd make them at home so easily.  Thank you!

we loved these.. this was our first time deep frying "wontons".. we usually steam "potstickers".. took jennkl's advice of replacing the soy sauce with sesame ginger dressing.. reduced the servings to 3 and used green onion for regular onion and ground turkey for the pork.. ty so much for the recipe

Thought this would be better than take out wontons, sadly to say....it lacks flavor & or interest in this house :-(

Thanks for a jumping off point though! :)

Delish! My fryer cooked them a bit faster than what was recommended. I added 1 tsp Sherry Wine, 1 tbsp Soy sauce, and 1/4 tsp Sesame oil.

Made in air fryer instead of oil fry. It was the first thing to go at the party.

Great base for wontons cant wait to experiment with additional spices or assorted ingredients. This version I made pork wonton tacos. I filled an 8 inch skillet with a half inch of canola oil cooked the wontons for about 10 seconds one side, flipped and folded in half with tongs til browned and dried on paper towel. The pork was cubed and marinaded in AR's Teriyaki marinade for Rib Eye steaks then baked for 20 minutes on 325 flipped then baked again another 20 minutes then broiled for 4 minutes each side (baste with juice as needed). Added enoki mushrooms, julienned carrots, red onions and jalapenos and threw some diced cilantro on top. Awesome street size wonton tacos.

These were DELICIOUS and they did make quite a lot, so I froze some. I did make a few changes. I substituted chicken for the pork, added more soy sauce, used minced ginger and garlic powder. I think next time I'll add some cabbage and maybe curry powder. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty and pretty! Didn't change much of anything. It did make a bunch so I froze half on a cookie sheet and then in a ziploc. Cooked a few of the frozen ones and worked great! Gonna use the rest for wonton soup.

I substituted pork with chicken for this recipe, and I halved all ingredients (I'll remember next time to cut back on the pepper a bit more) - still great!
