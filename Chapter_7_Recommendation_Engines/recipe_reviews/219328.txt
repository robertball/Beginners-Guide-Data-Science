Wonderful in a deliciously understated kind of way.

I made some minor changes:
I added one standard block of tofu - I don't know what a "cup" of tofu looks like, and I wasn't about to start storing unused tofu, so I just used the whole 14oz block. Maybe that is a cup; I don't know.

I doubled all the spices, and used some hot sauce instead of a chili.

The essential recipe was the same, and it was delicious.

We love butternut squash soup, but this is one of the best I've tasted.  I used 1/2 block of 14oz tofu.  To reduce fat, I cooked the onion in about 1/2 cup of veggie broth instead of butter. That's all I did differently. Love getting the extra protein from the tofu, though my meat-eating brother was a bit dubious when he found out about the tofu.

Delicious! The tofu is hidden! I used soft tofu and omitted the chilli. Mmm I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe :)

For someone that doesn't usually like this type of dish, this was pretty good! The seasoning was just right to compliment the squash and sweet potato flavors and gave it that nice, Fall-ish feel. It won't be a regular at our house, but cold Fall days and Thanksgiving are definitely possibilities.

My husband absolutely hated it.  His response, "I feel like a little kid who has to force food down before dessert."  I found it palatable but that is about it.

I added some lowfat cream cheese & nutmeg. I didn't have any ginger, so I used garlic. Topped it with French Fried Onions. Best butternut squash soup ever. Yummm.

Pretty good, although I think milk or cream would be better than tofu.  A little sweetish for my taste, maybe try with normal potatoes.  Good for children too.

I was looking for a nice Butternut Squash soup recipe when I came across this one with sweet potatoes.  As with every cook, I made minor changes.  Instead of tumeric\coriander\black pepper, I used curry powder, which has all of these ingredients.  Instead of butter, I used Smart Balance spread.  I ended up using 8 cups of vegetable broth made with vegetable bullion.  At the time, I searched in vein for fresh thyme, but ended up using 1 1/2 teaspoons of powdered thyme.  I ended up using a "stick" blender, which saved on clean-up up!  Now to the result: a roomate, who works as a cook was surprised how tasty it was!  I just had a few bowlfuls of it: it's VERY tasty!  Goes great with some crusty bread like French or Italian.  VERY, VERY, VERY Addicting!!    5 stars, it needs to have more!

Made this today; it was unseasonably cold and I wanted something comforting and warm. This was beautiful! I didn't have tofu, so I used part skim milk, part half-and-half. I also melted a little Brie (no rind) into the soup, since I had some small cubes left over from a party. Complements the soup perfectly! This one's a keeper!!

This recipe was very disappointing. Followed the recipe to the tee, except omitted the optional green chile. I did taste it while the veggies were simmering, and it tasted very promising, I actually liked it before adding the tofu/pureeing it. The final product tasted like baby food, and not in a good way. My 2 year old didn't even like it. That was very surprising to me since he loves sweet potatoes, squash, and tofu. I was able to eat it with some grated parmesan cheese, but the hubby couldnt even stomach half of it. If I could change anything about it, I would not puree it.

The only change I made was that I used the whole package of tofu and a second green chile because we like spicy foods and my family thought it was fantastic!!! Great soup for a cold winter day. I will make this again!
