At last, a wonderful recipe for Scallops.
I've tried them many times, but this isthe best.  Fork Tender and very tasty.
I did add a bit of Nutmeg.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  It was great!

This is fab-U-lous!  I do not, however, use skewers. I just toss all of the ingredients into an aluminum pie pan (I wash and save these after the pie is gone for this sort of thing) and grill em up.  They turn out beautifully. Highly recommend!
