You have to be careful monkeying around with measurements when you bake - you don't want to goof up the chemistry of the ingredients and risk a failure.  You have much more leeway with cooking, but you still have to be careful.  When in doubt about an ingredient, always start with a lesser amount - you can always add more if you like, but it would be difficult if not impossible to correct if there was too much of something.   In this case, it was the parsley and lemon juice I started out stingy on and I am SO glad I did.  I only used half the amount called for and I was completely happy leaving it at that.  I don't think I would have been pleased at all with twice as much as I used!  I didn't add the eggs because I was serving this with egg salad and I think I prefer this without the eggs anyway.  The parsley was not enough herb to carry the "herbed" in the title, but a good amount of dill fixed that right up.   We ultimately enjoyed this, but it took a fair amount of tweaking to get there.

I didn't like this as much as I thought I would.  To me, the lemon juice was overpowering and made the salad too sour. Disappointed.

I made it and it was great, added imitation crab, left out the celery because of allergies and I forgot the boiled eggs... But still turned out awesome.

It was ok, but 1 C. of pasta is not enough to make 12 servings.  There was too much lemon juice, & the eggs just didn't seem to go with shrimp.  I made it again yesterday, and used more pasta (shells were more appropriate w/shrimp).  I used a combination of mayo & sour cream, less lemon juice, no eggs, and added some fresh dill.  We liked it better this way, just sayin'.

I made this for a "salad" themed lunch for work. I doubled the ingredients, however I used an entire 1 pound box of mini bowtie pasta rather than the original pasta it called for.  I snuck a taste after refrigerating for eight hours, but prior to adding the shrimp. I felt the onion was overwhelming at that time. I almost didn't put it out for the lunch at work. However, after adding the shrimp and refrigerating for an additional 4 to 5 hours, it ended up being very popular. In the end, I used a lot more mayonnaise than the recipe called for. I wish I could say how much, but I kept adding until the consistency and moisture seemed right.  The additional mayonnaise and pasta may have help dilute the "overwhelming" lemon flavor others complain about.
