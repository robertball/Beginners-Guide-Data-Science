After reading the reviews, I decided to add more spices. To this wonderful recipe I added 1/2 Tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves, and more cinnamon. Not only do they taste great, but your kitchen will have the smell of Autumn! Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I couldn't find pasty shells so I used Keebler individual graham cracker crusts (2 in.size, package of 6: about 12 of these used for this recipe) I also added more ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg and didn't use any brown sugar. I used Libby's canned ready to make pie filling, evaporated milk & egg with the spices, and it was sweet enough. The great thing is I made this for a Halloween party, and was able to make 1 or 2 first to test before making the rest of the batch. Had left over filling and I'm going to get some more little crusts for me!

This was a very easy, good recipe! What I did differently, however, was rather than using 24 tart shells, I first made 8 mini pie shells (one double crust recipe made this amount perfectly, I divided the dough into 8ths and used a tortilla press to flatten the dough between plastic wrap.) There really wasn't quite enough filling for these 8, but it was delicious! (I'll not make the sides as high next time.) I also used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice for the spices listed.

These were great and easy to make.  I used a different recipe that I already had for the crust, and it worked just the same.  Great for parties or just to have around the house for snacks!

I only had 1 cup of pureed pumpkin that I got from a sugar pumpkin so I cut the sweetened condensed milk amount down to 11 ounces. I also used 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices. This was an easy recipe to make but I could really taste and see the milk. It looked too light and wasn't very spicy.

These were awesome! I did make a few minor changes after reading others reviews! I doubled all the spices (almost tripled the cinnamon) and added ginger. I also only used a 10oz can of condensed milk and they came out fantastic!

I used this to make a mini tart.  I doubled this recipe and then used 3 boxes of the ready made two crusts in a box.  I used a small glass to cut the round shape to place in the mini muffin tins.  I baked it for 15 min in mini muffin tins.  It makes about 100 tarts.

I made these a while ago for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit with everyone! Very easy to make and so yummy! I used keebler's mini graham cracker crusts and pumpkin pie spice instead. Will definitely make again.

I would definitely make these again!  I used1 1/2 cups of regular canned pumpkin...could not find the puree; used pumpkin spice (2 tablespoons) instead of the individual spices and did everything else exactly the same.  They were delicious!!

Tweaked this recipe after reading reviews saying it lacked spice or was too milky.
I used:  3/4tsp cinnamon, 1/2tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Used a 300ml (10oz) can of Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed milk.  1 1/2 cups canned pumpkin puree.  Kept egg & brown sugar the same and thawed some frozen unbaked 3" tart shells.  I also baked them 5 mins longer (23 mins altogether)  I gave 5 stars hoping people will check the reviews for the tweaks other reviewers made!  Mmmm perfection!

I altered the recipe slightly, I used 1 3/4 cup of pumpkin, omitted the brown sugar and used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. 
I got 23 tarts from this, really good for a potluck, easy way to serve pumpkin pie to many people!

This recipe is awesome!  Not only is it easy to make, but very tasty with the additions I've made.  I changed the spice to 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, ginger, a scant 1/4 tsp. of cloves and 3/4 tsp of cinnamon.  This spice combo was perfect!  Lovely tart recipe, definetely a keeper!

Very good, creamier and a little sweeter than "regular" pumpkin pie filling. Topped w/ whipped cream and candied pecans (from this website).

I'm not a big pumpkin fan, but even I thought these were good.  And easy, too!  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices and put in about 1 or 1-1/2 teaspoons.

Bland and found the baking time off as the bottom of the crusts were gummy. Not worth the effort to try and tweak for improvement. Thanks anyway.

The filling for these little tarts was amazing!  I thought the condensed milk would be too sweet, but it turned out delicious.  Makes me want to rethink my pumpkin pie recipe....
