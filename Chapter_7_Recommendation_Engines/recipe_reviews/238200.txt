Seriously amazing, just like the recipe submitter said! I made it exactly as written, except for one minor change: I had to add more oil to the parsley/walnut mix because it was a thick paste at first. No biggie. When I was done cooking the quinoa I thought, there's no way this is going to be enough! Fret not, bc this definitely makes enough for 4 good sized servings. I love how healthy this is and can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Next time I will add a bit of garlic as suggested. Thanks t_jones!

After blending the parsley-walnut pesto I thought it was terribly bitter.  I worried that I'd have to add honey to make this salad palatable but after mixing it all together it was absolutely delicious.  I think I had more like 3 cups of broccoli but the pesto was still enough to coat all the ingredients.  The only other mods I made were I used much more olive oil, maybe 1/4 cup, so that the dressing was easier to mix around and I used feta instead of blue cheese because I prefer it.  The cucumbers add some crunch and the tomatoes a little sweetness so don't omit them.  So tasty!

This was pretty good.  Not a fan of blue cheese so I used feta.  Also not a fan of walnuts so I think I'll use almonds next time.  Chopped up some chicken and avocado and added to the mix.

The only substitute I did the first time i made it was finely chopped onions instead of Lee's and feta instead of blue cheese. I also added fresh peas from my garden. My husband ate himself sick he loved it so much. Last night I made it substituting  harvest grains for quinoa. Excellent both times.

I made several changes based on what I had in my pantry, and it was really good!  I used brown rice instead of quinoa, and my vegetables were broccoli, red pepper, and cucumber (I did not use cheese).  I was having trouble blending the pesto, so instead of adding even more oil (I had added about 1/4 of a cup at this point), I added balsamic vinegar along with some salt and pepper and a few more walnuts (I used about 1/3 of a cup).  It turned out great!  I kept the pesto separate so the vegetables would not get soggy.  A perfect meal to take along for lunch during the week.

The taste of parsley was overwhelming.  May try again with basil pesto.

The only thing I left out was the blue cheese, otherwise I followed the recipe. The pesto was both boring and gross. I would rather have eaten the quinoa, broccoli, and tomatoes plain.

I loved this salad and used as the main dish on a bed of arugula and some balsamic vinaigrette on the side.  I used what I had on hand - only cucumber & red peppers for the veggies.  I also added 1 crushed garlic clove.  Next time I make it, I will also add avocado!  I also added a few Tablespoons of water to the sauce and used parmesan cheese instead of bleu cheese.
