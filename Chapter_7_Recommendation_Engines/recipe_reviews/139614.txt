Excellent. I didn't make the saffron mayonnaise, but the eggplant was fried perfectly!

I had 1 small eggplant and 6 of the long skinny ones and tried out this recipe.  I just filled the bottom of the pan with about 1/4" of oil for the frying.  Turned out good.  Husband doesn't normally like eggplant, but he liked the recipe, but you know everything is better fired, right?  ;)

I love pan fried eggplants to begin with. But this sauce is just heaven like. The key is suffron. It made a HUGE difference. I absolutely will make this again and share it with my family and friends.

This was a delicious and impressive appetizer. That being said, I will probably grill or bake the eggplant without breading next time to cut down on the fat. This disappeared quickly and everyone was looking for more. Thanks for sharing.

I made these last night as a side dish and my hubby and I really liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly but did find, however, that both the eggplant and the mayo needed more seasoning/zing (this could just be my personal preference), so next time I will adjust my seasonings to suit my tastes.  I will also experiment with baking/broiling instead of frying, and/or using plain yogurt, to cut down on the fat content.  Will definitely be making these again!

This recipe is hands down amazing!  I was nervous about frying the eggplant but it came out beautifully and delicious!  The saffron mayo makes this dish.  I will continue to make this appetizer again and again!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, but decided for time's sake not to roll up the eggplant strips after frying.  I just served them as wedges with the saffron mayo.  When slicing my eggplant, I first skinned two sides with my knife, so the slices I cut first from each of those ends would not be all skin on one side.  One other tip: once oil is hot, fry at medium temperature.  The eggplant in the olive oil seems to burn easily.  5 stars b/c my husband loved these and said the texture and breading were spot on (I however, don't care for eggplant in any capacity!)

This is an excellent recipe! Don't skip the saffron mayonnaise! It adds just the right touch to the eggplant.  I think this dish is best eaten immediately - piping hot!

Super easy! The cayenne pepper gave the eggplant a tasty zing! The saffron mayonnaise was a hit. It was fun because this was the first I used saffron in a recipe. My family went nuts trying to guess the secret ingredient for the dip.

Made this dish last night--it is amazing!  I served eggplant as strips and the saffron mayonnaise is spectacular. Included some diced red pepper for color and extra zing. Serve piping hot and they will surely be quickly devoured.  Many Thanks for sharing!

Eggplant fried is delicious. I've never had saffron but a pinch of tumeric works great in this recipe. I added 4 cloves of garlic to try to consume less mayonnaise.

I followed the recipe almost exact. I used a lot of cayenne pepper & garlic powder. I'm glad I tried this!

I made this for an afternoon snack and both of my boys ate them up
!  I followed it exactly.  Next time I am going to cut my eggplant "french fry" style.  That zippy saffron mayo was a huge hit and has been requested for ham sandwiches.  Thank you for the share.

Loved it.  The first time I didn't bother to roll it.  The second time I made it I did.  Just a matter of presentation.  I enjoyed the sauce.  Used all my saffron.  Thought next time I would add a little turmeric and see how that was.  Definitely room for some flexibility.  I've never cooked with eggplant much and really enjoy this.  The leftovers make great snacks.

I expected so much more from this after all the reviews and was hoping to use this to wow friends at a tapas dinner, but after trying this at home I was a little underwhelmed.  I even had saffron that I had brought back from a trip to Spain, that I used.  It didn't present very pretty on the plate and the saffron mayo that everyone raved about didn't do a thing for me.  Maybe my pinch wasn't big enough, even though the mayo turned yellow.  The spices in the eggplant were really good, but overall it didn't meet my expectations.

I used Asian eggplant. Good, but wasn't totally sold on the saffron mayo.

I would use less cayenne next time.
