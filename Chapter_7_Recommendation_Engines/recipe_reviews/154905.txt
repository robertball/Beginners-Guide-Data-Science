After a little tweaking this was a delicious chili that will probably even replace my dads chili that I've loved and made for years!  Instead of the water I used a 46oz can of tomato juice.  (we like our chili more soupy rather than stewy and I think it added the flavor that it needed)   I also garnished each bowl with a dollop of sour cream.  My family loved it.  Especially my husband who loved the flavor.  Will definitely be making this a lot this winter.

Four stars for a good starting point.  Used ground pork instead of Italian Sausage due to allergies from fennel/anise seeds. Omitted the sugar and added some balsamic vinegar for acidity.  It was good, however i did miss the green chilies that I normally put in chili.  I also missed the garlic, so I added a few tbsp of minced garlic plus garlic powder.  The cinnamon was a surprising addition that we all liked.  Thanks!

I entered this chili in a chili cookoff yesterday.  Out of 10 entries - this chili recipe (I followed it to the "T") came in 10th place.
I will not use this recipe again. Don't want to waste the $40 it took to make it.

This was an unbelievable chili.  I had never actually attempted chili before but this one was rather easy.  I had to vary the recipe a small bit because I had not cinnamon...I used nutmeg instead.  Also I had to leave out the sausage because the store I stopped at was out, so it was a two meat chili.  But it turned out really good and everyone loved it.  I can't wait to try it again to see what it tastes like with the sausage in it.

I thought this lacked taste.  All I could taste was the beer flavor.  I won't make it again.

This was fantastic!  I used hot italian sausage and cubed london broil with no ground beef.  I added a chipotle pepper and much less chili powder.  I also chopped a green bell pepper.  Served with cornbread, sour cream and cheese.

The most unique and delicious chili recipe I have ever had.  Really don't understand the review with a 1 star seems unfair, this is not hot.  The ingredients are perfect together!  Great recipe! Try it you will like it!

This was by far the best chili I've had in awhile. It has a great flavor, unlike what one reviewer has posted. I'm a college student and am constantly asked to make this delicious dish for game day.

This was a bit different from my typical Chili.  We liked the different meats.   Everyone enjoyed it.   Cooked as listed.   Maybe a pinch more chili powder and green peppers next time.  Served the second night over a baked potato.   Yummmm.

I personally liked this recipe.  It was very good, different from others but that after all is why I selected it.  But, my husband did not care for it at all.  I was shocked, he loves spicy but said this was just too hot.  I could only give it three stars for our difference of oppinion.

I liked the three meats but it was way to sweet.  It might have been the beer I used since i used a lighter one, but next time i think i will omit the sugar.

I tried this with turkey sausage b/c my kids don't eat pork.  I also cooked it in the crock pot.  It wasn't bad but the cinnamon was OVERWHELMING, although it kind of showed up at the beginning of the bite & then receded into the background.  My wife liked it, but I was experimenting with chili that weekend & once she tried the other, she didn't want this one anymore.  Personally, as I don't really care for cinnamon, I'm unlikely to make this again.

I was a little worried when I taste-tested this chili about halfway through cooking, because the cinnamon scent was so strong and the whole dish was so sweet. Not wanting to waste ingredients, I added another small can of tomato paste and hoped for the best. By suppertime, the cinnamon was still very apparent, but the sweetness had mellowed and a dab of sour cream and a sprinkle of cheese balanced everything out nicely. The only other changes I made, in addition to the extra tomato paste, was to add a can of black beans along with the kidney beans, and to omit the red pepper, because we're not big fans of spice. All in all, I was very happy with this recipe and I *will* make it again!

This is my favorite chili recipe. Everyone loves it... We like it thicker so I add more tomato paste and beans! I also dont use the white sugar, and instead use a diet sugar subsitute! It is good as it is though.

I didn't have quite enough chili powder but I did have a can of Chipotle peppers which I chopped up and threw in there. I think the smoky taste really went well with the cinnamon and I will make it exactly the same again. Oh, and I also cooked it in the crock pot!
