Everyone raved so much over this recipe that I made these apples two days in a row!  The recipe is very easy and difficult to mess up, I'm sure.  Make sure not to let the caramels harden on the apples, as they're much better as part of the cream.  I also added some cinnamon, extra brown sugar and mulling spices on top of the caramels to cover the apples, which only made the taste better.  This is great for a large group -- just make plenty!!!

This recipe is awesome!  Simple yet so delicious. The flavors combine but the ingredients are so simple. You can make it just fun for the family or really make it look special.  I modified it slightly after I made it a few times.  I add  more carmel into the saucepan and let them melt before adding the cream.  I also add a touch of cinnamon. It rounds out the flavor.  This last time I didn't have any whipping cream so I used evaporated milk.  Still excellent.  Top with some redi whip and sprinkle of cinnamon.  Wow.  Karen was thinking when she made this.  Easy and Delicious.  Thanks.

Great and easy recipe.  Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and sprinkled a little cinnamon and nutmeg on top.  Family loved them and the caramel cream was to die for.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I just gala apples it was all I had on hand, and I ended up using an extra caramel or two inside of the apples. The sauce was smooth and really yummy.  Great recipe!

These were delicious, but I only could get Half and half at the local grocer so I had to improvise to thicken the carmel sauce.  It was still delicious looking foreward to making it with real cream next time.

GREAT comfort food dessert. The longest part of preparing was paring the apples and unwrapping the caramels. Absolutely delicious!
