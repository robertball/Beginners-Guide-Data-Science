if you are a whiskey person tihs drink is perfect. i love amaretto as well so this drink to me is excellent. its not overly sweet so even guys will drink this. you can tweek it to your own liking, adding more amaretto and cranberry if you like sweeter drinks.

This is a great drink! I's good as a shot or on the rocks. Tweak it to your liking. My husband loves this and he does not like whiskey!
