Just logged onto this website for the first time today and already I am happy I found allrecipes.com!! I wanted to make a lemony-spinach type pie and came across this recipe.  It was just what I was looking for.  Great taste and simple to make.  Worked out perfectly as a appetizer for my family get-together.  Thanks!

These were good. I made a half recipe, and my husband and I polished them off in a matter of minutes. With a bit of goat cheese in the filling, I think this would be GREAT. I plan on trying that (and I'll report back when I do). Post-goat-cheese Report . . . I crumbled a couple ounces of goat cheese into the filling this time, and it was very good. It added a sort of tangy creaminess. I like it better with the cheese than I did without, but given the price of goat cheese, I probably will go without it next time.

This is essentially a great recipe - but I'd like to offer some optional tips and a shortcut I use: to one thawed 10 oz. pkg. chopped spinach with the liquid *firmly* squeezed out, I added a 16 oz. container of low or non-fat cottage cheese, 1/3 c. parmesan cheese, 1 slightly rounded tsp. chicken bouillon powder or granules and everything else for the filling posted in this recipe (I think I used slightly rounded Tbsps. for the sumac). Once mixed, I let it sit overnight in the fridge to blend flavors. Next day, INSTEAD OF PHYLLO, I used LARGE refrigerator biscuits, rolled them out on a Bisquick-powdered countertop and filled as directed,making half-moons and crimping edges with a fork. Placed 'em on a greased pizza pan, misted 'em lightly with cooking spray & baked 'em in a pre-heated 425* oven for 10 or so minutes. The filling keeps well; you can make a batch at a time for several days or freeze some of the filling for later use. =)

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I added some ricotta as I love the combination of cheese and spinach, but did every other step to the letter.  My only input would be that there is not enough filling for that much phyllo dough.  I'm going to increase all other ingredients by half next time so they are stuffed more (so six cups of spinach, etc.).

It's tasty if you use bread dough.  As for spinach add to the ingredients red pepper it gives a nice flavor
