Marinating in buttermilk for 24 hours is the tender, flavorable secret.  I drained then shook a couple pieces at a time in 1 cup Bisquick, added 1/2 Tbsp Paprika, 2 t salt and 1/2 t pepper.  Instead of frying, try oven at 425*.  In 13x9 baking dish spray with PAM heavy, put chunks of unsalted butter and put empty dish into oven until melted.  Remove and put in pieces, bake 25 min - turn and bake 25 min more.  Delicious!

I had difficulty getting some ingredients here in UK especially dry Italian seasoning but made up something with a few herbs and spices.

I liked the result. Marinading in butter milk is a really good idea. (For UK readers, butter milk can be found at Tesco).

I cooked the chicken in an oven, 200C, since I don't use deep frying. I sprayed the dish with olive oil, put the chicken in then sprayed it as well.

Next time I'll adapt the coating by using bread crumbs and perhaps substitute the Italian seasoning with some lemon zest, or another strong flavoured fruit, some crushed bay leaves, and some basil, ground pepper, perhaps some lemon grass.

My wife suggests putting the chicken seasoning into the marinade instead of the salt.

Anyone who would say that this recipe was like throwing money out the window needs to serve at a food kitchen for just one day. Absolutely nothing wrong with this recipe or the seasonings. My only problem was getting the chicken pieces to cook throughly. I did use dark meat, which takes longer anyway, but twenty minutes just didn't seem to do it even tho I used a candy thermometer. I had to place the meat in the oven for about fifteen minutes. Nontheless, it was tasty, crispy and enjoyed by my gang. Thanks Lora!

Sadly enough, I feel as though money was thrown out the window with this recipe. I have to say that I don't think anyone who has left a 4-5 star review, actually know what really great fried chicken is. I really hate to even give it one star. This was not "awesome"

The basic idea of this recipe is good, but it really needs more spice.  I found it to be rather bland.  Adding more spices really gave it more flavor.  Using the buttermilk was a great idea because it really helped the flour mixture to stay on the chicken.

WOW! My husband (a true southerner) said, this was the best fried chicken he's ever had. I was surprised at how little work it took. (Well except for the usual mess).

I just realized now that I forgot to add the poultry seasoning...for that, I will give this 4 stars only.  The family liked it; the chicken was very crispy.  I didn't measure out the salt in the marinade, and perhaps I should have, it could have used a slight bit more.  Aside from keeping the oil hot enough to cook, this was a very good dish, although a very time consuming one at that.  I will make this again (and hopefully remember all of the ingredients!) but not too often, as it really does make quite an oily mess too.
Thanks for the post!!

Simple and just the right flavor.  If I add too many spices my kids won't like it.  I cooked thighs, so I added more time to fry them.

I found this recipe to be excellent as is. Perhaps the person who gave it one star could post her recipe for "really good" fried chicken so we could review it?

I thought the buttermilk added a great flavor, but I don't believe this was the best fried chicken I've made.

I have been doing a version of this recipe for years! I love it, I do everything the same except I use chicken theighs and throw it in an oven at 400 and let it fry itself, sometimes there is flour on the too of the chicken but I just baste it once or twice. Very YUMMY!

This was a good hook up! However the meat itself was  bland. I will make it again for sure but this time I will season the meat a little before placing it in the fridge over night. I did not have bags so bowls for the butter milk and flour mixture worked out just fine. I used a basket for deep frying and that was a mistake, the chicken stuck to it....lol. All in all I did enjoy, i just wish the chicken had absorbed more flavor.  This was great with Mac-N-Cheese and my daughter ate it all up! I will keep this one fore sure. Good job with this one however I can only give 4 stars due to the lack of meat flavor.

The Trick for making good Southern Fried Chicken is the seasonings as well as if you can shaking in a paper bag put all your seasonings in a paper bag with self rising flour and 1 pack of sazon .. clean your chicken pat dry mix in all your seasonings that you n your family enjoys you can use some mustard as well not spicy mustard regular frenchs mustard let marinate for 15 minutes in the fridge dont use buttermilk if you want you can go ahead but dont use the mustard after the 15 minutes shake off shake in paper bag only if you have make sure you shake off some flour you dont want thick flour patches on your chicken and deep fry  drain on paper towels and enjoy your chicken Family will just want some more

After reading the other reviews I am puzzled about what people saw in this recipe...  A light crispy coating and flavor would have been nice...  :(
