I just made this last night and it was absolutely fantastic!  I didn't have green onions so I used minced red onion.  My in-laws were so impressed they wanted to have a plank to take home!  Costco has them for $8 for a package of 6.  The package on the plank states that if it's not too charred you can use is again after cleaning with warm water and letting it air dry.  Also, to save time, planks can be presoaked and frozen.  I can't encourage you enough to try this incredible recipe!
Thank you for the post.

My boyfriend said this was the best piece of fish he's ever had!  I soaked the cedar for about 7 hours then oiled one side.  I used a 2.5 lb piece of salmon skin side down.  I heated the plank and then put the fish on for 20 minutes, then turned off the heat and kept it on the grill for about 5 more minutes before serving.

Outstanding recipe!  I ended up doing in the oven at 350 due to heavy rain.  It was still delicious. I highly recommend making this. Thanks for sharing.

There is nothing better in Seattle than cedar planked salmon - unless it is Copper River Cedar planked Salmon. I usually just use olive oil, salt,pepper and dill and people who've never experienced planked fish can't get over the "fabulous" seasoning. Do soak the planks as long as you can 4 to 24 hours - mine always catch on fire. Makes for a spectacular presentation though...

The 1/3 cup of soy sauce, I reducted down 1 1/2 table spoons. That made it less salty and kept the great taste.

Delicious!!! Made it for Christmas dinner with three picky eaters...made fish-eaters of them all. I soaked the cedar plank for over 24 hrs...and I used my GE roaster oven. There was no smoke issues and the salmon was utterly perfect!

This was so delicious. I had bought my husband some cedar planks for Christmas and he never used them (and probably never would have) so I decided to try the recipe. Wow. First, I started with the Wal-Mart frozen salmon my husband buys (which I usually dislike, but this recipe made it taste awesome!) Second, my 4 yr old son and my 13 yr old daughter usually won't touch fish -- but they both gobbled this up! For that reason alone, this gets 5 stars. But it was so smoky and layered with different flavors, thanks to the marinade. I have 6 kids and all but one raved (the other one, at 17, only eats pasta and butter so she doesn't count.) My husband loved it, too. I'm from Michigan but live in Louisiana, yet when I was done cooking this, I felt like I was in a ski lodge up north somewhere, that's how it smelled! Wonderful, thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I had 3 large pieces of salmon, so I doubled the sauce and ended marinating over 1.5 hrs.  It was so amazing, moist, flavorful, and makes a lovely presentation.  I followed the recipe exactly and will make again and again and again (please know I am not a huge salmon fan, prefer catching over eating - but this recipe made all the difference.)  Highly recommend! My planks did catch fire, so I have to work on a better solution for that issue.

I tried this on Red Oak planks and with both Salmon (with skin) and Halibut. Salmon had the most flavor while Halibut had a very delicate texture. Kids liked Salmon better, husband preferred Halibut. Neither Salmon nor Halibut soaked too much of the sauce - the sauce remained more on the outside. The plank didn't omit too much smoky flavor - didn't actually smoke at all on our Webber gas grill

First off, this was my first time eating or making a salmon dish, so we'll discount my opinion - I just don't like salmon. Period. This seemed like a lot of work for the end result.  My husband - who does like salmon - was not impressed.  Sorry.  We just didn't get it.

Great salmon - I use my Traeger grill because of how easy it is to control temperature - One of my favorite salmon recipes - also love to wrap salmon in swiss chard or kale inside foil & slow cook on grill

Phenomenal!  Made this according to recipe and it was great! I boiled the left-over marninade (to ensure it wasn't bad from the raw fish) and added just a few T of half and half to try to thicken a bit - it didn't really thicken but it still was great over rice and spoooned over the salmon.  Exceptional recipe - we eat at great restaurants and we were trying to decide when we last had a meal so great.   This is phenomenal!

4.5 We aren't huge salmon fans, but are trying to eat more fish.  This was a fun technique and it had excellent flavor that wasn't too fishy.  I soaked the planks overnight in a 5 gallon bucket and defrosted the fish in the marinade overnight.  My filets were thinner than pictured and probably could have spent less time of the grill.  I will get thicker filets or leave them less time. We think some type of sauce/glaze would be really good.  (2nd try and I changed my rating to 5.  I used a thicker filet.  It was incredible, although a light glaze will enhance it next time.)

This is the best way to have salmon, hands down. I served two salmon done this way at a bar-b-q we had, and there was not one spec left ... SOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! even my dog loved it apparently, as we found the wood planks licked clean the next day, lol

This was some of the most delicious salmon we've ever eaten, and we've eaten our fair share of salmon!  I prepared the recipe pretty much as written, except that for the green onion, I didn't chop it, I just took a few stalks, cut it into 4" lengths, bruised it with the back of my knife really well, and then tossed it in the marinade. I wanted the flavor, but I have boys that are picky about green stuff.  :)  I poured the marinade into a rimmed baking sheet, and then turned my salmon, skin still on, in the marinade a few times to coat, and then finally let it rest, skin side up in the marinade until we were ready to grill. It was only marinating for maybe 30 mins, but the salmon was SO tender and flavorful. This is our new favorite way to cook salmon, provided we have a couple of cedar planks!

You definitely should have a spray bottle handy to extinguish flames.  Didn't have on the first go round.  This dish was perfect the second time when I could prevent a fish inferno.  Even the European inlaws who hate any cooking but their own loved this dish

I'm not a salmon fan, but this recipe completely changed my mind. I marinated the salmon for about three hours before grilling. The flavor is amazing.

Holy schlamoly.

I made this for my wife's birthday dinner and she and I absolutely LOVED it.
It was a wee bit on the oily side, but certainly not enough to detract from the number of stars. We will be reducing the amount of oil used in the future. The vegetable oil, not the sesame oil, that is.

Still, this salmon is so good the leftovers may not last through the night. We're supposed to have the leftovers for dinner tomorrow but I may wait for the missus to go to sleep and scarf down the remainder. SO GOOD. Thanks a million for this recipe! It's stuff like this that reaffirms my belief you don't need to pay top dollar for a book to get good recipes.

So excellent!!!  My entire family loved it.  The only request was to maybe add some brown sugar or honey to the marinade so I might try that next time.  As for the planks, I boiled water and soaked them for about 4 hours and didn't have any problems with the wood burning.

FANTASTIC. This is a classic salmon dish that just can't be beat. 



Note to those people out there who are marinating salmon overnight- salmon begins to break down after 30 minutes of marinating. The texture will be severely compromised (mushy) if you do this! You might not notice it on frozen fillets but for those of us who live on a coast and feast on fresh salmon, it is a MAJOR no-no to marinate salmon for more than 30 minutes!

To reiterate "This is by far the best salmon I've ever eaten".  My husband loved it as well.  This is my dad's favorite fish and my mom's least favorite, but I think she will enjoy this version - I can't wait to make it for my parents.

We make salmon all the time, and this is by far the best salmon we've EVER had - including from a restaurant.  Grilling with the cedar planks provided the best flavor, and just the right amount of crispiness on top!

Only change we made was more salmon & marinade, and left the skin on and finished the salmon on the grill directly.   Husband poured left over marinade over the fish when it was on the planks/grill and we had a good fire going- but the fish did not burn- turned out great!

This is an outstanding recipe. I cannot cook (seriously, more than 6 ingredients and I usually pass,especially with exotic things like..ginger root), however, I am tired of purchasing Salmon from Ruby Tuesdays when I am in the mood. This was wonderful. The only thing I would change, is, much like the other reviewers stated, use lite soy to cut down on the saltiness. Will definitely use again. Thanks for posting.

This is a great way to cook salmon!  I got the boards at World Market and soaked them over night.  I used olive oil and garlic on the salmon and they took about 35 minutes to cook for 2 lbs.  Very moist and delicious!

I gave this a one star because you don't need a cedar plank.  I live in Alaska and salmon is a main staple, we catch it ourself.  What is important is the marinade not the cedar plank.

Best marinade for salmon (even used it for steak)! I don't like anything slightly fishy and didn't like salmon until I cooked it with this marinade, now we eat it regularly in my house! (Sockeye salmon is less fishy than Atlantic & look for wild salmon for better nutritional value). Thank you!

I cooked this up for our friends and they could not believe how fantastic it was, best all of us had ever had... This was my first time using the ceder planks and we are now hooked. We bought the sockeye salmon from Costco at about $8.00/lb with the skin. I soaked the planks in water, white wine and a little liquid smoke for several hours. I cooked on my good ole Weber charcoal grill and boy did it smoke. I also left the skin on.

holy cow... my husband who doesnt not like salmon loved it.  my daughter said it was the best salmon ever.  I followed the recipe exact except soaking the plank for about 7 hours. also, in case you are wondering, I usualy go for wild soho caught, but decided to try the fattier farm raised on this one.  it was the right choise.

Don't change a thing, a real crowd pleaser. I had a number of people say it was the best fish they had ever tasted in their life. I did have fresh sockeye that I had caught in Alaska the week before, but this recipe did it justice and then some.

This was delicious! I had only 1.25 lbs. of salmon so I adjusted accordingly.  I cut back a bit on the soy and vegetable sauces and was generous with the grated fresh ginger.  Thank you so much!

Super easy and delicious!  My husband, who has lukewarm feelings (at best) towards salmon, ate and loved it!  Didn't have fresh ginger on hand, but a tsp of the ground version works well.

Hands down, the best salmon I have prepared. I didn't change a thing. I soaked the planks for 24 hours, but still had the occasional flare-up. This is easily controlled if you make sure you have a little water close by. Thanks so much for sharing!!

First time using cedar plank on grill. A LOT LOT LOT of smoke while cooking. (Maybe I did the grill too high?) The flavor of this dish is AMAZING! I served it to company who visited me in FL from overseas (Japan). Everyone loved it!  Thanks!

Very good..I would def make this again but next time i would use less soy sauce and probably add alittle honey. Also, I put the remaining marinade in a small sauce pan and brought it to a boil. Drizzled a few table spoons over the salmon before plating it. Delish!

I love this recipe!   The only thing I did different was soak the planks in a water / white wine mix.  It gives the Salmon an amazing flavor.  A box of wine should do for it.

Fantastic recipe.  Thank you.  I soaked the plank for two hours and marinated the fish for two hours as well.  Really delicious.  Thanks!

Super simple to prepare.  Added a nice flavor to the salmon without overpwering it.  I added extra ginger and soaked the planks in white wine for more flavor.

Great recipe.  The only change I made was to "blender" the marinade first to mix the ingredients better.  I do this with every "oil and vinegar" based marinate to keep it from separating during the marinade process. I want the green onions and ginger to have a chance to "get involved" too.

This is a delicious, refreshing change from the usual grilled or pan-seared salmon. Smoke from the cedar plank completes the blend of rice vinegar/sesame oil, soy sauce, green onions and ginger from the marinade to produce a very tasty meal. 20 mins was about right on my infrared grill at medium heat; the salmon was very moist and full of flavor. I roasted olive oil-coated asparagus spears the last 3 minutes (very light salt/pepper) and served with Asian rice. As suggested, a moderate priced pinot noir pairs nicely. Excellent recipe, we'll use again soon.

This was the best salmon that I have ever eaten too!  The recipe was awesome!!  And I guess it helped that it was freshly caught and flash frozen in Alaska.  Made it to Georgia before the people did!  I would not change a thing about this recipe.  Unbelieveably delicious!!!!!

I hate fish unless it's breaded and from a box.  I made this as part of surf and turf with our friends next-door fully intending to eat just the steak. Not only did I eat this I loved it. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Than you for sharing this recipe!

OMG, this was the absolute BEST salmon I have EVER eaten!  Even my husband, who doesn't like salmon at all, liked it and the kids said it was better than a restauran!  I didn't have green onions, so used chopped red onion instead, and used apple cider vinegar (Bragg's) with a little honey in place of the rice vinegar.  This will DEFININTELY be a go-to recipe!

I wanted to attempt making cedar planked salmon and I found this recipe. The reviews were great so I had to try it. It was very delicious! It's taste mostly consists of the cedar rather than the marinade but it was a good combination. I will definately be making salmon more often now including this recipe. Thanks.

My only change was to use canola oil instead of vegetable oil (trying the healthier option).  It was great!  Tip:  to soak the planks, place them in a clean sink and put heavy pots on top.  I would suggest 3-4 hours of soaking to prevent charring.

Excellent!!  I marinated the salmon for 3 hours and it had an excellent flavor further enhanced by the cedar smoked flavor.  I will soak the plank for longer because it did catch on fire.

This marinade makes the best cedar planked salmon I have ever had. My 11 year old daughter begs me to make this for her all the time and she is very picky. Make it as is and you won't be dissapointed.

This was the best thing I have ever made- AMAZING.  I used wild sockeye salmon and it was delicious.  Don't be afraid of the cedar plank, just be sure to soak the plank for at least 4 hours.  As an extra treat save the marinade and boil it so you can serve it with the fish.  I served the fish with asparagus and a plain rice and salad.  TRY THIS you will be a star!!! Thanks for the receipe

Prepared the cedar plank salmon recipe for my mom for mothers day and she loved it. She said it was the best salmon she's ever had. It was so juicy and moist, with an excellent flavor.

Added a little bit of lemon zest, and a small squeeze of lemon juice. Used whitee onion instead, becuase I didnt have the green onion. Cooked the salmon on the grill over low heat (about 350 degrees). Paired it with a baked potato and some marinated aspearugus (sp?)

I made this last weekend for a family BBQ in Yorkshire, and it was amazing.  I personally thought the cedar plank contributed more towards the flavour than this marinade but they worked together excellently.  If you don't like some of the flavours in this dish, don't be afraid to use a slightly different / more simple marinade but definitely keep the cedar plank cooking method.  I grilled on a BBQ without a hood so I placed some tin-foil over the top and it smoked the fish beautifully.

I got this in my email this morning as the Daily Dish, and since we've had planks in the cupboard for months and my husband just bought grouper from the Freezer-Meat Guy (door-to-door frozen meat and seafood saleman), I decided to try this recipe on the grouper. I mixed the marinade in a ziplock bag with the fish and let it sit for about 20-25 minutes. The wood soaked for at least 2 hours. Let me tell you... this was wonderful. Tender, flavourful but not overpowering that of the fish itself, definitely in the "to make again" list.  I had two different brands of cedar planks to feed my whole family, and so the taste was different for each plank, just so you know: if you don't like this the first time around, change the wood, you might be pleasantly surprised. As it was, both versions were lovely, but still quite different, as one was more woodsy and the other gained a sweetness that didn't come from the marinade.   My sons can be picky eaters, but as it was, my oldest polished his plate faster than his parents did.   Highly recommend.

I had to comment on how wonderful this is. I was able to find cedar planks at my local grocer and made this exactly as written. I highly recommend and would not change a thing. Incredible.

We prepared this salmon recipe for a belated Christmas party, and it was excellent.  Everyone loved the moistness and smokey flavor of the fish.  Even the young children. some of whom were picky eaters, ate it.    We covered the fish (on the planks) with aluminum foil for transport.  The meal was buffet style, so we left the fish on the planks for presentation purposes.  When preparing the marinade, it is important to emulsify the liquid ingredients with the oil.  This will allow the oil molecules to surround the liquid molecules and prevent one ingredient from permeating the fish and dominating the entire flavor.  One reviewer mentioned that the fish tasted very salty, which was most likely from the soy sauce being separated from the oil in the marinade.     MEG

Wonderful! I highly recommend this recipe even for those who aren't big fish eaters. My family raved about it - even my husband who didn't think he liked salmon. So tender and flavorful!  The only suggestion I have is to be careful on the salt - I used the lower sodium soy sauce and am guessing it would be too salty for some tastes using regular soy sauce.

Wonderful recipe for Salmon! This one is staying in my recipe box. Next time, instead of discarding the marinade, I will brush a bit more on at intervals while it's grilling. The marinade is TO DIE FOR!!

I made this and served to guests for a special dinner last night. They all agreed that it was fantastic. My daughter said it was the best salmon ever. My husband said it was " like butta" . We all recommend highly. Its easy to make and prepare.  I followed the recipe with no changes. I will certainly make this again.

Excellent recipe. Savoury and delicious. I found that using high heat and getting the cedar to char a bit increased the smokey flavour and the caramelization on the fish. All in all, this is one of my go-to recipes now for salmon.

I avoid cooking fish.  I'm not much of a fish lover, but I know it's good for me, so....
This recipe made a fish lover out of me!  Every single person in my family raved about it and it was easy.  I served it on the cedar planks (with a hot pad under them) and even the presentation was amazing.  I suggest you serve it with the Pecan Rice (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Pecan-Rice/Detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=rice&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page&soid=sr_results_p2i3), which was also amazing.  We also had a salad and made the Asian Dressing found here:  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Asian-Ginger-Dressing/Detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=asian%20rice&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page&soid=sr_results_p1i21.  All around FANTASTIC meal!

Fantastic. Made it 4 times now, a few hopefully helpful comments. First, cut the fish into your serving sizes so each piece gets maximum marinade coverage, plus it looks great when serving. Second, I went heavier on the garlic and ginger, and I even mixed in a bit of wasabi which was awesome. Finally, when planking, go ahead and spread the solid bits from the marinade over each piece, it makes a yummy and good looking crust when done

Unfortunately a monster thunderstorm rolled through with accompanying torrential rain just as it was time to put this on the grill. Rather than BBQ in the rain, I fished the planks out of their water bath to save for another day and broiled this in the oven. I'm sure it wasn't as good, but it was still terrific and everyone raved about it. I doubled the recipe so I'd have abundant marinade, and running a little short on fresh ginger, I added a dab of powdered ginger to compensate. Worked out fine, and now you know you can make this year round if you live in a harsh climate and do not have a covered outside grill area.

I'm clearly the minority here, but I wasn't really a fan. I soaked my cedar plank for about 1.5 hours, which wasn't enough time because it caught on fire half way through cooking. Awesome (not really). I finished the salmon in the oven, and after all the hassle, it wasn't even that great. Too salty (despite using low sodium soy sauce). I love salmon and I'll be sticking with my old cedar plank salmon recipe.

Great recipe!  I ended up getting skin-on salmon, and it worked quite well - I cooked it skin-side down.

Keeping the BBQ chamber at about 400 degrees kept the cedar from flaming out, yet still infused the salmon with some good smoked cedary goodness.  Good slow-baking temperature for the salmon.

My family raved about this recipe!

Made this tonight following the recipe precisely and it was amazing.  Once I heated the grill I kept the heat on the lowest setting as the cedar planks kept catching and I wanted char not ash... a 2 pound filet took right at 20 minutes and came out perfectly.  Definitely will be making this again, a perfect fish recipe!

This is an excellent recipe for Salmon.  I have a freezer full of Coho and Sockeye at the moment, from my husbands fishing trip to BC. This was excellent.  He just loved it!  Make sure to use Low Sodium Soy Sauce or it will be way too salty.  

I served this with Basmati Rice and stir fried veggies; consisting of Cremini Mushrooms, Sweet Vadalia Onions, and Zucchini, with a splash of soy, salt, pepper and toasted sesame seeds.  Yummmmmy!

Delish!  Super easy, I reduced the soy to 1/8 cup.  Marinated for about 45 min.  The flavor was outstanding & the presentation excellent.  And oh that smell coming from the grill!  Had the neighbors jealous.  Served with Asperagus & Herbed Baby Reds

This was the most delicious piece of fish I have ever had. I made this for Mothers Day for my wife with a piece of Cedar I bought from Lowe's. I soaked the Cedar overnight, and I marinated the Salmon for 6 hours (both probably overkill). The smoked caramelized the marinade and sealed in the flavor. Even my kids couldn't get enough. My only regret is that I didn't buy more fish.

Mmm...yummy! Not only did I reduce the oil to 1/4 cup (which was PLENTY), I accidentally used 1 Tablespoon of sesame oil, & added a few dashes of lemon/pepper. Marinated for about 1-1/2 hours, & cedar planked as directed. Once the salmon was on the grill I simmered the marinade for about 10 minutes & used it to baste...EVERYONE loved it & thankfully the sesame did not overpower as I feared. I would just say to be suure & used only FRESH ginger (I always have a root in the freezer), dried would NOT be acceptable in this dish!

As all the previous comments say, an easy and absolutely delicious dish with looks that are sure to impress.

 I took one reviewers comment to heart about wanting a glaze and turned Bobby Flays brown sugar and mustard glaze into a dipping sauce. HUGE success. While the fish didn't need it by any means it was a nice addition to give the juicy fish a nice sweet taste once and awhile. Served it alongside some grilled asparagus and a bottle of white wine.

I've never cooked salmon and never grilled on a cedar plank.  I had it at a restaurant and thought I'd give it a try.  This recipe was perfect and delicious.  Best of all...it couldn't have been any easier!  There is no question that this will be a frequent request at my house!

I used a bit of liquid smoke instead of the cedar and ground ginger instead of fresh.  I also added a splash of lemon juice.  I used 2 lbs of salmon, but doubled the marinade recipe.  It was a hit with our whole family of 8.

Fantastic.  The marinade tasted and smelled excellent.  The cedar smoke really got into the fish good.  I found a 2 pack of cedar planks at Lowes for $6.88.

Made as directed except for replacing fresh ginger and green onions, because I didn't have either.  My husband and 2 of 3 kids loved this.  My preschooler wouldn't eat more than a bite or two.  Probably would have been even better with all the ingredients!

WOWZA!!! This dish is amazing! Our plank burnt to a cinder but we had a spray water bottle on hand to douse the flames. The taste was so delish and the smell filled the neighbourhood. Our neighbour came over to see what was cooking! Thanks for sharing!

This was awesome! My husband, who normally dislikes fish, was not terribly excited about trying this, but ended up declaring it "the best fish he'd ever eaten!" He actually finished a good-sized piece and is looking up ways to make his own planks for future use. Really great way to prepare salmon!

This way of cooking salmon is the best I have found.  I do a similar thing, except I use a marinade of good bourbon, brown sugar and whatever spices hit my fancy.

My first time trying anything like this, and it came out excellent!  Soaked the wood for 1.5 days, marinated the salmon for just over an hour, cooked for 20 min.  Even my 5-year-olds ate it!

AMAZING! We added a little bit of honey & lime juice, about 1/4 c. chopped cilantro, and substituted the green onions for red onions. My husband poured some of the marinade on top of the salmon to cook with the salmon. SO so good. This would be amazing with so many different meats, too!!!

to help with the 'health' of this meal, I used a 1/4 cup of olive oil vs the 1/3 cup of veggie oil.  Additionally, I went a little lighter on the ginger and added sesame seeds to the marinade.  All substitutions were fantastic.  This is an easy and fast alternative to normal lemon pepper or other basic seasonings.  Wish I had leftovers - our friends ate it all!

The marinade is marvelous.  I have never used a plank before.  Adds wonderful smell and taste.  Four pounds of salmon was gobbled up by my guest.  Will go out and find a steady source of planks!

We loved loved loved this recipe.  I cooked it on the grill on low to allow the plank to smoke with the salmon on it, then turned it up at the end.  It was amazing.  My kids loved it too.

Fantastic results. I didn't have a chance to cook this on the grill so I just threw it in the oven. It was moist, delicious and most of all, very simple. This is definitely going to be one I make again.

Mouthwatering! I didn't change a thing about the recipe and loved every bite! I served it with mango salsa and jasmine rice, but the salmon was perfect on its own. I rarely eat leftover salmon, but this was good enough to re-heat for lunch the next day! Thanks for a keeper!

Used the cedar planks we got at Costco; the marinade for the salmon is awesome.  Didn't have green onion on hand, so used finely chopped red onion.  It was simple and absolutely the only marinade & method of cooking  I will use for salmon, in warm weather that is! Great for company.

this was much better than the salmon we usually grill.  we normally use the same spices, but the cedar planks really make the difference.  we love this with broccoli, carrots, safron rice, and a nice white wine.

This was amazing!  I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of salmon to BBQ.  I also used extra garlic and it turned out fantastic!  I highly recommend that you marinade for the full hour.

My husband made this for his family. A quote from his brother, "This is the best salmon I've ever tasted." He's done cedar planked salmon before, but not with a flavorful marinade like this.

I think salmon on a cedar plank is one of the best ways to eat salmon, the flavor is outstanding.

We eat salmon at least once a month.  I always soak my plank for 6 or 7 hours.   I also use grape seed oil instead of vegetable oil,  and use only half the amount called for.    The salmon is moist and so delicious tasting.    I can’t imagine preparing it any other way!

Wow, what an excellent combination of spices with the ginger root,  oils, with the Sesame oil,  along with the soaked Cedar Shakes, what an excellent flavor. All my quests loved it. The only changes I made was that I soak the regular untreated cedar shakes from any lumber yard like Menards, I soaked them for 4 days. Also sprayed the top side with Pam. And also, I doubled the recipe because I used 3 1/2 lbs of Salmon.  Placed them skin side down for 22 minutes with my gas grill set @ 350 degrees. With the soaked boards, it was just like a cedar steam aroma. Because the shakes are tapered, you need to have a water spray bootle on hand  to put out any  possibly burning shakes. Thank you for providing the greatest tasting salmon we’ve ever tasted.

This is a great recipe, as is but I have added a few ingredients here and there each time I have made it.   Ponzu (lime and/or citrus) is a great addition to the soy sauce. I add equal parts of soy sauce and the ponzu to add some additional flavors. Have also added some cilantro along with the green onions.  I made this on Saturday with Copper River salmon and it was amazing- sort of an Asian-Fusion vibe.

I don't skin the salmon fillets as mentioned in the recipe.  The skin comes off easily after cooking, so the additional effort to skin the fillets is not worth the time in my opinion. It also seems to keep some of the moisture in the meat as it cooks.

Another tip- instead of buying cedar planks for a ridiculous cost in the store, I have a pile of western cedar fence board ends left over from some fencing projects. These are untreated, a little over a 1/2" thick, and do an outstanding job for plank grilling. I can cut them to whatever length I need- then soak in warm water for a few hours prior to use on the grill. Of course, you have to be careful that the lumber you use is not treated.  Alder also makes for great plank grilling.

I live in the Pacific NW so I've had some of the best salmon anywhere but have never tried doing this at home until tonight.  Amazing!  I did soak the cedar planks for about five hours but I'm not sure it made that big of a difference.   No need to continue looking for a restaurant worthy salmon dish - this is it for us from now on.

We bought the cedar planked salmon at Kroger. This was our first time trying cedar planked salmon so I looked up a recipe and this one came up. I am an extremely picky eater- I have never liked salmon because of the strong flavoring; but this one was delicious! It was so moist and flavorful. I marinated it for an hour and left out the ginger. It was a big hit for Father's Day!

This was absolutely delicious - I followed the 'kitchen tip' in Allrecipes magazine on cooking time (to use the rule of 8 minutes per inch of thickness).  My salmon was about 2 1/2 inches thick, so I cooked for about 20 minutes.  I also added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to the marinade and the dish was amazing!  The whole family love it!

9/5/2016 - made this a second time, followed the recipe easily and cooked on the grill, very nice presentation and flavor.

3/30/2015 - Very good, easy to prepare.  Looks & smells amazing while cooking.  Cooked in oven b/c it's too cold out to grill.

Very good recipe. I bought ONE 2 lb package of salmon and it was enough for 6. I purchased the planks online from Costco. They are $30 for 10.

I made this on the recommendation of a coworker. My son loves salmon, so I thought I would try it. I,  personally,  have never liked salmon,  but, after trying this version, I have changed my mind. The recipe was super easy to prepare and delicious!

By far the best salmon I've ever had. Especially considering I grew up on seafood in South Florida. I omitted the  ginger and used a tablesp of garlic. The soy gave a perfect level of saltiness without being overbearing.

Made this last night and it was outstanding!  Soaked the boards for about 3 hours. I did indirect grilling, the board never caught fire.  I made a couple of minor tweaks, I used olive instead of vegetable oil, and used low sodium soy sauce.  The ingredients were spot on. It was very flavorful, but not too overwhelming.  One more thing, I kept the grill at 350 degrees and it took longer than I expected to cook through. Next time I'm going to try keeping the heat at 400. Can't wait to make it again!

This is the only way to cook salmon. Planking it makes the fish so moist and tasty. I left the skin on and it was delicious.

Confession: I don't like fish. I don't eat fish. Needless to say, I don't cook fish. But my husband and son LOVE fish, so I thought I'd be generous and try cooking something for them. I picked this recipe for my first attempt. Result: Husband and son were THRILLED!  I was pleased with how fast and easy it was. I even had a little taste of the salmon and it was very flavorful. Two modifications: it's winter where I live, so I baked the fish instead of grilling. And, I left the skin on during cooking because it was icky to touch and everything I read said it would peel off extra easy after cooking, which it did. I will be making this again. And again. And my family thanks you!

Amazing, I made it on the plank in the oven as well , turned out delirious, was a huge hit at a big get together I had.  I roasted it at 450.  Highly recommend this recipe.

I literally coukdnt eat it. The flavor was flat and boring. The sauce resembles a teriyaki base but it had no sugar...sauce smelled like a can of open sardines. The cedar came thru but not enough to disguise the missing taste.  Dissaponted.  Shouldve gone with my instinct n only test a serving before marinating all my salmon.

Let me first start off by saying I do not care for Salmon. My husband really enjoys Salmon so I was trying to find a recipe that I could prepare at home. Per other reviewer comments I soaked the plank 3+ hours and allowed it to drip dry slightly before placing it on the grill. Please note while at costco picking up the planks they where sampling a pineapple habanero glaze for fish so I picked up a bottle. I marinated the salmon according to the recipe and grilled as indicated. The only change I made was to brush some of the pineapple habanero glaze on the salmon just before serving. WOW! I actually ate some of the salmon and liked it. My family was shocked. It was such a hit we made it again a week later. The second time my husband was rushing and didn't allow the plank to drip dry slightly before placing it on the gill and there was a lot more smoke and ceder flavor. A bit too intense. Still good but a little strong. We will continue to use this recipe but I will make sure the the planks have a couple of minutes to dry before placing on the grill. I am rating this a 4 star as the glaze gives it a little kick and adds that extra something. Thanks so much for sharing.

AMAZING!!!! First let me say that I eat a lot of salmon - love the stuff!  I've had cedar-plank salmon at restaurants and have blackened/baked/broiled it at home.  This is the first time I've ever tried cedar-plank salmon at home, and let me tell ya, this was the best salmon I've ever had!!  Secondly, I usually treat recipes as a guideline; I've been cooking for many years & I know what works well for my family's tastes, so I usually alter things a bit.  This recipe didn't need any adjustments...PERFFECT! Thank you wmore :)

The salmon was melt in your mouth delicious!  The recipe is easy and the planks impart a woody/smokey flavor.  I'm going to make this whenever salmon is in season.  Yummm!!

This was the first time I've cooked salmon on the grill and boy did it turn out delicious.  The only thing I changed was to use reduced sodium soy sauce.

Very good. Try soaking your plank in apple juice for 4 hours. Fantastic.  Better than eating out. Impress your freinds.

->10 stars....10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
my now FIANCE (in stead of bf) said it was the BEST he's had (and NO he didn't do anything wrong :) I actually didn't do the receipe because I was looking up "how to bbq cedar with salmon" so much that I forgot the ingredients.HA!. SO i had this FAB-TASTIC teriaki sauce and it worked well...cooked about 300 on bbq for 20 or more min and put aspargus coated with lemon/olive oil/s/p around the outside :D

Seriously the best salmon we've had - restaurant or at home!  I used 1/4 cup of olive oil in place of the vegetable oil, increased the garlic and had to use powdered ginger.  Still incredible!!  Good advice to grill the empty plank alone until crackling - my plank instructions indicate to put fish on plank directly from soaking and then on the grill.  I think the pre-grilling of the blank plank is what led to the perfect blackened look on our salmon!  WONDERFUL!

This recipe is amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. Next time I will use a little less oil but otherwise it's definitely a keeper. I prepared this with the Grilled Marinated Shrimp recipe from this site. Paired it with my fav red wine. Wonderful.

This recipe was fabulous!  It was our first time using cedar planks, and my husband was worried the marinade would be too much to be able to appreciate using the cedar for first time.  Wow did it ever turn out good!  So we don't know if it was from the cedar or the marinade, but highly recommend it!!

I've never made cedar planked salmon before but always wanted to try it. This recipe sounded pretty straight forward and I liked that it had fresh ginger and garlic. I ended up using a cedar plank I had left over from a fence project earlier this month. The salmon turned out great a smelled awesome while grilling. My 3 daughters all went for seconds so I think it was a success. I'll definitely make this dish again.

Very tasty and very well received by my family of picky eaters ranging from 2 - 17 years old. In fact, once I got my two year old to try it he ate more of it then anyone else. 

We would make this a lot more often if we could source some reasonably priced cedar planks.

When the fish really starts to darken up on the grill, do not worry.  Although the meat gets dark it did not burn and it was moist throughout. 

Enjoy!

I made this this past weekend~the first absolutely beautiful weekend~ It was the biggest hit!! So moist and full of flavor! The cedar and the marinade are a marriage made in heaven! Everyone had seconds, and thirds in some cases!  This is one recipe that has a permanent home in my recipe book!

It doesn't get any better than this!  I used Atlantic Salmon and removed the skin.  I filled the 1/3 cup of oil with about 2/3 extra virgin olive oil, and the last little bit with vegetable oil.  I hate the idea of taking an otherwise healthy meal and making it bad for you by using vegetable oil, but I wasn't sure if the flavor of the olive oil would change the flavor of the dish.  Next time I will just do all olive oil.  The salmon was just so flavorful and buttery.  I can't wait to make it again.  Soaked my planks for 25 hours, froze the ones I didn't use so that it's ready to go the next time I make this, which will no doubt be in just a few days.  You won't be disappointed in this dish, and if you are, you've done something wrong or altered it too much.

This was nice - I think I liked the cedar plank more than the marinade on the salmon.  But the marinade is wonderful alone, I imagine it would be great on other meats.

EXCELLENT!!! my NEW FAV Dish !!! amazing flavors it REALLY "POPS" !   next to it on the grill, i did asparagus with EVOO and balsamic (dressing ], i didnt have Balsamic vinegar) salt, and plenty of black pepper The combined smoke taste from the cedar salmon crossed over and complimented nicely. A WINNER !!!!   impressed the Fiance~ too :)

Wow, very moist, great marinade. Rated as 4 stars, could use a little zip in the marinade. Took about 20 minutes to cook on grill.

Excellent and simple to make.  Grilling the salmon on a cedar plank adds great flavor.  I soaked my cedar plank overnight and it worked well.

This turned out very well.  I had gotten tired of salmon and needed something to change up the taste.  This did the trick.  My only concern is the cost of using the cedar planks.  The ones we got can only be used 3 times and that's if they aren't too charred.  They were pretty pricey.  The recipe was quick on tasty and we enjoyed it.

Very good recipe.  I could eat this all day.  I used sockeye salmon from Vons and it turned out great.  My two daughters (4 & 1.5) ate it all up!

this is outstanding, my husband loves salmon and I had never had it, so I was hesitant to eat it.  I loved it.  My sister-in-law loved it and wanted the recipe, so I will be printing and giving to others who I know like salmon.   Fantastic recipe

Very simple and delicious! I made this without the green onions and ginger because I didn't have either.  Marinated it for less than 1/2 hour, so I'd love to try it after a longer soak.  The color and texture were fantastic! Not quite as smoky as I had imagined, but I may work on that.  My plank caught on fire, so I had to run for the spray bottle of water and spray it every few minutes.  I ended up flipping the plank and cooking the salmon on the charred side.  I had a giant piece of charcoal at the end, so I might try lower heat next time and soak it for several hours first.  Excellent with a large salmon portion, but mine was done in only about 15 minutes.  Next time - individual salmon steaks!

Nice marinade!   I use this same marinade with grilled flank steak. I only use sesame oil though and add red pepper flakes for spice. I marinade for a day and grill.

This was a huge hit!!! We bought 2 large salmon fillets for mother's day dinner.  One was marinated by the store and the other we marinated according to this recipe.  We grilled both on cedar planks and this recipe was MUCH better than the store marinated version.  DELICIOUS... we will make again and again this summer!

The salmon tasted wonderful. Everyone loved it. I soaked my plank for 2-3 hours and it completely caught on fire on my gas grill. I was able to put out and use it, but I need to practice cooking with a plank.

The hardest thing in this  recipe, for me, was to find a big enough container to soak the cedar plank.  The fish tasted and looked great. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.

I made this recipe last weekend. I went exactly by recipe since I am a vegetarian and do not eat fish,so can cannot taste. Everyone told me that this is was very good and did not have any fishy taste to it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

the best salmon I've ever had!! My husband (who is not great in the kitchen, by any stretch!!) made this for me for valentines day. So it's a pretty basic and simple meal to prepare. And it was like butter - it just melted in my mouth!  He served it with asparagus, rice and a baguette and white wine. Best salmon ever!!

This was the first time to try the salmon on the cedar planks. Grilling with the planks was so easy and the marinade is absolutely delicious.  Everyone loved it.  Did not change a single ingredient.  5 stars all around!!

We made this last night on the barbeque. I didn't let the plank heat first, I followed the directions that came with the plank instead. Otherwise I followed the recipe precisely and it was very tasty salmon! I marinated about 6 hours. Will definately make again! Thank you!

This has to be one of the best salmon dishes I've ever cooked.  I let the salmon marinate for about 4 hours, but the marinade was not overpowering at all.  The combination of the smokiness from the cedar plank and the saltiness of the marinade made for a wonderful taste.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except I left the skin on the fish and cooked skin side down.  I marinaded the fish for about 1/2 hour.  It came out great, with the nice smokey taste from the cedar and a little saltiness from the marinade.  I'll definitely be cooking this again!

I've been a frequent visitor of allrecipes.com for about 3 years now, and I joined just now only so I could rate this recipe.  This salmon is AMAZING--the best salmon I've ever had.  I used olive oil and substituted red onions for the green onions because I forgot to get them at the store.  I served it with sweet potatoes (also cooked on the grill), and vegetable kabobs.  So delicious!  I plan on recommending this recipe to everyone I know!

This recipe was easy and fantastic!  I served for my parents who are expert grillers and cooks.  We all loved it.  I did not have the ginger root but it the marinade was still excellent.  I gave it a five star rating because of it's ease and gourmet taste.

I fell in love with one of the pictures for this recipe the other night so I made out a list and headed to the store. I was able to get everything easily. My only problem was the cost of the salmon, being a poor college student with expensive tastes but barely any cash. I had enough money to either buy the good quality fresh salmon but with no sides and dessert or I could have gotten the frozen salmon and get sides, dessert and a nice bottle of white wine. I opted for the second because my roommate and I enjoy full meals. Despite the poorer quality of fish it still tasted amazing!

I, of course, added more garlic - chopped, and made it in the oven.  It was absolutely delicious, even my picky 11 year old couldn't get enough!

This was the best salmon I have ever fixed.  My guest could not get enough.  Followed the directions and marinated for a couple of hours and then cooked on a cedar plank on the grill -- turned out perfect!!!

I made this recipe last night.  It was great and very easy to make.  Would be great for company.  Make marinade ahead, then marinate for an hour, when ready to prepare just takes 20 minutes on plank. I will use this recipe often.

This was absolutely delicious.  I marinated the salmon for 3 hours. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. I paired it with a wild green salad with balsamic vinegarette dressing and a mushroom risoto.  I served a white "citrusy" (not "sweet")wine. If I could remember what the name of the wine was I would include it, unfortunately I can't remember. :(   This dinner was so well received that there was a very little table talk! :)  Everyone was stuffing their face and didn't want to take the time to talk. 
I know they say you can reuse cedar planks but I have not yet been able to do that as mine always catch on fire...even after soaking them overnight!!

This is now my all-time favorite fish recipe, regardless of the type of fish.  I followed the ingredients exactly, and highly recommend the extra effort of fresh ginger and garlic over the dry stuff.  The only thing I did differently was I baked it in the oven.  I still used the cedar plank and soaked it, then I lined a cookie sheet with foil and placed the plank on a wire rack over the cookie sheet.  Baked at 360F until fish was 145F inside and it came out moist, flaky, and tender.

This is so easy to make and I feel like a professional every time I make it! I have found that wildwoodgrillingoutlet.com has by far the cheapest planks in bulk! Now I've been trying to plank everything from meats, veggies and fruits.

Delicious way to cook salmon. One of my favourite recipes. Cut back just a bit on the soy sauce but otherwise followed the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I love salmon and this is clearly one of the best salmon dishes I've ever eaten. Full of flavor and moist. Made the marinade exactly as written except omitted the ginger.  Marinated for about 45 minutes. Soaked the planks for almost 4 hrs and had no flames. Will be able to re-use the planks at least a couple of more times.

This was definitely a five star dish. I followed the recipe exactly as written and this was the best salmon I’ve ever had. Just be sure to soak the cedar plank so it doesn’t catch fire.

This was truly delicious!  I have only just started to like salmon and recipes like this really help me to enjoy it!  Made it exactly as written.  One thing my hubbie did is he turned the salmon over directly onto the grill just to grill it up a little then put it back on the plank.  Added a nice little crunch to the top.

I thought the recipe was terrific.  Never used cedar planks before.  The 4-star vs. 5 was because hubby said he didn't see it worth the effort but again, the copycat  Longhorn Steak House recipe is what I usually use which really is pretty awesome.  Just have to have some quality bourbon lying around the house.

I followed the recipe exactly... but my family still prefers the other recipe  from this site,  Blackened  Salmon.
I soaked my boards for over 24 hours, followed all the directions & still my boards basically burned, the fish was not burned, but this was crazy... with the amount of smoke it made. the taste I was told,  was good, but they prefer the other recipe, and since I do not eat salmon, I cannot judge this dish.

Making this tonight. Hubby works at a shop n is bringing home cedar plank. I did not have all ingredients. Substituted dried onions for green; powdered ginger for fresh, etc.
Hubby is not big on salmon, but I cannot wait!

Best coho salmon ever. Twenty minutes at medium heat was about 325 degrees. Perfectly cooked. Good marinade, nice and simple. I left it in for two hours. Served with barbecued eggplant.

Carolyn and I had this last evening, and both of us were over-the-top impressed with it. I grilled it on my charcoal grill, used two cedar planks.... used the recipe pretty much“as-is” (minor tweaks for our tastes - extra sesame oil and garlic).  Without a doubt, this is one Hall of Fame recipe... easy prep and delicious!!.... best salmon recipe yet!!.... We would give it 10 stars if possible.....

Made this for a Father's Day dinner party for a group of 20 and, whoa.... every person RAVED about it!! Best they've ever had, they said - and this isn't a group that is going to be nice just to make me feel good, especially with a chef amongst them. Even I liked it and I'm not a seafood fan. Recipe is definitely a keeper and one that was shared with everyone. 

We soaked the planks in a mixture of water, salt and apple cider vinegar for about 5 hours. Made the recipe without changes.

This was the best salmon I've had in ages! I got some wild caught Red Sockeye Salmon, followed the directions for the recipe. It came out sooo moist and flavorful. I did add a little fresh lemon juice at the table. I'm still thinking about tha wonderful flavor, five days later!!

Made this last night and had our neighbor over. We all loved it! The marinade mixed with the cedar flavor was absolutely delicious.  This will become my go to recipe for salmon!

Perfect recipe but I made one simple substitution that made it the best salmon ever!  I used a Maple plank in place of Cedar. The sweetness of the plank with the tartness of the recipe was perfect.

I made this last night, and it was absolutely, incredibly delicious. The salmon was so moist and tender. I am a cedar plank fan now, and will be doing more recipes using this method. The only thing I changed was using walnut oil instead of sesame oil, just because that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make this again and again and again!!

Wow, this was delish!  I made it on the BBQ without the planks because I didn't have them.  I can't wait to try them with the planks!

Delicious and so easy! Simple, fresh ingredients and a quick cook time (just remember to soak the cedar planks beforehand).  Next time I might add black pepper and a touch of sea salt, but otherwise it is perfect!

Great recipe!!  So delicious!!  I marinated the salmon for a few hours, but I think next time I'll take another reviewers advice and only marinade for about 30 mins, since the longer marinade made the meat a little "soggy".

I don't give many 5 stars, but wow, this was good. Pretty much followed as written, 450 degree grill on cedar soaked for an hour. Served with lime-seasoned Basmati rice and an oaked Chardonnay. Summer has arrived. Thanks Wendy, great recipe!

Amazing! So tender and juicy. Not the dry salmon I remember from my youth. It only took 15 minutes to finish mine. Make sure to check it with a fork as the other reviews suggested.  ??????

I have made this at least 10 times now, it's THAT good! I don't change a thing (other than leaving the skin on) - we think it is perfect just as written. I have made this in the oven when Mother Nature wouldn't cooperate, and while it's good that way, it definitely doesn't get that delicious smokiness the grill adds. Super-easy for a work night, but fancy enough to impress guests.

Made this for the first time as a surprise Valentine's Dinner for my wife and she loved it. This has a great hint of smokiness from the cedar plank and underlying hints of Asian flavors that don' t overpower the flavor of the salmon. Pairs well with a soft red wine.

Today was a sub zero day is PA so I made this in the oven, the cedar plank did smoke up the kitchen but the final product was worth it.  I followed the recipe and marinated the salmon filet for one hour and soaked the plank for 2 1/2 hours.  I am always looking for ways to cook salmon since I buy 10lbs a year from KwiJack,

This recipe seems to be a great add and was fairly simple to make. I followed the instructions as listed with a few changes per recommendations made within the comments. I will have to make this again and update my rating due to purchasing frozen salmon vs fresh selects (BIG MISTAKE). I did not like the quality of the meat selection so my review for now is bias hence the 3 star rating. I wasn’t able to tell if the lack of flavor was a result of this. Once I remake this dish I will update.

This is a great staple in our house.  In winter months I bake it in tin foil in the oven and it’s still good.  Excellent recipe people always ask me for it when I do it for parties.

Really good...going to do it again.  My only reason for 4 stars is  that  I thought a little too smokey and could not taste the marinade as much as I thought I would.  It  may be because we used 1" planks instead of 2" planks.  Excellent idea and marinade!

One of my absolute favorite things I’ve made from here. It’s SO easy and SO yummy. I’m not a huge Salmon person, but I could eat this almost every day. I served it with roasted potatoes, green beans, and a crab cake.

This was awesome and different. Our planks burned a bit even in the toasting the plank stage for just over a minute.  Maybe our grill gets too hot. It's an old grill.  I wanted a little sweeter flavor for the marinade so I added 1-2 tablespoon brown sugar to the used marinade and boiled it for a while to kill any fish stuff.  I loved the added sauce. 
I want to try it again and maybe turn down the grill.

I followed the marinade recipe exactly but only had two 6oz salmon filets, so I had extra sauce that I cooked and used in the grilled salmon.  Wonderful recipe. Will definitely make again.

It turned out so well that we had to have it again a couple days later. I followed this recipe exactly. Never having made any type of fish on a plank, we then tried whitefish. Used a different recipe, but it also turned out great, also. I'll never make fish any other way except using a plank!!! Delicious!!

Followed the recipe to a T for the marinade. But I checked on the salmon after about 15mins and it was already perfectly cooked. Just cooked enough to be able to flake off a piece of salmon while leaving the fish still moist and juicy. I'd recommend checking on the salmon a littler earlier than the 20min time suggested depending on your preference.

Great recipe; I eat a lot of salmon here in Seattle and this is one of the best preparations I've tried.  It's especially good with fresh King Salmon.  I try to avoid overcooking or undercooking by using a good instant read thermometer...120 for wild salmon and 125 for farm-raised seems to be just about right.

This was very good, but a bit salty!   I'll reduce the the soy sauce next time (perhaps different varieties have different saltiness?)   Also, I noticed the video shows three planks on the grill for the two salmon filets.  I've been cedar planking for years, and have always found it much easier to just fit each filet on its own plank.  That way it can also be served still on the plank, if you want, for a pretty presentation.

Marinade was the perfect balance of salty and sweet.  I made no changes.  I grilled it on a cedar plank, which I soaked in water for approx. 3 hours, at med-low for about 9 and a half minutes.  Super quick, no-fuss meal...once I put the salmon on the plank, I closed the bbq lid and left it alone for the duration while I cooked the accompanying vegetables. The perfect recipe for salmon!

i made some slight modifications - i used ginger and garlic paste, sesame oil instead of vegetable and omitted the vinegar (seemed redundant with the dijon mustard). i also used some sprigs of fresh dill.  next time i might use a different kind of wood (alder, perhaps) just to see how that changes the flavor, but overall it was pretty darn tasty!

This was our introductory recipe for using cedar planks to grill salmon.  The marinade was simple and flavorful, but allowed the cedar and salmon flavors to come through so you really get a true idea of why people use cedar planks to cook on.  Personally we missed the char and the crispy bits direct grilling provides, but enjoyed trying a new technique

What a great recipe!  I made this almost true to the recipe other than I minced two cloves of garlic (rather than measuring by teaspoon) and added an entire bunch of green onions (rather than measuring 1/2 cup).  I added most of the marinated onions to the top of the salmon when planking.  Definitely will make again!!

Made it somewhat as written.  I did not have all the oils listed or vinegars and used canola, balsamic & others instead and it came out great.  I was surprised at how it turned out.  Very taste.  Plan to use on other fish.

I prepared this recipe exactly as listed and it was perhaps the best salmon I have ever had and all 4+ pounds were completely devoured by my family. It was so good that I thought it could have qualified to be from a high end restaurant. The cedar planks gave it that little extra smoky flavor that just made this over the top awesome!

I rarely eat fish at home as I never knew how to cook it. I don’t like fish to taste “fishy”.  My husband will only eat fried fish. However, we are trying to be more health conscious and I wanted to start eating salmon weekly.  This recipe is absolutely delicious!  Very easy to prepare and cook. My husband hasvraved over it and he went back for seconds.

So many positive reviews ...... .i don’t understand. The marinade sounded great but flavor just didn’t come through for me. All I could taste was the cedar, which we like,  as that is our usual way of cooking salmon on the grill. Very disappointing recipe. May try it again without the cedar in the oven.

Excellent! Made a few tweaks. Didn't have Rice Vinegar so used White Wine Vinegar. Also used Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil. Last 5 minutes on the grill, brushed on top a mixture of Brown Sugar, Whisky and Soy Sauce. Delicious!!

Loved it and so did jhusband.  Will make it over and over.  W thought the plank was over priced.  I read where you can make your own from cedar from a home supply store, as long as you know what your buying.  I might give that a try

I did not have the cedar planks nor did I grill it.  I marinated the salmon as described and placed it on aluminum foil and on my instant pot rack. I added one cup of water and pressure cooked it on high for 3 minutes and  slow released.  It was delicious!!

Your local building supply probably has western white cedar fence boards for about $3 for a 7 footer.  Make sure it is untreated and pick one with the fewest knots.  You can saw them to the length you need for a lot less than the cost of precut boards.

Another Awesome and Versitile recipe! Followed recipe except after pulling off griill I put alittle more cracked black pepper and covered with brown sugar, I then broiled for 5 minutes until the brown sugar bubbled and began running down the sides. Awesome over a bed of rice with grilled asparagus or as street tacos.

I made this on my smokeless indoor grill, covering with non-stick aluminum foil. We have family members that cannot eat onions so I omitted them. Instead of vegetable oil I used Spectrum unrefined peanut oil and it imparted an incredible Asian flavor! Served on a bed of Lundberg's Wild Blend rice. Yummmy!!!

This dish was fantastic!  I didn’t use the cedar plank but instead a salt block.  This did make it a little on the salty side but still wonderful.  My 20 year old has never eaten salmon by looks alone.  After smelling it cook he decided to try it and after devouring the entire thing said he would definitely ate it again.

I'll be the first to say I'm not a huge fan of Salmon.  But this was great! I followed the recipe, with the exception of Cedar wraps (which worked out nicely) instead of planks.  Between the marinade and the cedar's flavor being imparted onto the Salmon, it had really good flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I had this with rice pilaf and a Chinese cabbage salad.

I did cut it in half as I was making it for two. But it's definitely a keeper. I did boil down the marinade and topped wit a little sesame seed and served the marinade and rice..

This was delicious! My wife and I made it this evening and really enjoyed it. I'd watch the salmon carefully though, as I think 20 minutes is a bit too long unless you're cooking a Tyee! I'd definitely make this again. Thanks!

This has become my go to recipe for salmon, every time! I have made it in the oven @ 350’ with excellent results. I have also tinkered and made ingredient changes along the way and it’s held up in flavour. Things I have tried: grating mandarinski.

I've learned over the years, that Sockeye is an acquired taste.  Farm raised Atlantic Salmon is more fatty, and therefore,  easier to cook and retain moisture.  Sockeye is tricky, and requires almost constant attention at the end to make sure you don't over cook it and dry it out.  This is a very good recipe.

Wow.  What a hit.  Several comments that it was the best salmon they've ever had.  Pretty much followed the recipe as written.  I did the ingredient mixing in a separate bowl, whisked it together and poured over the salmon.  Next time I'll be sure to add the green onions instead of forgetting them on the counter.  Doh!
Soaked the planks for about 8 hours but still needed an emergency glass of water to put out them out when they caught fire.
I had a smaller BBQ I guess as only two of the planks fit inside comfortably which was perfect for the big slab of Costco salmon filet.
A definite new favourite!

Not bad, but you need some other components.  Red pepper flakes for heat, brown sugar for sweetness, and some lemon for acidity.  Too "one note".

I have made it twice now with rave reviews from my family and friends.  The first time I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  The second time I added more minced garlic, green onions and sesame oil.  Both were great.  The cedar plank made all the difference because it kept the salmon so moist and flavorful.  This recipe is a winner!

The family loved it. I forgot the vegetable oil so I think it was more intense. Used shallots instead of green onions, and was really generous with the ginger and garlic.  Plus I cooked it skin on (I can be a sloppy recipe reader!). I'm trying it again tonight (sans veg oil and sans skin) to see if I can repeat the magic! Served with broccoli and sweet rice (which is sticky). Did it in the oven 425 for about 15 minutes (but I'm not sure - I just watched the fish and tried not to over cook).

My husband likes to fish and salmon is his number one catch, so I am always looking for new ways to cook it. I have made this a few times now and it gets rave reviews. I did not change anything in the recipe, however I did cook it on a plank both in the BBQ and twice in the oven. The BBQ gives it a nice smokey flavour but the oven version was just as good!  In the oven I cooked at 350 for about 25 minutes and last time I left the skin on with no change in the flavour.   I will keep this in my rotation of salmon recipes.

I tried this over the weekend and everyone liked it.  We eat salmon often and like to try different recipes.   This will stay on the list.   I used my Thermapen and pulled it off at 120 degrees internal.  It was perfect.

Absolutely delicious. I've made this several times. I usually use steelhead trout instead of salmon, because my hubby prefers its milder taste. If you want to hit it even further out of the park, cook it on your smoker if you have one.

This recipe was awesome. I made a few changes. I subbed Citrus infused olive oil for regular oil  and honey balsamic vinegar for the rice vinegar. I didn't have fresh ginger so I rubbed the salmon with ground  ginger before adding the marinade. Also used minced dried onion since I didn't have green onion. Maintained a 350 grill and it turned out moist and yummy!  And I soaked the Plano for about 4 hours and marinated the salmon for. 1 1/2 hours.

Great way to cook salmon!  I've done cedar planked salmon before, but never with a marinade like this -- it's a great combo, and very easy!  Family loved it.

I come from a ranching family in south-central Texas, so our grill is primarily used for steaks, ribs and such. For us, "seafood" is usually corn meal breaded catfish, bass or perch, and occasionally frog legs, that we catch out of stock tanks or ponds that the cattle drink from, so I was really going out on a limb here! I followed the marinade recipe exactly, and soaked an almost three pound side of salmon for about two hours. I had soaked the planks for about six hours. I fired up the grill and cooked the salmon over medium high heat, once the planks started smoking, until the salmon felt firm at the center, probably ten minutes. I served the salmon over Herbs d'Provence rice (an allrecipes.com  recipe), and topped it with a Beurre Nantais, which is a Beurre Blanc with capers, cream and lemon. It was fantastic! The friends I cooked this for are big salmon eaters, to the point that they both always order salmon at steakhouses, even places like Ruth's Chris, so I was searching for something special, when I found this recipe! They both said that it was the best salmon they had ever eaten, and raved over the marinade! I wouldn't recommend any changes in the recipe, it's perfect! I can't wait to "fish up" my ol' grill again!

Definitely will make again.  Usually I tend to undercook salmon so as not to have it dried out but this was cooked through and very moist.  Marinade was very tasty.

Completely foul proof! Made this while camping for 10. Didnt end up using the cedar planks. Popped all ingredients together in a large ziplock, marinated for 15 mins, wrapped in foil and bbq. Got rave reviews and even the kids loved it!

Wonderful! Followed the recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing! I used wild caught sockeye salmon and it wasn't very "fishy" in taste. My mother who hates fish had a bite and wound up having 2 filets! Highly recommend this recipe!

Definitely a keeper!  Excellent cedar plank salmon recipe.  I did not have rice wine vinegar, so I substituted apple cider vinegar, and it was fabulous.  Hubby loved this one too!  Thank you for sharing this one! It's a winner!

Best recipe I have used for my cedar plank salmon.  You expect the cedar plank to burn that's the point to add a bit of smoky flavor.  I usually cover the salmon with orange or lemon slices while cooking keeps the moisture in and adds great flavor.  Also a Alaska resident with far too much salmon to eat but this recipe makes it amazing.

I use this site a great deal but have never taken the time to rate or comment. But after cooking this salmon I had to! Absolutely delicious. The marinade is just ridiculously good. I followed the recipe and directions verbatim. Some of the best fish I have ever eaten. Thanks for the treat!

Ok, I'll admit I had to make adjustments based on what I had. I hate reading reviews where someone changed the recipe and then had complaints, but this is not that. The salmon was really delicious, I can't imagine how it could be better if I'd had all the ingredients! So, here it is:  I had no pineapple juice, but otherwise followed recipe except adding some cayenne pepper after tasting the marinade, let salmon sit in marinade 30-45 min. , turning several times to fully coat. We grilled on cedar planks for about 20 min. and it was scrumptious! Every crumb devoured! Served with grilled zucchini and fennel, and saffron rice. Loved it! Thanks so much for recipe!

We aren't crazy bout this--- I thought the marinade had too much going on with the green onions, ginger, soy, sesame, etc.  I did like the cooking technique though.  if we try this again, I think I'll simplify the marinade a bit.

This was seriously AMAZING! I've never done a cedar planked anything but this was really easy and just the perfect amount of added flavor to the salmon. It definitely helps that I DIDNT overcook the salmon, it was still juicy and just started to flake when I took it off the grill.   I loved the marinade. 
i doubled the marinade recipe and when the fish was finished  marinatingI used the same dish to roast potatoes in with the marinade. Maybe not the most food safe but I figured at 400 degrees in the oven for nugget potatoes for 40 mins it was ok. And saved me a dish. Totally recommend this recipe!

So delicious and easy. I boiled the leftover marinade in a saucepan while cooking the salmon on the grill with the cedar plank. Served the sauce over the salmon and steamed asparagus. Will make again for sure!

I only marinated this for 15 minutes because I was pressed for time, and although it came out good, I suspect it would have been much better if it had marinated longer.

This is absolutely fantastic!  I did not have cedar planks. I just cut off the skin and grilled on both sides. My 16 month old daughter even loves it.

Best cedar plank salmon recipe I've come across.  Looks and tastes amazing. I don't even like salmon and I had two helpings.  I paired it with coconut rice and grilled zucchini.

Excellent flavor. Our cedar plank caught on fire, only soaked for three hours. Will try longer next time. A little too salty for my taste so I will reduce soy sauce next time. My husband loves salt though, and he thought it was excellent. Delicious! Only took about 12-13 min to grill for thin salmon.

I can never find wild caught fresh salmon locally so I usually buy frozen from Sam's Club or Costco. They are frozen in single serving sizes and have the skin on. I usually just thaw them and blot the water off them and proceed with the recipe without removing the skin. I put them on the plank skin side down. Works perfectly. Other than that I follow the recipe as directed using a charcoal grill and have never been disappointed. I have also tried this with ground ginger and granulated garlic with great success when I don't have fresh on hand. I love the slight smokiness the cedar plank gives the salmon. Absolutely delicious!

Made this for a small dinner party a couple of weeks ago & it was scrumptious, as written.  Served it with roasted potatoes and roasted asparagus.  Making it again this weekend for casual dinner with friends & will serve with roasted ginger carrots & a mandarin orange salad!  This will make salmon-eaters out of even the pickiest guests/family members!!

This was so close to being perfect!! I made it as directed, tasted the marinade before putting the salmon in it, and it definitely needed some sweetness, as some reviewers also noted. So I added about 1/3 cup of Mirin and it worked perfectly! It was a great addition to my BBQ!

This was fantastic!  My sister tried it as well and loved it.  I didn't have any rice vinegar, so I substituted champange vinegar.  Not something I would necessarily choose to do on purpose, but it still was great. I also used olive oil.  Even with those two changes I would make this  again in a heartbeat!

Made this the other day and it  was soo good. We also lightly sprinkled some brown sugar on top before we added it to the smoking plank.   I used sockeye salmon and it cooked much faster  at about 7 minutes .  I soaked plank for  a couple of hours. Perfect!

I used the marinade from this recipe but cooked in the oven at 375 degrees. Placed fillets in aluminum foil, covered with extra marinade from soaking, and sealed. Placed sealed salmon in the glass dish, and baked 35 minutes. While baking, the whole house smelled heavenly! The salmon turned out very moist.  I served it with rice and sprinkled it with fresh mint. YUM!  I look forward to making this again!

This is the best grilled salmon I have every made!! This was my first time trying cedar plank salmon. I changed nothing about the recipe but have a few notes. I used low sodium soy sauce and spooned as much marinade as I could on top of the fish after it was placed on the planks. For my 3 burner mid-sized Weber grill, I used medium-high indirect heat by turning off the middle burner (with the two lateral burners set to medium-high) and placing the plank(s) over the middle burner resulting in a constant temperature of 350. The salmon was perfect in 30 minutes. Cooking this way is very forgiving and the salmon will stay very moist even if slightly overcooked. Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

I made this and it was really delicious. I made a few adjustments to the recipe. I used canola oil instead of the vegetable oil and added about 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar.  In Korean cuisine they usually add something for sweetness to balance the saltiness of soy sauce and balance the sour flavor of the vinegar.  And, I left the skin on the salmon. I just placed the salmon on the cedar plank skin side down. Otherwise, I highly recommend this recipe.

Sockeye salmon works best with this recipe! There are 3 types of salmon that people usually find in their average grocery store, but they greatly differ in taste and fat content. Sockeye is generally the most flavorful and rich.

Just made this with mashies and green beans! So yummy. I saved the marinade and added some water on high on the stove for about a minute then simmered. Perfect sauce for even more great flavor. I used safflower oil and tamari...I will make this again, oh and my kids loved it.

We've had this recipe twice now, and it is fantastic.  The soy marinade blends perfectly with the smoky flavor from the plank.  Very quick and easy to prepare.  It's so good, my 12 year old now requests this.

Mine didn't last long enough to take a picture. By FAR the best Salmon I've ever cooked. I guess the plank insulates the fish while it's cooking,but mine came out well done,and still had plenty of moisture left in it. Excellent recipe !!

I have tried scores of recipes for salmon, yet I decided to try one more. Wow, did I hit the jackpot. I made it just as it was written and it was to die for good. My adult daughter, who feels nauseous at the very smell of fish tried a bite and told me that we could make her a whole piece next time. I highly praise this recipe. If you don't like most fish, at least try this recipe. The smokey, wonderful taste will make you a believer.

We are Seattle Wild Caught Salmon Snobs and give this FIVE STARS! Loved how easy it was to prepare and it tasted amazing! Juicey and smokey :) We used low-sodium soy sauce so it wasn't too salty. Also didn't have green onion so I used sweet white onion.

I made this recipe for the the family this past weekend. Never tried cedar planks on the grill. It is now my all time favorite.

This recipe was so good I want to know if anyone has tried it on steak or chicken?

This is our go to recipe now for salmon.  I've made this for guests several times and even folks who don't normally like fish rave about it!

My daughter (who is 11) jumps up and down with glee every time she hears this is what's for dinner.

This was outstanding! Salmon was not even one of my favorite fish - it is now! Can't wait to make it again. I soaked the planks about an hour and 15 minutes and had no problem with catching fire over charcoal. Marinated fish about an hour and 15 minutes (sans sesame oil - that stuff is pricey) and it was great but will still try to go longer next time. Do yourself a huge favor and make this.

Seriously, you need to make this dish. Make sure you have the fish market remove the skin and be sure to put the wood planks on the grill before adding fish. 

I like to put a little more garlic and a little more ginger in the marinade. I also add grilled green onion for garnish

5/5 easy & 5+/5 delicious!  We usually like our tuna raw or seared, but decided to follow the directions exactly because we were feeding a big group for Easter.  Even though it was cooked, it was awesome! Will def make this again, and won't change a thing next time either, although going a little heavy on garlic and ginger is never bad...

This is GREAT! When doing the plank with salmon have always done it with dill, garlic and maple syrup but this is way better and in a pinch a very good store bought teriyaki sauce like Soy Vay will taste very good also. Get a plank, get some salmon and use this recipe and you will wish for more!

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this superb recipe....did I mention thank you?
I'm not much of a fish/salmon lover but my husband is so I made the sacrifice & cooked this recipe.
I'm now a salmon lover and want to grill everything on cedar planks.
I was told to "put this one on the menu," meaning that I have approval to make this weekly/biweekly.
Lol, I smelled like a campfire for the rest of the day.

I've had a lot of good salmon dishes, but preparing it on a cedar plank makes a HUGE difference!  The fish is moist and tender and has a great flavor!  Don't know if I can go back to salmon baked in an oven again now....

I am not a big salmon fan, nor do I favor ginger. However, this recipe was so tasty, and very simple. I really think the ginger added (in a subtle way) so much to the flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, using low sodium soy sauce. My husband, who can be picky, loved it, too.

Had it tonight. Wonderful!  Being on a heathy kick I substituted Coconut oil for the vegetable oil, Coconut aminos (which you can get at a health food grocery store) for the soy sauce, and brushed olive oil on the wood before putting the salmon on. Make sure the wood is soaked for at least 24 hours, because I have had the wood burn before when it's not soaked enough.  When it's really soaked, it smokes a lot. Yum! Also start checking it at 15 mins. so you don't overcook and burn it. My husband really liked it and he doesn't like salmon too much. I and my son loved it and he said it was a keeper! Next time I think I'll add some mushrooms, green onions, and sundried tomatoes on top while cooking. This will be cooked many times. Thanks so much!

I love cedar plank salmon.  My tips:  don't soak the wood, it will smoke more dry.  If you are really brave, leave the skin on and cook it on the plank, them right before its done, take it off and crisp the skin directly on the grates.  Also, make sure you use good salmon, i'm not a fan of atlantic farmed salmon (weird texture, fishy flavor) or pink salmon.  make sure you use some wild caught king or coho to really get the most out of it.  Spendy, but well worth it.  if you find yourself not liking salmon my guess is you haven't had fresh wild caught King or Coho salmon!

This Cedar Planked Salmon is a keeper. I have made it several times and usually add double the fresh ginger! I have also made with fresh rainbow trout fillets, just as good! Highly Rcommended!

I frequently prepare salmon grilled on a cedar plank.  I was looking for some new marinade options when I came across this recipe and it sounded delicious.  I prepared exactly as written, and unfortunately found that it lacked the flavor I was looking for.

Excellent - I took another reviewers advice and reduced the amount of soy sauce to around 1/6 a cup.  The flavors were fantastic with a very light smoke taste.  We ate the leftovers the next day and they were almost as good as the first time.  Highly recommend.

My husband said "MMM - this tastes expensive" which is very much a compliment.  I didn't have sesame seed oil so added a tablespoon of roasted sesame seeds and used chopped purple onion instead of green onions and a little cilantro.

There seemed to be a fine line between the salmon being undercooked and the planks catching fire.  I soaked them for 6 hours, and yet they burst into flames after 10 minutes on the bbq. Next time, will watch them closely and will have a glass of water nearby.

Fantastic recipe. Soaked the planks for almost 24 hours, baked them at 350 for 10 minutes, then added the salmon for 25 minutes. Rave reviews from family and friends.

Awesome! I forgot the sesame oil, but it was still fantastic anyway. I soaked my plank for 6 hours and my salmon only needed about 12 minutes on the grill.

Ohmygosh this was so good! I used peanut oil for the vegetable oil, doubled the garlic (because I love it) and added a little crushed red pepper for some spice. Soaked my plank for two hours and it did catch on fire towards the end, but it made for a nice crispy glaze on the fish. Served with broccoli and carrot fried rice. We could not get enough!

We have made this several times and love it! We have used different types of minced onion and used ginger powder instead of fresh and it still was great. We don't care for sweet coatings on salmon, so this is perfect it is salty and savory.

Great recipe! We live in alaska and have had all kinds of delicious fish. This is a great recipe if you have picky eaters! The fresher the fish the better! But I understand not everyone is able to have it fresh like we do. Marinate fish for at VERY least 15 min.. Really 30-1hr works best! Easy for this novice cook! Good luck!

Oh my! I eat a LOT of salmon and have made it numerous ways but I'm always needing to vary the recipes to keep from getting bored. I've made other cedar plank salmon recipes before as well. HOWEVER - this is THE best Salmon recipe I have ever had! I was skeptical adding the Sesame oil, I didn't think the marinade smelled good but oh I was so thrilled with the taste. This is company worthy also. Just fantastic as written.

This is the best salmon I have ever had! I followed the recipe exactly the first time, it was wonderful. The second time I baked it, and it was still wonderful. I do prefer it on the plank though, it gives it that perfect smoked flavor. I will be making this again and again! Thank you for sharing!

What can I say but WOW, this was amazing! Made it without ginger cause I didn't have any but it is still mouth-watering. Soaked cedar planks in salt water 2 hours and followed the directions on planks package to put on hot grill and turn every 2 minutes till each side heated twice to control warping. Turned off fire and covered for the last 2 minutes and it was perfect. Also put the skin on top of fish till turned off fire then removed it which I feel kept it from drying out. My dogs loved sharing the skin!

Super easy and so good!  I made this when we had friends over and everyone loved it.  Changes I made were: I always use olive oil, instead of vegetable oil; I used red wine vinegar b/c that's what I had and also added red pepper flakes.  I poured it all on the salmon and massaged the oil mixture in.  I can't speak to the grilling process since my boyfriend did it but it was delicious!!

I prepared this last night out on the deck (in-between thunder showers).  I used Scottish salmon and the fish was succulent with incredible flavors – I had no idea this slightly different way of BBQing could make such a remarkable difference.

Amazing!  Hubby and teenage daughter raved. It was so moist and flavorful.  The only change I made was to add a large squirt of honey to the marinade.

Great marinade.  I substituted out the sesame oil because I didn't have any and added a little extra garlic.  Used reduced sodium soy sauce.  Used a little of the marinade as a sauce by reducing it and adding a little sriracha for heat.  Delicious.

I have prepared grilled salmon on a cedar plank many times in the past and was in search of a new marinade.  I thought this recipe was okay - it did not really penetrate throughout the salmon.  I used fresh salmon and marinated for over an hour.

I make salmon once a week and so I am always looking for new ways to prepare it. I'd been wanting to try using a cedar plank and this was the way to go. The plank provided a nice light smoky flavour as well as a sweetness I was not expecting. The only change I made was using about 3 times the amount of garlic - we love garlic. Great recipe.

I just made this for my dad's birthday dinner. Everyone loved it! I cut the soy sauce to 3 tablespoons to reduce the saltiness and added in 4 tablespoons honey and 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, as I didn't have sesame seed oil on hand. Had quinoa and salad as sides.

Outstanding. Moist with a nice light smokey flavor. We grilled on the gas grill with a beautiful piece of FRESH salmon with the skin off.  We served it on the plank at the table. Nice presentation. I got my planks from Amazon.

Loved it.  My husband isn't the "Grillmaster"  But he hit a home run with this.  We took a chance and served to company, and they raved. Careful on cook time.  We only cooked for 20 minutes - and it was perfect.  I like it because not alot of marinade time Just 30 minutes!  yay!  It's going under "fav recipies"  !

My husband made this on Christmas Day and everyone loved it!  It even re-heats well.  Of course my sister ate it cold the next morning for breakfast, too.  The salmon remains very moist and melts in your mouth.  If you like salmon, you'll love this recipe!

Loved it! I make it when we want to have high restaurant quality meals (like today...Christmas!). I've used alder planks as well as cedar planks (found at my local natural food stores near meat counter). I also used apple cider vinegar in place of rice vinegar since I didn't have any rice vinegar. It's a winner every single time (even with my small kiddos).

I made this, my first time using cedar planks.. my husband being sort of a picky fish eater, ate it all! I've never seen him or my 4 year old eat like that before, it is amazing! I've shared this recipe with all of my family and friends that like salmon! AMAZING

Amazing!  My wife loves salmon and she only likes it one way.  I snuck this recipe in on the last batch I made for her and she was stunned and so was I.  Excellent paired with steamed clams.  I am originally from Md so of course I added Old Bay to everything!

Excellent!  Followed the recipe, precisely (which is a little unusual for me!) and it couldn't have been more delicious.  The only difference was that I soaked the cedar plank for four hours, since that was what was recommended on the planks I bought.  We also,brushed a little oil on the plank, since the planks suggested that.  I only wish I made more!

Wife loved it. The grocery store was out of cedar planks so i used a few applewood chips on the weber with the salmon on a foil tray. Served with roasted asparagus and mushrooms and jasmine rice. Beautiful. Definitely going to do this one again. I think the same recipe with chicken breasts would be great.

I am not a huge fan of salmon, but my husband is.  This recipe is absolutely fantastic.  Best salmon I've ever had.  I followed the recipe as printed and it was great.  The cedar plank really made a difference and I've used with with different recipes now and love the subtle smoke flavor.

This is now my favorite way to cook salmon - it was SOOOO tasty. I'm not a big onion fan, so I left them out and it was still a fantastic dish.

Outstanding recipe! The salmon had a tremendous flavor.  Paired with rice and asparagus this would have been a $25 plate at a restaurant.  We will definitely bank this on the regular rotation.

This is AMAZING! Only substitution - I didn't have fresh ginger root so I used ground ginger.  I soaked the boards 2+ hours but needed a spray bottle when the corners caught on fire. Still - very little effort for something that is gourmet dinner quality.

This is so darn easy, and so darn good.  My picky 17 year old daughter BEGS for me to make this again.  The flavor is quite simply amazing.  The first time we made it on a charcoal grill, and tonight we are making it on the gas grill - can't wait!!
