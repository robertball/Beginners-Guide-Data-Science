Turned out fantastic - followed it to a T, and could not have been more pleased with the outcome. Very easy to make and prepare side dishes while the chicken simmers. The whole family loved it, and the leftovers are delicious - I might even try to make ahead and freeze.  I love that this is low carb!

This recipe was amazing, very simple to make, and a great balance of flavors. I didn't change the recipe at all.Even my picky children asked me to make it again. The next tie I make it I might try piercing the meat to get a little more flavor.

Excellent! Just like my neighbor used to make. I did add an additional cup and a half water and used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon (did not have a stick). Served with steamed white rice and broccoli, both drizzled with the simmering sauce. My 2 1/2 year old loved it!

This was my first attempt making chicken adobo and it turned out wonderfully.  I really appreciate how easy it was to make and with so few ingredients(pantry staples, no less!).  I didn't have a cinnamin stick so I used some of the ground stuff.  I would recommend this recipe to a beginner or someone like me who has never made adobo before.  Thanks so much Margo!

I tried this last night. The flavor is awesome but the sauce was a bit watery. I am going to add some cornstarch & water in order to make it a  bit more gravy like & stick. Next time I make this I will make it with boneless chicken breasts b/c the meat I got off of the the thighs & drumsticks wasn't very filling for me. Great flavor though

I personally thought it had a bit too much vinegar. I think it would be better in I cut out some of it.

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!  A wonderful combination of flavors to tickle the taste buds of even the most finicky eaters.  Easy to make, and  although I didn't quite have a full cup of soy sauce on-hand, the chicken tasted out of this world.  I did pierce the meat prior to browning and again while it was resting so it would absorb the maximum sauce in the slow cooker.  Honestly, this is such a crowd pleaser!  Thanks so much, Margo!

I made this as per the recipe and added it to my regular rotation.  Simple, easy, tasty.  Easy to adjust for personal preference eg. add heat, reduce salt

It was fantastic as written, except I substituted two shallots for half an onion as I halved the recipe.  My hubby said it was the best chicken he ever had, and this coming from someone who never remarks on his food!

We really liked it! We used cubed chicken breast,  and I changed the servings to two. Didn't have any cinnamon sticks so used 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon.  Was really good, and will definitely make again!

Very good!  Don't be put off by the strong vinegar smell while it's cooking - this isn't anywhere near as tart as the smell suggests.  If you're afraid of it, you can always add a little cinnamon for a sweeter flavor.

This is a great recipe! After making it 3 or 4 times, I made the following mods: Used boneless/skinless thighs; added some diced carrot to try and take a little of the bitterness of the vinegar away; used half soy, half teriyaki instead of all soy; added a sprinkle of sugar. This is going in the regular rotation. While my version probably isn't technically adobo, it is really delicious served over sticky rice.

I made this in the slow cooker so the chicken was very moist and tender.  We weren't crazy about the flavor of this though.  I've never made adobo before so nothing to really compare it to.

Each time I made a form of chicken adobo mine would come out too sour or too salty. This recipe was just right. I did tweak the recipe to make less. Also I used skinless boneless chicken breast. I was afraid it would have become a little sour so i did put more water, but I don't think that was needed. Although this recipe does not taste close to my moms, I find it pretty decent.

We loved it, my wife was not liking the vinegar smell but when she ate it she loved it, lots of tang from the vinegar, I added 1/4 cup of honey and that made it less bitter but not sweet,  served over white rice it was an enjoyable meal to be made again.

Made this last night, it was absolutely delish.  So easy to make.  The only change I made was that I added some smoked Adobo sauce and will add a little more next time.  Definitely will make it again.

Fantastic and easy recipe! I made this in the slow cooker and it actually finished within about 3 hours on high. The meat was absolutely falling off the bone and the flavours were delicious. I didn't have apple cider vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar. I also didn't have a cinnamon stick, so I used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. Finally, we were all out of bay leaves. Even with all of those (albeit minor) adjustments, it was absolutely delicious!!

I made it with the ingredients listed, but I cooked it in a slow cooker. The kids like it. The sauce is a little strong with the vinegar. We eat the chicken with rice and just a little bit of sauce. Will probably make again because we kind of like it.
