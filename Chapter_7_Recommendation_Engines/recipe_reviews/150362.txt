So honored to be the first review! These were great! Family really liked these. I did add 1 large garlic clove to the boiling potatoes and ran that through a ricer. After the mashed potato mixture had cooled I also added some shredded cheddar cheese and eliminated the extra egg yolk to the mix (didnt think it needed it). Floured egged and breaded these babies and cooked until golden on both sides. Very tasty. I made 8 large croquetts. This recipe would be great with different cheeses. Will definately make again! One last note loved the spinach addition to this recipe. A great way to incorporate veggies!

I have been wanting to make croquettes for a really long time! Even though this didn't work out for me I'll be making more (variations) soon. Everyone who ate these tonight liked them except me. The insides were too mushy like mashed potatoes. I certainly found that the parmesan and spinach helped thicken but not enough. I had even added a little canned corn more (very well squeezed dry) spinach than called for minced onions and garlic! The garlic smelled awesome in it. I even had put the on-a-sheet-to-cool-potatoes in a preheated oven (to 250C then turned off) for a good 20 minutes to dry the potatoes as much as I could before cooling them down. Maybe its supposed to be a little mushy on the inside though. (??) Also I found the smaller I made the balls the better they fried up. I used tongs rather than a slotted spoon.

This recipe turned out well. Like a previous comment said the consistency was a bit mushier than the typical croquette but it was still good. I doubled the amount of spinach that the recipe called for in a second batch that I made and those turned out slightly firmer.

Excellent I made it and it turns out to be good. I had to use olive oil instead of peanut oil and it still didn't ruin the work. I recommend to dry out the spinach if not it will be too soggy. I made that mistake before.

I began with leftover garlic mashed potatoes and pan fried but followed the rest of the recipe. We really enjoyed these with a sweet chili dipping sauce.

I followed the recipe with one substitution - I used Swiss cheese that is what I had but it was a nice aged hard and dryish cheese. I shaped them and floured them and popped them on a parchment lined baking sheet for about an hour of refrigeration. Then I used the egg wash and the final coating of bread crumbs and they held their shape perfectly though I was gentle with them.
