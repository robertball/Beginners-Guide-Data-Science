Fabulous stew. I would recommend a few tweaks: The listed amount of bell peppers is a bit much.   Half the amount of bell peppers is more than enough. I'd also do half red, half yellow bell peppers for added color. As well, I'd recommend a fish that is more firm/less flaky than tilapia.  I used cod and it turned out great. Finally, a pinch of chili flakes for an extra bit of zing.

This recipe was excellent. It was relatively easy to make and didn't take much time. I used more than the recommended lime which I would suggest. This fish stew could have as easily passed as a Thai recipe. If you like Thai food try this dish. I am also going to make this again substituting the fish with shrimp or chicken.

I'm from Brazil, and this is one of my fave dishes. I personally don't use garlic on fishes... It kind of is a bit "too much". Also, that amount of pepper is used by Northern people more than at other parts of the country., but if you like it... :)

This is more like 4.5 stars. I have a local place here that does this style cooking in a muqueca (clay pot) I don't have a clay pot but still wanted to make it and found this recipe to closest to what my restaurant does. I made this with mahi. It held up very well in the pot. I would suggest using it since other fish may flake easy. I didn't have actual cumin but added a dash of adobo which does. I also added chopped green onion for more color. I only used 1 red bell pepper. I wouldn't think you would need more then 2 peppers cause they tended to take away from the coconut milk flavor. I served it over some basmati rice and garlic bread for dipping and we were happy!

Yum! My recommended changes are: replace tilapia with cod, esp. dried cod that's been soaked overnight beforehand; add 1 large potato and 1 large tomato; reduce the green peppers by 2-3; and squeezing lime juice onto it at the end or just before serving.

YUM! I had a nasty cold and a lot of haddock on hand and I wanted a spicy fish stew recipe to help clear my head. This was perfect! I used haddock for the fish,  and I didn't have any bell peppers, so I used zucchini. The citrusy flavor is wonderful and along with a few added dashes of hot sauce it really helped my cold. I ate two bowls full! I will definitely make more of this.

This was great.  I didn't have coconut milk so I used skim milk plus about a Tablespoon of sugar.  It's probably not the same as coconut milk, but still yummy.

I loved this! I used 13oz of tomatoes and coconut milk because that is what I had on hand and only one yellow bell pepper (not a fan), and it was still perfect! I'll definitely being using this regularly, it was easy to make and cheap.

My family loves this stew.  It is a different and delicious way to enjoy tilapia which we eat quite a lot of.  The only thing I changed was that I left out the peppers as we don't really like them.

Delicious AS WRITTEN! Love the mild flavor of the tilapia and added four fillets whole and they broke up into nice chunks on their own. Also, used a half of a large yellow onion and a bag of Trader Joe's frozen diced mixed peppers (yellow, red & green)! Wish I had leftovers!

Wonderful! Has a Thai flavor. I customized it a bit. I used a combo of several fish; leeks instead of onions; added broccoli and zuccini (we like more veggies); used fresh tomatoes instead of canned; and used a small 12-ounce can of coconut milk. It was great! Next time, I'll add red pepper flakes to make it a bit spicier, and will also add  more veggies to increase its health quotient. I bet it will also be great with other seafood. Very easy to make, hard to go wrong, and easily customizable.

This is an AMAZING recipe.  So easy to make and to tweek to your desires.  I did use lite coconut milk, which was great.  I loved the taste of the the canned tomatoes, I think they added a bit of bite which I love. I scaled the recipe to 4, instead of 6 because I only had 1 lb. of fish on hand.  In the marinade I used extra lime juice because I love citrus and it was great.  I also marinated for about 24 hours because in the former reviews that seems to make a difference.  I also added the marinade to the soup.  I used 1/2 of green, yellow, and orange peppers (my market had a sale and I take advantage of those.)  Once I added the cilantro it all came together. YUM, YUM, YUM.  It was a bit sweet so I added so salt and WOW.  This is so fantastic.  Thank you BellevueMama for posting this.  :)

Great recipe. I tweaked a little. I added more paprika & cumin, some fresh ginger & instead of canned tomatoes, i put in about 5 fresh tomatoes. Delish!

Marinating fish is a must (24hrs). Next time I'll use heartier fish (cod). Added potatoes, tomatoes, zucchini(green & yellow), poblanos & red pepper flakes.  FAMILY LOVED!

A Lovely lovely dish. I did cut back the bell peppers by half and increased the garlic by double...but I always increase garlic. I also added chili pepper flakes and I think that kick is really needed, however I give you 5 stars for even the idea and base for this dish. Loved it!!! Thanks!

Yum, yum, yum!  The flavor was so good; very Thai-like!  Hubby would prefer it a little spicier, but it's easy enough to add a little Thai chili sauce when it's served.  

I only used 1-1/4 red bell pepper, and that was plenty.  I thought the tilapia was fine; it did break up when cooking, but that's okay.  This would be great with chicken or shrimp also.  

The colors were so pretty in this dish, the presentation was beautiful!  I served with tortillas this time because I didn't know how juicy it would be, but will use rice next time.

Thanks for a great, easy, wonderful recipe!

This recipe was simple and delicious.  I used Redfish which is thick and difficult to work with but, it was worth it.  The flavor of this recipe was like a Middle Eastern Korma.

Wonderful, wonderful and no fishy taste!  The first time I made this as is and it was very good.  The second time I adjusted it a little to our tastes which was to use cod rather than tilapia, only one large red bell pepper and one large onion.  It came out absolutely delicious!  It's a keeper.  Thanks Bell.

This was excellent! Of course I changed it a bit and used one red, one yellow and one orange bell pepper, one sweet onion, one tablespoon of olive oil and light coconut milk. I also used more garlic. I used tilapia and it turned out perfectly. I followed the cooking instructions and layered it all, cooked for 5 minutes and THEN stirred it every 5 minutes for 20 minutes total of cooking time. With my "lighter" changes, the new nutritional information is 242 calories, 9.7 g fat (3.9 sat), 13.4 g carb (2.5 g fiber) and 24.8 g protein (I've been logging everything I eat for well over a year). NEXT TIME I'm adding ginger, cayenne and green curry to make it more Thai!

Very delicious! Used pre-cubed frozen Trader Joe's cod and a bag of Trader Joe's frozen mixed bell peppers which reduced prep time. 
For the second time making it, I didn't have any limes - used lemons which was an OK substitute but not as good as limes.

I was surprised by just how good this turned out. Everyone in my family loved it, including my 20 month old (he had 3 bowls). After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to use only 2 peppers and I think this number is just right. It was a quick weeknight meal.

This was great.  I was doubling the recipe and had only 1 can of coconut milk so had to use 1 can of evaporated milk and it still turned out great.  Next time I will try 1 can of fat free milk to lower the fat.  I also had a smoked paprika that made a great flavor.

only changes I made were less green pepper (didn't have 4 and that seemed like a lot anyway/2 was enough) and I did add some shrimp and clams for a seafood chowder. We like tilapia/I used it as written and did everything in the the crockpot for the day. I was kinda afraid 1TB of cumin would overpower the delicate fish but it did not. I also tossed in a shot (about 2TB) of Sherry!

Excellent and easy to make.  My family loves soups/stews and this hit the spot.  When I made this I had frozen flounder on hand and only 1 bell pepper.  I also used only a tiny pinch of salt and it still came out so delicious.  The flavors work very well together and we love the subtle bite of lime.

Delicious recipe. I only used red and yello peppers and also threw in a couple of packs of frozen crab and it came out very tasty. This will definitely turn into a 'go-to' recipe. For those who are concerned about the amount of fat in the coconut milk, I made this once where I split the coconut milk in half and substituted the 2nd half with almond milk (very light fat free substitute) and it came out just as nice, not as sweet but still a great alternative for those watching their weights :P

This was just plain good.  I was looking for a way to use up some tilapia.  Had a can of coconut milk that I bought by accident (needed CREAM of coconut for Pina Coladas) and the result was actually really good.  I'd make it again - next time I buy the wrong stuff for my Pina Coladas!

I reduced the cumin and only marinated about half an hour.  Flavor was very mild, but I enjoyed it.  Partner did not...totally my fault...was too bland for him.  Next time will use full amount of spices, and marinate one hour.  It's hard to find the heat level we will both enjoy

5 stars positively. This is what I look for in a recipe - inexpensive, ingredients mostly on hand, goes together quickly, a pleasing dish for guests, delicious as is but easily adapted to a multitude of tastes.  I used 2 green and 1 red pepper, two cans of tomatoes and lite coconut milk.  We have lots of halibut so I used it and also put in some shrimp.  I marinated the halibut for 24 hours. Next time I will use slow cooker.  I'd like to try some of the reviewers suggestions but it's delightful as as.  Thanks

Excellent combination.  Made as directed except added only one large red pepper and cooked served over plain white rice.  Definitely will make again!

Did I read it right...that's all the salt??  I added a little less than a teaspoon at the broth stage.  I thought it was just too bland before that.  I also adjusted the bell pepper by half and used a light coconut milk.  I used cod, and must agree with the reviewers who rec a sturdier fish.  Other than this, I thought it was a good dish with lots of flavor.  I can't wait to try authentic moqueca!!!

A very delicious recipe. It also works well with shrimp or chicken instead of fish. I also reduced the onion to one and the bell pepper to one. MMM. So good.

We just had this stew for dinner tonight and I must say it was fabulous...will def add it to my rotation. Ok now for my variations: we love bell peppers but I agree with the other posters 4 seemed to be too much. I used 1 large red pepper and 1/2 green pepper and it bordered on too much...next time will use 1/2 red and 1/2 green. The diced tomatoes & coconut milk only came in 13.5 oz cans so I added 1/2 8 oz can of coconut water. Also I love the sweetness of scallions so I used 1 yellow onion and 6 green scallions. Finally, the seafood I used was Red Snapper, Whiting and shrimp (that's what I had on hand) and they held up perfectly! Next time I think I'll substitute lemongrass for the cumin for a true Thai flare...so glad to have found this one!

I LOVED this recipe!! The only real changes I made was that I used one green and one red pepper instead of the 4. Past that, I followed it exactly, and boy was I surprised! Served over rice, one bowl was deliciously filling. And it's so simple to add or remove things based on your own tastes. Can't wait to make this again!

Boy did I enjoy this!!!! A lot of reviews said this recipe was bland, but you have to season to taste with all recipes. Start with the base and add to it. Tilapia is a great choice especially if you can't stand the fishiness of salmon. I used regular milk instead of coconut milk, but I might try it next time.

I doubled the recipe, using three pounds of whiting filet and adding just over three-quarter pound of 51-60-count -- small/medium -- shrimp (more about the shrimp later).  I also made a couple other changes, both out of necessity and at the suggestion of other reviewers.  I found I had only one 15-ounce (when will recipes start to catch up with the down-sizing of most grocery items?) can of diced tomatoes, and those were with chilies added.  I used only about  half of the called-for green peppers. I also upped the cumin, paprika, lime juice, and garlic by about fifty-percent and marinated the fish for about two hours.  Other than those changes, I followed the recipe fairly closely and am very pleased with the outcome!  Oh ... about those shrimp -- after I had completed the stew and had even put it in the fridge to chill and await my Monday-morning portioning of my daily lunch rations -- I remembered the shrimp!  I ended up sauteeing/steaming them in water with a healthy sprinkle of cumin and black pepper and stirring 'em into the completed stew!    I cannot speak to the authenticity of this stew, but it sure is tasty!  Thanks, Bellevue Mama!

i was leery of this fish and coconut milk combo. but its really yummy.since the recipe was originally made in clay pot used my slow cooker for 4 people so it cooked in less than 2 hr.i loved the texture of the fish and i think that is because it was slow cooked. i did tweak the recips to my own taste. i like heat so added 1tsp ancho & 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. i also used diluted cream of coconut because of the preservatives in the coconut milk.   i added more cilantro.  i ended up cubing potatoes, and loved the flavor of the broth infused in the potato. definitely will make again.

Made this for our evening meal, using the tilapia which held it's shape just fine.  I made a mistake when I reached in the pantry and opened the coconut cream rather than coconut milk, so was sweeter than it should have been (also dumped in a can of chicken stock to try to mitigate the damage).  Used a yellow and a red bell pepper, and I've never enjoyed their taste more.  My husband was not interested in even trying a taste, yet ate a bowl full of it.  With the extra liquid, the stew was soupier, but over rice, we loved it.  Cilantro added to the flavor.  Next time, I will add extra lime juice.

I would give this soup 4.5 stars if I could. :)  I made it for dinner last night and with a few changes it was really great!  I followed what some of the other reviewers said and added a little heat to it with a chopped up chili pepper, and it probably could have benefited from even a little more heat, if you like a nice kick.  I also used two flounder filets (what I had on hand) and a pound of fresh shrimp, rather than all fish, and I have to say that I liked the shrimp much more than the fish, in this stew.  I cut back on the bell pepper because four just seemed like too much, and I only used two, pretty big, orange/green bell peppers.  I also only used one onion, added some leftover bamboo shoots that I had, and some sliced mushrooms.  I used four tomatoes chopped up, to replaced the canned tomato, because I needed to use them up.  Also, the can of coconut milk that I used was only 13.5oz, which was fine, with the liquid from the veggies, this was more than enough.  I let this simmer for about 30 minutes and at the end added a few squeezes of lemon juice (I would have used lime but I used all of my lime for the marinade), a little sea salt and fresh cracked pepper, and let it simmer for another 5 minutes.  Topped with fresh cilantro to serve.  I really loved this and it kind of resembles the Thai soup Tom Kha, which I love, plus it's a pretty healthy, hearty meal!  I will definitely make this again, using only shrimp.  Thanks for a great recipe!  :)

I personally love this recipe.  I only use 1 onion (or 1/2 red and 1/2 white or yellow) also use 2 bell peppers vs the 4 called for. I prefer fresh vegetables over canned so I use fresh tomato instead of canned. I also have tried other fishes with it as well as shrimp. All yummy. My kids don't love it but I do! I wish I could make it more "coconuty" :-)

Looks great! I will definitely try this. Let's keep getting the word out about how great tilapia is; the most eco-friendly fish and tastes great too! If you live in a warm climate you can easily raise your own too.

I am in the process of preparing this and one large onion is too much.  Used 2 peppers not 4. Everything else per directions and there is no way one can of coconut milk covers more than 1/2 of mixture in pot.  Had to add 2 cups of veggie broth. Be prepared and have more on hand if you want all coconut milk broth.

I thought I was all set to make this, but as it turns out I had half of the onions that I needed and none of the peppers.  Still good, and a nice switch from the creamy fish chowder we normally eat!  I'll make it again as written, after a more successful trip to the grocery store.

One of the best Tilapia recipes I tried in a long time. I used smaller can of coconut milk 13.5 oz, larger can of crushed tomatoes 28 oz, 3 stalks of celery cut in to very small pieces, 3 large peppers instead of 4 extra 3 fresh tomatoes cut and marinated fish for all 30 hours ;) oh yes and more salt mmmmmmgood

This was delicious. My entire family enjoyed it - even the ones who "don't eat fish." I did add a little hot spice to it at the end but that is just our preference; this was excellent as written.

Served it over white rice.  I have to say I expected something a little more hearty with the cumin and paprika but as I ate it I liked it more and more.  The only thing I would change is the canned tomatoes.  I thought that really brought the dish down.  So maybe some fresh tomato may be better.  Over all though a nice light soup not the best though.

Wow!  Quick, easy and flavorful.  The spice marinade for the fish was very good and flavored the whole dish.  I am not a fan of bell peppers so I added 1 yellow pepper for color and a zucchini for added vegetable.  I think adding shrimp will round it out a bit more.  Thank you, I will make again.

I made this for a shabbat dinner and 4 people asked me for the recipes. Tonight my friend called to say that she cooked it. Another friend asked me to print it out and send it to him. My only hesitation in giving 5 stars is that I wish it had some more pizazz. I definitely should have bought fresh cilantro to put on top, and maybe some more lime juice to squeeze over. And more black pepper. (Also used 2 green peppers and 2 red for color and did half tilapia, half cod. Otherwise I followed exactly and enjoyed!

Second time I made this and was great.  Served with french baguette baked  bread.  Made a few changes this time.  Used basil, oregano,  garlic can tomatoes as well as one large fresh tomato because only had 14.5  oz can of tomatoes.  Also used spinach instead of cilantro and more salt than recipe recommemded.  I marinated the fish overnight and used red bell peppers.  Can't wait to make it again.

On Friday's during Lent we have meatless dinners. I came across this recipe searching by photo for a FISH SOUP. The photo is what drew me in,it looked exactly like my mom's home made fish soup. I followed the recipe with a few changes, ie: 1 yellow pepper,I added ginger, used basil when cooking and added fresh cilantro when serving. I also used some white wine. To thicken it up a bit I added chunks of butternut squash and 2 small potatoes cubed. 
Because this find was last minute I didn't have time to marinate the fish(I used Whiting). So I made the marinade and poured it over frozen fish then placed it in the oven at low heat for 10mins to quickly thaw it out and absorb the marinade. It turned out great.
We ate it as a stew with garlic bread....the kids loved it and I got a taste of of home.  
Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Interesting flavor profile, really not too fishy.

Tweaked the recipe by:
using 3 green peppers,
doubling the tomatoes,
using half a bunch of cilantro,
and doubling the garlic.

Overall, really good. Needed a bit more salt by my tastes. Using a whole bunch of cilantro would have been overpowering though, even half a bunch is probably too much for some.

We dipped ours with tortilla chips & some cheddar.

Excellent and healthy comfort food. Made the recipe as written except used Swai and cut the pepper down to one large red. My company enjoyed it too. Will make often. Loved it.

This was a great recipe.  Unfortunately Talapia isn't available here in Korea.  We made it once with Cod, once with Salmon and once with Mahi-Mahi.  All three were to die for!  i recommend Salmon if Talapia isn't available.

This turned out really good for us. It was easy to make and made a lot. The only problem for us was that it seemed very rich so a little went a long way.  Still it is a good recipe and a great one for someone who might not like fish very much.

Fabulous! Used whole coconut milk and diced fresh tomatoes, substituted basil for the cilantro and left out the onions and peppers.  Reduced cumin and paprika a bit and left out the ground pepper.  My husband thinks cod would be great instead of tilapia - but the tilapia was good. Served over jasmine rice. Did the whole thing in the crock pot and didn't use any oil.  Marinated the fish 20 minutes, then added the tomatoes, c.milk and basil and slow cooked for a few hours.  Whole c.milk has a lot of fat and calories, so eliminating the sauteing step worked well for me, especially as I kept out the onions and peppers.

Really yummy!  I was looking for a tilapia recipe and happy to find this one since I wanted something a little different.  I was a little nervous about the spice but I guess the coconut milk cuts it because it was not spicy at all.  I used a mix of colored peppers because I had them frozen and it was only about 2.  I also cut the onion to 1.  I served this with jasmine rice and like I said...YUMMY!!!  It's the kind of dish when you taste, you can't wait to eat again...leftovers here I come.  BTW, it will make your house smell great and the smell will linger for hours after.  Thus the desire for leftovers...you may want to make double!!

My husband and I both loved this.  I used 2.5 peppers (red, yellow and orange), and served over brown rice with crusty bread.  SUPER.  I also went ahead and used two cans of 14 oz tomatos and lite coconut milk.  Made it soupier.  Ialso did not use tilapia b/c of past posts saying it was too  flaky.  I used founder and I would not reccommend it.  Personally, I did not like the taste in the soup, but my husband did.  I added tofu that I sauteed in olive oil in cubes.  LOVED that in the soup.  All in all, wonderful recipe.

I just had to write a review about this recipe. This is probably the best stew/soup I have ever had.  The only change I made was to half the amount of pepper because I don't like my pepper to overpower the other flavors in the dish.  This was sooo good I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company.

This stew had great flavor.  Even my husband was happy with this meal.  I only used half the pepper and onion, but added some green onion as well.  I think I will make it with shrimp next time as a few bites seemed really fishy, but the filets I used we have noticed have been fishy tasting in a few meals.

I'm going to make this again. I wish I had seasoned the fish before going headlong into this recipe. The tilapia was a bit dry and bland, though it did get better after I let the stew sit in the frig for a couple of days. I think lightly seasoning the fish with some Adobe or Accent will help and I'll enjoy it much better the second time around. But thanks for this recipe. Quick and perfect comfort food alternative to my chili, which I tend to make a lot of at this time of year.

I really enjoyed this meal, family did not.  I used cod, it's what I had...I bet this would be amazing(and probably a lot more authentic), with dry salt-cod , or shrimp added.  I will have to try...my other fish-loving friend also enjoyed it quite a bit, thank you BellevueMama!

I almost deleted this from my inbox, and then thought I'd quickly read the reviews.  Wow...now I must try this.  Everyone except one review has been positive.  I have access to all of these ingredients in Mongolia.  However, fish is usually frozen and expensive since we are landlocked.  So, I'm going to try it with chicken or beef.  Other meats easy to purchase here: horse, camel, and goat.  Anyone have any great recipes for these?!

This stew is absolutely amazing. The only thing I changed was I used Halibut because that is what I had. The chunks held together and were cooked perfectly. I also added a zucchini. I don't usually cook this style but my neighbor gave me a bunch of Halibut from a fishing trip to Alaska. I wanted to find a different way to use it. I will absolutely be making this many more times!  Rob A.

Awesome! I used haddock that I had skinned instead of the talapia and half the peppers. Used coconut oil instead of olive oil. Other than that I followed the recipe. I refrigerated the fish for several hours after coating with the spice mixture. Will definitely be making this again.

Easy, healthy, and relatively quick. I fell in love with it the first time I tried it.

I cut the peppers in half and doubled the lime. Still, this was good but was missing something to me. Some mango hot sauce fixed it right up. Very good over rice.

Absolutely amazing. I've done this a couple of times and I am poor at following recipes. When I followed this exactly I ended up with a superb meal. In the past I've ruined it by over measuring the fresh lime juice. When I followed the amount used in the recipe it made all the difference in the world. Love this meal and am interested to see if it freezes well.

Oh my goodness. Delicious.  I used a can of tomatoes with green chiles and another 1/2 can of tomatoes.  I also increased all other ingredients as I had 32 oz of fish to feed a large amount of people.  Slivered the onions rather than chopped.  I also used 1 2/3 cans of coconut milk as we like it soupier.  Ladled over jasmine rice. Fed a table of 10 and EVERYONE loved it!!

Omg amazing. I had a surplus of tilapia and stumbled across this recipe. I read all reviews as I usually do for tips, could not find 1 bad review. I added everything that was suggested as far as veges. So ended up with adding extra lime juice in marinade and about a pound of shrimp, along with a couple pinches of red pepper flakes. Let it sit at least an hour,let onions quick fry for a min then added 1 slided carrot,small chopped broccoli crown,1diced potato, 1- 1/2 diced red pepper, added the marinated fish and shrimp, then the tomatos along with a couple diced fresh. So very flavorful, my husband and grown son raved. Will absolutely do this 1 again!

This is a really good stew. The only change I made was that I used Spice Island's Spicy curry powder instead of cumin, I know that takes away the Brazilian aspect but I love it with coconut milk. I marinated the fish for about an hour while I cooked the onions and bell pepper ( I used sweet baby bell peppers), then added spicy diced tomatoes and coconut milk ( I used 2 cans of milk) I boiled that until the flavors started coming together and added a little water just because I love lots of broth. I then added the fish and let it simmer, adding a little more salt and curry powder. My sister who hates fish in any kind of soups said this was very good and would eat it again!! Thank you for the recipe!!

This recipe is amazing. I halved the recipe to serve myself and my boyfriend -- This soup is quick, easy and tasty, but I'm not sure that it would keep well for a second day or in the freezer. I marinated the fish for a couple of hours, then sautéd the onions until they just started to caramelize. I used half of the recommended amount of peppers (because I really feel that too many can overpower a dish) and used half green and half red. I allowed these to sauté lightly with the onions before adding the other ingredients. Once I had the tomatoes, fish and coconut milk in, I watched the pot. Tilapia is very delicate, and I ended up adding my flat-leaf parsley (in place of cilantro) after only 10 minutes of cook time. I allowed it to simmer for another 5 minutes, as recommended, and then I was in soup heaven -- my fish didn't flake up, and it was perfectly cooked through. I don't think this tastes even remotely Thai, personally. I've not eaten much in the way of Brazilian food, but I think the flavors are unique and delicious.

This is fantastic!  I didn't put in the cilantro but otherwise made as directed.  I've made many fish stews and this is the best by far.  I'm typically not a big fan of dishes with coconut milk but loved this.

I made this for the first time this evening , for me it was just ok , I made this because I liked the ingredients but the taste seemed to be missing something . I only used 1 onion & bell pepper as I thought 2 of each was way too much,

To be honest, I was skeptical at first, but after tasting it, I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful the stew is! So easy to put together and so tasty. Great comfort food material and a dish worth repeating.

This is a great and easy to make recipe. I made it for a guests dinner. I marinated overnight (tilapia seems to take so long to get any flavor), reduced the amount of bell peppers to taste. And since I didn't have any preservatives-free coconut milk I just used plain whole milk. It was delicious, everyone wanted more including the kids. I also added 2 Tbsp of achiote oil at the very end as mentioned in other recipes for Brazilian moqueca fish, which is what I think this is. Thanks for posting. Leftovers taste great the next day!!!

Delicious! We loved it. Added only 2 peppers and one zucchini. Also did not have enought fish so added shrimp as well. Any fish that holds together or seafood would work. Also should have added the fish and shrimp later, both were a little over cooked.

I really wanted to give this 3.5 stars but there is none so I will ere on the side of going up.  This was most certainly easy to make and tasty, I just can't help thinking it needs something...a little kick.  We did add red pepper flakes to spice it up and I did use light coconut milk, I will use full strength next time.  I am going to make again and see what I can add to it.  One person did suggest saving lime juice to put on it at the end, I may try that.  Thanks for the recipe, we enjoyed it over rice.

LOVE this!  My family (including an 8yr & 3yr old) loves it as well!  I've made no changes the first time, however found myself with no canned tomatoes, so I chopped up 3 vine-riped tomatoes and it came out perfect!  Will double next time for left overs.  And unlike other reviews, I used the tilapia both times and it was perfect!

I liked this a lot. I used less peppers but otherwise followed the recipe. I had to add some more salt. My kids weren't to keen on it and they are usually adventurous eaters. Oh well, leftovers just for me!

Really great flavor b/c it's the coconut milk and juice of the tomatoes ad the only liquids.  I used 4 different colored peppers and halibut for the fish which came out excellent.

Really good. I made a few adjustments: Cod instead of tilapia, 2 bell peppers instead of 4 (1 red, 1 green), and 1/3 paprika, 2/3 cayenne pepper (b/c I ran out of paprika). LOL. It gave it a nice spiciness. =)

This recipe was simple and delicious, but we felt it a little plain the first time we made it. To give it more flavor we tried adding a little more garlic. While cooking we put a tsp of coconut extract to really bring to life that taste, then we added a few tablespoons of white sugar. It gave it a sweetness that complimented the soup well and added just the flavor we wanted!

This was AMAZING & So Simple!! I Used Frozen Tilapia & Frozen Shrimp. It was a "What Do I have in The Freezer to Cook up Fast Day". I found this recipe & made a Couple Changes. I added one Red Pepper & Half a Green Pepper  & Only Half a Yellow Onion . I Juiced 2 Lemon's & Marinated my still FROZEN Fish & I Quickly thawed out the Shrimp took the tail's off added the Seasoning's Covered it & put in the Fridge for 20 Minute's then Followed the direction's. It was Amazing & It did not have a Strong Fish Taste. The Flavors really Complimented one another GREAT!! will make this again & again. I added some Sliced Avacados & served with Rice & warm Tortillas.

This stew turned out so much tastier than I expected I just had to add a review.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, though I halved the amount (which ended up being enough for 2 people to have dinner plus 1 bowl of leftover).  

I don't think the exactly kind of fish matters, any mild white fish will do.  The cilantro really completes this dish so I would strongly recommend not leaving that out.  

My boyfriend could not get over how awesome this soup was,  I will definitely be making it again,  and next time I will leave the recipe at its full 6 servings.

Solid dish.  Catfish fillets were on sale at the store and it went well with the stew.  I added half a tablespoon of red pepper to give it a little kick and halved the bell peppers.  Everyone that had it loved the taste!

This recipe is a keeper for sure!  It was sooo yummy!  I was a little hesitant because although I like some fish, I'm not a huge seafood lover and "fish stew" just sounded so... fishy.  But it really wasn't, and I'm so glad I tried it.  Instead of on the stove, I just threw everything in my slow cooker and set it on high for 2.5 hours.  I accidently used twice the amount of diced tomatoes, but it still turned out great!  It was perfect with quinoa... I can't wait to make it again!

This dish is really fabulous. I had high hopes on this recipe and it justified them. Tomatoes and coconut milk make a great sauce. Some reviews stated the fish was sweet, mine wasn`t (maybe it depends on coconut milk). I used cod instead of tilapia. Very good recipe, I will make it again and again.

The hubs was skeptical about a "fish stew," but he was shocked at how much he liked it!  The only thing I didn't follow exactly was the tomatoes--I thought I had them, but I didn't so I used a small jar of tomatoe sauce.  It was nom nom! 
Oh, and I used Swai fish instead of tilapia, because they're supposedly very similar.

Very good.  I was a little concerned that the spices might be overpowering, but it turned out very flavorful without being too strong.

Fabulous!!!    I did decrease the bell pepper and put in a can of tomatoes with green chiles with liquid, most other ingredients the same.  What a great flavor!

Awesome!  This is a great low carb dish as is, but I had to add potatoes to make it hearty enough for my husband.  Since I'm not a fan of tilapia, I used mahimahi instead.  I also added extra garlic to the marinade and adjusted the flavor at the end with more lime juice and a bit of salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is such a great recipe! I highly recommend it. It's ridiculously simple and DELICIOUS. 

When I made it, I was skeptical that something so simple would be so fabulous. I was pleasantly surprised, and everyone was very impressed.

In am Very picky about fish, (basically, I don't like it much)But for some strange reason, I decided to give this a try.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Ahi (fresh tuna) instead of Tilapia and this is fantastic!  My family liked it, as much as I did.  I think the reason this is so good is the use of coconut milk; it takes the 'fishiness' out of fish...at any rate, it is great for picky eaters...my husband even asked what kind of meat I had used...

This was absolutely delicious!  I thought the tilapia was perfect. The only changes that I made that put the stew over the top was adding some salt and red curry paste to taste because it did feel like it was missing something at first. Rave reviews from my guest, so this will definitely be made again soon!

This was easy to make and very tasty. I also used just 2 peppers since my kids aren't fond of them. Then only thing I may change is to use half a can of coconut milk. The coconut flavor was  a bit overpowering.

I made this exactly as written except only use 2 1/2 peppers. It is really an idiot-proof recipe. My boyfriend and I LOVED it. I'll definitely be making it again. It's great on its own or over rice.

loved it, would make again with the following changes after the onions were browned in the large pot, I would remove them, and brown the bell peppers (3) is plenty, once the peppers were brown I would remove them, and add the fish chunks, add a little more olive oil turn the heat up to high and brown the fish. Once the fish was browned, I would return the onions, peppers and fish back to the pot, add the diced tomatoes, and to the can of coconut milk I would add 2 tablespoons of corn starch (or flour - whichever your thickening choice is)shake or stir til smooth and add the coconut milk mix to the pot, I would follow the original recipe from here.

This was one yummy recipe.  I used 1 large yellow pepper and 2 small green peppers.  It was lots.  To cut the fat and calories, I used 2 c. soy milk with 1 capful of coconut extract.  My husband sopped up the liquid with extra bread - and he is not a fish/spicy fan!  I'm looking forward to seeing how it tastes the next day.

I was hoping to like this more than I actually did. It had all the flavors I like. Oh well, I may try again and maybe double all the spices? Mine was sort of tasteless but I don't know why.

I mixed tilapia and salmon, didn't use garlic and cut back on the peppers.  I didn't have cilantro, but I served the stew over basmati rice made with saffron, chicken bullion, olive oil and coriander.  Everyone loved it, including a three year old!

Although I've made MANY recipes from AR before, this is my first review.  Made this for dinner for a little gathering tonight and it was fantastic! Reading the reviews beforehand I did make a few minor changes though. I used 3 bell peppers (2 green and 1 red), 2 yellow onions and half a leftover red onion; and 2 cans of diced tomatoes. There were no 16-oz cans of diced tomatoes or coconut milk in my grocery store so I went with 2 cans 14.5 oz diced tomatoes and 1 12.5 oz can Goya coconut milk. Oh and because I'm a shrimp lover I added 1 lb small-medium pre-cooked shrimp (with tails pulled off) in the last 15 minutes of cooking.  The only regret I have is that I didn't use that fourth bell pepper. So many reviewers said that the bell pepper taste was too strong but I guess mine could have used more due to more than the called for amount of tomatoes.  I served it with some crusty bread and it was amazing! Everybody requested the recipe and it's one I will definitely make again. Thanks BellevueMama!

Delicious and easy Sunday supper. Added jalapenos to spice it up along with the bell and red sweet peppers, and served it over rice in soup bowls. Passed around additional chopped, fresh cilantro and fresh lime to squeeze over all.  Crusty bread!  Everyone left the table smiling!

I followed this recipe almost to the letter, only substituting sockeye salmon for the fish.  Lovely, light flavour.  I would add some hot chilis or  something for more heat next time but since this had to be kid pleasing, it was fine as is.

OMGaaa this was soooo good.  This is a sweet/hot stew.  I did alter just a little.  I only put one red pepper and one hot pepper. And just used one onion.  So flavorful.....Will do again.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This was so good and it was easy to put together. I used less bell peppers and added a jalapeno (because that's what I had on hand) and it worked fine. We will be making this regularly.

made for easter lunch, was very filling and yet light and flaverful.  Highly recommend.  I will make again, but I think next time add a variety of fish mixed instead of all tilapia.

Wonderful! I used parsley instead of cilantro,  cut down on the number of peppers, and used grouper. Wonderful! Great for Friday night!

A nice, flavorful recipe if you're looking for something a little different. If made with tilapia, the fish taste isn't very strong, compared to the coconut milk. Definitely don't cut down on the amount of spices - the amounts listed are really the bare minimum.

This was an easy, delicious recipe - flavorful, aromatic and pleasant on teh eye. I didn't have bell peppers so I used broccoli, and I had two tomatoes from the garden that needed to be used so I substituted those for the canned. I love Tom Ka Kai soup, and this reminds me of that.  I'm not a fish fan, but was not offended by having it in this recipe. Next time I will try with chicken.

This was a fabulous dish.  My husband is not much of a fan of fish, but he ate plenty of this.  My only regret is that I couldn't find my paprika while I was making this and it did seem to need something more. Won't hold my lost spice against it though. :)  Loved how simple it was to prepare, and was surprised that something so simple was a flavorful as it was.

very tasty.  i will be making some adjustments next time i make it, but overall a very easy quick dinner.  my 5-yr-old even ate it up! woohoo!!

*********adjustments*********
added 1 tbsp salt to the onions while they are simmering. did a 13 oz can of coconut milk and a 14 oz of tomatoes and it was fine. added 1 tsp of curry. delish! i also took frozen tilapia that was thawed enough, but not all the way through. it held up in the stew perfectly. put in an extra tbsp of lime juice, it was fabulous. perhaps next time i will add some pinapple while serving. yum! definite FAVORITE in the fam now. thank you!!

I made this for 4 servings. I followed the recipe exactly. The tilapia marinated overnight. It was a little bland when I tasted the finished stew.  I then added 1 tbsp. of lime juice and a bit more salt and pepper. I also used the optional fresh cilantro. Delicious!

I made this with salmon instead of tilapia.  I also only used one large onion and one large bell pepper.  My husband loved it!  It was really good and easy to make.  I served it with buttermilk biscuits.  Will definitely make it again.

Terrific.  I modified it by using one chopped jalapeño pepper in stead of the bell peppers and I added fresh spinach.  I also substituted cod for the tilapia

A little more heat would be nice. I used dory (on sale) for my stew. It's a bit bland. I'll use tilapia next time. Very easy and enjoyable dish!

My family loved it! I substituted coconut oil for olive oil, used cod instead of tilapia, crushed tomatoes vs. diced, red bell peppers and added a little more coconut oil and lime juice at the end with the cilantro to finish. Served with crusty sour dough toast.

AMAZING!!!! I did the recipe exactly as listed (though added monkfish too with the tilapia) and it was fantastic. I used red peppers to keep it sweet. Salt and pepper at the end. OMG, this was so good. Entire family said it's a keeper.

Great recipe! I really enjoyed making this and it tasted delicious! The grocery store was out of tilapia so I substituted cod instead, but was still great and surprisingly filling. I guess the coconut milk really fills you up. A few tips: I like spicy food and thought the spice level was just perfect, but if you're not a fan of spicy consider adding less paprika. I also ended up salting it a bit more after it was ready so maybe do 2 or 3 teaspoons of salt as opposed to one. Special thanks to the OP for sharing this recipe it was my first attempt at this style of cuisine and it was great!

Great recipe. I made a few changes  . I follow a low salt diet for health reason. I roughly cut recipe in half. I thawed tilapia in a ziplock with cumin, paprika, black pepper and garlic powder. I added lime juice and marinated 40 minutes. I sauteed bell pepper, onions and a small jalepeno . I added 2 15 oz cans of Rotel no salt added, 2 cups of H2O and brought to a boil, threw in tilapia and simmered 15 minutes. I used the imersion blender. Then added 6 oz can  coconut milk. Simmered another  10 minutes.A  squirt lime.

Wow! This is absolutely delicious! I made this almost just like the recipe. Minus a few peppers because I didn’t have 4 (only 2). I can’t believe how easy and simple this is to make. The flavors are just a explosion of goodness! Definitely a keeper!!

oh wow.  just yum.  The only modifications I made were 1 red bell pepper and 1 yellow bell pepper, instead of the 4 green.  Light coconut milk instead of regular.  Also added  an extra toss of red pepper flakes and extra salt (I used sea salt instead of iodized so it needed more).  However, even if I had made it exactly as detailed, it would have still been pretty darned spectacular.  The perfect dish to make with an impending snow storm!

This fish stew was fabulous. My husband and I loved it. I did change it up a bit. I used 1 yellow bell pepper, 1 large white onion, 1 large russet potato, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, cod fillets, and fire roasted diced tomatoes with the juice, but the rest of the ingredients remained the same. Next try will be with ancho or poblano peppers.

I would make again. Very easy. Thought flavor was good but peppers were too soggy. Perhaps would add them later and chop finer. Add a little hot also, cayenne or red pepper.

Yummy yummy yummy. I made this for the first time for dinner for me and my kids. I used one bell pepper insted of 4, added cayenne pepper to the marinade and the stew for a kick, and added shrimp. I also used Italian garlic and oregano diced can tomatoes that have a more mild, sweet flavor and half bunch of  fresh parsley leaves.

I used Salmon and not too big a bunch of cilantro.  I normally don't even like cilantro, but I liked it in this dish.  My husband and I loved it!! Really it was one of our favorite recipes and so easy to make.  Made it on Tuesday and had it again Friday so my daughter could try it when she came to visit.

made it with salmon since it was the only fish i had on hand. tastes good but the flavor was just okay, not anything spectacular. a bit bland but that might've been because I did not marinate. perfect & easy. will probably make again sometime.

This was tasty. I made it for dinner guests and everyone enjoyed. I put it in the crockpot, so I would have more time to visit, and It worked very well. The only change I made was halving the bell peppers.

This recipe is delicious, easy and my family loves it. SCORE. I followed directions but reduced the peppers to 1 green and 1 yellow. Also substituted for tilapia for cod which held up well in the stew. Will make again.

Made this stew with left over cod and smoke salmon! WOW!!! I can't say enough of this meal. I did tweak it a bit to add more flavor at the end. A bit of butter and lemon, you can also add jalapeno for bit more punch. Great with Garlic Cheese bread and a glass of White Wine which you could also add a little of in the stew as well!

This was a great recipe. I'mean not a big fan of strong fish flavors so I have been looking for more recipes that make me like fish better and this one is a keeper! I halved the amount of green pepper as suggested but I shouldn't have. Next time I will do the whole amount of green pepper but half the amount of cumin.

My son and I really liked this stew. I took others' recommendations and used fewer bell peppers, at first, but ended up using all 4 bell peppers to make the stew chunkier.  I added this to my Pinterest board already. Thank you for this recipe.

This was excellent.  I made it as directed, except I substituted leek for one of of the onions because it was all I had.  I think that it would also be good with shrimp and scallops in addition to the tilapia (or other white fish). This is one we will make again and again!

Super delish dish! My family loved it, even our toddler! I made it as listed. My tilapia didn't fall apart, maybe because I had quick thawed (letting it sit in cold water until mostly thawed) it from frozen right before making the stew. I cooked my stew a bit longer, 10 minutes, to make sure my fish was done and the peppers were softened. Definitely keeping and doing this recipe again! Served all five of us generously. I made white rice to accompany it.

I marinated for 2 hours and followed the recipe to the letter.  Unfortunately it was bland.  I  added a dry Caribbean Jerk seasoning and extra garlic powder that gave it the flavor boost needed.  Cooked it about 5 minutes longer and let it rest for 20 minutes.  I served it with  an Old Bay seasoned balsamic rice and  baked cinnamon w/brown sugar sweet potato slices.  It was a hit!!  The entire family loved it.  This recipe is a really good base, however for those who enjoy heavily seasoned dishes you will need to add your own layersl of seasoning.

I was excited to make this dish, since I was looking for an interesting tilapia dish.
I was not too impressed, though the stew was good.  It was just a bit bland.  However, I had to make changes based on not having certain ingredients (no bell peppers and I used SILK coconut milk, not canned, and I used coconut oil instead of olive oil).  I followed the recipe otherwise, and marinated the fish for about 1.5 hours.  While we did like the recipe, I do not understand the rave reviews.  Next time I will add more cumin and paprika, and maybe a touch of siracha. The canned tomatoes should be replaced with fresh, if possible, IMO. I do live in a foodie area, so maybe I am just used to very flavorful dishes.

It's a family fave after a few tweaks..while prepping veggies roast the peppers and some corn over the gas burners..add sliced boiled eggs at the end and added some small shrimp with the fish ..cod worked great too..serve over rice or one kid likes it with just french bread..good stuff!!!!

We really liked this overall. I took the recommendation of reducing the bell pepper to two. It was still a lot of bell pepper. I would also dice the bell pepper instead of cutting it into slices. I think I would replace one pepper with a potato. Just to give it more "tooth" and to help thicken it a bit. We felt it needed to be thickened just a smidge. As well, I would reduce the amount of onion used. I used 1.5 onions and it still seemed like a bit.

Fantastic! One of the top 5 soups I've ever made. My wife was very skeptical about how well it would come out but she ended up absolutely loving it. I used 1 large onion and only 2 bell peppers per other reviewers. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

This was the best..... The only thing is that I did not have any bell peppers so I replaces them with one jalapeno (chopped) and 4 celeey sticks (chopped)... and instead of two chopped onions, I only did one... and yet, it was delicious and spicy!!!!!!

Great recipe! We'll definitely make it again. 

Changes: 
-simmered it a bit longer because of the extra water from the peppers
-used spicy paprika for a little kick
-used one sweet onion and one red onion for extra colour

Next time:
-I would use two peppers: red and yellow

My family loved this recipe! it is so good..., what I did different: not a fan of bell peppers! so used a zucchini, a yellow squash and asparagus instead and it works excellent; and for the coconut milk there was no canned ones so I just used silk coconut milk and it works just fine. Done it twice already!

I doubled the recipe, but did not put peppers in it as two of our family do not eat peppers.  This is  a wonderful recipe.......................the whole family , including the younger ones loved it.  My son said he could eat it once a week.  I certainly will be making it again and again.

It was a very nice change. We eat a lot of tilapia and it is easy to get in a rut of fixing the same menu all the time. I agree with others that 4 bell peppers would have been too much. I did add some crushed red peppers, but it could have used a little more. I was apprehensive about this being too sweet, but it was just right. I will be making this again.

Yummy. LOVED the broth flavor-the lime really added a nice flavor. Too many peppers. Maybe I would try it with some white beans and less peppers next time.

After reading the reviews, I added some mushrooms and used 3 peppers instead of 4. Also, I used fire roasted tomatoes and I added a fresh jalapeno with the seeds for a kick.  I'm not a fan of coconut milk so opted for 2% evaporated milk instead (2 cans). Overall, I really enjoyed it! I didn't find that I needed to add any additional seasonings either which is rare for me.

I made this before and followed the recipe exactly without all of the peppers (just one red pepper).It turned out ok,well this time i used light coconut milk and 2 cups of chicken broth just to make it soupier.I made the mistake of using curry instead of cumin but it came out just as good,if not better.Just too spicy for our little ones,but when i make this only my husband and I enjoy it anyway so..overall this is a keeper and very easy to make.

I made this dish tonight but I tweaked it a bit. I took advice from other reviewers and used only 2 peppers (one green and one yellow). Marinated the fish for 2 hours. Also, I only had a 13 oz can of coconut milk and a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes but it still came out amazing!! I will definitely make it again but using a different fish with a stronger flavor because I used the Tilapia and it was too mild.

Fabulous!  Since I am allergic to coconut, I used sit milk instead and that worked out really well.  I reduced the amout of bell peppers to 1 red pepper and 1/2 yellow (for am amount for 3).  The stew was flavorful and spicy, and I am a fan of the way the tilaoia flaked!

I am Brazilian and I have been trying to find an "american version" of the muqueca "fish/ sea food stew " to prepare for my hubby for a while. I was over excited when I saw this recipe here. I changed a few things though, I used 10 oz of salmon fillets instead since it was all the fish I had and a sea food combination mix of squid, mussel and shrimp. I also used 3 peppers instead of 4, one green, one yellow and one red and last but not least, I used parsley instead of cilantro. Needless to say it turned out delicious! My husband doesn't even like sea food but he LOVED this meal.

I'm hard to please, but this simplified recipe is a winner. Doesn't take much time to prepare and cook, and the hearty mixture is truly delicious. I didn't make any changes to the recipe;next time I'd like to add potatoes. My partner is from Brazil and after eating this plate, he posted on facebook the picture of the dish and a rating of 10/10! Enjoy guys!

Very good stuff!  I might try Thai basil next time instead of cilantro.  I added some hot sauce at the end.  A little bit of fish or oyster sauce is good too.

I used 3 bell peppers and 4 tilapia filets.  This was a great dish! I used about a 1/3cup of water because I had 13oz of coconut milk.  I served it over jasmine rice with warm semolina bread.

This was amazing - easy, delicious, and made of pantry staples (for me, anyway) - I'd give it 10 stars if I could! Was browsing for new and different tilapia recipes and came across this gem. Followed the recipe as written except I only had lemon juice on hand, and I added 2 tbsp of sweet chili sauce and reduced the cumin in the marinade, because I'm not big on cumin. I also sauteed the bell peppers with the onions and added a few handfuls of spinach. OMG, so good! My fiance and 2-year-old devoured it along with some cheddar-garlic biscuits. I ate the leftovers cold for lunch today and it was even better - I'll make this again and again!

This was great!  My 4 year old son polished off his bowl too (with some parmesan cheese added to the top).  I used Salmon fillets and as others mentioned, I used 5 T lime juice (3 in the sauce, then 2 at the end), 8 oz of baby potatoes cut up, 1 tomato, a larger can of diced tomatoes (28oz)and only 2.5 peppers.  I didn`t bother cutting up the salmon because once it cooked, it flaked nicely.  A complete dish. Delicious!

If my wife will eat a fish dish, you know it's good. And she finished all I gave her. Using tilapia gives it no fishy taste or smell. I'm sure cod or catfish would work as well but wouldn't be as authentic. Another benefit is that this recipe is very paleo. I made two small changes: added the live juice until the end to make it a dry rub, used light coconut milk to knock off some calories.

This recipe was so tasty!
I would suggest a few changes:
1. Less bell peppers
2. More paprika and salt to taste.
3. Add lemongrass to give it a zing.

This was really good. I added some sliced ginger to marinade and some garlic and grated ginger to the saute. Also added sliced thai hot peppers because I like it hot and some fish sauce. Only used 2 red bell peppers. Served over jasmine rice.

I tried this recipe last night and it was awesome. My only regret is that I didn't marinate the fish longer. I used swai and hake fish instead of tilapia, but it was still delicious. I serve it over lime cilantro rice with warmed corn tortillas and kids loved it! Even my three year old wanted seconds!!

Wow, this turned out great! I used swai and threw in a couple extra filets, three bell peppers instead of four, then added a splash of skim milk for extra broth. Also, extra salt and stirred some sriracha for a little more pep. I've made it twice, and letting the fish marinate overnight definitely makes it taste better!

Made this recipe as written, except only 1 green pepper and a few scallions (what I had on hand). Added some rice anda few dashes of Frank's Chili Lime. Splendid! With the rice added this serves about 10-12 people though! Oh well, good thing this is such a yummy dish!!

This stew is pretty good.  I did swap out 2 peppers for 2 diced zucchini.  My husband added hot sauce for a kick & I only added the cilantro to mine after I served it.  The lime flavor was not strong at all.  I may add a little lime juice to mine when I serve it.  Also, I used flounder as it is a firmer fish & I was afraid tilapia would have disintigrated.  Good basic recipe & easily modified for individual tastes.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I cooked it for 11 other people and all the people I spoke to like it a lot.  I simmer the stew for two hours though so the vegetable came out tender.

I left out the green peppers and onion, I added 2 stalks of celery, 2 large carrots and 8oz of fresh sliced mushrooms.  I didn't have cumin so I added a Tbl of garam spice and 1/4 t of ground chili pepper. I also subbed orange roughy and a dozen large cleaned chopped up shrimp.  Really good soup! My husband said it was as good as our favorite Tai restaurant.

Made this last night. As written, I give it 4 stars. It was good, but I felt like it lacked something. I added a couple TBSPs yellow curry powder and it added just the right amount of kick! I'd give it 5 stars with the curry. We ate it over brown rice and then had the leftovers with tortillas. Great either way.

This was delicious and was even better the next day.  I did end up switching the coconut milk with chicken broth.  Only did that because the coconut milk had solidified and I wasn't sure if it was still good.  Two thumbs up!

I didn't have coconut milk at home. Instead, I added some yogurt right the end. It was amazing. The yogurt was so good that I'm not sure I would use coconut milk next time.

Great stew!  Thumbs up from the whole family! I used cod, but next time will try salmon.  I also will cut the peppers into smaller pieces instead of whole strips.  Delish and easy!  (I used two red peppers instead of four.)

Everyone liked it, but our Brazilian exchange student doesn't believe it's like any fish stew she's eaten.  I cut the peppers back to 2 as suggested - I will make this again.

Awesome!  My husband and I love, love, love this.  Definitely needs some Siracha for some kick, but we just each add our own.  I use a little less peppers and onions, but really no changes are necessary.  I add just a little extra lime juice too.  Highly recommended, you must make this

This dish was very tasty.  I modified it a bit adding slice potatoes and carrots.  I satayed these vegetables with the onions and red pepper.  I also reduced the amount of red peppers to one and added 28 oz. of diced tomatoes.  Yummy!

As is, this would be "pepper" stew with some fish for flavoring.  Agree with what the others say, 1-2 peppers at most.  Other than that this is a very easy and tasty recipe.  I like peppers and used one red and one yellow but think I'll probably go with just one whole pepper if I cook it again.

Even my wife, who is pretty picky when it comes to fish, loves this recipe.  I didn't have cumin so I substituted cumin seed and didn't have cilantro so I substituted mixed spring greens.  It turned out great but I think it could be even better with the cilantro and cumin.

So easy and so good! I used light coconut milk and less onion/olive oil. My honey doesn't like spicy foods but if i had my way I'd add some cayenne to the fish coating.

Made this for lunch today and it was AMAZING! My husband and I really enjoyed it and we are not big fish eaters - so it will be a great way to add fish to our diet.   Few variations: I added Sour Cream to make the soup base a bit more creamier. Also added about a teaspoon of Curry to spice it up. Didn't buy fresh cilentro but used dried.   Will make again!

Loved the recipe! I used lite coconut milk, 1 large red pepper and hot paprika; served over brown rice with lots of cilantro and lime. The hot paprika definitely added heat. I used a combination of shrimp, tilapia and cod. The shrimp overcooked; next time would add shrimp at the end after the heat has been turned off. I actually could have left off all of the fish altogether and would have been perfectly happy. Next time I will try chicken breast pounded thin (don't know the proper cooking term for this technique) and sliced.

My husband and I weren't too fond of this stew.  He thought the meat was chicken.  I would have been disappointed if I had ordered this out at a restaurant.  I really don't understand the high reviews.

This was a wonderful stew. I served it over Jasmine rice; everyone loved it. Also I only used 1/2 red pepper and 1/2 green pepper. It was just right!

This is an outstanding recipe and very cost effective.  We like our food with a little more spice and herbs than this recipe called for.  After I completes the recipe as written I added more cumin and some hot paprika.  It is a winner and good for company as well.  Easy to make.

Enjoyed this meal!  I also served over jasmine rice and added Sriracha once served.  Boyfriend said he would like more spice to the overall soup, but I think just marinating the fish for longer than 30 minutes would do the trick!  Thanks for the recipe.

We really liked it but would dial up the seasoning a bit more to marinate the fish.  I also used a bit more coconut milk,  Served it over pasta, but next time will use rice.  Really good recipe!

LOVE this recipe!  We had friends over and they thought it was one of the best meals they have had in a long time!  It was easy and inexpensive.  I added shrimp which was a great addition.  If you like things a bit on the spicy side, I suggest you add some cayenne pepper at the end.  Bon appetite'

Very Nice. Suggestions optional:  Triple lime juice adding half at end; don't fret if you don't have peppers; Use red,  white and green onions for color; add some curry if you like curry; try Cod; don't do what I did - used lite coconut milk. next time will go full boar and use the regular coconut milk; finally,  invite someone over for a delicious meal.

Wow!!! This is my new favorite go-to dish when I need to impress at a dinner party. So easy to make. I served it over brown rice. Everyone went back for seconds. It smells wonderful, too.

I was really excited about making this dish. The ingredients sounded fantastic and the reviews were very positive. However, I thought the stew fell flat. My boyfriend liked the dish, but I was pretty disappointed. It might have some potential, maybe by increasing garlic and other spices, but as is, I was just not impressed.

Delicious and easy. I had everything on hand but cilantro and it was still gooood. I served the soup with crusty whole wheat batard and avacado. My husband liked it too and he is not a tomato fan. I  will make this dish again as it is perfect for the colder autumn evenings.

I used one onion and 2 green bell peppers and served it over rice.  It is delicious!  We loved the hint of lime on the fish.  Next time I'll try wild cod.  Thank you!

I'd say 4 1/2 stars as well because this is cheap and easy and DH loved it. I added some crushed red pepper and seasoning salt and served it over jasmine rice. Might add some shrimp next time too.

This was pretty good, but I only used 3 peppers and that was plenty and added some shrimp since my fish fell apart! Plus I used cornstarch to thicken the liquid into a sauce. Perhaps it needs just a bit of a kick.
