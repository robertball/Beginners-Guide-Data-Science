Easy and delicious! I used a Granny Smith Apple and red onion. I left out the egg and replaced that with a combination of sliced grapes, raisins, and chopped walnuts. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used 1/2 cup of Hellman's light mayo cut with 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream for added creaminess along with the curry, paprika and cayenne pepper.  I also added a little bit of salt and black pepper. It chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good. Overall, a great combination of flavors! Especially good on whole grain bread!

I love this recipe - quick, easy and delicious.  I doubled the curry and used 2 pks of Perdue Shortcuts (roasted).  Left out the egg and apple, and added 2 tbsp of Mango Chutney for a touch of sweetness.  Then, served on sweet rolls with lettuce.  Um, Um, Good!

This is a nice, evenly balanced recipe. I left out the hard boiled eggs and didn't miss them. Great taste for a fast and easy dish!

I have never made chicken salad from a recipe until today. I always just add ingredients I like to taste. This was pretty good. I didn't have a rotisserie, so I used 2 really large cooked chicken breasts. I followed all of the ingredients, except the apple I did peel because the recipe didn't specify and I used lite mayonaise with olive oil. I am sure the full fat mayo would taste excellent. I served it on some whole wheat bread I made today. It is a little more spicy then what I am used to from my normal chicken salad, but it was nice to try something different.

So delicious! I am sensitive to spice but this was perfect. Will be a regular lunch in our house.  Fallowed recipe exactly and would not change a thing.

I was not very impressed with this recipe.  Maybe I had an extra large chicken, but the mayonnaise wasn't near enough to cover the pieces (and I don't like things mayonnaisey at all, so I was looking for a very light coating, not a heavy dressing).  Even after adding extra mayo, the salad felt like it was missing something.  I added in a little honey and a tbsp of chopped pecans and that made it better, but I don't think I'll be making this recipe again.  There are some other excellent chicken curry salad recipes available on this site, so I will go back to those next time.

This recipe is awesome!!!  I used a "buttery garlic" rotisserie chicken from WalMart.  I omitted the apple (didn't have) but did everything else.  This recipe is AWESOME!  Oh, I added a little salt to bring out the flavors.  Thanks for sharing!!  I will make this again!

I really enjoyed this, and my 4 year old daughter loved it too. I used canned chicken, and raisins instead of boiled eggs. Yummy.

I made it exactly as written and it was fabulous!  It's rare to find something this easy to prepare that is a hit with everyone at a gathering, particularly when people are not always fans of curry.  It was eaten and I could have made far more, with much praise thrown in from the party-goers.  I just brought Vienna buns and some bibb lettuce, than sat back and enjoyed the company.  Highly recommend.

I had leftover cooked chicken breast and needed a quick recipe.  I skipped the hard boiled eggs and apple.  I did have celery.  This made a really tasty quick curry sandwich filling.  I'll make it again, hopefully when I have an apple around.

I'm sorry for the average review.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken and went exactly by the recipe.  I was really hoping to like it with the apple in it, but it was just average.  I think it may of been either the cayenne or paprika that threw off the taste for me.  I tried to doctor it up to save it.  Thanks for the recipe to try!  I did enjoy making it.

This is a very versatile recipe. You can add any type of nuts or harder fruits to the mayonnaise and it will be delicious. I added pepitas to the mix.  I'm also cutting down on very sweet fruit such as raisins so I added about a 1.5 gala apple to replace the raisins.  I like more mayo and curry so I added a little extra. It also freezes well.

Thanks a lot! It was great and easy. I did not used roasted chicken, but just used a piece of chicken breast. I added raisins to make it pop.

I love the versatility of this chicken salad!!! 
Absolutely delicious and easy as is! However, at times, I make additions, my favorite being toasted slivered almonds, but other times toasted pecans, if that's what I have on hand. My favorite way to eat it is with tortilla chips or with wheat thins toasted chips. Yum!

Yummy!!! Except for adding more mayo (probably close to double what the recipe calls for), i stayed true to the recipe. Very tasty! I love the bite of the cayenne and curry combined with the sweetness of the apple. That is tasting before it's had time to chill for 1 hour or overnight too. Can't wait to have this for lunch tomorrow!
