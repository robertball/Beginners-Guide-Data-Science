These are my favorite cookies to make during Christmas time.  I do use real butter instead of margarine though, as everyone seems to prefer it.  Also, to save time, after rolling the dough into balls and placing them into mini muffin tins, I wrap a plastic sandwich bag around a wine cork or the top of an empty small water bottle and press this into each ball.  After that, I only need to do a little reshaping before pouring the filling in.

These are absolutely delectable! However, it took me over two hours to make them all (and I had 4 pans!). And just a tip-- this recipe made more like 7 or 8 dozen. Also, I would highly recommend being careful not to overfill them. If the filling overflows it is a huge pain to remove them from the pans!

I have to say this is my husband and I's new favorite cookie recipe. These are so good! Just a warning to first time baker's of Pecan Tassies, they are very labor intensive! I would definitely recommend having more than 2 mini muffin tins to make these! They are well worth the hard work!

These are sooo good. The dough does need to be chilled for atleast one hour for handling reasons. But please use real butter instead of the fake stuff. Be careful when removing from pans, use a knife and try to twist them out.

They were a bit difficult to remove from the mini-muffin pan since the crust is so delicate. I have made them again but instead of making the dough, I have used phyllo tartlet shells and they are still very delicious.

Wonderful! They are very easy to make, although I would definitely recommend a nut chopper or food processor if you don't have one! I cut the dough recipe in half and there was still plenty. Everyone loved them, they were just what I hoped they would be!

I had never made these before.  I just bought the Pampered Chef tartlet pan and press and this recipe was so easy to do!  I served them at a PC party I held at my house and EVERYONE loved them and kept asking me for the recipe!  I handed this recipe out.  AWESOME

These are amazing! I made these for a meeting where 40 people attended, and received rave reviews from everyone who tried one. I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 2 tbl. packed brown sugar, 2 tsp. of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. salt (because I used unsalted butter) to the crust; next time I would add another 1/4 tsp. salt. I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the pecan filling mixture. I used a tablespoon to measure both the crust and the filling, and got 61 tablespoons of crust and 58 tablespoons of filling...not bad given the yield of 60 as stated in the recipe! I filled the remaining three crusts with leftover chopped pecans and brown sugar, and they turned out to be pretty yummy little pecan packets! I took a lot of time to form the crusts so that each one had a lip around the edge, and I had zero problems with filling escaping them. After trying, my family has requested that I make these for Thanksgiving!

These are fantastic.. I also made them substituting chopped walnuts when I realized I didn't have any pecans...also very good.  And I dusted then with powdered sugar when they were cool.. Definitely a favorite recipe!!

I'm always looking for ways to use my mini muffin tins, 
this was a great way! These are delicious, especially when 
warmed in the microwave and topped with ReddiWhip.

I've been making these for a few years and people absolutely adore them. A few tips - sometimes you'll get a small crystallized disc of brown sugar on the bottom after completely cooled - this can be rectified by either adding more pecans to the filling or by making sure you aren't cooling them too quickly. This recipe always yields more than 60 for me - I like the dough thin around the inside of the mini muffin pans so I usually yield closer to 74 - 78. In addition, be sure the dough at the bottom isn't too thin or else the filling will seep out and stick to the bottom of the pan. Good luck - people really enjoy these and they look great!!

This recipe is great... but just one word of advice.  Be sure not to overhandle the cream cheese dough.  If you do, the pastry turns out very rubbery.  I recommend NOT rolling the dough in balls.  Instead, pull off small equal amounts and flatten them into your tin without rolling them.

It wouldn't be Cristmas around here without one of our all time favorites. Online or at nice kitchen store you can find a (very inexpensive) handy wooden tool that pats pastry dough into mini-muffin pans, making the task 100% easier. I drop balls of dough in the pan, spray my tart tamper with Butter Flavored Pam and zip right throw the process. The recipe makes a lot, so there are plenty to share with family and friends. Also I use butter, not margarine.

Only thing I do different is I use real butter.  I never use margarine.  This is a real crowd pleaser.  I have subbed walnuts in the past and have made mini pumpkin pies out of these also.

PERFECT!!!  My mom LOVES these cookies so the taste test will come later.  However, as far as baking goes, these turned out beautifully.  Here's how I did it... I used mini-muffin pans, a small cookie scoop for the dough, and an almost level TSP of filling for each.  They rose up and filled each cup perfectly.  It may seem like a very small amount but trust me, it's the exact right amount.

This is now our official family Christmas cookie.   I follow the instructions exactly except that I use real butter instead of margarine.   The dough is very sticky. Chilling it overnight helps make it easier to handle. The thicker the pastry is in the muffin cup, the easier it is to remove it from the pan intact after baking.  Nonstick pans sprayed with cooking spray are a must.

These turned out to taste good, but DIDN'T look good. I took these to a party, friends admitted that they were hesitant to sample these due to their appearance, but upon tasting them, they thought they were delicious. Several notable tips are: make sure that you FORM A SHELL with the dough (do not simply create a depression) - mold the dough into a shell-shape. Also, if you use too much dough for the shell, it may not cook thoroughly. I also advise baking the shells and once they are mostly done, add the filling and continue baking (as recommended in the "Butter Pecan Tartlets" recipe from this site). I had also added about one tablespoon of brown sugar to the dough mixture; next time I will add more. I am currently rating this as 3 stars, but if/when I try again, I may revise my rating.

Definitely time consuming...but the outcome is DELICIOUS! And I don't even like pecan pie all that much. Be sure to press the dough really thin in the mini muffin pan. The thinner the crust...the better! I could actually see the color of the pan n some spots through the dough. I then baked the pastry for 5 minutes with no filling. I removed them, filled them almost to the top, and baked them another 15 minutes. They came out great! Use a knife to remove them from the muffin pan. If there is a little filling that baked to the pan, be sure to loosen this before trying to scoop out the whole tart. I will be making these again! 
Oh and I added a drop of almond extract to the crust for a little more taste. MM mm mmmmm!

Many people commented on the "doughiness" of the pastry.  I found it helpful (and quick) to use a small cookie/ice cream scoop to control the amount I placed in my mini muffin tin.  Then I used a tart press to shape them.  I didn't realize how much the filling rises out of the tart, so on the next batch I made, I didn't fill them quite as high.  If you have a parchment or pastry bag, try putting the filling in there and then filling the tarts.  This is also a time saver.

These were really good and I figured out how to make them perfectly by the time I was almost at the end! I did the trick with the wine cork wrapped in a baggie to make a depression in the dough before baking them (without filling) for 5 minutes. After the 5 minutes, they will be puffy and kinda deformed, but this is perfect for using your wrapped wine cork again to re-manipulate the dough and then immediately filling with pecan mixture. I had my husband help (one reshape and one fill the cups) and then bake for the remaining time, 10 min. Good luck! They're worth it!

I made these for the first time and they tasted good.  I did make the crust too thick though.  This made them very dry.  I should have known there was a problem when I had so much filling left over.  With too much dough in the muffin pan there wasn't as much room for the filling.  Will definetely make these again, but will thin out the crust.

Certainly not quick and easy - very tedious, but worth the trouble.  I used the recipe with butter - it always makes a better crust - but for shaping the crust I used a closed top to a 16 oz water bottle, floured and it worked beautifully to shape the crust.  The key to getting them out of the pan in one, pretty piece is to be careful not to over fill the cup.  A tip - do not put the pecans in the filling, instead place 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon in the bottom of each crust, then add the liquid filing - I did the second batch that way and they turned out perfect.

These are great.  I was looking for a recipe that was close to my grandmothers, and this really matched it perfectly.  I got 81 cookies out of this recipe following the instruction almost exact.  I only used 8 oz of cream cheese because I had an 8 oz block.  I also used the pecan cookie pieces so I didn't have to chop them.  With the right tools these cookies are a snap.  As other reviews have mentioned the Pampered Chef tart shaper and the small scoop are a pure time saver.  I didn't roll the cookies in balls just used the small scoop then the tart shaper dipping it in flour after every couple cookies.  I do caution against over filling the cookies, luckily I have a great non-stick Wilton tart pan that everything just slides right out.  I was surpries when someone said they usually double the filling because I had about a 1/3 cup left over.

really excellent recipe.  A fun addition is to take a square of semi-sweet baking chocolate, melt it and mix in with the filling.  It makes for chocolatey, nutty goodness!

Great! I used just the filling and put it in store bought pastry shells. It tastes like pecan pie!

These are great but I used butter instead of margarine. There is also a tool available to mash the dough into the mini muffin pans. It is wooden and it looks like a miniature dumbell. Roll the dough into balls and put them in muffin pans. dip the tool in flour and press the dough down. Saves lots of time.

I have been making these for more than 25 years. Here are some hints: chill the dough before shaping and again before filling. Make sure the bottoms are covered thick enough so filling doesn't get on the pan and stick. For goodness sakes, do not add the nuts to the filling. What a mess that would make, put the nuts into the dimples before adding filling and drizzle enough filling over the nuts to cover. Try not to drizzle filling outside the dimples. Let them cool completely, I even recommend chilling, before trying to get them out. All it should take is the point of a sharp knife and they will pop right out. And yes, use real butter, after all it is Christmas!

I added 1/4 cup Bacardi Gold and 2 teaspoons rum extract to the filling, allowed the filling to sit in the fridge overnight to develop, and then filled the tarts and baked them the next day.  I took them to a cookie exchange as Rum Pecan Tassies.  You can also double this recipe, but double the rum and extract when you do. My girlfriends loved them.

I never baked a cookie from scratch before and these were my first attempt. They require a lot of love to make them and ended up taking me a good 2 hours for the 60 servings. My ending count was 80 cookies. These are so tasty and remind me of when my mom used to make them :-D Only difference I made was I used 2 sticks of margarine and 2 sticks of butter just because I wanted to save a couple sticks of butter for other cookies.

This is the best recipe for pecan tassies. Who knew they were so easy.   They have become a holiday favorite.  1 recommendation is to definitely refridgerate the dough for at least one hour prior to forming.  Thank you Carla for sharing a wonderful recipe!

I was very pleased with this recipe! I used real butter, a personal preference, and they turned out deliciously perfect! I even refrigerated the dough and filling and baked them a few days later. I just let the dough sit until it was just cooler than room temp, and I heated the filling up in a pot on low  until it bubbled. They turned out fresh and delicious!

This recipe is easy and delicious! I also used pumpkin pie filling with the dough (24 min at 360 deg) and they were fantastic, too!
So cute and tasty, a real crowd pleaser :)

The filling was delicious, but the crusts weren't too tasteful.  A little thick, floury, and boring.

These are very tasty and are always a hit at holiday parties. Use a mini tart shaper to form the dough in your muffin tins. It makes it a lot easier!

My husband would give this a 5, but I found the dough too floury tasting, wonder if adding pecans to the dough would have helped. The mix was delicious, just feel the dough needs something, cinammon, a little sugar, or nuts, or maybe all three?

I thought these were great.  I found this recipe in the cookbook I recently recieved. I used walnuts instead of pecans and they still turned out great. I wound up with more dough than needed though,  but will make more filling next time.  I made these for Christmas cookies this year,  I have always wanted to try to make these and am thankful that I did,  And I also used butter instead of margarine.  I find that using butter in cookies makes them so much better,  especially around the holidays when most people are not really counting calories.  Thanks again for sharing

I have been making these for 35 years.  Everyone loves them. They are bit tiring to make and they are delicate, but keep well in airtight bags and you can freeze them. A good giveaway, people always love them.

I have made these many times, but I always roll the dough out and use a small juice glass to cut circles. Then I put them in the pans and fill.  Works beautifully.

My attempt yielded 7 dozen with dough left over.  Per other reviews, I added more vanilla and salt and used butter.   Also I filled cups only half to avoid spillover.   I used my small (tsp.) scoop for the dough and I liked the uniformity that gave.  Drizzled with chocolate just for something different.  Tremendous and tasty wow factor here.

This recipe was wonderful and easy!  Very good-very easy-VERY RICH!  I made these for Christmas.  I actually doubled it, and all of them were gone within 2 days!!  On about half of them, I dropped in 2-3 chocolate chips into each cup before adding the pecan filling.  That was a good addition.  I will definitely make these again.
Also, in order to make the wells in the dough, I used the handle of my wooden citrus juicer and it was perfect.

I personally thought these were pretty good, but everyone else who had them couldn't stop raving about them.  I did overfill my tins with crust and filling, so they did not look very pretty.  However, I had people coming back to my desk at work the next day asking if I had anymore left.

Out of dozens of other cookies these were the first to go. The only change I made was using butter in place of margarine.  the crust was flaky & the filling stayed goey & rich.  thanks for sharing your recipe!

Yummy! Took a while to make the cup. I did as another suggested and took a wine cork, wrapped it in plastic wrap and used that to start. It's a long process so not sure how often I would make them but they are a great treat.

These are by far the best Pecan Tassies I've ever had.  I've always loved these little cookies but have never made them.  They were time consuming but very easy.  The dough is very nice to work with.  Made for my daughters wedding.  Two recipes yielded about 14 dozen.  Thanks for great recipe!

Made these last Christmas and they were a huge hit!  I was pressed for time, so I used phyllo tartlet shells instead of making the shells from scratch, which majorly cut down the prep time.  Make sure you keep stirring your filling as you fill cups, as my nuts kept sinking to the bottom.  A dash of cinnamon and nutmeg really perks up the filling as well!  Mine turned out perfect.  The filling from this recipe made a LOT, probably closer to 6 or 7 dozen using phyllo shells.

Great recipe. In a hurry, I used Pillsbury rolled pie crusts that come in 2 in a box instead of making this crust. I made the filling as stated except I used 2 cups nuts (3 to 1 pecans to walnuts) because I was short on pecans. They were really mini pecan pies and were a hit with everyone who ate them.

I thought these were a little doughy, but everyone else who had some loved them. 

I used mini muffin pans with paper liners, so I had to bake them a little longer than stated, but they looked great.  

Definitely be careful not to use too much dough!  My first pan of these didn't come out right due to overfilling the muffin cups with dough.

I found these to be delicious and have added this recipe to my recipe box.  The only step I added was to make sure to flour my hands when making the balls so I could press them into the molds without them sticking to me.  I also did not have a problem taking them out of the molds at the end.  Thank you so much!

Pretty good but had to make some adjustments. I made the balls of dough smaller than the size of a walnut (to allow more space for MORE FILLING-as another reviewer mentioned there wasn't enough filling), and used a floured mini tart shaper to press the dough into the molds. I also sparingly sprinkled pecans in the molds(1/2 tsp?). I'm glad I did because the egg white filling really does puff up during baking. I checked on the tassies after 15 minutes of baking at 350°F. Maybe it's just my oven but they were merely a pale golden color. I ended up baking them for a total of 22 minutes when the edges finally reached a light tan color. Nonetheless, they tasted wonderful. Definitely worth a try.

great tasting, the only thing i did different was to not add pecans to the liquid. i place some in the bottom of the tarts and pured the liquid on top. also i finely chopped some pecans and sprinkle them over the top this made them a little crispy.

Great for those of you who love pecan pie.  I first had these made by a great aunt.  They're precious to look at, and to me, make for the perfect holiday cookie...elegant, yet comfort food at the same time.  I have made these a few time, and I am suprised that some reviewers found it a difficult recipe to make.  I guess everything is relative, but if you're used to baking, I should think they'd be a snap for you.

These pecan tassies are SO HEAVENLY! My bf, who hates nuts, devoured these! I couldn't make them fast enough! And what I love best about this recipe is that I can make the dough ahead of time, put it in the fridge (wrapped in plastic wrap) and use it at my leisure. Tip for those of you who have weak electric mixers (like me), invest in a $3 handheld pastry blender... it makes making the dough so easy. =)

Thanks again for the recipe! It's absolutely wonderful!

I used half Crisco and half butter in the crust instead of what was called for in the original recipe.  It made for a much more flaky crust.  I have made these for years, but in my last move had lost my recipe.  Thank you for helping me find one that was close enough to use instead.  They made it the same and brought back old memories.  For those of you not pleased with the crust, try my half and half method, then don't overwork the dough.  They turn out wonderful!

Deeelish! A bit time consuming but the end results are worth it. Used 5, 12 count mini muffin pans to speed up cook time and with this recipe yielded about 78 tassies. Balled up the batter into lil balls that filled the mini muffin cups up by about 2/3rd. Then I used the lil water bottle cap method to shape the cups and it worked wonders.  Dusted them with some confectioners sugar to give it a bit more.

YUM! Made them for a potluck, everyone loved them. Not too sweet, and nice individual sizes. Followed the recipe exactly and turned out great! Just wish they were a little healthier. I might try to modify this recipe to substitute the butter and cream cheese.

These were great!  Loved that the cup/crust didn't have sugar in it.  I made them with raspberry Polaner All-Fruit for my type 2 diabetic mother and she was thrilled.  Also used blackberry Spoon Fruit and Apple filling chopped small (avail at my local market). A definite added item to my standard recipe list.

I have a recipe for Pecan Tassies, but couldn't find it...so, I made these for a special family party and everyone loved them...more than my original recipe! I will add, however, the baked cookie does look a little different than the others (I wondered what I did wrong)... but they taste very good.

Not what I expected.  I've had pecan tassies that are delicious; these are just ok.  I didn't like the consistency of the filling and I think it needed something else.  The dough itself was pretty tastless...as I was making it I kept thinking that there should be something else in it, but I still stuck to the recipe stated.  I think I'll keep looking for other recipes.

I love these pastries. I have made them for years except my recipe had chopped fresh cranberries in the filling. I lost my recipe, but now can use this and just add the cranberries. This year, I am using the PC tartlet pan and tart tool.
So much easier than using cupcake pans.

Just finished making this for the first time.  It was a trial run for my daughter's wedding - the groom's request.  It made 8 dozen instead of 5 as the recipe stated.  I have now ordered a tart press from pampered chef.  I think that will give the shells a more uniformed look.  Don't over fill the shells...it take less filling than you think.  Use a small melon baller to help keep each one the same size.  I don't really like pecan pie, but these have a nice flavor.  I guess in a few months I will be making a few hundred of these!

I'll agree with other reviewers that this is a very time consuming, labor intensive recipe.  And because of that, I don't think the results are 5 star.  These are OK, but not out of this world.  I used a small cookie dough scoop to scoop balls of dough into the mini muffin tin to keep the shells uniform.  I also had the pampered chef tool that forms the shells, but even with that it still takes a while to make.  And as another reviewer said, do not overfill the shells because the filling will stick to the pan and make the tassies difficult to remove.

Fantastic! I added an extra 1/2 cup of pecans (for a total of 2 cups) and also added 1 t vanilla to the crust. Make sure you don't overfill the crust- it makes for a sticky mess :) 
The crust is quite delicious, I've put other types of chocolate tarts and fruit cups in them as well. Keep in mind the tassies are a bit time consuming to make...

I have been making these for more than 30 years. I simply call mine "nut toffees." I always spoon in a bit of pineapple preserves on the bottom of the tart before adding the toffee mixture (which I make without mixing in the nuts) and then sprinkle my chopped nuts (pecan or walnut) on top. Use a mini tart shaper (a nifty little gadget you could probably pick up at Pampered Chef) to press the dough into the pan, saves a lot of time and saves your thumb as well. Delicious.

i took these out after 18 minutes and realized the filling was still wet.  i baked them again for 25 minutes or until the top was browned and the insides were still wet.  i didn't realize the filling was supposed to be as is until i went back to the site and read a review that said, "yummy syrup inside."  i was hoping i'd make tiny tarts instead.  still good though.

Yum, yum, good stuff!
I halfed the recipe just because I had a lot of other baking done. I also added a little maple flvouring. The last batch I added some dark chocolate bits. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will add a little rum just to try it....
Easy and good as is....it's just fun to tweak things. I also had dough left over.

These made me think of my precious Memaw.  She always made them at Christmas.  I inherited her handwritten recipe, but it got wet one year and is unreadable.  This is as close as I've ever gotten to her recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, but these didn't turn out well. There is not enough filling to even taste. What a waste of ingredients, and butter and pecans are not cheap.  Also, if you make them, use a LARGE not a MEDIUM bowl or you will have flour all over your kitchen.

How good are these.....there are no words! I love this recipe. You can also substitute peanut butter cups for the pecan filling. I love them both and they are a regular cookie recipe of mine!

This was very good, and everybody loved them, but  for myself, I thought some parts needed improvement. For instance, maybe something to make the crust/cup rise a bit (I like to push it in thin), and more pecans and less sugar - I really think sugar is over-used. Also, I've made this in another recipe where the filling got a little crisp, and I thought that was tastier.  However, this recipe is easier and is still a crowd pleaser. 4 stars.

Have been making these for years at Christmas and found a wooden dowel sold by pampered chef works perfectly for forming the dough in the mini pan.  Dust it in some flour between tassies so it doesn’t stick.  It will make everything go faster!!

Excellent taste!  The recipe makes way more than 60!  I use a wooden tool I got for my mixer to push food into the chute to press into the dough balls in order to form a shell.

Gosh, they are christmas cookie 'musts'!  I have made these forever and they go over well. I use a wooden press to press the crust into the mini muffin tins.  The cream cheese makes it so flaky that they are just delightful.  You make sort of a wall by using the wooden press and it  allows you to fill the shells with the pecan mix  - do NOT over fill or they will run out of the crust and be difficult to get out of the tins.  These are an absolute hit and have been for years.  Sometimes they are called Tea Time Tassies but I think those are 'walnut' rather than pecan.  Not sure. Just sure they are good

Tips: make the dough, scoop into balls using a small ice cream scooper, then chill the balls in the fridge while you preheat the oven and make the filing. Press balls of dough into mini muffin tin using the back of a teaspoon to form each shell. Dough makes 60 mini muffin size shells but you’ll have leftover filling. Use a toothpick to run along the outer edge of each tassie to loosen any melted sugars before turning them out.

I have been making my husbands moms recipe for forty years. I made this recipe today and I will never make mother in laws again. Hers always stuck on the baking pans and the filling always leaked. This was a perfect recipe. Not one of the seventy two I made stuck. My husband was very skeptical about me making a different one but I can’t keep him out of them.  LOL thank you thank you thank you for a new member to our Christmas traditions. I can’t wait for family to give them a try. Happy  Me!!!!!

These are one of my favorites! I followed the recipe exactly and I think they turned out amazing. I used my tart tamper to press the dough into the mini tin which I think saved me a ton of time. I also had to bake mine for 20 min before they turned golden brown. I hope they make it to Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.

After making this a few times.. I finally came up with my own wonderful version. Instead of the dough I use Phyilo cups. I pop the cups into the oven on 325 for 5 minutes. Then follow the recipe as is stated, however I also add a bag of "bit's o toffee" and 1/2 cups of extra chopped pecans. then scoop the mixture into the Phyilo cups and bake for an additional 12 minutes. Once done let them rest for 20 minutes. It honestly taste like miniature baklava cups.  This recipe is such a hit I have friends/family/neighbors etc started paying me to make several dozen for their family or parties.

If I was going to make this recipe again I would do a few things differently. 

1 - I would HALVE it. Because it was too much for my Kitchen Aid to handle without a lot of  mess. 4 cups of flour, 1lb of butter and 4 boxes of cream cheese. My mixer struggled with capacity.

2 - I would finely chop the pecans. I did a regular chop as per the recipe and it made for sloppy looking tops. I also had a ton of filling leftover that I ended up tossing. 

3 - something didn't go quite right with the crusts. They are gummy. So I would bake them at 375 degrees instead of 350.  I wonder if I did something specifically wrong. Maybe I made the crusts too thick? 

Lastly, this isn't a 25 minute prep recipe. 

I love tassies but this wasn't foolproof for me.

As many suggested, I used butter instead of marg. Spraying mini muffin tin with, PAM with flour. ( comes with flour in the PAM!!) Seemed to make it go very easy! I surprisingly didn't even have to chill dough. Dip finger tip in PAM and mold dough into shape! Was not frustrating at all! Great recipe!!!

These taste like mini pecan pies.  Sooo good. I halved the recipe because there are only 3 of us, and they are almost gone. Thanks for the recipe.

These were delicious. I made a pie crust instead of using the cream cheese one. I think the filling is already increadibly rich enough. Used mini muffin tin, cut my pie dough in circles with a biscuit cutter and molded them in a well sprayed pan. I also added about a tablespoon of cinnamon as someone else suggested. Made about 3 batches so far this Christmas. I suggest making them per batch instead of trying to double the recipe. All in all very good and will add to my Christmas goodie list!

The serving amount is way off.  Following the directions for 60 makes the tassies mostly dough and don't cook right or taste right.  When compared to a recipe I've used for years the amount of dough made would be for 96 tassies not 60.  An awesome product for shaping the dough in a mini muffin pan is The Pampered Chef Mini-Tart Shaper; it's awesome! 2 stars as directions say to make; 5 stars making it into more servings-the ratio is better.

Well I don't like to criticize but there's TOO much flour in the dough part of the recipe, I had to add a stick of butter to counteract it. Otherwise they came out delicious.

I have made these for years and these are great. Pampered chef has a recipe like this and they also have what is called a tart shaper to push down to make them. This saves so much time and it works so good. I don't remember how much it cost, but if you check out there web site I'm sure anyone can get one.

Very good cookie!

Don't overfill the mold or it'll be hell getting them out of the pan.

Also - I usually have to make twice the amount of filling per one batch of dough.

I made these at Christmas and everyone loved them.  My Mother used to make these when I was a kid and they were always a hit. I am not a big fan of cream cheese on or in anything but a bagel but it was perfect in this recipe.  Will make again.

These were an over all hit at my house. I used butter in place of the margarine. I never use margarine for anything.

My sister is the only one in the family who absolutely loves pecan pie. I make it especially for her every Thanksgiving. This was a great way to make individual pecan tarts without having to make a whole pie. And I think they go faster because of the bite size pieces. All in all it was a hit. I would make this again!

Just what I was looking for. Came out just perfect and the filling exactly matched the dough. I substituted sour cream (light) for part of the cream cheese and used Demerara Cane Sugar instead of brown sugar. The kids loved to make the little balls and squeeze them into the tray. Thanks!!!

Unfortunately I was really disappointed with these.  I LOVE pecan tassies, and these were so disappointing to me that I refuse to add them to my holiday cookie trays.  The outer cookie was very dry and the inside just wasn't what I was looking for.
