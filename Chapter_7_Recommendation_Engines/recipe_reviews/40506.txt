This is awesome! Even my super picky 18-month old loved it! The second time I made it I added a layer of canned black beans over the beef and added the chips and cheese on top with only about 5 minutes to go in baking so the cheese doesn't get over cooked... it is fabulous! I made it twice in one week....
