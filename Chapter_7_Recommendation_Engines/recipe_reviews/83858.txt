I've made this a couple times, only using a homemade dry ranch dressing mix instead of packaged. I find that using a homemade mix tastes much better than the pre-packaged mixes. I also use equal parts fat free plain yogurt, fat free sour cream and lowfat mayonnaise. If you don't have Tabasco, Frank's Hot Sauce works just as well. This is GREAT on taco salad as well as a dip for raw veggies.

This was so good, I omitted the red pepper though.  Put this over an iceberg lettuce salad with tomatoes, shredded cheese, chicken, black beans, corn, red onions, and tortilla strips!! Absolutely delicious! I used a big jalapeno though and it definitely had some kick to it!

I used buttermilk powder and wouldn't recommend it because it affects the consistency but the flavor is yummy!

I made this to have with homemade French fries tomorrow but I was having leftover pizza for dinner tonight and decided to taste test the mixture with the pizza crust.  After sitting about an hour, this stuff is already delish!  I had a small golf ball sized red bell pepper and I used the whole thing.  I also used an entire jalapeño sans the seeds and membrane.  I had an old opened package of Hidden Valley  Green Onion Dip mix so I used the rest of it.  I don't know how much was in there.  I added no hot sauce.  I don't know how much cilantro I added either.  I put the red pepper, jalapeño, cilantro, dip mix and a part of the buttermilk in a small food processor and whirled them all together.  Then added the rest of the ingredients.  This will be my go to ranch dressing from now on!  Thanks!

Good not great.  I'm sure it's because of the ranch salad dressing mix that this turned out to be just ordinary, despite the other additions. When it's all said and done this is still a ranch dressing made with ranch salad dressing mix.
