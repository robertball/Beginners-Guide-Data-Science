It seems as though it's not correct to put that much corn syrup in the recipe. though it tasted fantastic it was really runny. I followed the directions exactly. I would make this pie again but I would decrease the amount of corn syrup.

This pie is actually pretty good but very sweet. I cooked it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for because it didn't want to set. Then after it cooled it was a little too set. I probably should have only added 5 minutes.

Really tasty. Reminds me of pecan pie but obviously without the nuts. Very sweet. I'm definitely going to make it again but will probably try cutting the corn syrup as others have recommended. Try putting it in the refrigerator to make it set up faster.

This pie was delicious and a definite hit with company. Because the pie is so rich and heavy I added a meringue to the top to add a light and fluffy texture. Everyone seemed to love it. Meringue: 1 tbs cornstarch 1/3 c cold water 5 egg whites (room temp) 1/4 tsp cream of tarter 1/2 c sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla. Dissolve cornstarch in water- bring to a boil then remove from heat. Beat egg whites and cream of tarter on high with whisk attachment until foamy. Add sugar while beating constantly. Thoroughly beat in corn starch paste and then vanilla. The mixture should stand in soft peaks. Add to top of pie immediately. SO Tasty!

The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is so incredibly sweet. If you like really sweet chocolate desserts then this is a 10 star recipe for you. I took a previous reviewer's recommendation of cutting back the corn syrup which I did to 3/4 of a cup and it seemed to have the right consistency when cutting. I'm not sure if I'll make this pie again or not but that's just a personal preference because of the sweetness. The rest of the family seemed to like it.

This pie was SO GOOD! I made it for Thanksgiving and it got RAVE reviews! I can't wait to make another for Christmas (or two!) I did use only the 3/4 cup of karo syrup as recommended by others - so good!!

This pie recipe was pretty good. I did decrease the amount of corn syrup to 1/2 cup and used Wilbur buds. The Wilbur Dark chocolate I chopped up. Would make again.

Very yunmy but still very sweet even though I decreased the amount of corn syrup to 1/2 cup. I also used mini chocolate chips/cinnamon chips combo. Love the hint of cinnamon.
