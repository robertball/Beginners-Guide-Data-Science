This was really good and quite simple! We ended up cooking the pork chops whole instead of cutting it up (just to save time) and we used the sauce on the meat and the veggies. Will definitely make again!

The recipe is called garlic pork kabobs. In the directions it never says to add the garlic. I did of course but will never make this again. Almost no flavor to it. So many better marinades out there.

The kabobs were great.  I added seasoning to them before grilling.  The sauce was bland.  Next time I will make a sweet & sour sauce or teriyaki.
