Very good! Maybe a bit less cayenne pepper, but these taste amazing!

I liked the combo of sweet and spicy but these were a bit too spicy for me.  I will use much less cayenne pepper next time but that's just a personal taste thing.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made this dish yesterday and I have to say that with 3 picky eaters the recipe
got all thumbs up! Of course I reduced the cayenne pepper and instead of adding black ground pepper I seasoned with ground red paprika. From now on I am going to make it very often. THANK YOU!!!!

I used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil and halved the cayenne, added a little paprika, a little bit of steak seasoning, and rosemary. After tossing, it seemed like it needed more oil so I lightly put coconut oil too (I used 2 sweet potatoes). Baked for longer than stated; my fries were still soft but they were delicious!

These definitely pack a punch! After reading the reviews I decided to omit the black pepper only.. as it would add more spice. Also reduced the olive oil to 1 tablespoon and sprayed a foil lined pan with cooking spray. Mine cooked in 30 minutes. I would suggest flipping halfway throughout cooking to prevent burning, especially because of the honey. I ate mine plain,but I can see how dipping these in a cool ranch dip will help cut the spice.

I usually read all reviews before I try them but I failed to read these. I LOVE EEEEEEEEEEEE spicy food but this was too spicy. Maybe a little pinch of Cayenne instead. I'm on a diet so I was looking for healthy fries & thought why not sweet potatoes. But to put out the fire in my mouth, i dipped the fries in Ranch dressing. Works for my Buffalo wings so why not these. It was actually good. But just for future reference i know not to use so much Cayenne

Bring on the heat!  I had bought sweet potatoes  some days back and needed something to do with them. They went great with beans my brother had made and I already had all the ingredients at home. Thanks!!

Flavor was great but they came out mushy not at all crispy. Followed recipe exactly.

I just sprinkled a little olive oil and salt then roasted them in the oven. They were delicious and took half the time to bake.

The recipe says right in the name sweet and spicy... the people on here who say they love spicy food, but think a mere teaspoon of cayenne is too spicy... don’t actually love spicy food. I wouldn’t knock the recipe down for that. It’s like how Asian restaurants make even “spicy” dishes mild for people who don’t understand what spicy really means. Anyway, these are perfect! I normally put cardamom, clove, and cinnamon on mine when I want them sweet tasting, and use coconut oil. This recipe was nice, though! But don’t try it if you’re one of those people who thinks black pepper is spicy. It’s not. Try a mild recipe if you’re not into cayenne. These are great with ketchup or banana sauce, or more hot sauce ;)

After reading couple of reviews,  I went ahead and used only half the amount of Olive oil and 1/4 of the cayenne and black pepper. 
I lined my pan with heavy duty aluminum foil and sprayed with Pam. I cut my potato into 1/8 of an inch round slices to make it easier to flip them over during cooking. These potatoes took awhile to start browning and from there, fast to burning,  because of the honey. So stay near your oven in the last 15 minutes of cooking. Also, mine didn't crisp up, except the ones that burned little.. But , my family still liked them and I plan on making again this Fall.

Way too spicy! Should also mention that you should turn the fries over midway to keep from burning on one side.

I did not use cayenne, added some cinnamon and sprinkled turmeric and a tad of black pepper - delicious.

I'm with the others that said these were too spicy. I do like spicy food, but it was a bit much! Other than that, these were really tasty, and I will definitely make them again, just with less cayenne pepper.

Overall this is a great recipe, my children loved them. I gave it four stars because they are way too spicy for us.
