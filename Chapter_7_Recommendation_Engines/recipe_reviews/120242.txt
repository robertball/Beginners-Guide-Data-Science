Talk about simple!  I used a very lean 3 pound top loin roast with very little fat (had no need to trim any off).  I made the recipe just as specified...nothing in the crock pot except the roast and the recipe ingredients.

This thing was fantastic.  The meat was flavorful and fork-tender, as you would expect from a crockery cooker recipe.  The gravy was heaven.  I added about 1T of Wondra flour to the gravy after removing the roat, and whisked for about 20 seconds.  The result was a gravy to die for.  We served it over rice next to the roast, and everyone at table kept pouring more onto their food and saying, "Wow, I just can't believe how good this is!" with each bite.  

I've had bad luck with beef roasts.  This recipe is foolproof.

This was very good.  But I added 1 can of beef broth to this.  Otherwise it would be way too salty.  This way you have more gravy, too.  Meat was tender and very very good.  Thank you.

This was excellent.  Since my family likes a lot of gravy, I used an entire can of beef broth, in addition to the 1/3 cup of sherry and mushroom soup.  For extra flavor, I also added 2 garlic cloves.

We just had this recipe for our "Easter Dinner".  It was fabulous.  Everyone loved it. At first I was a little worried that the mushroom soup would make it taste like a typical mushroom soup recipe (the ones where you just dump mushroom soup over almost anything) but it was amamazing. No one even knew that there was mushroom soup in it.  I added an onion sliced and about a cup of sliced mushrooms to it.  I also made it in the oven on about 300 degrees for about 4 hours instead of the slow cooker.  I couldn't believe how tender it was.  Will definately make it again and again and again..........

This is similar to the one my mother in law has made for 30 years.  She uses 2 cans of cream of celery with one envelope of onion soup mix.  I rub the roast down with the soup mix and put the cream of celery soup on the top.  Thats it, no sherry.  Its so tender and moist!  I'll be making this for the next 30 years too!

Very easy. Many complained about the salt, so I bought one regular can of soup & one 25% reduced sodium can. Though, I never had any salt problems, it was perfect & I don't think it mattered what cans I bought. However, I did make modifications, an extra cup of beef broth for more gravy & I added pearl onions, carrots, 3 stalks of celery & some sliced mushrooms about 45 minutes before it was done. It only took 6 hours to cook & I sprinkled a little parsley on top & served with mashed potatoes.

This recipe was excellent. I added one can of golden mushroom soup (found at Publix), which made a huge difference. I poured both soups and the broth in the crock pot, mixed them with a fork, and then put in a beef roast and cooked it on high for ~8 hours. For new cooks: any large chunk of "stew" beef works well in a recipe like this one.

Excellent roast recipe.  We added onions, baby carrots, and celery at the beginning.  Served the gravy over mashed potatoes. Thumbs-up from everyone!

The flavor on this is so awesome, however, I am only rating it a 4 because it was a bit salty.  Perhaps next time I could try using reduced sodium products or throwing a raw potato in the liquid while it is cooking (I know this works for stew but not sure how it would work with a roast).  Otherwise very tasty and fork tender.

This was awful!  The roast was dry and the flavor was blah.  My husband barely choked it down.  I was looking for something easy, and this certainly was, but it was terrible.  In addition, it was an awful mess to clean up in the crock pot as the soup burned to the sides.

I layered sliced onions on the bottom of the crockpot before I put in the roast. Because I found out that I had only one can of cream of mushroom soup, I used one can of beef broth in it's place. I used red wine and my own homemade onion soup mix. I know it sounds like I changed a lot but we're on a tight budget right now and don't have extra money to run out to the store for special ingredients. One of the best roasts we've ever had. The gravy was a little salty but that can be fixed next time by using a different beef broth. Completely fell apart. NO leftovers.

Good, reliable, fix-it-and-forget-it way to cook a roast. I always dredge the roast in peppered flour first, then brown it on all sides in a half stick of melted butter. I use only one can of soup, white wine, and include the browned butter. Tender meat, flavorful gravy. The aroma has been making me hungry all day.

This is now my 'go to' recipe for beef roast or venison tenderloin.  Perfect every time and the gravy is heavenly.  I've omitted the sherry and used beef broth many times.  Also, baking in oven works wonderfully.

This is easy.  I've made it three times now.  It was salty the first time so only put in half the onion soup mix the second time and added fresh steak sliced mushrooms just before serving, WOW did that make a difference.

Followed the recipe exactly, and it came out fine. I used real Sherry (not cooking sherry) and did not have any problems with it being overly salty. Nice, simple recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Just made this today, and my husband said it was the best roast he had ever had.  Used 4lb sirloin roast, added 1 can beef broth, 2 cans mushroom soup, soup mix, 4 cloves garlic, and splashed in some pinot grigio (all I had at hand!).  A bit salty, so I will use reduced sodium soups next time.  Definitely a keeper!

Amazingly simple and delicious.  I was skeptical of not searing the meat first but it came out perfect just the way the recipe says.  I did cook it on high for 4 hours then low for a bit after that until we were ready to eat and it was fine.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Delicious!  I made it as stated using beef broth and the only change I'll make next time is to use lower sodium soup and broth as it was a bit too salty!

I followed the advice of the other reviews and added some broth, but it made it pretty bland.  It was still good and tender, but next time I think I'll try the original and leave out the extra broth.

I am a newlywed who admittedly cannot cook well, and I still managed a delicious meal for guests!  The gravy with this was great... just needed a little flour to thicken it up.  My only disappointment is that I am used to getting super tender meat when I use the slow cooker.  I wouldn't say this turned out that way, but my usband said that it was still really good.  Maybe because I used a sirloin roast instead?  Anyway, this was great and super easy!

Good recipe...the beef was tender and full of flavor. I dumped in some extra gravy before serving (believe if or not, a container of leftover KFC gravy!) which thickened the sauce.

This is a family favorite.  We eat it over white rice.  Always comes out perfectly tender and tasty.  Make sure you completely thaw roast first, otherwise it will come out tough.

I've been making this since the late 50's and it never gets less than rave reviews.  Might I suggest that you use good red wine or sherry, not cooking wine or sherry.  If you can't drink it, don't cook with it!  It will help with the salt content, too.

I really like this recipe! I cut the ingredients in half, since it only my husband and I eating it, and it still comes out perfectly. It is great for those days when he is gone all day and I don't know when he will be home to eat.

Super duper easy!  This is the kind of brown gravy I love!  It is a little salty because of the onion soup mix, but very delicious!

So easy.  I sear my roast first - just like it to be nice and brown when it comes out.  I took other people's advice and used 1 cup of beef broth.  Lots of gravy, the beef was so moist (I used a sirloin tip), perfect with mashed potatoes and carrots on this rainy night.  Thanks for the recipe Abby.

I have made this many times. My aunt gave me the recipe years ago! I don't normally add 2 cans of soup though and up the broth or wine. It does make a nice gravy to go along with the meal to. My only suggestion is to wait until it cools slightly and then use a large spoon to remove the grease that rises to the top. Leftovers are great to in a lunch.

Really terrific flavor.  Browned first and used a smaller cut of London Broil and one can cream of mushroom.  Thanks!  Couldn't be easier.

I made this a couple weeks ago. It was simple and fantastic, I don't think I made any changes and used the beef broth instead of sherry wine. It's really hard to mess a roast up in a crockpot. I liked my roast before this, but I liked the added mushroom and onion soup! The gravy was good..my daughters (who are picky) had seconds and thirds! I will make it this way everytime now!

I added the wine thinking it wouldn't make too much of a difference in the flavor.  I was wrong.  It was awesome!  My hubby said, " I don't know what you put in that gravy, but it is GOOD!" My new slow cooker 'go to' recipe.

This recipe was simple and tasted delicious!  I didn't use any sherry or broth, just the cream of mushroom and onion soup mix.  Recommend adding cooked egg noodles during the last hour of cooking, that way it's an entire meal in the crock pot and no need for any other sides!

Unfortunately, didn't find this nearly as appealing as others did, given feedack recorded. Used a nice inside round roast, which turned out surprisingly dry. Gravy was OK. Kids were happy with meal, but doubt I'll make it again.

The first roast I EVER made I used this recipe which was summer 2008. What I learned was with this recipe it ended up being very salty (and by very salty I really mean WICKEDLY salty) so I started to make my own modifications. SO what I usually do is: sprinkle the roast (lightly)with Montreal Steak Spice before anything else. I use 2-3 cans of cream mushroom soup (its usually a BIG roast due to big family with big appetites) with one can of cream of celery soup (I try to go for everything either fat or salt reduced). I mix up one package of onion soup OR alternatively chop up a smallish onion and put it in there. I mix all these "wet" ingredients together. Sometime I add in a little bit of garlic or garlic powder if i am in a garlic-y mood. Then pour it all over the roast and leave it for 6 hrs or so. Serve with either mini potatoes and veggies OR make hot beef sandwiches/buns (which is what we usually do with the leftovers... in the rare instance there is some).   If the gravy looks a like we don't have we usually end up adding "flour" water (to thicken or add more volume) or just water to help reduce the "saltiness" of this.

This was fantastic! And super easy! The pot roast was so tender it fell apart on my fork and just melted in my mouth. Has a wonderful flavor! The gravy was the perfrct compliment to my garlic mashed potatoes. Superb!

The gravy can be eaten all by itself it's so wonderful!  I pretty much followed the recipe EXCEPT I had to use a BEEF onion soup mix because my grocery store was out of the other.  I also used sherry.  So...if you're wondering how the sherry was with this...it's fabulous!  I don't get the negative comment about it being dry, no flavor, and burned the crock pot...because NONE of that happened with me...and I'm not that good of a cook.  Beef broth MAY be less flavorfull...and the cut of meat makes a huge difference as to the dryness of it.  I used a chuck roast boneless...and it was a bit tough...but it was totally the cut.  Yes...will make it again.  Too easy and perfect...lots of gravy.

Could use a little more flavor.  The liquid was so thin, there was no way you could use it as gravy.  Still, it was a pretty good way to make a roast.

I made this yesterday and my family loved it. I used 2 cans of golden mushroom soup instead of the cream of mushroom. My husband said it was the best roast he had ever had and the gravy was so good on mashed potatoes.

The first time I made this with beef broth It was amazing...I tried using sherry to get it to look just like the picture (the one with the burgundy brown liquid) and I didn't even come close. I've tasted roast beef like the one in the picture and it was heavenly, I would really love to know how to get it to look like that, and taste delicious..Could someone give me tips?

I have prepared this numerous times.  I do add a whole can of beef broth, but other than that the recipe is the same (simple and delicious!).  This is so easy to prepare and can be served with mashed potatoes (as an open faced roast beef).  I have also tossed it with cooked egg noodles for our sunday dinners.  I LOVE this recipe.

I tried this when we were having company, very very good. Served with mashed potatoes and peas. Froze two small portions for my man as I always make him frozen dinners (he is out of town two weeks at a time). Froze wonderfully too.

This is an excellent recipe! I didn't have enough time to cook it on low for 8-9 hours...I cooked it on high for about 6 hours, and it was incredibly tender and melt-in-your-mouth good! Also, I was out of cream soup, so I used the recipe "Cream Soup Base" from this site, adding some chopped cooked mushrooms to the soup to make my own version of cream of mushroom soup. I'm not sure if it was the same amount as two cans of traditional cream soup, but the end result was so delicious! There was lots of gravy, so I served this with mashed potatoes. Thanks so much for sharing...this is a super easy crock pot recipe that I'll be making again!!!

I've made crock pot roast with several different recipes and they were just ok. I wasn't ever a big pot roast fan until this recipe. This was the best pot roast I have ever made. I used a can of beef broth (low sodium). I made sure to have enough gravy for rice. My husband said this was the best pot roast he's ever tasted and told me he didn't know how I made the gravy but to keep this recipe.

Not a lot of flavor.  One of those staple comfort foods.  Add more garlic next time.  Otherwise meat was tender and falling apart.  Kids liked it too.

This recipe was great.  I don't consider this a roast beef (roast beef is oven roasted and produces a completely different product), but rather a brown gravy pot roast.  I added some hot sauce (equivalent to Franks) which gave it a zip.  When I make it again I will make sure to add hot sauce again.  It didn't make it hot but gave it another dimension that went pleasantly well to the overall taste without changing the brown gravy concept and taste.  A keeper

This was good, but not outstanding.  I added a lot more liquid because I added an onion, fresh mushrooms, and a bag of baby carrots. I then removed the beef & veggies from the gravy before serving & added cornstarch to thicken it up.  Served w/ garlic mashed potatoes, broccoli & hot, fresh bread.  
I may try it again when the weather cools off -- it is definitely a stick-to-your-ribs, comfort food meal.

Wow, the taste of the sherry really came out in this. Probably becasue the rest of the flavor was so bland. I'll stick to the old way of doing my roast.

This is the first recipe that I ever made in a crock pot.  It's one of my favorite comfort food.  No roast? You can substitute round steak in its place.  Hope to continue making it for another 20 years.

This made a great gravy and a dry meat.  I had a 1.5 lb roast and I only cooked on low for 5 hrs with a huge mess of vegetables and it was still quite dry.  The gravy saves it--I used white wine and homemade cream of mushroom soup and three cloves of garlic just smashed and tossed in. Salt and peppered the roast, seared the outside before adding to the pot (very briefly; I doubt this would've added to dryness).  Combined with potatoes, leeks, carrots, broken corn on the cob and thyme scattered about.  Vegetables were good but if it hadn't been for that gravy (added butter and reduced to thicken on the stove), the meat would've been a tough thing indeed.

This was VERY easy and I love the thickness of the gravy.  I did not add salt because of other reviewers saying the original recipe was too salty.  I am not sure if the fact I used potatoes and carrots made the diffence but it was not salty enough.  I will definately try again but next time I will ADD salt.  It was just a tad bland.

I have made this several times.  I omit the 1/3 cup of liquid, but I do add an extra can of mushroom soup (& black pepper).  This makes really good beef manhattans.

Made this for 7 people (1 who hates cream of mushroom anything) and everyone said it was heavenly...I agree. Followed the recipe to the letter but added an extra cup of beef broth because the gravy was such a hit I ran out :) Thank you for this great recipe!!!

The best!  I added some onion, garlic, celery and carrots.  My husband and my husband's friends, loved it.  In fact, I tried a little different recipe the last time and they noticed, then requested this recipe again.

I am giving this 5 stars for the simplicity. I thought the taste could use something,so I added garlic and onions. I used regular cooking wine. I also used about an extra cup of beef broth because I knew we would want extra gravy, so I thickened it with corn starch at the end. Overall its great tasting and very easy!

I made it once in the crockpot, I over cooked it so my bad. Then I made it in tented aluminum foil on a cookie sheet in the oven at 20 min./lb. and it was superb, everyone loved it.

The second time, I made a couple changes, but they're minimal.  I made an onion soup mix from this site and I didn't precisely measure the beef broth.  It might have been closer to half a cup.  This makes such a good roast and gravy.  Both times I've also made mashed potatoes and a green vegetable - peas, green beans, etc.  It's such a hearty, comfort-food, and super easy meat.

This is one of our favorites!! I use 2 cans of cream of celery, 1 can of beef broth, 1 cup of red wine, and add some minced garlic along with the onion soup mix.  The gravy is to die for!

There were NO leftovers the night I made this really easy roast. My family raved. I did add some roughly chopped garlic as well as some sliced mushrooms. Also, we like our gravy a little on the thicker side so a tablespoon of flour did the trick.

Very good!  I used a full can of beef broth and added 2 cloves of garlic instead.  I would've given it 5 stars, but I changed it around (thanks to some other reviews) so I can't say if the actual recipe was as good.

This was amazing! It was the first time I have ever made roast beef, I'm not a big meat cooker. But it turned out perfect. The gravy was terrific! I used about 1/2 a cup of red wine and a beef bouillon cube and a few cups of water as well as the two cans of mushroom soup and onion soup mix. It made tonnes of gravy, me and my husband will be having mashed potatoes and gravy forever!

This was a pretty decent recipe.  I added a full can of beef broth to have more gravy.  It does need a little something extra in the taste...maybe some garlic and pepper.  Otherwise it was pretty good!  I did add some baby carrots in with it and served it was mashed potatoes.

Always a good way to make roast beef. I also add additional water (about 1 c.) to make extra gravy. I like adding 2 cloves minced garlic too, for extra flavor.

I used one can cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken (thought I had 2 cans cream of mushroom) added the onion soup mix and used beef broth. Was a great meal with mashed potatoes, and french bread.

This is a great and simple recipe!! I added onions and garlic and used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of the cream of mushroom/chicken mix because I opened that can by accident - it still turned out absolutely delicious! I served it over mashed potatoes - perfect!

I used beef broth instead of sherry, and added carrots and cubed potatoes.  This is so easy, and delicious, lot's of flavor.  Have made this recipe time and time again on long work days so my family can have a good dinner.
