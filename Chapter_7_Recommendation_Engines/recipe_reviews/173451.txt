This recipe is fantastic.  The nutmeg really makes them stand out from traditional xmas cookies.  You can make these thin or thick and they are great.  When they are thicker, they taste just like those soft sugar cookies with thick frosting that you find in your local bakery.  This will become a tradition in my family as well.  Thanks for sharing!!

These cookies came out PERFECT! I followed the recipe exactly but for one thing. because of some unexpected things we made the dough one night. and didn't roll and bake them for almost a week later. I also took a few suggestions from Alton Brown's Good eats show and split the dough up into 4 sections before I chilled it then rolled and baked each section using powdered sugar instead of flour. I also used a set of 1/4 inch rolling pin bands so that the dough rolled even and to the right depth. Those made a difference too. They were a huge hit at my daughter's Christmas Party. However, I can't speak too the taste of the icing or anything because we simply dusted the cookies with colored sugar and sprinkles. and I honest thing they were perfect that way. I will definatly be making them again, maybe even with the icing.... oh my only negative, they spread out a bit more than I expected. luckily I was making retty basic shapes but had they been more complicated they would have run together and blurred the shape. but that's about it!

I was so excited to try this recipe, but it did not work for me. The dough never did get to the consistency of being able to roll out. I then decided to just roll the dough into balls and bake it. Well, I found the cookies to be very airy and they didn't have much taste. It was like biting into a tasteles air cookie. The frosting was WAY TOO SWEET. I made a different batch of cut-out cookies and used the frosting recipe, and while everyone loved the sugar cookie, no one would eat them once frosted because it was too sweet. Someone commented they could go into a diabetic coma after eating one of those cookies, (of course they were kidding, but still). I wouldn't recommend this recipe. Sorry, I was disappointed.

These cookies are just sweet enough to eat without icing and, when cut a bit thicker, so soft! I had a great time cutting Christmas cookies out of the dough. I will definitely be making these again!

I only made a half batch of the icing as I had some leftover icing in the freezer. However, the half batch was enoug to ice all of my cookies. I found the cookies to be slightly tasteless, so I sprinkled a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg and white sugar on top of the icing and that seemed to make them ore tasty.

If you take out the butter and use lard they are dairy free. If you take out the wheat flour and use rice/tapioca they become gluten free too! I have been searching for something like this since my son was diagnosed with allergies. 

To the people that had trouble rolling the dough out...
Did you flour the top of the dough and rolling pin. It makes a world of difference.

The cookies taste great, but were terrible for rolling out and using cookie cutters.  The dough was really sticky and I had to add tons of flour to make it work.  Then I had a problem getting some of the dough out of the cutters.  After cooking, they were way too soft and fell apart as I took them off the cookie tray.  Some of them even lost thier shape.  I cooked the next tray for 15 minutes and had somewhat better results.  If you want to roll and cut out cookies I would not recommend this recipe.

The dough is sticky but will roll out when chilled well and with plenty of flour on your counter, sadly they bake up puffy instead of crisp neat edges. Will not use this recipe again for cut out cookies.

They taste delicious but this is not the cookie cut out recipe I was looking for. I found the dough extremely hard to work with. It was way too sticky and hard to cut because of its gooeyness that I gave up and made little squares. Also, by cutting it 1/2 inch thick the cookies ended up being very thick and fluffy when baked.

These are great!! My daughter and I made the dough, and left it in the fridge over night and I took it out in the am and didn't actually roll till much later in the day and it was fine to roll. However, it is quite delicate. It cut fine and didn't stick. As for the frosting, I divided it up into four portions and we made four different colours. I put the cookies in for 6 minutes so they will be a bit soft rather than hard and crunchy.

I liked this recipe a lot. It's easy, and tastes great! However, I had alot of icing  left over.  Instead of refrigerateing overnight I  just put the dough in the freezer for about five minutes and it turned out fine. Qwick, easy, and yummy, I give it five stars!

This was a delightful different cut out cookie recipe from the traditional sugar cookie cut out recipe.  Loved the nutmeg and cinnamon taste.  Great to dunk in your coffee or tea.  Didn't even use the frosting suggestion, no need.
