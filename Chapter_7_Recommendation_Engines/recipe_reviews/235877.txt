I made this for Mother's Day, and everyone loved it! I've made it twice now (= The first time, I spread out the cookie crust on a cookie sheet. I used kefir cheese in place of the cream cheese. I used fresh strawberries - ~2 pints, diced, adding them to the margarita mix mixture and mashing them.  Both toppings were thinner than I wanted, with everything running off the crust. The second time, I sliced the cookie dough into 1/2 inch rounds, and placed them in an 8x11 baking pan. I left out the 1/2 cup milk, adding just the kefir cheese to the mixed pudding and 1 cup milk. I added extra cornstarch [1/2 - 1T], and stirred in the diced berries after the glaze thickened. I liked the second version better (=

I actually made this as cookies and used all kinds of fruit for the top.  My co-workers love it!  My boss actually did a happy dance when I brought them in.  The only thing was the cookies got soggy.  Everyone said they didn't care because they tasted like cake.  I can't decide if it was from the glaze or the pudding or because they sat prepared over night in the fridge.  The next time I make them I will probably prep the night before and assemble them before I leave the house.

Everyone loved it.  Made exactly as directed. The consistency was perfect.  I had a little trouble getting my cookie off of the pan in one piece- suggest lining with wax paper or parchment paper.
