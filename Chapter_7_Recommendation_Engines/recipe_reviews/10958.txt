I love this recipe. I have been making the same recipe only it called for Spanish peanuts instead of walnuts.There are a few tricks I have learned making this so many times. I melt the butterscotch chips first before adding the chocolate chips since they are more difficult to melt. I also cut the pieces up in little squares and put in individual muffin wrappers. It helps so they don't stick together. I have also put them in the freezer before taking to someone and they do very well. I make these for Christmas gifts and everyone seems to love them!

Easy, quick to make and divine.  Can't keep the family out of this!  Will make again.  Thanks!

This is made every year for xmas.  One thing I do change is add dry roasted peanuts instead of walnuts.  The salty nuts with the sweet chocolate is an amazing combo.

These are good! I did this in a large glass bowl in the microwave. All the chips  took about 2 - 3 minutes on high, you need to take it out half way through and stir it plus watch it so it doesn't over heat. Tossed in the PB, nuts and marshmallows - very easy! I put in pecans and peanuts.  My suggestions: this makes a very thick 9x13 panful - you might want to spread it in a jelly roll pan for smaller portions OR use less chocolate chips like 3 cups and maybe 5 cups of marshmallows. I'm using all salted peanuts next time!  Thanks, Uncle Brian!

Oh boy what a keeper this is!  Used salted spanish peanuts instead of walnuts to add a little salt to the mix.

First off these sound really good but as a true Minnesotan I have to call you on the name. A Nut Goodie is chocolate, maple, and peanuts. :)

This is an excellent chocolate fix for my family when we want a quick little something for dessert.  I've used cashews, almonds, peanuts and pecans in this recipe but my personal favorite is the cashews!  I made these for my daughter's school Easter party last year and the kids loved it!

Wow! Lots of chocolate and kind of a peanut butter cup flavor. My kids loved it but I think I like it better. Poor thighs!

This is a wonderful and quick recipe.  I lost mine and found this on the site.  I use spanish peanuts in mine and they remind me of the candy bars you buy in the stores, but better
