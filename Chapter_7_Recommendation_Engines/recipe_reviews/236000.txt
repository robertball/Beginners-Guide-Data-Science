I don't like Broccoli so I can't give this a 5 star rating.  I made this for someone else who liked it.  The Vitamix works great with this recipe.  The only change I made was not use as much onion as it calls for.  I just thought it would overpower the flavor of the Broccoli.  Try it!!

it was a great easy quick recipe with a surprisingly nice flavour (was a little weary of the broccoli and ginger together). I omitted the milk, and just used more broth (chicken). Yummy!

So easy, healthy, and delicious. I omit the potatoes and thyme and have experimented with different spices, including nutmeg.

Turned out great. Creamy and delicious. I omitted the potatoes this time. Only took a few minutes to make. Adding this to my favorites.

I followed the recipe but didn't like it at all. This recipe didn't have enough flavor. I would suggest first oven-roasting and seasoning the potatoes + broccoli. Then add some other seasonings in the soup... but overall, this just missed the mark.

Very easy, quick and tasty! I had friends over for dinner and several of them asked me for the recipe.
