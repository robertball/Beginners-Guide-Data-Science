Fantastic!!  If you like coffee shop mochas, you HAVE to try this (and I used to work at Starbucks!)  I made a single serving to test it out before making as gifts.  I used store-brand skimmed milk powder. Nescafe espresso powder, and light brown sugar.  It foamed up beautifully and there was no 'grime' at the bottom of the cup.  I agree with a previous poster that it needed a touch more sugar.  I added a single serving pouch of sugar (1 tsp) to my cup and that was perfect.   I will add some extra sugar to the mix when I give it as gifts.

I loved this mix! The rest of my family did, too. I did not have mini chocolate chips, so I used M&Ms instead. It was great.

Another great recipe from Allrecipes!  I ended up using 6 Tb instant coffee and 7 Tb brown sugar (had to adjust because coffee was strong).  Put the choc chips thru food processor so they would be evenly distributed, although the whole chips looked pretty in the mix.  Used Tasters Choice Vanilla Roast (decaf) and it was dee-licious!  Tied small whisks onto jars with ribbons and gave as Christmas gifts.  Everyone loved it! (whisking works, as well).

This was very good.  It just needed a touch more of sugar.  My co workers enjoyed it.

This is very easy and uses ingredients I always have on hand...After tasting I decided to add a little more instant coffee and mix all in the blender until powdery...When I was ready for a cup I put 1c boiling water to 3 heaping teaspoons of mix and blended until frothy!!!Love this recipe!!!Thx Amy Beth!!!

This was ok, but it did not have a chocolate taste like I expected, and was not very sweet.

I put all the ingredients in my food processor to make a smooth mix - even the chocolate chips. Worked well. I ignored the part about using a blender and just mixed it with a spoon. I thought it was one of the worst things I had tasted. THEN - I made it per the directions (except used part milk) and was quite pleased. Throw a piece of candy cane in the blender with it. Yummmm!

I am addicted to this coffee.  I have made the recipe with brown sugar and white sugar.  The froth the blender creates is great.

I was happy to find this recipe, as it did not include the non-dairy creamer. However, the taste was lacking. As others found, I too thought it was not sweet enough... easy to fix, add more sugar… though that didn't seem to fix it. So, I did as others had suggested and put the mix into the blender/food processor. The taste didn’t get any better and it still did not dissolve completely when mixed. There was a greasy layer on the top and it had a bitter aftertaste… I think it was the semi-sweet chocolate chips. Anyway, I’m sorry but this just didn’t taste good to me. :(

I don't drink coffee.  Ever--can't stand it.  But I made a jar of this for a coworker during the holidays.  She said she really liked it.  I made a small cup for the bf the same day I made the mix, and he wasn't thrilled but he said he doesn't like mochas much.  The amount called for in one cup is really not that much; if you blend it, it really foams up but when the foam goes away it's more like half a cup, so bear that in mind.  Thanks for the recipe; it was a nice gift for someone who does like mochas.

Very yummy!  I like a strong coffee flavor so I added 1/8 cup more coffee.  Instead of mini chocolate chips, I used cinnamon chips for a different twist.  Nice for afternoon coffee with friends.

I myself don't drink coffee but my husband thought it was pretty good.  I followed everyone's advice and put everything through my food processor first to grind it up and doubled the amount of sugar.  I also found that 2/3 of a cup of water wasn't really much of a drink so I doubled the amount.

I added the extra sugar as suggested.  Going to try to salvage the expensive ingrediants by adding more powdered milk, cocoa powder and confectionary sugar.  It was like water and I follwed the recipe exactly.

this is ok but i would reccomend not using as mush drink mix when adding water. i would only use half the recommended mix amount as i found this very thick. Apart from that it was fine.

My daughters and I made this recipes to give for co-workers gifts. We sampled before giving and found it delicious. We topped it off with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon which made it even better.

I may be just picky, but this was not that good as is... the mini chocolate chips did not melt very well and it was not very sweet (probably because the chocolate didn't melt). I did manage to save this by adding some unsweetened cocoa powder and extra sugar. I probably would not try this again though. Thank you anyway.

I thought this tasted great but even though I cut up my chocolate chips they never really did disolve all the way. Maybe I did something wrong. And it could use just a dab more sweetener.

Made this before but never tried it with chocolate chips.  I'll have to try that! Great gift idea, usually what we do for Christmas since money is always tight.  This, hot cocoa mix, orange spice tea mix, cookies, candy.

I didn't drink any of this, but made it as a gift for a few friends for Christmas.  The mix received rave reviews from them and was a huge hit.  The only change I made was the grind the mix in a coffee mill set on fine setting to help it dissolve better.

Read all the variations and decided to make this just as the recipe is written.  LOVED it, and so did the people I gave a jar to for a Christmas gift.
