I swapped coconut oil for the butter and used 100% whole white wheat flour, but otherwise followed ingredients and instructions. The cookies turned out quite nicely with a somewhat cake-like texture and crisped edges.  Make sure you give them plenty of time to cool before serving. They were a huge hit! I ate mine with a bit of natural peanut butter to add a little protein and saltiness to it, as that's my personal preference. If you also prefer a slightly salty and sweet cookie, I would increase the salt by a quarter teaspoon.

This recipe makes a very light and soft texture cookie!  Very good.  I did add just a pinch more salt due to the extra sweetness of the honey.  Great recipe!

The shortening was Earth Balance and with the honey, it seemed to be too soft and cookies had to cool before the became relatively cool. Taste is excellent, but it was a messy process getting them off the cookie sheet. Perhaps cooling the dough first would have solved the issue.
