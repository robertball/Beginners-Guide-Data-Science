These carnitas were amazing... very authentic flavor. Made them for a large crowd and they were gone like that. I modified a bit. I left the pork in larger chunks so i could shred. Added sea salt and pepper. My family like spicy so I added a few extra peppers and when it was done in pressure cooker i shredded it and put it is a roasting pan in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes to crisp it up a bit. Will definately make these again and again. Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe Korgilover!!!

Fabulously tender meat with a great flavor!!  I cooked for an hour on low pressure in a Cuisinart electric pressure cooker and it turned out perfectly.  We have so many plans for the left-overs.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I'm sure it's not proper or traditional, but I'm neither a carnitas aficionado nor a carnitas snob -  I used what I had on hand in the freezer to make this - pork chop suey meat!  And it was wonderful.  I browned the meat as directed, then threw everything in the Crock Pot. Nice balance of flavors, the meat was soft and tender, and the bite-sized pieces were perfect for stuffing in tortillas with some pico de gallo. The only thing I found this was lacking was salt!

As I write I'm in the process of making this PC Carnitas.  My adjustments, based on what is on hand are minimal. I'll make it per the recipe, but I seriously question matching the finished product with the leading photograph.  No hunk of pork smaller than the size of a football is going to retain its shape after One Hour of cooking at pressure.  I see a major disconnect here and I wonder if there are typos or perhaps the 'author' has never cooked it. At normal 15 PSI pressure cooking the directed 1.5" cubes of meat will turn to 'pulled pork about the 15-minute mark.  I'd like to have pieces of meat, not strings.  I cannot yet rate this, but I think the cooking time is a major overkill.

This was delicious!  The meat was so moist and tender I couldn't take it out of the cooker with a fork.  It was a bit spicy for my children, so next time I make it I will reduce the amount of chili used.  I did what another reviewer recommended and shredded the meat (which took seconds as it was so tender), put it in a baking pan, and placed in a 400 degree oven for a few minutes to crisp it up a bit.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good, easy to make and flavorful. I don't have a pressure cooker - so I seared the Pork loin before putting it in a crockpot, then added all the other ingredients...shredding as it cooked. I got a lot of compliments on how tasty the pork was - I hosted a Family Dinner, Mexican Style night and I got some of those just used to the usual "taco ground beef" to try the pork. They loved it! Great recipe, as is.

Great recipe! I wanted the pork to be a little more "whole" and less shredded to serve on top of rice, so I cooked it for 45 mins in the pressure cooker, and it came out perfect! My picky meat-and-potatoes, "hold the weird spices please", farmer of a husband loved it!

This recipe was so delicious!  I didn't modify it too much but I cut all the seeds and ribs out of my peppers (I was cooking it for children) and I omitted the coriander simply because I didn't have any.  I shredded the pork when it was done cooking.  We ate it on tortillas with guacamole for dinner one night, on nachos the next day, and then in quesadillas today.  This recipe is extremely versatile and definitely a crowd pleaser!

Delicious!  Followed the recipe closely, I only had one poblano, so I threw in one extra serrano and and an anaheim pepper.  It cooked up perfectly in the pressure cooker.  Served at a party with tortillas, guac, sour cream, and cheese... it was devoured happily.   Tip:  I did not enjoy chopping up a pork shoulder.  You may want to ask the butcher to do that for you before leaving the grocery.  Also, if you're wimpy, this meat was fairly HOT!  My house still smells like peppers a few days later.  I will totally make this again, and hopefully be able to skip the meat cubing.  Yuck!

Fantastic flavor and easy to make. CAUTION wear disposable plastic gloves when chopping all hot peppers. If you don't your hands may experience intense burning for hours after.  If this happens, soak them in HOT water (AS HOT AS YOU CAN HANDLE) for a few minutes followed by soap and more hot water to rinse. Yes, hot water will be similar to the burning, but will quickly improve. A little bit of burning may remain, but will soon be gone too. This really works well, I know because this happened to me. I know better now.

Great Pressure cooker recipe. After it's done just stir with a spoon to shred the pork. Great for making enchilladas. There is plenty of liquid left over that would probably go good over mashed potatos. Need to strain it for tacos.

I only had pickled jalapenos so I added a 1/4 cup of them, 1 tsp cumin and 2 tsp coriander. Other than those changes I followed the recipe. Fantastic! I was worried it would be too spicy for my toddler, but he loved it. I served it over brown rice. Tonight I'll use the leftovers to make enchiladas.  Thank you for a great pork recipe!

Amazing.  I made this for tacos for a large group.  I was so happy when I opened the pressure cooker. Perfectly authentic taste and texture.  I served the tacos with shredded cabbage, chopped tomatoes and lime wedges, to rave reviews!  I will be using this recipe again!

Not true Carnitas. This is more like a soup and when I removed 2+ cups of liquid it was more like a stew. It had nice spice but other than that it is horribly bland. I had to add tons of salt to the finished product. I imagine salting it up and frying it up afterwords would make it a truer Carnitas dish. I followed the recipe to the "T" but it needed lots of work after it was done to make it enjoyable. It was absolutely tender but true Carnitas are much larger "chunks" and you would pull it apart on your plate. I have NEVER had true Carnitas that were made with the chiles....those would be added later as a condiment. 2 stars because it WAS salvageable. All the 5 stars here probably have not ever had TRUE Carnitas. I won't be trying this recipe again. The picture IS NOT a true representation of the end product.

I wish I had a good review to write. I must have done something wrong. I followed the recipe but mine came out very bland. Almost no flavor at all. It was very tender and shredded nicely , but was pretty boring. Maybe I'll try again. This was the first thing I made in my new pressure cooker.

I also did the baking dish in a hot oven until crispy on the outside trick.  Also sprinkled brandy over the meat before putting it in the oven to crisp.

This was wonderful  The first time I made it I had never used my pressure cooker, so I cooked exactly as instructions said:  INCREDIBLE!  Then I got braver and started adding some of our favorite peppers, shredded the pork and added a can of refried beans for texture, omg this is an awesome recipe!

This has got to be the best thing I have ever cooked! Granted, I wasn't able to use a pressure cooker because the one I bought said not to use it on a smoothtop stove... but the meat was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH TENDER!!! This tasted like it came from a restaurant!

I've made this recipe twice now.  Each time it turned out great.  I definitely need to get a large pressure cooker though.  Last night when I made the recipe, I used a 9.5 pound pork shoulder.  By the time the meat and veggies were cut up, I had to cook it in two batches -- one last night and another today.  I love spicy food, the rest of my family can't really handle it.  I think this spices and minimal heat (if any) was just right in this recipe.  The taste of the meat sent me back through time to the little Mexican restaurant that my family used to go to every Friday night.  They had the best chile verde pork burritos ever.  Very similar taste.  The aroma while this is cooking in the pressure cooker is intoxicating.  The house smelled wonderful.  Everyone kept asking 'how much longer'.  My only 'regret' with this recipe was the fast cooking method.  If it had been done in the slow cooker, the house would have smelled amazing all day long. :) Thanks for the great recipe.

These were very good, I pressure cooked them for 30 mins and they turned out great, I served them with corn tortillas and lettuce, sour cream and tomatoes, because it was all I had...I didn't have all the peppers it called for so I just used a serrano pepper that I had, bunch of onions, garlic and spices, it was tender and flavorful!

I just got a pressure cooker and was looking for recipes to try. My husband loves carnitas and I have made them before by deep frying the meat in oil. ( not healthy or cost effective) This meat held the flavor though the meat and was so tender, I had to gently spoon it out of the cooker. Shredding it was awesome! I used a fork and pushed it down on top of each piece of meat and it just fell apart! Thank you for your recipe! I will be using it for years to come.

These Carnitas were awesome!!!  The only change I made was to omit the spicy peppers and made it with red and green bell peppers. Wow!!!  What flavor.  Thanks for the best carnitas I have ever had.

I made this for my husband and he loved them.  My mexican mother demanded the recipe. This was fantastic!  This recipe produces the unctuous texture and rich flavor of slow-cooked carnitas in an hour.

The second time I made them I didn't have any real garlic on hand so I ended up using the pre-chopped squeeze-bottle kind...worked out perfectly.

Well it was ment to be because we LOVED this! I was a little leery that it would be too much for my whimp of a hubby and it wasnt too spicy at all!! KEEPER!!

This was a great start to carnitas, I followed the recipe, and did brown the pork pieces well and sprinkled Cajun seasoning on it when browning. The smell was amazing.

I browned two large brown onions once the meat was set aside, with the peppers and garlic. Then added only 1 cup of beef broth, and ancho chili pepper powder- 2 heaping tablespoons, about 1/4 cup lemon juice, and then once the pressure cooker was ready only pressure cooked it for 15 minutes and did quick release. It was AMAZINGLY good. Thick rich broth, tender pork with good flavor. Too much liquid and cooking too long with yield tasteless meat. 

We made tacos with a tangy spicy cabbage slaw like our favorite taco shop. I will  make this over and over it was delicious. Thank you for the basic recipe.

made it with pork shoulder cubes the first time, and it was AMAZING. I never have coriander, so I used the cumin, ancho chili powder, a LOT of garlic (probably 6 or 7 cloves), and a Mexican-mix spice I got from penzeys that's called "Arizona dreaming" about a tablespoon of each. Arizona dreaming is a blend of ancho, onion, paprika, garlic, lemon peel, chipotle pepper, cayenne, and cocoa. I did shred the pork after cooking and bake at 400 for 15 min. then put back in the cooker and stirred to blend. the second time I made with boneless skinless chicken breast cubes and used chicken broth instead of beef. cooked about 40 min. high pressure. Also delicious!! good on tortillas, over rice, or over salad greens with some crushed tortilla chips on top

Just finished making these and they are absolutely wonderful.  I had never made carnitas before and just got a new fagor pressure cooker for Christmas this year...soooo this was the perfect first time recipe.  DH loves Mexican food!  Thanks for sharing.

Made this tonight. Great recipe. Was a bit too spicy so will seed the peppers next time and maybe use one less jalapeno. Will make this again for company in a few weeks.

This recipe was incredible!!!  This was my first try with a pressure cooker and the meat came out falling apart.  The flavor was unbelievable.

Fabulous!  So much flavor!  I rarely use my pressure cooker, so it was awesome finding such a gem of a recipe to help me be less intimidated by it!  I cut my pork into larger pieces for easy shredding, but skipped the review suggestion of putting it back in the oven for browning.  I only used one kind of pepper since big hatch chilies were on sale in my area.  I didn't have any coriander, so I had to omit that.  It was really great.  There was so much leftover liquid. . . I plan to use it as a base for some chili, but it would also make such a great stew.  I think next time I will purposefully add more broth/water so I will have even more leftover liquid for that purpose.

Just bought our first pressure cooker and was excited to try this recipe. We were a bit dissapointed though. While the meat was incredibly tender and juciy, it seriously lacked flavor. We ended up adding a lot of seasoning and spices after the cooking was done.

This is an excellent recipe. I've scaled this recipe for about 60 people and every single person LOVED it. There were no leftovers. It's also easy to add heat if you like more of that.

Fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was just soooo...good!  Thank you for such a lovely recipe. I served with white corn tortilla's, (as was suggested),  made fresh pico de gallo, tomatoes, onion, cilantro & lime juice, & a vegetable mix of shredded  cabbage (you can use a pre-packed coleslaw mix if you're in a hurry) added radishes, onions, and cilantro,  & then I tossed this with some sour cream & lime juice, S&P, and a little cayenne. I like the vegetable mix tossed this way, it helps keep all the veggies together in your tortilla.

These are amazing. I always add more jalapeños for heat but they are very rich in flavor and depth. I like to mix it up and add in boneless chicken thighs or a cheap cut of beef if the pork roast seems small for the group I'm feeding. Also, I add sweet peppers for color, or any hard vegetable like carrots, parsnip or rutabaga as well if I have theWe eat them almost every Sunday. I can't say enough about how fantastic these are. Everyone loves them and can't get enough. I even save the remainder of the broth and freeze for the next time. That way the stock from before gives it even richer flavor than just the beef broth would.

The only thing I changed was the cooking time.  I used my Countertop XL Pressure Cooker on the "Chicken/Meat" setting which runs for 15 minutes after reaching pressure.  I let the pressure come down without releasing the valve and the meat was tender and the flavor was great! Served with Guacamole and flour tortillas.  YUM!!!

Made this tonight and my wife, and I, thoroughly enjoyed!  Though there was no salt called for, I added 3/4 tsp, and still needed a bit more on the plate.
Served with fresh chopped onion, avocado, and sour cream dollops, over rice, and was a very satisfied diner!
Bravo to, "yellowpairs", thank you!

PS, cooked in a Fagor pressure cooker, under high pressure, for 55 minutes.  Used country style, bone in, pork ribs.  Delicious!

Freakin' delicious.  My modification eliminated the jalapenos, but only because I had a few heat-sensitive guests tonight.  In lieu of that, I added some chipotle powder and it was just perfect.  Thanks!

I do not have a pressure cooker but had all the ingredients for these carnitas.  So I made them in the crockpot and cooked them for a long time on low.  Wow they are great.  I served them with sour cream, cheese and tortillas.  Everybody loved them.

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time, it was in my pressure cooker. The second time, I made it for 15 people, so cooked it in my Dutch oven outdoors, while camping. It was perfect both times, and everyone LOVED it!

This recipe is amazing. I've made it several times, and have shared it with my mom, who makes it all the time, too! I notice that it definitely needs salt, and the addition of lime juice gives it another level of complexity. Otherwise, I use 3 poblanos instead of 2 (because I absolutely love poblanos), and I use 2 jalapenos and 2 serranos. To keep it low-carb, I serve it over a bed of cabbage...but there's enough broth that my husband loves to eat it more as a soup. It's so versatile - we make tacos out of it, throw it in eggs for breakfast, make sandwiches and casseroles out of it  - definitely my go-to for carnitas!!

My husband is very picky about his carnitas. I have tried a couple of other recipes and was not impressed. Until now. This one is a winner. The husband loved them. They were the right amount of juicy and the texture was amazing. This one will definitely be made again.

Delicious.  Took only 40 min. in the instant pot under pressure.     Added only one ingredient, half a bottle of Herdez tomatillo sauce.  We used this recipe in both burritos and soft tacos.  In order to use and hold as much of the amazing sauce as possible, we "muddled" it first, and some of us added a little rice.  We give it 4 thumbs up (actually 8 because we each gave it 2 thumbs up).

Very good.  I made a few minor changes, just due to what I had on hand.  I used pork tenderloin, and low salt chicken broth.  I didn't have a serrano pepper.  I browned large cubes of meat, then threw all into a crockpot, following another reviewer's suggestion.  On LOW 6 hours, very moist, very good.  I will make again and keep the changes, as I don't have a pressure cooker.  Thanks!

They tasted ok, but like someone else mentioned in a review, the cooking time seems to be too long. At 60 minutes in the pressure cooker, the vegetables in the recipe basically turned into liquid and the meat was overcooked and had the texture of stew meat that had been boiled for a long time. Overall, it wasn't bad, but I guess I was expecting something different based on the photo. I probably wouldn't make the same recipe again.

I cut 1 1/2 pounds of pork into 1 inch cubes and scaled the ingredients accordingly. Cooked in my Instant Pot at 45 minute which turned out juicy flavorful carnitas.

Lot of flavor to be had by using cooking liquid.  

Followed the directions but I cooked it only 30 min on high pressure with my stove top faberware pressure cooker.  2 inch pieces...I like carnitas shredded and firm to bite

Quick cooled under running water.   Removed meat to cool.

Strained onion and peppers out of remaining liquid, skimmed excess fat.   Returned liquid to pot and reduced by 1/3.   Added juice of one lime.  Salted and peppered to taste.  Stirred shredded meat back into liquid and cooked for 5 minutes stirring a little.

Pulled soaked shredded pork out of liquid  with tongs,  draining a bit and spread  on  large jelly. Roll pan.  Put under broiler on low,  let brown and firm up a bit.    Served.    Much more flavor!

I have made this recipe several times. It is an absolute flavor explosion! I like it spicy so I added a diced habanero and some lime zest. Other than that, I went pretty much as written. Top it with a slice or two of avacado and diced tomatoes and you can't stop eating these  tacos!

I thought this recipe turned out a bit bland but I didn't follow it to a tee either. I ribbed and seeded the peppers and skipped the Serrano. My girlfriend ended up putting BBQ sauce on hers. To me, it seems like a good start but needs more of something i.e. increased cumin and coriander.  Not sure. Maybe i screwed it all up by taking out all the seeds but that seems like it would be really hot.

Added: salt, cilantro & lime juice after cooking. 

Will cut down on the cooking time in my electric pressure cooker next time.  It almost turned into a stew.  Great recipe and easy to follow.

I did make a few changes....my daughter does not like too much chili heat.  I left out the serrano chili and it was still a little hot for her.  next time I will reduce the jalapenos to two.  I also found that too much of the liquid had cooked off so I will increase the beef broth to cover the meat mixture before pressure cooking it.  I will definitely make this again.

These were a big hit at a party! I had none of the peppers the recipe called for, used the leftovers of bell peppers I had instead. Seasoning was spot on! Can't go wrong with these.

Not quite spicy enough for me and I don't like hot, spicy foods.  I added some ground chipotle pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt and pepper to taste as I shredded it after cooking.

This is the best.  It doesn't get dried out like I've found to be true with slow cooker carnitas recipes.  I made it exactly as written with one minor change  -I used boneless country ribs and kept them in the whole strips (mostly, after cutting out the excess fat).  This made it easier to separate out the meat at the end.  We  didn't eat the peppers or anything.  That's not traditional, they didn't look appetizing as they were totally spent, and my kids wouldn't have liked it.  As it was, it was just a tiny bit spicy on the back side of it (if you know what I mean).  It was enough for my husband and I to appreciate the nuance but not too much for my kids, one of whom does NOT do spicy, to object to.  She noticed it but didn't complain.  After literally decades of doing carnitas in the slow cooker, I will never be going back.  This is going to become one of our favorite repeat recipes.

I opted to use one of our own (russellfamilyfarms.com) fresh hams (unsmoked, uncured) instead of the boston butt due to us being out of them. I was skeptical about how this change would affect the outcome of this recipe beings that the boston butt is fattier than the hams. I can't say how the boston butt would've turned out, but I can tell you that our fresh ham carnitas were hands down the very best we've  ever had. I highly recommend this recipe especially with fresh ham!!!!

Very easy to make and the pork came out super tender.  However this was so bland I had to add about 2 -3 tablespoons each of cajun seasoning and adobo seasoning after it was finished cooking to give it some flavor.  It definitely needs some salt or other seasoning added to the ingredient list.   But very tasty - will make again with some extra seasonings. for flavor.

YUM!!!  I love authentic Mexican, and these were delicious!  I can't really buy decent MExican food anywhere in my area, so this is great to have this easy, make at home recipe.  I went for the full spice, and it was just the way I like it.  I would recommend cutting back on the peppers and their seeds if you don't like spicy.  Otherwise, simple and delicious!!!

Great if you brown the portion in the oven that you are going to use right away.  I believe the leftovers will be great when we brown them for Tuesday night.  Pressure cooker Spanish rice and peruano beans.  The homemade salsas one green one red made the meal.  We used hatch chilies from our freezer in the meat and both salsas.  I hope I can buy two cases of roasted hatch chilies later this year.  The salsas were great because the tomatoes and tomatillos were from last years garden and stored in the freezer. Both pressure cookers had a workout today.

This was the first recipe I ever tried in my pressure cooker and I was very happy with the way it turned out, even though it was a bit bland.  I was a little alarmed at the 1 hour time in the cooker so I turned down the heat a bit.  The pork cubes came out well cooked and very tender.  I wasn't sure about what to serve it with so I made rice, which complemented it nicely.  In the future I will make a point of trimming  a bit more of the fat off the pork, but that was a minor issue.

I made this recipe exactly as is except I removed the seeds (that kept the complex flavor profile but reduced the heat a bit). It was delicious. It turned out tender and tasty and not greasy or mushy like a crock pot. I have made it in the oven before with mixed results. This is just so darned easy. Thanks for sharing.

Used pork loin roast and it was still very tender. Tossed the pork cubes with ancho chili powder and smoked paprika before browning.  Made this many times and it's always awesome!

Best carnitas I have ever had! Topped them with cilantro, cheddar cheese, thin sliced cabbage, avocado, squirt of lime and a little salsa! YUM!

This worked out beautifully.  We used larger chunks so we could shred the meet after cooking as another review suggested. After we shredded the meat we broiled in the oven for 15 minutes turning the meat over ever 5 minutes and it turned out crispy and tasted great. I served with guacamole and fresh salsa with corn tortillas for a simple but delicious dinner. I will make this again for sure!

This is a home run even before you fry it up for carnitas or use it as a base for chile verde or add bbq sauce for pulled pork sandwiches.  I have experimented with different cook times for different textures and have always been extremely pleased with the results.  Be sure to add a bit of salt and pepper before cooking for maximum flavor. Thank you so much yellowpairs!
