I did make this with butter rather than shortening, but otherwise I followed the recipe for this.  This is a nice, basic banana bread, and I know that the family members who will eat this will love it warmed up with some butter slathered on it!  Thanks, MAGDIEGO!  EDIT  I think this could be missing a touch of salt!  That could make the difference for me.

This banana bread was delicious.  The only thing I will change next time I make it is to reduce the amount of sugar.  It was way too sweet for me.

Wow!  is this ever a good recipe!  Moist but not too heavy.  I added 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips to the batter and now my son is totally addicted!  lol.

01.31.17 ~ Needed to use up some buttermilk, found some bananas in the freezer and needed fruit breads for school. This recipe fit the bill for all three. This bread came together quickly and was in the oven in no time. I made three small loaves rather than one large loaf. Bake time is about 40 minutes. The bread is moist and delicious. I will be using this recipe again.

I only added about 1.5 cups of flour and added about half a bag of chocolate chips. I also didn't sift the flour combination (don't own one) and it turned out good!

I added a little more spice with nutmeg and cloves.  Few walnuts mixed in and on top.

Very nice! The bread was moist, despite substituting the shortening with applesauce for less calories. The cinnamon is a plus.

Delicious!  I used very ripe bananas.  I didn’t have shortening, so used softened butter.  Followed the rest of the recipe as written.   My entire family loved it.  Will make it again and again!

This was very good. The charity we donated 4 loaves to raved about how great it was.  The only change we made was chocolate chips and walnuts were added right before baking.

Love the addition of the buttermilk. I used a stick of butter rather than shortening. I also added raspberries. I found the cooking time to be 1 hour 15 at 350. Very moist!
