Like another reviewer suggested, I doubled the recipe for the sauce.  I decreased the lemon juice two tablespoons since I like the sauce sweeter. The first time I used a glass baking dish and the sauce stuck so the second time I foil lined the dish to make clean up easy.
I used 1lb. boneless ribs. Before baking Ipierced the meat witha  fork and marinated the ribs with meat tenderizer, onion powder and garlic powder. After baking uncovered 40 min. I uncovered them and brushed the sauce on then cooked for an additional 10 min.  They were tender and perfectly cooked. I would check them with a knife at 1 hour to see if yours are done.
Next time I'm going to pre-marinate them with the spices and half of the sauce to get the flavor of the sauce through the ribs.

Omigosh!  This smelled sooooo good while I was just whipping up the glaze!!!  We couldn't wait to eat.  The glaze was not over-powering but had enough flavor to make your tastebuds cry for more.  I actually doubled the recipe for the glaze because I knew I'd want it more heavily glazed and I'm glad I did.  Great, simple...items on hand kind of recipe.  Try it...it won't disappoint!

VERY yummy! My husband thought this was wonderful! The recipe was soo easy too! I actually tripled the ingredients for the glaze- I put the ribs in the oven right away, mixed the glaze and then did a thorough glazing after the mixture was done. After about an hour I pulled the ribs out of the oven, drained the liquid from the bottom and then smothered on some more glaze. When there was about 15 min left in cooking time I added some more glaze mixture. YUM!

Maybe I'm the only one that has tried these on the grill...  I doubled the marinade - half with the oil for basting the other half for dipping afterwards.  I baked the ribs in the oven first at 350 for an hour and than put them on the grill to baste.  They were more like Chinese BBQ spare ribs especially with the extra dipping sauce.  They were very tender.  I made cornbread to go with them, but next time I think it will be potstickers & rice.........

Loved this recipe.  Easy to do, not too many ingredients and big taste.  I would only suggest that if you have more time bake the ribs at a lower temperture, for fall off the bone ribs.  I made these for a picnic and several friends commented that these were the best ribs ever.

Delish!  (But, get a good quality rack o' ribs!)  Had just under 3 pounds.  Doubled the sauce, (except lemon juice - only used 4 tbs lemon juice) and used Penzey's Black & Red (cayenne / black pepper) instead of paprika, and Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle (oregano, garlic, basil & thyme) instead of oregano.  I didn't drain the sauce, but basted SEVERAL times after the first covered hour of cooking.  Took a bit longer to cook, but so worth the wait.  Sprinkled my portion with more cayenne.   Line your pan with foil!!! I'll be soaking mine for DAYS.

These were delicious! I was a little nervous, because I had cheap ribs that had been sitting in the freezer for a bit, so I wanted to make sure the sauce was good enough to make up for that. I shouldn't have worried. The flavor was wonderful and the meat was tender and pulled off the bone easily. My husband took a bite, and looked at me with an incredulous look (like 'you made these?!') and then went on to devour a whole slab!

Awesome.  I tried this recipe since I had never attempted to make ribs before and my husband loved them so much that I'm making them again tonight!  Very easy, fills the house with a great aroma.  I sprinkled salt and pepper on the ribs before baking.  I also doubled the recipe for the glaze and after baking for an hour, brushed glaze on the ribs every 10-15 minutes for a total of 45 minutes.  Thank you for this delicious recipe!!!

Loved this dish!  I had my Mom over for dinner (she can be a bit picky) and she loved it.  She even asked for the recipe for the glaze.  I only prepared about a pund and a half of ribs and still wished I would have double the glazed.  I did season the meat a bit before I put it in the oven with salt and pepper.

This was great - I skipped the oil just added from what I was draining.  It did smell really good and my husband said this was a keeper.  Thank you so much!

I decided to try this because of the favorable reviews. When I made the glaze, I didn't think it looked good. I tried a bit of it, and it wasn't good, but I had faith in everyone's reviews, so I went ahead and followed the recipe faithfully. I'm really glad I did because it was great!!

This is not a really saucy ribs recipe. When my husband saw this, he seemed a bit disappointed. Then he tried it. This is the only barbecue ribs recipe he will let me use! I love that I always have the ingredients onhand. I think I've made this three or four times already. It's my staple. Love it. Thanks!

I wish I had read the reviews first as well!  Even as I was making the glaze, I'm thinking too much lemon juice.  Will try again with some tweaks coz I see the potential with these ingredients.

I made this for my hubby for fathers day!  it was a hit!  Like others suggested I doubled the sauce.  I would also make sure that you cook it on foil as it stuck really bad to the bottom of my pan.  we will for sure be making these again.

The recipe itself is delicious, and I'd give it five stars except I had to modify it slightly. I made one batch of the sauce, put it in with the ribs - covered - and cooked at 300 degrees for two hours. I made a second batch, cooked the ribs uncovered for an additional hour at 350, basting every 10-15 minutes. Falling off the bone when they were done. My father (notoriously unimpressed with most foods) loved it.

Did not like the sauce at all! I followed the recipe exactly & doubled it cause there wasn't nearly enough. I think it was too much lemon juice, it was too tart tasting. Soo glad I had a bottle of good BBQ sauce to save my ribs....I will not use this again, & I hardly ever give bad reviews!

Not bad...this is not a sweet barbecue so don't think in terms of sweet and tomato flavour. It's more like a southern vinegar based barbecue. I put one cup of water in with the ribs at the start to steam them tender . I  didn't have enough lemon juice (I tripled the sauce) and subbed raspberry sherry vinegar. Next time I think I'll double the honey though for a little more sweetness.  When it was time to baste...I did  baste the ribs to start but dumped all the remaining sauce into the pan, turning and basting the ribs every 15 minutes until they were done.

Disappointing... after looking up this recipe I couldn't wait to try them after all the great reviews. Unfortunately I was completely disappointed and am writing this in the middle of dinner because I am so bummed. I doubled the glaze recipe like others suggested the only thing I did different was used regular onion instead of instant minced which should not have made a difference. Not sure why everyone else thinks this is just to die for, thankfully our company cancelled last minute otherwise I would have been totally embarrassed. Not worth wasting ribs on in my opinion, would have been a thousand times better with just Sweet Baby Ray's on them!

These were very good.  I baked them more slowly at 300 degrees for 2 hours.  They were fork tender and delicious.  The easiest rib recipe I've ever tried.

The sauce was excellent. Unfortunately the ribs I had were not the best quality, but the sauce was so good that it didn't matter. We had a lot left over so I pulled the meat off the bone the next day for barbecue sandwiches and it was delicious with a little more of the sauce. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is a wonderful way to cook ribs-they turned out so tender and juicy.  I did not like the sauce however.  We had a bottle of BBQ sauce on the side.  One great tip though-ALWAYS pull off the shiny membrane that you find on the bone side.  No matter how long you cook your ribs, this membrane will always be chewy, so get rid of it.

I must have done something wrong as these came out really dry.  They looked good when they were covered and then once I took the cover off they were dry and crusty.  The sauce was tasty so maybe I'll try it again and leave them covered the whole time.

I followed all the Most Helpful reviews. Doubling sauce, roasting dry ribs with the garlic and tenderizer... lessening the lemon juice.  It was fantastic!  I cooked them covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 45 minutes.  Yum Yum!

I could not give it a 5 because, as usual, I made a couple changes.  I don't like dried seasonings if I can get fresh so I used a fresh red onion (about a 1/4" slice) and two fresh garlic buds, finely chopped together with the oil, in my chopper. I then added a small dribble of molassas, put in the rest of the ingrediences and heated it my microwave (for about 3 minutes) right after I popped the ribs in the oven. I then followed the rest of the recipe.  WOW!!!!!! Were these good!!!!!!

These were very good, and easy to make with ingredients I keep on hand (other than the ribs, of course). They were a nice change from traditional BBQ flavor. I'd give them a 4 1/2 if I could (but I can't).

I am not a huge fan of pork but this was tasty! I had to prepare this dish the night before so I doubled the glaze as others suggested and marinated the pork in half of the glaze overnight. The next day I placed it in the oven and followed the recipe from there. It was very tasty all throughout!

Very delicious! I just wish there was some way to get more of the flavor into the meat, rather than just on the outside.

Made these for my family- absolutely loved them! The amount of flavour was ok, but when I make them again, I'll definitely double the recipe.

This recipe was ok. I followed the recipe exactly but I felt like it was lacking something. I can't put my finger on it however, if I would make this again I would add hot sauce or something to give it a little zip. Still we didn't like it enough to make it again.

So yummy! I made the maranade ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge 2 hours before using it. I did not add the oil, and doubled everything else. I also used 1 tablespoon agave nectar instead of honey. Baked the ribs covered in foil for 1 hour at 350, then uncovered and put the glaze on for another 20 to 30 min. So good, my whole family, even my picky picky youngest loved it!

I'm surprised at the high ratings. I would give it a 2.5. I followed the recipe, except I didn't have a rack to put them on in the roasting pan. They came out bland and a little dry and did not fall off the bone. Perhaps a lower heat for a longer time? I'll try a marinade, crock pot or grill the next time I attempt ribs.

I goofed the recipe up (forgot to cook covered) and didn't follow amounts or times, (which I don't recommend) but I'll post my "procedure" to let you all know they still turned out 5 stars!: Doubled the sauce recipe for 4 lbs of meat. Cooked uncovered for 50 minutes in two 9x13 glass dishes. Drained fat. Poured ¾ of the sauce. Cooked another10 minutes uncovered. Poured remaining ¼ of sauce on meat. Cooked covered for15 minutes. Doubled glaze again, adding 2 tsp molasses. Poured half of second glaze on meat. Left off foil, Cooked for another 15 min uncovered. Used remaining glaze as dip. It's not necessary to make as much glaze as I did. Next time I will just triple the glaze for 4 lbs and cook longer for fall-off-the-bone meat. My husband thought the soy sauce made the house smell badly, but he raved when he tasted these!

Definitely a great change of pace from our usual bbq ribs. I agree with other reviewers though about doubling the glaze and cooking slightly longer at a lower temperature.

The sauce is excellent although I do not like dried onion. The next time I think I'll saute real onion in the oil but otherwise follow this wonderful recipe exactly.

Great! My husband doesn't usually like ribs but he complimented on this recipe and asked me to do it again.
