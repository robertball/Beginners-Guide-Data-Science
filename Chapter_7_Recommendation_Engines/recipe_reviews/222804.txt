Pretty savory crepes...I liked how well they cooked on my little crepe maker.  Added fennel instead of caraway since they come from the same family but fennel is a little sweeter.  Mixed all in a blender...wonderful.

Instead of making it Indian Crepes, I just made they regular crepes and spread on peanut butter, chocolate, banana. Mine didn't get the  bubbles. 4 min each for each crepe
