I started out as written but knew that 1/2 cup of alcohol wasn't going to be near enough for 8 cups of milk/cream. You need to double the amount of alcohol at least. As written it just tasted like sweet milk. I would also probably only use 8 eggs next time but that is just me. Over all this was a decent recipe and it was easy but just plan on doubling (or tripling) the amount of booze.
