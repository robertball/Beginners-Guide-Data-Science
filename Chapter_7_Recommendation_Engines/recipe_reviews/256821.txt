This is the author. You really need to cook the onions till it is a bronze brown colour. If you do not, it will not have a depth of flavour. Spices will not really replace that. Hope that helps!

I halved the recipe and used four large onions and the onion flavour didn't come through. I believe that the ratio of liquid to onion is off and it needs seasonings, salt and thyme perhaps. The onions took a good 40 minutes to caramelize with the sugar added.   I really dislike leaving a bad review but this didn't appeal to us.
