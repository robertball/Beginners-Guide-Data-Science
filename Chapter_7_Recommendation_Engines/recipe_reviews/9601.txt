I made these, and instead of using 2 9x13" pans, I used a cookie sheet with sides. It makes more of a bar shape, and they were great.

Wonderfull!  I used 2 cups whole wheat flour instead of white.  I only put in 3 eggs and used apple sauce instead of oil.  And only used 1 1/2 cups sugar.  Turned out great.  I also baked it in a cookie sheet with sides.

These pumpkin bars are very light and tasty!  since I don't eat sugar, I used 1/2 tsp. Stevia, a rice extract found at Health Food Stores in place of sugar.  Also substituted oat flour for white flour and added 1/2 c. raisins.  
Bars are delicious frosted or un-frosted.  I couldn't find my old recipe and was delighted to find this website!  Thanks so much for taking the time to submit it!!

Amazingly simple and delicious! Make sure that you have one after it cools and right after you frost it.

Great with the Pumpkin Bar Icing from this site. 10 stars!

Yummy!!  Split this recipe in half and substituted cinnamon applesauce for the oil and added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon...yum, yum!!  Used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site to ice.  Delicious.

I LOVED this recipe.  I did use a cookie sheet and replaced the cinnamon with pumpkin pie spice.  I did not have any cream cheese frosting so I just used a glaze and the kids ate them right up.

I have been experimenting with different pumpkin recipes and this one is it. I just took it out of the oven and smeared a warm piece with salted butter to test it - then another and another, I had three pieces! Perfect treat for a cool autumn day with a nice cup of tea.

This recipe is great (especially with cream cheese frosting)--though it is more like cake than bars.  I made it in a 9 x 13 pan and also in a jelly roll pan.  Didn't have walnuts, so I used chopped pecans and also dropped some pecans on top of the iced bars, which added some nice taste and crunch.  I agree with adding more spices--nutmeg, cloves, ginger, etc.  The sugar can be reduced some, or some brown sugar substituted for a little of the white.  I plan to make this again.

These were very good.  Again, I did the same thing.  I didn't have a jellyroll pan so I used a 9x13 pan and it turned out more cake like but still very good.  There is some kind of flavor missing from the actual pumpkin bars, I might try again and add some other kind of spices.

This is a real simple recipe to prepare, 
and it tastes great.  The cream cheese frosting
makes it extra special!!  These pumpkin bars will 
disappear as quickly as they were prepared!!

I'm giving this a four because I think it's a good starting point.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and had pumpkin cake, which I wasn't thrilled about.  The next time I made it, I halved the powder and soda, used a little less sugar, subbed half the oil for apple butter and doubled the pumpkin.  The second batch is to die for.  They're dense and moist and delicious.  Both times I made them, I used one 9 x 13 and one 11 x 7 pan.

Pumpkin BARS?  They should be called "Pumpkin Cake." I followed this recipe exactly - except I used pumpkin pie spice rather than cinnamon, and I chose to bake this in a jellyroll pan (because it said "pumpkin BARS").  Don't do that - if you choose to make this, use a regular cake pan.

very tasty, although I did not follow this exact recipe.  like some people, I had been craving more of a bar, rather than a cake-like recipe.  I only did half a recipe, but I also halved the baking soda and baking powder, added a splash of vanilla extract and added 1 tsp pumpkin spice, plus extra cinnamon.  came out dense and moist!  added pumpkin bar frosting from this site.

Very good. Definately need a glass of milk w/ them. Did not have cream cheese frosting. Melted some white chocolate and drizzled over the top. Came out great.

This is sooo good!  I added 2 tsp of pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon, and added some vanilla extract as well. I baked the whole recipe in one cookie sheet with sides, and only baked for 20 minutes, instead of 25 minutes, and it came out perfect! I frosted with some basic cream cheese frosting, spiced up with some cinnamon and vanilla extract, at the end.

Excellent!!   Only change I made was leaving out the walnuts.  we doubled the recipe and made two 13x9 pans.  The consistency once cooled was much a like a moist dense cake.  Frosted with cream cheese frosting.  Got rave reviews at work.  One co-worker commented I needed to make this for EVERY potluck.  They were easy I likely will.  LOL!

I have made it just as written several times, always a big hit. I bake it in a sided cookie sheet (takes 18-20min), like other reviews. This time I wanted to adjust it to make it healthier (for just my family). Used 2c ww flour, little under 1c sugar and added a little br sugar. 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce. Added some nutmeg, little clove, heaping tbs milled/ground flax seed. Only used 3 eggs. Then threw in some mini choc chips :) Not nearly as good as the original, but my young kids don't mind.

This should be called pumpkin cake, but other than that they were great.  I topped them with the pumpkin bar icing from this site.  I also just used a whole large can of the pumpkin pie mix, and didn't add any additional seasonings. Worked out great!

Definitely a keeper. Moist and tasty. I usually try not to change a recipe unless I do not have the ingredients in the house. I wanted to use up a 30 oz. can of Libby's Easy Pumpkin Pie Mix so I put it all in and added a little extra flour. Used 8 oz. of applesauce instead of oil. Baked in a cookie sheet with sides instead of 2-13x9 pans. Frosted with the Pumpkin Bar Icing on this site adding a little pumpkin spice to it. Boy was it good!

My family really enjoyed these.  I did leave the walnuts out because my daughter doesn't like nuts.  I also used the cream cheese frosting recipe from this website.  The two together were very tasty.

Very good.  Baked mine a 9x9 square and added only a bit of nutmeg.  Super delicious.  I am making this again to take to a potluck tomorrow.  I have no doubt that it'll be a success.

This is absolutely delicious!! However, I did not follow the recipe exactly. INSTEAD of the cinnamom I used one tablespoon of pumpkin spice. I also topped it with some homemade cream cheese frosting.

This recipe was great. I cut the recipe in 1/2 and substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil. I didn't have any walnuts so I added 1/2 c of quick cooking oats. I also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of ginger. They came out perfectly moist. I dusted the top with powdered sugar. Perfect desert after a Thanksgiving meal.

I can eat these everyday!  Used w.w. flour, brown sugar, apple sauce instead of oil, added a cup of shredded carrots and baked on a cookie sheet.  They turn out wonderful each and every time!

I'm not a fan of pumpkin desserts, but I wanted to serve one I'd enjoy at Thanksgiving. This was a hit with our whole family, especially with cream cheese icing. Update: I now make these with just 1 C of sugar. No one misses the extra cup!

I am a preschool teacher and I made these with the kid s.It is a very good recipe to make with kids, one mixing bowl and easy to make. We put in vanilla, to me everything almost needs van. and added more cinnamon. It is more cake like, then bars like everyone has said but I tell people that before I give them the recipe or give them the bars. At school we left out the nuts, since it's a nut free zone and I didn't use any frosting. They were a big hit, all the children asked me to give their parents the recipe. All the parents who tasted it, loved it. I'm making it for a potluck today and will add nuts but no frosting. It's easier and tastes good. One day I might try the choc. chips.

Wonderful, moist cake (much more cake-like than "bars.)  I baked it in a jelly roll pan rather than 2) 9x13.  No nuts due to allergies, used fresh pumpkin puree and added a couple dashes of nutmeg.  I used the Pumpkin Bar Icing recipe from this site but thinned it down with milk so it was more of a glaze.  That was perfect.  Where the icing was thicker it almost overpowered the cake.

These were great! They are super moist and have a ton of flavor. I used only one 9x13 pan, and they were thick but not too much for the average pumpkin bar lover!!!

REALLY REALLY GOOD. I halved the recipe so it fit into 1 9x13 pan. Also added 1/2 teas. ground cloves. I didn't have any frosting on hand and I was worried about the "Bland" factor I've read, so I added 1/2 choc. chips to the batter and melted 1/2 cup on top. Check at 20 min so not over done. Super good!

Great cake squares. I took the advice below and made in a jelly-roll pan and also added extra cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. Also instead of cream cheese frosting, just used a confectionery sugar/milk/vanilla/cinnamon glaze. Yum!

I added 2 TBSP of cinnamon instead of 2 tsp and it was AMAZING. I got compliments from everyone who tried it, including the people who claim to not like "spice cake or anything like it". It was especially good with cream cheese frosting... :)

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I added a dash or two of cloves to spice it up a bit.  Cream Cheese Frosting is perfect on top!

This was fabulous!!  I halved the recipe and used one 9x13 pan.  I did cut the soda and powder down a little as well, other than that, followed to a tee.  Delicious and moist.  Definitely more cake-like but that was okay.  Great with ice cream or homemade whipped cream.  Try this.

I would call this Pumpkin Cake not bars. The consistency was more like cake. Boy, it is yummy!! Extremely moist and flavorful. After reading some of the other reviews, I added some more spices to my liking. I added some Pumpkin Pie Spice, Cloves, and Cinnamon. I added until I thought it tasted spicy enough (I like all of my pumpkin baked goods to taste spicy). I frosted it with the Pumpkin Bar Icing that I got off of here. DELICIOUS!!

This recipe was great! I baked it in a large cookie sheet with sides like one of the other people said in the reviews and it yielded so much more and had a traditional bar shape and we also made it with the pumpkin bar icing that is on here too. This was perfect! The kids loved it! So did my hubby!Thank you!

this is absolutely moist and delicious and almost tastes just like carrot cake (with the exception of carrots of course) Great with cream cheese icing. The center came out still slighty undercooked but besides that i will def be using this recipe again.

I give this 5 stars with the slight changes most other reviewers suggested. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup regular flour, cut down the sugar to 1.5 cups, and used the recipe for Pumpkin Bar Icing to put on top - except you have to double it for the two pans of bars this recipe makes.

I made this for a pot luck lunch at work, using a 10x15 pan instead of two 9x13s. Reading some of the other posts, I was afraid this would be too sweet, but it was perfect. Very moist. It was a big hit at the lunch. They didn't leave a single crumb!

These were fantastic, although I deducted one star for the final product. I used a large cookie sheet for thinner, more bar like shape and size (even though it didn't really help make them more bars than cake). These were great and super easy and quick, and I will continue making, however I was hoping for a dense, chewy, moist bar, and what I got was a pumpkin cake. Very good, well enjoyed, and will make again, however I really wanted bars to pass around and ended up with a huge amount of pumpkin cake.

YUM!Gluten free, sugar free works with this one too! I used buckwheat (a seed) flour, 1 cup of honey, 1 tsp of stevia (a plant, non insulin effecting sweetener), a dash of molasses, 1 tsp of vanilla (more flavor means less sugar required :) and it was VERY good. I used a pinch of salt rather than 2 tsp too.

The pumpkin flavor was very mild, making the final product a bit bland. We'll enjoy the batch I made, but I won't make these again.

I thought these were pretty good, but my boyfriend didn't care for them. They were definitely bland, but were easily saved with cream cheese frosting. I highly recommend adding extra spice if you try this recipe. Ground ginger and pumpkin spice would be good additions.

Maybe I did something wrong when I made this, but it came out awfully salty. I made pumpkin bars from an old recipe book of my Aunt's and thought this was the same. Apparently not. It seems like there is a lot of baking powder, soda and salt in this recipe compared to others.

The recipe is great for a cake.  I would recommend using only 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda to make the bars. Even though the cake turned out great, I only give 4 stars since I did not get bars.  I will make this recipe again.

This CAKE is amazing! (definitely cake not bars). I added little nutmeg and cloves, and a 1/2 tsp maple extract to my cream cheese frosting. My friends couldn't stop eating it!

I cut the recipe in half and added 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of ground clove. They were wonderful! Also they are so easy that my 12 daughter made them for my husband to take to work. She got rave reviews and they requested more the next week!!

this is good, and easy. i just halfed it for one pan. i used frosting but i think since this is so light and cake-like, a dusting with powdered sugar would be nice.

Loved this recipe! I ended up putting it in a 13x18 pan, because that's all I had, but they turned out PERFECT! I didn't substitute anything and just used the store bought cream cheese frosting and already they are halfway gone. I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

Some have complained that these are not "bars" but cake... I will agree, in fact I call this pumpkin cake when I make and serve it, which I do often, all year round! I love love love these... this recipe is so light, fluffy, and moist!  We often enjoy it plain or sprinkled with powdered sugar... I usually half the recipe because of how I serve it... I have followed this recipe to a T, but I actually prefer to use 1tsp pumpkin pie spice, and 1/2tsp nutmeg in my halfed recipe... my cousin who hates pumpkin loved this and asked for the recipe... my mother in law said I should sell these to a coffee shop or starbucks!

I've made these 4 or 5 times. Flavor is great! I chose this recipe because it uses the highest pumpkin to flour/sugar ratio of any recipe. I've had equally good results with 1.5 t of soda and powder, and a little less chemical tasting. I'd like to try it with 1 less egg, just to see if it ends up slightly less cake-like, although it hasn't bothered me so far! I frost these with the Cream cheese frosting II recipe, on this site. We've made these for recitals, baby/wedding showers, and just to enjoy on a slow weekend. You'll love it!

Since I always make a mess of cutting bars, I tried this recipe in small cupcakes - they came out wonderful! The recipe will make about 50 cupcakes. I topped them with the cream cheese frosting and  caramel flavored candy corn.  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I tried with whole wheat pastry flour and they were just as good as with white flour.  Also cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't expect it to taste so good because I am not a big fan of pumpkin.  I used a little bit more spice than the recipe says (2 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/3 tsp ginger) and added cream cheese frosting.  It tastes more like a moist spice cake and it is to die for!

Definitely pumpkin cake.  Nice and light, but needs way more spice.  I'd recommend putting in more cinnamon, nutmeg, a bit of cloves, and maybe pumpkin seasoning (but that will make it taste pretty generic).

These were good, but to me it came out more like a cake than bars.  I imagined they would be chewier, and something I could eat without utinsels.  However, if you want pumpkin cake, this is great!

I took it to work today and everyone gobbled it up. A big, tall co-worker came knocking at the window, which made me a little nervous. He said he doesn't like things with pumpkin, but he loves these! I did use the cream cheese recipe for the bars. Thanks for the recipe!

Pumpkin bars just the way I like them.  I did cut oil in half by using applesauce, but everyone loved them!

This now my go-to recipe for fall events and weekends at home, I loved the simplicity and wonderful flavor. I halved the recipe and used the pumpkin bar icing recipe from this site...truly wonderful and next time I will make entire recipe to share with family and friends. Thank you for sharing!

These are really good.  I loved them with and without frosting. I left out the nuts & substituted applesauce for all of the oil.  That was sort of an accident, but I'm glad I did, I didn't miss the oil at all.  So, so yummy!!!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe definitely made pumpkin cake, not bars, but no matter-it was delish!  Came out really moist & fluffy.  I used store bought cream cheese frosting.  I baked it in a large cookie sheet with sides rather than 2 9x13 dishes & it was perfect.

Just what I was looking for.  Made them in a 12" X 18" cake pan, which is pretty close to 9" X 13" twice.  I read many of the reviews before I made them and added a dash of ginger, dash of nutmeg, and the cinnamon.  I also used 2 small cans of pumpkin, instead of 2 C., and added a few spoonfuls of apple butter.  They were awesome!  I don't think you can mess up this recipe unless you really try to.  I frosted with cream cheese frosting with lemon extract (and put Halloween sprinkles on them to make them festive) and served them at our annual fall party.  They were a huge hit!!

I made these following the recipe exactly. Although I'm not a fan of this recipe, I'm still giving it four stars, because I should have known I wouldn't like it from the amount of oil. If you prefer desserts with this much oil and sugar, it's a fine recipe. I just prefer something with more pumpkin flavor and less oil.

Excellent! I cut the recipe in half and used raisins instead of walnuts. I also frosted them while still slightly warm with canned cream cheese frosting and no one could tell the difference. Moist, delicious and so easy to make! I would absolutely make these again.

This is a great recipe.  Same as the one found on Food Network.  Make sure you sift your 2 cups of flour and they will be nice and fluffy!  YUMMY!

These were so good just what I was craving.  I only had just a bit less then a half of a cup of pumpkin so I used a large spoonful of apple butter then omited the cinnamon.  It was so good.  I will always make it this way.

Delicious!  I used 10X13 stoneware bar pan, left the walnuts out of the cake, and used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this website.  Then I added toasted pecans on top of 1/2 the pan for us nut lovers.  This is more like a sheet cake than traditional cookie bars but it is absolutely divine!  Everyone in my house LOVED them!

These were awesome. I made 1/2 a recipe (1-9x13 pan). I also subbed apple sauce for the oil, added a dash of ginger and 2 dashes of nutmeg. Very moist and yummy. We didn't have to put anything on top. Cool whip would be good with it because it tastes exactly like pumpkin pie! It is more of a cake than a bar.

I followed this recipe except for adding a little more spices.  I didn't care for the 'oil' taste, next time I would use some melted butter or margarine.  Also, I baked in 2 9x13s and they were tastey, but very cake-like, not like a bar cookie which I was hoping for.  However,, they were still tastey and really cute with cream cheese frosting and candy corn to decorate.

I absolutely loved these the first time I made them. I don’t have two 9x13 dishes so I did one batch at a time. The only thing I changed is I didn’t add baking soda and I made sure to do exactly 1/2 the batter if you do to much they come out cake like and we liked them more when they were gooey. It was like having pumpkin pie (almost) but in a bar. YUM!

These are soooo good.  I made them yesterday to take to a church function and they didn't last very long!!!  I made a cream cheese frosting to go with it... omg... they were fabulous.  They were very moist.  I did add extra cinnamon, with some ginger and nutmeg for a little extra pumpkin pie flavor... which I would recommend to anyone wanting to try this.  They tasted just like a pumpkin pie with cream cheese frosting. DELICIOUS!!!

These were very good, I did add some spices 1/2 t. ginger, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1 t. vanilla, only 1 t. salt.  I also used half brown sugar and half white, also only 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  They were a little more dense than ohters had reviewed, I used 2 9x13 pans as called for, very moist great flavor. Thank you for sharing

I followed the suggestion of other reviewers for baking it in a cookie sheet.  I cooked it double the time and it just never seemed right, it tasted raw so I kept baking it finally I gave up.  Such a disappointment.  The taste of egg was overwhelming also.

After seeing the picture that RVGUY had in the photo voting I just had to make these bars. With all the ingredients on hand, and so quick to whip up they hit the spot. Just the perfect dessert for this time of the year. Will be making these again. A great pumpkin recipe.

I made this with the pumpkin bar icing found on this site and wow. Super good recipe other readers are right this is not a heavy bar but more like a cakey brownie. I followed the recipe exactly but added a dash of cloves and a tsp of vanilla.

Turned out as a cake for me, but I used smaller baking dishes. I bet if I had used larger dishes it would've been "thinner" after baking and would've been more bar like. A huge hit in my house, we actually were happy it came out cake like. Very good!!

Super and super easy!!! I followed another reviewers advice and baked on  a large edged cookie sheet.  I substituted pecans for walnuts and added some golden raisins on hand.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Should be called Pumpkin Cake Bars.  They were still very good though. I even reduced the measurements of salt, baking soda and powder to 1 tsp. each. I also added some pumpkin pie spice. I used one cookie sheet and put the extra into a smaller baking pan. Easy to make, try them!

Just wanted to comment on previous review by Eleda that said stevia is a rice extract. It is a plant extract or powder from the stevia plant, not rice.
Haven't tried the recipe though so to be fair : 5 stars.

Thought this was good, but not great. Needed more "spices" to play off the pumpkin. Will try making it again adding more spice to the ingredients since I did like the fact that the "cake" was very moist! I made a homemade cream cheese frosting which was just perfect!

This is an exellent moist & fluffy cake recipe but I am disappointed because I was expecting more of a cookielike heavier texture. I am glad I made only half as this is not what I am looking for in a "Bar". As a cake, it deserves 5 stars.

This recipe is just okay.  After all the stars I was expecting something awesome, but my family and I think it is plain.  I followed the recipe exactly (though the amounts listed for baking powder/soda and salt seemed like a lot), with the addition of 1tsp of vanilla in the batter.  It did bake perfectly (on a cookie sheet per the suggestion of other reviewers).  The only saving grace is the cream cheese frosting I put on top.  BTW:  I bake at least twice a week, so I know what I'm doing. . .

This was a great recipe.  I just wish I would have realized it was to be in two cake pans before starting.  I threw caution to the wind and put it all in my one 9 x 13 pan.  I ended up having to add some time to it, but it came out nicely.  Also, at the advice of others, I added spices - 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp allspice and 1/2 tsp ginger.  This is a very moist cake. Yes they're called Pumpkin Bars, but they're moist and springy like cake.  Great recipe with the extra spices.

Great recipe. I cut in half and it filled a 9 x 13 just right. Wonderful with cream cheese frosting. Didn't add raisins but think they would be wonderful in this recipe.

What a fabulous recipe!  I made this for a Christmas get together at our church after a Christmas play, and it was devoured!!  I expected it to be not quite as high, it came out as big as a cake, but it didn't matter to me.  It was super easy, and I didn't use the nuts in case of food allergies, the pumpkin bars "cake" came out sooo moist, and it didn't fall apart as I took it out of the pan.  The Cream cheese icing, I put on was great, it complimented the bars!  As I said, it was gone in no time.  Thanks!!!

Made these for Halloween, went over v well. Cut recipe in half and baked in 8x8 - came out like cake. Used dried cranberries (crasins) instead of nuts - the sour gave it a nice kick.

I have to say I am impressed with this recipe! It made me look like a good baker--and I'm really not! It was simple (a lot more simple than pumpkin roll) but with the classic pumpkin taste I was hoping for. It is amazing with the pumpkin bar icing. Definitely more of a cake consistency, but still very good. I followed the recipe but added ginger.

Very good!! I thought it was delicious, it took a while for my husband to agree...the more he ate, the more he liked it. I used applesauce instead of oil to save some calories. Very much like a cake. I cut the recipe in half and it made a full 9x13 cake. Will definately use the recipe again!!

Very simple and delicious!  I added 1/2 c of Craisins, would add 1 c next time, but still a great touch.  They are very much cake-like, not so much a bar, but delicious either way.  I also got about 32 (reasonably sized) servings, not 20.  The more the better!

This was more like a cake than a bar, but very dry. Definitely would never make it again. The best thing was the frosting.

This recipe is awesome. It is super moist and makes 2...9x13 pans.
I made the Cream cheese icing (recipe found in this site).
I made it for the church Bingo concession stand, and it was a big hit!

Very good recipe.  Added 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, used raisins instead of nuts and half the white sugar substituted with brown.  Melted butter gives a better flavor than oil in any recipe like this.

These were some of the best pumpkin bars I've made in a long time! At first, I was kind of nervous when I saw the batter, but  then it baked, and they tasted wonderful, especially with cream cheese frosting! =)

I make pumpkin bars every year. My family and friends absolutely LOVES them.  For those who are wanting  the bars to be less cake like, try useing only  1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon.  I add the spices ...  1  1/2 teaspoons Ground Cinnamon,  1/2 teaspoon  Ground Cloves, 1/2 teaspoon Ground Ginger,  1/2 teaspoon Nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon Ground Pumpkin Spice. For my icing I use 8 ounces of Cream Cheese ( because I really like to taste of the flavor of the Cream Cheese) and 1  1/2  to 2 Pounds of Powdered Sugar to get the right consistency. It depends on the humidity in the air.   I bake mine in an extra large cookie  that has sides.  I hope these suggestions are helpful.

I made this 5 times already following the recipe to the Tee, (sometimes I slow down on the oil) it never stops to impress me. This is going to be my 6th time and I KNOW for a fact it will be delicious and amazing. So sweet, so moist, the worst part about it is the wait!

Made this according to the recipe except did not have all the different  spices. Used cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and allspice. Very easy ; my 8 year old twins made it. Everyone devoured the bars. Moist, no frosting needed!

I halved the recipe and the "bars" came out nicely.  They are more cake-like than bar-like, but very tasty.  I added ginger and chinese five-spice powder for extra flavor.  Try it with a half recipe of Janni's Cream Cheese Frosting II.

So Good!  My husband, who's not a pumpkin fan, loved it.  Very similar to carrot or spice cake.  A keeper!

These are very easy and delicious.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white and they still turned out yummy.  My 12 year old son said they are the best bars ever!  I also bought a can of cream cheese frosting and spread over the top.  This recipe is definately a keeper.

Made a batch to send over to the troops in Afghanistan, but I tasted them before I packed them. They were pretty yummy. I couldn't frost them but I did sprinkle them with powdered sugar. Only 4* since they are more cake-like than bars.

This recipe turned out a bit too tendy. It was difficult to serve without it falling apart and can definitely not be called a "bar". It's more like a cake- still it tastes really good.

Well, I thought adding only three eggs might yield a more bar-like substance, but it's still pretty cakey.  Delicious, though!

The recipe makes a good cake, but it's far too soft to use as bars.
