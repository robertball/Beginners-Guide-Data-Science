This was a very good recipe, particularly considering how few ingredients are in it!  I used one 32 oz. container of chicken broth and only 1 T of soy sauce.  I also did not add water to the beaten eggs and used dried chives instead of green onions.  To get more traditional egg consistency, stir soup gently and drizzle egg into soup.  After a few seconds, draw a spoon through soup and the egg will swirl.

Made it almost exactly as written, however, instead of green onions, I used a couple shakes of minced onion, garlic powder, and ground ginger. It was marvelous! :)

Oh my goodness!  This was delicious :)  I love egg drop soup, and this tasted almost exactly like the stuff you can get in a restaurant.  I'd suggest using a wide-pronged fork to stir the egg if you like bigger chunks of egg in your soup.

Delicious recipe! I only use about 30 oz of the chicken broth to help thicken it up and I also use the low sodium version and it's still wonderful! Sometimes I also add frozen corn to help beef it up and it tastes great.

Really easy, which is what I needed while I'm ill.  I started with homemade chicken broth and went from there.  Next time I make this, I'll increase the cornstarch and decrease the soy sauce by half (it tasted way too much like soy sauce).  Thanks for the recipe!!

I'm giving it five stars not just because it tasted wonderful, but because it was so easy AND my very picky 5 year old loved it!  I followed the advice of a few previous reviewers and made the following tweaks:  added 1/8t ground ginger, 1/4t garlic powder and 1t dried onion flakes (because I didn't have any green onions on hand), and only added a scant tablespoon of water instead of two to the egg, then swirled it gently once I added it to the broth.  It smelled heavenly, looked like something I'd picked up from our favorite Chinese restaurant, and could not have taken more than 10 minutes to make.

tasted just like resaraunt style!! I made healthy modifications by using low sodium chicken broth, omitted the sugar and cornstarch. I also added 2 more egg whites and 1/2 package extra firm tofu for more protien. My dad thought I picked up chinese!!

We also didn't have green onion and sauteed some onion instead.  I will probably try the dry minced onion from other viewers as the sauteed onion was too powerful.

My daughter has a touch of the flu, and thought that some egg drop soup would be comforting.  I tried this easy recipe, and it was delicious!  I did not have any green onions or scallions, so I substituted fresh garlic.   My daughter loved it....it's a great comfort food, and nutritious as well.

I love this soup! I cut the recipe down to 2 servings and the portion size was strange so I winged it. For example 3/8 can of 46.5 oz of chicken broth. I'm not good at math so I used one 14.5 ounce can and 2 green onions. The soy sauce,cornstarch and water I used according to scaled down recipe. Added some red curry powder for heat and flavor. It was great!

This looks more like cream of chicken soup by the time you finish making it, I added garlic and it was the only reason I was even able to choke it down.

This recipe is a bit bland.  The water takes most of the taste out of the main ingredients.  To spice this, forget about the water and use chicken broth, and add a bit of ginger to the recipe.

Great soup! Super easy and quick to make. I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and picky eater boys all loved it. The whole pot lasted about ten minutes. I only give it four stars though because I think it could use a few other ingredients. Next time I'll try adding a bit of ginger, some tofu, and lemongrass.

OMG! This is my second attempt at egg drop soup, and I think that this one is better then the more complex one i tried. I added peas to mine though, just to give it a lil extra. Wonderful texture and taste.

This is really good!  As for the water, I didn't think it took much from the flavor!  Maybe since I used water plus boullion that may be different!  I can see the soy being a tiny bit to much for some people, but I liked it honestly!  Great easy soup...and I ate it all!

This recipe was delicious and perfect for the night after an exhausting day. I will definitely make this again! I later added a touch of sesame oil and garlic because I love those flavors, but the base recipe is excellent.

Our family loves this soup and I make at least once a week in winter and occasionally in the summertime. I don’t add anything but always double the recipe. I use organic chicken broth, extra large organic eggs, and Kikkoman brand soy sauce. I like to add the green onions until ready to serve with some crispy wontons on top. Depending on how you like the egg swirl sizes, I like to gently and slowly stir in egg mixture to the soup with a fork which makes for larger egg pieces. I’ve noticed that if cooked too hot and too long it changes the flavor. My 12 year old daughter says it’s better than the restaurant down the street and what can be better then that!!!!  THANK YOU FOR AN AWESOME EASY SOUP :-D

This was delicious. I had never had egg drop soup before, but I loved this. When I ate egg drop soup at a Chinese restaurant, I was disappointed. This recipe is so much better. It has a nice, brothy texture, and light, pleasant flavor.

I was told to make egg drop soup  because I haven't been feeling well, so I looked up this recipe and made the first one I seen with 4+ stars. I followed the recipe almost exact. I ran out of green onions so I substituted for spinach. After making it I was a little skeptical because it did not look fully cooked so I heated it for another minute for good measure and "OH WOW" It is very tasty! I am impressed. I will definately be making it again. Soon! Thank you so much for this recipe.

I needed a quick meal for me and my toddler (picky eater, but loves broth, so this was a hit!)  I used homemade broth (plain meat/bone stock without spices) and made only 2 portions (about 1/3 recipe): a few green onions, pinch of sugar, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, 2 teaspoons cornstarch, 1 tablespoon cold water, and 1 egg.  Delicious!

I'm a sucker for new recipes on things I have already made. The 1st time I tried it, it was easy & good, albeit a little bland. 2nd time I added 3 saffron threads and chives with the broth and onions, as well as 1/2 t of ginger and clove of minced garlic and a few strips of cabbage. Cut the soy & sugar in half and added it to the broth as well instead of mixing with cornstarch. Just before adding the egg I added 2 drops of toasted sesame oil and 2 drops of Mongolian fire oil. Also used 4 egg whites only. That was an awesome eggdrop! If you cook Chinese food regularly, some of the ingredients are well worth the cost.

Whoa.  This is better than what I get in the restaurant and that's saying a lot! I cut the soy sauce in half, figuring I could add more later if needed but I didn't think it needed it. I also added 1/8 tsp ginger, a clove of minced garlic and an extra egg. I only added 1 Tbs of water to the egg mixture, and the consistency was perfect for me. In restaurants, this soup can be too gelatinous for my liking so this homemade soup is perfect for me. I will be making this again and again. Thank you!

I liked this overall, but thought the soy sauce was a bit too strong here.  I also found that the flavor got much better after the soup sat for a bit (to cool down).  I love how easy and quick it was to make, and will save it for those sudden "egg drop soup cravings", but I will continue the search for THE egg drop soup.

This recipe served dual purpose for us. Egg Drop is my husband's favorite Chinese soup so I tried this one for him and he loved it saying it was better than any restaurant's Egg Drop. By adding a squirt each of hot chili sauce and vinegar I was able to approximate the flavor of my favorite, Hot 'n Sour. Thank you, Ava, for sharing this good basic recipe.

This was so quick, easy and tasted like what I've ordered in restaurants. Husband and I each had two bowls! We made it as the first course with the Slow Cooker Mongolian Beef on this site.

Yummy! I made this according to recipe except I didn't have any green onions on hand (substituted a little onion powder as another reviewer suggested) and I only used 1T. of soy sauce (not a big fan). This wasn't a thick, almost slippery consistency like the soup we get from our favorite restaurant, but still very good. And my picky eight year-old LOVED it. Great for a quick, easy light dinner. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe :-)

This was very easy and pretty good.  I would make it again, however, I don't think I will add all three tablespoons of soy sauce, might cut it down to two.

This tastes very much like what I would expect at a Chinese restaurant. I will make this again, and probably add some diced water chestnuts for crunch.

I made this last night and we loved it! I had to use vegetable broth over chicken to make the dish vegetarian, and I also added a bit of cubed medium firm tofu to the pot. I think the concept of "a bunch" of green onions must vary, I used only one little stalk and I think if I had used more than two it would have been onion soup! Nevertheless, it turned out very tasty. I added a bit of chili sauce to my bowl and I think next time I will add a couple teaspoons of it to the whole pot. It was a very flavourful "chicken-y" tasting soup, which I haven't had since I went vegetarian 10 years ago. Excellent for when someone is feeling a bit under the weather -- it was also simple/cheap to make! Will make again.

I make this soup all the time with those little packets from the grocery store.  You know, the ones with all the preservatives and ingredients you can't even pronounce, let alone want to eat.  Well this is soup is just as good, if not better and just as easy.  My kids LOVED it, and between the 3 of us, we finished the whole pot.  Thanks so much for the recipe, now I can make this at home anytime I want.

P.S.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use chicken broth where it called for water, so as not to dilute the flavour.

I didn't try this one--made it for bf--but he seemed to like it.  Doesn't look  exactly like what they serve at Chinese restaurants, but the title doesn't pretend to that.  Not sure I dropped in the eggs correctly, as the eggs seemed much different than what I'm used to seeing.  I did better with the Hot and Sour Chicken Soup, ironically, though it was only one egg.  Maybe it takes practice.  Thanks for the recipe!

After having a bad bout of the stomach flu for the past couple of days, eating nothing but saltine crackers,and plain white rice this tasted so good to hubs and me.I added about three chopped green onions,no white parts as our stomachs were weak. I added about 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder,and 1/8 teaspoon of finely grated fresh ginger, ( fresh is ginger is best and good for digestion). After sipping this soup we both felt better.

This was thick and tasted really good. I didn't have soy sauce, but used 3/4 tbl teriyaki sauce and 1/4 tbl Worcestershire. I may have stirred the eggs too vigorously because it clouded the soup. Still great tasting!

This was a comforting and tasty base! I did make a handful of changes: I substituted flour (about 6 tbsp.) for cornstarch because I didn't have any; I used "better than bouillon - no chicken vegetarian base" because I like it better; I left out the sugar because I wasn't sure about it; I added some ground ginger, pepper, turmeric, and a dash of cayenne; and I garnished the soup with kimchi for fun!

Good recipe but not complete without sesame seed oil. An absolute must to get the right flavor. Add 2-3 tsp or to taste. I reduced the soy sauce in half bc I wanted a lighter taste. This recipe was easier than I thought! I also added mushrooms and cut spinach to get some veggies in.

My boyfriend has ALS and finding things he can eat and easily swallow is an issue. SO GRATEFUL to find this recipe!  Made it as written with one exception...the green onions he cannot tolerate. I left them out and added a shake of onion powder to taste. He was able to sip it right out of a cup!  Thank you for posting this...

Not very good.  The overall consistency was like gravy, and the eggs ended up in a weird, thick and grainy like substance.  Three tablespoons of constarch is also way too much.

I don't like to waste food, so I'll stomach the rest of it.  Probably not going to make this again.

I am not a fan of this as it is. if I make it again I will use about half as much soy sauce. I added diced mushrooms and 1/4 peas & carrots which helped but the soy sauce was too much. I only used one egg (ran out of them) and that was plenty so I think it would've been worse if I had used 3.

I have made this recipe several times. It's easy and I love it. Sometimes I add a small amount of frozen corn or chicken but mostly just the way it is in the recipe.  It's always wonderful with spring rolls.

The only changes I made was adding a little bit of salt and pepper to taste. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious. This recipe only uses a few ingredients and is super simple, but it is a perfect egg drop soup!

There is a local Chinese restaurant that I go to often that have the BEST egg drop soup I have ever had. This is the closest I have ever gotten to it and I am so happy! I replaced corn starch with sifted white flour, soy sauce with Worcestershire sauce, and I did not use and onions (the soup at the restaurant doesn’t use them) and it is so good! I highly recommend this recipe and don’t be afraid to do a little spin on it. You’d be surprised! I’ll definitely be making this quite often.

My Dad used to make me egg drop soup when I was sick. Today  I made this recipe for my sick 5yo and she LOVED it. I didn’t use canned bouillon, though. I used a chicken Better than Bouillon paste and it was delish.

I love this recipe. It's my go too recipe now!
I've tried others but I think the soy sauce in this one gives it great flavor! 
It's super easy, and most ingredients you have (I had chicken bouillon cubes) and my kids love it as well. It's very filling and I always have leftovers.
This is great if you're craving  Oriental and need that quick fix on a low budget! :)

Rather than using canned chicken broth, I stuck a leftover rotisserie chicken carcass in the pressure cooker with some water and veggies and made a chicken stock. Then I took that gelatinous chicken stock and cut it 50/50 with water. Then I followed the recipe for the most part. I feel like a whole bunch of green onions was excessive, so I put 1 large greeen onion in. It could have used a second one, but it was fine.  Then I also added a 4th TBSP of cornstarch bc I like my soup a bit thicker. It turned out awesome! Just like the restaurants! Yay! I love it when a recipe turns out great! :)

Barely Eatable. That's the best thing I can say about this. It should be called Salty Brown Chicken Gravy and Eggs. A large pot, why? You are only making a quart of soup. One Bunch of green onions? One green onion is plenty and that may be over doing it. 3 tablespoons of cornstarch = gravy. 1 Tablespoon is enough, 2 maybe if you like it really thick. 2 Tablespoons of soy sauce? I had to double check to make sure I hadn't read it wrong. Turned it brown and really salty, not like the picture at all. 2 teaspoons makes more sense. 3 eggs in only a quart of soup? One would be plenty, two maximum for this small quantity. Egg drop soup is supposed to have delicate ribbons of egg running through it not this mess. Only 1/4 teaspoon of sugar? Why bother, leave it out.

I love egg drop soup but this was not good. Very disappointed. Sugar was a bad idea.

Very good! Restaurant quality. I did make one variation. I used potato starch instead of corn starch. Makes broth less thick.

This was so easy and absolutely delicious.  I used chicken bullion instead of readymade broth, since it was in my cupboards.  My kids were so excited about this soup that they asked I make it tomorrow again!

Really good! I was really hoping to get the yellow, clear egg drop soup like you get from Chinese restaurants, but this one turned out really brown! It was scary when you first add the corn starch, but it boils away. I would do like the rest of reviewers suggested and add some onion, garlic, ginger to it (not very much!!) and lower the amount of soy sauce, atleast by half. Will make again!

Very Quick, easy and inexpensive... add a couple drops of sesame for more flavor in a pinch. Also, serve with a touch of white pepper to arouse your senses.

I didn't care 4 it. I thought it was 2 sweet. I did add minced onion,and garlic powder. My husband on the other hand thought it was really good. If I decide to make it again. More soy sauce less sugar and more garlic and onion. might try it with splenda instead of white sugar.

This is delicious! I used a tad bit too much cornstarch (my fault when converting the recipe) but that's easily thinned out. The flavor was good but I did choose to saute diced mushrooms and green onions in a little stock before adding the broth and I hit it with a little garlic powder and ginger powder. Great jumping off point for a yummy soup!

So good!! 
I have a sensitivity to egg yolks, so I use "Egg Beaters" . I just realized that I don't thin that out with water like the recipe states. maybe I will try that next time.
Also, I much prefer leaving my scallions raw sprinkled on top of the soup after its served

This was my first time making AND eating this soup but as it is a favorite of my mother's I decided to give it a go...especially since I had everything needed.  It came out wonderfully.  I used jumbo eggs.  Additionally, I added some fresh spinach chopped and a few butterflied shrimp per serving since it was all that we were having for dinner.  To kick it up a notch I threw in a handful of fresh chopped cilantro at the end and it gave that distinctive flavor that pushed it to the next level.

I added small shrimp and bok choy for a heartier soup and it was delicious! (I also added a little more soy sauce in the end). No more Chinese Egg Drop Soup take-out for me! Will definitely make this again, so simple and quick!

The only thing that was off in this recipe was the sugar. I tried the recipe again sans sugar and it tasted great! Just like from the restaurants. It tastes perfectly fine without scallions as well.

 Another thing to add in order to make the soup more authentic is half a can of corn. Also, be sure not to add too many eggs, otherwise, the soup will become too cloudy and look unappetizing. Good recipe overall.

Love the soup and so easy to make. The next time I make it, I will only use 1 Tbl of soy sauce instead of 2. Didn't have green onions but added onion powder and ground ginger. I added crunchy noodles to it. Will definitely make this again!

This had a great flavor.  Better than what I get at a restaurant.  I had to use onion powder as I had no green onions but still awesome.

I will make this again using less soy sauce and adding garlic power and more cornstarch.

This was quick and easy, and very yummy. I got a very good egg drop soup consistency with the recipe as written. I may try to add mushrooms next time for kicks.

this may look kind of disgusting but it is absolutely delicious! I used gluten free soy sauce and added a handful of pre-cut broccoli slaw (has julienned broccoli, red cabbage and carrots) and used less chicken broth (a 946 ml carton of gluten free chicken stock). Next time I might use a smidgin less soy sauce but other than that, it was wonderful

I would have given this recipe the five stars if it was not for the fact that I had to add a little salt and sprinkle some pepper. Maybe since I had to reduce the recipe for 2 people, there was a mistake on my side. However, I can vouch for the easyness of this soup. Just adjust the salt and add a bit of pepper if you like.

I've made this several times! It's my go-to quick soup. I use 5 eggs instead of 3 and use s soup base and water instead of chicken broth.

My 1 year old had a horrible cough and confession with no appetite.  She helped me mix these eggs and LOVED THE SOUP! !! I was able to whip this up quickly while she played.

Easy and quite yummy. Didn't use green onions, we don't like them, but otherwise made as written. We make it with bacon fried rice. Always yummy! :)

We followed the recipe exactly and found it bland with no flavour depth.

The recipe was very easy and the ingredients were easy to get, but we did not enjoy eating it very much. 4 servings will end up getting tossed.

Maybe it's because I have the flu, but I failed miserably at this recipe. It came out like pudding, and not very flavorful. I think I will try again with little to NO cornstarch, and a bit more of something...not sure what just yet. I won't give a rating until I know it's not me.

Perfect!  So easy and yummy (even with so few ingredients)! I added some Trader Joe's chicken & cilantro mini wontons, and served with egg rolls.

Just made this for dinner after running around all day in the cold, rainy weather. The only changes I made were to use low sodium soy sauce (just 1 tablespoon) and add a shake of garlic powder.  This is a perfect comfort food and so simple.  We loved it. Will definitely be making this soup again.

This was fantastic!  And so like the traditional soup our Thai exchange student made us.  A few changes I'd make: add either fresh grated or some other form of ginger, cut back on the sodium by either using a lower sodium broth or low sodium soy sauce.  I'm going to try it with vegetable broth sometime too.
