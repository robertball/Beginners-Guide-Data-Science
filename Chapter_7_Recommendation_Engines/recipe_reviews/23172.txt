I made these for my Christmas lunch and they were pretty good. Let me try to explain the confusing cresent roll dough, since it seems like a lot of people had trouble. I used Pillsbury Crescent Roll dough (regular size, not Grands). When you unroll the dough, the dough will be perforated... you will see 4 large rectangles, with each rectangle divided into 2 triangles. Ignore the triangles... break the dough into the 4 large rectangles. Then, with the knife, cut each rectangle in half, leaving you with 2 squares for each rectangle (for a total of 8 squares. Put the mushroom filling in the middle of the square (which will still have perforations - squeeze this together to keep the turnover from breaking apart). Just fold the square so it's corner to corner, into triangles and press with the prongs of a fork to keep closed. Best when dough is very cold = much easier to work with. I hope this makes sense!!

The mushroom filling is nice, but I did not like crescent rolls for this recipe. The crescent rolls made a rather large appetizer, one that was too doughy for my taste.  I prefer using phyllo dough, which is much flakier and lighter and MUCH easier to use than the crescent rolls.  You can buy pre-made frozen phyllo dough cups-- they are about the size of a miniature Reeses peanut butter cup (a perfect size for an appetizer.)  Also, try adding 1/2 a package of Boursin Garlic and Fine Herb cheese after the mushrooms have cooked.  Sometimes I make half of this recipe as directed, and half with Boursin, and the appetizers with the Boursin always go first.

I made these tonight for dinner and they were delicious!!... I did make a few changes... I used an 8oz package of mushrooms, instead of minced onion I chopped up a green onion and added that to the pan with the butter and mushrooms along with 1 teasp minced garlic.. When filling the crescents do them one at a time because once the hot mushroom filling gets on them they get soggy.. So spoon some filling on one square and fold it right away then move to the next one.. On top of the mushroom mixture before folding I topped it off with a mixture of Parmesan and Mozarella cheese... Dont worry if they wont fold into a perfect triangle I found that any shape is delicious..LOL.. I didnt have any sesame seeds so I couldnt add those but they were GREAT without them.. I will be adding these to my Superbowl Appetizer trays..

We thought these little appetizers were terrific Paula! Instead of the dough, I just used the mini phyllo cups and they worked out great with half the work. I did add more seasonings and a little bit of dry sherry to the mushrooms. Thanks so much!

These were SOOO GOOD !!! I had trouble putting them together the first time I made them. I made these again only just used the cresent rolls where preforated. I made 4 squares then before serving cut them in half from corner to corner. I used fresh onion and dried parsley and made extra filling. After draining I put them in a bowl and added marble jack and parmesean cheese. Last time I made them I added some shredded mozzerella cheese. Yummy !!!
Thank you for sharing your recipe

These appetizers were great!  We combined them with another appetizer to make a unique dinner.  We made a few changes, using 8oz of mushrooms and half an onion.  We found that they shrunk so much they could easily stuff the eight crescent triangles.  I think 4oz would have been too little.  We also ommitted the parsley and added a clove of garlic.  Yum!

Love this recipe with these suggested improvements: I put the mushrooms in the food processor rather than coarsly chopping.  This made it more like a mushroom duxelle.  It makes the filling easier to fit into the triangle.  Also, I used a fork to crimp the edges together all the way around the triangles to provide a uniform and decorative look plus keep the filling from coming out.  Finally I used black sesame seeds or poppy seeds on the top for a contrasting color, which made these seem fancier.  An eggwash can help these to stick and make your dough brown better and shine.  You can use puff pastery instead of crescent roll dough if you like.  Personally I found phyllo dough to be too dry...

This is my go to appetizer for the holidays. They are very easy to do and you can make the mushroom mixture ahead of time. I do like to add some herbes de provence to the mushrooms (about a teaspoon). I have also added shallots in place of the onion. Everyone asks for the recipe and no one can eat just one!

These were okay.  I know if I used puff pastry instead, they would have been ALOT better.  In fact, I bet I would give that variation 5 stars!!!

I made this recipe as a project with my children and they ate up a double recipe of these goodies. It's easy and fun to make with kids if you cook the mushrooms in advance and let them fill and fold the dough. I used a fork to seal the edges before baking so they wouldn't pull apart and that really helped the second batch. YUMMY for sure! Kids went crazy over these. Well make these again for sure.

Great flavor and quick and easy.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried, but I did everything else as written maybe using a bit more mushrooms just because I finished up what was left.  Very good.  I grated my parmesan cheese fresh on the mushrooms before I sealed them.  Very good.

These were pretty good :) I cooked up some left over shaved steak and added it to the mushroom filling and sprinkled a little cheddar cheese over it all. It made for a heartier appetizer. Nice recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Not a huge fan of these.  My sister made these for my bridal shower- she and I both agreed that they were "just ok".  We had a lot of leftovers.

I thought the flavor was good, however I tasted more roll than mushrooms.  Not one of my favorites, but good.

I followed this recipe exactly, and found that there simply was not enough of the mushroom filling to fill 8 crescents (the amount in my package). I ended up making only 6 turnovers, and even then I didn't feel that there was enough of the filling for the 6 crescent rolls.  It was not bad tasting at all - but I would definitely double or triple the amount of filling if I made again, otherwise all you end up tasting is the crescent roll.  It had a good taste, just not enough of it,in my opinion.

These were very good. I made a few changes for our familys taste. I used the cresent creations so I didn't have to worry about the perforations. I just cut it into squares. I used a combination of brown, portabella, and wild mushrooms. I added some fresh thyme to the mushrooms. To cut down on the fat I used half the butter and replaced it with evoo. And instead of the parmesan I used swiss. I also didn't add either poppyseeds or sesame seeds.

These were delicious!  I made them for dinner tonight as a vegetarian main course.  Instead of cutting them into smaller squares, I made 4 turnovers out of the 8 ounce crescent roll package and it was just right.  I forgot to put in the parmesan, but they were so delicious they did not need it.  I did, however, season the mushrooms well beforehand so that added to the flavor.  I will definitely make these again!

I made these for my girls at dinner last night.  They were GREAT!  I added yellow peppers and 2 tbsp. of garlic in the pan with the mushrooms.  .  I did not use parm. cheese, but a blend of mozz and parm, instead.  I also used low fat crescent rolls, as well!  YUM!

I also used puff pastry instead of crescent dough. Worked really well. They were very tasty but I think next time I will add to the filling. Maybe roasted sweet potato and rosemary.

Yummy! A hit! I oiled my baking sheet first, added a touch of garlic and put a dab of cream cheese on top before sealing. They are a bit messy to work with and I wondered what they would look like after cooking, but I took the suggestion of another reviewer and crimped the edges with a fork which helped and the appearance was fine. Be sure you drain your mushroom mixture well. I also put mozzeralla cheese on top. I will make again.

Made these last night and they were fabulous!  I used more like 6oz of mushrooms and dried parsley.  I also added some shredded swiss to the mushroom mixture before putting on the crescent rolls. Like other reviewers, I had a hard time keeping my crescents together - they separated at the perforations when I took them out of the can, so I just used them in their regular triangular shape and folded them over sealing with a fork.  I didn't use the butter on the top, but I did sprinkle with some garlic powder.  I will be making these again and again!  Thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe!

Overall I felt this recipe was good.  Instead of cutting the crescents in half I just used one whole crescent for the top and one for the bottom and pinched the sides together, I felt that was easier then making smaller ones

Very good. I also just rolled these like a regular crescent since the other way was a pain; also, I made a triple batch and I could fit more onto the baking sheet that way.

Really good~ will definitely try again as an appetizer at a party or something.  I added a clove of minced garlic to the mix and skipped the butter in favor of olive oil.  Folding was a bit tricky for me, too (Pilsbury's crescent dough is probably not meant for squares..) but I just made them round and everything was great.

I now get what the previous reviewer meant by these being "fiddly" to make - mine didn't fold into triangles well (dough may have been too soft,) so I just made them into square-like pouches. As far as taste - outstanding! I made them as our bread for dinner with friends, and my husband topped his with marinara sauce - everyone loved them, and they are SIMPLE to make!

These were good although I didn't butter the tops or use any seeds.  Also, I left the shape original and just rolled up crescent style.

These are good, if a little tedious to make. I found that the grated parmesan is hard to keep in one place and can keep the dough from sealing, so halfway through I switched to small pieces of Muenster and had a much easier time with the folding and sealing. The parmesan ones obviously had more flavor, so next time I would add shaved parmesan or a stronger sliced cheese - but not the powdery grated stuff. These are addicting, so make them at your own risk. Thanks for the recipe. :)

The recipe turned out pretty well, but I would have preferred melted cheese in the filling so that it would merge better.  It tasted to much like grated Parmesan cheese.  I brought a batch of these to a party and they were a big hit.

These were pretty good but could have used a bit more flavor, I think.  Only got 6 from the roll of crescents but it was OK cause the crust was a bit thicker. I added a little 6 cheese Italian shredded cheese on top of the dough before topping with the mushrooms   I didn't have to much of a problem forming them but made sure I left room at the edge to fold, which I crimped with a fork.  The only problem I can report was that they stuck to the baking pan.  I suppose a spray of Pam should solve that.  I would def make again but maybe add some garlic for more flavor

Great recipe, i was very happy with the way this came out.  I added a bit of mozzarella cheese to each turnover as per other reviewer's suggestions.  It was so easy to make and my friends really enjoyed it.  Will definitely make it again!

We were not overly impressed with this recipe although the flavor was good... the size of each of the eight servings were far bigger then we wanted to serve as an appetizer so we cut each triangle in half after cooking thus giving us 16 servings instead of the original 8.

I made these for a potluck and they were a big hit.  I couldn't quite get them into the shape the recipe called for, but honestly I just rolled them up into balls with filling inside and they came out looking like beautiful popovers!   I will make these again.

I made these for a Girl's Night last weekend and they were a HIT!  These are a bit fiddly to make, I had trouble keeping the seams pinched together.  I cooked the filling (added a couple cloves of minced garlic) and let it cool to room temperature before I tried to fill the dough.  I couldn't get nicely shaped triangles so I just folded the squares in 1/2 and pinced the edges together with the tines of a fork to seal the turnovers.  I brushed the tops with melted butter and sprinkled with garlic salt and then baked according to the directions.  Very tasty!  Next time I make these I will add a little grated swiss or sharp cheddar inside.  I think that would make these even tastier.  Hands down the Girl's voted this recipe a keeper!

These were indeed "fiddly" to make. I used 8 oz of mushrooms and I think that was a little too much. I'll keep it to 4 or maybe 6 next time. I will also add some minced garlic and more cheese-- the cheese was the best part! My boyfriend really thought these were great-- I put jalapenos in some for him and he thought that was just divine. They were good, and turned out well, I just think the flavor needs a little doctoring to make them delicious. Good idea though!

These were pretty good, but could have had more flavor.  I used real onion instead of minced.  I think next time I will add some jalapenos or some crushed red pepper to the mushroom mix to give it a little kick.

My husband and I loved these! I made them as a side dish and made 6 of them - the amount of crescents in the package. It was frusterating trying to stuff them, however it was well worth the effort. This is on my list of all time favorites!

Well, nobody else mentioned this but I had a really hard time with the dough. It was difficult to get out of the tube in one piece, and then it stretched and broke, and was virtually impossible to form nice neat squares. I added some garlic powder to the mushroom filling, as I thought it was quite bland. These were ok, but I won't make them again. Thanks anyway.

So, I have never worked with flaky cresent before and I had trouble. I followed the recipe almost exactly except for folding the 8 squares into triangles. I had trouble with that.  Anyway, Once finished they just tasted like sauteed buttery mushroom in crescent rolls.  Only ate one. Girlfriend ate 2.  Won't make again.

This was quite delicious!  But the part "fold the squares into triangles"  didn't really make any sense to me.  Either I was just not very good at it, or I folded soemthing wrong.  Either way, I just rolled it up in the cresant rolls, and that worked pretty good.

These were pretty tasty. I didn't add the onion and used dried parsley but kept everything else the same.  My only complaint is that the crescents get mushy quickly.  I like the idea of using the filling in little tartlets and will probably try that instead of making these again.  Nice flavor and presentation though!

We used Pillsbury croissant mix, and the only change we made was that we added a little sugar to the filling to add another interesting dimension.  This was absolutely to die for!  I am going to make this again, and again, and again!
