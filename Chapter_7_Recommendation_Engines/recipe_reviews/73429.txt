Not a fan of this one. I seemed to be missing something.

LOVE Very few modifications too. My local grocery didn't have the jar of apricots so I used a jar of "simply fruit" apricot preserves instead--which actually saved a lot of chopping and recombining. I added a little extra sesame oil because I love it doubled the garlic cloves and doubled the cayenne; next time I'll double the cayenne again because it still had no bite at all but I like spice. It wasn't specific about how much vegetable oil to use so I used enough to almost deep-fry the chicken garlic and green onions (OK didn't spring for shallots. Sue me.) When that was all done I put the food on a paper towel lined plate to drain dumped the used oil and brought the sauce mixture to a liquified boil. Then I transferred the food to a clean serving plate and poured the sauce over it. Rave reviews even from my picky partner! The only drawback at all is that it's definitely not diet food. At more than 400 calories a serving adding a starch (fresh baked bread from refrigerated dough for us; rice would also have been nice) and vegetable puts it over the top for how many calories we really want out of one meal. Too bad. It was delicious. Total real world kitchen time was still under an hour on the first time.

The sauce was disappointingly blandly tart. Will not make again.
