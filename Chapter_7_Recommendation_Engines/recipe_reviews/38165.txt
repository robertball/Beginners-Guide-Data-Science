Very good. For those who don't want to spend the money on fresh crab, you can use canned crabmeat (drain and flake it really well). I also cut down on some of the onion. I love blue cheese, crab, tomato, and croissants, so this is a great combination.

Super tasty! I use this with fresh dungeness crab and a little less of the rest of the ingredients. Reducing the other ingredients helps highlight the taste of fresh crab. Also, try baking on low heat for a couple of minutes for an excellent crab melt.

Pretty good. However, I felt 2/3 cup of blue cheese dressing was way TOO MUCH for 16 ounces (which I used instead of 12 ounces)! I also used Swiss cheese instead of Asiago. I would probably make this again and not add as much dressing or just substitute for another like Ranch.

This was extremely good!  Best lunch we have had in a very long time.  I served it with a spinach salad.  The only thing that I did different was leave out the bread crumbs because I did not have any.

It was a little dry so I added 1/2 fresh squeezed lime. Used the big jar of lump crab from Costco (wasn't blue crab). Served over a bed of lettuce. My family loved it!

Disappointed. The flavor of the bread crumbs coupled with the excessive blue cheese flavor was not a hit. No one finished their plate. maybe ranch would work better? or more mayo/less dressing? I really wanted to like this recipe... :/

Easy prep, had to add a little more BC and mayo...since I threw in the extra 4 ounces of crab from the can.  Handpicked lump blue crab was on sale at grocery...??.  Husband said "It's good"...around a mouthful of sandwich..high praise indeed.  Makes a very satisfying amount.  I might even take some over to the In-laws.  Would make again.  Easy thing to whip up to take to party, potluck etc.  I am not a cook, and even I could follow the recipe!
