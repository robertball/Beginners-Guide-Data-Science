I was not impressed with this crust.  It was certainly easy to make and it was sufficent with the custard pie that I made, but it just lacked the flavor needed for me to give it a 5.  A tip:  if using this crust with a cooked pie (as opposed to a bannana cream or something) DO NOT COOK THE CRUST SEPERATELY!  It will be overcooked.

This Recipe was fantastic, Highly recommend, except before baking I would suggest
sticking the crust with a fork before baking to prevent any bubbles from forming.
totally delicious, even my non-crust eating teenager gobbled it up..

Yummy, this crust was good. Ironically though, I am not a fan of most nuts so I substituted with Grape Nuts cereal and that worked very well. Very easy to prepare. This is also excellent with cheesecake. Great variation from boring old graham crackers!!

If you're looking for a tastier alternative to a graham cracker crust, this is it.  It's pretty yummy.  I don't know how you could get enough out of this recipe to use half for the crust and half for topping.  It has to be miswritten.  My modifications:  I toasted the pecans for a more intense flavor.  I also toasted some coconut and ground it up in my food processor and added that in.  The nuts and coconut came out to about 3/4 cup, so I decreased the flour by 1/4 cup.  That was a good change, and was awesome with coconut cream pie.

This was the first pie crust I have ever made. I baked a perfect pie crust to compliment a coconut cream pie.

I loved this crust! I used a ceramic pie plate and had difficulty getting the crust out intact. Next time I'll grease the pan.

This was my first attempt at making crust from scratch and it was EXCELLENT!! I didn't have any pecans so I used almonds instead. My husband loved it and it couldn't have been easier or quicker. If you're like me and terrible at rolling things out then this recipe is definitely for you.

This was delicious.  I surfed the net since I had extra pie filling but lacked pie crust.  Perfect pumpkin pie (using walnuts).  I'm not an avid cook and was very pleased how easy this was to make!  Hopefully I will find more receipes like this one!!!

Hmmm...this crust would have made a good cookie.  I loved the fact that it only took me about 5 minutes to make and it used melted butter rather than room temp.  I paired this with a French Silk Chocolate Pie which was a bad idea..(I should have used a more delicate crust).  I think this would be good with maybe a pumpkin or lemon pie.  I'm giving this 4 stars for the ease and taste..(it was like a pecan shortbread).  Thanks for sharing.

I have been baking and cooking since I was 10 years old. I have never gotten the knack for anything that has to be rolled out. This is a great recipe for those of us that are challenged in this way. Everything about this recipe was 5 star. Easy, quick and delicious! I made it for dessert for Easter Sunday. I made the Old Fashioned Coconut Cream Pie from this site. Everyone raved about the pie. My family considers me a good cook, but even I have to admit this pie was exceptional. It will be on the most requested list for our family holidays from now on. I wouldn't even think of any other pie crust for any cream pie from now on. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to use it all for the crust on a 9" pie. I did not save any for the top as I had home made whipped cream with toasted coconut for the top of my pie. Please, please, please try this, you will not be disappointed! Thank you for a great recipe!

It's very tasty. Very simple and is a snap to make. I had this crust paired up with chocolate pudding mixed with 1/2 a tub of coolwhip and used the other 1/2 for the topping. My friends raved about it at a party.

This rating is probably mostly my fault.  I only had walnuts on hand, so used them instead.  Would be much better with the pecans, I'm sure.  Also, This didn't make much crust for me.....I only ended up with a bottom crust.  Not sure how I could've messed that up.  I might try this again, as it's easy enough, and maybe I can figure out where I went wrong.

Perfection!  Toasted the pecans, then used  this crust with Sweet Potato Pie.  This amount made one pie crust; don't pre-bake crust, gets pretty dark with baking.

I loved this have made it more than a few times - always sooo tasty, I did change one thing and I have continued to do so - I use 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of rolled quick cooking oats instead of 1 whole cup of flour.  thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

Absolutely fantastic recipe!  I made it exactly like the recipe but used a lightly greased 10 inch glass  pie pan instead of the 9 inch. I used the whole recipe for the crust instead of saving half of it for the topping and it covered the pan nicely.  I did not bake it before putting the filling in.  I made the Cinnamon Pie from this site that was submitted by Sharon Miller and the crust complimented the pie superbly!  This is a real keeper.  Would have given it 10 stars if I could.  Will be making this often.

did not love this crust.  enjoyed the idea of not having to roll out the dough, but in practice it was a pain in its own way.  the dough was very dry and crumbly. I added another 2 tsp. of butter and that barely  helped.  then I prebaked it for about 8 min.  Used it with the cinnamon pie recipe from this site, but that pie cooks for like and hour and the crust was seriously over done by that point.  I guess the flavor was good, on the parts at the bottom that didn't burn, but overall, not loving this recipe.

Awesome, fast and easy.  I made one crust as stated for a coconut custard pie, then one with roasted peanuts for a peanut butter pie.  Awesome!  Loved the crust as much as the pie.  Do not however pre-bake if you are going to bake the filling.  Leave it uncooked, fill then bake.  Excellent.

I loved this recipe. This was my first time ever making a pie crust, and it was quick, easy and the best crust I have ever eaten. The first one I made with the pecans was a little difficult to press into the pan but was good, the second without the pecans was easy to press and tasted heavenly. 

I made this with the cinnamon pie recipe on this site and with the first one sort of overpowered the taste of the filling, but the second one complimented it perfectly because I added a little cinnamon. If you are not so big on pecans like me, I would recomend making this without them and adding a tbls of cinnamon and/or nutmeg.

This is so good, I could eat it plain.  I used this with a cream cheese cake recipe, using cream cheese and condensed milk...  It was excellent.  Today, I'm making my mom's rhubarb bars with this crust for a variation!

This is a fabulous crust. I used it with a custard pie and it added tremendously to the pie. I substituted the margarine with oil - something I'm normally leery to do with pie crusts - but it was fine.

This crust was wonderful as a flan base. I pressed all the ingredients into a flan pan and after it was cooked and cooled, I filled it with a cool whip/cream cheese/sugar mixture and topped it with fresh peaches and raspberries. I let it chill in the fridge. So easy, delicious and different. I'll be using this recipe a lot!

I almost rated this at four stars due to the crust sticking to the bottom of the pie pan but thought better of it as I might have left it cook too long, plus I used coconut instead of pecans.  Sweet, but not too sweet, crunchy, and best yet, EASY.  My kind of pie crust...a no-brainer for non-bakers! Thanks so much Sara!
