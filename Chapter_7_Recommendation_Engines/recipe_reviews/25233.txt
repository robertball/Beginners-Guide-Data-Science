So delicious. This takes me back to my childhood and family dinners. My Aunt made something like this for all holiday meals. I made this for Easter dinner a couple of weeks ago and my sister asked how I had gotten Our Aunts recipe when it was never written down. I now have this written down.

I served this today to a crowd of 12 tough critics. I liked it because I didn't want a "creamed" onion recipe and I needed a sugar-free side dish. This was perfect. No leftovers. I used small boiling onions and steamed them to tender. I sauteed them the night before and added all the remaining ingredients. I put it all into a container to marinade overnight (for convenience). The next day I put them in a pan over high heat and it thickened beautifully. I was very pleased with the result. I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks!

Used frozen pearl onions golden raisins and fresh thyme. Made exactly as written tasted and then added a good squeeze of a fresh orange wedge which gave it a nice hint of citrus and toned down the tomato-y flavor. A very nice "outside-the-box" side dish and I couldn't be happier with the way this turned out.
