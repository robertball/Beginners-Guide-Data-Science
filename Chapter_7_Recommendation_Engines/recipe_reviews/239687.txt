I've made this twice. Both times I seasoned the pork chops with a homemade taco seasoning and my husband grilled them. I add some of the taco seasoning to the sauce to give it more flavor.  And I served it with corn and stuffing. It's really good.

We enjoyed it. It was simple and jazzed up the pork nicely.

My store didn’t have the soup, so I substituted Gordo’s hot cheese dip. I should have only used half the milk so it would be a little thicker. But it was delicious! Pared with the Mexican spices nicely. This was quick and easy and a different way to enjoy pork chops!

This was just OK. The sauce was very tasty however it did not complement the Porkchop.

Very good. Add a little more milk to the soup so it's not so thick.

This was great!  I used thinner pork chops that did not take as long to cook.  My husband had two helpings!
