I think those who gave negative reviews should try it again. This came out exactly as I was hoping. I did tweak a couple of things, but nothing that would have made enough of a difference to believe it could have been as bad as some users experienced. I doubled the cinnamon and added about 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg. The apples I used were large, so maybe those who thought there were not enough apples should go ahead and add more. Also, the recipe does not specify light or dark brown sugar, so I used dark, as I thought that would go best in a Fall dessert. Beyond that, I think it's important to follow the mixing directions exactly. It's always important to make sure the flour, baking soda, and spices are distributed well, so sift them together or use a wire whisk to incorporate them. Mix the white sugar with the sliced apples (I actually diced the apples, to make certain there would be apple in every bite.) Finally, when adding the flour mixture, mix it in only until it's fully incorporated. Do not overmix, as this can lead to a tough cake. In my oven this cake took about an hour to bake, not the 45 minutes specified. I'm about to make the cake again tomorrow, it was that good! Oh, one more thought--use liquid measuring cups to measure liquids, and dry measuring cups to measure dry. And remember that when measuring flour you should lightly spoon the flour into the cup, and level off with the flat side of a knife. Don't measure flour by dipping the cup into the flour!

well, i really had high hopes for this recipes, but other than it being a REAL easy cake to make, i would not recommend it. It has an unappetizing texture, and it could have used far more apples and walnuts...probably more oil, as well. Better luck next time.

I added a sweet glaze to lock in some moisture and served with ice cream. Didn't 'wow' everyone, but went over well. (Glaze:2c powdered sugar and 4tbsp milk. Poured over after baking) Will definately do again.

I took this cake to card club and it went over great!  I will make this cake again, but I will add more cinnamon, and if serving as a dessert, it needs an icing. I put a cream cheese icing on the cake, with a hint of cinnamon in the icing. This cake is very heavy in the pan, but doesn't taste heavy when eating it.

This cake is great! I did add 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of mayo to make it moist after reading the comments and it came out fantastic! Moist, fluffy, and delicious. Due to reading the comments about it being bland I also added caramel topping which complemented the cake nicely .My husband and children loved it.

delicious moist cake.  The batter ends up feeling a bit dry, so I was put off by the phrase "pour batter into pan" -- but everything turned out PERFECT.  
Thanks. :)

Kind of ordinary as is, but much improved with a good drizzle of caramel topping!   I think a powdered sugar glaze would be good too, to jazz this up a bit.  I made no changes to the recipe itself, but I didn't mix the apples with the sugar.  Rather, I just folded the apples and walnuts in at the end.

This Was the best cake I have made in years, and it was so easy.   I did make a few changes.  I only use Self-rising flour so I had to omit a few items. What really surprised me was the amount of cake batter I had, I did not think it would all fit in the bunt pan, but it did and did not overflow the pan.  I had several apples on the counter that were starting to get a little old and they were just enough to make the cake.  Once again it is easy to make and everyone loved it.  I will make this on again.

I followed the recipe to a T. This cake turned out dense and dry. The cake was very dry on the outside but moist in the middle.

This  cake was delicious.  I added more apples and walnuts. When I took the cake out of the oven I poked holes all over it with a skewer and poured about a half a jar of caramel ice cream topping over it. It all soaked in and made a super moist cake that was fabulous warm with ice cream.

So good I couldn't wait for it to cool down! Had to have a piece. Didn't have walnuts but I had pecans. Just as tasty. That was the only deviation from the recipe. Don't need to change a thing! I used to make this years ago but had lost my recipe so I'm happy I found this one. Yum!!!

Turned out great! My changes were, 1/2 oil, and substituted 1/2 applesauce. 3/4 cup of white sugar instead of 1 cup. I used 3 large Granny Smith apples, cut into small chunks, peeled. It took a little longer in my oven, about 10 min. more. Dusted top with powdered sugar when cooled. I will definitely make again. Not dry, and a little less calories with the applesauce.

This-was-fantastic! I made for Thanksgiving dinner and drizzled with a bit of caramel sauce.  Will be making for Holiday potluck at work too!  I will reduce the sugar a bit, a little too sweet for me, but everyone else liked it sweet.... perfect texture, moist cake and crunchy walnuts. A huge winner!

This cake was delicious! I chopped the apples small and the nuts fine (my husband has infected my children into believing nuts don't  belong in food).  While the cake was warm I poured glaze over the whole thing. Everyone loved it!

Followed directions exactly, but also added healthy sprinkles of ginger and nutmeg. Used two pears and one apple. Better the next day. Moist, dense, cake with chunks of fresh fruit- will make again.

I make this yesterday, the taste was good but as soon as I cut into it...was crumbling apart. Any suggestions on what i did wrong or what I can do differently because I like to make this again.

Like the recipe, easy to make, good quantity lasts days for a family of 4. 
However, The batter ends up being thick so I add apple juice to thin it up.
Otherwise an all time favorite!

I did make a few changes, instead of 1 1/4 cups of oil, I used 3/4 C of oil and 1/2 C of applesauce. I also added about 1/3 C of raisins and less nuts. Topped with whipped cream! YUM!!

I made a gluten free version of it using rice and other gluten free flours, Turbinado sugar and xanthan gum and left out the salt. Definitely a moist, flavorful cake. I will make it again :)

I made this exact & it's in the oven but there is WAY too much flour in this recipe; I'd say a cup too much.  I have been baking for years & this is the thickest cake batter I've ever seen. I actually broke a spatula while stirring it.  And this was after I added extra water to thin it out a bit.  I also toasted the walnuts before adding to the batter.  We'll see how it turns out.

Didnt have any problem making this. This come out awesome for me and isnt going to last very long! I tweaked the recipe for my use. 
 I used a quart of sliced canned apples, used the juice from the apples(about one and a quarter cup juice, 1/4 cup additional brown sugar, an extra egg, and 3/4 cup more of flour.

I made 1/2 a recipe in an 8x8 pan.  I loved it!  I made a caramel sauce to go on top, but I honestly enjoyed it without the sauce.

I made this for the first time this afternoon and it really came out well.  I did make a few changes. First, I diced the apples like other reviewers suggested. Then, I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar and apples. Last, instead of using the full 1 1/4 cups oil, I only used a cup and substituted 1/4 apple juice for the last 1/4 oil. Next time, I'll probably use 1/2 cup apple juice and 1/2 cup oil.
