I love this recipe! I have made some changes that make it easier for me on a weeknight: I put the chicken (sometimes I even use frozen-solid breasts or thighs) in a crockpot with the taco seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, chopped onion + a little water in the morning.  Then when I get home from work the chicken is easily shredded and I add the other filling ingredients to the crock pot and stir it up. Then I just assemble per the directions.  I also use green sauce instead of red. This way it only takes 15min to get them in the oven and the meat tastes great from simmering all day in the spices.  Thanks Angela!

I don't care for the rating system on this site. There are so many bad recipes that get 2 or 3 stars, that the 5 star rating doesn't due this recipe justice. These are the best enchiladas I have ever tasted, and my entire family agrees. I have used over 100 recipes from this site, and this is one of the few that is a true 5 star recipe.

These are  without a doubt THE BEST Chicken Enchiladas I have ever eaten.It makes a HUGE batch. My only suggestion is to keep the breasts whole while simmering in water (it makes them easier to shred).This is the only enchilada recipe I will ever use .Thanks Angela!!!

This was very good, as is. But with a few minor changes, you can make this in  a LOT less time (and less dishes!). As another reviewer mentioned, I placed the frozen chicken breasts in a crock pot on low with chili powder, onion, taco seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder. That evening I shredded the chicken inside the crock pot in under 2 minutes, added the green chilies, and lime juice. In a separate bowl I mixed the cream of chicken, sour cream and more chili powder. I omitted the butter all together saving calories, and it won't be missed. Then I layered half the cream sauce on the bottom of the 9x13 inch pan and mixed the rest into the chicken mixture still in the crock pot. Then I placed a layer of tortillas (I used corn) in the pan, followed by the entire chicken mixture, cheese, another layer of tortillas, enchilada sauce, cheese, and olives. Prep time for the entire meal was 10 minutes. Trust me, you won't be disappointed! Next time I will use green enchilada sauce (personal preference for chicken.)

This was incredible...everyone loved it! 

Oh, and I realized when I got home from the store that I forgot cream of chicken soup....so I consulted the interwebs and ended up with a great recipe to remedy that exact problem: 

I put three tablespoons of butter in a small pan, let it get nice and hot, whisked into it one or one and a half tablespoons of flour until it formed a nice roux....then I whisked in a half cup of chicken broth and a half cup of milk...and this made, to my surprise...an EXACT replica (except better) of campbells cream of chicken soup. It was so good, that I can honestly say I will quickly whip that together any time I find a recipe that calls for cream of chicken soup.

These enchiladas were super, super good. I LOVE enchiladas and these totally hit the spot and were exactly what you think of in your head, when you say to yourself "man, I'd love some enchiladas!"...GO FOR IT!

Very good recipe - I would suggest grilling the chicken breasts on the gas grill instead of poaching them to give them a deeper flavor.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin and 1/2 cup of salsa to the chicken mixture to take it up a notch.  If you have a gas stove, place the tortillas on the burner of the stove for about 20 seconds to gently char them before filling and rolling them.

Really, really good!  You may THINK you don't have enough liquid while the mixture is simmering, but you will be wrong.  These were addictive.  Hint:  If you want to save time, you can pick apart a rotisserie chicken instead of shredding breasts, but shredding the meat really isn't as time-consuming as I thought it would be (about 10 minutes).  I also used double the enchilada sauce because I like to have extra, that was personal preference.

The enchilada filling was outstanding!!! But, make sure you use a good enchilada sauce, otherwise it will overpower the delicate chicken flavors. All in all, a great dish! UPDATE: I made just the filling (without the sour cream/cream of chicken soup/chili powder) for burritos, and they were AMAZING!!! Quick way to get the great flavor of this dish without having to go through all the steps of enchiladas.

Very good!  I made a lower fat version by using non-fat sour cream and reduced fat cream of chicken soup.  Also, I added some salsa, extra lime juice, and garlic powder to the soup/sour cream mixture.  I like mine extra saucy so I also made sure to double the soup/sour cream mixture.  Yum!

I give it 5 stars for ingredients but honestly think you are going through too much trouble.  I make a casserole instead of rolling out enchiladas since that adds more work AND if you do it casserole style, you get more servings out of it.  It tastes INCREDIBLY authentic this way as well.  The only ingredients I choose to use that are different is I omit the medium onion and olives and use corn tortillas instead of flour.  Here's how I do it.  I boil and shred the chicken and add it to all of the other ingredients into a bowl including half of the cheese and 1/4 enchilada sauce and mix together to make a "mix."  Take your casserole dish and coat the bottom of it with some enchilada sauce and set aside. I then scorch each tortilla one by one in a skillet on medium heat for with a little oil for 10 seconds or until soft and layer the bottom  of a casserole dish. Take the mixture, spread over the tortillas evenly and sprinkle with cheese.  Keep layering until you get to the top, cover with remaining green sauce and sprinkle with remaining cheese.  Cover dish with foil and pop into the oven!  25-30 minutes later you uncover and let it bake for about 5 more minutes to set.  THE END!

These were incredible! The only change I made was to leave out the green onions with the chicken mixture. They already had onions in them, so I figured adding them on top was good enough--and it was! Also, I made my own enchilada sauce (given 5 stars on this site). This dish was a huge hit, and will definitely be my "go-to" enchilada recipe.

These are awesome. I've made them twice and each time my family goes back for seconds and with no left over. I made extra this past weekend and took over to my father-in-law who raved about them. My son and his two friends chowed down on them. Of course, no left overs. They are that good. Very good recipe.

This has been in my box for months and I finally made them yesterday.  It is a good recipe in many respects.  However, for the time it takes it doesn't deliver enough on flavor.  I followed others' advice and did the chicken in the crock with taco seasoning and with a 1/4 cup of jarred jalapenos in juice to up the flavor of the chicken which was excellent advice.  When simmering the chicken in the skillet, I replaced the water with a 16 oz jar of fire-roasted salsa and tossed in a can of corn for color and texture.  Given the amount of work that goes into it, we were expecting some knock-your-socks-off Mexican flavor.   Even with the onions, the chilies, all the seasonings, the salsa and the enchilada sauce, we all found it a little bland.   It was pleasant and I'm sure kids and those who don't like spice/heat would love it.  But if you're looking for a good solid spicy enchilada, you'll probably be a bit disappointed.

Super Ultra Mega Great!  It was exactly what I wanted for Cinco de Mayo.  I moved from California to Pennsylvania and had a hankering some good tasting enchiladas... I got them!  Thank you.

Authentic enchiladas are made with corn tortillas and do not have any type of soup.  While this dish is okay, it should be called a mexican casserole.

Based on the reviews these enchiladas had been receiving I really expected more.  The first batch that I made were average, at best.  The flavor is not at all robust, it's sort of a generic tasting enchilada.  Perhaps something you might pick up at like a chain mexican restaurant.  I found that the recipe could be improved with about 1-2tsp of cumin thrown in with the chicken, as well as 2-3 cloves fresh garlic and a bit of extra chili powder.  These are then fantastic when topped off with a little green salsa and cilantro.  Also, I fried the enchiladas on both sides to crispy before I put them in the baking pan, it kept them from becoming too mushy.

Wow... these were great! A bit time-consuming, but worth it. I used a half of a rotissiere chicken from the deli, which helped. I suggest before adding the enchilada sauce and cheese, spray the shells with cooking spray and bake on 425 for 10 minutes to crispen. I then added the sauce and cheese and finished baking at 350 for 15 minutes. I also added 1/4 tsp ground red pepper for a little heat... yum!

ok..i know i probably should not rate this..but i'm certainly not giving a low rating. i did tweak this. no cream of chicken,chili powder,taco seasonings,onion powder,and i forgot the olives...i would have added those if i remembered. i used the rest of a roterrise bird, nacho cheese sauce, meduim salsa, and more cheese and the rest of the listed ingredients. i served it atop rice and black beans. i made it 2 days ago...i forgot there was left-overs. the wife comes running in the house ( i'm in the bathroom) laughing and runs out with the left-overs. it's that good! ya try this!

I made these the other night to take to work and they were amazing! I pretty much followed the recipe, except that I used about half breast meat and half thigh meat. I also coated the meat in taco seasoning and browned it for a few minutes before boiling it. I used half water and half chicken broth to boil it in. Because I was making it to be eaten a few hours later, I was worried about it getting soggy. So I used corn tortillas instead. I also used only about half the soup mixture. I added about half the enchilada sauce when baking, and took along some more to be added when reheating them. There was no sogginess. I used smaller 5-inch tortillas and there was enough to make 20 enchiladas. One person even said they were the best thing he had ever eaten! Will definitely be adding these to my rotation! Thanks for a great recipe!

5 Stars for how pretty this looks when it comes out of the oven - great for potluck or casual company.  4 1/2 stars for taste -  Made a second time with 2 cups chicken and 2 cups black beans.  Also used less green chiles.

For those of you wondering how much shredded chicken 2lbs is, here's the answer. I always poach (very soft boil) quite a bit of chicken at a time to freeze for the future. But it makes it hard to figure out what you need for a recipe!  For this recipe, you will need 3 1/2 cups of loose shredded chicken to equal the 2lbs needed. If you chop it up small it will only be about 3 cups.

Oh, my gosh!  I have never rated any of the recipes I've tried, but I absolutely had to write in on this one!  I have never tasted enchiladas better than these.  They are better than restaurant quality!  I found that instead of making 5 servings, this recipe made 8 servings easily.  2 pounds of chicken/filling is too much for only 5 enchiladas.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!  This is definitely a keeper!

These are totally what their name states - AWESOME!  For a shortcut, use cooked deli chicken and just mix all of the ingredients together . I made this exactly as written the first time, then mixed all ingredients together without all of the other "steps" the second time. Result? Same great enchilada - so I will cut the steps to save time in the future. Thank you for a great recipe!

We thought these would be full of flavor because of everything the recipe calls for, but we actually found them to be bland.  We will not be making them again.

The recipe is great as is. but my only major change I had to do is that it needs to be corn tortillas. I never ever ever use flour tortillas in enchiladas. Other than that the only thing i did different was when i boiled my chicken i used my own taco seasoning and only had 1 cup sour cream.

I can rate it five stars because of the feedback I received when I served this to 60+ hungry people.  I adjusted the recipe to serve 48 people, and, yes, shredding 12 pounds of chicken was time consuming, but be assured the recipe will do well when adjusted for more than 8. A+ Cookiegirl

I'm dissapointed!  I made this recipe just as wriiten.  I had expected from the "overwhelming" possitive ratings that it would be a 10!  To me (and my wife) it was pretty bad.  The ingredients were superb.  Actually the flavor was good.  The problem is that it became a cheese nightmare.  (That's coming from a Wisconsin boy).  There is way too much liquid in this to ever end up very good.  I was surprised at using flour tortillas to begin with.  All they do is soak up the enchilada sauce and all the cheese, they were a soaked mess.  The filling would be so much better if you stopped short of the (cream of chicken soup and sour cream).  Since trying it, I have really given thought to how you could make this better, I just can't without losing some key flavors. This recipe would be a better mexican dip than an entre.  Oh and the prep time estimate is right on, just add an extra hour for all the dirty dishes this creates.

I doubled the recipe and used taco sized tortillas.  10 tortillas per 9 x 13 pan.  One pan I topped with green enchilada sauce and one with red enchilada sauce.  Some guests preferred one over the other but it was about 50% for the green and 50% for the red sauce.

Sorry, but  I did not love the flavors..I think it was the chicken soup layer that did not seem to go with the mexican taste I was looking for. I might try this again without the soup and add more of a salsa sauce.

I followed what the 1st reviewer did...which was to place most of the ingredients in a crock pot...I also agree that shredding the chicken is the most time consuming part. They turned out GREAT!! Will definitely make again..My daughter is not a fan of Mexican food but she loved them.

Everyone really enjoyed this. Hubby said he could eat these once a week. I used chicken stock instead of water and left out the olives (none of the kids will eat them). Very easy with great results.

Very easy recipe and very good.  Cut back on prep time by using a food processor to shred chicken and used spicy taco seasoning to give it a little kick.

To give the chicken a nice flavor, if you are not fond of the "bland taste" boiled chicken has, I recommend taking the shredded chicken and mixing it with the taco seasoning packet and simmering it in the microwave in a covered dish for 2 minutes.  It helps marry a nice flavor to the chicken before continuing with the recipe... plus you are using the taco seasoning in this anyway. :O)  Hope you enjoy!

I used left over roasted sticky rotisserie chicken from this site to prepare this recipe.  It wasn't a knock my socks off enchilada recipe but it wasn't bad either.  It was a little bland for my tastes though.  I think the chicken soup/sour cream mixture could have been amped up a little with some jalapenos or something.  I think with some tweaking, this recipe would better suit our tastes.

Wow, these were so good and surprisingly easy! I used left over smoked chicken thighs, and I made 6 enchiladas instead of 5. The only thing I omitted was the green onions and the black olives. I served with a cheesy Mexican rice, and it was delicious. They are extremely filling. I desperately wanted to eat 2 because they were so good, but I just couldn't! This is certainly a keeper. I've always put off enchiladas because I thought they would be complicated, but this recipe was very easy!

I really liked this recipe, I'm not one to cook a lot of Mexican but wanted to switch it up a bit.  I have a few family members who love Mexican and they pronounced this better than their favorite Mexican restaurants.  I thought the preparation was easy, and the ingredients were straight forward.  Don't get discouraged by the multiple steps - it ended up being a very simple process that looked more complicated. on paper than it was in reality.  The only change I would make is to find a good recipe for enchilada sauce, canned lacked in flavor and punch - it worked but homemade sauce would pull this together for me.

These were AMAZING. I didn't add any water, I just added a few splashes of broth (maybe a half cup or more). I cooked them covered and didn't need to baste with sauce at all, they came out perfect.

Wicked good! I've simplified some steps by just mixing them together and microwaving them. But all in all I've made them twice and they are SO GOOD! I do make extra sauce though! I like them moist! Making them again tonight!

Definitely delicious!!  I skipped the cream soup and made a white sauce instead of butter, flour, milk, chicken broth, salt and pepper, and then stirred in the sour cream and chili powder to that sauce.  We also ate the enchiladas with jarred jalapenos scattered on top.  Loved them!

Not quick and not easy, but worth the effort!  My wife had a hankering for Enchiladas and loved these.   . . . One of the few real five star recipes. . .  Stores well & great left overs.  Here's a first, I did not change or add anything, can you believe it.  This one is well thought out for the average palate.   We lived in the Southwest states for many years and loved the cooking.  Thank you Angela for a taste of the Southwest.

This recipe was just OK.  I have no idea what the need for so much of the soup mixture is.  I would use 1/2 as much as it called for at most to make it creamy.  I ended up tasting cream of chicken soup with every bite which I shouldn't when eating a Mexican enchilada.

These were great.  I had been making the Chicken Enchiladas II recipe from this site for a few years now, and was looking for something a little different from that one. The spices in this definately do make a big difference.  It was a nice change, and the kids really enjoyed it.  The chili powder and taco seasoning give it just the right amount of kick without being overly spicey.  I will definately be making this one again.  Thanks.

As I took my first bite, I was immediately transported to an authentic Mexican restaurant; I actually closed my eyes to savor it all.  My kids were thinking the same thing - as I was daydreaming, one of them piped up, "Now all we need is a basket of chips!"  I took a few shortcut suggestions from previous reviewers and did one thing on my own to make prep time quicker: I used both thigh and breast meat and let my food processor "shred" the chicken BEFORE cooking.  I then added about 1/4 c. or so of chicken broth to my frying pan and cooked the onions until pearly.  I then added the taco seasoning mix, onion/garlic/chili powders along with 1/2 tsp. of cumin and let that cook a few minutes to "open" the fragrances of the spices.  I then added the chicken along with the lime juice, green chiles and a small can of black beans.  I also made it layered a la Lasagna style since I was crunched for time.  It worked great!  I put 1/2 the chicken soup/sour cream as the bottom layer in the pan (I doubled both since I love the creaminess but make according to directions if you don't like that consistency).  Then I added a layer of the flour tortillas, the chicken mixture, enchilada sauce, and cheese.  I repeated it and topped with remaining cheese and baked on 375 for 50 minutes.  I used all low-and-no fat ingredients for the sour cream, soup, and cheeses and the flavor was still out of this world.  Served with shredded lettuce and Mexican rice.  Definitely a keeper and in "The" rotation.

Really good, though time consuming.  I used canned chicken, which helped.  I'm also always frustrated when the tortillas break as I'm assembling the enchiladas.  Fantastic taste, though!

AMAZING!!! I followed the recipe EXACTLY as is and took this to my work for a going away pot luck, my point being that about 10 different people tried these and were blown away and asked for the recipe.  Okay, so I did change one thing, and that was using smaller tortillas so i could have several smaller enchiladas instead of 5 big ones. Either way, yummmmm yummmm! Made these twice in one week.  
MY ADVICE: Cook the chicken pieces whole and it does save you time shredding bigger pieces, and while the whole pieces are cooking, you can prep everything else.  It literally cut my total time in half.

For all of the seasoning that went into this, surprising I found it bland. I don't know why! I won't use this recipe again, I have found others on this site that are much better.
And when you shred the chicken, forget dirtying two forks and just use your hands. Let it cool for 5-10 minutes and go to town. Your hands work much better.

These were just okay. I used corn tortillas, not a fan of flour tortillas. I just think I prefer beef enchiladas.

My hubby said, "This is AWESOME!"  He didn't even know the name of the recipe!  So there you go!  For me, this was comfort food for my little granddaughters, and that was my motive for using this recipe.  I did a couple of things I normally wouldn't have done.  I used a rotisserie chicken from Costco thinking it would save time.  But it really didn't.  And the white meat from the chicken breast would have been way better.  I used the Safeway brand of cream of chicken soup, and I didn't think it compared at all to Campbell's.  The recipe said that it served 8 but called for only 5 tortillas.  Still can't figure that one out.  I made 8-8" flour tortillas and still had the meat left over.  It was a mild, comforting recipe that I will probably make again but with a few changes (use the 7-oz can of green chilies, more than 3 cups of cheddar, a little spicier chile verde on the side).  Serve this with some Mexican Rice II from this site for sure!  All in all, a 5!  Thanks, Angela!

shreddd chicken is the easiest thing.....just put boneless chix breast FROZEN in the crock pot.  Put your spices in (I used cumin, chili, paprika, cayenne, red pepper flakes) in the morning, cover on high,y 3 or so its tender, shreddable, juicy and a snap to shred.  I make a bunch ahead of time....

Wow, I tried this with what I had on hand it was great.  Here are my changes based on the contents of the frig.  We like some spice at my house.  To the onions I added a tomatillo and a jalapeño (seeds and all) and a garlic clove.  After I pulled the chicken out of the water I let it keep boiling and reduce and added that water as my water for this recipe and the Spanish rice.  My husband will not eat sour cream =(  I did the unthinkable I subbed ricotta cheese.  Not as much but I added about a tablespoon of sour cream all I can get away with.  I hit it with a dash of white vinegar to sour it up a tad.  I had to do one more adjustment, I made taco season from a recipe on this site but it doesn’t have the thickener that the store bought loaded with salt has.  So I added some File.  It’s a decent thickener.  My hubby gave it a 9 of ten.    I really don’t like using canned soup as they are really bad for you so I will try something else for that next time maybe a avocado puree or Spanish cheese sauce.  The tomatillo was a great addition and the pepper.  The cheese actually worked well but who knows what will be on hand next time.  Last thing, I use 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts from Sam’s and I had a lot of meat left over.  Next time two large ones are fine.

I doubled the recipe and used low fat sour cream.  It turned out GREAT.  Didn't look like enchiladas.  I gave some to a friend, and after he tasted it, he knew what it was.  It's just because of the sauce and cheese, doesn't allow the the enchiladas to present itself.  Looks more like a casserole.  It's a keeper.  For me, I like it a little spicier.

This is a great recipe, but I have to admit...I didn't follow it exactly.  I didn't boil my chicken breasts, because you get so much more flavor from panfrying.  To cook chicken breasts, I sprinkle salt, pepper, and chili powder over both sides of chicken.  Fry them in vegetable oil and a pat of butter until lightly browned.  Meat does not have to be completely done.  Put breasts in a glass bowl with the juices from pan (deglazed by a little water).  Cover with foil and continue to cook in 350 degree oven while preparing the rest of the dish.  Sorry, but I didn't time it.  Also, instead of adding 1 cup of water, add enough water to chicken juices in the bowl to equal 1 cup.  Add that to the meat mixture instead of straight water.  I'm sure this recipe is much less healthful, but these simple steps add LOTS of flavor.  I fixed the recipe by the directions the first time, and everyone liked them.  The second time, I made it like I stated here, and my husband thought it was a completely different recipe.  He raved over it.  Even my PICKY kids loved them.

This is not a good recipe for enchiladas. This is a great recipe for soggy burritos. For something similar, but less soggy and tastier, check out the recipe for burrito pie! 
Enchiladas are made with corn tortillas, by the way.

This is now a standard recipe at our house.  I give it four stars and not five because I had to make a significant number of tweaks for this to be a keeper.  The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with a soggy horrible mess.  The sour cream sauce in the bottom of the pan turns the tortillas into muck.  So instead, I make a half batch of the sour cream sauce and add it all into the chicken mixture before filling the tortillas.  After the tortillas are filled, I bake them, without any sauce for twenty minutes, then cover with cheese and turn on the broiler until the cheese is bubbly and the tortillas begin to crisp up.  Then at serving, I spoon on green enchilada sauce.  Delicious!  I also use fresh chilies instead of canned, and use the juice of one whole lime (instead of just a teaspoon).  I think the extra lime adds so much great flavor!

The only thing good about this recipe is the flavor of the filling.  I have never had to throw away a dish from All Recipes but this went in the trash.  The soup mix on the bottom turned the tortillas slimy and was a texture nightmare.  Actually much more difficult recipe than regular chicken enchiladas and I won't be using this one again!  If you want to try it use pepper jack cheese to give it more of a kick.
Expensive waste of time!

Really good! The sour cream sauce is so good. I will probably put a little bit less on the chicken next time because it was a little much but the flavor is awesome. 
Will also probably try to make my own enchilada sauce because the canned ones don't really do it for me. Otherwise this was amazing.

Ohhhhh myyyyyy goooodnesssss, these were AWESOME, indeed!!!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used a 2 lb. 10 oz. rotisserie chicken instead of boiling my own.  I also used queso fresco (next time I will try chihuahua cheese) instead of cheddar.  I was afraid the cheddar would be too oily/greasy.  And I used 1.5 cans enchilada sauce because I only had 10" tortillas and this recipe was enough to make 9 of those instead of 5 larger ones.  Anywho, these were awesome and everybody enjoyed them.  This is up there on my "the best thing I ever made" list. Absolutely amazing. I can't wait to have company over and make these for them!  Served with a side of spanish rice and some refried beans.

I SUGGEST MAKING THE "10 Minute Enchilada Sauce" from this site, absolutely amazing with these enchiladas, way better than store bought sauce!

Loved this, and so did my entire family. Like another reviewer, I cooked my chicken breasts in the slow cooker (I used some all-purpose seasoning, an onion and 8 cloves of garlic, then shredded the chicken and saved the broth for another recipe). I subbed the sour cream for fat free plain yogurt, which was a great move! The sauce was AMAZING and my brother in law said it was his favorite dish I'd made... and he doesn't throw around compliments. I kept all the ingredients separate until 30 minutes before time to eat, so they never got mushy. I also did this for leftovers... I only cooked what we were about to eat, since the #1 complaint around here about enchiladas is the sogginess. Oh, I also made my own enchilada sauce (Red Enchilada Sauce off this site, but I added a little sugar and that helped the flavors come together somehow). Delicious!

Really yummy!  Followed the crockpot suggestion to cook chicken.  Just mixed soup, sour cream, and chile powder without heating.  Used green sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious. I put the chicken in the crockpot with spices and let it cook for 6 hours. Shredded easily and then added the soup and sour cream. I made 8 large burritos with that filling as written. My kids loved this recipe! Not too spicy but great flavor. I also used green sauce. Will use this one again for sure!

WOW!  This is the best enchiladas I've ever had!  I followed most of the recipe only because I ran out of time but next time I think I'm going to put the chix in a crock pot with the seasonings.

I had been planning to cook this for a few days now and was really excited to impress my family.  I was nervous because we've been eating enchiladas at the same mexican restaurant for over 20 years and I knew this was going to be different, but hoped it would be as good.  I had read reviews about it being the tortillas getting soggy, so I mixed the chicken with all of the soup mixture early in the day, then just folded the tortillas and put them in the baking dish right before we wanted to eat, and topped that with enchilada sauce.  My family LOVED it!!  I should have put a little of the enchilada sauce or something down first, the bottoms were a little dry was the only advice I got from my testers.  Otherwise awesome!!  Everyone agreed it was a "repeat"!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

These are fabulous! While I'm sure they're great with flour tortillas, I have to say that using corn tortillas warmed in olive oil added the flavor and texture that made them the best ever. This deserves more than five stars!

This is delicious!  I used light sour cream and green olives and it was delicious!  Use low-sodium soup if you can find it, the taco mix makes it salty enough.

Great recipe, family loved it. You can pull this one off with low-fat ingredients (cheese, sour cream, soup...even low-carb tortillas) with no discernible difference in flavor or texture. I know, because I've made it both ways. That said, if you can, go low fat and I guarantee you'll never miss the calories you never had.

I added a little extra sour cream and I used corn tortillas and softened them up in a little conola oil and then dipped them into enchilada sauce before filling with the chicken mixture.  I had enough mixture to make 12 enchiladas and then I added refried beans and made 10 burritos with flour tortillas.  Everyone loved it.

These were better than in any restaurant I have ever went to.  I only did two things different.  I had made a pulled pork recipe from this site and had leftovers, so I used the pork!  DELICIOUS!  The other thing was that I only put the sour cream mixture (the one cup) in with the enchiladas and not at the bottom of the pan.  The inside of these enchiladas is SOOOO tasty!  The secret is in the seasonings!!! Thank you so much.  I can't wait to make them for my mother, the Enchilada Lover.
UPDATE:  This is still my favorite recipe and my mother asks for them all the time.  I quit putting the sour cream mixture inside the enchiladas and I go to the local store and picke up a rotisserie chicken.  This has cut the time in half and makes it an easy meal to make on a weekday/work day.  They still taste absolutely delicious.  I get the best raves about this recipe.

These were ok but way to bland for our tasting. If I make again I will definitely spice things up with some jalapenos or something.

This is a great recipe.  Just enough bite, but not enough to worry about if you are afraid of spicy food.
Made it several times...always get asked for recipe.

A lot of work for these and they were just ok.  Kinda slimey on the bottom which I didn't care for.  I did follow the directions exactly except making 9 6" tortillas.  Not sure I'd go to all the trouble for this again.

I used this recipe before trying any of the other recipes I read. Excellent. Very tasty and full of flavor. The only thing i may do different next time is use a little more cream of chicken and sour cream mixture when simmering with chicken mixture before adding to tortillas. I only used 1.5 pounds of chicken.

Best enchiladas I've had.  Cooked chicken tenderloins in pressure cooker for 25 minutes. As I took them out, they were falling apart, so shredding step was eliminated.   Didn't have lime juice, substituted lemon pepper seasoning.  Added cumin and Tony Chacheres seasoning.  AMAZING is all my family could say!

The only changes I made were to use corn tortillas because we like the taste better, and reduced fat cream of chicken soup.  These were a bit time consuming, but worth every second.  I just re-joined Weight Watchers, so I won't be making these again real soon, but I'll miss them.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this for the first time last week.  My husband took one bite and his eyes rolled back in his head!  Lol.  He raved the entire length of the meal and then declared this his new favorite meal.  He also sent me to the store specifically so I could make it again.  :) 5 stars!

Made this tonight exactly as written and it was amazing!  Not too spicy or cheesy.  Very, very good as written.  Next time I think I will add black beans and corn to the chicken mixture.  Thanks for a great recipe Angela.

These make the best enchiladas. Per another reviewers suggestion I started using my crockpot to make the chicken. Its so easy to throw the chicken in the crockpot along with all the spices and let it simmer all day. I think it flavors the meat better as del and cuts down on the time shredding chicken!

These were great! I made only a couple of minor changes. First of all, I have two small shildren so I used five 6" flour tortillas rather than the 12" ones so that they would be smaller. I cut the recipe in half and used a square casserole dish rather than the 9 x 13 dish and they fit perfectly. Just line four of them up side by side at the top of the dish and lay the other one at the bottom going the other direction. The only thing I did differently was to drain my green chilies into the soup mixture and I omitted the black olives because I didn't have any on hand but will add them next time I make these. My hubby said these were even better than the ones at the Mexican restaurant we frequently go to. I served them with Spanish rice, Ranch beans and some fresh Pico de Gallo (also from this website) and, of course, chips and dip. This was my first attempt at enchiladas and I was very surprised at how easy it was. I will be making these again and again. Thanks for sharing!

We loved these enchiladas. They had great flavor and texture. We will definitely make them again. I think my chicken was a bit dry or something so I ended up using more like 2 cups of water in the simmering steps but other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out to be excellent!

First time making enchiladas, and the fam gobbled 'em right up! I cooked the chicken, taco seasoning and some water in a crock pot from nearly 3 hours, shredded it, then returned it to the crock, added the cream of chicken, squeezed the whole lime into the mix, then assembled the enchiladas without having any sauce on the bottom of the dish. I poured some enchilada sauce pver it, but saved about half the can to be poured on individually. I also topped with a TON of cheese. The fam wants this added to the regular rotation. :-)

Five stars!!! This is our favorite enchilada recipe hands down! I didn't change a thing either, ( except this last time I left out the green onions just to save my husband the heartburn, but they were still "awesome!) everytime, it never fails. Thank you for posting this one!

For the effort it took I think it tasted very similar to Chicken Enchiladas II on this site.  I just would adjust that one by added some taco seasoning and enchilada sauce- it's much faster.  I would definitely use a costco chicken as it's much cheaper and faster than shredding your own after cooking.  thanks!

These were really good! Putting half the soup mixture on the bottom of the pan makes the enchiladas more gooey than I prefer, but the flavors were excellent. I think the step of heating the soup, sour cream and chili powder separately from the chicken can be skipped. Next time I'll just throw the sour cream, soup and chili in to the chicken once it has finished simmering.

My family devoured these enchiladas!  I used what I had on hand and substituted as needed.  
*cream of mushroom instead of  cream of chicken soup
*sweet onions instead of  green onions
*lemon juice instead of lime juice

I made a double batch so that I could freeze one tray for a quick dinner.

This recipe is perfect as written. That said, it is also very easy to adapt to what you have on hand. I have made this with both leftover shredded beef and pork, green enchilada sauce in place of red sauce, cream of celery or cream of mushroom soup in place of cream of chicken. All versions were equally well received in my big family! Thanks for the perfect go to recipe that works magic on leftovers.

These are really fantastic!  I made mine with 1.25 lbs ground beef instead of chicken which made it really easy... at step 2 instead of using the butter to cook the onion I just added my raw beef and cooked it with the onion and two cloves of garlic (minced) until mostly browned, then seasoned with the taco seasoning, added the chilies, finished the browning of the beef, added the green onion, and water.  (Skip the extra onion powder and garlic powder, but be sure to add the lime juice!)  Proceed with the recipe as written... Great recipe!!

I added  splashes of cinnamon and used chicken broth instead of water. It was the best enchiladas that we ever had!  Even better than we have had in MX.  Of course, I kicked up the flavoring ingredients a little.  I made the full recipe, which served 4 of us and froze the other half.

Loved these!!  The only difference is that I used 10" whole wheat tortillas (obviously not as tasty as flour, but they are healthier for you).  I was able to make 9 of these to serve my big family and they were fabulous - whole wheat or not!!  A little time consuming, but so worth it!!

Meh. I didn't really care too much for this recipe. The taco seasoning was overbearing...Next time I will omit about half of it and add some rice.

These were absolutely fabulous! I cooked the chicken in a crockpot in order to save a few steps. I used two large frozen restaurant style chicken breasts that I purchased in bulk at the warehouse store. Cut them in half, and they were still partially frozen when I placed them in a crockpot in the morning. I added the taco seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, and chopped onions to the crockpot along with 3 TBS of lime juice. That may be a little too much lime flavor for some people, but either way, I've found that 3 TBS is all the amount of liquid that is needed to be added to the crockpot in the morning. By afternoon, there is the perfect amount of flavorful juices in the crockpot for the chicken to soak up once it is shredded and placed back into the crockpot. 
I then followed the recipe instructions for assembling the enchiladas and sauce. The only other substitution I made was to use a packaged Mexican 4-cheese blend instead just the cheddar cheese. 
I will definitely make these again! This is a great alternative to the much more difficult to prepare beef enchilada recipe that I had previously been using, but my family always requests. Thanks so much! Oh, I almost forgot to add that I used 8 inch tortilla shells instead of the 12 inch that the recipe called for and I got 10 enchiladas out of this recipe! Definitely a bonus! :)

These are great! I only gave it 4 stars simply because I left out ingredients that I thought would throw the taste off. I didn't add lime or green onions and it turned out awesome. Another thing I done was use whole wheat, High Fiber tortilla, light sour cream and 97% fat free cream of chicken. It seems like a lot of these extra steps could be taken out. JMO Still, I'm glad I found this recipe. My family gobbled it up and that puts a smile on my face. Thanks for the recipe!!

I'm rating these at 4 stars because my husband loved them. I didn't think I would be able to really taste the lime juice but I did, and to me it didn't compliment the chicken. I will definately make again and omit the lime juice and maybe use 1/2 the chilis, as mine turned out too spicy for kids. The best chicken enchilada recipe I've tried to date.

Just personal taste but I did not care for these.  I followed the recipe and wasn't crazy about the cream of chicken/sour cream portion of this dish.  I found it off putting.  I guess I just like red sauce only chicken enchiladas.  I have to say my sister loves this recipe so maybe it just wasn't for me!

We really liked this recipe.  My only suggestion to change anything would be not to boil the chicken, ours didn't shred well and I couldn't stand the flavor.  However, my husband (who hates everything) really like these!

The ONLY reason that I'm giving this recipe three stars is because I really think it could be simplified and taste the same IF NOT better. For one, the sour cream sauce was just overkill that was not needed and I really didn't care for. It was just too much. I followed another reviewer's advice and put my chicken and spices in the crock pot together. I added chicken broth in just for liquid. This is a much easier route for busy parents (like me). I think I will follow this recipe ingredient wise (minus sour cream sauce) in the future.

These are the best enchiladas EVER....This will always be my default recipe.  I usually cook and shred the chicken the night before to make it easier.  My whole family loves this. Always have to double the recipe to make everyone happy!!! Great recipe

I absolutely love this recipe, and honestly, the creamy chicken filling is to die for. I make a mole sauce to top the enchiladas, but I bet this would be as amazing with a tomatillo sauce. Magnifique!

These are definitely awesome! I only changed a couple things such as I left out the green onions,olives, onion powder and garlic powder.  I added an extra tsp of lime juice, and I didn't have a taco seasoning mix so I used the Taco Seasoning 1 from this site. I also used Light sour cream and 98% fat free cream of chicken soup. Thanks so much for the recipe Angela!

I have never made enchiladas and these were absolutely delicious! I cheated and bought grilled chicken to save time, and also used low fat, low sodium products and they still turned out fabulous and were gone in seconds!

These are absolutely delicious. I've never had Chicken Enchiladas before, however, I think it would be difficult o find any better! My son, who is not much into spicy things, ate 3 of these. He liked them that much.    The only change I made was to use a homemade taco seasoning, as I had no package (1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon each garlic powder, chili powder and onion powder).   I think the cayenne added a bit of  kick as there was some extra heat in mine. Next time I'll try the Taco seasoning in the package.   These are not only delicious, they look really attractive. I am not someone who puts a lot into presentations and usually my meals don't look special. These looked really "pretty" and neat and something that would be good to serve to company :) I will make these often.  Next time, I plan on using smaller wraps and making a batch of mini enchiladas (I'm on a diet and a mini one would work).

This was a huge hit. I cut back on the spiciness to please my wimpy kids, but it was loaded with flavor. Shredding the chicken was a great idea and worth the trouble. I don't think a full cup of water was necessary to add to the chicken mixture, as it got a bit runny, but I'll make this again and often!

Wow! I made this last night and it was a huge success. Absolutely delicious! I kept to the recipe changing only a couple of minor things. I added fresh green chilies, and used chicken thighs. I left out the taco seasoning and spiced it up with increased amounts of cumin, chili powder, and a bit of salt. This meal is definitely a new family favorite! Thanks for a great recipe.

Sorry but I didn't find these enchiladas to be awesome.  The cream of chicken soup and sour cream mixture made the bottom of the dish very mushy so the texture was unappealing.

The dish was so salty due to the canned and processed items that I could not eat it. However, my family liked it so I decided to give another try. I substituted low sodium soup, low sodium taco mix ( and only used 1/2 the package) and subbed salsa for the enchilada sauce. Much better.

These are restaurant-quality enchiladas! My husband almost fell out of his seat when he tasted these. He raves about them and thinks these are THE best. I didn't deviate from the recipe. Look no further than this if you want enchiladas. Thanks Angela!

This recipes was a huge hit even with a 9 year old who has a very limited list of foods he will eat.  He actually asked me to give the recipe to his mom.   Made no changes.  The recipe is perfect as is and is so easy to prepare!

I made the proportion listed in the recipe knowing it would be more than we needed, but good thing I did because this went over so well, we ate it the next day too and it was just as good if not better then. Most def. a keeper!

Love this recipe!  Only change that I made was to wsubstitute broth from simmering the chicken in with the chicken/taco seasoning mixture instead of the water.  Also mixed about 1/3 cup sour cream into the echilada sauce before pouring over to bake.   We loved these!  Thanks for posting, Angela :)

These are so delicious!!!  Made the chicken in the crock pot the day before and then assembled the next day.  Added a little more cheese.  Used eight 8 inch corn tortillas so they wouldn't become soggy. Made two batches so we could have for another meal.  I highly recommend you give these a try!

YUM!!!  These were so delicious!!  I am not able to handle spice and these were perfection.  We left out the onion and didn't feel that it was necessary but for those of you who love onion I'm sure it'd be delish.  Enjoy!

This dish has good potential. I had made the dish around 2pm before I headed out to pick kids up from school. I would def not recommend that! The enchiladas turned out VERY soggy! The flavor was good and I will try these again, however, I will use low sodium Cream Of Chicken soup next time! I would also probably try using leftover baked chicken. I dont care for the way boiled chicken turnes out. Just my personal opinion.

Really delicious!!  Living in west Tx, we have some great Mexican food, but these may be our favorite enchilada's ever!!...only change was that I used green enchilada sauce and the cheese I put in the enchilada's was Queso Fresco(Mexican cheese)...I also used regular sized tortilla's and ended up with 12 enchilada's in my baking dish...they really are fantastic!!!...thanks for the recipe!!!

Our family LOVES this dish. We almost never have leftovers so I don't know how they would be as the next day's lunch although I'm guessing that, once cooked, they would freeze and reheat really well!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was, as the name implies...Awesome!   On days that I know I'll be working late, I just put the raw chicken, onion, chiles, taco seasoning, water and a few green onions into the crock pot in the morning and let it cook all day.  Then when I get home, I shred the chicken, add the rest of the spices,  prepare the soup mixture and mix it all together & make enchiladas. It makes for a really quick and delicious dinner!

Super yummy! I cooked my chicken in the slow cooker with all of the ingredients and accidently left out the sour cream and it was still fabulous! I use New Mexico Chile for more enchilada sauce as I've never been able to find a canned one that I like. Thanks Angela!

I made these as recommended but I bought a large can of enchilada sauce which came in very handy.  When I had filled the first tray of enchiladas, I was out of the soup mixture so I coated the bottom of the second tray with the enchilada sauce.  It was the perfect amount of sauce to cover the tops of both trays and the bottom of the second batch.  Even my daughter who doesn't like enchiladas LOVED these!  Major kudos!

Ok, so tonight was the second time I've made this recipe. I must have done something wrong the first time because they were good, but tonight all I can say is WOW!!! I followed the recipe to the T this time(thought I did the first time but must have left something out) and they were amazing!! The only thing I did different was I used 2 cans of hot red enchilada sauce.( I like more sauce on them and the recipe doesn't specify red or green) You have got to try these! They are a little time consuming, but trust me THEY ARE WORTH IT!!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Amazing recipe! Definitely restaurant quality. Only adjustments I made were do to my lack of ingredients in my pantry. Used extra garlic powder in place of onion powder, and used extra onions in place of green onions. Also omitted the olives. Fabulous!

These are so easy when made with the crock pot.  I put in frozen chicken with all the spices and just added a couple tablespoons of water.  Shredded it and added the chilies, lime, and soup mix. also added a couple tablespoons of salsa to the soup mixture.  I've made this for several crowds and everyone has raved.  If I just want to serve my family of four with one tray, I just half the recipe.  And we still have leftovers.

I made this for my husband because he likes enchiladas.  Normally I don't like enchiladas at all but this recipe has changed my mind!  It had a wonderful taste even with the healthier substitutions (whole wheat tortillas, low fat condensed cream of chicken soup, low fat sour cream etc.).  I didn't use any lime juice or green onions as I did not have those on hand.  I'm not such a fan of black olives in Mexican dishes so I used less than half of what the recipe called for to sprinkle on top.  Will definitely make again!

Edit: My DH and I went out to eat at a Mexican restaurant last night.  We both agreed that Angela's enchiladas are better!!

I loved these enchiladas, but the filling was too messy for me and my husband. Next time, I will omit the sour cream/chicken soup mix and just fill with the meat mixture. I will also only use a small portion of the enchilada sauce on the top of smaller tortillas. I felt the larger ones were a little much.

Surprisingly excellent! I didn't know which enchilada sauce to buy, so I chose one that had pure ingredients. I wasn't sure how it was all going to taste since I didn't know what to expect from the sauce. Wow! was it good. My wife had seconds...not a common occurrence. I followed the directions to the T and didn't change or add anything except to use about twice as much enchilada sauce (good thing it was good!). We'll be eating enchiladas for a few days.

Update...made it again. This time I cooked the chicken in a crock pot and it was a snap to shred.

I must say that these were appropriately named! My little family of 4 ate over HALF the PAN in just the first sitting!! My daughter is coming over with her boyfriend, and I doubt that there will be any left after THAT!  I was concerned about FLOUR tortillas instead of corn, but this is the first real batch of enchiladas I've ever made, and they were WONDERFUL!  NEXT time I make these, however, I'll allow the chicken/taco seasoning mixture to simmer while I heat up the soup/sour cream concoction.  DEFINITELY a keeper! Thanks, MomSavedbyGrace!! It's a winner in OUR home! :)

I followed the directions exactly, except I accidentally used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, and I used light sour cream.  These are the BEST enchiladas I've ever had, hands down.  They are probably the best thing I've ever made and I have to stop myself from devouring the entire pan.  GREAT JOB and fantastic recipe!  Thank you, I will make this as part of my regular dinner rotation!

I made this for my family last night and it got a 10+ in my home which is amazing.  I'm feeding a meat loving hubby, two teen girls and two younger elementary aged kids yet ALL of us loved it.  I used a small chicken that I had boiled to make soup stock for a sick friend and I just shredded that for the recipe.  I also used a large can (28 oz) of enchilada sauce since we like things saucy.  This tasted even better than the enchiladas at our favorite Mexican restaurant!  Thanks for another keeper All Recipes!

This recipe was awesome!  It's definitely replacing my old chicken enchilada recipe!  I really didn't change it up any.  I took another reviewer suggestion and cooked my chicken in the slow cooker with the spices & chiles.  It was easy to break up and then add the sour cream & soup.  I did replace the onions with onion powder out of personal preference.  For the enchilada sauce, I used our favorite: Mrs. Espy's Enchilada sauce, found here on AllRecipes.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

These were super good! I froze mine before cooking them so they could be made at a later date & they still turned out great. The only thing I changed was adding more cheese at the end before serving, but I love cheese:)

Born and raised in Texas, I have had more than a few AWESOME enchiladas in my life... And these "burrito sized" enchiladas are delish! Only four stars because I personally think olives have NO place in Mexican food. Whenever I make this recipe, I always have a little extra chicken mixture left. It makes a great addition to queso, or on top of a cup of black beans. Yum!

These were really really good.  I made a couple of changes.  Even without these changes I think this would still be a 5 star.  I used boneless/ skinless chicken thighs instead of breast because I bought a bunch that were on sale.  Also, being a Texan I believe that enchiladas should be made with corn tort. not flour. I used 8 regular size tort. instead of 5 big ones. I just heated a non-stick small skillet on med.high heat and placed one tort. on there for about 10 seconds on each side to soften so they would not tear while rolling.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I would for sure make these again as in two days my family ate them all.

I really liked this recipe. I left out the onion, chiles, green onion, and olives. I also had to use lemon juice instead of lime. I used smaller flour tortillas and ran out, so I made the last two with corn, and I think I'll make them all with corn tortillas next time because the flour ones got kind of gummy. The chicken held the flavor very well, and it was just the right texture. Very, very yummy, better than at restaurants!

These were pretty good. These are not authentic Mexican enchiladas, but my family raved about them!  I thought that there was way too much of the cream of chicken soup and sour cream mixture.  It over powered the awesome chicken mixture on the inside and the enchilada sauce on the outside.  So, next time, I will cut WAY back on that so that I can have more of the authentic flavors.

Love this recipe! I follow it to the letter! It has been a crowd favorite for years! The only thing I change is I shred the chicken in my Ninja (takes about 5 min to shred all the chicken). I also use way less cheese due to Lactose issues in my house. Other than that, this recipe is perfect as is!

The BEST! I use green enchilada sauce and if I have the time, I roast sliced peppers and onions in the oven and add them on top.  I could eat my weight in these enchiladas.  Angela is a great cook!

I didn't think the recipe was good at all. The cream of  chicken soup & sour cream mixture was gross & didn't go with the enchiladas at all. Was to creamy & had a bad flavor. I'll try traditional enchiladas next time. Would never make again!

I've made this so many times, and they are so so sooo good! I get requests all the time to make enchiladas hahaha. A few things, I use about 10(taco sized)tortillas, 5 isn't nearly enough and they would be way to big. I also use reduced fat cream of chicken soup, and the last time I made it I used greek gods nonfat plain yogurt in place of sour cream, and it worked beautifully. I also add a minced garlic clove or 2 to the sauteing onion, and skip the onion and garlic powder. This recipe is easy to adjust to whats on hand, I often forget green onion and olives, while they are missed its still delicious. I've made it without the cream of chicken and sour cream when having guests who couldn't eat those things and it was still very good. I usually use a 7oz can of chillies instead of the 4oz because I like them, and to serve I top with pickled jalapenos, sour cream(greek yogurt)and guacamole if I have any avocados. ALSO! I love making a batch of the chicken mixture, then separating it into freezer bags and then when I want a quick easy meal? Pull out a bag, trow it in some tortillas with cheese and enchilada sauce, enchiladas ready for the oven in under 5 minutes, can't beat that. The mix is also good on nachos!

This is a truly awesome recipe, and the changes I made are mostly about personal taste. First, use more smaller tortillas and place them the other direction in the pan. Secondly, I added a 14.5 oz. can each of drained kernel corn and black beans to the chicken mixture to add a little counterpoint to the heavy creaminess of the soup/sour cream. Lastly, I made green enchilada sauce because I haven't found a good canned one. 1/2 C diced onion and 3 pressed garlic cloves sautéed in 2 T oil. Add 3T flour, 1 1/2 C chicken broth, 2 4 0z. cans diced green chiles, 1 seeded and minced jalapeno, 1/4 t each of cumin and oregano, salt and pepper to taste. Simmer 1 hour.

I love this recipe.  An easy way to shred your chicken after it is cooked is to put it in your kitchen aid and let it do the work.  The result is finely shredded chicken.  Amazing!

Easiest way to shred the chicken is with a kichen aid mixer. Just use the paddle and go on low until you get the desired texture. Odd way to do it but it works great!

Delicious....I have never reviewed a recipe before but this is so good that I felt I had to review it.  I put the chicken and spices in my crock pot with 1/2 cup water.  After several hours I shredded the chicken.  It practically fell apart. Then added the soup, sour cream and lime juice.  Cooked for another 30 minutes on high.  I buttered a 9 X 13 baking dish and poured a bag of Frito corn chips in. Added a layer of frozen thawed corn and then a layer of drained black beans along with half the cheese.  I made the Red Enchilada sauce on this site.  After pouring in the chicken mixture I topped with cheese, a little more corn chips and the red enchilada sauce. The corn chips did not get soggy as I feared tortilla chips might.  Everyone loved it.

Wow this is an awesome recipe, it is now our favorite enchiladas! I did notice that the brand of enchilada sauce you use will somewhat depend on how spicy it is, a real mexican sauce will be spicier then a name brand. It is okay to assemble them a few hours ahead of time n stick them in the fridge.The recipe is VERY flexible, I used a rotisserie chicken, skipped a few spices i did not have,neither did i add the water or lime juice or olives or onions in any form as I do not care for them. Even so it was a wonderful dish with lots of flavor!! All in all it's a super duper recipe that i would suggest this to everyone!!

I have never had enchiladas before making this, but wow these were amazing. I couldn't find jarred enchilada sauce so I found a recipe on here to use, as well I used a corn/flour blended tortilla's as I'm not a fan of soggy. These were a hit with my company and I will be making them again soon. Unfortunately these did not reheat well for me, the tortillas kind of turned into a noodle texture? Oh, and due to time restraints I did take advice from other reviews and cooked the chicken with seasonings in the slow cooker.

I loved this recipe.  I doubled the batch for a huge group and it was a great success.  I did do the crock pot method just for time and it shredded very easily.  Thanks Angela!!

Absolutely fabulous enchiladas!  My husband absolutely loved these and they have so much flavor!  Rarely do I not have to change a recipe but this one is absolutely fabulous-the only thing I did differently was to use a rotisserie chicken.  Will definitely keep in my favorites to make again!

(7) STARS!! Great Recipe!! I was told last night at Dinner that this was the BEST dinner yet!  Family Loved it and ate it until it was GONE!  I did the chicken, spices and lime juice and a little bit of water in the slow cooker on high for 3-4 hrs.  shredded the chicken, then added cream of chicken soup and sour cream to the slow cooker to cook all together for about 20mins and did the rest of the recipe as written.

Very good. Only thing I did different was double the spices. I did use corn and flour tortillas. I recommend the corn. As for the soup mixture I only used a little on the bottom of the pan. So my enchiladas were not soupy.

I tried this recipe and followed it, using spicy taco seasoning and a medium hot enchilada sauce.  I didn't have time to put the chicken in the crock pot like others suggested, but I did boil the chicken in chicken broth with a little salt, mrs. dash, and a cube of chicken boullion.  I thought it was going to be a bit time consuming, but it's not that bad.  Everything turned out great and yummy.  This is definitely going in my recipe box.

No disappointment as these enchiladas are awesome. Made as written except for doubling the enchilada sauce and omitting the butter. Coated both sides of the flour tortillas with enchilada sauce before folding in the chicken mixture & cheese. Didn’t have extra time today, but want to smoke the chicken breasts next time rather than boil them. We will definitely make these again.

The fastest, easiest way to perfectly shred Chicken is with a Kitchen Aid Mixer with the paddle attachment!  Only thing I changed was to use cheddar cheese soup instead of the chicken:)

Pretty good enchilada recipe and really doesn't need a lot of tweaking, but for me, I've made as good, if not better with a lot less energy involved.   I'm not sure I was crazy about the chicken soup/sour cream mixture and probably would have preferred something with refried beans in its place.   I probably won't make this version again.

Omg I love it!! I'm still eating it, but I love it so much I'm coming back to rate! I took forever preparing all this (I'm not the most experienced cook) but it was totally worth it. I served it with spanish rice, refried beans, guacamole and sour cream on the side. The only thing I changed was that I couldn't decide between the green chile enchilada sauce or the mild red enchilada sauce, so I used both (a stripe of red down the middle and green along the sides, still using approximately 10oz total). Delicious!! Will definitely make again!

These were awesome!!!  Takes a little time, but overall very easy to make.  Well worth the time it takes to prep everything.  You can cut down a lot on fat and calories with this recipe by using light/fat free ingredients without compromising the taste.  My husband always complains when I try to make something "healthier" and he didn't even notice.  This is now one of his favorite dishes.  Also, if you like things spicy, definitely increase the chili powder A LOT.  We used an entire pack of Buena Vista chili powder.

This enchilada recipe is one of the best I've tried on this site. My husband loved them and so did I. Followed recipe exactly but did add some cumin and baked the chicken instead of boiling. Just a personal preference. Absolute delicious. They are phenominal and will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. Have made it exactly as written, with all lowfat ingredients, layered like a casserole, and used the filling for nachos.  All ways it was great.  Impressive.  I double the lime juice and cheese, and use corn tortillas, just personal preference.  Serve with brown rice with cilantro and lime.  Oh yeah, one time I added a small jar of black bean and corn salsa to the chicken mixture and that was delish too. Dependable, flavorful and beautiful presentation. Yummo!

Awesome is an understatement! Made these for Dad to come over for dinner and they were a HIT! I wasn't sure what taco seasoning to use so I used chicken taco, added it to the shredded chicken and green chili the night before to make dinner fast and easy.... I have been craving them since we made them...I replaced all water with chicken broth and used diced onion instead of doing it by hand to save time. We won't make another enchilada for a long time other than this one!

Ok, so I made a couple of changes, mostly in punching up the flavor and saving time. I shredded up a rotisserie chicken, used white corn tortillas because I had some on hand, used low fat sour cream and soup, taco seasoned shredded cheese, and I threw in a can of black beans with jalapenos. It's in the oven now...

*After Tasting*  YUMMMMMM! It's 5 stars for me, maybe 4 if I had made it as written. Either way, a recipe worth trying!

I have never reviewed a recipe on this site, however, these were BY FAR the BEST enchilida's I have ever tried!!!!! I cooked the chicken in the crockpot with the taco seasoning, chili powder, garlic, onion, & onion powder with a little water...it was super easy to shred and put together.  After I shredded the cooked chicken, I added the shredded chicken, diced chilis (but didn't drain), and lime juice to a pan to keep it hot before I assembled the enchiladas.  I also still added the chili powder to the sour cream/chicken soup mix.  I cannot say enough good things about this recipe...they were absolutely FAB!!!

Delicious!!! Very filling and heavy, but enchiladas usually are. I followed the recipe exactly, but next time will try the crock pot for the chicken. The chicken was difficult to shred, but I think in the crock pot it would be much softer.

This is by far the best enchilada recipe I've tried so far. I sear the chicken and then toss it in the crock pot with the seasonings which makes for perfectly tender meat and an easy to put together meal at the end of a busy day. The recipe is perfect! I've only changed how it is prepared.

Shredding the chicken doesn't have to be hard.  If you have a kitchenaid (or similar) mixer, use the paddle attachment and shred the chicken in minutes.  I have shredded beef, pork and chicken this way.  It works best when it is hot but works cold too.  Also this recipe is fantastic.  I used the packaged mexican shredded cheese with mine.  Next time i'm going to try corn tortillas since my husband prefers those.

Made these last night with leftover rotisserie chicken...seemed a waste to not use it and save the poaching time.  I also used 5-inch corn tortillas (in Texas it is a burrito if wrapped in flour tortillas) and skipped the black olives.  I also used a dry enchilada sauce mix instead of the canned because I already had it.  My husband is a plain food guy, raised on the farm, who usually doesn't like anything other than straight up chicken (fried, baked, or roasted) and thinks enchiladas must have ground beef in them....until he tasted these.  I was resigned to having to eat all 16 enchiladas myself for the rest of the week (and then some) but he ate three helpings...and we even have rice and refried beans, not to mention chips and salsa to go along with them.  I will definitely make these again...but may try layering like a casserole next time.  This will be a great potluck or family reunion dish.

This is the BEST enchilada recipe. Looks like a lot of work, but, it isn't.  Picky hubby & I make this over & over & over again.  Very filling.  I used 6 inch flour tortillas. Freezes well.

I've never found a recipe online that is so delicious! It's a little slow to put together, but the end result is an amazing dinner with a ton of flavor.  I love spicy food, but husband doesn't so I feel like I sacrifice flavor a lot.  This recipe gives so much flavor without spice.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous.  I've given it to friends and family and they all love it as well!!

Believe the hype, these are awesome.  I made a 4 serving half batch...but, used 4 tortillas with approximately 1/2 cup filling in each.  I baked it in an 8x8" dish.  Was more than enough for 2 people.  I also used hot/spicy taco seasoning and it added more flavor and was not too spicy.

OMG, OMG, OMG!!!!! These were every bit as AWESOME as their title implies! It is rare that I award 5 stars, but I just couldn't resist this time.... These are worth 500 stars, IMHO. :) Not only were these easy to throw together, they were absolutely delicious to boot. I've tried many enchilada recipes calling for cream soup and was never impressed with them. I couldn't even tell these were made with condensed soup! Other than speeding prep by subbing a rotisserie chicken (breast meat only), omitting the olives (my hubs and I don't like them), making only 4 enchiladas (all that would fit in my baking dish) and using 8 in. flour tortillas instead of the suggested 12 in. ones (personal preference), I made no changes. Served with Mexican rice, fiesta corn, chips, guacamole and margaritas. Thanks SO much for sharing your secret recipe, Angela. These were absolutely the BOMB! :-)

Delicious! I made these for dinner tonight with my Mexican rice and they were great! I changed the recipe because I am a vegetarian. I used carrots and corn in place of the meat, subbed the cream of chicken for cream of mushroom. It was a great dish and I cant wait to make it again!

These were awesome! I did use both cream of chicken and cream of mushroom to give it a little twist (about half and half). Also, I like spicy so I added some cayenne pepper and extra chili powder. Fantastic!!

Amazing. The only thing I did different was an add an extra jar of chopped green chilies since we love them a lot. It is better than any other recipe of enchiladas I've tried and I've tried a lot. I cooked it early in the day and just put the recipie in the fridge until I was ready to bake it for dinner. It really makes a difference to cook the chicken in all the ingredients. It was so flavorful. Thanks so much for sharing!!

We LOVED these enchiladas!! Best ever! I double the recipe for my large family. I used 1 can of cream pf chicken and one can of cream of mushroom, and used a can of Rotel instead of the green chilies. I had enough cream sauce leftover to make a small casserole dish of chicken enchiladas topped with the cream sauce. Another big enchilada dish topped with enchilada sauce. Both were Delish!:)

The point of a recipe is to follow it; so I did, to the letter.
Suffice to say, best enchilladas EVER. These easily surpassed our local Mexican restaurant's enchilladas. I don't rave about food often but these are a solid 9 out of 10.

These were DELICIOUS! I tried these and, as one poster recommended, put these ingredients in a crockpot with the chicken around noon and left it until about 5:30. The sauce itself was so delicious that I ate a bowl of it as soup while the chicken was still cooking! I didn't have any cumin :( 

Also, I added salsa con queso to the mixture in the last 30 minutes and it was divine! The shredded Mexican blend on top wasn't even needed! I wish I would've let the chicken simmer a bit longer, or even marinate overnight to better seal the flavor into it, but this was a GREAT recipe!

Made it for my boyfriend last weekend and he LOVED them.  I used boneless, skinless, chicken thighs because they are cheaper and still came out great and tender.  I also added some cayenne pepper to the filling (a little in the soup mix and chicken-filling) and my boyfriend appreciated the little "kick".  Overall, GREAT recipe!

Wow!  This was fabulous, so full of flavor without being spicy-hot! In fact, this is the first recipe that I haven't had to tweak*.  Even my wife, who has never liked chicken enchiladas, says this is a five star recipe. Thanks for sharing!!!  (Update - Just thought of something that I did tweak:  I always use a rotisserie chicken from Costco for any recipe calling for chicken.  It is cheaper than chicken breasts,  makes the recipe even easier, and tastes great!)

Great! I didn't change a thing.  Used left over beer can chicken from the night before, still had plenty of meat and was MUCH faster!

Long on prep time, but soooooooo worth it. These are amazingly good - the flavors in the shredded chicken alone are incredible. Once I mix the sour-cream sauce into the chicken, it's a fight to keep my fiance away from the pan. And leftovers are a treat - these reheat like a dream. This has become a special occasion (birthday dinners!) staple at our house. Thank you SO MUCH for sharing!

These are the best enchiladas in the world!  I've made them several times just as the recipe says.  However, this time I made 2 slight changes.  I feel cooking and shredding the chicken is typically the most time consuming part, so instead I put 2 chicken breasts in the crock pot before I left for work this morning.  I covered them with water and added 2 tsp of chicken bouillon, and voila, the easiest to shred chicken when I got home from work to make dinner.  The second change I made was using 8" tortillas instead of 12".  I'm not quite sure how you are supposed to fit 5 12" filled tortillas in a 9x13 dish, but by using 5 8" tortillas I was able to use all the filling and fit them all in the 9x13 dish.  Hope these little tricks helps a few others!  It is definitely time consuming, but so worth it!

This recipe was great and fun to make. I didn't have any peppers or green onion on hand so i incorporated fresh cilantro instead and it still had a wonderful flavor, i will remain using cilantro in this recipe. I also didn't have a can of enchilada sauce so i made it from scratch, i used the "ten minute enchilada sauce" recipe on this website. Overall the whole dish was fantastic, thanks!

Absolutely delicious!   This easily filled six 12" tortillas.  I skipped the green onion because I didn't have any on hand, and skipped the olives because I don't care for them.  Used a Mexican cheese blend in place of the cheddar.  Wonderful recipe, thank you!

I've made these several times and they're so delicious.  I use 3 chicken breasts and have enough to make 8 with some filling left over.  I've used green enchilada sauce as well as the red and they're both very good.  They're quite filling so you don't need a lot to go with them.  Definitely serve with sour cream and if you like spicy, some sliced jalapenos on top.  Thanks Angela!  Great recipe!

After reading a lot of reviews, I didn't think enchiladas could be that good...but they are!  I used left over baked chicken, so my prep time was cut drastically.

Oddly enough, it was a little spicy for my liking. Next time (tonight) I think I'll go a little easy on the chili powder.

very good!!!!  I thought I had green chils's (I always have those!!!) but I didn't.  So I made do with a similar sized can of chile verde and I have to say it was a FANTASTIC substitution.  Other than that, followed it to a T.  Highly recommended.  Oh, I used corn tortillas too... personal preference there.

These were really tasty.  I went a little too heavy on the cheese.  What I really liked was the sour cream/cream of chicken/chili powder sauce mixed in with the chicken and then also put in the base of the pan.  I will make again!

Instead of using garlic/onion powder I added cumin to the soup mixture with the chili.  I also doubled the enchilada sauce.  My entire family LOVED these.  These will be in the rotation for a very long time.  Wonderful and easy!!!!! They look like you worked all day ;)

Similar to a recipe I've used from old Southern Living cookbook. Traditionally made with leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Instead of green onions I use chopped spinach or kale - adds the color and nutrition.

This recipe is AWESOME! Everyone ate it up the minute it came out of the oven & begged for seconds... I had to make a second batch for leftovers! Only thing i did different was substitute lemon juice for lime since i had no lime & we are cheese lovers, so i put a bit of jack cheese in with the cheddar. This is one I'm asked to make all the time... We love it!!

So this recipe is phenomenal. However, I almost never go out of my way to have all of these ingredients on hand at one time, so I will share the changes I've used, which are still delicious (but I have done the original recipe, which is the one that claims phenomenalability).

Use cheese soup instead of cream of chicken soup, mix with the sour cream and chili powder. I used jalepenos instead of green chilies, left out the green onion and onion powder, and black olives. Once I cooked up the shredded chicken mixture, I added about half of the cheese soup mixture and mixed it with the chicken, as well as coating the pan, and once I had made up the enchiladas in the pan, I coated the top of the enchiladas with it too. (I looove that cheese soup mixture!) Salt and pepper it a little bit, perfecto.

After many times making these, I put my own spin on this recipe. I use boneless, skinless thighs cooked and shredded in the crockpot. To the soup mixture, I add a LOT more chili powder, as well as garlic/onion powders, cumin, and even some enchilada sauce as well for additional flavor. I sautee my onion in a little butter, then add garlic, more chili powder and then the green chilies. I then add that to the chicken, and mix it well with the cup of the soup mixture. I don't measure out the cheese for the filling or the top, but just add until it looks like enough....too much cheese isn't a problem! I love this recipe overall, but just tweak slightly to make it easier on the preparation.

These were awesome.  I took a risk and made them for a get together with our friends and their kids and even the picky kids (and one picky dad) scarfed them up!  I served with guacamole, s. cream, shredded lettuce and diced tomato.  They even said they were better than the authentic Mexican restaurant they frequent.  I would definitely give this more than 5 if I could.

I brought these to a potluck dinner on the block and they were a hit.  Personally I'd like a little more tomato flavor so may add some salsa or tomato paste next time.  I also used fat free sour cream, reduced fat soup and less cheese they were still extremely rich!

These are so good! I follow the recipe exactly as written. My DH who doesnt care for enchiladas thinks these are incredible and my two teenagers cant get enough of them. They are in our monthly meal rotation. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum. I was very nervous about the cream of chicken, sour cream and taco seasoning. But i went for it anyways. It was really good. Very creamy, not spicy though which was fine with me. Very good! Don’t let the cream of chicken turn you off here.

Wonderful recipe! I used it in a different way, but the ingredients were basically the same...except that I used 1/2 C plain nonfat yogurt in place of sour cream, and 1/2 the cheese. I mixed everything together with homemade enchilada sauce and placed the mixture on top of tater tots...no tortillas. My kids loved it!

My first time making enchiladas and per my husband, this one's a keeper.  next time I'll try corn tortilla shells...flour shell does get a little mushy as other reviews advise.

I often roast a whole chicken in the slow cooker for dinner and make these enchiladas with the leftover chicken meat. Just throw the leftover meat in the slow cooker with a can of tomato sauce, a container of salsa and some chicken stock. Season to taste (I use cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and a little salt). Cook on low 2-4 hours and then assemble enchiladas. Thanks for the great recipe!!

So I think this is a great recipe.  I have made this a couple of times, the first time I followed the recipe to a T.  I really liked it and so did my family, but...I felt it was a little bit too salty for my taste and I like salt.  I'm not one of those finicky salt phobia types.  Anyways it has been awhile since I have made this but I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I would suggest and to save time make this when you have left over chicken.  We had a left over roast chicken, so I was able to skip the boiling part and just shred right away.  I also left out the green onions in step 2, mainly because we already heat up the chicken with a small diced onion already but I did put the green onion on top of the enchiladas before I put it in the oven.  Also I did not use all of the taco seasoning and in stead of filling each individual enchilada with cheese I just added cheese to the filling mixture and let it melt.  Its not major but some of these steps saved on some time and it turned out delicious.

My husband RARELY gives a 5 rating but did for this recipe!  Technically, these are burritos because of the flour (not corn) tortillas but since burritos are my fave anyway, doesn't matter to me!  I didn't have the green chilies, the garlic or onion powder so I had to leave those things out but it was still great.  My 5 yr old wasn't keen on it but my husband and I loved it.  My husband thought it wasn't spicy enough but it was plenty for me without those chilies.  It's hard pleasing everyone when it comes to anything spicy.  Will make again!

This truely is the best Enchilada recipe I have ever come across. The blend of chili's and the creamyness of the sauce really make this dish special. My husband insisted that I make these at least once a month.

cook chicken breast (frozen is fine) in crock pot with taco seasoning, garlic, onion powder, chili powder, chopped onion & water all day. Chicken is easily shredded at end of day and remaining ingredients can be assembled and baked easily

We found these to be just right using a good quality enchilada sauce. I like the lime flavor and will probably add some grated lime rind next time. We will definitely have this again. My husband said it was the best enchiladas ever!

DELICIOUS! These are the best enchiladas ever! Definitely restaurant quality. And it makes so much! I have had to use a a large and small baking pan every time I have made these to fit them all! I would leave the chicken in large pieces to boil because it definitely makes it easier to shred.  But most importantly I don't know how only 10oz of enchilada sauce is enough for anyone! I used almost an entire 28oz can.  So I would definitely recommend buying more of it just incase you also find that its not enough to cover all the enchiladas.

These enchiladas were good but a little bland.  They just tasted like sour cream and cheese to me.  My enchiladas may have been a little bland due to the mild enchilada sauce that I used.  I would try medium enchilada sauce if I ever made this again. I would also smother them with picante sauce and guacamole.  Good recipe but not the best enchiladas that I ever had.

I decided to try this recipe because of the high ratings but these were just ok.  The chicken enchiladas I make taste much better, are less expensive and less time consuming to make.  Will not make again.

AMAZING!  There is nothing more to say about this recipe.  There is nothing better than making something that makes a beautiful dinner and then everyone is fighting for the leftovers.  Follow this recipe to a T!  Its Perfect!  Love Love Loved it!  Do yourself and your family a favor tonight!  MAKE THIS!  ONLY TIP.... do not cook the chicken etc.... buy an already roasted on and take the skin off.  Cuts a huge amount of time out and tasted YUMMY!  Salsa and Sour Cream on the side!  Let me know what you thought!

WOW!  This was the best enchilada recipe I have made.  There is only 2 of us in our household, so we had enough left over to freeze for another nights last minute meal...something to look forward to.  This is definitely going to be our main recipe for enchiladas.  Next time I will try to lighten it up a bit.  But these were truly awesome.  Thanks MomSavedbyGrace.

This is an excellent recipe! I didn't shred the chicken, I cut and fried it in little pieces. Otherwise followed exactly how the recipe is and it turned out excellent!!!

I have made this a few times and it is super yummy! I always add more cheese inside and have added black olives, corn and black beans to the chicken.

My husband specifically requested I give these 5 stars.  He loved them.  He ate them for dinner, then lunch, then dinner again!  I had to adapt to what I had and I had to make them a bit less calories.  I used some frozen leftover cooked chicken, healthy request CoC soup, Light Sour cream, no butter at all, just some Pam spray,reduced sodium taco mix and probably 2 - 2.5 cups of cheese. Double lime.  Kids (3 & 5) thought they were too spicy  I also got 6 out of this recipe.  I left out the green onions, but only b/c I didn't have them.  Next time they will go in since this made the rotation.

This was the first time I made enchiladas with chicken...I've always used beef.  I can tell you that after my family ate these chicken enchiladas...they will NEVER go back to the beef!  Everyone loved it!  I recommend using a rotisery chicken from the store and just cutting that up...saves time :-)

These enchiladas really were awesome.  I added 2 cloves chopped garlic, 2 chopped jalapenos, and 1 chopped pablano to the onion.  Also added a few tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro to the chicken mixture but other then that I followed this recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  Will absolutely make again.

Great recipe!   If you have time to let your chicken boil for a few hours it will fall apart under the pressure of a fork.   You can boil it gently or throw it in a crockpot if you are gone all day.. either way it makes the chicken super tender and tasty :)

My husband and I loved this.  Did as many suggested, cut back on the water.  I also bought a rotisserie chicken instead of boiling chicken breasts.  The flavor from the rotisserie chicken was fabulous.

EVERYONE LOVES IT!  Made it several times. Only problem is the blend and mix steps, I can't seem to put it together exactly like Angela however it hasn't made a difference to the taste.   Totally recommend it.

Awesome Enchiladas is right!!!  My kids, who never like to try new things, loved them.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were awesome!  I was so proud that I took pictures and posted on FB.  The best enchiladas, hands down!  I can never eat enchiladas in a restaurant again.  Great recipe, Angela.

Really good recipe.  Next time I'll cut back on the salt some how.  Maybe I'll use reduced sodium soup.  It was on the salty side.  I didn't have sour cream, so I didn't add that part or substitute anything.  I used ground turkey instead since that's what I had.  I'll definitely make these again!

I made these yesterday. I was really questioning how they were going to turn out. They are delicious. A bit time consuming, but very good. I just left off the black olives because I don't care for them, other wise followed the recipe to a "T". Next time however, I might use Rotissere Chicken from the deli to save a little time.  Thanks for the recipe and lunch.

These were very good and the only enchiladas that my husband has ever liked.  I think that they are a lot of work for the final result a few steps could probably be eliminated.

One of the best recipes I've found on this site! I don't eat green chilies, so I substitute mushrooms. Usually I put all the ingredients in the crock pot in the morning so they have all day to simmer, but it's great on the stove as well. Other than that, this dish is absolutely wonderful!

GREAT RECIPE! FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXACTLY. HOWEVER, DID USE LOW SODIUM TACO SEASONING AND LOW FAT SOUP AND SOUR CREAM STILL TURNED OUT GREAT. DEFINITELY A KEEPER MAKING AGAIN THIS WEEKEND!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet!  I have made this multiple times in the last year or so and my husband is IN LOVE!  We are not olive fans, so we just leave them out and do everything else as written.  I will say a good time saving tip is to grab a rotisserie chicken and shred that and throw it in...but regular chicken works, too!  We just love bringing this to work for lunch the next day!

We loved this recipe. Great flavor a recipe that you might find in a restaurant. The only thing I changed was I used a can of Rotel tomatoes and chilies instead of just chilies. I also used chicken taco seasoning. Awesome I will make it again.

These enchiladas are the BEST!!  Made them exactly according to the recipe and they turned out great.  Husband said "these are restaurant quality" and went back for seconds!  A little work to prepare, but well worth it.  This recipe's a keeper!

To save some time throw the chicken breasts in the slow cooker with just enough water to cover them, add some garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper, and let them cook on the lowest setting all day. They stay super juicy and shred easily. They are delicious as is, but a little on the mild side. If you like it a little spicier use medium taco seasoning, hot enchilada sauce, and add some fresh diced jalapenos in the soup mixture as well as on top.

These were pretty good, but time consuming.  I used a multi-grain sandwich wrap which was overwhelming in this dish...if I make again, I will definitely use regular tortillas.  Otherwise I made it to spec.  The hubby liked it and it fed us for 3 dinners which was nice!

This truly deserves 5 stars. My husband commented on how good dinner was and he never does that. Only thing I did different is that I bought a rotissarie chicken from the store and shredded that. It was amazing!

Absoultely delicious! A little time-consuming, but so worth the wait. The filling was so good. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but omitted the olives (per preference) This by far exceeds any echilada recipe I've ever tasted. Like other reviewers, I agree that using a good authentic quality enchilada sauce is the way to go, otherwise a cheap canned variety sort of trumps all the wonderful flavors going on in the filling. This will be printed and put in my recipe book! =)

This is a great enchilada recipie!! My whole family loved it. Tonight I am trying it with corn torillas (it is great with the flour tortillas and the recipie needs nothing altered). Perfect combination of spicy and creaminess. The flavor just dances in your mouth and leaves you full and content.

My entire family devoured this dish with much praise to the recipe & cook.  I followed the recipe to the T with the exception of making my own taco seasoning and allowing the chicken to boil longer.  So good I have put it in my regular rotation.  Thank you!

Just as delicious as everyone says it is!  I think it's easier to boil the chicken and then shredded it!

Super good, but kind of a lot of work. I thought they were worth the effort, but my husband made them and thought they were time intensive.

Ya....no one could put their fork down!  Excellent recipe.  I doubled it and made an extra one for my neighbors.  2 hours later my neighbors brought the dish back and it was completely cleaned.  Very, Very good recipe!

my extraordinarily picky friend said YUM from the first bite to the last.   My only disappointment was the absence of tomatoes...compared to Gerrys enchilda recipe.  I have made the same friend both recipes and Angela's is the winner.  Another reviewers slow cooker idea to shred the chicken worked great.

Very tasty! Did cook my chicken in the crockpot w/ some onions, abodo, and the green chiles in chicken stock, shredded like a dream. I also addded some cilantro because we love it. I must admit I am too lazy to roll enchiladas, so I did mine sort of chilequiles-style by cutting the tortillas into strips and toasing them for a couple minutes in the oven. I then layered everything  like a mexican lasagna instead of rolling.  Everyone was happy!!

So Delicious!! I made some alterations since i don't really eat meat. Veggie crumbles, red and green bell pepper sliced, diced jalapenos, condensed cream of celery soup. I love the creaminess of it! I even add extra cheese in the enchiladas. YUM!

I love this recipe and so does everyone that try's it! I do make a couple of changes.... instead of the green chilies, I use a can of rotel, I use two packets of taco seasoning, add a little chili pepper, and boil the chicken in chicken broth rather then just water. Awesome Awesome!! Thank you so much for the recipe!

I have never eaten nor made enchiladas before, but I must say these were absolutely perfect! My mexican food loving boyfriend raved over them.  The only thing I changed was to use corn tortillas instead of flour because they have a better flavor.  Other than that I followed the recipe as is.  5 perfect stars!

It was good but not the best I have ever had. My husband complained that the enchiladas were not authentic enough. We both liked it much better the second day. I also felt there was an awful lot of work involved for something that did not turn out spectacular.

Restaurant quality. Thank you for sharing. I used corn tortillas in my recipe.   Corn tortillas will break if you try to roll them.  In order for this not to happen you need to fry them in oil first.  It takes a long time but worth the effort.

Good, to simplify...Just shred a small roasted chicken. To the condensed/sour cream mixture add the whole pack of taco seasoning simmer then add the chicken. Spread remining into pyrex, fill tortillas with the seasoned chicken, cheese and roll, just like the recipe says. Easier and as yummy.

I WISH that I could give this recipe more than 5 stars. I'd give it 10 if I could! There are so few recipes on here that are worthy of this kind of response. This is better (BETTER!) than ANY enchilada I've had in a restaurant. Enough of the raving, though- I halved the chili powder (my family doesn't like heat), and I skipped the olives. It took some time to prepare, but it was worth it. I made this along with the Mexican Rice II recipe from this site, and some refried beans. Utopia would have been a margarita in hand, but this alone was  near perfect. THANK YOU for sharing this... It will me used many, many more times, I'm sure.

GREAT Recipe!!! I only gave 4 stars because I took a short-cut.  My husband was hungry.  Big smile!  I used chopped rotisserie chicken (approx. 1 lb) so I halfed all the ingredients. I did not have flour tortillas nor did I have black olives so I used corn and omitted the olives.  Flavor was great and we both enjoyed this meal.  thank you!

Very good.  I skipped the lime juice and gr. chilies b/c I did not have them.  I added a can of black beans and corn.  I loved it, but it is rich.  My hubby did not like it but he dislikes any food w/ creamy sauce.

FANTASTIC!!! My 4 year old daughter is a very picky eater and not once did I have to tell her to eat! I shredded leftover fried chicken (chicken fried chicken from all recipes) and used an enchilada sauce recipe from this site and it was wonderful I will make extra fried chicken every time now with the express purpose on making this the next day! The chicken filling is amazing! Very flavorful.

I love this recipe.  I will say though - only make this if you are committed to spending some time on supper.  It definitely is time consuming.  Not a quick supper to "whip up."  I made up the chicken and sauce the night before - then let it cook in the slow cooker while at work the next day and then I put it all together and baked when I got home.  Awesome taste - but I won't make it too often because it is definitely not healthy -- one of the worst I have ever made as far as that goes.  But sometimes you just gotta indulge.

This is a winner.  My teen and husband said these were the best chicken enchiladas they have ever had.    I used light sour cream, mild enchilada sauce and a little less sharp cheddar cheese and they were yummy - full of flavor, just slightly spicy not being too hot for our tastes.

This was very time-consuming but fabulous! I followed it exactly except used ground beef instead of chicken. (easier, plus I prefer the taste of beef) The leftovers were even better!

These were very good but way too salty for our tastes. I suggest using a low sodium cream of chicken soup and a low sodium taco mix to cut down on the salt a bit.

I used onion powder instead of onions and skipped the olives, I don't like sour cream but loved this!

This is absolutely the most amazing dish I have ever cooked from scratch. Angela, I am nearly speechless...5 stars isn't nearly enough for a recipe this delectable. I didn't change and thing and won't the next time I make this, either- and there will be plenty of next times. Thanks SO much for sharing!

Delish!  I put everything for the chicken mixture in the slowcooker for ease and it was both perfect AND easy to tear apart the chicken.

Thank you for this recipe! My whole family loves it. I add a can of black beans in with the chicken when simmering. I also use the juice of one whole lime and minced garlic cloves instead of powder. I use regular taco seasoning since my family likes food on the spicy side but it doesn't really change the taste.

WOW!!!!!! These are the best, most moist, creamy and delicious enchiladas I have ever made! My Hubby is used to his mom's traditional enchiladas, but told me that he may have a new favorite now! My only change was I had to use a rotiserie chicken (time issues) and I used SPICY enchilada sauce. But WOW!!!!! So good! With some Mexican rice and refried beans, it was the PERFECT meal!

These were just great. Now I have my own special recipe that after 15 years never changed. I thought I would try something new for fun. Fun it was! Absolutely will do it again. One thing I did, also to add to being different was instead of rolling them into a enchilada I layered the tortillas flat. Used 8 in all. Spread the sauce as directed on the bottom, laid out the torts, spread the filling over them, topped with the cheese, then more flat tortillas, and then the sauce and more cheese. Wonderful stuff.

I did what others suggested, add the seasoning in with the chicken crockpot, then fill tortillas and add sauce.  SO good!  I loved the green enchilada sauce much more than the red, as did my kids.

I made this recipe using exactly the same ingredients, but followed another reviewer's suggestion to put it in the crock pot first.  It was really good, and all of my family loved it.  We actually discussed the texture of the chicken shredded vs. cut into chunks, and the consensus was that most of them preferred it shredded.  On that note, I have always shredded my chicken in my stand mixer (I have a KitchenAid).  Just throw the BOILED chicken in the bowl, and use the standard metal paddle to tear it up.  I timed it last night, and shredding the chicken took about 1 minute.  Easy peasy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Angela! Your enchilada's ARE awesome! This was exactly what we had in mind when we decided that enchiladas sounded good for dinner. The only addition we made was a can of diced jalapenos in with the diced green chilies. My household loves spicy so this worked out great for us and I'd do it again. I've tried other enchilada recipes and my house has enjoyed them but we couldn't help wanting more but THIS recipe was perfect for us! Thank you!

Wow, these were great.  I doubled the recipe and froze one dish.  I used the Ten Minute Enchillada Sauce recipe on this site.  I did think the enchilladas were a bit of work but worth it.  Served with a green salad with Mexican flair (romaine, cilantro, crumbled queso seco, kidney beans, olives, corn, tomatoes, crumbled tortilla chips and vinaigrette).  Made a great meal.  If you are short on time I would cook and shread the chicken ahead of time.

Great recipe! I took another reviewer's advice and used the slow cooker.  I put 4 boneless breasts in there, along with the onion, taco seasoning, garlic & onion powders, chili powder, and about 1/3 c water.  I left it on low all day and then shredded it right in the pot.  I added the green chilis and soup mixture about 15 minutes before assembly and let it sit on high until ready.  I thought the amount of olives and green onions was a bit much so I used about half.

These were awesome!  My husband and I both loved them.  We used light ingredients where possible to keep the fat/calorie levels in check (98% fat free soup/lower calorie tortillas/skim milk cheese/light sour cream) and I did bake the chicken instead of boiling it but otherwise made the recipe exactly as called for.  We used Old El Paso Hot Enchilada sauce and it really gave it a nice kick.  This recipe is perfect and we will make it many more times!

I made this with beer margaritas, and it was a hit. The whole thing was gobbled up promptly and my in-laws asked for the recipe. Might buy a pre-cooked chicken next time to save time and add some dark meat, but will definitely be making this again.

i made this for a second time tonight and it was amazing!! it does take a long time to make, but it was completely worth it. 
i didnt put green chilies in it, or the olives...because i dont like them! and i used two cans of enchilada sauce because last time i made it i didnt feel like it had enough sauce. but other than that i followed it exactly. 
delicious!!

These were awesome! The only problem I had was not letting the liquid reduce enough before adding the soup/sourcream mixture. My tortillas ended up a little soggy, but that was my fault.

I had a few alterations. I only had 2 chicken breasts, so just used them. My chicken soup can was bigger than the recipe called for at 14oz. I used the whole can. I didn't have any green onions or lime juice so left them out. I used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. That was 11 corn tortillas (would have been 12 but the first one fell apart when i tried to fold it- definitely warm corn tortillas in the microwave with a damp paper towel over them for a minute before trying to fill/fold them) which filled up the big pan the recipe called for & a smaller square pan. I didn't measure the cheese, but just threw a bunch in and on top. My enchilada sauce can was WAY bigger (29.2 oz) but I used the whole can anyway. The results were good. The enchiladas were reportedly delicious (I'm vegetarian, so I can't personally vouch). They were mild though. If it were me, I would definitely add some spice (jalapenos maybe, or at the very least I would get the spicy taco mix and the spicy green chiles). Since the recipe yielded so many, my partner ate this for dinner the first night, then warmed it up the next night (still good). The next night we heated it up again & had friends come over to help eat it, & it still got rave reviews. Finally, the next night, my partner ate it again, & said it was still super delicious. It would probably be easier to shred the chicken if you left the breasts whole rather than cutting them up. Thanks!

I made this dish for dinner tonight for my husband, 16 year old son and 14 year old daughter, who are all very pick eaters and, they loved it!  It does take time to make but trust me, it's worth it. My daughter kept saying, "Mom, how come this is so good!" and my son said after he inhaled his second helping, "Good dinner Mom!" In addition, we had a side dish of Uncle Ben's Spanish Rice and I also shredded a quarter head of iceberg lettuce to top off the enchiladas. I wouldn't change a thing except if you are counting calories, I would suggest using low fat sour cream.  I will be making this dish again for my family and for company! Thanks so much for sharing.

Worked well for the family.  Made as listed but used corn tortillas instead.

Totally worth the preparation!!  I had a "fiesta night" at my house with family and friends and everyone LOVED THESE!  The only change I made was 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder rather than 1/4 teaspoon.  VERY AWESOME recipe Angela...thanks!

This was pretty good!  Took some time to make (there must be an easier way to shred chicken!), but my husband really liked it.  I left out the green chilies and the olives.  Next time I'll use a name brand enchilada sauce instead of generic!  ;)

Fantastic. This is one of the first recipes I have tried on allrecipes, and it absolutely set the bar high. Made these for my GF and she was real happy with me. I would have let more people try them out, but we ended up eating all the leftovers!

I made this recipe last night and it was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I didn't have was green onions, but it did not make a difference because it was delicious. A little time consuming for a weekday night, but definitely worth it. My husband is a very picky eater and when he asked me to make it again soon, I knew I'd better save it! Thanks!!

I used this recipe last night to use the chicken meat pulled from making homemade chicken stock.  The boiled chicken from the stock was perfect for shredding!  The bones went back into the stock and the enchiladas were declared a yummy do-over by my husband!  Since we just moved to Europe from Texas, I did not have onion powder but it was great!  Warm memories of TexMex returned and next time my husband is going to add jalapenos, but we thought the flavor was perfect for a mixed crowd.

This recipe was amazing!!!  I cooked it for dinner guests last night, and there was only 1/2 of an enchilada left!  The flavors were amazing, and it was really easy to assemble.  I did not have enchilada sauce, but I found a really great recipe on this website, and made it.  I will DEFINITELY be making these again!!!!

I made this to bring over to a neighbor's house.  It was a total hit.  It is true, the chicken shredding was hard, I won't lie.  And even as I was shredding away, I was swearing under my breath "these better be good."  And they were, absolutely amazing.

These were great! I think next time I'll use a little less sour cream though. I'm not a big fan of sour cream and I'm pretty sure I could taste it in the sauce. It didn't matter much though because they were quite possibly the best enchilada's I've had in years.

Pretty dang tasty!I've never made enchiladas before. I followed the recipe with a few exceptions that didn't affect the outcome adversely. I used the AR recipe for Creamed style Soup mix in place of the condensed soup. I also omitted the green onions and chopped green chilis. The taco seasoning packet was labeled "hot" and my daughter had to be able to eat dinner, too. So had to leave out those chilis. I also had no canned enchilada sauce. I used an AR recipe for Red Enchilada Sauce. I served this with Spanish rice. It seemed like a lot of work but dinner was delicious! Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I wanted to do something different with Thanksgiving turkey leftovers and decided to give this a try.  I forgot the olives, but my kids probably wouldn't have eaten them anyways.  It was a hit!!!  Will try this again with probably both chicken and beef....  Yum!

This was a great recipe after I made it much easier.  I did the following:  Combine 6 frozen chicken breasts, chili powder, onion, taco seasoning, 1/2 of water (instead of the cup of water), onion powder, and garlic powder in a crockpot on low for 8-10 hours.  When this is done, drain juices into a bowl for later.  Add the chicken soup, 3/4 cup of sour cream (instead of 1 1/4 - way too much)butter, chilies, onions, and lime juice - stir.  Add the saved juices as needed for desired consistency.  Then just follow the remaining directions on how to bake.  So much easier!!  And turned out fabulous!

I have made this recipe twice now, and my family and I LOVE them. The first time I made them for a get together at my house and everyone loved them. I used extra enchilada sauce the first time and used the recommended amount the 2nd time, and I liked it better with a little more enchilada sauce.  With the extra enchilada sauce I was able to dip each side of the tortilla in the sauce before filling it with chicken and cheese, and still have some for pouring over the top.  Thank you for submitting this recipe, it's a keeper for sure!

The name said it all AWESOME, I have made this twice, once with regular and once with lite (soup, sour cream & cheese) and I could not tell the differance. So go ahead and try it, either way you will love it.

I've been craving Mexican food lately and there arent too many great places here in Hawaii.  I decided to look online for some recipes and came across this one.  This one surely beats any enchilada I've ever tasted.  It did take a little while to make which I would recommend shredding the chicken beforehand.  Didn't really need to make any substitutions except I used green enchilada sauce instead of the red and found it tastier.  My whole family absolutely loved it!

We LOVED these!!!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I have tried 3-4 other enchilada recipes that I've never wanted to make again because they were just 'ok'.  These were awesome, just as the name says!!  I didn't even use the green onion or black olives, which we love, but just didn't have on hand.  I also used 1/2 the cheese called for, because that's all we had.  And they still tasted great.  My husband even loved them, and he doesn't typically care for sour cream or chunky onions and green chilies...which says a lot.  Again, I'm super excited to finally have found a recipe that tastes great, one that I can make for company, and one that we all love.  Even my 15 month old was gobbling up the chicken!  Thank you!

Excellent enchiladas recipe. It was a lot easier than another recipe I tried and it was way more yummy.I used fat free cream of chicken soup, only 1 1/3lb chicken and 2 cups of cheese and it was perfect for my family of four.

These were excellent. I cut down on prep time buying a grocery store BBQ chicken. Didn't use the enchilada sauce, I just spooned some salsa on top before I added the cheese. I also used jalapeno corn tortillas. Yum!

I've never rated a recipe before, but this one was too good not to!  Only substitution I made was lemon juice for the lime b/c I was out of lime juice...otherwise made it exactly as written.  No need for Mexican takeout with this one in the recipe box!  Two thumbs up plus a toe!

I've been using this site for many years now and this is the first review I've ever written. These are by far the most delicious enchiladas I have ever made. They constantly get rave reviews by my family and not even a local restaurant can do them justice. To keep the calories down I use non fat cream of chicken and light sour cream. I suppose these are obvious changes which normally change the way an entire recipe tastes but not in this case. I will be making these many more times!

Fantastic recipe, followed it verbatim and nothing to criticize, delicious in every-way. I do recommend that you find a top quality enchilada sauce or make one from scratch, as this will significantly effect the overall quality of a dish like this, I used Taco Time Enchilada Sauce that is readily available in the Portland area, in the refrigerator section, find a good equivalent where you live, it will be worth it!

I messed this up, between the store bought sauce and the cheddar cheese this was really tangy and not as savory as it smelled while it cooked. I will try this again but with the Red Enchilada Sauce on this site and a mix of monterey jack and mild cheddar, put in some more chili powder.

I took the advice of another reviewer and threw 3 frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot with all the powdered seasonings. This definitely saved time, but since I poured out the liquid that was formed when I went to shred the chicken, I think I lost too much of the seasoning with the liquid. Next time, I'll add a little more seasoning after I'm done shredding. I ended up putting these together in the afternoon and placing them in the fridge until I got home later that evening. I threw them in the oven for about 45min. and dinner was served. They tasted awesome (though, like I said, they needed some additional seasoning added). My son's had a slumber party that night and in the morning, they ate the leftover enchiladas for breakfast!

These are amazing!! My BF loved them! I used a suggestion to boil a whole breast then shred. It was very simple. The whole recipe was very easy to put together and the leftovers were still delicious! Def keeper!! :)

WOW. These were by far the best enchiladas I have ever had. So cheesy and so FULL of flavor!! My husband had to fight for his share! The ONLY thing I changed was the cheese, I used a monteray jac/cheddar  blend. THANKS for the recipe! I will be making this many more times!!

Awesome! I made it exactly as the recipe stated. My whole family loved it! My husband said it was the best enchiladas he ever had and my son told me we should give this recipe to the local mexican resturant so they can make enchiladas this good. I think will just keep the recipe and make it at home. Thanks for sharing.

I liked the flavor. I will add a little more spice/heat next time. I also reserved the chicken broth and used it instead of plain water. I can't wait to make it again.

Yummy! The sauce with the chicken in the enchiladas was excellent. We will be making these again and adding a little bit more fire to some of the grown-up ones in the baking pan!

My search for a great chicken enchilada recipe is at an end!!!  This is IT!  To some, this may look like a complicated recipe, but take the time to make it.  I promise you won't regret it.  I was asked "Why don't you own your own restaraunt?" when I served these.  They are THAT good!   I'm not a huge fan of boiled chicken, so here's what I did - substituted the boneless, skinless chicken breasts with split, bone-in chicken breasts.  Seasoned with a little taco seasoning, wrapped them loosely in foil and cooked in my slow cooker on low for 6-8 hours. When done, I took them out of the slow cooker and let them rest 20-30 minutes in the foil.  This made shredding them very easy. Fantastic recipe!

These enchiladas were GREAT! I covered  half of each enchilada with red enchilada sauce and half green chili sauce. I also topped them with shredded lettuce and tomato. We ate them by themselves with no rice and got full halfway through. They have a restaurant appearance but a great homemade taste. I will never use another recipe again, this is by far one of my favorite meals yet. Thanks!

Found this recipe as a last minute dinner idea and was very pleased with it EXACTLY as it is!  I wouldn't change a thing!  My husband loved it and he's a very picky eater!  Will most definitely make again.

Wonderful!!  I have never had enchiladas before and I wasn't sure what to expect.  My family loved them.  My husband said they were awesome.  I followed others suggestions and poached the chicken whole in the taco seasoning, onion, water and garlic and then shredded.  It was't too labor intensive done that way.  I then reserved the poaching sauce and followed the recipe from there, omiting the addition of the water later on since I saved the poaching water and spice.  I also added a can of black beans to the chicken just for added texture and flavor.  They were wonderful.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Oh, Angela, you are sooooo right! These enchiladas ARE awesome. My husband, who rarely goes crazy over anything, LOVED these. My 8 year old son went back for more, which is unheard of. My 19 year old son could have eaten half of the recipe himself. Even the picky neighbor girl gobbled them up (after meticulously picking out the onions). This will be my go-to enchilada recipe from this day forward. Thanks for sharing it!

These were outstanding! I used three pre-baked chicken breasts from my deli and used Monetary Jack cheese instead of cheddar. Next time I'll try with corn tortillas. Yum-o!---- UPDATE: You must try these with corn tortillas, they're so much better this way. P.S. You only use like half of the meat mixture so plan accordingly; you may want to double the sour cream/ cream of chicken mixture, buy extra cans of enchilada sauce and olives, and more green onions so you can double the recipe; you don't want to waste all that chicken mixture. Also, there is no need to shred the chicken with two forks, just use your fingers and save some time for crying out loud:)

Didn't really care for these.  The sour cream and cream of chicken soup + chili powder didn't really "go" with these.  Also, I saw no need in heating that mixture.  I think you could just mix together in a bowl and add that way.  In addition, the chicken mixture was way too wet for an enchilada filling, so I ended up making this a layered casserole with lots of corn tortillas to try and absorb some of the moisture.  The taste was ho-hum, what I would equate to a Taco Bell version of "enchiladas"..  Being from TX, maybe I am just hard to please with Mexican food, but these just didn't really cut it.  My 3 yr old and I didn't like, but hubby seemed to think they were more thank okay..  Sorry, but I won't make these again.  There are several other enchilada recipes with "cream ofs" that taste MUCH better..

Very good!! I took another reviewers suggestion and used the fat free sour cream and reduced fat cream of chicken soup. We ate with adtl sour cream and some salsa on it...my family really liked it. I threw some shrimp in with the chicken because i was short on chicken, and also spread the shells with some refried beans before i filled them. I can see making different variations of this...all good!!

These were excellent!! Everyone loved them including my picky 2 year old! The only thing I did different was that I  added cumin and garlic powder to the water when boiling the chicken. This will be my only enchilada recipe from now on!! I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch!!!

These are truly awesome Angela!  Followed recipe to a T, doubling it.  I did doctor up my enchilada sauce as I always do, using 1-14 oz can good quality enchilada sauce and 1 -8 oz can tomato sauce, and adding tsp garlic powder, tsp onion powder, tsp cumin and Tblsp chili powder.  Gave one dish to some neighbors and they said they were the best chicken enchiladas they ever had!!  One change I'd like to try is using corn tortillas next time.  This is going in my keeper file for sure!

Made this for a family function.  AWESOME! This one was a hit with my family of good food critics.  Everyone raved about these. Will make these again.  The only thing I did differently, was that I didn't heat the sour cream and soup mixture, just added the hot chicken ingredients to it.  Not soupy or soggy.  Serve with homemade guacamole and sour cream. YUMMY!  Thank you, Angela

Never had a chicken enchilada before and made these today.They were tasty but I did find them a bit soupy(personal taste) so I think I'll cut back on the liquid next time as I did add re fried beans and that may have changed it a bit but flavor wise excellent we really enjoyed them.

So good on it's own and a good start for creating your own spins! The sauce and the spices are the secret and I'll be keeping this recipe on regular rotation.

This is  going to be a standard recipe for me.   I made it for friends who came over to eat, and it was quickly devoured.  So I made it again a week later, since my family, including my husband requested it.  The only changes I made was to leave olives off the top as I don't think they add to the flavor, and since I keep fresh cilantro in my frig, some chopped in the sauce was a must.  To kick it up a tad, also add some hot sauce  to the soup mix. Excellent.

Use authentic Mexican cheese instead!


Not too bad. It's  loaded with onions thats for sure.  The key ingredient I changed was using Queso Fresco instead of any random cheddar or "mexican" Kraft cheese and it was for the same price. It made the enchiladas gooey inside without all the excess cheese grease from shredded cheese.

Made it for the family and friends for New Year's and it was loved.

I made this tonight and it was truly a great recipe. Even my picky eater loved these enchiladas. I did prepare the chicken in the crock pot as one reviewer  suggested. It was a pretty fast recipe and I was worried about the cream soup sauce and  the enchilada red sauce not tasting good together. This wasn't the fact. They complimented each other very well. I will be making these again and again.

Everyone enjoyed it... I adjusted some things though: I used more chili powder, over 1 tsp.  I used small tortillas (5 or 6 inch) and it seemed to cook better and make it easer to split between everyone.  I also needed more room and used 1 large and 1 small glass dish.

Tasty! These freeze well too just dont put the enchilada sauce until you reheat them. Keep the chicken whole when boiling and when it's done shred with a hand mixer. thanks for a tasty recipe!

Delicious!  My whole family loved it.
SAVE TIME:  Use your hand mixer or stand mixer to shred your chicken.  Cook the chicken, put it in a deep bowl, and turn on the mixer!  It only takes seconds!!  (It works for shredded pork too)

Overall really solid  recipe I followed it exactly as written except for I made my own taco seasoning and also used Monterey Jack and pepper jack along with the cheddar cheese.  I garnished each plate with fresh cilantro- was a hit.

Excellent! I used 6 large chicken breasts cooked in a crock pot with chicken broth, bay leaves, onion flakes, lemon juice and pepper. I was able to make 7 very stuffed enchiladas using medium sizes flour tortillas. I would advise others to make sure you select an enchilada sauce that you really like. It will make or break this dish! I used 2 10oz cans of a mild sauce. Although it appeared like a lot of sauce it was perfect after it baked. Thank you for this recipe!

Great recipe! I've had this recipe for a couple of years and used it a few times usually doubling or tripling it. I live in Las Vegas with a large Hispanic community and hundreds of Mexican restaurants, in my opinion this beats most of them. The picture of the dish shows a red sauce and the recipe doesn't specify but green is normally used with chicken, that's the way I have always made them and always will.

Fantastic! I had smaller 8 ct. flour tortillas and using my scale I determined that the amount of chicken mixture worked out to 5.4 oz per tortilla. Also, used fat free sour cream and "healthy request" cream of chix soup. I felt 6 oz. of olives was way too much. Chopped up 1.5 oz to sprinkle over top. A full 6 oz. would have dominated the entire dish!

Incredible! I was a little skeptical of the cream sauce on the bottom but my thinking was completely wrong. It was a cool creamy contrast to the smokey enchilada sauce!

Family really liked this one!  Few things I did differently... I only used half-can of soup; whole can just seemed it would be too "soupy";  used can of Rotel in place of chopped green chilis (same thing, just with chopped tomatoes too); and used more chili powder to spice it up more.  And I shredded chicken rather than chopped it. Will do this one again, and maybe try steak.

Delicious! My boyfriend even had seconds---he never has seconds! Made as-is (except I used a 14.5 oz can of enchilada sauce). I wouldn't change a thing. Even great as leftovers, but I'd add more enchilada sauce when reheating!

These were so much better than I expected. Glorious, delicious, scrumptious. The sauce mixture was so tasty. I served them with Spanish rice and refried beans. Made exactly as directed. Garnished with seeded and diced plum tomatoes and a dollop of sour cream (or you could use Mexican crema). They freeze well and taste great reheated for leftovers.

These were delicious! My tweaks were minor--I didn't add more water to the shredded chicken because it was watery enough once I finished cooking it and I used 2 tablespoons of dried minced onion so I just added it to the shredded chicken mixture and didn't use butter. 

The biggest difference I ran into was that I couldn't fit 5 tortillas in my 9x13 pan (I guess I didn't wrap them tight enough). I use 4 tortillas as directed and then poured the remaining chicken mixture over the top of the tortillas. This allowed me to use the entire chicken mixture without using a second small baking dish. I then added the remaining ingredients as directed. A great meal!!!

Great recipe! Alot of prep time but worth it!

I made a couple small changes: seasoned and cooked the meat on an indoor grill rather than boiling it. Used corn tortillas rather than flour as I find they hold up to being soaked in sauce better, especially for the leftovers. I also added bell peppers as I felt it was lacking veggies. 

Will definitely make again using more veggies and make a bigger batch! My boys say it's definitely a keeper!! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I have made this a couple of times. It is the best I've ever had. You won't be disappointed! I use a rotisserie chicken to save time. I also use the smallest tortillas so it makes more servings. I put 8 in a 13x9 and 4 more in an 8x8. Love this recipe!

My husband said it was delicious and I agree!  Made it with light sour cream and reduced the amount to 3/4 C and used low fat, low sodium soup. Added a pinch of cumin.  I didn't put cheese inside the enchiladas and only put 1/4 C of grated colby jack cheese on top which melted really well and spread out to cover each enchilada.  Also, I shredded 2 leftover grilled chicken breast (which was less than the called for 2 lbs). Used Pam spray in a non-stick pan to sautee white onion with 1/2 of a green & 1/2 of a red bell pepper. I didn't have green onions, black olives or onion powder. Four stars because the tortillas were really soggy. And that is after I toasted them on my gas stove top.  Overall.. excellent taste and I will try the crock pot suggestion to save time!  Thanks for sharing! I wish I was creative enough to come up with such a delish recipe!

Absolutely awesome!  I didn't change a thing and they were perfect.  Probably wouldn't even notice if the garlic and onion powders were left out.

I am not a terribly experienced cook, and I have come to realize that my food is not ever going to be very pretty.  That being said, sometimes I simplify recipes to make them easier for me to assemble.  In this case, I cooked the chicken, spices, peppers, and onions all day in the slow cooker.  I made the cream sauce and put some in the bottom of my baking dish.  I drained the liquid from the slow cooked chicken/spice/veggie mixture, then put it in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer to shred.  I added the remaining cream sauce and cheese shreds into the mixer as well.  No, it was not pretty, but it was much less messy to wrangle into tortillas and then into the baking dish.  Once baked with red sauce and more cheese, they didn't look too ugly.  I had more compliments on them than most dishes I've cooked for the family, and it was so easy to prepare.  I am making another batch today - one day after I made my first batch.  They were that popular!

I have never made enchiladas before - these turned out awesome!! My husband who grew up in a mexican town says they are REALLY good - not very authentic tasting, but he told me this recipe was a keeper. The only reason i'm giving it 4 stars is because I don't think it would have been nearly as good if I wouldn't have made some changes:
I doubled the recipe (mostly) - In a crockpot on high for 4 hrs i added water, packet of taco seasoning, 1 lb ground beef and 3 chicken breasts, along with dried pequin, serrano, and guajillo chiles. 
Instead of just sautéing onion (used 3/4 of a red onion) - I also threw in 4 jalapeños, 1/2 green bell pepper, 3 garlic cloves, more of the pepper blend along with cumin, chili powder, oregano, paprika, blk peppercorns, and salt. I only used 1 bunch of green onions & 1 cup of water total for the recipe. 
The milk mixture - I used a little less sour cream, and 1 full tsp Chili Powder along with some spices listed above. I didn't measure out the cheese, just put on whatever. They turned out great  - just the right amount of spice and will definitely be making them again. I froze 3/4 of them - so hopefully they will turn out good when unthawed and reheated! Next time I will add the rest of the 28oz can of enchilada sauce (I only used 2/3 this time) and will stick with the same green chilis- 505 brand.

I have made this recipe many times now.  The most recent time I omitted the cream of chicken soup (didn't have any on hand), and layered the tortillas, chicken mix and cheese and topped with enchilada sauce to make more of a mexican lasagna.  My family preferred this method as it was simply easier to prepare and eat.

These are fantastic.  I will be making again.  Just next time will use less cheese.  I'm a cheese guy but these are so good even w/o cheese I don't want to use much at all.  I didn't have room for the 5th one in my pan cuz I'm bad at rolling them lol so I just ate the 5th one as was and it was divine.  I only did one thing different.  I happened to cook the chicken that day,  6 hours in slow cooker on low with some taco seasoning, but all I did differently was in step 2 instead of the water to mix in with the chicken and onions, I used some of the broth from cooking the chicken.  Thanks for the recipie!

Family loved it! Used cream of mushroom, instead of cream of chicken. Didn't use green onions or onion powder, because I didn't have any.
I didn't put the soup mixture on the bottom of the pan. I ended up mixing the entire soup mixture into the chicken mixture. I warmed up the tortillas a bit on a gas stove before filling them.
I doubled the recipe to fill 20 six inch tortillas and still had plenty of sauce leftover.
AMAZING!

These are awesome!! I get compliments every time I make them. I did make it my own by adding and pureeing  cilantro, jalapeno peppers, and green onions in the enchiladas not on (hubby wont eat vegetables. I have to hide them) I used Emerils  red enchilada sauce recipe also adding cilantro and jalapeno. I pop leftover sauce in freezer for next time. My great aunt says these taste just like the ones at her favorite Mexican restaurant in Texas.

I've made this recipe for years with one basic change that doesn't altar the flavor, but makes it much quicker to put together. I put a small amount of soup mixture in the bottom of the dish and then layer the tortillas and chicken mixture. 
Another time saving tip is to make enough of the cooked chicken on a different night to have extra to make this dish. I usually do a broccoli/chicken dish on one night and have enough reserved chicken to use for this a day or so later in the week.

So good, they should be illegal!  Have made this twice in past 2 weeks, plan on making it again soon.  Only change I made was I put the chicken in a slow cooker with the onions and taco season for 5 hours, and when I pulled it out, it shreded on its own.  Being lazy, this made it much easier.

Delicious!! I'm so glad someone recommended the crock pot because it really saves on work without taking anything away. I followed the advice of the first "most helpful positive" review from Jen Uhrlaub. I easily shredded the chicken right in the crock pot after it had been cooked for a few hours on low (I had small chicken breast tenders) and then added the cream mixture to the pot in the end right before assembling. We'll definitely be making these again!

This turned out very good. The second time I cooked this I used the shredded chicken from ltlmsmfft's Slow Cooker Cilantro Lime Chicken and it came out even better. The leftovers are melt in your mouth flavors.

Fantastic! My family loves these.  Makes 5 very well sized/stuffed enchiladas.  In some I add jalapenos inside and on the top for my heat lovers.  I have also cooked the chicken (whole boneless breasts) in a crockpot, with the taco seasoning and 1/2 C water, during the day while at work. When finished cooking the juices from the chicken with the water added to cook will yield pretty close to the 1 C called for in the recipe. Then I just shred the cooked chicken right in the crockpot, add the rest of the ingredients for the chicken mixture and let it cook for another 30 minutes or so while I make the soup mixture, preheat the oven, and get everything else ready to go. That's a real time saver!

I loved this recipe! I did make a few changes which made the enchiladas much tastier !! Instead of bringing the chicken to a boil, I baked my chicken in the oven, added a little olive oil to keep it moist, added several seasonings & baked it! I shredded the chicken after i took it out f the oven, and I feel it gave the recipe more flavor, and it can't wait to make this again!!!

This was fabulous.  I followed the recipe almost to a T.  I left out the green onions and olives due to preference.  Other than that kept everything as written.  I will say that it is very labor intensive but the end product was fantastic.  I actually prepared the chicken the night before and then finished everything up the next day.  It kind of helped to breakup the work time.  I'd definitely recommend this recipe to anyone.

Wow!! Yes, you DO want to try this recipe!  It is amazingly good and easily adaptable to your family's tastes. I omitted the onion because my husband doesn't care for them. Although I love onions, I couldn't tell that they were missing.  I grilled the chicken and sprinkled it with the seasonings included in this recipe, plus a bit of cumin and some onion salt.  Next time I won't add additional salt because the taco seasoning has plenty.  I may try this in the slow cooker as another reviewer did, as it does take some time to prepare....but it's definitely worth the work. :)

This was an excellent recipe.  I only made a few changes.  I didn't put the green onions in the filling, I just sprinkled them on top.  I also used corn tortillas. Yummy!! I made a large batch and ate the leftovers 3 days in a row!! Loved them, and will definitely be making these again soon. Thanks for the great recipe!

I left off the black olives and substituted corn tortillas, with only those two changes this recipe is exceptional. I couldn't get 12' corn tortillas, but the standard size corn tortillas worked fine. I had enough of the chicken filling mixture to make probably eleven enchiladas, but the 9" x 13' pan would hold only eight. Next time I will try browning the tortillas lightly, but I'm not sure that will be worth the extra time it will take to brown eight tortillas. Even though I didn't brown the tortillas for this first effort, the outcome was easily the best enchiladas I have ever eaten. Thanks a lot to MomSavedbyGrace!

It was very good - I had left over rotisserie chicken and that saved a lot of time! The filling was perfect - but I didn't have really good enchilada sauce - next time I will - otherwise I would not change a thing!

With minor variations.  Used half cream cheese and half sour cream.  Used 6inch tortillas and substituted home dried chiles for the canned.  Hubby and mom in law loved it!

These enchiladas were really good. Good flavor. You could make this recipe with things right out of your pantry.  I used chicken tenders, they're a lot easier to shred than the regular breast meat.

These are excellent enchiladas! I substituted ground chicken and browned it with the onions instead of cooking the onions separately in butter, but otherwise followed the rest of the directions. This is a keeper! Thanks Angela!

cook your chicken with seasonings and some chicken broth in the crock pot.  You will get far better results and shredding won't be as difficult.  2nd, I don't like to use taco seasoning as it's full of salt.  I mix my shredded chicken with sauteed onions, garlic, and jarred jalapenos with some softened cream cheese (4-8 oz depending on how much chicken you have) and generous amounts of cumin, some op/gp/pep.  For the sauce, similar to this, I mix 1 can cream of mushroom with 8oz sour cream, 1 cup milk, and a handful of chopped (jar) jalapenos. Pour sauce over enchiladas and bake 40 mins covered (we don't like red ench sauce).  Top with shred cheddar and bake until it melts.  I like to serve them with black beans.

If you are looking for a genuine enchilada recipe -- this isn't it.  This probably is OK for a "Mexican style" kid-friendly casserole, but there's a lot of work here for not much of anything resembling a true enchilada.  I'll keep looking for something else.

I've made this a couple times now, and really love it! First time I used corn tortillas (because it's what I had) they crumbled a bit but the flavor was really great. I then used the flour and liked those as well, they didn't fall apart like the initial attempt. I am keeping this one in my favorites list

This recipe was awesome! My family, including 2 picky boys, really liked it. Didn't change a thing except subbing chicken broth for the water.  Recipe made 8 huge enchiladas, more than I expected but nice to have a couple leftover. Would definitely make again!!

Followed a Jen Urlhaub's reviewer advice and put frozen chicken breasts into a slow cooker with seasonings, it worked very well.  The family (well, the meat eaters) loved it!  Next time I'll have to make veggie enchiladas as well.  I ran out of tortillas....

I modified it a lot.  I added minced onion, garlic to the pan, and then cubed chicken. I then added sour cream, evaporated milk, 1 tbsp cream cheese.  I also added cumin, chili powder and salt/pepper. I stuffed 6 tortillas with the mixture, put salsa on the bottom of the baking dish and then added 1 can of enchilada sauce on top of each enchilada and then cheese and sliced olives.

This was definitely a different take on your regular enchilada recipe. I would recommend only adding green onion on top and use green enchilada sauce instead of the traditional red. Otherwise a great way to make them!

I made this recipe after doing an ingredient search of what I had in the fridge.  With the ton of great reviews I was expecting something great, and I was definitely disappointed. This was very bland and the only thing that came close to tasting like enchiladas was the canned sauce.  I think using corn tortillas instead of flour, and omitting the cream soup would have made this recipe three stars instead of two.  My DH who will eat almost anything didn't even care for  this.

They were awesome. My husband couldn't stop eating. I even used ground chicken and ground turkey I browned and they were great. So flavorful. Love the hint of lime. Makes them tangy too.

Really good! I cooked my chicken breasts on the forman grill with salt and pepper. Instead of using a can of chilis, I added a can of Rotelle and also added a can of rinsed and drained black beans..very tasty!

The idea is great, but  I never eat processed food, so had to adapt quite a bit.  Made a white/ sauce, added some chopped fried mushrooms  and sharp grated cheese instead of the soup and  the enchilada sauce. Then and used. fresh organic spices instead of seasoning mix.  Turned out pretty well.

This continues to be a family favorite - everytime!  The chicken filling is excellent!  Even before the enchiladas were in the oven, we knew this was going to be great!  

Made it again with leftover shredded pork loin...just as wonderful!!

The name says it all: AWESOME!  My husband hates homemade Mexican food, but he loved this recipe!  I had a guest drop in at supper time, and she enjoyed this as well.  Everyone had seconds, and it made wonderful leftovers, too.  THANKS for sharing a real keeper!

These are absolutely amazing! They are restaurant quality, but not as heavy of an enchilada as you would get at a Mexican restaurant. Super yummy!

I made this twice.  The first time exactly as written, and the second with leftover mesquite-smoked chicken and plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and it was incredible both times.  Definitely a crowd pleaser.  It's going on regular rotation in our meal plan!

I rated this recipe a 4 and the ONLY reason I did was one MAIN thing and then just something simple.  PLEASE don't use canned enchilada sauce on this AMAZING recipe!  This recipe is fantastic and deserves a homemade sauce!  The only other thing I did different was used 1 cup of homemade chicken stock in place of the water and used thigh meat instead of breast meant, my preference :)  Thanks  MomSavedbyGrace for an amazing recipe :)

I boiled the chicken in broth and saved the liquid. I added it to the chicken mixture instead of adding water.  I also added jalapenos to the chicken and subbed greek yogurt for the sour cream. Finally it's best to use corn tortillas instead of flour; the flour tortillas will 'dissolve' in all the liquid.  Great recipe!

This was amazing. I used two 9x13 dishes & each dish had 4 enchilladas in it. They were freaking huge. One pan I used red enchillada sauce & the other I used green. Both were great, although I think I liked the red a little more.

This was truly one of the best recipes I have encountered!  My family is still raving over this recipe weeks later.  The only change I made was to bake chicken tenders in the oven at 425 until cooked through and used those as the base for my shredded chicken.  Much simpler process.  Outstanding.

This is an excellent recipe! Totally worth the time and effort for this dish.  The only thing I changed was corn tortillas instead of flour.  My husband loved it! He even took some with him for lunch today and that NEVER happens!  Thanks, Angela!

The only reason I am not giving this recipe 5 stars is because I had to make several adjustments to fit my taste. The cream of chicken mixture really makes this recipe a great success in my family.

1) I opted for traditional corn tortillas
2) I opted for a mixture of Monterey Jack cheese and queso fresco Mexicano
3) I used jalapeños for the chicken mixture
4) I skipped the olives and lime juice
5) To make the tortilla a bit more flavorful I dip each one in the enchilada sauce before stuffing and rolling
6) Lastly, I made my own enchilada sauce using a recipe on this site titled "ten minute enchilada sauce"

Thanks for sharing this recipe- always a hit!

I have a new respect for Mexican food and the people who make it fresh.  It is a lot of work but totally worth it.  My son in law who is from Arizona raved about this dinner and he is VERY picky.  I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious.  I needed to make it a day ahead of time so I followed another suggestion and used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  I did everything else cold (no heat, no butter) and put it in the fridge over night.  Turned out perfect and delicious!!

This was just ok.  The cream of chicken made the flavor of the enchiladas taste weird in my opinion.

These things are awesome, just like the title.  I've made them at least 4 times now.  I don't change anything other than adding a can of black beans.  The sauce is so wonderful, I'm always tempted to double it, but for calorie count, rein in my enthusiasm.  We fed our neighbor one just this week and he raved on and on about them.  Definitely a crowd pleaser.

Wonderful.  I did the crock pot idea with a little water in the bottom and frozen breasts as suggested and it made the filling turn out amazing.  I also put more green chiles in than suggested.  You can play around with spices with this.

This is a great recipe!  A little time consuming but definitely worth it!  I wanted to cut down the calories, so only used 1/2 can of chicken soup, lite sour cream and 1 lb chicken.  They weren't so "full" but still very tasty!!!
Everyone in my family loved these!  That's a real miracle!

This was the BEST recipe for enchiladas I've ever tasted! My husband really doesn't like trying new things and is very picky which annoys me bcuz he is the only one in our family of 5 that's like that. My son saw me make this and practically circled by the oven til it was done and refused waiting for it to cool off before he ate it. My whole family scarfed this down without chewing LOL. Even I was amazed on how delicious it was. My husband even asked me why hadn't I made this meal before. I will be making this often. The only thing I left out was the lime juice and black olives because I didn't have any and was NOT going on a grocery run and next time I will be using the low sodium taco seasoning. I also used whole wheat flour tortillas which there is no difference in taste then regular ones just a healthier version. It did not come out overly salty but just a tad. I think that simple change in taco seasoning will make it spectacular! I served it with Zatarain's spanish rice. This meal is DELICIOUS!!!!

Everytime I make these my husband goes crazy.  It's such a good recipe.  We usually buy smaller tortilla's and just make more of them.  I shred my chicken in my stand mixer, takes about 30 seconds.  I've made this for guests as well and everyone really enjoys it.

These were delicious! I added a can of Rotel tomatoes to the filling and it made enough for two large pans.  Buy extra tortillas to fill and invite a few friends over.  Since I live in Germany, where Mexican food is mostly nonexistent, these really satisfied my craving with easy to find ingredients.

Loved it! I used the crockpot also for my chicken and it turned out great! I also used less of the green onions, just because my kids aren't crazy about them. Served it with side of sour cream and guacamole. Everyone loved them!

Delicious!  I've made this several times since I found the recipe.  The whole family loves these enchiladas!  I usually just bake my seasoned chicken breast and leave out the green onions.

These were amazing, I did cook my chicken breast in the crockpot with 1/2 the taco seasoning so all I had to do was mix it all together when I got home. I also used  1 can soup and 1 cup sour cream because I didnt want it to be to soupy.  I used corn tortillas so they wouldnt be mushy and extra chili powder because we like spicy! Served with "spanish rice I " from this site and garnished with lettuce and sour cream. My husband and 14 yr old went nuts over them! This is a really great recipe!!

I have been making this recipe for about a year. My family loves it. I make it without changing a thing. I cook my chicken with cajun seasoning before shredding. Thanks for the great recipe !

Family loved it. I think I'll only put in 1/2 cup water next time though as it was a bit saucy. I added in some black beans and some spinach also with the chicken mixture.

This was time consuming but worth it! Very tasty. My husband liked them a lot but he even noticed it took awhile to get them in the oven. I will make these again but maybe just once in awhile. I served it with guacamole, salsa and a little sour cream on the side. I was going to make a rice side to go with it but decided not to.  Good thing i didnt because I was stuffed after eating just one. Good recipe!

These are by far the best enchiladas we have ever had!  I made it exactly like the recipe called for the first time and have made it several other times with just a couple of changes.  I did not have green chilies and we did not miss them.  I also found it too spicy with the chili powder, so I omit that.  Everyone LOVES them!!

My son regularly requests these awesome enchiladas. I use rotisserie chicken to save time and light sour cream, soup and cheese to reduce calories and they are still delicious! A+ recipe!

This is the second Enchilada recipe that I have tried and I really liked it.  The kids loved it.  We ended up throwing away the leftovers for the first recipe but there were none left with this recipe!

I did this the easy way and made it in the crockpot going by another users suggestions. That cuts down a lot of having to wash a lot of pans and makes shredding the chicken so darn easy. These are AMAZING, even without some of the ingredients. I used what I had on hand, so no olives, no green onions. They are better than at a Mexican restaurant. One of our local Mexican places is always busy, it's the best in town, and I still prefer these enchiladas from this recipe to theirs. They were amazing.

I have made beef enchaladas for years, but have never tried a chicken recipe until now.  These were fantastic!  I was nervous at first going into this, but my confidence grew as I began to smell all the flavors.  I recommend not changing a thing.  Make these enchaladas and you WILL love them.

My husband was skeptical about me making another enchilada recipe, but he loved this one!  The soup and sour cream are a nice addition!  Very easy to make however, I could do without the onions.  The spices give plenty of flavor.

Really good but too spicy. I have made a couple of times and ellimnated a few spices, to no avail. I think it is the can of green chiles. Duh.

This is by far my favorite recipe on this site! My husband and I drool over this meal. I would change nothing if I had a choice (my husband recentlly went gluten free and we haven't found corn tortillas that hold up well for this yet). Makes great for leftovers too!

This was awesome.  I used a rotisserie chicken from Sam's instead of cooking the chicken.  I did add 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 cup of salsa as recommended by another reviewer...not sure if they made any difference though.

This is a great recipe, but the first time I made it I noticed they were really soggy which my husband and I didn't care for. So now we just bake them and warm up the sauce in the saucepan. Then we put the sauce on top just before serving. This way they will not get soggy.

Absolutely fantastic!  My three boys play high school football....so I needed to double the recipe. They devoured it and said its a new favourite   Hard to find canned enchilada sauce in north west Canada, but found a quick and easy recipe to make it from scratch.

This is in one word an "awesome" recipe!  I consider myself a bit of a "foodie" and this recipe will NOT dissapoint!  I have made it several times and it always turns out amazing!  The only thing I do different is use a rotissiere chicken instead of making my own chicken.  It just cuts out a step.  I also use the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan instead of the cream sauce.  It's an A+ recipe :)

I have made this for my family several times. Everyone loves it...even my two year old. Not two spicy, not bland. It is perfect as is. I have varied it some once in a while. This last time I added an onion and a stalk of celery to the whole breasts as they simmered. I had thought they would impart some flavor. They did, but not enough to warrant much improvement. The recipe is terrific as it is. I also use McCormick Enchilada Mix and tomato sauce and just follow those directions. We like that better than canned enchilada sauce. Whenever short on time though the canned works fine enough. I have also used a rotiserrie chicken and must say that does change the flavor a fair amount. I prefer it with just plain chicken breast. Thighs work great, too.

Looking for the perfect enchilada recipe, look no farther - so much flavor! The only thing I might change next time is leaving out the onion powder. I added a can of diced tomato with onion, celery and green pepper to the spanish rice and it was a great compliment.

My family loves these enchiladas! Super easy to make, and you really can't go wrong...even if you don't have all the ingredients they will still turn out great.  I've made them with no sour cream (not as good, but what do you do) and also without the green onions and lime.  I prefer to only use half the taco seasoning otherwise it seems kind of strong, and also instead of 1 c. water, I use the water from the chicken that I boiled. I will make this again and again.

We loved this! Tons of flavor too. A lot of work but totally worth it! We made this with homemade Spanish rice and it was a big hit! This will now go into the monthly rotation!

this is THE favorite in our house!! It is a bit time consuming with the chicken shredding and such, but the flavor payout is well worth it. This is always my fallback meal when I'm having company as well. Follow the recipe exactly as written, except I don't put on the black olives until after its cooked. My fiance hates them so I just sprinkle them over my portion. Going to make them again tonight for out-of-town family!!!!

Great stuff!  As another reviewer mentioned, I think the meat would make for great tacos as well.  Next time I will make a homemade enchilada sauce instead of canned, but it was great even with the canned.

I've made these twice now, once as directed cooking the chicken in water and once using the store bought roasted chicken both time they turned out delicious. My son even told me this is his new favorite dish that I make.

I used chicken thighs for more flavor and cooked them in the crockpot with the taco seasoning, garlic powder and chopped onion.  After 4hours on high the meat was falling apart(no need to shred) and was delicious .  This made this great recipe easier than ever.

So delicious! I took the advice of several other commentators on here and put the chicken and spices in the crock-pot during the day and then sauteed the rest at night right before assembling them. LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! It is our go to dish for rushed days.

These were okay. My family liked them, but didn't rave. Awesome didn't come to mind. The tortillas were mushy and this was almost too salty. I don't think I'll be making this again. Sorry. :-(

This was fabulous. I used two chicken breasts, held the black olives and used green enchilada sauce. I sprinkled cold cojita cheese on top after these were out of the oven and it was so delicious!

This is a great recepe. I have been cooking Tex Mex for decades. This was a great recipe. In the preparation process I tasted bits and pieces as I went along. I was concerned it would be so-so. Only when the whole dish was all together did it really dance and sing with flavor and it did! I used a little more lime juice (tasted as I went along). Reading many reviews I thought of putting salsa in the cream of chicken sauce . . . but had none on hand, did have canned tomatoes with chilies, so I added half the can (7 oz.). Don’t know if I will do that next time. This is a GREAT recipe. I did follow the review (voted most helpful) using a crock pot. Made the whole cooking process easier and most likely tastier.

I didn't care for this--it seemed dry and had too many ingredients. I guess I like to stick to a simpler recipe for enchiladas because I like my "normal" ones better.

These are amazing! I didn't have onion powder, and it was just fine without it. I also used hot sauce instead of chili powder because I didn't have that either. I would definitely make these again. Used whole grain tortillas and light sour cream, and 2% cheese.

These were pretty good, but I proabably won't make them again. They weren't very enchilada-y, certainly not very mexican. They were creamy and gooey and make your tummy pretty happy, but they are certainly completely bad for you and fattening. They were tastey, but not true enchiladas.

I have made these maybe 5 times now, varying the recipe a little by maybe adding more cheese or more sauce or even more green chilies and, no matter what I do to this recipes, it turns out amazing. I will never use another enchilada recipe. These are absolutely perfect. Even my mom who is an enchilada perfectionist said that these are the best she has ever had. These are even great 2 and 3 days later as leftovers!

If you put the warm chicken breasts in a stand mixer (I have Kitchen Aide stand mixer) and mix for a couple minutes, it will shred your chicken perfectly.

These are amazing.  I don't have the greatest luck in the kitchen, but these turned out delicious.  If you're a less-than-gifted cook like me, cook the chicken in the crockpot as others have suggested, and these are foolproof.  I added black beans to sneak some fiber into our diets.

Oh my god, a recipe my kids just gobbled up and licked the plate.  This deserves 5 stars.  I didn't have Enchilada sauce, but had a bit of Ragu pasta sauce so I used that and it was just fine.  A keeper for sure as the kids already asked when I make it again.

This recipe is AWESOME! I do substitute the flour tortillas for corn tortillas. This is crucial! My boyfriend and roommate would eat these enchiladas every night if I had time to make them. Yes they take time but trust me it's definitely worth it!!!

Hubby absolutely loved and even commented that I am not allowed to make beef enchiladas ever again. I did not make any changes except that I made my own taco seasoning and not packaged.

Loved this recipe!! Husband ate two each day for 3 days. Only thing I did differently was I didn't put cheese in the enchilada and just put a little extra on top. Will make again soon.

I altered it a bit. I used ground turkey, plain yogurt instead of sour cream, I used Meijer fat free chicken soup and the Meijer red enchilada sauce. I also heated the tortillas on the gas stove burner grate, It says it take almost 2 hours I was able to kick it all out in less than one hour. Served with homemade Guacamole.

This is the best recipe I've made thus far.  I doesn't remind of me true restaurant style, but it's pretty darn good and fresh/authentic tasting versus the others you see with cans of cream of chicken, etc.

These were absolutely awesome!  I divided the recipe and made half with red enchilada sauce and half with green, so I used more sauce than the recipe called for and I actually wish I would have bought extra; I guess we like 'em extra saucy!

I used left over roast chicken and when I added water to it as directed it just soaked into the chicken which I found strange. I thought it would be awful but I was wrong.   My husband doesn't like Mexican food and he said this is as good as it gets.  The only thing I would change is to make it more spicy.  Maybe some jalapenos or something.  Excellent though.

This was amazing!  My first time making chicken enchiladas and I wowed everyone!  I did make some minor adjustments.  I boiled a whole chicken, just a little over 5 lbs. with onions, garlic, rosemary, carrots and celery plus other spices to flavor up the chicken.  And I only used 3/4 cup of sour cream and added a handful or two of shredded mexican blend of cheeses as well as some Cholua sauce (can use tapito or Tabasco).  I also added the liquid from the chili to the onions while I sauteed the.   I will be making this again and again!

Fantastic taste.  Everyone said they were the best enchiladas they'd ever eaten.  Shared the recipe with two guests.  Used the lite soup and sour cream as suggested for a few fewer calories.

These are incredible! I left out the onoin and green onions because my son doesn't like them and we didn't miss them at all. I also left out the lime juice and onion powder since I was out. Again, didn't miss those ingredients at all. I've made this recipe several times and each time it's a huge hit.

My whole family liked these enchiladas!  Great alternative to beef.  I made as shown except omitted onions cause of my picky kids.  Next time I will try to use low-fat ingredients to make them a little healthier. They were delicious!

This is a very good recipe and not very hard to put together. To save time I used a pre-cooked chicken from the store. I did add a little extra enchilada sauce.

Excellent recipe!  Never a fan of highly cheese encrusted tortillas called enchiladas. But these were great!!  Followed recipe and only added some minced garlic and some chopped cilantro to sauce!  My family loved them.  Thanks Angela!

This dish was amazing!
I did fat free sour cream and low fat cheese, and it still came out great. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made my version of this for years with green enchilada sauce, and it's incredible. My husband devours it in a day. Following Angela's recipe, exactly, only sub the green for red. It adds a bite that red lacks. Ideally, making your own tomatillo  sauce is the best, but who's got that time?

This was AWESOME.  We left off the olives and green onions and covered it in green salsa.  My family inhaled this!  Even my 10 year old picky butt asked for seconds....definitely going to be a staple in our house!

I used my leftover Thanksgiving turkey in this recipe and it was fabulous!  The only changes I made were to use corn tortillas and I added extra cheese because my family loves the cheese.  I like the less spicy version, but this can easily be kicked up a notch  by adding hot sauce or red pepper flakes.  Delicious.  Thank you for a great recipe for my leftovers!

They were good but not what I expected. For all the extra ingredients and extra time to prepare them this special way I really was expecting them to "wow" me, but they were no better than a much more basic creamy chicken enchilada recipe.

Perfect! I followed the crock pot suggestion for the chicken and it turned out amazing! Since it makes a lot, I took it into work (cut the enchiladas in thirds prior to serving) and it was gone in less than 10 minutes! I like my food a bit spicy, so I added crushed red pepper flakes for a kick.

Save yourself time and buy a rotisserie chicken!  I bought my rotisserie chicken from Walmart...  worth every cent of $4.98.  It's so juicy and flavorful.  AND you can get more out of your money by making a chicken broth with the bones like I did.

Delish.

This made me wanna slap my mama--it was that good! I used a rotisserie chicken, and fat-free or low fat for the sour cream, condensed soup, cheese. Also used EVOO to sautee instead of butter and topped the enchiladas with a black bean salsa. Muy bueno!

These were flavorful but the chicken came out kind of weird and mushy....maybe too much of the soup mixture?  I'll probably keep looking for the perfect enchilada recipe.

A lot of work (2 hours) and a lot of pans but well worth it in the end.  The only thing I changed was to omit the black olives for my boyfriend (actually he became my fiance while they were cooking!)

These were delicious! I made one 9 x 13 pan of these, which worked out to seven enchiladas (rather than 5) and still had leftover chicken at the end, which I'll use to make a tortilla stack or something this weekend. I think the cheese inside the enchiladas is good, but can certainly be optional, as there is plenty of cheese on top. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it.

These were pretty good. The taco seasoning overpowered it just a little bit, I'd like to have tasted more filling.

I would recommend using corn tortillas for a real good flavor. I used wheat instead, and it took away some taste (you really taste the wheat as opposed to flour).

I also used monterey jack cheese instead, cheddar is just too much for the dish in my opinion.

I heated the tortillas in a pan w a little enchilada sauce to cover the entire tortilla. Might have been a bad choice, was a bit soggy.

This made 8 enchiladas (big) using 12" tortillas. There's a lot of chicken filling! Depends on how much you plan to put inside, I suppose.

Pretty good, but I'd like to try a different enchilada sauce next time, I used Old Paso or El Paso whatever it is, and it wasn't very good.

The overall taste was pretty good, and I'll have to do some tweaking for next time.

I have wanted to make this for a long time, but was hesistant because of the length of time to make. But I had time yesterday. It was very easy, I didn't cut up the chichen until it was cooked, much easier to shred and saved time from cutting it up in the first place. Made recipe as written. Very good. Chicken was perfect, flavours were great. I have another recipe for chicken enchilada's that I ususally make and hubby loves, but he said that these were better and given the choice, he would pick these, look like a I have a new rotation recipe. My picky 9 year old even liked them! Oops, I lied, didn't make as written, left off the olives, we aren't an olive family.

Awesome!!!! I was a little worried about the cream of chicken soup and sour cream flavors, but it turned out great. I only made two small changes. I used corn tortillas instead of flour and added half a can of diced tomatoes & green chilies for a little more flavor to the meat mixture. These were even better the next day after all the flavors settled!

I've made this for the second time and cooking the chicken in the crockpot made the flavors really pop. I actually omited the butter this go around and only added the green onions on top. Cooking the meat in the crockpot is a MUST TRY...all I had to do was stir it with a fork and it fell apart.

This is a great recipe.  I followed another persons idea to put the chicken in a crockpot with the taco seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, chopped onion, and I added a can of rotel original that morning. That afternoon the chicken was easily shredded.  I added the other filling ingredients to the crock pot and stir it up. Then I just assemble per the directions.  I then baked it for 40-45 mins.  I made some Mexican rice... wonderful!  Awesome recipe, my family stated that it was the best they ever ate, I agree.

I have made this recipe many, many times and the only thing I change is that I shred the chicken. I told my kids I was making them today and one of them said "I feel like Angela is part of our family." Thanks Angela for a great recipe!

These babies are incredible!! BUT they are incredibly HIGH in fat and calories!  Must make them lighter and less fattening!!  That is my goal...I'm starting with Fat Free or light everything and I'm gonna use the crock pot to make the chicken to see if I can intensify the flavor!!!

Wow...we loved these.  I cooked the chicken in a crock pot on high for 2.5 hours with some water, garlic and onion owder, salt and pepper and hafl the packet of taco seasoning and shredded it the night before and put it in the fridge.  The next night after work I putmade the sauce and simmered the chicken with the other ingredients then assembled the dish.  Delicious.  Not too good for the wasteline...I went heavy on the cheese too.  Next time I'll definitely serve it over rice

These have become a staple in my house since they're my husband's favorite meal.  I do not add anything, but I do exclude the olives, onions, and chilies because my family is not big on those.  Served with rice and black beans and a chilmol, and you've got a crowd-pleaser!!

Hands down, these are the best enchiladas i have ever made/eaten. I have made them 3 times now; including yesterday for my birthday party. People raved about them. I followed the directions exactly; I just trippled the recipe. Worth the time it takes to make them. I usually cook and shred the chicken the day before. It really helps especially when your in a time crunch. Highly recommend!

Excellent enchilada recipe!  I have used the same enchilada recipe for years, and it will now be replaced by this one.  I followed the suggestions, and cooked the chicken in the crock pot - made for an easy week night dinner.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  We live overseas and are from California and desperately miss mexican food.  This is the closest to San Diego style enchiladas we've found.  We make a couple small changes: we only use enough of the sour cream/soup mixture to cover the bottom of the pan (we found that if we used what was left after adding it to the chicken mixture it caused the tortillas to get soggy) and we use corn instead of flour tortillas (our preference really).  It's a bit time consuming, but SO worth it!  Make these!  You won't be dissapointed!

These were great! It's just me and my husband, so I made them with only 1 lb. of chicken. We both really liked them, but my husband said "it needs more chicken"! So the recipe is right on! I'll definitely make this again!

I make these anytime we're having guests or if we are dropping meals off for friends/family. I use 10 soft taco tortillas instead of 5 larger tortillas and that works better for me.  the flavor is great!

Slow simmering brings all the flavors together nicely. Works great for chicken or beef. I make my own enchilada sauce. If you're looking for a good one try the recipe for creamy green chile sauce.

Yum! I can confidently say that these are the BEST enchiladas I have ever had. I honestly think these beat the ones normally served at restaurants! I followed this recipe exactly like it said, except adding Onion powder, since I didn't have any. From now on, I will always follow this recipe when it come to cooking enchiladas! These are so cheesy and delicious!

These were really, really good. I had never made enchiladas with the soup mixture in them, just chicken and cheese normally, so I was worried they would be runny...but don't skip the soup mixture! It gave a great texture to the enchiladas and kept the tortilla's moist. I used 10 tortillas, for 10 enchiladas. Not sure why the recipe says 5 tortillas for 8 servings. The seasonings and way the chicken mixture is prepared would be an excellent filling for tacos or burritos too. Great recipe Angela!

These are ok. I was not very fond of the soup/cream mixture. I will try again with some changes.

I have made this dish several times and every single time it's been fantastic.  I am not usually the chef of the house, but this is fairly easy to make, and out of this world good.  I follow the recipe exactly and it comes out great every time.

I had misplaced page two of this recipe where it stated to cook for 25 minutes or until bubbling and I had referred to the "Cook Time:  1 Hour".  So, I'm confused by this information.  Prep Time of 45 mins plus 25 minutes doesn't equal one hour. ??  Despite the fact that it didn't look real nice everyone raved about it.  It is labor intensive but worth the compliments!

Changed stuff around a bit, but am reviewing this because the basics, that being soup and sour cream in this recipe really made for something different and delicious. Added some extra seasonings and beans instead of chicken (for vegetarians), still gooey, cheezy and yummy.

Awesome recipe!  My boyfriend loved it as well.  Only change I made was to add some fresh cilantro in with the chicken mixture and on top.  Delish!    Rotisserie chicken definitely is a shortcut as well.

This was an excellent recipe.  I didn't need to change anything.  Instead of using a package taco seasoning I used the one from this website - Taco Seasoning I.  I just prefer making my own. This is probably one of the best recipes on this site.  My family absolutely loved it.

These are my favorite chicken enchiladas.  I make them exactly (except I make my own enchilada sauce instead of canned) as the recipe states.  This is definitely my boyfriend's favorite recipe.  There are several steps, so we make them together which is fun. The flavor of these is so great.  They are not traditional tasting, but the result is a satisfying enchilada.  Try them.

Amazing! My whole family loves these. I double the recipe for my big family but plenty big enough for some leftovers. I like to use smaller tortillas though. And I like to add some cumin and yellow and orange bell pepper. But other than that- it is a perfect recipe. Thank you!

Super delicious and oh so easy!  I loved that the "sauce" of sour cream and cream of chicken soup didn't end up tasting of only soup like many other recipes I've tried.  Next time I will have to double the recipe because I had some wanting seconds only to find there weren't any left!!  Fabulous dish that will make your guests think you slaved all day over it! Follow the recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed!!

Great recipe, only change I made was using spices instead of taco seasoning packet (we have to watch our salt intake).  I used 1 teaspoon cumin and 1 teaspoon chili powder in place of the seasoning packet.  Also use these spices to make tacos and they are just as good as the packet, if not better.

Nice and easy recipe. I used 2 cans of soup and a little extra sour cream.  I don't care for enchilada sauce so I used a can of tomato soup and mixed it with salsa. Everyone loved it.  You can also easily make this with beef (I used ground beef one time and steak another and grilled pork another). Just substitute cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken. I'm thinking of trying it with shrimp as well and maybe some cream of celery or the shrimp bisque soup. At any rate, it is easily adaptable and a crowd pleaser. I'm thinking it would be good with the reduced sodium soups since you have the taco seasoning in there too.

I was really surprised by this one.  I wasn't sure what to make of the cream of chicken soup/sour cream combo in the recipe, but it turned out really good.  Even my fiance loved it and said there is no need to go out to eat at Mexican restaurants anymore as these are better than anything they serve at our local restaurant.  So good.  It was time-consuming, but nothing too hard and it was definitely worth it.

these are fantastic everyone I have them for loved them.  I added a new twist by accident this time i was opening a can of black olives to slice for the topping and opened a can of refried bean by accident...so I slathered them on the tortillas and added the rest of the ingredients.  Hey presto a not bad addition to the dish.

AWESOME! I have tried way too many enchilada recipes, this is the only one I plan on using ever again.  To make it a little simpler I used a rotisserie chicken.  I think because rotisserie chickens are always so juicy it added a lot of moisture to the enchiladas!

You should never use flour tortillas for enchildadas...the mushiness cancelled out the flavor, which was decent, but far from 'awesome.'  Sorry.

Yummy!  Extra enchilda sauce is great, if you have it!  It's also fantastic if you can grill the chicken rather than boil it ad if you grill the tortillas a bit to make them sightly crisp just before filling them

These were great! Takes a lot of ingredients, but well worth the time and effort.

Just finished making these little lovelies and I must say they were quite good. I used green chilie sauce instead of red enchilada sauce but, next time I think I will try the red.  Would absolutely make again.

Awesome is right.  We used smaller size tortillas which made more serving and had plenty.  Also used Split Chicken Breasts because price was better.

The technique to these seem to have a lot of work that doesn't seem necessary. I didn't bother with heating the sour cream and soup mixture. And I didn't even bother with the whole sauteeing of the onion. I just stirred everything together with about 3 cups of cooked chicken and added a can of black beans. I only added about 1/4 cup of water. 1 cup seemed way too much for me.  I used low-fat or non-fat options on the sour cream, soup and cheese. These are more like a "wet burrito" to me. The flour tortilla makes them more like a burrito. As for the flavor, they were good but nothing out of this world, nor would I probably make them again.

These were ok, but not the best enchiladas I have made.  I feel for the effort and mess they made I would not be making this again.  I just have better recipes that taste more authentic.

Perfect! I saw the calorie count and modified the following items and it was just as delicious! I used non fat sour cream, low carb whole wheat tortillas, Campbells Healthy Choice reduced fat cream of chicken soup and Tillamooks reduced fat cheddar cheese.

WOW! This is amazing, and easy to make! There are only two of us, so we had leftovers... but they were gone the next day! He even said I needed to make them when we had people over, haha! I didn't cut the chicken into chunks (like another review had said) and shredding the chicken was easy. I left out the olives because I hate them. The only thing I wish I would have done was add a lot more cheese inside before wrapping them. This is really an AMAZING recipe :)

Made these last night and to say they were a hit would be an understatement. They were FABULOUS! I followed the recipe almost exactly (except had to substitute cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken and regular taco seasoning for mild as this was all I had on hand).  Also, I was extremely low on time, so I only simmered for a few minutes after adding the taco seasoning - just enough to thicken it up and just a minute after adding the lime juice and spices.  I really don't think you need to simmer this for 10 minutes and then again for 10 minutes.  I loved the shredded chicken, but if I'm low on time again, I'll probably just cube the chicken very small after cooking.  All of my kids devoured this!

This is an excellant recipe, the only thing I did different is to brown and simmer the chicken in a large skillet for a long time on a low temperature. While simmering I added paprika,crushed red pepper,cajun seasoning just to give simmering liquid a little flavor.

Delicious. Only change I made was to add some black beans to the chicken mixture and use about 1/2 can more of enchilada sauce.  It was, however, a bit time consuming and messy for a weeknight dinner.  I'll definitely make this again but on a weekend.

I've always been skeptical of enchiladas made with cream of chicken soup, but this recipe had so many good reviews, I decided to give it a try. Glad I did.  Outstanding!  Only 2 changes: used corn tortillas, quickly fried first, and used a larger can of enchilada sauce, because that's what I had on hand.  To those who say this recipe is labor intensive, I've not found a good enchilada recipe yet that doesn't take the better part of an afternoon to make; this recipe is well worth it.

These are the real deal. I made exactly as is, except omitted the black olives. Outstanding! I took another reviewer's advice and left the chicken whole while boiling - makes for easier shredding. These are a bit labor intensive but are worth it.

Unbelievably delicious!  Wow.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  It is time-consuming on the shredding chicken part, but, as you said, it's well worth it.  My gosh, I wouldn't change a darn thing with this recipe  :)

These are delicious!  I made them for my family and to take to another family and both loved them.  The other family asked for the recipe.  I did leave out the olives and green onions.  Very good recipe.

I made this recipe as-is, only using low-fat sour cream and healthy request cream of chicken soup.  And just 2 cups of cheddar instead of 2.  I thought it tasted very rich even with these substitutions.  Very tasty, although a bit too sour creamy for my palate.  People who like sour cream will really like this.  For those that don't, I would advise just using maybe half the sour cream, and mixing it with more enchilada sauce instead of the cream of chicken soup.  The chicken mixture was quite good I thought.  I also cooked this at 400 degrees instead of 350 and it browned up nicely on the top.

I made this recipe exactly as stated except for I omitted black olives and lime juice. I got so many compliments on it and it was delicious and easy to make. This is definitely a keeper!

Wow! These are great! I ommitted the olives because I don't like them. And I used reduced fat sour cream and "Mexican" shredded cheese (cheddar and jack cheeses) instead of just cheddar. I also used reduced sodium Cream of Chicken Soup. I found the final mixture to be a bit soupy but it tasted great!

My first time making enchiladas so I followed the recipe exactly (except using 8 smaller tortillas rather than the 5 12-inch tortillas).  I loved 'em!!  Served with Mexican Rice II, and No Fry Refried Beans (both of this site).  A nice way of celebrating Cinco de Mayo!  :)

Excellent!! Shana, make sure you simmer the meat mixture until it becomes rather dry because you'll be adding the soup mixture to moisten it. I left too much moisture in the chicken mixture, but it was still fantastic as written. I used a store bought cheap enchilada sauce. This really is one of the best recipes on this site!!!

Fabulous.  It's a lot of work to boil and shred the chicken.  Getting a ready made rotissiere chicken would work just fine.  I really liked the consistency of the filling, as well as the flavor.

This is as good as it gets for enchiladas.  We are a picky family and all of us loved this recipe.  The only change I made was adding black beans and not using black olives.  We also add extra green onion.  This is what I make if I am having guests for dinner, I just double the recipe and make 2 trays.

These were absolutely awesome!  I used no fat sour cream and low sodium soup to try to bring down the calorie count, used about 6 ounces of chopped green chilies, and used Bill Echols' taco seasoning mix from this site.  This was definitely worth the time to make!  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband isn't a big Mexican food fan but he LOVES this dish. I make this about twice a month / every two weeks. I do poach and shred my chicken in advance. It helps cut the time in half. Of course I do use low-fat sour cream and lite butter. I try to cut the fat down wherever I can.  I serve with Mexican rice and refried beans. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This recipe was pretty good- it doesn't taste like any enchiladas I've had a a restaurant, but all in all it was a recipe I would use again. I used Taco Seasoning 1 (recipe from allrecipes) instead of the taco seasoning packet, and for the sauce used reduced fat sour cream and cream of chicken. I also added a whole diced jalapeño into the shredded chicken.  Next time I will try using corn tortillas instead of flour.

This Recipe is quite amazing!  This dish is definitely deserving of the 5 stars.  I made a couple changes.  Used Fat Free Sour Cream and onions are not enjoyed in my family so used half of the "small onion" and didn't use the green onions.  To give the chicken a little more 'kick' i also added some mild taco sauce.  Great Dish - a definite do again!

Lives up to the name and the ratings.  I almost gave it 4 stars because I found it time consuming, but they're good enough to overlook the time investment.

Skipped the olives and added cilantro. I think I stuck to the recipe pretty closely otherwise. It's not a healthy meal, but it sure is delicious! Clean plates all around, even my 4-year old.

Exellent-- just a thought for weight watchers like me that love mexican---even lower fat and calorie version--- Use no salt or low fat cream of chicken soup Use 0% Greek yogurt instead of sour cream make your own taco seasoning use fresh garlic and onion rather than powder use fresh tomatoes rather than enchalada sauce 2% chedar cheese fresh chilies rather than canned serve with avocado slices I did this substitution but followed the recipe --- Everyone loved it---thank you!!

These enchiladas were very enjoyable.  I agree with people who have said that there are a lot of steps to this recipe.  In the future I will probably use corn tortillas vs. flour and look for ways to combine a few of the cooking methods in the recipe to cut down on prep time.  Overall a good recipe.

This recipe is simply great!  We never had enchiladas with the sauce on the bottom like this.  It has ruined going out to the Mexian place in town.  This recipe is as good or better than the enchiladas I have had in many resturants!  It was a little on the spicy side for me, but that's easy to fix!  Love this recipe!

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I did make a couple of adjustments due to my husband's poor grocery shopping abilities:  I used green chile enchilada sauce instead of red, and I also was forced to omit the green onion and green chilis...because he didn't bring them home.  I also added about a TB of Penzey's Chipotle spice to the sour cream mixture, in addition to the chili powder.  Next time I will try light sour cream and use less cheese to make it a tad healthier.  But, all in all, this recipe was AWESOME!!!

This was pretty good, but fairly time consuming.  It was a little too spicy for my kids, so I'd probably do something different next time.  Also, I mixed 1/2 of the soup mixture with the enchilada sauce and poured it over the top.  I liked it a lot that way.  :)

These were very good! My boyfriend loved them! He said they were better than the ones at the restaurant. I didn't have green onions, though. So I added more onion and a finger hot pepper.

These were DELICIOUS. We don't eat olives so I omitted those, and I also didn't have any green onions on hand...next time: ) After reading complaints of 'soupyness', I decided to cut down on the sour cream in the sauce mixture. I only used 3/4c. I also used only the thinnest layer of the sauce on the bottom of the dish.  It wasn't soupy at all. Will make this again and again. Thanks!!

Made these last night for a dinner party.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I thought the chicken mixture was a little runny when I added it to the tortillas but the consistency after cooking was awesome!  Everyone loved these and I will definitely make them again!

I cann't begin to tell you how awesome these are.  We all LOVED them.  Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the olives (we left them out)  My son said, "you can make these again".  Just the right amount of kick to them.  Only problem is....now I have heartburn.

followed this recipe to a "T", except here in denmark we don't have cream of anything - we have to make it from scratch - so I used a homemade cream of mushroom and everyone LOVED these enchiladas. creamy and rich it was a wonderful recipe and easy to cook! thanks!

Yum!  This was delicious.  My husband said there are not many Mexican foods with chicken that he likes but that he liked this and would enjoy having it again.  My 9 & 12 year old loved it, although they thought it might be a bit spicy.  It was very filling.  Because I was running short on time I didn’t make the side dishes that I normally would, but they were unneeded any way.  I even had 1 burrito left over for lunch, which should be really good.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are definitely AWESOME!! Restaurant quality... we loved these.  I used green enchilada sauce due to personal preference and omitted the green onions and olives.  I also used regular small tortillas and made 10 enchiladas which fit my 9x13 pan perfectly and actually had some filling leftover.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch!  Will definitely be making these often.

I made this for a family gathering.  I always get nervous when I'm making most of the food because there are a few people on my husband's side who are great cooks.  This was delicious.  I wasn't sure about the cream of chicken, but it worked.  The only thing I changed was that I used corn tortillas to make it more authentic.  I sprayed the corn tortillas and grilled them for several seconds on each side.  It really doesn't take that long and it's worth it.

I have made this 3 times.  I was shocked at how good it was - better than what you would get in a restaurant.  My family of 6 gobbled this up.  It's a keeper!  Shredding the chicken breast is a pain, but worth the effort!

Just made these. .The flavors are awesome! I used canned chicken breasts, shredded them added the ingredients and it came out really good. Just took a little while to put it together. Maybe because it was the first time. But will be definitely making these again.

This was surprisingly very tasty! The cream of chicken soup is not something I've had with enchiladas before, but I was impressed and am definitely saving this one! I didn't have taco seasoning on hand, but I seasoned the chicken with some cumin and other typical mexical seasonings. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Yummy!

Great chicken enchilada recipe, they're not even out of the oven yet and I can tell they will be awesome. Super soft and creamy. I added a can of sweet whole kernal corn for a little snap. Also used flour tortillas, I know I know, I was always against it too, should be corn tortillas naturaly, but my brother who is an executive chef insisted I try them once with flour and I have never gone back!  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

excellent recipe.  I used a suggestion from a previous review and cooked the chicken in the crockpot for 4 hours with chicken broth, taco seasoning and a bit of cumin.  To make the shredding easier and quicker, use your hand mixer, it is a breeze!  You need to make these!

A delicous and pretty easy chicken enchilada recipe.  I used boneless chicken breasts the first time, then used shredded chicken meat from a whole chicken that I had in the freezer the 2nd time (much quicker to have chicken already cooked and shredded).  I followed the recipe exactly as indicated, but I added an extra can of olives on top because my family loves olives!  We have added this recipe to the list of good 'ol standby recipes!

Healthy version (well, as healthy as it can be!):  Use the Ezeckial 4:16 6" tortillas.  Use 2 chicken breasts and 1-2 cans drained, rinsed black beans.  Use 2 cups of cheese.  To add more flavor so it is perfect: add 1 teaspoon cumin in step 1, 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder and some addional fresh garlic to step 1, and a 1/2 cup salsa to the chicken mixture in step 2.   Also, omit the green onions entirely (I did put them in there, but couldn't taste them or their texture at all).  I made 12 6" tortillas out of the full recipe.  I froze 5, and baked 7.  IT WAS SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOODDDD!!!! ENJOY!

Fantastic!  My husband swears he hates Mexican food, and yet he decided this was one of the best dishes I'd ever made.  This was wonderful.  I baked my chicken breasts for an hour in a little olive oil and then shredded them.  Also, I didn't use olives because the kids don't like them.  Otherwise, I loved all of it.  Well done!

The tortilla filling for this recipe is delicious, but I wish it had come with a sauce recipe rather than using canned enchilada sauce. I used a sauce recipe from foodnetwork.com that I ended up really disliking, but everything from this recipe was delicious!

i cant believe i havent reviewed this yet.  i made these about a year ago and they were incredible!  the leftovers didnt reheat very well so if your cooking for just 2 people. scale it down because it does make a lot.  but aside from that... great enchiladas!

Without a doubt, these are the BEST enchiladas I've ever had.  And trust me, I've eaten a few in my lifetime.  Since I like things "saucy" I did go a little heavy handed on the sauce portion and backed down the total number of enchiladas produced to get the consistency that I wanted.  These are every bit as good or better than something you'd get from an authentic Mexican restaurant.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I thought these were delicous!  I did the chicken breasts in the crockpot with some salsa, and cumin.  Then followed the recipe exactly except added some garlic in with the onions, and also added cumin in during the simmering.  My whole family loved them!  Made them with the Spanish Rice II recipe, and it was a great meal!

I made this tonight for dinner.  My husband said these are better than restaurant quality!  I used corn tortillas instead of flour.  Corn tend to crack a bit when you put the meat and cheese into them but once you add the enchilada sauce and cheese and toppings in the baking dish, it all blends together perfectly.  I would make this over and over again as well as serve it at a dinner party.  I bet you can make these ahead and throw them in the oven 45 minutes before serving.

This was absolutely wonderful!!!! I made the recipe as is...no changes, but trippled it due to the size of my family.  My husband and I kept looking at each other while we ate it saying how good it is!!!  I will definitely make this again and again.  It's a keeper...and I think I may try beef next time for a change.  Loved it!!!

I've never made enchiladas in my life. But this came out amazing! My guests raved. My DH said "what happened dinner is great"! Yes, time consuming recipe, but worth it. High calorie, but worth it. Only change was that I cooked the chicken in the crockpot.

These were really good.  I had some leftover chicken from the Simple Roast Chicken recipe on this site so I used that and I added one shredded boiled chicken breast- it probably wasn't quite 2lbs of meat, but I kept all of the other ingredient amounts the same and it worked fine.  I made a few modifications based on what I had in my pantry- instead of green chilies I used chopped jalapenos.  I didn't have the green onions or black olives so I omitted those and I added sliced jalapenos on top.  I also added about 1Tbsp of minced garlic to the chicken mixture when I added the garlic powder.  My husband and I both loved these.  They were quite a bit of trouble to fix, so I'll probably save them for special occasions when I have more time to cook, though.

The enchiladas were good but i felt it was too heavy on the salt. Next time i would use low sodium can cream of chicken. Besides that great recipe.

I thought these had a fantastic flavor but the middle of the enchiladas were so gooey and gross I couldn't eat it.  Maybe I'll try it again with corn tortillas which might stand up better to all the saucy stuff in the bottom of the pan and on top.  5 stars for taste, only 1 for texture, so I give 'em a 3 star average.

I made 5 servings just for my boyfriend and I, assuming we would just eat the leftovers for a couple of days, but he finished the entire platter in one night! I've never liked enchiladas very much, but THESE are amazing! Both of us agreed that this would be the only way we can eat enchiladas from now on. Next time, I think I'll omit the olives, and add more cheese. You can never go wrong with more cheese.

These were the best Enchiladas I've ever made!  I cooked and shredded the chicken the day before, so prep was very easy!  I also used green enchilada sauce instead of red as to not overwhelm the chicken.

This is the BEST enchilada recipe I have ever tasted!  I was craving Mexican food tonight and thought I would try this recipe, and my husband almost cried because it was so good! I didn't have any taco seasoning, so I used enchilada seasoning and it tasted fine.  My husband likes it better with the taco seasoning, but this will work in a pinch.  Awesome!!

Wow!  This is an awesome dish!  Thank you!  The only change I made was to cook the chicken and onions in the crockpot for several hours and then shred the chicken.  Upon replacing the chicken into the pot, i added the rest of the ingredients excluding the soup mixture and continued to simmer for several more hours.  I followed the rest of the recipe as is.  This will definately become a regular!!  :)

These were REALLY good.  Everyone raved about how they were the best they ever ate.  I deleted all other enchilada recipes since I will only be making these from now on.  Don't change a thing.  The only difference for me was that I used the smaller flour tortillas instead of the 12".  So I actually had 10.  Can't wait to make again.

These are so easy to make and they taste great!!! Didn't even change the recipe one bit which I do most of the time. I even made the enchilada sauce from scratch... I used the Ten Minute Enchilada sauce recipe which was great! Great recipe. Would definitely make again!

One way to save time on the chicken is to buy one of the pre-cooked roasted ones from grocery store and start with that.  It saved me lots of time and I was able to put it together for a Mexican night after work.  I couldn't find enchilada sauce in the store either, so used salsa as a substitute.  Probably changed the flavour by lots, but it was still fantastic!

Half way through the process of making these, I told my BF that these better be good...it takes awhile to make them.  They were fantastic.   I followed the directions exactly except didn't use the olives since neither of us like them.  BF said it was the best enchiladas he's every had, and we both love Mexican food. Highly recommended and will make again!

My family absolutely LOVED these... said they were the best enchilada's they've ever had, better than our favorite Mexican restaurant. I made it exactly as directed and served with rice and beans.  I thought it was delicious and worth the little extra time to prepare. It will definitely become a regular on our family menu! Thank You!

This was better than I expected, and guests loved it.  I didn't use the olives (don't like them) but otherwise followed the recipe.  It made 6 VERY large (burrito sized) enchiladas.

These are absolutely delicious! I crave them all the time.  I find it easy to use the canned chicken, it's really easy to just put it in a pan and shred it up with a spatula.  I also don't use the green chilies or black olives.  Other than that, everything is the same (although I never do measure out my cheese! :), so I prob do use more than that!)

These enchiladas were great! I had my Dad over for dinner and he liked them so much he took some home with him. The only thing I did different was I used chicken stock istead of the water. Thanks, this recipe is definately a keeper.

This was yummy, even my very picky MIL liked them!  I too left off the olives just because of personal preference.    I used the whole 2lbs of meat and there was enough chicken mixture to fill another 9x11 pan (approx. 5 more).  I made double the soup/sour cream/chili powder as a result.  We also put Spanish rice, black beans, lettuce, and tomato to the side.  This was enough to feed 4 adults and 3 kids with enough for 2 adults left over.

Sauce was a little runny and made them hard to fill.  But, the taste is good and hubby rated them high.   I made them just as the recipe said.

These were great!  One thing I did to help cut down time was to put my chicken into a food processer.  It shreds the chicken really fast and easily.

This recipe was AWESOME!!!!! I made this for my wife and she went nys about it. The only thing I changed was I used Chipolte taco seasoning instead of the regular taco seasoning. It gave it a nice smoking flavor and a little kick. Other than that is was real easy and really good.

My hubby and I agree..this is the best mexican I've ever made!  I am not normally a fan of made at home mexican (hubby loves it, however) but enchiladas just sounded good so I decided to give this a try.  Oh my gosh, completely fantastic!  I will definitely make this again and again (doubt hubby will let me forget about it!).  I did everything just as the recipe states..I did have trouble making all of the filling fit into 5 tortillas so it ended up more like a casserole than straight up enchiladas but we didn't care, it was too tasty!

Fantastic! Will definitely make again. Love the sauce (chicken soup and sour cream) that makes it! Didnt have enchilada sauce so I had to use mild taco sauce (airing on the side of caution of how much) Turned out just fine. Also, I didnt have the 12in tortilla's I think mine or 8-9in but, I thought they were perfect especially if your feeding little ones. I gave this 5stars.

My family is partial to the white/creamy type chicken enchiladas; so they were hesitant when I served these up. Thankfully everyone was pleased with them! I felt like the filling was a little soupier than I liked to work with and will be more careful about how much water I add next time. I doubled the recipe, used 9" flour tortillas and it made 15 large enchiladas. It served 8 adults perfectly. We served it with spicy guacamole on top and they were very good.

Just made these fantastic enchiladas! Best night ever: chicken enchiladas, king of queens and sauvignon blanc! This recipe is really great if you want to make something special for your guy, he loved these and almost ate the whole tray! Although be careful, the cooking time may be off. These would have been a bit better with more time in the oven.

These were good but extremely rich. Although the soup mixture made of cream of chicken, sour cream and chili power was tasty, it was also thick and too creamy. It was okay mixed in with the chicken and onions but only a little bit. It definitely didn't need the layer on the bottom of the baking dish. I will try these again but with only a touch of sauce.

Very good even with my changes so the recipe must be great written as is.  I omitted the lime juice (didn't have any) and added corn and black beans to the filling mixture (with the green chiles).  Then finished the recipe as written but with jalepeno and cilantro tortillas (they were what I had left) and it was very tasty.  I just looked at the calorie count though and now can't eat anything else for the rest of the day!!  A great recipe...does make quite a few messy dishes.

This is a great recipe.  I changed it a little bit.  I cooked and marinated the chicken in a homemade salsa for 24hrs.  I omitted the packaged taco seasoning.  I also used a mixture of cheeses.  Very good!

This recipe is time consuming but really good. My husband told me to save this recipe and pass it on down to our girls so they can cook it one day as well. It is one of his top 3 or 4 favorite things that I have ever cooked!!! Finallly,trying a new recipe paid off instead of being a disappointment!!

Although this is a time consuming recipe it was well worth the extra time and effort.  The flavor in the chicken was so good that I saved the left over filling to use in burritos.  My husband and 3 year old son ate them up!!

I normally never eat enchiladas.. but I really liked this recipe.  I used this recipe with the red enchilada sauce recipe and they were a huge hit, everyone LOVED them!  Even good as leftovers. I put the olives on the side and the whole can of green chiles in the chicken mixture.

SO good! The only thing I did differently was add a container of salsa to the sour cream/cr. of chicken soup mixture, and I used cayenne pepper instead of chili powder.. They were fantastic! Definitely my new favorite enchilada recipe! Thanks so much!

I marinated the chicken with salt, pepper, and fajita seasoning mix. Then sauteed the chicken until it was cooked. I added 1 can of cream of chicken, and 1 can of cream of mushroom. Only added half the can of green chiles because I wasn't sure how they tasted. I also added some of the sauce to the inside of the tortilla, along with a little cheese. The finished product was AMAZING! My fiance hates chicken but fell in love with this recipe! Thanks!!

I impressed myself with this one, followed to a T, except I didn't have chili powder so I used chipotle chile powder which gave this dish a nice smoky undertone. Very good, will make again!

I’m new to cooking and wanted to try something a bit more challenging than what I’ve been attempting. This seemed to be the recipe for me to try. It was really great and with the steps listed and video, I was able to prepare what came out looking (and tasting) like a Mexican restaurant entree. I highly recommend.

I love this recipe an make it as often as I think we can get away with eating it .  I have made it many times.  For those of you who don’t have the time to make this, may I suggest you buy an already roasted chicken at the store, and shred it, and take recipe from there.  This is really delicious.  It is definitely one of my favorite guilty pleasures.  Play with spices and Chilies to your families tastes.

Terrible.  Heats up even worse than terrible.  
What is interesting was how much work it took to make a terrible dish that was even more terrible heated.

These are seriously amazing enchiladas. My entire family devoured them.  I made the recipe as written, my only substitution was chicken thighs for chicken breast, as I feel they are more juicy and flavorful when cooked. I would not change anything if you're going to be making these. It's a great recipe. Thank you for submitting!

This was the best enchiladas I ever had. It takes a while, closer to two hours for me with poor planning, but absolutely worth it. We ended up with 7 enchiladas (10" tortillas) and made some rice/beans on the side. 1 enchilada was enough for everyone so I had leftovers!

Great recipe! If you cook the chicken in an instant pot with a cup of chicken broth, the chicken is way easier to shred.

Fantastic recipe. Prep time is long, but well worth it. I made it with gluten free wraps for a friend, and it was just as good. It's delicious the second day, but flour tortillas can get mushy on the bottom. I definitely recommend reheating in the oven for leftovers.

I made the recipe as stated, and everyone in the family enjoyed it. My only gripe, and thus 4 stars instead of 5, is the preparation time is too long! Next time, I will try what others recommended, and use the crockpot to shave off some time with the chicken at least.

Really good! To save on dirty dishes, I think next time I will use the pre cooked rotisserie chicken from Costco. I omitted the black olives because my wife doesn’t like them but everything else was per directions and they turned out phenomenal. Save to favorites and will def make again.

The seasonings and taste is PERFECT! Thank you for this delicious recipe...I would have put olives on top...which would have been awesome..but didn’t have any...also substituted softened cream cheese for the sour cream because I didn’t have that...but it was fantastic!

I followed this recipe verbatim and I got to say these were some of the best tasting enchiladas I’ve ever had.  Next time I may try using green enchilada sauce instead of the red sauce.  Either way, I absolutely loved this recipe.

This recipe is simply unbeatable for delicious Mexican food made at home—I’m not even a fan of enchiladas and never order them in a restaurant, but I love this dish!  So does everyone I have ever made it for. It does take a while to assemble, but is absolutely worth it. I make it as written, but I’ve found that if I double the sauce and chicken mixture parts, I end up with a enough final filling mixture that I can make 4-5 large enchiladas and save half of the filling and freeze it in a zip lock bag for another time. It’s then fairly quick to heat up a single batch of the sauce (soup, sour cream & chili powder), fill the tortillas with the thawed mixture and bake.

I have this recipe several times but this time I used the instapot to cook the chicken with taco seasoning and chili powder and about 1/2 cup of water. Then I followed the recipe as written. The chicken shredded easier then ever before.

We love Mexican dishes so this was a hit with my teenage boys. I will tweak it a little next time by adding only 1 cup of sour cream to the soup mixture. It was super rich. Since my boys don’t like olives I’d probably top with some diced tomatoes in place of olives. I also think you could get by without the soup in the bottom of the baking dish because that makes it a little too mushy for me. I had a couple extra tortillas and chicken mixture leftover so I made two more enchiladas and put them in another dish with some enchilada sauce on the bottom instead of the soup and I think they turned out better. Very good recipe even if you don’t change anything!

These enchiladas were great. Family said I could make them again. Instead of using green chilies I use rotel tomatoes since I had them on hand.

My family loved them!!  My daughter and son-in-law said they were the best enchiladas they've ever had!  I did make a few changes because I have some gluten free family members so I made my own cream of chicken soup and I used corn enchiladas instead of flour.

I’ve made this several times and it’s one of my favorite recipes. I typically use a rotisserie chicken to make shredding the chicken super easy and reduced cook time.

This was awesome! Made as directed and everyone loved it. Only problem was not being able to find enchilada sauce so I made some. Not sure if it tasted like it should as I have never had enchiladas before . Everyone enjoyed them so must have come close to the mark!

The best enchiladas I’ve ever had. Made exactly as is except used a rotisserie chicken from the store and shredded it. It was so good, better than any Mexican restaurant I’ve been to. Don’t believe the negative reviews I almost didn’t make this because of them. this is my go to enchilada recipe now.

I have made these a couple of times and finally tonight my husband said this was the best ever!   They key is in the seasoning.  We added cumin and and bit red pepper as we like spice.  Doubled the chili powder. Used can enchiladas sauce and corn tortillas.  Made the whole recipe and put half in the freezer.  Definitely a keeper!

Wow! Just wow!  These are the best enchiladas I have ever made or eaten.  The duo sauce - the bottom of the pan, and the enchilada sauce on top - really takes them up a notch and keeps them moist.

I have only made a handful of dishes from this site, however this is the first one I have left a review on. Mind you I am not a good cook in anyway shape or form! What I really liked about this recipe was the exact quantities. When I first started making this I thought I had way too many ingredients. However I had the exact amount. The taste on this recipe is genuinely excellent. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

This is a terrific recipe! Very delicious, and easy and fast with a few shortcuts. 1) Use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. 2)Rather than making individual rolled ènchiladas, layer the ingredients as a lasagne - 1/3 of the sauce, tortillas pieced to cover the bottom of the dish, 1/2 the chicken mixture, 1/3 of the cheese.  Repeat. Cover the top with a pieced layer of tortillas, spread with remaining sauce and then cheese. Other than the layering and rotisserie chicken, use and mix the ingredients in the recipe, and bake as directed. Great company meal served with Spanish rice, the Mexican Bean Salad, and Mexican Hot Chocolate Cookies (the last two from the site)!  Thank you, Angela!

An easier way to shred the chicken is with a hand mixer. It shreds the chicken in seconds

A bit time consuming, but otherwise a wonderful recipe! The only changes I will make next time is to lightly fry the tortillas so they don't turn out so mushy.

Defo make it again.  This time I would add some more colour like bell peppers and maybe some other veges.  This recipe was spot on for flavour though.

Very good!  Used 1/2 c salsa and 1/2 c water instead of all water and more dried spices than listed. 1/2 tsp isn't much.  Also added cumin along with the chili powder to the soup mixture.  My husband would like to try it with corn tortillas next time.

Delicious! I took the advice of others and used a crockpot to cook the chicken, but followed the recipe otherwise. I think these would be tasty as beef enchiladas, too.

I used corn tortillas as others did, and these were mushy and the texture was disgusting! The chicken mixture was good though.

The flavor was there, but mine came out dry.  I would make more of the soup mixture and use more sauce.  Way too many green onions.  I would use normal size tortillas next time too.  12" are too large.

The enchiladas were delicious!! My husband that doesn’t care for Mexican cuisine enjoyed it and my toddler loved it! I made a few unnecessary changes but did so for my own convenience and preference. I used a rotisserie chicken that I deboned and removed the skin that I slightly seasoned with season all then shredded. This gave me more than enough shredded chicken and allowed me to freeze the remainder for a later time. I also used the Mexican blends and Cheddar blends of shredded cheese instead of just plain cheddar. I eliminated the black olives. I also used just a hint of cinnamon in the chicken blend for a savory kick. Definitely give this recipe a try.

Family and Friends LOVE these enchiladas!  To speed up the process, I will occasionally use the pre-made whole chicken from the supermarket.  Rather than canned enchilada sauce, I use a recipe on this site and make it from scratch, also add a little chili powder to the taco seasoning.  So glad I found this recipe... I've been using it for years!

So happy for this recipe, Angela! My hubby went crazy for it! I just have one question about shredding the chicken - wouldn't it be easier with cooked chicken breasts? I found it quite tedious shredding cubed chicken, my hands cramped. lol.

Followed the recipe but used 9" soft taco flour tortillas (not 12" since unavailable and they would not fit in a 9" wide pan anyway) and green enchilada sauce. When using 9" tortillas, 6 fit in the 9" x 13" pan for me. One enchilada is very filling.  I love enchiladas and wanted to love this recipe but it was not great at all. Using corn tortillas would have probably worked way better. The flavor was okay but the recipe didn't need that much soup mixture at all, maybe half that amount could have worked.

I used rotisserie chicken as a time saver, but otherwise made the recipe as described.  It was easy to make, but took a little longer than I expected.  I found it to be flavorful, but overly salty.  I would make again only if I use reduced sodium options for many of the ingredients.

This dish was delicious.  Next time I will use green or red chili enchilada sauce instead of the cream of chicken soup.  I also used chicken thighs instead of the breasts.  The thighs are more tender and juicy than chicken breasts.  I never use the breasts anymore.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I like a little more spice so I added 1-7oz. can of Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce.  It gave it the kick I was hoping for and blended very well with the rest of the ingredients.  This is now my favorite enchilada recipe.

While assisting my daughter with her Mexican night meals we had some Enchilada sauce left over. So, I found this recipe and used the leftover sauce. This was easy to make and it turned out delicious. I loved it.

This was very good. No one could tell that there was a can of soup used in the recipe. I doubled chili power as recommended by others and added a little cumin; also cooked chicken in more taco seasoning. Still didn't have enough kick for the husband. Sour cream was a must have for a topping and fresh cilantro was nice. I didn't care for the slimy/slick texture of the flour tortillas. I may look for a recipe that uses corn.

This was very good and super filling. I did tweak it  little with more spices and I used green enchiladas  sauce.

This was tasty, but labour intensive and too “soupy” so it lacked the texture I was hoping for. Flour tortillas got soggy. I would omit the 1 cup of water entirely, and probably even the soup. Will try a different recipe and won’t bother with this one again as there are easier and better I’m sure.

I simplified it.  I cooked my chicken in a crockpot with chicken broth and taco seasoning.  I only used the cream of chicken and sour cream mix with chicken taco seasoning mixed together.  I added the cheese to the chicken/soup mixture.  I dippeed the tortillas in red sauce on both sides and then filled them with the chicken mixture.  My family loved it!

This recipe is SO WORTH MAKING!! My boyfriend said it was his favorite dish I’ve ever made. If you want it a little spicy, i recommend adding cayenne pepper to the chicken mixture. I added siracha and avocado on top. SO GOOD!

This recipe is deeeelicious!  Just one pretty major substitution:  We did not like flour tortillas, as they became soggy - just sub corn tortillas.  I also had to bake for a bit longer to dry them out a bit and melt the cheese.  I flash froze half of this and it reheats really well - thaw and bake until hot on 350F.

Needed a minor re-write to make sense.  Step 1 needs to be modified, add:  Save 1 cup of water used to boil chicken as broth.
Step 2. Combine cream of chicken soup, 1 cup of saved broth, sour cream, chili powder, simmer on low heat.  
If no liquid is added to that thick base of cream soup/sour cream, there will be thick lava bubble explosions.
A note on tortilla choices, white flour will have a slimy texture when done, due to gelatin effect.  Try corn tortillas that absorb liquid better, as an option.

This recipe is my family’s top 5 on this site. I add finely chopped Poblano pepper with the onion and we like fresh garlic over garlic powder. I also use chicken stock instead of water. I don’t know if any of my choices matters in the receipt. Thank you for sharing!

I have never made enchiladas before, but I certainly have eaten plenty in my lifetime.  But I had such a hankering for enchiladas the other night that I had to give it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used leftover rotisserie chicken and the smaller tortillas that I had on hand.  They were easy to make,  rich and delicious, and I will definitely make them again.

The recipe is tasty but I think there are better ones without using canned soup and some other pre-prepared ingredients.  The reason is: the sodium is too high for one serving.  It’s almost an entire day’s sodium allotment.

Delicious, hubby said best I have made . A little spicy for the grandkids I would probably back off the green chilis if you are preparing for children. I had lemon juice not lime and garlic salt  vs powder and both substitutions were fine..will keep this recipe! thanks! Five Stars!

Haven't made it yet, (although it's on my list) but I hear if you put larger pcs of hot chicken in a bowl you can shred nicely with Kitchenaid or electric hand mixer!
So save time and HAPPY SHREDDING!

Very good.  I added pureed san marzano tomatoes on top of the enchilada sauce and I feel like it made for a more lively flavor 

Note to self:  grease cooking tray before cooking.  And leave space between the enchiladas while cooking.

Thank you for this recipe!

We make this all the time in our house! It’s a family favorite! Sometimes I add some more cheese and I omit the olives ( personal taste).  Such an awesome recipe; definitely try it. You will not be disappointed :)

I know this was an amazing recipe because my children asked for seconds and even thirds. I miss read the ingredients and accidentally put an extra 1/4 cup of sour cream and followed others suggestions of using green enchilada sauce. Everything else was the same. Change nothing. Its amazing. This one is a keeper.

awesome only thing I did differently was I mixed a lot less of the soup mix in with the chicken. I used maybe 1/4 a cup instead of a cup.

Love this recipe. I substitute 1/2 of the chicken with zucchini and/or yellow squash. I put the squashes in with the butter a couple minutes before adding the onions. Also I skip shredding the chicken and just do staccato pulses with an immersion blender (not too much!). I just hate shredding with forks and have been pleased with the results!

Great! The only change I made was to garnish with jalapeños instead of olives. I also made the Easy Enchilada Sauce recipe instead of canned.

Have been making this recipe for about 5 years and we absolutely love it!  Since I do not like sour cream, I use chicken broth in its place.  Works amazingly terrific!  I also make my own cream of chicken soup and enchilada sauce.  Time consuming but SO worth it.  Thank you for this recipe,  it is greatly appreciated!??

What a great recipe!  I did it the lazy way and bought a rotisserie chicken and pulled it apart including the skin. Such a great flavor!  I make it all the time! I also use corn tortillas instead ??oh and I love olives!

I made this last night and it was delicious!  Next time I make this I'll cut the chicken into large pieces for easier shredding and more body. Also, by finishing it off in under the broiler for a minute or two makes the top crispy and just right! Overall, a really yummy recipe!!

Will definitely make this again.  I made a double batch because we have a big family.  Even the younger kids wanted seconds, but had no room.  Very filling but hit the spot.  Added some chopped jalapenos and some leftover black beans to the mixture.  I did cook the chicken in the Crockpot and seasoning all day, just easier to shred.  Then, added the cream of chicken mixture into it before loading up the tortillas! Will make this again and again.

I have been making Angela's awesome enchiladas now for the last 2 years and they always come out awesome! I usually don't make any changes but this time I substituted for chili powder for Sriracha hot sauce and it came out perfect. all my friends and family enjoy these enchiladas very very very very much. Thx AR

These were delicious! I couldn’t find enchilada sauce (maybe it has a different name in Canada?) so I put mango salsa on it instead, my kids loved it! I also added black beans to it as well since I didn’t have enough chicken and it was great added touch! Will make again for sure!

I did make a few changes; I only used half a pack of taco seasoning as we don't really care for it. I only added a 1/4 tsp of chili powder. I didn't have green onions. I didn't have any lime juice so I used lemon juice. My husband said it's one of the best dishes I've ever made!

These were the best enchiladas I ever made. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of not adding black olives. I loved the enchiladas out of the oven, but didn't care for the microwaved leftovers the next day. Next time I'll remember to warm up leftovers in the oven instead of microwaving them. Habits...

Made this recipe exactly as stated with two exceptions. One, i bought an already roasted chicken from the store instead of the boil method. A whole chicken was the perfect amount of meat needed. Two, i used Monterey Jack cheese instead of cheddar. These were to die for!

This is real "soul food" here in California and yes, I will definitely make this again.  I did make some changes and they are as follows:
Instead of 2 pounds of chicken breast, I used only one half of a whole chicken breast and I pre-cooked the frozen breast  in the Instant Pot with a cup and a half of water for 35 minutes.   Used Monterrey Jack as well as Cheddar cheese.   Used Hatch Green Chile Salsa in a jar instead of red enchilada sauce in a can.   Lastly, I used a recipe for taco seasoning mix that I make myself taken from a cookbook titled "The weeknight DINNER Cookbook" by Mary Younkin,  pg 158 called Mexican Seasoning Mix which I used by seasoning to taste.  My only regret is that I was only able to eat one enchilada.  Refrigerated the rest for later.  I had to talk myself out of over-eating on this one.  Made enough for 5 large enchiladas.

No changes other than not adding the black olives since my family doesn't care for them. These were incredible!!! Will be a staple in our house from now on.

I made this a few different ways for a large family gathering. Chicken & beef, corn & flour tortillas, and mild & spicy. For time I did layer / casseroles rather than rolling up individual. It got rave reviews and nobody could tell it was my first time making enchiladas!

OMG!  This is by far the best Chicken Enchiladas I have ever taste.  I can't tell you how many times I have made these.  Anytime I have a taste for enchiladas or my family, I come right back to this recipe.  Thank you again for sharing this delicious dish.

I made these trying the suggested slow cooker method (chicken stock, enchilada seasoning pk & diced onion). After work I shredded the meat only to find the flavor was lacking, so I followed the remainder of the directions to the T topping it w/10 minute enchilada sauce from this site (added a dash of cocoa powder). My family has a new favorite for the rotation.  For this being my first attempt at enchiladas.... I just WOW'd myself & the hub's :)  Thank You Angie!
Quick suggestion: dip the outer side of the shells (I used 6" corn) in the enchilada sauce quick and it won't tear when you're rolling it.

I used corn tortillas and fried/heated them a little bit before rolling them. Left the olives out. Good enchiladas.

This is the absolute best enchilada recipe! The only changes I've made is that I use a Costco roasted chicken in place of cooking a chicken. I also substitute a large can of green enchilada sauce and add 3/4 of it to the sour cream mixture (reserving the last 1/4 for topping). 
These enchiladas are mouth-watering delicious and  worth every calorie!

Followed to a T and was very disappointing. I should have known better as soon as I saw the directions to cut the chicken breast into chunks, boil, and THEN shred with 2 forks. Which is next to impossible by the way. Sour cream dominated, and it had a very cheap/microwave dinner taste to it.

Very good, but not fast. Made the chicken in the instant pot after marinating in some yummy Mexican spices. Shredded it. Still took an hour from start (sauteing the onions, once I added the chicken, I started the soup/sour cream) to finish. Somewhat intensive, but the flavors were great! Everyone liked it! Did use green enchilada sauce because I bought the wrong sized red one. The boys really liked it. Will make again, when there is time.

I've made this recipe twice now.  Delicious!  Everyone in my family ate it, even my kids (8 & 10) devoured it!  In fact both kids wanted to take it in their school lunches the next day!  A definite keeper!  It did take me a bit longer than I expected but I'll have to take note of where the process is taking longer and try to modify!  Highly recommended!  A+++++++

I made this last week for my family and I’m making it again tonight. I used corn tortillas and layered it like a casserole because I got frustrated with them tearing when I was trying to roll them. To shred chicken I always use my hand mixer in the crockpot. It makes things so much easier!

If you can’t decide between enchilada recipes, this is the one.  Everyone loved it and the recipe makes a good amount.  I picked up a rotisserie chicken and had my daughter pick it apart for me. The only other thing we changed is adding diced tomatoes with green chilis and used green sauce instead of the red.  Red sauce over powers the other flavors.  This will definitely be in our dinner rotation

This was awesome!!  I was super skeptical because Mexican food can be a hit or a miss, but after reading the reviews, I tried it.  It was fantastic!!  I cooked the chicken whole for easier shredding, and to maintain it’s moistness, I cooked it just shy of done in the boiling water. It cooks to temperature in the pan and oven. A little extra cheese on top

Well,  I'll definitely be making this again for the family!  My husband loved it and said it tasted like something from a restaurant.  I skipped some steps and just went straight to cooking the chicken in some water with the taco seasoning, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder and  onions.  Once I simmered for a while, I shredded my chicken and added back into the skillet.  Once done, I added the other ingredients following the directions from the recipe.  Paired this with the Mexican Rice 2 from this site.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe the whole family can enjoy!

This recipe was delicious! Instead of putting some of the enchilada mixture on the bottom of the pan, I put about 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and filled about 6 extra large tortillas with the mixture. I poured the rest of the enchilada sauce over the top and covered it with cheese. I didn’t have regular onion so I sautéed green onions and used olive oil vs butter. I added black beans to the soup mixture too and it was delish! I’ll definitely be making this recipe again!

this was the first time we've ever made homemade enchiladas, and this recipe was spot on &  so easy to follow! We added a side of Spanish rice and a dollop of sour cream, whalla! Perfect Weekend meal!

It didn't taste like enchiladas you get at a Mexican restaurant,  but  was still very good! My daughter just told me that she can't wait to have lunch tomorrow and I asked her "why? What's for lunch?" And she said "leftover dinner!!"  It was time consuming (enchiladas always are), but next time I'll plan ahead and do the crock pot idea mentioned in some other reviews.

In my neck of the woods, we call these wet burritos.  I actually just used some left-over turkey breast and went from there.  It turned out just fine.  Everybody in our household liked them; and, I was pleased to find another way to use up left-over turkey.

OK so i read a lot of other reviewers comments before making the dish. A lot of other reviewers complained that it was too soupy which didn't happen at all with me. Granted when i first made it i didn't like it all that much. I ate it but didn't like it that much. My wife wouldn't even eat it. The next day i went for leftovers and wow it had gotten much much better. I don't know how. You wouldn't think of enchiladas as a great leftover dish but was it was greatly improved. My wife tried it and like it also. Maybe when i first made it i didn't let it set long enough. I don't know but i definitely like it now

I've made this on two different occasions. Each time was a winner, never have any leftovers. The sauce is where it's at, made zero substitutions and never looked back. Highly recommend for a mid week meal or after a long day out and about.

Great flavor! First time I've made it and was more moist/soggy than I prefer. Next time I'll try half the soup mix.

This is correctly named AWESOME enchiladas. I put frozen chicken breasts in the slow cooker with the spices and approx 1 cup chicken broth. After shredding the chicken I added the rest of the ingredients. What a great dinner! Thanks for the AWESOME recipe!

I forgot the green onions as last step but it made the enchiladas easier for us to inhale.  I MAY have added some extra cheese Louise .   So dang good I made it for a new mom and her family too.

These enchiladas are a staple in our house. And they make fantastic leftovers as well. Sometimes I will dice a jalapeno in addition to the green chilies as we like spicy, but everything else is wonderful. One of my all time favorite things to make and eat!

This was very good!  To save time I cooked my chicken,  chopped onion and taco seasoning in the crock pot.  Just shredded it when I got home and continued with the recipe from there.   A keeper at our house!   Served  alongside of a bed of lettuce and added a dollop of guacamole on top.  Perfect and just as good as a restaurant.   I want to try this same recipe with ground beef next time instead of chicken.

I found these to be kind of bland. Also the quickest way to shred chicken is with an electric mixer. I will not be making these again.

These were very good!  I took someone else’s advice and make a casserole type meal instead of single enchiladas.  I also made mine with half green sauce and half red sauce because I couldn’t decide which to get.

Great recipe - I liked having the creamy soup, onion and chicken mixture inside made for a nice contrast to the enchilada sauce on the outside. 

To keep my corn tortillas from cracking, I heated them in a plastic bag in the microwave for 20 seconds, and then also heated them in a hot pan with oil for another 10 seconds per side, holding them in foil wrap until I was ready for them - perfect no breakage!

I have made these several times...they are so good!  It is a bit more labor intensive than I normally do (I am not a gourmet cook by any means and usually don’t have much time) but definitely worth it.  I do the chicken in the crockpot but other than followed it exactly and they are amazing!

To simplify things, I cooked the chicken in my instant pot and shredded it with a hand mixer.  Then I mixed sauteed onions and the seasonings in. Despite this, I thought this recipe was not worth the amount of work and dirty dishes.  While the taste of the chicken mixture was probably 4 stars, I've had similar filling that took less ingredients and effort.  I really disliked how soggy the soup/sour cream mixture made the enchiladas and found the texture of the final product somewhat revolting.  My husband thought it had 4 star flavor.

I baked my chicken, I marinated chicken in lemon and pepper from the master piece brand for thirty minutes and left some of the juice in the shredded chicken. Then I followed recipe and blew over twenty minds. They couldn’t believe I made it. Restaurant quality.

Let me say it was my first time ever making chicken enchilada. Be prepared that it will take some time to make. My kids especially my daughter who is a food critic absolutely love the enchilada. She is even trying to kidnappe my last enchilada lol. That is how much she loves it. Can’t wait to make this again.

We made this and stuck with the recipe (pretty much). The only changes we made were using green sauce instead of red enchilada sauce and I had run out of onion poweder so I used twice as much garlic powder (I love garlic).  These were perfection! My whole crew loved them (15,10 and 38). Everyone went back for seconds. Thanks for this crowd pleaser!

This is the Best enchilada recipe! I have made it so many times and turns out perfectly every time. I have also made this using shredded beef roast and cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken and cream of chicken. AMAZING!!

I have made these twice now. OH MY GOODNESS! They are so good! Especially with a layer of guacamole before serving. My boyfriend can’t seem to get enough! The other night I made a mistake and used mushroom soup. Honestly I didn’t tell a difference. But I also cooked the chicken with 2 chicken bullion cubes to give more of a chicken flavor in the meat. But I also I cut the liquids in half as I don’t like too much liquid on my Enchiladas. But over all it’s so good!

This was delicious!  I didn't make many changes, except, I do like more veggies in my enchiladas so, I added green peppers (diced finely), and mushrooms.  I used low fat sour cream.  Thanks for the great recipe, my family gobbled it all up!

Delicious! Made these exactly as written. The first few steps can be prepared ahead of time for a quick weeknight dinner. Then pop them into the oven cover with cheese and dinner in minutes. You could freeze these too.  I was not sure if my kids would like the enchilada sauce so I  left 3 enchiladas without sauce. We topped the enchiladas with avocado which was a perfect compliment to the spicy sauce.

We have a family member that does not like certain veggies so I did not use the black olives, green onion and chili peppers.  We like things spicy so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of chili powder versus 1/4 teaspoon as called for in the recipe.  I noted some saying the mixture was too 'soupy' so I was  very sparing with the fluids used.  Used the left over broth from cooking my fresh chicken breasts instead of water.  My family LOVED this.  Oh.My.God.  I had a 4 year old grandson and a 9 year old grandson cleaning their plates and asking for more!  I thought I might have some leftovers....  ummmm not really.  Just a little dab leftover just  enough for a snack.  This recipe was served alongside  Refried Beans and Mexican Rice topped with cheese.  EXCELLENT MEAL ! btw the pickiest family member (our adult son )who doesn't like pepper or onion type veggies gave me the best compliment....I got a 'mom you ARE going to make this again aren't you?

Very good just as it is and  would make a good base to adjust to you tastes. Very good as it is though. Def. a keeper.  Then next time I make this I'm going to roll it up like a burrito or egg roll, folding the edges, open ended like she did it I made a mess

I find it's more flavorful to roast 2 chickens at a time, I season them with thyme, garlic and onion in the cavity, we enjoy the chicken 1 night and use the rest to make the enchiladas and creamy chicken soup, much better results.

This had decent flavour but was a little too soggy for me. I also tasted the chicken soup way too much. If I make it again I might try a different brand or use less soup. It also took a long time to prepare.  Others suggested using the crock pot to save time so I might try that.

I followed one reviewers  suggestions by making the chicken in the crock pot and then combining everything into the crock pot. That cut down a lot on the time and was super easy to do. I don't think there would be much of a flavor difference doing it the way it is suggested in the recipe.

As far as the taste goes, I think these did taste a bit generic. Kind of like going to chain Mexican restaurant. They were good, but nothing I would rave about. The biggest disappoint was the tortillas. They were super mushy, kind of like raw dough.  If I tried this recipe again, I would probably try frying them like someone suggested.

These were amazing, I used hot taco seasoning and hot enchilada sauce because my family likes spicy. I also used corn tortillas, because we prefer them over flour ones, so I dipped them in hot oil to soften them first.  And I used a whole rotisserie chicken to save time. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  We have a favorite enchilada recipe already, but my daughter likes this one better.

I've tried a lot of enchilada recipes,  it they are never quite restaurant-quality good, until these. My husband really loves them and my picky kids ate them, too. I use my stand mixer with the paddle attachment to shred the chicken, it takes two minutes and it's a nice even shred.

My entire family loved this meal! I followed the ingredient list exactly. I did combine a few steps though- put 2 boneless chicken breast halves in the crockpot with a package of taco mix, the chopped onions, and chopped garlic. Shredded this after it was done and mixed it in with the sour cream/soup mixture. My recipe made 7 enchiladas. I will be making this again and again!

This recipe was easy and excellent.  I didn't boil my chicken, I had frozen chicken thighs that I threw in a crock pot with taco seasoning and salsa for 5 hours and then shredded it.  I did all of the rest in a single pot to save time.  4 out of 5 kids even ate it so I consider that a huge success!  Very easy and will make again.

My teenage son would eat these for every meal of every day! Typically, he hates having his food touch but these are his favorite meal! I cook the chicken, taco seasoning, water & all spices in the crockpot for 4-5 hours on low in the morning as a timesaver. When I get home from work, I shred the chicken and mix the remaining ingredients in the crockpot.  I probably use double the cheese but that's because we're a cheese-loving family! Other than adding the extra cheese and a tablespoon of ground cayenne pepper (because we're also a spice-loving family!), I use the same ingredients just prepared a little different for time. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made some changes...corn tortillas instead of flour, previous nights leftover grilled (hickory wood) chicken, Monterrey cheese instead of cheddar, and green enchilada sauce instead of red.  That said, I followed the directions made these minor changes to the ingredients and "voila"  good enchiladas.  Homemade Serrano pepper salsa for my kick. my dinner guests dipped in for seconds.  Will make this recipe again.  Thanks Angela!

I don't think 5 stars is enough.  I have made these so many times.  It is a household favorite.  I made them for my husband's 50th birthday...and had guests asking for the recipe.  I made them and froze them (before cooking) for my daughter when she had her baby.  That had her asking for the recipe.  She then made them for someone....more recipe requests.  You can play a little with the amounts of cheese,olives, peppers, and onions and such to taste.  We started putting a little more of the sauce on since my husband is a major sauce guy.   You won't go wrong with this recipe.

This was okay but nothing special. The enchiladas were slightly bitter from the sauce, could have used something to counterbalance that.

The skillet I was using was a bit too small for all the ingredients, next time I'd use a pot of some kind. Similarly, the baking sheet was too small to comfortably hold all my enchiladas. Next time I'd split them over two. 

I substituted onion powder for the onion, chopped olives for sliced (wouldn't do that one again) and used slightly more chicken. It's possible that somehow screwed up the flavor of the dish.

This is the best chicken enchilada recipe I've found to date.  I'm from TX, & grew up on Mexican food. Since we're huge fans of corn tortillas, I soften them in oil & used about 12, instead of the flour tortillas.  Also, I did not have any cream of ckn soup or red enchilada sauce in the house & made those from an internet recipe. Both were soooo much better (& super easy too) than the "store bought" versions, I'll never buy those products from the store again! Great recipe, Angela. You're the queen of ckn enchiladas.

This was pretty darn good! I added a 1/2 can of black beans and a 1/2 can of corn, but I'm sure it would still be good as-is. These are not the spicy enchiladas you are looking for.

These were great but I would make one suggestion and that is to lightly char the tortillas before you roll the enchiladas. It adds great flavor!

The only changes I made was to cook the chicken in broth instead of water, and because my family loves onion, I chopped one large onion. I also added a little more taco seasoning.  This is definitely a keeper. It was delicious.

As written, I think this is a very bland recipe~ and this coming from a girl that doesn't really like things hot. But I needed to add something to this, so once I added the Tapatio~ it turned out good. But as written~ bland and mushy.

I have made this recipe several times. I haven’t changed much other than I have smoked chicken and then used it for the enchiladas. Most amazing enchiladas ever. The smoked chicken adds such a deep flavor profile.

I have made these twice already because of how amazing they are. The last batch was for 12 people (made A LOT), half of them were shredded venison and the other half were chicken.  These make excellent left overs, if you can make enough. I fried my corn tortillas in oil before rolling and made my own enchilada sauce. I highly recommend this recipe.

A very heavy dish but delicious! Better than most restaurant enchiladas in my opinion! I substituted rotisserie chicken to save time and it worked well.

So there were a things I didn't have. Like the green onion, the sour cream, and the olives (which I hated anyways) I only used a lb of chicken because there was only two of us. Instead of the sour cream I used a splash of milk. When boiling the chicken (since I loathe boiled chicken in water) I threw in some bullion cubes to help with flavor. Added extra dashes of all the powders and even some cayenne for a kick. (Sorry, one of those people who edits along the way!) Made some rice with sazon in it, spooned some rice into the tortillas and it came out better than I thought. It was so good.

Outstanding AGAIN!  I prefer green sauce over red sauce. Just a preference.  The chicken soup sour cream mixture has made its way to other recipes it's so yummy. KUDOS

My family loved this recipe and couldn't get enough.  Next time I would follow another reviewers suggestion and prepare the chicken mixture in a crock pot so it will be quicker to prepare the tortillas (it has a lot of preparation steps) but other than that, this recipe is amazing!

Recipe was delicious, but made some minor changes. Used corn tortillas instead of flour, used a little olive oil and seared on both sides only for a few seconds on each side. Did not use soup mix so enchiladas weren't soupy and baked a little longer so enchilada filling could firm up a bit. Will definitely make again, a little more work than expected but using a rotisserie chicken really cut down on preparation and was perfect flavoring!!

It sounds good, but I haven't made it yet. I plan to this week. However, the nutritional info is way off. How can a recipe using FIVE tortillas serve 8 people?  Are you supposed to cut a portion off the end of each tortilla to make the extra 3 servings?

This was flavorful for the minimal amount of effort required. I made a few changes based on what I had off hand. It was a great use of the left overs from a roasted chicken I made two days ago. I didn't have sour cream so I used 1 C. Plain Yogurt and 1/4 c.  Milk as substitute. The consistency wasn't as thick but the flavor was good. The additional spices balanced nicely with the tang of the yogurt. I also used a 4 oz can of diced Tomatoes & Green Chiles. I like that I was able to play around with the recipe and it still came out great!

Omg we loved this recipe.  We can't leave recipes alone so we did change a couple of things.  I feel like they weren't critical to the integrity of the recipe.  Our changes were merely to taste and what was accessible, so I'm still rating this five stars.  

Our changes were to leave out the olives.  I swapped cheddar out and Monterray Jack in.  I also cooked my chicken in the crockpot ahead of time in one cup of water with onions and spices.  Once the chicken (half thighs half breast) was cooked, I drained the liquid and made homemade cream of chicken.  1tbsp butter, 1tbsp flour, 1 cup of reserved cooking liquid plus whatever extra for desired thickness.  No milk because there's already a cup and a quarter of sour cream.  It came together perfectly!

Really good recipe. These are some of the most fun recipes to alter. Instead of green chilies, I used the canned adobo chilies to add hot spice.  Thanks

These were amazing Enchiladas. I would cook the chicken in the crockpot to make it easier to shred and then I could add the onions, green chilies, taco mix and water and simmer a little longer. Other then that I wouldn't change a thing. Best part is I have lots of left overs for lunches.

I can honestly give this 5 stars because i have made it for 7 years now and its still amazing... i will say i have ALWAYS used a rotisserie chicken to shred for convenience. Just recently i started making half with green sauce and half with red. Both taste equally delicious. I will say they are like a tex mex version so almost the taste of a casserole but myself and family all prefer this over traditional enchiladas. I highly recommend you make these... a lot of ingredients and mess but totally worth it. Making them tonight!!

Yum, yum yum!!!
I followed this recipe to a T, with one small exception.  I didn't have any packaged taco seasoning on hand so attempted to fake my own with cumin, coriander and chili powder.  I also boiled whole chicken breasts in water seasoned with extra cumin, chili powder and lime juice before shredding the meat.
Super pleased with how these turned out and will definitely make these again!  My only (minor) complaint was that the flour tortillas were a tad bit gummy.  May try to crisp them a bit in a little bit of hot oil next time.  I also wouldn't mind a bit more red sauce but that's probably just me.
Thanks for sharing!

Excellent and a crowd pleaser!

I followed the recipe exactly with just just 2 small changes.  I substituted corn tortillas for flour.  I have made enchiladas the traditional way for many years and I don't like the "gummy" texture flour tortillas can get when baked in sauce. Just my personal taste/opinion. I also poached bone-in chicken breasts rather than boneless. Better flavor in my opinion :)
This isn't an "authentic" type of enchilada, but it's very tasty and the milder, creamier sauce appeals to those who may not like the traditional spicy "red sauce" enchiladas.  I make a big pan for company on "Football" Sundays and there are NEVER any leftovers!

Best enchiladas I've ever made. Unlike other enchiladas, they were not wet. When cooking, the "simmer" step should be "saute", because there is very little water at that point. If you don't keep stirring, the chicken will burn. This step puts a delicious brown on the shredded chicken and brings out the seasoning flavor. Very tasty!

Not a quick weekday meal, but so worth the work! Delicious. I made it exactly as is, except used Mexican cheddar Jack instead. Ate it with Spanish rice, black beans, and avocado. Even my 2 year old licked her plate clean.

Absolutely Delish!!  I added a 2nd package of taco seasoning mix to this because I wanted more of that flavor. I also used light sour cream & reduced fat cheddar cheese.  Then I used 100 cal white wraps to make it a little better for my diet.  It was so good & cheesy & creamy!

I made the Angela's Chicken Enchilada's last weekend & they were a rousing success.  Both my adult children & I loved them & I followed the recipe exactly as is my usual method with a new recipe.

I've made Mexican Dishes since my Air Force days in San Antonio, TX. "long ago" where I was taught by a lovely, very old Mexican Lady.  Neither of us spoke the others language but we found we did not find that a barrier.  I taught her to make several strictly Southern dishes---"Creamed Corn, Corn Bread, Biscuits, etc."  We had a  lovely relationship---soo, Angela's recipe is very good & my friend would enjoy it.

Thank you Angela!

I made the recipe as written except for recipes requiring cooked chicken I use the whole coooked chicken in the store.  The enchiladas were very creamy and flavorful. My family loved it.  I did add some spicy salsa to my serving because I like extra zip. The recipe served 7.  Three grown men and 4 women. It will be a family favorite.

I have made this  at least a half dozen times. Fast, easy, and so delicious.  The  family loves this and I often double the recipe so we can have leftovers for later.  Also, it's really good to freeze and bake when you are in a hurry and need a fast healthy meal.

Loved it .... The only change that I made was to prepare the  frozen chicken breast in a crock pot for a couple of hours. Prepared the rest according to the directions.

I omitted the green onions and olives. the store I picked up ingredients from has green chili enchilada sauce and red enchilada sauce. i didn't know which one this recipe called for, so I bought the green one (it featured a picture of a chicken enchilada on it, versus the red sauce had a beef enchilada on it).  Green tasted fine. This is a flavorful dish, worth making as is.

I have my own "famous" chicken enchilada recipe, so I rarely try any others. However, i decided to branch out and try this one since the reviews were great. I can say...the almost five-star rating was well-deserved. I followed the recipe to the "t" but will make one change for next time...next time I will add my enchilada sauce to the remaining soup/sour cream mixture and put some on the bottom of the pan and the rest covering the enchiladas. I think that will mellow out the enchilada sauce a little more. Overall, this is an awesome recipe I will be making again. My kids all loved it!

This is my go-to enchilada recipe. I always use green enchilada sauce and my DH asks for this meal frequently. My only suggestion would be to go with low sodium ingredients where possible because I always feel like it turns out really salty. Such a tasty make at home enchilada though!

This recipe is so easy and comes out perfect! I have tried so many different enchilada recipes. I followed the recipe as written with a few errors of my own. (Like adding the chili powder and onions to the cream of chicken mix.) This is a keeper and my search is over for the best enchilada recipe.
Thank you Angela!

This recipe was amazing!   I typically don't say that about most recipes, but this one definitely was.  The changes I made were putting everything in the slow cooker minus the cheese and sauce.  I don't have a stove top right now, so had to get creative.  I didn't use the chives and butter.  I used half and half of the mild and hot/spicy taco seasoning.  I used mozzarella with mild cheese.  I picked up the wrong enchilada sauce--used green instead of red.    I put the whole chicken breast with the mixture (chx soup, sour cream, water, spices, and seasoning).  My slow cooker had the chicken cooked in 2-3 hours on low and I shredded it and put on warm.  I followed the instructions--put the mixture on bottom with some cheese, wrapped the tortilla, topped with sauce, cheese, and olives. I did bake it at the instructions,  however, the last 10 min or so I broiled it at 350.  Probably won't do that again.  Don't think it made a difference.  I thought this recipe was excellent and loved it.  Can't wait to make it again!  This time with red sauce.

Great recipe! Everyone I have made these for love them! I do make homemade red enchilada sauce I found on another recipe here (10 minute enchilada sauce). I do use smaller white corn tortillas just as a personal preference. It takes a bit more time rolling them. But it's worth it in my opinion. If you choose to use corn tortillas, pop them in the microwave for about 30 seconds before rolling. They won't split this way. I also added a bit more taco seasoning. The filling is also great in quesadillas. Enjoy! Thank for the recipe!

I loved this recipe so much I decided to write my first review on this site! They didn't have chillies or cream chicken soup at my local supermarket, so I had to use jalapeños and cream mushroom soup instead, but other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out amazing! The perfect combination of spicy and flavourful. I will definitely be cooking this again!

This was delicious and easy! I hate to admit...I didn't follow the recipe, exactly. I made one simple adjustment...I cheated and used the "packaged rotisserie chicken" from a big warehouse store. It saved so much time.  Can't wait to make it again.

I made this recipe as is and it was really good, my wife loved it also.  I didn't care for reheating it for lunch the next day but my wife loved it.  I'm kinda picky on leftovers so not surprising I didn't like it.

I've used fresh and frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts and even canned shredded chicken and all have turned out amazing!  The recipe makes a lot leaving leftovers, which I think taste just as good cold or reheated.  My favorite part of the recipe is the sour cream/cream of chicken sauce.  Delicious!

I had all sorts of ingredient mishaps and this still turned out well.  My point is, it is such a good recipe, any modifications will work.  The spices are very good.

What a great recipe! If your on a time crunch just pull chicken off of a rotisserie and your good to go! Made this with green enchilada sauce as well and was wonderful. The whole family loves this and is definitely a staple in our house for sure!

I've been meaning to write a review for these enchiladas for a while now.  I absolutely LOVE them!  I constantly get request to make them, even from my finicky daughter.  I always make them exactly how the recipe is made, the only exception being (to save time) is buy a fully cooked rotisserie chicken at the grocery store and shred that.  Wonderful!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Oh my, this was excellent!  The only changes made was using a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles (because it was what I had on hand) instead of just the green chiles and used corn tortillas. Will definitely make this one again. Can't wait for my leftovers tomorrow.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I had chicken breast meat left over from a rotisserie chicken, so I didn't have 2 pounds.  I also crammed 10 enchiladas, not 5, into a 9" x 13" pan, and had plenty of filling for all of them. I took the dish to a potluck, and there was only a tiny bit left, so I'd say it was a hit! The only change I would make the next time I make this (and there WILL be a next time!) is to use a little more enchilada sauce over the top of the enchiladas. A 10 ounce can was not quite enough to cover all the tortillas.

I have been cooking for over 25 years and this will be my new favorite enchilada recipe. This is a delicious recipe you must try. I used a rotisserie chicken to save on time and it turned out fabulous. Doubled the most popular taco seasoning recipe from this website (which is the only one I ever use anymore) and used "Mexican enchilada sauce" recipe from food.com. I served it with Spanish rice. Wonderful recipe!

This recipe is fantastic. Only 1 change required. Use corn tortillas. The flour tortilla version of this ends up tasting like dough. It's a full hour of prep, but totally worth it.

I followed the recipe with a few variations - I used fresh serrano peppers and three choped tomatillos, which I added after I cooked the onions, following with chicken and HOT/SPICY Taco Seasoning, skipped onion powder and added fresh garlic instead of powder. Also added some chopped cilantro to the chicken mixture at the end!
Enchiladas turned out fantastic!

Loved this recipe. I'm in Europe and couldn't find canned chicken soup so I bought a knorr packet of dried cream of mushroom soup,, made the soup, then mixed it with the sour cream and continued the recipe as is.  It was a huge success (I made it for company) served it over rice and refried beans. Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe!  I must admit these enchiladas are more like wet burritos because they're much larger than your typical enchilada and it's not your grandmother's recipe.  Nonetheless, I recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to try it.  Enjoy!

VERY good. I made only a  slight change.
  Instead of using 1 cup of water, I used 1 cup of red enchilada sauce.
The other can of enchilada sauce that I used was green.
My whole family(husband and 2 children) loved these enchiladas!

Made as recipe instructed.  My family rated as "just ok".  One stated it was too rich and needed some fresh flavor a to perk it up.  I won't be making again.  May suit your tastes.

These are the best enchiladas I've ever had. I have to say they do take some time to make, but I love being in the kitchen. I will definitely make them again.
Has anybody made these ahead of time and froze the dish?

The cream of chicken/sour cream soup mashup is fantastic. My fiance had an extra serving! Wonderful recipe. We'll be saving this one for later.
Also, they heat up incredibly well in the microwave after being refrigerated. YUM!

I made this vegetarian by substituting beef crumbles for the shredded chicken and cream of potato soup instead of cream of chicken. I fry the beef crumbles with the onion then add other ingredients to simmer. Everyone i feed them to loves them, even meat eaters!

I made this for 80 people and everyone loved it. Since I was making so many I made half of them with flour tortillas and green verde sauce and the remainder with corn tortillas and red sauce. I greased the pan and did not put the sour cream mixture on the bottom of the pan because I didn't want them to be soggy on the bottom. Otherwise I made them as written and next time I'll use half of the sour cream mixture to add to chicken base. Forgot to mention that I bought Costco's cooked rotisserie chicken breast and add the ingredients the night before so the chicken could absorb the flavors. It was easy and very very good. The green chilies added some heat. The most time consuming part was shredding all that chicken, in my case 20 pounds in all. Will make again!

Honestly, this recipe is incredible. Over the past few years I've made it quite a few times. My husband ALWAYS asks for them. They are so delicious, and really worth all the time it takes to prepare them. I've always done the recipe by the book, so to speak, but tonight I am going to make them again with shredded chicken from a rotisserie store bought chicken. I think that it will save time, and will really still be incredibly tasty. Thank you so very much for giving us this recipe, you're a fantastic, over the top chef!

Best enchiladas we've ever had at home. We like them a little crispy, so I added most of the chicken soup mixture directly to the chicken vs the bottom of the pan. Also cut calories using plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. We love bold flavors as well and adter reading some of the other reviews in place of the water, I added a diced tomatoes with chili's, half a jar of salsa, and half of the enchilada sauce. So amazingly delicious!!!!!

My husband said "the best enchiladas you've ever made" so I'm happy!!  I shredded a rotisserie chicken plus 2 breasts from the deli counter. I doubled the chili powder but could have added more. A little time consuming but so worth it!

I've made this dish dozens of times.  It's one of my family's favorite meals.  I've played with the recipe quite a bit over the years and crank up the spice a little bit by adding a few chipotle peppers, chopped up fine, and added with the chili's.  A few peppers go a long way so don't over due it!  I also add a generous dose of chili powder to the cream of chicken/sour cream mixture.

I slow cooked the chicken in the crock pot and used, Taco Seasoning I, instead of the store bought seasoning. That seasoning recipe is excellent because you can really control how much heat/flavor you want to add. That might help the folks who felt this was a little bland. Loved it and will make it again.

These were BY FAR the best enchiladas I've ever had. I made it for a crowd, and they all felt the same way. It takes a lot of steps to make it, but every last one is worth it. I am now demanded to make these at least once a week!

Love love love this recipe! I had leftover queso in the fridge, so I added it to the skillet with the chicken mixture. Also, I added verde sauce to the cream of chicken soup mixture and didn't use red sauce. Wonderful!!! Thanks Angela!

Very good, everyone in my family liked it. I seasoned the breasts with taco seasoning and grilled them, let them cool and then shredded them. Just can't bring myself to boil chicken.

MOST FLAVORFUL enchiladas we've ever had! Just tweaked a tiny bit to ensure meat was flavorful based on other reviews. Sprinkled some of the taco mix, a little chili powder (still added the normal chili power the recipe called for - this was just a little extra to coat the breasts), salt, and pepper on each side of chicken breast. Browned them in a pat of butter, deglazed pan with water. Added this liquid to the chicken breasts, cover w/ foil, and put in oven at 350 to finish cooking while preparing the rest of the recipe. After I shredded the meat, added what the recipe called for plus 1/2 tsp. cumin. Instead of water, used 1/2 c. of the liquid from chicken breasts and 1/2 c. salsa to add to shredded chicken. Meat was sensationally seasoned and NOT bland. Great flavors!!

I stumbled upon this recipe about a year ago and have made it at least a dozen times. I can't begin to tell you how much I love this recipe. My entire family loves it, even those that don't like Mexican food. I've tried different variations over the past year but kind of always follow the recipe as it always turns out good. Kudos to Angela!

I loved the use of the cream of chicken and sour cream i wasnt sure at first because ive never made it that way but i wil be adopting this method from now on.  I did make my own enchilada sauce as well as added in cilantro with the lime and garlic and onion. This was a wonderful recipe even as  is.

I don't think I have ever rated a recipe on this site, however, this one deserves a five start rating.  It is beyond fantastic!  I will definitely be making this again.  Not sure what some of the other reviewers were saying about it being too cheesy or soupy.  It was restaurant-quality flavor.  I made the recipe exactly how the author wrote it and it was FABULOUS!  Definitely give this recipe a try.  I made no substitutions or changes, and I am so glad I didn't.  I used Mission brand tortillas and Ortega brand mild enchilada sauce and taco seasoning.  I did not use the Healthy Request cream of chicken soup, just the regular Campbell's cream of chicken soup.  It said it was already low in fat.  The recipe does take some time, but it is worth it.  Well done Angela on these Awesome enchiladas!

So good! Like another reviewer said, this makes a LOT! The one thing I wish I would have done is not put any of the sour cream/soup mix on the bottom. It was a bit too goopy for my tastes. But other than that, 5 stars.

Boy oh boy were these good! Followed recipe exactly. Bottom of tortillas came out a little soft but I think that's just because I let the mix cool instead of adding it to the bottom of the pan while it was hot as the recipe stated. Really fantastic! Will have this again soon.

I made these for my boyfriend the other day and he loved them! It really is all about the seasoning. And they are huge since the recipe calls for a 12" tortilla! They're delicious!

Followed exactly but not crazy about the results. There were too many competing flavors. I like enchilada recipes that use fewer ingredients and corn tortillas.

I used 1.5 pounds of chicken and cut the recipe in half.  I added some mild Rotel to the chicken mixture.  I didn't use the enchilada red sauce on half and used the soup mixture instead. That half reminded my husband of his favorite dish at Chi Chi's except that he thought the enchilada  sauce was made with cream of mushroom instead. .. I'm going to try that next time. The whole family loved this. This is definitely a keeper to put in our rotation.

The flavor is fantastic, worth all the work. The tortillas were mushy at the bottom when I served them. Is there anything I can do to prevent that? I will definitely make these again.

I loved this recipe. Only reason why I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because I felt the taco seasoning was a lil much and strong although my husband and daughter loved it and said it was perfect.

This was AMAZING.  Followed another reviewer's suggestion and cooked the chicken in the crock pot with spices and vegetables-- only took a couple of hours to cook on high.  We omitted the black olives and used enchilada verde sauce instead.  We also topped it off with some homemade salsa-- DELICIOUS!

I loved these! I substituted for the cream of chicken soup with the following: 3 Tbsp. butter, melted in small saucepan; whisk in 1 Tbsp. flour, 1/2 cup chicken broth, and 1/2 cup milk. They turned out delicious!

These were Awesome!  I made half GF with corn tortillas and half not with flour.  We will definitely use this recipe again.  A nice mix between white and red enchiladas.  To get a jump on making this you can boil the chicken earlier in the day then drain the water and put the whole chicken breasts directly in your kitchen aid mixer with the paddle attachment.  Turn it on and the chicken will shred on its own! Big time saver!

OMG This was amazing!! I have 2 picky eaters in my family..one who only eats chicken in 2 dishes, and one with autism who is VERY selective about his food choices! It's very rare that I cook something that everyone LOVES or even likes for that matter lol. Everyone LOVED this dish!!! I read the other reviews an took a few tips to make it a bit less time consuming and it turned it great! I added cumin, skipped the butter and onions, prepared it casserole style to cut down on start to finish time, and added colby/monterey jack cheese on top (just cause we LOVE cheese!!!)

I've made this recipe many times over the last couple of years. I never substitute anything, it is perfect 'as is'. I usually serve it with rice and beans, and there are plenty of leftovers for later.

This was outstanding.
I couldn't find enchilada sauce so I made my own.
Other than that, I loved every bit of this recipe.
It wasn't difficult and it was a huge crowd pleaser. So incredibly satisfying. Thank you so much for sharing.

With any recipe you tweak it. So I made some adjustments. I have been making enchiladas for years and just wanted to go off something a little different than what I normally do. So with that said, I always use enchilada sauce, but never put sour cream in it. I did that this time.   I must say I do like the look of the sauce and the fact that I simmered it for at least 30 minutes before putting everything together added more flavor to the meat.

This recipe was AMAZING!!! Everything comes together so perfectly! I pan seared the chicken instead of boiling, and used corn tortillas instead of flour. I had to make it ahead, so I did everything except bake them and refrigerated for four hours first. Then at dinner time I baked them for the 25 min at 350 and they were PERFECT! Love this recipe, will make again and again!

Very Good..  Making shredded chicken is a must, just don't boil or overcook the meat or it will be tough.  I followed the recipe as is except I don't use canned soup.  Just put 1/2 tbs. of flour and 1 tbs. butter in the pan until melted then add 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup of milk or half and half and simmer until thick.  I don't care for enchilada sauce so I just use salsa on top.. My kids said the leftovers were even better reheated the next day.  Thank you..

This was a great recipe made exactly as written (except I cheated and used rotisserie chicken).  I would like give it 4-1/2 stars.  It's definitely a keeper and I will make it again.  The only thing that I will change next time is to place less of the soup mixture on the bottom of the 9x13 dish.  It made the flour tortillas a little too soggy for our personal taste.  Other than that, I would make no changes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe. I make it for myself during the Christmas season every year and enjoy it with a glass of Baileys mixed with milk. (My husband doesn't like it, so it's my treat to myself.) ;)

My whole family loved these, and we will be making them again!  The only change I made was to add a Tbs of lime juice instead of a tsp, and I made homemade soup instead of canned.

Made this last evening and it was AWESOME!! I used 1 heaping tbsp of chili powder and added s&p. I couldn't find enchilada sauce in the store so I bought a corn and bean salsa...it was amazing!! My husband and son loved this...will most definitely make this again and again. Thanks so much for the recipe:)

These are very good. I used one reviewers advise and substituted the water for salsa and quite enjoyed the flavor.  Also, used corn tortillas instead of flour for a more traditional dish.

Took a little time but it was worth it!! To add a little spice I used a can of hot green chiles and spicy taco seasoning, I also added a little cumin. Only thing I would do different is maybe lightly fry the tortillas to keep from getting so soggy during cooking.

My family thought this was pretty good. I think it needs more spice, I added cumin. Next time I'll up the spices. Also next time I'll make a white sauce then add the sour cream and chili powder. I think the canned soup makes it lame. Finally I'll use corn tortilla next time, because some parts  of the flour tortillas were a little soggy.

I doubled everything to make 10 and I just put this together to make later - going to put on the enchilada sauce last minute so doesn't get soggy but have to say I had to spoon out 2 cups of liquid fromt he chicken before adding the sour cream mixture because it was so watery...and even then it was watery...the flavor is great tho - will update later after baking

4 stars as written, since I think this would be much too bland for us, 5 stars with a few tweeks to amp up the flavor and heat.  I assembled this a day in advance, and sent it with my husband and BIL for their guys' weekend.  Hubby mentioned that BIL declared them the best enchiladas he'd ever had. You can't argue with that.  My changes:

Use 1 small can of HOT green chiles, plus 3/4 can of chopped (or 1 fresh) jalapenos.  Used approx 12oz of enchilada sauce.  I also added 3 garlic cloves, 2 tsps cumin to the sauce and doubled the chili powder.  Cut the cheese to about 2 cups.  I used small ~5" corn tortillas that I seared in a dry pan over high heat (worried about them getting soggy due to the advance assembly).  Serve with additional sour cream and salsa.

I finely chopped vacuum-packed rotisserie chicken breast pieces from the warehouse store because I had some, but would like to try the crockpot method next time.  Shredding meat is quicker than chopping...

The filling made about 20 5" corn tortillas.

This was delicious!  I wanted this for a week-night dinner and decided to make a couple of changes.  Rather than cooking my own chicken breast, I got a Costco roast chicken and just chopped the breast and leg meat from that to use.  I realized I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of celery (which sounds weird, but  was actually good).  Also used fat free sour cream, whole wheat reduced fat tortillas, and reduced fat cheddar cheese, only using 2 C of cheese rather than 3 to try and reduce calories.  My kids and husband are picky, but they all really liked it.  I will definitely make this again.

This was an excellent recipe! Normally I look at the ingredients and time it takes to make something before I start.  Well, I noticed I had all the ingredients and got excited and totally forgot to check the prep/cook time.  It is accurate.  It took forever. But WORTH it.  I didn't have a can of cream of chicken so I made my own (EASY: 1Tbsp butter, 3Tbsp flour, 1/2C milk, 1/2C chicken broth) and I substituted the sour cream with plain greek yogurt. Also no olives because I seriously dislike olives. Family LOVED this and I will be making it again in the future. :) :) :) :)

I had mixed feelings on these. I put the chicken in the slow cooker, like some reviewers recommend, and that turned out great! The sour cream-cream of chicken soup mixture was unappetizing though. I wouldn't use that combination again.

My family's favorite dinner i make. Also i cheat and skip a step buying rotisserie chicken and shredding it. Tonight i bought green and red sauce and made them half red half green and it was awesome, i might just make with green sauce or mix the 2 since the red is so in your face flavor and my kids are 8 and 2 and don't like anything my husband and i do. If you think this recipe has too much going on and isn't worth the trouble let me tell you JUST DO IT! You won't be disappointed. The first time i made these i had no sour cream and substituted cream cheese... sounds weird but it was still good. These enchiladas are for sure a 5 star.

Made this recipe according to the directions, except as others suggested I made it in casserole form. It was very good but next time I think I will warm up the tortillas in a pan first, as they were a bit mushy.  I used flour tortillas. Maybe corn tortillas would hold up better in this preparation. Also, I used low-fat sour cream, healthy request chicken soup and skipped the butter.  This did not affect the taste at all.

I made this tonight. It was very delicious. However, I think next time I will try to crockpot way of doing it because it sure took a long time to do everything. All in all, the recipe was simple, just a lot of steps. I will definitely make it again though.

I was super excited to try this after reading all the reviews even though my husband wanted the ones I usually make.  the flavors were great however using the flour tortillas was not a hit in our house they become soggy and gummy.  I'm going to try again but next time I'll use corn tortillas

loved this!! I did a few things differently, but not that much. and only because I didn't have everything on hand. I cooked the chicken and spices in the slow cooker. Didn't have green onions, so didn't add them. Used corn instead of flour tortillas.  Other than that, did not change anything. Loved this!

These were gooooood! We had with a side of white rice. 
The shredding of the chicken was a little time consuming. I used tenders (bc they were cheaper than the whole breast)...I think the bigger the piece, the easier to shred. I tried the chicken mix before adding the liquid mixture and found it tasted a tad bland so adding just a little more onion & garlic powder. LUV the black olives! I'll definitely make again, just not after work.

This is my 3rd time making this and its is really good.  My family eats it up.  I actually used my slow cooker can cooked my chicken whole in the slow cooker then shred it.  When the recipe asked for water I used the water that I boiled the chicken it.  I do add more Red Enchilada Sauce.   Other than that everything is exactly the same.  I have to 4x  this recipe for my huge family.

Made this for company the other night and we cleaned the pan! Followed instructions to the T except made my own enchilada sauce with the "10 minute enchilada sauce" recipe from this site, used whole wheat tortillas, and got 8-9 filled. Stuffed my 13x9 perfectly. Made mine ahead of time but stopped at filling them & placing in pan, let them chill in the fridge. When ready to bake I preheated oven, let them sit at room temp, topped with sauce & cheese just before baking. Served with spanish brown rice. Will definitely make these again!

Best enchiladas I've ever made. I add taco seasoning to the cream of chicken (to taste). I make it on a regular, it's my daughters favorite dish. I would definitely recommend this recipe!

These enchiladas were delicious. My company raved that these were the best enchiladas they'd ever tasted. I used corn tortillas that I'd fried in oil first so they wouldn't break. Yummo.

These are delicious, and got rave reviews from my partner, as well as the play date group I took them to the next day. I used green enchilada sauce.  Like others, I saved time, and dirty dishes, by using a crock pot to cook the chicken with onion and spices. Then I accidentally put all of the ingredients together, oops, so I had to strain the chicken back out to fill the tortillas with. Still delicious!

Prepared the meat a little differently - put the chicken in a crock  pot with a jar of salsa and a package of taco seasoning.  Shredded the meat, and put in the fridge to set overnight.  Meat was great.  Added the green chilies to the  soup/sour cream mix.   My main concern was that the taste of the chicken was overpowered by the soup mixture.  Otherwise, it was a success at my party.

This is a delicious recipe! I didn't change much but whenever I need shredded chicken, I cook it in the crockpot. A small amount of chicken broth and a little taco seasoning on low for 4 hours and it shreds super easy. When I made the cream of chicken/sour cream mixture, I added more chili powder and a little salt to flavor. I didn't add the full 1 cup of mixture to the chicken to make sure it wasn't too soupy as other reviewers advised. I also used chicken broth instead of water to simmer the filling for more flavor and added a little garlic to the onion for flavor. The flavor was awesome and I highly recommend!

Delicious! A bit time consuming, but tasty.  I boiled my chicken breasts whole and then shredded them. Much easier than trying to shred small pieces.  I didn't have green chilis on hand and only had chipotle taco mix.  Still turned out great!

To avoid cooking the chicken, buy a rotisserie chicken from your locale grocer.  That really makes this dish quick and easy to prepare and very good!

great recipe!  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I roasted leg quarters in the oven and deboned.   i also doubled the amount of the sour cream mixture as well as adding a couple teaspoons is cumin to the chicken mixture.  I substituted green enchilada sauce for the red.  These enchiladas were a huge hit with my family.  This recipe is a keeper even if you tweak it some.

These are the best enchiladas I've ever had! I've used this recipe multiple times and it's one of my husband's favorite meals. I also made them for a potluck at work and they were a huge hit! I live in San Antonio, tx where there's a lot of Hispanics who make enchiladas regularly and there's a lot of Mexican restaurants but I've never had enchiladas like this. Amazing. Didn't change a thing in the recipe.

Not too bad, a little too much olives, in my opinion, but otherwise pretty tasty.

I have made this recipe for a couple of years & when I asked my family what they wanted to eat for dinner this Christmas Eve they all responded "the enchiladas!!" It may take a little longer then most want to spend on a meal but it is worth it!! I tweak the cook times here and there and it still works out perfectly!

A nice, easy, basic enchilada! Big hit with my teens. I think next time I will up the spices a little bit, but the basic flavor is very good. Good consistency as well (sometimes these get soupy, but this did not). 

NB: The posted prep/cooking times are WAY off!!! Prep took about 90 minutes (not 45), cooks for 25 minutes (not 60).

This recipe was absolutely fantastic!! I cooked the chicken breasts whole to make for easier shredding, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It was oh-so-easy, inexpensive, and raved about by everyone. We're adding this to our regular recipe rotation! I'm excited to try it with green enchilada sauce next time, although I can't imagine it getting any more delicious!

Delicious! Made it lasagna-style with layered corn tortillas because they were cracking and it was taking too long to heat them. I will try this in the crockpot next time because it was a rather time consuming process.

This is very good. Although I did make a few tweaks. I didn't use all the left over soup in for the bottom of the pan. I just used enough of it to coat the bottom so they didn't stick. I also added adobo seasoning into the mixture to add some more flavor. I also used fresh garlic I sautéed it with my onions. And also I fried the tortillas before I filled them. It was very good. I will make it again!

This recipe, even though it took some time to prep it and get it all ready to cook with all the different steps, it was really good.  Even my kids liked it :).  My husband  liked it more than the usual enchilada recipe I've always used that he loved.  The only thing I did was left the chicken whole while cooking as it made it easier to shred.  Otherwise I followed it word for word and it was delicious.

I love these enchiladas! I’ve made them probably 15 times, and they’re always a huge success! I usually boil a whole chicken instead of using only chicken breast. I also make a double or triple batch of the filling and freeze, which makes it super quick and easy for weeknights to just defrost the filling and make some enchiladas real quick! I usually use corn tortillas and green sauce. Yum!

My husband tackled this recipe. He recommends using a food processor(shred) for the chicken. We didn't have lime juice, so we used lemon juice. It came out so good! Will be making this over and over in the future!

This will knock your socks off!! I've never made non-traditional Mexican enchiladas with flour tortillas. I used the usual corn tortillas. I tried to follow this recipe to the T so I didn't fry the tortillas in oil first. That should definitely make a difference next time since they seemed to dry out a bit. Adding extra enchilada sauce while baking helped to keep them moist. ;)

I've made these a few times for my family and they loved it!  Unfortunately, I can't make them that often due to the high carb count because my husband is diabetic.  Other than changing out the flour tortillas to a low carb version, is there anything else that can be done to lower the carb count?

This recipe is a definite crowd pleaser. It makes a lot and I was afraid he leftovers wouldn't keep well, but was I wrong! My boyfriend and i had meals for the entire week. I also added the chicken to the crock pot with garlic and onion powder, chili powder, the onion, taco seasoning, and water. I put it in the crock pot in the morning and when everyone was hungry (which varies at my house) I could assemble and get them on the table quickly.

I made the all day version in the slow cooker for the chicken but followed the rest of this to the T, WOW what a great dinner my whole family loved it and asked for more, I will proudly make this recipe again. Thank you all for the comments and tips to make all these recipes better or a tad easier to make after work and MomsavedbyGrace should get a culinary medal for this one.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it turned out delicious. Everyone in the family loved them and my wife's aunt, who was visiting, said that they were the best enchiladas that she had ever had and demanded the recipe. You'll definitely like this easy, tasty recipe.

First of all read through numerous reviews and through my own experience with cooking i decided to use chicken breasts (2lb) and I put the chicken (sometimes I even use frozen-solid breasts or thighs) in a crockpot with the taco seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, chopped onion + a 1/4 cup water. Then the chicken is easily shredded (as usual crock pot meats mmmm) and I add 1/2 tsp cumin and two fair sized organic fresh garlic cloves with Med chopped onion and half cup med salsa and hint of extra fresh squeezed lime juice of one lime (other then required in recipe) 4hrs in. Let simmer on low for 6 hours and check to see if not overdone (not dry). filling rest of ingredients to the crock pot and stir it up. Then I just assemble per the directions. Lightly toasted (flour) tortillas before wrapping them and poppng in oven to prevent to soft shells. Topped with shredded cheese and green onions and sour cream.

Great recipe. Very TexMex. Some changes and suggestions: I didn't have green chiles, so I substituted a jalapeno (no seeds - sauteed with onions) and about 6 or 7 tablespoons of tomatillo sauce. I also subbed 4-cheese shredded mixture for Cheddar. Really, really nice results. BUT. It was really too rich for our tastes. Next time I will cut the soup and sour cream mixture in half and only use it in the blended meat (not on the bottom of the pan -- use enchilada sauce instead). I'm going to use the blended recipe for tacos or burritos soon. Excellent recipe. Thanks, Angela.

Loved these! Our new family favorite and there's even enough for my family of 6!!! 
To easily shred the chicken, drop it in your stand mixer after cooking and turn it on low. In a few minutes, it will be done!!!

This was my first time making enchiladas, and I did my own spin on both the original recipe and the changes that other people made and this was THE BEST DISH it was universally loved by both my family AND my co-workers (I brought some in for them and they LOVED IT!) I will be making this again!

Over all its not a bad tasting recipe. I read a lot of the reviews and try as I may to limit the liquids it still came out like a casserole. I tried both corn and flour tortillas, corn is the way to go. Instead of water I used the  reserved stock from boiling the chicken.  1/2 the sour cream and 1/2 the condensed soup. After chopping and boiling the chicken using your fingers to break up the chicken is faster. I don't think I would make this again too time consuming for what you ge.

I made this recipe with not previous experience in the Enchilada department at all. They turned out great. Took some time but it was worth it. This enchiladas are massive, but very rich in flavor.

This recipe is GREAT! My family loved it!! I followed the directions exact except I added extra cheese (you can NEVER have too much cheese!) and I used lemon juice instead of lime bc I didn't have lemon on hand. At first, when I first saw this recipe I was a bit overwhelmed bc I am not exactly a Betty Crocker! BUT, I surprised myself because it ended up fabulous! I will definitely be making again in the future!

I didn't have lime juice but otherwise, made this as the recipe stated (I DID use leftover chicken off the grill).  EXCELLENT!  Thanks! This is now my go to recipe for all chicken leftovers.

These were awesome! I added a little extra water during the simmering because I was afraid they would dry out but it wasn't necessary at all, would have been better off sticking with the recommended amount

These were very tasty, but I messed up the whole kitchen making them. I did a few things differently but since I used bone in chick breasts it would have been nice to do that the day before.  I also used the broth from the chicken instead of the water in the recipe.  I also used my own enchilada sauce recipe because I wasn't sure of a good brand.  We don't have the one some reviewers mentioned.  After eating these, you won't be hungry for a long time!!

Yes.  It was delicious.  I tweeked the recipe a little bit by adding my enchilada sauce into the cream of mushroom and sour cream to give it a little more flavor.  five stars.

I'll give this a 2 star because I liked the filling.  The rest was just tortilla goo.  5 tortillas?  More like 2 pans of 9x13.  Fortunately, there was a lot of filling left over for another try.  I don't have any soup mixture left so I will roll the filling and bake without the enchilada sauce for 20 minutes and then add the enchilada sauce and cheese and bake for another 5 or so.  I'll let you know how that works out.

Since this is what I had on hand, I used a mix of pepper jack cheese with cheddar, and not the full amount.  I started with a rotisserie chicken from Costco, skinned and removed bones.  Shredded the chicken with a HAND MIXER :-)  I'm gluten intolerant so I used corn tortillas and GF cream of chicken soup.  This is a keeper and would be a crowd pleaser.

I actually haven't made this recipe yet, but I've made very similar.  Ditto Jen - chicken in crock pot practically shreds itself.  I usually dump a small jar of salsa in the pot (love salsa Verde.)  No need for the taco seasoning because the salsa flavor comes through beautifully and you are greatly cutting sodium.  Season to taste after it's cooked. Fresh cilantro would make it so fresh and bold tasting.  I mince a whole bunch of out, stems and all, and stir in at the end of cooking time.

This recipe is amazing. I hardly need to leave this review as it seems most everyone agrees. I made it a week ago as per directions above, and my family loved it--and that includes a VERY picky seven-year-old who normally won't eat anything I make without loss of privileges. While I might make a few changes here and there depending on what's available locally seasonally (green onions, addition of other veggies, etc.) at some point, the recipe was great as stands. Worth the effort!

Save yourself the time and shred a rotisserie chicken. My only criticism is that the green onions inside the enchiladas were odd. I would omit these and just sprinkle on top. Maybe if I had simmered the chicken mixture on the stove for the full 20 minutes they'd have been softer, but I felt that timing was wayy too long. Otherwise, great dish! 

Healthy(ish) changes: whole wheat tortillas, low sodium taco seasoning, fat free cream of chicken soup, light sour cream, and reduced fat cheese.

I made this and it was delicious.   I used green chili enchilada sauce instead of red, but that was the only variation I made.  Will definitely make it again!!!  Only complaint I had was that it seemed a little salty, not sure how to tone that down since I didn't add salt.  (it wouldn't let me upload a photo or I'd show you!)

I made this dish a couple nights ago and absolutely loved it! I used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas for a better flavor and I sprinkled some Cayenne over the enchiladas before putting the cheese on to give it some kick. I would also keep the chicken breasts whole to boil before shredding, as it took FOREVER to shred when it had been cubed. Very yummy and will definitely be making this again!

AWESOME and OUTSTANDING enchiladas.  Followed the recipe with following minor modifications:  diced 2 chipotle peppers in adobe and added to soup/sour cream mix.  At about 1,700 mg these enchiladas are almost a entire days worth of sodium.  I made my own spice mix instead of taco seasoning pack and reduced cheese to 2 cups.  Next time I intend to spray the bottom of pan with cooking spray.  The soup/sour cream mix did not keep the enchiladas from sticking and this will result in further sodium reduction.  This recipe will be enjoyed for a long time.  Thanks for sharing.

Hubby & I made these last Sunday, and they were fantastic!  Easy to make but a bit time consuming.  Hubby says that now we know what we're doing; we can speed things up next time.  Wish I had a large food processor to help with the shredding of the chicken.  However it was so worth the time.  Next time I'll add the 3 cups of cheese insted of 2 cups.  This will be a regular at our home.  Thanks Angela!

These were very good!! I did have to make few changes because I cooked the chicken in the crockpot and didn't have sour cream but still very good!! I have to say though, I usually just cook chicken, wrap the chicken and cheese in tortillas and then pour canned enchilada sauce underneath and on top, top with cheese and bake and I think they are just as good so I probably won't put the work into these again :)

Super super delicious! I've made a close version to this in the past but will definitely be making this one from now on. My family loved it. I also agree with Previous Commentators on the "negative Nancy" who posted about how we should all be eating... please, I'm pretty certain we are grown ups and can figure it out for ourselves! Go preach elsewhere.

I really liked this - it was a change from my usual recipe.  As always there are always changes!  I would leave out the water - and I added the enchilada sauce to the soup mixture. I also used a rotisserie chicken, which always saves on time.  I too used reduced fat sour cream and cheese.  I did use regular soup but you could certainly use the reduced fat there too.  Enjoy!

Love these!  Made with gluten free tortillas ( brown rice, and corn). I like a little spice, so next time I think I'll chop up some jalapeño and toss them in the chicken.

I used corn tortillas, much, much better.  Flour tortillas get slimy and chewy (ugh), corn tortillas hold up just fine.  Good recipe, will make again.  Thanks!

Excellant! I loved using the flour tortillas, I always use corn in mine. I used my salad choppers to make fast work of shredding the chicken! It was ready in no time at all! Thanks for this recipe!

Good but I did not boil my meat because you lose so much flavor.  Braising leaves the flavor in the pan where you can deglaze it back into the meal.  Remember, this is going to be baked too.

First time I've ever made enchiladas and I will definitely make these again!!!! My husband said they were better than the restaurant ones. I used leftover chicken that I shredded from a whole chicken I made earlier in the week. For the sake of time I skipped the sautéed onions and they were still delish!!!!!!

Although a bit time consuming, this was truly a 5 star recipe.  I made 2 changes, one by mistake.  I used Swanson Tortilla stock to cook the chicken, saving the stock and used it instead of water later in the process (added a nice layer of flavor).  I added green enchilada sauce (by mistake), but loved the dish.  Next time I will use red enchilada and see what happens.

Outstanding!  Made this for Sunday football playoffs... Everyone loved it.  My only changes were Mexican shredded cheese, more lime juice in chicken mixture, and added jalapeño peppers when building enchiladas.  Served with nachos and tortilla soup for a complete dinner.

Made it just as printed. Did not think it had much flavor - just a little heat. And it really turned out mushy.

Loved this recipe! I cut it in half since I didn't have enough chicken. I used the full recipe amt of chili powder instead of half. Instead of green chilis I used jalapeños, approx 8 oz. I also added about 4 oz of jalapeño juice and about 2 tlbs of Taco Bell mild sauce. This recipe is sooo good! I'll never eat enchiladas at a restraunt again!

Great recipe. Quality ingredients will equate to great flavor. Only thing you may want to consider is the enchilada sauce. Mild to hot option. I used medium and for most it wasn't to hot; but for one (my wife) she loved the flavors, not the heat. Will use this recipe again and again! Thanks MomSavedByGrace.

Very good. I added 1 can drained Rotel to chicken mixture. Like the suggestion of another of cooking chicken during the day in the crock pot and assembling from the crock pot chicken. I used more chili powder and cumin and added some salt and pepper. Also used 2 cans Enchilada sauce on top.

I made the chicken/soup mixture in the crockpot first, like one reviewer suggested. Then I used a slotted spoon to fill the enchiladas. I finished them in the oven. Very easy and tasted like restaurant enchiladas. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I thought I made the best enchiladas, but I was wrong, Angela yours is by far better than mine...which I been making for years. My Mom who passed on 2yrs ago taught me how to make hers, I know if she tried yours she would throw the towel in and say...you win. Thank you Angela, you have been blessed

I followed this recipe exactly with one exception, I used corn instead of flour tortillas. It was great! I do not cook a lot and usually select recipes with minimal ingredients however this one looked similar to grandma's enchiladas growing up. These were all that and then some!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe and I will be making these again!

I have made this several times and everyone always loves it! It is time consuming though, but worth it in the end. Some have said that you should use corn tortillas, however my family does not like the corn tortillas, and prefer the flour...so this recipe is just right the way it is! I say use whatever type tortilla you like, but definitely give this recipe a try!

Made exactly as is! This is ridiculously delish.   13,10, and 7 year old all loved it! We managed to get 8 medium tortillas out of this recipe. Makes a lot and can't even taste the fact there was a can of cream of chicken in it. Will add cumin next time. Already told a bunch of friends about it. Thank you so much for this recipe.  Will make this when preparing a dish to take to a family in need of a great dinner!  Thanks again.

The flavors are good but it gets way too gooey on the bottom. The flour tortillas become gummie and it's not appetizing. I'd try it again with corn tortillas and see how it goes. Maybe even leave off the soup layer on bottom of dish.

This recipe was just ok. It was easy to make, but wasn't that tasty. I think next time I try to make this recipe, I will adjust a few things. For starters, I would change the tortillas to corn. With the flour tortillas, it taste too doughy. And I would also roll the tortilla in the enchilada sauce before stuffing them. Just trying to enhance the enchilada taste. Other than that, it's a good recipe.

I've been searching for a good enchilada recipe and have definitely found it!  These enchiladas are fabulous - they definitely take more work with the two different sauces and especially if you decide to do both beef and chicken.  BUT - totally worth it, the finished product is outstanding - for both ground beef and chicken!  Also, I added some cumin to the sauce after reading some other reviews - definitely made it taste more authentic (even though I can't believe there is cream of chicken soup in this).  MUST TRY!!

I was skeptical will all the work and time involved, but the end result was amazing. I do not like breast meat, so I used skinless, boneless thighs, covered with water added a little chunk of onion and some celery for a wonderful flavor. This recipe has been saved in my recipe box, for sure.

I love this easy enchilada recipe and my family does too!  I make it a smidge easier by cooking the chicken in my crockpot during the day with another package of mild taco seasoning and water.  Knocks about 20 minutes off the prep time!  Superb~

Followed this recipe as stated, however, I did not put soup mixture in the bottom on the on before heating in the o oven. I thought the enchiladas would have a Weird texture. Didn't care for this meal. Will not be making again.

Oh wow! These are just great! But... 2 lbs of chicken for 5 enchiladas?! I was able to make 2 13x9 pans of enchiladas... gave one to the in-laws. You MUST do the chicken, onion, chilies, and seasonings in the crock pot.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I loved this. I replaced the pre-prepared canned foods on the list with fresh ingredients.  (peppers and enchilada sauce) It turned out fabulous.  My kids tell me this enchilada recipe is better than eating out as a fancy restaurant.   This one stays on my weekly list. Thanks for sharing this great recipe on All Recipes.

Put in 'Change Servings' to 4, since it is just the Husband and myself.  All ingredients I halved, but the green chilies, figured the whole can wouldn't hurt.  Kept the same amount of flour tortillas too, oh and left out the olives (H ain't a big fan of those).  Anyway the Husband LOVE THIS!  So did I!  He said put this one into the rotation.  Gave him leftovers for lunch, it will be interesting if he thought they were better the next day.  A little time consuming, but well worth it!

Cooked last night for guests and everyone raved about it. I baked my chicken instead of boiling to seal in the flavor and it was really easy. Thanks for the Excellent recipe. This is a keeper for me.

We loved this recipe! We made it as a layered casserole and it turned out great! It reheated extremely well, too. Prep time was lengthy the first time but experience with the recipe will improve that. Will definitely save this recipe and add it to our regular rotation. Definitely a winner!

Wow, what a great recipe!!  Will definitely make again!! I tried to follow it exactly, except my grocery store only had 10" flour tortillas, lite sour cream, and low-sodium cream of chicken condensed soup.  I also added a second can of red enchilada sauce and only used a 3 oz can of sliced olives. This created 6 enchiladas instead of 5 and I had a handful of filling left over (that I ended up not using). It still tasted amazing!! I also had to cook the soup mixture over medium heat at first, as it refused to simmer on low heat. The whole recipe took me 2 hours... definitely not spending that much time again!  I plan to put the onion, half of the scallions, chicken (whole breasts), taco seasoning, onion/garlic powder, and just enough water to cover the chicken in the crockpot for 5+ hours, and then shred it and stir in chilies and lime juice as another reviewer suggested.  All other steps will be the same. I will re-review after I try it that way, but I am pretty confident that it will simplify things a lot!  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

This is the best enchilada recipe ever!  So easy and tasty.  I used the "Quick Enchilada Sauce" recipe also on AR, and that made it even better.  It was a little time consuming but so simple.  Thanks for sharing it. --kajaco

This is really good!  I've made them twice now and my family and roommate love them.  I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and cooked the chicken in the crockpot with the taco spices.  The only other thing I changed was adding more taco seasoning to the chicken.  I usually like mild seasoning, but without the extra seasoning it tasted a bit bland.  I also added 3-4 drops of tabasco sauce. To save prep time, I think next time I'll cook and shred the chicken ahead of time.  The second time I prepared them, I used leftover chicken from the first batch I made, which I had freezed.  It was much faster then to make up the second batch later.

Not bad but for me it just took a bit long to make and get all the ingredients together and working. I have a similar recipe for empenada filling but it is much easier ti put together so I will probably try to use that to make enchiladas next time.
Having said all that, the flavors were pretty good together and I would encourage you to make the recipe as is and see for yourself.

these were good the first time we made them with a mixture of beef and chicken, but kind of weird with the two meats.  Not so great the second time with chicken only.  I don't know what to say lol.

By the time you cook the chicken, mix something too it, cook again, add to it and cook again, the chicken is like mush!  Flavor is average.  Would not make again.  Might be better with different brands of ingredients.

Angela, these enchiladas most certainly are AWESOME!!  The only thing I did differently was to steam the chicken in about 1.5 C. chicken boullion.  Definitely a keeper!!  Thanks so much for sharing!!

Tried these last night and made them exactly as written. Based on the amount of prep time to flavor ratio I'm not sure I would make these again.  They were tasty but not enough to warrant all the work.  If I could find a way to make it easier, I'd make them again.

First of all my name is Angela so I had to try this haha.  I mostly followed the directions heres what I did: cooked 4 chicken breasts in slow cooker with a can of cream of mushroom and taco seasoning packet ahead of time, which shredded like butter (see my epic mex ckn recipe ;). Then simmered container of sour cream/lo sodium cream mushroom soup/chili powder in small saucepan. In big skillet I sauteed the onions, then added in the chicken along with 2 cans chiles (will use jalapenos next time), cilantro, green onion, lime juice, onion powder/garlic powder/cumin powder, and a cup of the sour cream mixture.  I got 6" corn tortillas bc they were on sale. To soften them, sprayed both sides of each with pam, then microwave like 6 at a time for 40sec with a damp paper towel on top. That way they dont crack when you roll them up.  Filled about 13 of them with the chicken mixture and cheese, then once they were in the pan I topped with enchilada sauce, more shredded cheese, and black olives. Tasted awesome, next time I'm going to leave off the black olives, use jalapenos and cool ranch doritos as the top layer.

I made these for the family for the Rosebowl game and we were so disappointed. The chili powder just didn't taste right and the seasonings were way off. Would not ever make again.

Very good!  I use store roasted chicken and sometimes use different soup like maybe cheddar cheese in place of the mushroom.  Staying in the rotation for sure.

I did it just like the recipe called for. Time consuming but Loved it. Brought it to a Party and most were asking me for the recipe. Try an (optional) side topping of 2 cups of sour cream, one pack of dry ranch seasoning and one jar of drained mount olive Jalapeno's (finely chopped) and mixed up. Was sooo good!  Thanks!

Turned out great! I couldn't find canned green chilies at the little grocery store here, but half a can of Rotel worked out great! I had too much filing left over, but it taste so good that I'll just heat it up and serve with tortilla chips (my husbands idea!). This is a new fav!

This is the BEST enchilada recipe I have found!  I happened upon it one day and decided to try it, and haven't used another recipe since.  My husband is not a fan of Mexican food like I am, but he requests this recipe! It's a hit with the whole family, which isn't easy with 6 kids.  I highly recommend this recipe. I actually use pulled pork instead of chicken, b/c my mom cans it and gives me jars of it...and it's great!

Fantastic!!! We like to put the leftover chicken mixture on tortilla chips and make nachos. By the way, substitute the fresh chicken you have to shred yourself for canned chicken that shreds naturally and it is a lot easier!!! With all the other fresh flavors, you can't really tell the difference. A true favorite at home!

Love this recipe!  I've also made it using a beef pot roast I made the night before in the pressure cooker, used cream of celery soup with the beef instead of the cream of chicken soup, and added a can of black beans to the meat mixture.  Either way, these have always been a hit!  I'm making these for my family for Christmas dinner this year!  We usually do something more non-traditional, so these will be fabulous!

Who needs Mexican restaurants when you have this recipe?  The most time consuming part was shredding the chicken, but it was well worth it.  DELICIOUS!

Love, love, love this recipe!  Easy to make (though a bit time consuming) and always a crowd pleaser! It's been my go-to for a couple years now and my guests are always impressed. Who doesn't love a casual Mexican dinner? Pair this with some Spanish rice,  beans (I like to prepare both refried & black), and a case of Coronas & you're good to go! To save time, I make the filling the night before then just stuff the tortillas , cover w cheese, etc.. & throw them in the oven & 1/2 hr later - fiesta time!! Enjoy!

Love love love this recipe! It takes a while to make though so be prepared. Some of the other comments suggested pre cooked chicken which I think I'll try next time. But still the flavor of these is outstanding! My friends love enchilada night!

Our absolute favorite  The only changes I make are to cook the chicken in the crockpot in chicken broth and with taco seasoning (other reviews suggested this), and then shred it with my mixer. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  A family favorite and great for company.

Loved the recipe!  It took a lot longer for me to make than I anticipated but it has a great flavor.  I actually made it a little different in order to freeze it.  I mixed all the sauce together and put it inside the enchilla and put the toppings on.  I then wrapped each one individually in foil and then in a zip lock bag for the freezer.  I then can take out as many as I want and either microwave it or bake it for 40 mintutes from frozen or defrost and bake for 25 mintutes.  Turned out great!  I will definetely make this recipe again.

The ONLY reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because of the tortilla choice. If serving immediatly then flour works well but if you plan to reheat or serve in an hour or so the flour tortilla can get a little mushy.

This was an awesome recipe and the first one that I've rated. I seasoned my chicken with fajita seasoning and a little of the taco seasoning and browned it before boiling. That added a LOT of flavr to the chicken. Thanks for the recipe.....my friends loved it as well!!!!

I tasted these...made 9-25-12 right before leaving for Dallas to leave for the fam to heat up the next night when I would be out of town.  Made from cooked leftover chicken.  Made my own enchilada sauce from the Ten Minute Enchilada sauce recipe on this site.  Very good!  
Didn't have green onions or black olives but those would have been a good addition.  Cut this recipe in half but still used 5 eight inch flour tortillas and it was plenty for 2-3 people

I was looking for a new enchilada recipe and this one hit the spot.  I thought the mix of ingredients was intriguing and I was correct.  The texture is creamy and SUPER delicious with a lot of great flavor.  Yum!

I love these!! They are very good. I use corn tortillas instead of flour. It takes about 8-10 of those. I warm them in a skillet first, then add the filling. The only changes that I've done are extra chili powder, about another 1/2 bag of taco seasoning, and no black olives. Oh yeah, and more cheese. We love cheese. LOL!!

My husband usually says, "Thanks, Honey, that was good." But last night after serving these enchiladads he said, "Those were fantastic! Better than anything I've eaten in a restaurant." Now that is high praise! 

We all thought these were great. I wouldn't say they were easy, though! I made it harder on myself by forgetting to take out some sauce for the vegetarians before I added the chicken, so I basically started all over to make a vegetarian version (using Quorn "chicken" cutlets). 
I used corn tortillas because leftovers with flour tortillas get slimy. As it was, the few leftovers were pretty mushy but still good. I only filled and baked 1/2 of each version rather than have too many leftovers and I'm glad I did. I would rather bake them fresh and use up the filling that way. I used Taco Seasoning I by Bill Echols. I only used half the recipe in each batch. It was just right for me. With it I served Salsa Guacamore by Lauren Heyn. Will definitely make these again! Thank you, Angela!

These were amazing. I cooked the chicken in a slow cooker to save myself some time and steps (cooked w/ the taco seasonings as well as some chicken broth). I used corn tortillas instead of flour, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. (Actually, because the chicken was so moist after being in the slow cooker, I did not need to add any water to the chicken/onion/soup/seasonings/chilis mixture). These were definitely restaurant quality. I make recipes from this site all the time, and this is only the 2nd or 3rd I've liked enough to take tiem time to rate. Very, very good. Highly recommended.

Excellent recipe!  I have time to cook only on weekends and have leftovers all week.  I was concerned that the flour tortillas would get soggy pretty fast - and they did.  I'll be trying these again today with regular sized corn tortillas, but to save time, will probably layer rather than roll.  This is a keeper!!

Did you know you can shred your chicken with a hand mixer? Cook chicken as directed, put in large bowl, and with mixer on low to medium, "stab" chicken repeatedly with beaters until shredded! So easy and time saving!!!

This has long been my favourite enchilada recipe, but, it was time to lighten up. I replaced the condensed chicken soup with greek yogurt. To compensate I added 2 tbsp powdered chicken stock to the water step. I reduced the sour cream to less than 1/2 cup. I also added one chopped green pepper and omitted the butter, using PAM spray instead. Salsa was used instead of enchilada sauce and minimum cheese. With these changes the calorie count per enchilada was about 450.

I LOVE this recipe! It's definitely one of my go-to recipes, have it at least twice a month! The ONLY difference I make is using a rotisserie chicken, just to cut down on cooking time. Otherwise, perfect as is =)

We love these. We use rotisserie chicken for ours to make it take less time. We also usually leave out the green chilies, and green onions (we have a non-veggie eater in the household. grr). It still tastes fantastic. Oh, and we use corn tortillas instead too. Yum. We've made this SO many times already. Its definitely a keeper!!!!

This was awesome, next time I will get a better enchilada sauce. I also would microwave the tortillas or place them in the oven for a while, so that they will not break when you fold them.

The best enchilada recipe ever tried, I made this recipe 5 times now, it sure is a keeper.  The whole family really enjoys this. I have made this receipe with 2 store bought chickens as it is easier to shredd.

my husband LOVES these, he wasn't excited about them at first because he is not a big fan of Hispanic foods but he nearly ate the entire pan.

Incredible Enchiladas!!  Soooo Good.  Followed the recipe pretty closely, just added extra green chilies + additional chili powder and some hot sauce for a little extra kick!  My girlfriend makes me cook healthy so we used low fat sour cream and whole wheat tortillas (didn't matter).  Highly recommend these, we were fighting over the leftovers.  Well worth the wait, I will make this recipe again and again!!

First Enchiladas I ever made, and the best I probably ever had. They are delicious!!! I made these for my mom and dad and I for our American Idol night, and we all practically licked the plate clean. Just perfect, I didn't change a thing, except that I used 7, 8-in Tortillas instead of the bigger ones, and I topped it off with a lil more sour cream and green onions. This will be my go-to Enchilada recipe. Very simple and easy to prepare, not to mention quite cheap.

Very good and very filling.  I shredded 4 leg-thigh pieces I had slow cooked in crockpot. I skipped the butter and chopped onions step and just added more onion powder because of time.  I do not care for canned enchilada sauce so we subbed salsa verde.  This made 8 nice size enchiladas to fill a 9x13 pyrex.  Can't wait to try it with the onions!

My boys liked this recipe, so I will make it again. However, there is just too much of the chicken soup flavor in the dish for me and it really detracts from the authenticity.  I will be seeking alternatives to this the next time I make the dish and will definitely add more kick in the spice department.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good, however. It would be better with beef instead if chicken(too bland/neutral with chicken) and corn tortillas not flour! The flour tortillas get soggy. I will be making it again and trying with those changes.

I made this, and it was time consuming, but the fact that my hubby and teenage boys had three plates each was worth every minute of it. Everyone loved this, it's a keeper for sure! 
One thing I did differently was instead of rolling the burritos, I layered in a cake pan. Tasted awesome!

This is excellent!!!  We didn't have green chilies (thought I did) so substituted RoTel with green chilies and it turned out great.

These were delicious. Did have to make a couple changes because I didn't have some things. Used paprika instead of chili powder and half a can of Rotel instead of green chilies. They came out so good! Will definitely make these again.

These enchildades were a hit with my family. They loved them. And they were so very easy to make.  I had my teenage daughter shred the chicken and by time she was done I had all the other ingredients ready to mix.  My husband and 2 sons kept coming in the kitchen every 5 minutes to see if we were done, so it gave us some family together time...LOL.  Great recipe!

If I couldgive this recipe 6 stars, I would! These were by far the best enchiladas I've ever tasted. After I made them for my family last night, the first thing they asked is if I would make more for our Christmas dinner! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Would give more than 5 stars if it were possible.  This is an excellent recipe.  I did add a little bit of cumin because we love it.  I don't feel that most recipes on this site deserve 5 stars, but this one absolutely does!!!

SO unbelievably good... i did use the #1 reviewer's idea by putting everything in the crockpot and adding the sour cream and soup mixture and green onions at the end.  Thank you so much for sharing this.  I will be making again and again and again!

These were the most delicious homemade enchiladas I've ever had!  I used smaller tortillas which actually let me make 8 enchiladas and still have leftover chicken mix for later.  My husband nearly died when he tried these, shared them with all of his buddies.

These were delish!!! I never eat leftovers, but ate these enchiladas for three days straight! For my personal preference: no olives, jar/can instead of green chilies, made my own taco seasoning and used corn tortillas.

Wow!!!!  10 Stars!  I may never go to a mexican restaurant again!  BTW...I used leftover Thanksgiving Turkey instead of chicken and it was amazing!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a dinner party and it received rave reviews! I made my own enchilada sauce and added a handful of freshly chopped cilantro but otherwise followed the recipe as written. It was a hit and I'm sure to make it again.

Excellent, easy to follow recipe.  I followed some of the other raters recommendations and they turned out perfect.  Will be making them again this week for my staff since they were so good.

AMAZING enchiladas! I wouldn't necessarily call these "traditional" but once you eat them, you won't really care! I followed the recipe exactly, except rubbed the chicken breasts down with Adobo seasoning and let them sit for about 20 minutes before boiling. Once they were cooked and shredded, I sprinkled a bit more Adobo on.  I also added a bit of extra chili powder and garlic powder to the sauce. I mix a couple of tablespoons of Sofrito into the enchilada sauce as well. I also forgot to add the cheese in the filling, so I put all of it on top. :) Still turned out cheesy and quite flavorful. Will definitely be making again!

I usually don't really like enchiladas because I am not a fan of enchilada sauce.  The filling in this recipe is so stellar, I can bypass the enchilada sauce all together!

Yes, these were AWESOME!  My boyfriend and I absolutely loved these and will certainly keep making them.  The ONLY things I did differently was I added some hot sauce to the chicken mixture as well as a little more chili powder to the sauce, just to give it a little more umph!  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

These enchiladas were fantastic! I did make some changes to make them healthier and I thought they were still great. I used fat free sour cream, 98% fat free condensed cream of chicken soup, canola oil instead of butter, and a mix of 2% mexican cheese and fat free cheddar cheese. The fat free doesn't melt as good but when mixed with everything I thought it was great!

Thank you for this delicious recipe!  I had only made enchiladas once before and they turned out awful, but the positive reviews here prompted me to try again.  I made it exactly the same as the recipe, and the blend of the flavors was wonderful!

Angela, You're right.  these enchiladas are awesome!  My husband and I loved them!  I used the suggestion of cooking up the chicken, onion and spices in the crockpot and then did the rest the way you suggested.  Thank you so much for sharing this.  I'm looking forward to making this again!

This recipe is really great and the enchiladas make good leftovers as well. The only thing I do different is I use corn tortillas, which end up less gummy than the flour ones.

Tasted just like the ones served at my local Mexican restaurant!! I will definitely be making these again, though I will try the suggestion to cook the chicken in a crock pot with the spices and pull it afterwards. Thanks Angela!!

Made these last weekend with corn tortillas...wow!! They were delicious! I was a little skeptical as I am partial to my mother's homemade ones, but these were so yummy! I left out the taco seasoning, used minced garlic and made some other minor adjustments to use what I had on hand. They are superb!!!

OMG! I love this recipe! It turned out juicy and flavorful! I would add that I did not use onion! I did however put the green onions on top rather inside the chicken mixture! I used salsa verde that had cilantro, onions, and green peppers in it! That was easier! Thanks Angela!

I was desperate for a chicken recipe tonight that was not a casserole (per my husband). I ran across this enchilada recipe and it is fabulous. Makes a ton and is delicious. I did add a can of fiesta corn to the chicken mixture and used a 19oz can of enchilada sauce, just because I wanted to. Otherwise, the recipe was followed exactly and came out delicious.

This was fantastic!! I did as a previous user did and threw the chicken breast (frozen), taco seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, and about a 1 1/4 cups of water in the crockpot and let that sit all day on low. Then when simmer the meat with the chili's and lime juice instead of putting in a cup of regular water I put in a cup of the liquid that was still in the crockpot. 
I will definitely be making this again!!

I started making this recipe a couple months ago and never stopped cus my family always asks for it. I put double cheese than the recipe calls for and put a can of Mexican Rotel  instead of adding the can of green chilies and chopped onion. I put the whole can but this makes it a bit more spicy.

Great recipe!  To save time I used a broaster chicken.  Be sure to shred the chicken off the bone while it is still warm (much easier).  Excellent flavor.  I will be sure to make this one again soon.

These enchiladas are probably the best I've ever had, and pretty easy to make as well. I made some for a coworkers going away party and everyone was asking where I had gotten them from. Apparently they are THAT good that people were thinking I had catered from a restaurant. I will be taking other user's advice with the crockpot though. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing! Thanks!

I only used 1.75 lbs of chicken breast,  added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and 1 tbs of chili powder instead of 1/4 tsp, which still wasn't spicy enough (I tasted a hint of spice).  I used the 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, mexican mixture of shredded cheese, and light sour cream (fat free sour cream is gross).  I had enough filling to make 6 enchiladas (I forced myself to eat 1.5 because I couldn't stop myself but 1 SHOULD have been sufficient).  It's definitely a lot more work but SO worth it.  It's not the healthiest recipe but it's very yummy!

Good enchiladas. Used more than 5 shells. Made about 11 enchiladas. One was FILLING. I served mine with refried beans and spanish rice. I used juice from a whole lime and two containers of green chillies. A good recipe. Easy to make! Great for entertaining. I'm going to go into a food coma now.

I make enchiladas all the time and this is the first recipe my family really commented on.   In fact it's been requested to have at least once a month.   I followed the recipe using a rotisserie chicken and only used one tablespoon of taco seasoning since I have it in bulk and subbed some chicken stock that I had open for the water.   The leftovers - if you have any - reheat beautifully too.

These are really really good. I wanted to eat them for breakfast again today but I held back! (so that i can have them for lunch, hehe) I made this with fat free sour cream and 98% fat free cream of chicken soup. These were still fantastic! The boyfriend thought they needed to be spicier, a little franks hot sauce on top and these were perfect!

These are absolutely amazing!  I agree with other users that you can save some time by using rotisserie chicken or even the Tyson-precooked & packaged chicken.  I used low-fat & light versions of the sour cream & cheese & it was just as delicious.  I think the filling could even be modified to be used as a dip.  Thank you Angela!

Made this for dinner and it was great. I did change it up some. I dont like chiles or olives so I left them out. I will probably use smaller tortillas so that there were more enchiladas. I used only half a can of the enchiladas sauce as I think it is too spicy. This was a great recipe seeing as I downloaded it in the Albertson's parking lot as my husband was putting in his dinner request.

are you using red or green enchilada sauce, I like red but that seems like it would be a little weird with cream of chicken soup.

Too salty for our taste with the taco seasoning and the condensed soup as the recipe is written.  I did try a second time with additional chicken (had a package that was a little of 3 lbs) and it was worth the 5 stars.  Now for our individual preferences, I added little more cumin (1/4 tsp), and fresh chopped cilantro and avocado right before baking.  Thanks for the recipe and this is really a 5 star, easy recipe but just a bit too salty for our preference and I am a salt fanatic.

These warrant the "awesome" in their name. I didn't change the recipe at all and it came out perfect. The only thing that caught off me off guard was the simmering time for the chicken once combined with the onions and chilies; there was not enough liquid to have it simmer for the 20 minutes indicated. So I let the mix heat for about 5 minutes and then started stuffing tortillas. The meat still came out tender and delicious.

I have made this many times in the last year or so, my kids ask for it all the time. It is great made exactly as the recipe states but sometime I saute peppers with the onions. If you dont put too much sauce in the bottom of the pan leftovers do not get too soggy. I have to make an extra pan for my grown daughter to take home every time I make them.

This is basically the way I've always made my enchiladas, but I've never used the soup. I really like the addition of the soup. I accidentally used cream of mushroom low sodium soup, and it was just fine. These were delicious indeed...thanks for the recipe Angela.

So good! I followed the recipe exactly but couldn't find enchilada sauce. Instead I poured some of the cheese sauce over top of the once the enchiladas were in the baking dish so they didn't dry out. Didn't miss the enchilda sauce at all. They were delicious!

These are the best enchiladas I've ever had!  I've tried many recipes, including ones that call for homeade enchilada sauce, rehydrating dried peppers, etc.  But, flavorwise, these win every time!!

I have never eaten enchiladas let alone make them before.  I used this recipe and everyone who came for dinner was amazed at how good they were!  "Better than our favorite resturant makes them!" they all said.  THANKS for this recipe!  It has become a regular in my rotation!

I am impressed, this was easy and very flavorful. I did use a little cooked rice with the refried beans found it to be less 'pasty'

We LOVED this. Since we moved to the East Coast, I have been missing my favorite Baja Fresh restaurant and their Chicken Burritos done Enchilado style.  These reminded me so much of those -- So I will be making this often!

Love them, love them, love them! What a fantastic meal! I will be making a double batch for a party this week. It took me quite a while to get all the chicken shredded but well worth the work.

These are great! Only one kid didn't like them. Everyone else ate them up. Used low fat soup, light sour cream, corn tortillas and cheese only on top. Only forgot one thing, the green chiles and added green pepper and cumin.

Next time I will leave out the chicken/sour cream sauce from the bottomw of the pan, that was agreed upon by everyone.  The filling was very good and I will make this again.   It was a nice change to the enchliladas we usually make.

These were good but not fabulous... they were a little bland and definately not very authentic, which is the version we love and are used to. These were easy to make, especially since I had some leftover chicken from the day before. I'd make them again but I'd prebably add some different spices and leave out the cream of chicken soup and only use the sour cream on top of the enchildadas, once cooked.

It was delicious.  My kids do not care for straight enchilada sauce, so I saved some of the cream sauce, and mixed it with the enchilada sauce - amazing!  I did not have any chicken breast in the house, so I used 2 of the large cans of chicken.  Great recipe.

My Fiance' made these for me on Cinco de Mayo and WOW! These Enchiladas have to be one of the best things I've ever ate. Well done! The only changes he made was using hot taco seasoning and spicy enchilada sauce, it was fantastic!

I made this dish yesterday, it was so good and my family love it. I bought the hot enchilada sauce, but it wasn't hot enough for me. Next time I am using hot taco mix and add some jalepano pepper. Thank you very much for sharing the recipe.

Very good, though like others said, not that authentic. I made half with corn tortillas and half with flour...the verdict was corn are better. Also used greek yorgurt in place of sour cream and added chopped jalepenos.

I am new to cooking so this took a bit longer than I had expected, but the results were worth the wait. The flavors in the chicken are wonderful. To get speed things up, I made it into a casserole. The whole family LOVED it. Spanish rice on the side and ended with Flan Napolitano- YUM!

The recipe was very time consuming, but it was worth it. Instead of flour tortilla's I used corn. Excellent recipe. I will make these again very soon.

This was fairly easy to make, I did it pretty close to the recipe ex for using canned chicken- which worked great in a pinch and made it fast- no one noticed it wasn't really shredded chicken.  Sauce is rich and tasty, my lack of a fifth star is because it tasted too rich, and too commercial with the can  soup and enchilada sauce and taco seasoning- like Taco Bell- which I love- but the only thing making it better would be a homemade sauce/seasonings- overall an easy, filling dish- one was plenty for each person with beans and salad.   Will make it again!  Thanks!

This recipe is good if you like Taco Bell.  We weren't impressed with this.  I was expecting this to be way better with all the five star ratings. Very dissapointed.

These were very tasty; I liked the fact that they were creamy the best.  However, next time I'll add chopped jalapenos for a nice kick, as they were quite mild.  I'll definitely be making these again.  Thanks!

These were good, but for some reason I think the cream of chicken soup threw it off a little bit? Not sure I loved that addition. Next time, maybe I'll skip the soup and just use enchilada sauce to line the pan and mix more cheese into the chicken mixture.

Super awesome.  I used reduced fat chicken soup and reduced fat cheese, added garlic to the enchilada sauce and the chicken mixture.  I also use a rotisserie chicken, didn't cut or alter the other amounts, though.  Couldn't have been better!

Definitely lives up to its name! I added a little bit of cornstarch to the filling because it was a bit thin (I might have measured the sour cream wrong... that stuff gets messy!) and I didn't want it to be a mess when I was trying to fill the tortillas. We also used small-size tortillas and only 1 1/2 cups of cheddar because that's what we had in the house. Both my boyfriend and I loved it and we'll definitely make this again. Bravo Angela!

This was really delicious! Even the small kids ate it up! The cream of chicken was a wonderful addition to the dish. The only complaint I have is that once I added the cup of water, the chicken mixture was way too soupy. Next time, I would either add a little less water or omit it all together. Otherwise, great meal.

Used cheap canned enchilada sauce and a blend of mild and sharp white cheddar, and it was great!  Next time, however, i will reduce the quantities of soup & sour cream by ~1/3.

Awesome dish.  This was my first time making Enchiladas, it was simple and the instructions were great!!    I did this with green sauce and found it to be not exactly spicy enough for my taste so next time I will add some more "hot" but otherwise AMAZING!!!  Thank you!!

Best enchiladas I've ever had (and I've had very good ones!). My husband loved it too. I made my own enchilada sauce and taco seasoning since I didn't the packaged ones on hand and it was so good. This recipe is more time consuming then most of my other ones, but it was worth it!!

Great meal dish.  Figure about 1 enchilada per person and it was a great.  I don't cook often, mostly bake and I found the directions good to follow and it was a big success for my wife's birthday with family and friends.  Shredding the chicken does take about 20 minutes preparing 4# of chicken though.

This receipe was amazing. I used red corn tortillas (enchilada size). It made about 16 enchilada's with corn. My family loved it. We will definitely do this one over and over.

These were not very awesome. My daughter and I both thought they may be better with corn tortillas rather than flour.  They were not unedible, but not worth the effort

Great recipe! I used a slap chop to "shred" the chicken and it took no time at all. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars becuase this recipe takes a little more time then normal enchiladas. Other then that the recipe is amazing.

We LOVED this! Everyone gobbled it up! I threw my chicken in the crockpot with some chicken broth for most of the day, took it out and shredded it. Made the onion mixture in a skillet with some of the broth. Threw everything back in the crockpot (remove the extra broth first), with the cup of the soup mixture. I left out the green onions because I didn't have any, and used green enchilada sauce. YUM!

Wonderful recipe with an excellent taste.  We really wowed our new found friends.  Next time I'll use smaller tortillas because this size made for huge servings...not a bad thing, but as you get older you east a bit less at dinner!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I am giving this recipe three stars, not because they tasted bad, but it was way too much work (and too many calories!) for the end result. I decided to switch up my enchiladas and try this recipe instead of my classic standby, and it just wasn't worth it. My husband enjoyed the taste, but still thought my original enchiladas (whcih take 1/3 of the time) are better.

I am new to cooking but so far this has been the best thing I've made so far!  My boyfriend loves enchiladas and he thought these were amazing!  I cooked my chicken in a crock pot with a can of salsa which made the chicken absolutely perfect and I also used green enchilada sauce instead of the red because I like it better...I will definitely make these again! Thank you Angela!

I love this recipe! My sister and I decided to make a bake version enchiladas apart from my mom's traditional way of making enchiladas and tried this one. The chicken seasoning is fantastic. My brother keeps asking us to make this..he called them enchilada burritos cuz we use flour tortillas and my sis tends to fold them into burritos. lol. I actually made a chicken casserole using tortilla chips and used the chicken seasoning from this recipe.

OMG, this is absolutely an AMAZING dish. I made it for dinner tonight for my husband and I, and he said it was "Insanely Good!" The flavors were soooo rich, they were the BEST enchiladas I have ever had in my life. Shredding the chicken was the longest part (it really wasn't that bad though), but in the end it was TOTALLY WORTH IT. I will definitely be putting this dish in rotation. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!! :)

The flavor and seasonings are tremendous. However, the enchilada is drowned in the white sauce, and this causes the tortilla to become soggy. In the end, the enchilada looks like a messy pile of goop. I would advise using HALF of the white sauce over top the enchiladas.

These taste delicious but all the liquid made the tortillas real soggy. I really wanted to like them, but couldn't get past the texture of the tortillas. The guests didn't seem to mind but I didn't get any "oohs and ahhs" like other recipes i've tried from here.

I did not like this at all. I did it exactly as the recipe stated, and it was bland and tasteless. It wasn't bad, I could eat it, but it didn't make me go for seconds. I'm not sure what could make this better.

I'm not really a fan of enchiladas but my husband is so I decided to find a good recipe. I'm  glad that I did! This recipe is so good I became a fan. I accidentally used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken and it still tasted great. I also added 1/2 of a tomato diced on top and lemon juice instead of lime.

This recipe was  4.5 stars. The chicken ended up being kind of loose - Maybe decreasing the water would help. My kids thought it was too spicy and didn't eat much. Nice flavor though - and if you don't like spicy food you could modify the recipe some.

Update:
I made these the other night and somehow forgot to add the cream of chicken soup and sour cream - they were awesome!

Spread refried beans on the tortillas before placing chicken mixture.  Left out the olives. Substituted lemon juice for the lime. Even more amazing the next day!

Made this exactly as recipe states and they turned out excellent, i used a store bought pre cooked rotisserie chicken and it turned out great, maybe add a little more chicken would be my only suggestion and a mild one at that

These were the best Enchilada's I have ever made at home.  They tasted just as good if not better than what I've had at a Mexican Restaurant.  My husband and 4 children with one being fussy loved them.  I will make these again and I didn't change a thing from the original recipe.  I served them with a mexican/spanish rice recipe from this site.  This is going to be a much used recipe.  Thanks MomSavedbyGrace, they are awesome!

Phenomenal! Probably some of the best enchiladas I have ever had. The only thing I did differently was bake the chicken. Same taste and result as boiling, but it allowed me to prep the rest of the ingredients without worrying about another pot on the stove.

These are true to their name--awesome.  I added some chopped jalopenos to give it a little more spice.  Will definately make these again!  Made homemade enchilada sauce from this site and that was a little too hot so just used canned with a little of the homemade sauce added--perfect!

Too soggy, flavor was good.  I used chicken broth not water, but a cup is too much.  Might try it again with a little less liquid.

AWESOME Enchiladas.  It's actually a really easy recipe to make. I think I heard "THESE ARE AWESOME!!" about 5 times during the course of dinner from my boyfriend. We will definitely be eating these again soon.

This was so so SO good! I didn't change a single thing and it was perfect. It was also very pretty. I had no problems whatsoever with it being too juicy or dry; it was just plain good. It was time consuming to put together, but I enjoy that sort of thing. Plus it was easy.  Just give yourself time and you'll enjoy it!

These enchiladas were very good. My husband said they were better than anything he'd tried at the local Mexican restaurant. It took more time than I would have liked on a weeknight, there seem to be several small steps. But, I think now that I've made them once, I will be faster next time. I will definitely make them again.

This was an outstanding recipe; I did however make some minor changes.  I love Rotisserie Chickens from Sam's so I get their chicken and debone it (no work, plus good flavor).  And I personally prefer Corn tortillas over flour because to me they just taste better. And lastly I'm not much of a olive eater.   But other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

Love this recipe! Was a little nervous that the kids wouldn't eat it with the can of chiles, so I only used half, (other than that, followed recipe to a T). Kids loved it, hubby loved it, huge success- thank you!

Very tasty, very easy. Not the best enchiladas I've made and eaten, but very good and definitely will make again. I did use extra enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese, as I like lots of both.

i followed the recipe exactly except i breifly fried th flour tortillas prior to stuffing them thinking it would keep them from being soggy as other reviewers had mentioned, it helped a little but the bottoms were still very soggy so ive rated this a 4 as far as the taste goes,,,,,its a 5 so next time i will use corn tortillas

I made this exactly by the recipe except for using spinach tortillas because that's what I had and I think it added a little flavor.  It was my first attempt at enchiladas:  it was easy and did not disappoint my family.

very good, i would use only 3/4 cup of the cream of chicken mixture in with the chicken next time, it was a little saucy, i'd like to see it a little drier. but all in all it was great.

I made these last night for dinner......they were awesome.....everyone loved them! thank you!  We like the dark meat so I cooked legs and thighs. It took a little more time to get the meat off the bones but I just read another review that someone said they cook the meat in the crock pot during the day.  I also eliminated the green onion.

This was really good.  I didn't have chicken on hand so I had to substitute ground beef, and it tasted just fine.  It's not that spicy of a dish, so my whole family enjoyed it.  I did throw in extra lime juice because I like lime flavor.  Yummy, thanks!

MAKE THESE!! Totally worth the two hours to make and a million ingredients. This batch will feed 5 people easy. I made some Spanish rice on the side and that's all this dish needed. I followed the exact recipe and when I put the first bite in my mouth the clouds parted and angles sang. This is in my top 3 all time.

i'm not into sour cream as much as this recipe calls for, next time i will try it and maybe substitute stewed tomatoes for the sour cream. it was oozing with the sour cream/cream of chicken mixture and i used less than it called for.

Everyone I make this for loves this dish.  I've made 3 times for different groups of people and it's been a hit each time.  I make sure the cream sauce is extra in each enchilada so I like to make a little more of that sauce, it really makes the dish.

Very delicious.  A little time consuming but worth it.  I used a mild Enchilada sauce, next time I would use the spicy sauce for extra zip.  Also- not a fan of cream soup as ingredient but in this case you would never know it was used.  I'll make this again.

This recipe is perfect! Soooo good...better than our favorite local mexican restaurant! The only thing I did different was to make my own taco seasoning because I didn't have any.  For that I used a taco seasoning recipe off of here!  THANK YOU!

This is a great recipe and I can honestly say that everyone in the house LOVES it... even my picky little one year old! I was out of green chilies so I just threw in a cup of picante sauce and nixed the water and it came out great. I was actually a bit nervous about the enchilada sauce because of the soup/sour cream mixture but I think it is what makes them so great. Thanks for a great dinner recipe!

I was VERY excited for this recipe and it smelled delicious while simmering the chicken.  Maybe it was so disappointing because I was so excited?  It was far too rich (even with light sour cream) and did not need a whole packet of taco seasoning or all of the cream on the bottom (or for that matter, all the onion and cheese either!). I will use elements of this recipe in the future, but never do it the same!

Great enchiladas that my whole family of 9 enjoyed.  I added some extras and less of some for our taste.  We like it little more spicy.

The enchiladas were very tasty, but too salty.  I'll try using half the taco seasoning next time.  Thanks for sharing!

These are SOOOO GOOOD!!!  I made these a couiple of weeks ago and my husband loved them as did I.  He said they were better than the restaurant we go to.  I made them again last night for my mom and picky brother and they both liked them.  My brother even went back for seconds and like I said, he is picky.  Thank you for such a great recipe!  I will absolutely be making these again and again!!

My husband says this is a "make-again"  dish!!  I followed the recipe exactly (omitted green onions & olives because I didn`t have them).  I used the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce from this site since I also didn`t have any on hand.

My husband and I were never fans of Enchilada's before this recipe.  Love using flour instead of corn tortillas.  I have a picky 3 year old so left out the green chiles.  I also only had 6 of the small flour tortillas in so used those and packed them full of chicken.  I baked a couple of frozen chicken breasts in the oven before shredding them.  I added a little salt even though the recipe didnt call for it.  This recipe was so easy to make and so yummy that we all loved it.  This dish will become a regular at our dinner table.

very good! You can also easily alter this to low fat. I like to add some salsa verde (green kind) over top with the green enchilada sauce. It add extra flavor and is sooo good!

These were not my favorite chicken enchiladas.  The only changes I made were to double the recipe and use corn tortillas.  I thought they had good flavor but I wouldn't use all white meat.  I think they would have been better cooking a whole chicken. I also used green enchilada sauce as I think it is a better flavor combination with chicken enchiladas. Also the sauce I cooked the chicken in didn't cook down so the filling was runny.  I didn't have time to cook it down more.  Probably won't make again.

This recipe is truly amazing! I made slight changes, because we don't like our food to be too spicy. So I din't put in the chilies, and instead of cheddar I used ordinary cheese, and instead of enchilada sauce I put mexican salsa and tomato sauce (combined).  For drinks I served beer margaritas and the dinner was an absolute success!  I will definetly make this awesome enchiladas again! :)

Excellent recipe. I used salsa verde for the green chilies and I didn't have enchilada sauce so I made up my own enchilada sauce with 2 tsp of tomatoe paste, half a can of chicken condense soup added some water and some olive oil and spices with. It tasted great!!

These are the best enchiladas. The only change I made was I added cream cheese to the sour cream and cream of chicken soup.

Loved it!  Very easy.  I have tried other enchilada recipes on this site and this was the best.  I prefer shredding the chicken instead of buying the canned meat.  Thanks for a great dinner!  This is a keeper!

Awesome recipe.  I used corn tortillas instead of flour which made them taste more authentic.  My husband LOVED them.  Even my 9yr. old who typically comes 'gagging' to the table liked them!

a little time consuming. tasted good.. a little bland needs some adjusting on seasonings. also stayed mushy on the bottom..maybe don't put the sauce in the pan first. i'll probably try again.

This is one of my favorite foods ever!  It is a little bit of work and mess but SO worth it.  I actually make 2 dishes - one exactly as the recipe states, and another omitting chicken and substituting one can of black beans and one can of pinto beans to make a vegetarian dish.

These were great! My husband actually woke me up to tell me how much he liked them.  I only used 1 lb of chicken breasts and there was plenty of filling for 5 enchiladas - I think it was the perfect goo-to-meat ratio this way and in my opinion 2 lbs would be too much meat. A few other very slight changes: 'original' taco seasoning instead of 'mild' and used closer to 14oz of enchilada sauce [bought the 19oz 'big' can and used about 3/4. Otherwise followed the recipe as written and it was wonderful. My leftovers were mistaken as 'restaurant quality' by several of my co-workers!

Delicious! The only thing I changed was to follow the suggestion to boil the chicken breasts whole rather than cutting them into chunks first. I found that made shredding them very easy. This was a really good recipe - a little too spicy for our young children but my husband and I loved it!

I did not love these, I think I like more authentic enchiladas. I was not crazy about the mix of the creamy soup/sour cream mixture and the red enchilada sauce. I was dissappointed. If I mae them again I will use green enchilada sauce. I will also use corn tortillas as my flour tortillas got mushy.

These are more like chicken burritos, enchilada style.  They are well worth all the prep!  These are even better eaten as leftovers the next day!

We followed the recipe exactly as is, and it was very good.  We had way more filling then to only fill 5 tortillas.  We actually used 8, but could have probably used 10.  The sauce and flavor was excellent.  We baked them for the full hour, but probably only needed 45 minutes because the cheese was a little too crispy.  Great recipe though!

Really delicious!  Only got four stars from me because it was on the salty side.  Especially for my bf who likes things very light on the salt.  Added cilantro and it made it deeeeelicious.  I think I will make my own taco seasoning to cut down on the saltiness next time.

Absolutely 5 star rating.  Only thing we would change, based off our preferences, is the olives.  We LOVE black olives, but felt they were a bit much...tasted too much olive for each bite.  Next time we will dice the olives instead of slicing them, and we will probably use 1/2 to 2/3 of a can instead of whole.  This is a keeper!

I made this after seeing the great reviews. I doubled the recipe and made some for my neighbors. Everyone loved them, even the kids.  My modifications included: adding cilantro, using a mexican cheese blend (didn't measure, did it to my liking) and removing the olives.   I also used another reviewer's suggestion and used a crock pot. Since it was a Sunday, I boiled the chicken, while cooking the other items separately. I then put everything into the crockpot to simmer (except for the sauce that was used in the bottom of the baking dish) and let it simmer for a couple of hours while I did other things. When it was time for dinner, I rolled the enchiladas and baked them for about 20 minutes.

WOW, incredibly delicious! It tastes better than any I had at Mexican restaurants. I used corn tortillas (like the flavor better) and they did tear after filling them, but when the dish was baked I just cut it into squares and served it that way. I also used shredded chicken that I cooked in a crock pot the day before, the chicken filling was moist and very tender. Will definitely make these again and again.

Great recipe. I followed previous reviewer's advice and boiled the whole breasts instead of cutting them up before hand. Next time I will shred the chicken in the food processor as this did take a couple of minutes by hand and I was too impatient to make the chunks small enough for my liking. Followed the recipe except I omitted the lime juice and used olive oil instead of butter to cook the onions in. Highly recommended, this one is going into rotation in our house and will be proudly served to guests.

Great recipes! I bought a roasted chicken to save time, half of the taco seasoning and used low sodium cream of chicken. This was so fast, easy and tasted great!

I used canned chicken to save time and left off the black olives.  My husband loves these.  The first time I made it, I thought the green chilies would be too much, but they weren't.  This is really really good!

My husband walked into the house and the first thing he said was “honey it smells like a Mexican restaurant”  Well, it may have smelled that way but I can assure you it tasted that way too! This has got to be one of the best Mexican dishes I have made.  So very tasty, the kind of tasty where no ones talking while eating lol.   No left over’s here mister.  I like to stay true to the recipe, otherwise what’s the use in rating it if I made it my own?  Very good AS IS!!

I admit I was dissappointed, they were okay not 5 star.  Although they did taste better for lunch the next day.

YUM!! I didn't put olives on top because I don't like them, and added a bit more cheese.  My hubby thought it was a bit too salty, so those sensitive might have a problem with it.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe almost exactly- I just omitted the green onions from the filling (still used on top) and used light sour cream. My boyfriend said that it was the best meal I had EVER made. Very flavorful.

I thought these were absolutely phenomenal.  Fantastic flavor and yumminess!  My picky 8-year old devoured them and said they are his favorite.  I definitely don't see them as authentic or anything like that, and mine came out a little soggy and fell apart into a pile of mushy enchilada when I served them, but they tasted SO GOOD that it did not matter!  I probably should have let them cool a little before I served them to prevent that from happening.  The only thing that I changed is that I used corn tortillas instead of flour, because using flour just seemed weird to me.  I'm eating leftovers right now!  Yum, yum, yum!  Thank you!

These are good, just not my favorite chicken enchilada. It is time intensive with a lot of ingredients. If I were to make these again, I would omit all the ingredients in step 2 except the shredded chicken, taco seasoning packet, and water. I would simply simmer these ingredients for 10 minutes before proceeding to step 3. I would also use the "chicken taco seasoning packet" instead of the one suggested.

I omitted the condensed soup to make this recipe gluten free for my daughter.  I also made hers in corn tortillas; however I recommend using wheat tortillas if you can tolerate gluten.  These were excellent; my family devoured them.  Shredding the chicken was not as time consuming as I expected and certainly worth the effort.  I appreciated the black olive & green onion touches on top.  This recipe has made it's way into the regular menu.  Thank you Angela!

AMAZING!!!  I made these last night because my boyfriend loves enchiladas although I don't really care for them.... not anymore!  I absolutely loved these, as did he.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Didn't even need sour cream or anything else served with them.  Thank you for the fantabulous recipe!!!

I was a little skeptical, even given the fact that it had 5 stars when I pulled it up... but I was very wrong! This was delish. A keeper that will definitely be added to the rotation.

Delicious! This recipe was real simple. Definitely a keeper! Our family was treated to homemade taco sauce in place of the enchilada sauce!

These are the best home-made enchiladas I've ever had. I used the in-laws' homegrown cayenne peppers instead and it added a nice heat to the dish. Definitely worth making again.

I boiled chicken breasts, and then pulled the meat apart in lieu of the ground chicken.

I had never made Chicken Enchiladas before but it will be a common occurance now!  This is an AWESOME recipe!  The flavor is PERFECT!  I omitted the small onion, green onions, & olives just out of personal preference.  I have given this recipe to EVERYONE in my office at work!
