Followed recipe exactly and all three of my dogs loved the biscuits. Will make these in future and only thing I will do differently is make the biscuits in different sizes so the smaller dog does not have such a hard time breaking off a piece.  Once they set, it was hard, even for me, to break one side off for the little dog.

Our dogs and the dogs we walk with all love these! I threw in some oats, but would not recommend it, they overpower the biscuits. Will be making them again tomorrow.
