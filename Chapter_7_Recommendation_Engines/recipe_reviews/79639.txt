If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  I never thought something so simple would be so yummy. I made as is with one minor change.  I used precooked bacon that way there was less grease and the bacon was crispy.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It's a definite keeper in my house.

How creative are you? I came across this recipe the other day and it sounded delicious---so I ran to the market and gathered the necessary ingredients. Might I say, this was to die for!!! Truly one of my new favorites, completley easy--and just mouth-watering. I wouldn't revise the recipe--perfect as is. Thank you so much! ~drool

Absolutely awesome!! This was SO good! The only change I made was to use my beloved regular Heinz Baked Beans (I can't stand sweet baked beans). I don't know if it was just me piling the toppings on too high, but I had to eat it with a knife and fork. Anyway, thanks so much for this simple yet delicious recipe!

This was definitely a change of pace for us.  My husband is watching his cholesterol and really has been missing bacon and cheese.  It was a nice touch to add to the dish while still keeping that cholesterol level low.  I made them as open-faced sandwiches using whole wheat muffins.  Next time I will probably not use maple flavored beans as this was the only detraction for him from the meal.

Michelle, we too have been eating this for years and it truly is surprisingly good! The only thing my mother taught me to do is precook my bacon and once the muffins come out of the oven just criss cross it on top.

Soo good. My husband looked at me like I was a nutbag when I handed him a plate of this for lunch then came back and told me to make them for dinner, lol. I layered mine a bit different cheese first, then beans, pre cooked bacon, onion, then tomato. I also didn't bake mine because the oven was already full. I will be making these again for a quick yummy lunch.

Good and easy. I could've done without the bacon. Or maybe it should be cooked first so the grease doesn't make the whole thing a bit soggy and, well, greasy.   I think the recipe is written confusingly. Are you supposed to make 8 open-faced sandwiches or 4 closed ones? I made 6 open.

I made this recipe vegetarian friendly by dropping the bacon and using vegetarian baked beans and it was delicious!  I also swapped the english muffin for italian bread and the cheddar for motzarella because I didn't have those in the house but I bet it's even better with the original.

This is a simple and easy way to use up leftover baked beans.  I cook my bacon first to make sure it gets crispy. I think that if you put raw bacon on the sandwich, you would have to leave everthing in the oven too long.  I also wait until the last couple minutes to add the cheese so it melts nicely.  The tomato and onion will cook quicker too if they are not covered with cheese the whole time.

I never thought anything so simple could take so good!  This is a keeper - will be making this over and over again.  I used Bush's vegetarian beans and skipped the bacon.  It was fabulous.  Thanks for this recipe.

These are extremely satisfying on a cold Sunday morning like today, and so easy to make. It's basically the no-hassle version of an English breakfast, no frying and heating and poaching, just pile everything up and bake. Ingenius! The onions give it a really nice touch. I was worried it would all slide and fall apart as it melted in the oven  but it held together fine. Very pleased with this. Would use it to feed breakfast to a crowd of friends in a fast and easy way. Thanks.

Great Recipe!  Delicious snack! I didn't have bacon and used a red onion and it came out great!  Toast the muffin before and after you pile on the ingredients.

We thought this was pretty good.  Not something I would make on a regular basis, but it's different, so I will keep it around.  I did crisp the bacon before popping them in the oven and I think that was a good idea.  I think the bacon would have been undercooked had I not done that.

I read this recipe and KNEW my kids would love it.  I had some problems with it, but it was so good, I have to give it five stars anyway.  I will definitely make this again.  Next time, I will lightly toast the english muffins first, to give them some crunch.  Also, I had complaints that the bacon was underdone.  Next time, I will make as directed, but precook the bacon and save the bacon and cheese for the broil phase.  Put the bacon and cheese on top and let the cheese melt over everything.  (As directed, it was rather messy, with 20 minutes of cheese melting.)  As I said earlier, even though I would make changes, this is five stars as-is.

Everyone thought this was weird while I was making it. So just to be nice they all tried it. Everyone was shocked to find out it was very good, they ate them all. I will be making this again! Thanks this recipe is very easy & cheap to make. It goes great with food from the grill.

I thought I would really like this.  It sounded a little strange, yet good.  None of us were impressed with this.  My 7 year old said it was slimy, but it was okay enough to eat.  My 2 year old who eats everything only took one bite.  It was edible, but not good.  I won't be keeping this one around.  Sorry.

Tasty & Different!!! It's a good combination of flavors--for me the onion and tomato made yummmy! Even my husband who doesn't like baked beans asked me to make them again the next day!
