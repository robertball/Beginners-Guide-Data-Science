Allrecipes published this incorrectly. My original submission stated 36 mini muffins as the servings, not 12. Depending on how full your muffin cups are, you can have 36-48 mini muffins from just one box of the cake mix and other ingredients listed above. (most mini muffin pans have 24 cups) Thanks, and enjoy! -Jen

My four year old says he would give these 10 out of five stars, ha ha. Made mini muffins, wish allrecipes had more recipes for those, wonder why they changed the format?

These were great! Based on the other reviews, I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice to add a little more flavor.  To make mini muffins, I baked at 350 for 12-13 min and they got rave reviews from my family! So easy!

Great Recipe! Cost me $3 and tax for 24 muffins. I used the spice cake mix and it turned out great. Thanks for sharing.

The pumpkin makes for a nice muffin in terms of moisture, texture - it substitutes well for egg, oil and water/milk. However, I didn't love the flavor - actually found it a bit bland. Next time I will add "pumpkin pie spice blend" (or at least some cinnamon and nutmeg) liberally!

Delicious. Followed the recipe except for the addition of chopped pecans. These are definitely worth trying.

I absolutely LOVED these muffins! They were so easy to make and delicious!  I kept them in the fridge and they stayed very moist even after 2 or 3 days.  I also tried them a second time and, on accident, bought a banana cake mix, but it ended up being delicious! It was like banana chocolate chip bread.  YUM!

You can't beat this for a delicious, fast, easy recipe.  Like others, I added about 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice and baked 15 minutes at 325 degrees for about 4 dozen mini muffins. 
Perfection!

I added one tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. I used parchment cupcake liners and baked for 15 minutes. I got 48 mini cupcakes. Liked by kids and adults alike. Will definitely make again.

I've made these muffins, many times! I recently made them and added coconut to the recipe. They were a hit!!! Added just a little more flavor. They are a family favorite!

Very good! I made these as full size muffins (it made exactly one dozen) and they turned out perfectly. The only other change I made was adding a couple dashes of pumpkin pie spice in order to intensify the flavor. Muffins were extremely moist and tasty.

Made these as mini muffins. I added 1/4 cup of milk, a teaspoon of coconut extract and used chocolate fudge cake mix.  I've tried baking them before without the milk and I think a little milk helps the texture.  I baked some in mini muffin cups and some just in the mini muffin pan.  The ones baked without the cups came out looking better, with the tops more rounded.  Also, baked them at 350 for 9 mins.  Yummy!

Clarification - you use only the dry mix of the cake, you don't follow the cake recipe to make the full cake batter. I wondered how dense they would be without any eggs, or any other liquid, but the pumpkin was great - not as fluffy as cake, but still moist.  This probably makes them better as mini muffins then full sized. Batter is thick and won't pour, so a cookie scoop is great, maybe even a pastry bag with a wide tip.  Mine made 46 minis.

I made mini-muffins, and found the texture very heavy.

I loved these! Super gooey and delicious. Was my first time making mini muffins, and I accidentally filled the cups too high and ended up only getting 31 muffins out of the batter, but they were still great! Next time I will probably use a teaspoon scoop instead of a tablespoon scoop. The instructions and baking time were both perfect. Also, this is really minor, but I used Duncan Hines Signature Spice Cake Mix and the box should say 16.5 oz, not the 18.25 oz as listed in the ingredients. Very easy, will make many more times.

Simple and delicious. I made regular muffins with dark chocolate chips. I will definitely make these again.
