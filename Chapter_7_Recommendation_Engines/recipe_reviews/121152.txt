This bread turned out great.  I made a slit in the top of the bread before baking and added some more cheese.

This was delicous! I added more cheese to really bring out some more cheesy flavor to it!

This bread was really good.  I was a little disappointed that it didn't taste real cheesy but it was delicious either way.  I uploaded pics, I did one loaf of bread and then clover rolls with the other dough.  My family loved them and I would definately make it again.  It was really simple to make.. Thanks

This was great for me.

BTW- in reference to another reviewer- if you need a recipe to tell you to activate the yeast, that's YOUR problem, not the recipe's. ;)

Halved this recipe...Best jalapeno and cheese recipe ever... Felt like I bought this bread from a bakery but better! I made the dough in the breadmachine with 2 cups of AP and 1 C of white wheat flour, oh and about 3 tsp of wheat gluten with vitamin c. Added cut cubes of jack and cheddar and some pickled jalapenos and mixed it by hand.. Later I let it rise for 45 minutes by my fireplace and baked 2 small loaves at 375 for 20 minutes. Awesome recipe!

Made this bread in my bread maker. Assembled wet ingredients first with dry on top to ensure proper mixing. AMAZING white bread! The cheese really doesn't stand out when using 2 cups so I will add more next time.

I made this into the two loaves.  I used metal pans and I think glass would have been better, they seem not to stick for me.  I tore the loaves a bit trying to remove them.  I also underbaked a bit which gave a bit of doughy cosistancy in the center. My fault there.  It was very moist and stores well. I will make it again and would recommend it for practicing bakers like me:)

Very good recipe.  I added a little more cheese to the recipe and have made this as a white bread poking in cheese chunks or cubes prior to the final rise.

This was a very easy loaf to make.  I substituted 1 cup of cubed Pepper Jack for the Cheddar.

I impressed everyone with this recipe!  Including myself!  The bread was light and delicious hot.  I might cube the cheese instead of grating it next time.  The grated cheese kind of got lost in the bread.  It might be better if the cheese was more noticeable.

Definately didn't have a strong cheddar taste, but very delicious. I might add extra cheese to the bread and on top the next time I make this bread.

This bread is great.  I do it in my stand mixer.  I never seem to get all the way to 6 cups of flour though.  I tried it with bread flour this time instead of AP.  Its still cooling so we will see how that affected it.   The last time I made it i grilled the buttered bread and made turkey sammichs with it.  They were awesome.

This was delicious. I halved the recipe and made 2 smaller loaves. Aside from adding 1/2 c more cheese to the dough, I followed the recipe exactly. I also sprinkled a little cheese on top just before baking the bread. It made a perfect ham & cheese sandwich to take to work. I will definitely make this one again!
