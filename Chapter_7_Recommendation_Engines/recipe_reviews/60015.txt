We really liked this.  You didn't notice this was turkey/chicken instead of ground beef.  Don't expect this to be hot.  It's has a slightly sweet taste from the thousand island dressing.  My husband really liked it.  It makes another good chicken dish to serve instead of beef or pork.  Think twice about putting the crushed chips in the salad.  This recipe makes a large bowl of salad.  If you don't think you are going to eat all of it and may have left overs, put the crushed taco chips on each individual serving.  Otherwise, the left overs will have soggy chips in it.

Fantastic! I prefer my dressing 1/2 low fat ranch, 1/2 salsa, otherwise stuck to the recipe, and it was wonderful and healthy.

Instead of a packet of taco seasoning, I used one batch of Bill Echols taco seasoning (minus almost all the salt), which is also from this site. I ate mine with just the lettuce, a little 2% cheese and a little FF sour cream but the family ate as is, with the thousand island, cheese and sour cream on the side. My husband liked it with the dressing but the kids wouldn't even try it. For me, this was a low calorie/low carb dinner and a boy pleaser, even though it was made with ground turkey. I suggest you make yours with a homemade taco seasoning only because the flavor is a lot better and there's less salt/fillers.

Yummy!  The only changes we made were to use low fat dressing and a can of olives.  We also kept the chips separate for leftovers.  Everyone loved it! Thanks for a great summer recipe!

made this last night and it is great!!!  All the flavors blended wonderfully and it is economical as it will feed a bunch.It was great warm for dinner and even better 3 hours later cold for a midnight snack.  I followed the recipe directions exactly how they were written and would not change anything.

I give this four stars for taste and 5 for ease. DH loves it and definitely gives it 5 stars, so I rounded up to 5. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent!  In the past I've used Ranch Doritos instead of tortilla chips.  Just another option!

This was very easy. We loved the flavors. I made it exactly as described. I think I will add a little garlic and onion to the meat next time.  It made quite a bit so we added the lettuce and chips on a serving basis. We don't like soggy chips so this was a good solution for us. Waiting also afforded us the ability to heat it up right before serving the leftovers. We will be making this again. It was also very economical. Thank you.

I love this recipe. We added shredded cheese to it. It is great as is, but another variation that is really good is to use Doritos nacho flavored chips instead of tortilla chips. I love it either way!

Makes a ton of Taco Salad!  Way too much for just my hubby and I.  Not a problem but I will try to decrease the recipe next time.  I used another reviewers tip and made my dressing half salsa and half ranch dressing and it was very good.  Salad is very very tasty but it sure goes soggy fast.  I used the taco seasoning recipe mentioned (Bill Echols) and will use it again.

This is quick and easy and tastes good too.  We just added chips, tomato and lettuce as we prepared each plate rather than mixing it all together.  I used Thousand Island dressing on mine and loved it.  My husband and son used Ranch.  We topped with cheese.

We topped this with avocado slices, salsa, and small dab of sour cream and cheese rather than the thousand island. We'll try the thousand island next time. Its good just as a regular taco salad like we had it though and we thought healthier, instead of the heavy salad dressing.

Didnâ€™t use the dressing at all.  Just put a dab of sour cream on it.  Will make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was so easy to make and that is always a plus for me. I used blue cheese dressing instead of thousand island, because blue chesse is my favorite, and I cut down the amount to half a bottle. Loved it!
