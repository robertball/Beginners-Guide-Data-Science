This recipe is easy to make, and it is delicious.  I like hot dishes that have a bit of a bite.  If you are a weenie when it comes to hot and spicey, you may want to cut back on the red curry paste.  This recipe will become a regular.  Excellent

The ingredients in this dish are perfect.  I did change the amounts a bit for my taste.  If you use an entire tablespoon of the red curry paste, it will be HOT.  I made this dish twice this week.  Second time was the charm.  I eliminated the green beans, used whole chicken brests with the bones minus skin (cooked in oven prior to adding to the soup mixture).  I nearly doubled the amount of fish sauce, at least doubled the sugar (used the lite coconut milk), added more of the vinegar and added a few mushrooms at the very end of the noodle warming process in the soup.  It is the best mixture of ingredients I have found on this website.  Absolutely delicious.  But be careful with that red curry paste!

This was awesome!  Very close to a dish that I had at a popular resteraunt chain.  I will be making this again and again!

This was good!! It was a little too spicy for me, but my husband loved it. I loved how you cooked the chicken in the coconut milk instead of using oil. I didn't have green beans so I used snow peas, which was very good. I also had to omit the fish sauce. (I have to get some of that.) PLUS - I used the LITE coconut milk, splenda instead of sugar and only half the pasta. (We're trying to cut back on our carbs, fat and sugar.) All in all, it turned out wonderful and we would have this again. Thank you for sharing. YUM! UPDATE: second time I made this, I added eggplant and  we  served over rice. I made it a little  milder too.

This was a good weeknight meal that came together in a snap.  I agree with previous reviewers, cut down the amount of curry if you are thai-shy!  It was a little soupy and texturally needed some help, though.  Color, too.  Next time I  will add some red pepper strips, and some shitaki mushrooms, decrease the fish sauce to one tablespoon.  Thanks fo an easy and versitile dish!
