We enjoyed this rice pudding, but I thought the Earl Grey tea (one of my favorites) flavor was lost.  Maybe use 2 tea bags next time??  The texture is spot on, it's really creamy, and the agave syrup certainly did sweeten it.  This made 6 servings for us.  We are rice pudding lovers, and this is a nice recipe.

This is the best rice pudding I've made, my daughter took the bowl and didn't want to give it back.  The only change I made was 3 tbls brown sugar, 1and1/2 tbls spenda for the agave. Thanks for the recipe, the tea makes all the difference.  I'll be making this again.

I made this recipe and love it. I used Truvia nectar for that was all I had and it worked great.

I tried it, even added another bag of tea and it was still rather lifeless. i added about another 2 tbls of brown sugar for extra sweetness but it was still not very sweet. i liked it but i'll probably keep my other recipe
