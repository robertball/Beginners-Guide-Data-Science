As I looked over recipes to make for breakfast this morning,  I found many I would have loved to try but I knew I wouldn't be able to deal with the guilt afterward - so heavy with lots of cheese, bread, sauces, sugary syrups, flour or potatoes - good, maybe, but not good *for* you.  So this recipe was the obvious choice for me.  Nutritious, healthy and wholesome, but still hearty, delicious and satisfying.  I've made a similar recipe but had a couple of concerns about this one.  First, that there would be too much cheese - there wasn't.  It was enough to provide richness without being heavy and gooey. Second, that because the vegetables weren't cooked first that they'd be too crunchy - they weren't.  They were crisp-tender which I liked because of the contrast in textures that created.  I just made sure I chopped everything finely.  I prepared this as written, save for using a mix of orange and red peppers for confetti-like color and adding a good amount of fresh chopped dill, which proved to be an excellent choice.  I baked these in free-standing silicone muffin cups that I sprayed with cooking spray. Not only did these little guys pop right out of them, they were a cinch to clean, without any egg residue left in them whatsoever!  These were excellent - better than the other recipe I tried.  I liked the fresh, uncooked vegetables and my addition of fresh dill.  Good, good for you, and easy clean-up.  I like that.

These were super easy and very tasty. I didn't have zucchini or red pepper so instead I used fresh spinach and mushroom. I also used 1/2 cup of cheddar and 1/2 cup of feta to give some extra flavor. They were delicious and the kids ate them up! I will definitely use this recipe again.

On the positive side, these were tasty.  However, I had other problems with these.  First, the ingredients kept separating, and it was difficult to get an even mix of cheese, egg and veggies.  Then I discovered after baking that all the ingredients rose to the top, so they were more like egg with a veggie cheese crust.  Again, this didn't effect the flavor other than it not being distributed.  The worst part though was the removal of the frittatas and the cleanup of the muffin pan - yikes!  Despite greasing the metal pan, quite they left a lot of egginess in the pan, and I came close to just tossing the pan when trying to clean it.  I also used a silicone muffin pan, and this worked much better, they popped right out.  While having individual servings is great for a large gathering, cleanup was too much work, I would only make these again with a silicone pan.

Just made these this morning.  Basically, used the recipe but omitted zucchini added JD sausage and red/yellow/orange peppers since I had those on hand.  Mixed the egg mixture in a blender and added a spoon full of salsa.  Instead of mixing all ingredients together, I spooned the vegetables into the muffin cups and topped with cheese then poured the egg mixture.  After taking out of the oven, I ran a knife around the edges and this helped to remove them from the pan.  Excellent, Excellent!!

2010-11-23 I made the first batch as written.  They were too bland for our tastes.  The second batch I made with a mixture of 1/2 good quality parmesan and 1/2 mozzarella plus about 1/8 tsp. garlic powder.  The second batch was a lot more flavorful.

Oh wow, these are fabulous! I baked a batch at night in order to freeze them for a quick breakfast, and I couldn't resist trying one before I threw them in the freezer, absolutely delicious, even cold! I did have a hard time trying to figure out when "just set" was. I ended up cooking them for 18 minutes.

I have made several varieties of these low carb Muffin Frittatas.  These by far, are the best.  I doubled the recipe and used 6 jumbo egg yolks and 6 jumbo eggs.  It was the perfect amount for 24 muffins.  I also added some diced ham, because I had some on hand.  This will be my new go to recipe when I am looking for a low carb breakfast option.

These were a great addition to our Easter brunch.  The individual muffin portions made for easy serving.  Just like tiny omelets, you could easily switch up the fillings for variety or use egg whites only. The leftovers kept well and were good when reheated.  I'll definitely be making them again to keep in the fridge for a quick, protein packed breakfast option.

I just made this recipe this morning (day after Thanksgiving). I was looking for a great base to start with, and this one worked perfect. It's easy to follow and doesn't require a lot of thought to figure out how to modify it if your not able to convert the size. I poured the "batter" into the muffin tins and then added my own ingredients to each one so they were all different. Obviously, turkey was the main ingredient, turned out wonderful. Saved to my recipe box and I will be using this again to serve as my base from now on.

I tried this recipe with Feta cheese, skim milk, a variety of veggies and a Cajun seasoning.  It was a perfect consistency and had great flavor!  I baked it about a minute and a half longer to get the edges a bit more cooked.  After trying it for myself, I plan on using this recipe for an upcoming brunch since it's so easy and you can easily customize the frittatas to individual preferences.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Great recipe. I used what I had on hand . . . a can of hatch green chilies, a mix of cheeses & some parm. I used my homemade low sodium seasoning. I mixed in a bit of shaved ham (husband doesn't like eggs without a meat). I did feel they were a little wet with that amount of milk. Next time, I'll use less.

This is an excellent recipe. I used exactly the ingredients called for and was very surprised how different the taste was from an omlet with the same ingredients. I did differ in the preparation, though in that I blended the eggs with an immersible blender and used a coated muffin pan that I had sprayed with canola oil. I served this with "Emily's Famous Hash Browns" from this site and a fruit bowl of tropical fruit mix topped with vanilla yogurt. I received five star compliments. 01/13/2003: I have been making these in a large muffin pan. It is the same recipe except for increasing the cooking time to 30-35 minutes. All this does is satisfy my male ego for a hearty portion on my plate. I have found it is very important to allow about 5 minutes of cooling time before removing the frittatas from the pan

Easy and delicious.  Used zucchini and tomatoes with skim milk and 2% cheese...calculated it to be 75 calories per muffin which makes for an easy healthy  breakfast to reheat a couple!

Yum, these are tasty and easy.  I didnt have milk so I used buttermilk powder and water.  In my frittata I put canadian bacon, feta and mozzarella.  They were done in 20 minutes.  I sprayed my muffin tin with Pam and and they popped right out.   I only got 10 muffins out of it.  Two muffins are only 147 calories!

This was the perfect breakfast! I had some fresh red and orange bell peppers, zuchhini, and red onions, all diced finely. I mixed in 4 eggs with a little skim milk and I seasoned with salt and black pepper. Lastly, I stirred in some cheddar cheese. I sprayed the 12 muffin tins with PAM and then I filled each of the tins about 1/4 cup with the egg mixture. They baked up beautifully in 20 minutes. I could see little bubble perking up slowly from the frittatas. The muffins were so pretty with the specks of bright red, green, purple and yellow cheese poking out from all over the muffins.  The frittatas popped right out of the muffin tins easily as was the clean up. The veggies were tender but still had a slight crisp. I would suggest dicing the vegetables finely. An excellent choice in getting all the veggies and protein in for a hearty and delicous breakfast.

These weren't anything special, but the part that really erked me is that it stuck to my muffin tin (even though I greased it really well). I tried everything to get it off and ended up ruining my muffin pan:(

I am not a big fan of eggs, but slowly adding them to my diet. I made these in little Rachel Ray baking dishes. I used just broccoli and cheese. I cooked them maybe 30 minutes, but I think our oven is slightly off. THEY WERE DELICIOUS! Definitely adding this to my recipe box!

Not sure why, but these fell flat as they cooled. The taste was fine and I followed the recipe, (except for different veggies, which shouldn't change the outcome) so the whole flattening thing was really weird. They are good for reheating for quick breakfasts, so I do appreciate that.

These were pretty good. I really oiled up the pans, since the other reviewers stated they were hard to get out. I ran a knife around the edge right after the came out of the oven, then removed them pretty soon after. Most of them came out fine. However, the remaining mess in the pan was terrible to clean up. I added silicone muffin pans to my christmas wish list just so I can make these again some day. Great idea though!

Great brunch item!  They look good on the plate, they're  tender and taste delicious.  Never would you think there was zucchini in here.  I can see adding crumbled bacon or chopped ham to the egg mixture making them even better.  Next time, I'm going to try using Egg Beaters in an effort to get the cholesterol down.  Definite keeper!

These are SUCH a winner for easy/delicious/impressive breakfasts!  A total crowd pleaser and you can play around with the ingredients! NOTE: I bought a SILICONE jumbo muffin pan for this one because i found removing the frittatas to be an issue even with lots of butter.  Works like a DREAM!

The egg/milk ratio + bake time was perfect.  I used different "extras" (canadian bacon and cheddar cheese), but they turned out wonderfully and reheated well.  These were a party hit.

There's nothing to NOT like about these.  I used the reviewer's suggestion of an 8x8 pan because I figured it would be easier to clean.  I pammed the heck out of it and I had not problem getting them out.  I used a full package of frozen (thawed) spinach instead of zuke and pepper because that's what I had on hand.  Both my toddler son and my husband who is not usually an egg-y person loved them.

These were great!  So much flavor to them.  I sprayed the muffin pan with lots of Pam, but still stuck some.  Made it again this morning for my MOPS group, but used a 8 x 8 pan and cooked for about 25 minutes.  Will make this again and again.

I made a batch of these frittatas, individually wrapped them in plastic wrap, and then popped them into the freezer. I was looking for a quick but healthy morning meal. The frittatas weeped quite a bit after being microwaved the next morning, but maintained their shape and texture. Very good! I would probably use less cheese next time, and more vegetables. My only problem was that they were so small, that I could have eaten a few of them at once!

Yum! Even though I just ate eggs for dinner, I sampled part of one of these muffins that I made to take to work for breakfast... I'm already looking forward to tomorrow! I didn't have zucchini so I just used another bell pepper and used green onion since it added a nice color and mellow flavor. Scaled back the cheese so I don't turn into a fatty :) - for six of these, I added fresh dill, per Naples recommendation, and I'm glad I did! My bf can have the 6 without. :)  They're cute AND so yummy!

These were alright. I didn't squeeze out the zucchini and this made it water-y. I also used green onion instead red. You could barely taste the cheese. It's also quite bland, and didn't have that scrambled egg texture I thought it would have. Neat recipe, just not for our tastes.

These turned out great.  I baked them in silicone muffin cups, which I sprayed with some non-stick spray.  They popped right out.  You could add pretty much whatever your heart desires to these.  I just so happen to have all of the ingredients that it called for, and I also added a bit of finely chopped mushrooms.  Yummy.  They reheat well in the microwave too.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe needs to state that a silicone muffin pan is a must! If you make these in a standard dark muffin pan you will just have a mess on your hands. I loaded my pan with non stick spray (after reading the reviews) and I still had a mess! Luckily I was not having company for brunch because I would not have been able to serve them. With that said, they are tasty but stick so bad they don't hold shape and are not worth making.

Super easy and super yummy!  I made these for dinner for myself and my boys while hubby was out of town.  My 8 year old appeased me by trying one, but my 6  year old just looked at it and would not touch it, likely due to the bits of red pepper and zucchini!  The 3 year old...well, he's a whole other story!  Oh well, I LOVED THEM!  Left out the onion, used a combo of both light feta and light marble as well as using 4 eggs and 3 whites (to use up the last of my open carton).  These cooked beautifully in my free standing silicone baking cups!  I love that these are so versatile and can be made so many ways using different veggie/cheese combos.  YUM!

There were just okay for me.  I thought there could have been some more flavor, but still a good recipe.

These were so yummy! I halved the recipe, used 1/2 cheddar & 1/2 feta, cubed about an ounce of cream cheese, did not have zucchini but put in the bell pepper and onion. This is a keeper in my book!

I thought these tasted good. I was short 1/2 cup of cheese, but it did not seem to be a problem. I like that it had about a cup of mixed vegetables to. What I had a problem with is the texture seemed a tad rubbery and tasted just like an omelet. So, to me it seemed a little extra work to pour it into a muffin pan. I poured them into paper muffin liners. I had a problem with them sinking in the middle quite a bit after cooling. I am not sure why.

Very good, added tomatoes, more onions, and made it in a large pan, which took closer to an hour.
It is a good baseline recipe, my boyfriend and I tried it with different salsas and hot sauces. Next time I'm going to add diced jalapenos for a kick! And different flavored cheeses

These are pretty awesome - followed the recipe exactly with the addition of a few slices of chopped bacon.  Mine came out a little soggy but I think it was because I overzealously sprayed Pam, worried about what others said about sticking.  Absolutely had no issues with sticking - they popped right out.  The cheddar is strangely hard to taste (used Crackerbarrel), but these 'muffins' have a nice consistency to them - quite tender and moist. I hate omelets but didn't have a problem with these.  I'm excited to try what others have suggested - addition of dill, or feta, mushrooms and spinach (I'd probably saute the mushrooms and spinach first to get rid of the excess moisture).  But they are filling and a great breakfast to take to work as they fill you and are mini.  I got 12 muffins from this.  Couldn't taste the zucchini at all but I think it added a lot of moisture and this would be a great way to hide those veggies from the kids.

These were yummy but washing up the muffin pan was a real pain. I am lining the muffin pan with paper cups in the future. It's just not worth the time spent washing up!

I was looking for something different to make for my family on the weekend and found these muffins interesting.  Unfortunately, I didn't have some of the ingredients the recipe called for so I had to improvise with some things I had on hand.  I added some ham,
swiss cheese, red pepper, red onion, and spinache. My family enjoyed them and my son even finished the leftovers for breakfast the next day.

These were great. Made as written but omitted the bell pepper as I didn't have any. Next time I would grate the zucchini because the kids kept asking me what is was lol other than that wouldn't change a thing.

These are fantastic!  I actually liked them warmed up the next day a little better.  I think next time i will saute the veggies before i put them in to give them a little more flavor.  Also i added a jalepeno!  delicious!  I forgot the milk and it didn't make a difference. I like these squished in between some wheat toast....yummmmy!  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm rating this recipe for the flexibility of ingredient substitution. I was looking for something different to make for breakfast and I came across this recipe. I had to improvise with ingredients I had on hand. I used low fat mozzerella for cheddar, chopped fresh mushrooms for zucchini, and chopped smoked chicken breast (delimeat) for red pepper. The possibilities are endless! Next time I will try adding Gouda and chopped chives. If using mushrooms, though, I recommend baking them a bit longer till the water has evaporated on top, about an extra 8-9 minutes. My muffin frittatas still turned out moist. I also used silicon muffin cups to save a few calories and they popped out nicely without sticking to the bottom or sides. This recipe has a nice egg to milk ratio and just about any combination of veggies or meat can be substituted with perfect results. This is going into my keeper file!

The only small issue I had with those - was taking them out of the pan... But I slided the knife around the edges and could take them easily after that... Beside that - the taste was very nice, very light.  Will definitely do again, especially if I have guests (after taking these out - they look very pretty)

These are so easy and healthy! Had to cook for about 7 minutes longer than recipe stated. My hubby strongly dislikes zucchini, so I used red and green peppers instead. I added some crumbled turkey bacon (about 3 slices) from Trader Joe's that added some needed flavor. I found these were even better the next day warmed up for a bit in the microwave! Hubby didn't care for them, but he likes his eggs very well done so unless you have an egg eater like him, I'd say this is a definite make again recipe! Would be so cute for a brunch or shower!

Made these last night to keep in the fridge and pop in the m/w for breakfast, I had a 1/2 roll of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage so I cooked that up and added to the batter, they were very good this morning and very easy to make, not so sure I would make them without some type of breakfast meat.

I haven't made these as written yet because I didn't have the zucchini and bell pepper on hand. I substituted fresh broccoli and mushrooms.  I sauteed the broccoli and onion for a couple of minutes before adding it to the egg mixture.  Also, I used smoked gouda cheese rather than cheddar and it was wonderful.  My husband ate 6 of them!

I think this is a very good base recipe that loans itself well to whatever combinations of veggies and cheese that you prefer.

I didn't have any zucchini, but added lots of broccoli and loaded up the pepper and onion, also added a bit of feta cheese and a little less cheddar.  I cooked them about 7 min. longer than specified.  Loved them, as did the hubby

I used breakfast sausage ( diced very small) because when I wanted to make these I had no pepper or zucchini in the house.  THey turned out fine and were a welcome alternative to our  usual scrambled eggs.  Also agree about the pain of cleaning the muffin tin.  But, I will make these again.

Great savory breakfast recipe!  I used a small red and small green pepper, red onion, fresh minced garlic, and diced pre-cooked ham.  First I heated up some olive oil in a pan and sauteed the garlic for a few minutes, added the diced red onion followed by the diced peppers and ham cooking on medium high heat for a few minutes.  While sauteing, I mixed the eggs, milk, salt and pepper in a medium bowl.  Then I added sharp shredded cheddar cheese and sauteed veggies to the egg mixture and stirred well.  I doubled this recipe, filled 24 muffin cups w/ 1/4 cup and still had enough leftover for a huge omelet.  Please note that my muffins shrank after being removed from the oven to about 1/2 the size of the ones in the picture.    We ate the omelet for lunch and tried one of the muffins.  They're excellent....the sauteed veggie liquid really added a delicious flavor to these frittatas!  I'll be taking the muffins camping this weekend and will either be eating cold or heating them up in some foil on the grill.  Thanks so much for the excellent recipe!  These are delicious!

I used 1.5 cups of South Western Egg Beaters in place of the six eggs.  This is a great way to hide some veggies, as dd didn't even inquire about the zucchini!  I made a double batch and froze the leftovers for quick breakfasts.  Thank you for sharing!

These were GREAT! So simple to put together and so tasty. I mixed my eggs, milk, salt & pepper in the blender to make sure it was well mixed. I grated my zucchini instead of chopping and used green pepper instead of red (that's all I had). These baked up in no time and I had no problem removing them from the pan. The ingredients can be changed up to suit your tastes too! I can't wait to try other combinations! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were soooo good! I made mini-muffins, and added chopped sausage, diced tri-color bell peppers, and green onion slivers. I omitted the salt, zucchini, and cheddar cheese (but subbed a southwest cheese blend). I ended up with two dozen mini-muffins, and I'm embarrassed to say that I just ate 1 dozen in one sitting. I'll be making these again and again.

Good and easy to make - need to grease the pan well, but they came out clean.  Just ran a butter knife around the edge first.  Made this to recipe, but would add a little more spice next time - maybe cayenne pepper.  Could easily substitute just about any vege - mushroom, spinach, artichoke, etc.  Even the kids (all toddlers) ate it!

These were great!  I added some hot italian sausage, extra peppers and extra onion.  I had some fresh peas that I shelled and threw in as well.  This could be good with pretty much anything.  I also used egg beaters.  The outside muffins were done first, but the rest had to go 5 mins longer.  The spray didn't seem to help much but they weren't too mangled when I took them out of the pan.  Will make again because of the cute little "single serve" sizes!

In reading the other comments, I decided to use muffin cups in the muffin pan. I went ahead and greased those, then put in the veggies and cheese, then poured the egg/milk mixture over top. They turned out great and everyone raved about them! I'll try this again with different ingredients too.

Great recipe!  I even took my mini cupcake pan and made smaller versions for my kids lunches (we are experimenting with making bento box lunches) The smaller size is great for kids who like everything mini sized.  Always grease the pans whatever you use!

These were very tasty. I arrange on large lettuce leaves for presentation and it was perfect to bring to my brunch. The only change was I added some chopped ham and 1 more tbs of onions. I used 1 non-stick & 1 aluminum oiled well. Non-stick...beautiful! Aluminum...yuck!! the clean up on the non stick is not worth the effort. So use silicone or non stick for sure.  Otherwise, fast, simple and very tasty!

Wonderful recipe!! I added a half of jalapeno, substituted green onions for the red, and used parmesan cheese instead of cheddar.  To address the issues with sticking, I used paper muffin liners and they seemed to work fine.  Will most definitely make this again.

Fantastic!! I made these today and will be making them again and again. I added 2 extra eggs and for the veggies, I used 3 zucchini (about 2.5 cups) and a whole onion. I used less cheese than suggested and would probably try the full cup next time to hold it all together. I also used a jumbo muffin pan so it made 6 big frittatas. I'm planning to freeze them for an easy breakfast to throw in the microwave.   I was surprised so many people had trouble with these sticking to the muffin pan. I used a non-stick pan and sprayed it with cooking spray. They slipped right out and the pan was easy to clean.

This recipe came together beautifully.  It was super simple to make...it gets 3 stars only because it needs a little more flavor.  We used bell pepper and mushroom, instead of zucchini, which was good...but in itself, egg is bland, bell pepper is bland, and mushrooms are bland.  I'll definitley make it again, but perhaps I'll add some salsa.

These were just ok for me.  I did saute my vegetables in a bit of EVOO and I also added a small potato that I'd diced into very tiny pieces.  I used skim milk so I don't think it was a rich as I'd have like it to be (all I had on hand).  All in all, I think I'll just stick to making a regular frittata in a skillet.
