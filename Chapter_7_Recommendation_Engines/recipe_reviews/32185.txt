I loved this recipe, after I made some tweaks.  I used a package of taco seasoning with the meat, omitted the onion, jalapeno slices, salt, and pepper (taco seasoning has most all that), and used 1 cup lowfat cottage cheese instead of cheddar (as the "Broccoli Cheese Cornbread" recipe on this site called for).  I baked it for 60 minutes, but it still wasn't done in the middle, so I microwaved those pieces and they were fine.  I used "Jiffy" brand cornbread, which is very sweet; that, along with the can of creamed corn, overpowered the flavor of the taco seasoning, so I think next time I will add some chili powder.  Note that skim milk works fine in this recipe.  This was a super easy, filling, and large casserole, and I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, but next time I would either use more hamburger or less cornbread and I love cornbread.

This dish was hit w/my pickey toddler and husband.  My husband requested I make
this dish when his parents visit us next.  I felt like a real chef!
If feeding kids, you may want to substitute or omit the jaolpenos.  My 18 mo old 
son didn't seem to mind them.

This was pretty good. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and cooked the ground beef with pack of taco seasoning and fresh garlic and I doubled up on the jalapeño's and reduced the milk to a cup. I also increased the cheese by 1/2 cup putting 1/2 cup into the mix and then 25 minutes into baking I put the balance on top. I must say it smelled great while baking and looked great coming out of the oven! The 20-25 min time is way off as noted by others, it took a good 50 min to cook through. Definitely glad that I tried it and will probably make this again.

I used this as a base to make mini muffin appetizers.  I only used one 8 oz. box of corn muffin mix, 1 egg and after adding the cream corn it didn't even need more liquid.  I used about 1/4 cup of chopped jalapenos and did sprinkle the meat with garlic powder.

I really loved this recipe! I love cornbread, and this was a great main dish that filled me and my husband up. I used one half water and one half milk for the liquids. I also did not have jalapenos, so I used drained Rotel tomatoes which were delicious in the cornbread. Also, I served it with a side of baked beans, which went well with the dish.

This is a good one! The perfect family meal. I didn't have any jalapenos lying around so I used a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies and it was just right. Even our 1-year-old digs it!

This is a great hearty meal ! My family loved it ! I did make some changes though, for some flavor.  When I cooked the ground beef, I added onion, garlic powder, pepper, a dash of season salt and a pinch of salt.  Then when the meat was done, I added a can of manwhich sloppy joe sauce and added slices of cheese along with some american easy cheese by kraft.  As the cheese melted and the manwhich blended with the meat, I snuck in a can of peas for some nutrition, lol.    For the cornbread I used 2 boxes of jiffy mix, 2 eggs, and the creamed corn.  I added my milk last which was a very little bit that I eyed, because I noticed that the creamed corn, helped smoothed out the batter as well.  So I only added a little bit of milk to finish smoothing it out. Then I folded in my groud beef, placed everything into my buttered pan and placed in the oven.   But instead of placing cheese on top of the cornbread, I made my cornbread like I normally would, which is to rub some butter on top of the cornbread so that it turns golden brown, but only do this once the top is firm enough to handle being touched.  I didn't need the cheese on top cause I had cheese in the meat.    In the end, this was great, quick and easy.  I will definitely make this again !!!!!

Used about 1/2 a can of green chilies instead of jalapanos as was mentioned here (picky eaters in my family).  But prepared it as is otherwise, and EVERYONE raved on and on about it.  My sister and mother and all the children and cousins and my dad.  I thought it needed more salt, but everyone else said it was great as is.  This is a great recipe for using up stuff in the pantry!

This was quite good!  Hubby and I both like it and it has been added to my list of keepers.  I use a small can of green chiles instead of the jalepenos.  I do think it could use a bit more seasonings.

Mixed reviews in my house.  My 8 y.o. daughter didn't care for it, my 4 y.o. son cleaned his plate, my husband thought it was good also & I'm on the fence.  I agree with others, it's missing something.  I TRY to stick as close to the recipe as I can the first time around to give an honest review.  If you completely change it,  you aren't giving an accurate review of this recipe.  We have our beef processed in pound and a half pkgs so I used more hamburger and in mixing the cornbread I felt 1 cup of milk was plenty after mixing it up.  Because most of my family doesn't care for jalapenos, I omitted those.  I cooked my ground beef with the onion, added quite a bit of seasoned salt and some cumin and I still felt like it was a little bland.  I baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  It was pretty much done so I covered it with foil, turned the oven off & let it sit in there until my husband got home, about 15 more minutes.  It was done through but I think the creamed corn gives it a texture or consistancy I didn't care for.  Cutting back to 1 cup of milk is probably the key to getting it done in a shorter amount of time.  I think this recipe has a lot of potential, maybe use sausage, bacon & some cream cheese and have it for breakfast???  I don't know if I'll try this again unless it will just be my son & husband at home eating it.

Easy to make and tastes great.  Kids like it.  I found that I had to bake it for 50 minutes instead of 20-25 minutes.

This was very dissappointing, but I think it was my fault. Instead of using a 9x13 pan, I divided the batter into two 8" round pans. Even after doubling the cooking time, the knife still would not come out clean in the center! It was very gooey. My husband also did remark that it was bland even though I added one Tablespoon of chili powder.

Good for an easy dinner, served with a side salad or carrots and ranch. I added a packet of taco seasoning to my ground beef, increased jalapeños to 5T since we like spicy food, and I used my old stand-by (non-sweet) cornbread recipe instead of jiffy mix. I baked for about 25 min at 400.

Haven't been able to taste this recipe yet because the cook time is off. I have had it in the oven for 45 minutes and it still isn't done. Hopefully it will be worth the wait!

Tasty recipe!  I also followed the recommendation of adding taco meat and green chiles (instead of jalepenos) and it was very good. It did take an hour to cook but was still moist!  Definitely would make this again.

I didn't really care for this. I don't know what it was, as I like ground beef and cornbread, guess I just don't like them together! I added some seasonings as other reviews suggested. It just still felt like it was missing something and I don't know what it was.

Taste great! I added 1 1/2 onions and 1/2 cup extra cheese and sprinkled cajun seasoning on the cooked meat. Now... the cooking time or temp is way off! I spent an hour and a half trying to get it to cook! Oh and put the cheese inside not on top it gets to brown on top while your trying to get it to cook.

I thought this was really good, even though I didn't add the jalapenos (didn't have any.)  My husband wasn't a huge fan, he thought it would have been better with jalapenos or something else, and my 3 year old loved it!

You must cook this much longer than the recipe calls for...about 1 hr. I kept checking after 25 minutes like the recipe says the toothpick was not coming out clean....but very good.

Good Toddler food!  I also added taco seasoning to the meat, makes it a bit spicy but our family likes it that way.  I did not have creamed corn, so I used regular cooked frozen corn, worked fine.

My husband and I were so looking forward to this recipe. On paper it seemed promising. It ended up simply tasting like corn bread. The beef was completely lost. We were trying to come up with ways to save this next time we made this, but just decided to give it up completely. I tried to bring it the next day as leftovers at work, but my husband just threw it out for me (we teach at the same school)!

This is what I did with this recipe...I seasoned hamburger w/ generous garlic salt, onion powder, and jalapeno salt. I added 1 lg red bell pepper, 3 fresh med. jalapenos, 1 clove of garlic-all finely minced. I used Martha White cornbread mix and baked as directed on pkgs splitting the heat to 375 for 40 minutes. Then I added sliced tomatoes and mexican shredded cheese mix for another 10 minutes, let set for 10 minutes and then served with sour cream dollop. My husband loved this as did ALL my co-workers, who thought it was a breakfast casserole. :) Will make again. Thanks!

This is my husband's new favorite dish.  I didn't add the peppers but it was delicious.  He said he could eat it once a week.  Great recipe!

We like this one a lot.  I made it with Turkey sausage and homemade cornbread.  Because cornbread is traditionally cooked at 425 for 20 minutes, I upped the temp to 400 and had to cook it for 30 minutes.

This was very good!  Made a slight adjustment though.  To add a bit more flavor I used Jimmy Dean BOLD sausage instead of ground beef.  It gave it a great zing to go with the sweetness of the creamed corn!

I didn't think his recipe was all that great.  All we could taste was the cornbread!  We won't make this one again.

Not a fan. It came together very nicely, had to Cook it for 45 min. Not sure why the recipe said 25 min. Lol looked nice but I just didn't care for the flavors.

First time making this recipe.  I followed the directions to a T, except where it says to use half the chopped onion in the hamburger mixture -- just where do you use the other half?
I became alarmed while I was preparing the cornbread mix, because it was very soupy, causing me to only use 1 cup of milk instead of the two called for in the directions.  I had to bake it over twice as long before it finally firmed up in the center.

RECIPE AS IS! I have been making this every few months ever since I found. It's a winner. I will say that in my experience, the recipe as is takes no less than 45  minutes to bake it through with a crispy brown top. Even then, the result is sort of moist for cornbread. I've used 3 different ovens to make this, so I'm not sure why  the discrepancy.  
MY EDITS! I like to add flour/cut the milk to give it a crumble consistency. Cheeses and vegetables are totally up to your preference.  Picky eaters won't notice bell peppers, zucchini, or mushrooms if you chop them in.

I couldn't taste the beef at all and it was too dry. If I make it again I'll add more sauce or gravy to the meat and put it down first instead of mixing it into the cornbread.

I didn't have a can of creamed corn so  I used some leftover ricotta cheese.  I didn't like the idea of the pickles, so instead I used some green pepper. I also added 1 more egg and  1/2 lb more of ground beef.  It took about twice as long baking time and for the last 5 minutes I had to increase the temperature to 375 degrees.  It worked out great.  There was a nice crispiness to  the bottom.  I usually have my family rate my cooking from 1 to 5.  I got three 4s and one 5!  They loved it.

Overall this was pretty good but I did make some minor changes. I added some taco seasoning plus a 1/2 bag of frozen onion, gr pepper & celery blend to the meat after it was browned. (Omitted the jalapeno and S&P.) I used the two boxes of cornbread mix but only 1 cup of milk. It was a little on the bready side so maybe a little additional milk is needed next time.

First time I made this with ground beef and it was rather bland, but since then I've made it with sausage instead and it's much more flavorful. I also add some garlic and hot sauce to the meat when cooking. Much better that way!

I make this recipe for dinner a couple times and my family likes it. Love cornbread and meat so it's all gooder. I don't have jalapenos but i just add some cajun spices and that's good.

We thought this was a very comforting and filling meal!  I omitted the pickled jalapeno and added a can of drained diced tomatoes with green chilies, plus I used a cup of cheddar in the corn bread mixture and sprinkled with an additional cup over the top.  Like others said, this definitely needs to cook about 45-50 minutes or it will be raw inside.

This is such a quick and easy recipe to whip up during the week.  I make a couple changes in that I used ground turkey and add a package of taco seasoning to the meat.  I also do not add the jalepenos, but that doesn't see to make a big difference.  Lastly, I set the temperature for 375 and cook for 25 minutes as that seems to work better than 350.

Good and easy!  I cut out the jalapenos, but added a small can of diced green chilies and taco seasoning with the ground beef.  I only used 1 3/4 boxes of corn muffin mix & 1 3/4 cup of milk.  Baked for 40 minutes with foil covering, then 10 minutes without.  Very good!

This was very filling.  I tweaked the recipe using other reviews for inspiration.  I doubled the meat, used mild green chiles and cooked 1/2 of them with the meat.  I seasoned the meat with lots of pepper, garlic salt and taco seasoning (1-1/2 packages).  I also added 1/2 cup cheddar cheese to the mixture and seasoned the whole thing up with more pepper, salt and garlic powder.  I cooked it for 25 minutes and then added the cup of cheese to the top and baked it for another 25 minutes. It still tasted a BIT bland and I normally don't salt my food but a dash of salt made it perfect.  My husband hasn't tried it yet but if he likes it, I will make it again!

While this sounded great, it is not a recipe I will do again.  At least not this way.  This took twice as long as the time it says to cook and it still was gummy.  The cornbread only completely cooked around the edges. :(  I added green chiles instead of jalapenos and some seasonings that my family liked and the taste was good...just wasn't cooked.  If I did do it again, I would cut it in half and use a 9x9 pan.

This recipe is very versatile and almost fool proof. I added a pack of taco seasoning to the meat after browning and 4 teaspoons of diced jalapeno slices.If you want the meat to have an extra kick I suggest doubling the teaspoons of chili. Only used 1 cup of milk for corn bread mix as others suggested. Then I layered bread,meat,cream corn and bread,then sprinkled the top with grated monterey jack cheese. Baked it for about an hour and it came out beautiful and marvelous! My husband and I went back for thirds and he said it tasted even better the next day.

We did not care for this at all which was disappointing because it sounded so good.  The center was gooey and the outside edges were dry after 25 minutes.  It had a very bland flavor and you could not even taste the ground meat in it.

I was excited about making this meal, but I wasn't excited about the outcome.  It is missing something and I don't know what!! Although we did eat it... it wasn't one of our favorite's. Sorry:(

I give it a 4 as is, but when I altered it, a definite 5 stars.  I followed advice of others and added spices to meat mixture (chili powder, cumin, mexican oregano, garlic)  reduced milk to 1 cup (I think that is the problem with it not getting done in time.  Added smoked green chiles to the meat mixture and cornbread (1/2 & 1/2)  Didn't mix the meat in with the cornbread, just put down half cornbread mixture (w/cheddar) and put meat on top of that and topped w/remaining cornbread.  Baked 25 min and it was perfectly done.  Will make again using maybe chicken or even diced ham.  So many possibilities with this one.

Love this recipe!  My husband went back for 3rds and took the leftovers to work the next day.  I did put taco seasoning in the meat and added more jalapenos.  Will definately make again.

Very Good!!  Get a 4 star because it takes about 45 minutes to cook, not the 20 listed.  Can't wait to flavor the beef with different seasonings.  Will make again!

This one was ok.  A little bland.  The hubby added ketchup for his flavor.  The 13yr old boy loved it and went back for 3rds.

My family really liked this dish. Yet the cooking time seems to be off. I used a 9x13 pan, but cooked it for over 45 minutes. Great taste. Added a few spices to meat too.
