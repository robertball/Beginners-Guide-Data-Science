Nice chocolate-y butter cookie.  Simple to make and cooked perfectly in 8 minutes.  
Definitely will be saving this one for the Holidays.  Thanks Christy for sharing your recipe.

This is a great recipe when made with a few tweaks. Having made many bathes of Spritz over he years,  
I added a bit more liquid ingredients to this recipe. Firstly,  I added 2 Tbsp milk along with my vanilla & the added 2 tsp of Peppermint Extract to give these cookies a bit more flavor. For those who are finding this recipe to be a bit crumbly I'd recommend adding the 2 Tbsp of Milk, as the milk will make the dough softer and easier to push though your cookie Press. As a general rule you want your dough to be soft, but still somewhat firm so that the shapes will come out properly when pressed. Overall, great recipe & very flavorful with the peppermint added.

They taste chalky, not chocolatey, and I even left out a little bit of the flour.  Disappointed.

Easy and delicious. The chocolate flavor was stronger than anticipated, which I love.  Dough became too thick for the KitchenAid and stuck along the sides at the end, so did that last mixing by hand.

The dough  kept sticking to the press. I followed the directions religiously. Don't know why that was, but I don't think I'll be making these again. I was planning giving some to a friend, but now I will eat them all myself.

I made this recipe according to tge directions. They were perfect! Only thing I changed was I used almond extract instead of vanilla only because I had no vanilla. I have saved this recipe to my desktop on my phone so I can make it again!

My old electric cookie press just wouldn't work properly this Christmas so I looked at reviews and settled on the Marcato Biscuit (cookies elsewhere in the world) maker.  I wanted to try chocolate spritz  for my husband.  This recipe caught my attention, and after reading the reviews I decided to try it.  I did use 2 tablespoons of milk, 2 teaspoons vanilla and only about 2-1/2 cups flour.  The dough seemed a little sticky but I went with it.  It went through my new cookie press like a dream!  The taste is good, but I would prefer more chocolate so next time I'm going to try more cocoa.  Otherwise, these are pretty good "biscuits".

i tried this with coconut butter. it was reasonable on my press and tasted okay with 2 cups of flour instead of 3 1/4 cups. the picture here is with 3 cups and an extra 4 tbs of coconut oil, and one pan of cookies was all i could press out before my press gave up. i balled the rest up and baked it like a regular cookie.

I followed the recipe, but these turned out pretty dry. The dough was a little tough on my cookie press, too. They were tasty, so I'm going to try the recipe again and make some changes in the proportions of ingredients to see if I can work it out, because the recipe has potential. I just don't love them.
