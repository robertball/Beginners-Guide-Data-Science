Very good, nice change of pace to fresh fruit without making a fruit salad.  The combination of the cream cheese and mashmallows was great.

thank you so much for putting the picture which inspired me to try this. IT WAS AMAZING. in my opinion it was just as good as a regular fatty real banana split. i ditched the fake marshmellow stuff and used vanilla and a tiny bit of brown sugar instead. mangos were amazing in there. i hope others are inspired to try this.
