My family really enjoyed this recipe.  We added purple onion because we believe the holy trinity of southwest cooking is jalapenos, cilantro and onions.

A great blending of ingredients.  I've been on a coleslaw kick lately, having tried a number of new coleslaw recipes.  This recipe is not the best I've had, but it's very good.  It's still coleslaw, but with a fun and adventuresome Tex-Mex twist.  It was a bit dry upon first mix, but after adding a dab of extra ranch dressing and after it sat for awhile, it became plenty "wet."  So, I may not have needed to add more ranch dressing after all.  The kick is about right for me.  Please note:  The cilantro flavor is prominent, nearly dominating the taste.  Like my wife, if you aren't a fan of cilantro--reduce it or leave it out.  I'm not a big fan of cilantro, but in this salad--it just works.

This was really great--I'd give it five stars, but I think my adjustments made it a five, not the recipe.  I used frozen corn, fresh chopped green pepper and onion instead of the canned corn and added about a 1/4 cup of salsa to the sauce.  It was all so crunchy and spicy.  By husband couldn't stop eating it.

This is absolutely the BEST!!! My husband NEVER liked any slaw, but he LOVES this one. Everybody asked for the recipe at the BBQ.
I made it with NO-FAT Ranch, and LOW-FAT Cheese, added 2 tbl.spoons of NO-FAT sour cream and 1 tbl.spoon of SPLENDA. AWESOME!!!

This was really different and good. I also added some onion to the recipe.  It definitely is better after sitting 24 hours, liked much better than eating right away. Nice change of pace from regular coleslaw.

This was really good, and different. I'm not a big cole slaw fan but this is not like cole slaw. My boyfriend wasn't as crazy about it though. I made barbecue beef to go with it and he was to busy eating that.

This recipe was pretty good, but no out of this world - I would decrease the dressing by 1/4 cup (I used Maries lite ranch and it was too creamy for my taste). I only had one jalapeno available, and I think that it definitely could benefit with the suggested amount of two jalapenos.

This is excellent!  I believe NOTHING should be left out.  I used fat free ranch and it was wonderful.  The ingredients blend so well and for those worried about the jalapeno, I chopped them fine and it wasn't overwhelming.  This slaw should be eaten the day it is made, in my opinion.  The leftovers were not as good.

Two thumbs up from both my husband and our dinner guests (one of which is also a chef!)  Excellent recipe!  I served it with an Enchilada Pie and it went perfect with it!   I had to add a bit more of the spices to the dressing because we kept tasting it and were only getting the flavor of Ranch dressing.  I also left out the cheese.  Can't wait for a potluck so I can bring it and receive the compliments!

My family loves traditional cole slaw and this is very different, but all agreed it was a nice change. Didn't have a fresh jalapeno, so used the kind from a jar -- chopped about a tablespoon.  Will add a bit more next time.

I was looking for a recipe to use up our cabbage from the garden and found this. I did make a few changes such as adding Chipolte white corn and subing Chilies for Jalapenos. With my first bite I immediatly thought Shrimp Tacos! So we made that and fish tacos. It was a home run!! Would also bet this would be good on a BBQ sandwich. This recipe is a keeper!

Loved this one.  Everyone enjoyed the change.  If everything is cold I will wait to mix just before serving.  Cheese got a little soft this last time.

Very Yummy. I used reduced fat ranch dressing.. and less of it, fat free cheddar and only one jalepeno pepper. I think I went a bit heavier on the spices than the recipe called for. I'll be making this again as it's a nice change from traditional coleslaw

Excellent.  Made this for a party at the river.  BIG hit.  I found a spicy ranch dressing, so I used that and omitted the spices at the end.  It had a nice kick to it.

This is the best slaw ever!  I will never fix another kind again. I added a tad of "Slap ya Mama" (cajun seasoning) and now it is a fridge staple...like hot mustard...our family eats it ON hotdogs and hamburgers...the Pittsburgh way!

Our family was bored of the same ol' slaw...(i.e. marzetti's and cabbage) I'm always cruising for something new, this was the perfect answer!! I would also recommend lightening up on the cilantro. I used fresh and it was way too strong.  I also left out the lime and jalapeno's, and it was still pretty fantastic! It's bright, crunchy and with the unexpected heat...a delicious twist for boring slaw!

I was looking for a spicy coleslaw and sadly this missed the mark. Just tastes like ranch and jalapenos- a spicy, soggy salad.

Tried something new for tailgating, followed the recipe exactly as written and nobody really cared for it.  Oh well, everyone has different tastes - you win some and lose some.  Still, thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe for slaw.  Made as written with addition of red onion for a little extra flavor and crunch.  Paired with Busy Day brisket and was a wonderful meal.  thanks for a twist on the usual ho-hum slaw.  will make again!

I pretty much used this recipe as a guide, and just eyeballed the different ingredients so it was how we wanted. I used 2 very large jalapenos, maybe half a cup of Ranch dressing, and most of 15.25 oz can of Mexican style corn. It definitely improves if you let it refrigerate for a couple of hours. Thanks!

Great! My husband, who doesn't ever eat cole slaw, raved about this recipe.  Made for a large party, 40 people, and many commented on this side dish.  Easy to make, delicious and unexpected.  A keeper!

Loved it. I didn't have any ranch dressing (and I don't like Cole Slaw too creamy) so added about a 1/8 cup mayo and 1/8 cup sour cream. Some dill, parsley and pepper and it was delicious. I also boiled 4 cobs of corn and sliced all of it into the salad so it was quite bulked up and really good.

This recipe was such a downer. I was so excited to make this for my boyfriend and myself. I love one jalapeno slaw in particular and thats what made me start searching for one. This just tasted like ranch dressing. It wasn't spicey. I followed the recipe exactly and once i threw the dressing and the cheese in I knew we were in trouble. Very bland and boring

This is not your standard cole slaw recipe, that is for sure!  This was an exceptionally nice change of pace!  I did alter the recipe a tad, subbing chipotle white corn for the Mexicorn, adding an additional jalapeno, omitting the coriander, using a spicy ranch, and doubling down on the cilantro.  I will be making this again.  Next time, I will be sure not to seed the jalapenos and might add some black beans into it as well.  Not quite a 5-star recipe, but not far from it!  Thank you, CINP!

I made this slaw because it sounded pretty tasty, I don't like regular slaw and thought this might be a good option.  I made my own reduced fat ranch dressing and added a little salt and black pepper.  I also cut the cilantro in half.  My husband really liked it and said it should be in our bbq rotation.  I can't wait to try it out on the family at our annual camping trip this summer!!!!

2 jalapenos too much. VERY spicy.I love it spicy but if making for a crowd,use only 1 jalapeno to appease everyone. also cut back some on cilantro if not cilantro taste overwhelming. very good cole slaw! added onions. good recipe but just cut back on jalapenos!!!

Great coleslaw recipe! I add some chopped red onion, and some chopped bacon to the recipe along with a little of the lime zest. Make sure to make this ahead of time to let the flavors blend.

I am not a huge cole slaw fan but I like this recipe!  It has good flavor and it's not too 'hot' either, even though it has two jalapenos in it.  Have made it for company a couple of times and has been a big hit.

I have been using this recipe for about 10 years.  It's great for gatherings as it makes plenty for a side dish.  A big hit every time I serve it. We love cilantro and always add extra.  I am surprised to see such few reviews because this is definitely a keeper!

This recipe takes slaw to a whole new level.  I was a little skeptical about the ingredients but decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did. It went prefectly with our barbequed ribs and chicken. Yum Yum!

I am always asked to bring this slaw to all of our family gatherings.  I have made it following the directions and have also made it with jalapeno ranch dressing instead of the regualar ranch and omitting the fresh jalapenos.  Tastes great both ways!

I was really not expecting to like this recipe, but felt compelled to try it based on the reviews. I am really glad I did. It's a very good cole slaw. The only thing I did to deviate from the the original recipe was to use fresh corn, rather than canned. Fast. Easy. Unique. Flavorful. Winner. Thanks CINP!

We all really liked this.  I did have to make it with Ceasar dressing as I was out of ranch but I'm sure it would have been just as good with ranch.  I used two really large seeded minced jalapenos and it wasn't too spicy at all.  I also added half an onion and used ordinary tinned corn because that is what I had.  Thanks so much.  We will be making this often!

This is a wonderful Recipe.  You can do whatever you want to it!  I bought 8 oz cold slaw bags and used the dressing in the bag - updating it with the recipe spices.  I also used ranch and subsituted jalapenos for green chiles.  Wonderful all the way around!

I wasn't impressed. I felt like it needed 'something'  but neither my husband nor myself could figure out what. Maybe something crunchy like chopped fresh cucumber? And I like Ranch, but not particularly with slaw.

As others have said, this is not your typical coleslaw. This is very different and tasty. I love cilantro and this is yet another dish that I can enjoy it in. We've nicknamed this "Cowboy Coleslaw" in my house.

Very good!!  I would probably add another two or three jalapenos next time, just to spice it up a bit more.  I used "light" ranch dressing & 2% shredded cheddar to cut down on the fat and it was fantastic - a nice change from some of the sticky sweet cole slaws.

I really liked this salad. I didn't use the Mexican style corn, bur a fire roasted instead. I like the lime and cilantro. If too soggy, you may have used too much salad dressing. a little goes a long way as the cabbage gives off a lot of water.  Goes great with brisket  and barbecue.

Even my husband loved this. I used red and green cabbage and added a little more cumin because I felt like it was missing something. It was. I forgot the garlic powder. :(  
They didn't Mexican corn at the store. Weird, huh? It used to be easy to find everywhere. So, I used frozen corn, thawed, and red and green bell peppers that I already had chopped and recipe-ready. And while I was looking for the Mexican corn, I found Ranch-Bacon dressing so I used that. Good call. 
This was a nice twist on slaw and I'll be making it again.

the first time I tried this recipe it was a big hit with family and friends.   I have made it many times since and it is the choice of coleslaw for us!  Great with fried fish, barbecues, and hamburgers/hot dogs.  I sometimes will use a a spicier ranch dressing for added kick!  This is a keep.

This was a BIG hit at our BBQ today!  Everyone liked the change from the usual slaw and wanted the recipe.  I'm not a slaw lover but I really enjoyed this recipe. I definitely will fix this one again but  I do think I will cut back just a tad on the cumin.

i had high hopes for this recipe but unfortunately agree with abelle's review.. it was basically ranch and *cilantro* to me.. i'm glad i only made a half portion of this.. trying to make this pop i doubled the cumin, coriander seed, and lime juice.. added 1/4 a red onion, an extra jalapeno, and 1/2 a green bell pepper.. and a good amount of cajun flavored sea salt and black pepper.. i used shredded mexican cheese for the cheddar and think it really helped this cole slaw out.. i much prefer Creamy Spiced Coleslaw (from this site) and will stick to that from now on

I am not a huge slaw fan but my husband is.  We found this recipe and make it all the time as a summer side dish.   Easy and great flavor!

I used about 3/4 cup ranch and 1/4 cup sour cream. Couldn't find mexi-corn so I used fresh corn. Delicious! Nice change from ordinary coleslaw

This slaw went really well with a batch of creamy and spicy chicken, but on it's own we felt it was unbalanced and needed less lime and a bit more ranch flavor.  It just didn't have enough going on it's own for us to make again.

I liked this and will make it again.  I thought it was weird putting cheese in slaw but it was fine.  It's a nice change from plain coleslaw.

I have made this many times and it is always a hit.  I've chosen to use sharp cheddar cheese and I usually use a Southwest style Ranch dressing for some extra kick.

This is the best slaw I've ever had!  I add a bit more jalapeño and didn't have any coriander and it turned out awesome.

Mighty tasty! I shredded 16 oz cabbage rather than using the bagged stuff, and used fresh corn from two cobs, 1/4 cup red onion and the zest of the lime. It's not too spicy, not too bland, and certainly not traditional. It's mighty tasty!

Have made this recipe at least 10 times in the past few years, and even slaw haters have loved it!  It doubles nicely for larger events.  I use the yogurt based ranch dressing (found near fresh produce in refrigerated section) instead of the traditional ranch dressing.

Excellent!!! As recommended by others I used frozen corn and then added 1/4 cup of salsa to the dressing. Unique but delicious taste.

Kudos to the Texan chefs who inspired, I presume, this outstanding recipe.  I cut back on the ranch dressing as others mentioned and it was an amazing slaw that I 'hotted' up a bit with more jalapenos.  Thanks so much.  I just know this will be one of my regulars at potlucks and BBQ's this summer.

Delicious! I didn't have Mexican corn so I lightly sauteed some frozen corn with some chopped green peppers, cooled them and tossed them into the salad. Also, I didn't have coriander so I omitted that, but I had everything else, and we all loved this salad! Next time I may decrease the ranch a little as the salad was a little wetter than I like, but it's just a matter of personal taste, this recipe is a definite keeper! Thank you!

This was pretty good, although I prefer a basic mayo coleslaw - my hubby however has never cared for any kind of coleslaw & refuses to eat it, and he actually had a big helping of this.  Instead of jalepeno peppers, I used fresh cayenne & red hot cherry peppers from my garden.

This is yummy!  I didn't have coriander and didn't miss it.  I took the advice of others and added some sour cream.
