I also added yellow squash and zucchini. Mine marinated from 9 to 5. Next time it will be easier to cut veggies, skewer and then marinate. This way I won't cut too many onions and not enough mushrooms. Plus if they marinate already on skewers, it is easy to pop from fridge to oven (or grill). Don't forget to spray Pam on skewers for veggies to easily slide off. I put veggies skewers in oven at 350 for 15 minutes before putting in shrimp skewers.

These were delicious and easy.  I wanted something a little different and these were great.  I made extra skewers of just the marinated veggies too.  I wasn't crazy about the tomatoes because they got a little mushy.  I think that next time I will just leave them off although I love the red color they add.  I think I will use some red pepper in their place.

I also used non fat italian dressing.  I also went back and fourth with shrimp and scallops.  YUM!  This is a very healthy recipe, and I will make again.  I did my tomatoes on a separte rod.  They do get mushy.  Be very careful not to over cook, as nothing is worse than dry rubbery shrimp and scallops. Everything cooks just a bit faster when you marinate.  Thanks for this.

Yummy!  I'll make this next week for company!  DH didn't have the grill hot enough so it took a little longer and I didn't get grill marks - but next time I'll man the grill or have him put the veggies on before the shrimp.

Absolutely amazing! Wow, what a simple and flavorful recipe. I used zesty italian and added minced garlic. I also used red bellpeppers rather than green because we Hate green peppers! Threading the vegetables on a separate skewer than the shrimp is a good idea because the vegetables need to cook much longer than the shrimp. All in all, a fantastic summer recipe. Thank you! FYI: the shrimp were fresh off a shrimpboat on the coast of Georgia so that could have had something to do with the outstanding flavor ;o) I love living on the coast!

Great recipe. I was stuck without one of the ingredients decribed in the recipe, so I substituted the tomatoes with the fruit in season at the momment which is peaches! Everyone loved it. The peaches went perfectly with the shrimp. I marinated the peaches along with the veggies. I'll make this one again.

First kabobs I've ever made and were wonderful!  Everyone prepared their own kabob as per their taste, with options of green peppers, onions, mushrooms (also marinated in dressing), and pineapple chunks.

How fun! I loved making this! It was a great thing to make with kids, and it smelled SO good while it was grilling. I also sprinkled some chilli powder on each for a spicier taste. Fabulous!

These were really good. I used a garlic/ herb marinade instead of the Italian salad dressing & added squash, red bell peppers (omitted the tomatoes cause I read they get mushy). They came out beautifully & was a hit with my whole family. Seeing as how I was at a BBQ & I no longer eat red meat (which was being served) this was perfect! Definitely going to make these again soon!!!!

Pretty good.  Very easy.  I wasn't able to marinate mine for the full 2 hours, and they still had plenty of flavor.  Also - be careful not to overcook.  You don't want the shrimp becoming rubbery (like TGI Friday's type of shrimp).

I didn't feel like cracking out the grill so I cooked this on the stove and in the oven.  I put 1 cup of Italian salad dressing in the bag with the veggies and 1/2 cup with the shrimp.  I also only used one onion and added some red bell pepper. I threaded the veggies on skewers after they'd been marinating for a few hours and placed them in the oven at 350 (on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray - the skewers were sprayed first too) to cook for 25 mins.   I turned them over at 15.   I sauteed the shrimp for a few minutes on the stove when the veggies were almost done.  Pretty good flavor.  Next time I may add a few things like a little salt or a lot of garlic to make it a bit more "wow" but overall pretty good.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I used fat free dressing to marinate the shrimp and veggies to keep the calories down.  The most time consuming part was putting the food on to the skewers... but, they cooked up fast and were delish so it was worth it!

This was so bland!  I made it for Mother's Day and we were all disappointed.  Next time I will mix chicken, steak and other vegetables, plus another type of marinades.  In other words, I am sure there are much better recipes on here!

These were very flavorful. Instead of Onions and Peppers our kabobs were with mushrooms, tomatoes and green and yellow zucchini.

This was my first time ever making shrimp kabobs, which was probably not the greatest idea when I had planned on doing over 100 kabobs for a party!! But these actually turned out great!! I used the general recipe, but tweaked it a little to fit my preferences and from others' reviews. 

The main thing I think that helped with the flavor was the Italian dressing marinade, though from some of the reviews saying it was bland, I decided to DOUBLE the marinade time.  I also chopped up a handful of GARLIC and chopped some BASIL for extra flavor.  It turned out amazing and I got tons of compliments! I also did without the tomatoes and mushrooms. I skewered yellow onion, red/orange bellpeppers, and pineapple (which I also marinaded in a separate bag).

I made this and marinated it for the two hours indicated in the recipe.  I used red, yellow and orange bell peppers along with the onion and mushrooms.  I purposely didn’t use the tomatoes because I knew they would get mushy in the amount of time it would take to cook the other veggies.  I skewered my shrimp separately from the veggies so my shrimp had no chance of over cooking.  This was good, but I did think it turned out rather bland.   If I were to make this again, I’d marinate longer and I might also baste with some additional salad dressing, hoping to boost the flavor.

Amazing recipe, has become a staple in my home.  I make it every time I have guests b/c most of it can be prepared beforehand, and when it's time to put them on the grill, it only takes around 15 minutes.

Very good flavor for an easy to make recipe. First time I made these was for about a dozen people. They all liked it very well. I put them on wooden skewers...what do you soak them in to make the stuff easier to slide on/off?

Another reviewer did the vegetables separate and for a longer period of time. That just makes sense, shrimp cook much more quickly; I also make my own dressing of 1 C Extra Virgin Olive oil, about 1 oz balsamic vinegar, 5 cloves garlic, 3/4 t salt, ~ 10 whole black peppercorns and 2 T Parmesan, 1 t Basil, Oregano, blend until smooth.



Plus if you marinate something for 2 hours, it can't possibly have a prep time of 35 minutes.

Yummy! Used red onion, baby bella mushrooms, green and red peppers. Also made Good Seasons Italian dressing and was able to decrease the oil content to cut fat. Very nice on the grill for Good Friday! Thanks!

Easy yet tasty. I added yellow zucchini cut in 1/2 inch pie es for a little more color. Cooks a loot quicker versus pork, chicken or beef. Although I'm sure it'd taste just as good with italian dressing soaked for the sane time if not a little longer or even over night.
