For the next few days, I'm on an elimination diet(Doctor's orders). That means I can't eat virtually anything. Somehow, this dish is alright for me to eat. Wow! I can't believe how great it tastes. I've never had a chickpea dish with flavors this rich -- and without any fatty coconut milk. My substitutions: I used a lot (roughly 2T) of garam masala instead of the spices listed here, since it's a comparable blend, and dried cranberries for half of the raisins (didn't seem to make much a difference). -- yum! Next time, I might double the sweet potato or even add butternut squash. So tasty and fragrant -- My boyfriend said it smells like Christmas in here.

This was a delicious, healthy and easy recipe. It takes awhile to simmer, but the prep work isn't intensive. The yams, pears and raisins add a nice sweetness-- but it's not overly sweet. It packs quite a punch, though, so if you don't like it spicy, cut down on the cayenne. I used a 32oz. container of vegetable broth from the store instead of the boullion, and forgot to include the cilantro, but it turned out lovely. The dish was great paired with naan bread. Definitely a keeper!

This was super tasty! Even my meat-eating family enjoyed it. I made coconut rice to  go with it, which balanced the flavors very nicely. I used chicken broth instead of the veggie bullion and used 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon instead of the sticks. I also added some cubed potatoes and summer squash. The flavor was mild, but still very tasty. I think next time I will add more cayenne.

Excellent recipe-I doubled the pears and yams, substituted 1 teaspoon cinnamon for the cinnamon sticks and reduced the cayenne to 1/2 a teaspoon. Not overly sweet-just wonderful and do not double or you will be  
able to feed the whole neighborhood.Makes  
plenty as written.

Excellent recipe. I took about a cup of the mixture and put it in the blender to thicken the dish. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

So flavorful but just a tad too spicy with that much cayenne . . . and my family likes things spicy. Still, it's a 5-star recipe. And it feels good eating something so healthy that even the kids will gobble up.

This was an excellent vegetarian curry!  I a great blend of sweet/spicy/savory.  Just watch out for the cayenne pepper, it was almost TOO spicy for my dad. Without any dairy or meat I was amazed at how good it tasted!  Definitely going to be a keeper.

This was fine, but I was underwhelmed compared to all the glowing reviews. Not sure if I will make it again.

Really yummy!  I threw in a cup or so of cooked white Northern beans that I had in the freezer, because I didn't have quite enough chick peas;  & I omitted the coriander, because I didn't have any.  Didn't matter at all -- this turned out absolutely scrumptious!  What a great recipe!

Very flavorful.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  The combination of spices and flavors was new and interesting.  It was a little on the hot side which I like, but if you don't, you might want to use less ceyenne pepper.  Relative to other middle eastern/indian dishes it was fairly easy to make.  Definitely a keeper!

This was on the sweet side but I tempered it by putting it over brown rice.  Nice blend of flavors.  Would pair it with a meat that would have simple spices or it would be a poor match in competing tastes.  I did use half of the cayenne after reading the reviews but I might add the other half in when reheating today.  We love yams and this was a nice, new and interesting way to serve them.

I always double or triple this recipe and have made it many times.  I played with the cayenne the first few times and no matter how little I put in, I just am not a fan of cayenne and so now I just leave it out.  All the flavour without any heat which is the way I like it. This recipe stands up to freezing and reheating very well.

So wonderful I made it again right away! If you like spicy follow exactl. I didn't have fresh pears so I used canned ones and I though it worked perfectly. The second time I made it I was down to one can of chickpeas so I doubled the sweet potato. My husband preferred it, I thought it was really woderful both times, I can't wait to make it again!

Smelled lovely and I liked the addition of the yam and pear.  I didn't have any coriander so I used a teaspoon of curry powder in addition to the other spices; unfortunately I didn't have cayenne either so mine could have been hotter.  Easy to make and yummy, though!

I've made a lot of curry recipes at home from scratch and this is the first one that I've liked.  Quite sweet as opposed to hot.

Delicious!!  I kept the cayenne amount as listed, and thought it was just the right amount of spiciness.  I added some cashews to the recipe as well.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Really yummy.  I used dried black currants instead of raisins.  I also halved the cayenne, but I don't think it needed to be halved.  It wasn't too hot.

No yams or pears in the house, so I made it with an apple and cut the recipe in half. Due to other reviews, I cut the cayenne in 1/4 and it was plenty spicy for a Midwestern palate.  Looked great and tasted better.

I didn't have ginger nor cloves, substituted paprika for cayenne and sprinkled cinnamon instead of using cinnamon sticks.  I also used a large sweet potato instead of a yam.  With these changes, it is good but a little too sweet, even after adding salt, and I had cut down on the raisins.  I used jarred chickpeas so only simmered for 30 minutes.  Next time, I'll use a little less water, because it's a little watery, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, and try a regular potato to balance the sweetness.  I also suggest serving over rice.

This tasted pretty good but I agree with others: it is spicy, pretty sweet and has too many raisins.

delicious!  i used ginger powder, and reduced the raisins to 1/3c.  I will add a little more next time.  I reduced the cayanne to 1/2stp, but it was still over powering.  I like spice, but the sweet got covered up a lot.

I really liked the complexity of flavours that the cinnammon ginger and pear brought to the dish, however I found that 1 cup of raisins was too much, and the sweet "raisinee" taste started annoying me 1/2 way through a serving.  I think next time I would cut it back to 1/2cup to 3/4 at the most

I left out the cilantro because I personally don't care for it but this recipe isn't missing a thing without it.  Mine took more like an hour and a half of simmering to really get the flavors infused; I even chopped the yam and pear in the food processor to speed the process.  Served w/ pita bread as I didn't have time to bake naan, but will do so next time.  Delicious and so good for you!

I only had one can of chickpeas so I added a cup of TVP which turned out fine. It wasn't like other curries I've had which were more like a thick sauce. This was more of just a bunch of spicy veggies. I'm nore sure how I liked the raisins in this, and if you don't like hot heat cut down on the cayenne.

I substituted black currants for the raisins. My wife found it to be too hot with the spices added as directed. I liked the heat, though a bit less cayenne might have enabled some of the other interesting flavors to emerge more.

This was yummy. I doubled the pears and halved the cayenne pepper. I will definitely eat again. NOTE: The default picture looks like soup, but it comes out thicker the longer you cook it. I found the consistency to be fine without blending. Next time I might try cooking it all in one pot--seems silly to have a separate pot just for the broth.

So delicious! never made curry before, but this tasted like the real deal X3. i didn't have minced ginger, so i ended up using ground ginger from the spice aisle. i also tend to like thick, creamy curries, so i added some half and half and flour to get it there :D

My husband and I didn't care for this. A little too spicy. FYI The curry is an Indian stye curry, not a Thai style curry.

I made this last night in my pressure cooker. WOW is all I can say. I had to sustitute a can of butter beans because I didnt have 2 cans of garbanzo beans and had to also substitute a finely chopped apple because my husband ate all the pears. This recipe came out fabulous. I might cut back on the raisins a little next time just to see how it would taste. The cayenne pepper gives it just the right kick. FABULOUS - thank you :)

This was delicious!  I didn't have everything on hand, so I used what I had: cauliflower instead of yam, and no pear.  I also only put a sprinkle of the cayenne so my little kids would eat it.  1 tsp is a lot of heat!  It didn't thicken up much after cooking it for an hour, so I added a little cornstarch.  Served over coconut milk rice and it was absolutely delicious.  It's a very versatile recipe, but next time I'll try adding the yam & pear in.

very good, I just altered a few things... 1. I used garam masala for the spices 2. I got impatient and nuked the yams for 6 minutes then added  cornstarch to get it to thicken up. 3. I added vegi chicken 
tasty!

This was great - it is a little on the sweet side, but a fantastic change to our recipe repertoire.  Very hearty -  you will not miss not eating meat with this.  I served with rice.

This was very good. Better than expected. Made a TON of Curry. I served it with thai lemon grass rice. I loved all the flavors and was really impressed with the sweet potato and pear tastes. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because my toddler and husband weren't big fans and I think the best reciepes are the ones EVERyONE loves. :)

Very easy to prepare, and  delicious. I simmer only about 40 minutes, till veg was tender, since I was in a bit of a hurry. Thickened it with a little cornstarch. Also added 1/2 cup of goat's milk. Served it over rice, and my husband loved it.

I didn't really like this, I prefer more of a gravy than this provided. I thought it was a little bland and the chickpeas had to be put back on the stove for a while since they were undercooked.

mmm.. this was SO good!  The cilantro at the end really helped round out the flavor, and the sweetness of the pears and raisins really went well with the spiciness of the dish.  We ate it with onion nan and brown rice.  definitely a recipe I will be making again!

Made this last night for dinner and it was spectacular.  The aroma it fills the house with is incredible.  I tend to play with the recipes, but this is perfect as is.  Tonight I added chicken breast to the dish, and it was fabulous served with naan.  Don't be afraid of the ingredients, they meld perfectly.

Seriously good!  I cubed butternut squash and yukon gold potatoes instead of the yams.  (only cause I used what I had) I just added minced garlic to the pot and minused the ginger altogether.  Usually not a fan of cinnamon, but it works in this recipe.  Also substituted golden raisins for the regular ones...(my husband eats them like candy.)  Deelish :)

Delicious. I followed exactly as submitted.   Very nice blend of sweet and spicy. I think I'll use potatoes instead of a yam the next time to give it a little more balance. I served with naan, also from this site. fantastic combo. i'll definitely make this dish again.

I liked this recipe except for finding it a bit spicy, despite cutting the cayenne in 1/2, and the fact that it was more a soup than a stew.  Also, I didn't like the cooked raisins, and there were a lot of them.  I might make this again, but altet

I have made this recipe numerous times!  It is a total favourite.  The first time, both my husband and grand daughter didn't want to try it (they said they didn't care for chickpeas and I had made many other Indian dishes for that particular meal), well, I insisted, and they BOTH had seconds!  I just forwarded the recipe to my strand daughter to make for a vegan potluck this weekend.

Way too spicy for my liking. I couldn't really get a flavor but my husband liked it a lot. I will cut back on the cayenne pepper next time.
