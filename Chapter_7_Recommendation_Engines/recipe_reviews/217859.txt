This turned out wonderfully! A very simple salad, with healthy ingredients. I made a slightly larger version and used spicy pepperoni as I already had some on hand. Great recipe!!! The only change I might make would be to use a light Italian dressing or something along those lines as the balsamic made the lettuce darker than I would have liked it to look. I made mine in a clear bowl as my platters were already in use. Next time I will be sure to put it on the platter as I think it would look nicer.

This salad is perfect for a party!  I love the presentation!  The different ingredients can be prepped the day before for quick / easy assembly the day of.  Also, easy to have a guest arrange the platter if someone asks what they can do to help!  I love how everyone can pick what toppings they want on their salad.  The dressing is perfect as well!  I served it on the side, so again the guests could decide how much they would like!  Thanks for sharing!

Was a great filler for those who were hungry.  Plan lots of prep time.  Now I know why caterers charge the big bucks.  Lots of chopping.  Love this presentation, I added a few other veggies as well.

Wonderful addition to an Italian dinner.  It looks so pretty on the table served in a platter and everyone can pick out the ingredients they want.

I made this the other night for a party and it was a HUGE hit!!!! Alot of positive comments about the artichokes, which I felt myself was different from other antipastos I have had. I followed this recipe, and doubled everything and glad I did. I was debating if I should toss everything in a bowl, but I am glad I didnt because people got to pick and choose their own. I will definitely keep this in my favorites and keep making it!

Perfect party salad.  Looks great and keeps food separated for guests with different preferences. Loved the dressing too!  Got many compliments. Will definitely make again.

This was tasty and easy!  I created a bed of saIad rather than an island and then added marinated asparagus spears and marinated green beans as well as pepperoncinis and cubed sharp cheddar. I separated each with the red bell pepper strips. When I served it to the table everybody gasped and went on about how beautiful and delicious it was. It was a real hit. strangely the first to go was the blanched broccoli drizzled with  vinaigrette. As the salad was taken more was under the veggies. I'll do this one again and again.

Love the recipe. Since my husband's family is a bit on the picky side, I left the lettuce undressed. I also used roasted red peppers in lieu of the slices.
