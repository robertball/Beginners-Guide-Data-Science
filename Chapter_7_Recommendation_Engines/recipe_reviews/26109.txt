I was looking for a soft cake/cookie and this recipe was PERFECT.  I love these cookies.  I did add a little more sugar and some vanilla flavoring and they turned out great.  They aren't super sweet by themselves, but that makes the icing compliment them really well.

oh this was a disaster!
it was simple enough to make, i added some vanilla and almond extract because i figured they'd be bland otherwise. the dough was gooey when i finished, but i tried anyway. the cookies didn't flatten or spread out at all. they just puffed up, so i had these big, round cookies. they had an icky, crumbly, dry, dense texture and tasted like absolutely nothing. i can't believe how many people got good results. maybe i did something wrong. either way, this was the worst cookie disaster i ever had. i had to throw out all the cookies-- so many ingredients wasted!

I hated these cookies.  They didn't flatten at all, so I had big round ball cookies.  They also had really no flavor, kind of like a ball of moist flour.  I almost threw the batter out, but since it was cold in the house I decided to keep the oven running and cook the rest of them as a treat for our 3 dogs.  I just wish I hadn't used up my ingredients!

The cookies did not flatten and they were tasteless.  Sugar cookie...hmmm, shouldn't they be sweet?! The flour in this receipe was definitely the focal point of flavor!

These are great!  I love the texture and the crumb.  My dough wasn't too thick, in fact I had to add about 1/2 cup more flour.  I used Crisco instead of margarine and added 1 tsp of salt.  I also added 1 tsp Almond Extract and 2 tsps Vanilla.  The secret to these cookies is to beat the shortning, sugar and eggs until fluffy!  Only stir in the flour.  These are fantastic! Thank you Heidi.

I tried this recipe for the first time and I was extremely disappointed with the results. The cookies were extremely bland, even after I added vanilla. I didn't use half the dough after my friend tried them and agreed that they weren't very good. It ended up wasting a good amount of my time (it took 17 mins to cook 6 cookies) and a lot of flour. I will not be using this recipe again.

These are very tasty but extremely difficult to store.  They have to be stored seperately otherwise they stick together.

This is Heidi the poster of the original recipe.  I just want to say that these cookies are definitely a regional thing.  I live in Amish country of PA and we like things bread-y here.  The cookies are certainly not meant to be eaten without the frosting as they are kind of plain by themselves.  I must say, though, I love the idea of turning the plain cookies into shortcakes.  Thank you for the idea.  I'm glad that most people have enjoyed them.

I loved this recipe. The cookies were sooo fluffy. My family enjoyed them with their tea. They are not overly sweet. They would be great with whip cream and strawberries.

This is a great recipe. Just like the iced cookies you buy at the store but better. These are not meant to be eaten without the frosting. I did add vanilla to the dough as I like that flavor running through the cookie too. 9 minutes in a convection oven.

Big and soft, but not much taste- more like a shortcake than a sugar cookie. I guess the frosting would make it, but no one likes frosting here.

I was shocked when I saw the poor reviews on these cookies.  I looked up the recipe again a second time to make them at my parent's house.  My kids and my husband both LOOOOVE these cookies. They are the perfect cookie for holidays or birthdays instead of cupcakes or cakes.  I make my own buttercream icing and add extract or food coloring depending on what I'm making the cookies for - St. Patty's, Valentine's, Easter.  They are so yummy... fluffy, not too sweet, perfect for kids!

Heidi, thankyouthankyouthankyou for this simple and easy recipe!  My 11 year old son and I threw these together after dinner this evening and they are perfect - moist and fluffy!  Not too sweet but a little icing goes a long way.  We pushed down the heaping spoonfuls so they would flatten a little more.  We 're not big on super-sweet, so these were an excellent option.

This is not what I was looking for.  When I think of cakey cookies, I think of dense, soft, cookies that feel more like cookie than cake.  These cookies are definitely cakey.  They are basically cakes you can hold in your hand and eat - and a tadbit biscuity.  I do recommend adding vanilla, or the batter will be kind of bland.  They taste ok.  I only ended up making 1 round of cookies.  I added milk, sugar, and berries to the rest of the batter to make a bread, and it's baking now.

These cookies are really really good. I made them to take on a picnic to the beach. I made them in like half an hour! But they absouloutly need frosting, my brother hated them without frosting but couldn't get enough with! They are very easy. I am only 11 years old and I made them without messing up too badly.

These are pretty good!! I'm a fan of crispy ("Pillsbury-style") sugar cookies normally, but decided to give these a try. I think I'd still rather have a crispy sugar cookie, but these big doughy cookies are GREAT with milk or ice cream. Very soft, and huge! A good recipe for those who want more of a cake-style cookie.

Really liked these,they were easy to make! They are quite large cookies, and my baking time was more like 16-17 minutes for them to finish baking in center of cookie. I used betty crocker white sour cream prepared frosting to spread on top, and left off sprinkles.The only thing that I might change next time would be to cut back a little of the sugar---I like less sweetness! I will make these again!

These are AMAZING! Just like the BIG SOFT CHEWY ones you get at the store. If you are looking for the thin small ones this recipe is not for you. If you are looking for a big chewy cake-like cookie than this is for you

These cookies are nice & soft.  I added 1 tsp of lemon extract & they were yummy.  I didn't have frosting on hand so made some powedered sugar frosting & it complimented the cookies very well.  This is definately a recipe that will be used again & again. Thanks!

These are great! It was quick and easy to make, the only thing, they were a little more cakey than I expected. But the whole family loved them. I made them a few hours ago, and there is only 2 left! Mmmmm.

It tasted more like a biscuit then a sugar cookie. It had hardly any taste and the texture was not pleasing.

I made these cookies with vanilla and almond like others have mentioned. They turned out great! While they were baking, I made some cream cheese frosting and added food coloring. My kids had a blast decorating them for our Christmas party, and they tasted great too! I think next time I will add a little more vanilla to them. This was a great recipe! Thanks!

Flavor is not the strongpoint of this cookie.  It does have a redeeming soft moist texture.  Luckily, frosting and sprinkles make up for the lack of flavor, and the overall effect is surprisingly pleasing.  I bet kids would love these huge cookies.

This is a pretty good recipe. Very BIG cookies.  I will use it again for school functions like Valentines Day parties or Christmas parties.  The frosting can be changed to suit the occasion and the kids really enjoyed them.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I should have read the reviews first but I was in a hurry...they taste like CORNBREAD. nice cornbread recipe, awful cookie recipe. I'm really upset that I wasted all of these ingredients, I could've used the last of my flour for something better than this .

These cookies were not good at all!  The dough tasted OK, but there was sooo much flour!  All they did when they cooked was puff up.  They tasted like dry biscuits!  I could have messed up somewhere, but still, they tasted BAD!

These cookies are tasteless and they do not flatten out.  I would not use this recipe again.  I've tried adding vanilla, and other flavorings, and I have not been able to get them right. Very disappointing.

The texture of these cookie-cakes is moist to the point of stickiness. They also turned out darker than the ones in the photo. picture 

Maybe I did something wrong? I will try this recipe again because they resemble Lofthouse cookies so closely and I'm on a focused pursuit of a recipe that will let me make a homemade version.

Something went terribly wrong.  These cookies came out with a very nice texture, but they tasted pretty freaky.  Sort of like cornbread.  Perhaps we messed up the recipe, but I will not be trying this again.

I was concerned with all the negative reviews but these came out Great! I thought I might have to flatten them but they flattened themselves, I used real butter so it brought a lot of flavor to the cookies, and frosted them with homemade frosting, so good :)
Will definitely make these again!

This was a good recipe but not what I was looking for.  I was looking for a cookie that was more dense and could be used for dunking.  I will make it again as everyone loved them.

A really tasty cookie and easy to make too. I added half teaspoon each vanilla and almond essence for flavour.I have added it to my special collection and permit me if I experiment further with the basic recipe by adding oats and raisins.

MM, were these good! I used low-fat margarine and only dusted them with confectioner's sugar and they were still amazing. I made two batches of these in a day they were gone so quick. Yum!
