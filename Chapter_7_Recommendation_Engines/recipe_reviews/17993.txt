I changed some things in this recipe to spice it up. Sauted onion and garlic with the beef, used cayenne pepper instead of black, added 1/8 of tsp of stevia to bring out the curry more...and then added some chopped carrots for added nutrition...needed more water than called for but the result was awesome....and my hubby is a curry expert. Whole family loved it, even the kids.

I just got done eating this for dinner.MMMM!!!
I would make this again. Since I did not have tomatoe paste, I used a can of tomatoe sauce and omitted the water. I also used a bit more curry. I found that it took a little longer than 35 minutes to cook, to make sure that meat was browned, but very good...

I have to say that the order of adding ingredients should be followed in this one.  (If you are going to change anything, maybe saute the aromatics in the spices for a bit before adding the liquid.)  Frying spices in a little bit of fat before adding other ingredients is a common Indian cooking technique important to releasing the full flavor of the spices (and disgusting your neighbors with that pungent Indian restaurant smell - it only smells good if you get to eat the food later!)  While this is not the most authentic Indian recipe (after all, it IS curried BEEF), it doesn't deserve to get bad reviews from folks who didn't follow the recipe.

OMG, this was awful. It was bland, the meat does not get tender, there is not enough liquid.  It was terrible.

One of the problems with this recipe is the order of the ingredients.  After browning the meat I stirred in the onions (also added a clove of minced garlic) and cooked with the meat for about 5 minutes.  Then I added the tomato paste mixture.
I also had to increased the water to about 3/4 cup.  Also added more curry powder.  Since I had to make so many changes, I won't be making this again.

I am a curry-lover, and this was far too bland for me - the curry taste was barely there.  The apple helped out the flavour some, but other than that, there just wasn't much to the taste!  Also, I found there was not enough liquid.  It was definitely edible, but I will not make this again.

After reading the other reviews, I added the onion with the seasonings as the meat finished browning, changed the water to about 2/3 cup, and added 1/3 cup coconut milk (I had it in the fridge from the last curry I made) - along with a small carrot.  I thought the finished product had a good combination of spicy-sweet that gave it appeal.  While it probably won't become a weekly staple at our house, it'll make another appearance when I have beef onhand and that curry craving come again!

I was in a real bind because I had stew beef thawed out and no time to make a beef stew or soup (which require a lot of cook time to come out tender and flavorful).  This was well received by my family.  We would definitely have it again.

While I tried to stay with the original ingredients and measurements the first time, I would definitely add some more spice next time.  I also cut my meat and apples into much smaller cubes.  In my humble opinion and that of my children and husband, I would add more salt, more curry, probably some garlic, more of the tomato paste/water combination (to allow for more gravy), and I would add some medium hot sauce, such as red hot (medium heat level according to the bottle).

This was very good and I am so glad that Kitchen Geisha shared it with the allrecipes communities.  I do not know what I would have had for dinner if not for this website and my family really liked it (which, to be quite honest, surprised me.)

Pretty good flavour.  The one downside was that there wasn't much sauce.

I found the taste combo too strange on this one! Apples/raisins too sweet for my taste. Good idea though, would be a good way to get children to eat curry!

Really Good!
I used Applesause instead of Apples (my kids won't eat apples so I snuck it past them) and Cranberries instead of Raisins (because I didn't have any left after making cookies).
We are not big Curry fans.  This is a great Curry recipes for those who don't want their food too "curry tasting" but it was not BLAND!
I'd give a 4.5 but I don't have that option.

I just finished eating this! REALLY TASTY! I did read the other reviews and wanted it spicy, so I added more curry powder and some cayenne pepper. I sauteed the onions and added the apple and raisins near the end. I love the apple/raisin sweetness with the spicy curry. I omitted the celery. ALSO - I seasoned my rice with salt, curry, cayenne and margarine. So the complete meal had a real kick! Make sure you cover the beef while it's simmering so it will cook all the way through. I'm going in for seconds!!

I should have been more patient with this one, as I added extra curry (almost doubled) early on and used cayenne pepper as suggested by other reviewers. Should have considered the fact that the taste would emerge later on...  Super simple recipe, a quick fix for a week meal.  I will likely do it again, and add some coco milk in towards the end and use pork or lamb.

The flavor of the meat was good think I messed up a little bit on the recipe because it was not as saucy as the picture. Will make again, but my son was not excited about this recipe but he is a real picky eater. Overall met the qualifications of our family's rating system to make again!

I made this even after some of the negative feedback and loved it. I did tweek it a little. Following some of the previous suggestions. I browned the beef with the carrots, garlic and onions all together. I seasoned it with curry and cyenne. I then added 1/2 cup of water. I had no tomato paste so I used ketchup. Added the raisins in the end. No apple. It was great cooked it for about 45 mins and covered a little in the end too.

This was excellent, but I did make a few minor changes.  I used 1/2 can tomato sauce instead of the tomato paste.  I had to simmer the dish for almost 2 hours to get the beef tender.  As the dish would dry out, I kept adding water. I also used 2 1/2 tsp curry powder, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp turmeric and some carrots. Excellent!  I will make this again.

Thought this was an excellent recipe especially for an fairly easy curry at home dish.   Had it with brown rice. It was even tastier the next day.

Spicy curry, sweet raisins, tart apples, tender beef, and fragrant basmati rice...what a great taste!  On my initial try of this recipe I used stew beef and found that I needed to simmer longer than stated.  This time I used thinly sliced flat iron steak and it was ready within the 35 minutes simmer time.  Also substituted ketchup for the tomato paste and hot Indian curry paste for the powder.

My first clue should have been the preamble, where she basically said she didn't really like curry Hahahahaha... Any curry dish that a 4 year old likes is probably too bland for me! I will make this again I think, only I'll modify it a great deal by using diced tomatoes and their juice, something to thicken it slightly and about 2 tablespoons of Madras Curry. Great experiment though and it's really got me thinking!

This was quite good! I used about a cup of water, though, adding more several times after the initial tomato paste/water mix.

Sorry, but this hardly had any curry flavor.  Very bland as made.  Meat wasn't tender.  I'm going back to the way my mom made it.  I grew up in England and curry was/is a huge takeaway.  This couldn't pass muster, I'm afraid.  Sorry.  Add more spice to it, you'll enjoy it much more

It was my first time cooking with curry. I enjoyed the simplicity of the meal. I used cranberries instead of raisins because that's what I had. It still tasted good.

Excellent.  The tomato paste/water didn't make much sense to me, so I just used a small can of tomato sauce instead, and I think this made it more saucy than it would have been, others said it was a bit dry.  It is pretty spicy as written, but that is as easy as adjusting the curry powder.  I am a fan of mustard/pepper/horseradish type of spicy, and an adjustment to the black pepper:curry ratio will dial this in perfectly.  A great starting recipe to adjust to your specific tastes.

With a few changes to suit my family this was a big hit.  I left out the celery and substituted coconut milk for the water.  I also added a tsp of arrowroot powder to thicken the broth.  We ate it over mashed sweet potatoes instead of rice.  Really good!

Was pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  Didn't expect my kids to like curry, but they did!  We didn't have pineapple, so I left it out.

Will make this again! (great in a time crunch)

Pretty good and relatively easy.  I didn't want to open a whole can of paste for the small amount called for, so I substituted ketchup.  Seemed a little risky, but it worked well enough. I also added a dash or two of red pepper, and it was a bit too spicy for my 2 year old. It was nice for something different, but I won't be adding it to my recipe box.

This is an excellent, quick and easy meal.  My husband and I enjoy it as a meal with rice and a cooked veggie.  I didn't have any trouble with the cooking order suggested.
