Super duper delicious.  The mixture of peanut butter and red curry is divine.  We gobbled it up.  I used only 3/4 cup peanut butter, and that was the most I would advise using.  I also used ancho chili powder instead of cayenne, I skipped the fish and sesame oils, and I used only two cans of coconut milk for a thicker sauce.  I added in Thai basil and lots of veggies such as carrots, onions, zucchini, water chestnuts and those mini-corn things.

I thought this was great! I added extra heat to suit my taste and I think more curry paste would have been good too. I used chunky peanut butter and garnished the top with crushed peanuts scallions and red pepper flakes outstanding!

Great recipe. I think a very little bit of soy sauce in this recipe would be great too. I halved the peanut butter as per other suggestions and added a little more curry paste (personal preference) and it tasted great. I served it over chicken and rice. I've been looking for a good red curry sauce and this is it. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks. =)

I scaled this recipe down to 10 servings which used 1 can of coconut milk.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and it turned out incredibly well.  After cooking down, the texture was perfect, the ingredients didn't compete with each other, and you could taste layer after layer of flavors.  It takes a few seconds for the spiciness of the red curry paste to kick in, but when it does, it's just the right amount of "heat."  Please don't skip the red curry paste, as it is sooooo important to this sauce.  I would give this 10 stars if possible, and I wouldn't change a thing.  Already been added to my Favorites folder.

I've made this recipe a few times and it is AMAZING!! Perfect for Chicken Satay but also great for dipping bread apples carrots or other veggies (or just my fingers). Try making the recipe with the original proportions at least the first time then adjust to your personal taste. I think the amount of peanut butter is fine as is.

This was AMAZING! I had some leftover noodles and I was craving some peanut sauce and I came across this recipe. I happened to have everything on hand. I converted the recipe to 8 servings and followed the instructions as is. The only change is I substituted juice of half a lime for the fish sauce. I put the sauce on the leftover noodles and it was so delicious I ended up making more noodles to finish the sauce!

I have to agree with as much peanut butter as in the recipe it is too much. Try with half the PB it worked well for me.

I used the suggestions from others to reduce peanut butter and reduced the coconut milk to 2 cans upped the red curry paste and still had way too much sauce no matter it was excellent! I will keep this for impressing others with my thai skills =)

This sauce was so yummy! I did change a few things though I only used 2 cans of coconut milk and 3/4 cup peanut butter and I left out the fish sauce & added a splash of tamari instead. I would probably use half the suggested amount of brown sugar next time because it got a little too sweet. Still after a few tweaks this recipe is delicious and I like the fact that you can play with it. I especially loved the red chili paste flavor. I served it with broccoli and tofu with toasted sesame seeds and we gobbled it up. I can't wait to try it on other stuff!

this is a very good recipe for peanut sauce. I didnt want a tonne of sauce so i halved the recipe. I used natural peanut butter in place of creamy - to reduce sugar and give it a more authentic taste. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Sounded terrific but it was way too peanut-buttery for my taste. I added more coconut milk and some more spices but it pretty much tasted like noodles coated in peanut butter.

So good!! I made it almost exactly as written. Based on other helpful reviews I reduced the amount of coconut milk. Did not have sesame oil so left it out. I tasted it before adding brown sugar was not sure it needed any but added a small amount then added more red curry paste for more flavor/heat. Also added some salt. Loved it! Thanks for a great recipe.

After reading a ton of the reviews, I dropped the coconut milk to two cans and the peanut butter to 2/3’s of a cup. Then, because we like the burn, added three teaspoons of the chili paste as well as a couple of splashes more of hot chili oil. Absolutely fabulous!!! The bonus is the sauce is great in the rice as well as the satay!!

One word: YUMMY! I was surprised at the depth of flavor I could get so quickly with this sauce. I halved the recipe substituted the juice of one lime for the fish sauce and replaced the brown sugar with about 1/4 cup honey and 2 packets of Truvia to reduce the calories a bit. So fast easy and DELICIOUS! I will make this again and again.

This was pretty delish. I only had one can of coconut milk on hand and it still made a lot of sauce. I added some lime juice to counteract the sweetness since I only had 1 can of coconut milk. Added freshly chopped basil and pineapple and served it over chicken with basmati rice. Everyone loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it was pretty bland. We added a little soy sauce and sriracha sauce and it was decent but not as good as our local Thai restaurant.

This recipe surpassed our expectations. We've made this 20 plus times and it's always so delicious. We serve it over rice with cooked chicken breast chunks. We steam all the veggies in one steamer starting with the chopped fresh broccoli layer on sugar snap peas and large pieces of mini sweet peppers. Absolutely fantastic.

The flavor was very good. I think I would use 1 can less of coconut milk next time for a thicker sauce. I like to make it as a dip for Thai sticky rice.

I only had yellow curry and regular sugar. It was still really good I used natural peanut butter which I would most definitely recommend. I added super Thai hot chili and a squeeze of half a lime before serving with pad Thai noodles. It was good!

This is a good basic recipe to jazz up. I found it bland even with the addition of lemongrass and ginger. Next time I will add more curry garlic ginger lemongrass and tad less sugar. Maybe a dash of soya sauce too then a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds. Served over sauteed red and green pepers onion diced tomato cooked chicken and spaghetti. Yum.

I scaled this down to 10 servings (1 can coconut milk) and followed the recipe precisely and it was delicious! We had 2 families over for a Memorial Weekend cookout and we served grilled shrimp chicken & skirt steak with this sauce as well as Argentinean Chimichurri (also from the site) and everyone loved it! I can't wait to try it on noodles!

This recipe was a big hit with the family. I didn't read the other reviews before making it so I left the amount of peanut butter as is and it tasted perfect to me. I would actually use a little more next time (probably just a tablespoon or so more). What I will do next time is take down the amount of sugar it was very very sweet.

To make it vegan I omitted the fish sauce and added some soy sauce plus the juice of half a lime. I also only made a third of this recipe as I only had one can of coconut milk. Turned out great!

I followed the recipe except used 1 cup of natural peanut butter because that's all I had. Instead of brown sugar I used honey which was a great complement. I tossed the sauce on some chicken and zucchini. If you cook the chicken and zucchini together drain out the liquid before adding the sauce otherwise a lot of the flavor gets lost. I also added some cilantro to my chicken dish. The fish sauce really is key in bringing out the best flavor.

I can't give this a fair rating because I modified a few things but for a recipe base it worked fabulously! The things I changed were: curry powder instead of chili powder; cartoned sweetened coconut milk (Silk). I wanted to use this sauce for a chicken curry base so I sauted bone-in skin-on chicken thighs that were first liberally coated in salt pepper and curry powder then once browned I removed the thighs and continued the recipe as normal using the chicken drippings. I added some roasted peanuts while everything simmered. The final result was incredible!

Oh people don't skip the Fish Sauce! I use Red Boat fish sauce and it is delicious. I skip the chili powder and use more curry paste and sriracha. If you have gochuchang that would work nicely too. Personally two cans of coconut milk is enough and 3/4 c peanut butter. Be sure to add some onion carrots peppers to taste.

This sauce is awesome! My kids love peanut curry so I make this at least once a month. I make this with 2 cans of coconut milk and cut everything to proportion except the peanut butter garlic and curry paste. I keep the garlic and curry paste amounts as stated in the article. I cut the peanut butter in half. We are vegetarians so we use the sauce with tofu and veggies. Outstanding!

YUM! Can t wait to make it again so I can have some LOL. Let me explain... I made the curry sauce so I could make a curry that my husband could take for dinner while housesitting. He doesn t eat much meat so I made the curry with onion red and green bell pepper and chickpeas. As soon as he heated it up and tucked in he texted me from the housesitting gig GOOD CURRY!! He can be persnickety about his curry - and he s a very good cook on his own - so when he says that kind of thing I figure I done good. I will make it again maybe with some shrimp. This one s a keeper!

This is delicious! I submitted the fish sauce for soy sauce and made it a little more spicy. So good!

This recipe was the one that introduced me to the website so there is no doubt in saying that it must have been amazing if I was craving something and my high expectations were met. I found it best to read the comments before cooking to ensure I made the best rendition of this dish to fix any of the less popular flavors. I ended up doubling the recipe only adding a third of the doubled amount of peanut butter; which was chunky instead of smooth. I added an accidental unknown amount of the curry paste (which was great) along with another accidental teaspoon of sesame oil (great again) in addition to the two teaspoons already called for when doubling the recipe. It saved well but when chilled over night it became a peanut butter consistency before being heated back up in a sauce pan. WASH YOUR DISHES WELL!!!!!

This tastes delicious! I mixed it with some fried chicken and vegetables alongside rice in the hopes of copying one of my favourite restaurant dishes and it tasted the same! So good. I'm very impressed!

Maybe I didn’t reduce the recipe proportionately but I thought it was bland.
