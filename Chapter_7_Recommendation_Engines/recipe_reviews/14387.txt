My family loves this recipe.  Add some salt and pepper and  I use frozen peas instead of canned.

Thought this turned out a little bland as recipe written, so spiced it up with a little seasoned salt, added some green peppers, small shrimp, and used frozen peas(canned always seems to be
mushy).  It was fine, buy not one of my favorites.

I tried three variations on this recipe:     1. Added some dill (not bad)     2. Used pesto instead of mayo and heated everything through before serving (even better)     3. Used the mayo, added a little white wine vinegar, and threw in a whole lot of bacon (my personal favorite!)

I cut the recipe in half because I wasn't sure how it would taste with just mayo as a dressing for salad. This was ok, but I liked it better with italian dressing added and some McCormick Salad Topper and croutons.
