This is a great recipe!  Being born and raised in Hawaii and now living in Las Vegas, my husband and I crave the comforts of home.  These were easy to make and so ONO.  Our local market didn't have round wonton skins so I used the square ones instead.  And I used my rice cooker (with the steamer tray that came with it) to steam it ... they came out perfectly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's exactly like the ones we used to buy from our neighborhood Manapua Man :)

Ono! I did omit the egg white, but added everything else and increase the oyster sauce to 2 tsp. I use water to seal my wonton edges. It never falls apart once cooked. What's not to love about pork hash? Freshly made, full of wonderful flavor, home-cooked comfort food - delicious! I serve with Aloha soy sauce mixed with a little sesame oil and a little lemon juice with chopped green onions. Other times I will dip into a mixture of Chinese hot mustard and soy sauce!

Try adding diced shiitake mushrooms and Chinese black beans.  That'll put it over the top.

I thought his recipe was great, very easy very tasty. My husband, who is the spice ghost, found it a bit bland as is so he added some Maharajah Style Curry Powder and I made a soy sauce/teriyaki sauce/fresh grated ginger and garlic dipping sauce and they were a BIG hit.  I am sure they would have been a great hit without the extra spice but I highly recommend this recipe.

This was delicious!!! I made these for a party I was catering and people couldn't stop raving about them! I omitted the shrimp and doubled the pork due to some people's food allergies but they were still fabulous! Will definitely make again!

The pork mixture is easy to make but wrapping it in a round thin dumpling skin takes some practice.  We all love the flavor, plus freeze the extras for future meals.

Great recipe! However, I pan fried them and then steamed them (the method you use to cook Jiaozi/Gyoza/potstickers/dumplings.)  They came out wonderful!  Lots of compliments from the guests I served them to.

Just as I remembered these way back then. Only change I made was double or I believe even triple the seasonings, because it was a little bland the first time I made it and I followed that recipe to a T! Anyway Thank you! Thank you so much for

Great recipe, served them to a crowd at our annual Hawaiian style bbq. The only problem was my ineptitude in pleating the wonton skins. I also couldn't find the round skins so I used the square ones. I ended up folding opposite corners together and steaming them. I did put them on lettuce leaves in the steamers so they couldn't stick. I even did 2 layers in the steamer by putting a piece of parchment paper between the layers and it worked beautifully.

I didn't really care for this. The flavor was bland except for the strong garlic flavor. That might sound like a good thing but not to me. The ingredients looked flavorful and I followed the recipe to a tee. I tried it with the shoyu lemon dipping sauce and then with
 the sweet chili sauce. It tasted better with the sweet chili sauce. I'm from Hawaii so I know what its supposed to taste like. In fact pork hash is one of my favorite foods. I really really wanted to like this but it just wasn't for me. :o(  i may have tweek this recipe like leaving out the eggwhites, a little more oyster sauce less garlic.  I don't know if it made a differance that I steamed it in a metal steamers rather than a bamboo steamer??? Oh well...

I made this last week to go with the hot and spicy pork-cabbage soup from this site. My husband said that the dumplings were the best part of the meal! We're having them again tonight (so I can get rid of those pesky wonton skins!)

this is a great recipe, but it's not exactly yours.  it's almost exactly the one from the hawaiian electric cookbook, so unless you're the one who provided it to them, you shouldn't represent it as "your" recipe....

Added a little ginger and more oyster sauce( twice as much). Served it with spring roll sauce and hot chili sauce. It was very well received. I will make it again definitely.

What an amazing turn out.  I was a little  skeptic on the ingredients at first, but after having everything put together and the mix completed, I almost teared.  After steaming just a few, and awaiting with excitement ,anticipation and glee.  I popped one of these steamed treats in my mouth with amazement. Just like 7-11 style Pork Hash. Could believe it, I had made a few extra for my mainland friend to try, and they want more!  Tomorrow cooking up another batch.  What a turn out. Much Mahalo!!

Its been years since I had these. They turned out pretty good. The wrappers are kinda delicate and may fall apart once you handle them after they have been steamed. I aldo used a teaspoon of ginger too. So ono!

These are delicious. I'm trying new things for my kids. I thought they look like shumai, but taste a lot better. The shrimp makes it yummy. I followed the recipe, but I didn't have water chesnuts. I put a little bit more oyster sauce (2 tsp to the 1 tsp the recipe calls for) and no salt. Turned out tasty. This was my first time making these, it's not that hard to work with the wonton skins, once I assemble one I put it in a mini muffin cup while I do the rest, and then I transfered all of them to the steamer.
One thing though, this recipe only makes 12. Probably if you make it smaller it can stretch to 24, but I make regular size ones with regular wonton skin. I had square skins but I just trimmed the edges with a kitchen scissors. Will make again, thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe for a last minute holiday potluck however, I did not make it to the grocery store in time to get ground pork.  Not having a meat grinder at home, I opted to make a Kalua pork (shredded smoky salted pork) and used that in place.  It was ono-licious (as the islanders say)!  I also used a wasabi/soy sauce on the side for dipping.

No Bfainer!!! This recipe was outstanding. My friend made these as an appetizer for her party. The flavor was great plus they're nice and light. I would definitely make this for friends.
