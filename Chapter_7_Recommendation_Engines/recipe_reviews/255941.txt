We really enjoyed these!  I served with both cranberry sauce and gravy for dipping.  You could easily play around with the ratio of potato to stuffing.  I dolloped the potato mixture onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and froze so that it was easier to work with.  Then I coated the frozen balls in egg wash before rolling in panko.  I fried some of them right away and returned the rest to the baking sheet to freeze.  After they froze completely I transferred to a freezer bag to cook later.
