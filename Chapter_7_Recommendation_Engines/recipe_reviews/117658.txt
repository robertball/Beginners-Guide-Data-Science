Well, I can't speak for myself on this one but my husband sure did enjoy it! Spruce up a plain 'ol hot dog with some cheese and one of his all time favorites - bacon and we have a winner. All I did was add a little ketchup and of course an ice cold beer on the side!

THESE DOGS ... SO EASY TO MAKE. I FOLLOWED ALL YOUR DIRECTIONS EXACT, EXCEPT I PUT THEM ON STEAMED BUNS THE FIRST TIME. THE SECOND TIME ... IT WAS RAINING, SO WE BROILED THEM. TASTE AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TIME. I PASSED THIS RECIPE ON TO MY FOUR CHILDREN AND TWO SO FAR THINK THIS MAKE HOTDOGS AGAIN A SPECIAL MEAL. THIS IS A GREAT HIT WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY. P.S. This is my first review on any recipe, on this site in the last four years. I rate this recipe not as a 5 star, BUT AS * * * * * * * * *

My parents always called these "squirrels." Whatever the name I've ate these for years and now my kids look forward to squirrel night. Easy,economical, and fast to make.

These hot dogs bring back childhood memories. We love these hot dogs with chili! I do think the ingredients make a difference in the taste of these hot dogs.   I used Nathan hot dogs, Walmart sliced dill pickle, and Oscar Mayer center cut bacon. To make the bacon thinner, I place the bacon in a ziplock bag and gently pound it with a meat tenderizer mallet. (Use the flat side.) The bacon will be crispy.  To prevent a mess on your grill place tinfoil sprayed with Pam on your grill before cooking the hot dogs. You also can also broil these hot dogs in the oven.

Easy enough, although I used my food loops instead of toothpicks and I don't recommend it.  I was just trying out the food loops.  Toothpicks are easier!  (at least on hot dogs!)  I fried the hot dogs on the stove top, which worked just as well.  I didn't put mustard on the hot dogs bc bf doesn't like it--I waited and put it on my bun instead.  A different, and good, hot dog recipe.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were good, but not OMG good. The combo of ingredients on this hot dog worked together, oddly enough. The whole family liked them well enough. I just don't know if they were that great to make again. The salty taste of these ingredients together was a bit overwhelming.

Good memories.  We learned to make these in our Home Economics class 55 years ago.  I still make them occasionally.  I think they are tasty.

They were really messy, and a lot of work for the finished product. I used the broiler method, and the bacon turned out still pretty chewy after 12 minutes. Also, almost all the cheese melted out of them.
