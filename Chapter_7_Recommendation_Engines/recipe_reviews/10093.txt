I looked for a recipe to duplicate a cookie from a local bakery and found this one.  I roll them in chocolate sprinkles before baking and use almond extract in the frosting instead of vanilla (just my preference).  My nephew can't get enough of these.  Yum!

These are super yummy! The cookies alone are melt in your mouth buttery, I did not find the almond overpowering at all. The icing tasted a little too much like powdered sugar for my taste, and it was a bit thin, so I added a little more cocoa powder and a little instant vanilla pudding powder. Scrumptious!

Incredible!  Super easy recipe with wonderful results.  The cookies turned out light and crispy like shortbread, and the frosting was just the right amount of chocolate and just the right amount of sweetness.  I did need to add an additional 1 TBSP of hot water to the frosting mix in order for it to get to the desired consistency, and I needed to bake the cookies an additional 5 - 8 minutes in order for them to get the golden brown edges.  My 3 1/2 year old daughter helped with almost every step of the recipe, and we had a great time together.  These are light, delicious cookies that I'll be proud to present as the dessert for my brother-in-law's birthday.  Thanks for sharing!

These are wonderful and are so pretty! I posted pictures of them, new family favorite. I added bit of milk to the frosting to get it how I wanted it.

My family has made these cookies for years for get-togethers, but we put buttercream frosting in the centers instead of the chocolate filling...totally different flavor but super yummy.  I made them to bring to work and they were gone in about 10 min!

First time making these and they were VERY easy to make! I did roll in sugar sprinkles, had no problem with them sticking! I was an idiot however and frosted BEFORE I put in the oven but they are still good LOL. I did have to add more water to the frosting to get a better consistancy.

YUM! I tried to roll them in sprinkles as suggested by other's (they look so cute in the pic's) but had a hard time getting the sprinkles to stick, the dough is super crumbly. I dipped the cookies in an egg wash and then the had no problem with the sprikles sticking.

Delicious! These little cookies are just perfect.  The dough did end up a bit crumbly for me, but the final product still turned out right.  I made exactly as written and the frosting just puts them over the top.  These are going to be a definite keeper in my house.

So good.  These just melt in your mouth.  I made the recipe as written, but didn't have quite enough chocolate frosting to fill all of the cookies, and one of my kids suggested a white frosting with sprinkles instead.  So I made a butter cream frosting that I piped into the centers, and then added some holiday sprinkles.  Both versions turned out well and now all of my kids are happy.

Well, we had mixed reviews in my house on this one. My husband loved the shortbread cookie part of this but did not like the chocolate on top. Neither of my kids liked it...they took a few bites and asked for the Oreos that were in the pantry. I think they're delicious and since I'm typing the review I give it 5 stars :) I rolled some in chocolate sprinkles, some in pink sprinkles and left others plain :)

This is one of my favorite cookies.  They are a light shortbread type cookie with a hint of almond flavor.  I placed a blanched almond on top of the frosting.  My family loves them, I'll be making these every Christmas!

Excellent shortbread cookie!
Mine only made 2 dozen, so I double the recipe when I make them.
I also added an extra tbsp. of water to the frosting, to make it a  little more pliable. Great cookie, thanks for sharing.

Easy.  I added water because the dough was too crumbly.  That worked and it didn't seem to change the taste of the cookie.  I, also, added almond flavoring to the frosting instead of vanilla.  Very good!

I like the concept, but this recipe doesn't taste like my bakery.  The cookie was very brittle, and only produced 2doz.  The almond flavor was too strong for what I wanted.

I was skeptical to these because the recipe doesn't include any baking powder, but the came out very Buttery, soft, and so-good with Chocolate frosting and hazelnut. (I place 1 hazelnut on top) So Pretty and heavenly good :) Thanks!

These cookies are DELICIOUS! I had planned on using the icing recipe too, but after a quick search in my pantry, I found a few bags of Hershey Kisses that needed used up, so I just popped them into the center of the cookies after I baked them. I will definately try the icing next time, as I know it will be a great compliment to the cookie. These totally reminded me of the cookies from the bakery, and I will be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made these and took them to a meeting. They were gone in 15 minutes. I've been requested to make them again to share with the group. They are easy to make and yummy. I used store bought frosting which cut down on prep time. Next time I will use jam for the filling. M

Was out of almond extract so used vanilla.  I have to say thati was kinda skeptical because the dough wad SO dry and crumbly.  They kept cracking with I would try to thumb print them. They came out okay. the frosting alone was gross, but combined with the cookie was good.  I had to add extra hot water because it was too dry to be a frosting.  Doesnt compare to the bakery cookie but a good sub for those cravings.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really liked these, but my kids wouldn't touch them?  WHAT?  They're chocolate filled cookies!  I even rolled the dough in sprinkles before baking, but they prefered the jam-filled cookies.  In the future, I think I'll use a hybrid of this recipe and the jam filled butter cookie recipe (from this site).  The cookie part of this recipe if superior ... light and flaky.  The chocolate part of this recipe was a little too sweet, so I added some salt and that gave it a nice taste.  I also filled some with Nutella, and OMG ... I had to give them away or I would have eaten them all.

These were good, and a nice change from the usual cookies I bake for the family, although not everyone loved the shortbread.  I used the Chocolate Butterceam Frosting recipe from this site as another reviewer suggested and added sprinkles to the top.
