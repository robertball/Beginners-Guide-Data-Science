This is a soft, lightly spiced cookie.   My friends liked this a lot.   A good Holiday cookie and easy to make.

I made these last minute for a cookie swap since I couldn't run to the store to get any special ingredients.  To quote my husband and friends, "they aren't bad.  They aren't great, but they aren't bad either." They just are. This recipe is fine if you need a cookie recipe and only have a few ingredients at home, but I will not be saving it for future use.

The first reviewer is on the spot. Lightly spiced and soft, easy to make! Just thought I would add another review that it's a good cookie. I liked it with frosting for a little kick but it is good by itself with a glass of milk. :) Made these to give to friends and family. So far no complaints. :P
