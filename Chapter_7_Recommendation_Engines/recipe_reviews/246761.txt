This will be a go-to recipe for sure!  I'll freeze the hamburger in small containers to have on hand.  The only thing I did differently was I folder over the large tortilla and cut up instead of putting the second one on to

This was a quick, easy & tasty switch up to the classic burger!  Cut recipe in half & subbed chopped dill pickles for relish. Served with a side of baked onion rings. Yum! Will definitely make again...and again!

This was quite good!  My husband gave this recipe a thumbs up. Very filling. For 2 people I cut the recipe in 1/2. You will not go away hungry!  Using 1 lb. of hamburger made four  6" quesadillas.  I didn't have any sweet relish, so I cut up dill pickles. I also just squeezed some ketchup and mustard on the quesadilla which was easier for me. To knock it up a notch, I did add a 1/4 tsp. of cumin to spice it up and used  6 inch homemade tortillas!

My family didn't really like this recipe too much. There were too many flavors that didn't flatter each other.
