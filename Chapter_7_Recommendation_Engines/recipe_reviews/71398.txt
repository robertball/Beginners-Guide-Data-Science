I used all purpose flour and it turned out wonderfully. You can also sprinkle cinnamon and sugar for another delicious option.

I also used all purpose flour as it was all I had on hand and WOW! Tastes just like the ones my family used to make. I made a huge batch for an office potluck and was saddened when I didn't have any leftover to take home because they were devoured in less than 30 minutes!
