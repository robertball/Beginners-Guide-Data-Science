I have been cooking for years. The best way that I found to make a great crust is a mixture of mayo and dijon mustard with a few drops of water mixed together, dip pork chops, chicken or even fish in it. In another bowl pour panko (found in oriental section) bread crumbs and seasoned bread crumbs together with pecans or for Italian dishes grated parmesan cheese. Heat a pan with enough oil just to cover meat 1/2 way.Cook until crisp then finish in oven.

The pumpkin butter was delicious!  I had trouble getting the breading to crisp up and get golden and stay on the chops, but then I seem to have that trouble with anything breaded.  (Guess I don't know the secret to breading.)  Anyway, it tasted really good, my family loved it, and I would definitely make this again!

This is a grat recipe. I never tried it with Pumpkin Butter before, it's delicious
As far as "getting the breading to crisp up and get golden and stay on the chops", the best thing to do is to add a egg to the bread crumb and pecans and then coat the pork chops with this mix. The egg will help it stay in place.

This was a fun way to use my leftover pumpkin puree from pumpkin pies.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the cooking method.  I seared both sides of the pork in a hot skillet, then finished cooking them in the oven (at 400) for about 15 minutes.  I find this leaves them very moist.  Also, I breaded them and refrigerated for an hour before I cooked them, I think this helps the coating to stay on better.  My kids loved the chops too.

Hey guys, a couple of you are saying you were having trouble with the coating not sticking to the meat. I didn't add the traditional breading method of flouring and dipping in egg wash for two reasons.
 The first of which is that I wanted the cleanest flavors possible and to not have the breading be to heavy (adding eggs and flour not only makes the breading thicker but they also add flavor)
Secondly, the meat itself is sufficiently moist enough to hold the coating if pressed into the meat.

Also please note that the pan MUST be hot. If the pan and oil are not hot then the coating will absorb the oil helping for the breading to separate and the breading is likely to stick to the pan.

I hope this information is helpful for future people making the recipe.

~Drew

I'm not so great when it comes to frying in the pan, these were a little over done, but had a good flavor.  I might try it again...

I made this for a dear friend's birthday supper. I was quite skeptical about the pumpkin butter, but it was a hit!  My kids are squabbling about who is taking the leftovers for lunch to work (I hit a sale on pork chops, so I made nine).  I could not find pumpkin puree at the grocery (apparently it's seasonal, or else no one cooks with it anymore), so I used pumpkin pie filling, omitted all the spices and sugar, and just used the apple juice.  Also, because I wanted the breading to really stick, I dipped the chops in beaten egg.  Yum, lots of thumbs up at my house. Thanks for making me look good!

Yum! The pork chops themselves were fine, but the pumpkin butter was great! There was a lot left over, but I'm glad there was -- like others have mentioned, it'll taste good on toast and such. It also tastes amazing with the "Pumpkin Rolls II" listed on this site.

I cheated.  OK, I had a jar of Williams Sonoma Pumpkin puree in my cupboard and was looking for a good way to use it.  This was it!  This was a really yummy combination that I never would have thought of myself, but am so glad Drew did!  I prepared the pork chops per the recipe and they had a sweet and crunchy crust that was perfect.

I make this all the time and my family loves it!  The only two things I do differently is substitute "Honey Bunches of Oats with Pecans" cereal instead of bread crumbs and I cut the Pumpkin Butter ingredients in half.  Make sure the chops are thin enough so they cook through. Enjoy!

Nice fall dinner.  I used store bought pumpkin butter (Trader Joe's makes a good one) and will cut the bread crumbs/pecan mixture in half next time as I had alot leftover.  Served with Shredded Brussels Sprouts and leftover sweet potatoes.

I cut the crumb mixture in half & still had to throw some out. I dipped each chop in egg 1st to help the crumb mixture stick well. The chops took a LONG time to cook through, I guess the crumb topping insulates the meat, but the chops were DELICIOUS when finished, especially with the pumpkin butter. Hubby loved the pumpkin butter, but not ON the chops - prefered it on bread. I found the pumpkin butter to also be more than really needed & kept the extra in the refrigerator to eat in the morning with toast. NOTE: the pumpkin butter is NOT savory like I expected, it's sweet. May go better with the pork if 1/2 the sugar (or more) cut out and add a pinch of sage or curry

The pecan crusted pork was quite good, but felt the pumpkin butter over powering. It actually turned out like something you'd spread on your morning toast. The combination didn't exactly hit the mark. Too much work for so little results.

Wow! Every bit as good as the description. I made the dish exactly as the recipe stated and I wouldn't change a thing. The whole family loved it, and has been using the leftover pumpkin butter on toast, waffles, etc. Thanks.

This was great!  I dipped the pork in an egg wash first.  I used Italian panko crumbs for the bread crumbs.  These were the only changes I made.  I currently have a foreign exchange student living with me from Germany and he was wanting to email the recipe to his parents.  We all enjoyed this recipe.  I would encourage you to really pat the crumbs into the meat.  Thanks so much.

This was a nice fall dish. There was so much pumpkin butter that I decided to dredge the pork chops in some of the butter before I rolled it in the crumb mixture.  I also used thick pork chops, browned them in oil and finished them off in the oven. 400 for 35-40 min.

By itself the pork chops are still very bland. However, with the Pumpkin butter they are wonderful. I will use this recipe again. I did add a teaspoon of nutmeg to the pumpkin butter on accident (my daughter was talking to me and I thought I had the cinnamon, still added the cinnamon too though). I was out of cloves, so didn't add those. I really enjoyed the nutmeg in it though. Everything else I did as the directions stated.

Yummy! This is a great recipe for a pork chops. My husband made these one night recently and we all loved them. There is a lot of the pumpkin butter left. We just froze it for a later use. I will make again.

Excellent! I'll definitely make this again next Fall, but with just a hint less cinnamon. My husband said it was the best pork breading he's ever tasted. We served this with a Harvest Soup entree and Harvest Rice side dish, along with a Sweet Potato Cranberry Bake and Sweet Potato Pie for dessert. Beautiful Autumn feast :)

Wonderful dish. The contrast between the salty, meaty pork and pecans with the sweet autumn pumpkin butter was fantastic. Try it without sugar; it really isn't necessary. I've made this dish for my very picky boyfriend who is "morally opposed" to eating "meat with sweet" as he says, and he loved it anyway.

The pecan crusted pork was very popular in my house,  and the pumpkin butter was very popular, just not together. The pumpkin butter was delicious warm and we used it every morning for about a week, and the pork was delicious and juicyand the pecans paired so well with it. Will definitely make again,  just separately.

Entire family loved it! Do you know how hard it is to find something everyone likes?  I didn't have apple juice, so I used apple sauce.  I made pork loin roast and rolled it in the breading.  Delicious meal! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Ooh, fantastic! Followed it exactly, except I had to use half walnuts as I didn't have enough pecans, and allspice instead of cloves since that's all I had. Other than that, I will probably cook it on medium heat next time because the nuts were getting pretty dark. But excellent recipe!

I got a great crust by making the following adjustments:  I made the breading by finely chopping 1/2 c pecans and 1/2 c Fiber One cereal in the food processor (I'm sure regular breadcrumbs work fine in place of the cereal, it's just one of those nutrition "sneaks" I use to get more fiber).  I dipped the pork chops in a beaten egg before pressing them into the pecan mixture for a thick coating.  Then I cooked the chops by coating the skillet with a generous amount of cooking spray instead of using oil.  It worked great, and I give the pumpkin butter a thumbs up too.  Served the pork with sauteed green beans and a flaky biscuit.

The homemade pumpkin butter definitely made this dish, but it is extra work. Store bought pumpkin butter works just as well!

The only change I made was I used apple cider b/c I had no apple juice.  I just cut back a little on the cloves, cinnamon & sugar to compensate.  This was fantastic.  I used coconut oil to cook the pork & the crust stayed on fine by just pressing it firmly into the meat.  The pumpkin butter was delicious.  I am definitely not a meat + sweet type gal & this changed my mind.  My meat & potato husband ate everything that was left & gave a rare "this was REALLY good" compliment.  Thanks for making me an even more awesome wife ??

This was a very easy recipe to follow and it tasted amazing.  I was weary of the pumpkin butter, but it was very good and added the perfect flavor.  You will have extra for toast.  I made the recipe exactly.

Very good, but I think I'll just bake it next time to reduce some of the oiliness. I fried it in the skillet as directed, but the breading burned easily even at a lower heat. So I finished it in the oven. The pumpkin puree was perfect on it, and I'm eating it on my bagel this morning, too. :)

Absolutly delicious!!  I dredged the chops in the pumpkin butter, then into crushed ritz crackers.  It didn't even need the butter as a topping.  Will definitely make this again, and probably keep a jar of the pumpkin butter for toast and bagels.

This was great, and I'm not usually a fan of pork chops. I made a couple of changes due to what I had on hand. Instead of breadcrumbs I used about 1/2 cups of crushed cornflakes and 2 TBSP of wheat germ. Also, I only had 1/2 cup of pecans but it was enough for 4 thin chops (just barely, but enough). I dipped the pork chops in an egg before dipping them into the pecans to make them stick.  I'll be making this again!

It didn't look all that pretty at first, but one bite and my husband and I were hooked. I made the pumpkin butter (I was skeptical at first) and it just made the entire meal AMAZING! I do believe that was the first recipe my husband has made multiple and many compliments on. (ie, he raved for the first time ever) Wonderful!

This was delicious.  I prepared exactly as the recipe is written although my pork chops were slightly thicker so I browned the first side, flipped them and slid the pan in the oven to finish.  The pumpkin butter is amazing and I'm sure I'll find other uses for that as the recipe does make quite a bit.

Good. The pumpkin butter was a bit sweet, I won't use as much sugar next time.  I tried this recipie based on the pumpkin butter (which I'd never heard of before).  It's good - I would eat it alone & luckily, the recipie makes more than enough pumkin butter.  The crusting on the porkchops is also good.  I used salted pecans & crushed as well as I could by hand (I don't have a food processor).  I ended up with a few big pecan chunks & that was just fine.  Overall, I would definately make this recipie again.

Absolutely delicious!  The only changes I made was to dredge the port chops in a whisked egg prior to applying the breadcrumb/pecan mixture, and I reduced the sugar in the pumpkin butter to 1/2 cup.  The flavors blend together beautifully.

A good dish; the pork coating worked well even with gluten free breadcrumbs.  I cut the sugar in the pumpkin sauce by half, and it was plenty sweet. This makes a LOT of sauce; probably could cut the whole recipe in half for this amount of pork.

If there were a way to give this 20 stars, I would. It was simple, and I used handcrafted pumpkin butter we bought at our local farmers market. Of course, I served it on my finest tableware, because a dish like this deserves it!

This was a great meal.  Definitely making this again.  Only thing  changed was, I didn't have any ginger so I just skipped it and everything turned out very well.  Will be making this again in a few weeks for my daughter who loves pork chops..

My family LOVES this recipe! I'm not a cook so if I can make this...anyone can. I've never written a review on this website, but this recipe is so awesome, I had to do it. 

 I've made it three times now in a matter of two months. The first time I followed exactly except I used Pumpkin Butter and Apple Butter that a friend brought me from an orchard in Kentucky.  It was DELICIOUS! I actually like the apple butter with it the best, but my family liked the pumpkin butter. 

The second time I tried to do it the lazy way and used pecan meal instead of crushed pecans. Not so much. It was still great, but better with the crushed fresh pecans. 

The third time I was out of bread crumbs. Did I mention I'm not a cook? I couldn't figure out what to use instead. I remembered someone saying she used corn flakes. I didn't have any but that idea led me to use crushed potato chips. WOW-- flavor bonanza!! I can't imagine how much I upped the fat grams (don't even want to calculate)  but it was worth EVERY calorie. My family is fighting over the leftovers! 

I love this recipe and the original man who posted this is right...hotter oil works best to keep the breading on and make it CRUNCHY! 

LOVE IT!

Listen to the Author, Andrew is absolutely right, you don't need to make an egg wash or use mayo or dijon or water or anything else to completely change this recipe... TRUST THE CHEF.  I pressed the Pecan and Bread Crumb mixture onto the pork chops and that is all you need to do, perfecto!

We all loved this recipe! I took the first reviewer ' s advice and used mayo and dijon mustard as a base. I also used ground pork rinds instead of most of the panko. (Low carbing it.) For the pumpkin butter I just used canned pumpkin puree with some spices and a little splenda. Be very careful not to overcook, but don't undercooked either. I had to return to oven for 10-12 more minutes.
  Someone asked about sides.  I made creamed peas. Green beans also would go well, and if you are not low carbing, a dinner roll!
Will definitely be making these again.

I did a couple variations on this.  For one, I didn't have any nutmeg for the pumpkin butter, so I threw in a dash of cayenne.  Two, I chose to turn this into a schnitzel by hammering out the chops to 1/4", sprinkling with a tiny bit of salt and pepper, and then a traditional dusting of flour followed by egg before doing the pecan breading.  Judging by the picture, I also think that I also left more texture to the pecans.  Came out great, the pumpkin butter was absolutely to die for, will definitely be making this one again!  Great autumn schnitzel :)

It wasn't terrible, but was disappointed.... I did not have apple juice, but used apple cider.... The flavor just didn't seem to combine well. My guests said it was good, but friends will say at even if it weren't.... Sorry .... Don't think this will be on my menu again!!

This is a very great recipe! It was a tad bit to sweet, hence reduce the sugar but all in all was amazing! I will be doing this again!

Made this for dinner last night, and I have to say the pumpkin butter was my favorite part. I will never buy store bought pumpkin butter again - so easy to make myself and so flavorful. Plus, I know what goes into it, so no corn syrup. I could eat this on toast, english muffins, whatever. The pork was ok, too, but I need to use more pecans next time and I won't grind them as fine. I used a coffee grinder and I think it was too find for the pecan taste to come through. Other than that, no changes to the recipe, however I did start on the stove and finish in the oven, like another review had stated. Super moist that way!

I'm giving this 5 stars but I totally didn't follow the directions! LOL Sorry! The recipe was very inspiring, so I just wanted to share my super short cut for a similar taste! I coated my chops with pumpkin butter (bought at a farm market) and then used a combo of gluten free panko bread crumbs and almond meal with some nature's seasoning and a dash of pumpkin pie seasoning. I baked the chops instead of pan cooking (although maybe next time I'll pan cook them). They were a big hit!

This recipe was easy and delicious!  I dredged the pork chops in egg before dipping them in the breading mixture and put them in the refrigerator for a short time before searing  them in hot oil 5 min per side. I then baked them at 400 degrees for 15min. They were moist and delicious served with a small amount of the pumpkin sauce. My husband is more of a savory eater. He thought the dish was a bit sweet for his taste.  I think it's a great autumn dish!

To be honest, it sounded a little odd, but it was the most delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth.   I've made it several times now.  I'm on a low salt diet so I skipped the salt and it was still good.

I don't have pecans, but have lots of walnuts.  I think walnuts are better anyway.    This makes a very good meal  and it's an easy one.    I've never had any complaints yet, and I get a lot of complements.    (love this dish) Another note is that we prefer applesauce to the pumpkin butter.  I also make lots of apple sauce every fall, because I have lots of good home grown apples.

I read the reviews and did make less of the pecans and breadcrumbs and had an egg wash. My husband was very skeptical about this. We are arts and crafts vendors, so we have access to some yummy jelly/jam vendors, or in this case, a pumpkin butter vendor. I used the pumpkin butter instead of making it from scratch. Since it was just the two of us, I froze the remaining pork chops after cooking them. My husband asked for them again a couple of days later. He was surprised at how good they were. We're going to keep this recipe handy!

We liked the pecan/bread crumb mixture.  I made homemade apple sauce and served it with it.  I took the advice of Patricia K and dredged the pork chops in mayo and Dijon mixture, great tip!

I made this recipe exactly as instructed... Almost. I used 1" thick chops and coconut oil for frying, after 4 minutes on each side I transferred to a baking dish in a 300 degree oven for 20 minutes due to the thickness of my chops. In light of all the people commenting the breading wouldn't stick I lightly scored my meat prior to breading. It turned out superbly!!! I served it with baked asparagus and wild rice. This will deinately be a go to recipe!!

PS, the pumpkin butter leftovers are superb on cinnamon bagels!!!

This made enough for 6 thick cut bone-in pork chops. Way too much pumpkin butter. Could half that part of the recipe. I used panko bread crumbs which kept the outside crispy. Do NOT over cook. Timing was pretty much right for me. I did stick the first 4 in a warm oven while making the last 2. I just pounded the pecans so they were probably a little bigger then pulsing in grinder.

No changes and it was very good.  The pumpkin 'butter' was good standing alone and as other commenters have said,  the leftover butter is good on toast or bagels.

I made this for my family. The pumpkin butter was very good with the pork. Next time I will dip the pork in buttermilk to facilitate the crust sticking to the meat. I didn't have cloves and the sauce was good without them

I absolutely loved this recipe. The sweet and the savory paired so nicely. I had tons of pumpkin in the freezer pureed and ready to use so this was perfect! Easy and delish and it was a his with the family.  I did use a little less sugar then called for and it was perfect!

This is a great recipe --my extremely picky three and seven year olds loved it.  My husband had seconds and said that it reminded him of pork chops and applesauce but with a twist.

I didn't modify the recipe in any way.  The pumpkin butter makes up for the bland preparation of the pork chops themselves, so no need to add additional ingredients.  I would make this again, it's very easy to prepare on a weeknight.

Loved the combination of bread crumbs with the pecans. I used Panko bread crumbs and reduced the sugar in the pumpkin butter. I will definitely make again. Thanks!

My husband and I thought this turned out great! My sister loved it and she doesn't even like pumpkin. I didn't have any bread crumbs, but had some Low-sodium Ritz crackers so I chopped them up with the pecans in my processor. I used an egg wash and only added 1/2 cup sugar to the pumpkin butter. The grocery store only had a large pack of pork chops....but I'm glad we have leftovers!

This recipe was ok, but I probably won't make it again-BUT don't completely take my word on it, because I made my pork chops slightly different than the recipe. I mixed half & half and egg together to dip in the pork chops before rolling in the bread crumbs and pecans. I also cooked them in the oven rather than the stove. I put some pecan halves on top of the chops before cooking, which was delicious. I also accidentally forgot to put pumpkin butter on them..
