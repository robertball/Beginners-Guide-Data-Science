I have made this recipe into rolls and also baked it as a loaf in the bread machine.  Either way it turns out great and my husband loves it!

I made these for Thanksgiving, I found them to be super easy. Using the bread machine cut a lot of time off of it too.  My family really enjoyed them, but said I should make them smaller next time.

Wow such a good recipe! I used a 12 oz bottle of honey brown lager and on the 4th cup of flour I heaped it and the dough was just perfect not to stickey or too dry. Excellent recipe, thanks!! I could eat a ton of these! I even prefer these over some of the sweeter recipes I have!!There is a recipe on this site Easy slow cooker french dip that would make a great sandwich using these rolls. thanks again for a great one!!

There were absolutely delicious!  If I could give it 100 stars, I would.  I used light beef and left out the cinnamon since I was serving the rolls with beef stew.  I did use 12 oz. beer and had to add at least 1/4 cup more flour.  I also did not brush the tops with butter due to diet issues.

good rolls, made in the bread machine in no time at all. I was in a hurry and skipped the flattening of the beer sparkle: they were ok just as well. They freeze well, too.

These turned out perfectly!  And it was my first time using my bread machine to make dough, so I wasn't sure if I was doing anything wrong.  I used MGD, for that's all I had.  I can see where this would have been better with a darker beer.  But since we were going for more of a plain roll, it was perfect.    I melted the butter with a clove of chopped garlic and spread on top of rolls before baking, then sprinkled rosemary and sea salt when they were done.    Delicious!

Wow!! Easy, fluffy and great! I used 12 oz Labatt Blue Light Lime (on hand) and added extra 1/4 c. flour and used agave nectar instead of honey since I'm a vegan.  Didn't wait for beer to go flat, put all ingredients in my bread machine on dough setting. Took it out after it was mixed and had risen. Left it out for about an hour, then made it into snail shaped rolls, left them uncovered on the counter and went out for 2 1/2 hours and then came back and popped the cookie sheet in the oven - they were still awesome!  Yeasty, fluffy and slightly crusty on the top. Only thing I would change would be 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1/4.  Easy and wonderful even with all of my deliberate and accidental alterations.

Wow.  I really wasn't expecting much, but decided to give this a try to use up a can of beer my niece left while house-sitting.  It wasn't a dark beer and I didn't  bother to wait on it to go flat.  I also used regular all-purpose flour (because that's all I had on hand).  I doubled the salt and used 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon.  These were fabulous!  Everyone loved them.  Yes -- they taste just like the rolls at Texas Roadhouse.  Next time I'll have to whip up some cinnamon honey butter to slater on them!  Thank you for the recipe!  **Made cinnamon honey butter by taking one softened stick of butter and mixing in 1/4 cup of honey, 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and 1 tsp. of  cinnamon.  I mixed it until all was incorporated and it was light and fluffy.  So delicious on these rolls!

Added Poppy and Sesame seeds on top.  Outside came out a little hard, but nice and soft on the inside.  Not bad, but not outstanding either.

These rolls came out just right. Often, even though I use the correct measurements making bread/rolls etc, I find the dough is too sticky, but this dough was very easy to handle. My other half really enjoyed them. I personally prefer lighter rolls, but I made these because I had some leftover Guinness to use up. I hate to waste anything. :)

i used a full bottle of beer, and it still wasn't enough for 4 cups of flour. i added about 1/4 more liquid, and ended up with a very nice dough. the recipe also needs more salt to bring out the bread's flavor.

This was an easy recipe for someone who never makes bread. I felt compelled to for Thanksgiving and so I gave this a shot. I didnâ€™t have a bread maker to use so I let the yeast and beer sit for approximately 10 minutes. Then added the dry ingredients and kneaded the dough for about 10 minutes before forming into rolls and following the rest of the directions. I, unfortunately, overlooked them ever so slightly because I was expecting them to look a bit browner on top. I would go by the timer and not by the outward appearance if I made them again.

I was skeptical because I hate beer and I can normally taste it in about everything I make with beer. Some friends had come over and left beer behind and I didn't want to waste it so this was one of the recipes I tried. Very good. I really liked it. Would never have guessed that this was made with beer had I not made them. Didn't change a thing.

Getting written in my personal cookbook. I had two half bottles of beer and they came out great.

 Two changes I made were using cornmeal for the pan instead of flour and brushing with butter after baking instead of before (after reading a review complaining of a hard crust). 

Awesome texture, really reminds me of my paternal grandmother's lost dinner roll recipe! 

The cinnamon is a terrific addition that I wouldn't have thought of but is absolutely perfect and does not make them dessert like!

Highly, highly recommended.

I would make these again. Everyone loved them. They were hard on the outside, and soft on the inside. Instead of butter, I used egg white to brush on the outside.

These turned out great! We don't drink alcohol, but I had another recipe that called for a can of beer...the only single beer I could find at the store was a 24oz, so I ended up with half of that left. I'm SO glad I had some leftover because I got make these rolls! Everyone loved them!

The rolls turned out soft on the inside and crispy on the outside (I used an egg wash). I used Killian's and they were a little too dense and heavy for my liking. They also lacked flavor so I fixed that by serving with cinnamon butter. All in all a very solid "tweakable" recipe.

Good flavor.  After reading the reviews, I made this into 24 rolls and they were the perfect size.  Great use for the dark beer that is always left behind from one of those "sampler" 12 packs.

Really good flavor, but I had to sprinkle in a bit more liquid to get the dough to form a ball. It's possible that I had do this because it's really dry right now in central Texas. Other than that, these rolls are a hit in my household!

A bit sweet, and a bit dry.  I'll use the entire can of beer next time and cut some of the honey.  Otherwise, very easy and good.  Thanks!

Super easy if you use the dough cycle on your bread machine.  No hand-kneading and a wonderful homeade taste!  These taste just like the rolls at the Roadhouse restaurant, and are delicious with whipped honey butter.  Almost good enough to be dessert.

Pretty yummy rolls.  My family ate them up... but I didn't think they were that fantastic.
