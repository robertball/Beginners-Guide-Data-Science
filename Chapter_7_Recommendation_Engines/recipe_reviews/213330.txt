Very good base, but leaves alot to be desired.  Pretty bland. I would make again but with more veggies.

I really liked this recipe . I did however have to add some onion and a clove of garlic. I also added some spices such as black pepper ,  chili powder, oregano and a small dash of ginger.

For my super-picky family, this was great! My young kids and I loved it! It was fast and easy, and they all had seconds and thirds! My husband added a little extra flavoring to his, but that was easy enough with salt, pepper, and other drawer spices. This will be an easy staple for our family menus.

Hubby and kids loved this. Yes it is really simple, but that is what appeals to me! This was perfect to make for a busy week day dinner. I will make again, but I think that next time I will try and find some frozen mixed soup vegetables and cook them with the noodles instead of chopping them.

Where do I start? There is a problem with the directions with this recipe. I believe step three should say "until noodles are tender". The vegetables should have already been tender at the end of step one. Bringing a mixture like this to a boil requires constant stirring or you risk the soup sticking and burning. Adding uncooked noodles means the soup will thicken as the noodles cook, which takes a LONG time. By the time the noodles were cooked, my soup was incredibly thick, barely still a soup at all. I would suggest cooking the noodles in a separate pan, straining them and adding them just before serving. Unfortunately this recipe tasted too much like canned soup to make me want to make this again.

This was really good and most of all, EASY!  I love that I this resulted in a soup that tasted like it had been cooking all day when I really just threw it together when I got home from work.  I did add some onion to it and next time I might add some peas.  I also used chicken broth instead of the milk, because, well, I didn't have any milk - ha!  Overall I was very pleased with this dish and since it's so quick, it's going in my "rotisserie chicken's on sale and it's raining so we're having soup" file.  Thanks!

This was okay, but needs a little tweaking. After reading some of the other reviews I added a clove of garlic and sauteed some onions in with the celery and carrots. My youngest one likes it, so we'll probably make it again.

As written, quite bland, but since it's so simple, it's still a winner. Next time I made it I added a little poultry seasoning.  Also, I sauteed some onion with the celery and instead of carrot, I tossed in a handful of frozen mixed veggies.  For the reviewer who said it got too thick when the noodles were cooked in the soup, if you look in the ingredients list, it does say to add COOKED noodles.  If you cook the noodles in the soup, it releases its starch into the soup and acts as a thickener.

Needed thyme, salt and pepper, poultry seasoning and parsley. Have to season it well or itâ€™s boring

I made this recipe.used chicken thighs. I cooked the chicken, carrots, celery together and added salt, pepper, basil, garlic powder and onions while they were cooking, in a small amount of water.  took meat off the bone and strained the vegetables out of the water. saved water. mixed soup and milk together and added into meat and vegetables.  cooked my noodles and then added. if too thick add some of your water until it is the consistency that you want...this was delicious and everyone loved it...easy and fast and I will make this again...
