This cake is truly excellent.  Be sure to beat the sugar/butter for about 7 minutes to ensure enough air is incorporated.  Also, I use dessicated coconut (I buy it online) and it makes a WONDERFUL improvement - none of that "chew chew chew" feeling with the supermarket kind.  Has a stronger coconut taste, and lends a firmness that makes this wonderful cake even better!

I've made this recipe twice now for company and have had only rave reviews!  However, I always end up having to bake it for at 2 hours.  ALso, I thought it was just a bit too sweet so the second time I made it I used a half cup less sugar and it tasted wonderful.

This is a fabulous cake!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and it turned out wonderfully.  I baked it as a birthday cake, and got tons of compliments.  I doubled the amount of coconut extract, reduced the sugar to 2 cups, and pulsed the coconut in the food processor just briefly.  I also used Egg Beaters equivalent to 4 of the eggs.  Delicious!!

OMG! This pound cake is awesome! If you love coconut this cake is for you. I followed the recipe exactly and used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer to beat everything so it was nice and fluffy. I also let everything get to room temperature before mixing. It baked up beautifully in exactly 1 hour and 20 minutes and the smell in the house was nothing less than heavenly. Make no mistake, this cake is rich and dense so it's not something you'd make on a regular basis but it definitely fits the bill for special occasions. I served it with fresh strawberries, whipped cream and toasted coconut - YUM!

Great recipe. Just the right amount of coconut flavor. Very moist and great texture. The key is to use real butter and to cream the butter, cream cheese, and sugar until they are truly light and fluffy. I halved the recipe and baked in a loaf pan for 1 hr, 20 mins. Came out great!

I am a die hard coconut fan and this is the most amazing cake i've ever made!  My mom and i couldn't wait for it to leave the oven and i was told that i could no longer make that cake in the house....because we'd eat it all!!  It has even now been added to the dessert menu at my restaurant as a strawberry shortcake and before the words are even out of my mouth the cake is gone.  thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

We tried this recipe as an entry for the county fair so we baked several over the course of a week. The texture was wonderful and the taste was very "Sara Lee". One caution I would make. Although we cooked it for the full 1 hr and 20 minutes and it appeared to be done by testing with a skewer, when cooled and cut at the fair there were small pockets which were not fully cooked. So my advice would be to bake it 1 hr and 25 minutes. This is wonderful with fresh strawberries
or ice cream. It freezes well too.

This was a hit for Thanksgiving.  I did make the following changes per my Granny's recipe along with other reviewers' comments: 3 sticks of butter vs 2, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 2 cups of dessicated coconut, cake flour, 1/8 teaspoon of salt.  I also made sure that all ingredients were at room temperature prior to mixing.  Also, I baked at a temperature of 300 starting in a cool oven (no preheating).  This recipe yields enough batter for a bundt pan & a small loaf pan. It was VERY moist & delicious.

This cake is delightful!!  I read that others had to cook the cake a bit longer than the recipe called for, but I arrived home late.  If you just intend to serve it at home or if you are covering the cake with strawberries and cream and presentation isn't as important you might do as I did.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 inch pan and it was done in less than an hour.  While it cooked I prepared supper and then used the pre-heated oven to cook my dinner.  I made the recipe just as given except I did add more coconut extract.  To be honest, as much as I LOVE the flavor of coconut, I wish I had not because I served mine with strawberries and cream and the coconut taste was a little strong.  Perhaps alone or with just whipping cream the extra flavor would be more appealing.  Thank you for this recipe it is really tasty!!

This was so easy to make and turned out wonderfully.  I used a bundt pan and ended up baking it 10 minutes longer than the recipe says.  This is an excellent cake to make for a picnic and is delicious served with fruit.

I made this recipe using several of the suggestions in the reviews (2 1/2 cups sugar instead of the three, vanilla extract in addition to coconut, put the coconut in the food processor).  It baked up beautifully and was DELICIOUS.  I recommend baking it the day before you need it, because it is BEYOND DELICIOUS the next day!  My father is a huge fan of coconut pound cake, and he was thrilled with this, which I baked for his birthday.  Thanks to all those reviewers out there and the tips you contribute.  I depend on this website and the reader-input.

I'm giving this 5 stars for taste even though mine did crumble when I cut it.  I love the moistness and texture.  I also used dessicated coconut as another reviewer suggested.  Great with whipped cream and strawberries on top.

I would give this 5 stars with this adjustment...in a food processor chop the (sweetened) coconut with 2TBS canola oil. the cake will come out really moist and stay moist for days on the counter. IMO it was not too sweet, blame my sweet tooth i guess?

My family all enjoyed this cake.Could have been a little on the sweet side but the texture was great,moist and dense.I also found that it took 15 mins extra to complete and the top was a little crusty.I will certainly make this cake again.

This cake turned out great!!! I did not have any cream cheese so I utilized sour cream instead. I did add more coconut extract. I did not add the shredded coconut to my cake batter. I used five eggs instead of six. I also made a great glaze out of coconut milk and confectioners sugar.  I glazed the cake and sprinkled shredded coconut onto the glazed cake. The cake was moist and everyone loved the glaze!!!!  It's popular ha!

Very disapointing.  This cake was extremely dry and crumbly.  I followed the directions exactly and baked it for the stated amount of time.  I believe that the problem may be that it needs another stick of butter.  My "go to" cream cheese pound cake calls for the same amount of all ingredients except for butter.  I may try it again and add a stick of butter.

Since I love coconut a TON, I used this instead of regular pound cake in trifle. It was fantastic, and everybody raved about it. This pound cake makes an excellent layer cake - just top it with coconut cream cheese frosting, and I guarantee that people will love it! I do it all the time, and people always ask for the recipe.

EXCELLENT POUND CAKE RECIPE!  This is my new favorite because as written, it makes for an extra-moist and extra-flavorful cake.  The only change I made was to substitute almond extract for the coconut extract.  Next time I make this, I'm going to add 1 tablespoon of the almond extract.  Thank for sharing this recipe; we loved it!!

Using a few tweaks suggested by others, this was a crowd pleaser and gets 5 stars! I doubled the coconut extract, reduced sugar to 2 cups and processed the flaked coconut briefly in the food processor. Very flavorful and moist. Thanks for sharing this one!

This is a fabulous cake! I read some concerns from others about the crust being hard. What I remember about my grandmother's sour cream pound cake was the wonderful crusty outside and the moist, dense inside. This brought back many memories! I would have liked to use dessicated coconut, but couldn't find any right away, so I pulsed the 2 cups of flaked coconut in the food processor until it was medium fine. I did bake it about 5 min more than called for. The only other change I made was when I inverted the cake onto a plate, I poured about 2 tablespoons of rum over the bottom and let that soak in. This is now one of my favorite cakes, and it is so easy to make!

I did hesitate for some time whether to give this cake 3 or 4 stars as it is quite dry. My partner though, liked it and doesn't mind the dryness and so I have given it 4 stars but I am not really into cake eating as much as I am into making them and like my cakes a little moister. The flavour nonetheless is lovely. I didn't alter the ingredients and and the sweetness was spot on for me.

Wonderful texture and flavor. I made it in two layers and they baked in 40 minutes in my convection oven. I want to use this for a tiered layer cake for my parents' 50th wedding anniversary in a few months and I may do another trial reducing the flour slightly and/or removing the yolks from a couple of the eggs, just to make it a smidgen fluffier. Perfect with coconut cream cheese icing, as others have suggested.

Wonderful cake.  I added mini chocolate chips to mine and it turned out amazing.  Wonderful coconut flavor.  Not at all over powering.  We dipped ours into a hot fudge sauce and it was to die for!!!  Will make this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I wanted to use up a package of cream cheese which was sitting in the fridge for a long time, but I didn't have a 10" tube pan.  So I halved the recipe but used 1 package of cream cheese instead of 1/2 package of cream cheese and 1/2 cup butter (I didn't use butter at all), and I used an 8"x4" loaf pan, topped with coconut flakes. I was worried about using this recipe because the reviews are exreme.  Then I doubled the baking powder.  It turned out very moist and dense!  I baked @325 degrees for 1hr and 30 mins.  It was perfect!

This was the perfect pound cake recipe!  We made it as written in two loaf pans and it was fantastic.  We made another in a bundt pan but left out the flaked coconut and added some orange food coloring swirled around and it was decadant and creamy.  I'm going to save this as my go-to pound cake recipe - it will be perfect with any flavor.

OMG! Those were the 1st words out of my husbands mouth when he tasted this delicious piece of heaven. I used Plugra butter and Swan's cake flower and that made all the difference. Like another reviewer said use real butter. This is great the way it is. Thank you for sharing;)

This is an amazing pound cake!!  So easy to make and it was moist and the flavour incredible.  I did make the mistake when halving the recipe, I put in the full package of cream cheese. Frankly it made no difference. (Thank goodness!)  Tasty and incredible, a must try for anyone.

This is an easy and delicious cake! I did add a half teaspoon of rum flavoring as well. Be sure to blend the sugar, butter, eggs and cream cheese thoroughly. I blended mine on high speed for about 4-5 minutes or until it doubled in size.

I let mine cool for 10 minutes and it came out of the pan very easily. Very moist and I will definitely make it again.

Excellent pound cake! I didn't have a tube pan so I just used two 9" loaf pans and things turned out wonderfully. I had to cook it an extra 10 minutes and though the cake didn't need it, I frosted one with some vanilla icing mixed with the leftover shredded coconut. A hit with everyone (even those who don't like coconut) and very easy to make!

Don't be misled (as I was) by the reviews saying it needs to bake longer. Set your timer and then test. I cooked mine an extra 15 minutes per many reviews and it was too dry. Good flavor. I am slicing the cake and going to use if for a trifle but may not even try this recipe again.

Took this to work and topped with the Vanilla Glaze (substituting coconut extract for the vanilla) from this site. It was phenomenal and got rave reviews from my co-workers.

This was delicious!  As others suggested, I doubled the coconut extract and cut the sugar to 2.5 cups.  The baking time was spot on for my bundt pan. Served with fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream...yummy!

Excellent pound cake! Moist and dense, just like it should be. I used almond extract instead of coconut simply because I didn't have any, but the almond added wonderful flavor and really complimented the coconut. I used my bundt pan, and this turned out wonderul. Be sure to cream the butter/sugar mixture very well, I let my Kitchen Aid do all the work about 7-8 minutes. I dusted this lightly with powedered sugar when cooled, that's all this cake needs. I will use this recipe again for sure, it's delicious :)

This was awesome!!  Friends and family who don't like coconut even loved it.  I made a glaze using powdered sugar, milk, and coconut extract for a little added flavor.  This is a definite keeper.

I submitted this recipe originally. I use a 6 ounce package of frozen coconut (thawed) instead of flaked coconut. The texture is much better with the frozen variety.

I always make a recipe the way it was entered just to be fair on the review.  The cake was very good.  Next time I would cut back on the sugar and double the coconut extract.  I had to cook it five minutes more in order for my knife to come out clean.  It was very moist the first day but the second day it seemed a little dry more like coffee cake.  I will make this again, it was a big hit with the family.

When other users said this recipe was dense they really meant it!  I'm all for a dense cake but not when it feels like you are serving up rock buns.  The flavor was good but it was too dense and not at all moist.  I used low fat cream cheese because I had it in the house already, perhaps this contributed to its density issues.  If I were to do it again, I'd add double the amount of baking soda and 50g of coconut cream for flavor and moisture.

This was good, not the best pound cake I have tasted.  The coconut adds a nice twist. Needed 15 more min as I used a bundt pan. Cut sugar by half a cup, as per other reviews. Kids approved. Maybe I will add crushed pineapple next time and a little vanilla :)

made exactly as directed; used a silicone bundt pan.  I had to bake addt'l 20 mins. in order for cake to be done;  Good coconut flavor, but outside was dark and crusty before inside of cake was done...  I was okay with it, but most people were not.... I probably will not make this again...

On the dry side but dense and moist on the inside.  The sweetened coconut flakes add a punch of "sugary" sweetness.  Doesn't seem worth all the fat and calories.

This cake is phenomenal. I did cupcakes and it made about 30-36. Fill the baking cups about 3/4 full of batter and bake for 20 minutes at 350. My favortie cake EVER! I frosted with the special buttercream recipe from this site and instead of using vanilla extract in the frosting I used coconut extract. SO SO GOOD.

Awesome cake!! It is definately a keeper. I did split the batter and made to bundt cakes. Once I poured half of the batter in the first pan I mixed in 1 cup of chopped almonds and put it in the rest of the batter. The one with the almonds came out a little more moist than the one without. I then brought out half of each cake for my neighbors to try and they were very pleased with both but most of them liked the ones with the almonds. I also cooked the cakes for 1 hr and 5 min.

I thought this cake was great!  I made it in a bundt pan, plenty of room.  It is a pound cake so it is a little heavier than other cakes but that is to be expected.  I added 2 tsp. of extract instead of 1 and it was good and I pulsed the coconut in the processor to make the pieces a little smaller.  I also made a rum glaze with powdered sugar, milk and rum extract to put over it and that was the finishing touch. Thanks 19connie61 for the recipe!

OUTSTANDING! This is a wonderful recipe! Absolutely delicious!

Just a side note...I finished mine off by pouring a hot pineapple rum glaze into the hot cake pan as soon as I removed it from the oven. It was perfect! (you can contact me if you need the glaze recipe)

Thanks again for a wonderful recipe and I will be making this again! I also told my cousin who is insane over coconut and forwarded this recipe on to her!!

Made this for a friend who doesn't like overly sweet desserts so I decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups. I must admit that I didnt' miss the sugar. Other than the cake being a little dry, it was good.

I want to make this cake for a birthday party this weekend, but wanted to try it out with my family first. I did put an extra teaspoon of coconut extract. I used only 2 cups of sugar. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I used 2 teaspoon of baking powder. I baked as directed except for the last 30 minutes. I reduced the heat to 300 since the edges seem to brown too quickly. Let's just say that my husband had his second piece. It was moist and very tasty even without icing! Definitely a keeper! ;) UPDATE: 10/9/2011- I made the cake for the birthday party as planned. Everyone loved it! Oh and I did add about 1/2 cup of milk.

If you love coconut you will love this cake! I did not have a tube pan so I made one bundt cake and one loaf with the batter. I used 1 1/2 tsp. of coconut extract and pulsed the 2 cups of coconut in the food processor a bit, otherwise followed the recipe as is. Make sure yourr ingredients including the eggs are room temperature before you begin...this cake is absolutely delicious. I can't wait to try it with some frozen (thawed) wild blueberries and their juice.

This cake is amazing!!! i learned my lesson though, DO NOT use silicone bakeware....it's awful!! But this recipe turned out great!! The only thing that I might add to this recipe would be maybe 1/2 tsp more of coconut extract! I took it to my boyfriends house for thanksgiving and his whole family loved it!!! Enjoy!!

I've baked this many times and it never disappoints! I add about 1/2 t. almond extract to the batter and it just adds a hint of sweetness. I baked one last night and between my dad and my boyfriend, it was gone in a couple of hours so I'll have to bake another one tonight for the people coming over for dinner. I always make sure to beat the eggs into the batter one at a time and then beat for about a minute after each one. It's one of the easiest recipes ever and always comes out great!!!

Tasted great and was a perfect texture a few hours out of the oven. The next day, however, it was very dry and not very good.

This cake is fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. It's moist and very flavorful. It's a great solid cake that's really good to trim and decorate. It holds it's shape very well under buttercream and fondant. I layered it with pineapple buttercream and it was a hit!

This cake is die for. I used a bundt pan, cause I didn't have a tube pan and it turned out great. I did cook it 10 minutes longer, but it was probably done 10 minutes earlier. When making a pound cake you want to let your cold ingredients come to room temp first. So, I sit my eggs, butter and cream cheese out to get to room temp. I also sifted the flour and baking soda together, befor adding them to the batter. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Very good recipe.  I used it to make a wedding cake for my father in law and it turned out not only tasty, but a solid base for using fondant to cover the cakes.  I frosted it with homemade buttercream with additional coconut extract.  Got rave reviews and my husband is picky about sweets.

I used only 1 1/2 sticks of butter, decreased sugar by 1 cup, and served it with whipped topping and strawberries. Yum! I love the coconut extract in it. (Also, I pulverized the coconut in my food processor so it wouldn't be big chunks.) It was very good, but it could have been more moist.

I disagree with the other reviewers who stated this cake was dry. I found this cake to be deliciously moist. I made it for my mom several months ago who is a coconut fanatic. She absolutely loved as did I. I thought it was a fantastic recipe. It's the only coconut cake recipe I use.

I REALLY HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THIS CAKE, BUT IT TURNED OUT REALLY DENSE AND CRUMBLY. I HAD COOKED IT FOR ABOUT 15 MIN. LONGER THAN DIRECTED. IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME AND INGREDIENTS.

After enjoying the aroma of this cake in the oven, I didn't even get to taste it, if that tells you anything. I'm told it was different and delicious.

Im giving 3 stars because this recipe needs work.  Dryness is a factor with this one. It needs another stick of butter and a 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream added alternately with the flour.  Also, 3 teaspoons of coconut flavoring plus 2 tablespoons of vanilla. The cook time is too long. I cooked for an hour and 20 minutes and should have pulled this out after the first hour.  This cake cooks quickly. Overall, not terrible but I feel like I cooked a cake that I cannot eat because of the dryness and this cake is not cheap to make.

I made this for my mother's 55th Birthday. It's perfect! I followed the directions  exactly  as they were written. The cake was super moist with just the right density.I made 12 mini square loaves it took about 55 minutes to bake. People should remember that cooking time varies depending on the pans your using, your altitude, and the variance of your ovens actual temperature. I will be making a lot more of this cake! Thanks for the great recipe.

This cake was so wonderful! I made it as my birthday cake and served it with whipped cream and sliced strawberries. Good thing it's a big cake, because every single person, both children and adults, came back for seconds. I used unsweetened organic coconut flakes, which I think was key for keeping it from being overly sweet, and the large flakes gave it a great coconut chewiness. If the leftovers last long enough to begin to dry out, you can take care of that by topping it with your favorite ice cream!

I followed this recipe exactly, but it took me two hours to cook!  The crust was so dry, but the inside would not firm up.  Although I liked the taste of the inside, the overcooked crust really spoiled this cake.  As written its not something I will bake again.

I took the advice of others and cut the sugar to 2 cups. I also doubled the coconut extract to 2 tsp.  Also, I made sure to sift the flour to avoid baking a very dense cake.  I also left out the coconut flakes, because, although I like the taste of coconut, I don't like the texture.
 It was good, but I wouldn't call it a "cream cake."  It was a crumbly pound cake.  I mixed a quick vanilla glaze to serve it with.  The cake soaked up the glaze, which made it much more decadent and sweet.  If I bake it again, I think I will add the extra cup of sugar to make it sweeter.

The only reason I gave this cake four stars is because mine came out a bit too crumbly...but I feel that may have been due to chef error as opposed to recipe error. :) Also, I wasn't able to find coconut extract at the supermarket so I used "buko pandan' extract (I live in the Philippines) and even though the cake was green it was delicious!!!! This might be something for Filipino chefs to consider.

This is excellent!  I just finished making this, following a few of the suggestions, such as reducing the sugar to 2.5 cups and processing the coconut for the batter.  The taste and texture are superb!  The sweetness is perfect.  I frosted with a coconut/cream cheese frosting from this site and topped with toasted coconut.  Decadent!

FANTASTIC! I really wanted a good coconut flavor, so I used 3/4 teaspoon of coconut oil instead of the extract, and that was perfect for us! It smelled so wonderful while baking, that we couldn't even wait for it to cool to try some, lol. I'm serving this with macerated strawberries and whipped cream for dessert and can hardly wait. I agree that beating your ingredients for a LONG time is key in making this poundcake exceptional. I will be making this very often! thanks for sahring. :)

I loved this cake! I am nuts about coconut so I was really looking forward to making this. The only thing that could have made it better is if it was just a little more moist, but I will try and beat my butter/cream cheese/sugar longer next time to incorporate more air into it and make it fluffier hopefully. This cake goes perfect with a nice big dallop of cool whip! Tastes great like that!

This was a really lovely cake and kept fresh for about a week, although it was hard to keep it for that long!  I just halved the recipe and made it in a loaf tin.  I did find it very sweet and I think I would cut down on the sugar as suggested my others members.

This cake is excellent. I think it's the best pound cake I ever made or even tasted. I don't quite understand those who claim it is dry. I think they may not be much of a pound cake fan, because the texture here is text book accurate! I do reduce the sugar to 2.5 cups and use unsweetended, powdered coconut. I also add a tsp of vanilla to the tsp of coconut extract, as vanilla brings out other flavors beautifully. Have made it a few times already; it's a keeper.

Yum, yum, yum! Moist, fragrant, tender and simply delicious. Freezes well and tastes even better when you pop a slice into the microwave for a few seconds prior to serving. However, I'm taking one star off because I feel it would have been virtually inedible with 3 cups of sugar! 2 cups is just the perfect amount. I used 1 tsp of coconut extract which gave it a beautiful subtle flavour, dessicated coconut instead of the shredded and only 5 eggs (medium size), since I didn't want to risk an eggy taste. I will be making this again often!

This was super easy! One bowl! I didn't use any icing so it was a tad dry. But I brushed on some simple syrup with rum extract in it- yum! This would make a wonderful cake layer. The only change I made was reducing the sugar a bit because I was using sweetened coconut flakes.

hi this is my first time reviewing a recipe. first thing I changed a couple of things but a good base recipe anyway. Used 2 cups of sugar, I thought 3 was a bit much, and added 1/2tsp of salt,1 1/2tsp vanilla and 1 1/2tsp almond didn't have any coconut extract and 1tsp instead of half baking powder. delicious,very moist and great coconut flavor thanks for posting

A very yummy and flavorful cake.  It's easy to eat more than you should.  Weird but the top half was a lot better then the bottom half, maybe due to oven postioning?

This is by far the BEST coconut pound cake recipe ever! It absolutely NEVER disappoints. The only change I made is to add about 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to the batter. Otherwise, it is just fantastic!

I'm a coconut freak!  I loved this cake, it was perfect.  I did make a half batch in a bread pan and servied with whipped cream and strawberries.  I did add a little extra coconut extract but that was just to my taste.

Pretty good.  I did not have coconut extract so just used vanilla.  It had a good flavor but I wanted more coconut flavor so I will def buy some coconut extract!  It took a lot longer than 1 hr 20 minutes, not sure how much longer though b/c I checked it frequently so it didn't overbake.

This is a delicious cake. I read other reviews and cooked the cake longer, only to realize I may have cooked it a tad too long - still very good - just a dark brown crust that was a little tough. I still had rave reviews. Made a coconut cream cheese icing - mmmmm.

I added zest of one lime. It was extremely tasty, but not as limey as you think it would be. It was a hit though!

The cake tasted great, which is why I gave it a high score even though the outside burned before the inside was cooked.  I'm not sure how that happened, but I scrapped off the burned stuff and it was good.

I baked the cake in a bundt pan, and had to bake it 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for. The texture was nice, but the cake had a thick crust that I didn't care for. I also wished that it would have had a more pronounced coconut flavor. So, I would say that the cake was o.k., but I most likely won't be making it again.

I used this recipe for my first ever pound cake and it was excellent. The taste and texture was perfect. It was sweet for a pound cake, but I liked that. If you don't like sweet cake, reduce the sugar measure.  I was so impressed with my first pound cake that I deceided to try it again as a lemon pound cake.  I ommitted the coconut flavoring and the coconut, added the zest and the juice of one lemon. I topped it with a lemon glaze after it cooled. It was just as good as the first one. This one is a keeper for me!

Tasted good, if you like eating the batter.  I baked this for 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for, and still, it was no where near set and turned out of the pan into a pile of mush.  Don't know what went wrong, but I don't think I'll try this one again.

J had no trouble with this receipe other than it took longer (about 15 mins) than expected to bake. It was moist and very flavorable and not dry at all. It probably would dry out if you left in in too long and didn;t keepa  close eye on how it's progressing. I topped it with the satiny chocolate glaze from this site and a little tinted coconut on top and it tasted like a mounds bar. My family loved it. Will definitely make a gain...probably for Easter.

I love baking cakes and am willing to try new recipes that sound good. I made this for my husband's birthday and it tasted awful! It was so dry, overly dense and tasted more like a sweet, stale bread than a cake. I thought having 5 stars it would have tasted better!

Perfect!  I did tweak the recipe just a bit, based on others' comments.  I cut back on the sugar, to about two-and-a-half cups.  Also, I used two tsps of coconut extract (although I feared a too-artificial taste).  Finally, I sprinkled some of the coconut into the greased (not floured) non-stick bundt pan.  This last step seemed to create a more "crispy" topping once the cake came (easily) out of the pan.  Cake was great -- very moist, "heavy" in a nice poundcake way, and kept very well for several days.  Excellent!  Will make again!

This cake is awesome. I've made it twice now and the whole family loved it. Even those averse to eating cake had several helpings! It wasn't too hard and it didn't crumble. I followed other reviews and used the processor to make the coconut flakes more minute, and i also used just two cups of sugar as I'm not a sweet tooth, and two cups was still very sweet, but perfect! Thanks for sharing the recipe...

This cake is really good. The next time I make it I will probably try gratting up the coconut a little, so that it will be a little easier to cut. I took it to a family dinner and they liked it. I will bake it again.

This cake was incredibly moist. I made it into cupcakes and cut down the baking time to about 30-40 minutes. I also used only 1 cup of flaked coconut and that was plenty for my taste. I took the cupcakes to a baby shower and everyone raved about them. I was even asked what bakery I got them from.

I'm undecided between 3 and 4 stars.  I thought the taste of the cake was good, but it was very dry.  However, my husband and I unfortunately had left our oven on broil from a previous cooking activity, so while the temp of the oven was correct, the cake began its baking with the heat source coming from the top.  This might have dried out the cake, but not sure.  I will try this cake one more time, but I recommend a very similar cake on this site called "Incredibly Delicious Italian Cream Cake" which is very moist and tastes great.  These two cakes have different ingredients but very similar tastes--the Italian Cream Cake is better though.

I baked this cake in 3 9-inch rounds for about 30 minutes and then used the Buttercream Frosting II recipe from this site to frost the cake and that was a very nice accompaniment.  This is a very easy cake to prepare and clean-up is incredibly fast.  You end up only needing to use one measuring cup size and only two sizes of measuring spoons, so it's quick and easy.

If you love coconut and cream cheese you won't be disappointed in this recipe! It's fantastic!! I baked 1hr 35mins - after the 1hr 20min cook time in recipe, I checked with knife every 5mins so I wouldn't over bake. Waited 10mins and turned over onto serving platter to cool. Served with sliced strawberries and cool whip. Even people who don't like coconut liked this cake with the toppings! A definite winner!

I found this to be very dry and therefore gave it a 2.  I would not make it again.  I moistened it with strawberry sauce ( maybe the flavor was not the right one to choose) but it did not help enough.   I might have made a good base for bread pudding?

Made this as desert for a family dinner and it was a hit. The only change I made was I reduced the sugar to 2 cups .  I also pulsed the coconut in a food processor. It is definitely a recipe I will use again.

Great tasting cake but couldn’t really taste the coconut in it even after increasing the coconut extract to 1 tablespoon. Based on other recipes, I only made a light glaze and toasted coconut to sprinkle over it since I thought it would make it super sweet.

I changed the flavors adding lemon and orange to one and almond and chocolate to the other loaf came out perfect.

This cake was very tasty but I'm really glad I cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups. I think you could even cut it back a bit more as others have suggested because it is on the sweet side. The flavor was really good, but if I make it again I might increase the coconut extract a little bit. The cake wasn't dry, but it is dense as pound cakes usually are. I was thinking that a little vegetable oil in the batter would make it a bit moister if that's what you are looking for.

This cake is delightfully moist and rich but not too sweet, even with the light glaze I decided to add (powdered sugar, coconut extract, milk). I'll definitely be making this again. It baked in exactly one hour and twenty minutes, too. No fuss, no muss. A real winner of a recipe!

Awesome recipe! I was a little concerned about it turning out dry after reading some reviews, so I added about 1/3 C sour cream, and did 2 1/2 C sugar instead of 3, and used unsweetened coconut. I made a lime glaze (the juice from 1 fresh lime + 1 tsp coconut extract + powdered sugar until I had the right consistency) Fantastic!!

This is a really great cake. I did everything exactly according to the recipe except I threw in the zest of one small lime while beating the sugar/butter/cheese. I made two loaf pan-sized cakes with this; cooked for 1 hour 20 and then shut off the oven and left it in the cooling oven for anther 10 minutes or so. 
SO very good.

This cake is fabulous!  I made a 3 tier cake and this one was gone in two seconds and people kept asking for more!  I made a cream cheese and pineapple filling for between the layers.  Delicious!  Wonderful consistency and perfect denseness.

For those that read through the reviews, the best advice I can give is to say that a bundt pan is not a 10” tube pan.    The fluted sides and narrower bottom of a bundt pan make it smaller in capacity than a standard 10” tube pan.   That doesn’t mean you can't use a bundt pan (I did), it just means that you need to adjust your bake time and/or temp or you’re not going to get the same result.  This was my first time making a “real” pound cake and it was delicious.  My intention was to serve with berries, but it was a bigger hit just served plain.

nice flavor - I cut the sugar (used 2c) as i could not find any unsweetened coconut. in a do-over I might increase that abit. I think this would be super as a shortcake base. I also liked the lime glaze idea - it does need a little punching up with whatever you choose.

This was fabulous and moist.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers' and only used 2 1/2 cups of sugar and 2 teaspoons of coconut extract, plus I baked it in a Bundt pan.  I have made many types of pound cake and as a rule, I bake them in Bundt pans every time.  I have found that when baking them in tube pans, I tend to overbake them.  I also started checking for doneness after about an hour in the oven and then kept letting it go back to bake five minutes at a time, for a total bake time of about an hour and fifteen minutes.  I served it plain and we all loved it.

Mmmm. I've been looking for a cake recipe w/ a kick - something different than plain ol' cake. The coconut flavor is wonderful.  Only used 2 cups sugar & doubled coconut extract. Made a 3-layer 8-inch round cake, tasted great with frosting. Hesitated on giving the 5th star because the cake was hard. I wonder if anyone else had that issue. I wish it was just a bit softer in texture. But the flavor is wonderful & I will def use this recipe again. If I could give it 4 1/2, I would have!

I used this recipe for a small cakke in the centre of my cupcake display at my wedding. I iced it with cream cheese icing and placed needle fleted birds in a nest on top. Although the cake took forever to bake despite the small size and it was VERY crusty on the outside, it was delicious and I recieved the highest praises from those that ate up the scraps as I cut the top even. I am now making it for my inlaws for their wedding aniversary as they requested it especially!

I made this cake for my boss on his birthday because he likes coconut. I picked it because I know some people don't like the texture of coconut and on a traditional coconut cake you put lots of flaked coconut on the outside but this had lots on the inside. I did reduce sugar by 1 cup but made with sweetened coconut flakes. I made in a bundt pan so reduced cooking time by 10 min. and I put the Coconut Cream Cheese icing on top (I reduced sugar in this recipe also because I wanted a thinner, glaze type icing)I brought flaked coconut with me so those that wanted to could put more on top. It was delicious and my boss asked to have another piece. I will definitely make again.

Wow! What a surprise. I made half a batch and baked in a loaf pan, afraid that not may people would like this one much, because in my family, they are a bit picky about the texture of coconut flakes in recipes. I had some leftover chocolate icing, which I drizzled on top after melting in the microwave, and I was experimenting with a fondant recipe from this site(which did not turn out so good:(...)and topped the cake with it. To my surprise, everyone loooooooved thios cake! Perfect consistency, texture and taste! My mom said that she liked the fact that it was heavy in weight, but not too dense. SHe was amazed at how good it was. I was shocked, because I really did  not expect anyone to like it so much. I was even debating at whether I should even bring it to our family dinner! Wow! thanks so much, that is definately a keeper!

Very good. I didn't have a tube pan so I did half as cupcakes with mini chocolate chips and the rest in a 9x9 pan without the chips. Preferred without as a cake. Good on its own but was also good with some ice cream and chocolate sauce.
THANKS! A keeper!

Made this as a 3 layer b-day cake. Got great reviews and even heard this was the best cake I've made. Very moist and flavorful!

This was an ok cake. I doubled it and put it in two jelly roll pans, plus a 9x9 pan. I cooked it for 45 minutes, which was too long and it came out very dry. The flavor was good though, I just had high expectations. I also paired it with the chocolate coconut cream cheese frosting from this site, and it was way too much coconut and cream cheese flavors together. Next time, I'll frost it with something else and watch the cooking time more closely.

The only thing that stopped me from giving this 4 stars is the fact that it made the perfect shortcake for my vanilla ice cream and strawberries.  I DO think, as another reviewer stated, that it is more of a biscuit/shortcake texture. It is definitely not creamy.  I do not suggest using this recipe for a birthday cake. Is very dense....but tastes on point.

Delicious! Very coconutty, and very dense. I made jumbo cupcakes (baked for 28 minutes at recipe temp) and they were great. Frosted with "Study Whipped Cream Frosting" from this site, using coconut extract in place of the almond. Followed other reviewers' suggestions for this: used 2 cups sugar, 3 eggs worth of egg substitute. Will definitely make again for all my coconut fans.

Great easy recipe!  After it is sliced toast the pound cake or grill it so that it is warm and serve it with some nonfat yogurt or fruit!

This was very good. Mine was dry. But I had baked pears with sauce on the side. The cake with the pears was so good! I will make again. The pears were a simple baked pear recipe with apple juice, lemon juice, sugar, cinnamon, baked for 30 mins.

I usually don't like cake all that much but I liked this.  I prepared this recipe exactly as written.  My only complaint was that I thought it was a little dry.  Served with icecream though, this would be great!

This was very good, very thick and full of flavor.  I baked it in a bundt pan as others sujested.  The only thing was cutting it was a little tricky.  I had a beautiful crust on top and it broke up as I was cutting it, next time I will but it in the freezer for 5 minutes before cutting or use a cupcake pan instead of the bundt.  It is a very pretty cake too.  Thanks

My co-worker gave me this recipe to make for her birthday, unfortunately, she did not read the reviews.  I followed the recipe to a tee, and it was so dry and tasteless.  Many reviews state this, however the ones who rave about it, certainly baffles me.  I will never make it again.

This bread is a favorite - people fall in love with it - even those who aren't too crazy about coconut.  Plus its simple to make.  I didn't change a thing.  It does take the full baking time though so be prepared to stay around awhile.

I am soo bummed mine turned out over-done, because it would have been great had I not over-cooked it.  I used 2 (stoneware) loaf pans and baked for 1 hr 20 min then checked it and it was already over-done.  Will definately check much sooner next time.  Believe me, there will be a next time.  It was still good and can't imagine how heavenly it would be if it were cooked properly!

This is a really yummy cake!  A bit more crumbly than I had anticipated, but still moist nonetheless.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used this to make strawberry shortcake (sugared strawberries and homemade vanilla whipped cream), which was a huge hit at my party!  The only problem I encountered was finding the batter a bit too much for my tube pan to handle.  It overflowed a little bit, but not much.  Thank you for the recipe, Connie! :)

I decreased the sugar to 2 1/2c. and added more coconut extract (1 1/2 tsp). The flavor of this cake was delicious....the only problem was that it was a little dry.....maybe because of the shredded coconut. I would give this cake 5+ stars if it was more moist. Otherwise the taste was all there. Will try again and maybe add some milk to the mix. Thanks!

Was looking for a cake to bake for my own Birthday. Found this recipe and it sounded so good, and since i had to bake my own cake figured i'd make the kind i wanted! This was a snap to put together, remember to stop using the mixer after the eggs are mixed in and do the rest by hand. It took a 1/2 hr longer to bake than stated in recipe but i didn't mind. It came out a beauty and it was sooo yummy!! I didn't have any coconut extract so i used Watkins caramel flavoring. Didn't need any frosting at all! Saved some calories there!! I'd make this again in a minute and probably will when the family gets done with this one. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This cake was very moist. I had to bake it for almost 2 hours. I think it might have been the pan I used. It was a bundt pan that was very heavy. Next time I will try a differnt pan. I will be baking it again.

I took the cake to Sunday school and they all loved it.  But the next time I make it I will add an extra teaspoon of coconut extract, because I prefer a stronger taste of coconut.  And I also had to bake my cake a little longer than the recipe called for.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Just made this recipe--a wonderful cake!  Dense and moist.  I was concerned that it would be too sweet, what with all the sugar as well as the sweetened coconut, but the sweetness was just right.  I may try it next time with a chocolate glaze (Satiny Chocolate Glaze--from this site) to see how that tastes. I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was perfect.  I had no problem with the baking time or with too much top browning.  Thanks for sharing it.

This is a fantastic pound cake.  The coconut made a wonderful addition.  My husband is a coconut lover and thinks this cake it out of this world.  Definitely will make this cake again

Fabulous and EASY pound cake.  Very very rich and moist so this cake will go a long way for a big crowd as you only need to slice thinly.  I will make this over and over again and will vary the flavor.  Needed to cook an extra 10 minutes with foil over the top though.  If you like pound cake, this is a definite recipe to try.

Delicious!   I made this cake last night for my husband's birthday...Not really, he gets a Carrot Cake for his birthday which is this weekend.  At any rate,  after browsing the reviews and reading the recipe, I could not resist making this cake!
Review and comments:
Great cake!  Richy moist, buttery,  really nice crumb, and very easy to make.  I made the following adjustment after reading the reviews.
  I added 1 stick of butter (1 1/2 cups). 
I used one teaspoon of both vanilla and almond extract (next time I will add 2 teaspoons, almond only). 
 Finally, I toasted then grind the Unsweetened Coconut Flakes before stirred the coconut into the cake. The baking time at 325 degrees - 1 hour 20 minutes. Perfections!

My family does not like pieces of coconut in things but we all like the taste of coconut so I toasted the coconut first and then put it in a small processor to make it into a powder, then I used it in the recipe!  They loved it!  Toasting it enhances the flavor!

made in a bunt pan.  needed to increase bake time to 1:45.  
first time I made I baked in small loaf pans (4) could have used one more pan.  
Next time Im going to try larger flaked coconut.  Gonna play around with this recipe.

Easy to make.  Changed recipe a bit - 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of sweetened coconut, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of coconut extract and vanilla pudding mix.  Cake  was a hit - definitely will make it again!

My cake came out hard on the outside and very dry. I really wanted to like this cake. It took forever for the knife to come out clean so it was probably overcooked. It was way to sweet for my liking. I read reviews after I baked it for tips on maybe adding less sugar and another stick of butter. However, I don’t think I’ll bake this one again.

If you love macaroons you should love this coconut pound cake.  Top it with strawberries, chocolate sauce or serve it plain, it is delicious.

I made half the recipe and it was very good. I  used 1 1/4 c of sugar, and I still think 1 cup would be enough. I toasted a bit of the coconut to enhance the coconut flavor. The golden bits inside looked pretty. I doubled the coconut flavor too, but  with the toasted coconut it could be fine to add less coconut flavoring. The cake  is dense but not too dry. It yielded about 12 cupcakes. If you bake in dark pans, beware that you might need to lower the temperature to 300F given that this cake benefits from slow baking. The sugar of the coconut will add to the batter plus it can cause over browning. Like others suggest use less sugar and beat the cream cheese and butter well and after adding the sugar. Make sure the sugar/butter mix catches enough air for a lightweight result. Will make this again.

I made this cake and added my own twist of pineapple juice.
Its a dense pound cake.  The flavor  is very good I also substituted the cream for sour cream which gave it a not so sweet to the taste.  I plan to make it again.

Very forgiving recipe! Read all the reviews and noted that for the most part it always turned out regardless of any small tweaks. My granddaughter had loved it the first time I made it and then told her whole preschool that her Nona was making coconut cake again for the 4th of July family gathering with strawberries on top!

I like the taste. I made it as the recipe says except I only used 2.5 cups of sugar. I used a Bundt pan to bake it.  I only baked it for an hour and 10 minutes, which was too long. The crust on the cake was very dark- not burned, but dark. That tells me too much sugar (as it was plenty sweet)and baked too long. I'll make it again with some additional adjustments.

I made this cake and even after following all directions to the letter it seems to be a little dry. Any suggestions would be great I thought about using 1/2 cup of Coconut to see if that would help. A delicious cake in spite of dryness.

This is probably on me but I used 1/2 cup of coconut sugar as a partial substitute for the generous amount of sugar called for in the recipe.  It rose beautifully, but was dry and I did not like the texture.  At this point I would not make it again.

I’m normally not a fan of changing the recipe as it’s written, at least for my first try. However, this recipe has so many good reviews, and so many of them recommended changes. So I followed my instincts and some of the tips. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, a teaspoon of salt and 4 tablespoons of coconut oil, and I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. I baked in a 4qt (10x15) rectangular baking dish for 65 minutes at the specified temperature. I wish I had taken it out 5-7 minutes sooner, but - this is a fabulous, basic recipe that you can tweak or customize to your taste and produce a wonderful, dense and flavorful pound cake.

I loved the coconut flavor, but the cake seemed a little dry.  served with fresh berries and whipped cream/lemon curd mixture.

I made this wonderful cake w/Cup4Cup flour so it was gluten free.  It was great.  It goes in the keeper file and next time I will reduce the sugar, add vanilla and try the 300 degree oven.  I might even try 3 sticks of butter!

This cake is amazing!  My husband wants me to make it once a week!  I did have trouble the first time as it was not done after the prescribed time.  I am making it again for a party and am going to try a 350 degree oven for 60 minutes and then adjust as necessary.

Followed directions exactly .
Even  read your article on butter cakes. Made sure all was at room temp. Beat  butter and cream cheese and sugar for 7 minutes. Thought cake was much too sweet. Sorry I didn’t read comments before. It also requires much more oven time than 1 hr. 20 minutes. I call it a “ton” cake not a pound cake.   Very disappointed. Intended to take to a friend but won’t

beautiful when i took it out of the oven, but dry and crumbly - not even close to consistency of a pound cake.  guess should have added extra butter or oil as other reviewers did...

Excellent cake-just be sure and watch it about the last 15 minutes.  In my oven, an hour and twenty minutes would have been  too long.

Moist and flavorful! I followed the recipe for the cake exactly and wouldn't change a thing, it tasted and smelled delicious, and stayed moist for a week while we ate it.  For the icing, I only used 1 cup of powdered sugar and it was just the right sweetness for us, so you can easily adjust for your liking.  My husband shared some with a coworker and he loved it too!

This turned out fantastic ! I followed one of the suggestions to cut back on the sugar and It was still sweet enough. It did end up being a little on the dry side so I think I would possibly add extra butter. But with all that said we topped ours with fresh strawberries as another reviewer had suggested and you could not ask for a better dessert ! I would be very confident to take this cake anywhere ! Thank you for sharing the recipe as it is a keeper!!

Definitely enjoyed this, brought to work & everyone raved about it. It would have been great served with strawberries, plan to do that next time. Decreased sugar to 2 & 1/2 cups. Baked in bundt pan for 10 minutes longer

Okay I'm going to echo most of the other reviews...
Dry, heavy, like a rock etc. etc. etc.  Followed the recipe per the letter.  After reading other reviewers and their attempts to invigorate  this recipe we're going to cut our losses and move on, not a keeper.

This cake is delicious.  I topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream...crazy good!  I also agree that the cake is a bit dry.  I’m not a baker so what can I do to make a more moist cake?  Maybe I should have made a bundt and a loaf bc I had too much batter for one cake.  I’ll add 1/2 tsp more of coconut extract.  I will definitely make this cake again and again!!!

This was one of the best cakes I've ever made. Everyone loved it. After reading others' reviews - I did make some personal tweaks. I only used 5 eggs because I was using a bundt pan & was afraid it may not be big enough. The bundt pan worked perfectly fine. Because some folks suggested adding more butter - I just added little canola oil - maybe 1/4 cup. Also, at others' suggestion - I added little milk - probably about 1/4 to 1/3 cup. Mine cooked about 1 hour & 10 minutes. Delicious! I will probably make for mother-in-law - for our Mother's Day gathering. Thanks for a great recipe, as well as for helpful reviews!

I used 2 cups sugar and  baked it for 1 hour 20 minutes.  Flavor is very good, but it’s a bit dry.  Will be good with coffee.  Not sure if I’ll make it again.

Taste delicious.  I substituted shredded coconut for flakes.  I added some coconut cream too by adding only three quarter of the required cream cheese, as I don't have coconut essence.  A small part of the cake is abit crumbly as I turned over the cake out of the pan.  Otherwise its nice and crunchy due the coconut shreds that I like.

changes:
1  &  1/2  t coconut  extract
1 t  vanilla
1 c mini chocolate chips

I made two batches and baked in 4 regular and 1 mini loaf pan.  Gave 4 loaves away and received many complements.  I liked the taste and texture - I used chips instead of a glaze or frosting .

OMG!! What a FANTASTIC cake! I followed the recipe exactly, except I DID copy a few of the other reviewers kind of with the coconut. I didn't have desiccated coconut, but I did have very finely chopped coconut on hand, and used that. Very happy that I made that one change. We didn't have that "chewy" coconut. Instead, the batter was just more smooth. You do still get the wonderful coconut flavoring! I'm SURE that I'll be making it over and over again! Especially once the rest of the family gets to try it! Thank you, thank you, thank you, for sharing this recipe!!

I was first taken with the title "Coconut Cream Pound Cake!" Yum!  Amazingly, I had everything on hand that the recipe called for; I had to make it - right ?  It  came out perfectly - yum!  As others suggested, I did add additional teaspoon of coconut flavoring and it was just right!  It was a hit with my family!  Thank you Connie for sharing!

Very tasty but a bit dry.  Otherwise I’d give it 5 stars.  The only change I made was to reduce sugar to 2 cups.  Baked it exactly as recipe instructions recommended.  Great with strawberries and or ice cream.  Will reduce time 5 minutes next time.

This cake is absolutely delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe called for using shredded, sweetened coconut. The batter was very light and fluffy - so much that I wasn’t sure if It was going to fit my bunt pan. But it did! At the hour and 20 minutes, my knife still had very slightly gooey cake batter on it, so I added another ten minutes to the bake time. As the “shell” of the cake is what crumbles (as others have said), I think I will take it out at the specified bake time the next time I make this. The reasoning behind this is I “cool” the cake for 10 minutes before I remove it from the pan. Wonder if this actually continues to “bake” (the pan is still very hot) during this time and did that extra time I baked it caused the crumbling? Hmmmm. Anyway, the hubby kept asking “how much longer” as he said the cake smelled fantastic (it did!), and as soon as I turned it out onto the cooling rack, he was there for his first slice.. And you know what? He was right not to wait! We both had a small slice  while it was “warm and naked” (no glaze) and it was moist on the inside and the flavor is outstanding! Yummmmm!  This one is definitely a keeper! BTW, I did glaze it with  the standard powdered sugar/milk/vanilla glaze it this morning.

This cake is fabulous! A moist, delicious, perfect recipe. I made no changes. I used organic unsweetened coconut that was finely chopped.  I began testing it at 1 hr becauce it was looking pretty brown on top. I'm at high altitude and find baked goods cook faster. I ended up baking it 1 hr and 25 min. It turned out beautifully and my family loved it. Thanks for the grear recipe!!

I made this cake yesterday,  I added an extra teaspoon of coconut extract. Followed the recipe  as it said. The cake itself taste great, but it came out dry. I was so sad, because I love coconut anything! I think it needs something else to make it moist.

This cake came out fluffy and moist. If you’re using sweetened coconut the sugar definitely needs to be reduced to approximately 2 cups. Will definitely try this again but will try to add a half block of cream cheese more to get more of that flavor.

This is an excellent coconut pound cake. I tasted the batter and was afraid it was going to taste too much like coconut extract, but that jump-up-and-slap-you coconut flavor mellowed with baking.  As with all pound cakes, this does require patience to let the butter, cream cheese, sugar and eggs get completely creamed together.  I folded in the flour and then coconut by hand so as not to toughen it up over-mixing in the machine. Mine took 1 hour 40 minutes.  I Crisco'd and floured my bundt pan and it released perfectly after a 10 minute rest out of the oven.

It turned out well and it is delicious.   I used a 12 inch loaf tin and baked for one hour and ten minutes. I also followed the suggestions in previous reviews and used 2 cups sugar instead of three.   I also added rum essence.   I think the next time I will use flaked coconut.   Thanks for the baking tips.

I give this recipe 5 stars because I think the problem was with me, not the recipe. The flavor is amazing. I cut the recipe in half and made a small loaf for hubby and I. I also reduced the sugar and ran the flaked coconut through the food processor as many others suggested. I was pleased with both the sweetness and size of the coconut pieces.  But my cake was a little dry. My batter was thick...the consistency was somewhere between a box cake and a soft dough. That was my first clue. I will definitely make this again, and will reduce the flour a smidge. Connie Bridges Mallard, thanks for the recipe. Any suggestions as to how to perfect it for me?

Great flavor, but not as moist as I would like it.  I made a pineapple glaze for a topping.  1/4 c powdered sugar, 1/4 cup of butter and 1 cup of crushed pineapple.  Melt together in a small saucepan and pour over the top of the cake when it comes out of the pan.

Not my favorite. The flavor was excellent but the cake itself seemed a little dry.  The outside seemed to get very tough/hard like it just didn't bake right between the amount of sugar and liquid. Mine had more of a dry bread like consistency instead of a dense pound cake.  Definitely got better with age which is unusual for a cake.

Couldn't keep it in the house.  Perfect without icing.  It is a big cake.  Would be a good picnic cake.  I will try adding another teaspoon of coconut extract next time.

My pound cake turned out extremely crunchy on top, very dense and a bit on the dry side. The flavor was good but the family didn't care for the texture.

I followed other suggestions by increasing butter, using cake flour, increasing extract and chopping coconut.  And in spite of these changes, this cake was dry, crumbly and bland.  I even added a glaze!! This was a waste of time and ingredients 
No, I will not make this cake again

This is a basic cream cheese pound cake with coconut folded in. My changes: Reduced coconut to about 1 1\2 cups and ground it in my mini chopper before adding. I don't like super sweet cakes so reduced sugar to 2 1\4 cups (which was perfect amount for us). I added 2 tsps coconut extract and 1 TSP each of vanilla and butter flavor extract. I added 1/2 cup milk ONLY to help spread in pans better. I baked in 'tall' 9 in pans for about 40 mins I think (messed up on timer) but could have removed 5 minutes earlier. Filled with pineapple filling (made with egg yolks). Frosted outer sides with cream cheese frosting. Ground more coconut in mini chopper and pressed into sides of cake cake. Pressed toasted coconut onto frosting on top for beautiful presentation. BIG HIT and RAVE REVIEWS! Less than 24 hours later only 1/4 of cake left. You can play around with the extracts according to your taste. Since I've been making pound cakes forever, trust me when I say you can make this recipe EXACTLY as printed and it will be good!

I didn’t have a tube pan so I made muffins instead. I lowered the sugar to two cups, added another teaspoon of coconut extract. I baked it for 30-35 minutes at 350 degrees. It turned out moist...thanks for sharing. Btw I used jumbo muffin cups and made 15 muffins....

I doubled extract like other reviewers. Flavor was good. However, I have a gas oven and used a Teflon bundt pan and after an hour and twenty minutes, it was already overbaked!  I will make this again, but will really watch the baking time.

I also followed other reviewers' suggestions and it turned out great! I baked it as a birthday cake, with three 6 in. rounds and lime buttercream frosting, and literally received compliments all night from people who couldn't believe it was homemade. As per others reviews, I doubled the amount of coconut extract, and reduced the sugar to 2 generous cups. When done, I also found it a bit dry, but that was solved with some coconut milk simple syrup which also upped the coconut flavor. The flavor was not too sweet, which was great for a grown-up birthday party. This recipe is definitely going into my tried and true recipe book!

i had to cover it with foil afer 50 minutes because i was worried the top would burn.  took an extra ten minutes before my knife showed doneness but i think somehow it was still overbaked.  a bit too dry and dense for my liking.

This was amazing.  Made it exactly as written.  Moist and very flavorful and lasted a week on the countertop, only because it's so rich, it's hard to eat more than one piece at a time!  Top with whipped cream and raspberries for an extra decadent dessert :)

I will certainly make this again.  I am glad that I used desiccated coconut because it cut cleaner, without the long strands.  I did bake it for 10 minutes longer; it developed a golden caramelized crust.  This tasted great as leftovers for a grab and go breakfast or snack.  Not too sweet and not overwhelmingly coconutty - just perfect!  Thank you for submitting this.

Wonderful pound cake! Just because I forgot to buy the cream cheese,  I substitute the. Geese with the same amount of sour cream. You get a rich cake but very moist! I served it with rhubarb and strawberry compote.

I made this cake this past Saturday for  the first time and everyone loved it, so much my husband asked me to make it again today, 3 days later! I added in 2 tsp of  coconut extract and make sure to follow the other instructions on beating the butter and cream cheese for 10 mins. I also add in 2 cups of shredded coconut. My husband likes it cooked till it's really brown on the top.

First time making a pound cake & was a bit nervous about making changes. I am cutting back on my sugar intake, so  I decided to use only half of the sugar  that the recipe called for.  Everyone loved it & felt that they could indulge without feeling guilty about all that sugar! I also added  1/2 cup of sour cream. Very moist, rich cake . Will make again!

I made this recipe using 2 of the Wilton mini fluted pans and it made 39 little pound cakes. I baked them at 3:25 for 25 minutes. They are so cute & yummy! Made a buttermilk cream cheese frosting to go with them.

If you love coconut this is a must-try. Moist and delicious, it's hard to beat and easy to fix. There are so many other possibilities that you can explore with this batter. (with or without coconut)
I Love It, 
Thx.

I love coconut and this was just the right recipe.   I read several recipes online before deciding to try this one.  That said...after reading comments/review from others, I decided to make a few changes.  I increased the butter to 3 sticks.  Dropped the sugar to 2 1/2 cups instead of 3 (don't like my pound cakes really sweet.  I felt the coconut would add a little sweetness)  Increased the coconut extract  by 1/2 tsp. and added 1 1/2 tsps. of vanilla extract.  Following one reviewer's suggestion...I processed the shredded coconut in a food processor.  That created a great texture.
All of my family and friends who like coconut loved it.  It is now a part of my dessert recipe collection and  I'll definitely make it again!

I used unsweetened flaked coconut for the batter. I baked it in a 13 x 9 pan As  suggested by someone else. I baked it for 40 minutes. It was a little bit dry. Next time I will set it for 32 min. 

I made the icing found with this recipe.  http://www.afarmgirlsdabbles.com/coconut-cupcakes-with-fluffy-coconut-buttercream-recipe/print/
It was very very good!   

I was thinking that drizzling some coconut Jack rum on the cake slices may be extra delicious. I'll try that another time!

Update: I added an additional stick of butter (total of 3), added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and used cake flour instead of all purpose. I thought the consistency was a little odd so will go back to all purpose flour next time. I kind of miss the chewy pieces of coconut so may also go back to regular coconut instead of the dessicated. Still baked in a bundt pan for 90 minutes but reduced the temp to 300 and the crust was perfect. The flavor of this cake is soooo good! Original review: When  I make this again, I will use an Angel Food cake pan instead of a bundt pan. I made the recipe exactly as instructed, but I started checking for doneness at 1 hour and kept resetting the timer every 10 min. The knife finally came out clean at 90 minutes, but I think it was overdone. The crust was very hard. The flavor of the cake was really good so I don't think I would change any of the ingredients. I will update my comments after changing pans and reducing the cook time.

Excellent cake but with the following changes:
I only used 5 eggs and no coconut extract but added 1/2 cup of cream of coconut instead.  Before I poured the batter in the pan, I sprinkled coconut in it.  I was hesitant to use 3 c of sugar but w/ previous pound cakes that I didn't add all the sugar, it wasn't sweet enough.  I did use sweetened coconut but the Great Value brand because Baker's coconut is too sweet for me.  I cooled the cake for 30 min in the pan and an hour out the pan. I made a glaze w/ the rest of the cream of coconut and sprinkled  some coconut on top.  This cake is very moist and not overly sweet as some coconut cakes.  I'll be making it again!

This cake is delicious  but I used unsweetened coconut and I think would have been better with sweetened coconut. I thought all coconut similar in taste but varies according to taste/brand used. I have made this particular cake several times and my guests liked it.

I made this for a local homeless shelter, so I only tasted the crumbs left behind in the bundt pan, but the crumbs were delicious!  I followed the directions as written and it baked up perfectly. Thanks for the great recipe - will be making again.

Lovely and delish describes this old-fashioned pound cake.  I have a similar recipe from a friend whose mother gave it to her in the early 60s.  It can be made with or without the coconut.  I made it using half Splenda and half sugar...it didn't alter the consistence or flavor of this delicious cake.   It is easy to make and always gets raves from whomever you serve it to.  Enjoy!

Was easy to make.  We have not tried it yet.  I made it for my Grandma's 90th birthday tomorrow.  I add 1 tsp kosher salt and 2 tsp coconut extract and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I also added a box of Jello instant coconut cream pudding too.  The cake took 1 hour 35 mins to cook for me.  I took the advice and creamed the fats for 5 minutes and then added the sugar and creamed it another 5 minutes then one egg at a time.  I also did not add the flour all at once I went 1 cup mixed on low until just moist then added another cup until it was all in then I slowly stirred in the coconut doing only what mixing that was needed.

This is an awesome cake, I get nothing but compliments on this cake! If you follow the recipe (bake-time) it is Not dry, but very moist! The only thing I do different is cut back to 2 cups of sugar because it is sweet- 
I also put a small amount of buttercreme icing on it because I make it for Birthdays but you really don't need icing. Highly recommended but again FOLLOW the recipe!

Excellent. Great with whipped cream and sweetened strawberries. I prefer to use the super finely shredded coconut that can be found in Asian and health food stores.

Only thing I changed is I used 2 cups sugar instead of 3 and it was plenty sweet. it did brown a lot and as it cooled the outer crust hardened (because it was baked at a lower heat for too long). I recommend baking at 175 celcius instead of 165, and just check the doneness with a toothpick after 1 hour. the flavor is amazing though! Also, beat the butter/cheese/sugar well until very fluffy to avoid dryness.

One of the best cakes I have ever made!! I used my Kitchenaid stand mixer. I let the cream cheese and  artisan butter come to room temp before mixing for about 3.5 minutes. I pulsed the coconut in the food processor with one TBSP of corn oil before adding. I increased the coconut extract by double and have done the recipe with 2-3 cups of coconut with great results. I bake it at 350 for the first hour and then reduce to 325 for another half hour or more. I have shared this with so many friends and they all rave about it!

I have not tried this recipe as yet.  A friend wants it for her tiered wedding cake.  19connie61 can you please give me an idea of the size pan you use in your wedding cakes and if you doubled or tripled the recipe.  Thank you so much this sounds so yummy!

SO... this is my favoritest cake EVA. I am currently on my 5th slice today.  I followed the recipe, except I added a 3rd stick of butter and baked it in 2 loaf pans, since I lost my bundt pan in the divorce (LOL). I have made it exactly as written however, and it always turns out great that way as well, I just added the extra butter this time around because, I don't know, I love butter, lol. This cake ALWAYS wins over people who aren't coconut fans too.  Great recipe if you want to impress coworkers, inlaws, neighbors, picky kids. And I have made several cakes in my day, and this one has ease of preparation too. Only drawback is that every time you walk past it in your kitchen you will want to cut yourself a slice...OUTSTANDING!

This makes a huge cake! I really liked the coconuttiness of the cake and the smell was wonderful. It was a little sweet for our taste, so I will cut back the sugar next time. Took 20 more minutes to bake than the indicated time. Served with fresh raspberries, which went well with the coconut. Thanks!

My first attempt at a pound cake and quite enjoyed it.  I found the reciped quite a lot of batter for a loaf type pan, and made sure I only filled the loaf pan 2/3 full (or you will end up baking for 2 hours and get a hard crust on outsides and barely cooked top middle).  I put the leftover batter into muffin cups (4) which only took 20 mins and they provided a few "take home" minis for my guest.  I also "dessicated" the shredded coconut from the store in my (cleaned out) coffee grinder.  I think that's necessary (food processor if you have one, but my coffee grinder worked great!) if you're going to use 2 cups or it would be awfully "chewy."  I used less sugar - about 1 1/2 cups - I think 2 cups would be about right.  Served with strawberry frozen yogurt which complemented it very nicely.

What a good coconut cake recipe. It is very rich and full of coconut flavor. The only problem I had was with the baking time. It ended up taking closer to one hour and 40 minutes or so, making me wonder if the temperature is correct (seems a bit low). Or maybe it is just my oven and I need to make some adjustments. At any rate, we really enjoyed this. Thanks!

Excellent cake!  I did not read previous reviews, wish I had because the cake is VERY sweet...but rich, delicious, and has a great dense texture.  Perfect with a cup of coffee!!

My family loved this recipe.  I forgot to turn the oven on and it sat in a warm oven for 60 minutes before I realized that it was not on.  But it still turned out wonderful.  Might serve with drizzled chocolate next time to spice it up.  There was not a bite left.

This recipe is AWESOME! Thanks. My husband hates coconut but he eats this like it's going out of style. Very moist, sweet but not overly sweet, and it's gone in one sitting! You'll love this.

This cake had good color and texture.  It was also very moist...but the coconut flavor was weak compared to other cakes I've made.

I thought this cake was very good, but I only had one complaint and that was the cake would not cut without crumbling.

I loved the taste of this cake.  Mine did come out a little dry - or maybe dense is a better descriptor.  I read and re-read the indredients to see if I had done something wrong and don't think I overcooked it.  Regardless, it was delicious and a must for the coconut lover... After his third piece, one guest said it was heavy, like eating a brick, but that if all bricks tasted like this he would eat a building...  I topped with Cool Whip and strawberries as some suggested and can't wait to make it again.

This was good, not great. The coconut flavor was subtle. With such a high price in fat/calories, I think I'll keep looking. Thanks.

This was good, but didn't turn out as moist as others had said.  Next time, I'll use a glaze - something with rum might be tasty.

I made this recipe as it is.  It is true that I had to let it cook about 15-20 min. longer as others stated.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone.  My family loved it!  Even my children!!

Wow, I can't believe how well this turned out.  Followed the recipe exact except added 2 tsps of coconut extract.  I thought it would be too sweet when I tasted the batter, but not at all after it baked. Thanks!

Good cake.  I sifted the flour before measuring and like a few other reviewers reduced the sugar and increased the extract.  I baked this at 350 degrees for 1 hr 10 min.  If you cut the cake with a serrated knife it will not crumble.

FANTASTIC!!!  didn't change a thing. we were having company for dinner so i made this in the morning for our dessert that night. everyone raved.  we ate as much as we could and had some leftover.  i was afraid to have it around (iknow i would have eaten the rest in one sitting) so the next day i sent it with my husband to take to his office.  he said that his staff devoured it by l0:00a.m. a sure keeper!!

This cake was a big hit at my home. The only thing I did differently was to put the coconut in the food processor to get a finer texture. Very moist and flavorful!
