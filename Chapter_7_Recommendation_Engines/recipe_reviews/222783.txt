Delicious! I left out the mushrooms and peppers to make it more kid-friendly. I sauteed the onion first, and added minced garlic, and garlic salt. Everyone liked it, I would definitely make it again!

I really loved these but I love the potential for variety even more!  I made my dough  using the same recipe that I use for pizza crust (there are some great options on allrecipes.com) and made 5 individual calzones  I left out the peppers on some and the cheese on one. I love that these can be personalized.  I diced up the pickles and omitted the sesame seeds because I didn't have any :) Tasted like a fantastic burger!

If you like store bought pizza dough, you'd rate this a 10 because it tastes exactly like a cheeseburger.  Next time we have this, I'll use homemade wheat pizza dough (we like the wheat rolls on burgers, too). Don't skimp on the pickles, they really make this recipe.  We are split on pickles on cheeseburgers, so I made half with and half without.  Hands down, the favorite was the one with pickles.

This was delicious, and tasted just like a cheeseburger! I did omit the jalapenos b/c of the kids, and I chopped my pickles. I made 1 big roll, instead of 2. The kids loved this, and so did the adults, lol...I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

not sure what I did wrong on this part, but this recipe ends up being kind of doughy. I recommend using a little less meat and vegetable product overall than this recipe calls for so that when you stuff the calzones they don't end up being kind of thin/fragile. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  Instead of making calzones, I decided to make it into a braid instead.  It was delicious, fun and fast.

Made this recipe last and was very good. Very good change of pace from a normal ricotta and ham calzone. The flavors were very good and definitely will be making this again.

This was pretty good, but crust is a little dry.  I added bacon to add to the flavor.  I'm not a big pickle lover, so I think I will exclude those next time or dice them, so they are not such a strong flavor

This was met with a split vote in my house. I personally did not like it. I feel that i followed everything to the letter with exception only to jalapenos (because of my children). Mustard was also strong. I mean No Disrespect to the original chef but i will probably not make this again.
