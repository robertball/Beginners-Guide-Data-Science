Very good.  I would make again but add cumin, chill pepper, lime juice and red onion.  I liked it but for me needed a bit more oomph!

This was great! I used some roasted garlic hummus so the flavors of the guacamole mix and the hummus played really well off of each other.

Quick and easy to make recipe! Great healthy snack to whip up during lunch time at work! Threw in some chopped tomatoes and cilantro for a little added freshness. Will make again for my next meal prep!

At first, I was a bit hesitant about this recipe. My family loves Guacamole and we also love Hummus...but putting them together?? It was amazing! Not only is it a simple recipe (3 ingredients) but it actually tastes really good! I'm definitely making this again!

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED THIS...two of my favorite dips combined, hummus and guacamole! I've never used a guacamole seasoning packet, but I really, really liked it and will use them more often. Served with pita chips...even my guacamole-hating hubby, liked this a lot. I will def be making this again and again~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

My local health food store sells an avocado hummus and I've been wanting to try it. Now that I have found this recipe I won't need to buy it! I love that I can control the taste and quality depending on the kind of hummus I choose to use. I added it a squeeze of fresh lime but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I liked the other reviewer's idea of adding a shallot! Consider this recipe great,  but also a nice base from which you can add to!

Great easy recipe!  The hummus adds to the guacamole flavor and takes it to a new level.  It keeps well in the refrigerator with plastic wrap placed on the surface!  I highly recommend trying!

This was really good, my first real experience with humus - was tasty. I added a small amount of finely chopped red pepper and shallot just for color and crunch, but on flavor alone, this is a keeper.
