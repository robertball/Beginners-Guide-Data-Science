I made a few modifications to the recipe, based on previous reviews, and it came out amazing!!!  I used low sodium soups, and cream of chicken instead of celery.  I love garlic so I used extra (1/4 of a cup), and I added italian seasoning and fresh mushrooms.  The chicken was extremely moist, even though I was worried about cooking it for so long.  I can't wait to make this for dinner again!  It was delicious and so easy!

This was delicious!!  So tender and the flavor was perfect.  However, I first seasoned it with poultry seasoning, garlic powder and pepper.  Then I did everything else exactly as stated except I used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic and shredded mozzarella instead of Sliced.  My family loved it!!  My husband who hates chicken even gave it a 4!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I made this for the first time tonight, and it was really good!  I only did four chicken breasts, because I knew 8 would have been too much.  I also substantially reduced the cooking time originally called for in the recipe.  I did 19 minutes on each side and then 10 minutes at the end with the cheese mixture, and even then, the chicken was a little on the dry side.  Next time, I will probably reduce the cooking time by a minute or two each way.  Still, the flavors were so good, and my husband can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Well liked at our house....only changes that I made were to add pepper and italian seasoning to chicken and I used cream of chicken instead of cr of celery because that is what I had. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was too salty. Next time I will use reduced sodium soups and it will be perfect!

Any recipe that my WHOLE family eats without complaint is a good one!  I did this in my crockpot (while at work).  I used chicken thighs and mixed everything but the cheeses and put it all in the crockpot on low.  About 1/2 hour before serving, I added the cheese.  Definitly a keeper! Thanks Jacque from the whole family!

One of the previous reviewers described this recipe as "family food."  That is 100% accurate.  There is nothing special going on with this recipe -- it is very basic. It tastes good, it's easy enough.  Easily a household staple.    I ended up adding minced garlic to the celery soup in step one (and omitted the garlic powder later).  Because I cut the chicken breasts the long-way, I reduced the cooking time by ten minutes in each cooking segment.  Next time, I may add broccoli cuts and switch the mushroom soup to cream of chicken.  Serve over rice (-brown rice works just fine).

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I was a little worried about the long cooking time, but the chicken was very moist and flavorful.  I used low sodium, low fat soups and substituted cream of chicken for the cream of celery because that's all I could find.  Served it over brown rice and it was a huge hit!

This chicken was good, I used leg quarters- it probably would have been better on breast/tenderloin because the sauce would have covered the chicken more, but it was still good on the leg quarters.

Very good for a low-fat meal.  Wonderful way to trick your family into eating well!  This recipe came out tasting really salty, so I recommend using low-sodium condensed soups if you can get them.

Delicious chicken! I used skinless thighs, rubbed them w/ garlic powder, oregano, and a pinch of salt. Only a pinch or none b/c those 2 soups are going to be salty. I also used shredded mozzarella and the dish was fantastic! BF LOVED it. Next time I will spray the pan first for easy clean up, also I will add lots mushrooms and maybe another vegetable also. :D

This was so yummy! I also seasoned my chicken first with garlic powder & cajun seasoning for our tastebuds & added diced zucchini. My guests really enjoyed it. The mozzarella really makes the dish. I would, however, reduce the cooking time. My chicken was little dry. Everyones oven is a little different. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

I wouldnt put in the 1/4 c of water. It was not a sauce.. it was so watered down. The chicken must have had a lot of water in it or the water added was too much. Made it as stated but put cheese on after it was done. Had a nice flavor and would try it again with out the water added. I used a small onion and put ontop the chicken in slices. Chicken was moist.

This was very very good! Not a meal I would make if I needed dinner in a hurry, but it was worth the time! The sauce was delicious, I might skip adding the water next time to thicken it up a little. I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and added about a tsp. of extra garlic powder in the soup mixture and to add more flavor and it was yummy! I covered the chicken with aluminum foil during baking to prevent it from drying out and my chicken turned out pretty moist! Thank you for this great recipe, will definitely be making again!

This was very good. I gave it 4 stars only because I added so many herbs that I think it would have been a little bland without them as some reviews have said. I used thighs which came out very moist and delicious. I rubbed them with oregano and garlic powder before baking. I used cream of chicken first stirring in some oregano, garlic and minced onion. I only needed to bake the thighs 30 minutes, turn and 30 minutes more before adding cream of mushroom soup mixed with garlic and basil. Turned out great and has me perplexed as to how anyone thinks the oregano in this recipe could be overpowering considering how much soup is used...that, in my opinion, keeps it quite creamy and 'gentle'.

I have to give the submitter...kudos. I followed the recipe to a T, but only used 4 8-ounce chicken breasts that were pre-seasoned with herbs. I thought it was slightly salty, but everyone in the family said it was spot on delish. The only thing I really did was saute the onions in a little broth. Because hubby and son don't like onions with a crunch, then added to the rest of the mix. Other then that the chicken was tender and the sauce was great. The added crispy cheese on top was a favorite. Thanks.

I gave this recipe 5 stars based on TASTE. The preparing and baking part was actually a bit of a hassle for me (I'm 15), but the frustration was definitely worth it. This was easily the best chicken I've ever had. I made some white rice on the side, and my family loved it. I'm definitely keeping this recipe.

I used the cream of chicken as others recommended and it still didnt turn out very tasty. I wouldnt make this again. The chicken didnt have much flavor, the only good part was the soup mixed with the cheese

My boyfriend adored this recipe, however I found it kind of boring. The amount of runny soup all over the chicken took away from the cheese and meat flavor. All I could taste was the soup. Will maybe use less next time.

This recipe was good, but kind of plain.  It does go well with mashed potatoes, noodles or rice because it makes a tasty gravy.

While not ordinarily a canned soup type meal fan, I whipped this together this evening because I had very little time to be in the kitchen. My husband and I both think this dish is outstanding and such a great base recipe to work with.   I didn't change much up, except to decrease the bake time, mainly because I butterflied the breasts for even cooking. Additionally, I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken and sliced mushrooms this time. Next time, and there definitely will be a next time, I'm sure we'll enjoy it as much just as written. Thanks for a wonderful time-saving meal idea!

Our biggest issue with this was the fact that the chicken was tough and dried out.  DH really liked the sauce.  My two boys (2 & 4) picked out the chicken and ate the rice and sauce.  I thought the dish was a bit too strong on the celery side.  I followed the directions exactly.  Maybe I messed something up and didn't realize it?  We might try something along the same lines, but I don't think I'll be making this exact recipe again.

I should've rated this recipe before, as I'll be making it for the third time tonight... I've always made it with low sodium/fat soups, and normally with a cream of chicken, instead of the celery... I also add veggies such as onions, peppers, zuccini at the start of the cooking, and it's very good... We love this recipe...Thanks for sharing it, as it's a fave in our house...

This was easy and I had all the ingredients already in my cupboard.  We all liked the dish.  I would use 1/2 can of mushroom soup next time - since I didn't serve it over pasta, I didn't need all the extra sauce.

We didn't care for the oregano.  If I make this again, I will omit that.  Provolone would be good on it too.

This is without a doubt the best baked chicken recipe I have ever used. The chicken is sooooo tender it is....AMAZING! I also add the parmesan to the mushroom soup and as the sauce cools it thickens nicely. Thick enough that noodles are not needed.

My boyfriend is the PICKIEST eater of all time and he liked it, except he thought the cheese was a little overwhelming. I thought it was perfect. I used thighs and seasoned them with Italian seasoning and a little garlic powder first.  I served it over fettuccine noodles that were tossed in garlic, butter and basil. I will make it again for us.  Great recipe. Thanks!

A whole family pleaser! My kids loved it. I used way more garlic & oregano. Cream of mushroom & chicken. This will go in the rotation. Thanks!

OK I gave this five stars because it is easy, I can make it ahead of time, and it is low fat. It is not a gourmet type item but very good for what it is - good family food. Mine looked nothing like the picture by the way. I used one of the low sodium/low fat soups and one regular soup. Added fresh sliced mushrooms, fresh broccoli, and more garlic, served with penne noodles. We thought it was good on a fall day - thanks! AND I usually do not like casseroles or such that are soup based!!

This was DELICIOUS!!! I even made some mistakes and it was fabulous still! I added too many dehydrated onions to begin with, then forgot the water, so poured a little on top of each breast after I had already put the soup mixture on them (before the cheese. Anyway, it was great! We just ate it over rice.

This was pretty tasty!  I used cream of chicken soup instead of the celery and served it over cajun rice with a side of beans.

This was great!!!  Very moist and the sauce was great over rice.  Didn't have an onion so I used onion powder and extra garlic.  Served it with rice and green beans!  So easy too! I think it makes a difference using cheese slices instead of shredded.  Great, Great recipe!  My family thanks you :)

Excellent and so easy.  I made half of the recipe and used only the celery soup.  Next time I will try it in the slow cooker.

I first made this for a church event - 2 trays. Both were completely wiped out INSTANTLY. I read through the reviews first and adopted some of the suggestions. I used cream of chicken soup instead of celery. Other than that I pretty much stuck to the original recipe. This is a GREAT recipe that gets raved reviews. I originally thought it was too salty so I placed it on a bed of rice before turning it over to the church servers. This one is a keeper.

This was extremely tasty and easy.  Next time I will modify the time, simply because who wants to wait that long for dinner.  I used two cans of cream of celery on the bottom and will probably use two cans of the cream of mushroom on the top (instead of one).  I used shredded mozzarella also, because that's what I had.  Worked perfectly and had the kids coming back for seconds!

I really liked this recipe, and using lower-fat versions of the soups and cheeses is a great idea. So many times I bake chicken breasts and they come out bland, but this recipe is a keeper!

Just made this...not sure what I did wrong, but it wasn't "exceptional" like others have rated it. :( I did use shredded cheese instead of slices...maybe sliced would have worked better? Who knows. Thanks for sharing!

The flavors in this dish were delicious, but the chicken was very dry.  I would recommend covering the chicken during cooking or reducing the cook-time.  When I grill chicken on my Foreman it is far more juicy than the chicken in this dish.  I'm considering grilling the chicken and preparing the sauce separately to spoon over the chicken as it is served.

Terrific dish!  I put legs and thighs (on sale for less than half the cost of breast!) in the crockpot on high for several hours with all the ingredients except the cheeses.  Then I took each piece out, peeled off the skin and placed in a 9x13, stirred up the soups and poured over the chicken.  Topped with the cheeses and baked for 20 minutes.  DH raved about it, and even asked what was in it and how I made it!  I'm glad we have some leftovers for a change!  Thanks Jacque!  *** UPDATE *** Still a 5 made exactly as the recipe is stated.  LOVE IT!!!

I used cream of chicken soup, mushroom soup with garlic in it, shredded mozzarella and parmesan, and seasoned my chicken with a bit of oregano, sage, garlic powder and catanne pepper. Will definately make again

I think the flavors of the dish are too strong - perhaps using one type of soup and doubling the sauce to use both in the beginning and end would do the trick. The chicken was very tender, however, and the mozz and parm cheeses tasted delicious toasted in the oven. I probably won't make this again, but I enjoyed trying it - thanks for sharing.

Absolutely wonderful!! The chicken was so juicy and so tender you could cut it with your fork. The flavors were great. Nothing overpowered anything else and it added just enough flavor as to not overpower the chicken as well. My husband, who doesn't care much for chicken, my grandmother, who only likes it fried, and myself, who doesn't care much for celery, all decided we have a new favorite! It's simple and quick to prepare, and turns out perfect. Great job and thank you for posting it!

My 5 yr old picky eater said he liked the chicken and suprisingly ate all that was on his plate.  I liked it too.  The chicken was very moist for being in the oven for long.  The only thing different I did was I added 3 garlic cloves intead of one.  I would've rated this 4 stars but my husband didn't think it was anything special.  I would make this dish again, especially since it was so easy.

I made this with chicken tenderloins directly from the freezer. I just layed them out to fill the bottom of the pan and followed the recipe from there. Served with steamed broccoli and mashed spuds. The husband and kids loved it and ate every bite.  Very easy to make and I will probably do it again.  Thank you!

Cheese and Sauce was delicious, I think the cooking time is a bit extreme. The recipe calls for an hour and a half total time. It was very dry chicken.

Delicious!  Took some liberties in that I added onion soup mix, but other than that was true to the recipe (well, maybe I added more garlic, didn't measure).  VERY easy and tasty recipe.  The sauce didn't even need thickening to spoon over the sliced meat and potatoes.  I think this would work very well as a slow cooker recipe.

I followed the recipe to the T but it was bland, needed some white wine, some bacon, something.  I do like that it has few ingredients but it could use a few more.  Capers?

The only change I made was I cut the ingredients in half since I only used 2 chicken breasts. It really is a great recipe!

My 14 month old and I really, really liked this recipe.  Based on the numerous comments about the amount of liquid at the end of the recipe, I opted to skip the step about adding water also and I'm glad I did.  I used thighs for this recipe as they were on sale this week and cream of chicken instead of celery because that's what I had on hand.  They turned out super yummy. I ended up fitting 10 thighs in the 9x13 pan. One really silly thing I did was didn't think to flip the thighs for the final 30 minutes of baking. Resulting in the cheese being on the bottom of the thighs vs the top.  Luckily, there's enough of the yumminess that I was able to make scoop out what I needed for each portion. I love this recipe because I usually have all of these ingredients on hand.  This is absolutely going in the rotation of meals.  Thank you for the recipe and all of the reviews.  The reviews help us beginning cooks figure out what we should and shouldn't do.

My husband and I both thought it made an odd flavor with the mixture of the cheeses and soups. (Almost like bleu cheese - which neither of us like.) There was a lot of extra soup/sauce for the amount of chicken we made also.

I used cream of broccoli instead of cream of celery and also left out the onions because of my kids but it came out pretty good. I would make this again.

I followed this recipe all the way and my entire family refused to eat it,including myself.I've never used cream of celery before,maybe that was what we didn't like,not sure.The chicken definitely was dry from being cooked so long.

I used 6 bonless chicken breasts and I reduced cooking time to 30 min, turn chicken cook another 20 added cheese/soup mix and cooked for approx. 15min. The chicken turned out great and it was not dry surprisingly. Next time I will use half of the second soup it was way too much soup even if I would of used eight breasts. I used shredded mozz. Overall pretty easy.

Very delicious!  I love garlic and cheese so my receipt included lots of both.  I also changed the original receipt to thighs (as thighs retain moisture), and cream of chicken soup. Also, in olive oil, I sauteed mushrooms, onion, minced garlic, and touch of oregano to mix into chicken soup. Baked as instructed.  Then I mixed the COM soup with the water, more garlic, about 1/4 tsp of both oregano and Italian seasoning (Since I added onion to the chicken soup, I omitted adding to the COM)... and of course lots of cheese on top!  The cream sauce goes well over rice. This was absolutely delicious !

WOW!!! Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  I followed this recipe exactly and it was WONDERFUL! I was very surprised at how easy it was to make it. I also made Linguine with Fresh Tomatoes (also on this site) as a side and it worked beautiful together!!

Great recipe, my husband and I loved it!  Made a few changes: cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, put way more garlic and oregano in, used boneless skinless chicken thighs and put everything but the cheese in right away.  Turned out great!

My entire family (5 kids, me, & dh) enjoyed this recipe.  I used 8 really large boneless/skinless chicken breasts and I doubled the sauce ingredients so I'd have plenty of sauce to go over noodles as a side dish.  I used Cream of Mushroom & Cream of Chicken because we don't really like Cream of Celery, and I omitted the water because I could tell there was a lot of liquid in my pan.
My chicken didn't really brown, but that's fine because it was super-tender.  This would make a really nice meal to bring to someone ill.

This was very good. The chicken stays quite moist. I used 2 cloves of garlic and it was just the right garlic flavor. We are not able to eat mushrooms of any kind, so I used Cream of Chicken soup and again, it was great! Will fix again and again.

This recipe made much more than I had intended. Good for large groups. Chicken was very moist and tender, though it was a pain to get the pan cleaned afterwards.

This recipe was GREAT! The chicken remained very tender and juicy even though it was in the oven so long! I added an extra garlic clove for more flavor. My entire family loved it, as well as a few guests we had over for dinner tonight. I served it over white rice. :) I will definitely make this again.
