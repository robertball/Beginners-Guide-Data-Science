This is a great cake IF the directions are followed exactly. First reviewer must not know how caramel syrup is made by "caramelizing" the sugar. 

Make this wonderful cake and you will enjoy a very special treat.

Where's the caramel? The recipe states to add sugar and water in a pan and cook it but doesn't say how much caramel....

This cake has become a family and friend favorite.  I am rarely able to make the caramel syrup easily, but I always have enough.  I also use it to make cupcakes (I get 24 cupcakes per recipe).

I baked this recipe for my family and they loved it the second time around I did not cook the sugar as long the color was more of a light brownl. But this time not only did I add the caramel to the batter but before it went into the oven I also sprinkled it over the top of the cake it turned out amazing.

I've make caramel - water just makes it sieze up most of the time.  Too hard for just 3 tbsp.  I used a different recipe for it.

I must have done something wrong because I did not care for this recipe. I was proud of myself when I made the caramel from scratch (never did this) but the end result was not moist but grainy and crumby. Not what I expected for Caramel cake. I did make is in one 13"x9" pan and used butter not shortening throughout. Oh well better luck next time?

I should have let the caramel cool a little bit longer before pouring it on top of the cake -- it likely would have set a little better since it becomes more viscous as it cools. I'm not a big fan of the cake because I *hate* the taste of butter, and it's all over the place with this cake.  The cake itself is pretty dense and not that exciting. Definitely not for dieters. (Sorry!) But definitely for butter lovers.

So kind of you to share this old, timeless recipe!  I followed to a tee, it came out perfectly & tastes incredible.  Yours in the picture looks frosted.  I poured the remaining caramel over the cake while still warm - yummy!

The cake itself was very good. I don't think I made the caramel right because it was more of a liquid than a syrup and it was VERY bitter. I added it to the cake batter and it was very good; but once the cake was baked, I couldn't taste the caramel.

This is a very good cake with a mild caramel flavour. Icing it with caramel icing helps. It is important to make this recipe exactly, especially the flour measurement and the sifting. This will help make the cake moist. Still good the next day. Very yummy.

I love this recipe ,,, made this cake for couple of time .....perfect recipe ....but gets dry very soon .. I think it's the flour it's a bet more. But any way , my all time fav recipe.
