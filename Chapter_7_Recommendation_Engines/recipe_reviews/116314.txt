I threw in a couple chopped green onions and I used Splenda brown sugar blend instead of regular granulated sugar. This is yummy.

I mixed all the ingredients, then added it to the broccoli in a glass covered dish and microwaved for about 5 minutes, stirring halfway. Keep the sugar - I think it makes a difference. My husband loved it and so did I. Thank you!

I have just about quit reading reviews until after I have made a meal, I feel it messes up my judgement. So, now I am gonna try to make it myself first and then see what others feel. My family loved this recipe and we will enjoy it often. Thanks.

I really enjoyed this dish. The only adjustment that I made was to reduce the sugar and the lime. I usually don't cook with sugar, so I thought that the recipe may be too sweet with the amount of sugar it called for.

I liked this, but then I tend to always like the combination of lemon, oil, soy sauce and garlic with vegetables.  In this case, there was a little too much of it, which we're forewarned about in the recipe when it directs to "serve with a slotted spoon."  So I only poured enough over the broccoli to dress it lightly, and left the pieces of garlic behind as I did.  As for the sugar, it's not something I generally use, but I find a little bit helps to mellow out the bitterness that broccoli can sometimes have - it doesn't contribute sweetness - if it does, you've added too much.

This was very, very good even without the sugar. I try to keep my sides as healthy as possible. I added black pepper and garlic and onion powders and more lemon than called for. My daughter said she could have made a meal out this. Thanks Domenick!

This is just the recipe I was looking for. I've been trying to replicate the garlic broccoli from one of my favorite Chinese restaurants for years, and this does it! No changes necessary - it's perfect, just as it is.

Ok. A little too sweet, and I would like it to have a more fluid texture to evenly coat the broccoli. So, less sugar, more water/sauce.

I loved the sauce, my kids did too!  It was easy to make a few adjustments to suit our taste.  I left out the vegetable oil and just used the sesame.  I will probably reduce that also the next time I make it.  I reduced the amount of garlic.  I sauteed the garlic and oil first, added the rest of the ingredients, added the broccoli and sauteed until crisp-tender.  I doubled the sauce to be able to serve it over some leftover chicken and rice.  This is also great with sugar snap peas!

This was better than the garlic broccoli from our favorite take out! I like to mix in some cashews. It's very rich and filling. I barely ate my main dish!

Delicious! I wasn't too sure with the way heating the ingredients (not including the broccoli)smelled but the taste was wonderful. My husband really liked it too. I took the suggestion of another and microwaved the broccoli with all of the ingredients (already mixed) for about 5 minutes - stirring half way through.  Easy and great!

I used Steamfresh broccoli, however much comes in the regular size bag, and did not re-size the recipe, and found the sauce amount to be perfect. I did let mine reduce a bit though by accident, but it clung nicely and did not pool in the bottom. I was pleased. Thanks for sharing!

Great way to eat your veggies! Only change was to double the red pepper flakes b/c we like the heat. Thanks for the recipe:)

This was good but I would leave out the red pepper flakes next time. Also I sauteed all the ingredients and then added the broccoli, and cooked it all together.

This recipe is fantastic!  I didn't change much except that I heated the sauce in the microwave instead of on the stove.  The sauce would probably be good with other veggies, too.

Not for us. Hubby took one bite and said, "It needs something." He then proceeded to jazz it up with spices from the cabinet. We won't be having this again.

I liked it but it seemed a bit too piquant for my 13 y/o daughter's friends for dinner at a sleepover.  I added a tsp. of toasted sesame seeds for garnish.

This was very similar to the broccoli that comes in many Japanese dishes at my fave restaurant. I mixed the sauce and poured it over my broccoli, then microwaved it for 5 mins. It was VERY tasty.

Turned out very well. I used peanut oil instead of the canola or vegetable oil. To me, it pairs better with the other ingredients.

Really, really good!  We all like broccoli in our family, but this recipe is nice when we want a change from the usual routine.  Very close to what we ate in China.

Steamed the broccoli in the microwave for 2-1/2 minutes on high, poured on the dressing, and then chilled until dinner.  Didn't change a thing, and wouldn't!  Very nice side dish.

Yummy! Both my husband and teenage son loved this.  I mixed the sesame oil (omitted the veg oil), red pepper flakes, soy sauce and garlic cloves and sauteed briefly.  Added the sugar, stirred until it was dissolved and then poured over the broccoli in a microwave container with lid.  Cooked for about 3-4 minutes and it was done.  I also added sliced almonds which added some crunch.  Great recipe - next time I will double the sauce since more was needed to go with the fish we had with the meal.

This should be called Asian Broccoli versus garlic. I thought it was too sweet. I should have completely omited the sugar. It would have tasted much better.

This was really good for broccoli!  I only used one clove of garlic, put everything in a glass measuring cup, covered it with plastic wrap, and microwaved it for 2 1/2 minutes.  Very good!

I made this using green beans instead of the broccoli and loved it.  It was super easy.  Loved the little bit of heat from the crushed red pepper flakes.  I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe, although a bit oily.  Next time I'll only use hot sesame oil, no veggie oil, and splenda instead of sugar.  The sauce would be great for almost any veggie combo.

Fabulous flavor!  I substituted Spelnda for the sugar, and put all the ingredients into one of those new vegetable steamer bags, and microwaved for about 4 minutes.  Delicious!

This was Soooooooo good.  My family does not like hot in their food so I put in just a pinch of the red pepper, otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter.  This will be a regular at our dinner table.

The first time we made this, we followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing we did different the next time we made it  was to add a little corn starch to the soy sauce mixture and it thickened up beautifully.  This recipe is amazing and I think the sauce would also make a great marinade for pork or chicken.

This is great!!  Try it with Baby Bok Choy.  Add fresh minced ginger to the garlic and red pepper flakes.  Saute breifly and add bok choy to the pan with 2 tbsp of water.  Cover for a few minutes and toss in the other ingredients. Stir until combined.  Yum!!!

Loved it.Made it with the Baked Soy Lemon Pork Chops on this site. Then I made as a dish to go along with our takeout chinese food. Next time I want to add some marinated steak to it for our own beef and broccoli.

what a great recipe! like several others, i have adjusted it to my taste and health consciousness. Eliminated sugar of course. Not only is sugar bad for everyone, broccoli simply doesn't need it at all! And use extra virgin olive oil which is healthier than other choices... and lots of garlic.. i used two whole bulbs, and sauteeed them first. delicious.

SO YUMMY! You wont be dissapointed, some users have reviewed this recipe as too sweet? or too much sauce.. maybe you just need more veggies! I make this all time its also good with broccoli/carrots..  I have been using 1 tbsp. of honey instead of the sugar, i'm not sure if it is exactly "healthier" but it makes me feel better haha

This was awewsome! Great and easy way to add some flavor to your broccoli. I only made one change, I steamed me broccoli in the microwave instead of cooking on the stove top. Will make again, thanks for sharing!

I thought it was very good. I cooked the broccoli, then put all the ingredients except sesame oil (cuz i didnt have any) in a container and the broccoli and shook it up. I think shaking it up made it a little mushy but it still tasted great, and I didnt think it was to sweet at all. But if you dont like soy sauce you might not like it.

I nixed the red pepper flakes as kids would be eating it.  I also substituted the stevia for the sugar.  I doubled the recipe and used a tiny bit of cornstarch to thicken it up.  Mixed the broccoli with brown rice and the sauce and it was very, very nice!  Next time I will try olive oil instead of veggie oil for flavoring.  Thanks!

Great proportions of sauce to broccoli.  1.5 cups is about a third of a pound of broccoli.  What I did differently was to decrease the amount of water (adding as necessary as it was cooking), bring to boil, add broccoli, cook 5 minutes, add garlic and cook for 1 minute, and added the mixture of the seasonings (although I replaced the sugar and lemon juice with about a teaspoon of Chinese black vinegar).  It was really good!

After reading several reviews about omitting the sugar I desided to leave it out and the lemon juice and got  fantastic flavor with fewer ingedients.  Made this dish a second time just the way it was submitted without omitting anything and found no substantial differance in flavor.  It was great either way!

This was awesome although I didn't follow the instructions completely. First, I used the broccoli in the bag (broccoli wokly)and microwaved according to instructions on the bag, roasted some garlic in the oven, then mixed the minced garlic with the rest of the ingredients.  Also, I added a splash of balsalmic vinegar.   I threw it all together and had a side dish in under 5 minutes!!   This really tasted great and was low-fat to boot.  Thanks Domenick

We really enjoyed this.  I had no sesame oil, so I used all peanut oil, but followed the rest of the recipe.  I served it over whole grain spaghetti and garnished each serving with toasted sesame seeds.  Great recipe which can be adapted for a number of different meals.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent!!  My bf really enjoyed it even though I screwed up and put twice the amount of sesame seed oil and compensated with using half the amount of soy sauce.

The sauce was outstanding and so flavorful!  The red pepper flakes gives this dish the kind of spice that is slightly delayed.  It's a pleasant surprise.  I used a combination of broccoli and califlower and this sidedish is a keeper!

Easy and a nice way to serve broccoli.  Reminds me of the way the Chinese restaurants serve it - yum!  No changes needed to this recipe.  Update: I accidentally used olive oil in place of the sesame oil and it only makes a slight flavor change - still really yummy!

Love this recipe!  It's so easy and packed full of flavor.  I do steam my broccoli in the microwave in a steaming bag, but that's the only thing I do differently.

I halved both the sugar and the red pepper, and this turned out great. It would be a good side-dish for an Asian themed meal.

I've never written a review before, but felt this one was very worthy. My whole family loved it! What a great way to spice up boring broccoli, and it really does taste as good (if not better) than the stuff you'd order at your favorite chinese restaurant. Tonight I'm making it again, but doubling or tripling the recipe and adding beef to it. Try the author's recipe first, before making changes based on other reviews. This needs no altering....Thnks!

This was a great asian flavored dish. My son loved the sauce and had some as dipping sauce for his chicken. I liked the tangyness the lemon gave this. Nice dish, I don't think my husband was impressed though, it just wasn't his style, he'd rather have cheese.

I usually eat my broccoli plain or with a little mayonnaise.  I know, it sounds weird  which is what I thought when I first saw my husband eat it that way but it is surprisingly good. This recipe is a nice change.  I omitted the pepper flakes since I don't like spicy foods (yeah, my loss) and I didn't have any lemons but it was still very flavorful.

Very easy to make and delicious!  I made this with the Onion Crusted Catfish also found on Allrecipes.com (thanks to TUNISIANSWIFE who recommended both), and they were a fantastic pair!  This broccoli recipe is so simple that I will be making it again this week!

It was too much oil and too much soy sauce because the broccoli was soaked in this stuff.  It was too strong of a soy sauce taste too.  I won't be making this again.

I made this for a girls night, teaching one of my friends. We all thought this was quick and easy and tasted like you actually spent a lot of time cooking it. Should have read the whole serve with a slotted spoon, b/c there was quite a bit of liquid.

This is great! But it didn't work at first for me, when i put the garlic in it burned. So I started over with garlic and pepper flakes in the vegetable oil. then once those were hot and fragrant, i add the soy sauce and sugar( oh i also added about a tbl spoon of chicken broth). After that was combined, I took it off the heat and then added the lemon juice and sesame oil. If you cook either of these long they lose their flavor! I loved this, and it had a great sesame taste! Will make again! (my way... :D)

Really wonderful recipe for broccoli that will go in my weeknight recipe pile. I was disappointed that the original recipe didn't call for one bunch of broccoli, but instead 1.5 cups, so I had to alter it because I didn't want to throw out or save the remainder of the bunch.

At the suggestion of some other reviewers I reduced the sugar by 1/3 when I made this tonight.  This sauce is one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted, and I will absolutely be making it again, and often.  Because my fiance hates broccoli, I will try it on other things, too.

This was pretty tasty but I prefer a bit more sauce so I adjusted the broccoli/sauce ratios. :)

Delicious! Great way to spice up steamed broccoli. Made as directed and both my husband and I loved it. It's a keeper and I will make again.

Loved it!  This sauce is very verstile, I think it would have been good over baked fish or as a stir fry too.  Hubby said it reminded him of something he would get at his favorite Asian restaurant, PF Changs.

This was very good. The sauce is thin, but over rice it would be very good. The flavors are really great- I do think that the seasame oil does add a lot to it.

Love this broccoli! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and even though i forgot to add the lemon juice (what can i say, I was multi tasking) it was fantastic. Love the bite that the red pepper gives. Will most definately make again.

This was really easy to make, but the sauce was lacking.  Maybe if the sauce was thicker it would concentrate the flavors more.

Simple, yet delicious. Not too much flavor, but just enough! I almost burnt the sauce... I forgot to turn down the heat. Haha, but it was still perfect. I didn't have lemon juice, so I used lime. It was fine.

This was good.  I had a small amount of broccoli and cauliflower to use up and tried this recipe.  It spiced it up a bit.  I did only use a pinch of sugar.

This got rave reviews from my family.  I did not have any sesame oil so I used Macadamia Nut oil and a little extra lemon.  Otherwise, followed the recipe to a "T".  Thanks.

A great and easy way to spruce up broccoli.  We eat broccoli several times a week with dinner so I'm always looking for new ways to serve it.  I love the little kick from the crushed red pepper.

It might sound crazy, but I added about a teaspoon of peanut butter to this, and it was fabulous!! It's just as good without the PB, but to add a little bit of creamy/smoky flavor, just a dollap will do.

i make this atleast once a week with dinner.. it's absolutely fabulous! I have found that if you don't have any fresh broccoli on hand, the frozen stuff will work great, too! I had a bag of the frozen cauliflower and broccoli and it was yummy!

I wanted to try something different.  This was really tasty and had a lot of flavor.  My husband can't take really spicy food so next time I'll cut back on the red pepper flakes.  However, everyone else loved it.  Served it with salmon marinated in honey soy and a rice pilaf.  Great dinner!
