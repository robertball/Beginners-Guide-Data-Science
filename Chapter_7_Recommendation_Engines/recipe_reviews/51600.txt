Chocolate Heaven - I just couldn't think of two better words to describe these cookies! They're so chocolately and so chewy that it's almost like cookie meets decadent fudge brownie. These cookies stay soft for days  - that is if they last that long! I made a few batches for my husband to take to work and people went nuts over these. This recipe is perfect so if you're new to making cookies follow this recipe exactly and you'll come out with perfect cookies that taste incredible. Be sure to have plenty of milk on hand 'cause your gonna need it for these chocolate treats!

I don't think it is much of a surprise that a recipe from Nestle is five stars, but my husband was sure excited to have them and has already asked for them again.  They are best when still warm and gooey, but I was surprised to find that even this morning they are still soft.  Most cookie recipes will harden over night.  I followed the recipe exactly and would not recommend any changes.  If you have a choco-holic in your house, this is the recipe for you!

Awesome recipe! It took longer than 10-11 min, more like 15. When the cookies start "cracking" on top (as in visible lines) then you know they're done. Yummy!

Edit: I made these cookies again a couple days after the first batch. I realized I forgot the baking soda in the first batch! (above) The major difference is that the first batch was very dense- but soo gourmet! But the second batch (with b.soda) was lighter and spread like a traditional cookie.
I think next time I'll leave out the soda!

These are great! I make them with chunks of white chocolate and they look fantastic. You may need to flatten them a bit before putting them in the oven otherwise they may be too puffy.

Like most of us, I don’t eat cookies much because I’m trying to watch my girlish figure.  But HUBS likes to have a cookie now and then, something he usually likes to hunt for and grab from the freezer.  In the interest of maintaining that girlish figure I had every intention of trying just a sample of these cookies – strictly for rating and reviewing purposes of course.  But a bite of the cookie (pretty darned good) led to finishing off the cookie (so chocolatey and gooey and rich) and by that time I admitted my weakness and surrendered to another, which I scarfed down nearly as fast as it took me to take my next breath.  I challenge any of you to be any stronger when it comes to these cookies.

These cookies are idiot-proof.  They rise nicely, taste great, and look like something from Mrs. Fields.

Very delicious! You have to be a chocolate lover to like this cookie, though! I recommend baking these cookies for about 7 or 8 minutes...this way they come out very gooey! I will definitely make these again!

These were AWESOME! I was looking  for a chocolate cookie that didn't require melting chocolate due to the time required. My dad, friend and boyfriend all loved them. I used about 3/4 cup of semisweet chips along with 1 cup of white chips for some variation. I also tripled the vanilla as I do with all of my cookies so I used a bit more than 1 tablespoon instead of 1 teaspoon. I also used egg whites in a carton as opposed to whole eggs to cut a bit of the fat. The cookies are soft and SO chocolatey! After reading other reviews I decided to press down the cookies before popping them in to the oven and I'm glad I did since they didn't spread out very much. Thanks for the awesome recipe! They remind me of the cookies at Tim Horton's!!

I made this with a mixture of white chocolate chips, heath pieces, and mini chocolate chips. DELICIOUS! If you have an oven proof small skillet (cast iron, non-stick or other), fill the entire bottom of the skillet (about 1/2" thick) with the cookie mixture - bake at 350 for 10 min or so, depending on the size of your pan. Take it out of the oven, leave the cookie in the pan, and serve the cookie hot with vanilla ice cream on top with spoons - for everyone to share. (Good with any cookie recipe). Use the remainder of the dough for regular sized cookies.

Phenominal with Guittard brand semi-sweet chocolate chips (they're sold in copper-colored bags; easy to spot).  Great, easy recipe to begin with, and the extra-special chips give a depth of chocolate flavor almost like a dark chocolate but without the bitterness.  Watch out thighs, here they come!

Really liked these. The only thing I changed was to also add a cup of white chocolate chips. I dropped the cookie dough by scoops on a cookie sheet and froze it. We just baked these for 12 minutes and they were great - couldn't even tell the dough had been frozen! Will definitely make these again.

The only change I made was use less salt, 1/2tsp would have been way too much! I used the semi-sweet chunks - went perfectly! Also tried white chocolate & peanut butter chips. The chunks were the favorite taste-wise, but the others added to the appearance. Might try later with Andes mint chips. Oh, I also followed advice to squish the dough down a little before baking - good tip. Thanks for the recipe - definitely a keeper!

Used Hershey's special dark cocoa powder and cherry cordial M&Ms.  So good!  Everyone ate them up before I could stash any for myself.

These cookies are excellent. What makes them even better is if you use hershey's special dark cocoa instead of regular and also add a packet of chocolate fudge jello pudding mix in with the dry ingredients. I also only baked them for 8 minutes so they would come out a little more moist and fudgy. Heavenly

A great cookie!  Made them with mint chocolate chips mixed with regular chocolate chips and they were a hit.  Next time I'm going to try using mint extract.

I have tried so many double chocolate cookie recipes and this one is a keeper! SO easy and with ingredients that we always have on hand. I used semi sweet choc chips instead of chunks. I think these would also be great to add in white chocolate chips if you like.

Great recipe.  I added a cup of chopped walnuts to mine to kind of break up all the chocolate. 
I froze some of the dough but not for long.  These were really really good.

These were great cookies... especially when they were still warm. My only issue with them is that they didn't stay fresh long. By the second day they weren't very flavorful.

I cut this recipe in half and I used extra-dark chocolate chips. I made no other substitutions or changes. It's your average double chocolate cookie. I liked that I didn't have to chill the dough and my husband said that they taste like brownies. Next time, I'd like to try white chocolate or peanut butter chips.

Great cookies, very very rich.  Instead of store-bought chocolate chunks, I break up nice chocolate bars into chunks, combining milk and dark chocolate.  You could also add white chocolate, if you'd like.  Very decadent.

Awesome!  Perfect cookie.  That's how my husband describes them.  I am making cookies for co workers and this is one of them. I had a few stragglers that didn't make the tin.  If they are as happy with them as my husband, they should be a big hit!!

I make these all the time.  Everybody loves them.  Been asked several times for the recipe.  The only things I changed: using white chocolate chips & semi-sweet chunks, add half a package of dry vanilla pudding mix to make them a little more gooey.

Delicious! I went a little heavy on the cocoa powder and therefore put only a cup and a half of flour. Used one stick of butter (for the taste) and one stick of margarine (for the consistency). Also left out the baking soda. I used the Nestle semi-sweet chocolate chunks but also added in white chocolate chips. Very fudgy and yummy! Would absolutely make again!

I love that these cookies didn't spread out and get hard. My almost-11 year old actually made them all by herself, and they turned out perfectly. Great recipe!

These are good, but anything made with 1 cup of butter should taste good.
I had an issue with the cookies not flattening out so well.  I think my baking soda was old, that is my only thought.  Otherwise they tasted good and the recipe makes a lot of them.

I always read the comments before trying a recipe because A.) I'm not pastry chef and don't know how to spot a bad recipe and B.) I like to see how people did/what tips they have. Although the responses on this recipe were all over the place, I tried it anyway. Things to note: the cookies don't spread out a ton, so do pat them down a bit (mine resembled hockey pucks.) Also, make sure you add all the chocolate chips- I think they lend moisture to what would otherwise be a dry dough. I also added walnuts to mine (about  a 3/4 c chopped) and they turned out amazing. I disagree with those who said these cookies are "too chocolatey". They're not. Bake time was right on too.  I give it two thumbs up ;)

These cookies turn out so wonderful!  I did go ahead and use the whole bag (2c) of chunks.  Start with 11min for the first batch since your pans are cool.  I also recommend keeping the dough in the fridge between batches.  For subsequent batches start with an 8 min timer since your pans are hot.

Next time I think the next time I make these I will add 3T brewed coffee.  We always have a little left in the pot.

I had my 12-year-old brother make these, and it was a disaster. I have no idea what he did, but it was completely powder. At first I was a little upset, but then I decided to retry myself and it was perfect. I added marshmallows to one batch. Also, instead of making them small, I made them about 2-3 tablespoons per cookie.

These are the best cookies I've ever made.  My mom was just over and blew her low-carb diet with them!  Sorry ma. The recipe is perfect and needs no changes, however, it made 70+ cookies when the batter was "tablespoon sized".  I'd probably make bigger ones next time to save some time in the kitchen.  8 minutes for super soft gooey cookies and 10 for sturdy ones.

My 4 year old son and I made these for a BBQ. They were a HUGE hit! My husband loves these, and my son who usually doesn't love sweets couldn't stop talking about them. They're very rich and dense but still airy. We used real butter and white chocolate that I chipped into chunks from a slab, with about 1/2 cup milk chocolate and they are really wonderful. I will definitely make these again, thank you!

these tasted like those pepperidge farm sausalito cookies. they didnt do much for me. i even used ghirardelli chunks (the chunks were awesome when they first came out of the oven.. like little melty chocolate surprises with each bite). a lot of reviewers mentioned these stayed soft even the next day, that's cool - but in this case, i think these would taste better crisp. over all, not bad but def not repeating this recipe without some changes. (also, my cookies were on the flat side. hypothetical next time, i'll prob throw the dough in the fridge)

Amazing and easy - these are really rich and chocolatey and taste like cookies from Specialties.  Came out perfect after 11 minutes. For 1/2 the batch I added dried cranberries and topped with a pecan - both ways were delicious!

Excellent! These have a great chewy texture, just how I like my cookies. The only thing I changed was to double the vanilla and topped with M&Ms before baking, just to add a little touch of color. Thanks! :)

I made these for superbowl sunday at the request of my husband and they were perfect.  I did squish them down a bit as suggested by another reviewer and its true they don't spread well but the taste is perfectly chocolaty.  These were gone in no time!

Just follow the recipe and put them in the oven.  Just don't refrigerate the dough and try to cook it later, because it just does not come out the same.

These cookies were great and easy.  Instead of "chocolate chunks" I used one of those big Hersheys bars you can get at the grocery store or pretty much anywhere that had almonds in it and chopped that into little bits.  It made the cookies have gooey chocolatey spots, yum!

I used 1 cup white chocolate chips and 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips instead of the chocolate chunks. They were delicious!!! Some people who tried them said the texture was more like brownies - I like to cover them before they're completely cool so they stay chewy.

Bang!  Double the chocolate, Double the fun.  This recipe is great.  Did not change a thing.  They came out great.  I can not tell you if they are still soft the next day, because we had NO leftovers.

This was a good recipe. I made a few changes to make them extra chewy: I melted my butter instead of just using softened butter. I also added about a tsp. of milk and a tsp. of water to the batter just to wet the batter a bit.

I thought the cookies were a little dry.  Maybe one of the other reviews will give me an idea of how to make them a little more moist.

These just came out if the oven. They're delicious, but what made them even better was the flaked coconut I added to the last two batches. Very soft, lots of chocolate, and easy to make. I will definitely make again.

I've shared this recipe with so many friends... Everyone loves it. I've tried these cookies with and without baking soda and either way, they're delicious!! I've found that with my oven, they're always perfectly done at 10 minutes. They are softly baked on the outside and gooey on the inside... yum!!! Like all cookies, make sure your butter is completely softened or the texture will be off. After they've cooled a little, sprinkle them with a little confectioners sugar and they are as beautiful as they are delicious!

Amazing! They puff up really nicely while baking so they are soft in the center with a slightly crispy outside. I decreased the cocoa to 1/2 cup but kept everything else the same.

These cookies were pretty good. Everyone seemed to like them. However, they were a bit thick. I added an entire bag of semi sweet chocolate chips and think they could have used more because they tasted better when you hit those chocolate bites. I will definitely make these again. Be sure to have a glass of milk handy when you eat these.

The batter for the cookies turned out really soupy. When I baked the cookies, they turned out hard and crunchy even though I baked them for the right amount of time. I wouldn't recommend these.

Wonderful! I added about 1/2 cup extra flour due to my high elevation, and they are perfect--they look lovely, taste wonderful, and have such a great, rich chocolate flavor. Will definitely make again!

Delicious! I cut down the flour by around a 1/4 cup to make them less dense and also baked them at 10 minutes like many others. Fantastic results! Plump and soft. I will definitely be making these again.

You really have to like a rich cookie to like these.  I used regular semi-sweet Nestle chocolate chips (not chunks) as that's what I had on hand.  The one thing I would change is to add nuts...they need that texture and flavor to break up the richness of this cookie.  I think I would then rate them with 5 stars.

These are amazing! We used the chocolate chips instead of the chunks and baked them for 11 minutes. They would be great with the mint chocolate chips or even the white chocolate chips too.

This is one of THE BEST cookie recipes I have come across! They are so chocolatey and MOIST and they just melt in your mouth. I could drool just thinking about them...As other reviewers have said, the cookies don't spread very much while cooking in the oven. So if you want them to be larger and not so high then I would suggest pressing them down just a little, instead of leaving them rounded. Another little change I made was cutting the baking soda down from 1 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon. The cookies still rose enough, and they came out so moist and almost like a fudge brownie! YUM! Thank you for this awesome recipe!

This is the easiest and most delicious recipe ever.  It's fool-proof. I bake 11-13 minutes until they crack.  Store in an air tight container, they will stay chewy for days.

This is a great "turns out perfect every time" recipe that people who love chocolate will love. My husband loves chocolate and we enjoyed these with a nice glass of red wine. If you don't like red wine, I'd suggest having a tall glass of cold milk nearby, you will want it!

These cookies are awesomee. My daughter who is 9 and her friend and I baked these. We did add 3/4cup of white chocolate chips, semi sweet chips and chucks., They came out fantastic. I would definitely recommend this for the person who is a chocoholic.!

These were easy, fast, and delicious! They make a great birthday present. My father, a self-proclaimed chocoholic, has been eating chocolate cookies for 50 years and he said these were the best chocolate cookies he has ever had. Yum!

VERY YUMMY! SO chocolatey and fluffy. If you like chocolate you will love these cookies! The dough is very thick, so when you pour in the last bit of the flour mixture i would reccomend mixing by hand if your elecrtonic beaters aren't strong, mine almost broke! CAUTION: Extremely addictive (AKA once you have one you need another!)

Just out of the oven, they are excellent, we used white chocolate chips (another brand) because we didn't have the Nestle, but they turned out great.  I am not a baker, and this is probably only about the 4th time I've ever attempted, but these may inspire me to do more.

These are absolutley the best double chocolate cookies i have ever made...i used the chocolate/peanut butter mix chips instead of just chocolate...You will have to cook them a little longer, about 15 min. But i also make big cookies!
Fabulous fabulous fabulous!

Delicious cookies!  Like many, I tweaked the recipe, which I halved, to my taste.  I used Earth Balance Soy Garden buttery spread instead of butter and added chopped dried cherries. They were perfectly baked in 9 minutes. I had no problems with the dough not spreading - my cookies spread just fine.  Maybe it was the Earth Balance instead of butter or the flour I used that contributed to the spread?? I also used Ghirardelli chocolate chips and cocoa instead of Nestle's.  I have found that whenever I use Gold Medal Unbleached AP flour, that I have more spread in my cookies than when I use King Arthur unbleached AP flour.  Didn't have any KA so used the GM this time.  Any way, the cookies are soft, chewy, and chocolately, just the way I like them.  Love how the dried cherries complement the chocolate. YUM!! It's hard eating just one!

I made this recipe as directed but substituted chocolate chunks with half white chocolate chips and half milk chocolate chips.  I was disapointed by the taste and flavor of these cookies.  For how much chocolate I had in them they were very bland.

These were really delicious once I got the cooking time right. I like my cookies a little larger and 9 minutes was the perfect amount of time to make them soft and chewy.  So, if you go by the recipe, 9 min. is probably too long. I overbaked my first batch and they were dry.

I made these with my 12 year old daughter. We are both big chocolate fans and this one fit the bill! They were amazing! You must not overbake them. The bake time will depend on the size of your cookies. Like the recipe says, 9-11 minutes. Great dipped in milk.

These are AMAZING. Perfect cookie recipe. I didnt have enough chocolate chunks so i subsituted butterscotch chips and they still tasted amazing! i also only baked them for about 7 minutes because i like my cookies really soft :) thanks for the amazing recipe ;)

I LOVE this recipe!  I make the cookies exactly as directed only I add 1C of flaked coconut.  (I definately flatten)I bake at 325 for 11 minutes.  When cookies are cooled, I spread the top w/ caramel ice cream topping then dip them into toasted coconut!  I can't even tell you how many dozens of these I've sent to the soldiers oversees!

Not bad, but a bit dry.  I'll stick with the other recipe I have like this.

These cookies are great.  Not extraordinary though.  Perhaps I have been spoilt by all the other great cookies on this website...

Not exactly sure what happened here but we didn't care for these. I think they were definitely overbaked so watch the time closely.

These were very good, I used white chocolate chips. Mine didnt flatten much when baking so I wound up flattening them before putting in the oven.

this tasted fabulous. extremely chocolatey. but they turned out so flat! after the 1st batch, i refrigerated the dough in hope that the next batch wouldn't flatten out so much but to no avail. they didn't look good enough to give away so I crushed them up to make a yummy cookie crust for a cheesecake. everyone loved the crust. just wish the cookie could turn out pretty.

I chose to make this recipe because of it's high ratings. The cookies are okay but definately not spectacular. I love the original Toll House chocolate chip cookie recipe so I thought this would be equally as good. They are definately edible but I will look for another double chocolate chip cookie recipe next time.

Made these several times now, raves everytime. Personally, I find the chocolate overwhelming (even with 1/2 cup chopped pecans added!), but they never fail to disappear first & people seek me out for the recipe!! I also cook them for 8 minutes: just until set. Usually along with the pecans, I use 1 cup chocolate chips and a cup of chocolate covered caramel baking pieces and call them Turtle Cookies!
