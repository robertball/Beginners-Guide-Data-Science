Fixed as written. The chicken turned out very tender and juicy. That said, the flavor was very strange and the sauce was very salty. I think it is because the soy sauce was reduced to a thick sauce and overwhelmed the flavor. There needed to be another flavor added to the soy sauce besides garlic and ginger. I will use my own favorite marinades and use this method of cooking chicken as it did turn out juicy chicken with a nice sauce.

This was delicious!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly!!  I can't switch my rice cooker to the stay warm setting, it does it by itself.  I just turned it off and let it sit for 20 minutes and it was perfect!!!  Thanks :)  My only negative is that I didn't double the recipe!!!

These thighs are so moist and tasty, it is unbelievable. I used the juice to cook the rice in and everything tasted wonderful. Not too salty, just enough spice to make it interesting and meat almost melts in your mouth.

Good recipe, made a few adjustments. 1) Put everything except corn starch in a slow cooker at low for 6 hrs. 2) Add 1 small chili pepper + 2 green onions chopped 3) Strain & reserve 1C. of sauce add 1 tsp. of sugar. Allow to cool and stir in 1 tbsp. of corn starch  4) Select a 4 C. mix of your favorite vegetables to stir fry + 1 minced garlic clove. Stir fry and add sauce. Bring to a boil & Stir until thickened. Serve with (brown) rice & I used bone-in thighs.
