LOVED this! I substituted vegetable broth for chicken and pure maple syrup for brown sugar; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious. You could probably omit the broth (which I think is used more to thin the miso than for flavoring), because once the dressing sits on the zucchini, it thins quite a bit. This is great with just the sauce and the zucchini, but the almonds and nori complete it perfectly.

I skipped the sesame seeds and nori for ease, and this was still a winner. It was slightly salty for my tastes (a function of the miso, as far as I can tell) but otherwise great. Also, I mixed all the dressing ingredients except the broth together, then eyeballed the amount of broth to get the desired consistency (since other reviewers had warned 1/4c was too much). Everyone loved it!

Delicious! I get asked to make this recipe for parties. The hardest part is prepping the zucchini (I julienne it) and figuring out what to do with the rest of the leftover miso paste (I can only find 16oz jars of the stuff). I use Dashi flavored miso and omit the sessame (I love the seeds but I never have them at home) and often time I forget to put in the nori. If you are apprehensive about eating zucchini raw - DON'T BE - it's awesome.

Not the biggest Miso soup fan, but love all the other ingredients so I thought I should give it a try.  My only concern when making this was which size nori sheet was called for.  I live in Japan where there are many options so I just ended up using one onigiri (riceball) sized sheet of nori.  Worked great.  I think they also sell thin slices of it at the store and may try that to cut down on prep time. Made to a T except I have already toasted seeds on hand and accidently added it to the dressing instead of sprinkling on top (won't make that mistake next time).  I tossed the zucchini into the dressing then scooped them out of the dressing and into the bowls.  Next time I'll omit the chicken stock, it's not needed.  We loved the flavors, everything just complimented each other so well.  Easy, tasty, and looks great.  I'll be making this for quests at some point.

I love, love, love this! I will definately make it again. I used half zucchini and half yellow squash (just because I like it better) and it was great. I also sauteed the squash combo in just a bit of wok oil for only a couple of minutes before tossing it with the dressing, scallions, cilantro, sesame seeds and nuts. I also used pre-toasted sesame seeds and I thought they were fine! The combination of ingrediants is really fantastic! Everyone complimented it at the dinner table! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was quite good.  I agree about omitting the chicken broth- it seems to get quite runny and would probably be better without it.

zucchini gave bitter taste. I prefer to use Japanese cucumber over raw zucchini. Japanese cucumber is good with miso.

This dressing is wonderful. I used it on a sprout salad and I believe it would be wonderful on any raw vegetable.

Paired with some seared tuna, soy dipping sauce and sticky rice, this recipe was delightful. Thank you for sharing.

Delicious!  The only thing I changed was using raw honey instead of brown sugar.  Very good!  I will make this again with all our fresh zucchini this summer.

Very Good. Sauce tastes like a dish I ordered at a Vietnamese Restaurant with rice noodles. I would make this again with the rice noodles instead of zucchini.

This turned out very well. I used 2 large zucchinis and a few carrots as well, and I didn't feel like the dressing was enough, so I doubled it. Also let it sit in the dressing for awhile. I took it to a party and got asked for the recipe! Thanks! Oh yeah, I used miso soup paste, which I already had on hand. Just buy a box of miso soup mix at the asian store - it comes with several packets of miso, plus garnish.

This was my second time making it and it was still as good as the first time, if not better! It is a very simple dish and tastes wonderful once you pull it out of the fridge. The only change I made this second time was increased the chili paste from 1/8 tsp (I cook for 2 so I adjust the serving size and that was the amount it adjusted to) to 1 Tbsp. You still really couldn't taste too much of the heat from upping the chili paste, but at least you got some of the flavor since with the original amount you couldn't taste any of it and it seemed pointless. Thank you!

Like many others I skipped adding the chicken broth and cut the zucchini into French fry size pieces.  Not paying attention I threw it in a skillet for a quick sauté then tossed with sauce and served with salmon.  I added a good bit of fresh ginger and some extra chili sauce, but while good it was lacking flavor

I omitted the chicken broth and sauteed the veggies in the Miso sauce. To make it a little more hearty, I added a cup of wild rice and served it with Salmon. Yummy!

I always look for the new recipes with zucchini, because I have a lot of it in my green house. Thank you for sharing. This recipe is great. My kids did not even know that they ate zucchini. I told it's a new cucumber salad. Worked well for my family!
