I cut the recipe to 14 servings and got 20 servings using my small cookie scoop.  I used Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage rather than the ground chicken, and these were just so yummy that I couldn't stop eating them.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I do think that I would prefer cooking them on stovetop rather than in the oven because I think they need to be turned often.  As written they were done in 15 minutes in the oven.  I would make these again. Let them cool before trying to put a toothpick in them because they will fall apart if done before.  Thanks, mmaronic!

Giving 5 stars based on tweaking this a bit. I used 2/3 the amount of breadcrumbs this recipe calls for b/c I like the meatballs more dense. I added a half stick more celery also. The kicker was that I rolled the balls with a small cube of cheddar cheese in the middle, maybe one centimeter. Then I heated another small batch of the butter and hot sauce mixture and drizzled that instead of the plain hot sauce. Blue cheese dipping sauce on the side. Huge hit.

I thought these were great... definitely a little softer than our taste in texture...  I baked a lot longer hoping to firm them up - which worked to an extent... but then the second day leftovers were perfect.  I was worried about them being bland, so I added red pepper and a lot more sauce (Frank's hot buffalo sauce) and drizzled before baking.  Mistake.  We love love love spicy food (we would order a 10 out of 10 spicy at a Chinese restaurant) - but we all agreed... it destroyed it.  So that's my fault... never again... but the flavor behind the heat was very good and we will definitely have these again.  Thanks so much!

I used Frank's Buffalo sauce instead for the red hot and butter mixture.  Still tasted good and saved on the calories!!

I cooked them for 25 minutes per one reviewer. Made for a slightly crispy outside and sooo good! Will definitely put this in our rotation!

I followed the recipe exactly as is and found that it wasn't hot/flavorful enough.  The meatballs were still delicious, maybe even better after being in the fridge overnight, but I think most of their flavor came from the extra Frank's we drizzled on top before eating.  Maybe next time we will mix some extra hot sauce in before cooking.

These were a great way to scratch the itch for chicken wings, without having all the fat and calories.  I used ground turkey breast and panko breadcrumbs.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were awesome.  Easy to make.  I added some mozzarella cheese in the middle of the ball and it oozed out perfectly.  You could make a day ahead and be ready for the party!

These were really good. I made as advertised. I liked that I could make them early and then heat up right before guests arrived. I placed ranch in the middle, drizzled buffalo bites around them and then celery around the edges. Yum!

Have made these twice.  First time I agree they were soft but did firm up over night.  Second time I accidentally left in the oven longer and they firmed up nicely without drying out too badly.  Try baking 10 min longer. love Buffalo recipes! Followed direction except for using Franks Wing sauce as another user did.

My guys love buffalo wings and I thought these meatballs would be a hit. Not a chance. First off, I shouldn't have listened to reviewers comments about leaving the meatballs in longer. They came out rather dry. Secondly, there wasn't as much buffalo flavor as I thought. I don't think I'll be making them again. I'll just continue to go the extra mile and make real Buffalo Wings.

I was outside stacking wood all day, so I didn’t have the time or energy to roll this into meatballs.  I followed the recipe exactly, adding just a touch more hot sauce and celery.  I patted it into a 9x14” pan, drizzled more hot sauce on top, and cooked it for 1/2 hour.  I sliced it into squares and served it w simple baked potatoes.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks, mmaronic!

I used ground turkey because I didn't have chicken and I cut the recipe in half. I also omitted the celery because I didn't have that either (I don't really like celery anyway so I probably won't add it next time either). I would like to try this again with ground chicken because I'm guessing it would have a slightly different flavor than ground turkey.
This recipe certainly won't take the place of buffalo chicken tenders for me, but it's a very good recipe in it's own right and I will likely make it again.

I changed a couple of things about the recipe in that I like spicier food so I used extra hot sauce in the butter/hot sauce mix and also used spicy bread crumbs. next time I may add blue cheese crumbles in the mix

I have made these a few times.  They are a lot easier than wings and I serve them either in sub rolls, over rice or with just carrot and celery sticks and blue cheese dip.  Anything Buffalo is good.
