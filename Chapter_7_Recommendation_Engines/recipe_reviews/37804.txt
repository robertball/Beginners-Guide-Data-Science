This recipe was AWESOME! I wanted a sweet/cool treat for my two young daughters for the Fourth of July.  I made these up  with cherry and blueberry jello with the Cool Whip in between in tiny paper cups with sticks.  The flavor was yummy and the kids devoured them and enjoyed them not to mention they kept us (my husband and I even enjoyed them!) cool.  What I liked best (next to the flavor) was the texture of the pop.  It was not a solid pop that you had to lick the whole time. You could actually bite it and eat pieces of it.  This was a WONDERFUL treat for a HOT day.  I am thinking of making them up in different colors for my daughters' birthday parties.  One caution though, you really need to make sure that each layer is frozen solid before you put in the next layer, and be very careful when adding the jello over the Cool Whip layer - our Cool Whip layer ended up on the bottom instead of in the middle but they were still very good!

Perfect recipe! A couple of helpful tips is first to be very patient and allow time when making these. Allow each layer to freeze solid before the addition of the next layer and that includes the whipped cream layer. I used my pastry bag and tip to pipe the whipped cream into each cup, you can also do this with a ziploc bag by snipping off a corner. I used plastic cups and small paper Dixie cups. I intended on using berry blue Jello, but mine expired, so I used lime.

These were great! Perfect for the 4th of July! Just what we needed. I did have the same problem as a previous poster where my whipped cream floated to the top. It didn't really matter, they still looked and tasted good. I was just a little disappointed that they didn't look like the picture.

They're really good! My pops looked like the ones in the picture. I didn't have any problem like others posted with whipped cream setting on the top but I let the red jello freeze for 1 1/2 hrs. before putting whipped cream and blueberry jello. I took some to work and the girls loved them. Next time I'm going to wait to do them when it gets hot instead of doing them in the winter!
