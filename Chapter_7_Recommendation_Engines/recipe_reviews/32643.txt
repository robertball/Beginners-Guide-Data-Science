How can you review this recipe if you didnt make it the way it was listed?  Pineapple, OJ, and pinacolada mix is not a smoothie!

Anyway, I made it exactly as listed and thought it was great!  If not using the rum, replace with something that has no flavor and the same consistency like water.

I followed this recipe except for the rum and lime juice and added in pina colada mix. It wasn't the greatest smoothie, but it still tasted good and was easy!

Very smooth and fruity drink.  Use slightly less rum than the recipe suggests.

Used Agave Nectar instead of sugar, 1/2 Capt Morgans and coconut rum instead of white rum - excellent drink!
