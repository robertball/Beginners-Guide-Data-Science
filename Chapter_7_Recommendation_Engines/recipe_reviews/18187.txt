My German grandmother has made these for the past 7 decades. After the mixing process, she divided the dough into 2 logs & refridgerated for 2 hrs. Sliced 1/4 inch rounds, placed 1/2 glazed cherry on top, brushed with egg yolk. Delicious!

Very tasty. They were very easy to prepare and I love the taste and texture. Not too soft and not to crisp. Perfect!

I took the advice above and creamed the butter, sugar, egg and vanilla.  Mixed in the dry ingredients and then I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 butterscotch chips.  Quick, easy and tasty.  Thanks for sharing!

I made it exactly according to the recipe. It required three cups of coffee for me to eat all 28 cookies.

This recipe is in "HIGH DEMAND" at home.  My mother who is not fond of "sweets" actually made me go out and buy butter so I could make them.  The two changes I made were creaming the butter with the sugar first for about 5 minutes, then adding the egg and vanilla, lastly, the flour with baking soda and walnuts.  I then put it in a 8 x 8 " square pan, baked them for 35 min at 350 and when done, while still soft, I cut them at a slant, (like diamond pattern) and believe me you, they are soft and chewy like a delicious Brownie or not-so-sweet walnut bars.  
Believe me, they are hard to put down!

Absolutely delicious but too sweet.  I used 1/4 cup of brown and white sugars the 2ND time I made these because the 1/2 cup each was sickening sweet; other than that a very good recipe.

my mom has baked these for years around the holiday season. Try rolling them around in powdered sugar when they cool. They will go so quick.

Easy - and Delicious. This is a great "basic cookie" recipe for all seasons and occasions. Add anything - raisins, butterscotch or chocolate chips - or not. Also a great cookie recipe to teach Young Bakers the basics!

Very easy, beautiful flavour,  but I agree  the butter needs to be mixed first. My 10 year old son enjoyed making and eating!

I agree with the first review above. Because it's such a dry recipe, it's better to cream the butter and sugars first then add the other ingredients after. But other than that, it tasted pretty good.

Oh my Gosh, these cookies are just heaven. I make them every second day because they are soo easy. By the way, the vanilla extract is not necessary- they will still turn out fantastic! And if you forget to preheat the oven, just cook the cookies for 18minutes...works for me!

Definitely change the recipe. DON'T mix the wets directly into the dries as the recipe says. Cream the butter and sugar together in a separate bowl, then add vanilla and egg. to that bowl. then slowly mix the dries into the wets. This recipe just ended up making me spend nearly an hour attempting to mix it, when it could have avoided all this trouble.

These are really good!  Small variation I did was sprinkle each cooking with sugar before baking.  Not so much for sweetness but for the look.  Excellent!

Grandkids loved these!

We changed recipe slightly by creaming butter, sugar, and egg, and adding cinnamon. We rolled dough in confectioners sugar, then baked.  We also made a batch with sprinkles for the kids. Flatten center and drop sprinkles, then bake. Delicious!!!!

I have tried this recipe and its very nice. I did find that I had to bake them longer than stated though. The first batch were too raw in the centre.
