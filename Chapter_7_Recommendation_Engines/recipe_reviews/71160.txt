Made this for dinner and it was wonderful! My fianc√©e who is very picky about any type of Asian food said this was great and asked me to make it again. This would be great to add anything you like to it. It is a wonderful base, but also good as is. Be sure to be careful how much sauce you put on top of the rice as you will not need to use all of it.

This was OK. I did leave out the mushrooms because the bf hates mushrooms, but I'm not sure how much difference it would have made.
He liked it, I thought it kind of tasted like funky fried rice. Since we both agreed we like my fried rice better, I probably won't make this again.

It was pretty good, but tasted nothing like the Oyakodon I ate many times in Japan.  The sauce was too thin and the dish needed more salty flavours.

This was delicious! Easy to make with stress-free prepping. I didn't have shitake mushrooms so I used regular ones instead, and I also didn't add the snow peas in. Tastes great and seems pretty healthy (notice you didn't have to use oil at all in this recipe!) I'll definitely make this again in the future.

So easy and delicious! I was a little wary adding that scrambled egg, but it turned out perfectly. It's so easy to add whatever vegetables you have in your fridge. Also, you can subsitute teriyaki sauce for the soy if you are looking for something a little sweeter.

Didnt think it would be good but it was in fact DELICIOUS. The only change I made was to add extra chicken (we are a meat loving household), double the sauce, and add an extra egg and some egg white to compensate for the extra chicken. It was fantastic and my daughter (20 mo old) gobbled it up. Will definitely make it again.

It was really quick and easy.  I used half terriyaki and half soya sauce for the 1/4 cup.  Next time, I'll add more egg, I used three, and it wasn't enough.  Perfect taste for my family.  Loved it!

Tip: Try to use UNSALTED stock if possible. If all you have is salted stock, reduce the soy sauce a bit to avoid the final dish being too salty.    This recipe lives up to its name - very quick to make!  Followed it almost exactly, but I used homemade dashi stock (unsalted) instead of chicken stock because I was also making miso with a dashi base. Recipe urned out beautifully, but chicken stock would be fine. I loved that this recipe used easy to find ingredients.  Husband loved it!!

I tried this tonight and my two girls (14,7) liked it.  They said it basically tastes like chicken noodle soup but with rice instead of noodles. All I had was long grain rice and it didn't cook as through because I need 6 servings (for lunch for the week) so next time I will divide the rice into two containers to cook more thoroughly.  We definitely will have this again.

Must reduce the soy sauce. Despite using unsalted stock, it came out too salty.

Add even more veggies for a healthy option. Would taste great with brown rice too!

Made this tonight for my Japanese husband and he loved it!  Said it reminded him of comfort food his mom used to make when he was growing up.  Thank you for a great recipe!  Super easy....I made rice in the rice cooker rather than on the stove and doubled everything including the sauce so there were leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Delicious!

I liked this recipe, it had a good flavor, was easy to make, and was fairly cheap too.
I especially liked the addition of syrrachia.

This was delicious! I'm new to cooking Japanese food (this was the first time I've ever used shiitake mushrooms!), and my husband is VERY picky when it comes to how good/authentic his Japanese food is. I found this dish a breeze to prepare, and he thought it was delicious and wants me to make it again! Fantastic recipe for beginners.

I made it using chicken tighs and only onions but turned out great!  Only thing I would recommend is using 1 1/2 cup of water for the rice (my rice was a little soggy) Anyways, great quick recipe that I'll definitely use again.

This was so good and easy.  My kids even ate it.  We think that this is probably a good base for other Japanese dishes, so we are going to try it again with some different vegetables.
