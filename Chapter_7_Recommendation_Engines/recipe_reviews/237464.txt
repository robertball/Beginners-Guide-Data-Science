Very rich and delicious! For the stock I used shells from crayfish, then used shrimp in place of crabmeat. Iâ€™ll definitely make it again.

I made this for my boyfriend and his mother a few weeks ago and they absolutely loved it. She literally licked the bowl, so score. I used regular flour and vegetable broth instead of seafood stock and I added a diced carrot. Also I'm not sure why this recipe calls for half and half and cream and milk (as half and half is just cream and milk) but obviously you can avoid extra purchases by skipping the half and half and just doing 8 oz milk and 8 oz cream. Do yourself a solid and MAKE THIS RECIPE!
