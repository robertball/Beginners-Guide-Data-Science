I don't know why previous commenters are saying that this batter is thin and runny. Other than adding a tbsp of baking powder (as I prefer fluffy pancakes) and an extra tbsp of sugar since I didn't have chocolate chips on hand, I followed the recipe to the letter and the batter was the perfect thickness for scooping and pouring. I lowered the heat on my frying pan to medium low and these pancakes cooked up fluffy and perfect very quickly (2-3 minutes on the first side; 1 minute after flipping). My kids loved them, comparing them to having chocolate cake for breakfast. I gave them 4 stars only because I had to add the baking powder. I will definitely make these again.

Dense, thin and took forever to cook. Also, they did not taste chocolately at all.

OMGosh!  This pancake was the best I ever had!  I made no alterations and the recipe is perfect!  The pancakes were  light and fluffy, it had the right amount of sweetness and the chocolate chips just made them even more heavenly...my daughter (8) said they tasted like brownies! I served with raspberry sauce, blackberries and confectioner sugar!  The BEST! This is a keeper.  THX

Not good.  They were VERY thin and dense. I was really disappointed.

These had more of a crepe texture rather than pancakes to me. The batter was very thin. I made some with the chocolate chips and some without. The ones without the chocolate chips were not very flavorful. These might be good with some whipped cream, but I don't think they'll become a staple in my kitchen.

I added about 1 Tsp of baking powder.  Used both white and chocolate chips. We really enjoyed these. We made them for brunch on Saturday.  The kids LOVED them and my oldest daughter wants these for her birthday sleepover breakfast coming up soon. Thank you.

My picky 2 year old requested chocolate pancakes for lunch, so I turned to this recipe. In an attempt to bulk it up a bit, I added a mashed, over ripe banana, added a couple scoops of flaxseed and omitted the butter. I think I also added some cinnamon. I also didn't have any chocolate chips, and figured we could do without the added sugar anyway. I thought the batter was very thin, but it cooked up nicely. Not a fluffy pancake by any means, but tasty for sure! Not quite as thin as a crepe, but not quite as fluffy as a traditional pancake. They were a hit with all the kids.

I thought it was very tasty.  I had to add a little more flour to thicken it up a bit.  And I used the suggestion of 1 TBSP Baking Powder.  I used real 85% dark chocolate and chopped it up and I heated up some raspberry preserves and used that as a topper.  I also tried maple syrup, but the raspberry preserves are the way to go.

These were ok at best. I had to add baking powder and a bit of extra flour to thicken up the otherwise thin batter. I also added banana slices, and swapped some of the chocolate chips for peanut butter chips. My chocoholic brother described these as "brown pancakes"- all the chocolate flavor came from the chocolate chips & the nutella we slathered on top. I found these really thin and rather "rubbery", as mentioned by other reviewers. I definitely prefer "Good Old Fashioned Pancakes" with chocolate chips, topped with nutella or fudge sauce if I'm looking for a real treat.

I made this as directed and loved it. If you like your chocolate-chocolate chip cookies a little mushy (like I do) you should try these pancakes. Perfect for kids!

I love the recipe. Only thing I changed was I added 1/4 cup more flour 1 tablespoon baking powder and 1 extra tablespoon sugar. Came out perfectly fluffy and my sister loves them. 
(I added more flour because of elevation the batter was really super thin and pancakes spread out too much)

I too added 1 Tsp of baking powder.  The final product is sweet, which I found made maple syrup redundant, but it went quite well with apple cider syrup, a recipe for which is also available on this site.

I added baking powder as some people recommended, and replaced over half the flour with whole wheat flour.  Someone had commented that the cocoa powder didn't seem to add much chocolate flavor, so I left out the cocoa powder and sugar.  For the last pancake, I put chocolate syrup in the batter and it tasted great, so that could definitely be an alternative to the cocoa powder and chocolate chips, especially if not everyone wants chocolate in their pancakes.   We put whipped cream and cherries on the pancakes and REALLY enjoyed them.

The texture was heavy and all the chocolate chips settled in the bottom so the underneath side was kind of rubbery (for the lack of a better description)..  I think maybe these need some baking powder!..  I used a cast iron flower design pan, but that shouldn't have affected the taste/testure much.   I won't make these again!

These turned out great! I added an extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and the baking powder like some others had suggested and didn't have any problems with the batter being too thin. Because of the cocoa powder the pancake on it's own would be bitter but the chocolate chips balanced it out nicely. My family loved these, even my mom who doesn't typically like sweet things like this. I'll definitely be making these again in the future!

I will add baking powder next time, because I also like fluffier pancakes.  I also had some raspberries that I needed to use, so added to batter.  It was a great flavor combo.

My kids love these..... The batter is very runny and the pancakes cook up very thin and they took really long to cook....  also did not taste like chocolate. The only way to taste the chocolate is to add syrup onto the pancake in order to get the chocolate the flavor.

I added additional flour and chocolate chip morsels and baking powder and they begin to fluff up. most definitely nothing like the chocolate chip pancakes that you get from

The recipe as written was not edible to me.  There is no baking soda so they did not raise at all and the batter was so thin...  The first one was like a crepe with this big blobs of chocolate chips sticking out.  I added some more flour and some baking soda and they were a little bit better.  But I would have been better off satisfying my craving with regular pancakes with chocolate chips thrown in.

Would recommend adding chocolate chips after pouring batter on skillet for even distribution and so the chocolate does not dissolve in batter and stick to the bottom

The batter was the perfect consistency and it was so quick to whip up.

Batter was quite thin and liquidy, and they turned out more like crepes than pancakes. I thought the pancakes/crepes themselves were kinda gross (I'm a big pancake person but crepes not so much), but at least my family members really liked them.

Its more of a crepe consistency, on the thicker side but still very yummy. If you use some sort of hot chocolate mix it will have more of a double or triple Chocolate taste

These were gross. If I could give it 0 stars I would. They do not taste anything like chocolate. In fact, there was no taste. I even added a 1/4 cup more cocoa and a couple tablespoons more of sugar. I added baking powder so they were not flat and dense but still did nothing.  Since no one in the house could eat them, I tried masking the pancakes in powdered sugar. That helped a little. Oh well, I realize with cooking comes a lot of trial and error. I’m just sad I didn’t get chocolate gooey pancakes like I was reading.

What really grinds my gears is when someone rates a recipe high and then says "I added all this and it was great", well you didn't follow the recipe so don't leave a review. Now that I'm done complaining I'll talk about the recipe, it's awful. I followed the recipe to the t and the texture was nothing like a pancake, like other reviewers said it's more of a crepe texture. I made them this morning for the family and threw out the majority of the batter and nobody ate them, good thing I made bacon too. I was going to try to salvage the recipe but they were so gross I decided not to even waste the time.

I thought that the recipe was like eating a cake for breakfast! It was an enjoyable breakfast. But,  I think I would make a vanilla pancake.

I made two changes. I added a 1\2 tbsp of baking powder for cloudiness and mixed it with an immersion blender. They were good.

I took this recipe but used organic ingredients. Coconut milk instead of normal milk, brown sugar instead of normal sugar, and organic unbleached flour instead of the normal one. Man these were gooooooooooood

These were horrible. Thin. Dense. Chewy. Kids didn't like them at all and my kids eat everything.  Here hoping the next recipe I use is better.

The absence of any leavening is a sad, sad joke. It must be a typo, because nobody is that cruel or ignorant. I see many pissy reviews about the batter being runny, long cook times, leathery texture, no crispy exterior-- all these problems are solved with baking powder. The only changes I made were using a whole cup of MILK chocolate chips and 1.5 tsp of BP. My kids went nuts.

Followed the recipe exactly, but added an extra half cup of flour since the batter was runny. Didn't have chocolate chips on hand and used peanut butter instead of syrup. Wasn't fluffy how I like, but they were okay

Followed the suggestions of a few others.. added a tablespoon of baking powder and a scant 1/4 cup of extra flour. Also added a generous squeeze of Hershey’s chocolate syrup to the egg mixture before adding it to the dry ingredients. They were plenty fluffy. Made a few without the chocolate chips and just sprinkled them in after I flipped them, they stayed fluffier this way then when I added the rest of the chips to the batter. Served then with some vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream, marshmallow Fluff and extra Hershey’s chocolate syrup. Very tasty and not too sweet.

I made these twice. I followed the recipe the first time. After reading the reviews, I added 1/4 C. of flour, 3/4 TBS of baking powder, 1/4 tsp of baking soda, and soured my milk. They rose beautifully and turned out well. I would like a little more flavor, but they had excellent chocolate  taste. I might try brown sugar next time.

These pancakes were pretty disgusting. I've made pancakes from scratch before and they have never turned out this bad! The batter turned out runny and I followed all the directions, and after they were cooked they had a gross texture.

I thought these were plenty chocolatey and sweet enough. However, the recipe as written, doesn't quite work for me. People are complaining that they are too thin. One problem is it doesn't call for baking powder; I added 2 tsp to help them rise, and it probably could have used 3. The second thing is it calls for a bit too much milk. I cut it back to 1 cup, and it was plenty. Mine came out really well and tasty, but if you follow the recipe as written, they would be flat and thin.

A few years back I went to I hop with a group of friends. Not liking pancakes I didn't order much. But sat across from someone eating chocolate pancakes. They smelt delicious. After 45 minutes of trying to figure out what the smell reminded me of I got! Chocolate gramham crackers! So voila. Came across this reciepe  googling IHOP chocolate pancake recipe. I took someone's reccomendation to add baking soda because when in mood for pancakes I prefer fluffier too. Maybe cutting the recipe in half ruined it or maybe the recipe itself. I don't know. And I added vanilla. I burned the  out of them (probably my own mistake) but aside from that the pancakes did not taste like Ihop's or anything really. The chocolate was non existent except for when I bit into a gooey chocolate chip. The only good part of the recipe. And they definitely did not smell like chocolate gramham crackers. If anyone has tips please let me know. If not, the hunt continues for a tasteful rich chocolate pancake

These were delicious. I only made 1/2 of what the recipe calls for because I made them for myself and my 4 and 5 yr old. These were so great. I DID MAKE A FEW CHANGES: Although I split the recipe in half, I used the same amount of butter and salt as the original, while adding half a tablespoon of baking powder for added fluffiness. For the kids pancakes I made faces with strawberries, bananas and whipped cream. No syrup needed.

If you cut back on the milk (1 cup), it's not terribly runny. The chocolate chips add to the consistency, so if you omit them, even less milk is needed. I would back up Krystal Taylor's recommendation for the tbsp of baking powder, because my batch came out noticeably flat. 

This is a very sweet if one dimensional dish that will surely please any children at the breakfast table. Fresh strawberries enhance the plate with minimal effort.

I changed this recipie and was happy.  I used Oikos greek chocolate triple zero yogurt instead of butter.  I also used 1/8 cup hot chocolate mix instead of 1/4 of ony cocao powder.  I like fluffy cakes so I added 1.5 tps of baking power.  My household ate them up. Very tastey.

this was a great recipe. The batter was perfect consistency. What i did a bit different was to substitute about half the milk for coffee and a few tablespoons of dark hot cocoa powder  instead of using unsweetened cocoa powder because i was out of it at home. I read somewhere that a bit of coffee makes chocolate taste more chocolaty. It turned out to die for!!

I made these pancakes for my two boys for breakfast and the mixture was very thin like crepes. I'm determined to make them light and  fluffy the way my family likes them, so I will try again using 1/4 more flour and 1 tablespoon of baking powder.

Loved this recipe. BUT we like fluffy pancakes so we added another 1/4 cup flour and some baking powder to thicken the batter up. All in all..we will make these again.

These are delicious pancakes. They were a touch dense but I like them that way.  Definitely a decadent treat so I made them small silver-dollar pancakes. Yumm!!

Batter was so thin, we didn't want to finish these. I'd stick with a good buttermilk recipe and create your own chocolate chip recipe. Never making again.

My friend and i made these hoping for a fluffy, chocolaty pancake. However, they did not rise at all (no baking powder or soda). Also, they had an unappealing, rubbery texture. They took forever to cook. Definitely NOT making these again!

the flavor was good, but texture was dense. I think the recipe should call for 1 tbsp of baking powder to fluff the pancakes up. I would make again with the addition of baking powder.

I initially followed this recipe exactly as it is written. The batter was very thin and runny, and the pancakes cooked up to be thin, dense, almost custardy (and not in a good way). The taste was slightly bitter, with very little chocolate taste and the texture was unappealing. The second time, I doctored the recipe up a bit. I added extra flour, sugar, and put in about a TBSP of baking powder. The next couple rounds came out looking and tasting a lot better, but still not awesome. I'll be trying chocolate pancakes again, but definitely not with this recipe.

These were tasty pancakes.  It had a nice chocolate flavor without being overly sweet.  I added 1 tsp of baking powder hoping for a fluffy pancake but they were, excuse the expression, "as flat as a pancake".  They were not fluffy at all.  I didn't find the batter to be particularly runny so I was expecting the pancake to rise but it didn't.  Instead of mixing the chocolate chips in the batter, I sprinkled them on top after I poured it into the pan.

I made these for breakfast today and I was in heaven. They turned out better than I expected. Since I didn't have vanilla, I used the brown sugar rendering from the sautéed ripe plantains I made as a side to go with them. I also put some plantain in the batter, so I reduced the amount of chocolate chips but it was a nice combo because the pancakes were slightly sweet but not too sweet.

This pancake was good but more like a crepe. I rolled strawberry pie  filling in them and topped with powder sugar. Kids loved them, more like dessert though. I think 1/4 tsp baking soda will fluff them more.
