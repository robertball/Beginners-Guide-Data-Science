Delish!!  I made as written, marinated chicken breasts about 5 hours, and grilled them.  I served them with rice and snow peas.

This was very easy and I used it on peppers & onions at a party. Everyone loved it! I would definitely make it again and use it for fajitas with chicken.

Simple, easy and flavorful blend! Marinated chicken breast, sirloin, and veggies for approx. 6 hrs.  Left proportions as is, but might add more chili sauce next time for added flavor.

Made this for the Recipe ground selection of the week. I made chicken kabobs and marinated the veggies/fruits and chicken all day. Used the veggie marinade to baste, just cook it with a wee bit of corn starch to thicken it first on stove top so it sticks better. I did add in a bit more seasoning than just cumin after tasting it, just spice it up with your favorite seasonings. I used May Ploy chili sauce and a couple teaspoons of Sambel Oelek for added heat. Was a great marinade to pair with fruits and veggies. My eldest son wanted the marinade recipe....we all really liked it.

Prepared for the Recipe Group May, 2014...I used less honey (about 1/3 cup, you might want to start low and add), and a tablespoon of garlic chili sauce for a little heat. I thought it definitely needed something acetic, I added two tablespoons of rice vinegar, and only one teaspoon oil. I used ths on chicken cutlets that hubs grilled to crispy perfection!  Great marinade, a definite do over for sure.  Want to try this on pork chops.  Thanks fo sharing your recipe with us, Lindsay!

Recipe Group Selection:  24, May 2014 ~ I used this marinade on organic boneless chicken breast and it was delicious.  I was worried that the honey would make this too sweet, but it wasn't.  The chicken marinated for 2 days, so it had plenty of flavor.  I also made veggie kabobs with zucchini and onion and had fresh asparagus that DH grilled.  I did as Lindsay, the submitter suggested and saved part of the marinade to baste as we grilled and also used the marinade on the veggies.  Remember to not use the marinade the meat soaked in, but to save some "clean" marinade to baste with and to use on veggies.  A nice selection last week.

This really was a sensational marinade. I printed the recipe a long time ago and never made it, but saw it as I was flipping through my recipe book yesterday. I used this on chicken & beef and it was awesome.

This recipe was great! I added white wine vinegar just to make it a little lighter tasting (even parts as soy and honey) and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.
It actually came out with really nice flavour

I think it's easy to over do it with the cumin, and next time I'll cut back on it, but otherwise this is quite good.

We got some already prepared chicken kabobs & used this recipe to marinade them in a big cooking dish. The marinade gave the plain chicken & veggies a very nice kick. Will definitely be using this marinade again & am thinking of using it on shrimp kabobs.

I made this with skinless boneless chicken breast halves, but did not make it into kabobs.  I scaled the recipe to two servings, which gave me plenty for my small amount of chicken.  I used Heinz Chili Sauce for the tomato-based chili sauce, but I did add a generous 1/4 teaspoon of Thai Chili Garlic Paste for a little kick.  In hindsight it could have used more as we could barely detect any heat.  I also cut back on the cumin to 1/2 teaspoon, instead of 3/4 teaspoon, for my scaled version.  I made the marinade in the morning and my chicken marinated for about nine hours.  I did forget to reserve some for basting, but I will remember to do that next time.  This was very good and not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be.  In fact I may back off on the soy sauce to make it just a bit sweeter next time.  Hubs and I both enjoyed this and it’s super easy to put together, so it looks like I’ll be making it again!

Recipe Group: Nice and flavorful! Seemed like a lot of honey but the end result was wonderful. I marinaded beef and chicken for an hour and a half, the veggies I brushed with some reserved marinade ten minutes before grilling. The rest of the reserved marinade was brushed on everything while grilling. It was great!

Made this for Recipe Group. I will use this recipe again; it had a nice flavor. I used chicken breasts that I salt/peppered and sliced in half.  I was only able to marinate for maybe 20 min, but the meat was still flavorful. I used sriracha for the chili sauce, which gave it a nice kick. I realized after we were eating them that I forgot to add the oil to the marinade, but the chicken still came out tender. I know this would have been even better if I had added the oil and marinated for the correct amount of time. Thanks for the recipe Lindsay Clark!

Good flavor with mild spice.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I used it on cubed pork loin, green and red peppers, onions, mushrooms, and pineapple.  The marinade was good on all.  Marinated meat for about 4 hours and vegies for about one hour.

Perfect marinade! While I grilled the kabobs I put the leftover marinade in a pot to reduce and use in case the kabob were dry. Glad I did because the reduced marinade was DELICIOUS!! I'd reduce and jar it as a sauce for almost anything savory.

Fantastic as written.  Made kabobs for first time using some nice sirloin and this couldn't have been better.  Loved the little kick at the end.  May end up using this as my go to steak marinade.

I used it on shrimp and veggie kabobs.  I thought it was too sweet and I used less honey than the recipe called for.  But, I really don't like sweet marinades.

It was easy to prepare .  These are ingredients that I always have on hand so I will make this again.
