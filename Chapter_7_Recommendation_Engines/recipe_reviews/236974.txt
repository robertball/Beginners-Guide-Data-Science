Once again, a great dinner resulted from a deliberate attempt to use stuff up that needed to be used up.  It’s sort of like lasagna, but not lasagna, gooey, cheesy, and just plain delicious. But I followed the recipe loosely. First, why sink the peppers into a quarter inch of water?  As I always do when I make stuffed peppers, I used my own tomato sauce instead, tho’ commercial tomato sauce is a fine substitute, and much better than water!  You’ll want that extra sauce to spoon over your peppers!  Also, I used a medley of colored peppers, as I find store-bought green peppers a little on the strong and somewhat bitter side.  I added chopped onion, minced garlic, and fresh parsley and oregano to the meat and simply used tomato sauce, no tomato paste.  (I am not a huge fan of tomato paste, which seems to contribute a sweetness I don’t care for)  I just cooked it down to the consistency that seemed right.  I used no cheddar.  Even had it on hand, but thought all mozzarella was more fitting.  I ate mine as is, but served Hubs’ with rice, knowing it would be his preference.  (Well, um, mine too, but I’ve got to watch the carbs more and more as I get older.  Hrumph.)  These were done in 50 minutes, and I added the second sprinkling of mozzarella during the last five minutes.  At 50 minutes the peppers were fork tender but still had enough firmness to maintain their shape and not be limp and mushy.  (Note:  I used a pound of meat for just 2-1/2 peppers, and it was just right)

This is one heck of a good stuffed pepper recipe. I followed the recipe as directed, except used colored bells instead of green, since that is what I had on hand. I did substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese as suggested by the cook, a 15oz. container was perfect. I didn't need all the sauce for the filling, so put some of the reserved sauce on our rice and then topped with the peppers. I waited to top with the last sprinkle of cheese the last five minutes of baking. My peppers were done to perfection in 50 minutes. I did add in a chopped onion to my hamburger mixture and a bit more Italian herbs, basil and parsley to the sauce, since I have some fresh in my garden. My husband could not stop raving about this meal. This one is a keeper!

We loved these.  Only thing we changed was that we added some fresh basil, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Next time I will make deeper boats by cutting slice from the side of a pepper and scooping out seeds using 1 pepper per serving.   That way you can get more filling per serving.

These were delicious,especially the sauce. The only issue I had was the cheese melted out of the peppers. I will use a larger pepper next time and there will be a next time. For low carb these are a winner!

Alright but lacked pizzazz.  Could be really good with a few mods i think. Next batch I'll drop the cottage cheese and add more SHARP cheddar vs less mozz. Also will poke some holes in the peppers with a fork(peppers were a bit watery inside) and use a spaghetti sauce i like(or add a lot more seasonings at least) instead of the tomato paste/sauce mixture.

We were surprised at how good these were.  We simmered halved colored bells (grown in our ten gallon buckets) until slightly tender. Mixed parm cheese with cottage cheese and layered it with ground beef/tomato paste mixture (heavy on oregano and fresh pressed garlic) into pepper halves. Sprinkled with  fresh pizza cheese, topped each with a pepperoni slice  and baked at 350 for 15 min.   Used scrunched tin foil to fill in empty space in baking dish and to keep peppers up. Oiled glass baking dish - no water.

Delicious!! Was so light and refreshing. A great change from traditional noodles. My husband likes low carb meals so this was just right. I added some garlic, mushrooms, onions and white wine to the sauce to make it more my style. Acooked some noodles as a side dish. Yummy!! I'm sure it will be a monthly dish.

My family loves this and I have made it several times. I used suggestions from other reviews to help me. I did use red,yellow and orange peppers instead of green peppers.I used ricotta cheese mixed with grated Parmesan cheese instead of the cottage cheese. Also, I used a jar of spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce and tomato paste.

This was a good recipe, but I will make some changes the next time I make it. I followed the recipe except for two things. I made my own meat sauce rather than follow the sauce recipe here just because I like my own sauce better than any other I have tried. I also used parmesan cheese as is mentioned in the cook's notes and I didn't put in the cheddar. I just can't think of cheddar cheese as belonging in any type of lasagna dish. I followed the suggestion of putting some of the tomato sauce in the bottom of the baking dish instead of water and that worked fine.  I will try these again but will substitute the cheese filling from the recipe on this site for Ricotta Stuffed Zucchini for the plain cottage or ricotta cheese. I think the dish will have a little more taste and body to it. The recipe as written is good, and it is a low carb way to get a lasagna taste.  With a little tweaking I think it will be a great dish.

Amazing.  I didn't do it with ricotta, and I love ricotta so that might be what we try next time.  This was a refreshing change from eating soo many noodles.

Really good!  I would use less water in the pan and I added fresh Parmesan cheese on top.  Everyone loved it.

This was really good and was even enjoyed by my pasta-loving boyfriend. Next time I would probably add onion and possibly something to give it a little kick, but it really was good as listed in the recipe. Turned out great for lunch the next day too!

Used ricotta cheese as well with grass fed bison ground meat, absolutely delicious and easy! I also placed it over quinoa mixed with left over sauce. Yummy!

This was a simple and good recipe.  To keep it Paleo, I left out the cheese toping.  Tasted good and reheated well all week!

Only downside is this really didn't seem like Lasagna, but more like just Italian Stuffed Peppers.  Still - thank you for the good recipe.

My family LOVED this recipe!  I'm counting carbs and wanted lasagna, but couldn't do it using noodles.  So, I tried this recipe and WOW!!!  We didn't even miss the noodles!  Like some other reviewers, I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and poured a can of of no sugar added Hunts Spaghetti sauce in the cooking dish,  instead of water.  Topping the peppers with the sauce just took it over the top.  I also used provolone and muenster cheeses instead of mozzarella as it is what I had.  This is a GREAT "go to" recipe!!!  Will absolutely make again!!!

This is a family favorite (from my 7 year old up to my husband).  The flavor is great!  The only thing I change is the amount of water in the pan. I use a little less so the peppers don't get too soggy.

I think the concept of the recipe is excellent! Since the reviews consistently complained about blandness, I decided to make half the recipe to test it. As I went through the recipe, I made small modifications to add flavor without altering the recipe too much. I used in addition to the tomato paste, and sauce, about a 1/2 cup of Italian crushed tomatoes. Used also a dash of Italian dried seasoning. Added about 1/4 c of finely chopped onion, a 1/4 c of chopped orange/yellow sweet pepper I had on hand, and one minced garlic clove. I only used 1 tsp of tomato paste as the crushed tomatoes help to thicken sauces. Now, I did not have cheddar or ricotta so I used part skim mozzarella and Parmesan about 1/2 c of each. With all that said this will result in a meat sauce instead of a tomato sauce. I spooned the meat sauce in the baking pan and after rectifying the salt and pepper, the sauce was very flavorful. I baked it covered with aluminum foil for 30 minutes and then baked it uncovered for an extra 15 minutes. The recipe was excellent!

This is an Awesome recipe!  Very light and refreshing take on lasagna!  A great summer dish that looks great with large bright red, orange and yellow peppers.  A couple of reviewers said it was basically stuffed peppers, but this is far from the truth!  It really is the flavor of lasagna with out the heavy taste of all the pasta!
I made it with what cheese I had on hand which was shredded mozzarella and ricotta, I also used my favorite store bought sauce. 
I followed another reviewer's suggestion of partially cooking the peppers, which I microwaved, then placed the other ingredients in them.  This cut down on the time my oven was on which was great in July!!
I followed another suggestion of not putting water in the baking dish, but used sauce instead.
I wish I had followed the suggestion of placing a couple of holes in the peppers so some of the water could drain out of the peppers as they cooked.  I will definitely do that next time.
I made this for one of my girlfriends that came over for dinner last night and we both loved this dish.  I will most definitely make this beautiful, unique and very flavorful dish again, and again!!

I made this last night, it was fantastic!  I used hot Italian chicken sausage.  I also threw in an onion, the pepper tops, and even a jalapeño in the food processor and cooked them with the sausage.  Next time I may put an ounce of water in the baking pan instead of a cup.

Very good. I used large poblano peppers instead of bell peppers. I also used Mexican oregano,  ground turkey, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper. Whenever I use ground turkey, I season my recipes a little more to enhance the flavor.

I substituted ricotta for cottage cheese.  Used mozzarella and Parmesan.  Also substituted yellow peppers in lieu of green.  No water in pan and covered with foil to bake.  We loved them, will make again.

It was good but not great.  The amount of sauce was way too much and there wasn't enough ground beef.  I thought putting the cheese on top for the entire cooking time would burn the cheese, and I was right.  The cheese should have just been put on in the last 5 or 10 minutes.  The burnt cheese, however, at least gave the sauce a little more substance.  Since some of the stuffing came out of the pepper when I took it out of the dish, having the water was not a good thing because the stuffing fell in the water.  The flavor was good but it was just too saucy.

It's a simple recipe and a good starting point.  The reason I rated it 3 stars was becuase I changed it up a little and found it to be kind of bland.  I'll make it again and I'll spice it up a little bit.  The change I made was using ricotta cheese.

I did love this recipe, however I made some changes that helped. I added diced onion, fresh minced garlic, italian seasoning and mushrooms to the burger. I used a jar of spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce/paste and seasonings. I used both red and green bell peppers. The red turned out nice and soft. When making again, I will for SURE cover in foil and bake extra to soften the green peppers. And then remove to brown the cheese. I would also NOT add so much water to the baking dish. I don't think it needed it. I think spraying the dish with nonstick cooking spray would be just fine.

Made the recipe according to directions and really liked it.  Next time I will add some garlic and possibly some crushed red pepper.  I will also take some of the other suggestions to add the cheese topping toward the end of the baking time.  Adding it at the beginning caused it to get brown and crunchy.

We used red and yellow peppers and added sautéed  onions to the sauce. When we make again we'll add basil and an egg to the ricotta cheese. Very tasty!

This was very good, very tasty. Just not drop dead gorgeous if you're looking for spicy or something along that line (some members of the family put hot sauce on theirs). It's easy and quick to make. You could use leftover spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and paste. I don't like to change anything the first time I make a recipe but I did have some ricotta cheese I needed to use up so I used that instead of cottage cheese. Close enough.

This was pretty freaking great. I used red bell peppers because they were on sale (and I prefer them), but otherwise made no changes. Great dinner and great leftovers too.

Just fabulous and heats up well for days.  I also put in a jar of pasta sauce on the bottom of the pan, used ricotta and added a bag of success rice to the meat mixture (I always use sweet turkey sausage for things like this).   I probably put more cheese (including ricotta) than it calls for as I do with all lasagna.  Kids loved it to although my 8 year old wouldn't eat the pepper.   

I don't eat wheat - and this helps with my lasagna craving!

My husband and I loved it!! After reading some of the reviews I did make a few changes. I added onions and mushrooms to the lean ground beef. I used Ragu spegetti sauce instead of the 3cans of tomato sauce. Finally, I used 1 cup cottage cheese mixed with half a cup of Parmesan cheese. This receipt was a great starting point!

Even my extremely picky husband enjoyed this one! It's rare that I can say that about new recipes I find. I did reduce the recipe, as we are on the Keto Diet and have reduced our portions (and we still have plenty of leftovers!) I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, and left out the cheddar as well. I also took the suggestion of using the tomato sauce instead of water in the bottom of my baking dish. Very delicious!

I made this per the recipe. We found it very tasty but a bit to salty. I would make it again but cut the salt in half and probably use a different pasta/tomato sauce.

This is a fantastic recipe! The first time, I ended up adding some uncooked rice to the sauce while simmering to make this a bit more substantial, since hubby forgot to get the cottage cheese or ricotta but, I have also made this with the ricotta and no rice and that is delicious, as well, and of course a lot more low-carb! The peppers get just soft enough so as not to be completely soggy, which is perfect since I like some crunch! Thanks for a great recipe!

I googled 'gluten free lasagna' while I was at the grocery store and this recipe popped up.  As in previous reviews I used ricotta and added onions, mushrooms and fresh herbs.  I added the water to the baking pan as directed, but I think next time I will add marinara to the bottom of the pan as another reviewer suggested.  It turned out so good and it was super easy.  I will definitely make this dish again!
