This was a very tasty dish and the whole family loved it.  We did add extra shrimp.  The one problem is the cooking time. After about 5 hours on high I noticed it was almost done.  If I had left it for 7 -9 as stated then it would have been mush.  I had to turn it off for 2 hours and then proceed as directed with the orzo and shrimp.  Keep an eye on this when cooking.  Great reheated leftovers.

It was OK - not nearly spicy enough, though, and it lacked the flavor of traditional jambalaya, even after adding extra spices. If I were to make this again, I would add a spicy andouille sausage and a heap of cajun seasoning. I only ancini de pepi, so I served it over the traditional hot white rice instead of orzo. My 4 and 6 year olds ate a good portion.

For a jamabalaya made in a crock pot instead of from scratch with the traditional roux, it's not bad. However, since I'm accustomed to the traditional ways of making Cajun and Creole dishes, I'm probably not going to use this recipe all that often. There just seemed to be something lacking about the flavor. Maybe next time I'll up the amount of Cajun seasoning I used in place of the Italian.

Strange version of jambalaya.  Aside from that the only part that tasted good in the end was the chicken.

First of all, I made a couple of changes to this recipe. I used a full tsp of salt instead of 1/2 and added about a tbsp of chili powder to give it a little more kick and depth. Also, I didn't have any orzo, so I used instant brown rice. The pros to this recipe are that it is very easy and a great example of slow cooker "make it and forget it". The cons (in my opinion) are that even with the added salt and spices, it was still kind of bland.  This is more of a "mock jambalaya" simply because a true jambalaya has a lot more kick and richness created by the roux and cajun spices. However, there is a lot of room for experimentation with this recipe, and I will continue to use it as a base and play around with it.

I also added cajun style andouille sausage, a lot more spices, and some Frank's Hot Sauce to make it extra spicy. It definitely hit the spot on this nice snow day!  It was pretty easy to make!

Delicious! I used more orzo than it called for because it seemed a little soupy without it. My husband and I both enjoyed this dish.

this recipe was pretty good. it was my first time making jambalaya. i added about 1.5 of veggie broth and used wild rice, since i didn't have orzo. i had cook everything longer than i anticipated, which was fine. after the rice cooked down, i added hot sauce to each serving. omg.. my husband LOVED it! i will seriously do this again. it lasted us a couple days (just us two).

This recipe was fantastic.  I was worried about chicken in the crockpot all day, but it was so tender and moist and just broke apart in the Jambalaya.  Thanks for a great recipe.

We had this for dinner tonight and we were quite impressed.  Excellent proportioning of ingredients.  We found the spice could  hold its own but be adjusted for those who like it hawt.  We wish we read the reviews about adding the andouille sausage and will try that for next time.

My husband loved it and he is picky about food.  To spice it up for him, I just put 4 dashs of Tabasco sauce when I served him a bowl.

This was good. I used 1/2 teaspoon creole seasoning in place of the cayenne pepper because my kids were eating it.  I had to add some to my bowl to spice it up a bit.  Overall, this recipe wasn't too bad.

I really liked this recipe and had fun playing around with it a bit (although one time I added way too much orzo and it was way too thick). You can use different spices, although I used a Cajun seasoning mix that I already had on hand. I left out the green peppers because I don't like them, but otherwise kept the recipe pretty much the same. Thanks!

Other than prep time this was an easy recipe to make.  I made it for a group of people, and although it was a little dry for me, my husband and our friends loved it.  Next time we may try it with andioulle sausage instead of chicken.

This was great. My whole family loved it. We are all trying to eat healthy and lose weight. Easy to prepare, tasty and healthy to eat. I only cooked it for 7 hours. Added a can of water after added the tomatoes and added crushed red pepper and black pepper. Steamed the shrimp then added at the end. Definitely will make this again. It's a keeper!

I'm writing this review with a bowl of this sitting on my lap. I only used shrimp and omitted the celery and bell pepper but even so this recipe is delicious! Will definitely be making this again.

So good!  I sometimes add sausage to this one.  Ck gets a little funny tasting as a leftover, so sometimes I just leave it out, but it's so good the first time!

I agree with another review.  5 hours at low is plenty and then the last 15 minutes I added the shrimp and orzo on high.  Very tasty would make it again!

Excellent recipe.  Next time I'll add 1/2 the orzo, though.  It soaked up too much of the sauce and made it slightly drier than I would have liked it.

I added sweet sausage to this recipe and was pretty generous with Texas Pete hot sauce as well to give it a little more kick. It was really easy to make, but like the other reviewer, I left it on low the entire time. It was a huge hit at our Mardi Gras party.
