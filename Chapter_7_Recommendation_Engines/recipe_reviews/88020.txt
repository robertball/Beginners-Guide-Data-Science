This tasted just like lime applesauce. No fizz. Won't be making this again

So happy to find this recipe from long ago (1960's +). I used to make this using a can of applesauce, but now that it comes in a jar only, I didn't know exactly how much to use. I used 7-Up or Sprite, but did not know how much once the sizes changed. We had this at Christmas made in a wreath mold with cherries on top. My family always wanted this when they had sore throats as it was so soothing. So glad to find this oldie still around.

Made this with my 9-year old son (he found the recipe). It was super easy and would be easy to add your favorite jello ingredients to! Both my boys liked it, great recipe!

Just like Christmas at home! My Mom would always make this salad (among other special dishes) to go with our turkey dinner. It can be garnished with dollops of whipped cream cheese and maraschino cherries to dress it up a bit. Yummy!

I did not care for this. Tasted like industrial strength lime jello.
