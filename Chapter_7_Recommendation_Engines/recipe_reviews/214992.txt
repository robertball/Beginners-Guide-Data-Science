Wow this recipe was fantastic!! My husband is hispanic and he said this was the best 'chile verde' he has tasted in years. I took some to work and my co-workers raved about it also. I tweaked it a little. I used pork loin instead of shoulder and I used two 24 oz. jars of La Victoria green chunky salsa (medium). Very delicious. Even better the next day.

I made this for dinner tonight and we LOVED it!  I did make a few changes, but only one to the ingredients - I used a jalapeno pepper in place of the serrano because serranos are too hot for our family.  I mixed all the ingredients together rather than layering them in the crock pot because I wanted all the flavors to mingle around the meat.  I also used 3 lbs of pork chops because I couldn't find a 3 lb roast.  The chops worked great and the flavor was wonderful.  To serve the meat, I made baked chimichangas.  I shredded the meat and mixed it with the solids from the salsa and onions and about 1/2 cup liquid.  I then placed about 1/4 c Monterey Jack cheese on a tortilla, and then covered it with about 3/4 c meat and rolled them up.  I placed them seam side down in a 9x13 baking pan, brushed the top with some butter and baked them in a 425 oven until the tops were tanned.  This meat was perfect for chimichangas and I will definately make this recipe many times!  Thank you for sharing!

This is SO good.  We ate it with tortillas, black beans, and fresh salsa.  The only thing I changed was the peppers.  I used a fresh jalapeno because it's what I had on hand.  I cut it in half and seeded it.  It gave it just enough kick but was not at all hot.  Next time I might add a few more.  Will make this again for sure. Thanks for sharing.

This was so delicious! I put it in the crock pot this morning in about 5 minutes. I served it with tortillas, beans, and all kinds of other sides (e.g. lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, roasted corn). Then we all got to create our own tasty dinner. One of the easiest and tastiest recipes I have ever made!

This was very good. Made it with homemade Green Salsa, another recipe on this site. The leftover freeze well and have been enjoying the leftovers as a quick dinner after work. Served on tortillas taco style.

Wow ...delicious and easy. Upped the heat a little based on other reviews.....2 serranos, 2 Jalapenos and hot green salsa....perfect. Pureed the vegetables and half the cooking liquid for an awesome sauce. Served in Tortillas with refried beans, sour cream and grated cheese, green sauce on top......excellent.

I thought this was a tasty recipe and I'll definitely make it again. Next time, I'll opt for a spicier salsa or more serranos as it came out rather mild, but still tasty.  We ate it with corn tortillas, fresh tomatoes, avocado and cheese, then a second time as quesadillas.

This was a delicious Green Chile Pork recipe. I followed directions pretty closely, as I had all things on hand and didn't need to modify. I was a little worried a few hours after cooking because it just didn't seem like it was going to be flavorful. I waited it out, drained juices (with some reserved of course) and tasted meat...Omgoodness it was so fantastic! Even better second day per my husband!  My only change will next time will be spicing up a bit more, as the serrano chiles weren't that spicy. I will probably follow others suggestions and add a jalapeno along w/ the other peppers

This was great!  Even better the next day.  I added two serranos and two jalape√±os.  I served with pepper jack cheese and sliced avocados on flour tortillas.

I made this yesterday.  It was great.  Here are the tweaks I made:

In our local supermarket, I was able to buy pork shoulder pre-cut into large chunks and packaged in 2-3 lb bunches.  I used a 2 3/4 lb package for the dish.  I highly recommend using shoulder (as stated in the recipe) rather than loin for this dish. I trimmed the rind and seasoned the meat with s&p and also some sazon.  I added about 4 or 5 cloves of garlic which I smashed and broke up and sprinkled over the onions before adding the meat.  I used a medium green salsa and 2 sliced serranos, seeds and all.  I added a small amount of cumin (maybe 1/2 tspn) and about the same amount of chipotle powder. I didn't leave out any of the ingredients listed in the recipe. I cooked on low for 5 hours and the meat fell apart under gentle pressure. I fished the meat out into a bowl and shredded it. Next I poured the liquid and veggie solids through a strainer.  I put 1/2 or 2/3 of the liquid back into crock pot and added the shredded meat.  I then put the veggie solids and remaining liquid into a bowl and pureed with an immersion blender until smooth.  The result was a delicious, thick green sauce.  I served the meat on flour tortillas as soft tacos with shredded cheddar, sour cream and diced tomatoes. I spooned the green sauce on top.  We both loved it.  I plan to make enchiladas this weekend with the leftovers and The Best Red Enchilada Sauce from this site. Next time I will use a "hot" salsa and/or add more chiles.

Discard the liquid?! I pureed it in a blender and poured it back over the meat.  I also added a couple of slices of bacon and some fresh green chilis to the pot  at the start. Yum!

Delicious, but don't throw out the liquid! Add canned crushed tomatoes to the salsa, add chicken bouillon, and you've got machaca! Serve with beans and warm tortillas.

This is a simple and delicious dish.  The only change I made is generously sprinkling cumin over everything before putting the lid on.  Next time, I'll try cutting the roast in half or thirds before cooking so more surface area absorbs the flavors.  Can't wait to use the shredded pork for a green enchilada filling!

I made this tonight for the second time. It's so easy and quite tasty. After we finished eatting, my husband exclaimed, "I know what I'm having for lunch tomorrow." The only change I made was to eliminate the cilantro.

Some of the best meat I have ever had.  This stuff is so good, and I cannot believe how easy it was to make.  The spices and flavors come together so perfectly, and the meat was so tender, it practically shredded itself.  I sampled some this morning after cooking it in the slow cooker all night, and I am anxiously awaiting dinner tonight to have some more.

I made my own salsa verde to use in this recipe, so based on its ingredients, I cut down on the onion and cilantro called for.  Also, the 2 whole chiles sounded intimidating, so I just included a small amount of chopped roasted poblanos instead.  This was really good served on buns.

This was really good on tortillas but there was a lot of extra juice so next time I'll probably add some corn starch or just drain more juice out.  Other than that it was a very easy recipe and tasted good.

Very good.  Used homemade green salsa (fairly easy to do) and served with refried beans, tortillas and cheese.  Only downside is that it smells so good while cooking and you have to wait so long to eat it! :D

Turned out great!  Very easy and very tasty.  Agreed that it needed more kick, added some Jalapeno Salt after I shredded the pork, perfect!

This was by far the EASIEST and TASTIEST slow cooker recipe I have ever found. It took me about 5 minutes to put this together but you would never know it from the flavor. I had to make a few adjustments. The grocery store didn't have a boneless pork shoulder roast so I went with a boneless pork rib roast and since it was only 2 pounds, I reduced the cooking time by about an hour. Also, I thought that serranos might be a bit too spicy, so I added a half a jalapeno with about a quarter of the seeds added. It came out a nice medium spice but when we ate it with cilantro and lime rice in warm tortillas with sour cream and cheese, it lowered the heat even more, so next time I might keep more seeds in. Also, I used Goya brand salsa verde. I spent probably $15 altogether for ingredients and this recipe served easily 6-7 people, so I will DEFINITELY be making this recipe again, thank you so much!

I seasoned pork tenderloins with garlic powder, cumin, black pepper, and just a pinch of salt. Put in crock pot and dumped a jar of medium green salsa. Cooked for 8 hours and it was so delicious. It was flavorful, tangy, and tender. My four boys loved it over rice.

this is great! I used a 3.83lb pork shoulder bone in. 1 1/4 bottles of Medium La Costena green mexican salsa. I added a large white onion, 3 cloves minced garlic, cup of fresh cilantro, and i used 5 serrano chilis seeds in and 2 jalapenos. My husband and I love spicy food and this HOT. I think that the 2 serranos would be spicy enough for anyone who wants it to be i would 2 and then 2 jalapenos. We rarely eat pork, but this is going into the rotation. I might try it with beef next time.

I live in New Mexico, where many people are green chile snobs. Doubled the meat and added garlic salt.I used a big jar of 505 green chile (which my husband was very nervous about as he is not a fan of jars or cans of chile) a container of frozen Bueno green chile, and some fresh sliced chile from  a friends garden.  505 and Bueno are both local brands, but you could probably buy online.  Anyway, this chile made me a star (even my mother-in-law who does amazing things with green chile!) and took a minimal amount of time.  Will make again and again!

I followed this recipe exactly, except for some unintended extra cooking time as I got home from work a bit late.  When I walked in, the house smelled amazing and I couldn't wait to try it.  My husband and I ended up eating so much pork right from the crock pot that we never even made the tacos we had planned.  Oh well!  The pork on its own was fabulous.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks Andy :)

This is one spicy green chile. Easy to make, I did want the vegetables but by the end of the cook time they were like mush.  So I suggest that if you do want the onions and peppers you add them towards the end of the cook time.

We had this for 3 nights because of the quantity, and really enjoyed this.  One night over a cilantro rice pilaf, and mixed it up by making tacos w/ flour tortillas.  We used about 3 lbs pf pork sirloin roast because it was a challenge finding a shoulder less than 4 lbs.  We added some chipotles (2) with adobe sauce, garlic, and quick squeeze of lime. A new permanent in the recipe book indeed.

OK, this was a huge hit for our family!!  A few changes, though...  I know.  Added cumin (about 4 teaspoons), do it to taste.  Added garlic powder, just a little.  Used Safeway Medium Green Salsa (24oz).  Used a 2.5lb pork tenderloin.  After the workday (about 9 hours) in the crockpot on low, I scraped off what bits of cilantro and salsa remained on the pork into the juice.  Transferred the pork and shredded.  Took the juice to a blender and poured over the shredded pork.  Served in warm tortillas with cheese.  So yummy!!!  Try this recipe, it is so easy and is totally versatile to your taste!!  THANKS ANDY!!!!

I used this a filling for soft tortillas and everyone topped their own.  It was a great change of pace.  My only negative was my husband thought it was chicken until after the meal, but that's a crockpot thing.

We liked this a lot.  However, we used a 4.5 lb pork shoulder, so  I pretty much doubled the rest of the ingredients.  8 hours in the crock pot was just fine.  Definitely taste for spice, however.  I thought it was a little bland, so I added some cumin and more salt and pepper during the last hour.  I also halved the peppers before adding them to the pot and they definitely added some kick!

Like other reviewers said, this isn't spicy but it was easy and good.  I added chili powder and cumin on the pork before putting in the crock pot.  I also added crushed fresh garlic and some diced, canned green chile's

Next time I will add jalapenos, too, to make it spicier.  I also blended the liquids and added this "sauce" to the pork tacos along with guac and pico.  I used leftover sauce and pork for enchiladas the next day, very good.

My pork shoulder was just over 4 pounds and it was done after 7 hours on low...couldn't wait last hour!

This was very easy to prepare and turned out great. I did use 3 serrano chile peppers, because we do like it spicy. I served it with homemade corn tortillas and guacamole. This recipe is a keeper.

Not wild about this recipe. The green salsa didn't impart much flavor. While the pork was nice and moist, and shredded easily for tacos, it simply didn't have any depth of flavor.

I assumed the serrano peppers were canned, and all that were on the shelf were the pickled kind, so that's what I used. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, instead of pork. When I was able to shred the chicken easily, then I added the cilantro plus 1 sliced onion and 2 sliced bell peppers. Stirred it all together, let it cook for another hour, until the vegetables were soft. Used it in an enchilada casserole.

Awesome. I cut the onion into large chunks so I could easily take them out after cooking as hubby wouldn't be thrilled if he found onions in his dinner. :D I seasoned the roast with garlic powder and black pepper but skipped the salt because the sodium content of the green salsa I had was outrageous anyway. Served in whole wheat tortillas with shredded cabbage, diced tomatoes, avocado, and more cilantro. Yum. Thanks :)

This recipe was absolutely FANTASTIC!!! In addition to the onion at the bottom of the pot, I added 2 tomatillos, and also used a green tomatillo salsa. Aside from the flavoring, I also really enjoyed that it wasn't super spicy. On a scale of 1-5, 5 being the spiciest, I would consider this to be a 2 or 3. Next time I may add an extra pepper or two! Overall, GREAT recipe...my husband and I will be making this frequently!

I've made this twice, both without additional peppers. Once I made it with super hot salsa, and once with very mild salsa. Both got rave reviews from large groups of people. Thanks Andy!

I used a chuck roast (pot roast) because my husband doesn't like pork and it was wonderful. We shredded it  and made soft tacos out of it. Great recipe. Thank you

I made this with a large Pork Shoulder (7lbs) and doubled up on everything except the onion. I also added cumin and garlic as others suggested. This had a great flavor but was a little greasy, probably because I used such a large pork shoulder. I will make this again but use a smaller roast, trim all the fat, and cube up the meat before putting in the crokpot. I expect that the results will then be fantastic.

Wonderful flavor!  I did use jalapenos instead of serrano peppers because I was concerned about it being too much heat.  It turned out perfect for our tastes.

I used La Victoria salsa and I thought it was pretty good. I also used canned green chiles because I couldn‚Äôt find serrano chile peppers. It wasn't spicy enough for us, but I'm sure this is due to the chiles, but it was still delicious. I used a pork tenderloin and it melted in my mouth. Seriously delicious recipe...thanks for sharing Andy!

Spicy and yet still flavourful... this from a gal who doesn't usually like pork. This recipe is going into my regular rotation! :)  Couldn't find Frontera's so I used Mrs. Renfro's green salsa.

Very good.  I substituted chicken breasts and thighs for the pork and it was great.  Also added garlic, which never hurts IMHO.  I liked how the recipe has you remove some of the sauce to make it a really good consistency.

Exceptionally easy and super good.  Made a peach salsa and guacamole, whose recipes were also found on this site, to go along with the pork.  Served it with hot corn tortillas and it was just amazing.  Roommates had no issues with cleaning up the leftovers over the next few days.

This recipe is simple but full of flavor. I wasn't sure whether to chop the serranos or not, so I put them in whole and they flavored the meat well. Plus it was easy to pick them out at the end. I like lots of sauce, so I didn't discard any of it. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and blended all the liquid, along with the onions, cilantro, and some of the peppers, with a blender. I then returned it to the crockpot with the lid off to reduce it down a bit and make it thicker.

Super easy way to make a Mexican dinner. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, six of them, because I had them on hand, but next time I will use a pork butt roast. The salsa verde was Giant Eagle store brand, and I skipped the serrano chili's to avoid too much heat, but I added 1 tsp. each of cumin and chili powder. I was going to add the chopped fresh cilantro at the very end before serving, but instead, I made cilantro-lime rice to serve with the meat in flour tortillas. It was delicious! We also had many toppings like lettuce, salsa, black olives, but the flavor is so good we preferred it served alone with the rice. Great recipe!

Great easy and delicious recipe. I didn't have any cilantro or green salsa on hand so I added some water downed homemade green chile I had along with some hot la Victoria salsa. Since I didn't have serranos, I added two jalape√±os instead. It was wonderful and the juice I've blended & froze for future use on rice, potatoes, anything!

I wonder if something went wrong. I followed recipe, cooked it on low, but this came out totally mushy! Like cat food or canned tuna.  Even with slicing both serrano peppers, it wasn't spicy.  I'd consider using same ingredients but roasting it in oven to better preserve the texture of the meat. Either everyone here likes mushy food, mine went wrong, or I'm very particular about meat texture.

A family favorite!  My kids beg for it and are always super excited for green chile pork night.  We use 2 serranos and 2 jalapenos to give it more kick and we slice them in half (leaving the seeds) before putting in the crockpot to make sure that flavor comes out in the sauce.  We shred the meat and make tacos with a little cheese and some of that wonderful sauce on top.

This recipe was great!  We had it for a Cinco de Mayo Party and everyone raved about the pork.  We kicked up the spice a bit with some chili peppers and added some jalapeno peppers.  That was the only change we made though.

This is delicious! I did sub the two serrano peppers with 1 large jalapeno since I wanted my 4 year old to eat this as well. It was very mild that way with a nice warmth to it. The day I made this I served it in taco shells with black beans and corn. I used the leftovers to make enchiladas. This is delicious and I can't wait to make it again.

Terrific recipe - I used a pork loin (on sale) and followed the instructions except slow cooked it for 5 1/2 hrs.  Used my immersion blender and blended all the juice and herbs and am using this as sauce  on the meat, on fried eggs and anything I can think of - JUST GREAT - thanks much.

Delicious! I used pickled jalapenos instead of serrano because that is what I had on hand. Really great flavor, still. I served these on a toasted corn tortilla with black beans, homemade guacamole, and fresh cilantro. My husband LOVED them and said they were restaurant quality. Oh yeah, and did I mention how easy this recipe is? I will be making this again.

I loved this!  I put it together like it was written except I forgot to throw in the peppers.  Thought there was going to be too much cilantro but I was pleasantly surprised.  Super easy with great results!  I took some of the fat I skimmed from the juices in the pot, mixed with a little flour and made a gravy with some of the pot liquid.  I toasted some kaiser rolls, put on the pork and added some gravy.  Reminded me of dressed po-boy I used to get in Biloxi as a kid. It was great!  Well, at least my family liked it!  Tomorrow, I'm going to make quesadillas with it like I read in another review.  This is so versatile and it's definitely a winner in my book.  We'll be seeing this on the table again.

I fell in love with this recipe the first time I tried it.  I started with the original recipe and it turned out fantastic.  I wanted a little more spice so the second time around I used twice the salsa and added both jalepno and serrano peppers (and lots of them!).  Always turns out fabulous no matter what.  Eat with fresh flour tortillas, avocado, tomatoes, and maybe a sprinkle of cheese.  Heaven.

Made a fatal error in leaving out the cilantro. Will try again. Didn't have enough spice/flavor for me.

This was so delicious! I threw everything in the crock pot as directed and let it cook all day. It was so tender and juicy by the time I got home from work. As another reviewer suggested I took the vegetables and a little extra green salsa I had and pureed everything in my food processor. Wrapped the pork in tortillas with some cheese and green sauce on top, one of the best meals I've ever prepared. Will definitely make again :)

Easy and delicious.  I used 1 serrano because I have kids and they don't like spicy food.  It still had a little kick to it, though.  Very good.  I'll definitely make this again.  Very good with corn tortillas and guacamole.

This was very good! I used two serrano peppers and two jalapeno peppers. Once the meat was done I took the sauce, peppers and onions blended it up for an awesome topping sauce!

so easy and tasty.  used a different roasting cut, as my store did not have shoulder.  also cooked for 10 hours, as other readers stated.  served with avocado, cilantro, sour cream, more green salsa in flour tortillas....and also added a little course salt.  yum.

This recipe was fabulous! My shoulder roast was more like 3-4lbs, but the proportions with the sauce turned out fine.  I couldn't find fresh cilantro anywhere, so I used dried; I wanted the seeds and juice of the serrano peppers to mingle with the salsa, but I did not want bites of serrano peppers in my meal, so I just cut the peppers in thirds before I dropped them in and fished them out when done cooking.  I kept some sauce with the shredded pork, but instead of discarding the rest, I poured it over rice and beans for a side to the meal. Just delicious.

I just did this over the weekend and it was a huge hit!  We had leftovers for a few days - think nachos, quesadillas, on and on.  The only tweek I did is add more liquid with fresh salsa since my pork was a bit bigger then 2.5 pounds.  The only recommendation that I have is more spice!  I like my meat to be hot, so I would add jalapeno's next time instead of the serrano chile peppers.  Bravo Andy this is delicious and will now be a staple in my crock pot recipe book!

DEFINITELY GREAT RECIPE. I MADE MY OWN CHILE VERDE SAUCE AND ADDED GARLIC CLOVES W/ ONIONS AND EXTRA CHILES SERRANOS AND JALAPENOS.  SERVED IT WITH WARM TORTILLAS AND ALL THE MEXICAN FIXINGS. FAMILY LOVED IT!

made very good tacos. Some of the spiciness cooked out, so next time I'll add the fresh serrano or jalapeno peppers.  I also omitted the cilantro.

This pork is so delicious! Followed the recipe exactly and was so amazed at how savory (and not too spicy) this turned out. Had tacos with the pork the first night and made enchiladas with the second night with the leftover pork. Wonderful!

It doesn't get easier or more tasty than this.   I would probably add a few peeled cloves of garlic to the pot, but that's just my preference.  This recipe is great "as is".  Thanks Andy.  The guys are going to love this recipe for their hunting trips.  I'm going to love at home.

DELICIOUS! This recipe has a lot of flavor for being so easy. It is a family favorite. Sometimes we substitute beef or chicken and it tastes just as good. I've made it without the chille peppers for guests who can't take the heat and it's still yummy.

This is absolutely FABULOUS!! I just changed it a wee bit.  I added about 3/4 cup water, 2 chicken bullion cubes and instead of regular green salsa I used Salsa Verde fron The World Table and 1 serrono pepper, and OMG, this was truly a wonderful recipe!  It was juicy, subtle warm spicey flavor and it was great the second and third day!  Heartily recommend for flavor and versatility of this recipe. :)

This is exceptional!  We use green enchilada sauce and leave out the cilantro because I do not care for the herb.  We also serve it over mashed potatoes for a hearty meal in the winter.

Really love this recipe. Have made this with pork and with chicken, and is delicious both ways. My family loved it,and they love spicy so I used 4 jalape√±os and 4 Serrano instead of just 2,  along with hot green salsa. Put on warm corn tortillas, and was amazing .

This recipe is awesome! The only thing I did different was I diced the onions, and cut the pork into one inch cubes. I mixed the cilantro in to and did not add the chiles because my family is whimpy. I used 2 jars LaVictoria green salsa and it was super! The left overs were even better the next day. This is a new family favorite that I will make again and again. Thank you!

So easy, so good! My husband isn't usually enthusiastic in praising food, but he really went out of his way to say how much he enjoyed this. We got 6 burritos and 2 omelets out of this amount and still have a little bit left over.

Made this last night, great and not too spicy. Even my picky 8 yr old loved it. Followed recipe except i used a can of green chilis instead of the peppers. Thanks for the recipe! Going to keep this in the rotation.

I have received this recipe in my inbox a few days ago and it happened to be my grocery shopping day so I decided to give it a whirl:-)
WOW, I am so glad that I did................it is positively FANTASTIC. The smallest pork shoulder that I was able to find that day was 5 pounds so I doubled everything with the exception of the peppers (used 3). I threw this together yesterday and remember thinking that since I doubled everything, I sure hoped that it would be good. It is beyond good, it is AMAZING!!!!!! Hubby and I both like a lot of heat but since the grandson was over, I decided to go "moderate". Will make again and again and again:-) This WILL get hauled to our next potluck at the office and boy, will I be the star for the day:-)
Minimal effort and exceptional results:-) ;-) ;-)
Thank you, Andy!

I really enjoyed this one for its simplicity. It's quite mild so I like to kick it up a notch by adding a paste of dried dark hot chillies such as pasilla, chipotle and/or ancho etc. and some water at the same time as the salsa. I also to like to make the bed of onions but I personally like to add more heat again with some chopped hatch chillies (wide hot green peppers) on top. It's doesn't add much more heat but lots of flavour. This is a great base recipe for many variations to suit your palate.

Made with loin chops (thawed and needed to use), Herdez salsa verde, and a poblano pepper.  My final dish was very good but not five star most likely because I didn't use the right cut of pork...and over-cooked...so I am rating five star and do plan to use the recipe again and follow the directions!!

The meat was flavorless and the sauce wasn't that good, which is surprising since I used my favorite green salsa.

Definitely needed more than 8 hours on low on my slow cooker.  Good flavor though.

This was terrific.  I did, however, add some ingredients that we like for a fuller flavor.  I added cumin, hot chili powder and a little garlic.  The result was fabulous.  The family was groaning as they ate it served on flour tortillas.  The second round of the leftovers was made into enchiladas with white queso and pepper jack cheese sprinkled on top.  Muy bueno!

This came out GREAT!  Made my own refried beans and added this to the green chile pork.  Made burritos with cheese with this and froze them for the kids/husband to grab as a quick lunch.  I made sure to cook out all the juices before using in burrito.

Love this recipe. I made it twice for company and every enjoyed it. It's so easy to put in the slow cooker and have ready when guests arrive. The first time I made it as written, but it wasn't spicy enough. The second time I added jalepenos and sliced half of the peppers so the flavor would absorb into the meat better. I served the cooked betters on the side for those who like extra spice. I also didn't like the fattiness of the shoulder the first time, so I made it with tenderloin the second time. Great as filling for tacos or burrito bowls. The leftovers freeze well, so I doubled the recipe (using tenderloin) and had leftovers for several future meals.

Thought this was delicious and easy. I stuffed the meat with sliced cloves of garlic and did not strain the sauce. Instead I used the immersion blender and that thickened up the sauce and kept all the good flavors. Will definitely make this again.

This was very good...I used jalapenos because the crowd I was cooking for can't handle spice, so I just halved and seeded them and threw them in.  There were no leftovers, even my brother raved about this one :)

This pork made the BEST tacos I have ever made at home.  I substituted 2 Jalapenos for the serrano chilis because that's what I had.  The only other change I made was to add 2 bell peppers about halfway through cooking, mainly because I wanted peppers with my tacos and didn't want to cook them separately!  Served with black beans, corn, and fresh salsa (from another recipe on this site), delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly except for I cut the two serranos in half before throwing in hoping to get a little more spice out of them.  This came out perfectly moist and full of flavor!  We made soft tacos with them on night one, adding a little cheese, avacado, and sour cream.  No sauce needed as we didn't want to take anything away from the flavor of the meat!  This will definitley be another go-to slow cooker meal for my husband and I.  Loved it!

Wow! I was pleasantly surprised at how easy and how delicious this was!!! I cooked a 3lb pork shoulder on high for 3 1/2 hours and used Herdez green salsa. Thank you!! Chili Verde is one of my favorite dishes to order and now I can make it at home :)

this was so simple and so tasty! I also seasoned my pork with garlic powder and cumin in addition to the s&p before putting in the crock. made tacos with it the first night and then empanadas a few nights later. great to freeze and have on hand for quick week night dishes.

Thanks for the great recipe! I accidentally got enchilada sauce instead of green salsa and it still turned out great. I got major points from my boyfriend for this dish.

This pork falls off the bone and is very tender and delicious.  I used Ortega's green taco sauce, since that is the closest thing to green salsa that they had at our grocery store.  I think that the flavor was a little bit bland because of it.  Next time I would look harder for the green salsa, add extra peppers and more salt.  Overall, this recipe is worth trying again.

The dish was very tasty and flavorful.  I will definitely make it again in the near future.  The changes I made are the following:  1. I used home-made green salsa that I prepared following the recipe from this site.  Knowing I will do more stewing, I didn't puree it.  I just added meat directly in it after the sauce was ready. 2.  I used pork loin instead of pork shoulder to reduce fat. 3.  I cooked on a stove top in a heavy sauce pan for less than 2 hours.   4.  I didn't add any additional chiles, as the salsa was very hot already.   5.  I service the meat with lots of sauce on top of steamed rice.  The sauce was so good, I didn't want to waste it.  I even added bottled green salsa (Arriba! brand, with great fire-roasted flavor)   Next time around, I will probably not make green salsa separately -  I will brown the meat first, and add chopped chiles, tomatillos, onions along with water, just to make a stew.  I also like to try this with other kinds of meat and maybe fish, too.    Thank you for sharing this!

It would be better shredded and mixed with fresh cilantro and salsa than just the cooked stuff.  Good served with warm corn tortillas and a wedge of lime.

This was AWESOME!   I didn't have any serrano chile peppers so I threw in some jalapeno peppers I had in the fridge, otherwise I did exactly what the recipe called for! Fantastic!  It was a family favorite, so flavorful with only a few ingredients...thanks for a wonderful recipe!

My boyfriend & I love spicy foods and I was excited to make this but thought it was somewhat bland.  I even added an extra Serrano and still thought it needed more of something.  I couldn‚Äôt find Frontera salsa so I substituted La Victoria, maybe better with a different salsa.  I might try again if I can find a spicier green salsa.

This recipe is awesome and unbelievably easy. I'm from Albuquerque so I always make lots of Mex, Tex-mex, and New Mex and this recipe seems like home. I used this with soft taco corn tortillas and then used the leftovers for huevos rancheros the next morning (instead of beans). DELICIOUS!

This is through the roof good! I tried this, made it exactly the way the recipe said, and we loved it so much that I miss eating it when I am not eating it. So simple, and so good. The leftovers freeze well too!

So delicious, with so much flavor!  My husband was in heaven, and ate it three meals in a row.  I omitted the cilantro, (as he hates it--tastes like soap to him), but added some garlic.  YUM!

Fantastic base recipe. Lots of room for personalization. I used a 4 pound picnic, de-boned, and 1 jar of salsa was perfect.

This was delicious! I didn't have cilantro so I didn't use it, but it was still great! I used pickled jalepenos instead of serano, and I just shredded the pork in the liquid mixture in the crockpot and just used a slotted spoon when serving. It was really moist and flavorful!

I‚Äôve made this a couple of times. It‚Äôs amazingly good! The tomatillos from the green salsa really crank up the flavor of the pork. It‚Äôs a really good, easy meal to make.

Have made this countless times and it is always a favorite. My kids request it for holiday dinners! My husband thinks I am a "chef" . My friends and extended family request it.  And this is the easiest thing to prepare. You should try. It can be adjusted to your taste so easily and requires little to no "talent". Thanks for a really great recipe that we enjoy again and again.

My sister-in-law shared this recipe with me and we absolutely love it. Husband works nights, so if eating that day; like today, I sear the pork shoulder with the s&p with a touch of vegetable oil. Cook on high  for four hours and have it all ready for dinner by early mid afternoon.  It's cruel to smell it cooking and not get to eat it that day...lol. Making 4.5lbs. roast today, some for now, some for later! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

Very tasty! Was quite easy to prepare. I used the finished product to fill large flour tortillas, along with shredded mozzarella, making very large enchiladas. I scattered more cheese across the rolled enchiladas, added some verde enchilada sauce and drizzled heavy cream over them, baking them at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes. They were absolutely delicious!

Great flavor, we really enjoyed this.  I added a chopped jalapeno including seeds and used La Victoria medium salsa but will use their hot next time or a different brand because we like things spicy.  Will definitely make this again, thanks for sharing!

Original recipe is good and I made these additions...
wrapped cilantro stems (used no leaves) in cheese cloth tied with twine to be able to retrieve easily. Added a bay leaf, two tsp. of oregano, and 1/2 tsp cumin. Additions kicked the original recipe a notch. Very tasty...

We absolutely love this, and I have made it multiple times.  However, after making it exactly according to the recipe the first time, I did change it for future recipes.  I very generously add my normal spice mix that I use when cooking pork for tacos, and I also use 2 jars of salsa verde, 2-3 onions, and 4-5 peppers.  I do NOT add cilantro until at the end because I like the freshness it gives to the dish before serving.  I bake it in the oven slow and low as well because I think that it browns much better and you have that delicious goodness as another dimension of flavor.  I also use the juice of two limes and I do not discard the cooked peppers and onions.  I have made this for several potlucks and even served it at our church's anniversary services.  It was a huge hit!

Super good. Super easy. Awesome in tacos with radish slices, crumbled cotija cheese, and extra cilantro. Tip: Add a squeeze of fresh lime juice right before serving to brighten the flavor.

This turned out so good.  The only changes I made was I used part of a pork loin as that's what I had on hand.  I also added a few Anaheim Peppers at the end for even more flavor.  I made Pico De Gallo to go with the meat in the flour tortillas. I will for sure make this again.

Very tasty & quick to throw together in the crock pot.  Based on other reviews, I doubled the serrano peppers.  It wasn't too spicy, but had a kick.  I'd love to try making my own salsa next time, but the jar of salsa was convenient and worked fine.

Great recipe, Andy! We used the meat to make tamales (our 1st time) and it was delicious! I used 2 whole serranos and 2 whole jalapenos. After removing meat I pureed the liquid, including the peppers.  Used it to moisten the meat as well as serve over the top of the tamales. Muy Bueno! I like it hot so next time I might throw in a habanero. Ole!

Super easy and tasty! Two year old and picky husband couldn't get enough. Not spicy at all but wonderful flavor as written.

Loved this! Layered pork steaks and ground pork with ingredients ( cooked in half the time). Served mixed with brown rice, avocado chunks, and black beans . What flavor the pork added! Thank you! And my teenagers loved it as well!!

Don't drain the juice!  It makes a great bowl of chile verde with warm tortillas or some good French bread!  So easy and moist !

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I will have a good pic posted of mine shortly. The only difference I made, was I put inside ingredients like; sour cream tomatoes and cheese on the outside of the dish for the picky  eater. Shelene

Nice recipe. Pork was just the right amount of hot with 3 jalape√±os added to the slow-cooker. Meat was moist and delicious. Definitely will make again.

As written it is a great idea but needed a bit more--I added some fresh tomatillos and cubed chayote squash and it was amazing garnished with some cubed tomatoes and avocado. (Note: I used pork loin and it was still excellent and tender).

Very yummy. And easy.  What more could you ask for?
I've cooked this a few times now, and these are the changes I've made. I cut the meat into large chunks and brown it first.  Then I brown the  onions with some chopped garlic.  I cook in my digital pressure cooker with the meat on the bottom, and the salsa and onion on top.  I add 1.5 cups of chicken broth(to ensure I have enough liquid in the pressure cooker).  I serve the cilantro on the side, as some of my family don't like it, and skip the pepper.
In October I modified it further for a chili cook-off.  I added a 1.5 cups of soaked white beans (and some salt, though I can't say how much), thickened the broth with cornstarch at the end, and added some sour cream.

DELISH! I put in even more spicy peppers as we like it hot. We eat it with taco sides in a soft yellow taco tortilla.

I doubled everything but the meat, used hot green salsa, and added cumin and garlic. I pureed everything but the meat to use as the sauce.  It's pretty good.  The sauce is thick enough and has a little kick to it.  The meat is pretty bland without the sauce, but I have the sauce so all is well.  I ate on a flour tortilla with sour cream.

Easy and delicious! Wrapped the pork in a tortilla with refried beans. Topped with the green sauce from the slow cooker, a dollop of sour cream, and a black olive to top it off. Doesn't get any better than this.

This was SOOOOO good!  My guys loved it.  I cooked it just as stated except I used Jalapenos instead of serrano chilies. After we had our fill on flour tortillas, I froze the rest and took it to my parents for a weekend visit. Everyone loved it!!

Andy I love you...This was so easy and tasted amazing! I used 4 Serrano chilies because I like it spicy. I used some of the juice to add to some cooked white rice as an awesome side dish as well. I am always looking for good slow cooker recipes and this is a keeper.This will be one I will use over and over, thank you!

Was really excellent and smelled SO GOOD in the cooker.  I bought Medium green salsa.  Next time I will either do Medium again, and forgo the extra hot peppers, or just get mild salsa and add the hot peppers.  The peppers and the Medium took this recipe to a whole nother HOT level!

Absolutely fantastic!!!  And very, very easy to put in the slow cooker in the morning before work.  I will say, though, it tastes even better the next day when it's marinated in all the juices.  Again, absolutely fantastic!!!

This was pretty good but not spicy enough for my taste.  I added 3 serrano peppers to the slow cooker, then removed them after cooking for 10 hrs.  I think if I ever make this again, I will for sure add chopped jalapenos or serranos.
