We use the bacon grease w/ the olive (or coconut oil we had on hand) and then saute brussels sprouts. Very good & will make again.

Just a short note from the author that in my original submission there was no olive oil.  Just use a small amount of the bacon grease and also add salt and pepper to taste.
Thanks for trying it!

This did turn out pretty tasty, although I did change it up a bit. I halved the bacon, and I just used the bacon grease instead of the olive oil. I also added a clove of garlic....Honestly, I can't cook without it :)

I enjoy this recipe, however... I ended up making a few changes to make it spectacular.

The second time around I used a pat of butter, chicken broth and a clove of garlic minced.  

Even people that don't like Brussel sprouts loved it.  Caramelizing the brussel sprouts changes the flavor slightly.  

Yum!

This was delicious! My family didn't think they liked brussel sprouts, but these were a hit at Christmas Eve dinner.  I did make one addition to the recipe.  I added a bit of brown sugar to them.  I knew the kids would like them better that way and they were very good.  I didn't use a lot, just a bit for a subtle sweetness. Thanks for a great recipe that I will make again and again!

Any vegetable cooked  with bacon already has great potential in my book.  I used fresh Brussels sprouts, added minced garlic, and cooked them only until crisp-tender, not browned. Loved the flavor as well as the vibrant color.

We're big brussel sprout eaters and this was a nice change. Added a few seasonings, but used fresh sprouts which I steamed first. Delicious and thank you!

We absolutely loved this recipe for brussels. Did not change a thing and everyone said they did not like brussels but they all wanted the recipe for them before leaving the house. Thank you for sharing with us.

I love sprouts in general, but stir fried is a favorite in our house.  This was a tasty recipe.  Rather than cook the sprouts before hand, I added them raw to the bacon and added a little chicken stock.  Turned out great.

Yum! I am the only one that really enjoys brussel sprouts but everyone tried these and said they would eat them again. I loved them! I used fresh sprouts and just steamed them for a few minutes before putting them in the pan. I skipped the olive oil and just used a small amount of the bacon drippings. I also added salt and pepper to taste and cooked these until they were nicely caramelized. Delicious. Thanks for sharing!

I thought these were a very tasty way of serving brussel sprouts.  Who doesn't like bacon in anything?  I used fresh sprouts. They usually come in a 10 oz. tub.  I used 2 shallots (plenty) and 4 pieces of bacon.  I boiled the sprouts before putting in the pan of bacon grease (no I did not use a second pan with olive oil).  It was enough for four servings.

I think these are delicious. I have made them 2 times in the past month. I have used fresh and frozen brussels and I definitely like the texture from the fresh. They tend to hold their cruch and form better than the frozen. Definitely a keeper.

We like brussel sprouts but like to do new things with them. Never had them with bacon and we loved it! I did parboil them before adding them to the fry pan. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe!! I grew up hating brussel sprouts until now.  I used fresh Brussels, cut the bacon up and put all in a baking dish, sprinkled it with some balsamic vinegar and baked it in the oven on 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes. Yum!!

These are so good! If I am lazy I chop the bacon before cooking and when the bacon is almost done I throw in the shallots (or onion) until tender and then add the brussels. I do not drain the bacon grease. Sometimes I serve the brussels with shredded parm and drizzled balsamic vinegar. YUM! Great recipe!

i really liked these but my husband did not...he thought the smoky flavor of the bacon overpowered the sprouts;  for me that was the best part!  so to each his own, i guess!

Delicious way to prepare Brussels sprouts! I love them roasted, but never had them with bacon so I had to give this a try, it's wonderful! I didn't use the olive oil, instead used the bacon drippings. I also added a little salt & pepper at the end. Thanks for sharing this easy dish! :)

I've been looking new vegetables to add in my rotation.  These were pretty good.  I skipped the olive oil and used just a dash of the bacon grease.  I also used regular onion and I added a clove of minced garlic.  This was a very good cooking method; the brussels turned out soft, flavorful, and not bitter at all.  I think next time I may totally skip the bacon and see how that turns out.

This was SOOOOO good! I used 8 slices of bacon instead, and also used 1 red onion instead. Also, I used the tiny frozen brussels- found that they have a bit of extra sweetness and tenderness which balanced out well with the bacon and onion. This has become a favorite side dish of my family... and now my daughters will finally eat brussel sprouts. Kudos!!!!

This is the recipe that turns brussel sprout haters into believers!  I have made these for years but I would use fresh brussel sprouts (and not huge ones either) and boil for 10 minutes and then fry in unsalted butter.  This is for those not afraid of the extra calories.  Not as healthy but I have to tell you, the butter makes them sooo smoothe and yummy. When I've had a large dinner to prepare, I would also skip the boil/steam and put them in the oven for about 40 minutes.  Cover them with foil for the first half of cooking time so they don't burn.. Enjoy!

I'd never had brussel sprouts in my life, and this seemed like a good way to start. I followed many of the comments: steamed fresh brussel sprouts for about five minutes, then let them cool and cut them in half. I cooked the bacon, then sauteed fresh garlic and shallots in the bacon grease. They burned almost immediately, so I threw them out and started over in the remaining grease before adding the brussel sprouts and bacon back in. I cooked them longer than 7 - 10 minutes, though. I'll try it again, but I think I'll cook them a bit longer at a lower temperature, so I get more of the bacon flavor.

Frozen Brussels sprouts need a little help and this is a quick and tasty way to do it.  I followed the recipe's author's suggestion and just used the bacon fat instead of adding olive oil.  Just be careful not to neglect them if you've got several things going at once...there's a fine line between browned and burnt!

The absolute best way to eat Brussel sprouts.  I cook the bacon until nice and crisp and then saute the Brussel sprouts in butter.  When the Brussel sprouts are done I add the crumbled bacon.  The caramelized sprouts and the crunch of the bacon is an awesome combination.  No onions for me because I'm allergic.  :(

I've made this many times and love it! Only serious change I make is that this recipe only serves TWO as a main course. Add some nice crusty bread, and you have a delicious dinner. Also, sometimes I add a clove of minced garlic with the Brussels sprouts, for another twist on flavor. Yummy!

I use fresh brussel sprouts, steamed first and then sauteed with everything else.  My kids normally turn their noses up at brussel sprouts, but they really do like them prepared this way.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  We liked them.  I wouldn't say they were my all time fav but I did like them and would probably make them again but I felt that they need something.  I just need to figure out what they needed.

Thank you for making me like brussel sprouts!  This is one vegetable that I have disliked most of my life, but this dish was fabulous.  I will definitely be making it again...possibly trying it next summer with fresh sprouts.

Easy to prepare and good. My 'other half' immediately said, "You know I don't eat brussel sprouts" and then I told him to try these and he then said "Give me some more...what did you do to them" LOL.  So that says it all. These are a keeper. Even my daughter loved them, another person who sweared she didn't like brussel sprouts. 
I did modify the recipe a bit. I didn't have shallots, so used minced garlic instead. After cooking the brussel sprouts with the bacon I sprinkled feta cheese on top and baked for about 10 more minutes. Yum.

We deglazed (with the olive oil and a little water) the same skillet we fried the bacon in and it turned out great! It was Christmas day and we had no shallots so instead we used a little onion salt. Everyone thought it was very tasty. Maybe I'll use shallots and a little balsamic vinaigrette next time.

I baked bacon in the oven removed it and chopped it up. Then used some of the bacon fat to roast the Brussels sprouts and combined them. To finish off the dish, I spiced up pecans with rosemary, maple syrup, cayenne pepper and salt and roasted those to add to the sprouts/bacon combination and returned it all to the oven to heat. The pecans on their own make a great nibbler.

I am now a confirmed brussel sprout lover after I tried this recipe. A friend mentioned that she and her husband love them this way but with one small change. The preparation is exactly the same but I added a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and a pat of butter at the end and we could have eaten twice as many! They remind me of my childhood spinach, bacon and vinegar that my mom always served. We will be having this again and again!

I used fresh brussels sprouts and steamed them in the microwave for about 2 mins.  I left the brussels sprouts whole because they were small, omitted the oil, removed some of the bacon grease, and just browned the sprouts quickly in the bacon drippings and shallots.  Great recipe, quick and very tasty.

Would make this again. This was the first recipe from this site I tried on my campaign to increase vegetable intake. My partner and I added potatoes and meat as a sort of casserole dish. It was a good framework and seems very adaptable, so I'd suggest it if you're not sure this exact recipe is what you want.

So good! I added a few cloves of garlic and squeezed a full fresh lemon on the whole batch  right before serving. My husband absolutely raved about them!

Very good!  I made a couple of changes. I used a regular onion because my grocery store didn't have shallots, added butter with the olive oil and instead of cooking bacon just used real bacon bits. Other than that and enjoying a beer while cooking ??, I stuck to the receipe. My fiance said that I'm now in charge of cooking brussel sprouts.

These were so tasty and easy to make (and I'm not a huge Brussels sprouts fan!) Like other commenters, I used bacon fat, and threw in some minced garlic. I'm making them again tonight with pork chops and apple/onion stuffing to celebrate our first day of fall-like weather!

These are so easy and taste so good! They are a great side to a weeknight family dinner or an elegant dinner party! I especially love the leaves that fall off and get crispy....yum!

Very good recipe,  it makes a great thin and crispy pizza base.  I made it exactly to the recipe and we were very pleased with the outcome.   I am having chemo therapy at the moment and my tastes have changed a lot, so I am looking for strongly flavoured recipes.  Pizza is perfect, but I find the yeast bases too thick and doughy.  This recipe is ideal.

This is an excellent recipe for brussel sprouts and works well with prosciutto.

Made this, didn't have olive oil so I just cooked the Brussels sprouts in the bacon grease, added balsamic vinegar. The balsamic vinegar made the dish much more flavorable, high recommend adding it!
