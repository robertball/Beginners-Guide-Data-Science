These were pretty good! Couple of things to note: You will not need the juice of 2 lemons for the glaze. Zest both of the lemons and use the zest in the batter, but don't even cut into the 2nd lemon (save it to use in something else). I only juiced 1/2 of a lemon, and didn't even need it all. Step 4 should state to add the lemon juice 1 tsp. at a time until the desired consistency to drizzle is achieved. I would also add to fill the paper cups 2/3 full. I filled mine more like 3/4 full, and it was a tad too much in my opinion. I also got 15 muffins filling them 3/4 full. My paper liners stuck a little bit, so next time I might just skip the paper liners and just put the batter right in the muffin tin (sprayed with BakeEasy® or Pam®).

These were ok. I made the glaze differently and thought it was the best part. I made a simple lemon syrup by heating 1/4 cup regular sugar and 1/4 cup lemon juice in a small pan until the sugar dissolved and it became very syrupy. Then let it cool just a few minutes to become thicker (not so drippy) and brushed it on the warm muffins with a pastry brush. There was a beautiful sheen that wasn't clouded by all that confectioners sugar.

This was great!! I did make some changes though. My family doesn't eat sugar so I substituted the sugar for fructose (you can find conversions of sugar to fructose online). My finding any buttermilk, I just put in whole milk and then added some lemon juice to that (about 2 tsp) I also added a lot of lemon juice to the batter. Just go by taste! I only cooked them for 10-15 minutes. For the glaze I didn't have powdered sugar, so I made some out of cornstarch and fructose, and then added the lemon juice. You can combine those 3 together instead of doing powdered sugar. I would definently recommend MORE LEMON! They were sort of bland, so Just dump it in to the glaze and the batter :)

I have made this as stated, the only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is the icing portion. You need to add your juice slowly, and you will not end up using all of it. 
I have also altered it to fit health wants of my house hold. 
I subbed 1 3/4 cup flour with 1 cup gluten free all purpose flour. and 3/4 almond meal. 
sour cream with yogurt. 
veg. oil for coconut oil (melted and decrease by a Tablespoon) 
and white sugar with coconut sugar. 
Using these substitutions is packed in more protein and lowed the glycemic index. they came out slightly dense, but still as delicious!   next time I will add a couple minutes on the bake time. Saving this recipe for making it again, Thanks!

These were perfect, I didn't have sour cream so I did plain greek yogurt. I also did a little more lemon zest than what it called for. Other than that I followed the recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

These muffins are super moist. My family loved them, even my most particular son snatched one and came back for a second.  I made extra glaze, and the family went bonkers soaking them in it and making them disappear before these muffins even had a chance to get cold. We WILL be making these again soon, except next time I'll make a double batch. I sadly did not have a lemon and it was not convenient to get to the store, so I substituted dried lemon peel and a single drop of lemon extract in the muffins and then used ReaLemon juice for the glaze.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Next time hope to use a real lemon, as the fresh grated peel requested in the recipe will most likely give them a bit more lemon flavor than mine had.  Still, they were awesome! 
Thanks for sharing this.  I love a beautiful, moist muffin with a warm cup of tea. 
Note for tea room/party planner: As moist as these were, this recipe would probably be great as small, bite-size muffins for use at a tea or for a party platter. In my silicone muffin pans, they popped right out, too!

Not enough lemon flavor for me
and not very sweet either. I thought they were just kind of bland. Will keep looking for a GREAT Lemon poppyseed muffin.

Easy to make, and pretty good! I would add lemon juice to the batter and not add all of the poppy seeds though.

muffin doesn't taste very lemony, so you need the glaze. Also, they are quite greasy.

Not very lemony in flavor and a bit of a chewy texture for a muffin.

These were the best poppy seed muffins I've ever eaten. Very moist and lemony. I used plain whole milk yogurt as I didn't have sour cream. On the first batch I only used the juice and zest of one lemon (meyer) for the glaze which was plenty. The second batch (so good I had to make them again) I used two meyer lemons. The glaze was very runny so I added more sugar to get the right consistency and tang so I had glaze leftover which is not a problem. Excellent both times. This goes in my continue to make pile of recipes.

Great recipe!! I made a loaf instead of muffins, cook time is 45 minutes for a loaf. I also added a splash of pure vanilla to my wet ingredients and the glaze was a little tart so I added a splash of vanilla to it as well.

I followed the recipe exactly except I added some lemon juice
and used margarine & butter in place of the oil.  The texture was off, the muffins were sticky before the glaze was put on them.  Then as one review stated they were flat (almost concave) for me, and they wouldn't brown.  My family ate them all, but I think that was mostly due to hunger.  I don't recommend this recipe this is a case where the boxed muffins are much better.

These are tasty, however a couple things to note: I wish I'd read the comments before making them, as the muffin batter comes out liquidy and therefore cooks flat, instead of making rounded tops.  The juice of two lemons is way too much for the glaze and it is basically liquid with icing sugar.  Finally, the batter stuck to the muffin cups.

I did not have butter milk , but  i did have some vanilla yogurt so i added 2 Tablespoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice to 1 cup of the yogurt. Instead of veg. oil i used extra virgin olive oil. I added more lemon zest as well as more poppy seeds, i love them both!The recipe called for too much glaze, so i just combined the confectioners sugar and lemon juice slowly to make the amount i needed,and instead of drizzling the glaze, i placed the muffins down into the bowl of glaze and coated the whole top!! they tasted fantastic!! I will definitely make these again.

These were a yummy treat and oh so moist! I only used 1 lemon for both the muffins and the glaze. I had some leftover whey from some homemade yogurt I had made, so I used it instead of the buttermilk. These were quick to make and fuss free!

I used organic ingredients and whole milk instead of buttermilk, and a little extra lemon zest. They turned out perfect!
