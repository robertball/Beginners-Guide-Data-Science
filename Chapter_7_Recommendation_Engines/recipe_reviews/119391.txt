This lasagna is exceptionally good and deserves more than 5 stars. I didn't precook the lasagna noodles, but compensated by adding an extra 1/3 cup water to the sauce and extending the covered cooking time to 50 minutes. The noodles came out perfectly textured but without all the fuss of pre-cooking them. The only other change I made was to sprinkle a little parmesan on top of the mozzarella. Great recipe.

I have made this recipe several times for various guests (adults and kids), and have always gotten rave reviews. This is a very pleasant change from regular lasagna, and it's not as heavy either. I do prefer using 1 teaspoon of rosemary (try to smush it) for best flavor, unless you just don't like rosemary. This time I used 1 Tbsp. chopped FRESH rosemary, and loved it. I always end up using more Swiss, so have at least 50% extra on hand. Also the use of Barilla thin no-bake lasagne noodles cuts the work and makes a great texture (just cook for 50 minutes instead of 30). *UPDATE: used about 1/4 cup Merlot in sauce for a subtle but richer flavor!

this is a really good choice.. I added an extra 1/3 of a cup of water and extended the covered cook time to 1 hour. I also cut the onion down to 1/2 of a large white oninon.

amazingly EZ! The directions are a little confusing @ the end but it still turned out great! I subsituted the beef for turkey for a healthier/cheaper alternative.

I'd give this 4-1/2 if I could.  It was good lasagna, but not something that stood out.  I'll probably make it again.  I added fresh mushrooms and fresh basil to the sauce, and 2 cups cheese on top instead of 1/2.

Fantastic recipe! I added roasted eggplant and subtituted jarred sauce for the water. The rosemary adds a wonderful flavor to this hearty dish!

This recipe is almost identical to the one my mom used when I was a kid. I love the flavor the swiss cheese adds to the lasagna.

This is a good version of lasagna and should taste pretty good....unfortunately I misread the ingredients and ended up with runny sauce.  But I will definately try again because it was good even with runny sauce.

This was an acceptable lasagna, but not good enough to make again.  The directions for this recipe are extremely confusing.  For example, it says to add the remaining swiss cheese at two different times!  Since I know how to make lasagna, I just ignored the section on how to layer the ingredients and did what seemed right.  8 ounces of sliced swiss cheese only covered about one layer of a 9x13 pan.  Maybe I should have bought thinner slices?  I bought the cheese pre-sliced and each slice was one ounce.  I don't know if the recipe is intended to be made with only one layer of swiss or if there is supposed to be enough for several layers.  The recipe calls for adding swiss at least three times, but since the directions are so confusing, I'm not sure what they actually mean.  Anyway, my husband thought the recipe needed way more cheese, and although I'm less of a cheese fan than he is, I would have liked more swiss (I could hardly taste it).
