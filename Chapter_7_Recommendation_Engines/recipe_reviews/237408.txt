I changed this recipe quite a bit cause first of all I didn't have amaretto on hand. Anyway I added a shot of southern comfort and a shot of rum. I added equal parts of orange juice and lemonade instead of lemon lime pop to top off the glass. Since I'm not a huge fan of pop. Mmmn delicious!!!

This is a nice summery drink.  I wanted a real sized drink, so I used a shot of SoCo and a shot or amaretto along with about 3 oz of pineapple juice (no OJ) and then a few oz of Diet 7 Up to fill the glass, garnished w/a couple of cherries.  It's a little on the sweet side for me, but I knew that going into it.  If you like sweet, you'll like this.  CHEERS!
