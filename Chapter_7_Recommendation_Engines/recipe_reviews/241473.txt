Substitute Boursin cheese and add a couple capers. Had this in England about ten years ago, and have been making it ever since.

I made this with a trio pack of salmon and put different toppings on each type of salmon. Dill on the dill salmon, capers on the plain, thinly sliced red onion on herb and pepper salmon. I also added a touch more lemon juice so I could whip this very light. I piped on the cream cheese mixture onto the cucumber and on top on the salmon under the toppings. This was the only item that was completely gone by the end of the party. We had about 15 dishes. I will definitely bring this to all future gatherings!!!! Oh and I used hot house cucumbers

I  made this for a Christmas party and it went over very well. Even people who 'weren't sure' about it liked it after they gave it a try. I used the long English cucumber with little to no seeds. If you allow the cucumbers to drain well, I don't think you need to make the 'cups'.

I must have missed the boat with this recipe. Seems everyone who reviewed it, loved it. I thought it was nasty and threw it out.

This is easy and only requires a moderate investment of time.  It looks elegant and tastes good.  They were gone in a flash.  Like other reviewers I used English cucumbers and patted them dry as I could.  There was no need to scoop them out, the topping (which I based on whipped cream cheese) didn't slide around.  The only change I made was to drop in a few capers.  Even with that, I still might add a small pinch of salt if I made these again.  Also I might be tad a more generous with the lemon and zest measurements but not a whole lot more.

I did not make changes.  They turned out beautifully.  All were eaten and enjoyed by my guests, with many “Yums”.  Healthy to boot.

Delicious appetizers. Made with lactose free cream cheese and bit of sour cream. Could have cut cucumbers a bit thinner. Used hot house cucumbers with soft skins, could have used Persian or Armenian cucumbers. Definitely need a melon baller.

I made it with strained greek yoghurt because my husband is lactose intolerant and kept everything else the same.  It was great and very easy.  Will keep this recipe active

A beautiful and delicious appetizer. The combination of textures and flavors is divine. Didn’t modify the recipe one bit. These will be a party regular for me from now on.

I would suggest getting your smoked salmon already sliced.  I got a filet the first time and there was no slicing it.  It was salmon 'pieces' instead.  It still tasted good but didn't look as pretty.

I used this recipe to build my Thanksgiving salad. I call it “Ensalada Estelita.” I placed a romaine lettuce leaf on a saucer, drizzled it with Italian dressing. I used Bernstein’s Cheese Fantastico dressing.  I placed a slice from a large tomato on the lettuce. I then placed a white wave of mayonnaise on the tomato. i then placed the cucumber, prepared exactly as called for by the recipe. Even a few who don’t usually eat salad ate this!

I have made bread rounds ( I used a shot glass to make them ) put some mayo on each. I topped that with a peeled cucumber round and a a little salt and pepper, or not) and top duke with sprigs of fresh dill.  People loved them as well. I do love lox though. Thankyou.

Easy, delish. I used an English cucumber and just sliced it about 1/4" thick. The photo looks like lox were used, but I used Alaskan caught smoked salmon and the result was super tasty, easy to make, easy to bring to a gathering. The only change I made (in addition to not making cucumber "cups"), was to add a bit of salt to the cream. Yum.

Easy, pretty and popular.  I did substitute a garlic/chive cream cheese. I think draining and patting dry the cucumber is key. Thanks!

The sauce recipe is excellent and easy to make. The only change I made was to add a little fresh squeezed lemon juice along with the rind to give it more of a tang. I made it for a birthday party and people were taking the sauce (and recipe) home with them (I always make too much).

Very good! My cucumbers were mature, so the the quarter inch slices were too thick. Next time I will go thinner. And I bought capers based on another reviewers recommendation,  but forgot to add them. Next day ate with crackers and the capers were fantastic.
