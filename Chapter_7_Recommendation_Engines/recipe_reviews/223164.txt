I thought these turned out fairly good. If you like Quaker oatmeal packaged granola bars you will like these. I left out the dried fruit, but think they would have been good with raisins. I used an equivalent amount of extra rolled oats, for the steel cut, to avoid a trip to the store. It worked fine. I thought the half a cup of mini chocolate chips was a bit much, as these were plenty sweet already. I consider them more of a sweet then a health food. However, I feel that way about most all store bought granola bars also that, taste just like this. A hint for the chocolate chips is to freeze them to avoid melting if mixing in. Stir in the syrup well and let the mix cool down pretty well and add them in. I am not sure how they would have stuck to the top, as suggested. After the refridgerating, I worked hard to cut them into the 24 servings suggested and about 80% of them came out without much breaking, as they are very chewy and flexible. Although, not traditional as a square a different cut might hold better. I wasn't sure how to store these, as the directions didn't make any suggestions on that. I bagged them individually and stored in the fridge. It seemed to work good. I only wish now I had some kids to test these on.

Very tasty!  I used 1cup cashews instead of the fruit and almonds.  I find they fall apart a bit (maybe I didn't cook the sugar long enough) but the flavor is great.  Also, the chocolate chips ended up melting all over because I tried packing them in when the mixture was still warm.

This hands down is the best granola bar recipe I have ever made. There are endless possibilities (chocolate chips and almonds, craisins and white chocolate chips, cinnamon and raisin... you name it!), and it's so easy to make. I, too, had to experiment with the issue of them falling apart when made as directed, and I found 2 things. If you cook the mixture exactly as directed (until the sugar is dissolved), they will fall apart unless they are refrigerated. I experimented with a few different ways, and here's a simple improvement to keep them together better (even out of the refrigerator). I used 3 tablespoons of butter (a tablespoon less than called for) and 3 tablespoons of honey (again, a tablespoon less) with the 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Instead of simply melting, I let it boil at a rolling boil for about 2 minutes (my candy thermometer is broken, but I'd guess it was about to the soft ball stage). It doesn't change the taste at all, but it does help it to stick together better. I also put my chocolate chips on top and waited until they melted, then spread them around. That way it also helps to hold together better as well as to evenly distribute the chocolate. As far as storing goes, as soon as I'm able, I cut them into bars (lengthwise I cut it in half, then width-wise I cut it into about 8 sections, making 16 bars for a 9x13 pan) then put each bar into a snack-sized zipper baggie. Perfect for lunches and snacking on the go!

This is my 2nd time making these, and they are delicious!!  This is a wonderful base recipe that goes together super quick, and is chewy & delicious.

First version I made, I added a mashed up banana to the wet ingredients (I did have to process the liquid to make it smooth) and used walnuts and chocolate chips in the bars - tastes like a chocolate covered banana, and still works out to just 134 calories per serving!

Tonight, I made a peanut butter version - subbing 1/4 c peanut butter for the butter, and I used agave nectar in place of the honey because we were out.  I also added a little less than 1/2 c of flaxseed to the dry ingredients.  I stuck with the 1/2 c walnuts and about 1/3 c chocolate chips pressed into the top after the mixture was transferred to the pan.  They're not quite cool yet, but boy, did my little nibble taste yummy! 

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!

These are good but definitely not a healthier version of the store bought we want to imitate with all the added sugar.  You may as well buy the prepackaged ones. I don't use the sugars listed or the butter.  Instead, I use about half a cup of brown rice syrup and 1/3 - 1/2 cup natural peanut butter to hold them together.  Yes it provides a small amount of sugar and the peanut butter gives it flavor and helps them bond into a more stable bar. I also don't put dried fruit in but I have at times.  I add a combination of coconut, almonds, pecans walnuts and pumpkin seeds as well as a tablespoon or two of ground flax for omega 3's and fiber.  Cinnamon also makes a nice addition to the flavor with the nuts. 

After placing them in the baking dish and before placing them in the refrigerator to set up, I melt half a bag of dark chocolate morsels on top in the oven for 2 - 3 minutes for sweetness.  When I take the bars out I then spread the melted chips in a thin layer of chocolate over the entire batch.  It helps hold them together and provides a nice touch for the sweet tooth.

I've found this on several blogs lately and it's our go to recipe for quick and easy granola bars. I have found we like 1/4-1/3 cup brown sugar to be better, as they are too sweet otherwise. Also, you have to press these in pretty darn good so they stick together. AND the best way to make them stay firm is to refrigerate...otherwise they do tend to break easily, which I don't mind but my bf doesn't care for crumbling bars. :) It's fun to mix up the nuts/fruit/chocolate, or eliminate all together.

We have loved this recipe!  As is, it is great!  (I do double the recipe to make the bars thicker in my 9x13 pan.)  To adjust to our tastes, I've made the following changes to Dana's recipe. (And some of these have been suggested in other reviews.)  I've cut the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and the chocolate chips to 1/4 cup.  Sometimes I will omit the chocolate chips and then increase the fruit to 3/4 cup.  One reviewer mentioned switching the butter for peanut butter.  I am anxious to try this one but haven't had an opportunity since I have one child that doesn't like nuts.  Another reviewer mentioned cooking the butter, honey, and brown sugar for 2 minutes at a rolling boil.  I found this very helpful.  It brings the sugar to somewhere between the soft ball and hard ball stage which keeps it from falling apart too much.  I also put parchment paper on the bottom of my 9x13 pan.  After pressing the mixture into the pan and while it is still warm, I cut the granola into bars.  Then I put it in the fridge to harden.  After it is cool, I pull it out, break the bars along the cut lines, and then put in sandwich bags so that they are ready to grab for lunches or snacks.  As the bars get warm, they can sometimes fall apart slightly.  But I think this is partially because of the lower sugar amount.  No matter, our whole family loves these!  Thanks for a great recipe, Dana!

Hi - While I loved bulk of this recipe, I also had the problem of the bars just not sticking together.  They will turn into granola when you try to cut them. So, I used brown rice syrup in place of the butter, brown sugar, AND honey.  Trust me, you don't need any of those ingredients if you use the brown rice syrup (about 1/2 cup of it).  Also, if you want a mocha bar, add instant coffee - delicious.  They will take just like Kashi Mochoa Almond Bars.

I made these for the first time last night and really enjoyed them.  They are a savior for me as store-bought ones, which are filled with high fructose corn syrup and random other garbage, make me really sick.  The best thing is that they're chewy!  And since they don't require use of the oven, I can make them all summer without worrying about overheating my apartment.

I use whatever I have on hand, so in this batch I didn't use rolled oats, but I added cinnamon just for fun.  Also the next time I make it I might use 1/3c brown sugar.  1/2 wasn't a crazy amount, but I'd just like to use a wee bit less.

UPDATE 4/19/2015: I still make these often!  I've found that they're too sweet with the 1/2c brown sugar and 1/4 honey, so instead of the honey I tried light agave syrup with my latest batch.  It worked really well!  I've also been using coconut sugar in place of the brown sugar.

I make these often. I have found that mixing the 2 oats and the nuts together and toasting them for 10-15 minutes in a 350*F oven gives them a nice toasty taste. I also sometimes substitute 1/2 cup maple syrup for the brown sugar quite often.  The syrup seems to help them stay together rather than crumble. and use dried cranberries and white chips.  These are a family favorite. It's a great recipe that really lends itself to lots or variations!  Thanks so much for sharing it.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for! Love it!! I ended up using coco puffs cereal since it was what I had on hand and they turned out great. I found too that putting the bars in a pan with low edges, like a cookie sheet with edges, that I can use a heavy rolling pin to help press them together. I find I still have to keep them in the refrigerator and that helps them not fall apart as well.  Flavor, texture and consistency was great. Look forward to making these often :)

The syrup recipe echoes my ancient Betty Crocker caramel corn recipe exactly, and that covers 6 cups of popcorn and sets up IF AND ONLY IF it is allowed to boil to the soft-ball stage.  I used Quaker multigrain cereal (like oatmeal but with more grains), steel-cut oats (I was leery of these uncooked but they worked!), Rice Crispies, 2 kinds of dried apples, walnuts, butter pecan pancake syrup in place of the honey and cinnamon chips (which I can only find in the fall, just before the holidays). Coworkers and my husband loved them.  I'm planning on dried cherries, almonds and dark chocolate chips, and mixed dried fruit, macadamias and white chocolate chips. UPDATE:  I've tried both of the other versions I mentioned and they were fantastic.  This recipe lends itself to SO MANY variations!  Making more tonight...I'll see what I have in the pantry...gonna try using instant coffee as someone suggested to make mocha bars!

These are delicious!!!  You can change the ingredients up however you like.  I used coaches oats, special K, multigrain Cheerios, raisins and wheat germ.  As long as the total amount of dry ingredients is the same as what the recipe calls for, they turn out great!  You can even swap out the honey for corn syrup if that's all you have. (I did)  Better than any chewy granola bar I have ever bought.

I have made this recipe several times this summer and my family likes them better than store bought granola bars. I freeze my chocolate chips when I start measuring my ingredients and stir them in at the end. I store them in the fridge as they do fall apart when at room temperature. We use metal cookie cutters to make the bars into different shapes.

I use this as my go to granola bar recipe all the time. My roommate begs me to make them, the only thing I do different is make them into bites. I use the silicone bake ware and spoon in the granola, I hate cutting them and this eliminates that step, two bites equals one original serving. I am trying to figure out how to pack them with protein though! Lovely and simple recipe, thanks!

We like our bars really chewy, so I made this and added a tablespoon of real maple syrup. I omitted the fruit and nuts, and just made them with mini chips, since I am not much of a fruit and granola type of person. We were eating the stuff like it was candy, it's so good! I was actually disappointed after we put the chips in, because I just wanted to eat it plain  again.  And now I am a convert! I was dying to try them with raisins or craisins or something.

Yummy!  I microwaved the wet ingredients in a glass bowl for 1.5 minutes instead of melting them over the stove and them poured it over the dry stuff.  That worked well and made clean up a little easier too.  I didn't have any dried fruit or almonds.  I used pecans as for the nuts.  Next time, I'll try this with cut up strawberry banana fruit roll ups.  Oh, and I lined my pan with parchment paper.  The granola is so much easier to deal with that way.

I followed this recipe exact only I used half Craisins/half raisins for the dried fruit (that was all I had on hand) and I left out the chocolate chips. These are delicious! The kids kept asking for another after they'd had the first one and my husband thought they were quite good "for a granola bar".

So easy to make!  The stone ground oats gives it great texture so try to purchase it.  We did not use the chocolate chips but added coconut.  So many options to add or delete items.  I will continue to make this recipe over and over.

Will make often! So versatile. Can swap out any dried fruit (apricots, raisins, cranberries); and add chia seeds, sunflower seeds; and can use sunbutter instead of peanut butter so it is nut-free for school.

Delicious and incredibly versatile. I altered the add-ins based on what I had and what we like, but I give it 5 stars because this is now my go-to recipe and a great base for your own preferences.  

My husband likes those Fiber One chewy chocolate bars and I'm very excited for him to try these.

I used 1 1/2 cups old fashioned oats, 1 1/2 cups crispy rice cereal, left out dried fruit and almonds and substituted about 1/2 cup chopped dry roast peanuts and 1/2 cup candied walnut pieces (using the Candied Almonds recipe from this site).  Amazing. I'm reveling in the (albeit comparatively small) amount of money we'll save on Fiber One bars over the course of a year, in favor of a product that is SO GOOD.  I'm even planning on serving these at a get-together tonight.

Very tasty however I have made these twice following the recipe exactly and both times I couldn’t get them to stick together to form bars.  It ended up being granola.

I make this and use it as my cereal. I skip the cut oats if I dont have them on hand and I cant tell the difference. I use peanuts and raisins. I mix the chocolate chips in with the rest of the ingredients. I made a batch without nuts and it was good as well. 

You can play around with your ingredients to suit your taste.  Way less expensive than the boxed stuff and more control over whats in it.

I am sure that this recipe is awesome but I wanted to make some changes for reasons of taste and because of health reasons for my son. I use this recipe as a Baseline only. I am one of those Cooks that add things until I like the taste. so as a baseline this recipe is great! I followed the oatmeal ratios but when it came to the dried fruit my son doesn't like fruit so I ended up adding ground flaxseed, ground wheat bran, a half cup of shelled pumpkin seeds, half cup of sunflower seeds, half cup of homemade peanut (I roasted peanuts in canola oil with omega-3s and a dash of sea salt @350 for 13 mins then put in a processor with canola oil and honey because of soy allergy) half cup of good life mini chocolate chips(soy free, and gluten free for allergy), and Then followed rest of recipe brown sugar, butter, honey, and poured over dry ingredients then put into a 9x 13 and refrigerated for two hours and it turned out awesome!! I only change things due to child having food allergies and health issues. Great recipe as Baseline. Thank you for the great recipe!?

I have made these several times and love them. My family and a friend like them as well. I decided to try something different and used apple sauce in place of butter and didn't have any honey so I used lite corn syrup. They still turned out really good. I always use Peanuts instead of walnuts.

To make the "school safe" I use pumpkin or sunflower seeds.  I also substitute the rice crispies for 1/2 c coconut and 1/4 sunny boy (or other similar cereal, or bran etc) and 1/4 oats.  it's super flexible that way.  And I increase the amount of dried fruit adding several kinds chopped to appropriate sizes.  If you put the chocolate chips into the bottom of your parchment lined pan then you can really press the mixture in well without messing them up by getting melted by the heat of the  mixture.  Please note:  for those who complain about the mixture not sticking together it's because you need to cook the syrup for longer, a good boil for 3-5 min.  and I add a generous 1/8 tsp of soda right before pouring it onto the oat mixture.  it greatly helps bring it all together and keep it firm.

omg! I can't stop eating these.  I didn't have steel cut oats so I just put regular oats in place of the steel cut.  I like nuts so I added more nuts and left out the fruit.  This is such a great recipe that you can substitute however you want.  Thank you!

I made this exactly as the recipe states and I didn't care for the flavor. The bars also didn't stick together nicely. For me, this recipe needs a lot of tweaking.

Excellent recipe! Been searching for a good chewy granola bar recipe and found it.  I wanted to make this as healthy as I could with what ingredients I had on hand.  I used rolled oats entirely (was out of cut steel ones) raw local honey, grassfed butter (will experiment with ghee next batch) and rapadura mixed with a little blackstrap molasses in place of brown sugar. Crushed almonds, pecans and raisins were added (no other dried fruits on hand) and I didn't have crispy rice cereal either lol so I left it out and this recipe was still so so good and tasty. As an extra experiment I reserved a little of the mixture in a small bowl and poured in a little sprouted almond milk over it and gave it a taste...oh yes, great as a cold cereal too.  Thank you for sharing this.

I love it!! Per reviews, I added just a little but more honey so they will stick better and it was perfect! Instead of almonds, I used pecans. Way better than store bought granola bars!

This tasted good and, after refrigerated, had a nice texture.  I'm not sure the steel cut oats were necessary, more rolled oats might have been nicer.  (The steel cut oats are pricey and didn't really soften.)  I was surprised at how thin the bars were, I would probably make them in a 9 in square pan next time.  I made the mistake of adding chocolate chips with the oats, and when the butter mixture was poured over, they all melted and we got chocolate granola bars -- they taste delicious, but we were trying to make "chocolate chip-craisin" bars.  I made them for a lunch box treat, and I'm somewhat concerned about how they'll fare (texture-wise) at room temperature.  I would probably make them again, but I'll still be looking around for something closer to what I imagined.

I made these following the recipe and they are really good! I had never seen steel cut oats used uncooked, but they add a nice texture and flavor. The bars need to be refigerated or else they're messy. I didn't give the recipe a 5star cause I think they are a little soft. My 3 boys love them!! Great for the lunchbox.

Very sweet! I would cut the sugar in the future. Taste is spot-on! (I added a pinch of salt) Also, came out crumby- all my "bars" fell apart, not sure if a thermometer is needed for a harder candy coating.

My family gobbled these up. Definitely quick and easy...although, the honey flavor was strong!  I think I'll cut that and maybe the vanilla both in half next time. Hopefully they will still hold together.
OH, and they have to STAY in the fridge or they turn into just really sticky granola! :-D

This is a very tasty recipe, but I found that it came out very crumbly.  I will try making this again thoug.  Cooking the sugar mixture a bit longer and adding maple syrup will hopefully make them stick together a bit better

So yummy! Everyone in my family devoured them! I recommend keeping them in the fridge because they get crumbly when warm. I crushed up some dried bananas to add to the fruit mixture, and added some flax seed. It's a great recipe because you could add just about anything! Next batch I'll try almond extract instead of vanilla.
