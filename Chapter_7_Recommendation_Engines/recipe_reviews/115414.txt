Waaaaay better than I was expecting. And so easy. I used vegetable broth that was already opened and needed to be used instead of water. So good!

UPDATE!! I took my leftover Kale and tossed it in with some pasta and some white beans! OMG! Delicious!!Simple and Delicious! This made a nice addition to my dinner tonight! My only changes were I diced up a small onion and used chicken stock in place of the water!  Very very good!

A tasty way to keep a nutritious food light and tasty!  Keep in mind that it will cook down to about two cups in the end.

This recipe is great on its own, but doubly great for people who don’t know that the secret to kale is that you have to cook it for a while to get the bitterness out. Kale is so good for you but people just don’t realize it can be tasty!

Very good.  I had a small amount of andouille sausage (maybe 1/4 pound or less) in the fridge that needed to be used, so I cut it into very thin slices and sauteed it first before adding the kale.  Since the sausage is very spicy, I omitted the red pepper flakes.  The kale that I had was enormous flat leaves, so I increased the cooking time.  Vinegar is a perfect addition.

This was our first time to cook and eat Kale and let me tell you, this recipe is sensational! My husband prepared the Kale while I prepared stuffed pork chops. Such a spectacular taste sensation that we will for sure be preparing again! Nothing in the recipe needs changed except we may cook it a little longer next time and use a little more oil to soften a bit more. Otherwise sensational recipe! Yummy! Thanks for another staple food for our kitchen!

Sometimes I use Apple juice instead of broth or water. Very delicious, healthy and easy.

This was an easy and good tasting dish. The sherry vinegar gave it a nice tang, and the cooking method softened the kale to a pleasing chewing consistency. I will definitely make it again for a quick weeknight dinner. However, it does not have enough complex flavor to impress guests. Next time, I may try adding sauteed onions and yellow peppers.

This recipe has great flavor and is simple to make! Loved the added crushed pepper flavor. My only changes: no salt (wasn't needed) and I drizzled balsamic reduction on it just before serving.

I used half a bag of cleaned kale. After sautéing for a minute and adding the water, I only cooked the kale about three minutes, just slightly wilted and drained the little bit of water remaining. I used the amounts of other ingredients in the recipe, but doubled the vinegar and added a packet of Splenda. Used fresh cracked pepper and sea salt. Everyone including my picky eaters liked it.

4-22-16:  This is my standard way of preparing kale except for using homemade chicken bone broth instead of water.  Also I generally top it with bacon bits and/or Parmesan cheese for added flavor.

I must admit the vinegar threw me off and I thought it would taste yucky.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I made it with chicken stock I had left over.  I will make this again.
