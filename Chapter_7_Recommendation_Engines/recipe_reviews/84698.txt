Great concept.  My husband really loved it.  It needed salt, and you could probably get creative with the spicing, but the combination of fresh tomato, rice and salmon really works as far as flavor/texture.

This was very good.  It really does need salt though, luckily I read the reviews before I made it and salted the dish as I cooked. I also made a butter sauce too for the rice, it was really good.

I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious this combination was together.  We decided to give it a try because we like salmon, rice, and fried green tomatoes even though this one uses red.  The only thing I did different was use more Dill and Lemon Pepper seasoning and the final dish needed quite a bit of salt.   The next time I prepare it and I know I will I'm going to add a lemon butter sauce to go over the it.

I needed something to do with the can of salmon I had in the cupboard and stumbled on this recipe.  I used the canned salmon in place of fresh (in a pinch it worked!) I slowly removed the salmon from the can with a knife so it came out in three solid pieces.  I removed all the skin off the salmon and placed it in the pan. Then proceeded to cook according to the recipe. I did not fry up the tomatoes, I just threw them in fresh. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and made a nice lemon butter sauce to pour over the top.  It was unbelievably good!  I gave this a 5 star rating because you can use fresh, canned and probably frozen salmon here as well as canned whole tomatoes in a pinch  and it would still taste great!

Tasty dish, the tomatoes were an idea I had never thought of and they were great on top of the fish.

This recipe was great!! Easy to make, and my fussy husband really liked it; he did add quite a bit of salt though.  But he keeps asking when we're going to have it again before he finishes the meal! It's a winner in my book!

This was delicious.  I only had fresh diced tomatoes, so I didn't even fry them up, I just put them on top of the salmon and it was great.  It did need the salt, so I added a little to the rice and then some to the salmon as it was frying.  Very easy recipe, especially with a rice cooker!

This was very tasty, using leftover grilled salmon.  However, i found the timing off on frying the tomatoes.  Perhaps it should be 5 minutes total, which is what I did.  Anything more would have been burned...2 1/2 minutes on each side was just right.

This was really good. My husband didn't like the salmom on top of the rice but next time i'll put it beside. I too amped up the salmon w/ extra seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic salt, and some old bay. I also used italian bread combs mixed w/ flour for my fried tomatos. This dish is good w/ a side of vegies, yum!

The salmon was great, although I added some Mrs. Dash - I just need more flavor. I love the idea of flavoring the rice while cooking, a way to make it extra-special. I didn't try the tomatoes b/c I didn't have any on hand. I'd make it again. Got good reviews from the husband.

I liked this. It wasn't complicated and was very good. I did serve it with some lime slices, and that was used by all.

By accident we forgot to put the dill & lemon pepper in the rice, and ended up putting them on the salmon instead.  It tasted perfect!  I think the recipe needs to be done this way, otherwise the salmon is utterly unseasoned.

I liked the fried tomatoes, but the salmon was too plain.  I prefer a sauce to go along with it.  I followed some other users advise and added salt and pepper to the salmon while cooking, if I hadn't it would have been waaay too plain.

Very, very nice! My hubby is Filipino and rice is always on hand and we're purists where rice is concerned. I used half the dill and lemon pepper on the salmon and the other half on tomatoes prior to cooking. Excellent dish and will definitely do this one again. Thank you for sharing!!

One of the best recipes I've used from online. Used chilli and lemon spice instead of lemon pepper and mixed herbs as I had them in stock. Would give it 10 stars if I could.

The salmon was great but the rice had to much Dill in it. next time I will us a tsp of dill rather then a 1/2 tbs. Just to over powering for me. Make sure to slice tomatoes very thin tast bettet that way. Salmon didn't that as long as recipe called for. But, will make it again.

family didn't care for the dill lemon pepper rice.  salmon was just ok.  There are better recipes.  And fried tomatoes did not turn out well.  (I think that is due to my not having the oil hot enough though.)

This was pretty good and different.  I enjoyed the rice and the fried tomatoes.  I did add salt and pepper to the salmon which was needed.
