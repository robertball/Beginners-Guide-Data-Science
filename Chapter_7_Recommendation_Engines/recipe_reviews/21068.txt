I've made this recipe several times.  Everyone loves it.  The only thing I changed was to use 8 eggs for 8 servings, otherwise the servings seemed too big.  I served it with a light fresh fruit salad for brunch and it was perfect.

I did like that this was different type recipe but overall I was not real impressed with the end result. It was a little bland. If I were to make it again I would probaly try smoked ham to counter the sweet flavor of the cornbread stuffing or try a stuffing for ham or pork or an herb stuffing just to give it more flavor. I did use a mixture of swiss, chedder, and mozzarella cheese on top which I liked. I think I would use a little less ham next time maybe 3 cups. I also took the advice of the previous review and used 8 eggs.

I liked this- had to make a few changes as I didn't have any celery or cheddar cheese.  I used leftover cornbread, and only added about a Tblsp of chicken broth as the cornbread was already moist.  Used TurkeyHam, and laid some slices of swiss cheese across the top.  I also scrambled the eggs and poured them over the whole thing; it turned out "quiche-like," with cornbread chunks.  I thought it turned out yummy, my husband thought it would taste better with the original stuffing ingredients, as the cornbread made it taste too sweet.  I gave it 4 stars and I'll probably make this again for just me or for a potluck, but not for a family meal.

This is a great recipe!  i also made a few modifications. Add to the onion mixture 14 ounces of crumbled cornbread (home made is great).  Season well, but be careful with the salt- the ham is very salty.  Pour the mixture into a greased 9X13 baker. Beat the eggs and pour over mixture, distributing over entire dish.  Bake in 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Sprinkle with cheese and bake for 10 more minutes or until no longer runny in center.

I made this dish with regular stuffing, not cornbread, because that's what i had in the pantry. It was delicious! Very rich, but we loved it. I topped it off with hollondaise sauce in lieu of cheese, and that was bomb.com. It's a very filling and cheap dinner, which is nice to have sometimes...

I thought it was OK. My kids liked it & would eat it again. I used sliced ham that I cut up instead of cubed ham.

Cut back on the cheese a bit.. was tasty but on the salty side.  I think I'd stir in the eggs next time too
