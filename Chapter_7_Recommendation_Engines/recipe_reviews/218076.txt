Super easy and very yummy. I didn't have fresh rosemary or green onions, but substituted with dried rosemary and whatever onions that were in my pantry. Also, I only marinaded for 3 hours and it still turned out delicious. This will definitely be made again.

Andrew's Favorite Grilled Pork Chops' Haiku: "Terrific, moist chops. (Couldn't taste the rosemary.) Use good orange juice!" I marinated our pork chops (on the more slender side) for nearly 24 hrs. in the exact ingredients and ratio as Andrew directs. At about 10 min. per side on the grill, they were perfectly done, and really tasted great; however, I'm almost glad that I couldn't detect the rosemary, b/c I think that an herb w/ that pronounced of a flavor wouldn't jive so well w/ OJ and soy sauce. In any case, we're looking forward to using this marinade on another occasion b/c it was quite good.

These were so much better than I had hoped. I have never had such flavorful, tender pork chops before. I had actually purchased a rosemary plant a few days before so I was able to use the fresh herb in this recipe. I did marinate them all night. My pork chops were "bone-in" and not the thick ones as the recipe stated but the chops were still AMAZING. My next trip to the grocery store will include some thick boneless center cut pork chops! I am looking forward to making these again. Thank You Crystal and Andrew!!

This was another collaborative effort between Hubs and me.  I chose the recipe - how could I not, given Andrew is my baby grandson's name and the fact I had a lonely, zestless orange in the fridge I needed to use before I headed out of town again?  I marinated the chops; the Grillmaster cooked them over charcoal. Hubs is the one who's not a fan of marinades, yet he was more impressed with this than I.  He remarked that it was quite good, nice balance of flavors, with a pleasantly  delicate hint of orange.  I  personally wouldn't have detected any marinade on the chops at all had I not marinated them myself.  I guess my tastebuds must have been a little numb tonight.  Botton line - if Hubs liked this marinade, it must be darned good, as he is particularly discriminating.

Oh my goodness this recipe was awesome!!!!!  The chops had such a great flavor and so juicy. There was hardly anything left once we were done. This will be a return meal for us for sure. I am not a rosemary fan so I subbed with thyme and regular yellow onion since I did not have scallions.

This was really tasty!  I only let them marinade for about 2 hours, but they taste was very good.  Next time, I will let them marinade even longer for fuller flavor.  I didn't have rosemary on hand, so I omitted that but otherwise it was just as written.  Served with sauteed squash and baked potato - lovely meal.

The flavor didn't come through as much as I would have liked but it was a nice mild flavor.  These grilled up beautifully!  I did use bone in chops which works well.  Thanks!

This marinade was surprisingly good and it left the pork chops so tender and juicy.  I marinaded them using just the OJ soy sauce and rosemary for 3 hours and ended up baking mine with a slice of fresh orange on each pork chop to hold in the moisture until they were 145F (we still have a  few feet of snow outside and it was snowing today so grilling would be difficult) and they still turned out just wonderfully. Made them for 5 people and they all loved them as well, you can definitely taste the orange in them.  Cannot wait until the snow finally melts so I can try them on the grill.  Thanks for the recipe will definitely be using this one again.

Tasty marinade for sure. Uses regular pantry items perhaps except for the OJ. I cooked them on stove top instead on a skillet. Worth giving it a try.

Excellent! I used pork tenderloin and sweet onion instead of green and it turned out great! I  pierced the meat and marinated the pork for 24 hrs. I started it off on the grill, on low. Cooked for about 15-20 min and then continued cooking in the oven, covered with a little water in the pan for 30 min at 350. This had such a great flavor. This is a keeper!

Used orange mango juice, dried rosemary and forgot the onions. Marinated 6 hours or less. Excellent.
