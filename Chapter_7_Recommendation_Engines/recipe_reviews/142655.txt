I made this as a wonderfull side dish, to grilled chicken. The only changes I made were instead of green chilis, I used 3-jalapeno peppers (fresh diced). Then before baking i added a layer of italian  bread crumbs for texture. My family and I love it. (Hominy is a great substitute for heavy carbs.)

This is delicious! I made it as a side dish for Easter, and it went wonderfully with the brisket and sausage we barbecued (we're a little non-traditional). We topped it with a crumb topping like the one in the South Coast Hominy recipe from this site and it made a big difference. Next time, we're going to add some meat of some kind to make it more of a main dish. Spice it up with a little cumin and some smoked paprika and chili powder and this is YUMMY!

Well, this was the first time my husband or I had hominy. I was experimenting with new things :). I gave the recipe five stars because it does have great flavor and I liked the taste...I don't think, though, that my husband or I care for the texture of hominy itself much. But I didn't think that my review should reflect that as it isn't the fault of the recipe. Anyway, if you like hominy, this is a good recipe with great cheesy flavor!

Oh wow, was this ever good.  If I recall correctly I reduced the cream cheese by half and added a 1/4 cup of plain yogurt...I also rinsed the hominy before adding it.  This is easily one of the top five things I have ever made here on AR.  Love the texture!

A delicious and different way to eat hominy. I love cream cheese but thought this had a little too much. Otherwise, it was great.

We really liked this.  This was done about 30 mins before the rest of the meal, and we munched on it til dinner....we ended up eating about 1/3 of it before we even sat down!  I used garlic powder and onion powder in this instead of the garlic and onion it called for, but it turned out great!

I had high hopes for this but it was a bit disappointing.  It was bland and took longer to cook than stated.  Next time I will add green chiles and more salt/pepper.  Will always try a recipe twice! ;o)

I was actually kind of surprised by the heat in this dish, because I thought for sure all the cheese would balance it out but it was still pretty spicy. I will make this recipe again.

Loved this recipe!!! I didn't have a can of gree chiles so I added a can of Roteldinced tomatoes and green chiles and that was delicious!! I also added a bit of chili powder and extra cheese (one cup, vs. 1/2 cup). Delicious! I will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe! I doubled the recipe and used half corn and half hominy. I also used a lot more onion and garlic than the recipe called for and it was really yummy!

Read through the recipe and some of the reviews then proceeded to make this with what I had on hand.  Things I changed: No green chilies but I did have Rotel Diced tomatoes w/green chilies, browned off some ground turkey to make this more of a main dish.  Also had some of the canned nacho cheese sauce that I needed to use so I used it instead of the shredded cheese, added Chopped up fresh Kale for color and something healthy.  Added cumin, coriander, chili powder, and salt when I was sauteing the onions, garlic and turkey.   Served with tortilla chips.  YUM!!

I did not care for this at all. It was my first time using hominy. I would not make this again, nor would I use hominy again.

Love this recipe with the exception of the cream cheese! I make it on top of the stove. Melt butter or margarine, add chopped green onions, hominy and green chiles. Stir gently and simmer for about 10 minutes. Then add shredded cheddar and jack cheese. Let cheese melt. Stir gently and serve. So good! We like this with barbecued pork chops.

Highly recommended. As a couple reviewers mentioned, it's a little bland, so we doubled the chilies. We also added more cheese after baking, broiled it for a couple minutes to brown it on top, and sprinkled it with bacon bits. Very nice that way. It might also be good to mix in some pearl onions or jalapeños before baking. We would serve it to guests, which is the standard around here.

I like hominy, so I expected to really like this side dish. I might take the cream cheese and green chilis idea and use it in another recipe. After baking, it became watery. I was surprised, because I drained the hominy and green chilis well. However, as it cooled it did absorb the liquid. Even so, the hominy did not seem to absorb the cream cheese mixture. I also had an issue with the onion being slightly crunchy, after baking, despite sauteing them first.

It was a bit bland, I love cream cheese and hominy but I would say needed less cream cheese and maybe some pepper and a little butter.

I liked hominy as a kid, so I thought I'd enjoy this casserole. It was bland and just didn't taste good to me. Sorry, but not for us. I made exactly as the recipe specified.
