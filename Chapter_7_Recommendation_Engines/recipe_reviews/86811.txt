Add some bay leaves, use fresh garlic, olive oil and instead of smoked sausage, try chorizo.

I made this last night. what a great easy dinner. I did not have tomato sauce so I used a can of chopped tomatoes.  I simmered it for an hour. The smell was great !  At the end I added  some chopped fresh cilantro. I served it over brown rice.  Very good.

This was great! I love chic peas and always try to fine a dish to cook them with. The only thing I did was add more garlic powder and half the red pepper called for, I am not to big on spicy hot food and it was just perfect. Husband and kids loved it, made over white rice. This will def. be made again, I might add some other veggies in it next time. Thanks!

After one bite, the husband said 'Instant Classic', which means, 'Get this into the recipe book, it's going to be part of our regular rotation'. It's so inexpensive to make (Hillshire Farms Lite Smoked Sausage goes on sale so frequently) and essentially a cupboard meal for us. Served it over brown rice. The only thing is that it was quite salty AND SPICY!!!! I had to actually add a spoonful of sour cream to mine to tame/cool it down some. I will add one heaping teaspoon of crushed red pepper next time instead of the full 2 teaspoons.  I also like to use a whole 15 oz can of low sodium tomato sauce because I like the extra sauce when serving it over rice.  I saute the sausage and onions together - I didn't see much come out of cooking the sausage on its own. It only saves 5 minutes, but when you have a screaming kid, every second counts! Update: Made this with low sodium adobo and it's still pretty salty and missing a few spices....I also used no salt added tomato sauce, 1 teaspoon low sodium adobo (which is missing a few spices) and marsala (since I only have cooking sherry at home which has added salt to it), and that helped a little bit.  But it's not as good as the original, so will go back to that.

Cuban Smoked Sausage with Chickpeas' Haiku: "This turned out so good! Just wish it had some color. But still, mmmarvelous!" The reviews complaining of this recipe being bland evidently didn't see the submitter saying, to add more of any seasoning to your taste, and frankly, I did just that, but I imagine it would be fine as written, since adobo seasoning and smoked sausage are both such flavorful ingredients. I halved the ingredients (for 3 people), added a bay leaf, 2 minced garlic cloves, diced yellow bell pepper, and surprisingly, swapping sherry for apple juice, as that's all that I had LOL. I let mine simmer for 1.5 hrs. so the chickpeas wouldn't be, as my husband calls them, "pebbley", and really, I thought this was pretty tasty, but just boring of color, so when I make it again, I'll have to throw in some zucchini, kale, tomatoes, or whatever for some additional color and zip.

Sooo good. I didn't have sausage so used leftover ham and I didn't have sherry so I used rye and it was still fantastic! Can't wait to try it with the sausage!

I loved this recipe.  I over-did it a bit with the red pepper flakes and it was really spicy.  Should have followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely be making again.  Thanks!

Very tasty, but simple and comforting.  I thought it was a bit salty with 3 tbsp of Adobe seasoning.  This may be due to the type of sausage I used.  Next time I'll add it to taste.

I made this last night and it came out great!  I cut out a few things because I didn't have them at home.  I made it without the wine, onion, and adobo seasoning.  I added a little bit of hot sauce to give it a kick.  Came out great!  I served it over whole wheat pasta for dinner.  Next time I willl seve over rice......but we just happened to not have any rice this time!  Great recipe, will be making again!

I made a few mods - Turkey sausage, olive oil, one can garbanzo and one can black beans. I had a red pepper and onion flake seasoning on hand so I used that and only used the adobo seasonings (homemade) along with a full 15.5 oz. can of Muir Glen Tomato sauce. Everyone is spot on with let it simmer! Delicious.

I used turkey sausage instead of the smoked kind.  My tomato sauce came in an 8 oz. can.  This made a great supper meal with a salad!  Thanks!

Even my toddler loves it! I grabbed the spicy smoked sausages by mistake so I didn't add the extra spice. Wonderful leftovers.

We enjoyed this meal.  I doubled the tomato sauce (8 oz) and forgot to use the sherry.  I'm sorry- I didn't check the spice amounts.  Added a little Cajun seasoning to the whole pot and extra on hubby's bowl.  It was very good!  I will make this again :)

I doubled the recipe, used beef sausage and didn't have any garbanzo beans so we did without and it was great.  We ate it over rice.

I scaled this down to 3 servings, but used about 2/3 of a 15oz can of tomato sauce. It was a little bit boring, but very hearty and filling. We had it over white rice. Thanks!

I substituted ham as I did not have any smoked sausage in the house. It turned out great! As well I used a homemade adobo seasoning for which the recipe can be found on this site. Excellent recipe and I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

Very good as is. However, the 2nd time I wanted to use up some stuff I had on hand, and it was even better! I doubled the recipe to have enough for lunch, and added a couple of stalks of celery, several cloves of fresh garlic, a bunch of chopped fresh parsley, and topped it with fresh cilantro. Also, I didn't have sherry, so I added white port. Mmmm... so good. I will definitely make this again.

Great flavor!...though we found it a bit to salty.  Suspect it was the Adobo as I didn't add any salt.  (or perhaps the canned bean syrup?)  Anyway, I would cut back on the Adobo next time and perhaps dilute the syrup with a little water.  Otherwise, I enjoyed it.

This was so good over rice. I thought it was going to be too strong, but it was just right. I simmered it for the hour. The only thing I changed since I don’t like powder, I used fresh chopped garlic. Leftovers are going to be great for lunch this week!

I made this exactly as the recipe states to do and it was SO SALTY it was nearly inedible.  Perhaps there is adobo without salt?  Because with the salty sausage and then 3 teaspoons of a "seasoning" that is essentially salt it was gross.  I should have known better--250mg of sodium in a QUARTER teaspoon.  
I will make it again with something instead of Adobo.

Thought it was very good.   I made it as directed but I might have been a little generous with the spices.  I used turkey smoked sausage vice traditional smoked sausage.  Left overs the next day were even better.  The beans seem to take on the smoke flavor of the sausage.

Delicious and easy. I made 2 stews at the same time: 1 with chorizo and 1 with andouille sausage just to see what the difference tastes were and both were delicious. I would do this again just b/c it was perfect with cold weather and so easy!

My husband was in dire need of change from Thanksgiving foods and we had some smoked sausage to use up (from the polish deli...not the typical salty and processed smoked sausage in big grocery stores). He really liked this dish and it was so easy to make! Since I didn't have low or no sodium ingredients on hand, I reduced the Adobo seasoning in half and would probably just add 1 tsp of it next time and add additional if needed. Also, to reduce heat I cut the red pepper down to 1 tsp and it was still a little bit spicy on its own, but not too bad when eating it over the steamed rice. Recipe is easily modifiable based on your taste preference for salt and heat. I let it simmer for about 1.5 hours. This recipe will definitely be made again.

I was looking for a recipe with smoked sausage and came across this one. I did not have tomato sauce, so I used canned diced tomatoes and simmered a couple of hours. It was great!  Served with yellow rice and garlic yucca. What a perfect Cuban meal.

This was very good with great potential.  How anyone could say this is "bland" is beyond me.  The flavors were fantastic, just a bit too much.  We like spicy and well-spiced foods but we thought this was too spiced.  I kept the measurements according to the recipe thinking that I would have to add more because I typically do.  It was too salty (I guess because of the Adobo?  This was my first time using Adobo and didn't know what to expect.)  The next time I make it, I think I will halve the spices and work from there.  Maybe all Adobo is not created equal?  Definitely a keeper!

My husband who is a picky eater loves this recipe. The only thing I change is I use less tomato sauce than the recipe calls for. Yum!

Made a few changes, the ones I made because I didn't have the ingredients were excluding the sherry and the adobo seasoning...instead of that I added some cumin, chili powder, and paprika

Also added fresh garlic (still kept the garlic powder too) and about 1/4 of a green bell pepper

I served it with some brown rice and will definitely make again

This recipe is awesome!! I ended up doubling the recipe. Along with the 1lb of smoked sausage, I added 1lb of ground chorizo. I also drained most of the water from the chickpeas. Another substitution I made was using a full 12 oz jar of Sofrito instead of the tomato sauce. Everyone is bragging on this one! Thanks for posting!

This is very good, and a pleasant surprise as I'm not a fan of chick peas (do simmer for an hour or more as suggested and they will tender up). Was looking for a recipe as I had mild Italian pork sausage on hand, added a tbs of liquid smoke, but next time will buy the smoked sausage, it might even be better! Used only one teaspoon of red pepper flakes as suggested here and it was spicy enough for our spice-loving family. Also substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce as I served it over white rice and wanted a little more juice. Will make again!

This was so delicious! I've been looking for this recipe for years, as I have close Cuban friends who've made it for get togethers.  I made a few changes, but kept the measurements more or less. It was a hit for dinner. Thank you so much!

This is a staple now. Best to let it simmer at least an hour. The leftovers are even better the next day. May want to tone down the red pepper flakes and adobo for kids.  Also, the 2nd time, I subbed Mama Socorro's all natural taco seasoning for the adobo, because it was handy.  Tasted the same.

Was disappointed at first, too salty, too spicy, but thought it had great potential, we made the folllowing changes and loved it. adobo and red pepper flakes to taste. we added one green peppper, a clove of garlic to the onion base as well as a chopped seeded tomato. drain the beans, replace the liquid with chicken broth and we added one diced potato into the mix, let it cook for an hour till the potatoes were temder and it was great!

I made this recipe tonight and all 5 of the kids liked it, including myself. It was very quick and simple as I had almost all the ingredients in my pantry already. Instead of tomato sauce, I used stewed tomatoes. I did not have sherry or marsala. I served it over a bed of steamed greens and rice.

Really liked this as a base recipe.  I doctored as I do all recipes depending on what I have on hand.  Added a red pepper with onion, can of no salt added tomatoes, cumin, paprika, lime zest and used fresh garlic in place of powder.  Right before serving I added a few handfuls of spinach/kale mix and a little lime juice and fresh parsley.  Served over rice with avocado, sour cream and hot sauce.

Very, very good recipe! I read the comments about it being too spicy, but that's a matter of taste. My husband likes spicy food, this will be one of his favorite dishes. I prefer less spicy, but I didn't find the flavor overwhelming. I made a couple changes... I substituted a can of black beans for half of the garbanzo. I also rinsed and drained the beans and used 15 ounces of tomato sauce instead. I like juices! I had no adobo seasoning so I substituted 1 tablespoon of Franks hot sauce, and bumped the garlic powder to 1 teaspoon. I do think cooking time needs to be at least 1 hour to blend the flavors. Serve this over hot cooked rice and it is amazing. Thank you for the recipe!

Wonderfully flavorful dish!!  Followed the easy recipe pretty closely (simmered 90 mins).  I questioned the need for the addl' oregano & garlic powder since those two are essential parts of adobo seasoning.  Anyway... loved the dish!  Simple, inexpensive comfort food & ingredients we normally always have on hand.  Of course it was even better the next day after all the goodies stewed & refrigerated overnight. I added a chopped red bell pepper for color & I plan to try this again w/ a zucchini.

It was very good,  I'll just take out the red pepper flakes for next time.  It was way too spicy.

I really love this recipe. I serve it with sliced avacodo on top. I didn't have chorizo but I had a hamhock so I used that instead and the flavor was still great. I do want to try it with the chorizo next time though. Instead of the liquid in the can, I used beef broth, it worked well. This is definitely a family favorite and my kids loved it which is the true test!

We love garbanzos and I was looking for a different way to fix them. This is very good.
