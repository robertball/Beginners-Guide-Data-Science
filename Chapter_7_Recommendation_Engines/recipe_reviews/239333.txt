I was confused by the recipe.  The only Idahoan potatoes I'm familiar with are instant granules.  If this is the one that was meant, the confusion was whether to rehydrate the potatoes and use 1 cup of those, or use one cup of t he granules which would see to take up all the liquid.  I chose to hydrate the potatoes.

However the flavor was very good and the bread is nice and soft.  This recipe did not make very large loaves.

I made the recipe as written and believe reviews should be left as such.  The reviews are correct regarding the confusion involved in the recipe (dry flakes or already made).  I've made a lot of bread over the course of time (family owned bakeries), and the ratio seemed off to me, but , if you make this with dry flakes, your bread will be TOO DRY, will take forever to rise, and your best bet would be to use a Kitchen Aid to knead it as it would be a real pain to try to get this to work for you with dry potato flakes.  Your liquids would virtually be sucked out of the equation. My suggestion would be to follow suggestions involving making the mashed potatoes and using a cup of already made mashed potatoes OR adding more liquid if you've progressed forward and realized this wasn't working out for you.  I agree that it can use a bit more sugar.  This recipe has 4 1/2 cups of flour when approximately 3 cups makes a loaf.  I just think that there isn't clarity in the ingredient category which can be clarified better as stated by other reviewers. Regardless, if you wait long enough, your bread will actually rise if you made it the way it seemed to direct, but it might not produce the kind of bread you were hoping to achieve.

I too was confused at first whether the recipe called for dry flakes, or prepared instant flakes. Having made other bread and cake recipes using potatoes, and looking at the water to flour ratio, I decided prepared potatoes would be the best.  I did not hand knead, but used my KitchenAid mixer to knead the dough on speed 2 for about 3 minutes. The recipe produces a rich flavor and a soft, almost moist texture. While the loaves are a little on the small side, they would be perfect for toast and jam or breakfast breads, or just to eat slathered with butter. Additionally, I brushed the tops with butter directly after removing them from the oven, to accomplish a soft buttery top. (I do this with almost all of my bread recipes)

This is a good bread. Instead of kneading, I made this in my Kitchenaid mixer.  I[m not sure if I did something incorrect, but I needed more water than called for.  It turned out very good.  Will probably make again.

Have made this several times now.  Made the first time exactly as written and it was delicious.  It is sooo good toasted with butter and marmalade or jam.  My son loves to make sandwiches with it.  I now switch out 2 cups of the AP flour for whole wheat flour for a nuttier flavor.  Super easy recipe to follow and has turned out perfect every time I've made it.

Very good.  I used the prior reviews and tweaked the recipe;  boiled the one potato I had with the salted water, added milk and butter to mash, added flakes and (separate) proofed yeast/sugar.  I doubled recipe; ended up using 9 cups flour, plus what was kneaded in for 8 minutes and, of course, more water.  Made 3 nice loaves.  I used a water bath during both rises and baking. Added butter to tops before and after baking.  I may freeze one to see how it works out.

I love this bread!! I diced & boiled regular potatoes, mashed them, & measured out 1 cup. It turned out great!! This may be my new “go-to” recipe for regular bread. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe made a very good dough but the problem came when I baked my loaves. They collapsed! I did some research and it appears the problem is the oven temp was not hot enough.  The loaves had reached their maximum rise and did not have time to set.

Fantastic recipe!  Next time I'll play with add-ins (whole wheat, flax meal, wheat germ, etc).  I spritzed the oven with water and buttered the tops for the last 20 minutes.  Made a lovely crust.

I added a little more sugar, 1c less flour and did the first part of the dough in my bread machine. I combined warm water, sugar and yeast and let it sit for 10min before adding the other ingredients and starting the machine. I punched it down and did the second rise without the machine then baked it in the oven. At 35min it came out a little too dark, so next time I will cook it a little less. I used a whole 113g packet of garlic potato flakes. It turned out pretty tasty!

I made  this bread recently and it was absolutely delicious.  The rise was perfect and it has a great crumb.  It has the soft tender texture of regular potato bread and my husband and I loved it!
