This recipe was so quick and easy, and so good!  I brined the pork chops but otherwise followed the recipe (decreasing the salt on the meat a bit because of the brining).  I will make this again. Thank you.

It turned out excellent. I forgot to buy fennel, so I used rosemary instead. Pork chops were tender.

We both loved this meal!  Very healthy as well as tasty!  The ground fennel and pepper add a wonderful background taste.
