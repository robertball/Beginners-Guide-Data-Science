I'm drinking this lemonade right now. It's really good! I used normal sugar and just waited a little while longer for it to dissolve. I'll make this again!

It tastes very good, but my 5 year old wanted to know why it was "brownish".  Next time I would probably use 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 white sugar.  I dissolved the sugar with a half cup of hot water & then added lots of ice.

S-O-U-R SOUR!  I used only five lemons and still was forced to add two cups of water and a 1/2 cup of white sugar to this recipe.  The brown sugar does give it a nice flavor, but the ratios of sugar, water, and lemon are extremely off on this one.

Good... but I used splenda instead of sugar. Daughter hated it and Son loved it. Oh Well. It was good.

I love this recipe, the brown sugar is what makes it! First I added the 1 1/2 cups water to the 1/2 cup brown sugar and stirred then let it sit. I used 5 lemons instead of 6 (I squeezed until I had about 1 cup of juice) and added this to the brown sugar and water inside of a pitcher. I tasted it after I was done and the tart after taste told me to add more water. Added the ice cubes and put in the fridge to chill. It's a hit at parties! Honestly, based on other reviews this seems to be a hit or miss based entirely on personal taste. Don't be afraid to experiment with different proportions and adding things. I know next time I am probably going to add some mint! Hope this helps!

The brown sugar was very interesting in this recipe! It was indeed tasty, I drank the whole thing and got a bit queasy x.x I personally prefer white suger, but it was definately worth a shot! Be sure to freeze lemon juice/lemonade for ice cubes so the drink you worked so hard for doesn't get watered down!

I made this yesterday and my husband didn't know what it was! I thought it was good, but I did change it after he was confused about the taste. I made a whole pitcher then added white sugar. It tasted so much better. The next time I make it, I think I'll start off with half brown sugar and half brown first. Also, I peeled some of the lemons and added them into the pitcher.

A good recipe.  Every lemonade needs to be adjusted to a person's taste preference.  I think the brown sugar adds good flavor.  I like the slight hint of molasses.

I used the brown sugar and the lemonade was awesome!  My three year-old son says "that's delicious!".  It looks a lot like iced tea, and would probably make a great addition to iced tea that needs lemon and sweetener.  Yum!

I thought this was really good.  It's more sour than some other lemonades I've tried, but in my opinion that's a plus.  My boyfriend wasn't a fan, though.  I think the brownish color was a turn off to him.  Oh well, next time I get to have the whole pitcher to myself!

I used homemade brown sugar, so it's darker than it probably should have been, but it still turned out GREAT. I always worry that a lemonade recipe will be too sweet for me, but this was great!

I used 3 lemons and 2 quarts of water. No ice; just chilled it in the fridge before serving. The brown sugar makes it really good!

Very good.  I used Meyer lemons from a friend's yard and I think that made a difference.  It was actually a little sweet for me and I added extra water.  I like the subtle taste of the brown sugar but I might stick to white sugar next time.

Perfect balance! 6 lemons and 1/2 cup of brown sugar works great. I did double that amount and added cold water (instead of ice) so that it would fill a half-gallon container.

This was a good recipe, but just not that delicious in my opinion, not somthing I'd want to make again. But overall it was good. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe but maybe just a 1/4 cup more of white sugar, a wonderdul contrast for a little more taste.

This was tasty, but the brown color made it somewhat  strange to look at. Next time I will use white sugar.
