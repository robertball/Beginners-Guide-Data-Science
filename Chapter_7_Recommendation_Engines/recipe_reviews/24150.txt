I made this for Easter brunch for 20 big Navy guys, they absolutly loved it.  I made two huge pans and they both came out perfect.  I was very happy that the middle did not come out soggy.  One of the pans I ended up baking a bit longer and it was still excellent.  I did make some modifications that went well.  I put almost a pound of mild cheddar cheese in each casserole.  Six slices was not nearly enough for my Wisconsin raised husband.  I didn't exactly trim the bread well and it didn't make a difference. All I used was one small onion for one of the casseroles.  3 seemed way to overpowering.  The other casserole I left without onion.  What I would suggest for others is spray the bottom of the pan with cooking spray just "incase".  Also, you can use less egg/milk and still end up with a good casserole.

This recipe was terrible.  3 Onions?  I used 2 and that was plenty.  But, the worst part was that the casserole was extremely soggy.  After cooking it for 2 hours (until the top and bottom were nearly black) the casserole was still very soggy in the middle.  (My oven temp. is accurate too.)  I think the recipe has potential.  Maybe use half of the milk.  I tried turning the oven down and letting it cook for 2 hours, so I do think it is a problem with the 4 cups of milk.  Still, I'm not daring enough to try it again.  What a waste.

This was excellent!  I served this on Christmas morning and everyone loved it. I used bacon and honey ham instead of bacon and sausage. I also used 8 oz. of extra sharp cheddar instead of american cheese.  This one's a keeper!

Out of five people at breakfast this Christmas morning, two really liked it, one didn't like the texture of the bread on the bottom, (me) two people didn't say, although they left it on their plate and didn't eat it.  I think they were being polite. I thought this was lacking something.  And buttering the bread????...I didn't see the point in that, since this is VERY fattening already.  I'd rate it one star, myself, but others thought it was good.

I made this during the holidays and my whole family really enjoyed it. I like having both the bacon and sausage together. It isn't the best for your arteries but it was the holidays so what the hay! I will make this again.

My husband's family always asks me to make this dish when we come to visit.  Also great to prepare the night before for Christmas breakfast.  It cooks while you are unwraping your gifts.

I love this recipe and make it ahead every Christmas morning. However I break into pieces a layer of bread to cover bottom of pan then layer the meat choices and cheese and repeat the 3 again(I dont measure it) then cover the dish with a mixture of beaten eggs diluted with milk. IT MUST SOAK OVER NIGHT IN FRIDGE! Bake at 350 til cooked thru center (about an hour) DELICIOUS

I used regular pork sausage and removed the casings and made sure to break it up to small pieces. I used real cheddar and added more on top as well. I topped with chives as well. This was excellent and hearty.  A make again for sure.

I made two versions of this recipe and made a few changes ... for an office party: everyone loved it! I did only use one small onion and added a small amount of chopped mushrooms. Be careful ... the more the mushrooms the more the casserole will be watery... Overall the original recipe is good... minus the onions.

I have been making this breakfast casserole for about the last 8 years.  My entire family loves it.  I have never once had a problem with it ever being soggy.  I do use less onion but other that that, it is great.  Sometimes I switch it up and use shredded cheese instead of cheese slices also.

This was really good. Since I keep kosher, I  substituted soy hot dogs for the sausage and imitation bacon bits for the bacon. I recommend using one onion, not three, and reducing the liquid to three cups milk and six eggs.

This recipe had promise... but the consistency of the bread and egg combo didn't go over so well with my family. Plus it was an expensive experiment, with the whole pound of bacon and pound of sausage. Something along these lines without the bread, or maybe something firmer in the casserole, might work.

This was def. not the most beautiful casserole, but it was yummy!  I changed a few things though to save a grocery trip- left out the onions and put one layer of ham and one layer of bacon.  Hungry teenagers devoured it in 5 minutes at church this morning!

I really liked this.  I halved the recipe and used 1 pound of bacon.  I buttered the casserole dish and that made it easy to remove.  I had no problem with wetness.  It does have a soggy texture but that's what it's supposed to be like.   I loved the flavor of the american cheese, different than shredded cheddar.  I did only use about 1 small vidalia onion cooked with the bacon.  I think the 1 1/2 would have been too much.

I rate it with the following changes; 8 eggs, 1 pkg. (8 oz.) of velvetta cheese, no onions, 8 pieces of bread- and the balance of the recipe is used.  Great casserole for a big crowd.

Most excellent?  Truth!  No matter how I change up the ingredients, or add to it, it's still the most excellent breakfast casserole the hubster ever liked!  Because it's just the two of us, I lowered the servings and the ingredient amounts, reduced the temperature to 375F, and reduced the cooking time to about 35 - 40 minutes (until golden brown on top.) I also generously buttered the casserole dish before adding all the ingredients because the first time I made it things tended to stick to the pan.  Mix it up: add onions cooked until transparent, add Rotel brand tomatoes and chilies, add chopped jalapenos or green peppers, add diced tomatoes, or your favorite vegetables  fresh from your garden.  You just cannot go wrong!  Enjoy!

I make this recipe often for Christmas and brunches.  I only use 2 cups half and half.  I also use either shredded or cubed velveta cheese.  I also like the hot sausage in mine.  Remember to refrigerate overnight and keep covered with foil up to the last five or 10 minutes of the baking time.  1 hour 15 minutes at 375 degrees.

A few hints for anyone wanting to make this...I did saute the onions before I added them and I used approximately 2 cups of grated cheddar. I would definitely recommend spraying your dish. Other than the bread sticking to the dish it was fantastic! Very fluffy and tasty! Might try sauteed mushrooms next time...definitely going to make again.

Much to greasy and salty. I made a 2nd batch with more bread and egg beaters, no bacon, turkey sausage instead of pork sausage, and cheddar cheese, less onion.  It was just as tasty.

We made this the night before Christmas, and baked it while opening presents. Due to many heart conditions and a couple of vegetarians in our family, I made it with Soy Sausage and Soy bacon. It was very good! We had some left over and had it the next morning- the flavor was wonderful!! This is definitely a keeper in our recipe book!!!

I made this casserole last night for Christmas morning breakfast.  Upon reading the reviews, I did alter the recipe.  I used a thick fresh bread, but only covered the bottom of the pan with six slices.  I cut down the milk to 3 cups.  I placed ALL of the meat and cheese layer over top of the bread, added the milk/egg mixture, and cooked it about an hour at 375 degrees.  It was absolutely delicious and we all enjoyed it.  I think the amount of bread called for in original recipe is too much, but this amount was just right.  I hope my tip will help!

I made this for Christmas morning and was disappointed. Five of us ate one serving and no one wanted more because of the "water/liquid" that remained in the bottom of the baking dish. I dried "drying it out" in the oven but it didn't work. Won't do this one again.

I have a different, less breaded , but wonderful version of this. I have been making our “Christmas Casserole “ for over 40 years. It’s flavorful and delicious. I have added many things to it. My family would be sad if we didn’t have it each Christmas. However, It’s so easy that I make it several times each month.

Tasty but to many onions. We only used 3/4 of an onion not 3 like it said. Next time we will cook the onions along with the sausage as well. Otherwise turned out great!

This turned out great! I did make the following changes: 3 cups buttermilk instead of 4 cups regular milk, sharp cheddar instead of processed cheese. I made two smaller casseroles using two 6x6 aluminum pans. I let one pan cook for 40 mins, and it wasn't soggy at all. It's pretty heavy, so I'll reserve it for special occasions. It was yummy!

It's only 4 stars b/c dad didn't think it was awesome. I made a few changes: had maple sausage links, used em. Cooked bacon & sausage in oven at 400 °F for 20 min and used heavy cream and milk. I did utilize the previous reviews and decreased the liquid to about 2-1/2 c. b/c I sort of 3/4'd the recipe.I added spinach that I wilted in olive oil with the onions, before adding to the meat mixture. I only had string cheese, not mozzarella.  DON'T do this, it doesn't melt. I did use shredded cheddar not American slices. And no French bread so i dried out cubed potato bread slices in the oven. I guess I did make more than a few changes!  Anyway, this was totally delicious and we ended up eating it with syrup on the top. I know, I didn't think that would be right, either, but it worked! Leftovers are awesome after a few secs in the microwave

I loved this recipe because it didn't have potatoes in it.  The bread makes it so fluffy and smooth.  I used mushrooms instead of peppers(for my husband) and used no cheese(for myself) and it still turned out delicious.  I'll be putting this one in the recipe bank!

Ok..... so after reading other reviews I did reduce the milk and eggs to 3 cups milk and six eggs. I also put the eggs and milk in a blender wth a little garlic powder, onion powder, prepared mustard (had no powder) and black pepper before pouring on the casserole. I used one 12 oz package bacon and one 8 oz package of chicken sausage links cut up into bite sized pieces. I used all 12 slices of bread, buttered them all and put them on a cookie sheet, baking them for about 10 minutes on 200 degrees to toast them up a little. Then I cut them into cubes and layered per the recipe. The only other thing I did different was cooked this at 375 degrees for one hour covered and then 15 minutes uncovered. Then I let it set for another 15 before serving. I soaked it overnight in the fridge per the recipe and omitted the onion only because we had an onion heavy dinner the night before. I would think you could really customize this using some sautéed onion mushroom spinach etc to your liking. The main issue with this recipe for most people I think (after reading other reviews) is that the bread is a little soft and almost like a French toast recipe. Baking this immediately  and not soaking over night would probably help as would reducing the milk and eggs to a ratio of one cup of milk (or half and half) to every four eggs like in a quiche. Or use sturdier bread instead of sandwich bread. Overall we really liked this casserole. Great flavor and good consistency for us. Will make again!

Great that you can make this dish the night before. Next time I think I will make it with more veggies and some good crusty rustic bread.

Made this according to the directions and it was WAY too wet and too much onion.   It probably needs less liquid and to be uncovered partway through cooking.  The ingredients certainly all seem like it would make a good dish, but read through other reviews with all recommendations on how to make this dish better before you try it the first time.

We cooked for Christmas Breakfast and we cooked for an hour and the top was black and the bread was soggy the bacon and sausage were good but I would recommend not to use bread
