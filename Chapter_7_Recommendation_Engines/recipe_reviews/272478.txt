This did not turn out as flavorful as I would have liked. The Korean paste has a great flavor; the next time I will increase the amount I use and use paprika to spice it up more.

It was delicious!!  I added more garlic than it called for. And I tripled the sauce recipe because in my family-we love the sauce!

I made these just as written.  It was very simple and delicious.  My husband and I both thought they were great.  On the side we had fried rice w/stir fried veggies and the Asian Cole Slaw from this site.  I will definitely make them again.
