It's rich - but we all could stand something to make our hair stand on end.  I prefer sweet (vidalia or maya) onions to red ones and since I so seldom have heavy cream on hand I substituted sour cream and used real sugar - what the heck - one teaspoon of sugar is a small indulgence considering all of the cholesterol, right?  BUT I can say that only because I divorced my diabetic second husband LOL.
All things in moderation and live life!

Made a good creamy soup. I added another can of tomatoes as did another reviewer. 
My only question is this:
Blue cheese, cream cheese, milk, heavy craem, then Splenda? What's the point? It' like having a triple bacon cheese burger, giant fries, and ordering a Diet Coke. Not much sense

Okay so it's rich, high in calories, cholesterol, blah blah blah. Make this soup and I promise you won't care a fig about any of that... it's Amazing! A wonderfully delicious comfort food that is also company-worthy should you want an impressive first course at your next dinner party. Good job Chrystal!

This was tasty but very cheesy...I tasted it and decided I would prefer a little more tomato flavor so I added a second can of tomatoes. that made it perfect for me thanks for the recipe. I pureed this in the blender and used lower fat ingredients

Delicious! However, don't expect the soup to look like your typical red tomato soup; it's quite pink from all the cream/milk/cream cheese.

I used 6 oz feta instead of 1/4 cup blue cheese and 1/2 cup vitamin D milk instead of the mixture of heavy cream and milk.  The soup was easy and quick to make, but a little flavorless.  It needed a lot of salt added to it, which I don't really like to do.

This was very good, but missing something. I think I will crumble some fried bacon into the leftovers.

Made this earlier this week.  Wanted to make a larger amount, and due to lack of all the ingredients, I modified slightly.  

Doubled all the ingredients except the diced tomatoes (only had one can) and tomato juice  (tripled).  After heating it up completely in step 2, I let it simmer for about 90 minutes to thicken up.  

Turned out great.  Next time I will add some diced celery .

I knew I'd love this soup and I did!  I followed the recipe except for the red onion, which I didn't have, so I used a Vidalia onion instead.  Great soup!!

I substituted feta for blue cheese because that's what I had.  I omitted the garlic due to an allergy.  Even with those changes, this is delicious.  I suspect it would be even better had I followed the instructions.
I made it again with blue cheese and it was even better!  Next time, I will add some cayenne, I think.

Loved the soup! Did not have 4 oz. of cream cheese so used what I had (probably 1-2 oz.) . Seemed creamy enough though did increase heavy cream to 1/3 cup; did not add any sweetener as caramelized the onions. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely loved this soup. Made it for my picky parents and they also loved it! Only added some fresh parmesean shavings for a garnish. Thank you for this recipe!
