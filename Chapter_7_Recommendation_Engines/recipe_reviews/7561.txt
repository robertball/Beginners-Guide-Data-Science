This is a very tasty caramel frosting. I did add 1/4 cup of powdered sugar. The recipe didn't state how much to add, but this amount seemed sufficient.

This recipe is extremely misleading.  This make a glaze or a drizzle, not a fluffy frosting as the photo implies.  Bad adverstising!

Good flavor but very thin consistency.  Definitely not as pictured.  Omit the extra cream and add powdered sugar.

This is a really tasty recipe!  It didn't yield as much as I wanted it to, but I'm sure this could be remedied by simply doubling the recipe (I only had enough to decorate the outer edges of 24 mini cupcakes).  Pair it with a good chocolate cake and you're good to go!

This was great!  I opted not to add the powdered sugar and used this as more of a sauce/drizzle.  Very good flavor and consistency!  Will make again.

Made this recipe twice.  Turned out great both times, even though it was only my first and second times making caramel frosting in my life!  If I can do it, you can too!

I made this recipe just as directed and it turned out wonderful I did I add about a half cup of powdered sugar and beat it with the beaters. It however didn’t make as much as I wanted for two dozen cupcakes so I added some butter cream cream cheese frosting that I’d made too much of for different cupcakes. When mixed together the frosting was the most amazing I’ve ever made! People were fighting over the cupcakes at the wedding reception!

Two stars because I made a slight error. Did not turn out as pictured.
