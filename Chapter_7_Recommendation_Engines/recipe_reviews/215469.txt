ooo, just not my favorite. I removed the mint, added instead some lemon and some black olives chopped up real small, and another clove of garlic and some hotsauce. it was to DIE for. 

My neighbor liked this recipe though. She said she'd use it many more times.

Can I rate my own recipe? Hope so! This is a cool and fresh dip for veggies or your favorite chips. There is just something about mint and garlic that I LOVE! With the addition of thick creamy Greek yogurt you can't beat it!

I followed the advice of others and skipped the mint (may try it another time . . . ). I thought this was quite good - very light and creamy! I served it with cut-up raw veggies for a delicious and healthy appetizer.

I just tried this recipe, and it smelled so light and fresh as I was blending it up, that I just couldn't wait to taste it. I know that the recipe says to let it set in the fridge overnight, but I went ahead and had a little right away, but I'm sure it'll taste better tomorrow. I left out the mint because I just really don't like that, and I substituted about a tablespoon of green onion instead of regular onion (I didn't want to cut up an entire onion just for 1TB)... It is fantastic! the only thing I'm going to change next time is a smidge less lemon juice -- that actually is taking over a bit. I do have one question though -- the recipe says 6 servings -- how much is a serving?

Tasty! I also skipped the mint. I didn't have the yogurt, so that was omitted too. I added a beef steak tomato, the juice from one lime, and two chopped basil leaves. It was soooo good! Next time, I will make sure to add the yogurt. It sounds tasty!
