Final outcome didn't look exactly like the photo. Also make sure you use an 8x8 or smaller pan. I used an 8x8 and the recipe didn't feel even-- as if I should've gone with a bit smaller pan. Recipe tasted good but again for adding the cauliflower it still seems like a fairly unhealthy recipe.

My family enjoyed this macaroni cauliflower dish. We made our own macaroni pasta, delicious!

I did a couple things different. But this is wonderful my entire family loved it. Instead of baking I just made it in a pot on stove. I used sour cream instead of cream cheese but I will try the cream cheese next time. I also made the Panko on the side and sprinkled it on top of the plates once dishes up.

Big hit with my family.  I modified the recipe a bit based on what I had in the kitchen.  I used buttermilk instead of regular milk  and reduced the cream cheese.  I also used  riced cauliflower.

I'm a total newbie chef and when I came across this recipe, I saw everything I liked.  I did add garlic powder and paprika to my batch to make it a little more flavorful.  But this is a great base to start with.  

This also tastes amazing when you reheat it.  I'm definitely going to keep making this one!
