The first time I made this I thought is was too sweet and my husband commented that it tasted like cough syrup. The second time I made this I halved the amaretto and it turned out much better. A splash of ginger ale or Sprite wouldn't be a bad idea either.

I ordered this in a restaurant (not by name I doubt they would have known what it was) and it was sickeningly sweet. I would try it again with some additions... maybe some sour mix to cut the sweet.

This was great. Next time I will try using equal amounts of amaretto and cranberry juice.

Interesting drink. I am in the middle--I'm not sure I liked it but I was glad for the opportunity to try it.

Too sweet with amaretto. I first knew this drink as cranberry juice with Southern Comfort and fresh lime juice.

Love this drink. It is super easy and not overly sweet. I added a splash of club soda for a hint of carbonation but it great either way.

Loved it! Just enough tangy and sweet to balance each other out.
