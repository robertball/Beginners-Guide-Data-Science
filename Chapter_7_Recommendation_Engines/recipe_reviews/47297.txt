HMMM...the jury is still out on this one.  I love blueberries and add them to my smoothies when I have them on hand.  I used blueberry yogurt...so I'm wondering if that was a mistake. I like my smoothies to be on the sweeter side, but will play around with this one.

This had a very funky purple look, which made it really fun for breakfast. I did use frozen (slightly thawed) blackberries instead of canned and raspberry yogurt. I also added a dash of vanilla and a dash of milk to get it easier to blend and swallow. Very good beverage for breakfast!

This is a very very easy recipe.  It's hard, though, to get the ice and fruit all crushed up together.  It's yummy once you get it in your glass.  Truly took 5 mins to prepare!
