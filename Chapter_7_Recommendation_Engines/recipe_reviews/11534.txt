This is a great recipe!  I've been to two cookie parties in the past week and these cookies were a huge hit.  I use the following ways to cut down on clean-up. I use parchment paper, a rolling pin, a pizza cutter and a 3x5 index card.
Wrap a piece of parchment paper around the log.  Roll flat with the rolling pin.  A 3x5 index card makes a nice tool for measuring width. Sprinkle almonds onto dough, press down into dough with parchemnt paper.  Bake on parchement paper and voila! no clean-up. TEN minutes after removing from oven, use pizza cutter to cut strips into diagonals.  Use a good quality ziplock bag to ice cookies.  Put icing in bag, press out air, close and cut a TEENY hole in one corner. Again, no clean-up!

Wonderful!  These were not only amazing to eat, but they also smelled terrific.  I doubled the almond extract (I LOVE the smell/taste of almonds...so if you're a big almond fan, I recommend this) and ended up adding an extra egg because my dough wasn't moist enough.  This gave the cookies an even lighter consistancy and REALLY made them melt in your mouth.  I will be making these again soon...thanks for the recipie!

These were so easy, and SO good.  They were a hit at my brother's birthday party and disappeared pretty quickly.  I used 3/4 cup of Trader Joe's Almond Meal in place of 3/4 cup the flour to give it more of an almond flavor.  I also doubled the amount of almond extract in the cookies and in the icing.  Mmmm almondy!

I found this recipe a while back in a cookbook and made it as part of my Christmas baking. Everybody always raved about it. This year I had moved and packed away my recipes so I couldn't make it. Fortunately, I found this recipe again and can make it for next year (if I still haven't unpacked my other recipes!). Thanks Marji for providing this great cookie recipe!

Marji, THANK YOU!  You have brought a very happy memory to life and, if my Norwegian grandmother (who died 30 years ago today, not realizing her dream of making me a baker) were alive, she'd be doing handstands (at the ripe age of 115).  I finally made some MARVELOUS cookies (so marvelous that I forgot to make the icing!)!  The icing on the cake (no pun intended) is that they were a staple of our Norwegian family, and just the very first recipe that my grandmother tried to teach me.  Thank you for the melt-in-your-mouth. almost marzipan, recipe.  This will become a regular in our household (even without the nuts, which hubby can't eat -- I made half with and half without almonds).  An added plus is that my Canadian-Irish hubby said that they were "sex in a cookie".  I had to put them away so that there would be some left for tomorrow.  Mange takk, Marji!

These are very popular bars with friends as well as at a bake table for sale. Instead of icing, before baking I use an egg wash on the flattened logs, then sprinkle chopped almonds and Swedish Pearl Sugar.. they are pretty and less messy to store.

Thanks, Marji.  This is a great recipe.  My only change was to up the almond extract by 1/4 tsp. in both the dough and the icing (because I really like a pronounced almond flavor), & since I didn't have slivered almonds, I used crushed toasted unblanched almonds.

excellent recipe.  i added more almond extract as well (doubled).  i also divided almonds, used half as written in recipe then made sugared almonds by mixing almonds and a tablespoon of sugar in pan on stove (medium high heat) until sugar melted, coating the almonds, then spread on wax paper to cool.  after glazing cookies,  i sprinkled the coated almolds on top of glaze.

I'm afraid I'm going to be the odd ball here but I found these to be a bit boring even after glazing them.  Plus you have to eat them the first day or so because the get stale VERY FAST!  Wouldn't bother with them again.  Sorry

I make these cookies every year to give as part of my Christmas cookie tin gifts.  Everyone loves them and asks for the recipe.  They are one of my daugthers favorites as well and making them at Christmas has become a tradition for us.  Thanks Marji for posting the recipe!

Mmmm, these are SO good! Absurdly easy to make, and they are just delicious - chewy, light, not overly-sweet. I didn't even bother with the drizzle; they were fabulous without. I will definitely be adding this to (my very limited) Thanksgiving/Christmas cookie 'collection.' Thanks so much, Marji!

I have made these bars twice now and both times I have been disappointed. Although the flavour is nice, I find that the bars turn out with an almost raw like texture even with baking longer than stated. I dont think I will add this to my favourites list.

What a great cookie! I didn't have any almond extract, so I used vanilla extract instead. I was worried that this would take away from the flavor and make it taste too much like a regular sugar cookie, but it really tasted great! Also, I didn't have slivered almonds, just whole ones, so I chopped up a good amount using my food chopper and sprinkled that on top instead. Worked like a charm! Even my hubby, who is a picky eater and doesn't particularly like almonds, kept asking for one after the other. Also, I didn't use nearly as much icing as the recipe called for. I drizzled a little on very lightly and had quite a bit left over. I didn't want the cookies to come out too sweet, so using just a bit of icing worked great. I probably used only half.

great recipe! I put an extra teaspoon of almond extract in batter, which made the icing unnecessary.

First time making them and they turned out PERFECT- a little extra almond extract went in but it worked out in the cookie's favor!  (ended up being a full teaspoon) Unlike the other review saying they had to add an egg bc it was too dry, the consistency was spot on for me.

For awhile I was making cookies every two weeks to mail to my boyfriend. These turned out the best and lasted the best in the mail. He really enjoyed them. I love the almonds and the drizzle that goes on top. Great recipe!

Very tasty, but you must eat them the same day!  As a previous poster mentioned, they do get stale VERY fast.  I did my baking the night before a big family party.  Very excited to bring them because I had taste tested them and was impressed with how yummy and soft they turned out.  Very upsetting though when I brought them to the party and realized how incredibly hard and stale they had become.  Hardly any were eaten.  :(  I won't be making this recipe again.

It's been a holiday tradition in my family for years. Everyone who has tried these always asks for the recipe, and they're just scrumptious. I'm an almond fan, so I increase the extract to 1 t.

I've made these cookies for many years.  My original recipe was from Better Homes and Gardens, but I somehow lost it.  I also use about 1/2 cup Trader Joe's almond meal when I have it and bake the cookies only about 10 minutes.  I think they are best when they are slightly underdone and have a softer consistency, reminiscent of marzipan.  I have never taken them anywhere where people have not clammered for the recipe.  I also think they may be better the day they are made, but I have never had them last longer. A 10 star recipe.

You know what.....these were REALLY GOOD.  I only made them because they didn't look too hard and I had almonds to use up.  I made them to take to the In-Laws, but ended up snatching a few for my own personal stash.  Surprisingly elegant considering their simplicity.  And yes, a pizza cutter does make the slicing bit easier.  Great cookie to have with coffee or tea...and the extras (if you have any) can be stored in the freezer.  Just let them sit out for a bit to thaw (doesn't take long).

I've made these bars six or seven times now and have added this recipe to my "favorites" recipe box.  Everyone in my family raves about them and prefers them to all other cookies and bars. I make the icing thicker by reducing the milk to 2 tablespoons and then drizzling it on.  To make them more colorful I tint the icing pink.  Wonderful recipe!

I've been making these cookies for a long time and get asked for them by coworkers all the time. ( I'm the baker at work ) I dont make them very often because I love them too!! But they are easy and great with a cup of coffee or tea because they aren't to sweet. Thanks so much for posting so I didn't have to dig through old magazines for the recipe!

I have made this recipe at least 20 times, and every time people rave and ask for the recipe.  My family loves it, and I always have to make a double batch to even get through the night.  Really, really good.  I use creamer (1/2 & 1/2) for the top and a lot of almonds...more than the picture shows.  Love it!!

This is the most fantastic recipe, and really easy! It looks like you worked hard though! I drizzle a powdered sugar glaze over the cookies in different colors depending on the occasion: ie: red & green @ Christmas, pastels in the spring. It is one of our all-time favorites, and even won second place in a Taste of Home magazine!

I am so glad to have found this recipe. I had it for a few yrs, then in my move it got "lost".. The original was in Taste of Home magazine.
Being of Scandinavian descent, almonds are so popular & well used in baking..these always go over well with the family. I decorate up containers and give as xmas gifts..
I used parchment paper on the cookie sheets which made them easy to manuever off the cookie sheets...
thank you thank you for posting this recipe..

Great cookies and simple to make.  I'm glad that I doubled the recipe!  I drizzled mine with melted chocolate instead of the icing, but I think they are great either way.

very easy to make cookies.  They smelled wonderful baking and I cut them with a pizza cutter.  I didn't have the almonds to spinkle on top, so I made the glaze as called for and then added some juice from fresh red raspberries I had.  Wonderful addition!  I think next time I'll roll them out and cut out for a shaped cookie.

These are DELICIOUS. I made exactly as ingredients stated  except I added a bit extra almond to the icing. I rolled on Parchment paper than pulled it on to the cookie sheets. Rolled with rolling pin was faster and easier, then cut with a knife. Cut them again while hot. ROLL THIN for best "crunch" results. My hubby loves these, as do I. Thanks Marji.

Looked so good, I couldn't wait for the holidays to make them.  Easy and delicious--and nice appearance.  Excellent even without the glaze, so I did half with and half without.  Will definitely make again--probably soon!

Don't skip the icing on these. It really makes them! I've been making these for years. I usually add a little extra almond extract to the icing.

Wow! I can't believe how amazing these turned out! They are soft the first day, hard the next and oh so good. I doubled the almond extract and skipped the glazing and they were perfect- not too sweet. Thank you for this great recipe!

I made these for a gift.  They were lovely in a gift basket.  But, they don't keep very well.  I tasted them a couple of days after I made them and they were a little stale.

These are my favorite cookies to make for a reception or similar event.  They are easy to make, taste great and look very pretty on a tray of cookies.  The glaze dresses them up and makes them attractive, but the taste is fine without the glaze. They also freeze well (they don't stick together).

These are wonderful! Perfect for tea, or really anytime. I'm going to use a pizza cutter next time which I think will make it easier to cut in diagonal lines. I've had many, many requests for the recipe.

I've been making these for years and they are the best! They are my standard Holiday cookie, and everyone always asks for them. Taste and look like you slaved away, but they are pretty simple. The recipe also doubles well, which is important because otherwise my husband eats so many I don't have enough to give away!!

I got A LOT of compliments on these cookies and they were super easy to make and smelled and looked yummy! (Personally, I'm not sure on taste since I'm dieting and didn't sample).  I'm only giving them a 4 however. The glaze was extremely watery.  I had to add much more sugar than the recipe called for to thicken it to get it to a better consistency to work with.  As a result, also had to add more almond extract (that's okay though, we LOVE almond flavor).  I think in the future, I'll need to start with 1 Tb milk and keep adding until desired consistency is reached.  Also, the bars should be refrigerated to help set the glaze and keep them tasting fresher longer so they don't taste stale.  Aside from that, I think I found my Christmas Cookie Exchange Recipe for this year!

A very nice cookie indeed.  I made them for my mother.  She is in a home because of a broken hip at this time.  My mother grewup poor and has done or knows about everything to make and not buy at the store.  She liked thedes and that is all that matters to me.

Easy to make.  I divided it into three batches so they were thicker (although I also ate a lot of the dough).  These are very elegant and much easier to make than appears.  I left off the icing, as I found they were sweet enough.

I love almonds and this had the flavor and taste. It seems like no one mention how sticky and messy it was rolling the dough out was though. I didn't really like that part. Of course, brushing them off with milk does flatten it.

Oh my gosh! These cookies are simply delicious! One of my family's favorite flavors is almond and these are amazing.  Light, crisp yet tender, and so almondy (probably not a word). :)  I needed one more batch of cookies for Christmas cookie trays and thought I'd be adventurous and try something new.  So glad I picked these.  They will now be added to my list of favorite cookies to make for the Holidays.  Thank you so much for sharing your family recipe.

I wanted to try this because my husbands family is swedish.  I added an extra 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the batter and rolled them  out on parchment paper and then transfered to cookie sheet.  They came out so good  I will be making these every year for my cookie tray

Excellent!  I sliced and re-baked mine... like biscotti. 
In order to get some almond slices to stick on them I thickened the icing and drizzled it across.  They couldn't have been any better!  Thank you for sharing!

Used it like graham crackers for a cherry pie crust and it was awesome!  A perfect balance of sweets and flavors.  As a cookie though -- I thought they were a little dry and really couldn't make up my mind if I liked them or not.  My husband really liked them.  He generally doesn't like sweets, where I do, so my guess is how people will like these is up to that.  Oh, and they were very fast and easy to make.

These take a little bit of time to make and I made quite a mess with the glaze, but they are delicious and quite addicting!

I found this recipe in my very first Taste of Home issue, many years ago, and it's one of our favorites.  The cookies have a wonderful flavor.  And they're pretty, too.

Couldn't find a copy of my recipe and thought I would be without this year. So, I was thrilled to see this recipe here. I've been making these every year for Christmas as long as I can remember. Easiest cookie recipe - therefore, the one that ALWAYS gets made. But they look like you really worked hard to make them - and Delicious!!

I used this recipe for a party, and everyone loved it!  I ended up not having any allspice or almond extract, so I substituted vanilla extract, and a total 1/4 teaspoon combined of cinnamon, cardomon and nutmeg.  The cookies turned out just chewy enough, and not too sweet.  The recipe was just right.  Definately something easy that I'll make again.  Thanks!

Didn't make any changes.  I had problems rolling it out... but it turned out ok anyway.  Mine doesn't look as good as picture.  It's extremely sweet....
It's good, but too sweet.  Don't know if I'll make it again.

I made these incredible almond bars tonight and must say they were perfect. I did as others suggested and doubled the almond extract but next time I will only use 1.5 times or 3/4 tsp. One tsp was a bit too strong IMO. Here's one major tip to greatly simplify the process! Forget rolling out 4 separate pieces of dough, instead press the entire batch into a 9x13 pan, brush the milk on and sprinkle the almonds. DONE!

Yub nub! (Ewokese from "Star Wars") You can taste the almond flavour flowing through the cookie, Mmm! To reach that strength; however, I needed to be generous with more almond extract in both the icing and the cookie, otherwise, the main flavour lies dormant. Almonds and extract are what made this 5 stars! :)

I express my appreciation that I didn't have leftovers of the icing, either. I know it is difficult to exact the proportions when publishing recipes, so either a baker has a surplus of leftover frosting or contrariwise. But there was comfortably enough for all the cookies and nothing more. (Of course, I flattened the dough thinly, thus there was much area)

Delicious! I added an additional 1/4 tsp almond extract to the bar dough and the frosting as another reviewer suggested because we love almond, and they were excellent. I added too much frosting on my first batch, they truly just need a light drizzle. Brought them to a dinner party and they were a huge hit! Thank you for posting the recipe!

Delicious!  I made this exactly as the recipe was written and wouldn't change a thing!  It's a very nice change from the overly sweet Christmas cookies and very easy.  It's just as delicious without the icing.

Excellent!! I was looking through recipes trying to find this type and when the Marji Stark name appeared (my maiden name and also had an aunt with this name) I knew this was the one. Texture 5 Ease 5 Flavor 5 + I also used it as a crust for a lemon curd .... Amazing! Thank you Marji!

My only suggestion in to use more sliced almonds.

These are very easy, very fast, and really delicious.  I only give a 4 because I made a few changes.  I had no almond extract, and am not really crazy about it, so I used vanilla.  I also didn't add the glaze to the top, instead sprinkling about a tablespoon of turbinado sugar over the milk and almonds.  

They are elegant looking, very good and only took about 20 minutes start to finish.  I altered the shape, simply pressing the cookie dough into the bottom of a cookie sheet.  They are not terribly sweet, but are crunchy and nutty, and a bit chewy inside.  My hubby approves!!

I was so glad to find this. These cookies were a part of our family tradition for years until the recipe was lost. The only thing I do differently was to omit the frosting we always enjoyed it without. Thank you for posting this recipe we can now enjoy a family tradition again:-)

Recipe mixes up extremely well. Easy to construct using baking paper! Please don't overtake and after applying the drizzled icing let sit to harden well or they may stick together if stacked.
No almond slices, pound some whole almonds a bit. 

We made up a batch as round cookies topped with leftover cooked cranberries in the center of each and the grated rind of a large orange in the dough. Just amazing!

They reminded me of an almond sugar cookie... Having said that, it was really good. Our family really enjoyed them and I think they would be just as good without the glaze. Best straight out of the oven, but good with coffee when they are no longer warm and soft.

Great cookie and sooo easy to make once you tweak the recipe to your taste. I doubled the almond extract on my second batch because there was not enough almond flavor.  I also left off the glaze, which I found made them much too sweet.

I just made this recipe today. I followed the recipe exactly, including the icing. The cookies are good, but the icing was too runny, so I added a little more confectioners sugar. Still too runny, but because I have never made them before, decided to go for it. The icing sunk into the cookies and disappeared. I don't know if they are going to make the cookies soggy; I'll have to wait and see. Next time I will also double the almond extract as suggested.

I just made a "test batch" of these cookies to see if they would be good enough for my annual Christmas cookies gift bags. I tried them out on random cookie testers (friends) for objective opinions, and they all agreed that they are good! A few notes: They needed the full baking time in my oven and heavy aluminum baking pans, maybe even 16 minutes. Being a little on the crispy side is better. I might add a touch more almond flavoring next time, but not much. I thought 12 cookies per bar was a bit unrealistic. I cut mine in "normal" sizes and got 8 or 9, not counting the odd-shaped end pieces. I felt that the glaze made them a little TOO sweet for my tastes, and will also make them more difficult to store without sticking together. I might leave that off next time. It should definitely go on when they are totally cool. Putting it on earlier seems to make them a bit soggy. I loved the crispiness and the crunch of the almonds on top. For taste and simplicity, this recipe is great.
