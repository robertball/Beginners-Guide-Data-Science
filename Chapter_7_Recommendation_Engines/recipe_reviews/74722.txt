You could make it virgin using artifical rum-extract, same taste as real rum.

Made this for Recipe Group...We LOVED this!!!!! This was so refreshing and delicious! I used white peaches, and instead of using ice cubes, I just chunked up the peaches and froze them before proceeding w/ the recipe, which worked perfectly and didn't water the drink down. With summer fast approaching, this is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Recipe Group Selection:  11, May 2013 ~ This is a delicious and refreshing summer time drink.  The grocery only had small white flesh peaches, so I used 5 of them in place of 3 large.  I did as Christina suggested and froze my peach chunks before making the drink, thus eliminating the ice cubes.  We loved the tartness that the limeade provides in this drink.  The skin of the peach adds pretty flecks and color in the glass and added a little texture to the drink.  For me, ¾ c. of spiced rum was a little much.  When I make it this summer, I will be cutting it back to ½ c.  Great selection this week and just in time for the warm summer weather.

I made this for Recipe Group on Mother's Day. Very good! I didn't really want to share any, but I did.  My grocery store only had medium size peaches, not the large size this recipe called for. For that reason, I used 4 medium peaches. I probably used closer to a cup of rum. The peach peel that is blended within the drink gives it an appealing appearance. This is a very pleasant tasting drink that I will be making again.
