This tasted like nothing more than seasoned vinegar.  I can't say that we liked it, but I can't give it a bad rating because I always appreciate recipes from other parts of the world and I'm sure this is more of an acquired taste based on region.  Thank you for sharing.

Almost as good as I remember from when I was stationed on Guam.  I made a few changes...used 2 hot jalapenos and some hirachi sauce (no thai chilis' at the commissary) and added a splash of rice wine vinegar and some fish sauce....if you don't bite on a jalapeno, it is the perfect heat!

The store didn't have thai chili peppers, so I used serrano peppers, and used a little less garlic. It was very delicious. It says 20 servings but, my husband used it in 2 days! Thanks!

I was pleasantly surprised by this!  I was unsure if I would like it since there is no sweetness added and I like a sweet sauce for my egg rolls.  I did enjoy it for about 1 egg roll then the vinegar started creeping up on me more and more.  I added sugar then to balance it out.  Good that way too ;)  Thanks!

Me and my bf make this a lot. We use it on rice and chicken all the time. I I use a whole onion though with a bunch of these Guam hot peppers he brought and Thai chili’s with about 6 or 7 cups of soy sauce with about a cup and a half of vinigar and a single quarter cup or water and either lemon powder or a whole lemon squeezed or a whole lime squeezed. I don’t have exact measurements we use. We do taste tests as we go and eyeball it.

If i'm rating a recipe it will usually be a 5, if less I have no need for it! This goes well with all meats, particulary grilled meats, on rice dishes and just about anything you would want to dip into.
My 90 year old mom loves dipping cucumber  into it!

This is a good recipe, I would add some lemon powder or lemon juice to make it even better!

Finadene goes with everything!! I also add a couple of slices of lemon to the sauce.
