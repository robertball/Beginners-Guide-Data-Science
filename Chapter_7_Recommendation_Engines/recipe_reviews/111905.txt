Excellent recipe.  Like other reviewers, I added 2 cloves of garlic and left out the cinnamon.

A couple tips if you're new to grilling chicken that I have found useful:
1) Trim the chicken breasts to remove fat and tendons then pound the chicken breasts so they are the same thickness throughout. This will help it cook evenly.
2) Cut small crosswise slits the length of the breast to help the marinade penetrate the meat.  Make sure you don't cut all the way through.

Update 9/2008 - I've made this recipe a few times now and I still love it.  Since I'm only cooking for two and this marinade makes quite a bit, when I make it I buy the family pack of chicken breasts.  I marinate the two I'm cooking that night and then put the others in zip lock freezer bags in the marinade (in packs of two).  That way the next time I want grilled chicken, I just have to pull it out of the freezer and let it thaw and it's already marinated.

My family loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes due to our personal tastes.  I added a couple cloves of fresh garlic. I omitted the cinnamon.  I added about a quarter tsp. more cumin and about a half tsp of coriander.  I knew that my intent was to use this chicken for fajitas so I was looking for spices that would boost the southwest flavor.  I marinated it for about 20 hours.  It was quite spicy so next time I might lighten up on the cayenne but then I probably got more than a pinch in there.  Overall it was a hit and will definately go in our rotation.  My teenager loved using the leftovers for a sandwich.

Both my boyfriend and mom say this is the BEST chicken they've ever had! I made a few changes and took a short cut time wise. Starting with Aaron's kosher chicken from Trader Joe's (Breasts, Thighs only), I removed the skin but left the bones in. Then I substituted mango/lemonade for the OJ (because I was out), fresh ginger for the powdered and one canned chipotle (chopped) and added some fresh garlic. I also ommitted the cayenne pepper because I thought the chipotle would be spicy enough. TIME SAVER TIP: I didn't marinate at all, just poured everything over the chicken and baked it covered with foil for 30min at 375 degrees before grilling 5-8 min per side while basting. I ended up with the juiciest most flavorful chicken ever. Great with brown saffron rice. Enjoy!

This is a keeper!  As other readers suggested, we substituted fresh garlic and eliminated the cinnamon.  After marinading for 8 hours, we thought they had the perfect amount of flavor.  My husband competes in local barbeque contests so when he says "this is really" good, I know it's a winner.

1/4/2009...I've started to combine all of the spices and measure out 3 batches at once.  I put each batch in a separate baggie.  It is easy to put the spices in with the other marinade ingredients and let the chicken marinde during the day while we're at work.  It's ready to grill for a quick dinner when we get home.

We grilled this last night for dinner.  I cut this in half for three chicken breasts and used fresh garlic for the garlic powder and followed it exactly. I let it marinate for 8 hours.  I guess I have to say "less is more" with this recipe.  There are just too many spices competing with one another and in the end the chili flavor won.  Sometimes the simplest marinades make for the best dishes in the end.  You don't have to mix so many things together to get a great tasting piece of meat.  It was worth a try, but I won't be making this again.

I enjoyed this recipe, but only marinated for 5 hours, next time I will do overnight at least.  I added some minced garlic because I am a garlic lover, and next time I will reduce the cinnamon (personal preference).  Hubby and I ate it the first night, and I sliced up two more breasts the following day and used them in fajitas.  YUM!  I have 2 left, and will slice them up and make a salad for tomorrow.  It has provided several meals with only some initial effort (only difficult because I had kids underfoot - next time I'll do it the night before while they are in bed).  I will make this again, thanks for the recipe!

I was a little skeptical when I started to put the many ingredients of this marinade together, but I was quite pleasantly surprised at the wonderful smell once it started to grill.  The chicken was perfectly tender and very tasty.  I can't wait to make this again!

I thought this recipe was amazing....even my picky boyfriend enjoyed it. I do think it would be better on a rack of ribs rather then chicken.

i have to say, i really liked this a lot.  i am not put off by the cinnamon in this as others have said.  i didn't use as much honey, as i hate the way it burns on the grill.  so, i used about 1/8 cup along w/1 pkg of truvia.  i also used indian chili powder so i omitted the chipoltle chili powder and cayenne pepper.  i so did not use OJ (didn't have any) but my lime was pretty juicy.  i did use all of the other spices called for.  this was a very good marinade and will use it again.  thanks for the post lily's mama!

AMAZING.  No, seriously.  AMAZING.  I was in classic what-ingredients-do-I-have-on-hand mode + searched allrecipes with just a couple of those, so I didn't quite follow the recipe completely: I had to omit the lime and orange juice, but used the juice of 1.5 lemons (nearly 1/4 cup), and white wine vinegar in place of red wine vinegar.  While I had salt, pepper, onion + garlic powder, and cumin on hand, I subbed in 3T of Mrs. Dash's southwest/chipotle blend for the rest -- lots of similar spices, and my rough calculation of what all those other spices added up to. I only had 2 large chicken breasts, pounded those down; marinated them for 2 hours maybe?; and grilled for 7 minutes each side at 350-400 degrees.  AWESOME.

Very tasty.  Didn't have the chipotle so left it out.  I was afraid of the cinnamon, so I only used 1/8 tsp... wasn't even noticable.  Next time I might try the full 1/4 tsp and see how it is.  The whole family agreed it was a very flavorful marinade.

This was simple to make and well liked by my family. Cut down on the chili powder a bit as my younger daughter does no like spicy food. Thanks!

This turned out awesome!  I wasn't so sure of it in the beginning, it seemed like a lot of ingredients for it to turn out well, but I was astonished by the taste.  I had to change a little for personal taste and circumstances:  I didn't have lime so I used a small lemon, plus I omitted the cinammon because it just didn't sound good.  My wife and 2 year old don't stand for spicy, so I also omitted the red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper (much to my dismay). Still left with a truly tasty and quick marinade.  The cumin makes a difference! Thanks for sharing!

This was a very good recipe, although mine still lacked flavor.  Maybe I didn't marinate it long enough.....

WOW! I couldn't believe the explosion of flavors from a piece of chicken. I didn't have the white wine and the chipotle chile powder so I didn't add them. I also didn't add the cinnamon, just a personal preference. You gotta try this recipe!

This recipe was perfect! Easy to prep, and it tasted really good - it wasn't a really heavy marinade like barbecue sauce, but it gives the chicken a light sweet flavor, and the honey comes through well. I also used fresh garlic, but unlike a lot of other reviewers, I used the cinammon and was very happy with the flavor! You can tell it's there, but it's very subtle and really brings out the savory. I cooked it in a skillet on the stove, but I can't wait to use this recipe with the grill this summer.

WOW!  I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  After reading the reviews - some great and some not good at all, I had my doubts, but decided to give this a shot and I'm glad I did!  Both hubby and I really enjoyed this.  I did omit the cinnamon and ginger just as a personal preference and would do that again.   Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  This makes plenty of marinade, so next time I might reserve some to baste over the chicken while grilling.  I am hoping that would give this a nice moist sheen.  And, yes, to the previous reviewer, I see no reason why this couldn't be made on a stove top grill.  Shouldn't be a problem.  UPDATE 3/9/12: Made as before but we weren't as thrilled this time.  The cumin flavor seemed to dominate for some reason, maybe because my cumin is new.  Basted this time, but didn't get the sheen I was after, probably because there's not any oil in this.

This dish was ok, I didn't get rave reviews like I normally do with recipes from this site.  It is just as yummy to marinate chicken in Italian dressing and a whole lot easier. Also, the cinnamon was a little overpowering and strange on chicken.  I would reduce amount or cut out completely.

OK recipe. Lots of ingredients. I omitted the cinnamon and also the chipotle chilli powder as it was $7.65 for a small bottle. I subbed more regular chilli powder. I also did what another reviewer suggested and baked it with the marinade on it. The chicken was cooked perfectly, but it probably would have been better if it had been marinated for the proper time, then cooked. Also, I think I would cut back on the ingredients if I make this again. Of all the massive amounts of ingredients, only the chili powder really stood out. It doesn't seem like all these ingredients are really needed.

For the insane amount of items in this recipe, it had very little flavor. Followed exactly, using all the ingredients, and was actually really disappointed at how boring the chicken was. Probably won't make this again.

Pretty good but next time I would cut back on the cumin.  I also felt that there were too many unnecessary complex flavors when it could've been just as good with only half the spices.  Still, pretty good!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe - thanks so much for sharing.  We used both chicken breasts and chicken thighs and I liked the thighs even better - they seemed to absorb the flavor better.  Great recipe!  Didn't need any tweaking at all.  I'm going to use this to make large batches and freeze some for lunches.

This was very, very good! A nice change of pace from the typical chicken marinades, very flavorful with just the right amount of spice and southwestern flair.  My only change was to use white wine vinegar in place of the white wine, and the only other change I would even consider would be to decrease the paprika (personal preference only - it's just not one of my favorite flavors).   Leftovers are going to make a great salad or wrap tomorrow! Thanks, Lily'sMama! I'll use this recipe often.

This recipe is super easy and we had almost every ingredient already in the house...it tasted AMAZING!!  We made it with chicken thighs instead of breasts, which really held the marinade, and we saved 1/4 of the marinade and heated it in a gravy bowl to serve.  Bazmati Rice and grilled onions with black beans and a bit of the marinade over the chicken was absolutely delicious and we can't wait to serve this dish for a dinner party!!  Thank you : )

The flavor was ok...WAY too many ingredients. It was not worth adding so many ingredients together to make chicken that was mediocre at best. I gave this 3 stars only because the meat was very tender, just not so flavorful.

This is an outstanding, full flavored recipe.  I've made it twice with excellent results.  Knowing I would be making it again and again, I decided to triple the seasonings and reserve two-thirds for the next two times I make the chicken.     I also stopped flattening the breasts.  Instead, I cut through them lengthwise (butterflied) to save time and mess of pounding them into 1/2 inch thickness.  I would not recommend marinating the breasts more than 4 hours or the meat texture will turn mushy.  You can apply the seasonings to the meat and refrigerate for overnight.  Then add the liquids (juices, vinegar, oil) and marinate for 1/2-1 hour before grilling. As the recipe creator said, the leftovers are great.  No-- they are fantastic for salads, cassreoles and sandwiches.  This recipe is a keeper.  It deserves all five stars.

Great flavor, great marinade. Spicy but not hot. Even better with a creamy dipping sauce. This would have been terrific on a bun as a sandwich too! I let it marinade 3 hours. Hubby asked if I could turn the marinade into a dipping sauce/gravy the next time. Thanks, as the title implies this was a winner here.

I omit the chilli powder, red pepper flakes and cayenne to make it more toddler-friendly, and I marinate the chicken for 48 hours. Have only cooked it on the Foreman grill so far, and it turns out juicy and super flavorful. Have made it without the honey a couple of times, and not really noticed any difference. Good stuff! Thanks!

Awesome!  Had to make a few changes due to ingredients on hand. Used red wine, instead of white.  Didn't have chipolte chile powder, so used chipolte tabasco.  (We like it hot.)  Omitted cinnamon at the suggestion of other reviewers.  Only marinated for ~ 4 hours and it picked up the flavor nicely.  We'll make this again & again!  TIP: Mix marinade the night before & refrigerate.  Makes an easy dinner.

This was "O.K." for us~ the first time the chicken was marinated for about 8 hours and my husband enjoyed it, I was "iffy" - the second attempt, the chicken marinated for 2 days, as i assumed the extra time would allow for an extra punch of flavor. I still was not entirely happy with the results.

I used all of the ingredients and marinated for 24 hours. Cooked it on a grill using hardwood charcoal. I had high hopes for this and didn't mind using the long list of ingredients, until I tasted the result. It tasted OK but was not exceptional.

My whole family really enjoyed this -- great flavor.  I made it exactly as written.  I marinated it for 5 hours. I may try marinating it overnight next time and cutting the pieces of chicken a little smaller (mine were large).  Great recipe.

No matter which ingredient I leave out altogether or substitute, this is always great. Subtle flavoring, but very tasty. I'm on a low carb diet, so I sub a bit of Splenda for the honey. My teenagers like me to keep it in the house for salads and snacks. Great with ranch dressing. I will try the baking/grill method described in a previous review.

The chicken turned out fine, but it wasn't spectacular.  I've tried many simpler recipes that produced better results.  There were just a ton of ingredients to only have ok chicken at the end.

This is very good, but not *fabulous.*  I marinated the chicken for two days and the marinade had really penetrated the chicken.  Every cut into the meat was juicy and full of marinade.  It was good, I'll make it again, but it's not a five-star.

Very tasty! I let my chicken marinate for about 30 hours and it grilled up so nice & tender. I'll definitely be making this again! My boyfriend who isn't a big chicken fan (weird, I know) even said it was good, thanks!

this was very flavorful.. almost on the border of overpowering.. i marinated for a full 24 hours.. maybe less time would have been better? or maybe there's just too much of everything.. idk.. i used 6 pieces of bone in chicken (legs and thighs) instead of the breasts.. subbed lemon juice for the lime and pineapple juice for the orange.. left out the honey and chipotle powder.. and i used fresh ginger.. bf liked this more than i did but i couldn't see myself making this again.. ty anyway

We loved this! I was a little scared, but it was just the right amount of spice and sweet. It went great with mashed potatoes and green beans. 
I doubled the recipe for a family pack of boneless chicken thighs, although in the end I don't think it was necessary. I didn't have lime juice so used lemon juice (2T = 1 lime or lemon). Didn't have white wine so since I doubled I used one T red wine vinegar and 1 T white wine vinegar. Didn't have so I didn't use chipotle chile and cayenne pepper. Per other reviews I omitted the cinnamon and I'm glad I did, I think it would have contradicted the other flavors. 
I marinated for only 4 hours, but I used a meat tenderizer so it turned out fantastic.
Loved the recipe for a new twist on chicken that will go in our rotation, thanks so much!

I used this recipe to make the marinade for some pork shoulder steaks I wanted to make.  I was looking for a marinade that I could make myself and not have to open the stand-by Mojo Sauce I sometimes use.  The results were better than I had hoped for!  As this recipe is written for chicken, I hesitated for a minute to make it, but I am so glad that I did.  
I made this exactly as written and wouldn't chage a thing.  THIS is my NEW stand-by!!!!!

Pretty good, but not outstanding. Really... 20 ingredients for a "quick" recipe for a working mother? Could cut out half of this stuff and it would still work just as well and would better fit into my definition of quick.

This marinade is awesome.  I have added and left out ingredients depending on the stocking of the pantry, and it always turns out great.  Perfect for any grill out night.

This got rave reviews from my fiance and his friend!  I used 1 tbsp of lemon juice instead of the lime, and cider vinegar.  I didn't use the cinnamon but added some dried parsley.  Absolutely delicious!

Definitely a winner! Used 2 small limes and no white wine (didn't have). Nixed the cinnamon. Skipped the flakes and did 2 pinches of the cayenne. I only marinated for 1 hour. Did 3 breasts with the full amounts of marinade. Pounded down the breasts so they cook faster. Very flavorful!

i really loved this marinade! its alot of differant and random spices to be thrown together but it really makes the ckn turn out with a great flavor and so juicy. my husband is more of a steak guy so its hard to please him with chn but he loved this recipe. the only thing i really did differant was use lemon juice instead of the lime (it was in my fridge already and it kept me from making a trip to the store for a lime)

Tasty and easy to make, I might alter this some next time to get a bit more spice.  But if you grill extra the taste will go with so many other recipes.

Even though I ommitted the spicy hot ingredients so that my toddlers would eat it, this was still pretty yummy.

The ingredient list is long, but mostly spices so goes together quickly.

I used fresh ginger & oregano (3x amount of dried). I would prefer a stronger ginger flavor. The recipe took a  while to put together, and was just ok.  If I make it again, I'd use a good bit more ginger.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated. It had great taste and the chicken was very moist. Can't wait to try it again this weekend.The war department was very pleased. P.S But don't wear your new shirt and flatten the meat (because I forgot) with a hammer, especially if you have already dipped it in the marinade. The war department did not like that part.

simply amazing. I knew there would be a lot of flavor but I didn't know how it would all mesh together. flavor was absolutely delicious,  chicken was juicy and just, to die for. I will be making this again.

I tweaked this a bit right out of the gate. While I'm sure folks in the SW & the great state of LA would consider the original heat quite modest, however for palates accustomed to the mild flavors of New England quisine, words such as "cayenne" can be much like a gale warning. In my interpretation, the cayenne remained on the sidelines along with the red pepper flakes, while the chipolte & regular chili powders' roles were greatly reduced. Two T Ancho chili powder, however, imparts great taste without risking tongue injury. Also added 2 T dark brown sugar to increase adhesion & offset the stronger peppers. Began with 1 T of minced garlic & have increased to two. This recipe is very tolerant of such individual treatments, a hallmark of truly great ones!

None of these changes & comments are meant to demean the original recipe. It is without question the *best* BBQ chicken marinade / sauce I've ever had. The ratios were adjusted solely to cater to our preferences. Thank you so much for sharing; my children & grandkids are big fans and this will be one of our premiere family heirloom recipes.

Bland.  Good for little ones but not for spice lovers. 

It wasn't horrible, one of our kids liked it but my wife and I go for spicy food and this wasn't it. While the medley of spices blended well, the honey was the most dominant flavor despite following others suggestions adding more garlic and our personal addition of more chili, chipotle and cayenne.

I took others advise and omitted the cinnamon. I also omitted the chipolte chili powder because I didn't have any. I let this marinade for a few hours before throwing it on the grill. I couldn't really taste the marinade, probably because my husband smoked the chicken but it came out very juicy and was still good. I may try baking or use the Foreman grill next time to see if I can taste more of the marinade.
