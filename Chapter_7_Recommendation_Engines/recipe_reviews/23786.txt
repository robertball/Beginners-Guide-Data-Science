This was awesome!  I used all the leftover PREPARED stuffing I had, which was at least half a bag.  I layered it wrong--stuffing first, turkey with sauce and then the potatoes with cheese sprinkled on top.  It was divine!  I read the review on the blandness, so before I added the flour I added 1/4 chopped onion, 2 cloves chopped garlic, and a chopped celery stalk. THEN added 2 more tablespoons of butter and the flour.  It was SOO good!  I will make this again!  Thanks!

Picky girl gave it a go ahead to make again. ;)  I didn't have any evaporated milk & didn't feel like running out (well hey, it's snowing & even though I have 4 wheel drive....I just didn't feel like it) ANYWAY, I ended up using heavy cream & the sauce was delicious!   I also used 1/2 bag of mixed veges.  I agree with DREGINEK, no advertising...just pure enjoyment.  Thanks Sharon!

How refreshing! A casserole without cream soups in it! This is an excellent recipe for using all those leftovers. Its quick, easy and delicious. Perhaps a little on the bland side for our personal taste,but a teaspoon of sage, 1/2t thyme and a little crushed rosemary took care of that. We had a large turkey breast in our freezer that I wanted to use up and this was a perfect way to do it. I tripled the turkey and used a full box of stove top stuffing on top. Yum! Thanks Sharon.

I was looking for a way to use up my leftovers from Thanksgiving - this was perfect. Although I don't like to stray from following a recipe before I try it, I did (a little). I followed the recipe accordingly, but I also added a 15 oz. can of mixed vegetables over the turkey, and instead of the stuffing mix (I didn't have any), I crumbled up about 10  "buttery" crackers (Sociables) over the mashed potatoes, then drizzled the melted butter over that. This was heavenly. My kids aren't big turkey eaters, but they (as well as myself and husband) had seconds and thirds on this. This is definately a keeper.

Excellent!! Even got a compliment on that from my picky husband! I just used a smaller dish (8x11), more turkey (about 2cups) and cheese (we like it cheesy), and I also added some herbs and more pepper to the whole thing. I also didn't have stuffing mix, so I too used crackers with a little butter on top, and it was absolutely perfect! I must admit, the two of us polished off the whole casserole, not one crumb left. This will definitely become a regular now.

Not to sound like an advertisement for this recipe but if you need to use up your leftover turkey/mashed potatoes, this is the way to do it!! Great and easy meal!! I used 1/2 tsp of the dry spices and a little more dry stuffing than called for but we all loved this!! Who would have thought leftovers taste this good? Thanks sharon!! I'll make this one again!!

This one is definitely a keeper. Made this after Thanksgiving and it was such a hit with everyone begging for more I made it again the next night and 2 nights after that. The kids can't get enough of it and my wife loves them too. I didn't change anything in the recipe and it came out awesome!

This was a great recipe to get rid of extra mashed potatoes and turkey but the reason it got 3 stars is the taste.  It wasn't very flavorful.  Don't get me wrong, it was ok and the family liked it but I would add more spice next time.

This was awesome! I made a few adjustments to mine, though. First, I added some broccoli to it and then I added 3 different types of cheese (cheddar, monterey jack, and parmesan) Our family loves cheese! I also used instant potatoes instead of real ones. It still tasted just as good. And since I had no stuffing in the house, I used cracker crumbs instead.  Next time, I would like to try it with the stuffing, though. A definite keeper!

I made some adjustments to this recipe to fit what I had on hand.  I substituted four-cheese blend for the cheddar and used instant roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  It was excellent.  I highly recommend this recipe.

My two boys (ages 8 & 11) enjoyed this casserole more than they did the original Thanksgiving dinner.  Very easy & tasty.

I am the husband of this member and had to get on here to say how DELICIOUS this is!!!  I was sad there weren't more leftovers, so my wife could turn them into this amazing casserole!  Honestly, this was almost better than the individual Thanksgiving items on their own.  5 stars.   Completely blown away by this--enough that I had to get on my wife's account and post this late review.

I made this with 2 cups of my leftover homemade gravy instead of making a sauce.  That made it even faster to put together and quite tasty, too.  This casserole is as good as the ingredients you make it with.

Yep, a great way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers.  I made the sauce exactly as stated but added a few extra spices such as red pepper and garlic powder.  In a 2.5 Qt dish, I added about 2.5 cups turkey, half the sauce, cheese, mashed potatos, other half of the sauce, leftover apple sausage stuffing, and leftover turkey gravy on top of the stuffing.  It was delicious!

We loved this recipe.  As another member said, it beats the cream soup recipes and is a great way to use up leftovers.  I only had one small (160 ml) can of evaporated milk so I upped the water a little.  Rather than the stuffing mix, I heated some homemade stuffing.  I also reheated the potatoes (they spread a lot easier).  Because the sauce was already hot, as well as the stuffing and potatoes, I reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes.  Voila!  Fast and super supper.  PS...one reviewer thought it was too sweet.  You likely used sweetened canned milk instead of evaporated milk.

This was great! I will definitely make this again--and year round! I made a number of changes though-- first I used yogurt butter in place of butter which worked fine. I used 2% low fat evaporate milk and the sauce was the perfect richness while not feeling too heavy. To give the sauce more flavor I substituted chicken broth for the water, and added about 1/4-1/2t. Rosemary Herb blend.  Also, I stir-fried 1c chopped onion in the onion for the stuffing mix for a couple minutes and threw in 2 stalks chopped celery at the last minute. I changed the amount of stuffing mix to 4 cups and left it as cubes to make it more stuffing-like. "Spreading" the mashed potatoes over a liquid was clearly not going to work so I dropped spoonfuls over the mixture as evenly as I could and it worked just fine. Easy and delicious! Thank you for the recipe

I made this tonight.  I made my Thanksgiving dinner last night at home.  I did change this up just a little.  I read in some of the reviews that is may have been a little bland.  I used regular milk in the sauce (I thought I had evaporated milk but it was condenced...that would have been a gross mistake!!)  And I did not add the water.  I put the white sauce ontop of the turkey that I had mixed with some frozen mixed veggies and topped it with some leftover gravy.  Then layered the rest on. And I added some french fried onions to the top with about 10 min. left in the baking time.  Very yummy!   I will make this with leftovers from every turkey....maybe even chicken!  Thanks

We had so much leftover from our Thanksgiving meal I decided to try this recipe out. It was SO delicious!! I didn't have evaporated milk so I used heavy cream instead. We also used extra turkey and extra potatoes. I topped it with Stove Top stuffing mix. Super yummy!

Not quite fair to rate because I haven't tried this, but wish to throw in an even simpler "Thanksgiving Leftover Casserole" idea - while cleaning up after thanksgiving, take a baking dish of any sort, layer with turkey, dressing, yams, veggies, put mashed potatoes & gravy on the top, cover and freeze till you're ready to use it. Bake in 350 oven till hot! I learned this from my mom.

This was a great recipe.  I did not have potatoes on hand so I substituted creamy risotto rice cooked in chicken broth.  It turned out great.  I agreed with another rater to add spices so I added thyme, rosemary, and sage approx 1 tsp each.  I added sauteed garlic 1 tsp and 1/2 onion to the evaporated milk.  The dish was easy to cook and turned out beautifully.  I would still increase the spices, onion, and garlic as it was delicious but a little too subtle.  Kids age 2-6 loved the dish.  I would make this again.  Next time I think I would add some frozen peas.

Ah- perfect use for Thanksgiving leftovers! Based on other reviews, here are the changes I made: instead of evaporated milk I used regular 1% milk, about a cup or maybe a little more, and it worked fine for the cream sauce. I added to that: onion flakes, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, and a dash of Frank's Red Hot. I added the turkey to the sauce, then layered stuffing (leftover, already prepared stuffing), turkey-in-sauce, dollops of sweet potatoes, then the mashed potatoes. I did not add any cheese because the cream sauce is rich enough- no desire to make it heavier than it already is.  It's delicious!  I'll serve it tonight with cranberry and coleslaw, and maybe some reheated turkey gravy.

A great way to use up the turkey.  Instead of potatoes, I used left over yams, and it still turned out great.  My husband requested more turkey to be added to the recipe, overall still great :-)  Thanks!

I had to throw it away. It was sickeningly sweet from the canned milk. After all the good reviews I even went back and double checked that I made it correctly - I did. My only substitution was chicken broth for the water.  Also, this is a really wimpy casserole for a 9x13 dish. If you have to make this make it in a 9x9 dish.

This is excellent - however I don't understand how one cup of cooked turkey is going to cover a 13x9" pan. My daughter put a generous amount of turkey in the dish. Also, 2 cups of mashed potatoes would make for a very thin layer - she added a generous amount here as well. We added the following to the salt and pepper: one browned onion (omitted the onion powder), 1/2 tsp. thyme, 1/2 tsp. rosemary and 1 tsp. sage (as suggested by others). We also added a bit more cheese. I can't wait to try this with leftover chicken!!

This is an excellent recipe with FLAVOR which I'm always looking for.  The recipe is not enough to feed my larger family so I augmented it.  I parboiled 1 lb. of broccoli and added that to the sauce with an additional can of cream of chicken soup.  I used a 12 oz. can of condensed milk instead of the 5 oz.  I used 2 cups of turkey.  I sprinkled additional cheddar cheese atop the mashed potatoes with some crushed up Ritz crackers and the 2 T. butter.  Delicious, complete meal!  3 kids ages 8,6 and 4 ate it up and the broccoli wasn't even noticeable in the sauce! Mom and Dad on a budget liked it too.  :D

This was great. I did make some adjustments. I used 2 cups of turkey and glad I did. Also, the sauce I made was a roux + chedder cheese (like you were making mac-n-cheese). I added thyme,rosemary,garlic powder,onion powder and lots of black pepper. This was done after 35 minutes...I think 45 mins is too long. My BF had 3 helpings! great recipe.

Of all the years I've used Allrecipes, this recipe compelled me to become a member and rate. Loved it, so easy, my fiancé who DOES NOT eat leftovers went back for thirds and said it was great. I did add twice the turkey and added 1/4 t each of sage, rosemary and thyme to the sauce, otherwise followed the recipe. Will definitely make again..

Great Festive meal and very filling!  I added chopped spinach and some chopped tomato to get some veges in and also since I didn't have stuffing mix, I used some crumbled old bread and crackers for the top with some Knor vegetable dip mixed in for flavor.  Easy and delicious!

This taste great, but the proportions are wrong, to me. There's way too much sauce and way too little turkey in the original recipe. l also left out the cheese. The sauce is quite tasty, though. I'd say half the sauce, triple the turkey (if you can), and there's no harm in more mashed potatoes.

With a few additions, FANTASTIC! It was so cool to have a recipe that not only used up the extra turkey I had, but also the potatoes and stuffing!  Because of other reviewers comments I also sauteed some onions and minced garlic in the butter before adding the flour.  I also used leftover prepared stuffing rather than dry and it was YUMMY!  I probably tripled the amount of turkey and it still turned out perfectly.  I even messed up and put the stuffing down before the potatoes, so the potatoes were on the top, but it still tasted great.  I also added in some chopped up leftover broccoli, just sprinkled on top of the turkey.  My picky eaters (ages 11, 8, and 4) also commented on how tasty it was. I'm definitely keeping this recipe for future Thanksgiving leftovers. Thank you!!!

YUM! Kudos to yet ANOTHER great way to use up Tday leftovers!!! Both my hubs and I REALLY enjoyed this. Admittedly, I did "liven" this up a bit. Not only am I trying to rid my fridge of our last remaining turkey leftovers, I'm on a mission to clean out my freezer to make room for holiday goodies. While digging thru my freezer, I found a bag of buttered corn begging to be added to my casserole (I microwaved it per the package directions and then layered it on top of my turkey). :) I also added 1/4 t of garlic powder to my gravy. Now here's where I significantly deviated. I did not follow Sharon's layering directions at all. Instead, I started with my (prepared / leftover) stuffing, then turkey, gravy, corn and taters. I topped everything with (SHARP) cheddar and baked as directed. My final change was to use a MUCH smaller (8 x 8 in.) baking dish rather than the suggested 9 x 13 in. one (just seemed to fit better). Leftover cranberry sauce and dinner rolls completed our meal. I am happy to report that I have officially used up all of my holiday leftovers (hooray!). Thanks for sharing your recipe, Ms. Pruit! :-)

Easy to whip together.   Tasty enough to keep and make again.  I doubled the amount of turkey, used leftover stuffing and store bought mashed potatoes.  The potatoes were cold/firm and I simply sliced them and placed them around the casserole dish and topped it with the left over dressing and stuffing.   I 86'd the onion powder and added about 1/4 t. of dried onion. Perfect dish for a very chilly fall evening.   Now if only I had a glass of Zin to enjoy with my entree.

It was good, but didn't use very many left overs! We doubled the turkey and after eating it I think I would have put 4 cups of turkey instead of 1 cup. Flavor was a little bland, we added extra salt and pepper and I think next time we'll add onions.

I was afraid to make this because everyone said it was too much filling for a 9 inch deep dish, so I had a smaller 8" pie crust standing by. I didn't use it. It's a Longaberger and maybe it's a little deeper than normal. I only modified by adding a tinge more cranberries. I baked it only 30 minutes because I had to leave the house, so the apples were a bit crisper than they should have been, but this was a KEEPER. Everyone loved it and asked to make it a regular.

Decent casserole.  Kids all inhaled it, although we all said we tend to prefer the ingredients on their own.  We usually love cheese and just couldn't seem to enjoy it in this one.  I agree with the reviewers who said it needed more seasonings (I added a bunch and it would have been bland without).  Also used twice the amount of meat called for.

It was a little too bland for my taste to start off with, so I used milk and cream cheese instead of evaporated milk, chicken stock for water, added onion, parsley, rosemary and thyme and increased the cheese and pepper.  The family loved it, so I will definitely make it again with the same changes.

I appreciate this idea on how to use leftovers but we found this to be just okay.  The recipe does not make much (which is good) and can be prepared in a two quart casserole dish.  We didn’t like the stuffing on top and ended up scraping it off.  My son got the good idea to add bacon bits to his and that actually made it palatable.  I doubt if I will be making again but if I do I will certainly use bacon bits on top instead of the stuffing.

Pretty good.  I added celery, garlic, and carrots to the sauce, and seasoned with Tony's seasoning salt.  I also used some leftover prepared stuffing and sprinkled some extra cheese on top.  This is a really good way to use up leftovers.

This was great!!!  I also used 1 1/2-2 cups of turkey, and I didn't have any onion powder so I used some chopped onion and put it into the butter to soften.  My husband had 3 servings, and took the one serving remaining for lunch the next day.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great way to get rid of leftovers.

This is a great recipe. I was looking for something to do with Christmas dinner leftovers. I had lots of white turkey meat and we are not that fond of turkey pot pie, so this was a real find. I agree with another poster who said the quantities are too slim for a 9x13 dish so I made a few changes. I put 3 cups of diced turkey on the bottom making sure it was well covered, chopped up leftover broccoli, carrots and peas and mixed this with the turkey.  Like others, after melting the butter I added half a chopped small onion but no garlic. I warmed up the mashed potatoes to spread easier but I wish I had more as they barely covered the turkey and sauce which made it hard to spread over the sauce evenly. I really liked the boxed turkey stuffing on top, which worked well as I think our homemade stuffing would have a too strong sage taste. My kids asked me to rate this five stars so I did. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for this yummy recipe.

Have really enjoyed this recipe twice. Out of curiosity, also tried it with pot roast leftovers, which was equally delicious. Have used meat gravies in lieu of the white sauce and have found it absolutely fantastic. Has become a real family favorite.

Amazingly yummy. Even my ten year old, picky eater "gobbled" it up. It looked runny when I put it in the oven and held my breath.  What turned out wa a masterpiece of left-overs!

Disclaimer: I'm not much of a casserole fan. This was decent, but not really worth the calories to add the milk and cheese to an already heavy batch of ingredients.

On first sight, it looks like the casserole is all mush. But with the first bite, the stuffing mix works it's magic. The dry stuffing is definitely the greatest addition, I don't think cooked stuffing would work. The flavors were amazing together, and it's kid friendly! My 6 year old is very picky and he loved it! Great for a quick, filling meal any time of the year!

Loved this recipe.  I used a lot more turkey, and used leftover stuffing instead of using boxed stuffing crumbs.

I am giving this a 4 only because it was a little odd putting together -- I used double meat, mashed potatoes and cheese.  The mashed potatoes were a little odd to layer/spread; and I was unsure about the stuffing - as it was essential dry stuffing - just the bread crumbs and butter and I was second guessing if that was correct... but it did work out ( I used stove top).  All that being said the taste was delicious!  We took it camping and it was great!  My hisband raved about it. We felt there was plenty of seasoning/flavor.  I will definitely make this again!!

This is the second time I have made it.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly but with extra seasonings, salt pepper and poultry seasoning.  The next time I had quite a bit of turkey gravy left over and used that instead of the milk sauce. It was very good both ways but the turkey gravy does give it a much nicer flavor.

mmm this was soo good, something different and a great way to use up your leftovers, definitely do the stuffing though like it says and don't use already made because it gave it a crunchiness...will definitely make again next year and years after...really good!

I made this exactly as the recipe, I thought the recipe was wrong because of how liquid it was and seemed like the ingredients spread pretty thinly for the size of the pain but it turned out great and is even better the next day, if there is any left the next day, pan fried like a potato patty. Next time I fix it I will add more turkey, stuffing maybe more cheese, yes it was bland but still good comfort food. This will be part of our left over recipes staple.

We thought this was a pretty good way to use up the leftovers....however, I did not make the sauce.  I simply used the leftover gravy, as it was almost identical to the sauce.  I wouldn't make it on a regular basis, but for Thanksgiving or Christmas leftovers, it was a hit!

I believe that it is only fair to make a recipe according to the original instructions and thereafter make changes according to personal preferences. Without major changes, I won't be making this again.

not be a leftover person those was a really good dish, to prevent it from being bland as others mentioned I added chopped onion and celery to the sauce alog with extra salt, pepper and garlic salt.  I also used 1/2 & 1/2 since I did not have any evaporated milk on had.  It was a thanksgiving cheesy goodness! I think it fits better in a smaller pan for a more layered casserole but very good overall

This was an easy and great way to use up the leftovers.  I did add a bit more flavor to it with some sauted onions and herbs.  This took less than 10 minutes to assemble then it was pop it in the oven and walk away.  The sauce makes it.  We'll have this again!

It was a good way to get rid of leftover turkey for sure, but I'm glad I read the reviews about blandness before making it. Added in some spices as well as garlic and onions... Also, my mom thought that it was going to be really thick if we added the potatoes so we used pasta instead. Still really tasty! The sauce was a little runny, though was still delicious. Great recipe!

Just fed this casserole to 7 seniors,from 84 to 91)a home care worker and myself, and 5 of them asked for seconds. we had a house party last night and had a lot of baked ham left over, so cubed that instead of the turkey. (After Christmas i will try it with turkey).I used a whole box of stuffing(Stove Top),and 4 cups of mashed potatoes. i used Skim milk in the white sauce and light old cheddar to cut down on fat. It definitely is a keeper!

To die for!  Added more turkey and halved the recipe as it was just two of us.  We ate the whole thing and would have gone back for more but there wasn't any.  Great starter recipe that can be very forgiving

I loved this, what an easy way to use up leftovers. I seasoned the sauce with pepper, salt, garlic powder. I just used stuffing I already had made, added fresh parsley over the top of the turkey before adding the next layer. Perfect!

This is the way to eat Thanksgiving leftovers... Yum!  I give it 4 stars because I did have to alter the recipe.  I agree with previous posts that There isnt enough in the layering, so I added more.  I used 2 cups turkey, 2-3 cups prepared stuffing, 2 cups mashed potatoes, & cream instead of evaporated milk.  I also added garlic, onion powder & black pepper.  Very, very good! Served this to family w/age ranging from 2 yrs-80yrs & everyone loved it.

I roasted a large chicken this weekend and had some leftovers.  I made this and it was great.  I did not use the mashed potatoes because I didn't have any and per previous reveiwers, I added some poultry season to the sauce.  I also made a box of instant stuffing per box directions. Next time I will add the potatoes.  This was really good.

This is wonderful! I, many others, increased the potatoes, chesse and added spices.  I sauted celery and onion with the 3 tbsp butter and made sure the flour browned up a bit before adding the evap. milk.  Increased the flour/butter just a little and also added some turkey broth that I had frozen from last turkeyday (a.k.a Thanksgiving). I popped it into the oven around 10 a.m. at 250 and covered it because we were heading to church.  When we got back just after 12, I took off the foil, upped the temp to 350 and had a nice crispy, piping hot dinner in 15 min. I'm anxious to try it with my homemade gravy and stuffing at this years turkeyday!  Yumm!

This turned out to be a great way to use leftovers. I took the advice of other reviewers and added to the sauce. I threw in some fresh tarragon and thyme as well as a tsp. of chicken bouillon. I also added a bit more flour to thicken the sauce. It was very good!

This was a good use of my Thanksgiving leftovers. My kids all ate it, I could hide vegetables in it without them getting upset, and my husband went for seconds.

I made this earlier in the day then put it in the refrigerator. I heated it in the microwave for five minutes before putting it in the oven. I also put a thin layer of leftover yams on top. It gave it a nice zing.

For me, this casserole was average at best.  I followed the advise of other reviews and added some spice to the sauce, but it was still bland.  I had hoped this might be the 'no canned soup included' recipe for leftover turkey I have been looking for.  Sorry Sharon, but the search continues.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  Not only was it easy to make, but it was delicious, also!  Even my husband, who is probably the pickiest eater I know of, loved this casserole!  Next time, I might add about 1/2 cup to 1 cup more turkey, though.

This is a good base recipe to play with. I haven't tried this myself, but DH liked it. He said he really liked the "crunchy stuff"- I didn't want to open a box of stuffing, so I used lemon-pepper bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  I will make more with garlic bread crumbs.  The potatoes I used were leftovers from making twice-baked potatoes- they had onions, garlic, salt, cheese, and sour cream, so I left out the cheese layer.  Sure smelled good!

Came out a little bit bland, but overall a good use of leftovers.  I used italian bread crumbs for the topping because I didn't have any stuffing mix.  I wish I would've used the butter cracker ideas instead.  I think it would've been better if I would've added some sort of spice to the mashed potatoes because they kind of dominated the casserole.  I'm a really inexperienced cook, however, so I don't know what the best way to doctor them up would be...

Absolutely fabulous!  I make this using meat from the Herbed Turkey Breast recipe.  Also try a layer of green beans over the turkey.

Fast and easy way to use leftovers. Did make some changes per other reviews by sauteing onion and garlic, adding celery seed. Used skim milk and didn't use the bread crumb topping as I didn't have any on hand. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I used a 8x8 pan, 2 cups of leftover turkey, one can of evaporated milk, 1 c. water and 3T butter and 2T flour. 

I also sautéed 1/2 of an onion and a few stalks of celery in butter for added flavor.

I have used leftover mashed potatoes before and added an instant cup of prepared mashed potatoes to make 1+ cups of mashed potatoes. 

Today, I boiled four small/medium sized potatoes and added a little milk and butter. 

For the topping, I used dried white bread crumbs and Ritz crackers. I added garlic powder to the overall mixture and a little of seasoning salt.

This recipe is perfect for leftovers and so easy to adapt. One of my favorites!!!

I made this with my last bit of turkey leftovers from Thanksgiving. I used all the ingredients the original recipe here calls for and I added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp of rosemary (I didn't add the salt) also added less than half a can of cream of celery, cheddar soup and potatoe soup just because I had them on hand from something else I made earlier. It was in the oven for 45 min on 350 and it came out so GOOD!! I will be making this again and will try with chicken. A bit to loose for me so I will use less water next time or try it with gravy but regardless this recipe is a keeper:)

I know it's July but really felt like a Thanksgiving Dinner, which I made in crockpot yesterday, not bad just used turkey legs and frozen mashed,frozen sweet potatoes and frozen green beans. Made stuffing and gravy.  I just put all the leftovers in a crockpot following this recipe. Did not measure anything just layered per recipe with addition of green beans on top of turkey.  also added rosemary sage and thyme to ward off the blandness. I will put it on low heat until I get back from work and hopefully will taste wonderful. I will re-rate then. 4 stars are for ease of prep and everything tasted good first time around.

I added little pieces of broccoli and they turned out great.  I added twice the amount of turkey (at least).  I probably wouldn't add the cheese because we couldn't taste it...even after we added a bunch.  I would double the salt and add more seasoning, too.  Family LOVED it and leftovers were gobbled up.

This was pretty good, but I had to make a couple of changes.  First, only one cup of turkey would never have been enough so I doubled it.  Also, I'm not a fan of evaporated milk so I used whole milk instead.  I liked the flavor, but I think it would have been even better if there had been more of the crumb topping (I used Stove Top Turkey) since that's where the herbs and spices are.  Will try again one day using chicken since we eat much more of that.

This was a wonderful way to use the last bits of Thanksgiving dinner. I just layered all the leftovers, using leftover stuffing and gravy and omitting the evaporated mild and water. It was total Thanksgiving in every bite!

very good great flavoring but seemed somewhat dry so I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and baked in the oven 5 more min. was better.

This dish was delicious.  I doubled the turkey (as per some of the other reviews).  My whole family loved it, and came back for seconds.  I'll definitely make it again - sometimes I substitute canned chicken breast for recipes when I'm in a hurry, so I'll probably try it that way, and I'm sure it will turn out fine.

It was just not that good. Maybe it was because I used 2% milk instead of the evap milk? Who knows, it was overpowered by the mashed potato consistency and not enough flavor. I shouldve put more cheese in it. But at least I got rid of the leftovers!

We loved this casserole. I tripled the amount of turkey, added garlic powder also, added salt & spices to taste rather than measuring, also added extra potatoes (needed it to really feed 8 hungry people), prepared a box of stove top for the stuffing, & added corn. Rated this 4* because of the portion size being off; I don't think we would have like this very much with only 1 cup of turkey and it wouldn't have fed our whole family. But with the few changes it's a  great family recipe.

I used chicken broth in place of the water when making the cream sauce, which gave it much more flavor, I also found that one cup of turkey wasn't much, so I made this in a smaller dish, too, an oval baking dish about 1 qt. & a half.  Didn't use all the sauce as it appeared it would drown the turkey....It was delicious with those subs.

This was delicious with a really great flavor.  The only thing I did differently was to use 1/2 tsp of onion salt since I didn't have any onion powder on hand.  I then didn't use the 1/4 tsp of salt.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to perhaps use more stuffing on the top.  All in all - Great recipe and great way to use up those leftovers!

This tastes SOOO much better than you would think!. I substituted chicken broth for the water and I also sautéed onions and garlic in the butter before adding the flour and doubled the turkey amount. You could (if you don't have picky eaters like I have) add some frozen veggies in it to make it a complete meal.

Delish! I had sour cream and chives mashed potatoes leftover and it went great with it. I used a suggestion and sauteed onions and garlic with the butter, then added flour and about 1/2 cup 1% milk; then mixed the sauce in with the turkey before layering on top. I also had leftover already-prepared stuffing and sprinkled it on top - it was perfect! My kids don't like stuffing but the flavors were so wonderful they didn't even notice there was stuffing on this :) The cheddar cheese is a great addition. A new post-THanksgiving favorite - thank you!

I didn't add the stuffing - something about thinking 'too much starch' - but I missed it.  Husband loved this beyond words.  We'll make it again next year!

Gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because this isn't "the Best" it's a very creative way to serve up leftovers - and in that regard it's great!

I have made this recipe twice in one week after Thanksgiving.  My family loved it and also my guests.  It was so easy and really emptied my refrigerator from all the leftovers.  I seasoned the sauce mixture, added more cheese, and some turkey gravy on the mashed potatoes.  And of course added a lot more than 1 cup of turkey.

Okay. So, I looked at the ingredients and thought that I could fit them into a 8x8 pan. And I could. I just wish I would have thought ahead and cut back on the sauce. After I used the sauce, I had about half the sauce leftover. 

I did a layer of sauce inbetween the layers of thanksgiving food. Seemed to work out great. The casserole was just moist enough. The sauce wasn't overpowering and had just the right touch for the casserole insides.

My husband and I liked it but my kids did not. I would have put it in "to make again" recipe collection if my kids had liked it.  This is why I'm only giving
it three stars.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!  I have made this a number of times...even with chicken!  
I did add some flavouring - garlic powder and such - and some frozen veggies! 
YUMMY - for those who DON'T like creamy casseroles (like myself!) this one is a  WINNER!

Added dried onion flakes since didn't have onion powder, also added garlic and herb seasoned bread crumbs since only had plain stuffing mix.  Had plain potatoes, mashed, no added butter or anything else.  Increased the salt and pepper and added sage and thyme for more flavor.  Turned out well.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. My youngest not so much. I will make this again! It's cheesy and comforting. The one thing I would change is adding more than one cup of diced turkey. Next time I will put a generous layer of turkey to the bottom layer.

Maybe I did something wrong, but we were not at all thrilled with this recipe.  I even pumped it up a bit by adding a smidgen of garlic and sage per some of the other reviews.

This was awesome!!! Since other reviewers mentioned it was bland, I roasted a head of garlic in the oven for 1/2 an hour and mixed that in with my leftover mashed potatoes.  I made this the day after Thanksgiving so I just used the leftover stuffing and skipped the steps for the stuffing in the recipe.  I also added some broccoli to the turkey layer because I had that leftover.  It definitely needed that.  My sister loved it so much that she said making this casserole should become a Thanksgiving tradition!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great way to use up those leftovers. Easy to adapt to your own flavor preferences.  Goes together quickly, will be making many more times.

I just made this-after hosting thanksgiving I have PILES of leftovers and am only one person (!). It's really surprisingly good, despite looking like a mess! Used a bit more flour, and added some basil and lemon pepper, garlic, few more spices to the sauce. I also threw in some frozen peas, and used leftover cranberry apple stuffing. Really good idea to kill off leftovers without eating ANOTHER darn turkey sandwich.

Very good - I halved the recipe and messed up and added the full amount of water.  Poured off a bit of the sauce, but it was still pretty good. I had leftover stuffing so I sprinkled it on top.  Looking forward to having on the day after Thanksgiving!

I made this the other day for dinner using some left over turkey from Easter dinner.  I followed the recipe for the most part, the only change I made was to add some onion sauteed in butter to the stuffing mix, I added more spice to the sauce (basil, seasoning salt and savory).  Lastly, we found the sauce too thin, so we added more flour mixed with some of the sauce to thicken it further.  The end result was pretty darn good and we'll likely make this dish again.

This would have been better if I hadn't accidentally bought condensed milk instead of evaporated milk.  But it was still really yummy.  Especially with left over gravy on top of it.

Thanks for the idea for using Thanksgiving leftovers.   I made a few changes though and it came out really tasty.  First, I made a white sauce and then added the leftover turkey gravy for flavoring (about 2 cups of gravy).  Then I added about 4 cups of chopped turkey to the mixture.  I poured it into a large roasting pan (9x12) and topped off the turkey mixture first with mashed potatoes and then with the prepared stuffing that I had already made.  For an extra crunch I added about 2 cups of crushed flavored croutons before baking.  This not only made enough for 1 dinner but also will last for another dinner plus a couple of lunches.  Thanks for posting.

This was an awesome meal, and everyone loved it, even my very picky 15yo daughter.  I didn't have mashed potatoes so I substituted some dumpling-style egg noodles that i cooked in chicken broth.  Based on other reviews I also added some basil and thyme and also doubled the amount of turkey.  Great taste, easy to prepare, and everyone loved it.  Thanks!

Mmmm! Was cleaning out the freezer to make room for holiday cookies, and came across some frozen ground turkey.  Wanting to use it up, I found this casserole.  I sauteed the turkey with a chopped onion and a clove of garlic, salt, and pepper, then proceeded with the rest of the recipe.  Thanks, Sharon!

I had to add a lot more turkey than was called for (total of about 3 cups) otherwise the turkey covered only a third of the bottom of the dish. I also had to use more mashed potatoes and more stuffing mix to cover everything. The dish turned out well; my husband loved it. I would just increase the amount of turkey, mashed potatoes, and stuffing.

This is so good!  I added much more turkey and added some chopped pork loin too!  I added a couple of dashes of red pepper and a couple of dashes of tabasco sauce to the sauce.  After I put the cheese on (about 2 cups), I added 1/2 cup creole veggies.  You get this in the produce section already chopped.  (fresh garlic, white onions, green onions, celery, and red bell peppers)  For the topping, I used packaged dry corn bread stuffing crumbs and added a couple of dashes of Tony's.  Again, this was REALLY good.  This is so much better than any other left over turkey recipe!

I followed the recipe, but added leftover corn and mushrooms.  It was not mushy or bland.  I will make this again.  Like others have said, this is an easy to reipe to modify to taste.  The entire casserole disappeared quickly!

This is a tasty dish.  The only change I made was that I used regular milk with a little less water.  Oh, and I doubled the turkey, and used more that listed cheese and potatoes.  If I were to make this again I'd put in a layer of stuffing or veggies or something.  It turned out a little thin.  This is definatly a recipe that mix and match ingredients with.

Over the turkey I added 2 cans of peas, then the sauce (added onion soup mix & italian herbs), plus 2 C. cheese (could have used even more), mashed potatoes, and then some crushed croutons (didn't have the stuffing). My family loved it - even my picky little ones.

Absolutely the BEST!  I made this the day after Thanksgiving with all my leftovers: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes.  I used probably four cups of turkey, and used regular milk instead of evaporated.  I also used two cups of cheddar cheese.  I followed another reader's suggested of putting some herbs in the white sauce--I think I used sage, thyme, marjorum.  I froze the whole thing and thawed it out today (a month later) to bake.  It smelled wonderful as it baked.  The casserole is incredibly tasty, mild, and perfect for a freezing cold winter's night.  Absolutely give this a try.  Highly recommended.

What a hit this one was!  I used cream instead of the evap. milk, 2 cups turkey, a bit more than 1 cup cheese, and added 1 tsp seasoned salt to the sauce.  Not at all bland.  The kids loved it, my husband went for seconds, and it virutally disappeared.  Definitely a keeper.

Very easy to make.  The sauce is very good...an great alternative to creamed soup.  However, next time I would add more turkey, extra seasonings, and definitely more cheese on top.  The kids really liked it.

This is a very tasty recipe! I used 2 tbsp of butter for the sauce (instead of 3tbsp)I used garlic powder (instead of the onion powder)I didn't use the dry stuffing bread mix because i used some chopped up leftover stuffing from sunday lunch instead. i also added 1 1/2 tsp of dried herbs into the sauce and used chicken instead of turkey. The last thing i did is i added a tin of peas and a tin of carrots to the chicken and stuffing mixture on the base as requested by other reviews.

Thanx for a brilliant recipe and i'll use it again but next time i will try normal milk instead of evapourated!

This is a pretty good recipe but not one that my husband will ask for again.  There was something about the mashed potatoes that he didn't care for.  However, the turkey and sauce were very good (I added 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning to give the sauce more flavor) as was the stuffing topping (I used leftover homemade - Grandma Ruth's Stuffing from this site which is excellent!).

Our family mashed potato recipe is made with butter, sour cream and garlic and onion powder to taste.  I add a layer of made stuffing and corn.  This is so tasty and a family favorite!  I even sometimes get the request for it from my boys, so I use chicken, which is easily as tasty!

I admit, I was skeptical about the sauce for this as I didnt think it would be very good.  It seemed pretty thin and bland to me.  The good reviews were enough for me to give this a try.
I had everything leftover from our Thanksgiving dinner so why not, right?
I only had already cooked stuffing, so I used that and kept everything else the same as the recipe called for.
Because the reviews said that it was bland, I added 1.5 tsp. of  Chupacabra Cluckalicious poultry seasoning to the sauce before pouring it over the Turkey and stuffing.  It was CLUCKALICIOUS!  Lol  so good!
I have saved this recipe do I can use this from now on, it's that good!  In fact, my picture has a corner missing from the pan because I dug into it before I thought to take the picture! ????
Definitely check this recipe out!  It's delicious!

This was a very tasty way of using up a lot of leftovers we had from hosting Thanksgiving this year.  Since I also had some gravy left over, I used that instead of making a sauce.  I also added a cheese sauce with diced turkey that I had left over from a previous night.  I didn't have cheddar cheese on hand so I used mozzarella instead.  (I would recommend the cheddar and will use it in the future.)  Instead of crushing stuffing bread crumbs I just put the left over stuffing on top of the mashed potatoes.  The only other change I made was to add 1 tsp dried thyme to the sauce.  I will definitely make this again!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Wonderful recipe and perfect for Thanksgiving leftovers!! I did make a couple of modifications: used a 9x9 pan instead of 9x13 and doubled the amount of turkey. My husband suggested adding green beans so it would be like having Green Bean Casserole with the turkey, gravy and mashed potatoes.

I made it but changed it up a bit. I had leftover stuffing (w herbs, celery and onion—homemade) that I used and I made gravy w butter, flour and turkey broth (from the carton). Layered the stuffing first, then the turkey, the gravy, and then added some cranberry sauce before adding the potatoes and cheese. My family LOVED it!  Not bland at all!

It turned out great!! I first cooked 1/3 cup chopped onion in the butter and used half and half instead of evaporated milk. I also put the stuffing as the first layer (leftover stuffing which was already cooked) then turkey then sauce then potatoes then cheese. Everyone loved it! Even my husband who said he was too full from dinner the previous day ate 3 servings!

My family loved this!  I did use my leftover stuffing from Thanksgiving instead of the herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing and I put that on the bottom of a 7X11 casserole dish.   I also used 2 cups of turkey. When I made the sauce, I didn't have evaporated milk so I substituted 6 oz of 1/2 & 1/2 and 6 oz of heavy cream.  I didn't find it bland (maybe because my stuffing had lots of flavor, maybe because I just like it the way it was written).  Everyone gobbled it up!

This recipe is a wonderful alternative to many other leftover turkey casseroles.  I appreciate that there is no "Cream of (insert any flavor) Soup" in it either.  The most awesome thing is that you more than likely already have the leftover potatoes and stuffing next to the turkey. I have used this with both leftover prepared stuffing and as the directions said and both work great. I've even used the leftover gravy instead of making the sauce. The best way of course is following this recipe as stated. My family loves it and I like that the turkey is hidden in all the other stuff. Enjoy!

This was pretty good, put I would definitely recommend tripling the turkey. Otherwise, add some veggies and definitely some adobo, rosemary, sage or it's pretty bland. More cheese too!

Great!   I used my leftover stuffing instead of dried stuffing and used less milk by half and it came out perfectly.    You could really do a casserole with just about any leftovers you have and follow this recipe (or similar) and it becomes a whole new meal.    (I love any meal that uses only one baking pan!)

This was so good! I like it because its not the typical turkey day leftovers (soup, sandwiches, tetrazzini, etc.) And its soooooo easy. You can pretty much throw in any leftovers you have. The changes/additions I made were that I used about 10 crushed Ritz crackers and mixed them with already made stuffing from the day before (didn't have any mix), I added chopped mushrooms and corn (again, from the day before) and I used heavy cream instead of the evaporated milk cause I didn't have any milk. It was soooooo good! Also I left out the mashed potatoes cause I didn't have any, I just used more turkey. I think I will always use the Ritz/stuffing mix cause we liked the bit of crunch from the crackers. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent! I am allergic to pepper, so omitted. I had leftover prepared stuffing, so used that instead of the dry. I didn't have any cheddar, so used Monteray Jack cheese. Like some others I doubled the turkey. I also added a frozen bag of peas so I wouldn't have to heat them separately. Whole family loved this cassarole!

I give this 5 Yums. I put this in my Major Comfort Food file. Hubby loves it too. It works with cooked chicken too. I doubled the meat,cheese, potatos and stuffing. I used half cheddar and half mozerella. I even added peas and mushrooms. My girlfriend added waterchestnuts. If you have insomnia, this'll put you to sleep, happy and content!

The hubby and 4yo really liked this. As is, its pretty bland, so i added creole seasoning, rosemary, thyme,  and celery seed to the sauce and used 3 slices american cheese, 1/4 parmesan, and Monterey jack. Ritz crackers made for a better topping than bread crumbs. Great comfort food on a cold night

This was so easy to make, I used prepared leftover stuffing as well.
The stuffing on top added a nice crunch to the cheesy center.

This is the perfect recipe to use up all of your leftovers.  I used prepared stuffing and added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, sage and rosemary to the sauce and it wasn't bland at all.  I will add 2 cups of diced turkey next time but the sauce makes the turkey so tender and juicy.  My husband and kids LOVED it!!  This recipe is a definite keeper for years to come!

First, I only gave 4 stars simply because I changed it so much.  Im sure its a 5 star!  I changed it so that I could use only leftovers, I used my leftover gravy instead of making the sauce by re-heating it and adding a little bit of half and half instead of canned milk, then I put lots of extra cheese, and I also used my leftover dressing instead of making new with breadcrumbs and butter.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!  It was so good, and now I have room in my fridge - awesome idea.

At first this recipe seemed intimating.. I've spent my life baking but I'm relatively new to cooking. This recipe came off without a hitch simply by following the directions. Take it from an inexperienced cook, some recipes are not written for a newbie such as myself. This was great! Taste and texture was wonderful, appearance was first rate. I'll definitely make this again!

Needed a little more seasoning but it was tasty.  I had to assume one reviewer accidentally used sweetened condensed milk rather than evaporated milk

Really Good!  I took the advice of another user of cooking onions and minced garlic into the sauce and it was really good, definately not a healthy recipe but a great way to use all the leftovers creatively!

I could barely eat this.  The flavor was very bland, but the texture was what got to me.  Sorry this just wasn't for us.

This was a great way to use our thanksgiving leftovers. To use one more leftover I used turkey gravy in place of the cream sauce and it tasted wonderful.

Great way to use up leftovers.  I did make some changes- instead of using water in the sauce, I used a cup of leftover gravy and since I had leftover dressing, I crumbled the sausage and cornbread dressing to top it instead of dressing mix.  I also increased the turkey to 2 cups and made it in a deep dish casserole.  I didn't add any additional seasoning since all the separate parts had plenty of seasoning and it came out great.

Modified -This was great although I used my leftover turkey gravy instead of making the sauce. Used a 9 x 9 also. I omitted the cheese and added some leftover brussels sprouts (chopped up).  Layer the turkey on the bottom, then b. sprouts, gravy, mashed potatoes, with the leftover stuffing on top.  (I added a bit of gravy to the potatoes and warmed it on the stove.  They spread very easily that way.)  Cooked uncovered as directed.  So quick and Delish!

Probably doubled the turkey and added a little onion and celery to the bottom of the pan. I also increased the topping by 1/2 C. stuffing crumbs and an additional 1 TB of butter. The sauce set up beautifully. Try this!

Perfect way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers, added garlic seasoning, used corn instead of beans and added cheddar on top of the potatoes, I didnt mix it in as was instructed.  Our picky daughter said it was so good!!  Will make again!!

I had serious doubts but tried it anyways due to its ratings.  We all loved it!  I added lots more turkey, a bit more cheese, and I think I used quite a bit more potatoes "blobbed" on top.  The sauce is a great alternative to canned soup, and less salty of course.  My husband had thirds and my picky 2 year old even liked it.  I am not much of a casserole fan and I even loved it!  I made some quick cooking stuffing for the side as well as green beans.  Thanks!

If you can get over the "look" of this casserole you'll enjoy this. Alas, my children couldn't get over the "mush-like" appearance. I only had swiss cheese which worked out just fine..next time I will add more stuffing. I like the crunch it provided.

Great way to use up leftovers.  I will keep this one in mind for chicken leftovers as well.  I followed the recipe exactly but I did use instant mashed potatoes.  Next time I will use a smaller baking dish as someone else advised because it is a little thin.  This is a good one for picky eaters.  I could understand how some found this bland.  Would definitely add some seasoning to the sauce.  I actually used leftover turkey steaks that I had heavily seasoned for grilling.

I made this in the february, but it was still easy with shortcuts like mashed potatoes from flakes and chicken breast. I did add a little more (packaged)herb seasoned dry stuffing over the meat and sauce (it looked too soupy) and my family loved it. I might have to rename this-its too good to make once a year.

I thought this was good, but was missing something. Maybe some stuffing mix in the casserole instead of only on top. Also, some tobasco in the white sauce might give it some zip. All in all, I'd make it again-I'd just tweak it a bit to make it yummy instead of just ok.

I thought this was really good and the rest of the family was in agreement. i changed a few things...I added 4 cups of turkey (i was worried it would be watery) and i added double the breadcrumbs on top. The kids loved it and went back for seconds. 
Thanks for the great leftover recipe!

This was easy to make and pretty good but I agree with everyone else that it was a little bland. My husband didn't care for all the mashed potatoes on top, he suggested less potatoes and more stuffing on top. Probably could use some more flavoring also. I will give this another try and just add some stuff next time.
