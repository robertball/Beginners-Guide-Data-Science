Hubby and I enjoyed this very much. I did use beef broth rather than beer, but that was the biggest change I made. The chops were tender and moist. The flavor was subtle, but still delicious. I thickened the sauce at the end, and served these with spaetzle and green beans.

This was absolutely wonderful!  I stuck to the recipe except I added a little flour to the onion, mushroom & garlic mixture to make the gravy a little thicker.  I added red chopped onions and served over butter noodles. The beer added to the recipe gave the taste and smell of cooking with white wine. I also simmered the mixture for about 30 minutes since the loin chops were very thick. This is a definate keeper for our family.   EXCELLENT RECIPE, VERY QUICK AND EASY!!!

This looked and smelled like a flavorful dish but it was very bland.  I think wine or apple cider would add more flavor than what the beer did for it.  Maybe it needed to be a stout beer.

These were really good but the sauce was a little thin so I added a little flour to make it a little thicker.  I will make this again it was a simple but flavorful recipe.

This was great, I used a very dark beer to make this, and the flavor was great. I was afraid it would be too beery but was just yummy. My beer loving fiance told me he would have to eat his left overs in the break room at work to show them off.

I followed the recipe exact.  Pork was moist, but we did not find it flavorful at all - found it very bland, and had to thicken sauce at end with cornstarch.

I modified this recipe for a bit more flavor. With the modifications, it was excellent. I added diced red onions, fresh tomato chunks, lime juice, and pepper flakes. I added spices to the flour used to coat pork. I add the extra 4oz of beer to the noodles as they boiled. Pork was tender and flavor was great. (note - to reduce calories, I used a low cal margarine in place of butter) This will be a new favorite for my family
