I added red pepper flakes and a small amount of onion (just to my liking). I loved it and will make it again and again!!

Thanks for the recipe!  I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and used a whole tbs of mustard.  Other than that I made it as is and ate it as is.  It made a very filling breakfast.

Another time I would use less cayenne. Also it turned brown by the next day because of the avocado. Added some lemon juice to freshen the flavour. Apart from the above, it was pretty good.

Probably my fault but this did not come out too well. It also changed its color quickly...
