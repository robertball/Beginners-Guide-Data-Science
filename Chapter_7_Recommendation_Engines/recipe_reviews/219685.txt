I thought this tasted pretty good. I made just 1 serving. I used lite coconut milk, 1 packet of Truvia for the sugar, and I had to subtitute a peach for the mangos in juice. I would like to try it though with the mangos. I didn't have shaved ice, to measure, so I just used 4 ice cubes. The chocolate with the fruit was an interesting touch. This is not a smoothie that would be a regular as coconut cream is kind of high in sat. fat and sugar, but I did enjoy trying it.
