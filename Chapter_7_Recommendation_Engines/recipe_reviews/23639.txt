I altered this recipe a little when I made it the first time and my whole family loved them!  Even my 10 month old protested loudly when I walked away after giving him a bite! I replaced 1/2 cup of the graham crumbs for flour, reduced the milk to 3/4 cup and replaced the 1/4 cup with butter, and I used sugar instead of honey since my baby would be eating them.  They were really yummy!  I will be making them again for sure!

Change the sugar to 1/2 cup and add a teaspoon of vanilla.  Sweet and perfect.  Not bland at all that way.

This a good recipe to make with kids. I made 18 servings not 10 and used 2 eggs instead of 1 and 3/4. I did it with a preschool class and let them crush the graham crackers. We used double zip lock bags,made sure the air was  out and small wooden hammers and rollers. They had fun. The muffins were delicious. We added cin. and vanilla and I'm not sure how much but we weren't stingy.Everyone loved them.

My husband said these were the best muffins I ever made. Of course, I was 1/2 cup short on milk so I substituted melted butter, so that might have had something to do with it...but they were definitely moist and delicious.

I wasn't all that impressed with these muffins.  I added chocolate chips to the recipe (without the chocolate chips, I probably would have rated these with three stars).  I also took the recommendation of reducing the milk to 3/4 cups and adding 1/4 cup of butter.  A food processor with the metal blade attachment works great for crumbing the graham crackers!

Wow! These are great for kids. Simplistic taste. I needed to make muffins for a school 'tea party'. Came across this recipe. No grahams in the house so I used ginger snaps instead (though I did add 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour to ligthen the taste).  Perfect! I bet you could use vanilla wafers, too.

This was a good way to use up some graham crackers.  (2 pkg.+ 1 whole cracker= 2.5 cups)  I was perplexed that there was no oil in the recipe and read all the reviews and no one mentioned that they were dry.  I added 1 tbsp. applesauce w/the milk to equal 1 cup.  Added a handful of raisins, 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, and 1/4 tsp. salt.  I did find that they smelled nice during baking but still were a bit bland.  I'm not sure how these could be perked up.  They were nice and moist; no dryness at all which was surprising.  This made 6 giant size muffins.  They did rise up nicely and a sinch to make but a bit bland even with some additions.

I have tried a lot of recipes but this one will always be my favorite one for muffins. It is Super easy. I add a handful of golden raisins and occasionally some SKOR baking bits.  Yummy.  (I usually make six large muffins instead of 12 small ones.)

They were so bland even after I took the comments of adding 1/2 cup sugar, cinnamon and vanilla. I made them this morning to bring to a friends house, and now I have to make something else. They also didn't shape into a muffin coming out of the muffin pan. They came out looking like a blob.

I had an excess of graham crackers, and this recipe looked easy. My kids had fun crushing the graham crackers and devouring the muffins. I followed the recipe as is and it was great, but I don't like sickeningly sweet things.

Very tasty! I didn't have whole milk, so used the 1% that I did have. Still very good! A nice low fat muffin, with only 3 Weight Watcher points! Even my picky husband, who won't look at anything if it isn't chocolate, ate them up! A keeper for me.

This was so easy and I love that you don't use butter or oil in it. However, I did think it was kind of blah tasting. Too boring. I thought the graham cracker taste would be a bit stronger. I might try it again with chocolate chips in the batter and maybe even a marshmallow icing.

Really,really good. I made them once with the graham crackers and added chopped pecans to the batter. Delicious and moist!

I made them again but used oreo cookie crumbs this time and added walnut pieces to the batter. SOOOOOOOOOO good and easy.

Do be aware that they don't rise very much! 
Yum.. thanks!

This recipe was fairly bland on its own, but it does well with the addition of nuts, chocolate chips, etc... I tried a few variations, and my favorite was when I melted butterscotch chips and added them to the batter. They turned out wonderful!

This recipe is good but plain. I followed the recipe exactly but added chocolate chips to some of the muffins. They tasted much better than the muffins without chips. Nuts would also have been a good addition.

These were a little plain for me. I would like to try them again with nuts and chocolate chips or maybe even put some jam in the middle. They were really easy to make though. I used skim milk and they turned out fine.

First, I don’t think people can accurately review a recipe when they don’t make it according to the authors recipe.  I ignored the revised recipes and made it as is and it was great.  Very moist.  Only thing I will do different is add a little fruit.  May need a little flour depending on how juicy the fruit is.

This is a great recipe.  I tried it just to get rid of some graham crackers that had been in my cabinet for a long time.  The recipe is so good that I'll buy more graham crackers just to make this recipe.  I basically followed the ingredients listed in the recipe, except I substituted the 2 TBS honey with 1 TBS white sugar.  I reduced the milk to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup melted butter.  Added 1 tsp. vanilla and walnuts.  I didn't have choc chips, but I did have chocolate kisses which I hammered to pieces and added to the batter.  Beware:  I believe the oven temp listed as 200 degree C is incorrect.  I used 350 C.

Very quick and easy to make. I liked these a lot, but I'm not really a fan of anything super sweet. They taste a bit like bran muffins. I also used 2% instead of whole milk, and I think the recipe was still great.

The muffins are perfect as is, but I added chopped strawberries and stuffed them with a cold ball of cream cheese (with sugar and vanilla). They were a big hit at the office.

Thanks.  This is a good recipe that doesn't involve flour.  I added cloves, allspice, and cinnamon.  Muffins were very small.  I would say this entire recipe makes 6 normal-sized muffins, not 10.

I altered this recipe because it just seemed to bland, and I can't follow a recipe to the letter, ever.   I added some cinnamon (to taste I guess, a little over a tsp.) and vanilla extract and it really added alot to these little muffins.   Great quick breakfast muffin.   The second time around I added some wheat germ to add some extra nutrients, seems to be okay with that.   Great low fat muffin that is quick to make.

Delicious and easy recipe! I added chocolate chips, a teaspoon of vanilla and a shake or two of cinnamon. Oddly, although I followed the recipe amounts, mine only made 8 small muffins. I'll have to up the amounts next time.

I loved this recipe - I made it in a loaf pan. I ran out of milk - so used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup yogurt which gave it a distinct flavor. I also did not use any sugar - just honey.

these were very good muffins, however mine turned out to be a little too moist, next time i'm cooking them at a higher temp.  TIP: add a splash of hazelnut coffe creamer

These were nice, but a little short on flavor.  I'm not sure I'd make them again.

This was a pretty doggone good muffin.  It literally tasted like a graham cracker!  I only had skim milk, so I added a little butter.  I added some chocolate chips to some, and won't make that mistake again!  Though they were good, I thought the chocolate took away from the graham cracker taste.  I couldn't really taste the graham in those at all -- they tasted like an ordinary chocolate chip muffin.

While reading this recipe, I thought for sure they were going to be a bust -  but I had a bunch of left over graham crumbs so I gave it a shot. My first thought was, "where's the salt and fat in this recipe?" So I added 1 t. salt and 2 T. margarine to the recipe. The batter didn't taste very good and the texture looked off. I still spooned it into muffing tins and baked according to the recipe. I was amazed that they turned out moist and with great texture. The flavor improved for sure, but these are still very bland. I will make them again, but I will add some almond or vanilla extract and maybe some dried cranberries. Great recipe for those who love graham crackers, but as is, it needs some personal touch and improvement to suit the bakers' taste.

These muffins were awesome!  A great way to use up leftover graham cracker crumbs you bought to make a cheesecake crust.  Very good taste and very unique.  My boyfriend loved them!

I also was skeptical of the recipe as is, so I added some cinnamon and a 1/2 cup of flour.  It really doesn't require any oil or butter! They still come out moist. Very good with jam.

I had leftover graham crackers and this recipe was delicious! I added some ground cinnamon and a touch of ground all spice. I think they would be really good with some raisins in them too!

These are terrific. I used nonfat vanilla soy milk instead of whole milk, and I made 24 mini muffins instead of bigger ones. Perfect for fans of graham crackers and just sweet enough.
