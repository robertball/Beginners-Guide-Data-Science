These were tasty!  Not sure where they got their name, as they look nothing like ribbons, but still a good cookie.  Subbed blackberry jam because of a friend's preference, but I think they would have been even better with raspberry preserves.  I had to add an additional Tbsp of evaporated milk to the glaze to make it thin enough to drizzle.  I think this would be an excellent recipe adapted with lemon flavoring in the cookie and blueberry preserves for the filling!

These were a huge hit with my family and my church. The ladies at my church recently had a cookie exchange in which I made these and I was told by several that their families thought these were the best. The only change I made was that I used Raspberry pie filling instead of raspberry jam. These are so easy to make and go quickly.

Yummy!  I followed the recipe to the letter except that we didn't have raspberry jam so I substituted what we had...  orange marmalade.  Also, our oven is overly hot so I baked for 8 minutes, filled the cookies, and then finished off with another 5 minutes of baking.  The cookies came out perfectly and the marmalade filling was delicious!  The yield was 3 dozen and even though there's only my wife and myself here they're already half gone one hour later!  Like I said...  YUMMY!  Thanks for sharing!

I had eaten these cookies at a recent holiday cookie exchange I attended and they were delicious!  I had no idea who made them so when I came home I went on this site and found this recipe, made them and they were exactly what I had eaten.  Made the recipe as written and I love them!  Will add them to my Christmas baking list!

The cookies have a nice sandy texture.  They taste buttery.  I found it to be a bit too sweet, but my husband did not.  I tried few different jams but the raspberry definately comes out the best.  Would only use raspberry next time.  Did not use glaze as I did not want to open a whole can of evaporated milk just to use the tiny bit called for.
