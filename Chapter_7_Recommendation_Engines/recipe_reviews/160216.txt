Never seen or had a sauce combining cucumber & tomato. In fact, I never had a cooked cucumber ( I think..).  But my tiny (not even that) garden produced a few tomatoes & cucumbers and I was at loss  what to do with them.  so I typed "tomato sauce" and I came up with this one.. I am a beginner, bad one at that. I am far better at booking restaurant reservation than knowing kitchen jargons. ie. I know when I taste good one but I would never be able to cook one.   Well, this tastes great when I cooked it..  I am thinking, I can eat this with chips, perhaps french bread, if all fail, I will just eat this sauce as a meal. WONDERFUL!

This is a delightful, fresh tasting sauce with a twist.  I put it over angel hair pasta.  My husband and I enjoyed the flavors.  My advice is to taste the sauce after 2 tsp. of sugar are added and decide if you want to add the rest.  I stopped at 2 1/2, any more would have been way too much for our taste.

I was expecting an Italian flavored sauce that I'd throw in the freezer.  What I got was an amazingly flavored sauce with a Thai flair! Something in it - maybe the cucumber seeds have the consistency of ground nuts.  There is a slight heat to it, as well.  I envision using it as a marinade, a sauce or a dressing.  It's delicious.

My mother and I loved this; my father pushed it away after a couple of mouthfuls, finding it too sweet. It was very sweet, and I will cut the sugar in half next time, but will definitely make it again; I loved the combination of the veggies.

I was truly surprised how good this was.  Had NEVER cooked cucumber in any type of recipe and the only reason I made this was because I needed to use a cucumber and I was tired of eating it raw in salads!  I did use chopped sweet onion and I sauteed it with the bell pepper, garlic & basil before adding the rest of the ingredients to simmer.  I used a potato masher to make the sauce a slightly smoother consistency and served it mixed with rotini pasta.

My fiance, who doesn't like cucumber raw, LOVED this recipe. He kept asking what spices were in it. I added less than a tsp of sugar, just enough to take away the bite. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Thanks for sharing!!

I gave the recipe 4 stars only because I added a few things of my own.  I used 6 medium tomatoes, to make it more tomatoei, I used a chocolate pepper instead of red, and I added a pobllano pepper.  I also cooked it longer.  I like letting sauces simmer for a while and digest if you will.  I topped it off with a few sprigs of rosemary, and it was amazing!  I'll definitly make it again!

The sauce was very hearty.  My husband thought too sweet.  I thought the cucumbers (main ingredient) were not good in combination with the other ingredients.

Really enjoyed this.  Like many who hadn't, I braised cucumbers after seeing Julie and Julia and loved them, so cooking cukes didn't worry me as it might have otherwise.  Did cut the sugar as suggested, I think the cukes must counteract the acidicity of the tomatoes, so unsure if sugar is even necessary at all.  My only complaint is that I shouldn't have made pasta ;) just the sauce and the crusty homemade pain du sel would've been okay by me.

This recipe appealed to me due to the over productive cucumbers in my garden.  I used only 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, and it still had a little too much spice for my children.  I also used just 2 tsp sugar on the advice of other reviewers.  I'll use 1 1/2 tsp next time.  While I won't make this recipe frequently, it's a good way to add some variety with summer garden abundance.

When I found too much cucumber in my refrigerator, and was tired of the same old cucumber recipe, I searched the site and found this recipe.  I must admit; I wasn't completely sold when I read it, but I thought I'd give it a try - and I was not let down!  I absolutely love this recipe - and my family loved it too!  The only thing I really did different was substitute the dried seasonings for a general Italian seasoning mix.  Other than cutting the vegetables up into pieces that were slightly too big (I'll go smaller next time), I wouldn't change a thing!

I liked it, used less sugar.  I thought it was very spicy, but my husband didn't think it was at all.  It was good and something different.

Made this one and everyone loved it. Even the veggie-phobes. The cucumbers give it a sweet taste that is unexpected in a sauce. I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes and a little less sugar. Easy-peasy and all gone!

The cucumber-tomato combination didn't taste well to us. It was very hearty and fun to make, just a little too different and sweet for our taste.

Good recipe.  I put grilled sausages in it and placed it over spaghetti squash (baked cut size down at 350 degrees with garlic butter) and it was delicious!
