I made it open-faced, only 1 waffle, because I thought it would be too much waffle with 2. Waffle, then apples, cinnamon, cheese, topped with sausage links cut in half length wise. It was just the right balance of flavors, very good. Dipped in a little syrup.

The waffle wasn't great. I would definitely prefer it with an English muffin for a bread.

Perfect for breakfast, lunch or brunch. The flavors of this sandwich blend perfectly. I used pork sausage patties in place of the links. I will definitely be making these again. Thank you for sharing CreoleMom.
