Of the recipes available, I chose this as a cook who combines favorite recipes is a person after my own heart - especially as Hoppin John can be made in a variety of ways, as long as it has a couple of key ingredients.  I found this recipe easy to use and very tasty.  I made it to accompany collards, corn bread, benne wafers, and Carolina Gold rice for good luck and wealth in the new year (not bad for a Yankee boy).  I would add a few pointers.  In the South, neck bones are a preferred addition as they have tasty meat on them.  I have also used hocks or hog jowls although the latter can be fatty and should be discarded midway through the cooking.  I would not use a bone from a sweet ham such as "Honey Baked" as they do not have the same flavor.    I also add a couple of diced tomatoes at the end of the cooking for color and interest.  They should be cooked briefly and not allowed to boil down.  This time, I misjudged the salt and added too much.  To counteract the effects, I added a couple of red potatoes to the pot cut in thin medallions.  They absorbed the extra salt.  I removed them before they became too soft and, not wanting to waste them, put them on a plate.  They were delicioius, espeically with the Hoppin John on top!!! This would be a great alternative for those who do not like rice.

Folks, the ham bone is necessary to this dish. It contributes a lot of the flavor. If you don't have a ham bone, this isn't going to come out very well, and it's not going to be the recipe's fault. This is delicious if you make it according to the directions. It's rich and really nicely flavored--the best hoppin' john I've ever made.

This may have made the difference between a 3* and higher, but I was unable to get my hands on a ham bone. I followed the recipe exactly for the rest. It was hearty, filling, and great for a cold December night. It was suggested by my dinner mate that the addition of 'color' like red pepper and corn might increase the flavour. Recommended!

Let me start by saying that I hate black-eyed peas, but annually try them on New Years day!!  This was the best I have had.  I couldn't find a ham bone, like some other people, but I just used a package of diced ham I found at the grocery by the bacon.  Everyone loved them and there were no left overs.  The search is over for a Black-eyed Pea recipe!  This is  a keeper!

We thoroughly enjoyed this, except for my picky son - he just picked out the ham and ate it. Made with leftover ham - but did not have the bone.  Still very good.  The wine added a nice flavor, but you could substitute more chicken stock if you like.

I loved this soup! The only thing I did different is I did use any water, just extra chicken broth. And I didn't have a ham bone so I used a smoked turkey leg. And I didn't put in any rice, it was great without it. Serve with Tasty Collard Greens and Cornbread, perfect for a cold day!

Excellent! I used 2 ham hocks instead, and added a can of drained diced tomatoes towards the end.  Kids and husband liked it for our New Years meal!

This is definitely a Five-Star recipe. My family loved it. I did have to add more chicken broth on the second day for leftovers, but didn't make a difference.  It was great!

This recipe is very good!  I changed it by adding some cayenne pepper and a pinch of cajun spice.  I also had already boied my ham bone for soup so I fried the cubes pieces in the olive oil instead of the bone.  Very good!!  I'm having some for lunch today.  :)

I didn't have white wine, so I used beer instead!  Like other reviewers, I used chicken broth instead of water.  Oh yeah, and I didn't have b.e.p., so I used black beans.  Delicious.  We ate it over brown rice.

This was OK.  Not great or spectacular, but OK.  Just remember that you don't want the soup mixture to be too thick before adding the rice.  I will make this again, but will probably add a can of RoTel tomatoes.

Absolutely delicious! Despite getting confused between the recipe and its photo, I opted to added the rice directly to the bean mixture. It helped to absorb the extra moisture. This will be our New Year's favorite! ??

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!! I didn't have a ham bone, but, being a Southern girl that didn't deter me. I boiled smoked turkey necks until the meat separated from the bones. Removed the bones and skin & shredded the meat & added it to the peas. I used 2 cups of the liquid from the turkey necks (and only 2 cups of water), to add more flavor. I strained & rinsed a can of petite diced tomatoes and added them after the peas were finished cooking. DELICIOUS!!!

Awesome recipe. I have heard that eating Black-eyed Peas on New Year's Day will bring good luck for the whole year soI made this tasty soup and used this recipe as a 'jump off' point. (I always research many recipes and pull together my own dish. Be brave with your cooking!) 

Browning the ham bone is the key to this recipe. It gives the oil that great salty smokey flavor that the veggies get to soak up when you cook them in it. Yum. 
I added alot of elements and changed a few things but def a keeper recipe.

Enjoyed it. Used 2 10-oz bags of frozen black-eyed peas to save on soaking time. Delicious southern food. Great leftovers, too.

I love it that you made your own recipe from a collection of others. I made it, following the recipe, and it turned out really bland. I added mild Cajun seasoning and it was still pretty lackluster. I think it might have been the quality of the black-eyed peas. Thank you for putting your creative design out there. I'll definitely try it again.

Excellent recipe!  I scaled back some of the ingredients since I barely had 1 cup of black eye peas in my pantry.  Also, only used one tablespoon of wine.  I was skeptical about how wine would taste in black eye peas.  The end product was phenomenal.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I used a pound of dried beans. Soaked them overnight and cooked them on the stove until done.   Loved the flavor that the wine brought. Definitely a keeper.

We ate the ham early in the week leaving the bone to use. I also let the bone stay in the beans as they cooked the day in the crockpot.

Better than our family recipe!  I followed all the directions except for the wine.  Ham Hock is a must, brings in the smoky ham taste!  I pulled out bone and fat before serving.  We should have great luck this year cause we ate it all!!!

We never stir the rice in but eat the stew part over the rice. It was so good. Great recipe.

Super good. My moms says to garnish with sour cream and a little hot sauce, or green onions. I live on the edge and put them all in. Very tasty. Thank you for posting

I've followed this recipe on New Year's Day for the past several years and so far, so good.  I do make slight changes for good luck (adding kielbasa coins for one) and I try to use dried peas and soak them the night before.  The family keeps coming back each year for a bowl, so I'd say it's a keeper.  One word of caution, salt sparingly, especially if using canned peas, until you know how much salt will release from the ham.

I have made this recipe several times.  My wife and I really like it and it's a crowd pleaser.  I add a little more chicken broth because I like alot of broth.  I also use dried peas.  It is worth the effort to rehydrate them - so much more flavourful than canned peas.

Excellent!  I made this for New Year's Day with a very meaty ham bone left over from our Christmas ham.  It was outstanding!  I followed the directions almost exactly, except that I put less rice in because it was already pretty thick.  It was rich and smokey and very flavorful.  The kids loved it too.  There were barely any leftovers because everyone had more than one serving.  (I think using an actual ham bone is essential for the correct full flavor.)  Loved it!

I make this recipe every year on New Year's Day. I don't like collards, so I add a green pepper and a can of diced tomatoes. A few dashes of Tobasco finish it. Served over rice it's gone in one sitting.

This turned out tasty, however, I used dry beans which take significantly longer to cook and need at least double the liquid which turned out a little annoying.

Didn't want the bulk of including the rice, so made the recipe as written except for adding the rice.  This tasted great, maybe isn't traditional Hoppin' John that way, but way way way better than just serving the obilgatory New Year's black eyed peas plain.

I made this for the first time this year, and it was pretty good. I gave it four stars because, being a Northerner, I don't really know what it was supposed to taste like. I made as written (after searching all over my small city for a store that carried ham bones), except I browned the ham bone, onions and celery on the stove, then cooked it all day in the slow cooker. I added in the beans and some pre-cooked quinoa (instead of the nutritionally useless rice) about two hours before service, and I used homemade turkey stock instead of chicken stock because I had it on hand. I also added some greens and halved grape tomatoes at the end, for color and nutrition. I might make it again, but rarely, because I found it to be extremely strong in the ham flavor and rather greasy, I guess because of the ham bone. It's tasty, but left me craving a salad, even with the added veg. I'll try to remember to get some Hoppin John if I can the next time I visit the South so I can see what I'm missing.

One of the best blackeyed pea recipes I've tried.  Must admit it was better than my own!

I hate reviewing a recipe after changing it up so much, but... this recipe is really bland with no seasoning to liven it up.  My changes: only had 3 people eating, so slightly reduced amounts of some things (but not onion or garlic, never those!) to wind up with a meal and manageable leftovers.  Also used about 1/2 lb of pulled pork (smoked by DH, so quite flavorful) in place of the ham bone and ham.  The dish was good, but not flavorful, if that makes sense.  A very generous dose of hot sauce made it pretty tasty, though.  Will make again, but will also add a Tbsp of cajun seasoning to the pot and work from there.

I had everything ready then discovered my ham bone in the freezer had freezer-burn. The store was out of all pork except boneless loin, so I chopped up 4 pieces of bacon and fried with the celery and onions.  We enjoyed this very much.  The only white wine I had on hand was our local white apple cider wine and it was really extremely nice with the ham and black-eyed-peas.  The recipe did need more liquid and since I had no more chicken stock, I poured in a little more of the apple cider wine.  It was not overly salty like some ham dishes can be and worked in nicely with my gluten-free diet.

I had to tweak just a tad given what I had on hand... I had already used my ham bone, so I used Better Than Bullion's Ham Stock to make up the flavor. Wonderful stuff! I use it for any recipe with ham in it (such as pea soup or potato soup). I also didn't have celery, so omitted it. Finally, because I was trying to cut down on time, I put the rice in the steamer to cook while the peas cooked on the stove. I then mixed together for about 10 minutes to get the finished dish. My husband spiced his up with cayenne and Tabasco, but I liked it as is.

This was amazing! I made it as directed except used dry black eyed peas that I cooked ahead of time. It is so wonderful! Oh, I didn't have any wine, so I skipped that, but can imagine the extra layer of flavor it would add. Very good!

Why can I no longer add recipes to my recipe box or print out the recipes?  I can not find anything on the site to do this any more.  This is very discouraging. This recipe is a 5 star.
