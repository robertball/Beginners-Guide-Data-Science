Sounds like a good midweek mac and cheese recipe but true southern mac and cheese recipes never begins with a processed cheese mix!!!

I googled a Mac & cheese receipt and yours looked easy and the reviews sold me. It was for a church group X-mas dinner. I doubled the receipt and could not wait to try. By the time I got to my Mac & cheese on the buffet my huge Casserole was about gone. Everyone was raving how good it was. 
Thanks Chris for posting. 
Oh, my wife was very skeptical on how good it could be. She apologized and agreed it was easy and a hit.  "Dodged  that bullet".

Hey Chris, this is awesome mac and cheese, we love it here.  Anyway only a few comments, we did a triple batch (obvously more then one of us), I'd recommend keeping the butter at a 1/2 cup its more then enough.  We also used mozarella in addition to the cheddar, it was awesome.  The families own personal favorite is lobster with the mac and cheese, but you sothern folks could definitely substitute crawfish, I know I would if I could get them.  But just like the receipe says this is one awesome mac and cheese definitely 5 stars thanks for sharing Chris.

This was the PERFECT recipe. I have tried dozens, and this is definitely the BEST southern mac n cheese casserole ever. I made it for the guys while they were watching football, and they were licking their plates clean.

Chris, I made your recipe January 6th at a dinner celebration for what would have been my mama's 94th birthday party.  Mama passed away in November.  Friends and family raved about the mac and cheese, and there wasn't a spoonful left (I doubled the recipe).  Mac and cheese was one of my mama's favorites.   Anne-Marie

This was wonderful! I doubled the servings and made it for the first time for family on Chirstmas Eve. HIT! As, someone suggested...I too, reduced the butter down to 1/2 cup..I may possibly do even a little less next time. BUT, this is a keeper for our family now! Been waiting on a M and C recipe like this one!

We made this for 25 boys at the West End School in Louisville, KY. This school is a free, private, college preparatory, Pre-K through Eighth school for at risk young men that are smart and have a chance to change their lives through education and high expectations. Every meal they are served is donated with the help of the community and/or donations. Many of these boys have gone hungry prior to attending the school so I made enough for 50 servings. THEY ATE IT ALL! It was so good and perfect for a large crowd. I served it with sloppy joes(also great for large crowds). They went on about how good the mac and cheese was:) It was truly a pleasure to serve these young men something they loved and appreciated!

For those who say a true southern Mac & cheese never comes out of a box, as did I, don't knock it until you try it! I feel like I have finally mastered a wonderful recipe for it but for times when I want something really quick, this was wonderful and truly a "southern" flavor.

Thanks Chris! Im from St. Augustine Fl and LOVE mac n cheese, this recipe is easy pleasy and gets a 5 star rating from the hubby and kids! Only change I made is a little garlic powder added to the cheese sauce. Ive made this recipe several times with whatever variations of shredded cheese on hand and no complaints from my picky eaters! Yummy cant wait to dig in!

I absolutely loved it. It was moist and creamy and didn't dry out.  However, the next time I make it I will definitely lessen the butter.  Good job Chris.

This is pretty good, but I would use about half the amount of butter next time.

Never made homemade mac and cheese before but I uses this recipe sort of like a base. Instead of strips of cheddar, I used shredded cheese. It turned out delicious and my family loved it.

I tried this, but was really not expecting it to be very good.  It was great!!  If you have doubts about using the boxed mac and cheese, forget them and go ahead and try this.  I used 2% sharp cheddar and only half of the butter called for in the recipe.  This will probably be my go-to mac and cheese from now on.  Thanks Chris!!

I brought this to my friends house for a bbq. Her mother specifically requested that I make the Mac n cheese for Thanksgiving! Everyone loved it! Mac n cheese is one of those dishes that is easy to mess up but you can’t go wrong with this recipe. The only change I made was to cut down the butter significantly.

Really good! I was hesitant also being you start out with the boxed one,  this is great!  Rich & creamy, Now if I don't feel like making a cheese sauce I have this!
I only used 1/4 stick of butter, that was enough, next time I will decrease the butter to 1/8. If you have unexpected company this is a quick dish to make.

Well color me astonished! I am an admitted Mac n cheese "snob", a purist who has used my grandma's recipe (which is basically this minus the eggs & cheese packets) for over 25 years and refused to stray. and when I saw that this recipe used a BOX, well, I confess i let out a big hurumph. HOWEVER...my DH grew up poor, and actually prefers all things boxed and canned, and although he has "learned" (double hmph!) to love my homemade cooking,and kept asking for a "creamier" Mac n cheese. my kids were horrified at the idea of anything but grams recipe, but after reading through this one I thought it was the best of both worlds and would give it a try, and boy am I glad I did! it really tastes just like my grandma's, only better! I doubled the recipe but kept the butter at 1 stick, only used 3 eggs, used 2 (8oz) bars of extra sharp cheddar and about 1/2c shredded mozzarella on the first layer. I always use about 1/4 tsp WHITE pepper and 1 1/4 tsp salt in my original so I kept it the same and it was perfect. baked it in my 3 qt glass casserole for about 40 minutes, which surprised me bc my grandma's usually takes a good hour and the ingredients are so similar, but I'm not complaining! all in all, we were all thrilled with the results... its close enough to my grandma's to taste familiar, but with that lil extra "something" to take it over the top. this will definitely be my new go-to Mac n cheese recipe! (sorry, Gram) thanx Chris!

I was very skeptical before I tried it because it called for mac and cheese Mix. It was the BEST mac and cheese I have ever eaten. My family devoured it!! I doubled the recipe and it easily feed 6 with enough left over to enjoy the next day. Thank you soo much for sharing this recipe!!!

Made it tonight for our hunting camp guys! It's is delicious! Very hearty. No changes to the actual recipe are needed in my opinion, unless maybe you're trying to cut fat content...but I suggest giving into the indulgence the way it is-just don't live on it :)

This was an easy recipe, and one of the best-tasting mac & cheese dishes I've ever had.  Be sure to add PLENTY of salt, and cover the last layer with the evaporated milk mixture or pasta-water so it reaches about 1/4" over the last cheese layer.  I cook this in a microwave on 70% power for 15 minutes, covered, and it comes out perfect.  One of our new favorites!

Easy to follow recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving and the family loved it. I am a GRIT(Louisiana) and it tasted like my grandma's mac and cheese.

I made this macaroni and cheese for the family and they loved it!!!  We are from the south and we know good southern macaroni and cheese and this is great. My husband thought I had called my aunt and gotten her recipe, but this is going to be my new recipe because it is quick, simple and delicious. Thanks so much for sharing!!!!

Chris, okay I just gotta say...... I am a HUGE Mac and Cheese lover. I found your recipe, thought the pic looked good, so I tried it. It was absolutely delicious! I, like others, also cut the Butter just a tad-bit and added some Mozzarella on top of the Cheddar but all in all, its a keeper and #1 in my book! Thanx for sharing and wonderful job!

I must admit the boxed Mac made me a bit skeptical on this being a real southern Mac n cheese. Home run!!! Tastes just like grandmas except a much easier process; different paths same destination :) I've made it several times now, each time it comes out bubbly and perfect and my family cheers!

This was a great cheesey Mac and cheese. It definitely makes a great "melty cheese" pasta.  My family liked it a lot more than "saucy cheese" style Mac n cheese.  Some even said it was the best Mac n cheese they ever had! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

Made this as written except I only used 1/4 cup of butter to cut back on the fat. My wife, who hates Mac and cheese, thought it was very good. Will make this again!

YUMMY!    I needed a mac and cheese dish to take to a family Christmas lunch.  I only had one box so I supplemented with additional noodles and doubled the other ingredients.   Using what I had on hand I added 1/4 cup shredded pepper jack and extra shredded cheddar. I followed the suggestion by another reviewer and did not double the butter.   Lots of compliments and everyone wanted a share of the leftovers!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I follow this recipe except:                                                        I use block cheese.  I find the pre-sliced to be a bit oily.  I used half sharp cheddar and Colby, both from blocks.

I'm a Black man whose parents, siblings and relatives were/ are very good cooks. As a consequence I've been exposed to many Chicago and Atlanta based southern style dishes. I am myself the cook for my family and have perfected many traditional recipes over the years. Mac and cheese is a staple during the holidays and you are judged by your Corn Bread Dressing and Mac & Cheese. I usually take the long route and buy five different cheeses and make mine from scratch but this is a Great shortcut. I was skeptical when I first saw this recipe, but after making it a few times, it has become a favorite in my house, (son loves it). I took away a star because I had to make a few adjustments. I add 1 cup(or more) of sharp shredded, or triple cheddar to add with the other cheeses. The addition of the butter in the recipe really help this recipe, although I never use the recommended amount,( 1/4 less).

Overall, Very Good recipe. I would/have recommended this one.
PS. Never count on cooking times. Most cooks check their food during the cooking process and I've routinely take this out of the oven ahead of time. When you think  it's not done, that's the  time to take it,  just before its firm,  because it will continue cooking when you take it out

My family LOVES this mac and cheese. I have an autistic son who is very resistant to trying new foods. This variation on his favorite Kraft Mac and Cheese won him over. When he is having a rough, over stimulating day, he will ask for this dish. He likes a little crunch so we add some Panko bread crumbs to the top. Thanks from a grateful mom for sharing!!

Am commenting again because I didn't see the 1 star review based on the fact that the recipe starter is box mac n cheese. I'm southern and my family were mostly dirt poor. If they could get hold of something cheap - i.e. a box of store bought mac n cheese and build it into something like this they did.

I just made this and it came out a curdled mess!! I am guessing the cooking time is way off.  Most homemade Mac n cheese recipes bake for 20 minutes.  Also, the recipe does not specify how many noodles to use.  I assumed the box of mac n cheese that the cheese packet came in...Also, I read that the brand of cheddar cheese is important.  Apparently, Cabbot does not curdle.  I am going to retry with the above changes.  I really hope this comes out well.  I had high hopes for this recipe based on the other reviews.

Are you supposed to use a bag of elbow macaroni noodles? The box of macaroni noodles is hardly enough to make one layer in a casserole dish. Very confused it turned out terrible. All grainy and weird

Always a hit either for home or the dreaded pot luck but easy and adaptable.  I usually make a double batch now and stick to the original butter ratio but will increase the cheese by about 25% but that is not fixed. Like others this recipe works well with mixing up cheeses according to what you have on hand. Depending on the container I have found the wet ingredients may not need to be automatically doubled to reach the top. A generous panko topping seams to help if  you are plagued/troubled  by seemingly excessive butter right after cooking but resting a few minutes seams to solve this anyway.

Lets start with the fact that I was about 1/4 cup shy on evaporated milk.  I used the boiled macaroni water per the directions.  The results were a less than flavorful, cheese and noodle separation from one another. Not sure if I'll try to make it again or not.  My two experts (10 year old boys) both agreed plain Kraft Mac n cheese is better.   Wawa !! (insert game show losing noise here)

something went amiss here. the only thing I used different was a box of Annie's organic Mac and cheese instead of kraft. the cheese curdled, was not at all creamy and there was a greasy film on top. there's nothing like homemade but in this case the box alone would've tasted better! I've been cooking for over 20 years so I don't believe it was inexperience on my part but I must have done something wrong.

I'm with everyone else, this is the BEST Mac n' Cheese I've ever had.  I made it as directed and was only slightly disappointed that I slightly overcooked the Macaroni.  I cooked it for 8 minutes and next time will knock that down to 6.5 minutes.  I did add a little cayenne pepper and would next time, add just a little more.  I like it to just pop but not be hot!  Finally, next time I will cut down the amount of butter, just as everyone warned!

The taste was great, but it called for a little too much butter. Next time I'll cut the amount in half. Other than that, my family loved it.

I made it with no changes.  It was okay, but not very creamy.  I'll try again sometime.

This macaroni and cheese is excellent made exactly as it. The only thing that I change is that I boil the noodles a little longer and I do not add any additional water to cover because if you have to add water, it does not taste nearly as good. Macaroni and cheese snobs who like to comment that this isn't a true southern mac and cheese are missing out. It has all of the ingredients in a true southern mac and cheese. The only difference is that you also add a powder pack to the recipe. You can't even tell that it's added. I never tell anyone when I make this that it starts with a box and they do not have a clue. I have made it several times and everyone loves it!!

I made this recipe the original way and the kids liked it.  I modified it the second time around and instead of using powdered cheese I used shredded sharp cheddar.    I also used cubes of sliced sharp cheddar instead of the slices.  The hubby had seconds, which is an excellent sign! I can't wait to have this as leftovers.  This is my new go to recipe, with slight modifications, but that doesn't change the fact that this recipe works for getting you that cheesy, sticky, thick macaroni and cheese that so many of us adore.

This was a great recipe. I made this dish for Thanksgiving for my son . I did make a couple of little changes though, like I added a jar of liquid Cheese with the evaporated milk mixture and then topped the hole thing off with shredded cheddar cheese for that chesey professional look and taste .. my son and his friends could not get enough of it

I've been following this recipe for several years now.  it's always a hit, and very easy too.  every once in a while i stray and try another, and every time, i come back to this one!  I have used both cheese singles as well as shredded cheeses and different blends.  no matter, it's always a hit!  i do use a cracker topping at times as well, but it's great w/o it.  I'm making this today with BBQ'd pork ribs.  Yum!!  Enjoy~

Just made this dish for my grandma's 70th birthday dinner and everybody loved it! 
I had to double the recipe for a bigger crowd and I made some slight changes based on other reviews.. I cut the butter in half, used one less egg then the recipe called for and used a mix of shredded cheese. I would definitely make this again, it was super easy and a crowd pleaser..

Great flavor! I will definitely try again. Next time I will omit the pepper.  I don't like pepper so I only added a little.  Felt like I tasted it in every bite.  Also, mine came out dry.  I think I will cook it a little less next time.  Maybe only 35 minutes? But overall very good!

LOVE this recipe. I made it the first time because I was looking for quick and easy.   I keep making it because it's great and my friends always request it. Like other reviewers, I use 1/2 as much butter and it's still very rich.

I made this last night and doubled the recipe. upon reading reviews of it not being seasoned , being from south Louisiana where everything is seasoned well, i added upon whisking cajun seasoning, pepper, garlic powder, and a dash of dry parsley. I only used 1/2 cup of butter for double recipe and still had to drain some off after cooking. I also used shredded 3 cheese through out and sliced cheese on top. It was divine and will do again!

I made this Mac and Cheese recipe back over the summer for a cookout and got extremely positive reviews and people wanting the recipe.  Now as Thanksgiving is approaching the dish everyone wanted me to bring was the Mac and Cheese I made over the summer.  The only deviation I made from the original recipe was to use only half the amount of butter.  Thanks for a great all time favorite southern recipe.

Made this last night...so freaking good!  I used about 1/2 of the butter and it was still very creamy and moist.  I also used the Sargento Shredded Cheddar three cheese blend (instead of sliced) and that added some delicious dimension. This will be my new mac and cheese go to recipe!!

I had my doubts. It seemed too simple to be as delicious as it actually tasted.  I used shredded mild cheddar cheese instead of slices and spray margarine instead of butter.  In the last couple of minutes, I also used the broiler to brown the top of the macaroni and cheese.  It looked wonderful and tasted great.

It perfect to A t! I used real shredded cheese (chedder, mozarella, and three cheese) and block sharp chedder cheese, instead of processed slice cheeses, and added buttermilk over my layers, need less to say, it taste awesome. Over all good recipe with a few of my changes :)

I used 1/3 of the butter called for as others commented that it was greasy.  My new found favorite is shredded velveta in the refrigerated section at Wal-Mart grocery section.  I used that instead of cheddar slices.  It pulled the dish together.  We really liked this, but admit we too were skeptical using boxed mac and cheese.....  Thank you Chris.

Wow this was good! I used a box of Kraft Sharp Cheddar Deluxe. I did end up pouring some butter off the top when it came out of the oven, and im thinking that maybe I coulda got away with using less in the first place but yeah...definitely making this again - thank you!!

I used this as a base recipe for our recent mac and cheese dish and it turned out great. I used regular elbow macaroni and pepperjack cheese instead of a cheese packet. Followed the rest of the recipe and everyone loved it. Thanks!

This is a great recipe because it's an enhanced version of box mac and cheese which has been around for decades! Everybody loves the flavor!

This was awesome! I made a double batch and froze the rest in individual portions. It heated up well! Next time I'm adding bacon!

I made a double batch of this recipe yesterday as part of a southern BBQ themed meal yesterday.  It was very easy to put together and cooked up lots of a crusty cheese around the edges and across the top which was wonderful.  I would give 5 stars but I found the casserole to be a bit more dense than I would I would have liked.  I only used half the butter (which was still a whole stick of butter) and that might be why?  One reviewer called it "eggy" and I think that's accurate.  I'd try it again but with fewer eggs and possibly more milk.  All in all though, it was good.

I tried this recipe today and it came out delicious and perfect. It was very close to tasting like my mother'a. And that's really saying something. I added sour cream to the milk mixture and it was wonderful. I will try this again but add mozzerella and colby jack cheeses. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Used a lot less butter. Adding pasta water to 1/4in over made the dish way too moist. The cheese stayed separated from the pasta. Will definitely try again using less pasta water, and will grate the cheddar and mix throughout before adding milk mixture.

Made this as stated and had a lot of excess butter. Fiance loved it, but a tad too oily for my taste. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the directions exactly. I did use 1/2 stick of butter, rather than a whole stick. It was still plenty buttery. It looked exactly like the picture.
I wasn't wild about how egg-y this recipe is.  It was quiche textured.  I prefer a creamy/cheesy mac'n cheese, as I usually make, that starts with a roux and contains no eggs.

Made this recipe for a pot-luck party I was hosting.  I doubled the recipe except the butter because of the other reviews saying 1/2 cup was plenty.  Even with that, I dabbed at the top of the casserole with paper towels because it was a little greasy looking.  In any event, as hostess I waited until last to serve myself and found an empty casserole dish!!!  Everyone said it was so good so I will definitely  be making it again for Thanksgiving and make sure I get to eat some myself.

This mac and cheese is delicious.  I used shredded sharp cheese in my dish and next time I'd use less butter... My kids are asking for seconds and thirds!!! Thanks so much for sharing!!
