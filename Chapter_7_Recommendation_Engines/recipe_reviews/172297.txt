Fantastic! Both the French toast and the syrup are delicious, and both could easily stand on their own. Together they are sinfully awesome. You may think the syrup sounds like more trouble than you want to go to, but it really cooks itself while you are making the French toast - and is well worth it. I love the idea of this toast and can see making it with all kinds of fruit fillings. The syrup is just plain excellent. I made this as written, using Merlot for the red wine. Great recipe - thanks! :)

My family made this recipe for me on Mother's Day. They made the orange maple syrup mentioned here and also made the Dutch Honey recipe found on this site. The Toast was very rich and very good. We all preferred the Dutch Honey syrup to the orange maple. It was a great Mother's Day breakfast but we probably won't make it very often as it was quite time consuming, messy, and clean up took a bit longer than normal.

Wow!  This is so good!  I made without the wine or red pepper flakes as I was serving a one year old, but oh my it was delicious.  I made some without the egg dip and just grilled in butter and they were quite delicious too!!  Great recipe! Thanks, Sarah

For the syrup, I used grape juice instead of red wine. For the stuffed french toast, I used reduced fat cream cheese and I added a bit of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla to the egg wash. The kids and husband ate every bite, though they really use the syrup. When I make this again, I'll add a little sugar to the filling and maybe use different syrup.

It's more of a sauce than a syrup, but it's so good! I doubled the portion, as we like to use plenty of sauce. I used the zest of a whole orange and also used 1/3 cup of leftover chestnut syrup in place of some of the maple (I'd previously made chestnut paste and didn't want the unused syrup to go to waste). Next time I will save some of the zest for the filling and add a little sugar to it as well to give it a cheesecake-y taste.

So easy!  I did not use the red wine or the red pepper flakes in the syrup and it still came out great!  I also used cinnamon swirl bread from a local bakery.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this for brunch for my family. The only thing was I didn't make the syrup we just used regular maple syrup.  It was great! I'm sure it would be even better if we had made the orange maple syrup.

This was really a fun recipe. I left out the wine as I was serving this to kids as well as adults, but we really liked the flavor of the 'syrup' (it isn't really a syrup though, it's a thin sauce). Filling was wonderful also. Next time I would add some of the orange zest and a tsp of sugar to the cream cheese before spreading it on the slices of bread. Thanks for sharing the recipe with us!

Quick and easy to make and tasty to eat.  I don't drink wine so I don't know how much if any of a difference that makes but the "syrup" sauce was good and everyone enjoyed this breakfast.  In fact my 12 year old son was disappointed that I only made one "sandwich" for eash person!

I made this recipe because it looked delicious.....and it was! I used thicker french toast bread and whipped cream cheese.  The surup was nothing special to me.  I personally prefer reg. maple surup over this but it was nice to try something new.

I added just a little vanilla extract and cinnamon with the milk and eggs. I used French toast bread. And for the syrup I used the barefoot brand "sweet red" wine. I also added 6 oz.of blueberries. This recipe really was easy and soooo yummy says my whole family! Thank you!

Very good!  My husband does not do cow dairy, so we used soft goat cheese in place of the cream cheese (a little hard to spread but it matches the taste of cream cheese).  The syrup was delicious!

I just made this using cinnamon swirl bread. I did not make the syrup, just used maple syrup. It was very tasty and easy to make.

5/28/18  Really delicious and easy French Toast. Great idea! For 2 people, made this with 4 slices whole wheat raisin bread using whipped cream cheese (which spread very easily) and fresh blueberries pushed into the cream cheese. Beat 3 eggs with 1 tsp vanilla and about 3/4 cup milk, then coated both sides of sandwich with egg mixture. Cooked till golden brown on both sides. I did not make this syrup because we had Wild Huckleberry Syrup already opened and it was great  with this delicious dish but will try this syrup later! Definitely a keeper!

I gave it a 4 because my husband really liked it.  I'm picky and it wasn't for me.  I also felt like it was a little more labor intensive than I like for  a simple meal.  I probably won't make it again, but it was worth a try.

This is very good!  I whipped the cream cheese and put a little milk and cinnamon and sugar in it.  Didn't make the syrup because my husband doesn't like orange anything,  I would definitely make this again!!

Made this for a family cabin camping weekend, and it was a huge hit.  We like our French toast batter a little more flavorful so I added a little vanilla, cinnamon, sugar and a sprinkle of salt.  Used a hearty multi-grain bread.  The syrup is delicious; if you're going to make it ahead of time to reheat later, recommend going light on the pepper flakes or strain them out after the syrup cools, as it will get spicier over time. 
 A delicious foil for the richness and sweetness of the French toast.  As for number of servings, with two large slices of bread and the filling, found that 1/2 portion was plenty filling for many in our family.  Thinking of ways to modify (i.e. using gingered pear slices instead of blueberries).

I just thought it was okay, but my family really loved it. The syrup was liquid-y & I didn't think the wine added anything special. The recipe involved more work than I would've liked.

Made it this morning and it was wonderful. Added a little cinnamon and vanilla to the egg batter, and used sliced sourdough bread. Soooo good!

Made this.  Used low fat cream cheese and sweetened it a bit with powdered sugar.  Used real maple syrup instead of making the orange flavored...will try that next time.  Overall loved it.  Have made various versions of stuffed French toast over the years and this was the easiest!
