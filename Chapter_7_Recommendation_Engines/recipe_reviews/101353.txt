These were great! I was a little wary of the only other ricotta pancake recipe on here, so I did a search and found this one. It sounded fairly foolproof since it starts with Bisquick, and it worked out great. Do NOT expect a fluffy pancake. That isn't what these are. These are more like crepes--very thin and rich. They were exactly what I wanted, thank you for the recipe :)

We also had leftover ricotta cheese - what a nice change!  Kids loved them (we did NOT tell them about the ricotta or they would have freaked out!).  It's a GREAT way to get more PROTEIN into a carb-filled breakfast! (also great with blueberries!).

Flavor was good and I would make them again, I happened to have some left over ricotta and wanted to try these.  I agree with others that the pancake is not fluffy, but a creamy middle and it is a little hard to tell if they are done.  Will have to experiment a little, has great potential.

These were quick, yummy, fluffy & creamy!  I didn't have any trouble telling when they were done...they bubbled up just like normal pancakes.  My kids loved them, too!

Recipe is very easy however I felt it bland. Once I made lemon ricotta pancakes and I wanted that rich flavor again.  I did add lemon peel to this recipe.  I would rather have standard pancakes or use my other ricotta recipe.

Tasty and easy! This came together very quickly, and the pancakes were delicious and filling. Might cut back on the milk next time, my batter was a little too runny for my liking. But all and all, these are great and a good treat that comes together fast

These would have been really tasty, but my Bisquik was old.  The texture of the inside of the pancake is creamy instead of airy like a regular pancake which was very interesting to me.

Delicious and so easy to make using a mix!  A nice alternative to standard pancakes, especially with the added protein of the cheese.

I've made these several times. Soooo good! The ricotta gives the pancakes a slightly creamer texture.

these were great, but I found that they take longer to cook then a regular pancake.  I just made them really thin and they cooked faster that way.  they would make a great roll up pancake.  amazing with a little sugar and lemon juice.  will make this again when I have left over ricotta cheese

I modified this recipe in a few ways:
1.  Added lemon juice and blueberries -- I eyed the amount of both.  I suspect about 2T-1/8C juice & 1/2C berries.
2.  I modified the wet to dry ratio by adding eggs & add'l pancake mix.  My pancake mix uses a 2-1 wet-dry ratio, so this recipe's wet-dry ratio made the pancakes very thin.  So, I added a couple of eggs and add'l batter -- and some milk when the batter was too thick -- until it was the consistency my family likes.

I topped the pancakes with warm maple syrup, and even the picky eaters in my family who said they would never eat a pancake with ricotta cheese in it came back for more.

I made these this morning and loved them.  
I used Hungry Jack Extra Light & Fluffy mix. (BTW I use that for nice light crispy waffles in one of those Belgian waffle makers that flip). 
Really enjoyed the ease of this recipe: no fuss, no muss.  I used 1/2 the recipe with 1 cup milk for the 2 of us.  They kept the hunger at bay longer than regular pancakes due to the protein. 
I definitely recommend you try this easy-peasy recipe.

This made A LOT of pancakes...perfect for my family of 6.  I was skeptical that a pancake recipe with no eggs and only three ingredients would be good, but they were delicious.  The nice thing with these is that they are fluffy but the inside is cooked, unlike with many other pancake recipes I've tried where the middle is still gooey and the outside is done.  I didn't change anything, but maybe next time I would add a little vanilla. I had lots of leftovers, which I'll freeze and then my kids can pop them in the microwave on school mornings.

These came out awesome! The batter was on the lower end of consistency which was good because they came a bit thicker than crepes. They were good as pancakes with Agave syrup! Even better when I made panini brunch sandwiches with some leftover bacon and thin 1/2 egg & 1/2 egg substitute! The recipe made a lot of them... would have been good to offer a yield number and made a half recipe. I hope the rest of them freeze well!!’

I found some old ricotta in the refrigerator and wondered if these pancakes would really taste any different.  I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful the lemon zest and cheese made the box mix taste! I'm a complete convert now!

Excellent and easy. I added two eggs and they were fluffy. Add mix or milk to get consistency. We added chocolate chips or blueberries and kids and adults gobbled down.

Tasted great but only because I added another cup of bisque know. Way too runny otherwise. Great way to use up left over ricotta though and healthier than oil.

Like others, I found this recipe because I had some leftover ricotta.  But I measured out the pancake mix first and then realized I only had one cup of ricotta, so I used the 2.5 cups of pancake mix, 1 cup of ricotta and then added 1 cup of milk and mixed it... realized I needed more milk, so I added another cup and that was enough.  Notice that the recipe says "as needed" on the milk!  Don't add it all, but little by little.  All of that to say that they were good!!  So, I don't know what it would be like with the full 2 cups of ricotta, but I thought that 1 cup was just enough.  Also... you know the consistency you like your pancakes, so keep that in mind and go with it.

So I made, essentially, my own adaptation of three recipes.* this might need to be adapted for your altitude.* preheat griddle to 375/lightly grease. mix 2 1/2 cups pancake mix, 1 1/2 cups milk, 1 cup ricotta, 1 egg, 2TB veg oil, 2 tsp baking powder, 1tsp vanilla, 1-2TB lemon juice. mix, drop and turn. I also took part of the batch and added cinnamon & semi-sweet chocolate chips, sort of like cannoli filling. kid and husband loved, I prefer plain with fruit.  they both  came out dense but fluffy. I think you could  experiment with the amount of ricotta - and I did use whole milk ricotta -as well as the amount of milk. I started with 1 cup, and gradually added to the thickness I thought would work.

I used whole milk ricotta and 2% milk because that's what I had on hand. The batter never cooked through in the middle, very soggy. :(

Delicious! I didn't want to make the full ten servings and I had to make do with the ingredients I had, so I modified with the following: 1 1/4 c krusteaz mix, 1 c milk, and 3/4 c ricotta. Will make again!

What says Easter breakfast more than some special pancakes and these did not disappoint! I did make a few tweaks though. First of all I did not use the "complete" pancake mix.  I used the original which requires for you to add milk, an egg and oil.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of white sugar per cup of mix which made them even better (don't over mix). Here's another tip, let the batter sit for a like 10-15 minutes. My husband had them with chocolate chips and freshly made strawberry jam (1-2 cups fresh strawberries, 1 tbsp sugar, juice of 1/2 lime/lemon and corn starch) and I had them with blueberries (don't forget to flour the blueberries fresh or frozen so they don't bleed into the batter). I added a bit of lime juice and rhine to the batter for the fresh taste and they were so good. It was such an easy recipe and restaurant quality. Enjoy!

Family approved! Found while hunting for ways to use up extra ricotta. Followed the recipe using Hungry Jack + Trader Joes Multigrain Pancake mix because that's what I had. Cooked at a slightly lower temp than regular pancakes and made mini-pancakes (3-4 in diameter). Flavor is crisp on the outside, and a little more creamy/crepe-like in the middle. Plan to make again, but will experiment with less-processed pancake mix options.

OK, modified a bit. Used Trader Joe's pumpkin pancake mix. I used some buttermilk and milk combined. I did add an egg and some pumpkin pie spice to up the flavor a bit. Used half's on the ingredients we only have 3 people in our family.
These burned even at a low heat. These also were hard to flip.
I gave up after the second pancake. I added extra eggs and put it in the oven like a German Pancake. Hopefully it will turn out. I suspect that this might have been better if I had a waffle machine. The flavor of the batter was good.

Tried them for dinner tonight, and they were great! I was short on pancake mix, so subbed in some buckwheat flour. Was a little short on ricotta, but still got a sense for the delicious texture of these! They weren't so fluffy for me, likely because of the buckwheat flour, but still great. Topped with "all natural" table syrup and thawed out some frozen strawberries.... fantastic! My three year old gobbled them up, and so did the rest of us! Oh and served them up with a little side of bacon. thanks for posting!

This recipe was just okay for me.  The pancakes were very thin,and hard to flip.  They were very delicate.  On medium high heat(#4) the bottoms burned, and the top was still very liquidy.  Don't think I'll be making them again.

We tried this recipe as it was written the first time. They were very good. We just made them again with blueberry pancake mix and the zest of one lemon and they were awesome!! We did cut the milk to 1 1/2 cups and placed the cooked pancakes in a 200 degree oven to "finish." I think the next time we will use fresh blueberries and lemon zest, can't wait to try them!

Super yummy! We didn't have milk so I did 1/2 cup half n half and diluted it with water to 2 cups. The texture is slightly more "squishy" than I'm used to, but it's definitely not doughy which I hate. So awesome!

These pancakes didn’t work for us, and that may have been because of the brand of pancake mix we were using.  We found these pancakes to be bland and uneventful. Sorry.

I tried this original recipe but halved it to 5 servings. I used Maple Grove Farms of Vermont pancake mix instead of Bisquick as I am not fond of that product. I used a whisk to mix together everything and it turned into a near perfect batter consistency that poured easily but retained it's circular shape in the cast iron pan. My heat was medium high. The end results were extraordinarily moist fluffy pancakes, light,and slightly spongy as compared to "cakey". Flavor was excellent and I will definitely keep this recipe. So deceptively simple and a definite improvement on the basic pancake.I can't wait to add fresh blueberries!
