I advise a bit more milk than the recipe calls for, but this is too easy and tasty not to add to my repertoire.  Admittedly added garlic powder and dry mustard.  Very good and will make again.

If your mac & cheese attempts suck, TRY THIS ONE.  I have tried so many different mac & cheese recipes, and they have all bombed.  This one might be cheating, but the result had the perfect texture I've been looking for.  The flavor is admittedly bland, but easy to modify.  I added 1c shredded cheese and 1/2 c breadcrumbs.  Next time I'll probably add some ground mustard, more pepper, maybe a little salt, and sharper cheese.

I mixed a cup of cheddar cheese in with the noodles and a cup on top and sprinkled the bread crumbs on top of that (without the butter).  Makes it very cheesy and a favorite with family and friends.

Very good! I did make some changes though. I mixed 1/4 C milk and 1/4 C sour cream with the can of cheddar soup. I added some chopped, cooked bacon and shredded jack cheese to the mix as well. The flavors were perfect. Next time, I will use crushed crackers and butter instead of the bread crumbs for a crisper texture on top.

I am giving this 5 stars mainly because it is an awesome base recipe. I hate it when people rate things on here based on their own changes, but I did do it with this recipe, simply because my husband and I enjoy BOLD flavor and there really are no spices in the recipe (aside from the black pepper). So here goes: I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular which gave the topping an amazing crispness. mixed sharp shredded cheddar cheese, a couple of palm-fulls of grated parmesan and a TBS or so of jarred Hormel Real bacon bits in with the called for ingredients. Spiced it up with a couple dashes of cayenne pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Oh yeah and I used bowtie pasta, which was great! Definitely a good recipe to play around with! Nothing "wrong" with the original recipe, just added my own twist. TRY IT!

This was good, considering what it consisted of. I added some garlic powder & mustard power and used Panko for the topping. I prefer a homemade macaroni and cheese made with a roux and such, but for just boiling some pasta and adding a few ingredients, this was good. Thanks! :)

I added chopped brocolli and thyme and chrushed potato chips.  If the brocolli is fresh, micro for a minute or 2 to precook it.  If using frozen brocolli just add right to the recips when baking it.  Before baking add crushed potato chips as the topping.

An easy, delicious recipe!
I added some shredded mild chedder cheese (mixed in and sprinkled on top). Instead of plain, I used Italian style bread crumbs. I also added pieces of grilled chicken mixed in.
I served it at a potluck dinner party and it went over great - everybody loved it. 
I think next time I will add pieces of stewed tomatoes!
This is really a great dish. What makes it great is that it lends itself to personalization.

Excellent - made two changes 1.  Used Nacho cheese soup because had in the house. 2. Used butter, flour roux with 1 whole can evap milk.  Also, added I cup more macaroni because had more people to feed!  Will use just as is when that is what I have in the cupboard!

It had the creamy texture I was looking for, but it is really quite bland. I followed other reviewers' advice and added extra cheese (mixed into the noodles and on top) and still found it bland. I may try adding some mustard to the cheese/soup mixture next time to give it some kick!

I make this all the time for my husband and my son and they LOVE it!!!  This Thanksgiving I doubled all the ingredients and added more of the bread crumb (panko) and butter mixture to the top to make it extra crunchy. It was a hit with the entire family.   Even the more traditional cooks gave it rave reviews.   It is definitely becoming a staple in my house.

This recipe is very bland and does not have very much flavor!  I had cooked tacos the same night with ground beef & chorizo, after mixing a little of the meat in with the mac n cheese it was then good.  I HIGHLY recommend adding alot of seasoning and cheese for more flavor unless you like very bland food.

Very easy! I can whip it up when I get home from work in time for when my husband gets home from work! We thought it needed more flavor the first time too, try mixing in a few table spoons of mustard to the cheese sauce! It adds just enough zest! Also, sprinkling cheese on top makes it just perfect.

I added a cup of milk, half a block of cream cheese and another cup of shredded cheeses. Heated them all together with cheddar soup. Added a dash of worcestershire, and onion salt and pepper to taste. Absolutely yummy this way.

Good quick meal. I used crumbled Ritz crackers for the topping. My husband wants me to make it again. I think I'll add a little garlic powder next time.

This recipe has become a tradition at duck camp every year. We mix it up adding smoked ham chunks or grilled marinated duck breasts. 
Awesome just with some frozen broccoli stirred in too. Try adding shredded white cheddar to the top prior to bread crumb mixture. Thumbs up!!! Then again, fire fighters will eat rubber boots if ya add gravy!! Lol

A great, classic side that's easy enough to make on a weeknight.  The cheese flavor was a little flat and bland; I plan to add some sharp cheddar to this recipe to give it a kick.

I used this recipe as a base to make a mac and cheese dish. I used whole milk instead of canned milk. I also added two heaping tablespoons of french onion sour cream dip, 1/4 teaspoon of dried mustard (probably needed more though) and a pinch of cayenne pepper (not to make it hot, just to give it a little bit more flavor). Before I put it in the oven, I mixed in 8 oz of shredded New York Sharp Cheddar and put 8 oz of the same cheese on the top.  After those changes, I can say I liked it.

I read all of the reviews prior to trying this and have to say I do think it would have been very bland without some additions. I heated the soup and milk (a little more milk as some suggested)and then melted in about 1/2 cup of Imperial cheese and some diced onions I had sauteed in butter. I also added a tsp of mustard and a little garlic powder. After I stirred the macaroni into the cheese mixture, I also mixed in some cubes of mozzarella. I also added some grape tomatoes because I love tomatoes in my mac and cheese! This was the creamiest mac and cheese I have every made and was excellent with the additions. Oddly, I am not usually one to make so many additions to a posted recipe but I believe this one benefits from this. Thanks for posting this!

I bought some Campbell's condensed cheddar cheese soup because it was on sale. When I got home I realized it would be boring by itself! I found this recipe and decided to change it a little bit. I added approximately 1/8 a teaspoon of garlic salt,  and almost a whole bag of frozen chopped broccoli. I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain ones. Even with theaw additions, this recipe was bland. We ended up adding more spice to it as we ate. While this recipe wasn't bad, I won't be making it again.
