This was a wonderful accompanyment to shrimp and scallops on the grill.  My hard-to please mom absolutely loved it.  Followed the recipe to a "T" and would not change a thing.  Thanks for a great side dish, Zita!

Excellent, tasty, colorful rice dish!  Rather than using long grain rice, I used par-broiled rice, which required extra chicken broth and orange juice - based on the amounts suggested for this recipe - to ensure it was properly cooked.  Rather than using a white onion for this recipe, I will use green onions instead.  I didn't have mandarin oranges and the orange flavor was still very good.  I will definitely make this rice dish again.

Good mixture.  I served it with the easter dinner (ham, sweet potatoes, etc.).  Loved by all 11 people around the table.

Now I know how to make it!  Thanks!  Note to others:  be sure to mix in the oranges at the last minute before serving, if you stir them in they disintegrate.

Excellent!  A nice change from plain ole' white rice. This is a subtle blend of a "sweet" orange rice. It is flavored nicely with orange, but it is not overpowering. This is one dish that I believe anyone would enjoy who wants to try a different flavored "rice" side dish. The addition of bell peppers makes for a another layer of flavors and a very pretty side dish. To the red and green bell peppers, I added yellow as well for color and texture. I added a couple of mandarin oranges to the rice towards the tail end of cooking. In each mouthful of fluffy rice I had slight crunched of bell peppers and sweet mandarin oranges. I also added more mandarin orange segments before serving this dish as well. This side dish stood out with its pretty red, yellow and green bell peppers, chopped red onions and mandarin oranges. I served this along with, "Amber's Sesame Chicken," and "Almond Broccoli Stir-fry," all from this website.

This was a very nice side dish to eat with pork, and I would use it with chicken or fish as well. The oranges were a nice colourful addition and even my son liked this.

This was a very nice and refreshing side dish.  The only thing I did differently was to use all red bell pepper, and omitted the green.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Zita!

This was very very good. We had this with a sweet and tangy chicken recipe that we found on this site but we altered it to our own taste. I would highly recomend this to anyone who likes rice.

Wonderful change from our usual rice.  Omitted the canned mandarin oranges and used fresh squeezed mandarin orange juice (these oranges are in season here at the moment).  It tastes fresh and light - have already made the recipe a couple of times.

Other than using short grain brown rice which is the only rice I have, I stuck closely to the recipe and it is great! The colors are pretty and the OJ and mandarin oranges added a nice touch of sweetness to it. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was amazing!  I paired this with the recipe for "Waikiki Meatballs" from this site. The meatballs have a sweet 'n sour sauce and it made for the perfect combination.

This recipe was enjoyed by all of us. Will make it again! I did not add the mandarin oranges, and used brown rice. The citrus was subtle and just right; I imagine adding the oranges would up the level of flavor from where I had it. The peppers added another layer of flavor that matched perfectly!

A good, quick, and flavorful rice dish.  My whole family enjoyed this and I would make it again.  I browned my veggies in the olive oil and used more salt and pepper than called for.  It turned out wonderful:)

I liked this...the red pepper and orange flavors complemented each other very well.  I used brown rice and all red pepper, and juiced oranges and pared and chopped a fresh orange rather than using canned.  Oh, I went very light with the onion, that's just my personal taste.  Lovely, slightly sweet, light dish.  Would pair nicely with anything spicy.

This was very good! I added a bit of garlic with the veggies while they were cooking, and a tad more salt (which was not necessary). I also used brown rice, which was very good. Simple recipe, great with chicken

I've tried making this recipe twice. It was ok, but just not what I'm looking for. I want something with a little more punch. It has also turned out sticky both times I made it. I think it has great potential though w/ cosiderable tweakng.

I followed the recipe exactly. It wasn't bad, but it didn't knock my socks off. I was hoping my toddlers would go for it, but no such luck. I might make it as a side in the future, but it's not at the top of my list.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It was different from anything else I have ever made and had more flavor than I thought it would.  The mandarin oranges really helped.

This dish was good....  Not "oh my god - good" but, good.  I made it for a Hawaiin theme party I went to.  Noone raved about it....but, that could be because everyone was already pretty liquored up.  Would I make this again?  I doubt it.  Don't get me wrong, it was good...maybe for a family dinner...but not for a party.

Good recipe.  I made this with cerviche mahi mahi and broccoli with lemon almond butter and it made for a great meal.  The mahi mahi recipe is off of foodnetwork.com.  I did not have the oranges for this recipe, but otherwise it tasted great.
