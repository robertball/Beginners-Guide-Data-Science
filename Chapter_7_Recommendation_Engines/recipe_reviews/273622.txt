Very tasty. I used half of the red pepper flakes called for - and will use even less next time. I also used spiralized zucchini instead of pasta. Will do this one again!

I thought this was very tasty. My daughter described it as having spice, but not too spicy. I followed other users advice and only did 1 Tablespoon of red pepper flakes. I think next time I would use 2 Tablespoons as called for, as I did add one extra teaspoon after adding the shrimp back in at the end. Also, I had some leftover white wine I wanted to use up, which is why I was making this, but then didn't have any fresh tomatoes. I used two cans of diced tomatoes in place of fresh (one that I blended) and it still tasted great. I bet it would be amazing with garden fresh tomatoes! I also used 1 drop of lemon essential oil along with the Tbsp of lemon juice, and 1 drop of basil essential oil in place of the second Tbsp of dried basil.  Would make again. Served with crusty bread. Good enough for company if they like some spice!

If you love spicy food you will love this dish.  If you don’t like too spicy food cut the red peppers in half.   I used organic tomato’s, fresh basil and Parcely from my garden.   The flavor is incredible.   Awesome dish!!!

I rarely do a review, but I must for this recipe. First, I apologise to the purists, I did make a couple of changes. This rocks! Fabulous taste, easy to make and yummy. I used tomato paste with a little extra wine to thin it instead of pureeing the plum tomatoes (didn't have any). All the rest was the same. But I zoodled a large zucchini and mixed it into the sauce when I put the shrimp back in. A fabulous tasty complete meal!

I cut the crushed red pepper in half but it was still very spicy. Tasty dish but I think some people would have found it overbearing with the full 2 TBS of crushed red.

Very good!  Only used one tbsp of red pepper flakes instead of two, just to be sure I wasn't  over-doing the heat.  Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe- will definitely make again!!

I used 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes, that was enough heat for me. It was very flavorful and will definitely make again.

If you like spicy, this is it!  This dish is almost identical to a generation's old fra Diavolo recipe in my family, though we like ours made with fettuccini.

This recipe is a good base. As someone in another review stated... Needed garlic. And more salt. I added more of both to our own liking levels.

2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes is overkill. Unless you wanna burn your face off. I used 1 and it was plenty enough heat. 

At the end, (when you add the shrimp back to the pot).... I added two teaspoons of fresh lemon zest. And my oh my... It sure perked and brightened this dish right up! Just make sure you don't get any of the white rind from your lemons or you'll get a bitterness. 

My end result was a sauce that was a bit loose and watery. But had really good flavor. I'd make it again and likely tweak it in other ways just to play with it.

Served it over bucatini noodles. Topped with fresh basil.
