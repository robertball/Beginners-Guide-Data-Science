Other than cutting the recipe in half to serve 3, I followed the recipe to a "T". The flavor was very bland, and it definitely needed tweaking to eat, especially needing salt! I added a bit of powdered chicken bouillon, some cayenne pepper and a bit of coconut milk. We served this over Jasmine rice. We ate it, but it's not something that I'd make again. Sorry!

The recipe doesn't call for salt or pepper.  I added some after it was cooked and I like it better with the salt and pepper. The rest of the favors came through quiet well.

After following the recipe I found it to be bland. I added more curry and salt and pepper. I added too much curry, so I mixed in some lentils. The final product was delicious.

Different take on cooked veggies.  I like it.
