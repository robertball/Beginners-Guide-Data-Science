I made this recipe as written and it was okay, but did not turn out as I had hoped.  The consistency was quite sticky and I felt there was too much sugar mixture and not enough peaches.  It was nice to be able to prep dessert head of time and get everything cleaned up while it cooked, but overall I prefer other cobbler recipes that are baked in the oven.

To piggy back off the other review I kept all ingredients the same but the peaches. I used 8 peaches instead and it turned out perfectly. It was a huge hit at our 4th of July party.

Add a cup of milk and half a cup of melted butter
2 15 oz cans of peaches in heavy syrup can be substituted for the peaches, with the syrup in it.

I searched several recipes first. To avoid the sticky mess, put paper towels in the lid to catch condensation. I like this recipe best. I especially appreciate that it mentions the crock size. That is very important!

this recipe isn't very good compared to other slow cooker recipes. it needs milk or something to bring it together. it's basically just a sticky mess rather than a cobbler. it didn't taste bad, though.

I made this using another posters suggestion of using more peaches. I like mine a touch more sweet so I am increased both white and brown sugar by a bit. Love this t. This is third time I have made it
