Excellent.  Just that simple. I used fresh tomatoes (skinned and seeded) and homemade chicken broth made from a rotisserie chicken carcass.  Along with the celery, onion and carrots I added the ribs, sliced, from the Swiss chard.  Wish there were leftovers.

A perfect soup for any time of year! I picked up some chard at the farmers market and wanted to find a healthy dish to make with it. I came across this recipe and loved it for a nice light summer dinner! I didn't measure; just chopped and cooked. Following the great tip from Naples, I added the diced chard stems with the mirepoix...no need to be wasteful! I didn't add the full 2# of chicken, because I didn't want to :) and I subbed a 15oz can of diced tomatoes for the crushed, as it's what I had on hand and wouldn't want to open a can for just a cup anyways. I used farfalle because I didn't want to buy pasta just for this. A lovely recipe that has great flavor! I served with fresh fruit and a garlic-herb bread. Happy, satisfied bellies! (Until my boyfriend jokingly asks "what's for dinner?" when he's hungry again in an hour or so.) :)

Loved the flavors in this soup. I did add chicken base to this recipe to up the flavor.  I also boiled my pasta separately and added it at the end so that it wouldn't soak up all my soup liquid while it cooked. The whole family really enjoyed this and it will be a regular for us.

I used leftover rotissere chicken so it was even quicker and easier.  Sauteed a clove of garlic with the onion, celery, and carrots, and used baby spinach as the greens. My little kids loved that I used tiny pasta stars, and they gobbled it up and asked for more!  Served it with a green salad and garlic bread... delicious!  Thanks for posting.

Absolutely delicious!  An easy recipe that I did not change one bit.  I did need to add more broth after the soup sat for awhile as the pasta sucks up alot of the broth.  After the first time, I cooked the pasta before adding to the soup.  My family loved it!

This soup is a regular in my home.  I prepared this dish with frozen mustard green, because that's what I had on hand and it was great.  If you choose a frozen green remember to drain very well.

Have been making this soup for years now.  I cut back on the amount of acini de pepe a bit so it's not so thick.  It's wonderful and full of bright flavors.  It's a staple for me in the winter.

This soup is delicious.  Actually restaurant quality.  I followed recipe closely, but used frozen chopped spinach for the greens. My family loves to eat soup so this will be a new one in our rotation.

Delicious!  I used my own turkey broth and added more of each veggie called for and a little more broth to stretch the quantity a bit.  Saving this one for sure!
p.s.
I blended some of the soup to feed to my 10-month old.  It was delicious that way also - kinda creamy.

Indeed, tasty! I accidentally let the soup boil too hard during the simmering stage, so it got a bit thick; I added some more water and all was well.

I realized just now that I forgot to add greens! How stupid! That would've been so tasty. I bought them and everything, just never added them. Too late now, I suppose. -_-;;

Even without them, a yummy soup! It makes a ton and is REALLY filling. Will make again.

My family (kids included) really enjoyed this one.  I typically use homemade chicken stock and spinach.  I also cook and keep the pasta separate, otherwise it eats up all the broth.

This is an awesome recipe.  Tastes great and looks beautiful.  I made as written.  Could easily adapt with rotisserie chicken.

Delicious, I used Orzo #65 for the pasta & used only spinach (had a bunch). Not a difficult recipe, will do again. Thanks!

I thought this soup was easy and delicious. I added a little more broth because it was pretty thick. Still would have been great without it!
