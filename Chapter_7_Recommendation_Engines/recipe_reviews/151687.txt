I just made this for dinner and it was delicious! I typically shy away from recipes with condensed soup in them because I don't like the richness/saltiness that it usually gives, but the sauce this recipe makes is so good, you can't even tell condensed soup was used. The only suggestion I have is to use two cans instead of one. One can just didn't seem to make quite enough sauce, but two would be perfect.

Delicious recipe and so easy!  I didn't have milk but sumstituted with water and butter and the recipe was great.  The one recommendation I would make is to increase the cream of mushroom soup to two cans.  I used three pork chops and 2.5 cups of rice with one can of cream of mushroom soup and it was just right for my fiance and me.  Therefore, with 4 cups of rice it may not be saucy enough.  I seasoned the porkshops and added thinly slice onions to the garlic and pork chops.  These were a great add if you like onions.

My only change was the addition of 8oz of sauteed fresh mushrooms.  I always use 98% fat free COM soup, and it worked well in this recipe too.  Great over brown rice.

I thought this was five stars with some alterations I made from other reviewers suggestions. I used 6 boneless pork chops, 2 cans of garlic mushroom soup, I used 3 large cloves of garlic, seasoned the chops with garlic powder and black pepper and added an 8 oz can of sliced mushroom and a big handful of fresh chives to the sauce.  It was super yummy with rice and green beans. Lots of gravy, flavorful and tender.

Very good taste and simple dish to prepare.  The kids loved it, I did add a dash more garlic than the original recipe called for.

Delicious recipe--I used more garlic than called for, and put it over mashed potatoes. Plus, you can't beat something that's cooked in one dish!

The pork chops were moist, but I thought they were a little too salty and a little bland (even with using the fat free / reduced sodium soup).  My kids and husband didn't really like them either.  We won't be making this dish again.

This recipe is just ok.  Nothing to shout about.  It seems like someone started something, then forgot all about the spices.  I couldn't even taste the garlic, and I added two cloves of garlic instead of one.  This is a good start, but needs way more flavor.

It was wonderful! It's a keeper. I made this one night for my fiance and myself because we were bored with baked porkchops. I added a small can of mushrooms to the sauce, and added about 1/2 cup chopped onion while browning the chops. The gravy can be made by itself for mashed potatoes.

So easy and so good. The second time I made this, I cut up half of a small onion and saut√©ed it in the oil before I added my chops and garlic. I think when I make it again, I'll do the chops and onion at the same time, and then either add the garlic for a minute or two before I remove the chops or just add the garlic after the soup and milk. My garlic just kept getting done too fast.

Not bad! I only gave it 4 stars because of my wrongdoing. I used way too much garlic. I used about 4 or 5 garlic cloves instead of the 1 that the recipe calls for. For garlic lovers it might not have been so bad but for me it was overpowering. Other than that pretty good! The only other change I made was seasoning my pork chops with garlic pepper seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder. Also I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of garlic mushroom soup(again more garlic!) My pork chops were extra thick so it took longer than 25 minutes to cook. I served with rice and asparagus. Yum! Next time I'll be sure to use less garlic.

for a quick meal it is pretty tasty.Only thing i did differently was add some diced red pepper and more milk in the canned soup and let it simmer with the meat. I sliced my thick pork chops into not too thick strips and served with some couscous.Husband loved it.

My husband was able to throw these together by him self and in a hurry. We double the sauce but otherwise left it the same and it was good. Took some to work with me and got numerous comments on how good it smelled. Nice pork chop recipe.

Served over sticky rice with asparagus on the side. Used 2 cups of mushroom soup as other reviewers suggested and some cajun spice with the garlic. Turned out  quite well.

A good basic recipe. We added another clove of garlic. This won't be an every week meal, but will be added to the lineup.

Excellent dish!  My boyfriend made this for me last night and it was great.  He followed the recipe as stated, but did use another members suggestion to put the pork chops over mashed potatoes.  We like to make smashed potatoes (skin on the potatoes), so we put the pork chops over smashed potatoes.  Very simple and delicious recipe...thanks!

Very, very nice. If you like garlic....I minced 4 or 5 garlic buds and sauteed them up with the chops. Used cream of mushroom with onion. After pulling the chops out, I used a spatula to get everything off the skillet bottom, (read: sauteed garlic). Mixed it all together, (soup, milk, pan 'drippings'). Sauce was to die for.

This is a meal I made often for my children when they were little. So that being said, it is kid friendly. I seasoned the pork chops with cajun spice before frying. I also bumped up the garlic to 4 cloves. I sauteed it in butter with 8 oz. of fresh sliced mushrooms and then proceeded to cook as directed. Served over buttered egg noodles. Nothing outstanding, just good quick food.

I don't make a lot of recipes with Cream of something soups just because of the sodium, etc., but I needed something quick and easy for dinner a couple of nights ago. These pork chops were perfect and fit that bill. To make it even easier I put the pork chops along with the soup, garlic and milk into a slow cooker for eight hours on low. Worked out perfectly! In fact, it was pretty much no work for me at all, which means that I will be making these again. My husband rally liked them and my three year old ate it pretty well after a little bit of coaxing. Thank you for this great recipe!

Easy and delicious. Good advice from other reviewers to: (1) use 2 cans instead of one (2) use more garlic (3) add fresh mushrooms. We loved it and will definitely make it again. Thanks!

I thought these were pretty tasty. The kids even loved them. I love the fact that it is a super quick and easy recipe too. The only change I made was I used darlic powder instead, and I added a little onion powder also. I will be making these again! Yum!

Very yummy!  The sauce was surprisingly good, thanks to the remnants in the pan from cooking the chops.  Mine were a bit dry, however.  Next time I will cook them a little less.  I also added sauteed mushrooms which were a good addition.

Definitely tasty but I think I messed up and used too much milk. The sauce was a little bland. I took the advice of others and used the mushroom soup w/ roasted garlic and seasoned the chops. Also used thin cut pork chops and served over a brown rice/wild rice medley. Will definitely try again and measure the milk more carefully. :)

I made this tonight's dinner and found it was very good!  I agree with the other reviews, it definitely needs double the soup!  It turned out that my garlic was dried out, so, I dusted the chops with garlic powder before browning and I also added some diced up onions.  I would definitely make this again.  This is one of those recipes that is versatile and can be altered to suit one's own taste!!!  Even the kids cleaned it up!

This a quick and esay recipe to use. I had to use Cream of Celery soup because I didn't have cream of mushroom on hand. I also used a little more garlic because our family loves garlic. It was perfect. Plan on using again when I have cream of mushroom.

Pretty good I added onion and more garlic like suggested. I also put in a few dashes of chili powder to spice up the savory a little (used low sodium COM soup so it wasn't too salty). + brown rice and green beans to make a good meal.

This was amazing. I did substitute the mushroom soup for cheddar broccoli soup instead and added a side of cheddar broccoli pasta.

I seasoned the pork chops with Lawry's and added paprika to the sauce.  My kids and I liked it.

I made this for my husband and I last night.  Very simple to make.  I seasoned the chops well with s&p, garlic powder & a dash of cayenne.  It was delicious over mashed potatoes. Makes really good gravy.  My husband loved it!  If I had not seasoned it well, I feel it would have been very bland.  Will make again.

I read the reviews prior to making for suggestions.  Adding butter to the soup was a great idea. The soup had a smooth rich taste.  This was a huge hit for my family. We will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe in the middle of the afternoon and put it in the oven on warm (covered with foil)so my family could eat it while I was gone. It made the pork fork-tender. Delicious. I also add sliced mushrooms to the recipe.
