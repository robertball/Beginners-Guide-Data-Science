First of all if you donot have a vitamix do NOT try this recipe - you will burn your motor up trying to use a regular blender. That said, I followed the recipe and think the coconut cream amount is off. I used my vitamix on high speed 10 and the 2 Tbsp coconut cream was not enough. I easily added 1/3 cup coconut cream. Delicious dessert, but only served one...maybe I was greedy.

This is wonderful! It has a strong chocolate-y taste if you follow the recipe which is very rich and lovely. However, I put a banana in mine to add to the body and provide a complementary flavor.
