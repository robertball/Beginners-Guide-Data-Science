I only made one substitution--I used 1/4 cup ground oatmeal instead of soy flour only because I did not have soy flour on hand. I did not use the oil to cook the pancakes in because I used my nonstick tabletop griddle. These pancakes cooked up flat but the flavor was fantastic. I served them with a homemade maple-vanilla pancake syrup. Both kids asked me to make these again tomorrow--they ate every single one of these. I think these would be just right with a touch more baking soda. NOTE: I got SIX medium sized pancakes from one recipe.

There is another buttermilk pancake recipe that is similar and I make the buttermilk myself since I buy raw milk all the time .  I modified the batter by adding buckwheat flour . I used 3 good size overripe bananas. Added vanilla, used 2 eggs .I covered the pan while cooking. They came out fluffy and moist.

I thought these were really delicious pancakes. I made them with the soy flour. I don't like overly sweet pancakes since syrup goes on top anyway, so I cut the brown sugar in half; that was perfect.  I upped the baking powder to 3/4 tsp; they were not flat at all. I used one whole egg instead of two whites.  My only issue was that they did have a tendency to brown quickly and looked like they would burn. I cooked them on med low heat. Even the ones that looked overcooked, tasted great. I'd really like to make these again!

I had no soy flour so just increased white flour.  Turned out great.

I absolutely love these. I substituted the soy flour for all purpose, and the eggs for flax seed/water mixture, plus almond milk instead of dairy. Basically I made them vegan. I also kept the brown sugar as is and added about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and they were so amazing I didn’t need any syrup! Now that’s a first for me! This is now my go to recipe for banana pancakes for life!

My family liked these pancakes.  I doubled the recipe and got about 16 cakes from 1/4cup batter per cake.  I did not double the amount of sugar, I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat pastry flour (no soy flour) and added dash of fresh ground nutmeg.  I also used two whole eggs instead of egg whites.  Be careful, because of all the brown sugar and natural sugar from the bananas, these have a tendency to brown very quickly.
