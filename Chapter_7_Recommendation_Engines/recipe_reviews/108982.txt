I made the sauce to go with pasta.  I made some changes.  I added garlic with the onion. I used half and half cream instead of heavy cream.  i scaled back the amount of cream and milk a bit. And i garnished with parm cheese, parlsey, and a wedge of lemon.  SOOOOOOOO GOOD!

Last year, I went to England and stopped at a pub in LaCock for lunch. I had chicken with lemon sauce and it was delicious. This recipe is fabulous and the closest match that I could find to the pub's chicken.The only issue that I had was that the cream sauce was a bit lemony and a little bitter from the wine. To balance that, all I did was add some garlic powder and a little salt to the lemon sauce and it turned out excellent!! It is now in my recipe box!

I thought this was excellent! I scaled it down to 2 people. Instead of baking the chicken in the oven I browned it in a skillet with olive oil for about 10 min to save time, then I removed the chicken from the skillet and made the sauce. I made it as described but substituted  olive oil for the butter since thats what I used in the skillet. I didn't think the milk was necessary as it already had heavy cream. Make sure not to let the sauce cook for long cause it will reduce quickly. I also added some capers to the sauce which gave it a gourmet look. My boyfriend raved. Thanks for sharing!

Added 3 cloves of minced garlic with the onions and a little salt (about 1/2 tsp.)and about 1/4 cup of parm. cheese at the end of the sauce cooking.  I did not have lemon pepper for the chicken, so I used poultry seasoning instead and cut the breast in chunks (and I let it marinade with the rest of the ingredients for less than an hour) and cooked the chicken in a non-stick pan on the stovetop.  This adds color to the chicken!!   Tossed the sauce in some cooked whole wheat spaghetti, and tossed in some fresh steamed spinach and topped it with the chicken breast and sprinkle some fresh parm. cheese and parsley, served with a garlic toast......better than if I had ordered it at a restaurant!!

I made this for my husband and we both thought it was absolutely delicious! He loved it so much that he was happy there was extra to take to work for lunch. I did not have Lemon Pepper seasoning so I just used Pepper. I also used a sweeter white wine as well as a sweet yellow onion and I thought the flavor was very balanced! I will definitely be making this again and think I may try the sauce over Tilapia next. Thanks for the great recipe Chelsey!

Decent, easy, but lacking in the flavor department. Also, extremely unhealthy but... you can just use less sauce and then it's not quite as bad! It just tasted like bitter lemon... no depth of flavor. I made it exactly as written. I will not make this recipe again.

This was amazing without lemon pepper (didn't have) or Italian Seasoning (cutting down on sodium), but I used Mrs. Dash instead.  Simply wonderful!  Thank you!

This recipe was super easy and delicious! I only tweaked it a little by adding the garlic and parmesean cheese to the sauce prior to pouring it over the chicken. My husband raved about how much he loved this meal! I served it over fettucine pasta with a bit of parsley and sliced french bread. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! Will definitely make again!!

Very good, made the dish exactly as written.  Almost too much sauce - and a little too peppery for me - but overall - very good. Easy to prepare, let marinate, and when ready for dinner - make sauce (quick), put in oven, prepare other items, and dinner is ready!  Love it - thanks Chelsey

Replaced onion with garlic. Added fresh basil and oregeno. Should have left things as-is after adding heavy cream. Adding milk -diluted the sauce and had to add more flour - diluting the flavor. I prefer grilled chicken to baked. Next time will grill chicken - stew the sauce for longer on the stove top and then shorten the time in the oven. Also added parmesan cheese - served over bow-tie pasta. Definitely a recipe I enjoyed - first time cooking a cream sauce and was very proud of myself! Try this recipe. It's yummy and easy - with a few modifications based on personal preference. Based on  4 servings.

This was tasty and easy to make. I actually used it with pork chops instead of chicken. The family loved it.

I added a clove of garlic like some reviewers suggested. I liked the lemoniness and the creaminess of thsi dish but it seemed to be missing a lyer of taste to complete it for me. Fiancé thought it was too lemony. Think it's a good dish but for me it just needs something else to complete it.

Good...made a few changes. I didn't have milk so just used heavy cream (added an extra 1/2 cup). After marinating the chicken I grilled it instead of baking just b/c we like a little color on the chicken and added garlic to the sauce (I've just got to include garlic in most things I cook). Next time I may cut down on the lemon flavor a bit.

I made this as the recipe directs except for the heavy cream which I rarely have in the house.  I used a milk and butter combination instead.  I served it with rice and broccoli.  It was good but not great.  To my surprise reheated as a casserole the next evening it was fabulous!  All the flavors were just popping.  I will make this again rethinking when I am actually going to serve it.

Great recipe, we loved it but I did make a couple of additions. Used thin sliced chicken breasts and added capers and artichokes  hearts before serving.

I made this with chicken and it turned out well enough that I also made it with Swai. It had a great tase with both . I did have to adjust the amount of lemon to our tase for the fish but it is a recipe worth keeping. Thanks for several great meals.

I did not make the chicken but did make the sauce that went with it.  I used half and half vs. heavy cream, sauteed green onions and mushrooms together,  and added one teaspoon of granulated chicken bouillon. Otherwise, it was rather tasteless. I also used cornstarch vs. flour to thicken the sauce. It turned out great!!

I didn't have lemon pepper so I just skipped it and used the juice of only one lemon assuming that two would be too much. Added capers and olives. Absolutely delicious ! I will make it again for sure.

loved the base of this recipe. we substituted the milk for chicken stock to make it a little less rich, added garlic along with the onion, and added basil, oregano, cayenne, red pepper flakes, and salt & pepper for flavor. instead of baking it we just served it over chicken breast seared in a pan. along with a green vegetable and a neutral side like mashed potatoes, this was amazing!

I really like the sauce on this recipe. I find it flavorful. I will serve the leftover sauce on pasta and dip bread into it too. If you want a little lighter dish defiantly go with a side salad. Ceaser dressing pairs well with this.

Great recipe,  easy to follow. I made a few changes. I added paprika, sliced garlic  and a little maple syrup.  It is heavenly.......lemony, slightly sweet and tangy.

It was delicious. The sauce was a little bland so I added a TBSP of lemon pepper seasoning.  This is definitely something I will be making again. My family loved it. Next time I'll make with as a sauce for fettuccine!!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

This just wasn't good - it lacked flavor, and the flavor it did have was unpleasantly overpowered by lemon.  It needs so much more.  I'm not a good enough cook to know what it needs, but I do know that it surely needs something!  Will not make again.  My son took one bite and said "oooh, not good Mommy."

I made a few changes:  Instead of the Italian seasoning, I used Italian dressing with the marinade ingredients.  I didn't have heavy cream or milk; so, I used sour cream and canned evaporated milk.  I also added 5 cloves of minced garlic and extra lemon juice, about 1 cup. Once the cream  sauce was made, I added garlic salt to enhance the flavor.  

I think this recipe was too bland for me.  Next time, I will use the heavy cream with the changes I made, along with capers, more onions, and artichokes.  Although I rated this dish as a three, my children liked it more than I did. I plan to keep the leftover sauce because food flavors seem to taste better after a day or two.
