LOVE this! I added some caraway seeds, and baked instead of fried. Only used 2 zucchini. It was easy to form. No problem, not too wet or dry. Absolutely perfect and will make them a thousand more times. Thanks for sharing!!!!!!!!

Nice flavour, just a bit on the soft side, added some extra breadcrumbs. Put them in the oven for 5 minutes to crisp up a little, seved on pita with tatziki, lettuce, cucumber and tomato. Finished with a squeeze of lemon. Very nice, worth making again and experimenting with a little.

Holy moly these are AWESOME.  This will definitely become a family tradition.  I recommend one small change-dredge the fritters in panko bread crumbs instead of flour.  Serve fritters with tzatiki sauce and you will be dining with Zeus.

These were a big hit! The only changes I made was that I baked instead of fried and left out the bread crumbs and instead used a few tablespoons of whole wheat flour to keep them together.

I have a personal recipe for zucchini patties and a favorite one from this site. I thought I would try this one for something a little different. Taste wise I would give them at least a 4. However, they are very GREASY! Plus, they are not only time-consuming to make, but very messy! The patties did not want to hold together at all. I am going to blaim that on the zucchini I had. I had to squeeze a lot of water out of it, which I had never had to do before. The other recipes use 1-2 Tblsp or butter or oil. The patties hold together on their own. I found the dipping the patty in flour before cooking a little tedious. The flour mixture or more eggs should have went into the bowl to hold them together. I got one good batch, but I may not even try making the rest as they are a pain. Unless, I can figure some way to thicken the batter, which I may finally do. Hopefully, I will also be able to use less oil than also.

When I put zucchini in a recipe I always squeeze the moisture out thoroughly with a towel.  It dries it out and makes it easier to work with

We LOVED these! I do agree w/ the other reviewer that they were a bit soft to work with  (and I only used 1 zucchini), but other than that they were great! These had wonderful flavor and texture and I really enjoyed the added potato. I also added in a bit of garlic powder to the mix as well just because. Will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were really tasty. I added an extra 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs because the mixture was too wet. And I fried them for at least 15 minutes on each side. They were still pretty flimsy. Next time I'll try to bake them and see if more moisture cooks out. I served them with homemade hummus and the flavor was amazing! Will definitely make these again.

Loved these! We left out the mint and added some garlic. Put the mixture in the fridge for about an hour to stiffen up a little then just dropped by spoonfuls into the pan.

Based on other reviews, I added an extra egg to help the fritters stay together,  switched out mint for dill and put them in a 400 degree oven for 5-6 minutes after they were fried.  I also cooked the onion in olive oil until soft before adding to the of the ingredients.  They were delicious!!!!  Served them with tzaziki sauce and they were a hit.  Iâ€™ll be making them again!

I made these with yellow summer squash, which I drained before using.  The flavor was good. I'll use more mint if I make them again.  But they were super wet. The was no way I could have made them into a patty and then dredge them in flour, even after I added as much bread crumbs as I was comfortable with without dulling down the flavor. I ended up dropping them by spoonfuls into the hot pan, and they were difficult to turn without destroying. They were very well received by the family, though, and tau with a yogurt mint sauce.

Replaced mint with oregano and onions for the green part of scallions and used gluten free flour and bread crumbs for a fab low-FODMAP dish!

Delicious and easy. Using leftover mashed potatoes was  a good idea- instead of cooking and chopping 1 potato. I had only about 5 oz of feta, but it seemed to be enough. The mint flavor was not that noticiable. Dill might be interesting or more mint.
Great entree for vegetarian while serving as a side dish for everyone else.
I made it on an electric griddle, but it was hard to clean afterwards.

Was a little skeptical when reading the ingredients ... how big is a standard zucchini?  But, with a few adjustments, this was amazing.
I shredded, salted and drained the zucchini and squeezed out the extra liquid.  Also added fresh parsley, oregano and garlic for added flavour.   (we love to get creative with herbs).
The mixture was a little too gooey, so added some extra flour and breadcrumbs to it.  Rolled it into balls, dredged them in flour and then flattened them with the spatula after putting them into the hot oil.
So delicious!

We love these fritters.  I used cheese cloth and squeezed a lot of liquid out of the zucchini, it will depend on your zucchini but I would squeeze any One I used.  I had to add a bit more bread crumbs until it was the correct consistency.  I think green onions would be better in this.  I used mint, and not as much and a little garlic, no dill because I put it in my taziki sauce already.

It won't let me write anything without putting in stars which stinks because I'm not comfortable rating this without making it the right way because I was missing ingredients. Seems like a good base recipe. Baked at 400 for 10 minutes or so.

Good flavor, but these didn't hold together at all--and I used less zucchini and potato than the recipe called for. I didn't bother dredging them in the flour because they fell apart each time I tried. I ended up putting about half the flour into the batter, and they still didn't hold together (and I didn't like the flavor it added, so I'd leave it out if I made these again). I might try this again with more egg.

Awesome side (or even a main dish).  I used goat cheese instead of feta.  The soft cheese added a nice compliment to the zucchini and potato.  I did dry out the zucchini and it was not soupy when I put it together.

Used the spiral cut zucchini and hash brown potatoes to quicken up the prep.

Never in my life would I ever have thought too use feta cheese in a fritter or potato pancake. How brain dead of me since I love feta with herbs and have it in the fridge most of the time so that's what I used. I usually use sharp Cheddar or pepper jack. I made a couple of minor adjustments  so they would hold together better and used my go to cooking oil when it comes to frying something like this which is a 50/50 mixture of bacon fat and canola oil. Honestly if I had any idea these were going to be so delicious we would have had just them for dinner and skipped the pork chops. It never hurts to indulge once in a while.

Besides dessert, these were the highlight of my dinner last night. So many people asked for the recipe and commented on how delicious they were. Notes from other reviewers that I did: used bread crumbs instead of flour to form the patties, and baked instead of fried them.
I doubled the recipe since I was having a lot of guests, and I would recommend not doubling the mint. I actually only added about 1 and 3/4 the mint and it was still a little overpowering (but still delicious).
The mixture was also very wet, I had to add quite a bit of flour AND more breadcrumbs (hence why I am only giving this 4 stars). I didn't use the centre of the zucchini (mostly water and seeds) because I feared it would be too moist and it was still too wet. Probably should have squeezed out the excess moisture from the zucchini before mixing.

I made these according to the original recipe and my family loved them. Simple ingredients that when combined are fabulous! I will definitely be making these again.

These were way too watery.  I made a big mess that wouldn't work. I had to add more breadcrumbs. Very frustrating at first.
