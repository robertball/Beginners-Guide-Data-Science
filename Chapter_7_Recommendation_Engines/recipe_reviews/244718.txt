I rated it before I made it because I know I will love it! Must get all ingredients soon. Looks delicious and inspiring for the summer time!
(Later that day) I made it  just like the recipe and loved it. Next time I am going to try the variation with some different fruits! I also like the suggestion to use honey  instead of the maple syrup but is that just on the topping or can honey be used in the batter? I am doubling the recipe so to make a Flag design with the blueberries, strawberries and bananas for the 4th of July!

This was a really fun and different breakfast! I tried lots of different toppings: yogurt, cream cheese, jam, Nutella, and then fruit on top. Since I didn't have coconut flour, I used twice the amount of a gluten-free flour blend. Also, the recipe is for a really small pizza! I doubled the recipe and there was about enough for an 8-inch crust (a small breakfast for four people).
