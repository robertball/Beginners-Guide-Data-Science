I don't like to give out bad reviews and even though we like everything in this recipe, neither my husband nor I liked the end result on this. I followed the recipe to a T and it was too much lemon and the flavor was just not good. The lemon really overpowered everything. I felt like I had wasted Swordfish (which is a NO NO). I was VERY disappointed to say the least. We will not be having this again.

We made excellent swordfish with this.  My only hesitation in giving it four rather than five stars is that I would add more of the cajun seasoning and mustard next time -- maybe increase by 50% at least.  The lemon flavor was much stronger.

This was really delicious.  I grilled the fish over charcoal and the marinade combined with the smokiness was perfect.

Delicious! I went with the other reviews and used less lemon and more mustard and it turned out great.

Was a good introduction to swordfish, although it was hard to detect the marinade.  I might choose to let the steaks marinade for longer next time.  They also needed more time on the grill - thank you for letting me try.

I am not a fish eater at all.  Made this (substituting something called louisiana blackened fish seasoning for the cajun seasoning ... since it's all i had on hand).  Used on tuna steaks instead of swordfish, and I liked it ... hubby and son loved it.

This was excellent though I agree with the last review...I would suggest marinating all day or over night as well even.  I marinated 3 hours and still would have like a bolder flavor...but the flavor that was there was superb!!  I used mahi mahi in place since the store didnt have the swordfish :(  Great dish though and can't wait to try again marinated for longer!

I used this marinade on salmon last night. While it was delicious, I wish it had just a little bit more of a punch. It's probably my fault though. I could've let it marinate a little longer. All in all though, got great reviews from a bunch of goofballs in the food and beverage industry! I'll definitely use this recipe again.

It was perfect and yummy. I cut down on the cooking time because we like it on the rare side.  You could always put it back on the grill if needed.

This would be a five for me except I like more spice. Next time I will add red pepper flakes to the marinade. Other than that, great in every way! I used a grill pan on the grill to keep the fish from sticking. This worked great. A keeper!

This is a fantastic marinade!  Have tried many many swordfish recipes and this one wins.  Perfect amount of spice, and melt in your mouth fish.

The only aspect of the recipe that held it back from 5 stars was, as said by another reviewer, my preference for a bit more spice.  For those with a milder preference, the by the book recipe would probably be perfect!

Tried it with half the lemon like several others have suggested.  Did not have any Cajun spices so used more Cayenne instead.  Really moist and not too lemon-y.

I made this recipe marinade with Grouper and the guests liked it so much, they were doing handstands on the dining room table.  This recipe marinade is very versatile for different fish types.

me and bf absolutely loved this.. prob b/c i usually end up using a lot more lemon than what a recipe calls for.. i didn't have to do that with this.. halved the oil.. didn't have cajun seasoning so used chili powder instead.. made some extra marinade for grilled shrimp but this worked so much better on the swordfish.. maybe if i would've let it sit longer on the shrimp.. either way.. ty so much for the recipe.. it was awesome

Excellent marinade. I had a bunch of people over so I cut the fillets in half and added a bit more Cayenne Pepper. Absolutely delicious. Can't wait until we have this again.
