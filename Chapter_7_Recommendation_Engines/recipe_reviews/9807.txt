Quite possibly one of the better, easy dessert recipes I've tried in awhile.  Memorable actually.  Rich, decadent and beautiful.  Tender, buttery crust, creamy white chocolate filling, and the timeless combination of chocolate and raspberry. This unquestionably reminded me of petite gourmet desserts you'd find at fine quality brunch buffets. As I melted the semi-sweet chocolate, however, it didn't seem like it would be nearly enough to cover the top adequately.  I doubled it, and was happy I did. Other than that, I prepared the recipe exactly as directed and was very pleased with it.  I lined my pan with foil which made for easy cutting, not to mention a clean pan. For ease in cutting, run a thin-bladed knife under hot water and wipe dry before effortlessly gliding through the hardened chocolate.  Hubs, who when he really enjoys something rates it four stars, exhuberantly exclaimed, "Ten!"

I love these bars!  I've made several batches over the years and they are superb!  I find it easier to double the chocolate glaze and just pour it on top.  The more chocolate, the better!  I also don't hold back with the jam!

I initially gave this recipe a negative review because my husband didn't like it.  He thought the bars were too creamy, which could have been my fault for using ricotta instead of cream cheese, but I also found them quite crumbly and messy.  It turned out that all they needed was to firm up overnight in the refrigerator.  The next day they were great.

Very decadent and delicious!  They turned out fantastic.  I baked them in a 9x13 pan which made them turn out a bit thin.  I would recommend just a 9" aquare pan (or smaller) for more substantial results.

My friends really enjoyed these bars and all asked for the recipe.  
I would have liked the crust to have been a little less crumbly. 
More or less exactly what I had in mind when I was looking to make raspberry bars - I made them again, but used  chocolate chip cookie dough as the crust.  Delicious and chewy.

some helpful hints: I microwave chips on high for 15 sec intervals, instead of on stove. after you put your fruit filling on crust, freeze for 15 mins, and you can then spread cream cheese filling instead of dropping by teaspoonfuls. Freeze again for 15 mins and the choc layer spreads easily too. I used frzn cherries, 1/8 c lemon juice and 2 tbs tapioca and cooked on stovetill thick. I just prefer fresh berries over jam. Was good recipe and will def make again, using other berries too.

Very simple and easy to make, yet delicious!  The taste gets 5 stars, but the fact that they are very gooey and messy to eat gives them 4 stars.  Next time I will grease the bottom of the pan to make sure that the crust can come out cleaner.

Addictingly delicious! Instead of this crust I pressed the Easy Sugar Cookie into the pan. I also covered with the chocolate layer (not drizzled), then decorated the top with shredded coconut. Sooo good!

WOW! This is great! It was easy to make.  I took the advise of other readers and let it set up overnight-although I had to give it a try before going to bed! It was much more firm in the morning.  It is very sweet and rich.  Thanks for sharing!

These have become a staple for parties. I've made a few times now and they are SO good! Honestly, you can't go wrong with these! I use seedless jam because I don't care for the seeds. I bet an apricot or orange jam would also be delicious!

These were pretty good, but I had problems with the white chocolate. I didn't have any white chips, so I used chopped white bark instead...which may have been my problem, but I'm not sure. It hardened up a lot while I was adding it to the cream cheese mixture, which made very unappetizing lumps throughout. I warmed it up just a little to melt some of the lumps, but that made the cream cheese runnier as well. It didn't firm up a lot in the fridge, so the bars looked pretty bad when I cut them...all the filling was oozing out of the sides. I did as another reviewer suggested, and doubled the amount of chocolate glaze. I'm glad I did, because I had a hard enough time covering the whole top of the dessert with the chocolate. The bars tasted pretty good, but looked pretty bad. Thanks for sharing the recipe...but I don't think I'll be making it again.

This recipe deserves 10 stars!  It was sooo good.  I doubled the recipe and placed in 13 x 9 pan.  I added fresh crushed rasberries to the jam.  When melting the white chocolate I added a teaspoon of milk to thin it out and even though it seemed too thin once it was placed in fridge overnight it was perfect.  I also used 1/2 dark chocolate and 1/2 semi sweet chocolate for topping and when melting added 1 t. of orange juice and 1 t. of butter instead of shortening!  Wow!  My guests went crazy over this!

The flavor combination of these bars - with the white chocolate cream cheese, raspberry, and then the milk chocolate is so wonderful.  Honestly, these are superb bars.  The only unfortunate part is that they are really hard to cut into nice, presentable pieces.  The chocolate on top hardens, so when you cut into the bars, it tends to crack.  Then the cream cheese and jam layers kind on squirt out a little.  So a little clean up is needed and I didn't really get a perfect piece, but my mouth didn't care.  The taste makes up for the way that they look.

As Naples recommended I lined my pan with foil which made it very easy to remove. Also doubled the glaze topping. Had a little trouble spreading the cream cheese mixture over the jam. I tried dipping my knife in hot water to cut them but the topping still cracked a little and a small amount of jam filling and cream cheese mixture oozed out. That being said, they are delicious. Everyone at my granddaughter's 1st Holy Communion celebration loved them.

mmm so good! I only changed one thing and that was doubling the semisweet chocolate topping, using butter instead of shortening and adding a bit of homemade corn syrup when melting it down so the topping wouldn't get totally hard and crack when cutting even after it has been refrigerated. Like other reviewers I had trouble spreading the cream cheese mixture and just sorta ended up swirling it with the jam and same for the semisweet chocolate topping. All in all, it came out totally delicious and I will be making this one again. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent...the only thing I would change would be to put more milk in with the cream cheese.  It was so stiff that I couldn't get it to spread on top of the raspberry layer without the raspberries mixing up with the cream cheese.  But the taste was stupendous!

I used whipping cream to make a ganache instead of using the shortening because, well, shortening and chocolate do not belong together.  BUT, raspberry and dark chocolate DO DO DO!!!  Yum.  Faint. One of my absolute favorite flavor combinations.  And I topped with a couple of fresh raspberries on my piece.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!  Now,off to the treadmill......

I was looking for an easy dessert recipe to add to  our Easter supper menu for some dessert variety.  I made this, following the recipe, no modifactions.  I used cream cheese spread (not brick) and I found the mixture easy to spread over the jam.  I let it refrigerate over night. It turned out very well and it is super yummy!  Definately a keeper and I will be making it again.

I would give this a 3 1/2 if I could. You really do need to make these overnight, or they will not set. I learned that the hard way. I put the chocolate layer on after about two hours in the fridge, and chilled them for about another hour. The layers didn't stick to eachother, and they were *awful* to cut. So, they turned out really messy, but everyone loved them and said they tasted great.

These are absolutely delicious !  I let my crust cool for about 10 minutes before spreading on the jam.  Having a little warmth helped the jam spread quite easily. I then added the cream cheese/white choc mixture and had no trouble with it spreading evenly.  After pouring the chocolate ganache over top, I put them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.  The chocolate crackled in some places when I cut them into bars but that isn't a tragedy for me !  They are so good !!!

Mmmmm...yummy!  The crust needs some liquid to hold it together, so you either need to melt your butter a little or do what I did and add warm water, 1 tsp at a time, until it holds together.  It took 3 tsp for me.  I doubled the chocolate, and just used chips.  I let it sit in the fridge overnight and it was perfect the next day.  Loved it!

These are addictive!  I used seedless raspberry jam and added just a couple of drops of raspberry flavoring to the chocolate drizzle.  Wonderful!

I made this almost exactly true to the recipe and it turned out really good.  The only thing I did different is make extra chocolate glaze, and I am glad I did, or there probably would not have been enough.  As others have stated, these do taste better after sitting in the fridge overnight.  The only problem I had with it then was that the crust was a little tough to cut through with a fork.

Nice mix of flavors.  Something different.  I did find it a little too sweet for my liking, however.  If you like sweet treats, you should love this.  It also leaves your hands sticky, so it's not something you want to serve to a group of small children, unless you get them to the sink right after.

This five-star rating is one of the easiest I've ever given.  We were amazed at how sublime these tasted, and a doubled recipe lasted just a day.  The only changes I made (other than doubling everything) were using an entire 10-ounce jar of raspberry preserves (which has a net effect of increasing the recipe by one ounce since I doubled it}, adding all the layers just after taking the crust out of the oven and then refrigerating overnight, substituting cream for the milk, and substituting dark chocolate for the milk chocolate.  I will make more this morning, and I will change nothing.  

I recommend using the crust as specified.  It added a flakiness that served as an excellent counterpoint to the richness of the white chocolate and cream cheese.

Very good, but very rich!  I doubled the recipe and made in a 9x13 pan.  I also doubled (or in this case since I doubled the recipe, quadrupled the amount of chocolate glaze)  Thanks for sharing this decadent recipe, Becky!

Fabulous! and I gave them 5 stars even though I prefer lighter desserts. The first time, I didn't change a thing. The second time, I doubled it but found out I had run out of white chocolate. so, I just put about a total of 500g of cream cheese and only a cup of white chocolate for the double recipe and it turned out great. this has become one of my favourites

Okay, these are good but extremely rich!!!  I think I'd prefer them without the chocolate layer, actually.  I almost forgot that chocolate layer anyway . . .LOL.  I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry bc that's what I had on hand, and that worked just fine.  I couldn't find my white chocolate chips, which I usually have, so I guess I ran out.  :o(  Otherwise, I stuck with the recipe and these are a good, if really rich, bar.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not sure if it was the changes I made, but the recipe was just not my favorite.  I used a sugar cookie bottom from store-bought refrigerator dough.  Was really hard to get out of the glass pan.  1 cup of jam was waaay too much for a 9x9 pan.  Would use a half cup next time.  The cream cheese/white chocolate layer was yummy and I'm not a white chocolate fan.  The glaze I omitted the shortening and made a "ganache" with whipping cream and used more glaze than called for.  All in all, it was OK, though sooo challenging to get out of the pan and cut up.  Stuff slid around and I could hardly keep the bars together.  And that was after refrigerating.

Wow!  The only change I made was doubling the chocolate topping and I'm glad I did.  I used shortening as the recipe says and it really helped keep the chocolate smooth and pretty.  These are so delicious!  I made them to take to a dinner, but had to sample them first.  I may have to make more for the dinner.  Edited to add: use a pastry blender to cut in the butter.  It works beautifully.

New favorite dessert!  Sooo yummy!!  I didn't measure the amount of raspberry jam - I just put it on until it looked like enough and I also did as others suggested and put ganache on top.  It was so rich and delicious I can't wait to make them again.

I made a stupid, stupid mistake with these. After making two batches, I looked at the jam jar and realized that I had accidentally grabbed PLUM jam instead of raspberry. I could have kicked myself, but when several of my friends and family members tried them, they told me that the bars were STILL really good.

Easy, unique, and delicious.  I didn't have white chocolate so I used semi-sweet.  The chocolate-raspberry combo was great but I can't wait to try it with white chocolate.  As for the crust, I used the crust from "Down Under Lemon Tart" (from this site) and it was perfect.

These are fantastic and taste like a raspberry cordial!  I used a 11x7 pan which was perfect.  Sugar-free jam & low-fat cream cheese were my only changes which still allowed for a decadent dessert.

We really enjoyed this dessert!  My husband loved it and is already requesting it to be made again and again.  We think it tastes best directly out of the refrigerator, rather than room temperature.  I made exactly as written except I followed other reviewers suggestions and lined the pan with foil and sprayed with cooking spray for easy removal.  I had no problems and it was great!

A lovely dessert! Easy to make, lovely presentation, delicious to eat! I lined the pan with parchment paper so sticking was not a problem. Cut the bars with the sharp edge of a spatula that was heated in hot water to shattering of the chocolate was not a problem. Cut it into 9 pieces so the sweetness was not a problem. A winner!

This gets 5 stars for taste, but I had a hard time with the layers.  That being said, I am not very good at making things look pretty, so I shouldn't be surprised that mine looked like a mess.  Both the cream cheese layer and the chocolate layer were difficult to spread out, and the jam oozed between the chocolate when I tried to smooth it.  Nonetheless, it was very tasty.  I thought I had raspberry jam, but it turned out to be cherry.  Still good, though the cherries in the jam added to my troubles. Other people are very capable of making this look nice, as the photos prove.  Just not me :)

I wanted so badly to love this recipe, but it falls short in a number of ways. Although the overall taste combination is on point (ooh...raspberry, white chocolate and milk chocolate), it is simply way too sweet, and I am a bona fide lover of all things sweet. It really needs a salty element to transform it.

Also, the crust on this is too brittle and crumbly and it sticks terribly to the baking pan. I even thought I baked it for too short a time, but it ended up being hard. It is almost impossible to get these bars out of the pan, and I used a well-seasoned baking stone (Pampered Chef) 9x9 pan.I don't know if it sticks because it apparently needs to remain in the refrigerator. Who knows. But I certainly would not make this again. I'm just not rating it below a "3" because I do love the flavor combination.

Made this for coworkers and it got rave reviews.  I doubled the entire recipe.  The only changes I made were a tsp of vanilla and pecans to the crust, and I used water a tablespoon at a time until the dough held together.  It was excellent.  Thanks for sharing!

Sorry, but these didn't work out for me. I really prefer a bar cookie that doesn't ooze and fall apart before it reaches my mouth. I tried the suggestion of letting the bars "set" overnight in the fridge, but it didn't make any difference. I also think the milk needs to be added to the white chocolate instead of the cream cheese. The white choc. chips (Nestle) I used just turned the consistency of modeling clay when melted. I added a little milk to it and the consistency improved, but I still think the cream cheese layer is too runny.

Very rich and satisfying. The semi sweet chocolate glaze tones down the sweet inside layers just enough to make it the perfect dessert bar. The crust is crisp and buttery, much like a lemon bar crust.

Great recipe! Very rich and creamy! I made a bit of a mistake with the crust though- I mixed the crust ingredients with a mixer which made it more flourey than I it should be(so the butter couldn't melt and bring the whole crust together better). It didn't turn light brown, and I let some extra butter melt on top of it and cooked it longer. It turned out harder than I would have liked, but even with that it didn't take away from the recipe- it was still delicious!

I always get a lot of compliments when I make these bars. They are a bit messy, but keeping them refrigerated helps. The only modification I make to the recipe is to sprinkle a few sliced almonds on the top. Delicious!
