I must have misread the directions.  After it simmered for the 2 hours, it had not thickened at all. It appeared to be broth with tomatoes floating in it.  Can 8 cups of water be right? Did anyone else have this problem? I don't recommend this one at all.

This was good, but not the best we have ever had.  It was a little thinner than we like, but it wasn't too thin.  It made alot so I should have cut the recipe in half.  My husband liked the addition of the crushed red pepper which I don't add to my sauce, he usually sprinkles it on before he eats.
