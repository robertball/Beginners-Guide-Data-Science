Great flavor.  Served this with the Alaska Salmon Bake with Pecan Crunch Coating from this website.  Used only 1/2 the butter though.

Only used 3/4 cup butter - served over mushroom ravioli - it was WONDERFUL!  Just make sure you whisk - A LOT!  I'll be saving this one!

My family loves this. I serve it with bowtie or farfalle pasta and chicken. I modified it slightly: 3 bay leaves instead of 1, omit white wine vinegar. I have substituted the shallot with both garlic and regular onion as I have available. I probably use a bit more wine, a bit more cream, but less butter than this recipe calls for. I use about one stick of real butter. I cook the noodles until almost done and finish them in the sauce and then throw in cooked sliced chicken. The people at my table are always fighting for the last little bit.

Maybe I'm just cooking challenged when it comes to Beurre Blanc.  Are you supposed to cool the vinegar mixture before pouring in the cream bcs. it just curdled on me and then turned into a buttery soupy curddled mess in the end.  :(

Awesome base Beurre Blanc recipe!  Came out fantastic and made this close to the recipe (only 1 sick of butter and I probably used double the chopped shallot because I'm terrible at "eyeing" things).  I've made it a few other ways, but honestly this was the easiest and the best and it didn't break (WIN!).  I can see a little lemon zest in this next time or maybe even some dill?  The trick to strain it was so simple, yet so what I had NOT been doing - why did I not think of this?  Thanks for that!  You do need to babysit this closely, like any cream/acid sauce, and once it's time to add the butter (have it very cold and very close) you must whisk non-stop or it will break for sure.  I frequently pull it off the heat, add a chunk of butter, and whisk and if it isn't melting well return to the burner for 10-15 seconds to get up to melting temp - but don't let boil - repeat over and over until butter is all incorporated.   Awesome over my crabmeat stuffed tilapia and prosciutto roasted asparagus!  THANK YOU!

Just delicious and easy as can be.  If you seem to be getting a sauce that is clear instead of opaque add a small amount additional cream.  Constant whisking is the key.  Had this with pan seared salmon and it was fabulous.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I did not have heavy cream so I used 2% milk and this turned out great.  I used as a pasta sauce tossed with cubed chicken, spinach and sun dried tomatoes.  Use salted butter for good flavor.

Had this with tilapia and the family loved it. For those people who have trouble with this, try adding a little extra cream to the reduction and set it aside and allow it to cool before adding the butter. Then slowly add in the chilled butter a little bit at a time as you wisk it in while moving the pan back onto the heat and then off as needed.

I added about a tsp of garlic and only used 1/2 a cup of butter. As well I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used just some white vinegar and some chinese cooking wine to substitute. I used it as a sauce on crab cakes and with some mashed potatoes - simply divine! I would definitely recommend it with near any type of seafood, especially if you can't get super fresh fish.

Excellent Sauce but is a little salty with salted butter being added. Next time I will use unsalted butter and add salt to taste. I used really cold butter and did not have an issue with my sauce separating.

I didn't have any bay leaf, but it still tasted amazing over my grilled swordfish steaks and prawns. Will definitely be making this again! Used chardonnay for the white wine.

I had this on a crabcake recently & loved it.  This recipe yields a lot, so next time I might half it.  It broke on me but still tasted good.  I used this on "maryland crab cake II" sooo yummy!!!

I am a huge beurre blanc fan.  This did not taste like it should.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I think I should have followed others reviews and halved the butter.  Too much butter, too watery, never really thickened.  I may combine it with other recipes to try to perfect.

This was delicious.  I served it with salmon and people were lapping it up.  I threw in a bit of grainy mustard, but it would be great without.  Thanks for the excellent recipe.

Since I was serving just 2 smallish salmon filets, I decreased the ingredients to about half. Used green onions rather than shallots, and white wine, not vinegar. I used much less butter, and maybe should’ve used more since it came out a bit thick, but good. It seemed to lack something so I added some lemon juice, and was better. Will tr6 this again since I love sauces.

This reduction is actually beurre nantais due to the addition of cream.   Beurre blanc has no cream and is a classic emulsified butter popularized by Julia Child.  I'm not splitting hairs but if you're going to prepare classical cuisine why not learn properly?

I eliminated the peppercorns so my kids wouldn't complain about that. The sauce separated. It tastes great but I was so disappointed.

Just my opinion...  I actually thought the vinegar overpowered the sauce.  I think in the future I'll try one that calls for less or no vinegar

I left out the cream and it did perfectly for the most delicious and succulent of fresh caught river salmon from our local fish market.  Also, with some to spare, I drizzled it over my spinach shallot rice and quinoa and parmesan pilaf for an added depth.

I also used one stick of botter only and added some capers.  Came out great.
