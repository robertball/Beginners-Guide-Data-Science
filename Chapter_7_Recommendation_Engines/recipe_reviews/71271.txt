I love tilapia and very much liked this recipe with the following adjustments. Melted swiss gets a little too gummy for my taste, so I used shredded fresh parm. Steak seasoning is on the salty side, so I made up my own seasoning blend. For those of you who've never eaten tilapia, as with most fish does not taste fishy at all. If it does smell funky, take it back. Thanks Rena!

I used bottled lemon juice, Shredded Mozzerella and Tones Canadian Steak Seasoning (what I had on hand)  - awesome! Can't wait to eat the left overs tomorrow.

Yum!! No one else in my house likes fish, but this was easy to scale down to one serving.  I used cheddar cheese for personal preference and baked at 425 degrees for about 14 minutes.  The cheese was nice and browned and I loved the flavor of the tomatoes and oregano on top.  A very different way to prepare fish from the usual lemon butter sauce, and oh so so so good!!

This was a nice alternative to the regular tilapia with lemon butter sauce i usually make. I marinated the tilapia in lemon, some steak seasoning, minced garlic and oregano. After an hour or so I breaded them, put them in a baking dish, added a slice of Swiss cheese to each, tomato on top and lemon slices along the sides. Cooked it 350* 23 mins. Came out delicious! Will make again.

Yum.  I did make some changes by using sliced cherry tomatoes, smoked mozarella and Emirl's steak seasoning.  So flavorful and easy to make.  Tasted great the next day also!
Thank you-

my family loved this fish... only differences i made was using old cheddar for the cheese grated on top and a seafood rub (paprika, garlic, onion powder, etc) rather than the steak spice and lime instead of lemon as that's what i had on hand. would make again!

This was absolutely delicious! I was unsure how these ingredients would taste on a fish, but my husband and 19 month old both LOVED it! I followed the recipe exactly except used Muenster cheese because that's what I had on hand. Baked at 400 for 20 minutes and it was perfect! This is definitely my new Tilapia recipe! Thank you so much!

I made this recipes last night and it was delicious.  I didn't have any lemons so I used lemon juice and made sure that the fish was coated on both sides.  I used McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning, swiss cheese, cherry tomatoes and the oregano.  Even my 15  yr. old son that doesn't like fish enjoyed it and even had a 2nd piece.  This recipe is a keeper, thank you for sharing it!

I loved this! Instead of swiss cheese, I used 2oz of cheddar per piece of tilapia. It was delicious! The only thing I would add is a bit of broil at the end of baking to crisp it up.

We used mahi-mahi instead of tilapia.  This recipe is the best for a seasoned, baked fish that's low in fat and calories that I have found anywhere.

This recipe is awful.   It was very fishy tasting and the lemon jucie does not go well with the tomatoes and cheese.  Don't bother with this recipe.

This recipe was a really great way to eat fish - and I'm always look for ways to make fish more tasty! My best advice: use steak season vary sparingly! It adds great flavour, but it also makes it quite salty, so just be careful.

I really enjoyed this.  Even more important, my husband inhaled it!  Only changes I made was using the bottled lemon juice and Parmesan cheese.  This is going in our book.

My husband loved this. However, I am not a fish fan and I found it to be just ok.  I followed the recipe as indicated with the exception of sprinkling garlic powder after the oregano.  This tilapia had a little fishier taste than other ways I've prepared it;  I was hoping for no fish taste.

This is quite good! I used bottled lemon juice, canned diced tomatoes, swiss-style "American" cheese slices, and left off the oregano (don't care for it), and it turned out great. For the record, I used Webber's Chicago Steak seasoning.

I actually  changed this recipe slightly to ingredients that I had - I used feta cheese instead of Swiss and I didn't entirely covered tilapia with cheese, so my version was a little bit lighter in calorie count, and I used not just oregano, but home-made Italian seasoning. Even my husband, who doesn't like fish at all, gobbled it down and said that it was great!

I subbed reduced fat provolone for the swiss cheese and was surprised at how good the fish was with the cheese.  I could not taste the steak seasoning at all, so I guess I was a bit too light handed. My fish was a little rubbery so I would be very cautious with the cooking time.

I had frozen tilapia filets and was looking for something to dress them up.  I did leave off the steak seasoning, but the lemon juice, swiss cheese & tomatoes were attractive as well as tasty.  I will certainly use this again, thanks!

I hate fish unless it is deep fried and crunchy, but in my quest for a healthier diet, I thought I would give this one a try, and it was AWESOME.  It had a great flavor and didn't tasted fishy at all.  I didn't change anything in the recipe.  Served it over brown rice and it was great!!!  Will be making this one again.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I didn't have a full pound of fish so I only used one tomato and one lemon.  I used thin slices of cheese, and still used 4. Can't wait to make it again!!

Very good and easy recipe. I only made one substitution - did not have steak seasoning on hand so I used N'Orleans Cajun seasoning. This turned out great - will be serving it again.

This was quick, good, and very easy.  I even used canned tomatoes, plain american cheese and bottled lemon juice because I did not have the fresh stuff on hand and it still came out tasty.  Will definitely do again.

This was pretty good.  My husband and I were getting tired of Chicken and decided that we hadn't had Talapia in forever so I set to work on finding a recipe that sounded unique.  This definately took the cake.  When I first looked at the ingrediants, I was surprised to see so many variants in flavoring and it intrigued me.  It turned out very nicely.  I didn't change anything to the recipe and baked it for about 25 minutes.  It was moist and flakey with bold flavors that blended very well and I've got to say, the tomato really makes this dish.  My husband raved about it and instructed that I add this to my list of keepers.  Thanks for the good eats. ;)

I didn't have Swiss cheese, so I tested three others: shredded cheddar, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan. Cheddar was by far the best. Even better: my fish-hating 8-yr-old ate it.

This recipe is awesome! It was so easy and fast. I substituted the swiss cheese for fresh parmesan cheese instead and it was so good, i also used lemon juice instead of fresh lemons and that was good also.

Very good, and easy to make.  I used grated cheese instead of cheese slices, and a little bottled lemon juice since I didn't have lemons.  I plan to use this recipe again.

This was Delicious.. I followed the recipe to a 'T', then I sprinkled a very small amount of 'dried Basil' on top of the Tomatoes, (Lemon slices on top too!) then into the oven for 20 min.. Great Flavor, Tilapia was moist & flakey....all the seasonings were not over-powering... Will make this again, it's a KEEPER!!  I changed the recipe to ''1 Serving'' ... FANTASTIC!!!

This tilapia was great!  I'm not a fish lover myself but try to eat some occasionally.  It was very tasty...I put quiet a bit of steak seasoning and oregano in it.  Great combination of flavors!
