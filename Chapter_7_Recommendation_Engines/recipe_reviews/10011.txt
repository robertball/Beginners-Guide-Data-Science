Great, simple spritz butter cookies!  Not too sweet, but nice and buttery.  This recipe made 4 trays full, about 5 dozen cookies not including the gobs of dough my 4 year old swiped. One hint - you probably won't need to refrigerate the dough to use in a cookie press unless it's really hot in your kitchen.  We used dough at room temp and the cookies came out perfect on our first try.  This one's a keeper!

I've tried to find a recipe close to the one made by my best friend's mother, and this definitely came the closest. I made a batch and a half, but I left out 1/2 cup of the flour. I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract for a little extra flavor, and it was wonderful. No need to chill the dough, and since my cookie press was broken, I used a small scoop, and pressed the dough down slightly with wet fingers, which also helped the sugar and sprinkles to stick. And a 350 degree oven seemed to work just as well A wonderful recipe.

These cookies are FANTASTIC!!!! They taste just like the Danish Butter Cookies that come in the tins at the store.  The key is to really beat the butter and sugar, then the egg and vanilla until it looks fluffy.

I made a double batch of these yesterday.  However, I didn't use the cookie press, I just rolled them out and cut them into circles.  I baked them just until they were set- no browning (I like them soft).  I made a frosting out of 1 stick of margarine softened, 1 lb. powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and a scant 1/4 c. milk to use on them, then decorated with colored sugars.  They turned out great!  My husband loved them and wouldn't even let me throw 3 or 4 cookies out that I had cut too thin and had browned!  These are the best, although I don't know how much I would have liked them if I wouldn't have put icing on them.

I lost my "old faithful" spritz cookie recipe, but this is every bit as good.  I didn't need to chill the dough, and I removed them from the oven at the first miniscule hint of browning (my family prefers soft cookies over crisp cookies).  Thanks for sharing this!

Excellent recipe!! this is the first time I have used a cookie press and it worked great. I would suggest not chilling the spritz as it worked well right after mixing. It has the taste that this kinda cookie is supposed to.  It can be changed by adding whatever u like...I added a 1/4 brown sugar for the kids sweet tooth. I devided the spritz into 4 batches to try different things with...added 1 tbls butter extract to one batch and 1 tbls peppermint extract to another. The other 2 I just used different food color...Kids loved em. and so did we!!!

This recipe was delicious!  I had a great recipe for butter cookies from my mother and I lost it.  I haven't found a recipe that comes close to her recipe, until now.  My husband and kids can't get enough of these.  Thank you so much for posting the recipe!

I just finished trying to make these cookies taste better so I added a few more splashes of vanilla extract, for a sweeter taste 1/4 cup more white sugar. I did not refrigerate the dough. I cooked them in a 400F oven for 8 minutes for the golden brown color under the cookie.The jury is in and they are better than the original recipe. I would personally stay with the butter cookie recipe I added in my recipe box. It's a ton better. I dream of the taste of it's goodness. I hope this helps anyone trying to improve this recipe. Good luck! You'll need it!

I was trying to find a real nice buttery cookie - but these weren't as buttery as I would like - though they are still good.  MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT OVER BAKE! I kept putting them back in the oven because they looked like they weren't baked enough because they didn't really brown. So the key is to only bake about 5-6 minutes when still soft and then take out and cool - as they cool they get firmer.  

I used "lucious buttercream" to sandwich in between two buttercookies and then dipped half in chocolate.  Yummy! Main thing is do not overbake or will be too hard!

True, I'm a novice baker, but these cookies turned out awfully bland.  They didn't taste bad but they certainly weren't anything special.  Maybe to accompany a cup of hot tea they might do the trick, but these wouldn't be anywhere near my top pick of tasty cookies. Overall I'd say to skip these unless you're in the mood for a fairly tasteless, dull treat.

I'm an '80s baby.  When I was in kindergarten, 36 years ago, in Memphis, we had the BEST butter cookies at school.  This recipe, minus the egg, comes REALLY close.  If you want the butter cookies that crumble in your hands as you eat them, leave out the egg.  If you want a chewy cookie, add the egg.  Other that that, GREAT RECIPE!!

I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder in thinking it won't rise without baking powder. My cookies tasted buttery and not So sweet...delicious!..crispy and buttery..I also wanted to be creative --- I wanted to make jelly filled cookies, but thought their recipes would yield flavorless cookies(and that the only thing good would be the jam). I tried putting a dollop of jam in the center of these cookies to make "buttery jelly filled cookies." I just pressed down in the center of the cookie making a penny sized well or so, and scooped on jam...I baked them at 350 first to see I'd they would cook, but seems like for my oven, they needed to be at 400. So I raised the temperature to 400 and baked until edges are golden brown...which should take around 10 minutes or So. The cookies don't have to be brown in color..They probably taste best at a beige color with ONLY golden EDGES. My cookies stayed white, revealing the color of the jam in the middle..soo pretty. Thank you soo much for the recipe. Those who gave this recipe 1's are people that didn't follow instructions and don't know how to bake.

This recipe is delicious but I would NOT RECOMMEND chilling the dough if you are using a cookie press.  It needs to be room temperature otherwise it won't go through the press.

Quick! Easy to throw together and roll out in a pinch like I did today.  Next time I'd add a 1/2 tsp. salt, the cookies were a bit bland, but good...

I love this reicipe and I can't get enough of these little cookies. I made them at my neighbors house and I let her keep the big double batch of them because I thought that they would be safer there. Turned out I wasn't the only person who loved these cookies...

This is a WONDERFUL recipe for cut-out cookies! The dough rolls out and cuts easily. I used 3/4 c. granulated sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar for a little different flavor. I like my cookies a little on the soft side, so I baked them just until set, but not browning on the edges yet. These are so good, that I have a second batch in the oven even now!!

I loved this recipe.I used it with the kids to make cut out cookies for christmas. There was no problems at all and the kids did great...cookies baked perfectly. Not exceptionally buttery....or sweet but we alway decorate ours so they were perfect. I must add that when your press the cookies the flour added for them not to stick took some of the sweetness away. I will use this recipe again!

I actually ***LOVED*** the fact that these cookies were *not* overpoweringly sweet, because you can taste the baked cookieness instead of just sweetness.  I especially liked the texture when I used margarine (true with so many cookies, no clue why).  I loved that these were soft instead of crunchy, and not dry at all.  The only bad thing about these is that you can't eat enough of them!  Also, I did half the batch with lemon extract - it's SO good both ways.  And it would be PERFECT with tea or coffee too.  Superb recipe, it will be a staple for us for sure.

This recipe calls for way too much flour. We ended up with a floury crumbly mess. Good to eat raw but it does not form into edible cookies.

This worked out perfectly. I had lost my late mother-in-law's recipe for cherry nut cookies(a family favorite)and needed a replacement.I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and one jar marachino cherries, chopped.I then formed the dough into logs. When it was chilled the dough was easy to slice and bake. They were wonderful, and no one knew it wasn't Grandma's original recipe!

These cookies were great!  I received a new cookie press for my birthday and this was the first recipe I tried.  I also did not have to chill the dough in order to press it.  I sprinkled it with sugar, and yum!  I also recommend having 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract, or just use all almond for a little different taste!  Even the next day, the few that survived were delicious.  Thank you for this great cookie recipe!  :-)

These turned out really great. My whole family loved them. I myself couldn't stop eating them. I think the trick to make sure to mix till light and fluffy. I also added a little dark brown sugar with the white, to make them a little more sweet.

Loved this simple recipe that doesn't use baking soda or powder. The only 4 small changes I made were:
1. Lowered flour to 2 1/4 cups.
2. Rolled dough with hands into 3 logs wrapped in sealing wrap, so I could use at different times.
3. Rolled balls in cin/sugar mixture before baking.
4. Baked them at 375.
Important...have butter soft at room temperature before creaming.

I adjusted this recipe to make them airier, softer, and shorten prep time. First of all I should say it doesn't say what state the butter should be in before mixing. I used butter sticks out of the freezer and used a stand mixer to cream it with the sugar. I also cut the flour used almost in half (using just a little over half) I didn't measure it perfectly just looked for the dough the be light but where it would stay together. Then I skipped the chilling stage and did 2 minutes over max cook time. Making it this way I would give them 5 stars they are slightly crisp on the outside very soft and airy in the middle and taste perfect. When cooking anything you should adjust the recipe using your perception and hoped out come to make it suited best for what you want and that is exactly what I did. Hope another cook finds this helpful.

These were excellent cookies.  I just got a cookie press and I was looking for a recipe to use with it.  The first one I tried the cookies did not keep their shape while baking -- these did, they were perfect.  I made two batches, in the second batch I replaced 1/3 C of flour with cocoa powder, both came out wonderful.  I found that 9 minutes was the perfect time to bake these cookies.  Let cool 2 minutes on the cookie sheet then cool on foil or paper.  We decorated some of them with colored sugar but it was unnecessary, they were great as written.  I am a big fan of warm cookies but these actually tasted better cold.  They were nice and crispy!  I am definitely going to make these again!

I bought a cookie press but couldn't get the darn thing to work so I rolled these out after adding lemon extract (which they definitely need).  They were still a little bland and not sweet so I made a glaze out of 1C powdered sugar, 3/4 t. lemon extract, 2T butter and 2T of hot water.  They were perfect then....very lemony but not too much.

I'm at a loss as to how this recipe rated 4 1/2 stars.  The dough would not extrude through my cookie press (and yes, it was properly chilled).  I finally gave up and rolled the dough into balls, pressed them down with a fork, and sprinkled them with colored sugar.  They came out as basically tasteless little blobs.  I would not make this recipe again!!!

I'm vegan, and found this makes a very very yummy vegan cookie by using vegan (no whey) margarine instead of butter, and replace the egg with 1 tsp. soy flour mixed with 1 tbs. water.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I lived in Chicago Ill. from 1966 to 1970 I can remember the smell of butter cookies baking in the mornings, my best memories of 1st thru 3rd grade.  When I first made cookies with this recipe I was not impress... something was missing, so I decided to try it again with a teaspoon of baking powder.  Yessss... that is it baking powder was the missing ingredient.  2 stick of butter not margerine.  hope that helps... enjoy:-).

I wasn't very impressed with these cookies. I divided the dough in half and added 3/4 tbsp vanilla extract to one batch and 3/4 tbsp lemon extract to the other batch. Despite using more than the called-for amount of extract, both batches of the cookies didn't have much taste (especially the vanilla). The texture was dry even though I only cooked it for 8 minutes at 400F. One batch I chilled for an hour and it was way too stiff to get through the cookie press, and the other batch I chilled for fifteen minutes and it kept breaking upon coming out of the cookie press, so it wouldn't work either way (I ended up making drop cookies). The cookies were edible but I wouldn't give them away as presents. I'm going to try adding a glaze (as suggested by some of the other reviewers) and hopefully that will improve these cookies.

My family truly enjoyed these cookies.  We used the dough in a cookie press and I didn't chill at first but had to by the 3rd sheet.  This is definitely a recipe that we will keep.

Was easy to make.  I did not even chill the dough or the cookie sheets.  I also just dropped them on the pan (no cutters, no rolling, no press)  I would use this recipe again

I made these cookies again; only this time I added about 1 cup of white chocolate chips to the dough. I didn't chill it; I used a large scoop to drop them on the cookie sheet & baked them at 375 degrees for about 10 minutes. They turned out great!  It added an extra "mmmmmm!" to an already good cookie!  I can't keep the guys out of the cookie jar now!

I was looking for a simple, basic butter cookie recipe for my press and this did the trick.  The cookie dough worked beautifully with my press, the recipe was easy, and most importantly, the cookies are great - not too sweet and not too buttery - just right.  We demolished the whole batch.  Thanks.

I made this as my first attempt at spritz cookies.  I'm used to my great-grandmother's spritz cookies which would melt in your mouth.  While these were very good, they were crisper than hers.  I'll keep on the search for a recipe that tastes like hers.

Taste like nothing but flour and sugar to me. The cooking temp is too high 350 degrees is just fine. I tried to doctor it up with ½ a cup more butter and more sugar.

it took me a long time to find a good easy shortbread cookie recipe. this one nailed it. the bater can be flakey but once baked the cookies are amazing. they are so buttery. sometimes i frost them or put sprinkles on them or just leave them plain. they are great as a filler in a cookie basket or just as a treat to have in the house.

The cookies are very hard and have a very simple sugar cookie flavor. I couldn't use my cookies press with this recipe. The good thing? The cookie cutters are easy to use with this dough, especially if you are making cookies with kids.

I followed other reviews and did not chill my dough, but I did run out of all-purpose flour and used half all-purpose and half whole wheat. They have more flavor with the wheat flour. They were perfect!

I recommend changing the name of these to EPIC WIN BUTTER COOKIES.  I refrigerated the dough for about 30 minutes, and I didn't bother to chill the pans.  I shaped these by rolling them into balls and pressing a thumbprint into each one. Batch #1 got holiday sprinkles in the thumbprint. If I had Hershey Kisses on hand, a kiss would have gone into the thumbprints in Batch #2. I also considered jam or a frozen raspberry + a couple chocolate chips for the thumbprints, but decided to go with plain.  This is a very easy recipe, and it was perfect for my "I need homemade butter cookies RIGHT NOW" frame of mind.

This recipe is great! I used it to make tart cookies. I made a thumb impression in the middle and filled it with peach, blackberry, and strawberry perserves. Yum! The blackberry was the best!

Very good.  Tastes a lot like the danish cookies in a tin.  I used the dough in a press, so I didn't chill it.

Excellent butter cookies for the cookie press. Light and with a texture that melts in your mouth. They reminded my mother of "Melting Moments" cookies.

They turned out hard, not soft, and weren't as rich and delicious as others I have made. Perhaps I overworked the dough or the butter was too soft. Not sure. The flavour was ok.

This is one of the best spritz/butter cookie recipes I've used. However, I did make some slight changes.  I reduced my flour by a 1/4 cup, I added a 1/4 cup more butter and also used almond extract with the vanilla.  Also, I found that 400 degrees F was to high even for just 8 minutes but 375 degrees F was perfect at 8 minutes....nice color and texture!  I've saved this recipe and will share.

Well, i found this recipe to be low on the taste scale.  I will probably  add just a little extra vanilla to it the next time.  Maybe i should have refrigerated the dough like it suggested to.  The oven was hot so i just baked them.  I used my melon baller to drop the dough onto the cookie sheet and then I flattened them out by using my large meat tenderizer mallet...waffle print dow.  It goes quick, is fun and makes a waffle pattern on the cookie.  I then sprinkled some colored sugar on top of the cookie prior to baking.  The waffle pattern was great for a resting place for the sugar.  Oh, i put food coloring in the butter, sugar, egg mixture as I mixed it in the mixer.  I wanted some holiday color.  

I found the baked  cookie to be more doughy so perhaps I need to flatten them more the next time.  I will play with this recipe again and read more of the reviews for tips.  I love Spritz and  I really wanted a quicker way to make them vs using the press.

Be careful, these are addicting. I made them in a cookie press and they taste just like the butter cookies in the tin. Dangerous. And they taste even better 3 days later!

Very good!  

I ran out of regular flour, so 2/3 cup was whole wheat.  I chilled the dough in thirds, and rolled it out for cookie cutters.  Then, I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar over the cookies before baking.  They needed 6 minutes at 400 degrees. SO DELICIOUS.

Love these cookies! My 11 year old daughter wanted to make cookies, and she choose these. Added a t of almond extract, and dusted the tops with sanding sugar.

This is a great spritz recipe.  The cookies come out crisp and delicious.  I lessened the flour by a 1/3 cup and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla for flavor.  It worked very well with my cookie press.

These cookies turned out excellent! Perfect for a cookie press...very easy to use! I agree that the key is to make sure the sugar and butter are light and creamy before adding the other ingredients. I also made sure the dough and cookie sheets were chilled. 
The kids sprinkled colored sugars on half of the batch and I drizzled bakers chocolate on the rest. My entire family loved these!

This was so easy to make! I only chilled the dough for about 15 min. and the pan for 5 min. These were nice and soft! I melted chocolate kisses to dip them in and make them a little sweeter! I also substituted butter flavor crisco for regular butter. I'll definetly make these again this holiday season!

I mixed the dough and refrigerated for about 2 hrs.   When I tried to put it in my cookie press, it was much too stiff.   I used it for rolled cookies, using the smooth side of a plastic cutting board.  I used about a baseball siize piece of dough at a time.  The dough rolled out to the 1/4 inch so easy.  I did not use any additional flour to the well chilled dough.  I made large snowflake cut outs, about 4 inches in diameter.  Chill the cookie sheets.  A double batch made 30 of these large cookies.  Baked in a convection over at 375 for 10 to 12 minutes.  They taste absolutely wonderful.  And so easy to roll.  I will frost tomorrow .  Thanks for this amazing recipe.

I used this recipe with canabutter I made. I added an extra egg because the flour became flakey in the mixture process. I also baked it at 375 degrees to ensure I didn't burn any THC. It was fun to make and fun to eat too!

Great butter cookie, I make them fast and loose, only following the recipe vaguely, in 20 min my cookies were ready and delicious. I did at a teensy bit of lemon extract with the vanilla. Hubby loves them.

We have made this recipe 2 years in a row now and its wonderful! The cookies are so light and mild tasting. My son and I used the cookie press method and then dunked half of the cookie in melted semi sweet chocolate chips. They were very impressive and sooooo simple to make. If using a press there is NO need to chill the dough. If you like a sweeter cookie sprinkle them with plain white sugar and colored sugars for a more festive look!

This is a great recipe. I suggest two small variations. 3/4 cup sugar instead of a whole cup and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder. The result was great.

Not a bad recipe if you like the taste of buttery cookies but if you want to make them more moist, I'd recommend a 1/3 cup vegetable oil. (you may need to cook them for another 3-5 minutes).

These cookies taste very good, very buttery, but I find they are somewhat too heavy. Next time, I will cut down to 2 or 2 1/4 cup flour, and see how that goes. I also find that they could use a little more sugar...

These were the best butter cookies I have ever made. I used almond extract which gave them a great flavor. I rolled the dough in a tube shape and cut the cookies on an angle. I have done variations with this recipe for different occasions.I have dipped 1/2 the cookie in melted chocolate.They are good with some jam sandwiched between two cookies.Yummy

This recipe is what is says it is.  A simple butter cookie recipe.  After reading the reviews, I added almond and butter extract.  They turned out perfect.  A light cookie.  Great with coffee!

I quite liked these.  They are not overly sweet but have a pleasant flavor.    I pressed them long and some I dipped 1/2 in chocolate, some I sandwiched together with nutella in the middle, some I served plain.    They are always a hit and get eaten up.

These are delicious and not too sweet like most press cookie recipes!  (WIN!) But I've made them twice and still cant get them to come out of the press properly, i.e. they just keep clinging to the press.  Although to be fair, I am using my mother's old press which you actually have to twist yourself, and it is not as technologically advanced as those newfangled contraptions and needs a firmer dough to separate from the press.     Oh well.  The VERY ugly cookies taste delicious.

Uh, no. This tasted more like sugar cookies, but it was more hard. It didn't at all taste like butter cookies. The cookie itself was decent, but I wouldn't want to eat it every day. It wasn't great, it wasn't horrible, it was mediocre. It tasted like a plain old cookie.

Very tasty, but with one change: When I made this recipe, I noticed that my cookie dough was too stiff  to send through my cookie press, so I added an extra egg and it easily solved the problem for me.

Thought they were great! They did taste like danish tin cokies after they cool. I didn't cool first,  sprayed the pans, and just made little balls and flattened slighty. I sprinkled some of the tops with sugar and that made them even better! Good stuff;0

This recipe was extremely easy to follow. I think it's really important to chill the dough, though. Mine became really hard and brittle about an hour after I baked them.  Also, I added a teaspoon of nutmeg to the the dough to add a bit of flavor.

This is a real easy recipe, and would be good to make with kids. They taste really good. I did some plain and some with a divet in the center with strawberry preserves.

I just made these yesterday and they are nearly gone.  I've always loved butter cookies so when I saw this recipe and all of the great reviews I had to try it and it's perfect.  My dough was a bit dry (could be our extremely dry climate here in WY) so I added about a tablespoon more butter and that helped.  I also accidentally browned a batch, but even those were delicious!

Not bad, but Mrs. Field's they ain't. If you're after a sweet cookie, sprinkle some sugar on them before baking, they're not very sweet on their own.

These cookies were really good.  The dough really stuck to my hands but I don't think they chilled long enough.  I put colored suger on them and they were even better I think.   The best I have made so far... Thanks :-)

I made these to bring to Thanksgiving and they went over well. The kids especially loved them! For my own taste I found them a little too crisp but with added cinnamon and decorative sugars they're pretty, quick and tasty. I'd use this receipe again. Thanks!

Excellent taste.  My family inhaled them.  The dough got a little hard for my 8-year-old to mix. The chilling time gave it the 4 stars in the quickness rating. Otherwise, it's a keeper!

Rolled dough into balls and then rolled in sugar(so the stamp wouldn't stick) and then stamped it with cookie stamp. Cookies looked and tasted good and dough was even easy for my 3 yr old to handle.

This was one of the vaguest recipes I have ever come across. White sugar? What kind of white sugar?! And is it 2 and 2/3 cups flour or 2- 2/3 cups flour?! Butter too, salted or unsalted? The cook time was way too hot. I did 350 for 9 and half minutes. Perfect. You should me more specific when it comes to ingredients and directions.

This is a great recipe you can do lots with.  I've baked for over 50 yrs so I'm not afraid to try different things.  I doubled the recipe and added an 8oz block of cream cheese and beat it up with the butter and sugar because we like soft cookies.  The cookies came out fantastic, soft,  and held up great in the oven.  Because of Christmas I put sprinkles on top before baking, but you can do a lot with these.  Don't be afraid to get creative.  Just remember to keep the dough cold.  While baking some I kept the rest in the fridge until I was ready for it.

I made this as directed ingredient-wise. I lowered the oven temp to about 375°F and baked between 7 to 8 min. I did not refrigerate the dough as I used a cookie press. I also used the frosting attachment and made rosettes that came out nicely.

These are not a sugary sweet cookie, like chocolate chip; these are cookies to have with coffee, tea, or milk for a slightly sweet treat. Essentially, these are perfect for fika (or maybe not, as you may unknowingly eat all of them while talking).

If you want a sweeter cookie, try increasing the sugar or add icing.

Overall, I will be making these again.

Very Good! I would suggest letting them cool more after baking if they feel a little soft when they are done. They will harden, and add a nice little snap. 
(Don't pay attention to my oven its a mess)

Doubled the recipe and added some almond extract. I thought they would be crunchier like the Danish butter cookies you get in the round tin. Instead they had a crust on the outside and soft on the inside, but they got rave reviews all around so well-deserved 5 stars!

Super easy recipe!  I made them exactly to the recipe for one batch.  The second batch, I used almond extract instead of vanilla and added 1 tbsp of seedless raspberry jam! They turned just as amazing as the vanilla butter cookies!

I was visiting my mother and did not have a cookie press.  So I rolled in wax paper to refrigerate.  Then sliced and decorated before baking.  I slice them on the thin side.

I made recipe exactly as written and cookies were very bland. I add more sugar & vanilla to  remainder of the batch. It was better but still not impressed.

Love this recipe.  Added a tsp. of lemon extract for more flavor.  Be sure to cream butter and sugar well .  

I did chill a little.  I pressed out rounded balls with my hands to make a thin crispy cookie.

What went wrong??? I followed the recipe to the T. They were very dry and not sweet enough, you could taste the flour. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and feel it was mixed enough. I chilled the dough overnight along with the cookie sheet. I’m baffled and sad, I was hoping to find a good butter cookie recipe.

Turned out great! I rolled into balls,flatten slightly with hand and put sugar on top. I finished flattening with bottom of glass. Made them a little sweeter but not to sweet, I also used Almond extract instead of vanilla just because I love Almond. Any flavor I think would be delicious.

Made it exactly as the recipe stated however I took the advice of another reviewer and put the temperature down to 350, baked them 8-9 minutes. I prefer my cookies just slightly chewy. Very easy!  Make sure to wip the butter and the sugar until it's light and fluffy then add the other ingredients.  When I first started mixing in the flour I thought oh my god it's so choppy but if you continue to work to mixture it does become creamy. Also read at least 10 reviews before you decide to make them. Lots of great ideas!

Sweet and simple cookies that are easy to bake for beginners.  I substituted white sugar with brown and they turned out just fine.   I don't like to get my hands too messy so I rolled the dough into a small long log then left them in the fridge overnight.  I took the dough out in the morning and  cut them into 1 inch cookies. I also added a bit of cinnamon powder right before putting them in the oven. 

Baked with a conventional oven @ 400 F for 20 mins then turned it off and let it sit for another 10 to make them just right.
I find the cookies a little bit on the sweet side and will use 3/4 cups of sugar instead.  This is just my personal preference.

Made exactly according to the direction, with the exception of adding some dried rosemary and some lemon extract. I chilled the dough for about 1/2 hour, then rolled and cut out with a small jar. Cooked 6 minutes until the edges were just brown. These cookies are fantastic! I'm waiting for them to cool to know how the final texture turned out, but the warm ones I couldn't help eating have been delicious!

Needs more butter in the recipe! Too stiff for cookie press.  Kept a great shape but even with reducing the cooking time the cookies are way too hard.  They softened a bit the next day but not much.  The flavor was excellent, just not a success for cookie press.

I used a cookie press for this dough. Then I melted semi-sweet chocolate and piped it on the back of a cookie, and pressed another cookie onto it. Better then Milanos.

It was easy enough to make and it was my first attempt ever at baking cookies and they were a succes. The 'hardest' part for me was being sure about the amounts (cup to grams, tablespoon, teaspoons etc.).

I did only add 2ml of vanille extract because when I calculated the conversion from teaspoons it amounted into 10ml and that seemed way to much considering it's rather strong.

This was a simple and very easy to make butter cookie.  I didn't change anything in the recipe other than to sprinkle with powdered sugar because it was not an overly sweet cookie.  I roll out the dough and use a gingerbread man cookie cutter.  During the holidays I bake and wrap cookies in funky packages for my coworkers since it's easy and inexpensive to hand out for large amounts of people.  I paired this in a package with a gingerbread man cookie.  But the "Butter" cookies definitely got the rave reviews!

OMG, so good! With the first batch, they were burned on the bottom. So the next batch, I flipped about 3 minuted before I took them out and they were much less burnt. They're not a very pretty cookie when you do that. (They kind of look like pancakes.) But I think they taste a lot better.  I brought them to my dorm floor meeting and they were totally gone by the end!

This recipe is great! Since I don't have a lunch period at school, I make these. People ask me for these cookies, and they think that I bought them because of how tasty they are! I didn't chill the dough, and it came out great. Also, I added one extra egg. A must-make.

These are Awesome. No need to refrigerate and to make them better looking use the bottom of a cup to flatten them a little. They taste amazing, this is a keeper.

I just finished these cookies. They are very delicious, but next time I'll reduce the sugar, cause they were very sweet.

I added in another tablespoon of butter and a *pinch* more salt my second time making these; holy !@#$@#---amaaazing! Even better than the original recipe here! These are super buttery, with soft insides and crispy edges. Perfect.

I didn't even go through the trouble of putting the dough in the fridge to cool. Supposedly, you're supposed to do that to enhance the flavor. I think the added ingredients did the trick without having to chill the dough.

Caveat: Do not leave these in the oven for longer than the cook-time, they will transform into cake-bricks.

The recipe is awesome. I made a double batch rolled into 3'  diameter logs in wax paper and put in the fridge. Sliced and baked later. Dipped them in dark chocolate and sprinkled with sea salt crystals. Came in 2nd place at the annual Cookie exchange....great recipe.

I don't usually write a review, but I did because I was really unhappy with this recipe.  I cook and bake all the time, but I didn't understand the recipe.  I never read the part beside the picture (and it has never been an issue until now) and maybe that's why it didn't make sense because that's where you told us how to prepare the cookies.  I found the dough was really crumbly and hard to make into a log.  When the recipe said "press dough out onto ungreased cookie sheet" it sounds like you dump the dough into the cookie sheet and make a sheet which perhaps you cut later, yet it looks like you pressed it down with a fork in the picture.  Or is that the cookie press, which probably would have worked better?  I found the cookies not very buttery, hard and bland.   :(
I know it sounds like I'm stupid, but honestly I didn't find this recipe as easy as it looked and the end result was very disappointing.

I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't chill the dough, and they worked perfectly in my cookie press.  These taste very much like the Danish butter cookies in the tins.  We topped them with colored sugar and sprinkles before baking.  Delicious!

This came out absolutely amazing.  I am not a baker; I'm timid when it comes to tweaking recipes.  After reading the reviews, I tried the following:  I substituted 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white for the 1 cup sugar part; I only used 2 1/2 cups of flour; and I added a teaspoon of lemon extract.  These are delicious. They don't need any additional sugar on top; they are light (I baked them for 8 minutes at 400 degrees).  I will certainly make these again!

I had to modify the recipe for allergies (eggs and dairy). I used Soy-free Earth Balance for the butter and cornstarch and water for the egg. They came out a bit soft, but to be expected with substitutions. I'll have to keep tweaking this to be able to roll them. They taste great though! Turned these into thumbprint cookies and some with sprinkles! The family loves them!

Yes, I tried this recipe and I liked it.  The recipe was easy to prepare and bake. The taste was light and fluffy and not too sweet. I was apprehensive about trying this recipe because it did not require baking soda, so I wonder how would it rise without that type of key ingredient, but it did so very well. PS I used margarine instead of butter. You dont have to wait an hour for it to chill and I used a mixer to combine all ingredients thoroughly. miss1young

I love these cookies.  I cut the flour to 2 1/2 cups and make drop cookies (no need to chill).  The last batch I made, I left out the vanilla and added 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest.  They're wonderful!  Very delicate lemon flavor.

I tried this recipe and changed a few things.....I put lemon extract in the mix, and I rolled the cookies in little balls and pressed holes in them and filled them with raspberry fruit spread. It was good!!!!

From the reviews I expected the Christmas tin style buttery cookies.  What I got was ok, but was not sweet at all, very weak butter taste, and nowhere near the flavor I can get in the tins.

These were more like what we used to call "tea biscuits".   The wife loved them and insists I make them again, but MY search for a good butter cookie continues.

Fantastic recipe just the way it is! I am starting a Wilton Method of Cake Decorating class and Lesson 1 asks us to bring 6 plain flat cookies with a smooth top surface (e.g. sugar or butter cookie). I "googled" and found this recipe....it is perfect. I followed the ingredient list and method exactly. These are delicious, buttery and perfectly smooth for decorating. Hints: Preheat your oven for 1/2 hour. Roll out dough or slice to a scant 1/4". Do a test cookie as all ovens and cookie sheets bake differently. Watch closely and remove from oven when slightly browned around edges. Mine took 7 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was great. It delivered exactly what I wanted: plain, butter cookies. I rolled up the dough out and used a cookie cutter. It does help to chill them for a few minutes before baking. I also added a healthy coating of cinnamon sugar on top to add a little something extra. It was great!

I'm giving it a 5. Simple ingredients and seems like lots of reviewers love it. I'll do it now; and follow the instructions.

The (negative) reviews are confusing and not helpful at all.

Tripled the recipe and chilled overnight (not recommended). Used a powdered sugar/milk combination for frosting and decorated. Some of the yummiest cookies ever. The frosting made them extra sweet and they were beautiful for all types of Christmas deocrations. However, we tripled the recipe and got about 3 dozen cookies. We rolled out the dough and used Christmas cookie cutter shapes, so cookies were larger. Honestly, we are not dessert or cookie people, and these were awesome.

These came out perfect exactly how they are.  Wonderful with coffee.  I dipped them halfway in semi-sweet chocolate and sprinkled them with chopped walnuts.  They were VERY pretty and absolutely delicious.

This was a decent recipe.  I did make one mistake...I chilled the dough overnight and then I didn't have time to wait for it to thaw, so I kneaded the dough and rolled it out and used cookie cutters.  They were pretty good!

My children absolutely love this recipe. We have made it the last 2 Christmas's and they love decorating them, they especially love eating them. They practically melt in your mouth.

I did not care for this recipe.  Just an FYI...the best butter cookie does not contain egg.  The cookie needs to taste just as it says; buttery.

Not sweet enough.  Next time I will sparkle sugar on top.
