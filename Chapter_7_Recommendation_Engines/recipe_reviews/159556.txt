I also had trouble getting a syrup consistency.  The flavor is pretty good.  The nutmeg is a little overpowering, so next time, I will not add as much.

This recipe concept was exactly what I was looking for to add color to my fall fruit tart. The problem is, it didn't quite turn to syrup and based on the previous reviews. I've made syrups before wish sugar but they usually contain less liquid from the beginning. That might be the key. Otherwise, the flavor is perfect.

This has great flavor, but it didn't quite set up as a syrup. I'm pretty sure that was user error, though--my brown sugar was hard as a brick, so I had trouble  measuring the pieces I sawed off; I just added till I thought it was sweet enough, and I don't think I used the full amount. I added some fresh grape juice to the pomegranate (about 15 grapes to six poms), which may have cut the tartness a bit, and I used fresh ginger. Nice, spicy flavor!

SOOO good! I added more raw sugar. I had people ask for the recipe.
