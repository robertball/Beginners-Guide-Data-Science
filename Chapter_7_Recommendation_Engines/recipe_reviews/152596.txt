Definitely fast and good.  Not GREAT but an easy cake to make.  Couldn't find strawberry cool whip anywhere so I pureed frozen strawberries and folded them into regular whipped cream.  A little runny but still had the strawberry taste and with the strawberries sliced on top it was a hit.  Thanks.

The topping was good, but i don't know what I did wrong. I even made it a second time when the first turned out dry and nasty.

Wonderful, I made this for a cooking project and served to my friends. Everyone loved it and it was gone before the night was over.

Great cake! It definitely was easy and tasted like it was from the box! The best cake from scratch I have made yet.
