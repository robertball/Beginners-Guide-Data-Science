This recipe came out OUTSTANDING. I marinated chicken thighs and drumsticks overnight in a ziploc bag. After grilling the chicken under medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, I brushed on  a little Hoisin to finish.  Highly recommended.

This was yummy yummy! I had boneless chicken breast on hand and they worked wonderfully. Also I had already marinated  them in Italian Dressing for about 2 hrs so I drained that off and added the Hoisin sauce for 2 more hrs of marinating and they turned out so good!

Great idea! My luck with bone-in chicken on the grill is really awful, so I just barely let my chicken kiss the grill and then moved it to the oven on 325 convection for 40 minutes. Turned out perfect, juicy and yummy. Thanks!

I always love it when a simple easy recipe turns out well.  This created a very tasty, moist piece of chicken.  I used 4 boneless skinless breasts and 4 bone in skin on thighs.  My breast was moist and I was informed that the thighs turned out well also. I marinated these on Friday morning with the intention of cooking them that evening...well a better offer came up so I ended up cooking them tonight.  Just doesn't get any easier than this. Thanks for the recipe.

Simple & the taste was nice.  I used two bottles of Hoisin sauce.  One for marinating and the other for basting.  Thanks

Since it’s November where I live, it’s too cold out for me to BBQ the chicken.  So, I roasted it instead for 40 minutes at 375 degrees.  I even went so far as to use both boneless and boned chicken thighs.  It was absolutely perfectly cooked!

GOOD EASY. I had a large package of fresh chicken boneless breasts. I followed others advice and marinated 2 1/2 hrs in Italian dressing drained rinced out bag and put back for 2 hrs in Hoisin Sauce. Baked 2 for dinner . Divided the rest into 2 separate packages and froze, ready for fast grilling dinner this summer.  4 stars because I added something that would change it.

I made chicken thighs using this recipe. I also baked them at 350 degrees for about 50 minutes. They turned out well. I served them alongside steamed white rice, and Restaurant Style Egg Drop Soup from this site. My husband and son really liked them, but my daughter did not. I thought they were pretty good. In all fairness, these are probably better grilled as the recipe states to do, unfortunately, baking them was my only option.

I needed to pull dinner together at the last minute and was looking for something to do with chicken breasts on the grill. This is simple and straight forward, no surprises. I do prefer to add some cider vinegar and a touch of honey to the marinade portion. Nice and easy! Thanks!
