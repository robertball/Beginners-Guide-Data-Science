This sounds lovely. We love pork and my fella is mad about celery so this sounds ideal. I think when i add the Celrey, onion etc at this stage im thinking of adding a sliced red pepper for colour and an exrea veg. I will definetly be making this and will be back to review it.

I love celery and this recipe with the thyme was awesome....it just was perfect...the flavor, consistency and presentation was great...and to serve it on rice was just what it needed....will make it again...easily could substitute chicken for the pork...

Very good! I didn't have thyme, and I used cream of mushroom. This is something I will be cooking often.

This dish was nice and easy.  I didn't have cream of celery so I also used cream of mushroom soup.  I served it over farro instead of rice and it was delicious.  The pork loin was so tender.  I will make it again.
