Hi, I wrote this recipe. A little was lost in translation. You can used fresh OR canned peaches, cut in bite size pieces. Enjoy!

I did a few things a little diffently though. I added the juice from the peaches and omitted the red pepper flakes, instead everyone in my family could spice to taste with a little cayenne pepper.

Excellent! Not too spicy and the flavors are well balanced! Next time I'll try using fresh basil so I don't get the texture of the dried in each bite.

Not a bad dinner, liked the flavors of the chicken, but it definitely needed more spice. Try adding 1/2 Tbsp. Sriracha sauce, gives it the kick it needs.

Absolutely fantastic! I really enjoyed this dish. It was extremely flavorful; the spiciness and sweetness complimented eachother nicely without one overpowering the other. I followed the recipe as written and was very pleased with the result. Thanks Sunny! â™¥

We were pleasantly surprised with the taste of this dish. Easy to prepare and easy to control the level of spice with the red pepper flakes. Went well over rice.

In my 14 years of marriage, there have been two recipes I've tried that my husband and I have declared inedible. This was one of them. We are not picky eaters by any means, and enjoy strongly flavoured dishes of all ethnicities. Thought perhaps it would taste better than it smelled. Not so. Thankfully I tasted it before pouring it over the chicken, so I was able to salvage something for supper.

Although I love the CONCEPT of this recipe with the sweet, spicy and savory, it just didn't have the right balance of flavors. I found the OJ very overpowering and couldn't really distinguish the rest of the flavors.  We served over noodles and the texture was nice, but we won't be making this again.  I'd love to say it was good enough to try and tweak to my liking, but it just wasn't.

I had really high hopes for this recipe.  I am not sure what was missing but there was something missing for us.  I expected this to be more peachy & spicey too.  A solid 4 stars.  But next time I will play with the sauce to bump it up a bit.

Perfect. The nutmeg is different than what I usually put in my recipes, and my children value the variety.

I was searching for something new to make for my five year anniversary dinner for my husband and I. I knew I wanted to use chicken and peaches and this recipe ended up being absolutely perfect. I didn't have nutmeg so I used some allspice and cinnamon. The juice mixture was a little runny b/c I didn't have the full amount of chicken. But it didn't matter. My husband took one bite and couldn't even speak. He kept saying how good it was....really good! I served it over corkscrew pasta. And I used fresh basil instead of dried. Thanks for the great recipe!

As a mom cooking meals from scratch at home and on a fixed income, this recipe is great! I made it with rigatoni and the canned peaches that we get from food assistance.  Really easy and aside from the pepper flakes I had everything all ready on hand. Gave it 5 stars, because we really enjoyed it and its economical!

I have tried this recipe 2 times, the first I changed nothing and decided that it need something to give it a little kick so on the second try I added 2 Tbsps. of India curry powder and that gave it what I was looking for, Thanks for sharing, you should try the curry.

WOWW!  Thanks, SunnyByrd for this rec; Excellent flavor combinations with just the right spiciness.  Used frozen peaches and added just a bit of garam masala as the chicken finished cooking in the sauce.  Will be make this alot more.  Thoroughly enjoyed this one.

I was looking for something different this week and found this recipe.  All I can say is WOW!  What flavor.  I was skeptical about the sauce combination with nutmeg and basil?  But again, WOW.  It is now a sure favorite of our family.  Thanks for sharing this!

Great recipe. I used balsamic vinegar which turned it kinda dark, but the flavor was delicious. I would use less red pepper next time b/c it was way to spicy for my kids.

I made this almost to a tee, hubby raved about it, I thought it was so so. Stupid but, the phrase "bite sized pieces" reminds me of kiddie fare so I cooked large slices of the chicken breasts, kind of like medallions. Seemed like too much basil the first night but leftovers were better. Not sure peaches really go with chicken though. The red pepper flakes spice really jazzed it up, I liked that, chicken is so often bland. I served it with brown rice for a healthier version.

Surprisingly good!  I did make a few changes:  used fresh peaches because I had them, omitted the flour and cooked the chicken in a little olive oil, and used some cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit in the last few minutes of cooking.  Great served over brown rice!

Made this dutch oven style.  Nice flavor, recipe doesn't stated over noodles, but that is how it was served.  Only changes I would make is onions and peaches added at the last 15 minutes, peaches were pretty mush after simmering so long.

Daughter and I cooked this one up. Fantastic dish. Wonder how it would taste with a different type of fruit. Will have to experiement with it more next time. Recipe was on the money for taste and consistancy. Definitely staying in my once a month meal file.

This recipe is great.  You can regulate the heat by the amount of red pepper flakes you use. I substituted cilantro for basil and omitted the nutmeg. My family loved it!

I cooked this with my hubby last week.  We tasted a bit of the sauce before mixing it with the chicken and thought "uh-oh", but went ahead and finished it off and we both LOVED it.  Will make it again for sure!

I made this exactly as written, although I did increase the brown sugar from 2 tablespoons to 4 tablespoons. I will make this again, but I will substitute 4 peeled (dip in boiling water) peaches, and vastly reduced spices: 1/2 teapoon basil, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon nutmeg in addition to increasing brown sugar. If desired, mix 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water, add to the final product, and cook another minute or two until sauce is slightly thickened and glossy.

Oh, yeah!  Been thinking about this recipe since I added it to my recipe box and it did not disappoint.  Doubled the chile flakes, used a frozen basil cube, and added a chopped onion.  So good!  In the summer I'm going to try a deconstructed version--sauce without peaches, grilled chicken breast, and grllled fresh peaches over egg noodles.

Its been a very long time since I have been cooking.  This recipe came to me via ALLRECIPES Email.  It enticed me back into the kitchen to cook for my husband as we are recent empty nesters.  We both LOVED IT!  He said, "perfect amount of heat and sweet" & "chicken was so moist and tender".  I followed the recipe to a T. (measured EVERYTHING!!)  However, I only used one gargantuan chicken breast, sliced into 4 long diagonal strips.  I served it, as suggested, with noodles I found in my cupboard (wide, egg noodles).  Husband would have rather had linguine.  THAT has NOTHING to do with this recipe though. :-)  Definitely something I will make again.  THAT says ALOT!  So excited that I finally NAILED a recipe! thanks

My husband and I found this recipe very good.I didn't have nutmeg so used cinnamon after checking a site for substitutions for it.I held back on the red pepper but wish I'd used a bit more it needs that kick.Add the peaches toward the end .I used frozen and felt they didn't need to be so mushy and that's what I ended up with.I'm on a lower salt diet so all the flavors in this made up for no salt added.All and all healthy I used a George foreman grill for the chicken and no butter.Served with Jasmine rice green beans with almonds.

I made this recipe just tonight...I enjoyed it very much, but I did change it up a bit. First I added the juice from peaches to make more sauce, I also added 2 KNORR CHICKEN bouillon cubes to make it more flavorful, I chopped 2 green onion stalks for garnish

Delicious! My boyfriend asked me for a chicken dish with peaches, and I didn't know what on Earth I would make. The flavors meld so well together. We both had thirds.

Very good recipe.  Love peaches and tired of always cooking chicken with tomatoes.  I used ginger & curry instead of the basil and nutmeg because I like these flavors.  Turned out great.

A very interesting dish for sure and might involve an acquired taste. It is unusual in the use of nutmeg and peaches but it all turned out pretty well. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used rice flour instead of all-purpose flour to coate the chicken and did not use butter (used canola oil instead). Overall a wonderful dish and I think I will serve it over broad noodles the next time I make it. Thank you for this unusual but good tasting recipe.

PERFECT amount of spice-to-sweet, even for someone like me who doesn't like spicy! Used the reserved peach juice instead of OJ since that's what we had, and that turned out just as yummy!

Amazing meal.  I made a few small changes: I omitted the flour and cooked the chicken in an olive oil non-stick spray, rather than butter.  I also used orange juice with mango and a bit of the syrup from the canned peaches.  Served it with some whole wheat pasta and spinach and it was delicious.  My GF and I loved the combination of the subtle spiciness of the red pepper with the sweetness of the peaches.  I'm definitely keeping this one to make again.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

My family all thought this chicken dish was great!  So different from what I normally prepare--my husband said oven fried chicken was getting a little tired.  He doesn't care for peaches but I told him to just try it!  He ate all the chicken and said it was "not bad", which is a high compliment from my picky dh! I will cut down to 1/4 tsp red pepper next time as it was a little on the spicy side for my kids.

I didn't use as much orange juice and nutmeg as the recipe called for. After I made the "sauce" I put it with thighs and breasts in the crockpot for 4 hours on high. At the end, I took off some juice and mixed it with corn starch to thicken it up. This was REALLY good. Not as overwhelming flavors as I expected.

I made this with about six fresh peaches.  It came out so well.  The only thing I wasn't happy about was the fact there were no leftovers!!!  Next time I'll triple the recipe -- that way no matter how much people like it I should have some for the next day!!!

We tried this recipe and really wanted to like it, but alas it was not to be. The aroma was strange; couldn't quite figure out what spice/herb should have been added or left out, but adjustments needed to be made. We'll finish the batch w made, but probably won't make it again.

My family really enjoyed this. My only complaint about it is that the sauce was super watery for me. I'll definitely add some corn starch next time. But all the flavors worked really well together, and even tasted great poured over the steamed broccoli I made to go with it.

Followed the recipe but used the peach juice with the OJ.  The end result was a flavour that reminded me of a sweet chilli sauce.  It was an easy recipe to prepare.

I tried this recipe last night and it was a big hit! I should have made rice to go with it but I made angel hair pasta and broccoli instead.  It was really delicious and this is going to become one of my regular meals.  You can change it up to suit your taste but this was flavorful and just plain Yummy!

We did not like this recipe at all. It has a weird combination of spices and a strange taste to it.  Will not make again.  I was so disappointed because I thought it might be a great recipe. Recipe made as originally written--no changes were made.

I made this recipe tonight. I always read a receipt and then switch it up a bit. I used fresh peaches and added some fresh mango and shallots along with the other ingredients in the receipt  I boiled this for a bit to cook the fruit. Then I pureed a little over half of it  Used chili peppers and that spiced it up a little too much so I added a can of condensed milk. Cooked the chicken first . Then added it to the sauce and simmered for about 20 minutes. I served this over OrAnge basmati rice steamed some veggies made a salad and it was all a terrific hit!!  I've been asked to make it again!!

Edible but will not make again. Maybe the nutmeg should be left out. It is definetly missing something.

I loved it.  Made it as written but added a little corn starch to the flour.  I served it over wide noodles and even had the little left overs for my lunch the next day.  I can see how you could adapt this for other fruit and seasonings.
