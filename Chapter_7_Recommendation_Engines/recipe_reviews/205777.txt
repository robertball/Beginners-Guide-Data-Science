This is a great soup!!  I am not a great black bean fan so I soaked some Northern beans overnight and used them instead.  I also used Swanson's beef broth (26 oz) and added 6 oz of sherry to make up the one quart of beef broth the recipe called for.  I still added the red wine.  I cooked the pasta and rice separtately so it wouldn't get mushy if left in the soup.  My family loved this recipe and rest assured, I will be making this through out the chilly months to come.

I made the recipe as stated. This recipe was time consuming, but it was very tasty.  Leftovers the next day were even better.  I would suggest waiting a day for the full flavor. The cabbage gave it a great taste. I wasn't crazy about the black beans but my husband liked them. I would also suggest waiting until about 15 minutes before the soup is ready to add the macaroni that way it will not get starchy.

OUTSTANDING!  This is a GREAT soup!  We use left-over prime rib scraps and bones from Christmas dinner and followed this recipe (for the most part).  I had a 10 bean dry mix with barley so I use 2 cups of that instead of the 1/4 cup amounts of beans/rice/macaroni.  We did follow the "core" recipe exactly!  The beef broth with the crushed tomato puree and the cup of red wine made a superb broth! I believe that this recipe would be very "forgiving" if you made some small substitutions, just don't mess with the broth...it is perfection!

Way to go Jack!  I was making soups having made beef stock yesterday and came here to my favorite site for ideas.  The best soup recipes do not come from bullion cubes, packaged vegetables or bottles of juice.  I skimmed most of the fat off my stock then I could add butter without guilt!  Way to Rock It Grandma!

This is a great recipe for cold days.  I added extra meat.  I think you could pretty much make any substitutions you want and it would be fine.

Delicous! I cooked 8 oz. noodles separately and then ladled the broth & carrots over for my 3 & 5 year olds. Also, added carrots, cabbage& potato for last 35 minutes, til al dente.

If you dislike red wine, do NOT add.  The stock was ok up until the wine was added.  Even after adding sugar, condensed tomato soup, salt...nothing could cover the red wine flavor.

I wish I could say that I liked this soup, but I cant. I even tweaked the recipe with the tips provided by highest rated review (i.e. removed black beans) posters. But the dozen or so people who ate this soup all pretty much agreed with the following: -Something was missing, a spice, an ingredient, something -The wine was not necessary, in fact some said it took away from the taste -Lack substance, with all the ingredients provided, it was pretty bland. Needless to say, I will be removing this recipe from my collection.

Not bad, the diverse ingredients kept things interesting but it wasn't the best beef stew I've ever had. I used venison tenderloin plus beef bones and it turned out too "gamey" tasting. If I make it again, I'd add more noodles, skip the red wine and tomatoes, and use regular beef tenderloin.

OK, so my photo doesn´t match the recipe title. I started out with this recipe in mind but I also wanted to use what I had on hand. It turned out great with chicken, bay leaf, thyme, sweet potatoes, carrots, squash, two types of beans, green pepper, cabbage, onion, garlic, celery, salt and pepper. I had the red wine but I think that´s best saved for when I repeat this recipe with beef. This is a very forgiving recipe. Thanks Jack; I´ll try this again and follow the ingredients better next time.

This soup was pretty good but lacks some ingredient that keeps it from being WOW.  It's just a tad bland.  Possibly adding garlic or increasing the spice.  Not sure.

This soup is great! The only two things I did differently was I used baby carrots and omitted the rice (too much starch). Will def make again!!

Very tasty recipe. Next time I will add the rice, pasta, and split peas about 20-30 minutes before serving.

Overall I think this was a good recipe and had a good flavor.  Unfortunately I could not find any beef stock bones at the time, so I substituted most of the water for more beef stock, a little vegetable stock, and a little water.  It came out well like this.

The only thing I would do different is to cook the beans and peas longer.  Dry beans and peas take a long time to soften up.  Even after cooking for an hour, they were still much too hard, and almost had an uncooked texture.  I would recommend putting these in at the beginning and cooking throughout for the full 4 hours instead of only the last hour.

Some reviewers commented that their noodles became too starchy in an hour.  I used whole grain noodles, and after cooking at medium low for the full hour, they were soft but still intact.  If you use white flour noodles, you may want to add these closer to the end as others recommended.
