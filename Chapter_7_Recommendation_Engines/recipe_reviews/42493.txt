I made these as a surprise for my son's birthday breakfast.  As an added benefit, the whole family got an early morning gift.  These were wonderful.  The combination of chocolate chip pancakes and strawberries tasted great.  I mean really, can you ever go wrong with chocolate and strawberries?

This earned high reviews from my eight year old, who has chocolate chip pancakes every Sunday morning.  I heard, "These are good!  We should have these more often!"  We will!  Probably even better if made with full fat chocolate milk in a bottle as opposed to fat free milk with syrup.  Make a dbl batch and freeze to toast in the toaster on a school morning for a fast treat.

These were really tasty! I did make some changes though, due to what I had on hand...I used self rising flour so I omitted the salt and baking powder, I used some buttermilk and a squirt or chocolate syrup for the chocolate milk, and I just eyeballed the chocolate chips, so I probably used more than called for. I just topped these with a dusting of powdered sugar and they were delish! Thanks!

I felt the texture and flavor was really off.  I ended up having to add some more flour as well because it was so thin they were more like crepes.  None of my family finished their helpings...including chocolate loving 3 and 5 year old boys.

I just made these for my son's birthday breakfast. He gave it a thumbs up and ate them all. I ate one also but I couldn't tell you what they tasted like, because I'm sick and can't smell or taste anything. However, the batter was perfect, the color and consitency were great. Will make again. (We skipped the fruit because my son doesn't care for either strawberries or blueberries) We used Oberweis chocolate milk, the best one out there!

I give this 4 stars merely because I felt that the pancakes fluffed up too much while cooking. I decreased the amount of baking powder by 1/2-1 tsp. the second time, and the pancakes came out great. These were rich and moist! A new family pancake fave! Skip the syrup. All you need is some strawberries (and maybe a little whipped cream). Also, try with buttermilk.

I used buttermilk and just cut back a bit so I could add a couple squirts of chocolate syrup. I used whole wheat flour as well. I wisked together the dry ingredients, then the wet and I gently stirred them together. When I made the pancakes, I sprinkled the chips on top of the batter after spooning it on the griddle. My kids flipped for these. I don't know about eight servings. My kids and I ate every bit. For me, this made nine medium pancakes.

Delicious!  I used regular choco chips and blended them down.  Family favorite! Also, one time I used regular milk instead of the choco milk and they were good too - but not as good as the original!

So good and fluffy and very filling. I made my pancakes bigger then the 1/4 a cup about a 1/2 cup or so and my family (one of which was a 16 year old boy) could only eat one pancake a piece.

I would have to say these are my favorite EVER!! Super amazing and the chocolate milk is a great idea instead of regular milk. The first time I used chocolate milk, the second time I didn't have coco mix so I just used plain milk. But deff better with chocolate milk!

Yum! When MrB is away, BB2 and I will play. He's been asking me to make these for a while so I finally did. I did find the batter a bit thin, so I added a little more flour to it. Also out of milk, so I made chocolate milk with half & half. I had to cook these at a slightly lower temp than I usually do pancakes or they would tend to burn - of course, as usual, by the time I was cooking the perfect pancake I was almost out of batter. We topped these with bananas, more chips, and maple syrup (so?).  All that wasn't quite sinful enough for us, so we had to have some bacon with it. Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy results! My alterations were 1.5 tsp baking powder instead, half whole and half white wheat, regular milk instead (didn't have chocolate,) and added walnuts!

The batter was too runny.  They were ok, but not light and fluffy like other pancake recipes I've tried.  My chips burned :-(

I just made this and they were great. I was looking for a chocolate pancake recipe and found this. I had to make chocolate milk with cocoa powder because we were out of syrup, but they still turned out great. I also used white chocolate chips and sprinkled them in the batter on the griddle for more even distribution. I'll be making them again for sure.

These are the best chocolate chip pancakes I have ever made! My husbands and kids loved them and I will probably be making them once a week! I followed the recipe exactly, using 1 tablespoon of chocolate syrup with a cup of milk.

I make pancakes almost every weekend for my boys and couldn't quite remember my regular chocolate chip recipe.  Saw this and modified it with what I remember from my usual:  1 1/2 cups flour instead of just 1, 2 Tblsp. brown sugar in place of white, and 2 Tblsp. melted butter instead of oil.  The boys said these were the best ever and ate them all!

Kids loved these. I thought that the use of chocolate milk would enhance the chocolate flavor more, but we couldn't really tell after they cooked.  Overall, we liked these and I am sure the kids will request them again.

Kids loved these pancakes. I didn't have chocolate milk so I used Ovaltine instead. Also I read the other reviews first and added a bit more flour to avoid the crepe effect. Kids gave the recipe five stars I give it four since I had to adjust the recipe a bit. Overall great recipe.

I must say that these pancakes are a family favorite.  Every Saturday morning we make pancakes and these have been requested over and over.  I have to triple the recipe because the kiddos eat them up so quickly.  They are great the next day too!

I made far more than 8 pancakes, but what I did with the leftovers I put in the fridge on a plate covered with Saran wrap, and then took them out and microwaved for about 45 seconds. Still the same great taste!

I didn't have chocolate milk so I used cocoa powder with milk instead. Tasting the batter I found it needed more sugar (this is my fault) so I added some sugar to taste. They came out great my brother and sister ask for them all the time

Very yummy. I thought I might be too chocolately because of the chocolate milk but you don't even know it's in there. I sprinkled them with powdered sugar. I didn't do the bananas and strawberries although I'm sure it's yummy that way. Definately next time.

Yum-O! I didn't have any chocolate milk, so I just made it with regular 1% milk, and they still tasted great! Would probably be amazing with chocolate milk! Thanks for the great recipe!

I am a Family & Consumer Sciences teacher and have made these as a demonstration on reading a recipe and measuring for my students.  I followed the recipe as written and they have turned out great each time.  (I make them for 5 classes in a row!)  They are a little curious about using chocolate milk in pancakes, but they LOVE them.  Thanks for a good, quick recipe.

The pancakes came out good, but a little bit more on the "crepe" side.  They were not too fluffy. Nevertheless, they were good, and with the addition of some sliced strawberries and syrup, they tasted great!

These were VERY good.  They are thinner than my Krusteaz mix and the single batch doesn't make near enough, but they are mildly sweet and tender and pretty.  For 8 of us, I needed a triple batch with each person getting 2-3 pancakes.

These were really good. My 10 year old daughter made these for Mothers Day breakfast. We skipped the berries and bananas and just used syrup and butter. Yum!

These were not that great.  The batter is super thin and spreads a lot, and there just isn't that much flavor without the chocolate chips.  The only thing I did differently was to sub half white whole wheat flour and to sprinkle the chips on top of each pancake rather than mixing them into the batter.  I don't think I would make these again.  I've reviewed another chocolate chip pancake recipe on this site that was sublime, and this just didn't come close in comparison.

Since I wanted to have a yummy breakfast today and had no boxed pancake ingredients on hand like normal, I was excited to make these w/ the ingredients I had on hand.  Really good. Cooked perfectly, and my 4 yr old and husband liked them a lot!

Fantastic, I used hot chocolate instead of chocolate milk. Still great next time I will try it with chocolate milk. My 5 year old ate these all day long.

Excellent and easy! My kids adored them. We sprinkled the chips on after pouring the batter, otherwise we made them exactly as directed (including the chocolate milk!) Perfect for a special breakfast.
