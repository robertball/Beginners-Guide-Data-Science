I needed a quick "something different" and I found it!! I love this recipe, so easy to make and delicious!!! I didn't use the olive oil, just light country crock to saute the onions and chicken, it is so wonderful, my kids love it too. Thanks so much, it will not be the last time I make this quick and awesome chili!!!

Used ground beef, added 1 tomato sauce and corn. 1/2 cup of water and put in crock pot. Was great. My family enjoyed as well. Def will make again. Will try chicken next time.

Grandma's Chicken & Black Bean Chili Haiku: "Change name to 'Kirkland.' Found this on their chicken can, but DANG it is good." I've actually made this recipe several times over the past few years and love it for its ease; only on my most recent batch (which I made a day in advance, and re-simmered in my dutch oven for 4 hrs. b4 serving w/ cheddar cheese, fritos, and plain Greek yogurt on top) did I notice that the attached recipe list on the cans of Kirkland chicken from Costco included an identical recipe. Hey, Grandma or Mr. or Mrs. Kirkland - your chili is great!

I was really disappointed.  Based on the reviews I thought it would be better.  Everyone is different though.  All 4 of us just thought it was ok, nothing great.  Maybe it will taste better tomorrow when it has sat overnight.  It was very easy to make.  I will say that.

This was excellent! I used frozen diced onion (and frozen diced bell peppers) b/c I was in a hurry. I did add small can of tomato sauce and since I didn't have chili seasoning, I used chili  powder. I also used some left over baked chicken from the night before. Quick and easy and the longer I simmered it, the better it tasted!

I'm surprised - everyone loved it but me. I didn't like the canned chicken, because I thought it lacked flavor. Guess I won't use my other complicated recipe if they all like this easy recipe just as much!

This was a very great chicken chili. The only changes I made was I added a can of kidney beans with the black beans and I used fresh chicken that we raised. I would definitely make this again.
