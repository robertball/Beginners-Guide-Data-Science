This is quick and easy. My family loved it and it was an easy snack to teach my son to make. I used 1oz of semi sweet chocolate chips and they worked perfectly. Half of my family threw it into the fridge to cool down and the others ate it warm.

This recipe was amazing. I LOVE chocolate, and we were out of baking chocolate, so I used chocolate chips. It worked perfectly with the chocolate chips substitution! Definitely making again.

The only thing I would change is the sugar amount to about a teaspoon more (this might have just been me, but it was a bit too bitter). Still delicious though!~

This was very good and easy to make.  I love that it makes a small portion.  I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate and it turned out great.  I made it another time with butterscotch chips and that was good too.  I like to add a tablespoon of butter at the end and a teaspoon of vanilla as it gives a richer texture and flavor.

Surprisingly good.  Had no chocolate, so I used cocoa powder and a little oil as the can suggested.  Stirred it all in a mug and microwaved in 30 second increments stirring in between until it got thick.  Ate it hot; who can wait for it to chill?

I prepared this with half and half and it was perfect. It took no time at all...just what my husband asked for after dinner. He was very pleasantly surprised. I was surprised by the creaminess. I did not have semisweet chocolate and substituted unsweetened chocolate (add 1 Tbs of sugar for each ounce of chocolate). I also added a splash of vanilla and a dab of butter to give it sheen.  Delish!!!

I love it!!   The consistency is great, make sure to stir all the lumps out when making it though. I didn't have any chocolate squares though so I used I/8 (1 ounce) of semi sweet chips and it was delicious!! Be careful when it comes out of the microwave, it's very hot.

This was delicious, however I had to make it slightly different, my microwave broke this morning so I did it over the stove top, which I find works better for puddings anyways. As well, I had no semisweet chocolate so I used cocoa powder. All in all it worked out fine, and was a good size. There were some clumps, but I think that's a me problem, not the recipes fault

So easy and so delicious! I had unsweetened chocolate, so I added an extra tablespoon of sugar. I also added about 1/16  Teaspoon of vanilla after taking it out of the microwave. A previous commenter said to pt a lid on. I did because there was a spill, but caught it on time.

Pretty good!  I didn't like the unsweetened chocolate with it, so I used semi-sweet chocolate morsels.

This is easy, quick, and turned out well.  Don't forget how quickly milk will boil out of its container though!  Keep a close eye on that stuff.

the flavor is great, and I love the portion size. I used chocolate chips. Although, the cornstarch clumped a little so next time I will add it to the chocolate chips before adding the milk. very good pudding though!

Pudding in a hurry without a box mix is just a dream come true, isn't it?  I use cocoa powder, so basically I can just make it any time I want.

I just tried it. Wonderful consistency and taste. I was skeptical at first, but it worked and now I am letting it sit in the fridge.

Made it exactly as written and it turned out! Ate it warm. The only thing I recommend is to use a good quality chocolate as that is basically all you taste. I used some generic chocolate chips which weren't amazing but that was my fault, not the recipe :) perfect for a quick craving!
