I made this last week for my family.  I pretty much followed the recipe .. but did make these changes:  used 1 lb of gr. venison and 1 lb gr. wild boar, as that is what the butcher stocks in packaged, 1 lb portions.  I used 1 lb sliced mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions and kept it out of the meat mixture - using it to top the burgers.  Did not do the butter-thing to the buns, just toasted them in the toaster.  This made enough patties for 3 dinner meals for us.  My family thoroughly enjoyed these burgers!  This is definitely being added to our monthly dinner rotation!

Yummy burger, The yogurt does make it a little softer so take care and get a good crust on one side before you flip it. The sauce is nice and paired well with the dish.. I am a city girl who doesnt have access to fresh meat or a grinder so I used store bought ground pork and ground venison...
