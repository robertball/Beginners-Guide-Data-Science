I did do the sour cream or cheese.  But I added ketchup for color.

This is so easy and I loved it! I added paprika to this on top of noodles but kept everything else the same. I would make this again in a jiff.

A simple recipe we've went by for years thanks to McCormick (for those days you don't feel like doing it completely from scratch.) We always top it with cheddar cheese or sour cream. Delicious!

My Family and I LOVE this chili. It is the chili my mother always made for our family growing up. We made it exactly as is, then we just added whatever toppings we wanted...cheese, sour cream, etc...I tried so many other chili's but I always crave this one. No other chili can match the ease and flavor as this chili in my book.
