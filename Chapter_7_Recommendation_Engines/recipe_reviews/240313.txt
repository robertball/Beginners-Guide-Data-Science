We liked these! As written, IMO, there is waaaay too much butter for a 10 ounce can of biscuits. I only used about 5 tablespoons of butter and that was more than enough. Also, I only used about 1/2 cup blue cheese, and that seemed right for us. These were tasty, and hubby and I enjoyed them, I just think maybe the measurements are off with the butter. Thanks for sharing. :)

I agree that the butter amount seemed a little much but also I used the 7.5 oz can of pillsbury so it may be different for the grands or a larger can. I used 1 stick but stayed with 1cup of blue cheese. I also wanted them to be a little crispy/toastier so I set the oven for 425F and cooked for about 13 mins. Then I transferred to a baking sheet and spread them out and put them back for about 5 minutes. Perfect!
