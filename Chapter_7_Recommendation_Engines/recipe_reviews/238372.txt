I cooked for 2 mins on high in a dish with a lid , and it boiled over, splattering all over the walls of the microwave, even with a lid on it. I took it out of the oven, transferred it to a small saucepan, and finished it on top of the stove. Don’t know what happened here and I’m the first reviewer, so I don’t want to discourage others from trying. I don’t have a “mega-watt” microwave. I'm giving this 2 stars based solely on the taste and the fact that it was eaten.

I made it and it was lovely - I did not get as much as I thought but this was beside the point - beautiful colour and taste - will make it again - longing to try it in the winter from the imported strawberries which  are not as good as the Kent ones we get  -aim to try with raspberries - thank you for this recipe

This is my recipe: I use the large 8-cup Pyrex measuring cup with handle. Don’t walk away! If the mixture starts to bubble up too close to the top, pause the microwave for 10-20 seconds, then continue. At the end of the cooking time if the jam is too thin or watery, then it hasn’t cooked long enough. Continue to nuke at 30 second intervals until jam thickens. Hope this helps!

I made it the flavor is really good.  The only thing I wish that it was thicker.    Next time might add a little  Corn Starch to it.  The color is really pretty.   For what it makes it great for one or two people.   Going to try on a Biscuit with  Cream Cheese.  And can't wait to try on Vanilla Ice Cream.

This was awesome and very tasty!  I've made it twice now and will make it lots more.  it's so easy.  Great for topping an English muffin or vanilla ice cream.
It's important to put it in a larger bowl as it will boil over in a smaller one.

Quick and retains a mild tartness of the berries, not cloyingly sweet.

Wonderful taste! As others have said, place in the deepest microwave bowl you have or it will boil over. I used a piece of microwave cookware, and still had a huge boil over. To avoid the mess, I nuked for 2 minutes, then in one minute increments, and had no further problems. My microwave must be pretty powerful, as the berries were done in 6 minutes. My family loves this, so I will make it again.

Super simple and straightforward... But do use a LARGE bowl. Mine boiled over at the 6 minute mark. Didn't hurt anything , but I lost some jam goodness down the sides!
