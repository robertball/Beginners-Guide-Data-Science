I think this recipe is fantastic with one big alteration - add NO water.  It tastes great without it and it becomes way too watery with the water.  This is one of my staple dressings.

This dressing was the perfect complement to a salad of mixed spring greens & endive, chopped beets and feta cheese. Perfect balance of sweet, salty and bitter. Thanks, Falvor King!

This was really good. I only used 1/4 cup of water and it came out perfect.

Tastes good, but by no means is it creamy. Actually it's very watery. With 1/3 cup vinegar, 3/4 cup water and only 1/3 cup vegetable oil, can't imagine it can become creamy.

The celery seed was an interesting addition, but it was good.

This tasted good but it's very far from being thick and creamy......watery is more like it.  That said, I would probably make this again, but only when I'm dieting because it's only 57 calories per 1/8 cup serving, which is a very decent amount of dressing.  I'd love to give this more stars for taste, but I'm only giving it two because as written it's deceptive.  UPDATE:  I tried this again using a bit of xantham gum as a thickener (which I got in bulk at Winco) and that did the trick.  Fix the recipe and I'll give it more stars.

Seems that I forgot to mention the xanthan gum. This is meant to be a low calorie dressing made creamy by the xanthan gum. I emailed customer service and they made sure the recipe got corrected.

By all means, leave out the gum and water if you'd like to make a regular vinaigrette dressing.

Yummy! I left out the water and xantham gum, and cut the salt by half.  I didn't bother with the blender, just shook for a few minutes and then let it set overnight for the flavors to blend.  Sweet, tangy, and spicy.

Instead of using celery seed and regular salt, I added celery salt. I did not add xanthan gum and used a mix of sesame oil and grape seed oils. I added less water than it called for and think next time I will omit water and add avacado. Yum!
