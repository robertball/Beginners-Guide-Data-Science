I have never been a big fan of stroganoff due to the overwhelming sour cream taste the ones I've tried in the past have had. This recipe changed that for me. I'm not sure if it was the actual cooking method or the addition of tomato paste but the flavors were deep and the sour cream did not overpower. This was delicious! I was even more impressed with how well the NO Yolks noodles held their shape. This is comfort food at its finest and a recipe I will make often.

I had to add in some extra salt and pepper into the sauce to bring out the flavors, but this was really good.   I hadn't used sour cream for the cream of my sauce in my stroganoff before, but I will again.   I also added sweet red peppers, which I really like in stroganoff.  I prepped my noodles in a fry pan.   I added my noodles to the pan and just covered with cold water.   Then boiled until they were al dente.   I had seen this method on youtube.   It worked really good and meant that I was able to do this entire dish in one pan, which was a bonus.   I did have to rinse them again with hot water prior to serving.   I'm actually pretty impressed with the taste and texture of the NoYolk noodles.

I've made this twice, once as written and the other with modifications to suit my family's taste.. Both turned out great. It doesn't have an overwhelming sour cream taste, sauce is perfectly thick, and left overs taste just as good!

Very good!  I did leave out the tomato paste because I didn't have any on hand.   I added Worcestershire sauce instead.  I also used chicken broth instead of beef.    I changed the servings to 6 because of the size London broil I had.  Turned out great!

This was very good. I had some very good dried mushrooms that I rehydrated with red wine and beef broth. I added some of the liquid from the mushrooms into the beef broth. Excellent! I love the NoYolk Noodles. Their texture was perfect.

It was actually better the next day.  The flavors were richer. Even the meat seemed more tender.  
Easy recipe and my hubby really liked It too.

This recipe was so easy to make. The whole family loves it. The noodles didn't stick together which was fabulous. Next time I plan on using a bit more Paprika.

Made it as directed and the flavors were good but there was zero gravy.  Two things I'll change next time, first the beef must be cut into bite sized pieces!!!  Second, I'll double the amount of broth to create a lovely gravy.  

Oh, I did change one thing that I loved.  I didn't have an onion to dice so I threw in some pearl onions I had in the freezer.  They were great in it!

I’d never made stroganoff before but this recipe turned out beautifully. Just the right creaminess and the meat is tender.  I’ve made it several times now and upped the spices some for our tastes. It’s becoming a family favorite

My husband just loved this. I did make a few changes. I used strip steak because that was what I had in the freezer. Also I didn’t have any tomato paste so I used ketchup.  It came out wonderful. It would make a good dish  for company.

I made this today and I really did not care for it.  My husband who eats anything I put in front of him also said he didn't like it.   I should have added more spices and used a different type of meat other than flank.

I used green onion instead of a small onion, fast fry steak and regular egg noodles. It was a huge hit with my family and this recipe will be my go to for Stroganoff. It is easy and fairly quick. Delicious and recommend for everyone to try!

I only made this once and I did not care for the tomato paste. I will try this recipe again and probably tweak it by for sure leaving the tomato past out & go from there..

Great way to use London broil.  A bit time consuming but well worth it!  Comfort food at it's best!!!

I just got through cooking this and was a little disappointed in the flavor.  I added more garlic than said because we're a garlic lovers. I put 3 cloves in and i think it could've taken more or maybe marinating the beef in some spices for a couple hours would've been better. I'd make it again but adjust it first.

Didn't look like beef stroganoff at first, but it sure tastes like it. I used ground beef instead and it came out great, will make again.

The tomato paste and beef stick add a slight burgundy flavor that most recipes lack.  But cornstarch was required for thickening.

I made this according to the recipe minus the tomato paste. It was quick and easy but didn't have a lot of flavor. Next time I'll add some beef bouillon to the broth and double the garlic. I really liked the creaminess of it but I think with those changes, this will be awesome!

I made this just as listed.  I wouldn't make it again.  The taste was OK, but the way the meat was cooked left it kind of tough.  Next time I make stroganoff I'm going to find a recipe that utilizes a crock pot so the meat is much more tender.

My daughter has one dish that she loves to make everyone and that's beef stroganoff. Usually I use a combination of Betty Crocker and my dad's recipes, although this app hasn't done me wrong yet so I decided to try this one I found. First, the process was slightly different than we were used to but that wasn't a big deal. Second, the step where you combine the sour cream ingredients separately was odd due to the wine like aroma it gave off. And third, the taste was 'meh' at best. Everyone ate it and it was edible, however nowhere near as good as our normal tried and true recipe. 3 stars due to it being edible, but with minimal flavor. Pro tip: 2-3 tablespoons of Dijon mustard 5 minutes before serving.

I have tried several stroganoff recipes and they were never quite right. But this one is amazing! Don't know if it's the added tomato paste or what. One recipe that I never have any leftovers. I also use smoked paprika which is amazing! So amazing that I need to buy more. :)

Delicious and easy!  Ran low on sour cream, so supplemented with soft goat cheese (about half and half). Also left out the tomato paste because I'm not a big fan.  Used hot paprika rather than smoky.  Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow --- yum!  Will definitely make again.

I doubled the sauce( flour, broth, sour cream and tomato paste) . I omitted the paprika and parsley and added 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce.
 My husband and son loved it!

This is my third stroganoff recipe, but definitely the best. The extra prep time with fresh ingredients really pays off. Hit with the whole family!
