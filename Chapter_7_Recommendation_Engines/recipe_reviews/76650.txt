I've made this cake three times.  Twice as directed and once adding 1 cup milk as others have suggested.  The milk changed the consistency of the cake.  Although it was good it's much better without adding milk.  Try it as directed you won't be disappointed.

I make this cake often, exactly as it is here.  It is delicious.  I get tons of compliments, so thanks whoever posted this!  The apples have so much water in them that it cooks out into the batter and makes something I can only describe as an apple spice cake with the moisture of a brownie.  My friend HATES cake but he loves this.

This cake is delicious.  I would not call it ugly, but maybe "Apple Unadorned Cake" would be a better name.  It could use a strudel or a glaze to "pretty" it up, but it tastes fabulous without.  I too added the one cup of milk - I wonder if the cake would be uglier if baked without it?  The batter was just WAY too dry, and I couldn't bring myself to cut up all those apples for a dry, lumpy cake.  My husband said this one tasted like a quick bread, and wanted to either put butter or cream cheese frosting on it.  I'm bringing it to a brunch tomorrow, but we sampled a piece each, and we agree - this one's a keeper.  Thanks!

Edited to add:  I made this the first two times with canola oil, and it was fabulous.  When I made it with veggie oil, it had a really strong "oil" taste to it - I ended up throwing a lot of it away.

I chose this cake for it's simplicity and the name. It tasted great. I substituted 1 cup of white flour to wheat. The cake was pretty, light, crunchy and GREAT!! I made it for a party and served it with whipped cream. Delicious!!

REALLY GOOD!  The only difference to the actual recipe that I made was that I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 and I used corn oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also poured the batter into a tube pan instead of a 9x13 dish, and baked it for 1 hour 15 min.  Other than that, I left it just the same and will definitely make it again, hopefully soon :-)

I woke up on Christmas morning after having been ill for a few days and was regretting not having made something special for breakfast.  Apple Ugly Cake to the rescue!!!  Just super!  I made it exactly as written and was thrilled with the result.  I luckily had a bag of Macoun apples I had bought to make pies and I do think that they helped perfect the cake. But, I am sure a mix of Grannies and Macs would be just fine, also.  THANK YOU for posting this, MTWOMAN!

This cake is delicious. I cut down on the oil to 1 C. and only baked it 1 hour and it was done.  I was surprised that none of the reviews  mentioned how long it was to be in the oven. I served it, dusted with powdered sugar, to my book group and everyone loved it.  It was very moist and flavorful. Tonight I baked it again using those same changes and I also used Craisins as I was out of raisins.  I'm sure that will taste great also.

Excellent, I didn't change anything, the suggested milk isn't really necessary in my opinion, since the apples do give a lot of moisture while baking. I sprinkled around half a cup of sliced almonds on top before baking, made the ugly cake into a prettier cake. Had 4 granny apples in the fridge which weren't all that fresh anymore. The people loved this cake.

I took another reviewer's advice and added a cup of liquid (milk) to the batter. The top was deliciously crunchy/chewy.  I don't even like raisins, but I LOVED them in this cake!  I might try it with dried cranberries instead of raisins next time.  That sounds like it'd be nice and tangy.

I decided to cut the calories on this recipe when I made it. I  used Splenda for 1/2 of the sugar and unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 of the oil. Both worked great! I also added in an extra cup of apples and added the 1 cup of (skim) milk, as others had suggested. A very moist cake and the chunks of apples almost make it seem like an Apple Pie-Cake. The chunks of apple make this recipe different then most apple cake recipes. Yummy! I keep this cake in the fridge.

Very average, nobody could really taste the apple, just a generic somewhat fruity sweetness.. It was also very dense, probably because of all the oil? maybe i should have substituted some of the oil with applesauce. The only change i did was to cut down some sugar, to about 140g and the sweetness was just nice. This tastes better when chilled though, and goes well with a cream cheese frosting, to give it a slightly more complex flavour.

Wonderful cake!  I substituted butter for oil.  Perfect.  It looks dry and crumbly as your mixing the ingredients, but don't fret...it comes out light and perfect.

Taste so good, like those you buy in high-end cafes.  Do add 1 cup of milk, as recommended by one reviewer.  I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup and the sweetness is just right. The cake is not ugly!

Yum, this is amazing.  We've made it several times now and it always turns out perfect. Initally, my kids kind of scoffed at the appearance but after one bite  they were all sold. Definitely a 5 star recipe!

This was very good. I reduced the recipe by 1/3 to bake in an 11x7 pan - 
2 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 1/4 tsps each salt, cinnamon and baking soda, 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup oil, 2 apples diced and about 1/3 cup raisins. Baked for 50 minutes. Moist and delicious -good warm with ice cream.

This cake was very easy to make. I was surprised to see how stiff the batter was and had to really work to incorporate the diced apples. I topped the cake with the cup of apples that I did not put in the batter.

I did not put in the raisins, but will the next time I make this. I had crumb topping from a previous recipe which I used to covered the cake. My cake wasn't ugly at all!!

It was a hit at school. Added 1/2 tsp cloves, would add a bit more and maybe nutmeg. Really great...looks dry when you put it in pan, don't be fooled, it bakes beautifully and has a nice crunchy top so no frosting needed.

This cake is superb! I was initially worried when it cooked faster than recommended in my overachieving oven however it turned out well. I sprinkled a little confectioners sugar over the top and it added just enough sweetness to entice hubby. This cake gets better after a couple of days, next time I will make it ahead of time and let it moisten and the flavors develop in a covered dish.  Wonderful recipe.

There was nothing ugly about this cake. My cake looked very nice and tasted great too. My husband and I loved this cake and we warmed it up in the microwave and had a piece everyday until it was gone.  :-)

Updating my review. 
Wrote plum and not apples. Had a problem with a loads of fruit trees giving us way too much at the same time. So in error wrote the wrong fruit on this review.  Hope there was a laugh from some and some understanding from others. 
Enjoy the day and this cake.

I've been making and modifying this recipe since I first discovered it about 15 years ago.  Everyone loves it with Powdered Sugar Frosting or Cream Cheese Frosting.  Of course, the Cream Cheese Frosting is the favorite of most.

This is a good recipe that produces a nice moist dense cake.  the only reason I cannot rate it 5 stars is the bake time.  PLEASE CHECK YOUR CAKE AFTER ONE HOUR!  I noticed the bake time of 1.5 hrs seemed really off even though it is baked at 325(usually cakes are baked at 350).  Glad I decided to check it after 1 hr.  It was plenty done.  The only sub was replace 1 cup of oil w/applesauce, and only 1/3 c. oil.  I upped the spices just out of personal preference.  Used Ginger Gold and Macintosh apples. I did use a bigger dice which is nice to get a nice bite of flavorful apple.  added some nuts with the raisins.  This cake is not ugly. It was delicious and moist iced with a browned butter icing.  Only thing is to remember to check the cake 55 min-1 hr just to be sure it does not get too done.

The only reason I gave it 5 stars,  is I figured out how to make it more amazing....add 1/2 cup of applesauce in addition to all the ingredients.  This is a very good cake.  You don't need to add milk like I've seen in some of the reviews,  trust me 1/2 -3/4 of applesauce will do the trick, its one of the moistest cakes and very tasty!!!!  And for those the reason your not tasting apples is perhaps the choice of apple you used!  I used honeycrisp and it addefd a wonderful taste!

I've made this cake several times, sometimes as half a recipe. The only change I make is that I use less cinnamon due to personal preference. Not only it is very tasty and moist, it makes the house smell great :). The dough is quite dense and can be difficult for someone frail or with arthritis.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was finished after 1 hour in oven instead of 1 1/2 hours, so be careful in your baking time.  Even though it was enjoyable warm with ice cream and then again with coffee in the morning I can't say it is a favorite and I will most likely look for another recipe for the next patch of apples I want to turn into dessert.

This makes a great breakfast/coffee cake.  I subbed 1/2 wheat flour as well as 1/2 a cup of applesauce for some of the oil to make it a bit healthier.  I baked it in a bundt pan and after unmolding it, I drizzled a little powered sugar glaze for appearance (which took care of the "ugly" part :-).  It was very moist and tasted great!

We love this recipe! I try to make it a little bit healthier by substituting 1/2 of the oil for apple sauce. I also substitute in 1/3 to 1/4 or so of the flour as whole wheat flour. Not very noticable, but much healthier.

This was actually better the day after I made it. It seemed more moist then fresh from the oven. I did add some milk because I could barely stir the batter. Came out great!

I made this cake this past weekend for a church bake sale and got RAVE reviews for it. This is now my holy grail recipe for apple cake. The only changes I made were adding an extra egg (I was using small pullet eggs) and 1/2 C. water. The batter is too stiff if you don't add the water. I baked the cake as directed and it turned out perfectly!! Thanks to the original poster for this recipe. I will make this cake over and over again for years to come.
