This HEALTHY recipe has over 800 MG sodium per serving. the convenience of canned beans is very costly sodium wise. Use low sodium beans, home cooked beans, or at least drain and wash the canned beans.  This will cut about 24% of sodium.

great recipe, but very high in sodium, I would suggest, rinsing the beans, and replacing the liquid with water. This would cut down on some of the sodium and make the recipe more healthy.

Delicious and Easy!  I sauteed fresh onion and garlic first, added the frozen spinach and enough broth to cover.  Let that cook, then added the beans and spices.  Even the kids ate some!  (with help).

Very good!  I added a can of diced tomatoes and 1c. diced onion, and substituted a quart of tomato juice for half the broth.  Very good, very filling, and it freezes well too!

This was wonderful! It's so healthy and simple. I added a can of (no salt added) corn and a can of diced potatoes. Definitely a keeper. Everyone loved it! This cooks well in the slow cooker for 4 hours on High or 6-8 hours on Low.

This was okay, but not one of my favorites.  The broth consists mostly of the water and salt out of the canned beans.  It was pretty salty, but didn't have enough other flavors.  I would recommend rinsing and draining the beans, then making your own broth by adding curry or other spices.  To me, this recipe has way too much of a "straight out of the can" taste to it.

This is more like soup than anything else and it tastes okay but just okay.  It is certainly healthy and easy but it could taste so much better if it was tweaked a bit.  I would add onions, fresh garlic instead of powdered,red peppers tomatoes and some herb

This was really, really good!! In the quest for healthier eating, we are trying to eat more beans, green veggies, etc. This recipe turned up on a search and I was a little skeptical about this combo. However, because of the high nutrition factor & the good reviews, I tried it anyway. Wow - was I ever surprised. It is totally tasy!! Definitely will make it again. Thanks.

This was much better than I expected--I made it because I needed to use up beans...anyway, I crushed 2 garlic cloves and added them instead of the garlic powder, and I used 1/2 vegetable stock & 1/2 chicken stock, because I didn't have enough veggie stock. I also  sprinkled it with grated parmesan to serve--and it was really filling!

I thought this recipe was very good and very nutritious. If you have a small family, I recommend cutting the recipe in half because the spinach gets too strong after two days. But other than that, I loved the variety of bans and the simplicity of the spicing. thanks for another great, healthy recipe.

This was great.  I did change it just a little though.  I only used one can of veggie broth.  Had chicken and beef bullion cubes as used one of each with 2 cups of water into the veggie broth.  Left out the can of great morthern beans, glad I did, this is a very beany recipe.  I also left out the oil, was soupy enough without it.  Used garlic salt instead of powder and that also replaced the regulat salt.  Oh and the the pinto beans I used had jalapenos in them.

Incredibly great tasting. You wouldn't know it from the look of it. I reduce the amount of veggie broth and oil to make it less soupy and more healthy.

I skipped the canned beans and used 1/2 cup each of dried beans that I had sitting around in opened packages: great northern, black, red kidney and pinto. I placed the beans with two quarts of water in a pressure cooker and cooked them for 40 minutes. While the beans were cooking, I sauted an onion and garlic for about 5 minutes, added 1 pound of fresh spinach and cooked for about 3 minutes and then added about 3 pounds of sliced tomatoes. I sauted this for about 3 minutes and then added vegetable broth and let simmer. When the beans finished, I drained them and rinsed thoroughly and added them to onion/spinach/tomato/broth mixture. I simmered everything for about 20 minutes and then served the soup. Everything came out great. The beans came out firm--not mushy. I will definitely serve this recipe again with the above changes. The original recipe author called this a stew. I served this as a soup.

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I sauteed an onion and some fresh garlic before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.  I also added some sliced smoked sausage for my family of carnivores, doubled the great northern & pinto beans, and omitted the kidney beans (not a fan).  Finally, we added lemon juice & Tabasco to our individual servings.  This really kicked up the flavor & we had a fantastic meal!

As described, even if the beans are drained, it is way, way too salty - thus just three stars.

However, if using dried beans, it would be really tasty! Overall, a great idea for a recipe if you get rid of the excessive sodium.

This recipe is great! I substituted chicken broth, left out the spinach, added diced tomato and sautee'd onion and celery the first time I made it.  My family requested it again just days later.  The second time we made it, we added lima beans and didn't drain any of the beans.  I am sure we will try many variations and love them all.

I love beans and I love spinach, so this is great to me.  I followed Meriberk's suggestion and drained off the juice on the beans and replaced with water where necessary.  The beans still have a salty enough flavor to me.  I also left out the oil, as per another suggestion.

When I first read this recipe I was not too sure about it. I thought about how I could make it better and this is really a good hearty soup for a winter meal on a budget. The changes I made were slight. I added a chopped onion and 1 chopped carrot. I used black beans, dark kidney beans, northern beans and chili beans and added a can of chopped tomatos. I used 2 cans of chicken broth and floated 2 boneless skinless chicken thighs and chopped them when cooked. I omitted the oil. Spinich is such a nice change in soup! This all went in my crock-pot in the morning and the house smelled so good as soon as I opened the door after work! The flavor is great and I love all the colors together and the broth is such a rich dark color! I make lots of crock-pot soups and this is a keeper! Thanks for the great base!

Kind of bland for us. Not anything exciting. If we were ever to make it again, would have to add other veggies to it so that it would be more appetizing-looking and tasting. Too bad, so many people liked it.

This is a great, easy, fast, filling low-cal dinner.  Since we are not vegetarians, I used chicken broth b/c it's what I had.  Also, since there are only two of us, I used full cans of only the black, pinto and white beans, and cut other ingredients in half.  Served with cornbread.  I will make again.

I made this because I try to eat healthy, but it turned out very tasty as well.  I first sauteed chopped onion and garlic in the olive oil, added the broth and spinach, and finally the canned beans (all rinsed and drained as I don't like the feel of the bean liquid). Added a good bit of crushed red pepper and a handful of broken angel hair pasta. Very good and healthy.

It needed something more to it.  It was a little bland for my tastes.  I added some heat to it by adding in red pepper flakes and a few tablespoons of chili sauce.

A very tasty healthy dish for those of us without much energy after a long day of work. Only thing I substituted was chopped garlic for the garlic powder (you can but this pre-chopped at the grocery store, so I stock it.) This is a keeper for my winter cookbook.

We really liked this alot. Only thing I did differently was omit the oil and added a can of whole leaf spinach because just the 1 package of frozen wasn't enough. Next time I will try it with 2 pkgs of frozen. I used freshly ground pepper and did not add any salt. As others commented, there was plenty of salt in it from the canned beans.

I sauteed' garlic in oil and then added my dried beans that I soaked over night in water, this GREATLY reduced the sodium content for all you "healthy" reviewers.  I simmered until beans were very soft and then I ran my knife thru a large bunch of kale and sprinkled with parmesan cheese..simple and healthy

Great soup! I bought the beans with no salt added to cut down on the sodium content. I also added onion for more flavor. Other than that, I just followed the recipe. My mother made the comment that it looked disgusting, but now she's hooked! This is very good and definitely worth a try.

This soup is healthy and delicious!!! I used chicken stock made with a chicken base so it was really rich. I used all beans except pinto as I didn't have any in the pantry. I omitted the oil as I did't see any reason for it and it's healthier without it. I will definitely be making this one again for years to come!

I liked it but noticed a slight bitter taste from the spinach. I would make it again but would add ingredients suggested in other reviews.

My family LOVED this soup!  The combination sounds a little strange but the flavors go together perfectly.  It was good the day I made it, the next day and I have some in the freezer for a quick lunch another time.  I will definately keep the ingredients for this on hand and make it often.

Like others, I rinsed the beans to get rid of as much of the sodium as possible.   I used a 16 oz. bag of chopped frozen spinach, 32 oz box of vegetable stock, 15 oz can of chicken broth, a cup of raw onions, a can of diced tomatoes and two tsp of minced garlic instead of the the garlic powder.   I seasoned with ham flavored seasoning, salad supreme, Ms Dash (salt free), a pinch of cayenne and Adobo all purpose seasoning.  It turned out perfect.  Serving it with cornbread.

We did not like this at all. I followed the recipe as written except that I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Well, at the end, I ended up dumping in garlic powder, tabasco, extra black pepper, chili powder, and crushed red pepper in an effort to make it taste like something. It's very healthy and very easy if you like it, and a lot of people do. 

In the event that you do make this and when you taste it it's not for you, I did find that the chili powder and then topping the whole thing with fat free yogurt gave it more flavor, so we were able to eat it for dinner.
