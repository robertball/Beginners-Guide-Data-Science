Perfect!!  It is blueberry season here in Michigan and this is the third blueberry muffin recipe I used in the past week.  They are definitely the best!  My family loved them and agreed they were bakery quality.   They were moist with the perfect amount of lemon taste.  I added a lemon glaze (lemon juice & powdered sugar) to add a bit more sweetness.  Yum!

I followed the recipe and would not change a thing. I did use a Meyer lemon and it gave it an extra sweet boost.

Yummy!  Made them with my grandson who loves lemon blueberry.  Turned out moist and tasty.
