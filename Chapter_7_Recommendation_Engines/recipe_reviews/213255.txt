I thought I would post an idea for people who are like me, AKA trying to watch Calories and big lovers of Curry. (LOVE IT)  If you put the cauliflower in a food processor and chopped it up to about rice size, then microwave it covered for about a minute 30, it is a great Basmati rice substitute!  It cuts the calories in half! But only nuke the Cauliflower in the portions you need it.  That way if you have leftovers you just put the raw cauliflower in a dish with the curry over it and it will cook when you heat it all up together.  Hope this helps someone! And thanks for the recipe! :)

I like that this recipe is in very separate steps.  I just did the part with the pork chops and curry sauce.  I made my own apple chutney instead of using store bought.  I thought the curry sauce was a great and easy way to make curry.  You do have to add you own spice if you want it spicy at all.  I added a bit of red pepper to my chutney when I made it, and that did it.  My kids and husband loved it, and that's always a hard test to pass!

I love this site - some people say that if we make changes we shouldn't review the recipe.  I don't agree.  I saw this recipe and it sounded good but when I read the reviews I saw that others wanted more of a kick to it.  I like SPICEY Indian food so instead of buying Apple chutney I bought something called Pineapple Pepper chutney.  WOW - this was a great dish and the next time I will double the sauce because right now I would just love to eat the rice and sauce.  The caulifower was geat too. Thanks submitter.

Sorry, did not care for this dish.  The pork chops, sauce and rice were ok, but the cauliflower ruined it for my family. I expected the dish to have more kick.  Maybe use hot chutney.

Cooked this tonight for my family.  They are not used to curry dishes. They loved this!  I doubled the sauce ingredients but otherwise stayed true to the orignial recipe. Oh also used mango chutney instead of apple since I could not find any. Delish!

Excellent job Fight the Fat Foodie!  I made this recipe as written and it was great.  Loved it.  I made my own apple chutney from a recipe on another site.  I used a hot curry powder.  Lots of flavor from the spice so I didn't miss the fat.  Thank you for posting.

I made this for dinner last night. I don't have a steamer, so I just boiled the cauliflower. My grocery store doesn't have apple chutney, so, like another reviewer, I used mango chutney instead. I used red curry powder instead of regular curry powder, which helped with the spicyness.

The pork chops turned out great.  I wasn't crazy about the sauce.  It was quite gritty.  I don't think I'll make this one again.

I made this for dinner last night!!! Loved it!! I couldn't find Apple Chutney anywhere so I used Mango Chutney. Didnt care for the hard pieces of mango in there...next time I would strain those pieces out or look up a recipe for homemade. Also, would like to try this dish over brown rice since that would make it even healthier. 
This is a nice alternative to a Thai Curry which is my FAVORITE but soo laden with calories!!

This was easy and delicious to make! I have cooked pork chops before but often I overcook them...using this recipe mine were delicious! I loved incorporating curry in a pork dish, and this was a great way to add cauliflower to a dinner entree. Thanks for the recipe!

I though this was great! Made it exactly as written and it turned out superb. I love curry so this was a perfect meal for me. Also loved the fact that it is healthy, but not bland. Would make it again in a heartbeat.

Excellent!  A few changes: used 2 vidalia onions and one red bell pepper instead of cauliflower. Sauteed them with a bit of garlic and red pepper flakes after removing chops. Removed from pan when done. For sauce used 1 extra tspn of flour and used regular milk instead of buttermilk. Used mango chutney instead of Apple.

Made this recipe for the first time tonight for my family. Everyone enjoyed it, including my sixteen year old son. He even went back for seconds. The only changes that I made was switch coconut oil for the olive oil and chopped mango for the apple chutney because I didn't want to go to the store. I also added a half a cup of plain greek yogurt and chopped cilantro at the very end.  Thank you for the tasty new addition to my favorites list.

Very easy and flavorful.  I added a 2nd can of beans in order to fill up three hungry teenagers and served it with rice and sauteed brussel sprouts for a gluten free meal.

We really liked it! Even the picky husband cleaned his plate. We both found the green pinions a bit much so I may put sweet yellow onions next time or leave them off all together.

I modified a bit and used pork stew meat.  It came out delicious.i also used milk and butter and served cauliflower on the side in lieu of infusing.   Sauce on the side was fine for pouring over rice and veggies.  Wife and 3 of 4 kids gobbled, which is a success. Served with a good Riesling. The sweeter wine was a good pairing with the curry kick.  Enjoy

Absolutely delicious. DH also said this recipe is a winner. The flavors melded well without any one overpowering the other. I couldn't find Apple chutney so used Sharwood's Major Grey mango chutney. All other ingredients were used as described except added a 1/2 cup of sweet red pepper for color. This one will be in regular rotation. Thanks for the wonderful restaurant quality treat.

Excellent!! Used Currie powder, didn’t have paste.  And made buttermilk w 2% milk and vinegar. Used pork loin and cut into cubes. Other than that followed the recipe. So good will make again.

Delicious, healthy and great for a weeknight. Next time, I will probably only make 1 cup of basmati because it makes a ton.  I doubled the sauce and would do that again. I subbed half Balkan yogurt, half milk for the buttermilk, beef broth for the chicken and added sea salt, 1 tsp coconut sugar and 2 TBs of cold butter to the sauce, after tasting and found it needed balancing. I made  apple chutney from a recipe from another site and served extra on the side.

I made this and was looking forward to one of the 3 leftover pork chops for dinner the next day. There was 1/2 a pork chop left!!! Need I say more!!?? I did use sour cream instead of buttermilk and it could use more heat. The cauliflower was yummmm and I double the sauce.

I ended up nearly doubling the sauce, used spicy mango chutney (what I could find), and added a few pinches of cayenne powder for additional spice. The spiced chutney and cayenne aren't necessary if you aren't a spice lover like myself, but I always take things up a notch with asian and indian foods.  I also cut the pork into bite sized pieces before cooking, which we felt really made the dish more user friendly.  I'll add peas, peppers or other veggies when I make again, which I must because the boyfriend loved it! Very good for a weeknight meal.

I pretty much followed the recipe to the T. Except I added some red bell pepper. I definitely thought it was tasty but would have like to spice it up a little! I like my indian food hot and this is not. great flavor though! Next time the only change I would make would be to make it spicier.

This was too sweet for some reason.  I love sweet stuff, but this was a weird sweet to me.  My husband liked it a lot and it came out looking pretty...so that's my 3 stars.

I made this recipe because I had planned to make pork chops for dinner, with cauliflower as a vegetable side dish, and this sounded like an interesting variation on the same old-same old. As an added bonus, it was a one-dish meal.  I did make a few substitutions based on what I had in the house - half & half instead of buttermilk, rhubarb chutney (Bifana, also from this web site) instead of apple, regular onions sauteed with the pork chops instead of green.  And because my husband and I are both curry wimps, I cut way back on the amount of the curry powder I used - maybe half (or even less) than what the recipe called for.  In spite of these changes, our meal was absolutely delicious.  In the lovely creamy sauce, the sweetness of the chutney with the sharpness of the curry powder was a wonderful combination.  We will definitely be having this meal again!

This was okay.  We ate it without any problem and it did have some nice flavors for a low fat dish, but I wouldn't say we loved it.  It just didn't have enough "wow" to make me want it again.
