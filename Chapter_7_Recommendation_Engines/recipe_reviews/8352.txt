The coconut filling to the champagne cake was a great touch which was even more exquisit when I made champagne cake petit fours.

This is one of the best cakes I have ever made. It does make a lot of icing so be sure to use an extra deep pan. The disposible ones work well.

My review is only for the Filling (as I haven't made "this" actual cake yet) but WOW. I made the "filling" part of the recipe to top a German Chocolate cake because I was wanting to use up Marshmallows. I heated the water in the saucepan 5 minutes before the cake was done setting my double boiler aside with ingredients inside until ready. I added some Creme Brulee Sauce (like a caramel topping) a small splash of vanilla and substitute the wine with Seven-up. Topped the cake (and ate it too) while still warm and YUM!!! It was a great hit for the neighborhood Women's bible study! Will be making this one again!
