Used 2 teaspoons (instead of tablespoons) of cocoa and used my coffee creamer for the milk. Reminded me of cocoa krispies but in oatmeal form!

This oatmeal was definitely different. I followed the recipe and used 2 tbs cocoa powder and it was way too much that it  actually overpowered the coffee. I liked the addition of the chia seeds but not enough to make it again.

I don't usually enjoy oatmeal, but this was delicious! The coffee and cocoa added a lot of depth. I used only 1 tablespoon cocoa and that was plenty for me. I topped with a splash of cream and some chocolate-covered cacao nibs. Definitely adding this to my breakfast rotation!

This sounded so delicious, however the quantities and cooking times were way off. Even with doubling the amount of oatmeal and halving the cocoa powder, the dish was a sloppy soupy mess. Also the coffee basically burned in the microwave. One bite and it hit the trash. Don't waste the ingredients.
