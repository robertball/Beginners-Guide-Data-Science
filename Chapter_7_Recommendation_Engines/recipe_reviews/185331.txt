I don't need to try this recipe to know its right just wanted to offer some more advice. Try to ensure you buy the freshest ginger you can find this way it will not be stringy and you will find it very tender and pleasant to eat. We often put in so much ginger it is around 50% of the dish. Both fish sauce and oyster sauce vary greatly from brand to brand it is worth visiting a chinese supermarket instead of using the brands available in most supermarkets.

Loved this dish. I did change just a couple of things: (1) for vegetables I used one red bell pepper one yellow bell pepper snow peas green onions and mushrooms; (2) I used extra oyster sauce instead of fish sauce; (3) I did not use extra salt; (4) I cooked the rice separately; (5) I reduced the fresh ginger substantially - ginger is not a subtle flavor and would be too strong if one really used 1/2 a cup. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a great ginger chicken recipe. The only change I made was to double both the fish sauce and the oyster sauce after giving it a taste test. Other than that it was spot on and the family loved it!

This dish tasted just like the Pad King I get at our local Thai restaurant - it was amazing! I used beef instead of chicken about 1/4 c ginger doubled the oyster sauce and fish sauce and used about 1 tsp Thai roasted red chili paste. The fresh cilantro adds a nice depth to the dish. The entire dish was wonderful! I will absolutely be making this again!

We've been eating Thai out a lot lately. I decided to try some at home. This was a great choice. I did not use the full amount of ginger because I did not have that much. I didn't measure it but I think I added 2-3 tablespoons. A full 1/2 cup would have been overpowering. I also did not add the bell pepper because we do not care for them. The chili paste I used was some I got from the Asian market so I don't know if it was Thai. We really enjoyed the results. It was pretty quick to make and would be great for a weeknight meal. Next time I may add more vegetables like carrots and broccoli.

Only thing wrong with this recipe is there's never enough leftovers! I double it now to keep the hubby happy. I use a little less red bell pepper than called for and used Thai Red Curry paste rather than the chili paste (just what I had in the fridge) The prep is time consuming but well worth the end result. Can't recommend it enough!

WOW! This is one of the best Thai recipes on this website. I've tried plenty and it's been so difficult to find something that I would eat again. As you can tell we loved this. Here are the changes we made: -1/3 cup of ginger: be sure to cut it small enough -added one green pepper -doubled the fish sauce oyster sauce chili paste and added a bit more sugar to compensate Enjoy!

Very tasty made it just as is except for the chile paste. I only had chile garlic sauce so I used that. The fact that there is none left speaks for itself!

I was looking for a pad thai recipe and liked the combination of ingredients in this one but made a few substitutions. Instead of using Jasmine rice I used half of a 227 gram pkg of rice pad thai noodles soaked in hot water for about 10 minutes or until soft. I tossed the noodles and a couple of fistfuls of mung bean sprouts in the wok at the same time as the vegetables. I couldn't find Thai red chile paste so I used Thai red curry paste which provided a nice amount of heat to the dish. With the high amount of sodium in both the fish sauce and the oyster sauce there was no need to add extra salt so I omitted it. I didn't have any fresh cilantro but I did top the plates with some peanuts. Delicious and I'll definitely make this customized version again.

I love the flavors of this dish. I did make a few changes--1. I used 1lb of thinly sliced sirloin instead of chicken which I marinated in a tbsp. of hoisin sauce a tsp. of oyster sauce a tsp. of sesame oil and a tbsp. of red wine. 2. I minced the ginger and only used 1/4 cup. 3. Did not add sugar nor salt. 4. Added a diced cayenne and jalapeno from my garden to give it more heat. 5. Added a tsp. of cornstarch to the 2 tbsp. of beef broth (used instead of chicken broth) and chili paste along with a splash of sesame oil. 6. added fresh torn basil last minute of cooking. Just my personal touches/preferences but I'm sure it would be great as is.

This was very good. I couldn't find Thai red chile paste in the grocery store I was at and didn't want to drive to another. So I substituted oriental red chile garlic sauce. Also added snap peas. Otherwise followed exactly. Flavor was great and had just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming. Will make again.

Hi I am Thai. Just want to feed back on the original recipe. Gai Pad King means Kai = chicken Pad = Stir fry King = Ginger. Overall recipe is ok except that we do not use red chile paste for this type of dish. If you prefer hot favor you may add fresh slice big chilli for this dish (bird eye chilli is not for this dish. Spicy favor from this dish should be from the ginger not from chilli or chilli paste. If you dont like the smell of fish sauce you may use light soy sauce. You may also substitute chicken with fish (pla) or pork (moo) too. This dish is grate if you have stomach upset since the ginger can help in digestion. Enjoy!!!

I enjoyed this immensely! When you got a strip of ginger it was like a burst of bright flavor. I did not add any additional salt because in my opinion fish sauce is already incredibly salty but I did double everything that contributed to the sauce (broth fish sauce oyster sauce sugar & chili paste) because my family likes sauce to go over their rice. Very good!!!

Fantastic! The first time I made it I didn't have chicken so I used thinly cut beef. It was wonderful. Even my picky 7 year old loved it and asked for seconds! I made it a second time with chicken and it turned out great too. But my family preferred the beef. I also added sprouts and thinly sliced carrots for more veggies. Our only complaint was that it didn't make enough. Next time I will 3x's the recipe for our family of 6.

Very authentic tasting! I customized the recipe by mixing with rice noodles instead of serving over rice. To do this I had to double the liquid ingredients to ensure that there was enough sauce to coat the noodles. I also tripled the celantro because of personal taste. This is a great dish that combines many powerful flavors but manages to make them work in perfect harmony with each other.

A really outstanding flavor!!! Following the directions of other reviewers I changed the fish sauce & oyster sauce to 2 T & upped the mushrooms to 1 C as I had that much leftover. I didn't use any additional salt either. It was so very good! My family asked me to make a double batch next time so they can have leftovers!

I loved this and so did my neighbour - it was easy to make and delicious even when I ate the leftovers cold. I didn't have jasmine rice so I used exactly the same method for round rice and it was fine too. When it was cold it was a bit like sushi rice. Next time I think I'll add a green vegetable. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is so yummy!!!! I made the recipe as stated except that I reduced the ginger as sugg. by another reviewer down to 3 tsp. My kids really liked this.. I will double the recipe next time and use brown sugar instead of white and add more heat (spice). Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for my husband for his Valentines Dinner and I followed the recipe right to the limit except that I couldn't find the thai red chili paste but I did find Thai chili dipping sauce which I thoguht would be ok.... Husband said it was not hot spicy enough (and he likes Thai food) so that may have been the problem. I did put a dash of Asian garlic chili sauce to make up for the heat but still it was not what I was hoping it to be. Considering the cost for all of the ingredients cause I've never made Thai before I gave away my Fish and Oyster sauce as I know I will not be making this again. Sorry it was just a glorified stir fry that was just average and like others have said there really wasn't enough sauce. It was fun to try though! Thanks anyways!

This was excellent! I didn't have oyster sauce but it worked out okay with just fish. I accidentally put in 2 tbsp of chili paste (while looking at the broth line) instead of 1/2 tsp but it was the Thai Kitchen brand which is fairly wimpy and I can eat it right out of the jar anyhow. I used 1/3 cup ginger instead of 1/2 as some other posters had suggested and that was plenty. I might double the garlic next time. Other than that I followed the instructions as written. It was great and I had to fight not to eat the whole thing. This is only maybe the third stir-fry proper I've made in my new wok and FINALLY it actually tasted stir fried not too soggy or two done. One note the steps don't say when to put the oil in. The obvious place would be in the wok after it heated which is where I put it but someone new to cooking with a wok might forget because it's not listed.

This was absolutely incredible! Couldn't believe all the flavors that jumped out of this and so easy and quick to make! I served it over quinoa. I doubled the fish sauce oyster sauce and sugar. Next time I will triple it... maybe. Also added more chile paste because I love heat. Also I only used a quarter cup of ginger and the ginger flavor was still very pronounced. Super delish. I kind of want to make it again tonight.

I read through some of the reviews and I may be able to lend a hand! I was able to get this almost spot on to the style and taste from the restaurant we go to all the time. Delicious indeed. 1) If you need it to be more saucy add more chicken broth to your chili paste. Also i went with 1 teaspoon chili paste instead of 1/2. I used around 6 table spoons broth but you can eyeball it. 2) Making the sauce then letting it set on low low heat with a cover for 20 min before adding the chicken broke down a lot of the fibers in the ginger and the allowed the fish sauces to meld. From the initial taste test to letting it set the flavor was enhanced drastically. 3) I would def aim to get 1/8 inch thick chicken slices. To thick of chicken kinda blands out the meal because the sauce isn't sticky so you have less flavored chicken. Don't go too thin. You will have a dry protein then! Get a good sear on the meat as well. Once one side is seared throw the garlic in. You need high heat to sear meat but high heat will burn garlic. No one likes burnt garlic. NO ONE.. unless you do. then 1 person does 4) To get fluffy jasmine rice I set the rice in a pot of cold water for 15 min prior to cooking. I also rinse 2-3 times with cold water after it has set. The water should be tinted with white starch but not cloudy on the 2nd rinse. This allows for less mushy rice. Then bring to a boil with 1 part rice and 1 3/4 part water. as soon as it boils turn down to low and cover. Fluff only once to ma

Love the subtle ginger taste in this! I did not have enough ginger so added some ginger powder to the dish. Also I did not have oyster sauce so I used a scant tbsp of thick dark soy sauce and topped the tbsp with more fish sauce. Also used a heaping tsp of red chile paste as we like spicy dishes. Omitted the chicken broth as there was plenty of juice in the skillet. Definitely something to make again!

This was an amazing dish! I love Thai food and eat it regularly but was too afraid to cook it. This was simple. The trick I found is to make sure you have EVERYTHING cut and chopped prior to putting the chicken in the skillet. I kept it exactly as the recipe called for and it was fantastic. Just like the restaurant! I've already shared it many friends.

This is wonderful! My husband and I ate the entire dish but pushed back on the rice As we are trying to cut carbs. For the most part followed the recipe as written. I used extra garlic and Thai paste. We added extra hot sauce at the table. It's always great when you have the necessary ingredients on hand. I had it all except cilantro for garnish.

Wonderful favored dish! I like new recipes to try. I had gone to a Thai restaurant and I could not make up my mind when this was on the menu so I thought I would try this at home. I used a few hot pepper flakes instead of the red chili paste which was just fine. I thought there was not enough veggies so I added a cup of chopped celery. Yummy!!!

I tried this tonight and it was delicious!!! The only thing that I changed was that I doubled the fish and oyster sauce and barely used salt because the sauces have high sodium content. Overall this was an easy and yummy recipe that will become a staple in my dinner arsenal.

This was absolutely wonderful. I will definitely make this again. To save time I used leftover turkey. The only thing I would do differently is to double the Thai chile sauce but that's just personal taste. Thank you Shae's Mama!

This is so delicious just as it is. We served it over brown rice to make it a little healthier but all other ingredients were the same. Just like our Thai restaurant's Ginger Perfect dish YUM!!!

Delicious and simple! I quadrupled the oyster sauce (no fish sauce) and broth because I wanted more sauce to serve over Udon noodles. Skipped the sugar and only used a couple of tablespoons of ginger. I used red orange and yellow bell peppers and some white onion. Siracha for the chili paste. This was light and flavorful I liked that the sauce only had a few ingredients so that there was no flavor competition taking place. So good thanks for sharing!

I have made hundreds of recipes from this site. This one is one of the best meals I have made in my life! So good! The only thing that I did different is grating the ginger instead of cutting it (just easier to great a big hunk of frozen ginger then to cut it.)

This was soo good! My boyfriend was licking his plate and he never eats Thai food. I just followed the other reviews used 1/3 cup of ginger replaced oyster sauce with fish sauce (since I already had it at home) didn't use sugar and replaced the jasmine rice with a wild rice quinoa blend. I also used low sodium chicken broth. Thanks! We will def. be eating this again and I have already shared the recipe with co-workers!

We thought this was good but not great. I'm sure the Thai Kitchen red curry was to blame -- even though I doubled it there was no real punch to this. Still good though.

This was really tasty but I would have to say there is too much ginger for my taste. Next time I'll have to alter it to about 2 T - 4 T of ginger.

I didn't have Thai chili paste so I used 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper and Korean chili powder. I only used 1/4 cup Ginger sticks and I used Pork instead of chicken. My husband said this was better than the Thai restaurant in town. This is a must!!!

SO good! I didn't have oyster sauce so I substituted it with Hoisin sauce (thanks to google) and omitted the sugar as I always do in Asian dishes. I ended up doubling the hoisin and fish sauce. I also had a bag of frozen Thai vegetables which I used instead.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made a few changes but believe the resulting dish was true to the spirit of the recipe. I cooked the rice (Basmati) in chicken stock as I always do. My package of chicken was a little more (about 100 grams or 3 oz.) I used a 500 gram (1 pound ) package of oyster mushrooms. Used a large roasted red pepper. I also reduced the amount of ginger as I thought it would be too spicy for my husband. Next time I will use chicken thighs instead of breasts - I prefer the texture. I will also add a little more red curry paste. Overall a great success easy to make with ingredients I normally have in the fridge & pantry. I am just getting started with Thai recipes and was happy to find this one.

The piece of ginger I bought only gave me about 1/3 cup ginger but it was delicious! It tasted very much like the Thai restaurant I go to. It's a keeper!!! I could have doubled the recipe and it would all have gotten eaten family loved it!

This was pretty good. I did not have oyster sauce so subbed with soy sauce. I used 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 2 tablespoons of chili paste. Also only about 1 tablespoon of ginger. (My husband does not like ginger very much.)

Great recipe. Like the other reviewers I like to alter it. The bottom line: Once the chicken/garlic/fish/oyster sauce/ginger has been put in you can add whatever vegetables you like to this. I like different mushrooms and chunks of onion in addition to the green onions. I imagine water chestnuts and a bit of cabbage would be good too. Instead of the paste I thinly slice serrano peppers (4) to add the heat I like. I've eaten this to the point that the heat is painful but the flavor outweighs the pain and I'd do it again. I also add a little cornstarch at the end to the liquid to thicken it up slightly.

I'll make it again eventually. It needs a little more flavor; maybe because I couldn't find gluten free oyster sauce so I left it out? Next time will add spice to it.

Delicious! I didn't have fish sauce but I always have oyster sauce so I substituted some fajita sauce for the fish sauce. I know-not authentic but it was still sooo good. And the ginger wasn't too much for me! Thanks for delicious recipe.

This was the perfect meal! I made it as is (doubling the oyster sauce and fish sauce from other suggestions but after doing it didn't think it was totally necessary). The flavours were rich fresh and restaurant worthy. I love thai and I will be making this again and again.

This was delicious! I followed other reviewer's advice and double the sauce 1 extra tablespoon of fish sauce. I used three chicken breasts and added green pepper carrot regular onion and stir fry vegetables. The ginger wasn't overpowering with all the vegetables and chicken. I improvised in the chili paste and used chili sauce instead. This was delicious and made 6 servings.

Using fresh ginger really makes a big difference. It tasted like food from a Thai restaurant. I was missing fish sauce so I increased the oyster sauce no red pepper so I used mixed vegetables specifically broccoli and carrot used green onions and yellow onions. Absolutely loved it!

Love this dish! In addition to making it as is (though I do double or triple the sauce) another version is to make just the sauce part stir fry whatever vegetables I have on hand cook a package of Udon noodles and toss them in with the sauce and veggies - tastes just like a noodle bowl at a restaurant!

This recipe really was outstanding. The only change I made was to use about 1/3 cup of chicken stock and I served it with brown rice. My husband and I ate the whole batch in one sitting. I added more chile paste to mine at the table (I like it SPICY). I'll definitely be making this many more times. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Made this for supper tonight and it was was soooooo good! We're not fond of super-spicy food in our house so I halved the amount of chili paste and it was just right for us. Otherwise I went right along with the recipe and I was not disappointed. I will make this again and I will double-maybe triple-the recipe as we had NO leftovers.:)

Cooked garlic, ginger and chicken together in peanut oil. Mixed sugar, curry paste and fish sauce in little bowl before adding to cooked meat. Didn't use oyster sauce (soy). Natural juices from chicken breasts instead of broth. White ground pepper instead of black. Definite addition to meal rotation!
