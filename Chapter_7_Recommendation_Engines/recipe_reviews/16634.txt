What a sad name for such a great starter recipe. I used Newman's jarred alfredo sauce and hot fettucini noodles instead of a packaged noodle mix.  I did saute some fresh garlic, sliced onions, a sliced red pepper and fresh mushrooms (instead of canned) before adding the rest of the ingredients. I sprinkled each helping with parmesan cheese. Sick as I am, this was the best thing I'd had in days. I don't think I'd use canned asparagus next time, I'd use fresh. I think I'd add a little italian seasoning next time, too. Great starter recipe with pantry items for a quick dinner.

One of the best and easiest recipes I have tried off this site! I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt before cooking it. I also used fresh asparagus tips and fresh mushrooms. I kid you not, this dish tasted like it came from a restaurant. I even messed the dish up by not draining the canned italian tomatoes before I put it in the pan, but combined with the alfredo sauce it turned into a really nice creamy tomato sauce! My boyfriend raved about it. Thank you!

This was super easy to make.  I thought it was ok, but a neighbor (a non-cook) liked it enough to ask for the recipe.  If I make this again, I think I'll try using fresh asparagus and fresh mushrooms to avoid the canned flavor.

THe night I made this, my husband walked in the door 45 minutes later than expected. He, too, asked me what was for dinner and when I told him the name, he turned ghostly white! Perfect reaction to a wonderful and easy to prepare dinner!

I would suggest using fresh asparagus.  But overall, the flavors blended well.

I rated this 4 stars for the simplicity.  It was good. Hubby liked it even though he doesn't really like asparagus.  I will try it again but substitute brocoli for asparagus and add some bacon, just a personal preference.

I was looking for a simple chicken recipe and chose this one since I had all ingredients accept the alfredo noodles. When I went to the store to get the alfredo mix, I didn't know exactly what the recipe called for as "pkg of alfredo sause egg noodle mix" is a bit confusing. I figured I could go with alfredo sauce and fettuccine noodles when I came across the Lipton Noodle alfredo pkg (or you can you Pasta Roni). This was a really quick meal and very tasty. I put frozen asparagus (my boyfriend doesn't care for canned) and also added frozen broccoli to the water for the noodles (just in case I didn't like the asparagus. I did leave out the mushrooms though. It turned out great! My 10 yr old daughter was skeptical about the asparagus, she doesn't care for it either, but she told me to make sure to put in the review that she loved it!!

I changed the recipe a bit for some freshness. I used a Frescarini wholemeal alfredo pasta and sauce mix, but used fresh asparagus, mushrooms and tomatoes. I also added some zucchini. This was lovely and creamy, and the vegetables helped to balance out the richness of the dish. I was overall really impressed with this dish, even though the name makes me feel sad.

a nice quick recipe - I used fresh mushrooms which I sauteed in garlic oil and butter, fresh asparagus which I steamed for a couple of minutes. Prep time was nowhere near 20 mins in fact since I prepped as I cooked, this meal was cooked and on the table in less than 30mins.

Husband loved it!  Had to make a few substitutions.  Didn't have the Alfredo noodle package, so used egg noodles and alfredo sauce, and used regular diced tomatoes, didn't have any italian style on hand.  Was still very good and will definitely make again.  Husband agrees w/other reviewers that it would be better w/fresh asparagus and mushrooms.  Delicious and easy recipe!

This was pretty good and very easy. I did use fresh asparagus because I had some, but otherwise followed the recipe. I actually thought it could have used more pasta...in the future I might use a larger package or just make my own. But a good idea for a quick dinner. Thanks for sharing!

What a GREAT recipe!  Perfect blend of flavors for an easy creamy tomato based pasta dish!  Everyone ~ from my 3 year old to my Very Picky hubby inhaled this!  I, too, added fresh sauteed mushrooms and an Italian herb blend we like (Ana's Herbs) at the end to 'kick it up a notch' ~ it was just PERFECT for a family weeknight meal!  Next time I'll add artichoke hearts and maybe some black olives ~ YUM!  Thanks Kate!

I used fresh veggies and a jar of alfredo.  It was good and everyone liked it but it didn't warm up well for leftovers...

I love this recipe! I only changed a few basic things. I used Alfredo sauce from a powder mix. (Oregon Spice Co.) I also used fresh cremini mushrooms and fresh asparagus. Yummy-yummy. We changed the name in our house though, it didnt sound right coming out of my 5yr olds mouth.  :|

Ok, I gave this a 3 star because you definately need to add fresh mushrooms and asparagus.  I made with all canned and it was not the greatest.  I will make it again and try fresh and see how it goes!

Sorry,really not much flavor.  Maybe with a lot more seasoning it could work, but very disappointing as written.

Followed the recipe exactly. It was edible but not great.  I will try again using fresh ingredients (mushrooms and asparagus), and regular diced tomatoes, not with herbs.

I have made this recipe a few times but used fresh vegetables instead of canned.
