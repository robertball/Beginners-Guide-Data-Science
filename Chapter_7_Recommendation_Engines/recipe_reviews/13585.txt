I made this for dinner last night and guess what?  It tasted like, um.....cooked potatoes!  I followed the recipe exactly and they never made a peep.  Not even a whimper, much less a scream.  They'd have to sing a little song and do a little dance before I'd bother with this again.

I like this recipe and will try again.
I didn't have kosher salt on hand and substituted 1 tables. of sea salt with
over salty results.  The skins didn't crispin so at the end I removed lid and cooked awhile longer.  At very end added butter, minced garlic, parsley and pepper.  Thanks for sharing Kevin.
