Great recipe! I recommend adding a liberal amount of black pepper and serving with chili oil for a spicier version.

I couldn't find sake... but I used white wine and it worked really good... it is a simple recipe but a really delicious one.

Made as directed. Great flavour but I let the cornstarch get wet on the meat so it 'globbed' up a bit. Next time I will put in the oil right after dipping in cornstarch.

It's not exactly like real Japanese Karaage because it uses cornstarch but it definitely still comes out really yummy. I personally didn't have Japanese sake so when marinating the meat I just used soy sauce grated ginger and minced garlic. Hopefully I will have sake next time so I can taste what the original recipe is actually like!

Perfect as written and I wouldn't change a thing. Tons of flavor and super easy to make.
