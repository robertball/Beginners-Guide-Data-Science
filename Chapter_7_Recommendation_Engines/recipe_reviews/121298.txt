Oh my goodness...these make a GREAT vegy burger!  I made a few changes in the recipe because I didn't have cornflakes in my pantry.  I used Special K w/protein instead.  Also, I used Egg Beaters instead of eggs and omitted the salt and sugar (Special K is slightly sweetened).  I cooked the patties in a nonstick skillet with canola cooking spray instead of using oil.  The patties cooked up wonderfully and were a welcome treat at our dinner table.

The first time I made these I have some problems holding them together. But the second time they came out great (with some tweaking)! I added about a cup and a half of mashed sweet potato to the mixture as well as a bunch of fresh chopped cilantro. The sweet potato really held everything together and tastes great. Also, this way you can cut way down on the bread crumbs/corn flakes.

I gotta say, we are meat eaters (my hubby & I), and have trouble considering things a meal unless there is SOME kind of meat, but I'm trying to healthy us up a bit. So I thought after all the great reviews I'd give this a try...with a few personal substitutions....SO, I used Corn Chex instead of Corn Flakes, (I had them left over from 4th of July party mix).  And We prefer savory over sweet in most dishes, so instead of the sugar, I used an equal amount of marjoram.  These were so great, we will defiantly add them to regular dishes!!!! 
My Hubby said they remind him of crab cakes.  I'm so glad I found this recipe, and hope ya don't mind if I pass it along!

This was excellent!  I juice a lot of carrots and was looking for a way to use the pulp.  It worked out great.  My meat-eating husband said that it was one of the tastiest burgers that he ever ate.  Also, I only had one cup of cornflakes, so substituted a cup of bran flakes, which worked well.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought that these were great!  I used only the egg whites, and added and extra, and also added red and green pepper.  I made the patties small, and ate them plain.  Even my dad who usually thinks veggies are gross enjoyed these.

As a soy-sensitive asthmatic who is trying to go meatless at least once a week, this recipe is almost too good to be true. I added one small baked sweet potato to extend the recipe without adding more cereal, used large eggs and a dash or two of worcestershire sauce. It turned out great! I'm going to try it as a 'meatloaf' next.

I liked them; my husband did not. They become more 'burger-like' as leftovers because they have the chance to firm up in the refrigerator. Because of this, I recommend making them ahead of time and then reheating gently.

Yum!  I made the "kid-friendly" modifications for my hubby: used onion powder and celery seed instead of fresh onions and celery.  I also chopped the carrots into tiny pieces instead of dicing.  I topped it with muenster cheese and ketchup, and served it on a whole wheat bun.  I wasn't too hungry so I just prepared a burger for him.  But while I was waiting for him to come down for dinner, I ended up eating half of his burger because it was so good.  My meat loving husband finished the other half and I had to make another whole one for him.  This was the first veggie burger my picky husband has ever ate, and he said he would eat it again.

I try to have at least one meatless night for dinner each week, so was exited to try these. The only change I made was omit the sugar. I did have a bit of trouble keeping them together when forming the patties. Maybe refrigerating them a bit prior would help?? I loved these but my husband said they were good, but could use a bit more flavor. I like that these are healthy though and would make them again!

I thought these were very yummy.  They held together well.  I loved them as-is  but as a mom trying to incorporate more healthy meals, next time  I'll make them more child friendly (I have one who hates vegetables)  by pureeing the carrots and using onion powder or dry minced onion and celery seed or celery flakes.  I also had my daughter use the old rolling pin and plastic baggie to crush to corn flakes and it got her involved in the preparation.

These actually were really good! I halved the recipe because I have a small family and I made a few changes. I didn't have any cornflakes so I used seasoned bread crumbs and I only used 3/4 of a cup instead of 1 cup. I didn't have celery so I just used celery seed and extra onion. The mixture seemed a little bit dry so I added just a tiny bit of water. I served them on homemade burger buns from this site. They were very flavorful, I think because the seasoned bread crumbs. Next time I think I will use more carrots and I do want to try it with the cornflakes. Also, I didn't have any fresh tomato or anything and I'm sure they'd be great with some fresh toppings. This really is a great recipe and my 4 year old actually liked it too!

These burgers are amazing! Great taste and texture, just as good warm or cold. I shredded the carrots as per other reviews and they hold together perfectly. I also used cilantro instead of celery. Next time, I'll try to use something healthier than corn flakes, though.

This was great!  I had to make some substitutions for what I had on hand (Corn Chex instead of Corn Flakes).  I used a food processor to shred the carrots, and cooked them in the microwave instead of the skillet.  I love hamburgers, these are a pretty good substitute.  Mine ended up a little sweet (probably the Corn Chex), so I may skip the sugar next time.  Served these with sliced tomato, lettuce, and mustard on a bun.  I enjoyed them hot out of the pan and cold the next day.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did have to tweak a little according to what I had on hand. I didn't have corn flakes, so I used 3/4 C. special K cereal and 1/2 C. italian seasoned bread crumbs. I also used 2 egg whites instead of full eggs. I left out sugar and salt. I also omitted oil and cooked in a non-stick pan with PAM spray. Delicious flavor, I would not recommend this recipe to someone who does not enjoy the flavor of carrots, as the carrots really do hold their flavor. Which is good, in my opinion.

*Shred the carrots*  I put mustard, tomato, and baby spinach on this and took a big 'ol bite.  I fully expected to be disappointed but I was blown away by how 'burger' like it was!!!  Yay! Thanks for making my 30 day vegan diet easier! :) I think I'll try bran flakes for added nutrition.

I made some changes, used oats, added tspn dried basil and tblspn minced garlic. I formed them into small balls and they help up well and were  thoroughly enjoyed by all.  Absolutely yummy....will most certainly be making these again.  I have no doubt the original untouched recipe would be just as tasty.

Sorry, these are much too sweet for a veggie burger, and I didn't even add the sugar. I also don't like that the patties are mostly cornflakes. They are more like cornflake burgers, not carrot burgers, and they taste like it. I won't be making these again.
In order to get the patties to stick together, I slightly mashed the carrots after boiling and added a splash of oil to the mix.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I couldn't get these to hold together.  I added 2 more eggs, and that worked a little better.  I did not care for the strong taste of the cornflakes, so I will try substituting something else next time.  However, my son rated these "surprisingly good," so I will go with a four-star rating!  Thanks!

These are awesome! I used multigrain cheerios because I didn't have cornflakes and omitted the sugar. I also used onion salt in place of the chopped onion and salt. These were great with the Chipotle Mayo from this site!

These are great! I only had about a cup of cornflakes, so I used a mixture of some leftover zucchini bread crumbs and rye cracker crumbs to make 2 cups. I'll probably just use the Rye cracker crumbs exclusively next time. I also used more carrots (2+ C) and onion than the recipe called for. If you do this, you may want to add another egg to help it all stick together better!

These are simply fantabulous!  I added a few finely chopped cloves of garlic and used Grape Nuts flakes for the added Whole Grain and Fiber.  We loved them.  My husband/daughter made them up like hamburgers, I just ate the patties by themselves.

As is, this recipe didn't hold together at all. I squished, I squashed, I let it sit in the fridge for a bit -- nothing held it together. It TASTED good, though, and I finally just ended up dumping it and cooking it thoroughly and eating it that way, but I couldn't form it into burgers. Perhaps grating it like other reviewers suggested will do better.

I was a bit reluctant to try this recipe becuase I know carrots can be sweet but I am glad I did! They are delicious! I didn't add the sugar, I didn't think it wasn't necessary. I also left out the pepper since we don't use it. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I had trouble forming the patties at the beginning but then solved that by wetting one hand before forming each patty.

Oh my goodness! I just made them for the first time-they were SO good!

As always, I made a couple variations. I only used egg white, omited the onion, added some Old Bay Seasoning,used cooking spray insted of oil, and used Splenda insted of sugar

My mother was unsure about how they would be-she hates veggie burgers. She was impressed too!

I'll be makeing this one again and again!

Awesome! I made these for my SO and his mom. They loved it even though they're not vegetarian. This will be something I'll make often in future, (and may I also add this is the first few recipes I've actually tried since I discovered a passion for cooking)
By the way, my patties didn't stick very well together, is it because I need more cornflakes or eggs? Could someone help me for this?

I did what the recipe suggests and diced my carrots, next time I will try grating them instead, I think it will make for a nicer consistency.  I had to add about three tablespoons of flour to be able to form patties.  Even then I had trouble frying them.  The burger was delicious so I will try this again .

Fabulous! I had one less egg than I needed so added about 3/4 c cooked red lentils (I find they don't have any taste when used in other dishes) and the burgers held together well. Also omitted sugar and added 1/2 tsp curry powder. A keeper for sure, and very economical. I will try making them meatball-sized to serve in pita bread, and with a savory spice (e.g. oregano) I think they'd be great in spaghetti sauce!

These were delicious. My almost 13 year-old daughter challenged me that she could not go a week without eating meat. This was the first dish I made for the week and she loved them. Even my husband, who doesn't like vegetables, told me to save the recipe.

My husband and I liked the flavor and I was surprised that my kids enjoyed these at first.  The kids ended up eating a whole patty each.  I only gave a 4 as the they fell apart pretty easily.  I plan on making these again and playing with the recipe a little to get them to hold together better.

I would give these 3.5 stars if I could.  They were  good but could use more flavour.  I had difficutly making patties out of the mixture- probably had too many carrots and it wouldn't stick together.  I ended up adding a variety of shredded cheeses, oiled a 9x11 pan, and baked at 350 for 25min.  Could have used some more moisture, but a good recipe to play around with.

Awesome! I don't use corn flakes for anything I always sub with Panko, they're Japanese bread crumbs. I love garlic so obviously I added garlic. I also substituted those eggs with two Ener-G egg replacers. Worked like a charm ;) One last thing, add 1 teaspoon of dried dill. It turns these from good to great.

I don't know what I did wrong but I just tried to make these and they didn't hold together at all.  I'm very disappointed.  I was very anxious to try these too and so sorry to give so low a review.

These were wonderful!  I subbed 1.5c plain breadcrumbs in lieu of cornflakes, grated the carrot and used a little Pam on my hands while forming the patties.  They stayed together beautifully while cooking.  Great texture, very tasty, and filling too!  This recipe is a definite keeper. UPDATE: I've made these numerous times now for my toddler.  To save time I spread the mix into a mini-muffin tin with 24 wells and bake at 400 for 15-17 minutes.  Yum!

These are delicious!  I made them as close to the recipe as I could w/o making a trip to the store for celery. I used the store brand generic of corn chex in place of flakes and a whole, small onion to make up for no celery. I fried them gently in shortening. I served them as a side dish w/ smoked pork chops, cottage cheese & pineapple. I will absolutely make them again! Next time I plan to make a pineapple sauce to serve over them. Another review pointed out they are similar to crab cakes - I agree and that's why I made them. I was looking for a side dish recipe to use up a #10 can of dehydrated diced carrots I bought for Y2K. Since the economy has tanked where I live I am trying to "live out of the pantry" (and the freezer) three weeks out of each month. A versatile recipe like this one makes doing that much more fun and now diving into the food storage closet isn't so daunting.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome! I am really surprised how much like liked these. I made them just as directed and they turned out perfect. They are sweet, light and perfect for when you want a healthy alternative to a burger.  I will be making these again (and again). :-)

These burgers were surprisingly good. I used bran flakes instead of cornflakes because thats what I had and also for a healthier burger and they still came out great. I definitely would be trying these again.

This was just OK. Very dry and didn't hold together well. I think it should have more carrot and less cornflakes. I also shredded the carrots. Can't imagine how hard it would be to make it hold together if they are diced. You might be able to make them more moist by shredding the onion directly into the mixture. That way you get some juice from the onion, too. The family and I agree, that I won't be trying these again anytime soon. It just wasn't for us.

I took a chance on these as my husband has recently become a vegetarian.  The only other veggie burgers I've ever made fell apart, so I haven't tried since.  I have to say these were very easy to work with.  After the carrots were cooked simply threw everything into the food processor.    We both liked them well enough topped with mayo, lettuce and tomato.  My husband thought they were a little sweet, but he's a hot and salty kind of man.  (His tastes I mean :)  We'll definitely make again.  Easy summer supper.

These were just OKAY. A little on the sweet side, which is not really my taste as I prefer spicy, exotic things. Black bean burgers are 100000x better, IMHO.

These were not really that great - too much cereal, too little carrots. The method worked well and the patties came out well following the directions exactly, but they basically taste like cooked dry cereal with egg.

First for those that asked..If it does not hold together add bread crumbs or egg.  I chose to make mini-burgers and baked them (also helps them stay together). If you bake them make sure to use cooking spray so they don't stick. Taste was great. With 1/2 the mix I also added curry which brought out some interesting flavors.

These are awesome! I just made some to try today and they're surprisingly yummy. I did make a some changes, but I'm sure they would have been good done exactly as the recipe is written as well. I didn't have corn flakes so I used Rice Krispies and a little quick oats instead. I finely chopped the carrots in the food processor and used onion powder instead of onions. I added some worcestershire sauce and a little soy sauce for extra flavor and to give it a darker color. I also added a little hot water to make it easier to form the patties. I had to cook them longer than 3 minutes per side to get a nice crunchy crust on the outside. They really are delicious!

i was skeptical even with all the reviews, esp. cuz carrots arent my fave, but i was surprised!  i used half a mystery cereal i had and half rice krispies.  i also accidently burned the burgers a tad, but it made for a crunchy outside and a soft inside, yum.  the only thing was that the burgers were really small.  next time, ill add extra carrots, maybe twice as much.  very versatile, lots of room for experimenting.

My family loved this burger. My husband is a meat and potato kind of guy and he loved this. We used grape nuts or rice puffs instead of the corn flakes, as we did not have any on hand. Grape nuts were definitely the better choice.

This is definately a five star or more..I love this recipe. I used crushed shredded wheat instead of cornflakes, and honey instead of sugar..My family loves these carrot burgers. They cooked up beautifully, didn't stick to the pan. They stayed together perfectly and moist too. I can't say enough about the recipe. It's a definate keeper...and I've already used it several times...Oh! if you want to make more out of the recipe just add more carrots and make 10-12!

I used a food processor to shred all of the veggies and they still didn't stick together so well. Neither myself or my two children really cared for the taste of these. My son asked me if I could 'never make them again'. Unfortunately, this was a miss for our family.

I'm a meat eater, but I'm surrounded by fussy eaters and get rather tired of having the same meat dishes all the time so I thought I'd give these a try. I followed the recipe quite closely though I substituted honey for the sugar, and a handful or two of bran instead of some cornflakes since I'm trying to get more fiber in my diet. I finely shredded my carrots for a texture that I prefer as well. Overall they had an ok taste, and they were relatively easy to form, though I only got five out of this. If I make these again I would probably experiment with seasonings more, and likely omit the sugar (or honey in my case) as the carrots by themselves have enough sweetness.
Thanks for the recipe :)

Not bad. Fixed for my daughter-in-law who is a vegetarian. She was impressed and has made them a bunch of times since

they turned out great!  i used  mini buns with walnuts i found in the bakery section of the grocery store.  it added a lot of flavour.   I also used breadcrumbs and sweet potato instead of cornflakes.

This is a great starter recipe.  I've never made a veggie burger before and I took other reviewers advice into consideration.  I didn't have all the necessary ingredients, so like many others I improvised.  I didn't add the sugar either. I shredded instead of diced the carrots.  I also added worcestershire sauce and a small amount of sweet potatoes to make sure they didn't fall apart.  My whole family enjoyed... but we will do some more trials to see if we can get a flavoring we like better.  Thanks for this simple, healthy and delicious "Burger".

made these last night and they were great.  I used crushed up saltine crackers (i halved the recipe, and i used about 10 saltines - so you would need about 20 for the full recipe :) also i didn't have any celery but just added some more onion instead.  These were very tasty and i can't wait to make them again :)

We made these for last night's dinner and they were delicious.  I did omit the sugar and salt from the recipe (hubs is on salt and sugar restricted diet).  Didn't need the sugar, carrots are sweet on their own, and I put salt on my own burger.  I put everything through the food processor so no need to cook carrots.  Also, processed the cornflakes.  It takes a little longer to run everything through the processor but well worth the effort.  My patties held together like they had superglue mixed in.   I found that 2 cups of whole cornflakes are a lot less than 2 cups of crushed/ground cornflakes.  Great for a meatless dinner.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Phyllis.

Yum, these were good, though they kept falling apart and were hard to cook. I didnt have any cornflakes on hand, so I used 2 cups of bread crumbs, which I ground in the blender. I also used garlic salt instead of salt, and skipped the celery since I didnt have any. Overall, great, I will make again.

Yummalicious!!!!!  Kiddos ate it up.  Didn't have Corn Flakes, so we used, pandko bread crumbs, a little oatmeal, and a little Fiber One.  Shredded carrots and actually purreed (msp) everything together.  Served with sour cream and baked potatoe fries and salad.  Will def make again and again and will probably try out different spices...I'm thinking Asian...thank you for helping me get some veggies in my family.

These are great, I've already made them twice but with a few changes: I shredded the carrots, left out the sugar and the celery (just because I hate celery) and added parsley and more onion instead. Wonderful.

I followed this one to the letter and it was good. My brother who is a vegetarian asked for the recipe. I think that the carrots should be chopped in the food processor as I chopped mine by hand, and a couple of the patties did not stay together all that well. Topped these bad boys with pickeled jalapenos, red onion, romaine lettuce, mayo and siracha hot sauce.

Very yummy! Instead of cornflakes, I used stale breadcrumbs which made them VERY moist and tasty. Only used egg whites, green onions, no sugar. The carrots made it sweet enough.

these were very yummy on their own, but when i put them in a bun the taste kind of disappeared, all i could taste was my bun. really liked it as a patty on it's own instead, and ate another 3 that way with some spicy ketchup and mustard...

I liked how these tasted, but I couldn't get mine to stay together for anything.  Granted,  I was running low on patience, but it was really hard to cook them.  I WILL make them again and cut my veggies finer and make the carrots softer though. My husband really liked them!

This is a great recipe- easy, inexpensive, and nutritious.  I sub bran flakes and omit the sugar.  We like them without any hamburger bun at all, with a little cheddar cheese melted on top.  Yum.  These burgers have a surprisingly good texture and are not at all mealy, as some veggie burgers can be.  I have served these to several meat eaters who absolutely loved them (asked for the recipe and everything)!

My daughter loves these.  I draw a little face with ketchup and she is thrilled to pieces.  I sometimes add a few slices of tofu, fresh cilantro / dill for added flavor.

These were just okay. I looked for tips on improving them, but the taste was nothing special. I make the Zucchini "Crab" Cakes from this site, and truly, this recipe tastes like that one, but without the old bay. On the bright side, I realize when you shred the carrots, you don't have to boil them ahead of time. Also, I think I'll toss some carrots into the Zucchini recipe. They blend in nicely with other flavors. The real trouble with this was the patties didn't stick together, despite making them ahead of time. Definitely add some bread crumbs. Thanks for the recipe though!

These came out better than I expected. I did make some modifications. I shredded the carrots and did not cook them first. I did not have celery on hand so I shredded zucchini in its place. Used a bit more onion, omitted the sugar, and replaced the cornflakes with 1 1/2 c oats. No problem with binding and very simple. Yummy and crunchy!

I found this to be a great "veggie burger in a hurry" recipe- but I did need to alter it so that it made sense to me as a meal option. I added a can of lentiils and 350 grams of extra firm tofu for protein, and then going the savoury route, I nixed the sugar in favour of thyme, parsley and chopped chives. All of those changes just reflect my preferences, of course- this mix as it is would be a good base for your own additions and subtractions. However you make it, do taste the mix before adding the egg-- you may find as I did that you'd like extra salt and pepper.

Tried these last night & really enjoyed them!  Very, very easy.  I hand grated the carrots, celery & onion. Mixed them together and microwaved for several minutes without adding any liquid.  Used oatmeal in place of cornflakes - let mixture sit for a bit before forming patties.  Will definitely make again!  I put a couple of patties in the freezer after cooking to see how they will work as a last minute fast meal.

My kids and husbund loved these burgers!  I was a little hesitant to try them but after reading the reviews decided to give it a go.  It is a quick and easy recipe that my 4 year old helped with up until the frying.  The only change I made was that I shredded the carrots instead of cutting them small and they stayed together nicely when formed.  This will definitely be an addition to our dinner menu as I am used to buying prepackaged veggie burgers and these are much yummier and way cheaper.  Thanks for the recipe!

So right now I'm going to give this a 4. I may have to change it to a 5 when I try it again...I hope so! I didn't have celery so I just took it out, which I have a feeling was a big mistake. I'm not a big celery fan though, so we'll see. I also only had Kellogg's crumbs. They were really good, but missing something. I'm not sure if the celery taste, for me, will make it a 5. I bought it anyway though, and real corn flakes, this time. Will make again soon!

I could not get these suckers to stick as a patty! I had to throw an extra two eggs into the mixture, resulting in more of an omelette than a burger. Still, they tasted pretty decent on a bun with ketchup – but next time I’ll dribble in some barbecue sauce or something, since the burger lacks a kick of its own.

These were absolutely delicious! The only changes I made were that I finely chopped the carrots, and I substituted dry oameal for cornflakes, and I omitted the sugar, and they came out wonderful! Had some of them for lunch with olive bread and sour cream, and I'm saving the rest for dinner to put on burger buns. My boyfriend will love these! Excellent, easy, and inexpensive! I always have all these ingredients around, will be making them often! And I also juice carrots a lot, will try making these from the pulp!

I thought this was too dry and bland. Just because it's healthy, it still could have some flavor - diced green onion, poultry seasoning, etc.  The family said they would rather not eat than have these again.

Not as good as I was expecting.  Seemed like it could've used more onion...or maybe next time I'll sprinkle each patty with some Mrs. Dash Herb & Garlic.

I thought these were very good. My three-year-old liked them as well. My husband doesn't care for carrots much, so he didn't care for them. However, I plan to make these for myself and my daughter. Thanks for the recipe!

These are surprisingly good.  I was looking for a way to use the leftover pulp after juicing carrots, and this made a nice dinner.  I've tried dicing the carrots as the recipe states, but find it much harder to form the patties and keep them together.  I definitely recommend grating the carrots or using carrot pulp from juicing.  Adding mayo or other rich additions makes it more satisfying - you don't even miss the meat!

These are freaky little burgers that will surprise you.  They hold together because of the cereal.  Ever try to get a dried cornflake off a bowl?  But you can also sub things like cornbread stuffing(my favorite) plus Asian seasonings.  I like to sub Braggs for the salt and add ginger and sesame seeds.  The original recipe is great and altering is fun.  I have used it for stuffed peppers.  I'll bet you can sub pulverized frozen corn for the cornflakes plus a few T of flour.  I'll post if I try it.

I am new to cooking and this was an excellent choice. The ingredients and preparation are relatively simple and the cooking skill needed is minimal. An A+ for any college student.

Taste-wise these are definitely a five, however, I have the hardest time making them stick together. I've made them twice now. The first time I used shredded carrots, didn't follow the directions properly, as I was in a hurry, and didn't boil them. The second time I made them I followed the directions to a T, and *still* the patties did not stick together. I am open for suggestions because they are SOOOOO delicious and would really like to add them to my regular rotation. Thanks in advance :)

These are tasty, but I think mashing the carrots or refrigerating them are a necessary step. Mine fell apart pretty quickly. Good use for leftover carrots!

Followed to recipe but the burgers would not stay together.  Next time will try "shredding" the carrots rather than "dicing" them to see if we can get better results.

These were really good. I used bread crumbs  1 1/2 cups. I also added 1/2 cup flax meal to it. I didn't have celery so I added celery seed & onion powder with garlic powder. I put cilantro in it too, like one reviewer said. Next time I'll try shredding the carrots. It was god and will definitely make again.

Good, but a little sweet. Next time I'll try to work in more savory flavors to balance it out. I used bran flakes instead of corn flakes and they were great!!

After so many bean and tofu varieties, this was a very refreshing take on a veggie burger! I tried the suggestions- egg whites, sweet potatoes (1 small steamed), NO salt sugar needed, although I did use some herbamarre organic seasoning.  I pre-made them and froze them for later-- still great! Will make again for sure maybe with rice and sunflower seeds as well!

The only reason for the 4 stars is because it did not stick together well prior to cooking the patties, however they stuck together after cooking.  I didn't have any corn flakes, so I used oat bran instead.  My husband said that this is one of his favorite vegetarian recipes.  It's definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

I've never made a vegie burger. It was really great and easy! I used cilantro and a wheat berry cereal with Omega 3's by "UNCLE SAM". I wasn't sure about dicing the carrots but it held together fine. I bet I could use all sorts of vegies in this and maybe a little less cereal. The calories say NA but mine came out to 237 for 4 patties. With the cornflakes it would be 40 less calories per patty.

These tasted great and my husband and kids loved them.  I did have some trouble with the patties not holding together despite adding an extra egg as a binder.  Still, the taste was great.  Next time I will add even more egg or maybe some potato to help hold them together.

I absolutely LOVED these!  What an awesome alternative to the original store bought veggie burger.  I added a little chopped jalapeno and used bran falkes instead of corn flakes and they were great.  I also just coated my pan with cooking spray rather than use the oil.  I will be making these again soon!

These were yummy! Flavorful, fun, colorful! I shredded the carrots and used brown sugar instead of white. I used olive oil instead of veg too.  I also added a clove of chopped garlic. I made them as little sliders with sweet potato fries.  The only downside was kind of a lot of prep work...but I made a few extra patties and froze them.

I LOVE these so easy I cook the carrots the stick carrots celery and onions in my magic bullet so my kids can't pick any chunks out. I also have been making them with a bread crumbs, cracker and flax seed combination instead of cornflakes since that's what I have around the house and everyone loves them!

YUM!  I used panko bread crumbs instead of corn flakes and added fresh garlic.  Reminded me of "crabby patties" from Sponge Bob!  I can see why they'd be a big hit with kids!  Next time I'm going to try adding cayenne and hot sauce!

These are great, and so versatile, I have made them exactly as stated on the recipe, but have also made vegan burgers by using egg replacer; and koftas by  adding a little garam masala and making them much smaller. Other vegetables can be added, sweet potato is very nice. Thank you very much for the basic recipe

I added garlic, chilli flakes and some ground almonds to give some pep and protein but I still found these were lacking flavour on their own once cooked. I brushed them with oil and grilled them warming them up in a dry frying pan the following day. For a taste/effort/cost ratio these were fab tho. Will use the resipe as a base for experimenting ie with different veg and cereal. I think poppy seeds would be fab in them.

Really good.  The closest my children will get to a burger.  (They don't like meat.)

Pretty good carrot burgers.  Bf said they were pretty good for carrot burgers.  LOL.  He's not a huge fan of veggie burgers, so that's not bad praise from him.  I had shredded carrots, and no corn flakes.  the closest thing we have to corn flakes in this house is frosted flakes, and those weren't going to work, so I used bread crumbs.  I just added enough crumbs in to bind it, then went from there.  Very easy, and tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very unusual but Very good and healthy.  I don't like celery so I used roasted red peppers and added shredded cheese and roasted garlic to the patties.  I also baked them instead of frying them.  For a different twist I have even dipped them in egg and coated them in panko crumbs.  Next time I am going to try a mix of turnip and carrot. What could be easier?  A great way to fool kids into eating their veggies.

Could not get the burgers to stay together. It was frustrating. Added another egg and more crushed cornflakes but still no luck. It was slop. I may try to make these again using some suggestions, shred the carrots add raw, add some bread crumbs and let sit for a while before attempting to form into patties.

Really great burgers. I also shredded my carrots and had no issues at all with them holding together. This made 4 burgers and 1 little one for us. Had them with all the fixings so tried a little piece on its own, delicious! Crispy on the outside and gooey in the middle. Will definitely make again.

These were amazing. A food processor is going to come in phenomenally handy for this recipe. I never expected these to taste so good. I plan to make them often and freeze some for the future. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I was looking for an alternative to regular burgers and i had a ton of carrots from the farmers market, so i thought i'd try this. It was great!I shredded thae carrot and celery, as suggested. We didn't have cornflakes so i decided to use a mixture of breadcrumbs and bran. After mixing half of it in i remembered that we had lays sour cream and onoin chips, so i crushed them up and added them. I also added shredded bell pepper and som season salt. Everyone loved them! Some reviewers used celery seed instead of the real thing, but i found that celery gave it a distinct flavor that went well with the carrot,don't make the substitution. If you want to grill these like (or with) regular burgers, put a sheet of foil over the grill and cook them on it for twice as long on each side.

Yum!  These were great.  I made them exactly as the recipe was written.  The mixture seemed like it would be too moist to form a patty which would hold its shape, and I did have to handle the patties really delicately until they were cooked, but once they were cooked they were fine.  I served them like regular burgers on a bun with mustard, mayo, ketchup, tomato and cheese.  The patties were wonderfully moist and every bit as good as a meat patty in my opinion.  Next I'll have to try them on my carnivore husband and fussy son.

So, so, SO DELICIOUS!  I eat alot of "Morningstar Farms" veggie burgers, and these are SO MUCH BETTER.  I served them on buns with mayo and some American cheese melted on top.  The whole family loved them (even my meat-eating hubby). =D

These are amazing! I have two batches out of the pan, haven't even finished cooking them all, and have already started picking at the already cooked ones and CAN NOT wait to eat. I did have a problem with my mixture being a little runny/soggy, so I added in a few handfuls of crushed saltine crackers and that really helped a lot. Next time I make these I will just skip the cornflakes and go straight for the saltines like I do with salmon and tuna patties. Thanks for the recipe!

SOO yummy! A very good recipe, although I would recommend shredding the carrots instead of dicing them. The first time i made them I diced them, and they held together fairly well, but the second time I shredded them and they held together wonderfully! I love the crunchiness and the flavor is wonderful! Plus, you can't beat how inexpensive they are to make!!

The taste was just okay- it was pretty sweet from the carrots. I used a combination of corn meal and oats because I didn't have cornflakes, but I did have problems getting it to stick together. I added some mushrooms and sauteed them in olive oil with garlic, onions and parsley. I'd add some barbeque sauce next time. The second day the burgers firmed up and had a great texture.

Excellent recipe! I've been searching for a veggie-type burger recipe and decided to try this one. My family, kids included, loved them, served on a bun. I chose to mash the carrots after boiling them and instead of cornflakes I used a combination of seasoned breadcrumbs and rolled oats (both ideas thanks to other reviewers). I also used a red onion for lots of sweet flavor. Will definitely make again.

These were fantastic!  As someone who's easing into more vegetarian cooking, they were perfect.  I changed it just a bit, added more onion since I didn't have celery, and I wrapped them in lettuce leaves rather than eating them on a hamburger bun.  Will make these often!

These were fast, easy, and they tasted fantastic! The corn flakes add just the right amount of sweetness. I put in a bit more onion than called for and I think that made it even better. I will definitely be making these again!

These were great.  I was just looking for something different to do with carrots instead of a veggie burger.  I used coconut oil and green onions and added some garlic as suggested.  I'll enjoy subst. different cereals, change the spicing some--have lots of fun making and eating from this recipe!
