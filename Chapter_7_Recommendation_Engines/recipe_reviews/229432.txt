A perfect way to use the remains of my Greenburg smoked turkey.  Very easy to make and so very tasty.  I do find that this makes way more than 8 servings.

Quite good. The folks at the table loved it. My only suggestion would be to cut back on the rice...it will expand.

My family could not get enough of it! I didn't have a turkey or carcass, so I just diced smoked turkey from the store and used chicken broth. Which also saved a couple of hours. It came out great. Making it a second time this week, as well.

Way better than the chicken rice soup I had at Panera today. I had a smoked turkey carcass in the freezer leftover from Thanksgiving, googled it and this came up. So glad it did. It was very good. I did make a few changes, I didn't have green beans so omitted those. Also, I used 1 cup of long grain wild rice instead of the white. I think next time I may leave the corn and green beans out and use chopped broccoli. Will make again. :)
(Oh and I sliced the carrots as pictured instead of shredding them and used 8 oz. of Velveeta cheese instead of cheddar.)

Wonderful!  It might be my favorite soup now.  Followed the recipe but added a little water at the end to  improve consistency.

The photo above is a big globbie mess, and a poor representation of this soup!  Its very delicious! I used frozen green beans, no corn, and by all means use more broth or less rice.  The smokey flavor is awesome, the cheeses make a creamy delight, but for my son in law who cant eat dairy, its all delicious without the cheese.

I cooked the turkey carcass overnight in the slow cooker. I omitted the green beans and used velveeta. Taste great. Will make again. Used all left over veggies from Thanksgiving relish tray. A great way to use all of the leftovers

Just made this and happy to say it is really good. After cooking the turkey carcass  I  sauteed my celery, onions and red bell pepper along with the rice.  Added it to the pot and Cooked everything for 20 min.  Added the cheeses.  Will be making this a lot more often.  It also reminded me of a pot pie filling.

Easy preparation and thick creamy soup. Will certainly make it again. I need to add more salt next time as I forgot to add it initially. Very hearty soup that is enough for a meal.

This smoked turkey soup is a winner.  In addition to the recipe, I added a teaspoon of salt.

I smoked two turkeys and I wish I had smoked two more.  I only used about a pound of white meat in the soup.

The cream cheese and cheddar really brought it all together.

Good soup, great way to use up left over turkey. I added some additional seasonings and cooked the rice on the side than added it in the last 30 minutes of cooking.

Made this recipe with my smoked turkey. I posted the picture above. everyone loved it! its a very tasty dish. I didn't use any of the bell peppers though because my wife doesn't like those. The "soup" was more of a pot pie filling consistency. very hearty and rib sticking good. I used 48 oz of swanson chicken broth and 1.5 cups of water. if you want more a liquid consistency you should add much more broth and water. or use half a cup of rice.
