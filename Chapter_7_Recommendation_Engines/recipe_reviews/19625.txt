Absolutely delicious! We didn't use the meat tenderizer and won't in the future. We cut the salt down to 1 tsp. We also used 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper instead of black pepper. Put it in a gallon sized ziplock bag with 5 lb. of organic drumsticks and squeezed the air out, marinated for 6 hours, then grilled it over a charcoal fire. A really nice recipe!

Excellent!  I used boneless skinless breasts for this.  The chicken was tender and flavorful.  I do have one complaint...too much salt.  I would cut the salt by at least half, if not more.  It didn't make the chicken too salty, it just made the salt flavor overwhelm the other spices.

Almost identical to a recipe given me by an Indian friend. I omit the meat tenderizer  and use chicken thighs or goat meat(which is traditional). Re marinating: 2 tips. Cut a slash into the chicken pieces, then use your hands to smush the marinade into all crevices. Second tip: Put the chicken and marinade into a ziplock bag for at least overnight in the fridge. I have also frozen the chicken at this point, then thawed out at later time.

Maybe i should have brushed off some of the marinade but it tasted too much like cumin. I was expecting to taste some of the other spices in the marinade, but alls I could taste was cumin. The chicken was moist, but not what I was expecting. I will not make this again.

I made this for my family, and it was a hit.  We eat alot of chicken, and get tired of the same old things.  Be sure to marinade as long as you can.  I used bone in breasts, tonight i'll trya it again with skinless boneless breasts...delicious.

We were delighted to find a tandoori-like recipe so we could enjoy it at home.  It is wonderful.  Just make it up the night before to allow enough marinade time for the flavor to develop.

Great recipe - Great dish!  Five stars for certain!  I cut up chicken thighs, and marinated overnight in the refrigerator until dinner time the next day.  I threaded the chicken onto skewers with some onion chucks, and grilled them.  We LOVED the glorious Indian flavors that came through!  Thanks much for the recipe, Karen...

It was a bit salty. I removed the chicken from the bones and served it in pita bread with lettuce,tomato and caesar dressing. My husband thought it was great.

I reduced the salt down to 3/4 tablespoon and used bone-in thighs. It had a delicious flavor, probably the closest to tandoori possible in a home kitchen! It was cold and rainy outside, so I just baked it at 350 deg. for 1 hr.  Chicken was juicy. My husband loved it!! (I just noticed that the narrative doesn't mention adding the black pepper or garlic and I, therefore, left them out.
Flavor was great nevertheless!!

Excellent! Big hit with everyone, even the pickiest guests and children loved it. Mellow flavors, not overpowering. Very moist and tender. I put marinade together day before, and added chicken evening before cooking. Doubled the amount of chicken but had plenty of marinade. Will definitely make again!

We live in a highly Indian populated area with access to some pretty good take out, so this was unimpressive to us... with that said I haven't found a better recipe yet.

I was testing new cookware, so I used a completely different cooking method, but I wanted a nice spice combination for a chicken to go with a curry potato side. This was PERFECT. I omitted the yoghurt on account of allergies, rubbed the chicken with lemon juice and followed with the spices. Absolutely succulent flavor!

Delicious...I had to baked the chicken instead of grilling it becaue it  wouldn't stop raining in Atlanta and I just couldn't wait.  Didn't use the meat tenderizer.  Don't like the stuff and just whisked  ingriedents in a bowl.  I used Greek yogurt, that's all I had,  I also used a Tandoori barbeque masala from the local Indian market.  Worked fine.  Had most of the spices called for in this recipe in the pack and what wasn't in there I just added. Personally, I would have liked a little more spice, maybe a little chile powder.  The skin on the chicken was to die for...Excellent.  I served it with Basmati Rice.  Can't wait to give it a try on the grill.

This recipe, I agree had too much salt.  I made it verbatum using drumsticks and thighs. Next time I would omit the tenderizer, decrease salt by half.  I would reserve some of the marinade as a dipping sauce, warmed up of course.  We grilled the chicken and it had nice carmelization and charred flavor from the crunchies,

Yummy! I made sure to marinate this a full 24 hours to maximize the flavors. Didn't add the cilantro, family doesn't like that all. I even rubbed the paste made before all the yogurt underneath the skin. Unfortunately, coals were not warm enough and it didn't get as crispy as I wanted. But it  was good and I imagine when it is cooked over higher heat like it should, it'll be great!

I was sure excited to make this - a recipe right up my alley.  The end result was pretty disappointing, though.  I think I'd remove the skin from the chicken the next time - the flavour didn't make it past the cooking process.  It sure SMELLED good, though...

I thought this recipe tasted fabulous.  The flavors were fantastic.  I did not have any meat tenderizer, but it didn't seem to need it.  My only complaint was that the chicken was an unappetizing bright yellow color with blackened grilled stripes.  I sprinked it with some paprika and chopped cilantro to try to pretty it up, to not much success.  The taste made up for it though.

Everyone loved it!  Marinated overnight and all day the next day.  The only change I would make is not put all the stuff in a blender.  A lot of the spices stuck to the inside of the blender.

Used the recipe for a barbeque and the chicken turned out just delicious. I used the remaining marinade to keep the chicken moist while it cooked. 

Many thanks for the lovely recipe!

EASY and DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  I didn't use the meat tenderizer (don't have any), cilantro (out of that, too) and the yogurt (to cut down on calories).  I broiled the chicken in the oven and it was still fantastic.
