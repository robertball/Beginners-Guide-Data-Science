I've made these for years.  Everytime I make them they are the first app to go.  I haven't tried with the cajun seasoning but will next time.  One thing to add is finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese stuffed right on top of the cream cheese and before you wrap in the bacon.  ALTERNATE COOKING METHOD:  Bake at 350 for about 25-30 minutes until the bacon is nearly done then broil them for about 5 minutes to crisp up the bacon.  WATCH them when they are broiling so they don't burn.  If you just broil them, I find the bacon comes out charred in some places and fatty and limp in others, and you don't have to flip them with this method.  Also, cook on a rack with a cookie sheet so they are not sitting in the rendered fat of the bacon.....I've done these 30+ times and expierimented with the cooking method.

Fantastic twist to the usual jalapeno popper. After reading reviews I pulled it off like this: 
Did all the recommended prep plus baked the jalapenos for 15 minutes at 350 to lessen the heat. Let them cool a couple of minutes so I could handle them and filled them with a mixture of 1/2 tub of whipped cream cheese, 1/4 cup or so of cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup parmesean cheese, and 1 teaspoon seasoning (Costco no salt seasoning). Took the 1/2 slice of bacon, wrapped it around and put them cheese side up in the 350 oven. Change it to low broil and kept an eye on them for 5-10 minutes until the cheese started to brown and the bacon was lightly crisped. Heaven, heaven, heaven!!! There was a little crunch in the jalapeno which was nice so you got a couple of good bites without dragging the filling all out. Enough heat in the jalapeno to be flavorful and not burn your tongue off so you can't taste the next one. Delish! Will certainly do this again and again and again!

These are fantastic!!  I also added some chopped pineapple and garlic powder to the cream cheese.  Everyone loved them!  Also added a sprinkle of brown sugar over the bacon for extra yum.  Just used plain bacon.  Rather than broiling, bake at 350 for 40-45 minutes to take out some of the bite of the peppers.

Here in Texas it seems every store has the jalapeno bacon.  If you cannot find it at your local grocer you can purchase the bacon online

OK, rule of thumb, the smaller the Jalapeno, the hotter it is. Use gloves to seed the peppers, else you get the oils on your hands and hurt for some time. I cut strips of bacon in half before wrapping. I sprinkled onion and garlic powder and dried cilantro  over the cream cheese before wrapping. Did this in a toaster over on broil.

Super yummy and easy. For a lil' smoked flavor just broil them till bacon is getting cooked n then throw them on the gril for the last 5-8 minutes. It gives them a savory grilled flavor and is especially easy when you are already grilling anyway. Also, they freeze well so you can prepare to thrill guests ahead of time. Just prepare as instructed toothpick n all and freeze them instead of cooking them. Thaw and cook when you want.

My family loves this. I find is faster to just lay and push  the bacon into the cream cheese a little to make it stick  on top, that way the bacon is crisp all over.  A little chopped mango or pineapple in the cream cheese gives it a good twist.

These are wonderful! I made a double batch for a party last night and they were a huge hit! I could not find jalapeno bacon so I used pepper bacon instead and I made half of them using pineapple cream cheese. I do recommend using gloves to seed the peppers, however...especially if you are a contact lens wearer! (Ouch!!)

I make these all the time only my recipe doesn't call for cajun seasoning, never thought to try that. I will be though!!! Also I use peppered bacon. Found they turn out the best that way!! If you scoop the seeds out you will find they are less spicy for those who can't do heat!

I also have made these for years.  The only thing that I do differently is I leave the pepper whole and before I put the cream cheese filling in the pepper, I squeeze into the tip of the pepper just a tiny bit of raspberry jelly (have used strawberry and red plum too, but raspberry is best)so your last bite has a very pleasant surprise in store. Give it a try in at least a couple of them and see what you think.

Gray streaks on the peppers warn HOT!!!!!   You want milder?  Look for smooth shiny green skins.

A most excellent recipe!  

After washing, splitting, and seeding the jalapeno peppers, I lightly brushed them with extra virgin olive oil to add an extra zing to the harvest.  I used a chive & onion flavored cream cheese to fill the halves of peppers and gave them a few  generous shakes (two, three, four, five shakes, depending on your individual tastes) of Old Bay seafood seasoning.  Love that Old Bay seasoning!  Here's a tip: sprinkle Old Bay on hot, freshly, fried French Fried potatoes.  Your tummy will thank you.  

Wrapped the filled peppers with cracked, black peppered bacon and secured with toothpicks.  Baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes then moved the rack to the highest level to broil for five minutes.  

Wooooooo, Buddy!!!  These were out of this world!  Better than anything I've gotten at a restaurant.  These Stuffed Jalapeno Firecrackers will cause an explosion of flavors in your mouth which will leave your tongue tingling with delightful pleasures.  Seriously, these were great.  Thanks to Templina for submitting this outstanding recipe.  Never thought I could prepare and cook such quality food which would rival a restaurant.  It's a beautiful day!

I think I will go and make some more to enjoy later.

I've been making these for years after my Texas friends turned me on to the recipe.  They called them "Texas Poppers".  The ingrediants are very flexible, and I use an envelope of taco seasoning for each 8 oz. of cream cheese.  I also bake these in the oven at 350 degrees on parchment, which soaks up the bacon fat.  Bake them till the bacon is crispy for the best flavor.  Another version is to schmeer each jalapeno half with cream cheese and then put the halves back togeher before wrapping the bacon around.  Lastly, and this will seem excessive except with the people who REALLY love hot, do it with a Habenero - seeds and membrane removed -  you will be surprised hor the citrus flavor of the habanero plays off of the bacon.

REGARDLESS....these appetizers are wonderful!!! :D  enjoy...just be careful!!!!

To neutralize your hands after handling peppers, clean with any citrus. 
I always end my salsa with the lime as it is part of the recipe and makes my hands eye safe.

YUMMY!  I love the addition one reviewer stated to use relish, I couldn't find the one stated, but used sweet pickle relish instead and WOW! Jalapenos, cream cheese, cajun seasonings and sweet pickle relish wrapped in bacon is outstanding! So good!

My husband has made these in a different version for years.  We have a lot of friends that like them but don't like the blast of heat they get so he removes the seeds and membranes at their request before stuffing them.  This is easily done with a grapefruit spoon even if you cut them in half.  He likes to cut them in half so they will lay flat then put a little precooked sausage (or whatever sounds good to you)in them, a thick slice of Cream Havarti* cheese and top with a half slice of lean bacon.  Bake in a 400 degree oven until the bacon is done and serve.  You will still have some heat but not a lot and a lot of people will able to eat them that would not the other way.  If you want them hotter then don't remove all of the seeds and membrane.  He never has any leftovers to bring home!

*Havarti cheese melts very well so don't make the slices so big that it melts and runs into the cooking pan.  If you crumple some foil and put it in your pan it will hold the peppers so they don't tilt and lose the stuffing.  Non-stick foil works great for this dish.

Sounds awesome, I don't like to write a review if I haven't tried it, but I just know they will be awesome, my only problem is I wondered where to get Jalapeño bacon? I've never heard of it. And if I can find it I will  buy it for sure!

I've been making these for years , LOVE 'EM ! I like to mix a cup of shredded Cheddar in with the cream cheese. I've also added things like chopped shrimp , mushrooms , clams ect... I've also found it best to freeze these before cooking, this allows the bacon to cook before the cheese mix runs out , Start cooking them face down and then flip when bacon is browned ...addressing the heat issue : save the seeds and membrane when cleaning these ... mix with about a tablespoon of water in a small blender ( I have the bullet ) add about a tablespoon ( adjust to taste )of this VERY HOT mixture to the cheese mixture , this is the best way I've found to control the heat ;) .......... These can be made on the grill too ;)

I like spicy, but I think fresh jalapenos are sometimes a little too spicy. I seeded the jalapenos, which rendered them completely un-spicy. I should have known better. I also had trouble getting the bacon crispy to my liking. I baked at 350 for 20 min. first to crisp up the bacon and to help with the jalapeno heat,  which wasn't an issue at all. It was mostly crispy but in some places still fatty and raw-looking. I used a broiler pan so the fat could drip off and it would crisp up better. I thought it wouldn't need turned in that case, but I was wrong. I didn't put on much cajun spice because again, I didn't want it to be too spicy. Next time I will leave some seeds and membranes in, will use larger jalapenos, and will add more cajun spice. I will still bake first, but I will flip them often to get all sides evenly crispy. Overall a good recipe but I was slightly disappointed.

These are excellent. My husband and friends love them.  The Cajun seasoning makes them even better than the ones without this seasoning.  I made only one change and that is only because I didn't have the jalapeno bacon so I just used regular bacon.  Gloves recommended, but if you don't have gloves wash your hands a lot.  Enjoy!!!

Excellent recipe, I made these for the first time last week since then I've made them once more. I've tweaked the recipe a bit and added fresh garlice and crab meat and they turned out well.

Great recipe! It was very easy to prepare. Make sure to use gloves when seeding the jalapenos so the oils don't get on your hands (very painful.. for a long time). I mixed cumin, garlic powder, cilantro and mexican cheese blend with the cream cheese before wrapping it in bacon. I think it didn't need to be broiled for 8 minutes on each side.  A couple of the pieces of bacon were almost cooked too much. It was a great appetizer and everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

My own version of this recipe:  stuffed deseeded peppers (use gloves!) with sharp shredded cheedar cheese and canned tuna.  You can use salmon instead of tuna also.  Everyone loves!

I make this frequently. The big difference with mine is that I brown a pound of sausage, drain and mix with the cream cheese. It is amazing. Sometimes I will sprinkle cheese on after they are done. Not diet friendly, but it is really good. I have also wanted to make it and been really short on time, so I put the cream cheese and sausage mix in, layer on the peppers, (you can use any peppers, not just jalapenos. My brother in law likes them with goat horn peppers, my husband like pablano and a guy I work with changed it to bell peppers.) Then layer baco on top and bake at 350 for about 30 to 45 minutes, when bacon is done.

Made these today for a family BBQ and they were gone before I had a chance to put them down.  I used regular bacon and baked them at 350 degrees for 30 min.  I also sprinkled them with brown sugar after I pulled them out of the oven.  It added a sweetness to the pepper which complimented it really well.  I'm gonna make this for every gathering I go to.  :)  Will try mixing the cream cheese with crab next time.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for the recipe!!!!!!

I took another reviewers suggestion and cooked at 350 for 20-ish minutes then broiled them off. I love the cajun seasoning addition...these were fantastic and cooked to perfection! Thanks!

Yum! Very spicy and I didn't even use jalapeno bacon (never seen such a thing here). I used Neufatchel cream cheese & turkey bacon. Hubby loved the addition of the Cajun seasoning. Thanks :)

Really good base recipe.  I made just a few tweaks - I used maple bacon and mixed a couple tablespoons of brown sugar with an equal amount of barbecue sauce for basting the peppers right near the end of baking.  I filled the whole peppers with cream cheese and wrapped with bacon, instead of doing half-peppers.  I was worried about the poppers being too hot for a mixed crowd, so I baked them for about a half hour total, instead of broiling, and they came out sweet and mellow and delicious, but I don't know how hot the peppers were to start with.  Next time I make them, I think I'll reduce the baking time to keep more of the heat and keep the peppers more crisp.  At any rate, these were great!  Thanks.

GREAT RECIPE! These are perfect for any occasion or as an appitizer at dinner.  I used fat free cream cheese and mccormick spicy seasoning.  I've made them 3 times since I found the recipe and have yet to find jalapeno bacon, but have found regular thick cut bacon works well.  I broil for 5 minutes then bake at 350 for 25minutes.  Bacon comes out crisp and jalapenos aren't as powerful.  The whole family loves this recipe!!

My husband requests these for any type of gathering we have.  I add garlic powder and crushed pineapple as suggested by another reviewer.  I also sprinkle brown sugar on the bacon before I wrap them (also suggested by the reviewer).  I never have leftovers.  Once cooked and cooled, I refrigerate them before serving.  Something about the chilling of the final product brings it up a notch.  One of my favorite things to make!

For those that can't handle too much heat, try using the miniature bell peppers. I make some with jalapenos & some with the mini peppers. Another variation: mix the cream cheese with cooked, crumble sausage & grated parmesan cheese, stuff the peppers & bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes.

These are now a regular event at family gatherings.  Highly recommend you cut a stick of sharp cheddar and place on top of the cream cheese for extra flavor.

Im a Texan and have been making these for years, every family get together we make them by the 100's because they are so tasty. Instead of cajun seasoning we use cream cheese with flaked crab meat and FRESH jalapeno peppers, they have a much better taste and easier to work with. Here we call them armadillo eggs and no bbq, picnic or any other thing we all do together would be complete without Dilla Egss

I've made ones like this several times and ALWAYS a huge hit!!  We love them! Except the recipe I follow has 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese mixed in the cream cheese.  And instead of mixing cajun seasoning into the cream cheese, I mix chili powder (and I think you could use cajun seasoning too) with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and sprinkle this on top of bacon wrapped peppers.  So good!!

These were loved among my friends! I created a vegetarian alternative by using some TVP instead of bacon, and mixing the hydrated TVP with Cajun seasoning.

These are very good! I did not change anything but, I did not have Jalapeno bacon and regular bacon was fine. I used Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning. (Walmart carries it) I like to try a recipe from it's original the first time and then tweek it the next time to make it even better. Thank you for sharing your recipe. Yummmmy!!

I added crushed pineapples to the cream cheese & beat it for a few minutes. I also added some sugar to taste to the cream cheese/pineapple. I don't think you need to cut the bacon in half unless you have small peppers. Depends on how you like to wrap them. I like mine wrapped completely. Then I sprinkled brown sugar on the bacon. DELICIOUS!

My friends and family love this recipe, however, we are not big fans of bacon so instead we put prosciutto on top, not wrapped around the jalapeno,  and we slow cook them on the grill, they are awesome.

Love this recipe. These don't last very long after they're pulled from the oven. After all the prep I bake them at 350° for 30 mins then broil them for 3-5 mins. They're perfect!

You might would like to try parboiling the peppers for about six minutes. Let them cool. Split them and scrape out the seeds. Add the cream cheese and then lay a shrimp on the bed of cheese. Wrap them with the bacon,insert toothpicks and grill them. Just have the ice cold beer ready when they come off the grill. Yummy!

Amazing and simple!  I added some twists on my next attempt: Into the cream cheese I mixed in shredded sharp cheddar cheese (replace ounce for ounce to keep it proportional) and some taco seasoning. I also re-mixed the jalapeno seeds into the cheese mixture.  Lastly I used Dave's BBQ chicken seasoning on top to help get a smokier taste to it.  Also followed the other recommendation of cooking to 350 to soften up the pepper and then put it to broil to crisp up the bacon.

I have made these a number of times and every one loves them.  In fact when I have a party, "doubters" who are coaxed into trying them come back to get some and they are already gone.  I have found that leaving too many seeds makes them too hot for most folks so I only leave a few seeds.  The mild side I find are even milder if you rinse them thoroughly before stuffing.  Love them.  Next time I am going try the brown sugar - yum - makes me salivate just thinking about them!

I've had something similar at Christmas parties the last two years, except the host used yellow cheese.  The kicker to her poppers was that she sprinkled them with brown sugar when they came out of the oven.  These are so good!

These are "da bomb".  Jalepeno bacon isn't available in the small, rural town I live in so have made a couple of varients.  The first is using peppered bacon with some extra freshly ground tellicherry peppercorns.  With this one I also added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes (I like things really hot :-) ) to the cream cheese.  The second varient was to use the brine from some jalepeno rings and I tried marinating the bacon strips in this.  Between the two I preferred the first variation.  I hope someday to find some jalepeno bacon so I can trie this exactly as the recipe is written.

The size of the jalapenos vs the length of bacon is vital.  Too small, have to cut bacon in odd lengths, to big and bacon requires multiple tooth picks.  Try adding sun dried tomatoes to the cream cheese.

I made these for our July 4th party.  OMG they were so good.  Could not stop eating them.  We grilled these instead of using the broiler.  They were perfect.

This recipe was awesome - I made it for Easter Dinner and the whole family raved about it.  I used the garden philly cream cheese, seasoned with some lawrys & added green onions.  Not too hot - actually I would have loved it to be hotter!

Thesse are a Texas staple for any Bar-B-Q!!  Many different ways to make them and are always delicious!  Jalapeno bacon not required but I do reccomend using the thinest and cheapest sliced bacon you can find.  Makes for a better crispness of the bacon.  I almost always grill them but this can lead to a mess so takes a bit of technique.  ENJOY!!

definitely a hit. made a couple of modifications. after following the original recipe exactly, added diced jalapenos to the cream cheese and mixed in the cajun seasoning instead of just sprinkling on top. made all the difference in the world!! Excellent

Love these guys... Blanch the peppers first before cutting & stuffing.  Try adding some cooked & crumbled sausage to the cream cheese before stuffing. When the firecrackers come out of the oven, drizzle a little honey on them before serving.(yum...yum...)

These are awesome! Like some others, I would suggest baking for about 30 minutes...it helps cut back on the heat a bit. Also, Philadelphia makes different flavors of their cream cheese spread. The Garden Vegetable and Pineapple flavors are to die for and add even more layers of flavor to this fantastic appetizer.

This recipe is good, but can be significantly improved with a couple of simple changes.

After filling the jalapeno with cream cheese, place some seasoned pulled pork on top of the cream cheese layer.  The amount of pulled pork should be enough to make the jalapeno look like a complete pepper, generally about an ounce.  Then wrap with the strip of bacon.  Rather than using cajun spice, use a general purpose BBQ rub (like Mike Mills Magic Dust) that will be less salty as the bacon doesn't really need more salt.  Bake (or hot smoke) at 350 rather than broil.  It'll take at least 45 minutes for the bacon to cook sufficiently and for the capsicum in the pepper to break down so they aren't too spicy.  These are commonly known in competitive BBQ circles as ABT's.  Try them this way just once, you'll love the results.

These are soooooo good! I couldn't stop eating them. I folloelwed someone else's suggestion & cooked in oven @ 350 for 25 min on a rack sprayed w veg spray on top of cookie sheet then broil for 3 - 5 min. & put some fresh shredded cheddar on top of cream cheese. I will make these again & again. Easy too! Oh by the way, also used precooked (boxed) bacon & it worked out great :) enjoy!

Been making these things for over a decade. Only with 8 oz of cream cheese, I can stuff 25 medium peppers that have been hollowed out (whole pepper with seeds and pith removed) with a full strip of thin bacon wrapped around them and then smoked @ around 275° F for 3 hours. I prefer to use cherry wood.  Turning them about every half hour.  They come out mild with a great Jalapeno taste.  When I take these to a party, they are the first thing gone.  I think I get invited to some parties because of my poppers.
25 small to medium jalapenos
8 oz cream cheese
25 slices thin sliced bacon
core peppers, stuff with cream cheese, leave about 1/4" unstuffed at the end to allow for expansion, wrap bacon from end to end and then around pepper and smoke, turning every half hour.

We've been making these for 6 years now and they are awesome. I am always requested to bring them to functions. I alternate with the fillings depending on the items available in my fridge. Sometimes I'll mix a tbsp or so of leftover spinach dip with the cream cheese or asiago and artichoke dip or both, and throw in some grated cheddar and some dried onions or finely chopped chives with my spices then stuff and bacon wrap them. There are many creative ways to jazz these up. Anyway you do is always a hit! Don't forget to wear gloves when coring the peppers.

This is a great recipe! We all love it. I have also used mini red, orange, and banana peppers for people who don't like jalapenos. Also, I've mixed the cream cheese with jamaican jerk seasoning and 3 tble crushed pineapple. The sweet and spicy combo is awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

I have made these for years, but I put small pieces of chicken breast inside the jalapeno before wrapping "plain" bacon around the chile.  We call them "chicken butts".  You can also throw the on the grill, they are done when the bacon is done.

These are phenomenal.  I followed the recipe, but did add some precooked turkey sausage with the cheese mixture, and did a combination of baking and broiling, to get the peppers nicely done and bacon browned.  Don't hesitate to make these -- they are wonderful.  I'm now thinking about doing the same thing with poblanos and/or cubans for a "bigger" serving.  OUTSTANDING recipe!

Excellent. I did half hot with seeds and half without seeds. I left the stems on those that were hot, and no stems on those milder. I did learn to only leave a few seeds for the hot ones, as I left too many seeds and they were quite hot even for those that like hot stuff. Everyone actually loved them, even the hot ones.

I mixed an Italian cheese blend shredded cheese along with the real bacon pieces with a little garlic salt with the cream cheese before I stuffed the pepper and then wrapped them with more bacon!!!! Delicious!!!

Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe! I placed the halved, stuffed, wrapped peppers on racks, which were placed on foil-lined baking sheets in a 350 degree oven. Baked 45 minutes and they came out beautifully with crisp bacon. Hubby and I loved them and will be serving at our next barbeque. Once you start eating these, it's hard to stop.

I made these tonight for my husband and he was raving about them and asking why we haven't made these sooner!! We didn't have actual Cajun seasoning so we used Chipotle seasoning instead.  We also took the advice of another reviewer to use 350 degrees for about 30, then broiling for 5 more since we don't like our bacon burnt.  We'll definitely be making these again! Thanks for the recipe.

If you were even considering this recipe, JUST MAKE IT!!! It's quick and easy, and anyone that likes a spicy bite will be throwing you compliments. But be sure to wear gloves while you prep, or get that fresh capsaicin oil off your skin quickly!! We couldn't find the jalapeno bacon, but were able to find jalapeno cream cheese, which turned out to be a equitable substitution. We're making this one again real soon! We modified the directions just a bit, using Boar's Head deli style bacon (the perfect cut - not too thick or thin), cutting each strip in half to wrap once around each jalapeno half. A pound of bacon yielded 2 dozen pepper halves with a few stips of bacon left over for 'quality assurance' tasting. :)

These really are hot, just like the recipe states, but they have great flavor. Will mix up the leftovers into a dip adding some more ingredients, and bake to decrease the heat.

I've made these several times to the specifications in the recipe.  YUM!  MY only advice would be to wear gloves when handling the raw jalapenos if you have sensitive skin.  The first time I did not wear gloves, and my hands burned for about 12 hours afterward.  (Used a rub of damp sugar to alleviate the burn...made my hands soft, too.) Other than that, these are awesome!

I have been making these for years now, never put cajun seasoning with them.  I usually add a pack of dry Ranch dressing to an 8oz cream cheese, stuff, then wrap 1/2 piece bacon around the jalapeno.   They are great, I will have to try them with the cajun seasoning. NOTE: WEAR GLOVES WHEN HANDLING THE JALAPENO!!!!!!!!!!

So Good! I brought these to a get together and they were immediately gobbled up!! Was asked to bring them to the next get together again! I doubled the recipe and they were still one of the first apps to go! Even people who don't really like super spicy foods find these to their liking.

These are great and the best food to cook on the grill for those who love spice.  For an added kick for my family, we finely chop fresh habanero peppers and add it to the cream cheese.

I didn't have gloves so I used sandwhich bags, no burns. I will say do not put them face down, maybe precook the bacon that way you dont have to flip them. They were very spicy. Not like the poppers you get at the store. My boyfriend loved them! I could only eat one. Next time I will use a little crushed pineapple in the cream cheese.

I made these as a starter for a mexican themed party and my friends loved them!!! The cream cheese cuts the spice and makes it sooo creamy. I put some dried onions in the cream cheese filling before wrapping them with bacon.... it is a fun recipes that you can customized and put whatever you want in the filling. double yum

These are great, and definitely hot! I couldn't find jalapeno bacon, so I just used regular. I would recommend putting the broiler on low to prevent the skins from burning. I will definitely be making these often!

Great recipe, I made these as an afternoon snack and loved them! I would reccomend not going all out on cream cheese unless you just want a ton of it. I enjoy it lightly spread. I couldn't find jalapeno bacon in my grocery, but normal bacon still tasted great! I would suggest this to a friend for sure!

These are AWESOME. Took them to a party and all of them were gone. I used thick sliced bacon and would not suggest this. It was hard to get them fully wrapped around my gigantic jalapenos. With a little practice, I'll have the perfect bacon wrapped popper!

Delicious!  After the first go 'round, I've decided next time to cut the bacon in half, not thirds as they rather shrunk up more than I planned for. My DH adored them too, and was really appreciative!

I’ve made these twice, and they are absolutely delicious! 
Instead of wrapping the bacon around the pepper, I just laid it across the top. 
You know they’re good when they’re all gone!

I blanched the peppers then mixed 1 Tbls dry ranch dressing into the cream cheese and attempted to bake at 450 but cheese was running out so I switched to close broil and they were a hit!! I also did 2 peppers with Goat cheese and cherry preserves which were excellent also.

Excellent. I've made this twice.  I followed one of the reviewer's advice and baked them for about a half hour, and then put them under the broiler for just a few minutes on each side to crisp the bacon. (I used regular bacon).

I changed the recipe only slightly.  After filling the jalapeno halves with cream cheese, I put them back together, then wrap the whole jalapeno with bacon and then secure it with toothpicks.  I also like to grill these on the grill for 15-20 minutes.  I think they taste better cooked on the grill. Also, the cajon seasoning isn't necessary- I don't use it.

Made these as an appetizer for Christmas dinner. OH. MY. GOD. There are no words. If you like bacon, if you like spicy, if you like cream cheese, you're literally missing out by not making this recipe. I wish there was a sixth star.

The only thing we did differently was that we kept the peppers whole.??

These were really good.   I used regular bacon, and I seeded the jalapeños so they were mild.   I also baked them on a rack  about 20 minutes at 400 degrees, and broiled for just a few minutes at the end to crisp the bacon.   Much better and easier than the deep-fried versions I have tried before.

Uno night at Gma and Gpops house and these were the hit of the night.  I took someone else's advice and added a few tablespoons of well drained pineapple to the cream cheese..  Scraped out the seeds and membranes from peppers (they don't call these "firecrackers" for no reason!!) and proceeded to stuff with cream cheese mixture.  I did fry the bacon to just beyond the raw stage but still limp and before it began to "shrink".   I then put them into a 350 degree oven and baked them for 30-35 minutes or until the bacon had become crispy (the pre-frying really helped to make the bacon crisp when they were all done).  No one hesitated to take the last one which ended up being divided between hubby and son-in-law!!  Excellent party food, game day,  card night, movie night..you name it.  We loved them and they will make a repeat appearance!!

If you have a smoker or don't mind turning your grill into one.  It's a whole other level.  Addictive.

Turns out my husband prefers cheddar.... *sigh* (I personally don't care much for these, but he loves jalapeno poppers....., so I made these ones for him..., IF you are like me, making them for someone else, you might ask which ones they prefer!

This recipe turned out fabulous. I put shredded cheese in the peppers and Cajun seasoning and then stuffed them with the cream cheese. And put he Cajun seasoning on top. I couldn't find jalapeno bacon, so I used peppered bacon and wrapped it around the peppers. I broiled it for about 8 mins or so, and I didn't have to flip it. The whole thing cooked very nicely, although the cream cheese did brown a bit too much on the top. It formed a kind of crust. But I just peeled it off and it was fine.

I make these alot for my family but I put a jumbo shrimp over the cream cheese before I wrap in bacon. I can't keep them cooked quickly enough as my family eats them right out of the oven.

I make this, but leave the peppers whole, and i also add a bit of chopped bacon, garlic, onion, and shredded cheddar to the cream cheese. i also fully wrap them in bacon, secured w/toothpicks and grill them on the bbq.

We have been making these for years. The only difference is that we also put a shrimp inside the jalepeno with the cream cheese and we grill them on the bbq. They are always a hit at our house.

Yummy and fun appetizer.  Where can I find jalapeno bacon?  It was not in my local super market (Safeway).  Is this something that is sold in specialty super markets?  I used regular bacon and it was still a yummy appetizer.  It was not that spicy for me but my boyfriend's mouth was on fire.  :-)

I make these and LOVE them!!! I don't stuff too much cheese in them as it will tend to drip out and I pre-cook the bacon a bit so it's really crisp around the jalapeno. We BBQ ours so easy clean up and give a little smokey flavor. I never make enough as they are gobbled up before I can get more on the table.

I have made these for years but i add garlic and actually cut the tops off and seed the jalepenos with a spoon. Sometimes we bake them and in the summer we grill them!!

Very good, perhaps adding more flavor in cream cheese would have boosted them to 5 stars but overall a very good app!

I tried these for a 4th of July party and they were a huge hit!  I live in Maine and could not find Jalapeno bacon so just used regular.  Instead of cajun seasoning I put in a package of dry ranch dressing mix as someone suggested.  I boiled the jalapenos first but won't next time as they weren't hot at all.  Quick and easy appetizer...will make again!

Huge hit on the Independence Holiday and my dad's 75th birthday party!  Not too hot, because I used larger peppers.  Definitely make again!

I'm glad the picture they sent in the email wasn't the one shown with the recipe itself.... if it was I never would of given this a second look.. Can't wait to try...
