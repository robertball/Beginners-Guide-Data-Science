While the final product tasted great, the journey there was long, sticky and very tedious.  I wouldnt recommend this recipe unless you've got the right equipment.

I tried making this, but the sauce still remained runny after trying to heat it to the "consistancy of cream". I'm not sure if I made it properly, but it didn't taste as great as I hoped.

The pears would not soft in the oven even though I increased the temp to 325. I ended up putting them in the microwave for 5 minutes on high and they soften up nicely. While thickening the sauce I increased the temp which helped get it there....Be careful though because the sauce will pass the creamy point and change to thick real quick. I noticed when I remove the sauce from the heat for a few seconds it thickened up. All in all this is a tastey recipe with poor directions.

The final product has a wonderful taste. However, the orange sauce does not heat to the consistency of cream.  I don't understand why you are to cook it for 40 minutes and then all of the sudden it should turn thick after cooking it a little more...I don't get it.  Anyway, an easy and delicious recipe.  I would make again...with a few changes.

This took much longer than 40 minutes to cook (maybe my pears were too firm)...next time I think I will set the oven @ 325. I reduced the orange juice at a higher temp than recipe called for & I added a little bit of cornstarch mixed in cold water...it thickened up beautifully. I think, that there was wayy too much chocolate (did I just say that? ;o)  ) & next time I will only melt 2 squares. I did not have bittersweet chocolate so I used semi-sweet instead. Also, next time I think I will just halve & core the pears because that's easier.  When all was said & done, this was a very tasty dessert. The orange sauce was terrific & went really well w/ the chocolate & pears. Thanks!

It seemed unlikely to me that 2 cups of cold juice could heat up, and cook pears, in a 300 F oven in a total of 30 to 40 minutes -- and it didn't. Next time I will pre-heat the orange sauce in a saucepan or microwave, then put in the oven with the pears. One can reduce the sauce quite quickly if one is stirring constantly, by using at least Medium heat, or slightly higher.

This dish has potential. The flavor and texture of the pear was great! I'd recommend using sweetened chocolate.

This was delicious.  Thanks to the reviews, I knew to allow more time in the oven for the pears and to use heat of 325 degrees F.  Prior reviewers noted that the sauce never thickened.  I had some orange water on hand and substituted the sugar in the orange juice with this.  The pears baked about an hour.  Every ten minutes I turned them, sprinkled a scant amount of sugar over them, and basted with the orange juice drippings.  They were finished baking before my guest arrived, which was before dinner!  I turned off the oven, placed tin foil over the pears in the baking dish, and left them in the oven to keep warm while we enjoyed dinner.  About an hour later I took them out and the glaze was perfect, just the right consistency.

This was pretty tasty. I read the over reviews so was prepared to augment the temperature. I baked the pears in a tagine in the oven at 180Â°. I made a couple of ingredient substitutions: agave syrup instead of sugar and  I also used Homemade Melt-In-Your-Mouth Dark Chocolate (Paleo) instead of industrial chocolate. It serves beautifully in a tagine and the flavour is unbeatable. Thank you for the recipe.
