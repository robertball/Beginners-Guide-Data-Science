This sounded like it was going to be great, but it was just kind of weird. Probably won't make it again.

My husband tried this recipe and it came out delicous. He found it very easy to prepare.  Instead of using garlic powder next time he will try fresh garlic. He may also try using hot green olives next time too.  The family liked this one very much.

I'm still new to cooking so this may have beeen a little too tricky for me to attempt.  But since my father used to work for Al Capone (the butcher) when he was a young man I had to give it a try.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe and memories!

My mom shopped in the North End when I was young and would order the pork "Al Capone Special" ... it was so sad that they didn't re-open the shop after the fire.. my mom still makes this (from memory) for special occassions... It's a family favorite!

Awesome roast for a quick weeknight meal or a busy Sunday.My husband isn't a fan of olives but he said he didn't even taste them and that it was tasty. Warning: If you don't like prosciutto,mortadella and olives I'd say stay away from this recipe and look for something else.

I made this recipe for the first time for 6 people and it was a huge hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe when they left and were still talking about it the next day.  I omitted the olives and mushrooms and do not feel they were missed.  I also substituted garlic powder for fresh minced garlic and really rubbed it into the meat.  All of my cast iron skillets have rubber handles that I did not want to put into the oven.  So I seared the roast on the stove, then put it into a Pyrex (2 qt) that I "Pammed" first.  I was nervous that this would affect the cooking time but it was perfect to the minute.  Can't wait to make it again!

This is very creative and different.  The first time I made it, it was a little salty, so I just cut down on the amount of the layered items (prosciutto & mortadella, mozz).  Fabulous flavors in my opinion.

I made this for my Wife and my Daughter came over with my Grandson, and all of them really enjoyed it. my Daughter asked me for the recipe so I printed it out for her.  My Wife said I am welcome to make something new every week if it is going to be this good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly with the exception of the mushroom and olive, I used an 8oz tub of fresh mushrooms ( sliced very thin) and a whole 6oz can of black olives otherwise exact quantities.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

I made this recipe several times a number of years ago for friends and family. We all loved it. To me it is just a larger version of Braciole. 

My friends and I used to buy both the pork and beef roast versions at Al Capone's Market in the North End and/or Haymarket Square located in Boston in the mid to late 70s. 

The original and this recipe are always a hit. We plan to make it again for our Christmas get together this year. We have been friends for 48 years. Lots of memories and especially memories of this roast. Yum!!!

If you are looking for a new way to make pork, This is it. In the Midwest where we don't often try new things, but WoW, it was absolutely AMAZING!!! It was inexpensive and the flavor of the pork was wonderful. Haven't used much pork steak in Italian cooking before and I paired it with a pasta dish. Can't wait to make again!
