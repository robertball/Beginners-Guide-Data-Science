Delicious.  Made with the freshest zucchini, yellow squash and corn from the farmers market.  I subbed canned San Marzano tomatoes for the romas because that's what I had on hand and because tomatoes are not in season.  Loved the southwestern flavors.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you Bibi for sharing this winning recipe! :)

What a wonderful summer time dish and a great way to cook squash.  I’ve made this at least a half  a dozen times already this summer and it’s turned into a real comfort food.  I’ve been doubling the recipe and eating the leftovers for lunch.  It’s the sweet corn and cilantro that keeps me going back for another bite.  The only change I make is that I do not add cumin.  The first time I made this, I was afraid the cumin would clash with something else that I made for dinner so I left it out.  We loved this so much without it that I can’t bring myself to add it.  I’m sure it would be good just the same.  Thank you, Bibi, for sharing your fantastic creation!

This is a great recipe! I used two zucchini because I couldn’t get the yellow squash, and used a 540ml can of ‘garlic and olive oil’ stewed tomatoes because that’s what I had. It’s so flavourful, not to mention quick and easy! I’ll definitely make this again.

I love this dish. In New Mexico it is called calabacitas. The one suggestion is to add some green chile.

This was a delightfully quick and simple dish to make. I modified the recipe slightly by adding 2 chicken breasts and a sliced avocado! I was able to influence a friend to make it too!

Oh my goodness, this was really good! Perfect blend of flavors for us! We did sub with a can of petite diced tomatoes (drained). Otherwise, made exactly as written. Perfect side along hubs tacos! I actually used this as a filling for my tacos and loved it! Thanks Bibi for giving me another veggie alternative for use in a main meal!

This is great! It works as a filling for veggie tacos. We don't have access to yellow squash so I used yellow bell peppers, ok-so, not the same but I did my best with what I had.  I also added some hot chili powder that went perfectly with the cumin and lime.  I even tossed the leftovers with pasta. Delicious !

Wonderful flavor that is greater than the sum of its parts. I used smoked cumin; man, the smell just goes right to my head! I didn't have zukes so used all yellow squash, yum yum. Bibi, I am so grateful :)

This recipe is wonderful. I didn't have any corn, but it was still great. I topped it with some guacamole I had made and it kicked it up a notch.

I am vegan and I made this for my lunch.  It was delicious!  I added peppers and mushrooms.  I will start making this often.

This was delicious! I used only zucchini, no corn, and I added just a touch of sugar. Ate it with mashed potatoes with a little garam masala added.

Delicious. I made this using fresh zucchini, squash, onion, and cilantro; 15oz can diced tomato and half 15oz can corn both drained; granulated garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, and lime juice all to taste. I don't know if it was the amount of veggies combined with diced chicken was a factor but I had at least twice as much cumin in finished dish.

Super yummy! I used 2 zucchinis because that's what I had on hand. They were about a week old and I wanted to use them before they went bad, which is why I chose this recipe as I had some somewhat tasteless corn to use as well and a tomato about to go bad. Perfect way to use all those things! You definitely don't have to follow the recipe exactly.

This recipe got a big thumbs up from hubs!  Followed the recipe exactly except I had to use frozen corn & lime juice from a bottle.  It was wonderful!  I'll be fixing this a lot as long as the squash keep coming in!  Thanks, Bibi :)
