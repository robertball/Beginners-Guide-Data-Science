I tried this for the first time using Tazo Organic Chai Tea and following the instructions except for the amount of milk.  And I believe I used too much hot water.  I'll need to try it as stated next time.  Pretty good and a whole lot more affordable than the coffee chain variety

I like a stronger flavored chai so I went easy on the milk, just enough to give it a milky flavor without diluting it. I also used one packet Splenda instead of granulated sugar. Very good.

This was quick and easy to make. I followed the directions exactly. My only issue with it was, after I added the milk to the hot tea it became room temperature. I was kind of wanting a warm beverage this morning. So, instead of reheating I just took it one step further and poured it over some ice. Make sure to have a large mug as it will be needed to hold the 1.5 cups of liquid. This was okay, but I think I like chai made with tea and spices separately. It's just stronger. This works though if pinched for time and you like Chai.

This is a pretty sweet version of Chai. I made it on the stovetop so that it would be as hot as possible. I brought the water and tea bag to boil and simmered it for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, toss the tea bag and stir in the sugar, honey and milk, heat until hot and then serve. It's my new favorite Chai recipe.

This was a tasty and quick way to make Chai.  I read the others' comments about the milk cooling down the tea, so this is how I made mine. I put the milk in a mug and warmed it in the microwave.  I then placed the tea bag into the milk and poured the boiling water into the mug and let the tea steep. I added the sugar and honey at the end. It was slightly too sweet for my tastes, so I cut back a bit on the sugar and honey the next time I made it.  I also made it again using Splenda and coconut/almond milk with great results.

Good recipe. However, I added cinnamon and nutmeg. It came out a little too sweet so I boiled it and then I blended it in my blender to thicken it up. It came out perfectly!!!

I drink chai tea lattes all the time from Starbucks, but this was my first time making one. I think this recipe is a solid starting point, and you can change it up to fit your specific taste.

I followed other reviewers and warmed up my almond milk in a separate mug. I think added the honey and 2 splend bags to the warmed almond milk. After the tea (Tazo Chai) was done steeping in a separate mug, I put the two together. Verdict? It was too sweet! Lol...

I added some additional hot water to try and dilute it a bit, but in the future I would use less honey and 1 splenda bag. 

Great alternative over giving Starbucks all of my money.

I boiled my tea bag in the water to try for a stronger flavor.  The tea I used was Stash(R) Chai Spice Black Tea.  I used a packet of Splenda instead of sugar and added the honey to taste instead of measuring it out...probably used more than called for but that's how I like it!  Perfect amount of liquids for my favorite mug!

This is far too much to call it as a Chai Latte...
More likely a Chai tea, with milk.

My son had tried a Chai Tea Latte and loved it, wanted to make at home, happy to find this recipe! I used Tetley Chai Tea bags,  1 tsp honey and omitted the sugar as it was sweet enough, 1/2 cup 1% milk frothed was enough as well. Thanks for the recipe!
To froth milk without a frother, fill an 8 oz jar half full with milk, heat in the microwave for 45 seconds, place lid on jar tightly, shake for 60 to 90 seconds, voila! frothy milk.

Delicious, I have been trying to find just the right combo to make a chai tea latte. This one was really good! I think next time I might adjust the sweetness but overall it was delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

this was good and easy. I used almond milk and stevia to sweeten. also if you really want the spice flavors to pop add a little salt. I've been doing that lately with chia and chocolate flavored teas and it really makes a difference.

Turned out great. I made a batch for a serving of 6. I used brown sugar for the sweetener and added a tsp of cinnamon to the pot. Great recipe. Nice and easy!

I made this using the Stash Double Spice Chai tea, I decreased the amount of honey which sweetened it enough for me, and I whipped some low-fat milk in the blender, but I think that whole milk would have been better.

I liked it. I would steep the tea bag for longer than you usually do/use less milk so that milk does not overpower the taste of the chai. Not as good as Starbucks version but pretty good.

So for starters I used vanilla cahi black tea. I don't know the brand but it wasn't Tazo or anything fancy from teavana, just the regular grocery store variety. I boiled my tea bag in the water and cut back on the milk after reading other reviews. Also I only used sugar instead of honey and simply used a few teaspoons instead of one and added a dash of cinnamon. I would use two tea bags instead of one for a stronger chai flavor and definitely cut back on the amount of milk, but this is a great starting point for a chai tea latte.
