Have made this recipe many times -- the following changes make these bars a "5":
Add 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest to crust.  
Reduce butter by 2 tablespoons.  
Bake until filling is set - may need to add 2-3 minutes depending on your oven and baking pan (I also bake crust an extra 2 minutes).  
Dust with sugar to disguise browning.  
Loosen edges of bars with a sharp knife while still warm.  
Chill or partially freeze bars to facilitate cutting.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the reviewer wondering how to measure the juice: 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons = 5/8 cup.

After reading all the reviews and modifications, I was so confused as to what to do! I gave up and made it as is.... it was wonderful. Sweet and tangy, the crust was golden and crispy, they were excellent. So, do yourself a favor and DON'T read all the reviews and make a bunch of changes. This is a great, easy recipe I'll be making over and over again, because they're addictively yummy! One tip: when spreading the crust, put it in the pan in a lump and use a sheet of plastic wrap and your hands to smooth it out. It's really fast, doesn't stick and there's no mess.

After reading the reviews, I made this recipe as follows: Crust is 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 3/4 cup softened butter, 1/4 tsp. salt, 2 cups flour.  Mix that stuff and press into pan.  I was worried that pressing the mixture into the pan would make them difficult to get out, but they came out just fine.  Anyway, bake at 315F (yes, 315) for 15-18 minutes.  They will be maybe the slightest bit golden in color.  You do NOT want the crust to be browned all over or it will be much too crunchy.  Now the filling: 4 eggs, 1 1/4 cups white sugar, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1/4 cup flour, 2 Tbsps. lemon zest (basically all the zest from the lemons you use), and 3/4 to 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  1 cup of juice took me 5 lemons.  This mixture will be pretty runny.  Pour over baked crust and put this in the oven at 350F.  Be sure to increase your oven temperature now.  Bake for 20 min.  Let these cool completely.  This is crucial.  Then sprinkle powdered sugar on top and store covered on the kitchen counter.  I'm so glad I read everyone's reviews and was able to utilize their suggestions.  That's what allrecipes is about.  Sharing recipes and improving them.  I will totally make these again.  By the way, I used other people's changes because so many people complained that the crust was too oily.  Trust me, with my revisions the crust was like a wonderful sugar cookie or shortbread and was plenty sweet and buttery with the 3/4 cup powdered sugar in the crust batter.  A really great recipe! :)

There are some flaws with this recipes. This first is that the butter should NOT be melted in the crust- hence all the complaint about hard crusts. You want the butter cold and work it into the dry ingredients w/a pastry blender until the mixture resembles cornmeal. In the end, the crust should resemble shortbread. I like to add lemon zest to my crust for extra flavor. The second is, the filling needs to be doubled for a 9x13 or you will have more crust than lemon layer. Also, make sure you line the pan with parchment paper or foil if nothing else. It will allow you to lift the whole thing out and cut it.I have to admit I'm a lemon bar snob and have gone toe to toe with friend in lemon bar cook-offs. This is a good basic recipe. Don't be afraid to play around with it.

OH MY GODD!!!   I made these this weekend and took some (not all) to my friends home.  They are amazing.  Very lemony without the extract and the zest.  I will be making these on a regular basis.  That is if my hips can stand it.

VERY easy to make.  One suggestion... Line the pan with enough parchment to surround the bars.  Once cooled you can lift the bars out with no breakage.  You can pull the parchment away easily.

These were good but a little different than lemon bars that I am used to.  I followed the recipe exactly!  Why do people give a recipe 5 stars when they add and and subtract different ingredients?  Almost every reviewer added more lemon juice, thus giving it 5 stars.  I don't know... that just bothers me, I guess.

I wanted to use these for a bridal shower, so after an intitial trial batch, I made some minor changes.  I increased the entire recipe by 25% to make a thicker bar.  Decreased the butter in the crust by 2T.  Lined my pan with Reynolds Release foil, and then sprayed with Pam.  I very firmly pressed the crust into the pan, and baked at 315 degrees for 15 minutes-PERFECT!  For the filling, I added 1T flour to thicken up the sticky filling a bit (I was serving this as a finger food!).  I used Minute Maid real frozen lemon juice, and decreased the amount just slightly to counteract a slightly bitter aftertaste in the first batch.  Then baked at 300 degrees for about 30-35 minutes until set-PERFECT.  Everything was perfectly done, not too brown.   Bars cut up very easily, didn't stick to anything with the foil.  Dusted with powdered sugar, and put the squares on a nice serving platter.  A real hit!  Great, easy recipe with basic ingredients!  Thanks so much!

Man, oh man, oh man are these GOOD!  I was nervous to use melted butter in the crust, something I don't ever recall doing.  But it worked - ohhh, did it work!  This is no soggy, wimpy crust!  As I always do when I make any lemon bar recipe, I made 1-1/2 times the filling, keeping the crust measurements the same. I used a combination of lemon and lime juice (1 cup for a 1-1/2 filling recipe) and 1 T. of mixed lemon and lime zests.  The crust was firm but tender, the filling tart, sweet and substantial.  They don't cut as neatly because of the extra filling... but who cares?  These are lemon heaven!

These were really good...exactly like the ones at the coffee shop near my house.  They charge $2.50 a square...wonder where they got the recipe???  Update:
I tried baking the crust at 315 as someone else suggested.  I did not work out for me at all....The crust was mushy and greasy from the butter.  Also, I substituted lime juice for lemon juice, just to see what the filling would taste like.  The difference was negligible, and the lime juice made the filling sorta brown and still tasted more like lemons than limes.  I'm going to stick with baking the crust @ 350 for 17 mins, and using fresh lemon juice.  Oh, and I also line the pan with parchment paper....very important step, as they come out of the pan way more easily. UPDATE # 2.  FINALLY figured out how to get great crust.  I used my Cuisinart to blend the ingredients and added the butter partially frozen.  Pulsed it until it was lightly crumbled.  Perfect!

I usually don't try a recipe that has so many changes but lemon is my favorite so I thought I would try and incorperate most every ones ideas.Idid and it couldn't have came out better. The crust:I changed the sugar to 3/4th C I changed the butter to 3/4th C. I added lemon zest to the crust and baked it 315 Degrees for 15 min. perfect. The filling: I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 and added the lemon juice to 1 cup fresh.also added 3 Tb. of flour. The filling was perfect and not sticky Baked at 300 degrees for about 45 min. or untill done. the idea about greasing your pan and then lining it with foil and spraying the foil with pam was a real good idea.Perfect. and very yummy ( I think I used a little larger pan to have to bake it alittle longer.) It couldn't have been better. also sprinkled p. sugar on the top...Thanks for the recipe Ralph.

I think that the directions should have said 30 rather than 3 minutes for baking the lemon topping.

Good recipe but needs tweaking to make it perfect. Made it several times with these changes based on others suggestions and my own for more lemony (less sweet) bars. Preheat oven to 315 F. Crust: 
3/4 powdered sugar
3/4 cup butter - NOT melted, room temp.
1/4 tsp salt
2 cups flour
Combine ingredients and mix (I use my hands). Ok to leave butter in small chunks. Line bottom of 9x13 pan with parchment paper, no greasing needed. Press dough evenly into pan. Parchment paper makes it easy to lift the whole thing out and squares won't stick. Bake for no more than 15 min at 315 F (NOT at 350, otherwise crust will burn) until crust is slightly golden, not brown. 
Lemon Filling: 
4 eggs, 1 cup white sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/4 cup flour, 1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (approx. 5 lemons), zest from lemons used. 
Pour over crust and bake at 350 F (note the higher temperature) for 20 min. Let cool completely before removing from pan.

I think this recipe would have turned out better if I had simply followed the directions. I took the advice of others and cooked the bread part longer and added more lemon juice. The bread part ended up being overcooked and the lemon undercooked. It's probably a good idea to simply try the recipe first before you make any changes to it.

Outstanding! I made many of the same modifications as other reviewers:

Crust: 3/4c melted butter, 3/4c pwd sugar, 2c flour, zest 1 lemon. Baked at 315 for about 18 minutes (to barely golden).

Filling: 4 eggs, 1 1/4c white sugar, 1t baking pwd, 3T flour, 3/4c lemon juice (fresh squeezed, 5 lemons). Baked at 350.

Now, I like desserts just as much as the next person, but I don't like them to be OVERLY sweet. And I do think that for the filling, had I used the full 2c sugar called for, that it would have been waaaaay to sweet for my personal tastes. In fact, I may cut it back to just 1 cup next time and I think that'll be plenty.

But man, oh man, these were delicious. Thank you so much for sharing! :)

Great recipe but we use 3/4 C. lemon juice, 5 eggs and only 1 C. of sugar and these bars are our biggest seller at our Farmer's Markets.  Replace the lemon juice with Lime juice, add 1/2 Tsp. imitation coconut and 1/3 C. of coconut for an out of this world, Coconut Key Lime Bar. Enjoy.

These were pretty good.  The crust was a little too thick and chewy for my taste, but they certainly did not go to waste.

I'm a huge believer in taking liberties with recipes to make them my own, but it is my habit on the first attempt at any new recipe to follow the author's instructions exactly.  Because this recipe seems to be the most established and most reviewed recipe for lemon bars on the site, I gave it a go.

Well...the crust isn't just oily.  It's a soaked, soggy, and flavorless mess that coats the tongue and leaves a terrible aftertaste.  For me, that effectively ruined the entire bar.  In my opinion, the crust doesn't need to be modified.  It needs to be replaced with another recipe.  Truly awful stuff.

The lemon layer, on the other hand, is divine.  Perfect tartness--and not too sweet.  That is SO hard to find.  I've had lemon bars that were so tart they made my eyes water, and I've had some that were so sweet that it hurt my dental work.  I consider being able to finally find the right balance in this recipe a triumph...even though the crust is a mucky travesty.

I printed this out and put it on a card to keep with a note to myself saying, "Best lemon topping ever...don't use the crust."  I think that is a nice summation of my feelings about this recipe.

Really excellent lemon bar recipe!  I also like them very lemony, so I used 3/4 cup of lemon juice and about 1 tsp of rind.  I baked them for 25 minutes after pouring the lemon mixture on the crust.  Took them to a party, everyone raved about how good they were.

Perfect blend of tart and sweet. This is exactly what comes to mind when you think of lemon bars. I added the finely grated zest of 2 lemons to the filling. I reduced the butter in the crust to 3/4 cup and that was plenty. The shortbread crust has a lovely sable texture and butter taste. Everyone goes crazy for these. I only bake for 25 minutes, and it's perfect. A quick sprinkle of powdered sugar after cooled, and they look as great as they taste. A+

The recipe is not bad, it just needs tweaking.  I baked the crust an additional 5 minutes, but I think that the sugar in the crust can be cut down to 1/2 cup.  The butter could also be cut down (I'll try subtracting 2T next time) because it is kind of greasy and doesn't crisp up really well.  The filling needs to be a bit more substantial so I added an extra tablespoon of flour.  I also added the zest from one lemon, but I'll up it to two lemons next time, as I love a tart lemon taste.  Also, using fresh lemons and the zest is essential for getting a good lemon flavor.  The first time I made these, I used bottled lemon juice and we could hardly taste the lemon, even though this recipe calls for the most juice I've seen in a recipe.
*Update* The crust worked well to cut down on the sugar and a bit on the butter.  I used the zest from 2 lemons and got the tart taste I wanted.  The filling is still pretty curd-like...which is OK if you don't need a really stable filling.  I took these to a wedding anniversary party with the bars set in individual muffin papers.  They looked beautiful and recieved many compliments on taste.

Yummmm!  We all loved this recipe - thanks, Ralph!  I did, however, alter the recipe according to what others posted.  I tried to summarize their suggestions and here's what I came up with:

3/4 c. confectioner's sugar, 3/4 c. butter, 2 T. lemon zest, 1 1/4 c. white sugar, and almost 1 c. lemon juice.  Bake the crust for a little more than 15 minutes (I think I did about 18 min.).  Sprinkled the top with powdered sugar to make them attractive.

These are delicious!!  The crust is soooooo buttery.  Because of the prior reviews saying there wasn't enough lemon flavor, I used fresh squeezed lemon juice and about 3 TBSP of lemon zest.  The flavor was perfect.  I baked the crust about 45 minutes, longer than what the recipe stated.  I will definitely make these again!

This is a great party recipe.  I had just 2 minor problems with it:  1) the lemon flavor was too mild, and 2) it needed to bake for quite a lot more than the 3 minutes noted to set the liquid.  I added some lemon zest to the liquid mix, and baked each 9x13 pan for 12 minutes @ 350 degrees after pouring the liquid on.  I made 8 batchs of this in one afternoon for a party.  It is easy and fast to make.  The reviews at the party were great!

I made these lemon bars for a PTO function and another mother made some from another recipe. These were a HUGE hit and no one ate the others. And yes you do cook the topping for 30 minutes.

This is a great recipe. The combination of the crunchy buttery crust, the creamy middle and the chewy top is perfect. 

I did "tweak" the recipe a little...I 
added a pinch of salt to the crust, used a little lemon zest in the filling, reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cups, and used 3/4 cup lemon juice since I thought 5/8 cups was a sort of weird measurement.

This recipe is a keeper.

I beat the egg mix for a couple minutes until it was thicker and more frothy and I think it made the bars fuller.

THESE ARE TO DIE FOR! All I would suggest is that you add a little more flour to the crust it gives it not such a soggey crust! DELICIOUS!

These lemon bars have turned out completely awesome every time I make them. I have the  girls at work begging me to bring them in and my little brother  hovers around the stove while I cook. I made several small modifications. I use the 3/4c lemon juice previously reccommended. I also zest one lemon and mix the zest into the crust mixture. I use parchment paper to line the pan and they pull out so easily. Finally, I add the sprinkling of powdered sugar on top that everyone has recommended. They come out divine.

DO NOT MELT THE BUTTER!!  To get a yummy, light crust, you need to keep the butter cold and blend it in with a pastry blender.  Press it into the parchment paper covered pan, but not too firmly as to make it too dense and hard.   I cut the lemon juice down to 1/4 C and added 1 tsp lemon extract.  That way it sets up a little better and isn't runny.  I baked them for 25 more minutes at 350 and they turned out perfectly.

these were easy to make, but I have another recipe for them that I like much better. I didn't think that this crust was flaky enough, and the lemon topping was a little too sweet.

Delicious!  I made 1.5 times the filling recipe, as recommended by others.  The crust is just fine using the melted butter.  Not sure why others found it greasy, as mine was not at all.  I did add about 1 Tbls. of grated lemon zest to the filling, which gave it that little "extra" lemony flavor that I love.  I will make this one again.  Thanks.

Oh boy do I regret not reading the reviews here and making the proper modifications! The recipe itself made me a rock hard crust with a paper thin filling that tasted like nothing but sugar. I didn't get a tinge of lemon flavour. So its now 3am, and I am trying to find a dessert to make with whatever ingredients we have on hand for Thanksgiving tomorrow!

Delicious!  I like my lemon bars to be very lemony and a little tangy, so I added about a tsp of rind in the crust and a tbs in the filling.  It was perfection.

This is exactly what I was looking for!!! The crust was a little too thick for my liking so the second time I made it much thinner and it was even better! I used a star stencil and dusted the tops with powdered sugar. I also added lemon zest to the crust for a extra bite of tang. These were a hit with the family as well as the kids at my sons school! A great idea for a bake sale!!!

These came out great!  A very easy recipe to follow too.  I cut the recipe in half and I think that it probably needed 25 minutes in the oven rather than 30.  My picky 10 year old loved it, as did my co-workers, even the ones that said they are "not big on lemon".  I followed other people's suggestions and cut the sugar (I used roughly 3/4 cup and found the result to be perfect - not too sweet) rather than 1 cup and I used two tbsp. less less butter as well.  The crust came out like shortbread.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh my gosh, yum!  These are so good.  I made these for my hubby to take to work tomorrow, and now I don't want to give them away!  I made as directed, except added a little almond extract to the crust (I could've eaten that raw!) & cut down on the butter by about 3 TBSP.  Also, I used bottled lemon juice, since I had no lemons. That worked out great.  I don't know if it's better fresh or not.  Probably, but there are no complaints from me.  Absolutely make again, probably real soon!

So good!  Nice and rich - I ran out of lemon juice, so I added a little lime to make up the difference.  Perfectly tart...and the crust is sooooo tasty!  Used a 7x11 pan instead of 9x13 (don't have a 9x13 LOL)...I just think I should have baked it longer - but they were still delicious!

When I first made this, I found the recipe quite rich and sweet because of the amount of sugar and butter you have to put.  The second time I made this, I lessened the butter 1/4 cup and made the confectioner's sugar 3/4 cup.  Also I made the white sugar 1 1/4 cups.  It greatly improved the taste and made it less rich for me.

I have eaten 100's of lemon bars in my lifetime. However, I have never made them. Wow - shock!  I made this recipe with Meyer lemons from my tree. The bars are without a doubt the best I have ever eaten.  The wonderfully fresh juice from a "just picked" lemon and the buttery light crust make this a keeper.  Mmmm...dieting next week.  Be careful not to overbeat/blend the last four ingredients......too wet will make sloppy bars.

This is my go-to recipe for lemon bars.  The first time I made them, I was worried because of all the alterations listed on the reviews.  So I decided to follow the recipe the first time and see what I thought.  The recipe, for me, is great as is.  I wouldn't change a thing!!

DO NOT MELT BUTTER!!!  I followed the recipe exactly with 1 cup of melted butter and the crust turned out flat, hard to cut, and greasy.  All other lemon bar recipes say to cut in the butter to the flour/sugar mixture - this creates a flakier crust.  Lemon filling was wonderful but crust was not!!  Once again, DO NOT USE MELTED BUTTER!!!

This is more then a five star recipe! These are the best lemon bars ever! The crust is tender and buttery, and the lemon filling is full of lemon flavor! The melted butter creates a more firm crust (different from most lemon bar recipes), bake crust just until light golden around the edges before adding lemon filling. I followed the advice of some others and covered the bars the last few minutes of baking time to avoid the lemon filling from becoming too brown. I used a greased pan and had no problem with the bars sticking, as some others have experienced. Lemon zest can be added to both the crust and filling for added lemon flavor. The one thing that the recipe does not indicate is to top cooled bars with powdered sugar after baking, this helps bring a balance to the tart lemon flavor of the filling. It also makes the bars prettier to serve. Don't overbake and you should have the perfect lemon bars! Delicious!!

These were wonderful!
I did tweak the recipe slightly. We like a thick crust and I wanted to run it up the side of the pan a bit, so I increased the crust by half again and added a quarter teaspoon or so of kosher salt and a few drops of good vanilla extract. The vanilla really makes a nice "backdrop" for the lemon custard and the salt sharpens the sweetness of the shortbread and the vanilla. 
I used fresh lemons and added the zest to the custard, also increased the juice to around 3/4 C or a bit more.
I'll definitely be making these again. Yum yum!

I only had a 8x8 pan, so I changed the serving size to 12 for the crust and 14 for the filling. Increased lemon juice to a bit less than 1/2 c. The squares turned out beautifully. The crust cooked for 18min  One time I made them, it didn't work out so well...I think I whipped the lemon mixture up too much, so it ended up  getting way too fluffy and the end result was fluffy and not as lemony tasting. Definitely won't make that mistake again!  Oh, I have to add that when friends tried the first batch, every single person commented on how good they were.

The filling in this was very, very good, but wasn't very impressed with the crust. It was alright, just kind of bland. I think next time I might try the filling on a graham cracker crust!!!

Another UPDATE--last night I made these in an 8 by 8 pan.  I halved the recipe that I had increased by 25% already.  If you make in an 8 by 8 pan, I recommend these measurements: 1 1/4 cups flour, 3/4 cup powedered sugar, 1/2 cups plus 2 TBSP melted butter.  For filling I used 2 and about 1/2 eggs (if you can separate and egg into halves, otherwise 2 will be ok too), 1 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 plus 1/8 tsp baking powder, 1/2 plus 1/2 TBSP flour, 1/3 cup plus 1 TBSP and 1/2 tsp lemon juice PLUS the zest of 1 lemon.

I know this sounds like a lot, but they really do work well.  For the crust, bake at 315, but only until the crust is still soft. It should still look slightly raw in the middle.  Bake the crust plus filling for about 40 mins in the 315 oven.  Seriously, these are SO AMAZING, I could eat the whole pan. Baking them this way keeps the crust soft and not brick hard. Good luck!
UPDATE--shortbread crust is only hard if refrigerated.  I do not recommend storing these in the fridge. Keep them on the counter and they will be fine.
Love the flavor, and as suggested by someone else, I increased whole recipe by 25%. HOWEVER, the crust never browns, and so I kept waiting for it to do so, and as a result the shortbread crust was like a ROCK.  
As a warning, do NOT cook the crust more than 15 mins in a 315 degree oven.  Do NOT wait for it to brown.  In fact, if I did it again, I might cook the crust 10 mins only.

Delicious lemon bars!  I just made them for a party and everyone loved them!  The only changes I made were: subtracting two tablespoons butter from crust, adding about two tablespoons flour to lemon mixture, and adding the zest from 1 1/2 lemons.  They were perfect!

Mmmmm! These are phenomenal.  Took them to a potluck dinner tonight and everyone raved.  Used 4 juicy lemons which came out to a little more than 3/4 c of lemon juice plus added some zest.  Definitely going into the recipe box.

These fell apart rather easily. I think the crust could use some tweeking...maybe less butter. The overall taste was good, nice lemon flavor but I did add 1 tablespoon of lemon zest. I think it needs the zest to balance out all that sugar.

A family fave but the 3 minutes should be 30 on the last instruction. 
This is also nice if you substitute with a plain vanilla cake mix (about 1 inch thick) as the base and use the same lemon topping.

I was so pleased with the results of this recipe! If you like the taste and texture of pre-fab boxed lemon squares, this is definitely the recipe to use. It's very similar, but fresh and improved. I think those who had poor reviews would be surprised and how much minor error can affect the outcome. For example, when it says the eggs should be beaten until light, it's very important that they are beaten enough. This will prevent the lemon layer from being flat and runny. I also think there is a big difference between fresh lemon juice and bottled juice that's been in the fridge for quite some time. I only had 1 and 3/4 fresh lemons, which only yielded just under a half-cup of juice and they had a very strong lemon flavor. 

While I don't think it's fair to make a lot of changes to a recipe and then give it a review based upon that version, I do have some minor changes to suggest for optimal results: 1. Cut the butter into the crust just as you would do for a pie versus melting for flakier texture. 2. Throw a little lemon zest into the crust mix and the batter. It will add a little tartness and increase the lemon flavor without putting it over the top. 3. Whip the eggs and add 1/4 tsp. of cream of tartar, this will fluff up the lemon layer and make it thicker and firmer without making it dense. The recipe is great either way, I just found those minor changes preferable.

Simply Delicious.  Like other reviewers, I was intimidated by the extensive changes some people recommended. The ONLY change I decided to make was to not melt the butter. Otherwise, I made it exactly as written.  It came out great!! If there is a change needed in order to keep the recipe from failing, please share. However,some of these changes people are calling for are completely unnecessary, and for personal preference only.

Super easy to make, but I would make one change. I thought the crust was too done. Next time I will only back the crust for 5-10 or maybe not at all.

I was worried about the flavor of these because some said strong egg flavor and others said lemon was too mild.  Answer to the egg flavor is make sure to whip the eggs til fluffy, this will solve that problem.  The lemon flavor can be boosted by using some of the zest from the lemon.  I really enjoyed these, my husband can't stop talking about them.

We have so many lemons on our tree this year I've been trying to come up with ways to use them.  I have not made lemon bars in many years and couldn't find my old recipe so searched through All recipes and I'm glad I found this one.  I basically followed the recipe, making some cuts to try to make them a little "healthier".  I followed some of the changes from other members, decreased the butter to 3/4 cup, 3/4 cup confectioners sugar, added 1/4 tsp. salt and added 1 tsp. baking powder to the crust, because I goofed!  It was great anyways.  I also added 1 tsp. baking powder to the filling, used 1 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 cup fresh lemon juice and 2 Tbsp. lemon zest.   I cooked the crust at 325 degrees for 18-20 minutes.  I cooked the filling about the same time.  It was a little bit brown and I thought I had cooked them too long, but they were perfect!  After they were cool, I sprinkled them with powdered sugar.  I'm sure they would be great as written, I just wanted to lighten it up a little bit.  Great!!!!

Just finished making these with my daughter- what a superb recipe!!!  I noticed that we all seem to be picky about what we like in a lemon bar and we make alterations.  We followed this one exact after altering the "bake sale" lemon bars recipe on this site to almost this recipe.  This one is the keeper for us.

These lemon square bars are the best I have ever tasted (sorry, Mom!)....Maybe it is because they are the freshest I ever tasted as well.  We cut them after they were cooled off in the refrigerator.  My 15 year old daughter made them... I just supervised.  Thanks so much for this recipe.... it is the best I ever tasted.  next time I will use fresh lemon and zest... this time we used lemon juice from a bottle.

I have made these twice so far, both times I took the pan home empty. Followed the recipe exactly, it does seem to be softer in the center, but I let them set overnight, which I feel helps them to set, then cut into small squares, wiping the knife after each cut. Delicious!!!!!

Fantastic Recipe! I used a little over the 5/8 cup of lemon juice- probably more like 3/4 cup and put the zest of 2 large lemons into the filling. They turned out perfect- not too sour and not too sweet. I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top and they look great- I am taking them to a dinner party tonight and i am confident people will love them! Thanks for the recipe. :)

While visiting my friend up north, she had some lemons that a friend sent her at Christmas and wanted to make lemon bars with them.  She had been looking for a recipe from Wolfgang Puck for *his* lemon bars and couldn't find it.  I suggested looking at allrecipes.com where we found this one.  My friend had her heart set on this other one that she had once before, but I talked her into this one.  Not being a lemon bar dessert fan myself as I like lemon in iced tea and that is about it, well I must say it changed my mind about these.  They were light, delicate and very flavorful!  My friend remarked that after having this recipe, she would not be using the intense Wolfgang Puck one again!  Thanks for sharing! :)

Very good bars. I do suggest to leave them at room temperature before serving. I served mine right from the fridge and the crust was too hard. Later, it was perfect and delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

THESE ARE AWESOME!! I brought them to a violin recital and they were gone in mins!!! The first batch i used egg beaters, and they did not set in 30 mins. I ended up making another batch  with real eggs. Both batches tasted fine, but the texture of the real eggs batch was much better. I covered half of each batch in powered sugar, and drew treble and bass clefs on the others with lemon icing, and the plate looked as great as they tasted!

Wow!~get ready for tart! I decided to make these for work (50 teachers) based on the reviews. I did cut the conf. sugar and butter for the crust, and it's delicious. I also cut the white sugar for the filling. I did use fresh lemons, I think that really adds to the strong lemon kick!  Getting lots of compliments on them...and there are tons of desserts to compete with today!  I'm adding this recipe to my collection!  I love this website!

i made these with lime juice, too. either way, they are really tasty. 

one variation i've done is use a springform pan instead of a glass dish which i would normally use. 

the springform allows for the crust to be pressed up the sides, then released easily, moved to a cake plate and sliced into extra thin, but long, pieces.

These lemon squares were amazing.  My husband says he would marry me all over again.  The crust was devine, and the lemon filling was perfect.  I made this exactly as directed, and it didn't fail me.  I will make these again and again for guests and family.  Thanx a million, Ralph!

This These bars are not for the weak!  They are tart, sweet, and very rich! I use fresh squeezed lemon juice (important), and add slightly more than the recipe calls for.  I also added 1/2 cup less sugar.  The crust I made as it says, only I added a teaspoon of lemon zest.  These are always a hit at party's!  Next time I will reduce the cooking time by about 3 -4 minutes though, as the edges were burned.  I fantasize about these bars.

Sorry...We could not believe how sickly sweet these bars were.  Nobody would finish their pieces.

I had been looking for a good lemon bar recipe and I've finally found it.  These were the best I've every had.  I added them to my cookie Christmas baskets and they were a hit.  My sister-in-law said she had to admit that she was a little jealous that they were better then hers. LOL!  I told her I'd share the recipe.  I've made them a couple more times since.  The only change I made to the recipe was adding a light dusting of powdered suger to the top just before cutting them into squares.  I thought it made them look nicer.  Thank you for this recipe.  It's definately a keeper!

Delicious!  I made these for a New Year's party and they were a big hit!  I added about 2 tsp. almond extract to the crust (I think next time I'll reduce the butter to 3/4 cup for the crust as I thought it was a bit greasy), and I used 3/4 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice (5 lemons).  I baked both the crust and the custard at 325 for the time suggested.  I think 325 was perfect for the topping.  Next time I'll cook the crust at 350 and then reduce the heat to 325 for the custard.  These are very pretty and exactly what I was looking for (I wanted something that was like the 'box' variety)  Enjoy!

This was very gooddddd!!! Love the flavor.  When I was making this recipe, I didn't have enough eggs to mix.  So I put the bottom dough in the fridge until I got back from the store (eggs). It turned out very flakly after I baked it but it tasted so delicious.  Mine didn't look like the picture because I didn't have enough time to cool it, it was gone before it cooled!!! Yeah, it was that good!

These were sooo yummy! In fact, they were so good and easy to make, I thought I would make another batch while making cookies (how do people live without 2 ovens?) Anyway, I couldn't figure out why it was so much foamier than the first batch. Well, I wasn't thinking and used baking SODA instead of baking POWDER. I didn't realize this until it was too late! It was too funny! I guess sometimes God has a way of making sure we don't take ourselves too seriously. After all, it's just baking! :))

These were so good and easy!I followed the instructions (allowing for 30min baking time due to typo) and they came out great. The only difference was, I read all the reviews and some people thought they werent lemony enough so I added the zest of 1 large lemon and a tiny bit of lemon extract( I didnt measure but was probably 1/2teasp.) to the filling. Cut into squares and dusted with conf. sugar. They were pretty and a nice change from all the choc. desserts. I will make these again.

No kidding.  This recipe deserves every star it can get.Sooo easy to make and festive looking and tasty.  It has been requested several times since it's first outing. I tried it with fresh lemon juice and bottled lemon juice.  Both are good, it depends on how strong you want the lemony taste.Fresh is milder.

Worked well. Put the powdered sugar on top right before serving to guests or it will resolve. Used Meyer lemons plus regular. Will make again!

These are great - the best batch I've made so far. Here are the adjustments that I made:
1. Add a pinch of salt to the crust.
2. Only use 3/4's of the mix for the bottom layer of crust. After you bake the bottom crust, add the lemon filling, and crumble the remaining 1/4 of the crust mixture on top... delicious!
3. For extra lemon flavor (without adding too much lemon juice and making the bars gooey) add the zest of one entire lemon to the lemon mixture.
4. For the lemon mixture, I used 1 and 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of confectioners' sugar.

I brought these into my office, sent them to my parents and boy friend and they can't get enough. :) Enjoy!!

I love lemon bars, so I can't explain why I've been too intimidated to make them myself.  I must have looked at this recipe for three days before I could actually drum up enough courage to make them.  The only change I made was using light brown instead of white sugar in the filling, because it was all I had.  I worried that I had ruined the bars, because the color was off from the sugar.  However, the taste was a heavenly mixture of sweet and tart, with a delicate, buttery crust.  They are delicious!  I guess this was the recipe I was looking for because I did it!  I made yummy lemon bars!  If I can do it, you can too!

I made this recipe as recommended and reduced the butter in the crust to 3/4 cup. I also reduced the confectioners sugar to 3/4 cup. When I added the butter, it WAS NOT melted, instead it was very cold and I cut it into the flour mixture to get crumbs, then pressed them into a foil lined pan. I then baked the crust as directed.  When it came to the filling I added lemon zest along with 3/4 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice. The bars came out wonderful. I think this recipe could probably be followed without any changes except not melting the butter, and cutting it in instead, and they would come out great. I did not give it 5 stars because of the butter issue, but otherwise it is a really good recipe. It is very similar to Better Homes and Garden's Luscious Lemon Bar recipe with minor changes. Good Cookies, and a family favorite! Thanks for submitting!

Excellent recipe as it is. (I had no trouble using melted butter.)  It does kick it up a notch if you put fresh lemon zest in the crust.  Wait until after you cut the bars to sprinkle a bit of confectioners sugar on top- it makes them look more tidy and sexy!

Oh, these were yummy!  I made half the recipe using an 8” square pan that I lined with non-stick foil and left extensions at opposite ends to use as handles, so once cooled, I could just lift it out of the pan for easy, clean cuts.  Even though I made a smaller batch, I still needed nearly the full amount of baking time.  Towards the end of baking, I thought it might get too brown on top, so I lowered my temperature by 25 degrees.  Maybe that’s why mine took a little longer than I thought they should.  Regardless I’ll make this one again!

I made this exactly as it was.  Some of the reviews give so many instructions!  I thought it was delicious.  I only added the zest of 2 lemons and a little extra juice because I like very lemon-y lemon squares.  I thought the crust was really yummy and would make very good sugar cookies by itself.  The only thing that I can say negative is that for some reason my crust and my lemon top did not stick together very well, but I think I cooked the crust a tad too long.  I didn't have any leftover bars after taking this to work though so I don't think anyone minded.

This is a very good basic lemon bar recipe. There are so many different suggestions... I followed the recipe almost exactly, with only these changes: I halved the recipe because I didnt have enough lemons and made it in an 8x8 pan. I had 1/3c lemon juice so i added extra sugar to the batter. I also added lemon zest to the batter and the crust. I will make this again. I recommend that people try the original recipe before adding any changes.

I really like this recipe.  After making it twice, my only complaints are 1. They are WAY too gooey - you can't cut them or pick them up easily.  I add a bit of extra flour (1-2 TBSP) to the filling and this seems to take care of it, and 2. The butter should not be melted.  Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, it should definitely be cold and cut into the flour/sugar with a pastry blender or 2 knives.  I've chosen to use a mixture of the juice of 2 lemons and Minute Maid Real Lemon Juice (the frozen kind), but I'm sure its fine with juice from actual lemons - I just hate juicing.  I also put the zest of one lemon in the crust, but that's just a personal preference and they're probably still very good without that.

I usually change recipes according to the reviews, but the reviews for this recipe make so many different suggestions that I didn't know which ones to implement!  I wound up following the recipe so I could decide which changes were right for me.  The verdict: this is a good recipe, but the crust needs a little work.  I was expecting a mild lemon flavor because so many reviewers said they added lemon zest, but I thought the lemon flavor was quite strong.  I'll keep the lemon layer just as it is next time.  I thought the crust was a little too hard, so when I make this again I won't melt the butter.  I'll cut it into the flour/sugar mixture with a pastry blender or two knives.  I think that will fix the problem, but I may also experiment with changing the amounts of the crust ingredients.

I actually like this recipe and I would have gave 4.5 stars if it were an option. I followed the directions  for the most part, but also took some advise from others that I wish I hadn't. I increased the filling, not double but x 1.5 and it really wasn't necessary. I would have preferred thinner. Also, I baked the crust at 325, but in the end found it undercooked. I did add lemon zest which I would do again. And I used cold butter to make the crust, I'll keep that too. I didn't have parchment paper and they were impossible to remove neatly. Other than that, I would stick to the instructions as they are.

This is a fantastic classic lemon bar recipe!  The crust is amazing.....and melt in your mouth good!!  It is a bit on the sweet side for me though, might consider reducing the sugar next time.  My friends all LOVED them & my husband is looking forward to the next time I make them:)

A+!!!! This recipe is PERFECT just the way it is- don't even bother reading the 'modifications' by other users because honestly, none are needed. And this is coming from a cook who usually always modifies any recipe from this site. Truly good as it is and delish. A big hit!! Thanks so much for this recipe!!! :-)

Great recipe, My family LOVED these. They went super fast.  But of coarse I did NOT melt the butter. I added a couple different flavors, and added extra butter to the crust.   ^_^

I had a bag of lemons going to waste so I thought-why not? So glad I did! They taste so fresh and yummy. I zested two lemons into the crust just for extra lemon essence. My one issue was determining when they were done-in my oven they were brown on top after 20 minutes but turned out the filling wasn't set in the middle after. Watch carefully. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

There were so many suggested changes to this recipe that I decided to just make them as-is and see how they turned out!   The only (minor) changes I made were to add the butter cold, and to add some lemon rind to the crust and filling.  I thought they turned out great!  And no need to double the filling!!

Like other reviewers, I am a bit reluctant to rate this recipe since I used a modified version based on another reviewer's suggestions. After browsing reviews, I decided to go with Paige's (if you sort by 'most helpful,' hers is second from the top). I halved the proportions she provided, which is what I usually do when I want to test out a recipe.   For the crust, I used butter straight from the freezer and thawed it slightly. I cut it into squares to mix it with the other crust ingredients. I also dotted some butter pieces over the mixture after I squashed it into the pan. Another reviewer had indicated that this would prevent the crust from overbaking and getting burned, and this seemed to be true, as my crust was perfectly done, though a bit bumpy and unsightly. (Oh well - it was covered up, anyway!). I also put in the full amount of lemon juice Paige suggested. I used freshly squeezed juice.   For baking, I used an 8x8 pan for slightly thicker bars, and lined it with parchment paper to make it easier to remove. I had to bake the crust  for a long time, but the filling itself actually set pretty quickly. As soon as the mixture no longer looked wobbly, I took it out.   I absolutely LOVED the final product. It was pretty tart with just a hint of sweetness. It was nice and soft. I probably added too much butter, but it made it taste pretty good. :) If you are looking for a sweet lemon bar, this probably isn't your recipe. My mom tried it and thought it was far too tart.

I love lemon bars and this was my first attempt. This recipe had everything I anticipated. So easy, If I had known how easy this was I would have made dozens for people. Very nice! Wonderful texture. To not burn the bottom layer dont melt butter completely.. I also thought maybe a couple more minutes in the oven for the bottom layer. Great recipe everyone enjoyed them.For appearance I added 2 drops of yellow food coloring. No changes needed on this one. 5 stars well deserved. Thanks!

I omited the baking powder and added lemon zest to the crust and filling. I also used 1/2 the amount of sugar in the crust. It was so yummy! A great dessert for the beginning of summer!

Very good.  I made the recipe as originally written without all of the modifications.  The crust turned out perfect.  I made the mistake of beating the lemon mixture a bit too vigorously with an electric mixer and it was a bit too frothy.  I should have just stirred by hand.  Most of the bubbles went away while cooking, but I think it would have had a denser consistency had I done this right.

I made this exactly as written except for the addition of about 1/2 cup of Angel Flake coconut and about 1 tsp vanilla added to the lemon filling.  This a very tart and super lemon-y bar and everybody in my family enjoyed it.  The only change I would make would be to decrease the amount of butter by a couple of TBs.  the crust was a little oily after baking, but not enough to detract from the delicousness of the recipe.  I would definetly make this one again!

Use softened butter, not melted.  Cut in the butter with two knives until you have a fine texture.  The parchment paper idea was great.  I didn't even need to clean the pan.  I added two additional eggs to add more filling (which seemed to turn out just fine).  I think adding finely grated lemon zest is a good addition.  I also baked the crust at a lower temperature (315) as someone mentioned, and I feel that was a great decision.  The crust was perfect.

Super easy and foolproof!  I used 3 lemons and got the most juice I could by microwaving each lemon for 10 seconds (total of 30) and then rolling each lemon against the counter top to break up the pulp.  I baked the crust at 300 the first time because 350 burned the crust.  What do people put on top?

This recipe was a great start.  I'm sorry to say that the second time around I did make a number of changes.  Per my parents' request I doubled the lemon/sugar top and multiplied the shortbread-type base by 1 1/2.  Doing that in the same size pan (9x13) came out wonderfully.  

Following my "edits" i've made this a half dozen times now and always get compliments.

These are wonderful!  I learned from other reviews to use parchment paper, add lemon zest to the crust, and not to melt the butter.  Otherwise I prepared the recipe as is.  I had many requests for the recipe at the company luncheon!

These came out great. Very easy to make. I made a few minor adjustments. I added the zest of one lemon to the custard mix. I also baked them for 20 minutes uncovered and 15 minutes covered. FYI 5/8 cup is the same as 1/2 cup plus 2 Tablespoons. I will be making these again.

So-o-o-o delish!  I used the suggestion to cut the butter and sugar in the crust to 3/4 cup each, but other than that, made as stated and we were not disapointed!  For all you lemon lovers out there, give this one a go!

I made this as per other suggestions and put in the crust, 3/4 C butter and 3/4 powdered sugar and the lemon zest from one lemon, still 2 C of flour.  It came out perfect! No problems at all.  I cooked the crust for 18 mins. at 325 and filling for 25 mins. at 350. My husband can't wait till I make these again.

I have been looking for a lemon bar recipe that is really tart.  I love tart lemon bars, but every recipe was too sweet.  I also added lemon zest to the crust, and subtracted 2 tablespoons of butter, like a review suggested and it turned out great!  I added the rest of the zest from the lemon to the top part of the bars.  I was also glad that this recipe was for a 9x13 where most recipes are for a 9x9 pan.

This is SOOO tasty!! It was so easy to make. For the lemon juice, it took me about 5 lemons, just in case you didn't want to measure out 5/8 cups.
My only complaint is that the crust was too thick. It was flaky and great tasting, just too much. But it could have been the size pan I used. Happy cooking!

I liked these. I accidently put a little to much lemon juice but they still turned out great. Wasn't very fond of the crust though. They freeze well and taste even better after being frozen. Will make again.

These are terrific!  I used about 3/4 c fresh-squeezed lemon juice and sprinkled confectioners sugar over the top after baking. I also covered the top for the last 8 minutes or so of baking to keep it from browning too much. Thanks! This is a keeper!

Having tried nearly all the lemon bar recipes on this website, this one is by far the best one!  I follow it to the letter and they have turned out perfect every time! People have asked to marry me- they are that good!

Fabulous!  I didn't change a thing, and these were delicious!  For a really festive look, cut out pretty designs from plain paper, lay them on the individual lemon squares, and dust with powdered sugar.  When you take the paper design off, your lemon sqaures look as great as they taste!  Make sure the bars are completely cool before doing this.

These were fantastic!!  And very lemony based on the following changes suggested by others: reduced white sugar to 1 1/2 cups, added fresh lemon juice to 3/4 cup instead of 5/8 cup and reduced the butter by 2 TBSP.  I lined my pan with parchment, which made it a breeze to lift out of the pan and almost no clean-up time. I cut the bars with a bread knife and added a very light dusting of confectioner's sugar after they cooled. I should have doubled the batch. I cut them into smaller bite sized squares and they were inhaled by all. This will now be a family standard.

As is, this recipe is horrible...the crust has way too much butter in it and the lemon part browned way to quickly!  I ended up throwing it in the trash. I am going to have to try again and reduce the butter and the cooking temperature.

I had some lemons that needed to be used and had never made lemon bars before.  I gave these a shot and they turned out good.  I did reduce the butter in the crust but left everything else the same.  They turned out good.  Everyone at my husband's work enjoyed them.  Thank you!

I have made these Lemon Squares 4 times in the past month.  Every where I take them, I get many requests for the recipe.  I did use 3/4 cup of lemon juice, added 1 tsp. lemon zest, but the best change is that I lined my pan with either heavy duty foil or parchment paper that extends up and out the sides of the pan.  When the bars are baked and cooled I just pulled out the lining and the bars were much easier to cut neatly.  For a prettier cookie, sprinkle some confectioners sugar on the top of the bars after cutting.

Wonderful.  Instead of using the powdered sugar, I use about 3/4 C of white sugar.  It gives the crust more of a shortbread taste rather than being on the "crumbly" side...  The first time I made these, I realized after the crust was cooking that I only had a cup of white sugar left, so I added half a cup of brown sugar.  The end result was more of a cookie tasting chewy bar instead of the usual lemon bar texture.  (A good mistake!)  I also add 1/2 teaspoon of salt  fruit mixture.  Excellent recipe!

Awesome recipe, the best! I made a couple of changes to make it healthier. For the crust, I only put 1/2c butter and added 1/3c water. I also reduced the amount of sugar for the lemon topping to 2/3c. It was AMAZING. I got rave reviews. Just make sure the crust is golden when you are ready to pour in the batter. I was in a rush once and I didn't wait long enough, it was horrible.

Delicious! adding about 2 tablespoons of  finely chopped zest made for a very sweet and tart dessert. Unfortunately, I didn't grease the pan thoroughly enough, so I'm left desperately trying to pry up the last edges for the rest of the lemony goodness! These taste like lemondrops in the best sense, mmm mmmm.

These bars are excellent.  The flavor is wonderful and the crust is perfect. The only problem I encountered is that the top of the bars started to get very brown after only 15 minutes in the oven and I fear they would have burned if I hadn't covered them with foil. If you're looking for a terrific lemon bar recipe, this is it.

Easy, excellent, yummy!  These baked up really nice and I sprinkled with powdered sugar.  I used the juice from two large lemons and you can definitely taste the lemon flavor.  Baked them for 30 minutes which was perfect.  Try these, you would be dissappointed!  Thanks Ralph!

Very easy recipe.  I had a craving for lemon squares and looked up this recipe and it was perfect.  It was a bit gooey so I think I should leave it in the oven for a little bit more than 30 minutes.  But otherwise this is a great recipe.

These were so easy to make...except the 5/8 cup lemon juice thing.  Not really thinking, I put in a little less than 1/2 cup of lemon juice.  Now that I think of it (hours later) I realize that it should be a little MORE than a half cup...darn!  I love my lemon flavor so I wish I would've put the whole amount in.  I tried them, and they are good, just could use more lemon flavor.  I will try making these again.  I'm taking them to a potluck so hopefully other people will think they're good too!***** Made again using the full amount of lemon- perfect!  They taste great.  I also used half whole-wheat pastry flour in the crust this time, and it's delicious still.

I loved it! As I had an event to go to, I opted to play a bit. I took little balls of the dough, and pressed them into greased mini-tart pans. They didn't have to bake as long as the full recipe (which, I had plenty left to make a 9x9 pan with!)

Loved them! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I did take them to work and got a couple mixed reviews. Some people thought they could have been more 'lemony', but I thought they were great! I will definitely make these again...they were super easy to make!

I followed the recipe and the only tweak I made was to add a dash of salt to the flour for the crust and add the zest of the lemons to the filling. The added salt enhanced the buttery sweetness of the crust and complemented the tangy lemon of the filling. The added zest upped the lemon flavor as well since you get the essential oils and not just the juice. All in all a great recipe.

Used Meyer lemons for this recipe.  Added about 1/2  t. finely grated lemon zest to the dry crust ingredients.  As long as you don't work the crust too much, it has a nice, munchy texture.  Dusted lightly with powdered sugar after brief cooling, then cooled the rest of the way in the fridge before cutting.  A-MA-ZING!

I'm addicted!  I've made two batches so far and they were yummy. I used Meyer lemons.  They're a little pricier than regular lemons but one try and you will know why. The first time I made these bars, I followed the directions except I substituted butter for the Pam (I don't like the butane in Pam).  The filling didn't quite set in the middle after 30 minutes and my crust was kinda stuck to the pan.  But the bars were still yummy.  The second time I made them they turned out so much better for me with these changes:  
(1) I used softened butter instead of melted butter for the crust
(2) Used a pan with a removable bottom
(3) Lined the pan on the bottom and all around the sides with parchment paper (worked like a charm) 
(4) Wiped the parchment with the butter wrapper (a trick I found online), 
(5) Baked the filling at 350F for 30 minutes and then turned on convection for an additional 7 minutes. 

The second batch was perfect and the bars were a hit at my office potluck!   Can't wait to make some more!

Made them as is, except grated two lemons and added the zest to the crust and lemon juice mixture.  I put 1/3 of it in the crust and the rest to the juice mix. I squeezed both lemons and got the perfect amount of juice that the recipe asked for. Lucky that I bought the right size lemons! Whenever I make cheesecake or bar type baked goods, I line the pan with heavy duty foil (I don't own a springform pan). When they cool completely, I lift the foil out, peel the sides away and have perfect bars to cut. Great recipe!

I read through several other recipes and their reviews.  I decided on this one because other recipes only called for 2 TB of lemon juice, and this one calls for well over 1/2 c. of lemon juice. I don't know about you, but I like my lemon bars to taste like lemon, thank you very much.  Sure, they may be a little more tart than the 2 TB bars, but it's lemon...it's supposed to!!  So here is my review of this particular recipe: i followed the suggestions of Jeannette's review, that being, reducing the butter by 2 TB and cutting away the edge of the lemon bars from the pan when taken from oven, which was a life saver as these bars are slightly sticky and gooey at first.  I did not add the lemon zest to the crust as I did not have real lemon.  i also dusted the top of the bars with the confectioner's sugar.  Yes, these are tart and tangy.  Yes, they are gooey.  But they are pretty awesome.  My sister loved them and my daughter who does not like lemon bars ate a couple of them.  This is a repeat recipe.  Thanks for uploading! :)

I made these EXACTLY as the recipe reads and my family and I think they are delicious. The only thing I would recommend is using parchment paper. The sides stuck to the pan making the first bars difficult and messy to get out.

Made exactly as-is, and texture was good, but it needs WAY more lemon flavor. It's barely lemony at all.

Took forever for the top part to set in the oven, I ended up covering with foil so wouldn't burn. But result was really good and everyone enjoyed them

I have made these twice, both times succesful (although the second time it looked better and the crust didn't need extra time like it did the first time - maybe because I got a stand-up mixer and it mixed the butter better which is VERY helpful) ;) These are irresistable!!!!!!! sooo delish!!! It is crucial that you let them cool COMPLETELY before cutting. your life will be much easier

I had to make a few changes to this recipe according to what others had to say - it made it a 5 star this way.  I added 1 tbsp of lemon zest to the filling and reduced sugar to 1-1/2 cups.  Keep an eye on them while they bake, otherwise the edges will be too brown.  Also, LINE your pan!  It's so much easier to remove them from the pan if you do.  I've re-written this recipe with my changes and will definitely make them again.

These were delicious, but they had a funny taste to them after a few days. Maybe because I left them out and didn't refrigerate them. Other than that I may make these again even though they took some time.

Good - not "the perfect lemon bar" in my opinion, but a hit with those I served it to.  Crust is a little thick and they were tough to get out of the pan so parchment would have been a good idea.  Darned easy to make however with the melted butter instead of "creaming".  That was a huge plus.

Decreased butter by 2 tbsp and used softened (not melted) butter. Used fresh lemon juice and zest of three lemons. Kept everything else as written and these were a HUGE hit. Very good recipe!!!

I notice in some of the reviews that people are complaining that their lemon mixture was bland. As a chef I know that all lemons are not created equal. If you have access (at the store or to place in your garden) to Meyer lemons, you will never use another lemon in your recipes. During the season I juice and zest Meyers and freeze for use during the none growing months. This recipe, which I just finished, was excellent with the juice and zest of the Meyer lemons.

These are the best lemon bars around, I have altered the recipe a bit by adding 5 eggs instead of 4, reducing the sugar to 1.5 cups and increasing the lemon juice to 2 tablespoons less than a cup. It is a little less sweet and much tarter which seems to go over well, i have been asked for this recipe over and over and over. And I agree do not, repeat do not melt the butter it makes the crust way to hard to cut and crumbly.

This was so good & it was my 1st time ever to try lemon bars. The picture looks so yummy so I thought I would try something different. The only thing different I did was cooked the first half on 320 with sugar sprinkle on the botton & cut back the butter by 2 tablespoon & didn't melt the butter. Cold is better. I did start out by put the 1st half in with a baking spoon but found out quick that wasn't going to work, so I stuck my hand in a sandwhich bag & pressed down with the mix. Works like a charm! Thanks for the recipe!!

These lemon bars were most excellant! Very tangy. So easy to make! I did reduce the sugar to 1.5 cups. So that made them a tad tangier. Like lemon meingue pie without the fuss.

Good. But not excellent. I have finished them all off :) But I love a tart lemon square. I would add zest and more juice next time. Also I think the crust was a tad buttery. I would cut that down and I would cut the butter in cold, like pie crust.

this is very close to the recipe I use except that I use 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 2/3 cup lemon juice and 2 tbsps lemon zest. I also bake the filling for around 25 minutes not 30.

These are fantastic!  My husband made them exactly as the recipe is written (no 'tweaks' at all) and they are wonderful.  A nice buttery crust and a lovely chewy filling.  The only the thing that I plan to change is the title to include my name so I can steal the glory...thank you so much for sharing this generous slice of  heaven with me and making me a hero to my family and friends=:)

Tangy. Tasty. Citrusy. Delicious. That's exactly how these bars are. I made a few adjustments which are as follows: BASE: 2cups flour, 1/2 cup icing sugar, 2/3 cup butter (cold). The butter was cut into the sifted mixture of flour and confectioners' sugar. Bake as per instructions. FILLING: Eggs were beaten well. Then sugar was added and beaten very well until fluffy. (I added 2 cups of granulated sugar, although I think it could be cut back to 1 1/2 cups of sugar). The flour and baking powder was sifted together and then mixed into the egg mixture. I had only limes on hand so I used a little over 1/3 cup lime juice and used water to fill up to 5/8th cup. I also added 1/2 tsp of lemon extract to it. This lime juice and extract mixture was added to the egg-flour mixture and stirred by hand. I also add 1 tsp of lime zest. Once again stirring by hand. I poured this over the prepared base. I feel 350 F (175 C) was a little too high, next time I'm going to try to it at 150C. Bake for approx 40 minutes until set.   Once cool, sift icing sugar over it. Wait for a little while before cutting into bars.   Also for those who are uncertain, the 'set point' of these bars are when they are a wee bit sticky and chewy  yet cooked. Thanks for sharing! I'm adding these too my Christmas platter this year! :)

I made this recipe exactly as-is and I can honestly say that they are the best lemon bars I've ever tried. They lasted all of fifteen minutes with my little brother and his friends around, and they begged me to make more. The only thing I did differently was dusting the bars with a light layer of powdered sugar just after they came out of the oven.

I followed this recipe exactly, and am not particularly pleased with the result. There is quite a bit of browning on the surface, and the filling is a bit chewy.

I followed all of Jeanette's recommendations and they were pretty good. Nice balance of sweet and tart. Adding lemon zest to the crust was a good idea, but I still think there was too much crust. It felt like eating a cookie more than a lemon bar. Also, I think melting the butter made the crust a little hard.

Really good! I didn't follow the directions for the crust- I used cold butter and cut into flour with a pastry blender. I juiced my own lemons- I found it took about 4. I also zested all the lemons I used. REALLY lemon-y and good!

Good flavor, but not the style I like. The lemon part is very set up and I prefer mine gooeier.

Followed the recipe almost exactly with a few changes though I think it would have been fine without the changes as well.  The crust took more like 20-25 minutes to turn golden, but I waited it out and the end product was exactly what I was looking for.

My kids wanted a sweet snack and asked for cookies.  I used the ingredient search tab since I didn't have any brown sugar and wanted to exclude that and stumbled upon this recipe.  The only things I did differently were to line my pan with parchment paper and added lemon zest to the filling.  Other than that, I followed everything else...ingredients, measurements and time.  Very rich tasting!

Delicious! But I decreased the crust's butter and powdered sugar to 3/4c, and I added lemon zest and increased the lemon juice to 3/4c for the filling.  Tart but not bitter :) PERFECT :)

I made this recipe without making any alterations and it came out great.  The crust was crunchy and a little flaky.  There was plenty of filling for a 9x13 pan.  My husband, who doesn't like sweets, had one, loved it, and came back for seconds!

I unfortunately took the advice of some of the other posters here, and baked the crust @ 315 degrees for 18 minutes. This created a more mushyesque crust... It's really important to make these ahead of time, even the day before, before you cut them. They stay together and look much better when they cool completely. The recipe MEANS cool completely. I was in a rush, and didn't wait long enough, I ended up with a mess. But a delicious mess... :)

I've made this recipe several times. The first time I made it I didn't forget a thing and they were perfect. Unbelievable. The second time, I made 2 batchs and  forgot the 1/4 cup flour in both. In one of the them, he lemon layer did not hold its own and somewhat soaked into the crust. In the other, the lemon layer was soggy and thin and sloughed off the crust after cutting. The 3rd time, I put in 1/2 as much baking powder as I should have and the lemon layer was wet and flat. . Having said that, FOLLOW THIS RECIPE AS IT IS.  DON"T FORGET A THING OR YOU WILL BE SORRY.

Most of the recommended changes to this recipes can be found in the recipe 'Lemon Bars I'.  Do not melt the butter, but add cold chunks of butter in a food processor with the sugar/flour as if you were making a pastry crust.  Use the juice of 2 lemons for the size pan listed, since you buy whole lemons it is easier to make your grocery list this way.  Grate some of the zest into the crust for added flavor.

Have to say right off that I would never melt butter when making a shortbread. The butter should be cut-in using a pastry cutter or knife and fork. Melting clarifies--separates the butter oil from the whey. It's much better to treat the butter as you would for any pastry and use it cold. Substituting 1/4 rice flour for the regular flour enhances the crumb texture of the shortbread.

My first attempt at lemon bars and they turned out great. I followed some reviews and did the following: added lemon zest to the crust, baked crust at 315 for 15 minutes and baked the whole thing at a little less than 350 for only about 28 minutes (the top browned quickly so keep an eye on it.) Everyone who tried these loved them. Next time I think I'll try it with limes.

Followed recipe - flavor was good & crust was good but the weirdest thing happened, the filling sank to the bottom of the pan and the crust rose to the top so the filling was under the crust. I have never had that happen and I make lemon bars all the time. I could not remember my recipe so I used this one but I can't bring this to a potluck. Will not make these again.

I love lemon bars and I had high hopes that this would be THE recipe for me; however, I was deeply dissapointed with the end results: 1st- I made some changes suggested by the best rankings- I uses 3/4 confectioner sugar, 3/4 cup butter, 1 1/4 cups of sugar, 3/4 cups lemon juice and added 2T of lemon zest to the dough. The flavors were fabulous, reason I am giving this recipe a 3 BECAUSE, the dough got stuck to the pan and there was no way of lifting the bars without making a mess of the servings (no bars for sure!) and as someone else mentioned, the filling was not enough for a 9X13" pan. I will give it a try again, but this time it will be following other suggestions (lining the pan with parchment paper) and I will not add the butter melted to the flour mix. I hate to give bad reviews when it may have been my error in the interpretation of the instructions. Well, let's see how my next batch comes out, but this recipe is only a 3 stars - all earned in flavor only.

This recipe is easy and super-delicious. Add a little zest and it's a masterpiece. I brought it to a potluck and the tray got devoured. It made a 6'4" man dance with glee. You won't be disappointed.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and these were absolutely better than Krusteaz or Sunkist.  Thank you for this easy, fast recipe!  An added plus is that is does not require many ingredients, and I usually always have everything on hand.

I did not care for this recipe. I could not eat these due to way too sweet,tart and buttery. I doubled the crust as suggested by others(way to much in my opinion) and did what others suggested with adding more lemon to it...mabye I should have tried the original recipe.

I have never seen, had, or made a Lemon Bar, so I decided to take a shot at this recipe based on Jeannette's suggestions (currently most helpful review). Turned out delicious and tasted soooo goooooood. I love the contrast in texture! Since we were low on ingredients I had to halve the recipe... I used a 8x5 rectangular glass pan. Since that's not quite half the size of a 9x13, the lemon bars were a lot thicker and took a good 10 minutes more (total 40 min) to fully set. Now as an amateur baker and first time baker of lemon bars... I could NOT cut these nicely at ALL! The pictures are so elegant and classy.. but my edges were all raggedy and ugly haha. How do I cut nicer lemon bars? Regardless of the look the were delicious though :) . In two hours I couldn't resist 5 squares! They were just so delicious! Man, it's good to be 16 with high metabolism LOL.. For first timers with this recipe: the base will only be slightly golden when you first cook, and lemon part should be gel like, but not liquidy.

This is ok. Not real lemony. It might be better with zest. I'm looking for something closer to Krusteaz and this isn't it. My daughter liked it tho. It was easy to make.

Fantastic! I did take others suggestions to bake at 315 for 20 minutes to start but I followed the remainder of the directions to the T. I can't get over how well these came out, I felt like a professional baker! Thanks for posting

Wow! These are soooo good! Looked at four of the most highly rated recipes for lemon bars, and the suggestions in the reviews, and this recipe kinda seemed like the middle ground between all of them.  Lined my pan with parchment, and am glad I did, probably would have had trouble getting them out otherwise.  Used slightly softened butter, not melted, per one reviewer's suggestion. Added a pinch of salt for crust, and completely forgot the baking powder in the filling, but they were perfect! To-die-for good. Tender crumbly crust and perfect tangy/sweet combo in the filling.  Going to make more tonight, these were all gone when I woke up and I just made them last night!

I baked the crust at 315 for 15 minutes and the filling at 350 for 25 minutes. Perfect!! And the suggestion about lining the pan with aluminum foil sprayed with Pam was awesome. This one is a keeper!

I made this lemon bars 6 times now and it's awesome. I just reduced sugar little bit more every time I make it, add lemon zest to the crust and top (1TBS each) and increase lemon juice to the top.  Everyone just loves lemon bars! Thank you for making everyone so happy!! :)

These are so yummy! When I bake them I leave uncovered for the first 10 min., then top the pan w/foil for the next 15, and take the foil off for the last 5, that way I find they stay nice on top without getting over baked and brown and top.

These were good had to cook them a little longer than recipe suggested they were still soggy in the middle.  They taste good.  Update: 6/21:  I made these again for the last time have decided to try another recipe, I just can't seem to get the middle baked right.  I end up losing all the ends and sides of the pan because it burnt.  I've tried the foil halfway thru cooking still feel I lose too much of the pan due to burning.

These turned out a little bit too lemony and sour for me, but still edible, I followed another reviewer and added 2tbsp of lemon zest and more lemon juice, should definitely not have done that.... they turned out way to lemony. So next time i make them I will follow the orignal recipe. Thanks.

Delicious! I've never tasted better ones, which makes me so happy because I actually made them. I followed the advice of previous comments and used 2 Tbsp less butter for the crust and added some lemon zest. so simple, and sooooo good. After they cooled I put them in the freezer before I cut them into pieces (I even used cookie cutters)

I just made these following the directions right along (which couldn't be easier) and they are SUPER! The only thing I did was add a little lemon zest to the crust. This was my first time making lemon squares, for some reason they always intimidated me, but they are simple and SO tasty.

I used the crust recipe from "Love the Mama Lemon Bars".  I added lemon zest to the filling.  Delicious!

I did add a little lemon extract to the crust, but other than that followed the recipe (except I didn't sift the flour).  I recommend watching the crust very closely as it tends to go from done to "burnt" very quickly & making sure the filling is really set.  I took mine out just after it started to brown & it it definitely needed another 5 min or so, but it was still very good!

These are very easy to make, and not too bad to eat... but I'm not so much a fan of the crust. I'm thinking I may try making a graham cracker crust and use this filling. The lemon top part is great.

The lemon bars are great. They have a good lemon flavor without making your mouth pucker. I also made raspberry lemon bars using the recipe above. After the crust was baked I added a layer of raspberry jelly mix (1 cup raspberry jelly + 1 teaspoon of water mixed together) across the bottom of the crust. The raspberry jelly is sweet so I used 6/8 cup of lemon to cut some of the sweetness down. I then added the lemon mixture on top. When you pour the lemon mix on top pour slowly or spoon in so that the raspberry jelly mix doesn't mix with the lemon filling making it swirl and lift off the crust. I then cooked the bars longer by about 10 minutes to compensate for the raspberry jelly and extra lemon juice. Before serving I dusted with confectioners sugar to pretty them up.

I usually use my mother's lemon bar recipe but I did not have it on hand, this was a wonderful substitute!

I halved the recipe and used an 8"x8" glass pan, I also turned down the temperature to bake the crust; which turned out wonderful!

For the filling I wanted more of a lemon-y taste so I used to juice from 3 small/medium lemons AND grated in the zest.

Then for an extra kick I put in approx. 2Tbsp of lime juice. I also did not have confectioner's sugar around so I used some of that raw-sugar stuff (the brown grainier stuff) and surprisingly it didn't end up changing the texture or taste at all.


It was delicious! I was making this with a sister and after she had a bite she said her sinuses must have cleared up. If you love a more tart lemon flavor I suggest to simply add more as I did. 

I definitely will use this recipe again.

This is a great recipe with Amy Paige's suggested changes based on the reviews of everyone else. An absolute winner and much better than when I followed the recipe exactly.

I made these for my husband on his birthday because he doesn't like sheet cake and he's requested them four more times since then.

This recipe is a new family favorite.

The lemon part of these bars is the perfect balance of lemon and sweet, although I may increase the amount next time.  The crust is just a little greasy.  I think once I reduce the butter to 3/4 c. it will be perfect.  Overall good, but with a couple tweaks I think they will be great.

These were good lemon bars, but they weren't the best i've had. :l

After they were done, and they were cooled. we tried them and they were ok, but then we put them in the fridge, and after we took them out and tried them again, they were much better. :]

So I would recommend chilling them before you eat them :]

I really like these, but my family was apparently not as impressed. They didn't complain, though, so I'm taking that as a good sign. I cut back on the butter to 3/4 cup as suggested in other reviews, and increased the lemon juice to 3/4 cup. Also, I took the lazy cook's way out by using bottled lemon juice - it worked just fine. I'll be making this for our next church supper. Thanks for the recipe!

Crust was too thick for my liking. Shall decrease the flour to 2 cups, sugar to 1/2 cup and butter to slightly more than 1/2 cup. I used only 3 eggs and 1 cup+ 2 tbs of sugar. It has a nice tart taste and chewy lemon filling. And very addictive indeed!

Crust didn't taste very good at all.  I recommend using a different crust.  Next time I'll use the crust from Mango Shortbread Bars: 1 1/2 cups butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, 3 cups sifted all-purpose flour.

I too was confused by the calling for 5/8 cup of lemon juice.  I googled the conversion and it came to 5 ounces which is about 148 ml so I measured that out.  Please bear in mind the power of your oven...when my crust was in for a half hour and just starting to brown I said heck with it and went forward.  Not a good move as I now have an underbaked crust.  I did however finally succeed with the lemon part (and this is my umpteenth attempt at lemon bars) by beating the mixture on med/high for a while until the texture was fluffy.  Also, I should probably have placed them on a middle or bottom rack as they browned and no one ever liked a brown lemon bar.  Some people are cooks, some are bakers, and I'm learning which I might be but I'll keep trying, thanks for the recipe!

These were really good!  The crust was a little thick for my taste, so next time I think I'll cut back to 1 1/2 c. flour, 2/3 c. powdered sugar and 3/4 c. butter.  The filling was wonderful.  I used about 4 lemons.  Fresh juice is a must!

I just ate my first piece of lemon bars that I've made for the first time. It was pretty good. A little sweet but not way too sweet for me and I did use a little less sugar but not by much. I was too anxious and tasted it warm. I can't wait to taste one when its cool. :) thanks! I'll definitly be making these again!

After making the crust I discovered that I only had 2 eggs.  EEK! Since the crust was already in the oven, I halved the filling recipe, cut the crust to fit a smaller pan, flipped it into the pan, (ate the reat of the crust) and went ahead with the recipe.  YUMMY!  It STILL turned out delicious, perfect combo of sweet and tart.  Next time I will be prepared!

My daughter and husband, neither lemon fans, really enjoyed these. I used a little less sugar and only juiced two lemons.  They did get too brown, I would keep a cookie sheet on the top rack the whole time next time.

These were excellent.   I made them for my class and they were a big hit.  The only problem I encountered was the crust. I cooked it until it was slightly golden, but after the second time through the oven it got pretty hard but my students  just ate around the hard edges, they were that good.  I plan to make these again.
This is a great recipe if you prefer a more tart lemon bar rather than very sweet.  I greatly prefer this recipe to the bake sale lemon bars.  The only changes I make to this recipe is substitute applesauce for butter in the crust and round up the lemon juice to a full cup.

Turned out good, but I used the advice to use an 8x8 pan.  I recommend cutting the crust ingredients in 1/2 if you do that.  You will need far less if you don't use the 9x13 pan.  I like the thickness of the bars in an 8x8 pan though.  If you use real lemon juice, as I did, maybe cut it down to 1/2 cup.  I did the 5/8 and it turned out a little sour.  Remember to cover your bars while baking because they will brown too much on top if you don't.  I will make again.

Very easy to make and taste delicious! The crust and the lemons make the perfect combination of sweet & tart. Will definitely make again!

Main complaint is that these don't keep well and get kinda gooey on top.  Following other reviewers' suggestions, I added lemon zest to the crust and decreased butter by 2 T.  I changed the top layer by lowering sugar to 1.5 cups and adding a tad more flour (1-2T).  Kept lemon juice at 5/8 cup and the flavor is wonderful.  I lined pan with aluminum foil for easier cleanup and removal from pan, but I should have sprayed sides with cooking spray.

I doubled the lemon juice since I love lemon bars to be extra tart. The filling turned out fantastically, but the actual cookie part was a bit too gooey. It was very hard to eat these without either a lot of napkins or a spoon. I'll make these again, but I'll alter the recipe a bit to make these more firm.

This was a good, sweet dessert, but it was too sweet for a lemon bar. I guess I was expecting it to be a little more tart.

I did what other reviewers suggested and added more lemon, the juice of four lemons to be exact. Next time I will follow what the recipe calls for as it was mouth-puckering lemony but still good.

These were really good.  I followed the suggestions left by previous reviewers to use less butter and sugar, changed the amount of lemon juice to 3/4 cup, and lined the pan with tinfoil for easy removal.  Turned out great, thanks Ralph.  And thank you to all the reviewers who left those helpful suggestions.

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought the crust was a little too firm, compared to the lemon part, and that overall, it was a bit too sweet. However, I will certainly make them again, just with a little less sugar. Also, I used parchment paper to line my pan, and had no trouble removing and cutting the squares.

These tasted great although following the specified time for pre-baking the crust made it a little crispier than I would have preferred for a shortbread. The lemon curd was very good. The overall appearance of these bars is not very appealing, but a dusting of powdered sugar definitely did the trick. These tasted better the next day. Next time I will add a few drops of yellow food coloring to enhance the curd appearance.

The crust is perfect - and the lemon is not too strong. Perfect consistency. They were better the day after I made them.

These are wonderful!  Since it's only me and my boyfriend, I cut this recipe in half and it turned out perfectly.  I used a glass pan sprayed with cooking spray, and they didn't stick at all.

Got good reviews from this recipe, but the edges of the crust were so hard that I had to cut them off to actually eat the rest!  Also note: don't line the pan with wax paper! :-S

I followed this recipe exactly after reading that some of the suggested changes bring unexpected results. I would however say it is VERY lemony and perhaps cutting down on the lemon juice and sugar in the filling might help. Otherwise it is VERY VERY good and definitely satisfied my lemon craving. It is much better after being chilled in the fridge for a few hours or overnight, which makes it the perfect "make ahead" type of dessert for a get-together. I did find that the baking time caused the top to brown quite a bit, but a dusting of powdered sugar took care of that and covered it.  The crust is very delicious and would be perfect for other desserts where the crust needs to be sweet. I would recommend this!!

How the heck can you measure 5/8 cup? I just used a bit shy of 1 cup of lemon juice. I added some zest to both the crust and filling. Very good, very easy, will make again! Thanks! Oh yeah, I also recommend cutting back on the butter by a few tablespoons.

These were so easy and so delicious! I didn't change any of the measurements, but I did cook the crust for about ~10 minutes longer than suggested so it would be crispier. They turned out great!

These are really easy to make and so delicious.  I also used 3/4 c lemon juice recommended by other reviewers and they were perfectly tart.  As a finishing touch I dusted them with a bit of confectioners sugar. Will definitely make again.

This was a special request by my boyfriend ... I've made him the box-type lemon bars before, but these were MUCH better.  I wanted them to be extra lemon'y, so I added a tsp. of lemon extract to the lemon mixture, as well as some lemon rind to the crust.  Definitely lemon'y, but not overwhelmingly.  YUM!!  I will make these again.

This recipe was very good. I did what others did, decreased butter to 3/4 cup and added almond flavoring. I also squeezed fresh lemon juice and used about 4 of them. It is very lemony tasting and very good. My father loved them.

These are so good!!  I made these to go with Christmas dessert, and since this was the first time that I was trying a lemon bar recipe, I was a bit nervous about the outcome.  They turned out fabulous!!  I made sure to use freshly squeezed lemon juice and increased the amount to 3/4 cup based on all of the reviews I read.  They did brown quickly once they had been in the oven for 15 minutes, so I baked them for 24 minutes rather than 30, and the consistency was perfect.  Also, I sprinkled them with a little powdered sugar once they cooled.  What a great recipe and a nice change from cakes and brownies.  Thanks!

Not lemony enough for me, and I even added 1tbs of the lemon rind.  They were very sweet, and got very brown around the edges.  I should've pulled mine out after 25 minutes instead of going the whole 30.

I love lemon squares. I thought I would try this recipe because of all the good reviews on it. I do agree that the lemon topping should be baked for 30 minutes. Also I used a glass baking dish and it was very hard to get the crust unstuck from the bottom. I recommend that before you start to make this you grease the pan or baking dish first if it is not a nonstick one.

I had limes instead of lemons, so I decided to experiment.  It turned out pretty good.  Although my filling started getting pretty brown on top before it was thoroughly cooked though.  The limes were a different twist, but I'd add less juice next time.  They were pretty tart.  And I added a few drops of green food coloring, so people would know the difference.  The crust was a little thick too.  I think that next time I make it, I will cut down the crust recipe.

If you want a really good lemony 'zip,' I definitely recommend adding lemon zest to the topping. I used 2 lemons' worth, which was perfect for us; I also added the pulp from the juicer. I was a little worried about the lemon topping when I first made it - it looked very gloopy - rather like custard. However, it did set nicely. I think this would also be nice served warm, straight-from-the-oven with some good vanilla ice cream.

I love these bars, they are great!  However, please cook in oven an additional 30 minutes, not 3 as is typoed here.  Also, I added 1 tablespoon of lemon zest to add more lemon flavor.  They bake with a top crust.

These are delicious!  I used fresh squeezed lemon juice and the zest from one lemon added to the mix. Additionally, for an extra lemon kick I grated another lemon zest and added that to the base layer. Very tart and fragrant.

I was worried these would not be lemony enough or that they might have a soggy crust or be too sweet because of so many reviewers' comments.  Oh my goodness, these are perfect just as the recipe reads!  Took them to church and everyone loved them.  Very, very good, and so easy to make!  Delicious, thank you!!

Love this recipe. It is delicious. Super sweet though, so I recommend making it and freezing squares for a later date unless you're having lemon-loving guests over.

They were very good! However the lemon filling never seemed to set fully and I added on a lot of cooking time. Eventually I had to take them out of the oven because the top was getting a little too brown. The crust was fine but the top of the filling was a little overcooked and the bottom was a little gooey

First time making them, Have to say I added a whole cup of lemon juice which gave them a nice lemon flavor. the only other thing I would do different is add a bit of Lemon zest to really set them off. all in all great recipe

These were absolutely delicious!!! First time making lemon bars from scratch, so I was a little nervous.  Nothing to worry about with this recipe.  Good advice is to use parchment paper...and even spray the paper with cooking spray to make sure the bars don't stick.  People ate 2 or 3 each at the party I brought them to. YUM!

Next to impossible to get out of the pan, the lemon part stuck to the knife and the shortbread was so hard you couldn't cut it. Taste was OK.

Terrific recipe! I followed instructions exactly as listed. If you are making this at altitude like me (7600 ft) increase the temperature to about 375 when baking the crust and give it extra time to brown the entire surface if necessary.

Yum! I've never made lemon bars before and I was concerned after checking reviews and all the changes. I decided to follow the submitter's instructions and make any changes, if needed, after tasting the original recipe. The first time I made them, my crust was a little to dark and a little too crispy for my liking.  They were excellent and the sifted xxx sugar on top hid the browning.  The 2nd time I made them, I did decrease the butter by 2 tablespoons and lowered the temp to 325 and did everything else as instructed. I gave most of them (minus 2 pieces) to my friend that loves lemon bars, and he thought they were the best ever. Try this one, it's so easy and so good.

I made these, kind of. I read all the comments and followed commenter Paige's recipe instead. I doubled the filling and had to cook them for twice the amount of time or more until it stopped jiggling and thickened up more. The powdered sugar in the crust was awesome tip! I did not use melted butter. The taste testers all want the recipe :)

Great basic recipe, will make again. Made once so far and cut the sugar a little and added the zest from a lemon to the crust. They were very good this way, but will try not melting the butter into the crust next time, as the crust turned out a little too firm for me this go around.

Everyone loved. If you really love super lemony favors, this is kind of on the mild side flavor wise, but the shortbread crust was yummy. Made exactly as written except added dash of salt to crust and some pulp and zest from 3 lemons to filling and powdered sugar dusting once cooked

I am not a fan of anything lemon.  I made these for a reception at my cousin's request.  They were delicious!!  A perfect blend of sweet and tart.  The shortbread crust is outstanding and is a perfect base for many other variations of bar recipes.  This recipe is easy to make and will quickly become a demanded item for family get togethers!

Like some suggested, I doubled the filling but I am not sure it was necessary.  I found the filling to be to strong.  If it we not so thick it probably would have been less overpowering.  I suggest make the recipe as is.

Love this recipe! It's always a hit. Sometimes, I make it with less sugar and it still tastes great. My sweet tooth changes a little while I am pregnant. But, there is NO need to do anything different because it is great as is.

I took these to work and they were a huge hit!  I made the recipe as is with ingredients on hand, even bottled lemon juice.   The crust was amazing and filling nice and tangy.  The ratio of crust to filling was just right.  Sprinkle with powered sugar for a pretty presentation.

As these were baking, I read all the horrible reviews and wished I hadn't bothered.  They turned out great!  I followed recipe exactly (except I didn't have butter, so used margarine instead :()  I will definately make again with butter and will try cutting it in cold as others have suggested.  I added about 1/3 cup of shredded coconut to my base just because I love coconut and it was really good.  I covered lightly with foil after about 15 mins because it started to brown and cooked for about an extra 5 mins.  I was afraid the filling wasn't "set" but after chilling for a while, they were really good!  Perfect lemon taste for my liking, not too much but just enough to make my mouth water.  Maybe it depends on the type of pan used but I had no issues with removing mine and the crust was not hard as others have mentioned.  I used a knife to loosen edges when just out of oven and cut into bars after chilling for about half an hour.  Please give it a try before making all the changes others have made.  If it doesn't work for you, THEN make adjustments.  I thought it was great the way it is.

Hard to pick apart this one... it's a keeper! The only thing I didn't do was melt the butter when making the crust. I cut in the butter til it was in very tiny crumbles. I may bake the finished product for only 20minutes next go but really, it was quite yummy!!! There's nothing wrong with this recipe, just the way it is!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe as written using fresh-squeezed lemon juice, just replacing 1 of the 2 c. of sugar with splenda and 1/2 c. of the butter with 1/2 calorie butter substitute (Move Over Butter) as a nod to health, and the end result is PERFECT (totally no fake-sugar aftertaste)!
Definitely a keeper!

I have made this recipe for years with some modifications.  I use 5 eggs and 1 full cup of lemon juice. After baked and cool I glazE with a lemon glaze that I color with food color for a bright lemony yellow.  These are yummy - VERY rich!

These are fantastic. Just got them out of the oven! I haven't had these in a long time. I made two changes. I decreased the butter to a 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup apple sauce. I also decreased the sugar to 1 3/4 cups. They are fantastic. You could probably decrease both a little more. Thanks for the recipe.

Made for teacher appreciation day at school, and was told they were the first to disappear.  Next time I make them, I won't melt the butter though--made it too hard to spread the crust in the pan I thought.  Baked for the minimum time.

These were tasty, but I made the mistake of doubling the lemon filling-too much! Next time I will go with 1 1/2.  Also, DO NOT melt butter-use very cold and cut in with pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs then press into pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

Crust was hard, no flavor at all. The filling was also very dry, not very lemony, overall a very big disappointment.

Such a delicious recipe! I am a huge fan of lemon desserts and this one was fantastic! The crust was so tasty! Next time I'll add less lemon juice, because it was a little too tart for me! All around delicious though!

Awesome!  Don't change a thing!  

Used tips on greasing pan/lining pan with parchment or foil/greasing again.  Makes it a breeze to take out of pan and to cut.  Also put a baggie on my hand to press crust into place - to avoid having half the recipe stick to my hand!

I also sifted confectioner sugar over the bars once they were cut.

Kudos, RCOMP!

My family loved this, they were gone within the day! I was excited to try these because I wanted to see if homemade bars were better than the lemon bars you make out of the box. Personally, the crust was better than the box, but the filling tasted generally the same (which isn't a bad thing, I actually love the lemon bars out of the box!). I don't think we'll ever go back to the box, though, because the handmade crust is much better. People were also talking about the oiliness of the crust. I agree, it was oily, which I will just put less butter in next time, but overall, it didn't make a difference in terms of taste, just maybe in terms of your fat intake! ;) Thanks for the recipe, it's going into the recipe book!

I totally agree with the review that said don't change a thing! sometimes you read reviews and think you'll have to make changes or you get turned off from trying the recipe because of all the suggested changes. There's nothing wrong with rearranging to suit one's taste but at least be fair and try or rate the recipe as shared. I followed this recipe to the letter and it was great. This was my first attempt at lemon bars and everyone I shared with loved them and asked me to make them again! I have a friend that has to be the pickiest person on  the planet and she loved them!! thanks RCOMP for sharing this great recipe!

My friends thought they were good, but I've definitely made better lemon bars. I think the crust is off somehow--too greasy.

Before I begin, know that I used to variation of the recipe submitted by Paige. (at the moment, second post down).  These bars were very good and had a nice light texture.  However, I would like to find a new recipe for the crust. It is good now, but has A TON of butter in it and the lemon flavor overpowers the crust flavor anyways.  I might try one of those pre-formed pie crusts and just make a pie out of it.

I have a recipe I have used 4/years and this one is much better because my old recipe the crust was oily and I followed the recipe but with Paige's tips.  The ONE tip I have for everybody is I have a $10 Black & Decker juicer from Walmart and I can get almost a whole cup out of 3 lemons....  It comes in so handy for recipes that call for juice.

I really liked these lemon square bars.  I crushed some pecans and mixed it in the crust. The only thing I would change is the amount of lemon juice used, I would used 1/2 cup as 5/8 cup was to much.  Thanks RCOMP for a great receipe.

I am disappointed in how this recipe turned out.  It seemed that the topping was frothy/fluffy when I poured it on to the crust.  The filling raised nicely and then flattened to a slight hint of lemon mess after cooling.  They weren't edible.  For so many positive reviews, I must have done something wrong.

I made this recipe as written, except that I didn't melt the butter for the crust, I put the crust ingredients in the food processor and pulsed.  At first bite I said 'Whoa, these are too sweet!'  But by the time I finished my piece I wanted another one.  My husband and father-in-law both ate two pieces and liked them.  I think the powdered sugar I dusted over the top was not necessary; if you do this, go easy with the stuff.  They were very easy to make, enjoy them.

There were so many changes that I was a little unsure what to do, so I followed the recipe AS IS. I don't understand why people were making so many changes these were absolutely perfect. My husband and I loved them so much.  Great recipe!

This recipe is idiot proof.  I made all kinds of mistakes, including removing from the oven too soon (I put it in the microwave to finish off), and realizing that I had no lemons after I started (I used lime juice and dried lemon zest).  I was sure that I was going to throw the whole pan out.  When we tasted the next day, these were pretty good. I positively loved the shortbread crust, and I did make this according to the instructions.  I am looking forward to using it in other recipes that call for graham cracker crust.  Yum.

This was just the lemon filling I was looking for--tangy and sweet.  A little lemon zest would make it even better.  That said, the crust had problems.  Melting the butter was very wrong, and I think there is too much powdered sugar in the crust; that combo made it greasy and hard.  Many of the 5 star reviews changed the crust in some way.  I will look for another recipe.

Lovely!  Added lemon zest to crust and doubled filling portion.  Used lime juice and still had a beautiful yellow color.

Was all crust and way too little filling. The opposite proportions from what I wanted. Tasted like a shortbread cookie with almost no lemon flavor and none of the gooey lemon that belongs on top.

So wonderful!!!  Just to make them a little healthier I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and used margarine instead of butter...turned out great.  Next time I will increase lemon juice a little (i like it to be very lemony and tangy!)

First I have to say that the flavor was very good. I followed the recipe to the T and I liked both the crust and the filling... BUT.... and here are the big problems: 1.  The crust ended up being twice as much as the filling.  I would cut the crust ingredients to half to end up with a decent crust thickness not a huge one. 2.  Even though the crust had a very good taste... it was extremely hard.  It was very hard to take it out of the pan and hard to cut. 3.  It never really did set.  Leaving it longer in the over just browned it. I will not make this again even though it had a very good flavor.

These were AWESOME, but I'll probably reduce the butter so that it won't be that high in calories or find another sort of crust to use [p.s: the butter would make it too wet and to make it dough-ish, too much of it would be made]

I've been making these lemon squares for 6yrs, and I wouldn't change a thing about them. They're amazing! I do squeeze the lemons for the juice myself, so I may be getting a different flavor than store-bought juice. No one has ever had anything but rave reviews for them.

I thought the overall flavor on the bar was excellent, the only change I will make next time (and there will be a next time) is to double up on everything.  The bar and lemon topping were very thin--but the flavor is fantastic.

Followed the recipe and they turned out perfect.  The only thing I would remember to do next time is pat the crust up the walls of the pan just a little bit, so that the lemon topping doesn't turn dark brown. Plus it would be easier to dish out.

Unlike many of the other reviewers, I made this recipe as written and found it to be excellent - exactly what I was expecting from a lemon bar.  The amount of sugar is appropriate for the amount of lemon.  I used the same oven temps recommended in the recipe, but I do always have an oven thermometer in my oven.  You really can't trust the knob/display on the oven.  An oven thermometer is so inexpensive and such a life saver when it comes to baking.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I have made these lemon bars twice now and this recipe is fabulous.  I have made a few modifications to the crust, however, that I have learned over the course of baking lots of bar cookies that really seem to do the trick.  First, I DO NOT melt the butter.  I start with room temperature butter (let it sit out over night) and cut it in with a pastry cutter until it is entirely crumbled into tiny tiny pieces.  Then, I knead the mixture with my hands until I have a dough-like mixture.  This process actually heats the butter just enough, providing a smoother-textured, less-greasy end product.  This recipe actually makes about a half cup too much crust for my taste, so I reserve it and sprinkle it on in places where the butter has become a little too liquidy.  Second, I zest four lemons and incorporate the zest in two places.  I use a zester that cuts long, thin strands, but a microplane would work just as well.  I press a quarter of the strands into the crust and then bake.  (Don't worry if your strands look dried out and brown when you take it out of the oven.  They will rehydrate when you put in the filling.)  The remaining zest and squeezed lemon juice just goes right into my filling.  This makes for a little extra zing and when cut into squares the strands can be seen and are beautiful!  Have some paper towels on hand when cutting to wipe your knife!  I have gotten rave reviews on this recipe.  I love to tweak, but with no modifications, I'm sure it would still be fantastic.

This lemon bars were good.  Not as good as I thought they would be given the reviews.  You really do have the double the filling or you will have way too much crust.  And I found that cooking them for 30 minutes didn't come close to enough time.  The bars didn't set at 30 minutes.  I cooked them for at least 45 minutes.

Very yummy, but way too sugary. Next time I will cut the sugar in half. Lining the pan with foil & then spraying it with Pam was a great idea, it was so easy to cut once it was pulled out of the pan.

1/2c + 2T = 5/8 c. I used Paige's review and made the crust (3/4c powder sugar, 3/4c butter, 1/4t salt, 2c flour. Press into pan. Bake 315 for 15-18 minutes). I kept the filling as stated in the recipe. Baked it at 350 for 20-25 minutes. And these are by far the most amazing lemon bars I've ever eaten. I brought this to a family dinner and they were gobbled up. The crust is like a shortbread cookie and the lemon filling is just enough.

YUM!  I have made lemon bars before and they haven't turned out very well.  These were fantastic!  Followed the suggestions given by the most popular reviewer at top of the list below recipe and they were indeed perfect.  I can't stop eating them!  I have a tree full of lemons . . . dangerous!!

I followed Paige's modified recipe (from the comments below), and they came out wonderfully. They're the best, most lemony lemon squares I've ever tasted.

Made these for a co-worker's birthday (at his request.)  Everyone LOVED them! The top did brown a little too much (my fault), but as my family says, "They eat the same."

the lemon flavor was perfect for me. tartness is a matter of personal preference in lemon bars, if you like it more lemony, add more juice. i made it both ways and preferred the recipe as-is.

Yummy so good!These were absolutely wonderful! I love lemon so I added 1tsp of lemon zest to the crust and 1 tsp lemon zest to the filling. Instead of melting the butter I cut it into the flour with a pastry mixer.

These were absolutely AWESOME... I was worried at first, because I accidentally added the sugar directly into the eggs and beat that first, THEN I added the lemon juice into the egg mixture... and i was concerned that the mixture was too murky and frothy... wasn't sure what to expect.  Well.. the lemon filling did brown, which I'm pretty sure was not desirable, so I dusted it with confec. sugar and all was well...  I will make these again and again.  I was told they were "bakery-quality" by many people.

i only had one stick of butter so i used it and a little veg oil with some lemon juice for the crust.  it came out awesome.  didnt make any changes to the filling and it came out WAY too runny.  The cooking time definitly needed to be increased and covering it with foil for half the cooking time probably would have been a good idea as well. also i thought 5/8 cup of lemon juice was way way way too much.  the filling had a good flavor but that much lemon juice made the filling even more runny. i think a half a cup of lemon juice would work just as well and maybe give it a little less of a lemon meringue pie taste. i always make a recipe at least twice before throwing it out. i will make them again with a few changes and see how they come out.

It turned out really well - I thought the flavor was delicious, the crust was just right. The only issue I had - and this may just have been my fault b/c it's my first lemon bar - was the cooking time. It seemed to take about 45 minutes to bake (or not be jiggly). I finally took it out and just let it set and cool, hoping it would firm up then. Otherwise, it was PERFECT as written.

this was so easy and simple!  i definitely agree with others the butter should be cut in cold (as with most pastry shells/crusts) because it really does make a huge difference.  i made as-is and would not change a thing... however, i personally like the almost even ratio of crust to filling.  this one is a keeper!

I made this using key limes instead of lemons and it still came out beautifully! Squeezing and draining those limes was a little more effort, but so worth it!

I love anything with lemon in it, but these just weren't my thing.  I followed the directions to a T, but sadly mine turned out very chewy and not very lemony.  I'll keep looking, but thanks for posting the recipe.

This lemon bar was good. It cooks really fast though and you have to watch the crust really closely. Just keep an eye on it and you'll have a lemon bar you'll enjoy!

I didn't have confectioner's sugar so I just used regular sugar in the crust. Also some sort of wheat flour. I quartered the recipe and used six custard cups. Taking into consideration what I didn't have, they came out tasting pretty good. Nice and lemony and tart.

Fantastic! I used a 9 x 12 jelly roll pan and it worked perfectly. These are the best lemon squares I have made. I did add about 2 Tablespoons of lemon zest to the filling, used 1 full cup of lemon juice  and added about 1 teaspoon of lemon extract to the crust. Turned out wonderful. The crust is buttery but not greasy at all if done right. The flavor is excellent. Thanks for sharing this awesoem recipe.

These were fantastic! I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and they were wonderful! I will definitely make them again.  One suggestion: When transferring to the oven, the lemon filling sloshed around in the pan and burned on the edges. For a prettier look, wipe off the sloshed part with a paper towel after it's in the oven.

I wasn't overly impressed. They were very very sweet and didn't have much lemon flavor. Also watch the baking time, mine came over very overdone.

If you follow the recipe exactly, as I have done twice (by accident, I forgot I had made this already) you WILL get a hard crust and not much lemon flavor. I will either find another recipe or use the suggested changes to this one. But as is this one is no better than a "3". My in-laws liked it but they are used to over-baked, really "crunchy" baked goods.

These were quick, easy and very popular with the guests.  I added the grated rind from 1 lemon and 1 t lemon extract to pump up the flavor.

Way too much sugar. It is sickly sweet- wish I had taken the advice of others and lessen the sugar. I'm sure it would've been better if I'd done so. The sugar drowns out the taste of everything else.  Will make again with less sugar.

Tasted really good. I had to take them out of the oven at 20min as the top was starting to turn really , really brown!
The outside was dry and the centre was really gooey. But they tasted really good. THe bottom was a little dry, not too sure what I did wrong. Tasted kind of flour like. I added lemon zest and lemon juice to both the crust and the filling part. I also used a little yellow food coluring for fun.
Husband was a little shocked how "lemony" they were. But I liked them that way and were not tart at all.
Will try this recipe again.

It was ok, not really what I had expected. This was actually about my fouth time making lemon squares and this was a not great but not horrible recipe. The picture shows that they are really vibrant in color and are bright yellow. Mine were a bit light and they definately did not take on 30 minutes to bake. They took a good hour, if not more. I probably will not try this recipe again.

This was very good, although I admit I made some minor modifications. I added lemon zest to the crust, watching it carefully so that it was barely golden brown before taking it out of the oven. When I made the filling, I used a 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk instead of the sugar & I left the flour out. I like mine lemony, so I used about 3/4 cup lemon juice. Delicious!!

I followed this recipe exactly and the cooking times were not long enough or filling just doesn't set up enough. I was hoping for something more sturdy and less messy. Other than the soggy squares, the taste wasn't bad. But by the next day there were mushy and didn't get eaten by anyone but me. I may try 2 smaller pans and cook them longer if I use this recipe again.

This was my first attempt at making lemon bars. I waded through many reviews and did make a couple of changes based on other comments: 1. added 1/4 tsp salt to base (I was using unsalted butter), 2. added more flour to the crust to prevent it from becoming too greasy, 3. added a couple drops of yellow food coloring to the curd mixture, 4. covered the pan with foil after 15 minutes to prevent curd from browning, and 5. dusted the bars with sugar after cutting, not before. A really nice recipe - thanks! Pretty easy to make and tasted delicious. Some tang, but not too much. Great for a party! Oh, and I "cheated" and used all bottled lemon juice.

That was my face after eating one of these! Wow! I really don't like lemon squares, but I loved these! The only things I changed was to add some lemon peel to the crust and add a touch more flour to the lemon mix. These were a fantastic hit at game-night, and I think all of my friends experienced severe sugar-and-lemon overdoses.

I just made these a couple hours ago, ran to an appointment came back and tried one. REALLY GOOD. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. I made them in a glass dish and they just pop right out..I was a little worried because when I took the crust out to put on filling, it bubbled up when i poured it on..but alls well. They are great !

I thought the filling was kind of thin. Next time I'll probably increase the filling by half. I also thought that they were not lemony enough, even though I increased the amount of juice to 2/3 cup. I'll probably go with a cup next time. I like super tart and super lemony and these were definitely not it. Thanks for the basic recipe though.

My boyfriend and my family loved these squares. I had never made anything like them before and they turned out so well!
Changes I made:  margarine instead of butter (1 for 1), wheat bran flour instead of all purpose (1 for  1), 1.5 cups white sugar (not 2), 1 cup lemon juice (not 5/8 cup), cut final baking time down to 20 minutes instead of 30 (it seemed way too long). They turned out spectacularly ! Not too lemony at all. My mom said she could tell they were made with a different type of flour, but I think that comes with baking experience.

Absolutely addictive.  I used 3/4 cups of lemon juice as advised by previous reviewers... on the verge of being heart burn inducing, maybe 5/8 cups would be better. I used the crust recipe from "Love the Mama Lemon Bars".

Oh man these are good.
I'd been searching for the perfect recipe after my mother's lemon tree went bananas this year and I ended up with a million lemons I didn't know what to do with.
THIS is the recipe I was dreaming of... drooling over!  Ah, lemony bliss.  Perfectly tart & sweet.
(I followed the previous reviewer's modifications, no complaints.)

They are great but I also modified the recipe per other reviewer.. 3/4 cup of cold butter, kept the same amt of sugar and flour and added a bit of lemon zest.  Used almost 1 cup of lemon juice and reduced the sugar a little.  They tasted great with the modification, but the ingredients remained the same, so deserve 4 stars:)

I made these for Christmas, and they were a huge hit. My cousin asked if he could take some home with him, and he is usually the type to not want any leftovers from holiday meals, as he wants to get back to healthy eating right away.

I did cover the pan with foil during the last 10 minutes to lessen any browning, and when they were cool, I dusted the top with powdered sugar. Otherwise, I made this recipe exactly as it was writtten, and it was delicious! I would not change a thing.

These were great and I like the filling better than the Betty Crocker recipe. It was firmer.  I also like that the recipe makes a full 13x9 pan rather than a smaller square pan.  Here were my commplaints: the crust dough was way too soft to push into the pan. I had to add some more XXX sugar to make it a bit firmer.  Secondly, I added lemon zest since I wanted more of a lemon bite.  And take the other reviewers' advice and COVER these with foil halfway through cooking.  They brown really fast.

Great lemon flavor and the crust was good, however, I should have covered the pan with foil when I placed them in the oven.  They browned too quickly and I wound up with brown lemon bars.

Mmmm! I made these taking the advice of others and cutting down on the butter by 2 tbs and baking the crust 2 min longer. I added a little lemon extract to the custard because i was 2tbs shy of the 5/8c lemon juice and had to sub orange juice.  I also baked it a little while longer and covered it with foil halfway through because it browns WAY too fast. I should have used parchment paper because it is kind of hard to get out of the pan. So good though.  This was my first time eating or making lemon squares and it was easy and sooo yummy!

A fool-proof recipe for a classic dessert bar. I used the fake lemon juice because I had it on hand, I'm sure it would step up a notch with the real stuff.

Very good.  However, the first time I made these the middle was too soft, needed to bake longer. It might have been my oven since we have had problems with it before. The second time I tried it, I increased the time an extra 20 minutes, and it came out great.  If you do have this problem, make sure you keep an eyes on it so the top doesn't brown too much.  I made this again the other night, and the lemon flavor seemed too strong.  I think I will decrease it along with less sugar in the crust.

These were very good.  Nice, thick, sweet lemon filling.  The crust was okay.  I used unsalted butter, maybe they would have been better with regular butter, or if I'd added a pinch of salt.  Regardless, I will make these again!

Very good and very quick and easy to make! However I did find that they did burn at all the edges and were very hard to cut out. A hint from experience: Add the powdered sugar AFTER cutting will make it easier to cut. but very delicious anyhow!

I wanted to use up some lemons we had, and this was a good choice.  I had to follow the suggestions of others, a little less powedered sugar, a little less butter, less white sugar, and more lemon juice.  They still turned out incredibly sweet.  I think I left the bottom pastry part in the oven too long because in the end it turned out a little hard, but it was still a great treat!

Ok, I have never seen someone measure out 5/8th, I put approximately 1 cup of lemon juice and called it Even haha.  It turned out to be a perfect amount.  The taste of the lemon came out real well.  Beware of the cooking time.  It says 30 minutes, but after 20 minutes i went to check on it and it had already browned.  I wasn't too excited about the taste of the Crust, Kind of bland.  This recipe was Good, but Not Great.

These are total heaven.  The crust is great and the lemon is not too tangy.  They are very easy to make, as they don't require anything I don't always have around.  I get requests for them all the time.  EXCELLENT!

I have tried most of the lemon bars recipes and always come back to this one. Keep the crust recipe the same even though there will be left overs.Bake for 12 minutes    For the filling, I used 8 eggs, 1 cup sugar, 2 tsp baking powder, 5/8 cup organic lemon juice and 1 packet of true lemon. (it can be found in the baking aisle)Bake squares for 25 minutes and cover with foil the entire time.

These lemon squares were a HUGE hit with friends at our super bowl party.  The only problem I had was that the top seemed to burn before they were cooked through.  I had to turn the heat way down and cook them for much longer.  I just covered up the brown spots on top wiht powdered sugar and they tasted amazing!

I don't know what was going on here?  The crust was good but I think it was way too thick as others had said.  The bars were also too sweet for me.  I did only use 1/2c of fresh lemon juice but I think next time I would cut the sugar by about 1/2c.  I might make this again but not make as much crust, add the right amount of lemon juice and cut some of the sugar.  Good basic recipe though.

These were the best lemon bars I ever made.  My family couldn't get enough of them.  I did add a topping of crushed graham crackers & a tablespoon of sugar mixed with melted butter and sprinkled it over the top of the bars when they were slightly cooled.  They looked more finished.

Very good! I made these twice. The family loved them. The crust needed to be baked by itself longer than 15 minutes, so it took a while longer. But the time was worth it!

These are delicious.  I made them for a card party and everyone raved about them.  I line the pan with tin foil right up over the sides and spray with Pam.  That way, you can lift the foil right out of the pan which makes them easier to cut.

The filling was good, I added extra lemon, and the zest of one lemon.  I thought the crust had too much butter, it made it taste a little greasy, and the crust was to thick for my taste, I will make this again, but will only use half the butter and press it into a larger pan.

So good.  This was my 1st attempt at lemon squares and we all loved them.  The crust is absolutely delicious and the whole flavor is just perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.  By the way, I halved the recipe and made it an 8 in round pan and it worked very well.  I also buttered the pan well and had no problem with sticking.

I made this along with other baked goods for a friend's birthday party. The lemon bars were the runaway favorite! I had some feedback saying it was too sweet, so adjust according to your own taste. The butter for the crust can also be cut by a third, using water to get the doughy consistency. Make sure to cool completely before cutting, and use a clean knife! Consider sugaring the top to hide the browning and make it more presentable. And beware - they're addictive!

Wasnt what I was expecting. Too much crust and not enough custard. Used a rectangle glass baking dish and put a strip of wax paper along the legnth and it really helped to pop it out of the pan.

A great basic recipe.  I reduced the amount of sugar in the filling slightly and added some grated lemon rind to the crust and filling.  It added good colour and taste.  Delicious and easy to make!

ABSOLUTELY HEAVENLY.  I LOVE THE 'ALLOW TO COOL COMPLETELY BEFORE CUTTING INTO BARS' - WHO COULD WAIT THAT LONG? THE BEST RECIPE I HAVE FOUND FOR THESE SO FAR.

These were very lemony and it was hard to stop eating them. It took me 10 med size lemons to get the juice needed. I think I actually used a little shy of 3/4 c juice. Almost better than lemon meringue pie. I've only ever fixed the "box mix" lemon bars, and was surprised how simple this was and how delish! I was a little nervous because they got deep golden brown before they were set, I let them continue to cook, and it came out great. I will make these again, thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty.  I decreased the butter by 3 tablespoons and it turned out fine.  The only other thing was they weren't quite lemoney enough. Next time I make it I am going to use more lemon juice.

These are *so* good - better than at my favorite bakery.  Cut back powdered sugar in crust to 3/4 cup and reduced butter by 2 Tbsp.  For filling, only used 1.5 cups sugar and increased lemon juice to 3/4 cup.  Even my boyfriend who usually hates lemon desserts liked this one! :)

These were delicious!  I read the other reviews, and reduced the sugar and butter as was suggested.  I also added about a teaspoon of lemon zest.  Baking at 325 kept these bars from getting too brown, they looked picture perfect right out of the oven, a sprinkle of powdered sugar and YUM!  Even with the small changes, this recipe is a keeper!  Thank you!

not the BEST lemon squares I have ever tasted, but defintely the best i have ever made! I think you could cut out 1-2 TBSP of butter from the crust without a problem (it was a little greasy for me).  I also think next time I will 1 1/2 the recipe or cook it in a 8X8 pan to make them a little thicker.  And the powdered sugar on top is definitely a good idea because otherwise they are a little ugly :>)  Definitely a keeper of a recipe though....I will make these again!

Excellent. Nice and lemony, and gooey with thick lemon filling.  I was skeptical when I saw how sticky the crust dough was, but it came out great!

I followed the recipe and they were wonderful. (I wish more people would review the atual recipes, rather than their own versions.  It would be more helpful.) These were just the way a lemon bar should be.  Not too sweet, not too tart.  Nice consistency, buttery crust.  This will be my lemon bar recipe from now on.

I made these for easter I accidently overcooked them in the shuffle of things and they were still amazing! Everyone loved them I used 4 lemons as recomended by other posts which amounted to 3/4 cup and they were perfectly lemony with great tang.

OH MY!  I made these today and they are fantastic!  There's a bakery at Chicago O'Hare airport that has the BEST lemon bars ever I've ever tasted.  I get one every time I pass through.  I must say, these give the bakery version a definite run for the money!  Thanks for sharing.....  Oh, I also used 4 lemons... perfect tartness!

I totally agree that this recipe will replace any store bought mixes; and I will also agree to the 3/4c lemon juice.  These turned out super great!  I didn't want to use confectioner's sugar, so I used regular Splenda (in the light yellow bag) in the crust--which turned out perfect, and used the Splenda Baking sugar with my eggs.  WONDERFUL!!!

These are amazing.  I impressed my friends by making them on New Year's Eve...me who can't bake or cook at all!  They were easy to make and the recipe was dead-on.  On advice of other reviewers, I used 3/4 cup lemon which my best friend thought would be too much at first.  Once she tasted them though she agreed 3/4 was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have personally never been a fan of lemon bars, so I didn't actually try these.  I made them over the holidays, and they were an absolute hit!  I will have to make this again in the future for partys or pot-lucks.

I can't make these very often...at least that's what I was told by my 15 year old daughter who couldn't eat just one! These were wonderful! They were gone the first day I made them! I thought it was an easy recipe too. The only thing I did different was I added 3/4 cup of lemon juice. I did add a little less butter to the crust also. I sprinkled powder sugar on the top after they baked. Delicious!

I made these at the last minute for Christmas because I couldn't find my families favorite recipe. We were disapointed in the lack of lemon flavor, and the overall bland taste of the bar. It did help to put a lemon glaze over the bars. Sorry, I'll be going back to my old recipe.

I halved this recipe because I am the only person in my family who enjoys lemons! The lemon bars were delicious and I was glad to have them all to myself.  I used Splenda instead of white sugar with good results.

Thanks alot Ralph.  I must have added an inch to each thigh with these.  These are beyond fabulous.  I had to lie to my boyfriend and tell him that friends came over to help me eat them.  Rich and buttery.  Everything I love.

These are amazing.  And if you don't know anything about baking, you WILL NOT mess this up.  Guaranteed  My boyfriend loved these.  The crust is not too thick, and there if just the right balance of tart and sweetness.

I am replacing my 3-star rating with a 5-star... these were a really good texture, and tasted just right.  I used 2 lemons which was actually about 3/4 cup (slightly more than the 5/8).  They look better after they've thoroughly cooled... at first I thought they were way too buttery because the butter was oozing through the top and they smelled like eggs.  I will be making these again!

I have gotten so many compliments on these lemon bars.  They are quite potent and sweet, but they have been a winner for me at Easter, mother's day, etc.  I make sure to use Meyer lemons for the juice.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used to make this recipe 15 years ago and was thrilled to find it on allrecipes.com.  The crust is buttery and good and the filling is tart and sweet.  My family was thrilled to eat our "lemon squares" again.  Thanks for posting it!

These are the best lemon squares I have ever tasted!  The lemon doesn't overpower the crust - just how I like it.  Although, they don't refridgerate very well...

I make lemon square bars at least twice a month.  I usually make an 8x8 size.  I use the zest of one lemon and a 1/2 (yes, one half) cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice.  So when making a 9x13 inch batch, that would be the zest of two lemons and 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  I (and friends/colleagues) LOVE the intense lemon flavor.  The amount of sugar in the recipe keeps that amount of lemon from making you pucker.  (I also prefer to cut cold butter into the flour/powdered sugar for the pastry crust...melted butter doesn't affect the taste, but I think the crust is much more tender and delicate this way.)  Happy baking!

I thought it was OK, but my mom loved it, so I'm meeting in the middle. I used an 8x11.5 inch pan, which I would not recommend. It's more cake height than bar height now.

I liked this recipe for its simplicity. However, I used real lemons for the juice and added grated lemon rind to the crust. Next time I will use a smaller pan because the filling was not thick enough. Will make this again. Love the lemon flavour.

LOVED these!! I reduced the 2 cups of flour for the crust to 1 3/4th cup flour. I baked the crust for 12, rather then 15 minutes (I have a gas stove so it cooks faster). Just keep an eye on it. Let the crust cool a little before you pour the lemon batter on it. I baked for 22 minutes, rather then 30 again b/c of the gas stove. Delicious!!

So I only made the filling from the recipe as I chose to use an oatmeal crust to add more texture. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan. I added the amount of lemon juice called for and added lemon zest from 1 lemon to it as well. I messed up and only used 1.5 cups of sugar in the doubled recipe (I usually like to use less sugar than called for, but I WOULD HAVE used 3 cups in this case) and I'm glad that I did because it was perfectly sweet enough for me. I can't imagine what 3 cups of sugar would have tasted like!

I have never made or tried lemon squares before so I wasn't sure how they would turn out.  

This recipe was very easy to follow but I would like to add that for first time makers of this recipe, you may have to cook the crust for a little bit longer than the 15 mins.  I had to cook mine for 20.  Also for those not used to making lemon squares, I didn't know that it was okay for them to still be "jiggly" in the oven and would finish setting once they had cooled completely.

Still came out great though!  Will be making this again!

I used Paige's recommendations.  Finally a less sweet lemon bar that really lets the lemon flavor shine through!!!  My lemons were a little small so to get the max juice from them I microwaved them for about 30 sec and then rolled them back and forth.  Juicy juicy juicy!

Perfectly delicious as is.  The second time around I tried pulsing cold butter with the flour and confectioners' sugar in my food processer and then pressing it into the pan.  I also added lemon zest for a little extra tang.  Can't go wrong with this recipe.

I love anything with lemon in it and this is no exception! I changed the recipe just a tad. For the crust, I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 of Stevia because we're trying to cut sugar and calories out of our diet and I used softened/room temperature butter, not melted. I sprayed oil on the pan, lined with parchment paper and sprayed again, a must!  The dough was very crumbly, but so easy to put in the pan. I just used my fingers to spread. There is no need to add salt to the dough. Using a whisk for the custard part is essential so that you don't get little lumps. I didn't have to use a hand mixer as in the video. I also added 1 TBL of flour to the custard because last time it came out too gooey.  I cooked the crust for 19 minutes and then cooked the entire thing for 30 minutes. After the 30 minutes were done, I shut off the oven and let it stay inside for 5 minutes. Overall, a delicious  recipe.

I read a few reviews and decided to make it without any changes.  It was delicious and coworkers raved.  I did bake the crust longer than the recipe stated as every oven is different and I used a glass 9x13 dish.  I baked until the edges were golden.  The crust was a perfect shortbread.  The lemon flavor was intense and perfectly balanced with the sweetest of the recommended amount of sugar.  Only one piece left over that tasted even better the second day!

Oh my goodness!!  These were soooo good!!! And they were so easy to put together!!! I loved that I didn’t have to cut the butter into the flour for shortbread base, mixing it up was a breeze and the texture didn’t suffer at all. I added only one thing: the zest of the lemons I squeezed for the juice and it was a nice addition. I took these bars to a dessert fellowship at church and the platter was soon empty. Will definitely make these again and they are on the list of recipes for tea parties!

The 2 star rating is for the modified recipe by other bakers.  
    I found that if you are cutting the butter into the dry ingredients for the crust you need the 1 c. butter the recipe calls for.  Otherwise, like my crust, there is not enough fat to keep the crust from cracking.  However, if you plan on melting the butter then adding it to the dry ingredients per the recipe, the amount of butter can be cut down to 3/4 c.
    In my opinion, because the modifications (which I agree with) call for 3/4 c. fresh lemon juice plus lemon zest to boost the lemon flavor, the 2 c. granulated sugar which the recipe calls for is accurate.  Reducing the sugar to 1-1/4 c. causes an imbalance of tartness to sweetness.  The taste was akin to under sweetened lemonade.  To save the lemon squares I made with the modified recipe amounts I made a vanilla icing to try to balance out the flavor.
    One last thing, the squares bake up pretty flat in a 9x13 pan.  Either make 1-1/2 the filling or use a smaller pan.

Simple, classic, fresh lemony delicious. I cut back on the butter in the crust by substituting some vegetable shortening but it wasn’t as good.  Going to make again w all butter but cut back by 2 tbsp as read in another review.

These are delicious!  The times were right on. I used 2 big lemons to get the exact amount of lemon juice. I used an 8x8 glass pan and a loaf pan. One to share and one for the family. It was the perfect amount. And using spray, then parchment, then spray again was such a great tip! We wouldn’t want any of that lemony goodness left in the pan. This is my go to lemon bar recipe for sure!

Dear lord, these are REALLY good. Like, stand-in-line-for-an-hour-at-a-fancy-bakery good. Super tart, lemony filling and a chewy, slightly sweet, buttery, succulent crust. Slight changes: Used 2/3 lemon juice and whole wheat flour.

I would make these again and again.

The crust turned out fine.  Took about 8 minutes longer to bake than on the recipe.  However the filling was a disaster.  It did not set properly and it had what I would say was an eggy texture.  Threw them out as they could not be cut or served properly.

Great recipe, I use lemon zest in it to make it more lemony.
Not sure who came up with 5/8 what a difficult measure - it seems OK with 1/2 cup and a bit.

These are delicious!!  Instead of melted butter in the crust I cut in cold butter.  Also did as Naples and did 1 1/2 times the lemon filling, just because, and glad I did :)  because of this though I had to add on about 12 minutes of cook time.  Husband devoured two of them after dinner, and I had to stop him as he was reaching for another lol.

Great lemon bars! The only thing I did differently was I used softened, not melted butter and I added about 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the crust as I saw another reviewer suggest. They were awesome. I could eat the whole pan! Flaky, buttery crust, nice lemon flavor!

It's a great basic recipe as written - and easy! Based on other reviews I increased the filling by 25% and added 5 minutes to the baking time of both the crust and the bars and it came out perfect. I just wanted them a little thicker than it looked like they would have been with the initial recipe - personal preference only.

I made these delicious lemon bars a few times and they came out perfect every single time.  I did not make any changes to the original recipe and they were sweet and slightly sour from the lemons just how I like them. I tried making these bars with and without aluminum foil so the bars won't stick and I found that the aluminum foil stuck to the bars, even though I put nonstick spray on the aluminum foil.  So if you are going to try this recipe then follow it exactly and do not put any foils or wraps at the bottom of the dish.

These were very yummy!   I doubled the recipe and it still turned out great!  When serving it, if refrigerated before hand I would let warm up a bit!  This is a great dessert to serve to a crowd and it will be gone before you know it!

These are the best!  I used to get lemon bars from a gourmet bakery and I loved them!  Unfortunately they closed down and I have never found anything as delicious. Then I made these!  They taste just like them!  The only thing I did differently was I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice instead of 5/8.  I made them for dessert for a BBQ and everyone asked to take some home!

These lemon bars were amazing! The recipe is so simple and easy to follow. The crust was a little oily so I'm not sure if next time I should use less butter or bake it longer. Also, I added 2Tbls lemon zest. It was the perfect combination of sweet and tart. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Excellent recipe! I get tons of complements every time. Put the whole thing in the freezer before cutting. When the crust is frozen, these are much easier to cut. They are so good, we sometimes eat them right out of the freezer!

Excellent recipe, my family and book club raved about it.

I made one change. I added a couple of pinches of salt to the base, AND a couple of pinches to the custard sauce also.--not enough to taste salty, but it increases the "richness," and cuts blends the lemon and sugar flavors perfectly.

They are very good, but lean more towards tart than other lemon bars I've had. It might be a five with real lemon juice.

The crust was perfect with 2T less butter. Was hoping for a better lemon taste. Maybe fresh lemons or a splash of lemon extract. It did stick but I could have prepared the pan better.

This is  one of my "go to" dishes when I have to bring something.   I use the ingredients in the recipe and follow the directions exactly.  I love them as is.  The *only* thing different is just lazy math skills.  5/8ths cup of anything is odd to me so I used 3/4 and call it close enough.  I don't count that as changing the recipe. :) (2 tablespoons off, I can live with that)

just ok.  I made exactly how recipe states.  I thought it was a bit to sweet.  I think i would take note of the other comments and cut back on sugar.

I often make this recipe and always receive compliments on it and recipe requests. I bake it in an 8x8 pan. It takes longer to bake but it makes the thickness of the crust and filling perfect!

I don't know why everyone is tweaking the original recipe so much,  this is almost exactly like the recipe my nana used to make lemon squares 70 years ago, the only difference is the butter in the crust is softened not melted in hers. If you don't find it lemony enough, it is probably your lemons. Since my nana passed 28 years ago, I have been the designated baker if these for my family and have actually found I get a sharper lemon flavor using bottled juice rather than fresh squeezed and have NO need for zest or extract. I lost my recipe for a time when I moved across the country and had to go searching for a similar one and this is the closest one I've found.  Thanks for submitting!!

I am a rookie baker and these came out great. I followed the original recipe in addition to the feedback provided by "CareBear". I used Minute Main real frozen lemon juice and I increased everything in the crust by 25% to make a thicker bar. I greased the glass baking pan with Crisco spray on Butter and nothing stuck! The crust will be firm, so use a firm knife for cutting. I will def make these again!

I made this recipe today and it was AMAZING!  I could hardly stay away from it.  Made the exact recipe except baked the crust for 17 min.  I plan to take this dish for Easter dinner and I'm sure it will be a hit.

Dreamy. Always a great go-to! Lemon works well for summer, but the dense richness and powdered sugar dusting makes this dessert work for fall/winter also.

Well I read the reviews and tried adding the additional lemon juice, and reducing the butter and confectionery sugar. I also followed the baking instructions exactly and the crust came out BURNT.

The recipe was very good, it needed a few adjustments however. If you instead of using melted butter, you would not melt it and cut it in as if you were making pastries. Also if you add just another tsp. of lemon juice it isn't too sweet. Overall a very good recipe and easy to make.

Hubby and work mates loved them.  Didn't change a thing. Did line pan with parchment paper as no matter what I do or don't do, any lemon bars/squares stick to pan :(

These are really tasty. I did follow the recipe per the letter on this one. You could totally cut back on the butter and sugar in the crust by 1/4 c each with no problems but its tasty just the way it is.

I made these today and they were very good with a few exceptions.  My oven is typically very accurate but the crust got too brown when baking it for 15 minutes and the filling got too dark baking it for 30.  Could be that I should have lowered the temperature since I did not use a glass pan but the same metal one as shown on the video.  

The only small change was I added the zest from one lemon to the crust mix before baking. 

One note regarding the video.  I sprayed my pan with a cooking spray and then put in parchment and sprayed that as suggested.  It made it almost impossible to get the bars out and I have never had this trouble before. I lost half the bars. Won't do that again. 

The flavor of the bars and crust was very good.  I used Meyer lemons and they always add flavor. 

Any tips on storing them so they don't get soggy?

I am not a lemon lover but had a craving for something with lemon in it. I made these lemon bars this past weekend and I LOVED THEM. Can't or should I say, shouldn't eat too many at once. I would make this and bring it the next gathering in a heart beat!!

After reading other reviews I doubled the amount of filling but cut back on the sugar by 25%. I love lemon and am fortunate to have a Meyer Lemon tree outside my front door. As with all lemon bars I always add some lemon zest to the filling. I like short bread cookies so the crust was perfect. To the crust I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. I liked that the recipe said it made 1 9"x13" pan and not some rediculously large number of itty bitty bars. When it comes to dessert, small is something I don't know how to do.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written except i added lemon zest to the crust and to the lemon egg mix. The crust is very good, but there is not enough filling to balance it out. The lemon curd should be at least as thick as the crust. And, yes, it needs more lemon tartness.

I made a half batch following the recipe (no modifications).  The filling looked set and browned  after just 22min at 350F so I took it out of the oven.  (Maybe it is just my oven, but I would recommend keeping an eye on them after about 20min.)  The flavor is just ok, not quite lemony enough for my taste.  I think I would prefer a higher filling to crust ratio.  After making the recipe, I read reviews with suggestions to increase the filling, use extra lemon juice, and put lemon zest in the crust.  Those modifications sound promising, but I think I'll try a different lemon bar recipe next time.

Follow up note after overnight refrigeration: the filling consistency was better, but the crust had become rather hard.  A hard crust was mentioned in other reviews as being a result of using melted butter in the mix.

I have made lemon bars so many times before but this time couldn't find my recipe. Thinking that all lemon bars/ squares equal I made this one because it had the most stars and great reviews. That was my first mistake.

Just made this recipe for the first time. I always like to try a recipe as is before trying any of the recommended changes. I'm a huge lemon bar fan, I love the tart sweet flavor. However these were FAR to sweet for me and everyone who tried them said that they are to sweet to have more than a bite or two. I also dislike the crust way to buttery flour tasting. Not the traditional lemon bar crust. Not sure if melting the butter made the difference to traditional lemon bar crust and if would be better if left cold. If you like your lemon bars really sweet this is for you otherwise look somewhere else. Guess I'll continue the search for the perfect lemon bar.

This is so rich and sweet it tastes like a European pastry. I added lemon zest, and wished I'd baked it only 25 minutes, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I'll be making this again and again!

I cut these into rather small pieces - 30 - and served them for a potluck on cupcake wrappers. They're sticky, so the wrappers kept them neat and attractive.

I needed a dessert for 15 hard working men, so I tried this recipe out - my first attempt at lemon squares. I made them exactly as the recipe said, and they turned out perfect! A huge hit with the guys, and their wives, who asked for the recipe. The only recipe I will use for lemon squares.

I always rate a recipe as it is written, because it bothers me when people rate it after they've done a bunch of stuff to the original recipe. How can anyone know if it's good or not?  So, this is an honest review.  I made no changes.  I've made this 3 times now and it's excellent every time.  Now, saying that, I have also made one change one time I made it. I used freshly squeezed lemon juice rather than the bottled. It was better. But either way, this is a 5 star recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as called for and it was delicious!!! The crust was scrumptious! The filling moist but still held together nicely with great texture and had a delicious tangy flavor! I did use fresh squeezed lemon juice rather than out of a bottle but I bet it would be good either way. Mine did get overcooked a bit, but that wasn't a flaw in the recipe - simply an error in my timing and judgment. Even with the slightly overdone crust it was still so yummy!! A great simple, delicious recipe! I will be making this again :)

These came out a little too sweet for my taste, although still delicious. I would suggest using less sugar for the filling and removing it entirely from the crust. If you consider the crust is basically your classic shortbread, there's really no point in adding all that confectioners sugar anyway.

These are REALLY delicious. REALLY REALLY delicious. REALLY REALLY REALLY delicious. REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY delicious - I could go on and on! I did add a half teaspoon of vanilla to my eggs... and I did bake my crust a bit shorter than it called for ... and I did not have enough lemon juice, therefore decreasing the sugar... BUT even with those set-backs, these were REALLY great. These were REALLY REALLY great. These were REALLY REALLY REALLY great. These were REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY great. (oh there I go again). IN SHORT: These were delicious and great.  :D

I've made these twice now.  The first batch I accidentally used two cups of both flour and powdered sugar...made the crust a bit chewy, but still good!  Second time around, I got the crust right and added just a touch of yellow food color to top layer....AMAZING!

My daughter and I made these yesterday and they were a hit. I used a pan for brownies/squares. There was was enough filling even though it may not have been as firm as the original recipe intended. The only change I made was lemon zest in the crust. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe as is, however I made a few additions. As I was only testing outthis recipe, I cut the recipe in half. For the crust, I added 1/3 cup of unsweeted shaved coconut. I did not use melted butter, and instead used softened butter. In the lemon mixture I added half of a brick of cream cheese to the mixture and then blended. This gave the squares a delicious creamy taste and the coconut just gave it a punch of exotic flavour. Everyone is gobbling these tasty bars up (including me)! Will definately make again YUMMMM!

These were very nice squares.  I made them for my Christmas tray and all the company enjoyed them.  I love the tart lemon flavor and it was a good contrast to all the other sugary treats that were on the table.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the reviewer's suggestions and did not melt the butter. I felt the crust was too thick for the amount of filling so I will reduce the crust next time. Flavor was amazing.

Delicious!! I made this exactly as stated -- just halved it.  I might have let the crust go a little longer accidentally. Very, very yummy. This is now my go-to lemon bar recipe. I'm going to try it again with margarine, because butter is getting really expensive around here and if I can save a little money, I'll make these way more often. Thank you!

I made this recipe as instructed (I goofed and added too much lemon juice though)and really liked it.  The hubby is not find of lemons though (but he loved the crust), has anyone tried this recipe with peach juice instead of lemons?

I've made these twice and both times they were wonderful. The first batch accidentally got left in the oven for too long, but nothing that a lo of powdered sugar can't fix. The second batch got cooked exactly as the recipe states, and I think that the next time I'm going to cook longer than the recipe calls for, but not as long as I did the first time.

Have tried so many lemon bar recipes but THIS IS IT!!!  The other recipes call for very little lemon juice - you can't taste the lemon in Ina Garten's recipe! I gave a dozen to a neighbor and he said he sat down and ate all but two; asked for more :)   Thanks to another poster suggesting lemon zest...  wonderful idea.  These are amazing!!

These are amazing!  So easy and so delicious.  I used the leftover lemons I used for making limoncello also on this site.  The only thing I changed was to add a little lemon zest to the crust.  Thanks so much.

I really enjoyed making these lemon squares and I just feel like I needed to add a little bit more lemon juice for a more tart flavor. And I feel that it is MUCH better to buy a margarine with no added salt rather than butter because the butter is too greasy and fatty. plus the crust will come out better

My whole family loved these.  The only change I made was I used 3 fresh squeezed lemons (apx. 3/4 cup of juice), and the zest from them.  Absolutely delicious!

I did reduce the sugar a little bit for the lemon custard part, but these were outstanding anyway.  So, so delicious.  Compliments like, "These are better than my mother's," were offered.  Great recipe!

I was skeptical because I've made Lemon Bars before and it was a complete disaster. 
I followed the recipe exactly and I got beautiful results.
Thanks RCOMP :)

Delicious!  A refreshing summer treat.  Made these for a Labor Day party and received many compliments.  The only thing I did differently was that I added lemon zest to the lemon filling.  I will definitely make these again!

I didn't try this recipe the first time I ever tried making lemon bars and I was so sad that they didn't come out good at all (bummer) I used a pre made sugar cookie dough like the recipe suggested and a foil pan  to bake them in, the top developed a crispy crust on top and I couldnt figure out why that happened....im going to try this recipe this time and hope it works :)

I have tried this recipe many different ways--as is, half the crust, double the filling--and I have to say it always comes out fantastic.  My mother-in-law hates lemon bars as a rule and she LOVES these.  I have friends who beg me to make them and I haven emailed the recipe to countless people.  Very addicting!

Tried these twice the lemon filling was excellent but the crust pre-baking then baking just didn't work.  Sorry had to rate the recipe one star because I had to work with it so much to get it right.

Very good base recipe.  But I made a couple changes.  First, way too much sugar, drop it down to at least 1 3/4 C sugar. I  added all of the lemon zest to the filling.  Also, I increased the crust measurements  and cook time by 50% because of my own personal taste.  Finally, I cooked the filing on a double boiler to a pudding consistency to avoid browning in the oven, which I baked for about 20 minutes.

Really good basic recipe.  It was a little sweet w/ only 5/8 c lemon juice.  So I added a little more (about 2 TB).  Also, I wanted something different so I put the filling mix in a blender, added 5 strawberries, and then poured the mix into the crust.  Really good!

Followed the recipe almost exactly (had to use 2 8x8" pans and rounded up lemon juice to 3/4 c) and turned out delicious.
If I were to make these again, I'd probably follow what many other reviewers recommended and double the filling -- but that's more of a personal preference.

This is by far the best Lemon Bar recipe I have eaten...I only had a 1/4 cup lemon juice, and used that along with a small package of Crystal Lite Lemon Lime single drink package...everyone LOVED this ingredient in here...so if your willing to take a risk with lemon bars...this is by far the best way to go!

Followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed. Crust was soggy with no taste and lemon filling was way to sweet for my liking.

Very good. However, I add at least the juice of two lemons, more when I want them a little on the tart side.

I made this recipe as is, but am not sure if I got a full 5/8 cup of lemon juice or not.  I used a whole container of lemon juice (the ones shaped like lemons), which I assumed was close to 5/8 C.  These bars were awesome.  I brought them to our Easter potluck and everyone loved them!

The crust for this recipe was delicious, and overall the filling tasted very good as well. However, the top browned too quickly.

Very good. I gave some to a neighbor and she liked them! Another reviewer suggested putting parchment paper in the pan for easy clean up--I am so glad that I followed their suggestion! Worked very well! A great combo of sweet/tangy...but there was a bit of a weird metallic taste to some of them...not sure why. A great recipe, though. Thanks!

I didn't care for these.  They were nothing like traditional lemon squares.  Both the tops and bottoms were HARD and the middle super gooey.  Tasted more like custard then lemon.  Not a fan.

I went with the revised recipe that Paige posted and all I have to say is OMG, THANK YOU. It was quite different from a 9x13 because I baked it in an 8x8 pan. The crust came out perfectly golden brown and layered. I pressed one layer down pounded with my knuckles and pressed another layer on top. Instead of baking the crust for 19 minutes I baked it for 25 minutes since the crust was thicker. Everyone loved the crust. The lemon part was thick and I think was well proportioned with the crust. I added too much lemon rind so as I go at it again today I'm just going to add lemon rind from one lemon instead of two. I highly recommend one to use Paige's version of this lemon square bar recipe.

Awesome lemon flavor - definitely for lemon lovers.  I didn't change anything major just reduced the butter to get a nice crumbly mixture for the crust - 1 cup was too much the first time.  Other than the amount of butter - delicious if you like lemon.  These went fast both times.

Great recipe. The lemon flavor is perfect. I've been looking for a lemon square recipe that has a good lemon flavor for my husband and this will be the last recipe I use for lemon squares! Thank you!

Great bars, but I would agree with some of the other reviews that you will want to double the filling! Also, the only change I made was to replace the sugars with Splenda..and made a GREAT sugar-free variant!!!!

When I first decided to make this, I thought I was making traditional lemon bars, but these are not what I grew up with at all. The crust was much, much too oily & thick. The lemon part of it had a nice lemon flavor to it, but I thought that it was odd that it had a fluffy texture to it . . . I won't be making these again.

Very tart.  I made it exactly as written.  Maybe it's supposed to be this sour, but I didn't like it.  I would try to add more sugar next time.  But otherwise - great crust, and it held its shape nicely.  Will try again sometime.

These turned out really well. I made mine key lime bars by using key lime juice I followed the changes made by Paige, except i didnt add the zest. They turned out delicious and it was refreshing to have something with key lime taste that wasnt a cheesecake type base!

I'm not sure what I did, but my crust was hard as a rock and I actually had trouble cutting it.  Still giving 3 starts because it was probably my fault-- because I wanted to have a lot of lemon filling, so I baked it in a 7x11.  I should have baked it in a 9x13 and doubled the lemon ingredients instead.   Live and learn

I almost gave this 5 stars but I'm stingy with my 5's. Also, I wish I would have followed the recipe exactly... I took the advice of several posters who 1) added a full cup of lemon juice -way too much for my tastebuds- and 2) advised to bake the crust at 315 instead of 350 -I ended up cranking it up to 350 when the crust wasn't bake through after 20mins.  I think the recipe would have been excellent as is.

I made three batches this evening for a bake sale tomorrow.  On one, I cut the butter by 2tbspns as suggested by another user.  I found the dough to be a bit dry, although the flavor was fine.  The next I used the recommended amount of butter and found it too oily!  So next time I'll try reducing it by 2tbs and add until it reaches the desired consistency.//One two of the pans I lined with wax paper, as suggested.  I must say I preferred the pan NOT lined with paper.  The bars came out easily and I didn't have to trim the edges (like I did with the paper)... although, I get to keep the edges for myself, so maybe it wasn't so bad! //Oh! And I added extra lemon juice 2tbs b/c I like them on the tangy side. //Over all a good simple recipe.

These are delicious!  I made a slight change by adding some lemon zest, but other than that followed the recipe as written.  They have a great shortbread crust and a wondeful tang to the filling.  Next time I make them, I would like to try doubling the lemon filling.

This is an excellent recipe.  I followed the directions exactly and they came out great.  Added my own personal touch with decorating the tops after they had been cut.  Don't wait too long on cutting the bars, as soon as they are cool cut them, I waited until the next day and they were a little tough on the knife.

I made this recipe today and the lemon part was great, but next time I would make a slight alternation to the crust. I am going to use graham cracker for it. I think it would taste much better, personally. I did bake my bars at 315, reason being is that my oven is electric and it gets really hot and cooks the outside of my food faster than the inside and I end up with a burnt dish but the given 350 degrees should work for gas ovens

These were excellent as written! I added lemon zest to the base because I was using fresh lemons, but it would have been fine without too. Lovely spring desert.

Good and lemony bars, but just way too sweet. I would reduce the sugar next time to about 1 1/2 cups instead of 2.  Also, make sure you either grease your pan REALLY well, or use parchment paper.  I cut the bars while they were still a bit warm and I still found it difficut to get them out of the pan.  Also,increase your baking time, because 1/2 hour is not enough, bars are still runny. I'd try this recipe again with the changes, it's almost a 5 star recipe.

Yummy.  I made a little less crust (18 servings) cooked at 315 and kept the rest the same.  Next time I may cook the filling for 33-35 minutes instead of just 30.  Cooled in the fridge and sprinked with powdered sugar.

These were pretty good, I didn't know what "beat the eggs until light" meant so I just beat the heck out of them until they were smooth. The crust was a bit hard. I had to cook it a few minutes longer to get it brown. I used half margerine and half butter becasue I only had one stick of butter. i liked it and the kids liked it too.  But it doesnt make 24, it only makes 4 big bars.  :)

I accidentally added 1/2 cup flour instead of 1/4 cup to the lemon mixture so that may be why I had some problems.  The bars did not taste sweet enough and did not have much lemon flavor even though I did add 1 extra teaspoon lemon zest to the original recipe.  I also had to bake 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated because it was very runny at 30 minutes.

This is an incredible recipe that I've been making for more than 20 years. It is even better with fresh grated lemon peel in the custard mix before baking. Everyone always asks for the recipe. A keeper!

These weren't that bad. They weren't mouth waterhing either. One thing the recipe didn't say was to put them in the fridge after they cooled which I later learned is something I should have done. Also, there wasn't enough lemon flavor. Next time I will use at LEAST a cup of lemon juice if not a cup in a half. Who the heck heard of 5/8 of a cup?

I love lemon squares but I have never tried making them before this...  I think you have to be quite careful not to over-beat the eggs, which I did.  While it is quite lemon-y, I used bottled lemon juice which made a negative difference - my bars aren't bad, but they're not as good as some of the reviews suggested they could have been.                                                                   My crust was perfect, however, if a bit thick for the size of pan used.  I used cold butter and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I forgot to grease the pan, so I baked it for 10 minutes, and then let it sit.  I had intended to cut down on the sugar in the filling as well, but because I overdid the eggs, I had to thicken it up, so I used the full two cups.                                                                   A lot of the reviews recommend upping the lemon, adding zest, and cutting down on the sugar which may be a good idea, depending on your tastes.  It browned quite a bit on top (addeding a crunchy/chewy layer) despite not being set after 30 minutes - it actually took about 40 - 45 minutes in the oven.  Overall, not a bad effort, given it was my first try, but to do this again, I would make modifications.

followed the recipe exactly, except for adding more lemon juice and zest, and the bars came out great! i was also able to halve the recipe to fit a 7x11 baking pan. i'll line the pan next time, as i did have some difficulty removing the bars.

Not bad.  Not as good as I had hoped. I might make again but I think I will keep looking for a better recipe.  Maybe something with a topping like coconut.

The best lemon bars ever!  I like my lemon bars a little more lemony so I cut back on the sugar a little and added more lemon.  I did taste the mixture before putting them into the pan (didn't want to waste a whole batch!) and it was perfect. Yum!

I am definately not a baker but this i whipped up easily and had raving reviews. Someone said it was better than their mom's recipe! No need to make changes to the ingredients. The only different thing i did was use cold butter for the crust, dicing it with a pastry cutter. turned out perfect!

Was ok... not the best I have had. Followed exactly and found it to be very bland. I agree with whomever stated it needed some lemon zest or more lemon flavor. Was more like egg and unflavored gelatin on a flavorless crust.

I found the crust to be far too thick and was composed of too much butter and flour. Also I would add less lemon juice if I was to make this again because it was quite strong. So overall it tasted like lemon juice mixed with butter and flour. Not satisfied at all.

These were good. I added more lemon juice but followed the recipe other wise. I will make these again for something different and for those that are lemon lovers.

The taste was good but the texture was off. The crust was chewy. This was hard to get out of the pan. I think the parchment paper idea is good. I will not make this one again.

I have to say these are the absolute best lemon bars I've ever had!!!  I LOVED them.  The only thing I did differently was cut the butter in cold for the crust (as suggested by another reviewer) and it turned out great.  Not sure what the difference is so I'm going to try it with the melted butter as well.  As I said, these were extremely delicious, but I do love lemon so next time I will add a bit more lemon juice!

The filling on this was great! I thought something was missing, so I added the juice from 1/2 of a lime and it worked perfect. I only needed a small dessert, so I halved the filling and poured it all into a graham cracker pie crust. I saw reviews that called for cooking less time, but after cooking 20 mins, my pie was underdone. Next time I'll cook at least 25 minutes. I let this rest until the next day in the fridge and it was yummy. Oh yes, after halving the recipe, I only used about 2/3 cup sugar and added a few drops of yellow food coloring just to make it look pretty. Thanks for the recipe - it's just about foolproof.

This is a very good recipe. I liked the consistency of the filling. I made as is and I found that I would add more lemon. Also I had to bake an additional 5 minutes.

This is a great recipe. I like my lemon squares VERY lemony though, so I added some lemon zest to the crust, and only added a cup and a half of sugar to the lemon custard part. It came out great.

I was looking for a good lemon bar recipe and this is it!  I gave it four stars because I didn't follow it exactly, I used Paige's modifications and made a few of my own: I used Splenda in place of the sugar called for in the filling.  I didn't have any baking powder, so I skipped that!  I didn't melt the butter, just combined it with the flour, powdered sugar and salt with my hands and patted into a parchment lined 9x13 pyrex.  The bottom layer took a little longer than 15-18 min @ 315, so I think next time I'll bake it at 350 and just keep a close eye on it.  I used three large lemons and the zest from them in the filling.  The key to cutting them nicely is to let them cool completely!  I did slice off the edges to give a nicer, more uniform appearance (and myself lots to sample without eating half the bars--- which would have been easy to do!)  This is a great, easy recipe to start with, highly recommended!

AMAZING recipe. It was outstanding.  It took exactly 5 lemons for the req'd amt of juice.  Only minor changes made: I added the zest from 2 of the lemons to the crust and the other 3 lemons to the filling and I also followed one reviewer's recommendations by baking 10min, covering with foil 15min, uncover for 5min.  Will definitely make again!

This was the perfect lemon bar!  The only change I made was to the oven temperature - my oven tends to run hot so I lowered the temp to 325 and baked a little longer (crust until golden, and with filling until set and top was just starting to brown lightly).

We really liked this recipe, but for us the baking times were a little off. The crust wasn't anywhere near done after only 15 minutes; it was still white and raw. I cooked it about 7 more minutes to get it golden. The filling started getting very dark colored after 25 minutes, so I covered with foil for the last 5 minutes of cooking. They came out great, and my husband loved them. The crust has a very good flavor, but was hard to get out of the pan. May have been my fault for not greasing well enough. I topped the bars with powdered sugar, and they were a hit. I also added a little grated lemon zest to the filling for added flavor. I'd definitely make this one again.

Easy and really good. Out of a tray of goodies I made for work, these were gone the fastest. I made the original recipe, no changes. The bars are on the thin side, but they have a very rich flavor.

Oh man, where to begin.  First, I made this in an 8x12 pan and used parchment paper as others had suggested.  I baked the crust for 20 minutes and it was still raw.  I thought maybe that was how it was supposed to be so I poured the lemon mixture over and it all just mixed together making a gooey mess.  I bake for 25 more minutes, they did set but the crust was wayyyyy too much for the amount of the lemon filling.  Next time I will 1/2 the crust ingredients and then make the full filling adding some lemon extract for that great tang.

I suggest following the recipe. I don't understand why others automatically change a recipe before trying it and then gives it five stars, ugh! I like a little more filling over the crust, other than that this was a pretty good recipe!! I also had to cook it a little longer...could be due to using a celcius oven rather than farenheit.

I tried this recipe by not melting the butter, just adding it cold as suggested. The bars would've been perfect if they were a bit more lemon-flavored. I would increase the lemon rather than use lemon zest next time around. All in all, they were tasty, although not what I expected.

Love the cookie crust! I added about 1/4 lemon zest to the lemon mixture, but it would have been just as great without it. I'm just a lemon junkie :)

I made this for my mom since she loves anything with lemon. I gave this a 4 since it did not settle the way I had hoped. When it came out of the oven it appeared to be settled. I was very paranoid because everyone said becareful not to over cook. Regardless my mother loved the flavor. Followed others' recommendations.

Made these using AmyPaige's suggestions--These were GREAT! Not too sweet, not too sour, very fresh-tasting and summery.

this is a delicious recipe...i added lemon zest to the crust and the filling, i also 1 1/2ed the filling but didnt use quite all of it...they were the perfect balance of sweet and tart...i used the juice from two lemons and the balance of juice from a bottle....i didnt notice any notes about storing so i kept mine in the fridge before serving, very nice, i will definitely make again

Yum, these are amazing, its taking all my will power from eating another one! I followed the recipe as stated basically. I used my Kitchenaid mixer with the paddle attachment for the mixing for the crust and lemon mixture. I added in a pinch of salt and 3/4 cup of butter for the crust and cooked it for 17-18 mins at  350. When I added the lemon mixture, it only required 20 mins at 350 in my oven. The key to these is cooling them completely before cutting, they should come out perfect. I garnished with icing sugar and lemon zest.

These tasted delicious and were incredibly simple to prepare.  The only minor change I'd make next time is, increase the flour in the crust by about 1/2 cup because the crust was a bit too oily for me.

OMG, these were fabulous!!  I confess I messed with the recipe a little because we wanted bars with two crusts.  To do that, I pressed 1/2 of the crust mixture into a 9" square pan, and then sprinkled the rest of the crust on top of the lemon mixture.  I found that the baking times in the recipe (15 min for the bottom crust and then 30 min for the whole thing) worked just fine.  The crusts were more like short-bread than anything else, but ohhh, these bars were GOOD!!  They were a birthday present for someone who just adores lemon bars and he loved them.  These are definitely in my recipe box.  Thanks RCOMP!!

Lemon bars came out great. My only problem was that the sides and top became kind of crunchy...but my mom loved the crunchy part anyways.  I added lemon zest and about a teaspoon of pure lemon extract to the bottom crust. Came out great!

These are absolutely delicious. I have made them twice in the last couple of weeks. I still need work on the crust, it is coming out to crunchy. I wonder if not siffting the flour has anything do do with it, hum! I will continue to try because they are so good.

These were delicious!  I even messed up and only used half of the butter in the crust, and these still turned out great.  I prefer mine a little more tart, so I will likely add a bit more lemon juice next time.  But they are fantastic as is.

This was DELICIOUS! This was my first time making lemon bars by myself and I was worried that they weren't going to turn out. But they turned out wonderful! My family and boyfriend loved them so much and so did I! Half of the pan was gone within a half an hour! I will definitely be making these again. And I did use some of the suggestions of the other reviewers in my recipe so thank you other reviewers!

Very good.  The top makes an almost meringue-ish crust, so I don't think you'd need to top it with anything else.
I lined my pan with foil, then let cool completely, and found them quite easy to cut when I pulled them out of the pan.

I have now made this a total of three times. It comes out so delicious and just how I like it...not to tart but not too sweet. HIghly recommended but I do suggest using lemon zest and juice to your tartness desire...

Yummy and easy! Have made it several times since returning to Florida to find our lemon tree was quite prolific this season! nade just as directed - if it bakes just a little longer it sets up a bit better.

I'm not sure what went wrong, but this just didn't work for me.  The crust was way too hard and the filling was too soft and gooey.

These were really good, although I did follow some suggestions of other reviewers.  First, I halved the recipe and used a 8x8 pan.  I didn't reduce the butter for the crust, but I should have; it was a little greasy.  I tried baking the crust at 325 rather than 350, but it took 20 minutes and wasn't browning, and I didn't want my lemon mixture to need to wait too long to go in.  Next time I'll probably use the recommended temp, or only go 10* lower.  I remember making these a while ago using BOTH extra lemon juice AND grated zest.  That was too much by waaaaay far.  This time I just grated a little zest (probably 1/8 teaspoon for my halved batch) and it was perfect; just the right amount of tartness to balance the sweet.  In the 8x8, I baked at 350 for about 25 minutes total; after 15 minutes of bake time, I needed to cover the pan with foil so that the top wouldn't brown.  They were delicious; just what I was hoping for in a lemon bar!

i made this recipe as is one night when i had fresh lemons from a family member's tree. they were quite tasty, though i was scared to try them because they had a solid-egg look to them. they turned out nicely but could use a bit more lemon juice.

This was really good. I made it with limes instead of lemons, and it had a stronger taste to it, just the way I like it. My relatives loved it, and I did too!

These were good.  The custard tasted great(I used half a cup and two tablespoons of lemon juice) I just didn't like the crust.    The butter kind of saturated the crust.  It wasn't flaky at all.  Guess I'll cut down on the butter next time.

Excellent recipe! These were my favourite Christmas treat this year. I did reduce the butter and that worked well. My dad thought they could use a little lemon zest but I thought they were perfect. Very easy to make.

Very good! I lost my Lemon Bar recipe when my kids started raiding my recipes.  This sounded similar so I tried it.  The consistency was good and the flavor was too. The only problem I had (if you consider it a problem) was they wanted to kinda fall apart when I went to take them out of the pan.  All I did was eat the first row, and put the pan in the refrigerator for a short time and they came out fine.  I'd definitely make them again & not just for my Christmas tray. Would be great at Easter time too.

These are delicious. I lined my pan with parchment paper and used the juice and zest from two lemons to make the filling. I read the reviews about the crust but left as per the original recipe. With the parchment paper these made a very delicious square.

These were very tasty - even better a day or two later!!  For some reason, I didn't read the reviews before making this - next time, I will cut down on the butter in the crust.

Sorry, but too many modifications have to be made to make this a good recipe.

The worst part is the crust, because even if it turns out right, it's jsut too much.  I thought the bars were about to burn, but even after several hours in the refrigerator, they weren't set.  Yes, oven times and temperatures vary, but the ingredient proportions are not good.

Wonderful Recipe - I made these for a cookout & they beat out all the brownies, cookies, cakes! I followed another reviewer's suggestion & lined my dish with parchment paper. This made it super easy & quick to lift out of the dish, cut, and put on a serving tray.

These were kind of dissapointing.  I was expecting more of a lemon layer, but the "custard" part was very thin.  I didn't have any problems with the crust (I added lemon zest to it and pre-baked it for 15 minutes at 325 F) and I thought the lemon flavor was okay, but I wanted a thicker layer of lemon custard.

The crust was greasy and soggy, even after baking for an additional 5 min. The filling was way too sweet. I am going to keep looking for a lemon bar recipe.

Really good. I reduced the butter to 12 TBS instead of 16.

Wow - these are FABULOUS! I'll never buy them again now that I can make them myself with this great recipe. The lemon is a perfect consistency and nice and tart and the crust is rich and delicious. I baked the crust a little too long (a habit of mine) so some of the bars were a little hard to get out of the pan. But didn't affect the taste! Yummy - thanks!!

i made this yesterday, it was too tangy for my taste but otherwise good, i loved the crust, i had to bake it a bit longer than the said time of baking.  i used wax paper before putting the crust so i didn't have any problems regarding sticking. next time I'd lessen the lemon to my taste, good recipe though.

Only the upscales restaurants offer these wonderful bars where I'm from. I love them so much that I decided to look for a recipe and I am glad I found this one. Most naturally I will it 5 stars because of how wonderful they tates.  I think these are better than the one tasted in that upscale restaurant. Note I only used a cup of lemon juice because that's all I had on hand and  I didn't want to go to the store. DELISH ! as Rachel Ray would say.

My guests loved them!   I cooked the crust a little longer to get it slightly brown -- and used real lemons, and had 1/8th of a tsp extra lemon juice, which I added.  Delish and a keeper!!  Thank You.

Good bars, but VERY sweet - I would decrease the sugar (and don't put powdered sugar on top to hide the browning - this just sends it over the edge)

These did not come out very well. I was very dissapointed. I used a suggestion from a review & used frozen Minite Maid lemon juice & I think that is where I went wrong. It wasn't done after 30 mins & it never really set. I think if I try this again I will use the juice from fresh lemons. I reduced the butter in the crust by 2 T as per reviews. Thanks anyways.

This recipe is a family favorite, year round!  It's easy to remember and tastes great and fresh. Literally everyone who has tried them has asked for the recipe.  The only thing I sometimes add is the zest of the lemons I squeeze.  Thanks Ralph!

Great - I would have given 5 stars, but I added some extra zest to the crust and a little extra juice to the topping.  Delishious!

We made a batch of triple chocolate chunk brownies and these lemons bars...  My 2 children (ages 4 & 6) prefered the lemon bars over the brownies.  Now tells you something! It is a great cooking project for kids.  They can squeeze the lemons, do all of the mixing and press the crust into the baking dish.  Great recipe, thanks!

I'm a huge fan of anything lemon-flavored and this square bar recipe is great. I'm glad I made it! The crust is nice and buttery and the lemon part is tangy and delicious. Very good.

This is actually the 2nd time that I have made these but I refused to rate the first time due to me not following instructions.  I had made in an 8x8 pan and that did not work out well at all.   This time I followed instructions to a "T" and the outcome was wonderful.  Thanks for a good dessert.

These were delicious. They taste like a Lemon Meringue pie without the meringue. Which is a good thing because I don't care for meringue. I followed someones advice and added a little zest in the crust and reduced the butter by 2 tbsp, I also used 6/8 cups of freshly squeezed lemon juice but next time I'll stick with the 5/8 cups because it was a little to much lemon. Thanks for the recipe Ralph.

This was not as good as i thought it would have been.  I made the recipe exactly as stated.  The crust had way to much butter, and there was barely a lemon taste.  I used fresh lemons.  I will not make again.

Excellent. Used 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar and 1/2 white sugar to make the crust and 3/4 cup lemon juice. Perfect.

Perfect, refreshing summer treat!  I took out about 1-2T of butter and had to cook 5-10 extra minutes for the lemon mixture to set.  The crust was just like flakey shortbread!  Will definitely pass on this recipe!

I loved this! I altered a few things according to the other reviews. I used 3/4c butter and in the filling I used 3/4c lemon juice and 1 1/2 c sugar and it was plenty sweet. I also cooked the filling at 325 so it didn't brown on top.

Definetly look through all the reviews, I used many suggestions from other reviews. I would have to say that they were a bit messy and sticky. But overall, they were delicious and a big hit at the Girl's Night Out.

These were excellent!  I used 3 eggs and 2 lemons and stuck to the recipe.  Is a top/crust supposed to form?  Because it did on mine. So good... I've already had 4!

Great lemon flavor but I had a hard time getting them out of the pan neatly.  Dusting them with powdered sugar after you cut them is a great idea.

It has a great subtle lemon flavor to it, like lemonade. But I would recommend cooking the crust for longer. It also seems to be more crust than lemon, but sprinkled with powedered sugar, it was a great treat.

This is soooo good! I made them for my mom for mother's day, and ended up eating several myself! I can't wait to see what she says...she loves anything lemon. Great lemon flavor. Hard to cut, though. Make sure pan is greased well.

Overall very good. I'll definitely make these again, but maybe with less butter in the crust (as it's way too buttery for me). The lemon filling however is top notch.

I found these much too sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the lemon melted into the shortbread, which made a nice lemon cake but not what I was hoping for.  I'm not sure what happened.  In any case, others loved it.  I probably will look elsewhere for lemon bars next time, though.

Perfect! I had trouble with the edges sticking, but was afraid to use foil because the crust would get too done.  I think next time I will make the crust go up the edges a little bit to fix the problem. A keeper!

I really liked this recipe.  This was the first time I had ever made Lemon Bars, so I followed the recipe to the letter, and I liked it a lot.  The crust was nice and the bars were, I thought, excellent.  I think I will take these home to my next family gathering and get my Grandmother's take on them.

i didn't actually try these, but the fact that they were the first item to sell out in my bake sale, despite the funny, crater-y, crinky top they had, ought to tell you something! i baked these for a lot longer, so maybe the funny top was because of that. also, i found the cookie crust to be rather greasy, but again that may have been my fault; i left them in the pan overnight. regardless, i will make again.

These tasted great but are difficult to cut. I found the crust very difficult to cut through and that the top got all messed up when cutting. Confectioner's sugar sprinkled on the top helped to fix the looks of the bars. I would recommend following the suggestions about lining the pan with something so you could lift the bars out of the pan and cut them more easily.

Good,but I made modifications to the crust.  I used 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup butter/shortening, 1 cup milk, and 1 cup sugar.  The crust fused to the pan and proved to be very difficult to remove.  I read a review somewhere else that recommended buttering the pan and placing parchment paper down on that, and when the bars are finished, simply lift out the bars using the parchment paper.  I think I will try that for better results.  Other than that, very good recipe.  Oh, I also added more flour to the lemon mixture to give it a little more body, approximtely 1/3 cup instead of 1/4.

I was in a real hurry so I made 3/4 of the lemon topping portion of this recipe and added the zest of one lemon.  I put it in a store bought 9” deep-dish flour piecrust that I pre-baked.  Topped with Cool-Whip, this made a nice sour lemon dessert.  We LOVE lemon, and this was our fix!!!  However, I think next time I will make the recipe’s bottom crust, as I think the crust’s sweetness would compliment the heavy lemon flavor better.

I made this exactly as the recipe indicated. They were very good, but too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will cut way back on the sugar in the filling.  The crust was wonderful.

15 minutes was too short of baking time for the crust; and 30 minutes was too long for the filling. That's okay, though, because a powdered sugar dusting covers up any brown spots. I love how easy this recipe is, and how it doesn't require you to cool the crust before adding the filling. And it's also really yummy-- my parents love these.

These are some delicious lemon bars. I really liked the crust: easy to make, and a great base for the lemon topping. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, you could reduce the butter down to 3/4 cup and have no problems. I personally upped the lemon juice to just under a whole cup, and love the super-lemon flavor, but if I were to make this for others I think I'd stick with 3/4 cup. I'll never look for another lemon bar recipe again - thanks!

These turned out nice and I got a lot of compliments.  I did pour the lemon juice gernerously and added some lemon zest.  Also dusted the tops of them with powdered sugar before serving.

Fantastic. I loved these bars, and the few priveleged friends and co-workers that I shared them with demanded either the recipe or that I make them all the time. I will stop looking for good bar recipes now. I have found what I need.

These bars were terrific in taste and texture. After a couple of days however, they became a little soggy. That is the only reason why I gave this recipe a 4-star rating. I made them over the holidays and everyone just loved them. Will probably make again. Crust tasted fantastic!
