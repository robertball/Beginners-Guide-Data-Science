I REALLY recommend going to Youtube and researching how spaetzle is done (if nothing else than to see what it's supposed to look like) before doing this recipe, if you're not familiar with it. I followed the instructions as I understood them here, and ended up with something that looked like boiled mini-baguettes.... After looking into it, leaving the dough relatively thin and wet, and working it through a colander or maybe a cheese grater, might be the way to go. I kept adding flour trying to get it to form a ball per the directions, which was a big mistake. The soup's flavor is good, and I'm going to try to rescue what's left somehow....

My grandmother taught me this too!  My kids love the homemade noodles. If you roll out the dough and flour each side lightly, then roll it up and slice into noodle ribbons, that works. I have the kids unroll them and throw on a cookie sheet to "dry" a little so it doesn't soak up all the broth.  Then I can add the noodles when I am ready.

I made this recipe with "Grandma's Noodles II" (from this site), and it was AWESOME!  I didn't use a whole chicken - I used boneless, skinless breasts.  I cut them frozen and cooked them right in the broth with the onions and celery.  The chicken came out so moist.  My husband is a tried and true "meat and potatoes" guy, so I was a bit doubtful that he'd enjoy this meal of chicken noodle soup with warm applesauce on the side.  HE LOVED IT!  Three bowls later, he was to full for dessert :-)  This will be one of our cold weather staples!

The best chicken spaetzle ever! Soooo delicious. My father likes the dumplings very hearty, so I added about the dough in 1/2 and added 1/4 to 1/3 a cup of extra flour. Very hearty, but more like dumplings than spaetzle. The dumplings that followed this recipe were yummy. Be sure to roll the dumplings into somewhat small balls. Grease your ice cream scoop, and the balls should be 1/2 the size. I made the mistake of using the whole ice cream scoop and they soon turned out like baseballs. This is also a somewhat time consuming soup, but the soup is still worth the effort.

After years (I'm serious) this is the very first recipe for spaetzle that exactly matches my mother's (and her's) way of making it! I'm psyched. This recipe is almost identical to the thickened chicken stew I make today, having watched at my mom's apron strings. Our family is PA Dutch and I wonder if this unique preparation of spaetzle is regional... sometimes I will do the noodles on their own in boiling water, straing them, then fry until golden in butter. Yum. Thank you. GREAT recipe!!

Coming from Dutch heritage, My mom makes my grandmothers recipe for spaetzle and chicken soup regularly.  Now that I'm on my own, this soup is one of the many things I miss.  This recipe isn't an exact match for my mom/grandmothers, but is as close as it can get.  LOVE IT!  I had a hard time with the spaetzles but maybe I just need practice. :)

This soup is great.  It has a wonderful flavor.  I would recommend cutting off any excess fat from the chicken before cooking.  I used three cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt.  I tried cutting the spaetzle as directed but found it very difficult.  If you have a spaetzle press I strongly recommend using it...much easier.  This one is a keeper!

I have just added some youtube footage (2 parts...from my iphone) on how to make Spaetzle and how to add it to the soup. Hope you enjoy, and find it as simple and delicious as I do! Cheers! Carly http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryM-rxzSE30  and  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqanzQErvCU

When I make chicken soup I prefer to use the carcass from a roasted chicken. I think it adds more flavor. I grew up eating spaetzle but never had it in soup. It was delicious Carly and thanks!

This was delicious!  I only gave it 4 stars because I made a few minor changes.  I used 4 thighs and 2 split breast pieces, sliced carrots instead of baby carrots (that was what I had on hand) and added more broth after the spaetzle had soaked up most of the broth.  I also diced the onion and sauteed it along with the celery and some diced carrot before adding the chicken and the broth.  A very tasty soup!

My grandmother made what we called Fat Noodle soup.  The spaetzle dough we used was a bit thinner, and we just dropped it in the soup with a teaspoon.  Same concept though.

Great recipe!  I had never heard of "Spaetzle" before and watched the video another reviewer posted on youtube so I figured out how to make the noodles.  My kids all loved the soup!  Thanks for sharing.

nice and warming, i used the drop in method for the spaetzle like some of the other reviewers and it turned out nice. tho, im not sure if its my taste or if it was the carrots i used, but they got a bit overpowering. I'll try it with fresher carrots next time.

Fantastic. I took the advice of another reviewer and looked up how to make spaetzle. I went one step further (like they did on You Tube) and sauteed the spaetzle in a little butter and one slice of bacon. My entire family loved it!

I didn't change much because the original recipe looked great. Two small changes - I roasted the chicken first, 350 for about 45 minutes, then the chicken and fat went into the water. I still found it necessary to add a tablespoon of chicken base and a touch more salt to bring the flavor fully out.

Second was the spaetzle recipe - I used 3 cups flour, 4 eggs, 1 1/4 cup of whole milk, 1 1/2 teaspoon fresh grated nutmeg, and then piped it out into boiling slated water through the cut tip of a 1 gal. freezer storage bag. I ended up with a noodle about 2-3 inches long and between a 1/4 and 1/2 inch wide.

A definite "make again" recipe, thank you!

So, my boyfriend loved this recipe! Said the spaetzle was very close to the real thing (he lived in Germany for a few years). I however wasn't all that impressed with the spaetzle recipe. It wasn't bad mind you, just not like I've had before. The soup however was outstanding! Very flavorful!

This soup was great! We loved the spaetzle. My husband said it reminded him of his mom's chicken and dumplings which is a good thing. I used 3 chicken thighs and 4 drumsticks and a bag of frozen peas and carrots that was thawed. There are some helpful videos on YouTube on making spaetzle, one that is in German was the most helpful because it showed the person using hot water from the pot to smooth out the spaetzle dough on the cutting board while cutting off thin noodles. This method worked very well for us. I used the amount of flour called for in the original recipe. Thanks for the great treat!

Excellent!  My family stuffed themselves.  I added string beans to get in some extra veggies for my family, but aside from that the only changes I made were additional spices.  I used 3 bone-in chicken breasts and my spaetzle required 4 cups of flour.  They were sticky as I dropped them in the soup, but they came out excellent!  My first spaetzle attempt and my family was impressed.

We call this Hunky Soup.  The spaetzle batter we make is slightly thinner and won't make a ball but the concept and ingredients are the same.  Wonderful addition to soup instead of noodles.  Makes for a heartier meal!  We also leave the celery in the soup for more vitamins(?).

I've made spaetzle before. Just once, with a mix, but that was enough that I understand how the process works, & how it should look. The spaetzle part of the recipe DOES NOT MATCH the method given for cooking it. The spaetzle part, as written, is just about right for the "push through a colander into boiling water" method of making spaetzle. It is NOT right for making homemade noodles (as instructions say)--too wet. I added another cup and a half of flour and spooned mine in. They ARE delicious--but this recipe is not for the novice cook. -1 star for the ratio of liquid:flour not being near right for the spaetzle, but otherwise, delicious & thanks :) P.S. I'd make again, but I'll play around with the liquid:flour ratio and use a colander to drip-through, as that's easier anyway.

Ohhhhhhh.......yum. I made this today to help fight a cold, and it is EXACTLY what my Gramma made growing up! We called it Chicken Rebel soup, and instead of cutting the spaetzle dough, we just dropped it in. Other than that...this is the best stuff ever. Who needs Zicam when you've got this!?

Shortcut on noodles and chicken - For a shortcut on the chicken and a boost of flavor...pick up an already cooked rotisserie chicken at the store, boil in place of raw chicken about 20 minutes.  Proceed with recipe.  Shortcut on noodles - mix dough in bowl without water, and drop by the teaspoon-full into boiling broth.  After dropping each "dumpling" in make sure you dip spoon into broth to dampen it before scooping another "dumpling" out of the mixing bowl.  Was stunned to find this recipe.  We've been making this many years, originally learned from our grandma, and we could eat it daily as well!

I have been making spaetzles for a while now. I got the recipe from my husbands sister (which was thier mothers) So I actually made the spaetzles the night before. But other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was GREAT!  Next time I may add some chopped celery too!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was very good. I am in the process of cleaning out the pantry and found a package of spaetzle that need to be used. I had actually roasted a chicken earlier in the week and had made chicken stock from the carcass so I used that and the leftover chicken for this. My 2 year old, who is not a big fan of soup, gobbled this up.

I'm 78 yrs old and have been looking for this recipe for years - I thought it died with my Mother - Thank You!!!  She called it "Chicken and Dumplings" but every time I looked it up the dumplings with like biscuits.  THIS is what my Mothers 'dumplings' were like and I love it.  I'm so happy.

I was so excited to see this recipe as it is rather rare to see German recipes. I am from Germany and brought my "Spaetzle Hobler" (grater) with me from there. However, your recipe is just fine. I never made the chicken soup until I saw your recipe and it did not disapoint. :-)

I actually cheated a lot and made the herbed dumplings from this site instead of the spaetzle. :P The five stars is for the soup itself, which was phenomenal! I used a package of chicken thighs with bones (skin on) and boiled them with the vegetables and seasonings for about an hour. Then I picked all the meat off the bones (and gave some to my dogs, which they loved) and strained the broth. Put the meat and broth back in, and made up the dumplings. Tasted awesome. :)

My hubby loves this soup!  He practically begs me to make it.  It is very easy. I use a vegetable broth and a cube of veg. boullion. I don't think it makes a difference though, that is just what we have around the house. This is another family staple on the cold days around here.

I don't know if it was something I did wrong or what, but I did not care for this. The flavor of the broth was wonderful, but the noodles were not good. It might have been me, I don't know. Sorry!

I used homemade broth, chicken breast remnants equaling about 1 cup, and packaged spaetzle for convenience and it turned out great! The homemade broth makes all the difference.

This has become my “go-to” recipe for chicken soup.  I have a spaetzle maker and I am glad to have a delicious recipe where I can use it.

I grew up calling this "strewhunky". It's one of my absolute favorite comfort foods. My"granny" used to make this for us anytime we were sick, she taught my dad how to make it when he was a teenager. I can still hear him telling me about how because she never used a measuring spoon or cup all she told him was a pinch, hand full of, so he told her, "grandy, your hands are smaller than mine" and he would stop her and put the ingredient in the cups or spoons to be able to replicate the recipe later. After losing my dad unexpectedly I was sure our family recipe was lost forever, but now I can make it and just the smell makes my heart smile.

This soup is okay but salty.  Use garlic powder or fresh garlic to cut down on the salt. Also, use about 1 tsp. fresh chopped parsley instead of dried. For a change of pace try adding a pinch of ginger instead of garlic.  Also, I use 4 cups flour, 3 eggs, 1/2 tsp. salt and about 1/2 - 1 cup of water.  Add more or less water a little at a time until the consistency is medium density and gooey.  Similar to pancake batter but smoother and elastic.

This soup reminds me of good old fashioned chicken soup. I had never made spaetzle before in my life, but it was so easy I did add 1 tsp oil a tip an old German friend gave me and used a spaetzle maker which you put right over the pot and press the dough thru it came out beautiful.  Everyone raved about it and want me to make it again.

Very good recipe.  I kept the onions and celery in the soup, though as I like lots of vegetables and even added mushrooms and some fresh spinach. Mmmm, smelled like my grandma's house.

Used "Grandma's Noodles II" for noodle recipe instead of noodles listed and it turned out GREAT!
