We really enjoyed these, but I have to say that after reding the reviews saying hoe they were pretty bland, I did change it a little. I made my taco meat as I usually do with the the taco seasoning. After simmering a few minutes, I added in the cheese soup and mixed it together until heated through. I thought they turned out very flavorful this way and my family loved them. I will be making this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

My husband loved these! I, on the other hand, wasn't too fond of them. The meat needed a little bit more flavor. Next time I think I'll add some more spices to it or something.

I loved this recipe! I used taco seasoning instead of chili powder and Velveeta instead of the soup but I still loved this recipe

Didn't really care for these at all.  Easy but very bland.  I added more chili powder than called for, but think it needs even more, or just use taco seasoning.  Good concept, but needs some definite tweeking.

We are a family who eats tacos often.This recipe has renewed my love for them..Not only are they delicious, but easy and fast for when you are in a hurry.  I took the previous ratings and added more taco seasoning and it was perfect.  Will never make dull burger for my tacos again. Kids inhaled them!

Quick and tasty, but a tad bland as written, at least for our tastes. I seasoned the meat with cumin, oregano, and garlic to add more flavor. Good for a super-quick meal, which was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks! :)

THis needs something more to it. It is pretty bland. My regular tacos tasted wayyyyy better than these. And all I use is  a McCormick seasoning packet on my meat. My family was very disappointed with this meal, especially my husband. He loves my regualr tacos.

I actually adored this recipe!  I thought it was so simple and so yummy!  The kids liked it for a change, but said they prefer "regular" tacos better (That's kids for ya!)  :)  Will definitely make again!  I made no changes to the recipe!

These were good but had I followed the instructions to a T they would undoubtedly be bland as other reviewers stated. I added some cumin, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. I couldn't find any Nacho Fiesta Soup so I used Chedder Cheese Soup instead. It worked well. I only used half the can and omitted the other half as I thought it would be too much for just my husband and I. I wish I would have had Tabasco sauce because I think it would have made them top notch.

These were great! I used my normal 3 tablespoons of taco seasoning I from this site instead of the chili powder.

This recipe could be great but the Campbell's cheese sauce limits it. Omit the canned sauce melt some real cheddar blend with diced tomatoes and your spiciest spices and you have a winner.

as is: pretty bland but prepare the meat with some taco seasoning then add the cheese, it would be perfect. I'm keeping it because it has a ton of potential.

This was pretty good. I didn't have lettuce or tomatoes on hand, so I topped mine with black olives and jalapeno slices.

I used a packet of taco seasoning per the reviews that said it was bland without it.  This is a very easy recipe to throw together, but it's no better than traditional nachos with shredded cheddar instead of soup.

I made these as beef tostadas instead. This was very bland and needed more like a tablespoon of chili powder not a half teaspoon! I didn't care much for the canned cheese sauce taste. It reminded me of bowling alley nachos. Great idea, but it needs a different cheese sauce and some serious taco seasoning. I might fix these again but only if I were down to a bare pantry.

Awesome recipe!!!!!! My boys loved it. I seasoned the ground beef with Goya adobo and instead of chili powder I used Ortega Taco seasoning mix. One individual package is good for 1 pound of ground beef. Believe me, not bland at all!!!!! just delicious.

These tacos were too cheesy for my personal tastes.
I made as directed, however next I will definitely cut down on the amount of the cheese soup. I found it to be overpowering.

I subbed cheddar cheese soup for the fiesta soup in this because I didnt have it. I added a couple tablespoons of mild salsa and upped the chili powder. I made my own taco shells. I tasted it after I added everything and they were very plain. I added some rooster sauce, no salt seasoning and more chili powder. This was ok its not that special and I might make it again if I had more soup to use up. I would add alot more seasonings maybe even taco seasoning.

My family loves this twist on regular tacos.  It was something different than the usual I make and we have made it again since our first tasting.

I liked it. It was easy to make. It did not have quite enough seasoning for me.  But, I did enjoy it.  Next time I think I will just add more taco seasoning.

I change every recipe I read to taste, as should anyone.  Taste is subjective and this recipe is the perfect example of a base recipe upon which to build.  Quick and easy is the name of the game.  With the addition of chili powder, cumin and black pepper to the meat as it is cooking, it was more to our taste.  I made this with a can of chicken tortilla soup and it was great.  Folded into a tortilla with the addition of some sauteed red pepper and mushroom, we had some great quesadillas with this recipe!

I really enjoyed these tacos. The only change I made, was adding taco seasoning to the meat. Made them very tasty!
