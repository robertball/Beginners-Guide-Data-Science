The recipe was simple to follow and tasted amazing! The bread was the perfect amount of moist, without being soggy. The large chocolate chips were great, which added a good amount of chocolate for each bite.  I brought it into the office and everyone was asking for the recipe. the mini loaves were great to send as gifts. Overall, I'd recommend this recipe.

I love Ghirardelli Chocolate. It's the only chocolate I use in baking for years. I made this recipe into individual tiny loaves. It came out moist and  delicious. I just think that it didn't rise much. I might double the baking powder and or baking soda next time.
