A nice version of lentil soup. It has a sweet aftertaste. I doubled the red pepper to counter the sweetness. The curry paste and the spaghetti sauce are a nice touch which were both homemade and it may have been why there was so much sweetness. Maybe a splash of vinegar at the end would tone it down a bit. At first it seemed the soup would be very thin almost watery but once I added the spaghetti sauce, it thickened up and turned into a hearty lentil soup. I soaked the lentils for two hours and cooked everything in a pressure cooker for 10 minutes. The lentils were a bit more than al dente, whole and not mushy but soft enough not to crunch. Thank you lw for sharing this recipe.

The recipe as is is a great start!  I used yellow curry powder instead of paste and left out the celery.  I also added more salt.

I loved this soup. Near the end of the cooking cycle, I took hall the mixture and pur√©ed it in the blender, then recombined it into  the soup, giving it a lovely texture. Also doubled the red pepper flakes to make it just a little bit hotter. Delicious. I garnished it with the herbs and a bit of sour cream. Perfectly delicious!
