This has a really unique flavor that we found refreshing.  We use chickpeas and cauliflower in a lot of recipes but this was different than anything we'd tried.  Thought the orange flavor came through more than anything else making it a refreshing summer dish. One of the faster to cook recipes we've tried too! Love having another good farro recipe as they are hard to find.  If you love farro try the "vegetarian farro skillet" recipe too.

I roasted the chick peas for an added texture.  This is a great meatless Monday meal.

Recipe was good but I don't see the almonds or orange zest add to the taste. The orange zest actually detracted from the experience.

It's quite spicy but that's from my homemade Garam Masala.

I substituted 1 tablespoon garam masala for Aldi's priano Rosso Pesto Sauce. It was easy to make but I'm not sure the Pesto sauce was the best substitution. I would try it again though, nice combination of vegetables.

My must-have-meat husband requested I make this dish two nights in a row. He doesn't like cauliflower, so I used broccoli the first time. The second time, I used 2 cloves of garlic, 2 cups of  broccoli and added a can of cannelini beans. I served it with orange quarters. (I also used the recipe for easy garam masala from this site.)

This was very good! I used wheat grown in a local field! The flavors were great and the different textures added to the dish. It would be a great side dish for chicken, pork or fish. Definitely a keeper!
