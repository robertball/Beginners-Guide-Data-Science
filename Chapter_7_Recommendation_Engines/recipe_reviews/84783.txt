I'm giving this 4 stars for 2 main reasons.... it says 6 servings.... more like 26! If you make a sandwich or a wrap you don't really use more than an ice cream scoop or about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup.... this makes much, much, MUCH more than that!  Reason #2 is the 2 hr 45 min prep time.... I'm sorry, but this took me ALL AFTERNOON! (Not that I mind cooking all afternoon, but let's be real!) There are 3 major steps to this recipe that each take a fair amount of time.... maybe in a restaurant kitchen things move faster than in my kitchen.....

That being said, the taste is wonderful! Be sure to use mayonnaise and NOT Miracle Whip (no matter how much you like it better) or you will end up with a very sweet dish.  Also, I would advise you to line the roasting pan with foil and give it a light cooking oil spray.. otherwise your veggies WILL stick. Next time I will cook the corn, but not roast it because it gets too hard. Put the roasted poblanos in a double plastic bag to cool.... it will make the skins much easier to get off.

Be brave and give this a try.... it's worth it in the long run.

This was a fabulous and easy meal for my family! I made a few minor changes to tailor it to my familiy tastes: I used anaheim peppers (its what I had on hand) and skipped the celery. When I pureed the mayonnaise and peppers - I added 1/2 of the onion/bellpepper mix to this and blended it in as well - it added a nice extra depth to the dressing flavor. We didn't need salt or pepper. We prefer our chicken salad chunky, so I chopped up the chicken and mixed it, the remaining onion/bellpepper blend and dressing together in a large bowl and refrigerated it! We ate ours as wraps wtih lettuce, tomato an jalapeno slices!

SO good!  I got poblano peppers in my CSA box and had no idea how to use them.  I had no mayo so I made my own and I added a few of the poblano seeds so that it was a bit more spicey.  I also had no fresh red peppers on hand so I used some red peppers I had sliced and froze!  I also never had fresh corn so I used frozen corn.  My kids even liked it!!!  Made WAY too much for what we need or will eat, so we'll be gifting the neighbours with chicken salad, lol.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Very good on a sandwich or on a wrap, with lettuce and tomato.  I halved the recipe and it still served 8.

To cut the fat some I used fat free mayonnaise and cooked the breaded chicken in the over (instead of frying it). I am sure that it didnt taste quite as good as the fried version but it was still wonderful.

This is the best chicken salad I've had in quite some time.  My eleven yr old ate it up as well!  She said it tasted like tacos.  We put it on a wrap with tomatoes and lettuce.  Makes lots of leftovers for lunches too.  love love love!
