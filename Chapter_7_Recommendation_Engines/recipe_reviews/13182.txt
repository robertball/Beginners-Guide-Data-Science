Awesome Awesome Awesome!! This is the best soup ever! Well I did do some things different though. 
I added 
2 onions
1 clove of garlic 
4 green peppers.
1/2 cup ketchup
2 tbsp. worchestershire
1 cup water
I reduced to 1 cup of rice
Also, instead of a can of chopped tomatoes I picked 6 fresh from the garded blanched them and scrunched them into the mixture. 
I know these seem like alot of changes but they are all pretty small after all. I only changed it to reflect the way I actually make stuffed peppers. Again, this stuff is really awesome!

I love this, although it was dry, so I "souped" it up a bit :)  I'll stick with my version so that it isn't to salty or dry...to this recipe cut the brown sugar to 2 TBSP, cut the sauce to 8 oz, add 2 (10-3/4) cans of tomato soup, sub the soy sauce with 2 TBSP. of Worcestershire sauce, add 2 cups of water, an onion & some garlic(1-2 cloves)...YUM!! Thanks Holly!

A terrific variation on this soup is to use 1 lb of italian sausage instead of ground beef and 3-4 bell peppers (red, yellow, or orange if possible).  It becomes more like a soup if you add 2 c. water with the boullion cubes.  Also, a way to make the soup even simpler to make is to add one cup of uncooked rice along with the other ingredients in step 3.  That way it can just cook up with everything else during the simmer.  This works great for us.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time as written and we weren't too impressed with the soup. I would give the original recipe 3 stars. It was way too sweet for our taste. I then came back and read all the reviews and made changes and would give it 5 stars with the changes. I added another pepper, used can beef broth, used a combination of crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes and tomate sauce (my kids don't like too many chunky tomatoes in anything). I also eliminated the sugar, used worcestshire sauce instead of soy, halfed the pepper and added italian seasoning and garlic powder. This was awesome and will make again.

Thanks for the great recipe!  We tried stuffed pepper soup just the other day for the first time and knew I had to come to allrecipes.com to find a recipe.  I made a few changes to make it soupier.  Also, when I make stuffed peppers I use Italian herbs.  Hense:
Changes to recipe:
*2 green bell peppers (instead of one)
*2 (14 oz) cans beef broth (instead of bullion cube)
*One onion, chopped and added at same time as green peppers
*1 Tbs. worchestershire sause (instead of soy sauce)
*2 cups cooked BROWN rice (instead of white rice)
Add the following 20 minutes before finished simmering:
*1 Tbs Italian seasoning
*1 tsp garlic powder
*1/2 tsp garlic salt
*1/2 Tbs parsley flakes

I thought that this was a great soup.  I made the following changes.  I used ground turkey (a little over a pound) added an onion chopped while the meat was cooking along with 3 cloves of garlic minced.  I used 2 very large peppers, One green and one half red and half green. ( I was surprised the recipe only called for 1).  I used beef broth in place of cubes and I cut back on the brown sugar.  I also added a can of tomato soup and 3 bay leaves.  The Bay is something that MY mother and grandmother always used in stuffed peppers.  That made the soup.  As is 4 stars but with changes way over 5.  Thanks for the good soup!!

This recipe is totally awesome!!!  I used two peppers, 2 cans of beef broth and used worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce. I also added water to decrease thickness. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

If you don't like really thick soups, this may not be the soup for you, otherwise you may have to make some modifications per other reviewers.  Although the soup is thick, my family and I loved it! I added some onion to the meat while browning, added some more green peppers and when the soup was done, I sprinkled a cup of cheese over all.  It is a touch on the salty side so I may reduce either the salt and soy sauce or omit one ingrediant altogther.  I can't wait to make this during the dead cold of winter!! Thanks Holly!

We LOVED this soup!!  Next time I make it I will cut the black pepper in half and add a little more green peppers.  Other than that, it was perfect.  I made the onion, cheese, and garlic bread (recipe found on this site also) to go with the soup.  It made a great meal on a cold rainy day :)  Thanks Holly!

The secret to this soup is add at least 4 peppers, one julienned onion, 4 minced garlic cloves, broth & one TBSP of rice wine vinegar.  Additionally, don't cook the rice in the soup as it "gums" up the works".  Cook on the side and serve over a scoop of rice.  Perfect!

Loved this! I've made this two times so far. Yes it's sweet, but I like it that way! The 2nd time I made this, I used tiny pasta (Pastini) and cooked it right in the pot with the soup. I guess you could also use Orzo pasta as well. I can never get rice right and was afraid of it soaking up too much liquid and getting mushy. Loving the pastini! Also on the 2nd try, I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used a jar of Ragu traditional spaghetti sauce. I swear it tasted even better!!! (Probably the added spices)

Like others, I added more peppers (3 medium), some onions, and switched the soy sauce for worcestershire sauce.  Also topped the bowl with some shredded cheddar, and it was awesome.  I will definitely make this again.

I had to make this soup just as soon as I saw it.  I read the reviews and then made my own personal preference changes to it. First, I used the best groung round I can buy as this is a base to this recipe. I browned it with fresh ground pepper and garlic powder. I then roughly diced a med yellow onion, 1 large green pepper, and 1/2 of a med red pepper, and 2 cloves of garlic and added it to the meat just before the meat was completely browned through and continuted browning until veggies were tender. I drained a very small amount of grease, and added 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce,1 entire 42 oz. bottle of V-8 juice, 3 beef bouillion cubes, 3 cans petite diced tomatoes with juice,1 cup water, the brown sugar, and no salt. I simmered for about 30 -40 minutes, then added only one cup of basmanti rice, which really thickened it up.  Next time I will use regular white rice, I think that will stand up better in this soup. I served with a bit of finely grated cheddar cheese on top of everyones bowl and added a slice of garlic bread on the plate and it was a smash hit! This is a recipe that anyone can play with to make it their own, and be a perfect comfort food favorite.  It is easy, fairly fast, and a keeper!

Ah, yes... you do need another bell pepper for this. And I used Lawry's seasoned pepper, 2 Tbsp.Better Than Boullion dissolved in 2 cups of water, worcestershire as opposed to the soy sauce, no salt, and added a package of Lipton's onion soup mix and 2 Tbsp. of cider vinegar to the pot. Then, it was good soup! Served with Great Garlic Knots, also from this site.

I have been making this recipe for a few yrs it is the bomb.  Everytime i used to make it was when we were around family & they are still asking for the recipe for their friends LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT first time we tried this was at a restraunt & i told my Hubby we can find that recipe & this is the one i use. The only thing i do a little different & it makes it easier is i use 1 boil in bag of rice it just about the right amount you need.  I do put all of mine in crock pot & add the rice about an hour before we eat. I also throw in the Green Pepper when the Ground Beef is almost done. YUM YUM YUM is all i have left to say.

This is very good, but VERY thick! I ended up having to add some beef broth to get it to the consistancy that I wanted. Next time, I think I will maybe 1/2 the rice, so it's more 'soupy' or maybe add extra sauce or something. Also, I think I will reduce or omit the brown sugar, as it was a bit sweet, not in a bad way just different, but still very tasty. I will definately be making this again because it was a HUGE hit with my hubby and the little guy. Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a favorite in our family, and I make it often.  I do change a few things when I make it, but this is a fantasic recipe.  I reduce the brown sugar to 2 TBSP, add 2 cups of beef broth instead of bouillon (to make a bit soupier), and at least 2 more green peppers.  Sometimes is also add crushed red pepper for a little kick.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband took one taste of this soup and told me that as far as he was concerned, I never have to make my "regular" stuffed peppers again. Considering that this recipe is much easier to prepare, and tastes much better, I don't mind shelving my old recipe at all. I did use seven small, chopped green peppers...didn't want to waste the first harvest from the garden...but other than that I prepared this exactly as written. I really enjoyed the slight sweetness of the sugar combined with the soy sauce. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Pretty good. I made some modifications like the others. I added 1 can rotel tomatoes, 1/2 cup water, 1 medium onion chopped, 1 T garlic minced. I would reduce the brown sugar next time and add some more spices.

This was a great tasting soup and very easy! I took some advice from other reviews and added more peppers, onions and garlic, and used worcestershire instead of the soy sauce. I was very pleased and plan on making this again.

This was  very good...a bit too sweet for my taste so next time I'll elimate the sugar entirely.  I also added some crushed red pepper, garlic, onions and a bit of parmesan.

Ouch...I ended up putting over a cup of vinegar in the soup to counteract the sweetness and it was still too much and I hadn't even used the amount of sugar suggested.  Big disappointment...maybe I will try again with little or no brown sugar.

Holly, this soup was amazing! I, of course, gluttoned it up by adding an extra green pepper, and a red bell pepper, all chopped in one inch dice, used 1 good size spanish item diced, for the tomatoes I used 2 cans crushed (29 oz), and one can water, instead of bouillion I added 3 tbsp beef base, and subbed worchestshire (sp?) for the soy, cause I did not have soy in the house. Added 1 tsp.garlic powder, no added salt. In the mix of it simmering I added one can of Campbells Tomato Soup-undiluted, cause that's usually what I top my stuffed peps with. Thanks so much for submitting! We loved it!!! xoxoxo

Thanks to comments by other reviewers, I skipped the bouillon cubes and substituted one can of beef broth and a Tablespoon of "better than bouillon" soup base.  I cut back on the brown sugar a bit and added another green pepper.  This was one thick,delicious soup!! My husband complains that I like to try new recipes so much, that I don't remake some of the ones he loves.  Not a problem here, I will make this again and again.

Five stars with the following changes: 2 Cups water (I think this was an error in original recipe), 2 peppers, chopped, 1-2 T brown sugar, 2 14.5 oz. cans of diced tomatoes with garlic, onion and herbs and cut the black pepper way down.  I left out the soy sauce and did not use Worcestershire since I eat gluten free.  I will definitely make this again!

Variations: brown the meat with 1 small onion, drain. Add all ingredients, plus 2 cups water.  Substitute worchestire sauce instead of soy sauce.  Bring to boil. Then add 1 chopped green and 1 chopped yellow pepper.  Cover and simmer for 1 hr or until peppers soft.  At very end, add 2 cups cooked BROWN RICE for additional 15-20 min.  Oh and by the way, I don't have a Dutch oven so after browning meat and onion, I just transferred to a big pot.   EXCELLENT!!  Thanks Holly!

I love stuffed peppers and this gives you the same taste without all the work.  The family loved it.  I added some minced onion and garlic powder based on others reviews but followed the other spicing exactly.  We will make this again.

I used this as the basis for a great soup the whole family loved.  I incorporated many readers ideas, and was thrilled with the results.  I used 2 lbs grass fed beef and browned it with 2 large onions and 4 cloves of garlic, then added 5 peppers (green, yellow, red), tomato sauce and diced tomatoes as it called for, 1 cup of water, 5 cups of beef broth, no added sugar/salt/pepper, 1 Tblsp worcestershire sauce, and 1 1/2 cups of uncooked brown rice.  Took a little over an hour for the rice to be cooked, and it was heavenly.  We will definitely make it again.

This is a great soup that my husband and I have made many times- in fact he is making it as we speak. If you have trouble with it being a little too thick, you can add the rice later- esp. if you are freezing it- the more rice the thicker, so adjust accordingly. We all love it. We also add tomato juice or V-8 juice instead of tomato sauce. Enjoy.

Loved this soup.  I, too, found that it was a little too thick, so just added some water at the end.  Amazing that one green pepper can give all that good flavor!  Just like having stuffed green peppers without all the work!

This was good but not enough peppers and WAY too thick!  I used 4 green peppers and they still got lost, omitted the salt and added 3 cups of bloody mary mix!  Now, that's soup :)

Easy to make, everyone loved it.  I softened the peppers first in the microwave in a little water, otherwise they are still a little crunchy.  You have to add a little water to leftover soup as the rice sucks it up.  Delicious!! Thanks for the recipe.

Yum - we loved this!  I did use worcestshire sauce rather than soy, added 1/2 cup of chopped onions & added an extra green pepper.  I also left out the salt.  I served this with fresh olive oil bread from the bakery.  It made great leftovers, even though it wasn't nearly as "soupy" by the next evening. (most of the liquid had been absorbed by the rice).  Great recipe, I will be making this again! Thanks!

We really liked this.  I did make a few changes based on our preferences.  First, I added 5 small peppers (probably 3-4 regular sized ones).  Second, I did use worchestershire instead of soy sauce.  Third, I added about 3 cups of cooked rice, as we like a thick soup.

Great Recipe! I only used half the gr. beef as we are watching fat intake. I reduced brown sugar to 2 TSP. Added an extra bell pepper. It was perfect. thank you for the recipe! it makes 10 cups. Good for those who are "watching their weight".

I'm going to be the black sheep with my rating. The brown sugar and bouillon were turn offs for me. I don't use sugar in my stuffed peppers and I didn't use it here either. I used low sodium beef broth, ground turkey, minced onion and garlic and quite a bit of seasonings. Good basic idea tho and thank you.

Husband and I LOVED this!! It's cold and snowing here so thought i'd try this. It really really tastes like stuffed peppers! Didn't have any tomato sauce so used a 29 oz can of tomato puree, doubled the peppers, added some onion and garlic. As I served it I topped the bowls with a sprinkle of cheese, as i put cheese on my original stuffed peppers. Came out wonderful.  I made in crock pot, it makes a full pot. This is a thick soup and filling.  It's a keeper recipe. Going to take left overs to share at work tomorrow. Thanks for such a unique recipe.

This was a delicious soup but I altered it a little bit. I used a 1/2 cup of beef broth instead of the boullion cubes, decreased the salt, used worchestershire sauce instead of soysauce and topped each serving with shredded chedder cheese. Yummy!

I really like this recipe but it was a little too thick and a little too salty for me.  When I make the soup again I will use beef broth in place of the bouillion cubes, thus eliminating both problems, and I will not add any soy sauce as it is also high in sodium.  Also, I did add another green pepper and I added some finely chopped onion as I wanted the soup to taste just like stuffed peppers. (I also used ground sirloin to make the soup leaner and I used long grain brown rice instead of white rice to make it healthier).

I made 2 modifications.  I used 2 peppers instead of 1.  Also, due to horrible planning, I realized I only had 1 can of tomato sauce.  The closest thing in my pantry to a substitute was a can of pizza sauce, so threw it in.  The flavor was fantastic!  When I make again I will plan on using the tomato sauce & pizza sauce.  Very, very good combo!

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to use with ground beef and bell pepper that I needed to use or lose.  This fit the bill.    I only left out the Sugar and added onion and garlic powder.   Thanks for the recipe.

Really really good flavour.  Eats like chili!  I added onions and mushrooms, why not, right?  Only other change I made was using a cup of organic chicken broth instead of the bouillon cube, and I halved the recipe.  Next time (and there WILL BE a next time), I'll use beef broth.  Otherwise, I love this soup just the way it is :)  So much easier than stuffing peppers!

Added some italian seasoning and a can of beef broth. Stirred in one cup of uncooked white rice while simmering. End result was a little too sweet for me and not enough tomato taste. Would do some tweaking next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exact.  In my opinion it was more like really salty spanish rice.  It was not "soupy" at all.  Maybe needs another can of sauce.  Definitly does not need 2 teaspoons of salt and a tablespoon of soy sauce.  I needed 2 cans of ginger ale to get me through a bowl...though a plate and a fork wouldve been just as appropriate.

My husband raved over this...however, she must have forgotten to mention adding water (I added quite a bit) cuz w/out it, this would have the consistancy of sloppy joes not soup! I also cut back a little bit on the bullion & soy sauce fearing it would be too salty w/ soy sauce, bullion, and salt.

This was allright. To my surprise, my hubs liked this quite a bit (he can be picky at times...). I wasn't a fan for two reasons - this was a tad bland for my liking and WAAY too thick to be considered soup. I even added water. After looking at my stockpot, I knew there was no way this would resemble soup without it.... I suggest adding 1 c. water per boullion cube and DOUBLING the liquid when making a full batch of this. Since I halved everything, I added 2 c. of water / 2 bullion cubes. I also added the full T of W sauce (subbed for soy), sugar and seasonings called for (FYI, I used seasoned salt in lieu of plain table salt). My only other changes were using an entire green bell pepper (didn't see the point in wasting half of one), adding a small, chopped onion and using Italian-seasoned tomatoes / garlic & onion flavored tomato sauce (the latter two to add a flavor boost). I also added my rice in step #3, brought my pot to a boil and then simmered for a half hour. Serving steaming bowlfuls with garlic bread, this was a warming meal on this dreary September day. Thanks for sharing, Holly! :-)

I pretty much followed the recipe, except for the diced tomatoes, and this turned out SO YUMMY!! I made it in a big stainless pot cuz I don't have a Dutch oven, and I added the instant rice uncooked after all the other ingredients and letting it "settle" for about 1/2 an hour. Husband was surprised it tasted a little sweet, but he had only good things to say about this, so thanks :)

Just like stuffed peppers, but soup.  I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, other than that I followed the recipe.

Delicious....I lightened this up a bit for calorie and fat reasons. I used extra lean ground chicken instead of beef, added a green and red pepper, onion, 3 cloves of garlic....and also decreased the brown sugar by half and only used 2 tblspns.  Like other reviewers...this was very thick...more chili like...I thinned it out with 2c. of homemade veggie stock. This was very flavorful and easy. Will make again!

I don't know that I would call this a "soup", but it did make for a tasty dish.  It was rather thick as a finished product, but I think mu hubby preferred it that way.  Because I was out of soy sauce, I substituted with worcestershire sauce.  Will definitely make again and again.

I made a few changes to the recipe, for no other reason than the fact that my kitchen is nearly bare. There were no creative changes made, just "broke" changes. Instead of soy, I used Worcestershire sauce. I omitted the brown sugar, added an extra cup of rice (to add bulk). Instead of green peppers, I used two orange peppers, because they were all I had. I did not add the Bouillon cubes, however, I believe that the recipe would be better with it. I unfortunately did not have any. Overall, this is a good recipe, but next time I will most likely follow the recipe exactly, with the addition of garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. It is very filling, and very simple for an inexperienced cook like me. If I could, I would give it 3 and 3/4 stars.

I have been using this recipe for over a year exactly as it is written, and it is the best one I have found.  We love it at our house and I make it several times a month in the fall and winter.  Fast simple and excellent. Don't change a thing.

I prepared 1/2 of the recipe.  The changes I made were to add a cup of V8 juice, and a small chopped onion. This is a thick soup, which I prefer.  Thanks for a great recipe, Holly.

This soup was a bit bland and could use some more spices, but cozy and homey.  

Made it with only half the amount of meat and without brown sugar and soy sauce and used brown rice instead of white.

Great!! Made a few changes. I sauteed onion and garlic while browning beef.  I added 1 can of beef broth, and a dash of crushed red pepper.  Could have used more broth, very thick, but awesome!!!

Good recipe.  I think I'll make a slight change next time I make it.  The tomato sauce is too sweet for my tastes.  I think I'll cut back a little on the brown sugar and maybe add a 4 oz. can of green chilies to make it zesty.

This was FANTASTIC !!! I loved the slightly sweet flavor from the brown sugar . Tastes just like stuffed green peppers in a soup . I used brown rice and added a small onion while browning the ground beef . This recipe is a keeper and will be used over and over again ! Thank you for sharing !

Delicious!  My 4 year old, my husband and myself gave this 5 stars - my 2 year old gave it "a moon".  I don't know what that is, but she ate it all!  :)  Easy recipe, delicious - just like stuffed peppers without all the work.  Thank you!

This was more like goulash than a stew, but we did like it. I used one pound of beef instead of two, two peppers instead of one and added some onion. I will definitly decrease the amount black pepper next time, as it turned out too spicy for our taste.

This tastes just like stuffed peppers but easier to prepare and eat.  It is a very thick soup but that's what we liked about it.  It's similar to cutting up a stuffed pepper, stirring it around, and then eating.  I also left out the soy sauce, used a little less salt, and only used a sprinkling of brown sugar.  The BF really enjoyed it.

Delicious soup! I made a half recipe and also added chopped onion with the green peppers and beef. I didn't add the soy sauce but did add dried oregano, basil, a few bay leaves, and of course, crushed garlic! I subbed a can of tomato soup for the sauce. The sugar really helps with the flavor here also. It was very soupy when I made it a few days ago, but it has really thickened. I'm now glad that I didn't add the cooked rice to the soup, only putting a little in the bowl before adding the soup. I could see chopped cabbage here, too. It would taste like a golumpki (stuffed cabbage)! This is a winner, thanks Holly!

Loved this recipe! I was craving stuffed green pepper soup and this hit the spot! I pretty much followed the recipe to a 't' but here are the few changes I made/would make: I substituted soy sauce for Worcestershire sauce. I also only did 1 lb of meat which was more than enough for me but I did 3 bell peppers. I also recommend doing maybe 3 cups of rice. 2 wasn't enough for me. Also, the soup was initially thicker than I'd like so I added beef broth along with the bouillon cubes. DO NOT do like previous reviewers suggested and throw the uncooked rice in in step 3. I did it on my first attempt and it sucked all the moisture out. Great, great recipe!

I made this soup last night and it was phenomenal. I changed a few things with mine though. First, when browning the beef I added half of a sweet onion diced. Also, I only had 1.3# of meat left, so I used a red pepper and a green pepper in the soup to give it more substance. Lastly, I added maybe an extra tsp. of soy sauce to the soup, and when it was done cheddar and saltines on top....I guess that just how I like it. Thanks for sharing! Enjoy!

Added some onion with the green pepper.  I added the rice uncooked, but next time I will cook it separate.  Also, too much tomato sauce.  Gonna use diced tomatoes and beef broth instead of some of the sauce.  Very good. And used worshire instead of soy.

Very good soup. This is my 2nd time making this kind of soup. I used another recipe before. But of course I made changes. I used about 5 Bell Peppers, thought it could use more. 1 lg. onion, 29 oz. Crushed tomatoes, 2 - 15 oz. Stewed tomatoes -chopped up and 2 - 15 oz. Beef broth. Did add the brown sugar, but added little at a time, tasted until I thought it was right. Used the soy sauce, but thought it needed more of something. Didn't have the Worcestershire sauce that some say they used. So I added Teriyaki sauce, which is on the sweet side. Between that and the stewed tomatoes (that are also sweet) I think next time will leave the brown sugar out. Used 1 cup of uncooked rice that I added during step 3. But to me it needs less rice. The rice will continue to absorb the liquid. So you end up with more of a stew than soup. Seasoned with seasoning salt to the ground beef. Garlic powder, no salt ( I get this at Big Lots), and dried parsley added to the soup. Will use this one again with my own variations of course. Thanks for the recipe!

Like others, I substituted worcestershire sauce for soy sauce. Also, I only had one beef bouillon cube, so I used it plus a can of beef broth. I followed another recommendation by keeping the rice separate from the soup and serving the soup on top of the rice. I also added a small onion with the pepper. This was spectacular and I will be making this again and again and again!!!

I use this basic recipe, but adapted a couple of changes from my mom's recipe.  Instead of a can of tomato sauce I use a large can of vegetable juice (V8 or your store brand) and substitute Worcestershire sauce for soy sauce.

This soup was fantastic!  The best stuffed pepper soup I have ever made!  The only change I made was I didn't use soy sauce because I didn't have any.  I used my homemade tomato sauce and home canned stewed tomatoes instead of the diced.  Oh so good!

Fantastic!  I changed the recipe a bit. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also added in 1/2 off a white onion. Instead of plain white rice, I used basmati rice. Great soup!!

My husband & I love this this soup, but I did have to remove the excess salt. Since bouillon is already salty, I left out the salt and soy sauce. I did add a large chopped onion, 2-3 cloves chopped garlic, worcestershire sauce, tabasco sauce or red pepper flakes to taste. I serve it with cheddar cheese, sour cream and garlic bread.

Made this for dinner tonight and it is wonderful. We enjoyed ours with some fresh sweet bread.
The only changes I made were to use 1 15oz. can of diced tomatoes + 1 can of Rotel. I also used deer meat as I didn't have any ground beef.

The recipe does make a HUGE pot of soup. Next time I will half the recipe.
Though having a huge pot allowed me to freeze half for a quick dinner some night soon.

One word: YUM!!!!! What a fantastic combination of flavors. Will be making this many times during the cool months ahead. The only changes I made based on what I had on hand were 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper, added some diced onion to use it up and used about 1/2 cup or so ketchup (I thought I had tomato sauce but didn't). Omitted the brown sugar since ketchup is sweet already. Also, based on comments about thickness I added about 3 or so cups of water. Turned out a great soup consistency and delicious!

Excellent! I used 1 lb ground pork (pork because it was on hand and 1 lb to cut back on calories) and it turned out great. I think 2 lbs would be much. I also used tomato juice rather than sauce to make it more soupy and it worked great. Quite tasty!

This soup was very good.Not great but very good.My husband liked it and so did I and I will be making it again. I did what others did and modified it a bit. I added 2 cups of water so it was not so thick,still thick but not as thick, I added 4 cloves of garlic chopped,2 medium onions, and also used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy and only used salt to taste or it will be to salty. I only used about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar also. With these modifications it was very good. As I said I will make again and this will go into my recipe box for many meals to come.

This was very tasty but we did make some adjustments.  We cut the soy sauce and used some left over pasta sauce in place of some of the tomato sauce.  It turned out awesome, especially with the italian addition.

I am new to this site.  The first recipe I made was the Stuffed Pepper Soup I.  I give this a 5 star because the preparation and cooking time is quick and easy. I really love the taste of  peppers in this soup.  The combination of the ingredients makes the soup so delicious.  I would also like to add that I also added the free application to my Iphone.  Looking forward to trying new recipes. A coworker informed me of allrecipes.com.

Added 1 cup uncooked rice to soup and let it cook, this was easier and very good.  Still a thick soup; may want to increase liquid.

I made a few slight changes after making it several times.  I sautéed a hopped green pepper with an onion then added remaining ingredients.  NI used 3 beef bouillon, 1 cup uncooked rice and 3 cups of water.

This came out too thick for it to be called a soup so I added some water and there just wasn't enough flavor. I'm not even going to try and make this again, I threw lots of it away.

This soup tastes just like stuffed peppers, we all really enjoyed it. I did make changes to it, based on personal preferences. I left out the soy sauce, salt and pepper ( used it to taste) added another beef cube, more tomato sauce ( 15oz) because it was thick but not really saucy, an extra sprinkle of brown sugar and another pepper. I used minute rice so I just brought it to a boil and added the rice ( 2 cups dry) turned it low and simmered it. Thanks for a good recipe.

Very good recipe!  Takes all the work and long baking time out of stuffed greeen peppers.  I was a little turned off with one of the flavors in it though, I can't decide if it was the soy sauce or too much bouillion?  My husband loves stuffed peppers and loved this!!  I will be making again but tweak it just a bit.  Thanks for a great alternative to stuffed peppers!

Tastes just like stuffed peppers and much easier to prepare!  A simple, foolproof recipe.  I added more green pepper and some water.  It made a lot, so I froze some.

This recipe is so easy & makes a great meal for a cold day.  I made a few alterations:  I used a bit more than 2 lbs. of ground sirloin, 3 large green peppers, only a 1/2 tsp. salt & only 1 bouillon cube.  Everyone I served it to loved it ... even kids.

I just made this recipe and I have to say that it's delicious! I made 1/2 the recipe and doctored it up a bit. I used beef broth, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and a small onion. I cooked the green pepper and onion with the ground beef. It wasn't thick but that's o.k. It made alot. I will be making this again.

This was good, although it didn't blow me away. My two guests loved it, but I think it's a matter of personal taste, since I've never really liked stuffed peppers so my opinion is slanted. It's a very thick, hearty stew, I certainly wouldn't call it soup. I used a can of beef broth and a few bouillon granules instead of cubes, lots more spices including garlic powder, season salt, Italian seasoning, hot sauce and I used Worchestershire in place of the Soy sauce. I used two green peppers and added 1/2 chopped onion. Also, I used 1 cup of Uncle Ben's instant brown rice, just added it to the mix and simmered till the rice was done. I didn't add any of the plain salt called for and only about 1/4 of the pepper. I think if I was a stuffed pepper lover, I would probably have given this recipe 5 stars, but ah well. I served this with cornbread and it was a big hit with my guests so if you like stuffed peppers, better try this recipe.   Kaye

This was very good! Very easy to prepare as well! I used 1 1/2 green pepper (I had a half from another time, so it was convenient!) Next time, I'll cut the salt to 1 tsp and cut the pepper to either 1/4 tsp or 1/2 tsp. It was really spicy! I only used 1 boullion cube (all I had!) and it worked fine. I am glad that this wasn't a "soup," but rather a stew. I love it most that way! Thank you very much for posting this recipe, I will be sure to make it again!

We enjoyed this soup, a little too salty.  I substituted beef base for the bouillion cubes and added more water as it was thicker than we like soup.  Next time will omit the salt and cut the pepper in half.

Excellent flavor...I only made a few changes. I pureed everything except the meat and rice (I always need to hide vegetables from the kids). I also had no soy sauce on hand, so I left it out. I will make this one again, with just one change. My family prefers a lot of broth, so next time I will use only one cup of rice. Or I will use a beef broth rather than the bouillon cubes.

In general, my boyfriend and I LOVE stuffed peppers so I was thrilled to find this recipe for a new dinnertime twist! This was soooo good! Its more like a thick stew but delicious none-the-less!! I too added some minced onion while sauting the beef, added a little more green bell pepper, ommitted the salt, decreased the soy sauce, added a little brown sugar and sprinkled cheese over each bowl. Leftovers were amazing and my boyfriend said his friends were jealous when he brought this to work for his lunch. Music to my ears! Will repeat this recipe for sure!!

I wouldn't really call this a soup, because it's so thick, that it's pretty much a stew. That said, it was really tasty.  I used two peppers since they were on the small side, and it could have even used more.  It was so easy to make, and really hearty, especially on the cold, rainy night, as it was yesterday.  Tasted even better re-heated today.  I'll be making this again.

THe aroma in the house was terrific. Would change a few things though... very thick- might use less tomato sauce and sub. for beef broth. Use less bouillon, did you see how much sodium was in this? Didn't even put in any salt- enough in the bouillon. Would reduce the pepper, too. 
With all that in mind, I did REALLY enjoy this soup!

This recipe is a very good one considering the few items that are needed to complete the recipe. Yes, I did make one change and that was using beef broth instead of bouillon cubes. The brown sugar made a difference in the taste of the soup and it turned out delicious, hubby commented on how good the taste of the soup was and had two big bowls. Thanks for the recipe.

I made a few minor changes.  I added  onions,  because I put them in almost everything.  I only made  half  the recipe because I live alone and the whole recipe made way too much  even if l freeze  most of the left overs. I also added extra water so it wouldn't be quite so thick.  This reminds me of a dish we used to make  called Spanish rice.  The only  difference is  that the latter had more rice and less tomato sauce . I will definitely make this again.

I absolutely love this recipe! Very easy, yet hearty meal.  Will definitely make again. I might add some onions next time when I sauté the peppers. I'm not a huge fan of green bell peppers, so I was pleasantly surprised how far 1 pepper went with such a large portion of food.

I liked the recipe but made a few substitutions. I added a chopped onion along with the green pepper, Worcestershire instead of soy sauce. I didn’t think it needed the brown sugar at all. And, it was so thick I added beef broth to make  it more of a soup than a stew.  Also throw in herbs of your choice. I liked oregano in this.

This was a very tasty dish and the whole family loved it. We did make a couple substitutions. We did 1 lb ground beef and 1lb hot Italian sausage. We also substituted crushed tomatoes for tomato sauce. A very quick, easy, go to for any night. Very good recipe.

I made it per the directions, as I usually do with a new recipe.  Added salt is not needed as the boullion adds the salt. Brown sugar is not needed. I've never had a stuffed pepper that is sweet as this soup is. It also needs another green pepper. One can barely taste the green pepper it is as is. 
That all having been said, I'll definitely try this one again without adding salt or brown sugar, and I might add onion and another green pepper.

Not really a soup, it’s more of stew consistency.   Really good, but I would decrease the brown sugar. It was a little too sweet. I would also add one more green pepper.

We enjoyed this soup a lot.  The changes I made were mostly from necessity. I was out of tomato sauce so used an extra can of tomatoes pureed.  Used beef broth instead of bouillon, and a red pepper instead of green.  Per other reviews I added a little garlic powder, about 1/2 cup of diced onion and 1T of Worcestershire.  Cooked my rice with half water half beef broth.

I made it this morning and my wife loved it! (I did too) I made a few changes to the recipe. I used two peppers (one green and the other a red pepper), added a chopped onion and chopped fresh rosemary, and skipped the soy sauce.  Also I made three cups of rice (1c rice and 2c water) Next time I make it I'll likely add some other herbs such as marjoram and savory.

as it stands it's a 3. More stop than soup not enough pepper and kind of bland. And the sugar is not something we would enjoy. But since the recipe is so very versatile i goes it to a 5. Mine turned out fantastic!
 I used Aloha peppers and since they are sweet used like 3 ,added a sweet onion, oregano, garlic and a bunch else I can't remember lol. This is more of a stoup, it really to thick, and I wanted it thinner so I could cook the rice in it so I added a 4 cup container of chicken broth. we like Jasmine rice and it cooked wonderful in the soup. This is so good! I wish I would of made bread...but I can't eat bread so I didn't want to tempt myself.

Delicious for a weekday meal with leftovers for work.  4 stars for the original recipe!  I enjoy traditional "dry soups"  very much. To suit my own taste, the second time I added 3 coloured peppers, sauteed with one sweet onion and a small clove of garlic. This summer I'll make it with fresh garden tomatoes, onions and tiny zucchini,  all sauteed with olive oil. Maybe grilled veg would make a nice twist !

I made it exactly the way it says only I reduced the ingredients in half.  Makes a lot of soup for just one person.  I don't like stuffed peppers but I loved this soup.  I have made it three times now and I have given this receipt  to family members and they also love it.  It is so easy and quick to make.

This was really good. I did make some changes, based on previous reviews. I used 2 1/2 green bell peppers (could still use more, and I don't really care for them LOL), added an onion,  2 cans of beef broth instead of the bouillon, subbed worcestershire for the soy and just added a cup of uncooked rice with everything else. Turned out great!

I did some modification and it turned out fantastic. Cut rice in half and added 2c riced cauliflower. Used ground turkey instead of beef. Added the rolice and cauliflower with the rest of ingredients versus waiting until end. Added about 10-14 oz of water to compensate for uncooked rice.

Instead of using hamburger, I used bratwurst. I peeled the casing off a package of 6 links of bratwurst and then browned it in the pan as described in the recipe. I also used the pork flavoring from a package of Pork flavored Ramen noodles because I wanted to use with what I had. I was quite proud of myself! It turned out WONDERFUL! My husband ate a double portion and quickly devoured both bowls. What a handy recipe!

Very tasty soup but way too much rice for my liking.  Next time I'd read the reviews first and cut the rice in half.  Also did not add salt as I figured the soy sauce would make it salty enough.

I added beef stock rather than a bouillon cube to make it more soup-like.  I thought it was a little bland so I added a couple more peppers and some onion.  Hubby liked it (after he added some hot pepper sauce)

Followed recipe exactly as described. Thought it was pretty bland. It's called stuffed pepper soup and only called for 1 pepper. I then added 6 more peppers and turned out great. If recipe called for 6-8 peppers I would have given a 5 star. Definitely add more peppers.

This was excellent. My husband also liked it.

I only used 1 pound of ground meat and 1 1/2 cups of rice, but I used a whole green pepper.  I added 1/4 cup of ketchup, 2 T. Worcestershire sauce and a cup of water, as recommended in another review. 

I would cut the brown sugar down, up to half.

To make healthier I used ground turkey and brown rice as well as adding a glove of garlic or some garlic powder. I have made several times and it’s perfect. Do not use the suggestion of adding Worcestershire! Gives it an “off” taste.

Modifications: Added half an onion and used 2 green peppers instead of one. Cooked the chopped onion and peppers in some oil and garlic for a couple minutes, then added the browned beef, then the rest of ingredients. Used 1 can Rotel, 1 can crushed tomatoes (essentially the same thing), and 2 small cans of tomato sauce. Added Worcestershire sauce, and only used 1 beef bouillon cube.

I love stuffed peppers but hate how much time has to go into them so finding this recipe years ago was a blessing! 
Thankfully I read the reviews before trying it out and after making this soup many times over the years, with different modifications each time, I've got it down to a science! 
With the following modifications, my family and I feel this soup is perfect!

I start off seasoning the ground beef with seasoning salt, onion powder, and garlic powder while browning. (Using 93% makes less grease so I don't bother draining before adding other ingredients.) Instead of beef bouillon cubes, I use 32 oz of beef broth. This makes a 'soupier' consistency. Substitute worcestershire sauce for the soy sauce. 
I also use 3 large green peppers, one just isn't enough! Lastly, to make a heartier soup, I use 3 cups of rice instead of 2, as the original recipe calls for.

Awesome flavor though I did spice it up with a pinch of cayenne and red pepper flakes. Even the kids loved it. Will need to add water to leftovers - rice soaked up all the liquid.

Added 1 lb. Italian sausage, 1/4 C brown sugar, Worcestershire, cumin, garlic, red pepper flakes,  fire roasted tomatoes, and baked the brown rice in broth using Alton Brown's simple but great recipe.

I love this soup!  But I, like many other reviewers, made some changes. I used red, yellow and green peppers, cut out all of the tomatoes except for the canned tomatoes, used hot Italian sausage I.stead of ground beef, and didn't use the brown sugar or soy sauce, and added uncooked rice before the simmer. It's  a few less ingredients but still packs a ton of flavor.

This was really good.  It's rare a family of five can agree as a whole something is a favorite, but this is one of them. I have a few people who are not fond of green peppers but they gobbled this up. Will definitely make again.

Love this soup!  It's meant to be thick and chunky, so don't expect a thin soupy soup.  It reminds me of the last bowl from a big pot of stuffed cabbage, which we always ended up putting a couple of stuffed peppers in!

I didn't add the sugar and it came out just fine.  The soy sauce is a MUST and adds great flavor.  

Perfect for when I'm craving one of my favorite Hungarian comfort foods, but don't have the time to roll cabbages and stuff peppers!  Next time I make this, me thinks I will use chopped cabbage instead of the peppers?!?

Big winner in our house! I add about a half cup dried split red lentils while cooking.  Also a little hot sauce in my bowl with a spoonful of sourcream and a few Oyster crackers...delicious!

This was SO good. The only thing I did was add 1/2 diced onion and a couple cloves of garlic, chopped. Everything else was exactly as the recipe reads. It might get thick so you might need to add water. Excellent recipe! I will definitely make this again.

The flavor is very good.  Definitely need to add some liquid (probably beef broth) next time I make it as it was more like a casserole instead of soup.

Loved it with a few changes. I only put about 3 tbs of brown sugar. I added a box of chicken broth and about a tbs of worchestishire sauce. I added a cup and a half of instant rice to the soup at the end of summer time and cooked the rice right in the pot. It was delicious.

Excellent!!! Have made this many times now. I do a couple things differently. I do not add the water, so my version is less soup like. I also add one can of tomato sauce. I also add a lot more peppers than the recipe calls for. This is now a regular in my home!

I made it a vegan recipe by using  vegan broth and veggie ground.  I used 1.5 peppers, added one whole chopped onion, and quite a bit of minced garlic, and then chill pepper, oregano, cumin and tobasco sauce. So, this recipe is a great base for using your creativity.

Just made this to serve tomorrow for Super Bowl. Adjusted it for 20 servings (IF there is any left, we love leftovers) and also tweaked it a bit.  Added Italian seasoning, extra parsley, sautéed fresh chopped garlic with the ground beef, added both soy and worsteshire sauce, then threw in a package of dehydrated onion soup mix., and a quart of beef stock. Soup is always better the second day, but this is awesome now!

I have made this twice now and both times it was excellent.  The first time I cooked the rice in the soup and the second time I cooked the rice in my rice cooker and then added soup over some rice in a bowl.  I preferred the rice cooker version but plenty of guests liked the rice cooked in the soup better.  The only thing I changed was I cooked it in my slow cooker - yum!

I added a small onion, some garlic and doubled the peppers.  I did add 2 cups of water.  Only because I was going to add the cooked rice and simmer it longer.  I also used ground venison because I had some. It worked out perfectly.

I only gave this 4 stars because I had to do 
Mse tweaking for my family's liking...I added about about 2 cloves minced garlic to the ground "beef" (I use ground turkey), reduced the tomato sauce to a 14 ounce can, and used a 14 ounce can each diced and crushed tomatoes as we aren't big cooked tomato people. I added 2 cups beef broth, 2 bouillon cubes and the tomato sauce can full of water (gotta get every last drop!). I also used more green pepper and added the rice to the bowls as I served them

Made this last night.  All I added was a diced onion and less rice.   So good.  My husband took a big bowl to work for lunch today and ate 2 bowls last night.  Very cheap to make as well.  Makes a lot.  Thanks for the recipe.

Rave reviews from all when I brought this in for soup day at work!!  It is very thick though as written; therefore I did add water to this and also substituted worcestershire for soy sauce.  A second green pepper is also recommended as well as a clove or two of garlic.

My husband loved this recipe.  Told me to keep it on the rotation.  I used Braggs liquid amino's instead of soy sauce.  I cut the salt down to one teaspoon instead of two.

I took the advice of other reviewers and added some onion to the hamburger, used three green peppers, added a bay leaf and cut the brown sugar to two tablespoons, DELICIOUS~and filling.

I followed the recipe exactly to the last teaspoon.
To me it seemed more like a soupy spanish rice more than a soup.
Disappointed :(

The brown sugar really ruined this soup.  Waaaaayyyyy to sweet for our taste.  Also, with the amount of meat, there was not enough green pepper - should have been 2.  The Stuffed Pepper Soup 1V from this site was much better - it still needed tweaked but it was better than this one.

Oh my goodness!  This is amazing!  One of the few recipes that I've followed exactly.  The family was very impressed by it as well.  I highly recommend sprinkling a little grated cheese on each bowl before serving.  I will be making this one often.

I read the reviews and took tips from others.  I cooked the ground beef with garlic powder, added Italian seasoning, used beef broth, substituted Worcestershire for the soy sauce, and added a dash of red hot.  It was was awesome!

Thank you for this recipe!My dad used to make this. He & I were the only ones in the house who liked it so he didn't make it very often. Now that he's in his 80's he never makes it but I still dream about it! I asked him for the recipe once & he wrote out "hamburger, mango's(we always called this mango soup),rice. Cook most of the day. Later he told me if it was too thick to thin it with tomato juice. I knew that wasn't all the ingredients but it's been so long I couldn't think what else was in it. I have a big pot on the stove right now & I can't wait till it's done!5 stars because of fond memories but I will update when it's done. I'm looking forward to taking Dad a big bowl of it!

I have to say this is wonderful, I followed the recipe except used Worcestershire sauce in place of the soy sauce and added two extra green peppers.

I made this soup.I used ground beef.I browned the beef and
added the garlic,onions and both halves of Green and Yellow
Bell peppers.I added the Bell Peppers when the meat was browned.
I used about six cups water for the soup.I used Ragu Spagehetti
sauce instead of tomato sauce.I used a teaspoon of beef bouillon.
I transfered the hamburger mixture to the soup pot.I added some
kernel corn and green beans.I seasoned the soup with basil and
Oregano and one bay leaf,and 2 tablespoons brown sugar.I used some flour to thicken the soup up.I let the soup cook for about 20 minutes.I cooked the rice by itself.I served with Mozzeralla cheese.
the soup came out perfect.I look forward to making it again.
Its better to serve the soup over the rice.

This was my first time making stuffed pepper soup. It was very good but made a few changes. I added 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic, a half chopped onion and added an extra half a pepper and a cup of water. Next time I will add even more green pepper as it did not have enough for my taste.

Great basic recipe, but I did make some changes. I used ground turkey instead of beef, omitted the soy sauce, added a can of beef broth, and one chopped onion to the ground turkey as it was browning. I do not have a dutch oven, so I just browned the meat on the stove in a frying pan. WOw! Everyone LOVED it!

I have made it many, many times over the years and it is always a big hit with my toughest critics (my family).

I only use about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.

My husband loved this thick and meaty soup.  The recipie as is probably could use more spices...I added generous amounts of garlic powder, pepper and dry onion flakes to the ground beef after it was browned.  I omitted the chopped tomatoes (husband doesn't like them) and topped the soup off with parmesean cheese sprinkled over each bowl. With the leftovers, I think I'll try adding a few drops of hot pepper sauce to liven it up even more.  I served this with hot homemade French Bread, and my husband couldn't get enough.  Thanks, Holly!
