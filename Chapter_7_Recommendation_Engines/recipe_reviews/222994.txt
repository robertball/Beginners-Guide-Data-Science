This was good. I thought the sauce was too gingery when I tasted it by itself, but when I had it with the chicken it was fine. Didn't have grapeseed oil, so I used canola.  Next time I think I'll add a green veggie to this... was a nice way to use loquats

Way too much ginger. I had to add another 2 cups of orange juice and thin it with cornstarch, and it was still too gingery. I will make it again, but I will be cutting the ginger to 1 teaspoon ginger and the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon.

I'm making this dish for the fourth time right now, given that I have two loquat trees that are loaded with ripe fruit. I agree with the use-less-ginger reviewers. This time I'm not frying the chicken but using steamed chicken breast instead.  

Like the quince, the loquat (níspero) is tart in taste and I find that few people appreciate it, wanting to sugar it heavily. I don't add any sugar or at most a teaspoon for the benefit of others.

This was delicious!  I just wish I had of found this recipe sooner.( Like at the beginning of the season we have 3 huge Loquat trees and I was determined this year to find something to do with this amazing fruit.  This recipe reminds me of my homemade Orange Chicken. A family FAVE.
I did some variations  I didn't have OJ so I used lemon juice and coconut water, no lemon pepper, dash of Himalayan salt, dash of ginger because it does get overwhelming pretty quick, dash of cinnamon,1/4 cup of Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar and a dash of soy sauce. while I was letting the sauce simmer I fried my chicken pieces in corn starch in flour with just reg. Veg Oil. After they were finished  I put them in with loquat sauce which by now was nice and sticky let it set together for about 10 minutes so the  chicken could absorb the flavor. I had some stir fried cabbage and ate it with that it complimented the stir fry very well. I will be making this again soon only next time I will be using frozen loquats hopefully it taste as yummy.

I reduced the ginger to 1 teaspoon, but kept everything else as called for.  It turned out so delicious!  Served over wild rice with a side salad.  Definitely a keeper recipe for loquat season!

The only thing I changed was using olive oil instead of grape seed oil.  First foray into Loquats everyone loved this!  We were wondering if we could freeze the sauce since the season for Loquats is short.

Cooked it all together in the skillet, instead of separately cooking the sauce and chicken. No problem with the amount of ginger, etc. Used a little buerre manie to thicken at the end. This dish was a hit!

I used 1/2 tsp of ginger and  1/2 tsp of cinnamon, also used coconut oil instead of grape seed oil, really you can use just about any oil available. My bf and i loved the sauce. I think next time i'll be adding some sort of nut for  texture
