This was outstanding, and not difficult to make. I thought before I put it in the oven that it was going to look a mess, because I used a decorative pie dish that was slightly deeper than a regular 9” pie plate, and had problems fitting the pastry into the dish. However, when I took it out of the oven it was magnificent. The puff pastry had indeed puffed and covered up my clumsy handling. It tasted delicious, too. Can’t wait to make it again.

Mushrooms are my favorite food so I decided to try this recipe. This is a yummy meal for sure. I really liked it and so did everyone else. My boyfriend said he was going to go "brag" about the yummy dinner he had last night because he liked it so much. So if he likes it, you should too!!

I added a little drizzle of honey before placing the top layer on. Honey with Marsala is great! (cooking wine version, anyway). And maybe a little more Marsala than the recipe says :-)

I picked up some baby bellas recently and wasn't sure what I was going to do with them - so happy I came across this recipe - delicious and pretty easy too. I keep going back for another sliver :) I followed the recipe pretty much and just followed advice to salt & pepper at each step tasting the parts as I made them. Also didnt cook all the liquid out of the mushrooms...kept just a bit...and used a little extra marsala - for a less 'firm' filling. It was great. 

Also - another reviewer mentioned adding a drizzle of honey. I did not add it in the pie but was curious to taste with my slice. HEAVEN. I think I will give the interior a drizzle next time before adding the top pastry. 

Addictively delish - Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is fabulous! It is easy to make and just  about fool proof. I made it as is but I added leftover grilled chicken to make it a complete meal. I will definitely make it again.

Very nice recipe. Modified it a bit.
Next time I make this dish I will not reduce the mushroom, onion, shallot mixture as much so the filling is a bit more "juicy".
1. I made a pie crust instead of using the pastry.
2. Followed another reviewers suggestions and added two cloves of finely minced garlic and increased the marsala by 1/4 cup.
3. Sauteed the minced garlic in butter for the roux. Then continued with the regular recipe.
4. Used a whole small minced onion.
5. Used a whole small minced shallot.
6. 1 1/2 tbl of fresh minced thyme
7. Used 2 lb of 3 different fresh mushrooms.
8. Used heavy cream instead of half & half.

Delicious recipe. Tastes better with good quality marsala wine.. The second time I made it, I added 2 cloves of garlic to the sauce step and increased marsala by an additional 1/4 cup.   I also cut flour down using 1 less tbsp to decrease the thickness of the sauce a little. Be sure to generously salt and pepper at each step. Husband LOVED it!  Btw, use these pointers, as the first time I made it exactly per the recipe, it was good but was bland and lacked the gourmet flare it deserves!!

I love this recipe and make it almost every week! I eat it for any meal, breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I wish I could make it exactly as it's written, but I can't imagine how it could taste better!
I am on a very restricted diet and I have to leave out the wine, half and half and pepper. I just use a little extra chicken or vegetable broth and I add about a teaspoon of ground nutmeg.

Nice, easy recipe.  I liked it, but it didn’t bowl me over.  My guests, however,  loved it.  I thought the liquid in the filling was a little too thick for my liking (more gelatinous than gravy-ish),  so I would add a bit more of the chicken broth next time.  I also thought it could use more spices.  It baked up beautifully, and in exactly the time specified.  I will make it again.
