mmmmmmmmmmmmmm,mmmmmmmmmmmmmm good. I have made this recipe numerous times and really enjoy the salad. So easy to prepare. I never measure, just start with drizzling olive oil on cookie sheet, add as much fresh spinach as possible, marinated artichoke hearts, some garlic salt, sprinkle with bacon bits, drizzle artichoke marinade from the jar over salad (be generous) and add feta cheese over top of salad. If you have a red onion, slice it thin and add it. Makes a complete meal for two. Thanks so much for the recipe....

Very delicious! I added some extra feta cheese and used canned artichoke hearts, then made a balsamic vinaigrette to pour over entire thing. ONe problem i encountered, though: the leaves on the bottom of the pan got soaked and too mushy, since they were sitting in the dressing.

This recipe is spectacular!  SO easy and I really got so many requests to make it again for our Christmas dinner.  I also added about 2 Tbsps of balsalmic vinegar before sprinkling the cheese on top!   LOVED IT!

This was excellent. Like some other reviewers suggested, I added a splash of balsamic vinegar. I used white onions and added a red bell pepper. We've had this as a salad and also as a main dish stuffed inside a pita. Very easy and very tasty.

We loved this--this time.  I had tried this recipe before, but I wasn't willing to use all the marinade from the artichokes since it is so high fat.  Then it occurred to me that probably 3 Tbsp would be plenty for this much spinach if I tossed the marinade with the spinach first before putting it on the baking sheet.  Worked like a charm.  I also coursely chopped the artichoke hearts and used a bit of parmesan in place of the feta.  (We had feta several times this week in other dishes and wanted variety.)  Cooked for 8 minutes which was plenty.  Big hit with everyone.  Thanks.

This was a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving dinner! A few thoughts: there was too much feta for my family's taste, but we're not a feta family. I contemplated using canned artichokes bc they're cheaper, but I think the flavor would've really been compromised. Also, the salad looked beautiful on the baking sheet but it took up way too much space; I guess you could dump it all in a bowl, but it just wouldn'tl ook as nice. Lastly, next time I'll add some chicken for my husband, who refused to eat vegetables unless there is an equitable representation of protein in the dish! :) Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this was a pretty yummy salad and I love eating a lot of spinach in my diet so I will definitely make it again.  Like some of the other reviewers, I also feel that there was way too much onion.  Next time I will use 1/4 of a red onion.

I changed this recipe a little after reading the reviews.  I used goat cheese with balsamic vinegrette dressing and 1/3 of a red onion... it was a huge hit at the SuperBowl party!

SO good! I did make a mistake, though... I thought that 10 oz. of spinach looked like too much, so I just used a 6 oz. bag. I forgot that spinach shrinks so much when cooked! It was still delicious, although I will definitely use the full 10 oz. next time. Even with my mistake, this salad was fabulous! I served it with lasagne and garlic bread, and all of the flavors blended perfectly.

This was GREAT! I make it all the time now. I have used seasond Feta & even low fat Feta. I never measure anything when I make it so I know I add more Artichoke hearts than listed. I just slip it in the oven until warm with whatever I am cooking along with it no matter what temp. the oven is on. Thanks

I was really excited about this salad, but was a little disappointed by it. It was a little bland for my husband & I, although the rest of the family really enjoyed it.  I only used 1/2 the onion called for, but not being an onion fan, I thought it still too much.

Big hit at Christmas dinner!! I did add balsamic vinegar and crumbled bacon, didn't measure any of the ingredient, just drizzled everything on.  Also, I didn't steam the spinach before just put it straight on the pan, and the texture turned out just right for my family!  Will make over and over again!!

The first time I made this I did it per instructions with the marinade from the jar of artichokes.  It was very bitter and not a pleasant flavor (I used Native Forest marinated quartered artichokes) it may have been the citric acid in the ingredient list of this product.  Anyway, I made this again with just plain canned artichokes in water that I marinated in a simple french vinegrette and about 3 TBS on top of the salad before baking and it turned out wonderful.  It's also a very appealing salad to look at.  So, three stars as written with pre-marinated chokes and 4 or five using different vinegrette.  Will make this often with that minor adjustment!  Thanks

I absolutely love this.  I've made it numerous times since finding it a few weeks ago.  I make it as written, although I can see that there would be fun things to add.  I use the big jar of marinated artichokes from Costco, so I don't know if I use more or less than what it says.  Probably more.  As for the the complaints on the flavor, I think you have to be a fan of marinated artichokes to begin with.  Otherwise the flavor could be too strong.
Everyone that I've cooked it for has asked for the recipe.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish. Only change I made was in how I assembled it. I tossed the spinach, onions and artichokes (sliced into bite sized pieces) in a large bowl with the olive oil and artichoke liquid, then placed on a baking sheet and sprinkled with the feta and a little course ground black pepper.

I did not like this at all, sorry. Hubby did- but then changed his mind when it came to leftovers and figures he just must've been really hungry:) Anyway, I think I should've just used my good ingredients in a more classic salad.

Great combination of ingredients. However, be careful if you are not a big fan of vinegar. I've never cooked a recipe with artchokes before and I didn't realize until after making that vinegar was the main ingredient in the 'marinade' for the artichokes. I'll have to see if there's an alternative type for next time. One full onion was a little much for my preference so I'll probably cut back on that to a half, depending on the size.

This was very good and looked beautiful on the tray. The only problem I had was with the brand of marinated artichokes I used--they were a bit too vinegary. Next time, I'll try a different brand, or I'll marinate my own. I served it with the Mediterranean Chickpea Salad I from this site and it was a perfect combination.

This was good and I like all the ingredients individually, but this is probably a 5 star recipe for those who prefer oil and vinegar recipes.  I prefer something a little less tangy and that is the only reason I gave it only 4 stars.

it could have used a bit more zing other than relying solely on the artichoke marinade, but the concept is good and always a plus for another way to prepare spinach!

Personally, I LOVED this salad.  Others I made it for weren't crazy about the feta or the amount of artichokes though.

Delicious! I love marinated artichokes and this was so easy to make. I warmed the artichoke hearts separately in a pan. I cooked yellow onion and garlic in the marinade from the artichoke in a big pot, then threw the spinach in to wilt it for just a few minutes. I left out the feta and it was still very tasty. It went nicely with the lentil, wild rice, and portobello dish I made.

I used fresh artichoke,but I didn't have italin dressing so I just went with Dash garlic pepper, fresh lemon juice and a lil' olive oil drizzled on top, I also added sweet fire roasted red pepper, and mozzarella because I don't care for feta. We ate with trisquit crackers and it was wonderful.

Kind of plain, I think it needed something crunchy to balance out the flavor.  May try again, but with pecans perhaps
