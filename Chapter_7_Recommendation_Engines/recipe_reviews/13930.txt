This is the best recipe I've found on this site!!!  I am orginally Syrian, so we are always making traditional hummus and when I decided to make this, my family was really skeptical.  Everything changed when they tasted it and my mom single-handedly ate almost the whole recipe!!
(this tastes more flavorful if you double the amount of the spices)

I made this hummus with black beans at first and it turned out good.  However, when I substituted black beans with garbanzo beans - it turned out even better!  You will need to use more liquid with garbanzo beans, though.

Very good hummus, but very different from the classic garbanzo bean variety.  My brother and I took this on our cross-country trip and ate some every day for 5 days straight and didn't get tired of it!  

The key to getting that hummus taste out of the black bean is the tahini.  If you don't use tahini, you may as well just have some refried beans from your local Mexican restaurant.

This is also an easy recipe to vary with other ingredients.  Just remember that if you're going to add different spices, use fresh ones!  There is no substitute!

Wonderful!  Just as easy to make as standard hummus and probably even tastier.  The liquid from canned beans gives me digestion difficulties so I rinsed the beans and added olive oil and water instead.  I recommend a little oil to help pull the flavors together.  Lovely with hot pita bread or cold vegetable sticks.

I substituted peanut butter (yes, you read that right) for the tahini, because that's what I had in my cupboard, and it was so good my 5 children ate it all up in one afternoon.  The texture was good, the flavor was excellent. The PB is not discernible, and for me, going to the effort of driving an hour to purchase tahini defeats the whole purpose of making such a delicious dish with most ingredients available at all times in my refrigerator and pantry. We toasted tortilla triangles and cut pitas into wedges and broiled them crips. DELISH. Thank you!!

WOW!!  This is great, and SO simple!  For an extra kick, substitute 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice with lime juice.  Fabulous!

I eat this almost every day, but I do make the following changes:

3 cloves fresh garlic.
3 TBSP lemon juice.
1 tsp cumin (maybe a dash more).
Reduce black bean liquid to 1 TBSP.
Reduce tahini to 1 TBSP.
HOT PEPPER FLAKES, and a lot of them! I do about a teaspoon!

Put garlic cloves in the food processor (I have a Ninja) and mince them first. Add everything else in and blend to desired consistency. 

I eat this primarily with bagel chips.  I also eat too much of this to bother with the olives and the paprika. 

I have noticed good improvement in my cholesterol levels and I attribute it to this hummus! It's my "go-to snack."

This is very good.  Has a bit of a kick, probably due to the paprika and the cayenne.  I am making pita bread to go with it, and it's not done, so I just tested it with a spoon.  It will be wonderful with pita.  It is a bit like a black bean dip, but a little different.  I made my own tahini for this, and I can't taste it that much.  All the better; I am not a big fan of tahini.  I'm a little puzzled by the complaints that it isn't pretty.  It's not beautiful, I agree, but if you garnish it correctly it looks fun and the purple color isn't bad.  I've certainly made food that looks a lot less appetizing!  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it.  Great change from traditional hummus.  I added a little more cayenne (we like it hot).  I will make this many, many more times.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This hummus is a little runnier than traditional hummus.  I think next time i'll try it with more lemon juice and cayenne to give it more of a kick.

Made this recipe using 3 large cloves of ROASTED garlic, 1/2 tsp cayenne and calamata olives mixed right in.  I also added a half of a roasted red bell pepper. It was delicious and had a little more kick to it.  No need to do anything by hand except remove the pits from the olives.  Very yummy and satisfying with pita chips.

Didn't care for this at all, maybe I'm not a hummus person, but it was so bland! It is far easier to whip up the onion soup mix/sour cream dip and just use fat free sour cream to be healthier.

Great recipe, all made with stuff I always have in my fridge/pantry.  I used this as a base for a veggie wrap, added some sliced Kumatos (brown tomatoes), red onion and arugula, rolled up my Trader Joes Lavash wrap and enjoyed!  It even impressed my non veggie friends!

This is definitely the best hummus recipes I've ever tried. I usually use dried beans that I cook first (I don't eat meat, so I make giant batches of beans on the weekend and use it throughout the week). If you are using dried beans, then 1 can = 1.5 cups of beans. Even when I do used canned beans, I drain and rinse them to lower the sodium content. Then, I add 1/4 cup of water to thin it a bit. I also half the salt and it still tastes great. This hummus goes really well with Crunchmaster 5-seed crackers that you can buy from Costco. I make this weekly (doubled) and bring portions to school (I'm a teacher) as an afternoon snack. Full of protein and fiber, great for vegetarians! My husband also is in love with this because of the spiciness, which you can easily adjust to suit your own taste.

I would give this recipe ten stars if I could!!  It's amazing!  I whipped it up as a last minute extra appetizer for Christmas day, and my guests inhaled it; even my 4-year old loved it.  Served it with tortilla strip chips (didn't have any pita bread) and it was perfect.  Added a bit more lemon juice because I like my hummus very lemony, and I drizzled a little olive oil into the food processor while it was mixing.  This will be one of my regular appetizers from now on.

I made this for dinner last night, and served it with pita bread and celery sticks. My boyfriend actually said it's better than regular chickpea based hummus! I added 3 cloves of garlic, but roasted them first and it tasted delicious! Also make sure you mix just the tahini and spices ahead of time with a little bit of water in the food processor before adding the beans. The tahini and water should become thick and almost buttery in consistency, add water until you get a smooth mix.  Then after add the beans :)

This was a delicious alternative to chick peas.  I love black beans and this recipe is so easy!  I didn't have any tahini but a little Mayo or Miracle whip will give it that creamy flavor.

wonderful!!  so easy to whip up for a snack or an appetizer for a potluck.  i doubled the recipe by using one can of black beans and one can of garbanzo beans, used several tablespoons of the garbanzo bean liquid to smooth out the consistency, and added more lemon juice plus a few more garlic cloves for flavor.  also chopped up some cucumber and tomatoes with fresh parsley to top it off...just like our local middle-eastern restaurant.  everyone loved it and i ran out of pita!

I made some changes (out of necessity of what I had), but for my first time making hummus, this still turned out great & I expect the next batch to be even better!

Changes: 1 can black beans, 1 of garbanzo. I didn't have tahini so I ground up some sesame seeds using a mortal/pestle and added a bit of olive oil to make about 1.5 tlbs "tahini paste". I roasted a garlic and used probably about 5-6 cloves. I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I used ground red pepper. I also didn't have a food processor, so I had to mash by hand/electric mixer! It took a little longer and came out a little chunkier than ideal, but that's my own fault for not owning a food processor. :)

This made about 3 cups or so of hummus. I put some in the fridge for now and some in a ziploc in the freezer for later.

Next time I will make my life easier and go buy some tahini and if I don't have a food processor by then, I will probably cook the beans a bit to make them softer and easier to mash.

Overall though - this is a great recipe! Thanks!

What a great recipe:)  I made a few changes that made this the best hummus I ever had (my family thinks so too).  It tastes wonderful with either black beans or the traditional chick peas.  I reduce the amount of tahini to 1 Tbs. (we don't like a strong tahini taste - too bitter).  I also increase the amount of beans I use to almost 2 cans worth (I use dry beans).  I use water instead of bean liquid and omit the cumin. I really like the flavor without cumin so I decided not to add it.  The last ingredient I add is 1/2c. of sour cream.  This gives it a little bit of a creamy texture and gives it a perfect finish.  I think this is the secret ingredient for hummus.  Yum!

This is a great black bean hummus. Very flavorful and easy to whip up in the food processor. I thinkg this also would make a good filling for quesadillas (cooked with pepper jack or cheddar) or as the base for a tex-mex layer dip (with sour cream, guacamole, chopped tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, etc.)

Great recipe. It's a nice change from the tradiditional garbonzo bean hummus. I made few changes: substituted lime juiice for the lemon,  and didn't use the black bean juice, but added 2 tablespoons of EVOO to make it smooth. I also added 1 bulb of roasted galric,, and 1/4 cup of cilantro to the mixture before putting it in the food processor.

This is amazing!  I made it this past weekend and my whole family loved it.  It was a bit salty after adding the reserved liquid, so I omitted the additional salt.  I finished the hummus by mixing in about 2 tsp olive oil for taste and texture after spooning the hummus into a serving dish.  Yum!

I was rushed when I was trying to make this so I didnt want to open my jar of greek olives and chop them up for a garnish but man oh man this was good! My husband hates hummus and after talking to him like I do our children when I want them to just try a bite, he finally did and he took another and another and another...enough said, it's a keeper!

Great recipe although I did make some changes.  It is staple in my ktchen now, we make it a couple of times a week.  I substituted lime juice for the lemon, much better flavor and used water to reduce the thickness rather than the bean juice from the can.  I also added extra garlic and cayenne pepper as that we like it spicy.

This is so yummy!  Tastes more like a bean dip than a hummus, but tasty and nutritious none the less.  This is a keeper! Very easy too.

This was very good, and a nice change from regular hummus.   A bonus was that I had all of the ingredients except the tahini, so I just added a little olive oil and juice from the olives to get the consistency I wanted.  I also threw the olives and paprika in the food processor rather than used as garnish.  Even my meat and potatoes loving husband liked it.  Thanks for a quick and delicious lunch idea!  I will definitely make again.

I made this to share with a friend.  She loves humus.  I love black bean dips.  We both thought this was excellent.  I live in a rural area, and didn't have access to tahini.  I found (on another website) a suggestion to substitute natural peanut butter.  The flavors worked well.  I will be making this again.  Thanks.

We love making hummus without garbanzo beans!  This is very tasty, and the ingredient amounts easily adjusted to your taste.  We've made this several times already this week!

I hate chickpeas, so this was a wonderful alternative.  I didn't have tahini so I just ground up sesame seeds and used that in it's place.

I made this with lime instead of lemon and smoked paprika, and it was good, but I wanted it a little more kicked up, so I a dollop of mustard, 1 tbsp cilantro, a dash of jalapeño hot sauce, and a tablespoon of olive oil.  Perfect consistency for my bf (who prefers his hummus thin).

This is very tasty hummus.  I did have a problem with it being too stiff (which may be due to the fact that I don't have a great quality food processor--I was trying to do mine in a blender, then I eventually had to move the mixture over to a mini-food processor).  Anyway, I had to add quite a bit more bean liquid and lemon juice.  I also left out the cayenne (little mouths here) and subbed in two minced garlic cloves, instead of one.  I think that made all the difference!  Great recipe, Jen.

Fabulous! I used three cloves of garlic and ground chipotle pepper in place of the cayenne pepper. The chipotle pepper gave it a delicious smokey flavor. Wonderful, simple recipe. 

Update: I have since made it exactly as posted, and I must say, the proportions are dead on. Nothing needed tweaking.

ZZZOMG! No more hum-drum-mus in this house. Great stuff. I used a blender, and didn't add the extra cumin or cayenne (just 1/2 tsp and 1/8 tsp).

a good alternative for a different flavor or if you don't have any garbanzo beans around but i didn't think it was anything special.

I doubled the recipe and substituted lime juice for lemon juice and olive oil for the bean liquid due to personal taste and what I had on hand.  It turned out great, with a smooth texture that wasn't runny.  It was good with tostadas.  Next time, I will add more garlic, but this one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The best hummus I have ever had!  Followed the recipe exactly (except I just dumped the whole can of beans in w/the juice).  Excellent on a cucumber, tomato wheat thin sandwich!

I always love a new spin on hummus!  This was great!  I used soaked/cooked raw beans rather than canned because that's what I have around.  Instead of the reserved fluid I used about 1Tbs water and 1 Tbs olive oil.  I didn't read the directions well and blended the olives into the hummus- really great!  It was just a tad spicy for my taste, but I don't care for spice at all.  Will be making again with less cayenne pepper.

Love the black bean hummus! Great even without some of the ingredients listed on here.  What I did: 

1 Can black beans, 2 cloves garlic, cumin & paprkika (about a teaspoon each), salt and pepper to taste, and enough olive oil that it would blend smooth.

Tahini is too expensive, so i omitted, and i forgot about the lemon and remembered after I already put it away-- but it was still great. Instead of the olives (i didn't have greek) I used about 2 teaspoons of olive juice from a jar of green olives I had in the fridge. 

This is going to be my new go-to snack.

Thanks so much for this recipe!  We've made it 3 times in the past two weeks.  The only change was to drain and rinse the black beans and use chicken broth instead.  I think the reviews said to use a 1/4 cup of broth but I messed up and only used 2 T and it was perfect so that is how we make it now.  Very economical and easy!

This is very easy to make and has excellent flavor.  I definitely think it is better the day after it is made and the flavors have time to meld.  If you like a bite, be generous with the cayenne.

I don't think we will ever buy store bought hummus again!  This Black Bean Hummus is soooo good and full of flavor.  I will be making this again and again.  Definately double this recipe when you make it because it will go fast!  Followed the recipe exactly but I did double all the ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love hummus and wanted to make it at home because it's so expensive from the store. My boyfriend is allergic to chickpeas (legumes) so this recipe seemed like a great option. It tastes fantastic! The tahini is, like someone else said, crucial; you can make your own by toasting sesame seeds for a few minutes and then pureeing them with olive oil.

It's a good dip but I don't know that I'd call it hummus. I'd make it again but serve it with tortilla chips instead of pita bread.

I needed something quick and I had black beans so I picked this recipe.  Alas, seems I had little else.  So, here's the way I changed it up.  I didn't have any lemon juice (used lime), tahini paste (used toasted sesame seed oil), or greek olives.  I did, however, have some mission fig, kalamata olive tapenade, so I threw in a couple of big spoonfuls of that.  IT WAS FANTASTIC! - I added another big dollop of the tapenade on top for a garnish and sprinkled the paprika.  I don't know what hummus is supposed to taste like, I've never had it.  But if this is anything near to the real deal - then I didn't do too badly.

Although I think the recipe is a very good one, after trying it, I realize that I prefer hummus with chickpeas. I added caramelized onions, an extra clove of garlic, oil, extra tahini and extra lemon juice, and I used smoked paprika. It was delicious, but I missed the chickpeas.

Very good as "base" or other additions!  I read several on the web and this seems like the "base" ingredients for all of them. I also substituted the reserved bean juice with olive oil and the lemon juice with lime.  Rave reviews from DH. Next time I may add some jalapenos just too keep it interesting!

Wow, I actually followed the recipe pretty much exactly!  The only variation I made was to only use 1/8 tsp cayenne (I'm a spice wimp) and to omit the olives since I'll be using this as sandwich filler.  This was simple and fabulous, and I will make this many, many times.    This may help some people:  mine made 1 1/4 cups of hummus, which translates to 1 Weight Watchers point per 2 T serving (58 calories, 2.3 fiber, 1.7 fat, according to the ingredients I used).  Thanks for this simple and tasty recipe!

Fantastic recipe.  It is fast and easy.  It tastes better than it looks!  I took the advice of a Arab friend's mother and warmed the beans in its own liquid before I started. The fresh garlic and the tahini are the keys to the recipe; however, I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1.  I also topped it with extra virgin olive oil.  I will make this again.

Love it!  I skipped the lemon juice and cayenne as a personal preference and to make it toddler-friendly and it turned out fabulous.  I'll confess to using just a spoon and not wasting time with chips or pita.

Delicious! I did some minor doctoring, but not much. I too substituted olive oil for the bean liquid, and I added a little lime juice and sour cream (Just a little bit, though - too much makes it too runny!!). I like the variation from regular hummus, and I also liked all the flavor! No bland hummus here!! Thanks for a great recipe.

Tastes great, but next time I'll leave out the reserved bean juice, as it was just a tad too watery.  Overall, though, this was a delicious recipe, and a great diversion from traditional hummus.  (I actually made it because I was out of chick peas...  Glad I was!)

Very good and different hummus. A hit at the potluck dinner I took it to. It won't replace the "real thing", but it is a tasty alternative.

Delicious!!! I made three hummus recipes this week and this one, by far, is my favorite!!! I doubled it (because I obviously really like hummus) and am really glad I did! I substituted peanut butter for tahini (as suggested by another reviewer), and used water instead of reserved liquid, otherwise I followed the directions exactly. I expected a Mexican- flavor, but it wasn't that ... just mildly spicy, rich flavor.  VERY VERY GOOD!!

Really great change-up from hummus, which is a staple at my house.  Made it for a girl gathering and was quite a hit.  I did not change anything but did not measure too carefully so may have had more cumin, garlic and cayenne, but was too delicious with veggies and multigrain chips.

This tastes much better than I thought it would! Thank you for helping me use up some homemade black beans. I also used lime juice, not lemon, because that's what I had on hand. And I used the recipe from AR and made homemade tahini for this. Turned out yummy!

I accidentally used a 19 ounce can instead of 15. I also didn't use Tahini and used a teaspoon of sesame oil instead. That is how I do it with hummus. However I added the 2 tablespoons lemon juice and liquid and it was sooo runny! I have to call this a black bean dip and not hummus. Even using a bigger can made it this runny. Other than that I found it too lemony as well so had to add some extra salt and sugar to even it out. Perhaps the tahini would have thickened it but I would recommend that you don't add any liquid until it's blended and see if you need it first.

Great recipe.  I used roasted garlic instead and added some roasted red peppers.  I also replaced some of the tahini (expensive but good and authentic) with natural peanut butter. Liked the suggested spices and proportion.

Yummy, and a great snack spread on veggies, crackers, etc. Did not have Greek olives so subbed Spanish manzanilla olives needing to be used, and that worked fine. Used a Vitamix blender to process the ingredients. Otherwise, made exactly as written. This was surprisingly a bit hotter than expected although fine for us . . . for those more sensitive to ‘heat’, you may want to first try 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper as more can be added if necessary. We will make this again!

I enjoy this easy to make and delicious hummus. I "up" the seasonings a bit and use olive oil instead of the reserved liquid from the beans. I like to rinse canned beans well, just my preference. It got even better after it sat and chilled for a few hours. This is now my "go-to" hummus recipe and I make it often. Keeps well in fridge for several days which makes it ideal to have on hand for healthy snacking. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

Fantastic and super easy.  I do recommend doubling the recipe if you are taking it to a party.  I took the recommendation of another reviewer to toss in some lime juice as well.  This will definitely be my "go to" appetizer of choice for a while!

I was really disappointed after reading all the rave reviews. I thought it was way too salty! Next time I will use soaked black beans as opposed to the canned.

I hate black beans.  Loathe them.  So, to say I loved this recipe means something.  This is absolutely awesome with a little added cayenne and a little added lemon....I also finely, finely chopped the olives and sprinkled them on top before serving.  Love this recipe.

I used dry black beans for less sodium. It takes longer to cook, but it was worth the extra effort. I also added a 14oz can of chickpeas (partially drained) and a 1/4 cup of cilantro. Love the cayenne in this recipe!

This recipe is super tasty.  I added some fresh cilantro and used it for a veggie dip.  It would be great with pita chips.

Very good...make sure to rinse off beans with water before adding...otherwise a little too salty.

Great! Based on suggestions, I used 1 teaspoon peanut butter instead of the tahini.  I used the juice of a whole lemon and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. Will be even better overnight after all the flavors blend together.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I've used it soooo many times and have had nothing but rave reviews from anyone that tries it! 

In addition to what's listed, I also add about 1/2 tablespoon chopped jalapeno, 1/4 cup of low-sodium chicken broth (instead of the reserved black bean liquid) and rinse the beans before adding to the blender.

Enjoy this one - your guests will thank you!

excellent recipe! I eat a lot of hummus and normally I make the traditional garbanzo bean kind. I wanted to try this one out because my little brother is allergic to garbanzo beans and I wanted him to be able to enjoy the wraps I was making for lunch.  The only change I made to the recipe was to leave out the liquid from the canned beans (never liked it) and use about 1/2 tbsp. of olive oil instead.  I love the flavor of this hummus and my brother has been dipping pita bread into it all day :) Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I followed the directions except for the olives. The texture was very loose and didn't thicken. The taste was just so-so. I thought it was just me, but a friend of mine who is one of my "test dummies" for food, also said that it didn't taste bad, but it lacked something and the texture was way off.  Thanks for the recipe.  I at first gave this recipe 3 stars but ended up giving it four stars because of ease of preparation and easily found ingredients.

I've made this hummus countless times and it is a hit with everyone who eats it.  I use two cans of black beans, a touch more lemon juice than called for, and then add garlic powder, tahini, cumin, paprika, and cayenne to taste--some days we want spicy, some days we want more cumin.  It is extremely versatile.  I serve it with sliced avocados, sliced peppers, carrots, blue tortilla chips, and/or pita chips.  It is a great complement to both burgers and Mexican fare.  I even had a bride ask to have it at her bachelorette party!

This recipe is AWESOME! I am not a fan of black beans, but over vacation last week, I had some wonderful black bean hummus. Now that I'm home, I decided to make some. This recipe is just as good. I cannot wait to share it with my family! Yum!!!

Makes a fantastic black bean hummus.  Far better than what I had previously bought in the store.  I didn't measure out spices, but used more rather than less and threw in some red pepper flakes as well.  Used 2 tbsp sesame oil and a 1 tbsp olive oil in place of tahini.  For the lemon juice I squeezed a single lemon.

This was my first attempt at making my own hummus.  Everyone tells me I won't buy store bought once I try homemade.  I'm glad I picked this one first, with it being so flavorful and all. The others sound like you need to tweak them.  This was wonderful just the way it's stated.

Great recipe, and the color is beautiful. The taste reminds me somewhat of refried beans, but the tahini adds an interesting depth. I ate it with tortilla chips, and it would have been great with just a tiny bit of sour cream.

Very tasty.  I made this as directed, except that I cut back on the cayenne (probably used 1/8 tsp.) because I was serving this to guests, and I left out the olives as I don't care for them.  This makes a healthy, filling snack

Excellent! Very easy. First time I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out too liquid - tasty, but too runny. Second time I didn't add the bean liquid and it's PERFECT!  This one is a KEEPER!  I will make it again and again and again.

Took this to a family function....and got comments about it looking like chocolate mousse, baby food, etc.  HOWEVER, the taste is awesome, and we couldn't stop eating it!  ;-)  Good source of lean protein.  Will make again!!

This is so yummy!  I found it a little too thin for my taste, so next time I would leave out the 2 TBSP of bean liquid.  The only other things I changed were that I doubled the cayenne because I like spicy food and I added a little extra lemon juice.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I am a big fan of regular chick pea hummus and make it all the time.  I tried this one since I did not have chick peas in the house, and it was just okay.  I think I'll stick to the chick pea variety!

I gave this four stars - it's a good recipe, pretty good tasting and easy to make.  I served it at a party last night and everyone felt it was missing something.  If I were to make it again, I think I might toss some sun-dried tomatoes in there.  Still, a good recipe.  Thanks!

Try not to cut your tongue as you lick the stuff off your blender blades!

I put the paprika in with everything else, because sometimes I don't read directions very well.....

My family really liked this recipe! I made a regular hummus as well, and compared to this recipe, the other hummus seemed very bland. This one has a nice "kick" to it because of the cayenne pepper. (I added 1/4 tsp). Very good!

This is very unlike chickpea hummus, but still really good.   I didn't end up using the can juice, but instead added olive oil (important in hummus) and extra lemon juice (I like it lemony).  I also increased the tahini by about a tablespoon because I couldn't taste it at first.  It tastes like a Mexican version of hummus, and I like the consistency as the black beans stayed somewhat chunky after throughly processing.  I only SLIGHTLY like the traditional chickpea hummus better, but this one is definitely a very good change.

I've been making this for 2 years exactly as the recipe says.  It has a great taste, and a slow warmth after you eat it.  You can't go wrong with it.

Very good - not very pretty. Kinda turns out a strange gray/purple color. Served with pita chips and veggies. 

I think next time I would double the garlic and spices. I also would add more olives. But still good as is!

Fabulous!  I doubled the recipe, using 1 can of chickpeaks (peeled) and 1 can of black beans.  Thank you for the recipe!

Absolutely fabulous and healthy. I always put in a little more red pepper for kick but even kids like this stuff! Great consistancy too! My friend even tried it with white beans and it turned out great.

It was good, but it tasted like refried beans with a little tahini added.  It's definitely not the hummus I expected.

This was absolutely delicious and so easy. Following other reviewers' suggestions, I lightly rinsed the beans and used only 1 tb of the bean liquid for a thicker consistency. At the request of my boyfriend, this will become a staple for our weekly get-together with friends. It's perfect on a toasted pita—for a little something extra, try topping the pita and hummus with the Mexican Cucumber Salad from this site.

My hummus was way too soupy.  I added a roasted red pepper but I wouldn't think that would make it soupy.  Adding the drained liquid from the can of beans made them particularly memorable for my family even after I ate them, if you know what I mean.  If I make this again I will drain and rinse the beans and not add the liquid from the can.

Excellent!  I can't take this anywhere without people asking me for the recipe.  I like the fact that it's lower in fat than traditional hummus (no oil) and it's loaded with fiber, especially when served with quartered whole wheat mini pitas.  I generally use less tahini and will often forget to buy lemons, so I can attest that it's good without the lemon juice!  Thanks for the recipe!

Two Thumbs Up!  I made this with chickpeas and it was delicious.  My husband, who has never liked hummus, liked the spicy kick it had.  It was so quick and easy to make.  My 3-yr-old was able to help put everything in the blender and blend it together.  Hubby says he can't wait to try it with the black beans, he says he is sure he will like that even more.  My daughter liked it but it was a bit too spicy for her taste.

I'm just starting the transition to a Vegan way of eating and worried that it would be difficult to adjust (especially since I am new to cooking).  Not so with recipes like this!  This is the first Vegan recipe I tried (followed recipe *exactly*) and I was thrilled that something so easy to prepare was also nutritious, and really quite delicious.  I spread it on toasted whole wheat pita and savored every bite with accompanying "oooohs" and "ummmms".  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

this was really good.. i doubled the garlic and cumin as suggested by RALWATTAR.. but cut the cayenne in half (not wanting it to be overly spicy) i added olive oil in place of the canned liquid like AWO and also left out the tahini.. didn't garnish with olives and added the paprika (doubled) along with the other spices.. we enjoyed this with sliced cucumber, baby carrots, and tortilla chips.. bf says he likes this version better than the chickpea one.. i agree.. ty for the recipe

I was looking to make use of the black beans in the pantry.  I made the recipe as stated with one exception; I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 (I love garlic)  and it's fantastic.  I have paprika from Hungary that gave it a nice kick.

Thank you for this recipe!  I tweeked it a little using lime instead of lemon, upped the cayenne to 1/2 tsp., 5 cloves of garlic and threw the olives right in the food processor. I do not like tahini, so I used olive oil instead.  Served with pita chips.

This was super easy to make and super yummy to eat.  Even my son-in-law (who does not like hummus) liked it!

Another great recipe on this website that I have made several times and received compliments from other people on. Important that you have food processor for this though as when I first made it, didn't have one & didn't turn out quite as good. It was good enough though for me to get a food processor & its been 5 stars ever since.

I made this recipe with black beans which is good and then with
chickpeas which was even better. I added an extra clove of garlic ,olive oil and roasted red peppers. The best hummus and I will
Be making my own hummus instead of store bought.

Great recipe!  A nice change from the traditional garbanzo bean hummus (which I also love).  I added a few extra garlic cloves in, as I do with most recipes.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

I have never cared for hummus however while we were on a Daniel Fast I made this recipe for my husband - well I sing this recipe's praises!!! We love it!! I've even got my adult children, their spouses and my grandchildren eating this wonderful and healthy dish. Sometimes I add more garlic and I always add a tablespoon of fresh lime juice.  It's great!

After the can-can sale at our grocery store last year, I had an abundance of black beans and corn, as my husband went shopping with my then-vegetarian daughter.  Well, months later she is not a vegetarian and though we've used a lot of corn in chowder, we have an abundance of black beans left.  I have GOT to use all these beans.  I did a black bean search without corn, and this came up ... and I am SO glad it did!  We love hummus in our house, and my husband is a big snacker, so this was perfect.  It should keep him happy for a while, and is pretty inexpensive to make - which I LOVE.  I have visions of needing to pick up more tahini, though.  THANKS for this recipe ... went over big right away!

This is great, exactly what I was looking for.  I used 2 cups of black beans I cooked myself instead of canned.  I would highly recommend NOT adding the salt if you are using canned beans.  The salt from the olives is plenty.  We will use this as a dip, sandwich spread and a filling for enchiladas--this is so versatile.  Thank you for the recipe!

Huge hit at the bbq I just made this for! I only had kalamata olives, so I cut it down to 5, which was perfect. All else - perfect. I think I may have added a little extra cumin because I really like the flavor of it. I made homemade pita bread to dip in this, and cut it up into small bite-size pieces - yum!

This was great! I doubled the spices and garlic, and I cooked the beans for 20 mins. the 2nd time I made it. Definitely better cooked b/c it eliminated the hard pieces.

I didn't enjoy this recipe. It was way to salty and not enough cayenne for my tastes. You would be better of just adding your own mixture of ingredients and season to your liking.

I have made this on a couple of occasions and each time everyone raved and raved about how delicious it was!  I put it out as an appetizer and it was gone before dinner.  I make it using my rocket blender and it is super easy to make.  Definitely a dish that has excellent results, especially compared to its difficulty level.

This needed a LOT more tahini. I made my own tahini using black sesame seeds (had a big bag on hand) and it needed about 1/3c. Extra fresh lemon jce, cumin, freshly grd black pepper and a pinch of sugar did the trick. I loved it, once I added more seasoning and extra sesame paste. I can't imagine substituting mayo for it, but as another reviewer stated, peanut butter works just fine if you don't have tahini or sesame seed. Oh, and as for how it looks: it is kind of liver-colored. But if you season it to taste, sprinkle it with some fresh parsley and sesame seed (any color), serve it with chips or pita, it will be gone in a heartbeat.

Make this recipe all of the time, because I love black beans (and cumin).  I now make some changes.  As with many reviewers, I like lime juice better than lemon.  But I usually start by chopping up cilantro, and then add a jalapeno or red pepper, and maybe a couple of sundried tomatoes.  A couple of splashes of hot sauce always adds some tang.  Oh, and I substitute seasoned salt for salt.  As with regular hummus, it's fun to play around.

This was a last minute addition to my menu because at the last minute I realized I had no chickpeas for roasted red pepper hummus.  Sometimes when that happens you end up with a winner, and that's what this is! Only change was to double the cumin, and to not use the liquid from the can but rather add a bit of oil and a little more lemon juice.  Nice twist on regular hummus! Thanks, Jen!

Love Love Love this! Good spice and flavor just the way it is. The only thing I changed is that I didn't have Tahini and substituted it for a teaspoon of peanut butter and a 5-6 drops of sesame oil. However, I thought the taste was good prior to making this substitution and could have gone without. The peanut butter added more of the traditional hummus taste. I served this with whole wheat flour tortillas cut into triangles.

Wow this was so good. I did add more garlic, cumin for my taste. Didn't have olives but topped with chopped red roasted peppers and fresh Cilantro. I might try putting some chopped jalapeno in next time.

Excellent and easy recipe.  This will be a mainstay recipe for me.  I only added more lime juice for more tanginess (which I like), but the recipe is good just as it is.

Absolutely delicious! I served it with vegetable root chips, and it was a match made in heaven! My only slight modification: I've made it twice, once accidentally blending the paprika garnish in the dip, and it was fantastic. From now on, I will always blend the paprika right into the dip.

This is a great hummus. Quick and easy. I made it for my husband for a quick snack when he came home from work and i literally had to pull the bowl out of his hands so he wouldn't spoil his appetite for dinner. He said it is the best hummus he has ever had and I agree.

My kids LOVE this!  No more junky msg and perservative filled bean dip for us!  Thank you so much!  I put this out before dinner one night on a taco night and they devoured it.  They dipped with blue corn chips.  The only thing I changed was 1/8 tsp cayenne to test, but next time will use the full 1/4 tsp amount.  This will def be my next potluck bring.

Quite tasty. I added a lot more chopped olives in (green and black). It didn't look like the photo though it was much darker and more liquid. Probably used the wrong type of beans :|

This is the best hummus recipe! I make it about once a week. I skip the olives and cayenne to make it more appealing to kids. And I even skip the tahini (allergies) and add olive oil instead. Turns out great, and it's one of our family favorites.

Another great alternative is to use both black beans AND the garbanzo beans.  You would definitely need to adjust your spices -- to your taste of course!

I was really excited to try this but it was too bland for me.  I added 1/2 a small can of diced jalapenos and that gave it some flavor but overall I have had much better hummus.

The guys loved it. The spices gave it a nice kick but keep in mind that it is not traditional hummus and will always have a black bean taste to hit so for me i kept thinking it would be best served in a tortilla with cheese.

I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this recipe turned out. I would even go as far as to say that it's better with black beans then garbanzo beans.  I didn't change anything, it's perfect as written.

I love this! Its better than the traditional chickpea hummus...not to mention healthier with no oils in it besides the tahini paste.  I spread some hummus on a spinach tortilla, threw some spinach, olives and sundried tomatoes in it, and had a delicious mediterranean wrap for lunch!

Very good recipe.  Definitely needs more than 1 clove of garlic, though.  We used 3 but we like garlic.  2 would probably be good.  More lemon juice, too!  Also, in reference to an earlier review:  hummus with garbanzo beans is just plain hummus ...

Very good!  I made pretty much as written, except I didn't have tahini so I used raw sesame seeds and threw them in the food processor.  Also, I blended in all the spices and the olives instead of using them for garnish.  As silly as it sounds, I was leery of the lemon juice because I don't like lemons, but of course the dip didn't taste lemony at all in the end.  I would make this again, maybe doubling the olives.

Very good! I was simply making it for my own home, and enjoyed it with wheat bread, pretzels, and sometimes chips.

My favorite hummus recipe.  My friends request this all the time.  It doesn't look appetizing, but once you get them to try it, they'll love it.

Delicious dip, and actually I thought it was pretty served in a dip bowl and sprinkled with the olives.  I made exactly as written the first time, but it was very liquidy so I omitted the juice the second time.  Definitely a good change-up from standard dips!  Thanks!

I'm not a hummus lover in general because I'm not very fond of garbanzo beans. This was a nice alternative for us (my H is a garbanzo-hater, too - we were made for each other). I increased the garlic and the lemon and liked the flavor I ended up with. I tried to cuten it up a bit by molding it in a ramekin and using spicy green greek olives, but it's just a frankly ugly dip. It doesn't really matter though, cuz it goes pretty fast. :) Thanks!!

It's definitely not a hummus, but it's quite a good bean dip. However, be SURE to use real lemons or limes in this recipe; with my last batch I realized I had no limes around so I used RealLime instead, and it really takes down the quality of the recipe. Actual fresh-squeezed limes or lemons are really crucial.

I love hummus.  Unfortunately, I'm allergic to garbanzo beans and chick peas, so I was ecstatic to find this recipe.  And it is incredible!  My sister, a devout vegetarian and self-proclaimed hummus aficionado, loves this recipe.  She now makes it for every gathering.  And don't skip out on the olives; they bring it all together.

I made this recipe as a vegan alternative to the creamy vegetable dips being served at my brother's graduation party.  It was a huge hit, everyone loved it!  I'll be making it many more times, especially since it was so unbelievably simple.

Excellent source of protein and good oil for kids.I made this for myself and my daycare kids all asked for some. It doesn't look appealing, so I was surprised. I was even more surprised when it became a staple request - for breakfast! And snack. It is actually part of our regular breakfast menu, served with whole wheat bread for dipping. They LOVE it! I do too.

I wish I could give this more stars.  I am now a black bean convert!  I made as directed (but no cayenne), tasted, then added an extra Tbsp of tahini and an extra squeeze of lemon.  Simple, tangy, delish.  Thanks for the wonderful idea!

I thought this was a good recipe but it needed some things like more lemon juice,a little plain yogurt,mor cumin and a bit more spice for my taste. The yogurt help cover up the bitterness that black beans can have.good recipe

This doesn't taste like your everyday hummus, so I think of it more as a bean dip than a hummus.  Everyone loved this at Christmas and asked for the recipe.  I left out the cayenne; I think it is perfect without it but I'm also not a big fan of hot stuff.  You can play around with the recipe to make it taste just the way you like it, but the proportions are fine, although you may want to use just a little less tahini to be safe.  Definately try this!

I will use any excuse to make/eat something with black beans, and this is so good! I made it twice in one week! We ate it with blue tortilla chips and on sandwiches! I also subsitituted olive oil for the bean liquid and prefer lime to lemon in this. The tahini isn't necessary, so don't buy a whole jar, unless you'll really use it.

Quite good, although I found it a little bit salty, next time I won't add any salt. My 5 and 7 year old boys asked to have this with celery, carrot and capsicum sticks and now my 5 year old wants to take it to school for lunch tomorrow!  Wonder when he'll realise it's healthy....

This hummus is always a hit...I usually leave out the tahini (still delicious but extremely low fat) and add a little more garlic and lemon juice.  I rinse the beans out of the can and use maybe 1 tbsp of the reserved liquid - we like it thick.  I have served it with pita, crackers and tortilla chips to rave reviews.  Thanks Jen - it's addicting!

I got into black bean hummus because of a recipe at a local pub in town.  This recipe is right on, with one minor adjustment.  I strain and rinse my black beans prior to processing them, and I use less liquid from the beans.  That makes the consistency a little thicker and more like the one I wanted.  This is one I'll be sharing with all my friends.

I always add a little extra garlic than called for, that is just what my family likes. This is a WOW.  The cayenne pepper gives it just the right flavor.  Another reviewer gave this two stars because they used peanut butter instead of tahini. That was an unfair review as they are no EVEN alike. I had trouble finding tahini, is is usually in the organic section of your grocery store.  Well worth searching fot the tahini.  THANK YOU JEN! AWESOME.

Absolutely great!  Goes well on whole wheat crackers, and is really good mixed with ricotta cheese - maybe even on tortillas!  TMy roommates all loved this recipe.  I loved it because it is simple enough to be made without a food processor if you heat the beans and mash everything with a potatoe masher or pastry blender!

Couldn't find tahini so I substituted peanut butter & sesame oil like another reviewer suggested.  This was NOT a good idea.  I don't know if I used too much or what but the peanut butter gave it a really weird flavor.  It wasn't a hit at the party I took it to.  I might try again if I can ever find tahini.

I think the basic recipe is very nice. My only suggestions would be add a few more cloves of garlic and 1-1/2 tablespoons of olive oil.

Everyone loves it when I make this. The texture is not as heavy as hummus and I think that's a bonus.

This was a nice variation to chick peas but I think it needs a little more kick.  I added more of all the ingredients (except beans) as well as olive oil.  It was good.  Next time I'll add even more heat.

To me, this tasted like watered-down hummos. So why did I give this 5 stars, you ask? I also made it substituting chick peas for the black beans, and it was to die for! I used two cloves of garlic, which gave it a very strong garlic flavor. If you're looking for a thick hummos, I suggest using chick peas instead of black beans.

I had to leave out the olives because I didn't have any and wasn't going to the store.  It was still wonderful.  I would take this recipe over a hummus with garbanzos beans any day.

I have been making this recipe for two years now, and usually prepare it once a week! I always bring it to dinner parties, and my friends always request it. I omit the olives b/c i don't like them and add extra garlic. I also add double the black bean reserve to thin out the consistency so it doesn't overload my blender!

This is a wonderful alternative to traditional hummus.  I've also made it with about 1/2 & 1/2 black beans and garbanzos ('cause that's what I had).  It came out very good--thicker and with more heft.

I'll be honest...I started out looking for a black bean dip to accompany my fajita dinner when I came across this and decided to tweak this a bit to fit what I wanted.  I simply opened the can of beans, drained them then dumped them in the food processor, added a LARGE clove of garlic, cumin & salt and blended away. Then I nuked them in the microwave for about 3 minutes and stirred in about a 1/4th cup of salsa...It was just what I was looking for!  I love hummus too, so I can wait to try it as written.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I found this recipe to be quick and worth a try, but I will be careful to follow it more closely next time and use less tahini.  I also think there are not enough herbs in it and that a bit more cumin or something may have helped.I will probably make this again.

Excellent recipe!  I've made it several times already.  I've also changed out the black beans for garbanzos and added some green onion for extra flavor.  Couldn't be easier.

No more buying hummus in the deli for this family! I substituted the lemon juice with apple cider vinegar and it was wonderful. Tastes just as good made with chickpeas as another reviewer noted. Definitely will be making this one again and again! Thanks for a great recipe. :)

Outstanding--can't say enough about it! It's health, it's tasty, it's wonderful. I always make it for parties or to take to someone's house, and I'm constantly asked for the recipe. Luckily it's online so I can easily email it.

Wow!  This is a fabulous change from regular hummus, which I also love.  It had a great flavor and it was just absolutely delicious!  I think i will be making this often.  The only thing I changed was the lemon juice (I added more), but that was personal preferance.  Great recipe!

This dip was very well-received at a party I had recently.  Wonderful spices and very tasty.  The only negative was that it tasted a little too salty so I will reduce the salt the next time I make this.  Also added a few extra cloves of garlic and it was fantastic.

"This hummus is the biggest bomb ever", or so my 3 year old daughter says.  I have to agree, it has the best parts of traditional hummus and black bean dip.  I used Trader Joe's Cuban Black Beans which have some added flavor.  I love this stuff... chomp chomp... very easy to eat.

This was good.  It was much softer than hummus so it was more like black bean dip.  I did like it but it won't take the place of my regular hummus.

I thought this spread was delicious although I added more lemon and tahini for my taste. My business partner thought it it was much better than regular Hummus. I will make it again.

Yummy, yummy hummus. Incredibly easy to make. I took this to a cook out and everyone loved it. Even one of my highly carnivorous friends who started out asking, "What's a hummus?" was eating it up by the end of the night. I'll definitely make this again.

This hummus tasted good, but unfortunately looked so disgusting that noone wanted to try it.

This was a great hit at a potluck.  I made it because my husband doesn't like garbanzo beans but I'm not sure he even got any, it went so fast.  It was good with raw veggies too.  Thanks

Absolutely love this recipe. This was my 1st attempt ever of making hummus. I am Lacto-Ovo Vegetarian and love black beans, so I made this instead of the normal hummus made with garbonzo beans.
I actually found this recipe in a book called
'No Meat Athlete'...same recipe without the cayenne. Paprika & greek olives.
I have made thus this recipe both ways & always use the reserved liquid from the can of black beans.
Pretty much goes with anything. right now im eating it with Garden Vegetable Crackers

Fantastic hummus - and so easy to make. And lower fat that other hummus because it doesn't contain olive oil

In my hurry to make this recipe I missed the part about using olives and paprika to garnish it. I didn't have any Greek olives so I used black olives right in the mix with the hummus.  At this point I would suggest salting to taste because black olives are quite salty.  I also used half lime and half lemon juice as some other reviewers had suggested. My kids won't normally eat hummus but they gobbled this down and I made a double batch.  It was absolutely delicious. Keep in mind the season to taste bit because we used a little bit of extra cumin and paprika as well. This is definitely a keeper. It keeps the saturated fats down below what I'm allowed in my diet and has many other really good nutrients. It was so yummy too.

only things I did different were 1) did not read directions before making so put the olives in the food processor with everything else and 2) left out the cayenne and put black pepper.  It was good if a bit bland.  I will add the cayenne next time!   note - I really could not notice the olive taste even though they were blended in the dip.

This "Black Bean Hummus" had a nice creamy texture. The olive flavor was more pronounced with time.  Mine still tasted "fresh" after 10 days. I wouldn't hesitate to make it again. Thank you Jen for sharing your recipe.

Very good.  Very easy to change the ingredients to your taste.
I added a little Braggs Cider Vinegar and a small chipotle pepper for a little extra snap.
Served it with thin wheat crackers.  Was all gone in minutes.

Yummy.  Needed to take an appetizer to a pot luck and chose this.  I cooked my own black beans the day before.  Because some people don't like a lot of spice, I cut the cayenne pepper to 1/8th teaspoon.  After tasting I also upped the lemon juice a little...maybe another tablespoon and drizzled a little olive oil in.  Turned out great.  Will serve with pita chips and some cut up veggies.

Delicious.  I used chili powder instead of cayenne because it’s what I had.  I recommend making it just as directed, then you can adjust for a little more spice if you like, but it is excellent as is.

I've made this several times, leaving out the olives.  I like this recipe and use it often because it is simple.  I understand that without the olives or olive oil the consistency may be a little different than traditional hummus, but I like the lower oil content.

I brought this to a party and I got several compliments on it and questions about what was in it.  But more importantly, I LOVE IT too!

My family and I love this! We make it regularly, and bring it to get togethers. I get asked to make this by friends that don’t like garbanzo beans/chickpeas. Great stuff!

Was very good! I don't really care for chickpeas so this was a great alternative. Great flavor, this recipe is a keeper.

I added another can of black beans as this was a bit spicy. I also used peanut butter because I was out of tahini and used 3 minced garlic cloves and 1 tbsp olive oil. Turned out delicious  and better than store bought! Just added more beans due to the spice. Great recipe!

This was so good that I immediately made a second batch.  The only change I made the second time around is that I blended 6 Greek kalamata olives right into the hummus. Either way, it's a tasty and very healthy recipe.

Unlike a few other reviews, mine had too much liquid (and made in blender).  If I try again, I'll leave out the reserved liquid to get more of  humus texture.  Flavor was OK but think I'd kick it up a notch.

I really enjoyed this hummus! The addition of cumin gave it a nice flavor. I can see myself snacking with this on veggies and pita chips often.  Thank you!

This is good, but everyone's tastes are different.  I doubled the garlic, so that was perfect.  I'll cut the olives in half for next time, it tasted too "olivey". I actually got my picky wife to eat some...and she liked it!

Great as written! A bit better with a couple of tsps toasted sesame seed oil thrown in.  Tang it up a bit with a bit of malt vinegar, too.

I needed an appetizer to bring to a girlfriend gathering. This was quick and delicious! Everybody raved about it and appreciated that it was healthy (I served it with cut peppers, celery, carrots and Sandwich Thins cut in triangles). I didn't have Tahini, so I just used ground up toasted sesame seeds and robust OVOO and I added some extra garlic. I garnished it with chopped olives and chopped fresh chives. So good!

Instead of canned black beans I used dry beans prepared according to directions. My dip resulted in a beautiful lavender color, not what I expected but who cares! Since I didn't use canned beans I think it could use a little more salt. Otherwise this recipe rocks. I like spicy food so I will add more spice to taste. What a great way to get your fiber.

I had black bean hummus at Gloria Estefan's restaurant Bongos and it was delicious.   Tried this recipe and wow.... very good!   I did use two small garlic cloves and in this recipes a bit over powering. Next time I will stick to the recipe can't wait to try other hummus recipes now that I have a 16 oz bottle of tahini!!!

This was amazing! Everyone loved it and it was perfect for my picky 10 year old who needs to eat more protein and who doesn't like meat.  Make sure to use fresh garlic. Also I used Kalmata olives rather than green Greek olives which made for an interesting flavor. This will be a recipe I make often.

This recipe is AMAZING  !!!  I added some of the bean cooking liquid for smoothness, bumped up the spices and used 1/2 lime  1/2 lemon just cuz.  I also doubled the recipe, seeing how I made it once before and knew how delicious it was... next time I will make it in 2 batches as even my vitamix was working a little too hard...

This black bean hummus was so easy to make. We love it and will definitely make it again. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. The only thing I would change next time is 1/2 the salt if serving with chips. Perfect as is for dipping veggies! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

wow! Absolutely delicious! I have just started liking hummus and a friend at work said she wished she could try black bean hummus so I did a search and found this recipe. I can't wait to take this to work tomorrow; if I don't eat it all tonight!  I have some pico de gallo to enjoy with it.

Very yummy, one of the guests asked for the recipe. To me, tasted pretty much like standard hummus... But it was cool that I made it myself :) Maybe next time I'll add some more garlic since I like it a little zestier.

This was so ugly that I had to sell the idea of eating it to a group of people.  No one was attracted to GRAY food.  If I hadn't tasted it and known it was quite tasty,  I couldn't have eaten it, either.  One family member loved it and ate most of it, but everyone else eyed it suspiciously and left it alone.

We made a double batch for a potluck and served it with pita type bread, dolmas, dates, and olives.  I skipped the salt, but with the double batch, I think using the amount of salt for one batch may have given it a little more oomph.

I just made this and it was amazing.  I did not have Greek olives so I used 5 black olives and 5 regular olives and just added to mix.  Did not drain beans.  Perfect consistency.

I love black beans and love hummus, so what's not to like? This is delicious, tasty, and healthy. I do agree that it might just taste like a black bean dip if you don't put enough lemon juice in. I feel like the tahini is an important ingredient also, so I didn't skimp there. I agree that doubling the amount of spices makes for a more flavorful dish.  I love it with Trader Joe's Bite Size Everything Crackers. I'll surely be making this numerous times!

Left out the Greek olives because I don't like them.  Next time I will probably  cut the amount of cayenne in half as it is a bit spicy.  Other than that, it is DELICIOUS!!!

made as the recipe stated and really wasn't my favorite humus, but I may not be a fan of black bean humus and this is the first time I have had. my nieces were over and they loved it but wanted more garlic. so after adding more garlic to it they ate he entire thing. it was good just not my favorite, again could just be my taste.

I agree with RALWATTAR - thank you for your post! I doubled the spices and the lemon juice and it came out perfect. Otherwise I imagine this would have been rather bland.

Delicious. I didn't have QUITE enough lemon juice (maybe short 1/2 a tsp) but it was fine, the garlic and spices make it sufficiently flavourful. Had to add a couple extra tbsp of liquid for it to blend well in my Magic Bullet so definitely keep the reserved liquid just in case. Will happily make again!

I put in a total of 3 cloves of garlic (possibly a little overboard), and put in 2 Tbsp tahini instead of 1.5 T since I thought it could use the extra oils since the recipe asks for no olive oil. Had some leftover serrano pepper which I threw in, and my usual 1 tsp cumin+ 1 tsp coriander. I think the recipe would be perfect even without these changes.

This is fantastic!    Very healthy.  I made it exactly as the recipe except for garnishing it with olives.  I garnished it with some chunky salsa and a little shredded cheese. For a dip with corn chips.   Major hit!   Then I thought..wonder how it would be hot with melted cheese...again excellent as a side with some tacos instead of retried beans.

I've made this recipes dozens of times. I started out making single batches, graduated to double after a couple times, and now make triple batches now that I have a larger food processor! One of the few recipes that I leave more or less unaltered. It's nearly perfect on it's own, although I have been known to toss in some fresh parsley when I have it on hand. I love this stuff and it's one of my go-to crowd pleaser party dishes!

One of my go-to's for a snack!  Just the smallest kick (like mild taco sauce kick - not even a little bad!) and the flavor is AWESOME!  The tahinni is essential.

I used the entire amt of the spices other than the cayenne pepper. I only used 1/8 tsp of that.  And I left the olives out, because I hate olives.  It was great.

OMG!!!!! This is an AWESOME recipe!! Have made it several times now. With black beans, I use lime juice & I have also made this with garbanzo beans and then I use lemon juice, both are excellent. A great basic recipe that one can then play with the seasonings and spices to taste. Thanks so much for a really great recipe!! My first review on here!!

Wow! This was amazing!!! I attempted to make hummus 5 years ago with disastrous results due to not knowing to stir the tahini paste when bringing it home from the store.  This was my second attempt at hummus after being encouraged by a friend to try again.  I can't believe I threw the towel in so easily and continued to eat store bought hummus for so long.  I had to take this hummus away from my husband as he was going to finish the whole thing.  Made this exactly using fresh cloves of garlic, and my paprika is the smoked kind.  We will be tripling this recipe the next time around.  Thanks so much!! No more store bought hummus for us Yum!
UPDATE: I forgot and dumped the olives in the food processor with all the other ingredients and it was super delicious.  We will just toss them in next time around.

I doubled the garlic cloves and used heaping tablespoons of tahini and doubled the cumin, cayenne pepper and sprinkled generous amounts of paprika. It was fast to make and delicious to eat, the proof is how fast it disappears! Thank you Jen!

Nice healthy recipe. If you want a kick to it just add more garlic or cumin. :)

LOVE this dip. I substitute chipotle in adobo for they Cayenne and a lot more garlic. Always a hit where ever I take it.

I will try it again. Too much liquid in recipe which makes it thin I will decrease liquid. One other problem is in the ingredients it calls for 1/4 t of Cayenne pepper but when you add section it calls for only 1/8 t. I used the higher amt before I realized it had changed. That made a little to tangy.

This was absolutely delicious, and so incredibly easy to prepare.  I made it for a party and it went fast! Everyone absolutely loved it. This is now going to be my "go-to" hummus recipe for parties and snacking at home. Thank you for sharing it!

Made this recipe in honor of International Hummus Day! We had cooked black beans on hand so we went the non-traditional black bean recipe. The only thing we changed was substituting 3 tablespoons of olive oil in place of the reserved liquid (we didn't keep the reserved liquid) and it tasted fantastic. 2 of us ate the entire bowl in one sitting. We have roots in Israel and eat alot of hummus and this is the best recipe we have found! And its soooo easy. Made it in the blender!

I learned that black beans may be healthier than garbanzos (more cancer-fighting phytonutrients), so I looked into making hummus with black beans.  This recipe is even better than regular hummus!  Adding the olives is genius!  I use kalamata.

FABULOUS FIVE STAR recipe! My family LOVED it.  I used smoked cumin rather than regular cumin and increased the cayenne by 1/4 teaspoon. I also used Hungarian paprika for a bolder taste.  I will be making this super easy recipe again and saved it as one of my favs.

Just tried this recipe and as another reviewer commented, I too did not have tahini on hand so I substituted with cashew butter for the tahini...one for one (as I don't have peanut butter). I kept everything else the same, going easy on the salt and cayenne so that I could flavor it per my family's tastes. It was absolutely delicious and going to become something I will make over and over again. Thank YOU so much for this recipe!!

I like chickpea humus better, but this was very good. I happen to really not like black beans, so that might be why I didn't love it.

Added calamatas right into mixture (and some of the juice)...used peanut butter in place of tahini simply because I was out of tahini. Absolutely loved this hummus and so did the party guests.

With the following tweaks, this recipe is 5 stars.  I used lime juice instead of lemon. Dropped the tahini to 1 tbs (only because I don't like a strong tahini flavor).  Upped the cumin to 1 tsp. Used 1 tbs extra virgin olive oil. Reduced salt to 1/4 tsp and used kosher salt (the salt in the bean liquid is good enough). Added a dash of onion powder and garlic powder, and used the rest of the spices as indicated in the recipe. And the most important addition of all - 1/4 cup of cilantro!! SO DELICIOUS! I think this is going to be my go-to quick recipe for parties.

Does not replace regular hummus, but adds another great and healthy addition to my menus... I did not bother with the garnishes. Hubby says this is the first hummus he actually LIKED... (well, he's a little old fashioned in his food selections).

Ok, so first of all I used 3 cloves of garlic; I like garlic!  I agree with the liquid, but only used 1 & 1/2 TBSP, and the same amount of olive oil, as another reviewer suggested.  Also, as suggested, I rinsed the beans.  I used the juice of 1 small lime, so about 1 1/2 TBSP or so.  I liked the kick of cayenne; curious to see how it tastes tomorrow; in my experience, these types of things (lots of fresh, bold ingredients) need to sit together over time to truly come alive. :)

Update:  my hummus-obsessed work mates loved this! I did not do the olives; the flavor did mellow, and the cayenne wasn't too bold, except for one friend who is not fond of spice anyway.

This really surprised me. If I can get past the really peculiar color of this dip, then it is actually pretty descent. I am not a big fan of hummus. I have tried countless recipes, even on this site. I have not really liked any of them. This one seems to have the perfect balance of flavors. I used Goya low-sodium beans. It was a good choice, because unlike other cans today they seem to really pack the beans to the top. Even though I tend to tweak recipes, I decided to follow this one exactly. Only change I made was cutting the amount of cayenne in half. It blended quickly in my Vitamix on speed 10, 30-40 seconds. It was very creamy, as hummus should be. When done, I even decorated with some olives as suggested. After tasting, I did drizzle a little olive oil on top, but just because I am used to seeing that on other hummus recipes. I had sweet potato and chive Mediterranean crackers, so that is what I used for dipping. Made for a healthy snack this evening. ty

Great hummus; everybody liked it.  I ground a few kalamata olives right in, and I think it made the hummus less bland and more distinct from standard chickpea hummuis.

I didn't have all of the ingredients but...THIS IS AMAZING! I wanted black bean hummus spur of the moment but didn't have all of the ingredients. I used garlic powder instead of a clove, doubled the cayenne pepper (because apparently I like to clear out my sinuses while I eat) and did not have the olives. This recipe is SO EASY and SO TASTY! I can't wait to try it with fresh garlic and olives!

Great as a sandwich spread.
Organic black beans makes it much tastier.

This is the best homemade hummus. I put all ingredients in the Vitmix, except the tahini and much less salt than is called for. I misread the directions and included the olives in the Vitamix and it turned out amazing!

My family loved this!  We liked it as well or better than hummus made with oil! We left out the olives, and I used chili pepper instead of cayenne.  Fantastic and easy!
Served with celery.

I love this recipe!  I doubled the spices and the garlic because I like it full of flavor.  I forgot to reserve juice from the beans, so just poured a little more oil from the tahini into it.  If this hadn't of worked to make it creamy I would have added a little olive oil. Much better to my taste buds to traditional hummus, though I like that too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Subbed 2 T. EVOO for black bean juice.  Lime juice instead of lemon juice.  Left out cumin.  Added 10 olives to food processor instead of garnishing w/them.I did use tahini.  I added cilantro to food processor.

OMG this is by far the best recipe I've tried for hummus. Now, I personally prefer the creamier consistency of hummus that black beans make unlike the garbanzo beans. But I'm sure you can adjust to your liking by using different kinds of beans. I also love the beautiful color that the black beans create. Instead of adding olives, I added two teaspoons of olive oil and just 1 tablespoon of tahini. It's super quick and easy to make, and oh so healthy! :)

This recipe is so delicious and simple. I add extra cayenne for an extra kick.If u find it bland just kick up your seasonings and blend. But I found it absolutely delicious.

Great hummus.  I bought the olives not realizing they were merely a garnish....I did not read through the whole thing before deciding to try it. Anyway, not being a fan of olives in their most humble form, I threw them in the food processor and blended them in. This recipe is way too functional to be called bland. Really solid black bean hummus...really wonderful flavor.

As good as any store bought and healthier (no added oil).  Incredibly easy.  I've made it 3 times in 2 weeks for various people and they've all loved it.  Don't have cayenne pepper so I used 1/4 tsp red pepper + 1/4 tsp chili powder.

Phenomenal recipe! I didn't have greek olives on hand so I added about a half cup of garbanzo beans and a tbs of olive oil as a substitute directly in the food processor and it came out great. Definitely one I'll make again, it has a really good balance of flavors.

Simple recipe, awesome results!  Tastes amazing, and it's much cheaper than store-bought (more authentic taste, too).  Instead of using canned beans, I boiled some on my own and used water and a little olive oil, as another reviewer suggested. Now I can have (black bean) hummus any time I want, and for a fraction of the price I'd find it anywhere else!

Wonderful! The best part is it calls for no olive oil.  I'm happy for a lower fat option  humus.  I went ahead and added extra lemon juice which turned out nicely.

Yum Yum!  This turned out great. I took the advice of another here and used olive oil and water in place of reserved black bean juice, also a little more garlic and tahini.  This is a keeper!

Incredible!  I made it exactly as written, minus the olives which I just didn't have on hand.  I brought it to a tailgate yesterday and it was gobbled up in a matter of seconds.  A great, great dip!

This turned out really good! I didn't have the Greek olives to garnish it with, to that might have helped. People at the party thought it was pudding (even though it was surrounded by pita chips). I also think it was just a little too runny so when I make it again I'll only use half the liquid. I also think I'd like to try doubling it and adding a can of chickpeas instead of another can of black beans.

I really liked this and so did my co-workers! I made a couple of changes. I used peanut butter instead of the tahini because it was what I had on hand. I only used 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, we don't like it that hot. To us it had just the right bite! Thanks for a great recipe and healthy too! No oil!

I gave this a 5 star with the following changes.  I used 3 garlic cloves, doubled the cayenne and paprika as I like more of a nip.  Colour is rather non appealing though, rather a grey purple colour not like the picture.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars, because it is great just as it is written.  I've made it as written a few times, but as I continue to make it I've made the following changes, and I love it even more:  double the garlic, triple the tahini, double the lemon juice, double the cayenne, half the cumin (I don't love cumin).  That's it!  Great flavor.

Love this!  Just whipped up a triple(!!) batch tonight, for company tomorrow.  So great, so easy, and a striking looking variation from the norm.  It's creamier, too.  We added more heat and more lemon, per our tastes, but as it is, 5 stars!  Thanks for this recipe!

Holy hummus!!  Just made this and I'll be lucky if it lasts for another 15 minutes.  I didn't have tahini but used mayo as another reviewer suggested.  I did add a little more lemon juice and cayenne, but did not add the olives (hate em'!).  Excellent recipe.

Quite nice.  Good flavour combo.  Need to drain the beans better though - it was a bit runny for my tastes.

As other reviewers have written, this is a great recipe.  Very easy to make and is delicious.  Also, easy to double the recipe so it will last longer. (if doubling recipe, might not need extra lemon juice)

Really, really good.  I liked the black bean hummus better than the standard garbanzo bean that I usually make.  Thanks for the great recipe.

this was really good when I made it with chickpeas instead of the black beans.  I first made it with the black beans and it was very runny - without using ANY of the reserved liquid.  It got rave reviews from my guests when made with chickpeas though!

So easy and tasty!  I was nervous the tahini was going to be overwhelming but after letting everything sit overnight it was well balanced the next day.

This was easy, tasty, and popular. A nice change from both regular hummus and fat-filled bean dips. I about doubled all the spices, and next time will probably add even a little more.

My first attempt at Black Bean Hummus. VERY GOOD. Rinsed the beans and then added extra water and olive oil until it reached a constancy I liked. If you're not a garlic fan you might want to use roasted garlic in place of the raw. Personally I liked the garlic as suggested. I used krinos tahini for those curious. Sprinkled the finished hummus with paprika and olive oil. Great with a chili and lime flavored chips or homemade chili pita chips.

yum yum!   if you can get past the color ---  something different...made mine w/ more tahini (2 TBSP), FRESH squeezed LIME juice, a few shakes of ADOBO seasoning, only used a few TBSP of the liquid from beans but drizzled EVOO as the consistency seemed too dry....sprayed pita bread w/ pam and sprinkled w/ lawrys season salt (USE VERY SPARINGLY) and a quick sprinkle of mexican chili pepper spice....really went well w/ dip....

I took this to a cookout last night, and no lying, it was gone in less than 10 minutes. It was gobbled up by men, women, and children!  Very easy to make, I just dumped everything into my mini processor.  Served with both tortilla chips, and mini carrots.  Very easy to make!

Fantastic dip!  You'll enjoy this even if you don't particularly care for traditional hummus.  We found this an easy-to-prepare recipe, and the flavor was even better the second day.  The only change we made was omitting the salt, which you don't miss if you serve the dip with tortilla chips.

This was wonderful.  My husband is from Jordan and originally he laughed when I told him I made Hummus with black beans, but he thought it was great.  I actually tossed the olives into the processor as well as the paprika and it was great.

I absolutely love this recipe. I always bring it to parties with some fresh pita bread from a local greek restraunt. It's always a hit. I now get specific requests to make it when I go to parties and bbqs. The only thing I do different is use lime juice instead of lemon juice.

Big time YUM!  I've been looking for ways to use beans (high fiber, protein, and decent amount of iron) and this is a winner.  I added extra lemon juice, used olive oil instead of "bean juice" and omitted the cayenne since my 1-yr-old would be eating it.  A big hit--it's already half gone and I made it 10 min. ago.  I'm going to double the recipe next time.  Fresh lemon juice is a must.

Very tasty. It was more similar to traditional chick pea hummus than I expected. A great alternative, and is easy to make.

I was craving hummus but had no chickpeas so I looked up a black bean hummus recipe because I had them on hand!  This is a great recipe.  I added a bit more tahini and more garlic (some people noted that there was too much garlic already but I'm a big garlic person)

I've always been afraid of trying hummus due to the unappetizing smell and appearance. After becoming vegetarian, I decided to try this recipe. It's delish beyond my wildest expectations! I was literally digging out the last bits of hummus from the bottom of the blender with my fingers. I followed the recipe exactly, but substituted garbanzo beans for the black beans. Also, I added a little more lemon juice as recommended for more of a kick. I prefer to told the paprika garnish, but if you want to bring out the tang, that's the way to do it. Will be making this regularly!

Not pretty, but tastes great!  Hearty flavor and goes well with all sorts of dippers like fresh veggies, pita chips, rolled in a tortilla shell, etc..  I used sesame oil, to taste, instead of tahini.

Very good and super easy. Followed the recipe (aside from the tahini, because this was a last minute dip) and it was terrific, even without the tahini, which I know gives it a lot of flavor. This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious.  I had Black Bean Hummus at a restaurant and loved it so much I went looking for a recipe.  This is easy to make and is always a hit when I serve it to guests.

I eat a lot of hummus, and this is a great alternative to the traditional chickpea hummus. As an alternative, I've used lime juice which goes great with the other flavors. This actually came out of necessity one day when I had plenty of limes and no lemons. I love this recipe!

I just made this the other night and whooo it really tastes like garlic! The flavor of the beans does come through after the garlic, but it's kind of a secondary flavor. Really, not bad. I like this on crackers more than I do veggies.

Still not a hummus expert, but this is so good! I omitted the cumin and salt this time, and although I may try it with the cumin in the future, I'll always leave out the salt. I just don't think it needs it. In addition, I didn't have the olives (and I'm not a big fan of them anyway), so I skipped those, too. To serve, I simply dipped toasted pita bread into this zippy deliciousness. Thanks! (and I'm starting to wonder, can a person really mess up hummus?)

I needed some party food in a hurry and had all the ingredients on hand. Easy, great flavor. I will try it out on kids with taco/tortilla chips the next time. Might also be good to substitute lime juice with the lemon juice.

I stumbled on this recipe, and I am really glad that I did. We had just finished up a container of black bean hummus that we had purchased from Costco. My husband and I both loved it so much, and I have to tell you that this recipe tastes exactly like the hummus that we paid $5.00 a container for. I don't like Garbanzo beans at all, but love the overall flavor of hummus, so this was a really great find. Next time, I will add more garlic, and reduce the liquid- it was a little too thin, and I only added 2 tbsp. of the reserved liquid. I'd say that it is definately ok to discard the remaining liquid, save 1 tbsp. Thank you so much Jen for saving us some money with this recipe!!!

This is easy and awesome.  You can substitute garbanzo for the black beans for people who don't like black beans, but I think it's better with the black beans.  The last time I made it, the tahini was really thick for some reason, and needed more bean juice, but you just need to watch and taste and adjust.  I always use extra garlic, but that's just personal preference.  This recipe is great as written.

I love hummus, so I've tried lots of them and this one is still THE BEST!  It's also one of the easiest.  Plus, I keep the ingredients on hand for unexpected company.

this tastes amazing, i like it a little smoother with the black bean juice in it and, though normally i can't deal with heat, the cayenne gave it just the right amount. i have a new party snack!

Very tasty...since I love garlic, I added two cloves.  In stead of cayenne pepper, I  used red pepper flakes.  The flavors blend in a more subtle combination if you let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving. Thanks Jen for sharing this!  It's amazing...

Yum!  Easy & tasty!  I used the spice amounts as listed in the ingredients list instead of using a little bit and then adding to taste as per the directions.  Then I added a little more cumin.

The quantities of the spices listed in the ingredients doesn't match what's in the directions.  I, myself, didn't notice this, and followed the quantities listed in the directions, and I thought the hummus was delicious, as did my friends.  I gave the recipe to a friend of mine, and she followed the quantities listed under ingredients, and since she likes things spicy, she was happy, but I didn't like it.  So, I guess you can go either way.

This is a great black bean dip.  I say bean dip because I don't consider this hummus. To me hummus = specifically, garbanzo beans.

Very good.  I added more beans to make the hummus thicker, but made no other adjustments.  It was better after sitting overnight in the fridge.  Will make it again.

I am crazy about this hummus!  I've been making it for several months now, and never get sick of it.  Not only is it delicious, it's lower in fat than other hummus recipes since there's no added oil.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it turned out great.  My friends who are purists and want their hummus made with garbanzo beans were greatly surprised by this recipe.  I'll keep these ingredients on hand in case of surprise guests.

The hummus is da bomb! (a compliment of course!).  My mods: 2.5 Tb tahini, and ONLY add salt to taste at the end, since the beans & the reserved juice are already salty.  Served with toasted wheat pitettes (mini pitas). Thanks for this recipe!

I was really expecting to like this more than I did.  I tried this as a change of pace from my normal hummus recipe, but I guess it turns out that I am a traditional garbanzo hummus girl in the end.  It is still good - just very similar to another recipe I use, which I like a bit better.  I do suggest holding off on adding the liquid until everything is blended.  I like a very thick hummus, and I found that no added liquid was necessary.
