I tried this with chicken,and I marinated it over night. I thought it was ok. Personally I thought it was on the salty side, but the chicken was tender. I won't make it again although I think it is more suited for beef.

I used this marinade on steaks.  They turned out so tender.  I over cooked the smaller of the two steaks slightly, but it was still tender.  My husband even remarked that they were tender.  The taste was also good, very mild.  You can eat by themselves or if you wanted to add a sauce it would be great.  I marinaded over night.

This marinade tastes great even when I used light beer.  I then grilled chicken which was very moist.

I followed the recipe to the word, and marinated boneless skinless chicken breasts for 8 hours. Although the chicken was moist, it really just tasted like beer!  My boyfriend and I really like beer - but this was a bit much.  I used a regular lager.  Should I have used light beer?

This is the best marinade ever!! I marinate the chicken overnight then grill half and throw the rest in a ziplock and freeze for a later date.

THANK YOU for posting this recipe!!!
After years of complex and fancy marinades, the whole family rated this a keeper and a "Regular, Please"  when we had pork that was marinated in it (exactly as posted).   I didn't even use a fancy beer.. just an inexpensive one I found in the back of the refrigerator!!    This is the epitomy of less is more!!!   DELICIOUS    
ten out of ten stars! 

Thanks!!!

Scaled to 2 servings and used on chicken cubes. Added thyme and basil and ended up marinating overnight. Cooked on my Forman grill. It was so delicious, tender and juicy and nice grilled crusty edges. Next time might cut back slightly on the soy for chicken(just for color), not sure. I have used beer marinades before and love them but this is just such a nice basic recipe that you can then add your own touches to suit the meal that you are cooking. I served the chicken with the couscous & cucumber salad from this site. Beautiful summer meal.

Ohhh...this was excellent. I used it last night for chicken. I marinaded it for about two hours. My fiance and I loved it!! I used a light beer for this marinad. The next time I make it I'll use low-sodium soy sauce, other than that it was perfection. Thanks for the marinade Siegela!!

Excellent! My husband doesn't care for pork chops, but these he raved about. I made the recipe as stated with a cheapo full-flavored-canned beer and pre-chopped roasted garlic. I then grilled after marinating just 2 hours. So tasty and tender, they were gone in no time. Young kids really liked, too!

This was wonderful. I have used it on pork, chicken and venison. Each time it was a hit. The venison each time I used this marinade was so tender and juicy. Thanks.

This was a nice, easy marinade.  I made it as written except I used fresh parsley since I was out of dried.  Next time I will try to punch it up just a bit more.

I didn't see anything special about this recipe at all.  It didn't give the chicken any flavor.  I even added twice as much soy sauce and let it marinade for 7 hours.  It still just tasted like plain ole chicken.

Used it for pork tenderloin.  The flavor was awesome! I used a bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale and slipped in an extra clove of garlic.  Such a simple recipe with supplies I'll typically have on hand any day of the week.

This is a quick and easy fix for grilled or pan cooked chicken. If you can't marinade over night, a couple of hours would do. I do suggest cutting the soy sauce in half... Besides that the chicken comes out very moist and tender.

I used this on steak, marinating for three hours and it turned out OK.  The meat was moist but it wasn't as flavorul as I had hoped.  Tasted like mild beer and I was looking for some zing.  I'm partial to more spicy marinades so I'll probably pass on making this again.  Thanks though.

Very tasty!  I marinated tuna steaks in this for a few hours and added 3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar also.  Great flavor for the tuna and helped the tuna to retain it's moisture.  Would definitely make it again.

I thought this was a simple-to-make and delicious marinade for boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I marinated the breasts for about 6 hours and then cooked them on the grill.  The chicken was moist and juicy and full of flavor.

I read the review about this recipe being salty and decided to try the 1/3 less salt soy sauce and my chicken came out wonderful.  I have a london Broil waiting for this one.

Fabulous! I used this to marinate chicken for kabobs and we loved it. Will definitely be using it over and over.

An easy marinade that takes just a few minutes.  I add red pepper flakes for a little spice.  Thanks for sharing!

i wanted to like this more.. bf thought these were good.. i used the marinade on pork chops and they were very tender.. bf said it could be passed for chicken.. it was *that* tender.. i used natural light for the beer but it was a little too much beer flavor for me.. bf disagreed.. i marinated for 6-7 hours.. i don't think i'm going to try this again
