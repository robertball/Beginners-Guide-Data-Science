Use my own recipe of egg noodles. I have made kugel many times before.....IT must be said this is a dish you CAN NOT over cook. IF your oven runs hot, reduce cooking time by 5 minutes. Melt the butter (cool before adding to eggs)and blend well with the eggs then pour over noodles. COVER this for 50 minutes, then take off foil for last 10 minutes. I like to add paprika, garlic and sauteed onions. Adds a much needed flavor boost. Only rated it a 4, since I had to change a few things, to add flavor.

I added a buch of cheddar cheese, a little mozzarella cheese, and a little parmesan cheese, then I added some very small cut up chicken breast pieces(cooked). It was delicious!

I gave this 5 stars because it is absolutely delicious. But I won't make it again because it's too much work and my sink was full of dirty dishes by the time I finished making it. But if anyone wants to make it for me LOL, I'll eat it. My neighbor came over and I gave her some. She made all kinds of noises while eating it because she loved it so much.

This is a great base recipe. It is a little bland so I added some chunky applesauce,raisins and cinnamon and it was delicious!

I don't know what I did wrong with this recipe! It turned out crunchy and didn't have a good texture. I did not care for it.

I thought this made a good side.  I enjoyed it with an eggplant stew I had and some corn.  It was a nice addition.

I thought this was very good, although extremely rich and definitely not on my diet.  It did not, however, go over well at the church dinner, but in my experience these wonderful people are not prone to try anything new or ethnic.  Added lots of bacon and mozzarella.  Sent the leftovers home with my daughter and her eyes lit up.

Yum! Easy and delicious, this is the simple kugel recipe I've been looking for.  I noticed others complained it was on the bland side so I put some sauteed onions and garlic in my first batch, and took it out at about 55 minutes because people warned of overcooking. I gave my roommate a piece and he devoured it, asking for seconds and thirds.  I ate some leftovers today with ricotta cheese and it was great. Next time I make this, I'm going to experiment with other flavours, just to switch things up a bit...I'm drooling at the prospect of a little cinnamon.

Almost my mom's recipe.  Use thin egg noodles, salt, and chicken fat in place of the butter.  It'll be 5 stars!

I was looking for a recipe to use up my egg noodles, and this seemed easy enough for a lunch.  No one in my family cared for it, though. Oh well, sorry!

I added small chunks of smoked bacon to this dish and topped it with cheese and sliced tomatoes. Nice recipe.

My father used to make me eggs and noodles and I have always loved them. I have made them for others who are supprised at how good and satifying they are for a weekend start to the day. You can add to it according to your taste. Fried onions are good, chopped up pieces of ham, you name it.

In order to make a good meal ya gotta make a mess right.. Love the recipe.. I added little milk to egg to make it little fluffier, added a litte cheese,also seasoned up with some pepper, salt, parmasian herb seasoning and of course, Mrs. Dash.. I dash all my food.
