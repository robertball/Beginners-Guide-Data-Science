May I suggest a raspberry vinagerette or reduction instead of jam, it will penetrate better during osmosis marinading. Reduce or eliminate soy sauce drastically especially if not using low sodium

Disappointing.  The soy sauce was excessive.  It completely drowned out the other flavors.

Good and easy. Made a for delicious grilled chicken breasts, which we used to top salad of baby greens, green onions, pears, craisins, and walnuts.

I've never made a marinade before, but this was great!  I actually made kabobs instead of the whole chicken breasts.  I cut up the chicken in the morning before work, and made dinner that night, so probably marinaded about 11 hours.

I didn't know what rice vinegar was, but saw in reviews that others used cider vinegar, so I substituted that.  I also cut back the soy sauce to 1/3 cup.

The chicken had great flavor, was super moist, and smelled great while it was cooking on the grill!!

It tasted ok. I think raspberry and chicken make a unique flavor. I can't say it was one of my favorite marinades, but I did cut the chix up in heated some veggies with it that gave it some added flavor. If you complement it nicely, it can be a great dish.

I used a raspberry jalapeno jam and pineapple chunks along with the juice, and then blended the marinade together till it was smooth. It was pretty thick and sticky, but all my kids picked the grill clean!

This was wonderful!  I used half raspberry habanero, half cherry preserves.  Used apple cider vinegar instead.  I reduced the marinade and kept brushing it on the chicken as it was grilling.  Goes in the keeper box.  Thanks!

I used it with pork, marinaded for 24 hrs then grilled however it really didn't add any flavor to the meat, the meat was moist however.  I don't plan on using it again this was, maybe orange marmalade would add more flavor.
