I enjoyed this recipe. I like cold yogurt/curd rice on warm summer days, and this was a change from the usual plain yogurt rice. I loved the addition of curry leaves and mustard seeds. I will definitely make this again.

this curd rice is good. but we southindians add 1/4 cup pomegranate and carrot (  diced in to small pieces) in to this, try out ! instead of red chilli u can also add curd chilli(moru mulaku ) which is the correct side dish for curd rice

This came our pretty good - not as good as my mother's.  Next time, I will add more yogurt and let it sit out for a bit before using to get it more sour.

This recipe looks excellent and authentic, but I'm sad because I've never heard of fresh curry leaves, nor do I know where I could buy them.
