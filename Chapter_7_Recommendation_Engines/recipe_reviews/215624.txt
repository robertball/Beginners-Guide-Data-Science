I get SO SO many requests for my recipe when I make this potato salad and I now make it without the actual recipe. You can really just throw it together in whatever proportions you want.
  My trick is stirring in two tablespoons of white vinegar with the potatoes immediately after you drain them and they are still hot. This gives the salad the perfect little zing that everyone seems to love. I think this is why I always get requests for the recipe.
  DO NOT use dried chives. Use fresh or even better...USE GREEN ONIONS/SCALLIONS. Much tastier and more eye appeal.They don't get lost in the salad.
   BEWARE: once you take this to a gathering, it will be YOUR thing to bring forever and always!!

I did it a bit differently... my fiance is a chef and gave me some pointers. I actually baked the potatoes. It took a bit longer but really gave it the baked potato taste. I also left the skins on them,  they held up better when I cut them. I used scallions instead of dried chives as well. Overall, very good! Oh, and I put a touch of bacon grease in it, (so bad I know!) but it just gave it a bit more flavor. I am taking it to a cookout, so we will see how well it is received there!

To save time, I used pre-cooked packaged bacon pieces. I made a half recipe of this but used the full amount of mayonnaise AND I added extra spices, like onion powder/garlic powder/hot sauce and omitted the salt. I also roasted my potatoes for added oomph (we've found that roasting potatoes just tastes better in potato salad). Because I had it to use and wanted to stretch my salad, I added in some chopped green onion, celery and a couple chopped hard boiled eggs. Tasty and quite simple.

Wonderful salad that tasted just like a "baked potato" with all the fixin's! I used red skinned poatoes and left the skins on and opted to use  green onion as it's mild in flavor and pairs well with baked potatoes vs. dried chives - basically eyeballing the ingredients. I used Hellman's light mayo along with the sour cream and added a few splashes of white wine vinegar. I also added some chopped fresh chives on top to pretty it up - YUM!

Very good, but I made a few changes. I got baby potatoes and cut them into 1 inch cubes. I roasted them with 2 Tbsp of butter in a covered pan for 30 mintues. I find the potatoes hold their shape better this way and taste more like a baked potato. I didn't use mayo and used a package of bacon pieces instead of making bacon, to save time. I used fresh scallions as well. We prefer to eat this at room temp. or just slightly chilled. My family loved it.

Sampled this receipe right after making it and almost had a heart attack. It was not good. BUT I let it set overnight and tried it again the next morning and it was perfect! People raved about how good it was.

I made this for my husband's birthday party and it was a winner! I substituted the chives with green onion. I also used the whole pack of thick cut bacon. With extra sharp cheddar, it was a delight.

Fantastic!! The little bit of mayo that went into this was the perfect touch for the sour cream.  Great flavors.

Update since my first review.  I roasted the potatoes this time, and it was an even bigger hit.  I had 0 left overs.

We LOVE this and the beauty of it is that it really does taste like a loaded baked potato! I also add in some green onions for an extra kick and usualy don't measure the mayo, but use it to taste. Sometimes I'll even add a little dry ranch dressing mix for something different...either way this is a winner! This is a wonderfully different potato salad that everyone seems to enjoy! :)

A delicious twist on potato salad. I love making it with red skin potatoes (unpeeled of course), and in a pinch I'll use a package to 1 1/2 pakages of the real bacon bits. I don't use any mayonnaise though. Also, try adding a tablespoon or two of melted butter, it really kicks the taste up a bit.

This is a wonderful change from standard mustard potato salad.  I have made this for quite some time.  I have also switched it up and used shredded cheddar and  half sour cream / half ranch dressing for a different taste.  The one thing I would recommend is that when frying the bacon, I always cut it up into 1 inch chunks and it crisps up so much faster and nicer.  Try this recipe as is or with a few changes, either way, you will like it!

This recipe is very similar to one I use.  Instead of sour cream and cheddar use gorgonzola cheese.  Also add in fresh parsley and fresh chives.  You will need two to three cups mayonnaise though.  My recipe calls for yukon gold potatoes.  Otherwise the same and tastes so yummy!  I get requests all the time for this recipe!

This was fantastic!!  I probably used about 3 lbs of red skinned potatoes so I had plenty of wet ingredients.  I used fresh green onions instead of dried chives.  I actually heated some up and it was great like that too...would make an excellent casserole!

I've had this salad at potlucks before so, I thought I would like it more than I did. The flavors work well but it was thick and a lttle gummy. My hubby loves baked potatoes but he wouldn't eat seconds or take it to lunch the next day. Maybe my measurements were off, who knows.

Great recipe and a nice change from the same old potato salad.  I kept the skins on too and also used fresh chives. Using pre-cooked real bacon bits makes is super easy.  YUM!

You are so right, it is different and the taste, GREAT. I really like the texture since it doesn't have a "watery" dressing and the potatoes stay whole, they don't get soggy or crumble up. Thanks a lot.
   I did give it a personal touch, with all due respect, the second time around: add 1/2 cup canned sliced pineapple, 1/2 cup cut in 1/2 cocktail cherries that come in a jar and double the mayonnaise. Try it you might like it.

I made this to go with some rosemary garlic baked chicken today.  I altered the recipe a bit - used parsley in the place of chives and added some chopped pieces of carrots - turned out awesome!  Everyone in my family loved it and we had absolutely no leftovers!  I was so looking forward to some for lunch tomorrow!  :)

Loved it!  I substituted Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream with great results.  My husband and I really enjoyed this as a perfect accompaniment to burgers on the grill.  Thanks!!!

I made this for 4th of July and it didn't go over well.  We thought it was kind of uneventful.  Reviews were that it needed more of a zip so I will try it again with vinegar and some more tweaking but as written it needs something.  It is a great concept; I had it from a local deli and it was really great so I will keep trying to make it to my liking. thanks for the start.

Awesome, easy recipe. Everyone raves how delicious it is whenever I make it and take to gathererings. I usually add a little red pepper flake or cayenne to mine for a little added spice.

I was somewhat unimpressed. I baked the potatoes ( I used red). I also used fresh green onions. The flavor seemed to be lacking. Perhaps extra seasoning and maybe some vinegar to pep it up?

This was just ok. I followed the recipe exactly, and let it rest overnight. I was hoping for more intense flavors, and the salad was generally hard. A little better as it approached room temperature. Perhaps it needs more salt, and should be served not straight-from-the-fridge.

YUM!  The perfect change up to typical potato salad.  Sprinkle a little vinegar (as others suggested) and salt and pepper your potatoes while they're HOT - right in the strainer.  (I always do this to start potato salad - Flavors seem to get in there better).  I used green onions and added a little onion powder and garlic salt.  Used pre-cooked bacon bits in the jar (Hormel - 50% less fat than normal bacon).  Freshly fried would probably be better...but this worked great and was CONVENIENT!  Love that.  We're having this tonite with BBQ'd santa maria style tri tip -- Oh yeah!  Hello spring/summer!!

I accidentally used a whole bag of cheese which made the ‘sauce’ extra thick. Luckily my potatoes were perfect and could withstand the over mixing. I loved the flavor as a different alternative to the  regular potato salad.

Everyone loved it!  New favorite potato salad.  Made a described except mixed all wet ingredients with bacon and green onion then potato.  Didn't have but an hour to sit, but big hit.

So, I'm not pregnant, but I wanted loaded baked potato salad all weekend so much that it was like a pregnancy craving. Finally got to the store today and bought the ingredients and made it mostly according to the recipe. I followed others' advice and roasted the potatoes in olive oil, salt and pepper and garlic, and I used a whole five pounds of red-skinned potatoes. Doubled the other ingredients. That first taste was worth every bit of effort. This recipe is delicious!!!

Baked the taters, used chopped vidalia onion, some celery, pre-cooked bacon and then mixed one cup sour cream with one cup mayo and a buttermilk ranch packet. Delicious!!!

I loved it and I did as one of the other posters and roasted the potatoes with the skin on.  I put them in a bowl and added a little olive oil (about 2 tablespoons) and tossed them with salt and pepper then put them on 2 pans, spread out to one layer. I put foil on the pans and sprayed with cooking spray and roasted at 400 for about 45 minutes . Then I let them cool on the counter til they were slightly warm.  I thought it tasted great as soon as it was mixed up.  The next day it had absorbed a lot of the liquid and I added more mayo and sour  cream to moisten it up.  I think it could take double the mayo and sour cream if refrigerating the night before, because the potatoes are so absorbent.

Loved this.  I put baby potatoes that I quartered in a 400 degree oven with a 1/4 cup of butter and some salt  and roasted them until they were done.  I didn't use any mayo (who puts  mayo on baked potatoes anyway?)  I added sour cream to get the consistency I wanted.  Next time I may  use fresh chives and some green onions.

The only change I made was to add half sour cream and light mayo and a stick of butter. I actually bake mine at 350 for about 45 minutes. It's like a hot loaded baked potato.. I get requests for the recipe whenever I bring it.

The only change was fresh chives vs. dried. Whipped this up pretty much at the last minute. Served slightly warm. VERY good.

I loved this idea... However I used 4 large red potatoes that I rough chopped/smashed with the skins, green onions instead of the chives and I shredded the cheese. Also, I only used 6 slices bacon and cut the cheese I half. I made if for my church picnic and Everyone loved it!

I tweaked this a bit for us, I used nugget potatoes as they hold their shape better in a salad. I also took out the chives and added chopped green onions instead. It was delicious, especially the next day!!

I loved this salad. I have made it several times and everyone loves it.  I follow the recipe except for substituting green onions. This last time, I did what another commenter suggested and poured vinegar on the cooling potatoes.  A couple of tablespoons, maybe. It did add a nice zing to the dish. I will definitely do it that way again.

This is a great choice for super picky eaters. I chose this recipe specifically for the meat-and-potatoes-only member of my family. I had to leave out the scallions, and it was still delicious. Really tastes like you're eating a baked potato with (almost) all the fixin's. Will make again often.

It needed a bit more saltiness and I did add more cheese into the actual salad. But overall, a great variation.

I followed the recipe exactly - I loved the idea of it but I just find that cheese gets lost in a potato salad, and the bacon loses its crispness overnight.  I'll continue with my regular potato salad.

Perfect potato salad! I used 1 onion, chopped, instead of chives, added 4 stalks of celery added 2 T. vinegar and everything else kept the same, except didn't peel the potatoes- Very Good!
2nd review- still 5 star! I cubed unpeeled red potatoes and roasted at 400 for 25 minutes- sprinkled w/ salt and pepper. Cooled potatoes and added to 1 C. sour cream 1 C. ranch dressing mixture- added shredded cheese, green onions, fresh snipped chives, and crumbled bacon. Sprinkle some bacon, cheese and chives over the top before serving. Did not add celery or vinegar this time. YUM!!

Very good recipe.  I did add a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch which umped up the flavor even more.  I also used thick cut bacon baked in the oven versus frying.  Next time though I think I will use regular bacon, the thick cut seem to be tougher to eat in the salad, didn't add the crispness I was looking for.  I also didn't add chives but instead green onion.  One more thing was adding vinegar to the potatoes right after they were done cooking suggested by another reviewer and a tad more mayo and sour cream.  Over all a good recipe.  Excited to see what my co-workers think at our luncheon today.

Andy, Amanda, Paul loved it.  It was good.  I used 4 lbs. of red potatoes and 15 sl. real bacon as it says, but it could have used more bacon for sure.  Also used a 16 oz. container of light sour cream and about a cup of mayo, probably a cup of cheese plus sprinkled more on top.  I used green onion instead of chives.  I would try Greek yogurt also.

Very good. I didn't even wait overnight to serve it and it was very well received, however, the leftovers the next day were also delicious. I ran out of sour cream and needed a little more creaminess, so I added plain Greek yogurt, and no one could tell the difference. I also opted for fresh chopped green onions instead of the dried chives, as others mentioned.
