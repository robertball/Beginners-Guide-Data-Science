Wonderful salad!  I cut the oil in half, doubled the cucumbers and tomatoes, and used red onion instead of the white.  When it was all done, it was very colorful.  I took it to a summer dinner party and it was a hit.

I followed the recipe loosely, using it as a general guideline to suit my own taste and in consideration of the ingredients I either had available or wanted to make a point of using.  I used red, yellow and orange bell peppers, sliced red onion for color and NO tomato – didn’t have it, but wouldn’t have used it anyway. I was fairly satisfied with the look of the salad, but thought it needed some “punch.”  A handful of ripe black olives took care of that.  As for the dressing, I merely shook on some salt, pepper, oregano and basil (didn’t have marjoram and never have).  I skipped the sugar - I don’t care for it  in my salad dressings.  I drizzled on the vinegar (always vinegar first) and then the olive oil to my liking. (My preference is a ratio of 3:1 of olive oil to vinegar) This salad satisfied both my goals of cleaning up the odds and ends in my vegetable crisper lickety-split as well as being a nutritious, fresh and colorful addition to our dinner tonight.  I particularly like the simple herb vinaigrette and the submitter’s directions to THINLY SLICE the vegetables (as opposed to chopping them all up as others have done) – it gave the salad a beautiful appearance, with each ingredient seeming to take center stage.  I can’t think of too many entrees that this salad wouldn’t complement nicely.

What an excellent, beautiful little salad! I served it over arugula and used shallot (instead of onion) and fresh herbs. I also reduced the dressing by 1/3 (but kept the herbs the same), which was just right. The herbs and shallot gave it so much flavor, and the arugula complemented it wonderfully. This was perfect with chianti and Artichoke and Spinach Lasagna, also from this site.

I hoped this would be tasty because it contains such a lively and tasty mix of vegetable, but the dressing with this recipe is awful. The amount of dressing was completely disproportionate to the salad--way too much. Also, the dressing itself was much too oily and bland. Next time, I will definitely use a different dressing with the solid vegetable premise.

This smelled great, looked beautiful, and tasted fantastic. The sweetness of the peppers and the acid of the vinegar were balanced beautifully. This is a keeper.

I've also had this salad at Chateau Basque on Union many moons ago. I remember my parents taking me to the Woolgrowers in the 60's.  We all ate at long tables family style. My favorite was the lamb meatballs.  Thank you for reviving good memories.

Very good and fairly versatile with veggies you have on hand. I always keep a jar of the sauce in the fridge for quick prep.

Had to try this recipe since I live here in Bakersfield.  Made it for a group of people when we had a Basque soup night.  It was fantastic.  I am not a vinegar person but it was great.

Other than chopping all the vegies rather than slicing, and using a red onion, I kept this recipe as written - and I love it! The dressing is zesty and fresh, and all the vegies compliment each other well. Its my first attempt at a salad with more than just tomato and lettuce, and I am so glad I tried it! Thanks!

Delicious.  I don't know if kalamata olives would be "appropriate" to add, but they would be good in this.

Wonderful recipe.   I did the opposite of some reviewers, and I left the vinegar/oil just how the author of the recipe suggested, however, after adding the seasonings and tasting, I decided to double those.   I will be making again.

This is delicious and very versatile. You could probably substitute with other veggies if needed. I added hot pepper just to give it a bit of heat for our tastes.

This salad is beautiful to look at but for my family's taste the dressing needs some adjustment. I made the full amount exactly as written but only ended up using half of it and I could have done with using even less. We also thought that there was too much oil in the dressing. I plan to try this again with adjustments. Thanks for letting me try.

Awesome salad! I served mine over arugula and ate it for lunch throughout the week, keeping the dressing separate until I was ready to eat. This is a very fresh and crisp salad, it will definitely be in my regular rotation.

Loved it after a few changes....added one can of back olives and 1 small jar marinated artichokes drained and chopped... I also used a red onion. Did not do the dressing as instructed because other reviewers said it was too much and bland....I did 2 tbs vinegar, 6 tbs olive oil, 1-2 crushed garlic cloves, 1 tsp (salt free) garlic and herb seasoning, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp sugar, and 1 tsp dried basil and salt and pepper to taste. Dressing was the perfect amount after those changes. Veggie lovers will love this salad. Now it is a keeper.

Made this for Christmas dinner.  The veggies were of course great, seasoning a little off, however, for "our" liking I had to reduce the oregano a bit, used Stevia in place of the regular sugar (dietary reasons) and it was better.  Still most of the family didn't care for the dressing :(

Love this recipe made as is.  I have eaten at the Basque restaurants in Bakersfield, Ca since the 1950s.  This reminds me of their salads.  I will make again and again.

i was looking for a nice light side to go with our dinner and found this.. i ended up doubling the cucumber and tomatoes as i didn't have any red or yellow bell peppers.. i cut the olive oil in half but still felt the dressing was a little heavy.. i think i'm just used to low fat dressings.. i'm making this again today and cut the olive oil to a quarter and am much happier with the dressing.. had to use a combo of balsamic vinegar and apple cider vinegar as i ran out of red wine vinegar yesterday.. it still worked!  i'm looking forward to making this with the full amount of bell peppers.. ty for the recipe

I have made this twice... the first time as the recipe stated and the second time I used red onion and pickled the onion.  Definitely more flavorful the second time!

I love this salad.  I make it without the cucumbers because I don't care for them.  It is absolutely delicious.

This is an excellent way to use those summer veggies from the garden.
