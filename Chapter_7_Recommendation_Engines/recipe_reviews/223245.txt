Putting all the ingredients together made me feel a little leary of this recipe, however, once mixed together and simmering, I could tell it was going to be good and it was. Like the previous reviewer said, it doesn't lack flavor!  I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy and it tasted fine.  I would use less ginger and add some cayenne pepper.  I think adding saut√©ed onions before cooking the chicken would be yummy. Next time I would  add some veggies while simmering, like bell peppers, carrots, etc.  It's a good recipe and kind of reminded me of a thai curry without the added fat of coconut milk. I would definitely make it again.

Instead of parsley I substituted some fresh chopped green onion tops, and laid it over a bed of quinoa with a little extra sauce drizzled on top of it all. So yummy!!! ?? Definitely a permanent part of my favorite recipes now!

First let me say that I am a different Marion than the one comparing this recipe to wallpaper paste. I have made this dish at least 5 times. I always use fresh ginger and include 2 cloves of minced garlic in the sauce.  After I cook the chicken and add sauce, I toss a chopped red pepper and a julienned carrot just for colour. I always put in double the curry 'cause we love it and it is served over vermicelli noodles. VERY delicious dish.

Simple and easy and tasty make. Substituted paprika for curry because I don't like curry. 
Was even better next day after sitting overnight in the fridge.

Tasty sauce.. for me needed a little heat. I think the chicken was a little dried out so I'll cook it less time next time. Leftovers were moister as it had time to absorb some sauce

I approached this recipe with some trepidation but was pleasantly surprised at the outcome. I added extra ginger and black pepper and substituted cumin for curry powder because I really do like spicy foods. Yet I wasn't impressed with the sauce until I added it to the chicken and then it all came together. Next time I will substitute sesame paste for the peanut butter. Not at all bland, that's for sure!

I'd probably give this about 3.5 stars.  Cayenne pepper is a must for me on this one.  I made it without, for the kids, but sprinkled some on top for myself.  The kids ate it, which is awesome.  Nothing amazing for me though.  Decent flavors.  Mostly peanut-buttery though.

I had to make a few modifications due to not having some things in the pantry but the overall recipe was great. Everyone loved it and will now become a regular menu item for our dinners.

My son is learning to cook, and decided to make this last night.  It was super easy to follow and very yummy.  I might add a little kick of spice next time but otherwise it was great.

I may well have gone wrong somewhere, but this turned out like tomato flavored wallpaper paste! I ended up adding a couple of cups of chicken stock, as well as more peanut butter. Not a big hit with anybody.

This was great.  I added a pinch or two of cayenne pepper and cumin to give it a little more heat, based on other reviews recommending to do so. I served it over a bed of rice and sauteed peppers and onions in with the mixture, and it turned out great.  I only cooked the chicken by itself about 2 minutes on each side instead of 3 so that it wouldn't dry out, which worked wonders.  Solid 4/5, but I'm not sure it would have worked without all the suggested tweaks.

This is a really good & quick dish to make. I did change it a little, instead of using curry I substituted with 1/4-1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes. I will definitely make this again
