I agree with the previous reviewer that these taste like cakey snickerdoodles and I wouldn't like it any other way! I made them because I ran out of vanilla and I needed sugar cookies also I used softened butter instead of shortening sour milk for the buttermilk and rolled them in organic sugar. So yummy! Highly recommended.

I thought these cookies tasted great although they tasted more like a cakey snickerdoodle. Delicious will make over and over! I didn't have buttermilk so I used sour cream.

Mixed reviews from the family on this one. They do taste like cakey snicker doodles. Some loved them some didn't. It's a very sticky batter so I just sprinkled some sugar on top. I halved the recipe and got 24 cookies.
