Our family really enjoyed this delicious recipe! 
The cookies and chocolate chips sure give this creamy pie a delicious crunch.

I used chocolate wafers for the crust and added toffee bits to the crust and to the top of the pie. Yummy Jan!

Holy cow, that's a lot of chocolate! I used 1 cup of mini chocolate chips and had a good bit of cookie left over after completely covering the top of the pie. I froze it for about two hours before serving. This is a chocolholic's dream. If you like a very sweet, VERY chocolatey dessert, this is the one for you!

This is incredibly easy to make and a hit with a self-proclaimed chocoholic 3 year old.

This was only ok. No one wanted to wait for it to freeze completely, so we tried it before it was hard and everyone agreed that it was good enough. Once it froze completely no one really wanted to eat it again. The flavors or texture just isn't quite right on this one.

Both my family and my husbands family love this cake.  I am always asked to make it for holiday get togethers.  Great for the kids and easy to make sugar free!!

This is dessert is mediocre - more of a kid's treat. It may be a winner for grandchildren - put them on a sugar high and send them home!

This is an excellent recipe for the chocolate pie lover. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner; and it was so well received that I made it for Sunday dinner, too.
