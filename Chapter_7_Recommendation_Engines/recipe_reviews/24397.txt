I love this recipe. But I made a few modifactions; instead of cayenne I highly recommend either chipotle chili powder or a few chipotles in adobo [to taste; depending on the brand, really]. I also add 1/4 c diced bell pepper or a 4oz can green chilis, 1/2 t garlic powder AND  a bit of fresh or jarred garlic; again to taste.  And definetley use beef or even chicken broth boullion cubes.Disregard the salt requested in this recipe, the taste is much better with the salt from boullion.

I made this for dinner tonight. It was good. Next time tho, I will decrease the amount of chili powder because the soup was too spicy for my children.

This really was a hearty soup. If you're feeding a large family like mine, you would need to double it.  I served it with cornbread, and used cheddar cheese instead.  Wouldn't be opposed to using parmesean cheese in place of it.

This wasn't bad. I was out of corn, and I didn't have anything else I could throw in. I like the flavor of the soup, though. I had to use shredded cheddar cheese, and ketchup in place of the paste, but otherwise made as is. You'll have to crank the heat up to a low boil in order to properly melt the cheese. Then let it simmer for 5 - 10 minutes.

My family loved it! Never made nor heard of hot dog soup but it came out fantastic! The only negative response i got about it was how spicy it was. Otherwise a real hit.

Easy enough so that my young daughter could help me make it.  She's pretty picky when it comes to soups, but she really likes it!  I used just a pinch of sea salt and instead of cayenne pepper, we used red pepper.

This was very easy and quick to make.  It turned out a lot better than i thought it would.  I added more chili and cayenne powder though and added some peas and carrots as well as some string beans.  My family loved it!

didn't care for this at all. The recipe tasted too acidic, salty and overly seasoning of spices and the cheese didn't bind well with the whole recipe. Won't make again. Sorry.
