As written this recipe is too greasy, I got a much nicer result when I subbed a little less than 1/4 cup of canola oil for the shortening.  The waffles turned out very soft and fluffy.

I happen to be out of Crisco, I substituted vegetable oil in equal amounts. For me, the batter was a bit thinner than what I'm used to but the waffles were passable. We liked the flavor that the yogurt gave to these waffles. I think if I make these again, I'd take Sarah May's advice and cut back on the fat called for in this recipe by half.

I thought the flavor was fine, but I don't think all the fat is necessary. I prefer waffles that are light and moist on the inside and lightly crispy on the outside.

Hard to rate this since I changed it a bit per other reviews.  I used 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2 cup shortening.  I also added 1tsp of vanilla for more flavor.  I whipped the eggs before adding everything else.  These were the lightest, fluffy waffels i've ever made and we loved them!

Yum!  I had some extra yogurt that was about to go bad so I decided to give this a try (I did not have high expectations).  I was surprised at how delicious this was!  I used plain yogurt, and 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 all purpose, and about HALF the shortening.  This is my new favorite waffle recipe, thanks for sharing!

Love how easy and simple these were to make. I took the advise of reviewer Sarah-May and subbed out the shortening and replaced with a 1/4 C of oil. It was perfect, they were light, fluffy and not at all greasy.

This is a very good recipe.  It is thick,but it spreads well.It was a very soft waffle. I only used 6Tbsp of melted shorting. They were not greasy at all.  I will be making these again.

makes a little over 4 cups of batter. it took about a cup of batter to make 1 waffle. i would cut back on the shortening as it was a little greasy. but the little one gobbled them up so i will be making again.

Great recipe, except I substituted 1/2 cup melted butter for the shortening, and added an extra 1/2 cup chia seed gel for fiber.
Also for variations, you can add toasted sunflower seeds, chopped cooked ham, sambal oelek (flavored mild chilli paste) and grated cheese.
I also made other waffles with spinach, chopped cook ham, feta cheese and cracked pepper.

A nice crispy waffle made with your favorite yogurt flavor.  I made 2 batches of these to use up yogurt.  The first was as written, using the ff vanilla.  The next was using strawberry.  Both were equally delicious.  I laid them on a cookie sheet until they were frozen, and then bagged them up.  They reheat great in the toaster for breakfast.  I had the waffle iron heat set at medium and it produced a nice golden brown waffle.  Thanks PRINCESSKAROLY for sharing this recipe.  It is a great way to use up yogurt.  It will definitely be repeated in our house.

See ya later box mix!!  This recipe is great, I hate when my waffles are so dry that you need to pour a ton of syrup all over them.  I made with banana cream pie yogurt because thats what I had and they still came out great, couldnt taste the banana.

So fluffy and tangy!  I used plain yogurt, subbed 1/4 cup of coconut oil for the shortening, and added 2 T of sugar and 1 t vanilla extract.  I also added fresh diced strawberries and they were perfect.  A great way to add protein plus you get the tangy flavor without buttermilk.

Rich and tasty.  I used butter instead  of shortening and FF vanilla honey Greek yogurt.  Great breakfast for active people.  On the first waffle I put too much batter in the waffle maker and ended up with a mess.  It does expand quite a bit.

I used only 1/4 coconut oil instead of shortening, and plain yogurt. Added vanilla and a little bit of honey. These were awesome!! I have never made such crispy waffles. I will definitely make waffles with yogurt again.

Great waffles! I only had plain yogurt so I added 1 t vanilla and 1 T sugar. My shortening was butter flavored. Very good with fresh peaches and raspberries on top, thanks so much for the recipe!

I used melted butter instead of shortening, and full fat Greek honey vanilla yogurt. Sooooo fluffy and delicious! I topped these waffles with this: Melt ½ cup of butter in a frying pan, add 3 sliced bananas and cook until bubbly and slightly softened. Stir in 1 cup of pure maple syrup and a sprinkling of cinnamon, and heat through. Luscious, and replaces the usual butter + syrup.

Best Waffles Ever!!!  I have tried so many waffle recipes and waffle mixes and this one is my favorite, hands down.  I only tried this recipe because I had a tub of yogurt that was about to expire and boy, am I glad I did.  Following other reviewers suggestions, I substituted 1/4c. oil instead of shortening.  Also, because I only had plain yogurt I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tbsp of honey.  The batter came together beautifully.  These waffles took longer to cook than most other waffles I've made, about 4.5-5 minutes.  They are so tasty and rich, yet light and fluffy.  Thank you so much for this recipe, it's exactly what I've been looking for!  Perfect waffles!

This was an easy, good tasting waffle recipe. Easy to throw together. I took the advice of a couple of reviews. I replaced the shortening with Canola oil and replaced 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour. I highly recommend doing this. whole The wheat flour adds so much more flavor.

I liked them.  I too added 1 cup wheat and 1/2 c white flour.  Did mostly milk with some greek yoghurt.  Added 1/4 c butter only and vanilla, cloves and a splash of ginger.  They were very hardy and filling.  One  waffle was plenty with fruit topping.

This is a new family favorite. Used Greek yogurt, and so the shortening was fine for me. Very thick batter, but it spreads really well and was fluffy and light.

I was a little lazy the morning I made these and decided to make pancakes instead of dragging out the waffle iron.  Yea, and I used melted butter in place of the shortening. WOW! This recipe is the best I have ever made. My wife raves about them and they are her favorite now.

THE MOST fluffy light waffles ever! 
i used regular yogurt and added a tsp of pure vanilla extract. i also followed the modification and used just 1/4 cup coconut oil instead of the shortening.  absolutely LOVELY!

These are the best waffles I ever made. So light and fluffy. I used Winn Dixie brand Greek  fat free yogurt. I used coconut oil for my shortening. Shared the recipe with my friends.

I was all out of almond milk but had plenty of plain yogurt. Was craving waffles and found your recipe. Did use the other posters' suggestions of using 1/4 C canola oil and chia seeds instead of butter. Also added a dab of brown sugar for extra flavor along with the vanilla. 

Recommend beating the eggs by hand for a few minutes before adding the other ingredients. Thanks for a fab recipe. Will be making it again.

Delicious  Substituted vegetable oil for Crisco, and only used half of what the recipe called for. Added some vanilla extract, since I was using vanilla yogurt. They were amazing. Definitely making these again.

Really soft and wonderful. Had plain yogurt but added vanilla to it.  They were the best soft waffles.

Absolutely perfect! I used butter and normal plain yogurt. The waffles were crisp and had a lovely, rich tast.

These were actually very good.  The batter was a little thick but worked out nicely.

Love these easy waffles! I use plain Greek yogurt (protein!), add vanilla extract and use applesauce for the shortening. I sub applesauce in almost all my baking and everything comes out fluffy and delicious. Can easily add a couple bananas and cinnamon or blueberries or chocolate chips.

Not a big fan of shortening so I used butter instead.  Needed six waffles instead of four but the adjustment made enough batter for ten waffles!  Bakers beware.  Good basic recipe.  Separating the eggs and folding in whipped whites last makes for a superior waffle.

Great recipe! Even with 1/4  c olive oil in place of shortening which I never cook with. Came out fluffy and delicious. I also only had plain Greek yogurt, so I added brown sugar and some vanilla. Came out tasty! Even to my kids!

A little too heavy and didn't crisp up to my preference. I decided to make these because I had yogurt on hand. I probably will not make again.
