Made this delicious recipe last night with a few modifications.  I used "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" from this site instead of pre-made crust, and used fresh mushrooms, carrots, brocolli, beans instead of their frozen counterparts.  I also added granulated onion, some thyme, cheddar cheese, and used only one large potatoe (any more would be overkill).  I didn't have any pie tins to accomodate this big pie, so used a 9x13 casserole instead and it turned out great.  If you are looking for a good chicken pot pie recipe, you can trust that this one will exceed your expectations.

I love that the filling has no "cream of" something soup.  I usually had more chicken and veggies and make 2 pies for my family. And I use whatever veggies I have on hand at the time. It's a big hit here. I poach my chicken breasts in a pot of water with onion and celery and garlic and pepper corns and bay leaves...whatever sounds good at the time. Then I strain that liquid and use it as my chicken broth later, too.

This is a great basic recipe if you want to make a pot pie without using heavy soups or creams.  I changed it a fair amount (mostly b/c I didn't have all the ingredients)& it turned out great.  I added 3 cloves of smashed garlic to the chicken water instead of garlic powder & I didn't have any frozen veggies or celery so I just used a combo of potatoes, baby carrots (which I added to the boiling potatoes) & onions.  Also, instead of a pie crust I topped with biscuit dough.  I only cooked it for approx 30 mins and it was perfect.  Great recipe...both my kids loved it.

Yum!  What a great recipe.  Yes, it is time consuming, but totally worth it.  I made a few changes to the reciple, and it turned out great.  1) I used boneless breasts because that's all I had. 2) I added more garlic salt, a half of a bay leaf, seasoning salt, and pepper to the boiling chicken. 3) I added 6 ounces more chicken broth than called for 4) While the chicken broth/veggie mixture was cooking, I added a few drops of cornstarch mixed with cold water to thicken it.  Next time, I will buy an additional pie crust, because there is plenty of filling for two.

I really changed the recipe. I used all frozen mixed vegetables, I cut up one stalk celery, 1/3 c. frozen onions, satueed them in the butter, added 2 c. frozen vegetables and 1 c. frozen chunk hashbrowns. Cooked for about 5 minutes, then added the flour, cooked until it was a little thick. I added the chicken broth and milk to this, cooked until it became thick. Seasoned it with pepper and celery seed.  I used the 9 inch pie crust, rolled it a little to fit a 10" pie pan, topped it with the other crust, (because other reviews said it made too much filling.) baked it for 45 min. at 350. It was delicious! Will make again.

This recipe was very good.  I used 2 pastry shells and put one into the pie plate and used the other on top. I also added some various other vegetables and made sure to mix the chicken broth with cornstarch, for a little extra thickness.  It was good served over white rice.

This was my first pot pie venture. My husband loved it. Although, we both thought there were too many potatoes. Next time I will just use one large potato and more veggies. I used a store bought crust, one on top and one on bottom. Turned out beautifully.

This recipe made a great Chicken Pot Pie.  I was a little concerned because it did not seem to have much liguid in it - but it turned out great.  Will be making again.

A good basic recipe, to which I made the following changes: skipped the celery (don't like it) and potatoes (didn't have any); I used boneless breasts that I  had cooked earlier in the week; I used 2 crushed garlic cloves instead of garlic powder and sauteed them with the onion; I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to help thicken it up. I also put in a bottom crust. It was delicious and my family loved it tonight! I will make it again but with these same changes.

My husband is allergic to dairy, so this recipe is great b/c most others use canned soup or condensed milk. It is delicious! Certainly doesn't need the dairy.
Dairy eating friends have tried this while over for dinner, and asked me to make them one to take home. Really a big hit!

Absolutely the best Chicken Pot Pie I ever had so far. I was full and still ate another helping because I loved it so much! Didn't even need to serve with rice.  I did add extra garlic powder, more flour with water, onion powder and powdered chicken bouillon to give it a little more flavor and gravy.  I also used a bottom and top crust.  Perfect and will make again and again.  Thank you Chefbuzz. :)

I used the base recipe, but excluded the potatos and used fresh vegetables, carrots, pepppers, mushrooms with the celrey and onions. I added a bit of hot sauce for additional flavor. I liked the single crust recipe for reduced fat.

This chicken pot pie is delicious! I am actually in the process of making it for the second time, but this time, we are trying turkey, instead of chicken. All in all, this recipe is awesome! 5 Stars!

Easy to do! I like how it is a bit healthier than using cream based pot pie. I hope you try it:)

This was SO good.  I used mostly fresh vegetables instead of frozen (only frozen corn and peas) and put chopped red potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, celery, onion, etc in the casserole.  Used a big corningware baking dish instead of a pie plate and covered it with the crust.  Also, used about 1/2 can of cream of mushroom in the filling and used real garlic instead of powder.  Incredibly good and NOT bland at all.

It could have had a little more sauce for me, and I added some Thyme and used fresh garlic. Overall we liked it.

This was super yummy!  And cream free which made me happy!  I used three red potatoes and in place of frozen veggies I used fresh mushrooms, carrots, onions, celery, snow peas (halved the pods), and a clove of garlic.  I sauteed them all for the same amount of time before adding the potatoes and chicken.  The broth and flour thickened up nicely.  I used wheat flour and a whole wheat pie shell which I just flipped upside down over the filling.  Very good!

My partner said this was the best pot pie he's ever had! I used a homemade crust  and messed with the ingredients a bit: Instead of the frozen veggies, I sauteed a cup of chopped carrots with the celery and onion then added a cup of canned beans. I also threw in the leftover broccoli casserole from Thanksgiving, which gave it a slightly cheesy flavor. Since I won't have that next time, I think I'll add a bit of cheese to the mix.  This made enough filling for TWO pies, so make or buy some extra crust!

This is an excellent pie. Believe it or not I took one of those store-bought, already cooked chickens, ate the chicken with my roommate and then took the remains, added some herbs and water and boiled the chicken. I then drained the broth, reserved it, and picked the bones until all the meat was gone. I always use whatever fresh and frozen veggies I have on hand. If you want to fit the pie into a 9" crust you have to go a little lighter on the veggies. To reduce calories you can sub out more veggies for potatoes. A sweet potato might also work. I always use Canola instead of vegetable oil. And I cheat, I use store bought crusts instead of making my own. I have made my own and it's much better. Outstandingly good. Rib stickin' for big eaters.

This is a wonderful recipe, although I agree with the comments about reducing the amount of potatoes.  I also eliminated the celery and instead added Italian Squash.  I also used fresh garlic and included it in the mix, as well as the chicken seasoning.  I added some rosemary (just a touch) and I like the added flavor.

Yummy, yummy! I wanted to prepare some meals that freeze well (finals are coming soon!) and thought this looked like a winner.  I almost never cook meat, but I thought this recipe was very easy.  Only variations: I added a few good shakes of dried thyme, and I only used two lg. potatoes.  I split the filling into two regular (not deep dish) pie plates and topped with a frozen whole wheat crusts.  I divided the two pies into 8 portions, of which I froze six.  This is tasty, healthy, budget-friendly comfort food.  What else could you ask for?

I love this option of not using a 'cream of' soup.  I just season the water I cook the chicken in and use if for the broth.  I also decided to serve this over pasta.  Someone else said they served it over rice, so I thought I'd give this a try.  Tasty!

Only used fresh veggies - no frozen. One potato used and only two chicky breast halves would have been enough. Even though I baked in individual dishes, the cooking time didn't need much adjustment. This is a great recipe - the only thing I wasn't wild about was all the pre-cooking.

I made this with a few minor changes, mainly different vegetables and less potatoes.  I also used turkey leftovers instead of chicken and it worked great.   It was a delicious pot pie but I prefer a little thicker and tastier filling  so next time I will sub cream of chicken for the broth and flour.

Very much enjoyed this pie. I had left-over turkey from our holiday meal so I substituted that for the chicken. I also cut the recipe in half, using only one potato. But this wound up being a little to dry so I added 1/2 c. more broth to 1/2 TBS. flour and added it to the turkey and vegetable mix. This recipe will be one of my repeats!

Dont bother with the can of broth. Use the water that you boiled your chicken in. Just add a bay leaf, pepper, oinion powder and whatever other spices you like in the water and boil it with the chicken. A 14.5 ounce can yeilds 1 cup of broth. So just use 1 cup of your homemade broth!

This is a good recipe. One of my favorite parts of pot pie is the crust, so I prefer it with a bottom and top crust. Adding the bottom crust didn't change the cooking time. I also prefer making my own crust, so I did that. Aside from these minor things, I followed the recipe closely. The truth is that making a pot pie is really more about a technique than carefully following a recipe, and some changes are easy to accommodate. That said, I got a real laugh when the top rated comment made a COMPLETELY different recipe. Sorry to disagree with all the upward turned thumbs, but completely changing the published recipe (cheddar cheese is great, but totally changes the spirit of the original), and then reviewing it, is NOT providing a useful review of the recipe. The reviewer would be better off just publishing her/his new recipe instead.

I have never really liked chicken pot pie, but after trying this recipe I learned it was possible to not only like it but love it.  I love being able to add my own mix of vegetables and only use as much salt as I like.  This tastes much better than the frozen pre-made chicken pot pie I grew up eating.

This was absolutely the best recipe!! I also love how I didn't need a "cream of something" soup. I actually didn't have the 14.5 oz can of broth, only 10 oz. and used the actually broth from my chicken to make it the right consistency. Everything about the recipe was perfect. I especially enjoyed the taste and smell of cooking the fresh celery and onion. It added the right flavor to the whole thing! I loved that I could make it using whatever vegetables I had on hand and instead of pie crust I used pre-packaged biscuit dough for the top crust. Still turned out absolutely PERFECT! Will definitely do this again! Everyone loved it and it was actually comparable to my mother-in-laws (which everyone brags about):D

Thank you! As a kid, we used to eat the store bought pies and I liked them. However, when I introduced it to my children they never cared for them. I came across this recipe while searching for something different to make with the left over chicken I had. This recipe was perfect for me as I had all ingredients on hand. I added another crust on the bottom and pre-cooked it first before adding in filling. I also used cornstarch instead of flour and added a little more chicken broth as it appeared on the dry side. It came out PERFECT and my now adult daughter and her fiance as well as my husband (a picky eater) totally loved it. Will definitely be making this on a regular basis. Mahalo Again!! Keep creating!!

This is really bland unless you add lots of salt and peper I also added some thyme. With that said I will make it again but I will double the liquid it was a little dry for us.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this was very runny and made way too much filling for my pie plate. Still, the taste was very good. I left out the onion and celery but followed the rest of the directions. Next time I will use less chicken broth or add a can of cream of chicken soup.

This was delicious!  The only down-side is that it takes a while to prepare, but it was worth it.  I left out the celery and used canned peas and fresh carrots in place of the mixed veggies, and it was wonderful.  I also added some rosemary to the seasonings for extra flavor.  I will definitely be saving this recipe and making it again.

It was good but had too much potato and needed more flavor! Perhaps adding some chopped garlic or bell pepper would do the trick. other than that-yummy down home dish.

This was quick and easy to make, and we liked it.  I did a few things differently.   I roasted the chicken rather than poaching it.  I also added about 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning to the onion while it was sauteed.  I probably used a generous 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and lots of salt.  When I found I had too much filling and not enough sauce added about 1/3 cup of heavy cream.  Good stuff!!

This is a really good home-made pot pie. I would suggest using less onions and celery. I thought the flavor was a little overwhelming. I will use 1 stalk of celery next time and 1/2 the onion. But overall, this is easy to make and delicious. And much healthier than using cream of chicken soup like other recipes.

My fiance loved this pie! The recipe was easy to follow and I liked the way it didn't use canned soup as the sauce base. Suggest you add seasoning to suit or it's a bit bland - I used rosemary, pepper and plenty of salt.

This was the best Chicken Pot pie that i have ever had. It was really easy to make and didn't take to much prep time. I only used two potatoes and used chicken tenders, also i used roasted garlic chicken broth instead of the garlic powder. My family enjoyed it very much. Thank you.

This is not the easiest recipe . . . but I can't help but return to it time and time again.  It's great for the picky 6 year old eaters in my family.  A complete meal!  Highly recommended.

Yum!  I'm lactose intolerant, but I can eat this recipe.  It's so YUMMY!!!  Usually I only have room for 2 potatoes, and I omit the celery.  If you are a messy chef, this recipe can get messy...but it is well worth it!

I used a whole left over chicken for this, simmering it for a nice broth and a homemade pie crust.

pretty good, but needs some herbs to add extra flavor.  ***also, why use canned chicken stock when you can use the water you boiled the chicken in?  after removing the chicken, just boil the water down until you're left with 1.5 cups, and use that rather than canned stock for a more homemade taste.

This is by far a family favorite.  My husband doesn't normally like Chicken Pot Pie, but he requests this one.  I buy the frozen crust bottoms and then the rollout tops from the deli case.  (We like a lot of crust)  When I made this the first time, I did it just as instructed.  I found it a little dry.  The next time I added extra cornstarch to the vegetables and then extra chicken broth.  It was much better.  It even reheats well.  We look forward to leftovers for lunch the next day.  It definatly makes enough for 2 pies!

This recipe is easily two pot pies in one. I had to bake mine in a 9X13 pan and top with two pie crusts. I added a few spices like poultry seasoning and next time I will add thyme. Also, baby potatoes, either red or yellow, work very well. I will be making again, and since it makes so much I will try freezing and topping with biscuits.

My Junior Girl Scout troop made this and had a lot of fun.  We used whole wheat crust and baked it for 45 minutes then froze it for a week and then finished cooking.  It was beautiful and good tasting.  There was way too much filling though.

Excellent,easy and delicious. I will add a little more chicken broth next time to get more gravy.  My boyfriend loved it, he ate more than half of the pie.   I will be making the recipe again next week.  Thank you.

This works great with leftover turkey, ham, or chicken. I forgot peas but it wasn't missing it and I added broccoli. I used low-sodium broth, two peeled red potatoes and it all fit into a 9-inch pie plate perfectly. Rolled boxed pie crusts worked well. An egg wash is of course optional. Such a nice low-sodium option on a winter's day.

I've made this recipe a couple of times and since it is just my husband and I, I put the ingredients into two medium sized ramkins. That way we each get our own. The only reason I took a star off is because it can use a few other spices for flavor. I add whatever I feel like at the time.

The recipe was great and easy to follow. I didn't use any potatoes since my hubby doesn't really care for them in pot pie and I added some of my own seasoning choices. Used both a bottom and top crust I made myself. The pie turned out really well. Next time, though, we are going to use cream instead of broth to make the gravy. The cream gives it a better flavor to us. But, overall, very good:)

This was amazing! I didn't use potatoes and I cooked boneless skinless chicken breasts in the oven, and then shredded it. Other than those changes, i followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful taste!  Made a lovely Valentine's Dinner for my family, the kids loved it.  Not too heavy tasting, fresh and full of flavor.

I roasted a chicken a couple days a head of time and that's what I used rather than boiling.  I wanted double the recipe but the only thing I didn't double was the potatoes.  

I substituted Vegetable oil with butter, and I like my veggies tender so I simmered longer about 10 minutes before adding the potatoes.  I substituted the flour with corn starch and waited until after I added the chicken broth to add it.

Take about a 1/2 cup of milk or use a 1/2 cup of chicken broth in a seperate measuring cup or bowl, take 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and beat it until blended.  When broth is at a rolling boil just add the mixture while stirring until thickened.

It's also important to taste test to make sure you added enough salt,pepper and garlic powder.

I also used a bottom and a top crust.

I made this for my wife's friend who is battling cancer.  I wanted something that would be a comforting food.  I didn't actually try this, but my wife said it got rave reviews when she cooked it and served it for dinner at their house.  I personally would have added some additional spices, and some soup.  I don't think it had the texture I was exactly looking to achieve, but as long as they liked it.

I am in the minority I guess - this did not have enough "sauce" and was bland. Unfortunately I made a lot extra and froze it. So when I make this again from my frozen stash, I'll add something else to it - maybe a half can of cream of chicken soup (which was what I was trying to avoid in the first place with this healthy recipe) and some additional pepper. UPDATE: I added a whole can of cream of chicken soup and additional pepper and this recipe was MUCH better.

I made this for dinner last night and it was a hit. I used boneless chicken breasts and 2 potatoes but kept to the recipe for the other ingredients.  There was enough filling for two pies so I have one in the freezer. There wasn't very  much liquid so I ended up thickening another can of chicken stock and pouring it over the filling before covering with the pie crust. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great meal.  I like the fact that you use only 1 pie crust top.  I was out of carrots, so I added bok choy, red bell pepper, and corn to the other ingredients. I also added a bit of grated pepper jack cheese.  It was yummy.  I kept going back for more!  My husband also liked it and want me to make it again.  A good hearty, winter meal.

Excellent! Hubby and I both enjoyed your recipe very much. We added a little more potato and some fresh garlic and it was super. Great leftovers too, even better the second day!

I made this last night for dinner and followed the recipe exactly except added a pinch of salt and pepper and used a bag of the frozen mixed vegitables. This was a perfect recipe and is a definite keeper.

This was a good chicken pot pie.. however I used my own pastry which made it better. I made a few extra and froze them.. very successful.

Simply Perfect! I'm not usually a fan of Chicken Pot Pie but my boyfriend loves it. I searched high and low for a "good for you" recipe. I've made it a couple times now and it just get better and better. The only changes I make is adding some more spices (more garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, kosher salt) and 15  minutes before its done I brush the pie down with some egg yolk for the extra crunch. Love it!

This was a great recipe.  I was looking for one that does not contain a canned cream soup.  A little time consuming but totally worth it.  I made individual pies and my husband loved them.

I made this tonight. It was a lot of work for just a so so dinner. It would have been much better if it had more gravy. I had to bake for an addition 1/2 hour and my pie crust still didn't brown.

My DH loves Chicken Pot pie, so I decided to make this for him. He said it was bursting with flavor and he loved it. I left the celery out (DH hates celery), but he loved this. It is a little involved to make the "innards" but it makes a LOT...so I put half in a pie and froze the rest for another night! :) DH gives this recipe five burps! :) (That is how we rate the goodness of the food *LOL*)

Yummy! My husband LOVED this pot pie. I was looking for one that did not involve any cream soups and this was the first I found. I altered a few things...but nothing that would take away from the core of this great, basic recipe. Thanks so much!

Followed the exact recipe and everyone (Mom, Dad, two kids-7 and 10) loved it. So much better than any recipe with "cream of" soups. Also super simple to put together. This one will go in to our family meal rotation.

I'm embarassed, I found this recipe a couple of years ago, have made it many, many times and never rated or reviewed. I typically only review to say thanks for posting. Thanks! My kids request it before they come home from school.My go- to comfort food. I love that it has no cream soups. Always made as written, with the exception that sometimes I'll use a store bought rotisserie chicken. Thanks again.

Good stuff! Took the original recipe and added spices from other pot pie recipes on this site. (I use spices per taste, start w/a little and, if not enough, add more). Didn't have cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom. Also, when I boiled my bone-in split chicken breasts, I always keep the skin on for added flavor, chicken needs all the help it can get due to its blandness. I had more than could fit in pie crust so I used the extra as sort of a thickened soup to which I added about 1/2 box of cooked bow tie noodles(my hubby loves his starches! Dutch!!). Used refrigerated Pillsbury pie crust, using both, baking bottom bottom one prior to adding cooled filling. Will make again! Great comfort food!

I make this with "Ruth's Grandma's Pie crust" and it's fantastic. I also use leftover roast chicken to simplify thing.

I followed the recipe with the exception of how I prepared my chicken and the crust. I used 2 HUGE chicken breasts, added onion, garlic, rosemary, and I used chicken base. I like it so much better than the granulated stuff. I wasn't sure if my bowls are oven safe, so I wound up using 2, 6 inch cast iron skillets, and I also used puff pastry. This is what a chicken pot pie should be. Thanks for sharing.
