These cookies are so good and so easy to make. They taste like the Girl Scout's Thin Mints. (if you don't like mint try plain kisses, they are still yummy) I used as little dough as possible to cover the kisses and got at least 6 dozen cookies out of the recipe. My only complaint was the amount of flour made them a little bit dry so I'll probably reduce the amount next time, but even that didn't affect the taste. Iâ€™ll definitely be making these again.

These are very easy to make.  They are almost like chocolate shortbread around the mint kiss.  We thought they tasted better the day after they were made.  The only thing we didn't like was that they are a bit flour-y.  Also, we thought the cookies that only had just enough dough around them to cover the candy tasted the best.

DELICIOUS!!!!!!! I used 1 2/3c - 1 3/4c flour since other comments said to use less. I did some without the powder sugar & great also.  Had to put in the freezer so we didn't eat them all right away.  May try just the cookie part (without mints) for chocolate cookies.

I made these cookies for a Christmas party.  Most people thought they were awesome.  They were a hit.  The dough was sticky when I first tried to handle it.  I refrigerated it until it was chilled and the dough was much more pliable and easy to handle.  If the dough is chilled, the cookies probably will not spread as much.

These are delicious!!!  Loved by everyone.  I followed this recipe exactly as it was written and had no problems at all!!  The cookies were easy to make and baked quickly.  When it came to the powdered sugar, I dumped a bit into a Ziploc bag and rolled about five cookies around at a time.  Saves on mess and time.  These cookies were taken to the office and were gone in no time at all.  Also, the recipe was requested by many of my co-workers.  I will make these cookies again!!

I think these cookies taste fantastic, especially when hot (but not right out of the oven - the melty kiss will BURN your tongue!) These cookies were a big hit, with or without powdered sugar (some liked it without.) 

I accidentally melted my butter beforehand, and mine turned out great - the cookies looked somewhat like chocolate truffles, and didn't expand very much, but had some great semi-crunchy parts. 

However, I have a big complaint about how long it takes to make these cookies - it took me a ridiculous amount of time, because I was trying to cover each kiss completely, and the dough would get very crumbly and dry. I really recommend this recipe, but only if you have an ample amount of time to make it.

I made two batches of these and thought they turned out really well and tasted great.  One batch I tried reducing the flour to 1 3/4 cup and they didn't hold their "ball" shape. So I personally can't recommend reducing the flour.  I think it depends on how you measure your flour (I spoon the flour into the measuring cup rather than scooping it out of the container).  I wouldn't recommend using milk or egg, this will alter the chemistry of the recipe.  Make sure your butter is VERY soft before you start and use a smaller amount of dough to cover each kiss.  Don't overcrowd the cookie sheet, they won't rise but they will spread just a little bit.  I think these will go over well at my cookie exchange!

This is a great recipe if you do a couple of things. Use cake and pastry flour instead of all purpose it tends to be a little more moist. Add an extra tsp of Vanilla.  Also I couldn't find Mint Kisses so I used Hugs instead, I would of liked a little more of a minty taste but these were a great replacment.  Everyone loved the results.  This will be a family favorite.

My grandaughter and I made these cookies last week and they were not a big hit.  They didn't have much taste and the chocolate cookie part was rather dry and crumbly. We won't be making these again.

I loved the kisses themselves.. tasted to me just like the thin mint girl scout cookies. As far as the actual cookies, they were good but I could only take but so much of the sweetness. I ate some and sent the rest with my husband to work so I wouldn't gain too much weight. Very addictive!

I don't think I will keep this one around, I did not like this cookie at all. My husband did though so I guess it takes a certain kind of taste. It was very floury (I even reduced the flour to 1 3/4 cup per other review suggestion)and minty. I knew it was going to have a mint flavor, and I like mint flavor, but this was extreme!!! I already threw the recipe away.

We found these cookies to be pretty dry (as with previous reviewers, I would suggest lessening the amount of flour) and the mint flavor was really overwhelming.  If you are a big mint lover, you will probably like them, however.  I may make them again at Christmas and try regular kisses, as suggested.

I don't think I will ever make this again. I was so excited to make these - they sounded so wonderful. The dough was so dry (I used 1 1/2 cups flour) that I couldn't get it to stick to the kisses. If you make this add some more liquid - don't just lessen the flour. Add an egg or milk or something cause you're going to need the moisture. Difficult and frustrating to work with and not that fabulous tasting because of the cookies being so dry. I'm still disappointed.

Great cookie!! From the look of these cookies, you would think they are the original "snowball" cookie....but what a tasty difference! Loved the mint kiss in the middle. Some people did say that they taste like the girl scout cookie "thin mints". Will make these again! Delicious!

These are marvelous - pretty much chocolate shortbread with a chocolate surprise inside!  I agree with the other reviewer who suggested that the butter be VERY soft - I accidently over-microwaved the butter so it was practically liquid, but in doing so the dough was extremely pliable, no dryness problem here!  I decided to forgo the powdered sugar, and instead drizzled coloured icing over them.

I liked these so much I am making them with mint (with green icing), hugs (white icing), and almond kisses (red icing).  :-)

DELISH! A great cookie for us chocolate mint lovers... It's like Andes Candies in cookie form. I found the dough a bit dry, but not too hard to work with and actually a good compliment to the melted kiss inside. Also, my cookies didn't keep their ball shape. They flattened out quite a bit during baking, but the texture and flavor was fine. We'll do this one again and again, even though it can be a messy and time-consuming recipe. The YUM factor makes it all worth while.

These were by far the hit for this holiday season. The kids loved being able to help and the taste was wonderful. I just sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar and they gave a rich look when mixed with other hoiday cookies.
Brought back memories of those special times when the kids got an Andes mint candy.
Definately something to make all year round.

this recipe has always worked great for me, we enjoyed them with and without the icing sugar on them.  I baked for a valentines dinner cookie contest, and they won first prize. One of the judges explained it as biting into a moist cookie with a soft chocolaty surprise :)   (I haven't ever been able to find mint hersheys, so I used hershey hugs instead).

We could not find the mint Kisses, so we substituited almond Kisses and added mint extract to the cookie dough.  They turned out very good.

I agree with the reviewers that suggest wrapping a small amount of dough around the kiss.  I followed that advice and made no other changes to the recipe and they turned out great.  Everyone liked them.  I will make these again.

This was a very easy recipe however I did find that the amount of dough for the amount of kisses was not quite enough but it was so easy to just make more--they were great--even my 2yr old thought they were good. Not too minty but just right.

I tried a new cookie recipe last year for the holiday baking season, I happen to find this recipe and decided to try it. It is now a keeper according to my family. We even tried using a Caramel candy in replace of the Mint Kiss, they are also very good. With this cookie you will need a tall glass of milk.

I just made these today! My dough was not dry, and I scooped 1 Tbl of dough and formed it around each kiss. Really easy for me to make. The only problem, was they flattened out some during the baking. I've had one to taste, and it's yummy!

Even after reading the reviews, I decided to try this.  My husband loves these mint kisses!  I had to add milk to make the batter workable, but even so, the flavor of the dough was horrible, as was the texture.  The best part was the melted mint kiss.  I won't make these again.

Unlike other reviews, my batter seemed to be too wet.  (I live in Florida, made the cookies on a rainy day - lots of moisture in the air.)  They didn't stay in balls but spread out.  End result:  the cookies were still dry and crumbly.  Everyone loved them because of the kiss - next time I'll make a good chocolate cookie and put the kiss on top.

Awesome Cookies.  My hubby loved them.  I made a few changes. I also used a teaspoon of almond extract and 1/2 cup coconut and 2 teaspoon of orange juice.   Next time I will use more Cocoa because I  didn't feel there was enough chocolate in the dough. I covered the kisses with the dough after refridgerating the dough for a half hour.

I made the batch half mint and half regular.  personally, I thought that the regular ones tasted better.  As far as the complaints about the batter being too dry, If you just hold it in your hand for a few second and press it together, the butter melts and it is easy to wrap the kisses.  I also preferred to leave the powdered sugar off.

Not good at all.  Dough was fairly easy to mold around cookies, simple recipe.  But cookie part was fairly grainy and mushy.  Not a pleasant texture at all.  I ended up sending them to work with my husband hoping someone might like them, and they were practically untouched.

This cookie was a hit!  When I couldn't find the Herhey's Mint Kisses I used Hershey's Hugs and Rollo's in the middle.  They were both great.  Also, rolled the dough ball in the powdered sugar before baking.

Very good...I would give a 5 but it is so sinful so it gets a 4. I could 3 or 4 at a time and knowing each one had a whole Hershey's Kiss in it made me feel like a pig. My mom and sister loved them. I didn't have to throw any out like some cookies I make.

I did not like these at all.  I tried to use all of the flour and it started to get too dry, so I went ahead and made them.  It took a lot longer for them to cook, and then they tasted awful.  The only sweet part was the kiss- which is excellent!

I make these cookies every Christmas and I love them.  I have never had to change the recipe I think it works as is...I just smoosh the dough together with my hands to get it sticky before wrapping it around the cookie and it works well.  My only warning...don't put them in a cookie jar with other kinds of cookies because the other cookies will pick up the mint taste!  All in all a great cookie! :)

These cookies were VERY time consuming but turned out very tasty.  Didn't find the dough to be dry at all and was pretty easy to work with.  Loved the mint flavor!

Made this recipes from the back of the kisses bag a few years ago and have been searching for it again ever since!  Simple to make and totally delicious!
