Doesn't get any better than this!! I make this about once a month and it's SO worth the time. Every time.

Notes: Don't substitute a different kind of tripe. Use the beef, honeycomb. I've tried other types. It's just not nearly as good. I also cook the tripe in my pressure cooker. I'm sure its not necessary. But I think it makes it a lot more tender. Maybe it's just my pan, but I've found that using 1.5 cups of reserved tripe liquid in the 1st round (pancetta mixture) prevents some burning. I frequently also substitute a high quality, thick cut bacon for pancetta. Lastly, I like the dish a little more spicy, so I use 1 1/2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes.

Love love  love it.  It very much reminds me of a cassoulet exccept  the fact it is not baked.  I would do this again.  It could also be done with other meats such as pork.

OK , I made it 50 years ago with grandmother , Bidigetta ZandegiacomodeLugano , but it was amazing !  The problem is getting good honeycomb tripe .  Please don't order the tripe in milk that costs a mint online .  And screw the pancetta , use bacon . The tripe comes from the reticulum , or second stomach of a bovine . I am now working with a local large-animal veterinarian to find a source near me . The recipe here looks good , and I will use it as soon as I can . Nice dish for the Holidays if you know some adventurous eaters .

Fantastic! Tender and delicious. The mint added a unique flavor to the dish. Made it according to the directions, and it was superb.

Recipe was good, I didn't use pancetta and it was still flavorful.
