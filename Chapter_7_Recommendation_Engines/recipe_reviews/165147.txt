okay, not a big hit.  ended up throwing out alot of it.  they turned out a lot thinner than i was thinking and they were way sticky.  i love sweet but these were almost too sweet.  won't make again.

I followed this recipe to a T and found this to be overly sticky! The sweetened condensed milk didn't hold its shape. It was just too sweet. YUCK
