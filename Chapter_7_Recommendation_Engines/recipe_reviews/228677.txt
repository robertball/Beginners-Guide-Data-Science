Delicious! I salted and re-salted these and let them sit for a few hours while doing other things in the kitchen. I put them on a cookie cooling rack over a sheet pan so the water could drip out. I turned them and salted again. I squeezed all the extra water out with paper towels. I didn't rinse them as instructed. I I felt like that would make them wet again. I hand grated the parmesan and used nutritional yeast instead of ground almonds -not quite a half cup. My oven had been on a long time so it was nice and toasty. These came out perfectly! A delicious low carb craving satisfier!

My family requested to have these again. They loved them! The only thing that I need to figure out is how to make them a little more firm. They got kind of soggy and they stuck to the pan so the crispy bottoms came off and stuck.

If you are seriously counting carbs, pay attention to the recipe servings listed.  This recipe is for 6 servings, so one serving would only be 3/8ths of a zucchini for 4.5 grams of carbs.  Great recipe for those of us on Atkins who are missing fried junk food...

This recipe was good, but wasn't quite what I expected. In my opinion the herbs were too much, I am going to cut down on them by 25% or so next time. Or maybe even use fresh herbs instead of dried. It's possible I did something wrong as I did bake about 5 minutes longer than specified here (my oven is weak and often takes longer), but all the herbs came out very bitter tasting. 

If you are a family who has always raised your children on health food options like these, (assuming you don't mess the herb taste up like I did) your kids will probably like these just fine. This is not however, a recipe to offer children who are being slowly moved into healthier eating. It clearly tastes like something meant to be healthy.

I thought the breading came out crispy enough, I actually enjoyed the texture. Someone commented that the breading sticks to itself better than the zucchini and my comments to that would be 1) make sure your zucchini is drained well enough and 2) makes sure you give the egg a moment to drip off before dipping into breading. It sticks to itself because it becomes too infiltrated by the egg. I had this problem near the end when the constant dipping had transferred quite a bit of egg into the breading bowl.

Overall I personally liked it, but I will use fresh herbs next time if they are available to me or cut down on the dry. I will also add a little more parmesan, and slice a little thinner to get a more thoroughly crisped outcome.

Very good, would definitely make again.  I think the key is letting the zucchini drain for about an hour.  I also tranferred them to a paper towel.  I ground almonds in my coffee grinder and it worked great.  You need to eat them right away as they aren't good cold.

We are low carbing to shred a few lbs. and these were great.  I had Almond meal on hand so used it instead of crushed almonds.

Will make this again!  I left some pieces when chopping the almonds, and glad that I did, as it added a little more crunch to the fries.  I added a little Old Bay and some garlic powder as well.

Loved this recipe.  I am usually disappointed by all the "faux french fry" recipes used with veggies since they either come out too soggy, or bland, or just not as expected.  This recipe however is great.  I followed the directions exactly as they are listed here.  I was able to use my food processor to grind the almonds so I just threw in the Parmesan with the almonds to make my life easier.  The zucchini drained nicely, I patted it dry to help get rid of excess moisture.  I breaded the slices and baked as directed and they came out delicious and pretty crispy, not soggy or bland, just perfect.

These are fantastic... actually addictive like real fries.  The trick is to make sure they are coated well and put them on a rack then on a cookie sheet so they are crispy.  I will definitely make them again.

Delicious. But do have to make sure they drain for an hour. We can't wait to make them again.

I like these a lot.  But I don't need low carb, so when I didn't have the ground almonds, I just used Italian bread crumbs instead of the almond & Parmesan & Italian seasoning.  They were much lighter, still crispy, and very good. The next batch, I added a little Parmesan to the crumbs.  Only slightly heavier, a little more flavorful.  Really easy to do.

The zucchini fries were yummy, will probably beef up the seasoning next time, maybe with garlic and basil. Will most surely try these again. Had them as a side with allrecipes pineapple chicken tenders, great combo. Thanks for the recipe!

Very happy with how the fries came out! I let the zucchini strips dry for about an hour but did not rinse the salt off with water. I just wiped them and squeezed all the water out. I only needed 1 egg, as well as 1/4c almond meal, 1/4c whole wheat panko crumbs, and 1/8c parmesan cheese. I roasted the fries for about 20mins and they came out with a crunchy coating. I will definitely make these again.

Nice change - these weren't hard to make and they tasted pretty good too. Got mine to turn out crispy outside without being mushy inside.

Love the fact that these are made with almond flour instead of white flour. I cut the recipe in half for a trial run and only used 1 teaspoon of salt and rinsed well before coating and they seemed very salty. I used the canned Parmesan because I didn't have fresh on hand and I think freshly grated would have been so much better. I think I would cut back on the Parmesan next time also, maybe use 1/2 of what is called for. I baked as directed and they were slightly crisp right out of the oven. Eat right away or they will go limp on you. With a little adjusting of the salt and Parmesan these could be pretty tasty.

The coating clumps more to itself than to the zucchini, but the zucchini with the prep does stay nice.

These were ok. I think they'd be better if cut thinner and cooked less. Also definitely needs salt.  Next time: cut cucumber in thirds then cut each of those into 8 or more long pieces.

These were wonderful!  I crushed almonds myself with a meat tenderizer so they were a bit course but it was all great.  I think I didn't use enough salt so I added after cooking and I didn't use parchment, just aluminum foil sprayed and cooked in the toaster oven. I may try my hand at a dipping sauce for them.  Thanks for sharing.

I used almond flour and it turned out crunchy. Also used stoneware flat pan. That helped with the crispiness. Yucky cold. Eat em hot!!

Whole family enjoyed them very much! Make sure to put  toppings in a very wide dish for rolling the zucchini so it doesn't clump after the first few.

This recipe was pretty good.  I didn't follow the recipe to the letter.   I didn't have any italian seasoning so I used basil and oregano, black pepper and garlic powder.  I also used olive oil so the fries fried a little to make them crispy.  Overall I would make this again but i think I won't cut the zucchini as thin...

I made it according to the recipe and thought it was just okay.  They were crispy, but lacking in flavor.  Maybe more seasoning in the dry ingredients would help...like some granulated garlic.  Probably won't make them again.

These were amazing, especially dipped in ranch dressing. I threw a bit of garlic salt into the breading mix, came out fantastic. Will definitely be making these on a regular basis.

I didn't set for an hour, I just baked at 250 for 15 min. Then I increased temp to 450 for 10 min. Crispy & delicious. I also used my baking stone, no need to turn.

Loved these!! I let them sit for an extra hour, used almond flour instead of crushed almonds, and added a lil Old Bay Seasoning. They came out amazing!

I'm removing this recipe from "my favorites". I didn't care for the flavor. The fries may taste better with a dip but I'm following low-carbs right now and couldn't come up with a good dipping sauce.
