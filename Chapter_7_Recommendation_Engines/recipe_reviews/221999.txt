This is a great generic curry recipe for the braise king: beef short ribs. In the heat of summer, I browned the ribs over charcoal, getting a good carmelization, losing some of the fat, and adding a subtle smokey flavor. Since the chef advises tasting and adjusting flavors, the rest of the recipe is right on target. Served with an aromatic basmati rice cooked with cardamom pods and whole cloves, this was a hit with my wife.

This made a terrific Sunday dinner! One of those recipes that makes the whole house smell good while making. Also because there is no starch, you don't feel bogged down after eating. Definite keeper!

Oh my goodness!  This was crazy good, 10 stars good.  I had about 3 lbs of boneless short ribs and used Vindaloo curry powder instead of the red curry paste and this was wonderful!  The only thing I may do differently next time is double the amount of sauce.  I also didn't think to review the video once again before making this dish and did not cover the Dutch oven when it went into the oven (the printed recipe did not specify this detail) and my cauliflower took 15 minutes on the stovetop instead of the 5 mentioned in the recipe.  I almost skipped the star anise because it smelled like liquorice, but I am so glad I stuck with the recipe as written.  This is definitely a keeper and will be made often in our home.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Just tried this recipe, but used a slow cooker.  Added at least 3 more tablespoons of red curry for more flavor.  Removed the meat.  Separated the fat from the liquid.  Boiled the cauliflower in the liquid for 5 minutes.  Then finished reducing the liquid and added a small amount of cornstarch to thicken.  Delicious and flavorful.

Well I forgot to take a photo because I ate them.  Boyfriend and I loved the recipe.  I made half the portion and had to add more coconut milk because there wasn't enough sauce.  Was a good way to use cauliflower instead of potato.  The aromatics stimulate your appetite.

Great way to use short ribs.  Used diced tomatoes in place of the tomato paste. Enjoyed trying some new spices - star anise and garam masala.  Wonderful Fall comfort food served with rice.  Freezes well for future dinners.

This was REALLY good.  My traditional Irish family really enjoyed it - even my husband who doesn't really like cauliflower.  I followed recipe exactly.  If you want a spicier dish I would suggest adding more red curry paste and/or cayenne pepper.  I would definitely make this again.

This was the first short rib recipe I ever tried, and it's still one of my favorites.  I add carrots and potatoes to make it a cross between curry and beef stew.  I also use curry powder, whisked into the veg oil in the recipe, instead of curry paste.  This is a hit with the hubby.

This was a big hit with my husband, who loves spicy, flavorful food! I was heavy-handed on the spices & may have kicked it up a bit with extra spices, but otherwise followed the recipe. I will definitely make again.

I didn't have any fish sauce.   I seasoned short ribs with a rub of tumeric,  cumin, paprika, cayenne,  chili powder,  coriander, salt and black pepper.    Instead of cauliflower, I used carrots, turnips and string beans.   Absolutely delicious.  Will try again with the fish sauce and cauliflower.

Hadta make a coupla changes. I had boneless short ribs (poor me [LOL]) and I woulda sworn I had star anise hidden in the back of the cupboard but no; so I used 1/4 teaspoon fennel seed. (A fair substitution for star anise.). Just follow Chef John's video. (Ya can't go wrong with Chef John.)  Make sure you cut the cauliflower into bite size pieces or it'll take longer for the cauliflower to cook and soften.  Ya might wanna consider doubling the sauce and maybe forgo the initial salt especially if you're gonna use fish sauce. I thought it was a tad salty. Like John said in the video, this is not your typical Indian or Thai curry but very good nonetheless.  I am always looking for good uses for beef short ribs (my favorite piece of beef) and this is definitely a keeper which I will certainly make again. Thanks, John.

I followed the recipe without making any changes.  The three hour duration for cooking in the oven as given in the recipe should be adjusted according to how well the beef is cooked.

The only change I made was to use turnips instead of cauliflower, which I added in the last 1 hour of cooking. Also, I checked the curry after every hour, and 2 hours was enough. The meat fell off the bone and was tender and moist, the sauce was delicious and quite silky. It was amazing! We ate the curry with lightly toasted whole wheat pita and some garlic saut√©ed spinach . Delicious!! Thank you Chef John!

This is absolutely delicious!  I increased the red curry paste to one tablespoon and cut back a little on the chicken broth so I could add a whole can of coconut milk.  Not difficult to make at all. A really big hit everytime I serve it! Thanks Chef John for another winner!

Loved it.  Had to use gravy beef as no short ribs available.  Upped the curry paste.  Such a tasy curry!

i really liked it;  but it still didn't convert my DH into liking beef ribs. i also didn't make the cauliflower portion and put everything into the crock pot after browning in the oven.  
delicious but too expensive to make for myself.

I thought this was ok, but I did not like the basil in this. It was overpowering to the flavor. I think cilantro would have gone better. This did smell amazing as it was cooking, so I was a bit disappointed in the flavor.

I give it 5 stars because Chef John gave this recipe a fitting name "American Curry". If you love curry, you will need to doctor this recipe quite a bit. I used the ingredients listed as a start then added more ingredients. Either way, every Chef John recipe I try, I learn something new. Thanks Chef John!

Added roasted tomatoes at the beginning and shallots instead of garlic.  Did not coat ribs with garam masala but used some smoked paprika instead.  No fish sauce.  Fabulous!

I always make changes to a recipe according to my taste buds... I omitted the star anise (not purposely) and added more than enough curry and marsala to my liking. I made the sauce in my pressure cooker, added the cooked ribs from the oven, and slow cooked everything together for a few hours... The results were very good and spicy. The only thing I would add is flour to make it a little thicker next time.

We are Thai curry lovers and this looked interesting.  It turned out to be very, very good!  I followed instructions exactly, but made double the "gravy," doubling the amount of red curry paste because we like spicy food.  In retrospect, I should have  added even more "hot."   At the end of the oven cooking period, I strained and discarded the mushy onions and garlic, then used a fat separator to remove the fat.  I added some fresh pearl onions with the cauliflower, and sugar snap peas at the end, then thickened slightly with cornstarch and served with rice.  YUM!
