Very good - reminds me of my mom's Peanut Butter balls! My only comments - I would refrigerate a the mix (dough) a few minutes before trying to form into balls, otherwise they're a sticky mess. Secondly, 1 cup choc. chips just b-a-r-e-l-y covered all of them (I got 29 balls - FYI). Might want to dip sparingly or add a 1/4 c. choc chips to the recipe.

Otherwise great, and easy! enjoy!

These are good little morsels that taste like peanut butter cups. Definitely increase the chocolate by at least another 1/4 cup. I highly recommend refrigerating the formed balls for a little bit to help firm them up. It really helped when dipping them into the warm chocolate.  I think I will crush the cereal a little next time. Kids loved them.

I have used a recipe very similiar to this for years. I put mini paper cups inside of mini-cupcake pans and pat the rice crispie mixture into the bottom then top with chocolate. Easier to freeze, store and transport.

These are great! I would make one suggestion - you can crush the krispies for a smoother filling. We made little mice shapes and garnished with half peanuts for ears and a pretzel stick tail.

This was a great recipe - I made them for Christnas Day and everyone ate them up quickly.  Only thing I did differently (just because it was easier and quicker) was that I drizzled the chocolate over the top of the balls instead of dunking and covering them completely. They turned out very pretty and there was plenty of chocolate left over. These will definately be made again!

4+.  These are great! My 5 yr old helped me and could almost do the whole thing herself, which is really nice to find recipes that kids can make.  She loved eating them too.  The only thing I would like to point out about the recipe to others trying it,it says it makes 24, so I tripled it because I needed more, and I got 82 that are 1-1 1/2 inches wide.  Not that I mind having more than I needed..:)just wanted people to know it makes quite a bit.

This recipe is very, very tasty! I used it to make 2 very large Easter eggs and a bunch of small ones (I doubled the recipe). The larger your balls, the less chocolate you're going to need! Just a heads up. I used crunchy peanut butter and wish I hadn't--it made it quite a bit harder to get the eggs to hold their shape. I also took other reviewers' advice and squished my rice krispies (which had about a 1/4c. cornflakes in too...didn't want to open another box & cornflakes were open). Another thing...I have been replacing half of our real sugar with fake sugar for a long time now, so this candy with its full amount of powdered sugar was almost too rich for me. I'm going to do something about that next time but I'm not going to just omit the sugar because the recipe really NEEDS the powder there to help make the PB workable. Might just change out for Splenda, or maybe use a sugar-free PB (assuming I can find a decent brand, bleh). I'd recommend this tasty recipe to anyone!

Very good peanut butter balls.  The crisped rice cereal gives them a nice slightly crunchy texture.  I prefer these to the 'smoother' pb balls.

Very tasty and rich, it made 30 bite size balls for me. I had read some of the reviews and I'm glad I did. I crushed the rice cereal down just a bit and then refrigerated the mixture a few minutes before forming into balls. Then I put the balls in the freezer for a few minutes while I got the dipping chocolate ready. I used 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips and about 2 tbs. shortening. I needed it all for the dipping to be sure. Really everyone loved them and I will make them again. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good.  Made this like the oreo balls type of cookie. Put the mix in the freezer and used a bit at a time while lettting it get firmer. Also used chocolate almond bark instead of choc. chips since we were out. Good.

These are good and I will make the again. I will definitely refrigerate the mixture for a bit before forming it into balls next time because the peanut butter melted in my hands and it was a big mess. Also, next time I may add a little more rice cereal to cut down the richness of the peanut butter, but that is just personal taste. Overall, yummy and easy!

Tasty and addictive! I orginal plan was to make this recipe for family day at my daughters pre-school. I decided not to take them because they just weren't very attractive and I didn't think they would stand up to the heat (outdoor thing) very well. I put them in the freezer and they freeze very well. They are actually very yummy frozen.

I made these for a school party and everyone loved them! They tasted like peanut butter cups. I had to make the balls a bit small to make sure there were enough to go around, so next time I'd double the recipe. I'll be making these again.

The proportions of the ingredients in this recipe are really off.  Prepared as written results in a sticky mess.  I had to chill the mixture to roll into balls.  I had to chill the balls in order to dip them in the chocolate.  The recipe should call for more rice krispies and powdered sugar to alleviate the stickiness.   More chocate was needed for dipping too.  The result was fair at best.

Nothing like a quick and easy treat that doesn't require any baking!! Due to my daughters peanut allergy, I used her "soy nut butter" to make these balls along with chocolate flavored crispy rice cereal. I'm so jealous of the reviewer who got 29 balls out of her batch. I didn't get nearly that much. I certainly wish I had 'cos they were so yummy. I guess it depends on how large you make them. Anyway, thanks Edna; we loved them!

I added twice the amount of rice krispies than the recipe called for. These are good, but only when frozen. Could not leave on a cookie plate because when they are room temperature they are a gooey mess! I'm not sure what to change but i will try again next year!

An excellent recipe!  It's very easy to make and not too messy.  The kids love helping me make this, and my husband says the finished product is better than anything that can be found in a store.

These are sticky so they need to be completely covered with chocolate which I failed with since I'm not great with melting chocolate chips in the microwave.  They came out ugly but taste great.  They need constant refrigeration in any case.

A very sticky mess indeed. I think the proportions are wrong...should maybe be more cereal than peanut butter and not as much sugar. Also, 1 cup of chocolate chips only coated half the peanut butter balls.
