It's really hard to go wrong with bbq, mushrooms, and melty cheese. This one didn't disappoint.  I made as written except we don't have a grill so I just cooked the onions and mushrooms together until tender.  Marinated the chicken in a 1/2 cup of bbq sauce and cooked it on the stove top until done, then topped with more bbq, onions, mushrooms, and cheese, put the lid on and let it all melt together.

This is one of my favorite recipes on here by far! I do not like BBQ sauce or anything remotely spicy. This dish changed my mind-I LOVE this BBQ sauce and it is BOTH spicy AND sweet. Absolutely AMAZING & out of this world. I make this BBQ sauce and use it in so many other dishes now too. This recipe is such a hit in our home, we have made this exactly as the recipe says over 5+ times now.

The sauce turns to liquid and when its done there is none left on the chicken.  End result is a bland, and as usual, dry chicken breast.  Mushrooms, cheese, and onions were good though!

We loved this recipe!   I did not use the liquid smoke in the sauce because we do not like the taste, but, made the rest of the sauce as the recipe stated.  It was spicy and had a great tang!  I also sauteed the mushrooms and onions in a pan before added to the chicken because I don't like the taste of steamed onions and mushrooms and was afraid that was how they would cook in the foil.  The chicken cooked perfectly moist and juicy in the foil packet.  We took the suggestion of sprinkling some cilantro on top of the chicken and I am glad we did!  The cilantro gave it a fresh taste and worked perfect with the flavors in the bbq sauce.
