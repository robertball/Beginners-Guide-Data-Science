I'm only giving this recipe a 4 because it's missing some of the traditional ingredients. Firstly omit the cloves, we don't use those here in Denmark. Secondly you need to add "white pepper" which is why they are called "pepper nuts". This recipe should use about one quarter of a teaspoon. 

It also requires 2 teaspoons of baking soda which will make them rise a bit to get the perfect traditional pebernødder shape!

Also the correct way to write it without the special character is "Pebernoedder". MERRY CHRISTMAS! :)

Man - I didn't know ANYONE outside of my family ate peppernuts! I love this cookie but it is totally unlike any American cookie. They're almost like gravel, round and hard. But the cardamom flavor can't be beat. When we make them we roll them into ropes about 3/8" in diameter. Cut the rope, then roll the rope a quarter turn, cut and roll back a quarter turn. Then the peppernut has a strange 3-D trapezoidal shape. Set them in rows on the cookie sheet (they don't spread so you can put them quite close together). These are a tradition for us to make the day after Thanksgiving. I cannot wait!

I have been searching for this recipe for YEARS - I didn't know the name of it, so that slowed me down some!  I'm glad to say my search is over.  These cookies are FANTASTIC!!  A German neighbor made these when I was a kid, and helping her was always a blast.  This is definitely a "get together" recipe because the cookies are made so small, it does take a while to roll them all out - but they are so worth it!!!  We fill up pretty jars with them and decorate them with ribbons for gifts.  They are tasty, like a crunchy, bite-sized gingersnap - I can't tell you how happy I am to have this recipe.  My son loves helpig with them and it will definitely become a Christmas tradition in our home to make these!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Man, are these yummy!  I made them the size of a teaspoon, and baked them for only 7 minutes.  I was able to fit 40 on a  baking sheet, since they really don't spread much.  They're the consistency of a sugar cookie (not gravel, haha!)  I didn't have the ground cloves, and didn't miss it, but I think I'll add more cardamom next time.

i love pebernodder. this is a cookie that has been made for centurys in my family. i have never heard it described as "gravel like" tho. i do want to share a tip ive learned over the years. because this is a butter based cookie it will burn easily so watch it closely and do not over cook, otherwise im glad such a great danish recipe on here!

While not exactly the same, they're very close to the real thing! I left out the cloves and added about 2g of white pepper as well as about 2 tsp. of baking soda (I don't have measuring spoons, so i used a small teaspoon/eggspoon)  as per mobygirl. This was my first time making pebernødder and it certainly won't be my last. I have a VERY picky Danish husband who enthusiastically approved...so much, that he ate 1/2 of the cookies in the first hour of me making them!

These cookies are a favorite of mine made by my Danish grandmother!  I didn't really know they were Danish.  I just found the recipe in my box this season and decided to make them for holiday gifts.

These were pretty good.  I used a little less flour and made the cookies a little bit bigger than indicated in the recipe.  So, the result was not a hard cookie (when I read the first review I was worried - I didn't want to eat gravel!)  This is a nice small spice cookie which is not too sweet.

This recipe was bad. It did not resemble my grandmother's at all. It needs brown sugar or someting.

Thank you for this recipe!  Unfortunately, much of my Scandinavian heritage seems to have gotten lost in the old country, so this was  a tasty restoration! I used to live in OR, and though I never got to Scandinavian Fest, this brought back memories of Junction City/Eugene/Willamette Valley!  Takk!

I have to agree with mobygirl, they aren't exactly like the real thing. I also notice nobody has mentioned one of the traditional ways they are eaten: dipped or poured in a bowl of sweetened buttermilk (that's the closest way I can describe it). My boyfriend is from Denmark and I'm always looking for recipes to make!

These cookies are very dry unless you cover them in confectioner's sugar and eat with coffee or tea.

there's something missing in this recipe. I can't quite figure it out, but it isn't 100%

My great grandmother always made these for Christmas.  I never had her recipe.  I actually like these better than hers.  The flavor is more savory.  They aren't as hard.  However, my great grandmother's were always small, hard brown balls.  Mine spread a little in cooking and are many shades lighter.

I have been looking for a peppernut recipe to match my family recipe from when I was a kid. These are perfect. I was able to make over 200 peppernuts. I followed the tips of mobygirl and omitted the cloves, and added the white pepper. Also added the 2 tsp of baking soda. I baked them on parchment paper. They will be a great addition to my Christmas gifts.
