The only difference I find between brocco & cauliflower is colour and that broccoflower seems to cook a bit faster. I left out the red pepper but followed the directions to the sauce.  Hmmm...I'm not sure if I like the sauce.  It has a sour taste or some kind of taste that I am not aquired to.  Overall, this recipe was just o.k.

Pretty good....served with Marinated Turkey Tenderloins on this site....The sauce was really good and thickend nicely. Didnt have any sesame seeds, but did use the sesame oil which I think has a great flavor. Loved the red peppers with the broccoflower. Thanks!

Okay, I cheated. I couldn't ifnd Broccoflower, so I used some broccoli and cauliflower.  I also couldn't find my sesame oil, so I used olive oil instead (seriously not the same).  Tasted good regardless of the substitutions.  I really need the sesame oil, though.
