I omitted the green bell pepper, and used fresh garlic and powdered ginger. It turned out great, and was even better with some frsh cilantro sprinkled on top. Don't forget to remove the cardamom, peppercorns etc before serving - biting into them is NOT pleasant. Thanks!

Might have been better to sprinkle the cashews on top right before serving, since they got mushy.

This was a delightful curry - with just the right mix of complementary flavours. I would like the coconut milk to thicken slightly more, however. A gorgeous, simple and quick recipe; this is a keeper!

This is a tasty meal, but I wanted a little more from this dish. Maybe some ingredients miss in this dish for my taste, I don`t know. I follow the recipe exactly, but I didn`t use ginger (I don`t like it). This is a great idea to add cashews to the shrimp.

Try this again following the recipe exactly; it was good even with substitutions, but I think the actual ingr will be better.

Too time consuming and this recipe isn't clear-- what is done with the cinnamon sticks?  Crush? Discard? Leave in?
