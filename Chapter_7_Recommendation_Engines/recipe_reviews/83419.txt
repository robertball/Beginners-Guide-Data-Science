Really delicious--if you like blue cheese. My husband calls this one a keeper. Instead of browning on the stove, I simply breaded these in breadcrumbs and crushed nuts and baked them. You can prepare several servings at once, freeze before baking, thaw and then bake at a later date. So I triple this recipe--not much more work, but we get three separate dinners out of it!

You know, I was actually going to make up a recipe for spinach and blue cheese stuffed chicken breasts, but came here first to see if there was a reicpe for what I had in mind.  This is almost it!  These are my changes:  I only had fresh spinach so I wilted it in the micro (one-minute intervals...man that stuff shrinks!).  Mixed it with blue cheese (for hubby, I did shredded mozzarella and a bit of light sour cream cause he dislikes blue cheese and I just had the mozz on hand).  I then pounded my chicken breasts, spread the cheese mixture on one side and rolled it up, wrapping two whole, raw bacon slices around it.  Didn't even need toothpicks.  Pretty easy to prepare too (I prepared the cheese/spinach mixture ahead of time and put in in some tupperware in the fridge).  I skipped the browning with flour and olive oil- as the bacon cooked in the oven it took care of that part.  I loves this dish!  Tasted hubby's and it was good, although not as good as mine, because I LOVE blue cheese!

This recipe is SO good.  One of my faves, and now I have it memorized.  The only change I made was to add minced garlic and chopped onions.  Everyone that has had it, loves it!

I prepared this with my own twists on the recipe, mainly to accomodate the tastes of my blue cheese detesting husband--though I'm sure I would have rated it equally just as written. Just eyeballing it, I mixed the frozen spinach with Alouette Garlic and Herb cheese, and put a spoonful of this mixture on each pounded, flattened chicken breast. I rolled them up, and wrapped two slices of partially cooked bacon over each. I didn't bother with flouring them or browning them in a skillet, just simply placed them in a baking dish at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Moist and tender, SO flavorful, and pretty on the plate too!

These are very tasty. I don't like Blue Cheese, so I used fetta instead. I also added a little nutmeg to the spinach. (The flavouours go really well together. I stole this idea from my Lasagna recipe) I aldo added a couple tblsp of mayo, just for some creamyness. I topped the entire thing off with some grated monteray jack cheese. Wonderful combination! :)

I can't say enough about this meal...it ranks high on my list of "best things I've ever cooked!" I didn't measure the cheeses...I just used however much I preferred, and I used freshly chopped bacon bits rather than actual bacon strips. The chicken was so tender, and the cheeses I used (bleu cheese and feta) mixed with the bacon and spinach were delicious. I will DEFINITELY make this again!!

This was really good, although I made a few adjustments. First, I sauteed fresh spinach with a crushed garlic clove in some olive oil. The cheese I used was one that I found in the gourmet cheese section at the market. It was a layered brick of blue cheese/old cheddar. The cheddar really helped keep the flavor mild. I think using the full amount of only blue cheese would have been overpowering, like others have mentioned. The chicken breasts I used were de-boned, but still had the skin on. I put the stuffing underneath the skin, then sauteed in a pan (without the flour). I finished these off in the oven. I will make this again.

Loved it!  We browned the chicken before putting in the filling and it worked great.  Also agree with the other folks about using half blue cheese and half feta...tastes great but not too overpowering.  Will defintely makes this again.

I made this the other night.  It was delicious.  My boyfriend who declares that "no recipe deserves 5 stars, there's always room to improve" gave it 5 stars!    Next time I think I will use fresh spinach and brown the chicken a little more.  But it was so delicious!!!

Excellent!  I butterflied the chicken breasts and folded them over and secured with toothpicks after putting the filling inside.

This was great, but I changed the recipe a lot.  I sauteed chopped onions and garlic with the spinach, in the bacon fat.  I pounded out the chicken breasts, filled them with the spinach mixture, and then rolled them in bread crumbs.  I deglazed the pan with white wine, and then browned the chicken.  After putting the chicken in a baking dish, I deglazed the pan again with a little chicken broth, then poured the sauce over the chicken.  Finally, I put a slice of mozzarella on each chicken breast, and then cooked it for about 30 minutes.  Served it with steamed zucchini and brown rice.  Delicious, thanks!

I made these the other night and I had some problems with the recipe.  First of all, there was way too much filling for the chicken.  I only used about half of it.  I used a good Danish bleu cheese and the flavor was very strong.  Overall, it was tasty but too overpowering, almost tongue numbing.   I think I will adjust this with about half the spinach, and 1/4 cup of blue cheese.  I would also add some sauteed onion and garlic to the filling.   As written, I would give it 3 stars but I think with a little tweaking, it could easily be a 5 star recipe.  It has potential.

I made this with 1 cup of feta cheese and two bags of fresh spinach that I cooked in olive oil and garlic.  I have made this recipe 2 other times and felt it was a little bland so this time I used the sauce from the "Feta Cheese and Bacon Stuffed Breasts" on this site.  I used 1 T olive oil, 3 T lemon juice, 4 garlic cloves and 1/2 T oregano and poured over top of prepared breasts - I did not put flour or heat before pouring sauce over.  I made them in the morning and let them sit in the sauce all day.  They turned our perfect.  I gave this 4 stars because the original recipe is 4 but with the sauce it's a 5!

Simple concept, but so delicious! I added a bit of mayo to the spinach mixture for creaminess. After stuffing, I just sprinkled the chicken with shake and bake and then popped them in the oven for 30 minutes. Yum!

Not sure if anyone else tried this, but I pounded the chicken breasts till very thin; lightly browned them in a skillet with olive oil and butter, then set aside. Sauteed some onion and garlic, added it to the spinach/cheese. Rather than stuff/roll the chicken, I put a layer of spinach on one breast; layered it with a second breast, securing the edges with toothpicks.  Saved a bit of the filling and put that on top of each.  Then placed them in a baking dish, covered with foil and baked for 15 minutes.  Next time I'll add some sauteed mushrooms.  This recipe has several possibilities for changes; it's a keeper.

This recipe is a winner!  I added cream cheese to the spinach mixture (as another reviewer recommended), probably about 1/2 a brick and one clove of fresh minced garlic.  I also did not brown the chicken.  I baked it covered with foil then removed the foil and broiled for about 5 min to brown.  It was perfect!  My kids each had a guest for dinner and everyone gobbled it up!  Thanks Judy for a great recipe!

I used gorgonzola as the blue cheese and it was fantastic.  I got a "Top Ten" rating on it.  I served it with roasted red potatoes that I quarter and toss with basil, olive oil and Nature's Blend seasoning.

I made this dish for the second time yesterday.  Pretty much followed the recipe and it was fantastic.  The chicken breast, however, were huge and were thicker than called for, but they were tender and delicious!  This is a keeper!

As mentioned in my original review...Must use the Amazing Sun-Dried Tomato Cream Sauce" recipe from this site. It will help with the "dryness" reviewers keep mentioning. It's Awesome!  WOW! Awesome! READ ON- THE SAUCE I USED IS A MUST!! I used 1/2 cup blue cheese, then some cream cheese. Also browned chix a little (no flour, only EVOO)..then slit a pocket in them and stuffed them...then closed with toothpicks...worked out perfectly!  Also used a little garlic salt and salt and pepper.  DEFINITELY needs a drizzle of sauce as suggested by others.  I used the "Amazing Sun-Dried Tomato Cream Sauce" recipe from this website...all I can say is UNBELIEVABLE. I can't even imagine this recipe working without that sauce.  As a matter of fact, I eliminated the fatty bacon to compensate for the sauce.  Also used 1/2 and 1/2 for the sauce instead of heavy cream, and again added a little garlic salt. No need to be adding sauteed onions or mushrooms if you spruce up with some garlic and/or garlic salt, the Sauce adds all the extra flavor this needs. I put the sauce on cooked Egg noodles and over the chicken. I will make this over and over!!!

This is great! I cut a slit in the chicken, and stuffed it that way, instead of folding it over. This is very easy to make. I know I'll be making it again, many times.

Exquisite! I LOVE blue cheese, my husband can't stand it and we both love this recipe. I did saute onions and garlic and added that along with 1/4 c mayo and  pine nuts to the filling. I browned the chicken in the bacon grease in a large dutch oven and then just put the dutch oven in the regular oven to bake and it was really delicous!

This is fantastic!  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and half blue cheese and half low-fat Irish cheddar.  It was so good and not too rich, and the chicken was super tender.

Fantastic, family loved it... said they felt like it was from a gourmet restaurant! I was going to make some with blue cheese and some with, mozzerella and sour cream per another reviewers comments but in the end I didn't bother separating it and mixed it all together with fresh chopped spinach instead of frozen and the crumbled bacon etc. I salted and peppered both sided of the chicken before I spread the mix on, and added 2-3 asparagus shoots before folding and securing with toothpicks. I skipped the breading and browning process and just set the breasts inside a greased pan (I'm horrible and used the bacon fat and some extra salt... but it was OH SO worth it!) I sprinkled the top with some parmesan cheese before putting in the oven. I had some mix left over, so I made some mashed potatoes and blended it all together with some extra sour cream, butter, and bit of milk... I couldn't tell which tasted better the chicken or the potatoes!

You Must Really Like Blue Cheese To Attempt To Cook This Dish. I Recommend Removing The Spinach, And Some Of The Blue Cheese And Replace It With A Milder Cheese Mixed With The Blue Cheese And The Bacon Filling. See My Picture With The Chicken Served With Risotto, And Fresh Off The Cob Corn.

Pretty good. I think I will try mixing the spinach with cream cheese next time to make it richer.

The family liked this a lot! The chicken & filling was a little too dry for my taste, using fresh spinach & 3 Tbls of sour cream. Everyone gobbled it up & my 6 year old loved eating hers off of the toothpicks. :)

This recipe has a nice flavor, but I highly suggest that you season it more than what the recipe calls for.

I read the reviews and added mayo to the spinach mix, along with onion & garlic sauteed in the bacon grease. I only mixed one bacon slice in the spinach and used two slices to wrap the breast in. I'll make it healthier next time and forget the bacon wrap, but I will keep this recipe for future reference! Very good!

Don't like wasting time or money, and unfortunately, this did both.  Without tweaking too much, I took some reviewers recs and wrapped bacon around chicken, added onion & garlic to filling, used 2/3 bleu/1/3 feta combo, baked  @375 for longer time.  Also cut back on spinach since we're not huge fans -- a little goes a long way.  No deal: TOO much spinach, dry filling but moist chicken, VERY little other flavor, much more cooking time.  I enjoy cooking, don't mind taking time or spending a little extra to make something good, but this did not work for me. Have another chicken, spinach and cheese dish I'll just stick with from now on.

Great recipe!    I made this for my family last night, and it was a hit.  I pounded the chicken a little thinner than it said to in the recipe, along with using turkey bacon instead of regular bacon.  I also cooked it for about 20 minutes covered with foil, removed the foil and popped the chicken into the broiler to crisp the outside up a little bit, then topped the whole thing off with a creamy white wine sauce, and it turned out amazing!  Kudos to Judy for this recipe!

Great basic recipe for just about any kind of stuffing.  I used what was on hand: fresh spinach wilted in sauteed garlic/evoo, mixed with crumbled bacon and equal amount cheddar and pepper jack cheese.  Stuffed, rolled in panko, browned on the stove and roasted for about 20 more minutes.  Thanks!

With modifications, this dish is worthy of a high-end restaurant menu! For the filling I used torn spinach, sliced mushrooms, diced onions and minced garlic sauteed in butter as per one reviewer's suggestion. Once done cooking I added in crumbled feta and creamy blue cheese. I butterflied the breasts and pounded them to thin them out a bit. Coated them in a flour, paprika, chili powder and pepper mixture. It did not add much taste, so next time I will coat them differently. I then stuffed the breasts with half the filling mixture and tied them using two uncooked strips of bacon. I cooked them in the oven as described in the original recipe. I made a sauce by following the ingredients and description from another recipe on this site, "Chicken Cordon Bleu II". I added the remaining filling to the sauce and let it simmer until thickened. It tasted great served over the chicken and brown rice I served along with it. Definite keeper the way it was modified!

My husband requests this so often I had to make it a special day meal!  It's his favorite.  I made too much of the spinach mixture, so afterward I added more blue cheese to it, baked it for about 20 minutes and spread it on garlic bread chips... it was delish!!!

i just HAD to write a review for this recipe cause it was SO great!
i gave it 4 stars though, cause i dont like my food so bland and i tweaked it quite a bit. 
i started with sauteeing some onion and garlic in a skillet till translucent, and adding some mushrooms and bacon to it after which i added the spinach (i had fresh)
to that i added blue cheese and mozzarella (following the advice given that blue cheese was overpowering. it turned out just right the way i did it). i also added some finely chopped green chillies and italian seasoning (i know its a weird combination, but it worked in this dish!)
to the flour, i added some seasoning along with the salt and pepper too.. this was SO good i was sorry i had to share it!!!!!!!!!!!!!

With the addition of a few extra spices, this recipe would be an easy 5 star. I spiced my chicken up well before rolling. Also added garlic to the spinach mixture, and skipped the pan frying. One thing is for sure, spinach and blue cheese together delivers a wonderful taste. Who Knew? I had some of the spinach mixture left over and am going to have it for lunch. I have now found a new way to eat spinach. It is that good! Thanks!

This was wonderful!! I made a few changes. I used feta and cream cheese instead of blue cheese. Also, after cooking my bacon in the skillet I used fresh spinich and garlic and sauteed it in the bacon grease. YUM!  I served this w/farfalle pasta with a butter garlic sauce with fresh parsely, parm, and fontinella cheese.  A superb meal!

OMG! It was delicious! The moment I saw the picture I knew I had to try it. The hardest part was keeping the chicken closed and not frying the cheese, but the toothpicks did the best they could. Served with garlic herb pasta bowtie, it could not have been any better!

this was a great recipe, I used Feta cheese, that's what I had on hand. Turned out very well, I used others suggestions and added a few tablespoons mayo to the stuffing mixture and it wasn't dry at all. will be keeping the recipe handy, Thanks!

I give this 5 with the few things I added. I added sauteed onions, garlic and pepper flakes to the spinach. I added about a 1/4 cup of mayo and some parm cheese for creaminess (is that a word?). I used about 3/4 cup of blue cheese. My whole family loves it, but I think a cup is too much. I topped the rolls with the leftover stuffing and baked them uncovered, so it would get golden. Moist and flavorful. A winner, I was told I have to make it again.

I followed the advice of a previous review and used feta cheese instead of blue cheese, added some nutmeg to the spinach, and some mayo for creaminess.  I coated them in flour and cooked on the stove top in olive oil, and browned the outside slightly.  Then I added white wine and cooked them on the stove top in a covered skillet for about 40 minutes.  The white wine gave it extra flavor and it was amazing!

This was pretty good. I used mozzarella instead. I added a little mayo like some suggested for creaminess. I didn't brown the sides of the chicken but I did put the frozen spinach on the stove and heated it with seasoning and the mayo. Stuffed chicken breasts and it was pretty good!

Tried this recipe. VERY GOOD. Will definitely make it again.  My boyfriend accidently picked up the Bleu Cheese that had dried cranberries in it and it was wonderful.  It added a sweet/tangy taste to it.  Great flavor, will be making it alot more.  He liked the spinach stuffing so much he asked for it as a side dish with other meats!!

This is delectable--and I'll bet non-red-meat eaters could substitute sauteed mushrooms for a very fine bacon-free dish!  I make it with half feta, half mozzerella as the cheese, and since I don't pound my chicken, it takes a bit longer--40-45 minutes to bake.  It's really quite no-fail and everyone in the house adores it!

THis recipe is quite good, but what made it spectacular was deglazing the pan with white wine and some cream.  This chicken, with the sauce and some fettucine made for a great dinner.  

Quite easy

This was amazing!!!  I did do this a little differently - minced some garlic and mixed that with the blue cheese and spinach.  Then rolled the pounded chicken breasts around this mixture and then wrapped each breast in 2 slices of raw bacon.  Skipped the flour dredging and just stuck the breasts in the oven on a  rack over a cookie sheet (to catch bacon drippings).  Had a dinner guest over and we all just loved it!  Next time I'll add some onions, and maybe some mushrooms per other reviewers.  I gave this 4 stars because the recipe definitely does need additional flavor, and the flour part just wouldn't have worked with the already stuffed chicken.  Wonderful inspiration for my version, though!

with a title like this and the ingredients incorporated, who knew the recipe would be so bland?  i made a couple of small changes to a seemingly sure-fire winner, only to be disappointed.  first, i salted and peppered the breasts before and after dredging in the flour, and second, i browned the chicken in the bacon drippings rather than olive oil.  how could this not come together better...i mean, shoes are good dredged in flour then fried in bacon grease, right?  the problem with this recipe can be summed up very simply--lack of overall flavor.  the  submitter deserves credit for turning out moist chicken, but the stuffing alone does not carry the dish. the breasts badly need a healthy dose of extra spices...which ones i'm not quite sure abt. since i'm trying to block out the experience.

I used 3 chicken breasts and pounded each somewhat thinner.  I seasoned each with a little bit of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and olive oil.  Filling:  5 pieces of crumbled turkey bacon (microwaved), about 1 TBS of light Mayo. (to make filling creamier), about 3/4 cup of blue cheese and about of 1/2 cup fresh spinach.  Filled each chicken breast and closed with toothpicks and then sprinkled some milled organic flax seed on the outside of the chicken.  Baked for 30-35 minutes.  GREAT!!!  AWESOME!!!

Alright, I didn't do it exactly as written, but I still gave it a 5. If there were more stars, I'd give it more! Here's what I adjusted (simply because these were the ingredients at hand, of course): Rather than the full cup of bleu cheese, I used 1/2 cup of bleu cheese and 3 ounces of cream cheese in the stuffing. I browned the rolls in a tablespoon of the bacon grease instead of olive oil. After browning, I sprinkled just a little Mexican 4-cheese on them and then baked them right in the skillet (covered, of course). Other than those slight changes, I followed the recipe to the letter. This dish has now taken over the top spot on my chicken list! It is fantastic! thanks, Miss.J For a great recipe!

Everyone loved this dish!  I used fresh spinach and, after stuffing the chicken, I wrapped them with prosciutto minus the flour coating.  Instead of toothpicks, I used baker's string.

I loved this and so did my husband. I only made a few small changes to fit my taste and what I had on hand. I used fresh spinach which I sauteed with minced garlic and coated the breast in breadcrumbs before I baked. Everyone loved this, in fact my 5 y.o. daughter was mad at me for not making more!

I wish I could say this was great, but it was just ok.  The spinach seemed to be all we could taste.  Couldn't taste the blue cheese (also added cheddar cheese, but no taste of that either).  If I make this again, I will add maybe cream cheese, and use about half as much spinach.

I experimented with just cooking one... the recipe scaled down nicely for one and I have to say I LOVED it.  I read some comments and changed a few things too.  I added some balsamic vinegar as one person suggested, definitely added garlic and only used half the mayo.  I didn't have any bacon, so I drizzled olive oil over it,  sprinkled on some garlic seasoning salt and coarse pepper.  About midway through cooking, I cut up a potato and put it around the chicken breast.  I used a little more olive oil and stirred to coat them and put it all back in the oven together.  The chicken was great and the roasted potatoes were wonderful with it.... along with my glass of chardonnay! :)

My husband and I LOVE this recipe. Were trying to watch our weight so I used light blue cheese and skipped the bacon. Also, I love to grill  so I  just threw them on the grill and they were fabulous! Great recipe. Thanks so much!

New member/rater here, this is my debut rating. :o) Very tasty indeed! The only alteration i made, was to eliminate the salt (since bleu chz and bacon are already pretty salty) and substitute flax meal for the flour, because i just prefer it to flour. Otherwise, directions were followed to a T. The fam loved it. Thanks, Judy!  :o)

This was really good! I made it for my fiance, however I made a few minor tweaks. I used Goat Cheese, instead of Blue Cheese since it was what I had in the house. Also, I cooked the bacon and left the strips whole. I laid a piece of bacon on the chicken breast lengthwise, then put the spinach/cheese mixture in the middle and rolled it up. I made a white wine butter sauce and drizzled over top, served it with wheat angel hair pasta and it was delicious!

Really, really good. I added a dollop of good blue cheese dressing to the filling to moisten it up a bit. I also browned the meat first and then sliced a pocket into the breasts for the filling instead of rolling them. It worked great & seemed like less work than pounding & rolling.

This turned out well and makes a great chicken alternate. I had a lot of leftover filling - in fact I was able to stuff six breasts. I'm planning to use the leftover filling in an omelet -- yum,yum.

I had a great time making this recipe. I used a frozen spinach with a cream sauce which was great. I also purchased chicken tenders by accident but found they worked a lot better as far as cooking evenly in my wacky oven (I stuffed/wrapped the 3 tenders at a time). 

I made this recipe two different ways. I made the original recipe but wrapped the chicken in bacon instead of putting it in the stuffing. The second version I made with a cheddar, jack, and cream cheese blend. I found this version to be the yummiest because it really brought out the flavor of the spinach the best. 

The blue cheese kind of overwhelms the flavor of the spinach. I didn't taste much of the spinach in the dish which was a bit disappointing. But overall, I thought this was a very creative recipe with lots of room for tweaking, which I highly encourage. Cheers!

Very good.  I've made this twice now and everyone loved it.  I used half sundried tomato and basil feta cheese, and half blue cheese.  I also added garlic, onion, and cilantro.  YUMMY!

The oven temp is wrong on this. Needs to be 375. At 350, after 30 min, this was just luke warm and my chicken was on the thinner side. My husband liked this, but I did not. For me, the chicken was too bland and I added garlic and onion. For the amount of effort involved, I won't make this again.

This was excellent (and RICH!) I used fresh baby spinach (Wilted in the pan I fried the bacon in) and used feta instead of blue cheese (it was what i had on hand). I also didn't fry it before baking, and I seasoned the outside of the chicken with garlic powder and seasoning salt. Delicious!!!

Made this several times.  I use fresh spinach sautéed in garlic, oil, salt and pepper. And Feta in stead of bleu cheese. So good.

My husband said this is now his favorite meal.  It looked/smelled so good, I even tasted it (and I prefer a raw vegan diet).  It was delicious for cooked food! =)  Since I did not have bacon in the house, I omitted that and instead of bleu cheese, I substituted half goat cheese/half feta, which is what I had on hand.    Keep using up those leftovers Judy! This one is a winner! Thanks for posting this. YUMMMM!!!

I only gave 4 stars because I made some changes but this was awesome!! I did half feta/half blue cheese, used fresh spinach and mushrooms (steamed them before mixing with cheese), I used really thin chicken and then wraped the uncooked bacon around the stuffed chicken. I didn't use flour or fry them. I just baked at 350 for about 45 minutes, covered for about 25 then uncovered. I then made a sause with oil, white wine, onion, garlic, and the left over mushrooms and spinach. I served it over brown rice. Should have doubled the recipe because everyone asked for seconds!

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I added a few ingredients.  After cooking the bacon, I drained most of the fat and used the same pan to sauté a chopped onion and garlic then added fresh spinach until it was wilted.  Like several others who reviewed the recipe, I deglazed the pan with white wine then added sour cream for a very quick sauce.  My husband LOVED it!

I liked this. The only change I made was to use seasoned breadcrumbs rather than seasoned flour. I seasoned them with smoked paprika, salt, pepper and some all-purpose Greek seasoning. Next time, I would season the chicken breasts and the stuffing with salt and pepper too. Maybe add something else like roasted bell peppers to the stuffing as well! Thanks!

I used the ingredients exactly as set forth in the recipe. I did, however, take the advice of several reviewers. Instead of pounding out the breasts or butterflying them, I cut a pocket in each. I also browned the breasts before I stuffed them, and covered them with the extra stuffing mixture before baking them. They were wonderful and much easier to prepare than had I followed the recipe preparation steps. My son did complain about the bacon, but it sure didn't hold him back from devouring what I had planned to save as leftovers....

My favorite variation to this recipe is to mix the bacon with a cup of spinach dip from the deli counter. Roll the chicken breast in rye bread crumbs and saute it in butter before stuffing it. Then bake in oven as described. There is no blue cheese but it is just great!

I made this tonight and we really enjoyed it!  I decided to brown the chicken in the bacon fat, but had a lot of trouble with that, as the stuffing started to fall out, so I just dumped it all in the pan for the oven.  I also had extra stuffing so I put that on top.  It was delicious!  The chicken was really juicy and the blue cheese/spinach/bacon was perfect.  My boyfriend and I both love blue cheese, otherwise I wouldn't have wanted to have this.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but it just didn't happen. I made it for a dinner party last night. I have to say it just wasn't that great. I felt there wasn't enough to the stuffing. The blue cheese was overwhelming. I thought I was a blue cheese lover but maybe I am a fair weather friend. I even made a white wine cream sauce to pour over it after tasting the stuffing but it didn't help. My sister loved it but my husband and I went to the other side of the fence. Just a word of warning, if you don't absolutely love blue cheese this isn't  the dish for you. My hats off to those who loved it, I wanted to too.

This was delicious!! I followed Naples34102's suggestions w/ the garlic and herbs cheese, added some chopped red onion to the cheese mixture, and wrapped the chicken with the bacon. My husband who finds fault with everything took one bite and said "!". Very very good, moist and so much flavor!

Take the sugegstion of wrapping the chicken roll-ups in the bacon.  It turns out fantastic, and makes it even easier to prepare!

This was beautiful all the way through. 

I read several of the reviews just to make sure and I took some people's advice. I added: 
1/4 cup diced red onions 
1/4 tsp minced garlic

Instead of straight blue cheese, I used mountain gorgonzola. Yum. 

Also I used fresh spinach that I blanched in the bacon grease. 

Other than those minor changes, it was so intensly good, I was in a food coma the whole time.
With the left over fresh spinach, I made a salad, also containing red onion, leftover gorgonzola, and tomatoe. For the dressing I used Marie's Spinach dressing, which you can just buy at a store. It has bacon in it. 
We served the whole thing on top of a bed of orecchiette (a small shelled pasta). It is also a good idea to spoon any of the juices onto the breast. But maybe not if you're watching your weight - which I suppose this entire recipe defeats.

omitted bacon, sauteed fresh spinach w onion first.  Also browned chicken in olive oil before putting in oven for 20 mins at 325. blue cheese was a little overpowering. would make again.

Really good combination. I will use a rolling pin to flaten the chicken breast next time. The chicken was hard to roll around in the flour with the toothpicks in it, maybe I just don't know how to do it, but I managed. I will make them again!

Yummy. This is on my menu from now on. Everyone loved it including my mom, my teenage son, my picky 4 year old and my 2 year old. Hubby loved it even though he's not a blue cheese fan. Changes made -I added cream cheese to the stuffing to keep it from drying out, I wrapped bacon around the chicken instead of using toothpicks -oh, and I seasoned the chicken a little w/ Spike. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Sunday night dinner for my family and some friends.  I got rave reviews.  I did alter a few things.  I opted not to fry the chicken and put it directly in the oven.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and wrapped the chicken in prosciutto and tied it with bakers string.  I did drizzle olive oil over the top of the chicken rolls before I popped them in the oven.  I used 3/4 cup of feta cheese and 1/4 cup of blue cheese.  My husband thought it was too much but my thought was next time I'd love gorgonzola. I used chicken tenders (that I pounded so they were thin) instead of breasts because that is what I had on hand.  I thought it was really yummy but next time I will try adding some mayo to the stuffing mix.  I'm not good at creating sauces but I thought some kind of sauce over the top would have been good.  I will definitely make this again!

Two words though:  MORE BACON!  :)

This was really good.  I took the advice of some of the others and reduced the blue cheese to 1/2 cup.  It was still really blue cheesy.  It would taste good with many different types of cheeses.

This receipe is simple to make and yummy.  I used herb goat cheese instead of blue cheese and fresh spinach instead of frozen - it is what I had on hand.  The dish was very moist and favorful.  I will certainly make it again & perhaps the next time I have guests over for dinner.

I love to make this for special occasions.  If you have a hard time rolling up the chicken you can always lay chicken flat and add spinach mixture on top and bake. Equally good!

We loved these!  The only difference I made was to lay the bacon on top because my chicken was thick and I didn't want the meat to dry out.

Very juicy and tender. I had excess filling - heated on the stove and served over the top of stuffed breast. This was a very expressive looking but quite easy dish to prepare. Yum!

This was very good. I didn't change too much but was too lazy to stuff each breast individually. Instead I cooked the bacon in a skillet, drained off most of the grease and then browned the breasts. In another skillet I sauted onions, garlic, spinach, salt and pepper and parm cheese. Then I spread the spinach mix into a casserole dish, topped it with the chicken and sprinkled the bacon and the blue cheese on top. Baked until bubbly...very tasty!

WAY too much blue cheese! It didn't taste right until my boyfriend poured buffalo sauce on it and even then it was still too much. I'd do this again but with a lot less blue cheese and more mozzarella or something, which is the only reason why it gets three stars.

Made this for dinner last night and holy cow this was an absolute winner!  VERY easy to make and oh so good....be sure to drain the spinach well....  I have a frying pan that is oven safe so after frying the bacon (extra crispy), drained off most of the grease from that - left about a tablespoon of the bacon fat - oh so healthy I know, but it really was just a small amount of the fat - then after stuffing and flouring the stuffed breasts, fried it right in that pan - only about 5 minutes on each side ...then covered the whole pan with foil and put in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes just as the recipe said and it was done to perfection!  juicy!!! wow!  If I didn't know that I used Gorgonzola cheese, I'm not sure I could have picked out what the cheese was.....absolutely fantastic! Thanks for a super recipe Judy!

Yummy! First recipe I made from this site and was very pleased! I don't like blue cheese, so I subbed feta and grated parm (didnt have enough feta to go it alone). I didn't brown it before baking, but after 30 min i took the foil off and let it go another 5 min uncoverd which helped brown the chicken a bit.  My husband loved it!

this is an excellent recipe -- and it is wonderful to read the reviews and to hear some of the tweaks that people try.  i did like the "cranberries" idea ...and tried it.    for my own sauce, i deglazed the pan and, in it, made a creamed mustard sauce.  the next time i might even spike the sauce with a bit of brandy.

This was delish!!! I didn't stuff the chicken, but just kept spinach as side dish and served it with mash pot. My kids LOVED it! I loved it also and it was easy to prepare =)

I always get lots of complements on this dish! I gave it 4 stars because I do make some changes.  First, I butterfly the breasts. Then I fry them inthe bacon grease. I don't coat them or anything, just salt and pepper. I don't measure cheeses but I use 1 package of feta and 1 of Bleu. Secure with took picks and yummy! It's a great dish for compan because you can make ahead of time, so less dishes for later!

I ommitted the bacon and used thin sliced pears sauteed in butter. The blue cheese I used is from The Roque Creamery in Oregon called "Rogue Blue", a 1x year release cheese that is soaked in Pear brandy. I prefer fresh spinach to frozen. I also prefer to sear the breasts in a cast iron skillet then finish off by putting the skillet in a 400 degree oven for 10-15 minutes, YUMM!

I was impressed! I couldn't get the chicken to roll, so I used a skewer to keep them together in the oven. Used another reviewer's advice to bake them only. They turned out moist and tasty - had extra filling left over and used that on some puff pastry for an impromptu appetizer - yummy!

This recipe is great! I'll definitely make this again. I did do something a little different. Instead of browning in oil, I just put it directly in the oven, just to dry to cut down on the fat.  Next time I make this, I'll probably cut back a little on the bleu cheese.

A beautiful dish with wonderful flavors!  I will love serving this easy recipe to family and friends.  It looks marvelous with browned blue cheese sprinkled on top.  I used butter instead of olive oil - it adds a great flavor.  I love blue cheese and I love this meal!  Oh, also - I didn't use any bacon (I don't like bacon).  But it turned out great without it!

I thought the combination in this stuffing was fab! I made it for my family and they just loved it. I did use half blue cheese and half feta like others, and it worked out great. I made a little extra of the stuffing, and people were eating it right out of the bowl. I am going to stuff a pork loin with this as well.

I gave this recipe 5 stars after tweaking.  I sauteed onions and garlic in olive, added salt & pepper.  Mixed with spinach and blue cheese.  Added freshly ground nutmeg and finished off the recipe as stated.  Next time I will cut a pocket into the chicken breast and stuff.  Was too much stuffing and they didn't look nice, but tasted yummy!Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is amazing. And really good if you're cooking for a date. I use fresh spinach blanched in the bacon grease and then I use the rest of the spinach for a side salad. Also try other varieties of blue cheese like gorgonzola.

After reading many reviews for this recipe I had very high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I guess I never realized that I didn't have an affection for blue cheese. My boyfriend loved it, but I thought the whole thing just tasted weird. I wrapped the chicken in (turkey) bacon like others had suggested and even that didn't taste right.

What a delicious dish! I have made this several times and it takes substitutions or additions very well. I have added pine nuts, mushroom, garlic, onions and replaced the Blue Cheese with Feta, added Oregano and Basil and also wrapped the bacon around the chicken and baked it instead of putting the bacon in the stuffing. Any combination I make has turned out well and this is my go to recipe for guest dinners. I can make it ahead of time and take it from the fridge to the oven when I get home from work! It always looks like it was difficult to make and my guests love it!

YUM!  We really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed it exactly except I used half feta and half bleu cheese for fear that I didn't like bleu cheese that much.  Next time I'll be brave and use all bleu cheese.  Also I didn't brown the chicken in olive oil as it doesn't give a nice sear to the chicken, so I reserved about a tablespoon of bacon fat and used that instead.  Made a lovely crust that added beautifully to the savory flavors inside.  Thanks, Judy!  I wish I were as inventive!

Big hit in our family!!

 I have also used goat cheese to offset the strong bleu cheese flavor. I also sautee the spinach in garlic and olive oil and beef boullion cube over the stove, let cool and then stuff the chicken with it. it gives the spinach a great flavor and compliments the chicken.

Great recipe!!!

Anything with blue cheese,spinach and bacon is bound to be delicious and this dish was! I chopped up a red onion and cooked it in some of the bacon grease and added it to the mixture as well. Others reviews thought the blue cheese was overpowering but we didn't think so at all, it was AWESOME! The only thing I would do differently next time is make some type of sauce to drizzle over it

This was a delicious recipe.  I used fresh baby spinach and cooked it down in olive oil with a little minced onion, I also added the bacon.  To finish it off, I made a garlic, wine and butter sauce and poured it over the chicken after it finished cooking.

Very good. I must note we don't like blue cheese in our family so I substituted Mozarrella and Asiago cheeses instead. It turned out great.

I made this last night and it was a hit! Even the kids, who at first turned their noses up to the spinach agreed that it wasn't "too bad"! I did change it slightly. I used bread crumbs and baked it as was suggested by several other readers. It looked so elegant when it came out of the oven. The kids were impressed by my talents! (sh! Don't tell them how easy it was!)
I used Feta cheese because I had it in the refrig. already.  As it turns out, I ran short, so I followed another reader's advice and added cream cheese. I also topped it with a seasoned wine/butter/garlic sauce another reader recommended.  I served parsley and garlic buttered noodles with it.

i really thought the blue cheese was a bit overpowering, and i used frozen spinach, which was a little mushy.  i think i will make again & try it with fresh spinach & maybe less blue cheese & some cream cheese mixed in, like some of the other reviews.  i'll write back then...

Made this with basil/tomato feta and cut back amount due to other reviews.  Probably should have used the full amount.  Was a little bland but maybe if I had used blue cheese it might be better.  I'll try it again that way.  Good otherwise.

This was so easy and sooooo good! I have made it twice and the first time I used fresh sauteed spinach instead of frozen. I sauteed fresh garlic and olive oil then cooked the spinach. I must say that it made them much better. Don't be shy on the blue cheese. Next time I might omit the flour coating and just cook them directly in olive oil with no batter, it didnt really do much for the flavor, didn't take away but didn't really add anything either. Served with garlic bread and zuchinni & squash. Thanks!

I took this dish a step further.  I browned the chicken in an iron skillet and then baked in the oven until done.  Remove chicken and keep warm. Add a can of low salt beef broth to skillet, stir up browned bits.  Strain, return to pan, add 1/2 c red wine and thicken with flour and water mixture. Serve with rice or mashed potatoes...fabulous!

Hubby is a manager at Fleming's Steakhouse (pretty darn nice)  and he is going to tell his chef about this recipe!  He doesn't even Love Blue Chz so I subd 1/2 cup of it w/ crm chz and it was Delicious!  Just the right amount of "tang" from the blue. I turned the juices into a gravy by adding a little lefover AuJus (packet) from French dips the other night, mixed well with corn starch.  Served with those great little bags of mashers the red potato kind, they're really good & easy for a side.  My kids friends were here and pretty much begged to eat here, and they ALL loved it!  (ages 2-12)  Thanks for the great recipe & it was pretty easy for the outcome.  (oh by the way... I did brown them in EVOO for a couple before baking, I know some people skipped that.)

I made this for Valentine's day and my husband loved it.  I did too.  It was soooo good.  I am not a huge blue cheese fan (he is) but it wasn't as strong as I would have thought.  Next time I might use fresh spinach.  Also I rolled it in crushed croutons and browned in bacon fat.  Really bad for you I know but it was already in the pan and it turned out really good.  We are health nuts most of the time anyways.

Moist and flavorful. I rolled the breasts in Panko before browning. Since my hubby doesn't care much for Bleu Cheese, I also served a mild hollandaise sauce to cut the strong Bleu cheese taste for him. But for the rest of us, it was delicious without the sauce. Thanks for sharing.

I used gorgonzola blue cheese, and made everything else according to the recipe.  I found that there was quite a bit of the spinach, cheese, bacon mixture leftover that just wouldn't fit inside my pounded chicken breasts.  My DH really liked this, probably more than I did.  It's pretty rich, but it's good.  Thank you, Miss J!

Crowd pleaser!  Really tasty.  Mine needed more salt, because I used a very mild blue cheese.  I added onions, garlic and rolled in bread crumbs, per other suggestions.  Excellent!

Very good.  Husband loved it.  I added garlic and onion to the spinach as others suggested.  I also cut back on the blue cheese.  Rolled the chicken in bread crumbs and fried in the bacon grease before baking.  Will definitely make again.

This was outstanding!  I didn't have any blue cheese, so I used feta cheese with sundried tomatoes and basil.  It really brought out the flavors.  I also dusted my flour mixture with Herbox chicken garlic and herb, Cavender's all purpose Greek seasoning and paprika. I served it with yellow rice and a mixed vegetable medley.  The chicken was so moist and juicy.  Not dried out like most recipes that use chicken breasts. My family, especially my husband raved about it.  After a long day of work, he was happy to come home to this dish.  "Kudos" to you for this delightful recipe!  I will definely make this one again!

I think it would have been better with a different cheese.  The blue cheese, especially if you do not like it too much, can be very overpowering.

I have made this a few times now and love it.  I had thick chicken, so I cut sliced each breast (by thickness) to make two thin breasts before pounding.  I put the filling in and rolled it, securing with a toothpick.  I added seasoned salt to the flour for a little more spice, and used the grease from the bacon instead of oil (make sure the grease is very hot!)  Delicious

The blue cheese in this dish absolutley overpowered the chicken.  My guests ate it, but no one asked for more.  Perhaps halving the cheese would make a difference.

I made this recipe without the spinach (didn't have any) and baked it in our toaster oven. It worked out wonderfully. I will make it again sometime--maybe with the spinach.

I really liked this but I had to improvise after realizing the chicken I thawed was tenderloins, not breasts.  I had planned to serve it alongside pasta in a lemon cream sauce.  So I seasoned the chicken with Old Bay, browned it in the bacon fat, then put it to the cream sauce along with the bacon, spinach and  cheese.  Also, I added some chopped artichoke hearts.  It was delish!!

Absolutely loved this recipe! Used fresh spinach sauteed in garlic, did the combo of feta and blue cheese.  Have made this 3 times already, and will continue in probable weekly rotations!  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for my family and they loved it! I added a few additions. I stuffed it with bacon, blue cheese, feta cheese, sautéed mushrooms onions and red peppers.  I also put tons of Italian seasoning on top as well as wrapped it in the bacon. Adding more flavor. Each bite was Divine! The flavors all worked well together. I'd make it again adding the same ingredients.

Wasn't bad. I would definitely recommend using fresh spinach instead of frozen. I really thought the frozen spinach gave a chewy texture. I did like the blue cheese but it is a little too overpowering and I love blue cheese. I would mix it with either feta or mozzarella.

I pretty much followed the recipe, except I added fresh garlic to the spinach and since we like Blue Cheese, I added more of that. Once the chicken breast was stuffed, I rolled the whole thing in flour and bread crumbs and fried it. Yummy

This was just so delicious.  Loved the mixture of flavors.  The only I changed was substituted boneless thigh meat instead of breasts (just my preference) and added camelized onion (mixed in with the spinach).  Worked fine.  Might consider using string instead of toothpicks next time, but really loved this one.  And I have never written a review on any recipe.

This recipe was great for us because my husband and I are on the Atkins Diet.  I didn't use flour and didn't brown the chicken.  And I used bacon bits for the filling which eliminated the need to cook and chop the bacon.  I filled the pounded chicken breasts, rolled them up and then wrapped raw bacon strips around them to secure them--didn't even need toothpicks.  Then I baked them.  For some reason, it took a lot longer than 30 minutes to cook--more like an hour.  At the end, I took the foil off so the bacon could brown a bit.  I did buy almond meal to "bread" them, but got lazy and didn't bother.  It was delicious anyway.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit with dinner guests. The only problem is we never have leftovers! I substitute gorgonzola for blue cheese, all else I do as the recipe states. Easy and very yummy.

Great recipe! I would really reccomend beating down the chicken so that you can curl it up well enough to stuff, it can be tricky. I had to use toothpicks.

Quick and easy, decided to make this at the very last minute and ended up with a delicious dish which didn't take much effort. Omitted the sautening step, I was in a hurry (actually I was starving ;), and added a garlic clove finely chopped to the filling. Also drizzled the baking pan with olive oil, added a splash of white wine and 1/4 onion thinly sliced. Cooked as directed and served with white rice (almost forgot, poured those delicious juices from the chicken-cheese and wine over the rice, mmmmmm....) Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was absolutely delish!  I did make several changes after reading many of the reviews.  I used fresh spinach, added mushrooms, garlic, oregano and basil.  I used feta cheese, it is what I had on hand.  I added 4 oz. of Alouette Garlic and Herb cheese spread to the spinach mixture.  Placed the bacon slice on top of chicken and cooked at 375 for 30 mins plus.  This will go into my rotation list.

I made this for my mother's birthday dinner last night and it was a big hit.  It is so flavorful and yummy.  I added sauteed onion and garlic and didn't use the bacon (didn't want to stink up the house), and it was still so good.  I also cut a pouch in my nice fat chicken breasts and stuffed them instead of pounding them out.  I baked it about 5 minutes longer to be sure they were done and they turned out excellent!

Excellent! I was afraid the blue cheese or bacon would take over this dish but not so. I omitted the frying and baked them for an additional 10-15 minutes.

this recipe is involved but fairly simple to make. it looks beautiful when it's finished. however, there is no need to try dealing with the hastle of stuffing then browning. i cut the pockets into the chicken, breaded, browned THEN stuffed it and this worked just fine.

This was just ok for me.  It was dry, maybe some cream cheese in the mixture would have helped....small pat of butter on each chicken roll?  I don't know.  I'm also a huge bleu cheese fan...but it just didn't seem to have a place here.  I made up extra to freeze so I'm going to come up with a sauce to pour over top when I have this again.

There is no way this cooks in 30 minutes. it looked delicious, but it took way longer than 30 minutes to cook and we used 3 chicken breasts instead of six. Maybe everybody should check their cooking times on all these recipes because they are NEVER right.

I made this for my husband last night for his birthday.  He loves spinach stuffed chicken so I figured I'd give this a try.  It was soooo good and a big hit with him!  The only criticism I give is that it was kind of hard to make.  I kept getting frustrated trying to fold over the chicken and keep it closed with toothpicks.  When I had to brown them in the pan, I was afraid all the stuffing would come out, so I only browned one side.  But that didn't really matter in the end.  I just had to bake it a little longer (about 10 more minutes).  Also, I had way more stuffing than chicken, so what was leftover I just sprinkled on top before baking.  Again, so good!  But I think it will only be made on special occasions.

Good recipe...I sauted onions and garlic and added to the spinach and cheese mixture.  I too did not flour and brown.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper, added the spinach/cheese mixture (I used feta), folded over and baked 15 minutes covered and an additional 20 minutes uncovered.  It's deelish but needs a sauce.  I used the pan drippings and created a tastey sauce.

This is SO amazingly good!!  I try to live the low carb lifestyle so I ditched the flour, and didn't fry it before I put it in the oven.  Threw in some chopped onions and minced garlic, and used half feta and half blue cheese - was phenomenal!!

I didn't care for the blue cheese.. a little overwhelming, but I will try it again with a different kind.

I made this dish for friends tonight and everyone loved it. Even my bf who hates spinach. I did make some changes though... I didnt brown the chicken just put it in the dish and baked it for 45 min, I did add basalmic dressing to add flavor. I also didnt have bleu cheese so i used a mix of feta and goat cheese. I will def be making this again soon!!

WE  THOUGHT THIS RECIPE WAS WONDERFUL. THE ONLY CHANGE I MADE WAS : BAKING CHICKEN ABOUT 15 MINUTES AFTER I SEASONED IT. POUR OFF THE JUICES.THEN I SPREADED THE SPINACH/ BLUE CHEESE/CREAM CHEESE  MIXTURE OVER CHICHEN THEN BAKED .I USED 3/4 CUPS OF BLUE CHEESE AND IT WAS NOT TOO MUCH. I ALSO SAUTEED GARLIC AND ONION.I PUT THE BACON ON CHICKEN THEN THE SPINACH MIXTURE.MY HUSBAND SAID'IT WAS OFF THE CHAIN'. I WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN SHORTLY!!!!!!!!!!!!

As a previous reviewer said, if you don't like bleu cheese, use feta cheese; very yummy.  Great recipe.

Wow! My new husband and I made this as our first at home dinner back from our honeymoon and it was fabulous!  We were both impressed with how easy it was in addition to how wonderful it tasted.  I did do a few minor modifications.  I butterflied the chicken then stuffed and folded over (we didn't have toothpicks) and it seemed to hold the mixture perfectly, and I added a tad bit of garlic to the spinach mixture.  This will be a definate addition to our meal rotation.  Great dinner recomendation!

I love blue cheese, but I found it a tad overpowering in this recipe. Maybe the cheese I used was just a bit too strong for this, but I thought it was fairly mild compared to what I usually eat :) Next time I'll cut back a bit on the cheese, and try to find a milder variety.

You have to LOVE, LOVE, LOVE bleu cheese. I like it but it overpowered the entire meal. It seemed to have somehow seeped into the chicken breasts too.It was okay, but my husband told me it was the first recipe he did not like that I made off of All Recipes. Its sounds yummy when you describe it but it just didn't tatse as good as I expected...I followed the recipe exactly. I'm sure its fabulous to those of you who LOVE bleu cheese. BUT...if you don't save yourself the time. Thanks for the recipe but it just didn't do it for me. =)

Great flavors in this recipe.  As others recommended, I sauteed diced onion and garlic, then added fresh spichach and blue cheese.  I also sliced the breasts, then breaded and browned in oven-safe skillet (that I used for the bacon).  Once browned, I stuffed and put the skillet in the oven.  Great recipe!

I had 3 leftover plain baked split chicken breasts in the fridge and I didn't feel like making chicken salad with them. So that led me to this recipe. I used turkey bacon and feta cheese instead of the blue cheese and pork bacon. I also used fresh baby spinach and some diced fresh tomatoes. I sauteed the spinach with garlic, salt, pepper, and the tomatoes. I sprinkled the tops of the stuffed breasts with parmesean cheese. Turned out great!  Thank you!

LOVE THIS DINNER!  My boyfriend and I eat this recipe at least 2 times a month.  I add a little cayenne pepper, 1 clove of garlic, and 1/2 onion, chopped, to the spinach mixture.  Also, I brown the chicken breasts in the bacon drippings first.  I just butterfly the breasts after I have browned them about a minute on each side and stuff as much of the mixture as I can into the chicken.

One of my all-time favorite chicken dishes. I make enough for my husband and me one night, then freeze the remaining stuffed chicken. Simply thaw and cook the next time you want an awesome dinner without the time it takes to prepare!

I used bread crumbs to coat and baked. I also dulled down the intensity of the blue cheese by using half blue cheese and half cream cheese. Good, but I felt like it needed some sort of sauce to go? Will try again.

Fantastic recipe... Everyone who tried it loves it.. and promptly passed out on the couch :) I changed it a little, added a few slices more bacon, only used 5oz of blue cheese (too much of this ruins the taste of the chicken) and added some parmesean cheese to fuse the tastes. Also, i quickly breaded the chicken, and then after taking the chicken out of the oven i sprinkled some blue cheese over the top to give it some color. But those are personal changes... I loved this though, it's going to be in my rotation from now on. Healthy, tastes good, and is so tasty it should cause some sort of terminal disease.

I did this a little backwards (trying to do it from memory:) I wrapped the raw bacon around the stuffed chicken, baked it for 30 minutes and then browned it in the skillet.  My husband loves this dish, thanks!

Delicious. I substituted 1/2 the amount of blue cheese with cream cheese and used plump chicken breasts (just cut a hole in it and stuffed them). I browned the meat before stuffing it. The other reviewers are right, there was a lot of filling left over. No worries, I'm going to buy more chicken and have it again tomorrow.  However, if I were to make it again in the future, I'd cut the filling mixture measurements in half.

Wow!  This was an amazing dish!  The flavors went so well together.  This recipe is very simple and yet it tastes like a gormet dish!  Definately an easy dinner to impress company with!  It goes really well paired with Parmesan or mushroom Orzo.

I really liked this recipe. I always have a hard time stuffing things - filling ends up oozing out of a hole I missed - but the flavor was great. I had a ton of filling left over so I scrambled some egg beaters with it the next morning.

This recipe was excellent - a treat for a regular dinner and an impressive dish for company  I've made this three time and have gotten rave reviews.  I used turkey bacon once and lean ham cut in thin strips another time instead of regular bacon and it was just as good.  I am going to try adding pine nuts next time at the suggestion of another reviewer

I used ham instead of bacon because that is what was in the fridge, I didn't bother to fry before putting in the oven but it turned out really well. Took other reviewers advice and added some mayo and sour cream to the cheese/spinach mixture.

Sooooooo good and relatively easy to put together. I modified it slightly by adding some feta and mozzarella cheese along with some minced garlic, and it was absolutely amazing! My boyfriend said he was puttin it on his top ten list of favorite meals.

It was good, but I substituted feta cheese for blue cheese as we don't like blue cheese, and the filling was too dry. I would add some mayonnaise next time. Otherwise, the flavours were very good and chicken was moist.

Make ssure you like blue cheese before using it in this recipe. I thought I did, but I had to scrape out the spinach mixture after getting a few bites of the blue cheese. Other than the cheese, this is a A+ recipe. I can't wait to make again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish..only had feta on hand and used it, next I will try the blue cheese...and also used 'real bacon bits',because I did not have bacon. Easy and fun to make. Thanks!

I LOVE blue cheese but this did not hit the spot for me. Chicken was extremely tender and moist but the flavor combination just wasn’t there. Next time I might ditch the spinach completely or add garlic/onions to add more flavor.

Delicious!
I substituted a Swiss cheese, because that’s what I had in the fridge, and loved the flavors.
Will definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe! I made an account just to save and rate this :) I followed it almost exactly, except I added sauteed onions and fresh minced garlic to the spinach mixture. I had a little extra of the stuffing mixture, so I put it on top of the chicken breasts while cooking in the oven. I made this for an "at home" date night, and we both loved it. Cant wait to make this again. Thank you!

If you follow the instructions precisely, it will come out perfect!  The chicken was moist, and the spinach and blue cheese was delicious as well.  This was my first time making it, and my boyfriend loved it!  It would also be good with some sun-dried tomatoes and/or artichoke hearts added to the stuffing.  
Important!  Pan-frying the chicken to a light brown took a little longer than "quickly" (as the recipe says), but it was totally worth it!

I made this for dinner last night!  It was delicious. I did add a few things.  I made it for just the two of us so only used half the bacon. I used a little of the bacon fat to sauté a few baby portabellas along with some garlic and roasted red peppers. Then I put in the fresh spinach and a little Marsala wine and cooked until all the moisture was gone. Let it cool and added the blue cheese. I used whole chicken breasts and butterflied and pounded!  They were delicious and my husband raved about them!

it was ok.  In the future i would probably add a little cream cheese to it to make it a smoother filling.  I did add carrots and capers to it.

I didn't add bacon but did crumb & cream the blue cheese and added garlic to the mix.  I used golden breadcrumbs, have prepped in advance because this is a winner for a chicken dinner(as it stated on someones review). I had it with mixed roasted vegetables.

I'm giving this recipe four stars for the simple reason, and as others mentioned, it needs a bit of adjustments.  I added finely chopped garlic and onion to the filling and added some mayo.   I also went for the blue cheese/feta cheese combination and it worked out well.  This is a really good recipe with some minor adjustments needed.  Very delicious.

I've made this several times, following the recipe exactly, and my husband and I have both really liked it.  Usually, I have a lot of extra filling, so you can cut back on the filling ingredients slightly.  Tonight, I decided to stuff the chicken breasts instead of pounding them and rolling the filling inside.  I baked them for the same amount of time and at the same temperature, and they turned out beautifully.  For my preference though, I'll cook them for a little less time, 20-25 minutes next time.

This was delicious!  I was a little short on blue cheese so I added only about a 1/4 cup of blue cheese, and then made up for it by adding about 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella.  I also used fresh spinach and sautéed it.  I also didn't bother dredging it in flour, just threw it in the pan with a little bit of olive oil.  We LOVED this dish!

Really good. My husband and family loved it.
 I used just 1 cup of cooked spinach, drained. That's enought for filling 4 chicken breasts.
I also only used 1/2 cup of blue cheese and added 6Tbsp of fat free cream cheese, to make it more "creamy".
I put salt and pepper on the chicken inside and outside to give more flavor.
I mixed 1/2 cup of crumb bread, 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese, salt and pepper and covered the chicken with this mix. Baked at 400° for around 40 minutes.
Delicious!

We really liked this.  I used and mix of Brie and Cambonzola cheese and it was really yummy.  Instead of pounding the chicken breasts, I opened up pockets in them, which worked just fine.  I tied them closed with kitchen string.  This will be a repeat dinner!

Oh man was this heaven! My hubby and I both agree this might be our favorite chicken dish! After reading a few reviews, I did make the adjustments suggested. This is what I did to mouthwatering deliciousness: 

Sautéed fresh spinach and arugula in the bacon grease along with some chopped green onion, 2 cloves of garlic, & added in some red quinoa. I added this mixture to 1/2 parts feta cheese & half parts 1/2 blue cheese & added a dollop of light Mayo.  I salted and peppered the flayed, pounded, chicken and put all that goodness into the halves. I had pre-floured them, so I just put them in the hot pan to sear the outside, put it in the oven, covered in tin foil for 30 minutes and BAM - so so good.

Just awesome. I always have trouble with the mechanics of pound/stuff/roll/secure when stuffing chicken breasts, so I just cut a pocket in mine and stuffed them that way instead. I took another reviewer's advice and instead of breading/frying first, I just wrapped my chicken breasts in bacon and baked them that way. The bacon held them together without the need for toothpicks. Easier prep PLUS more bacon. Win.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! My husband ate spinach! My kids ate spinach! And they all loved it! My changes were: used feta instead of blue cheese, sauteed onions and garlic then heated spinach in skillet for a few minutes before mixing in the bacon and feta cheese. I will make this regularly because the fam loves it, its low-carb, and its DELlCIOUS! Did I mention that my husband ate spinach? ... AND my kids??? Thank you!

I love this recipe and have made it many times, but tonight I changed it a little. I laid my chicken on the bottom of the pan and used some italian seasoning. I tossed the spinach with crumbled bacon, bleu cheese, lemon, salt and pepper. I covered the top of the chicken with the spinach mixture. I baked at 350 for 35 minutes. While it was baking I sauted some rotini with lemon, butter, a little cream, salt and pepper. I served the chicken on top of the pasta. It was a huge hit. Even my picky 2 year old liked it.

Oooooo.... big let down. Followed the recipe to a T. Just didn't work for me or my family despite the fact that we love all these ingredients. Our take is that the blue cheese was overwhelming and the spinach was soggy/mushy. And the chicken breasts were thick and took forever to cook.

It was good , i used a strong cheddar, and sauted  onion and garlic then added it to the spinach .I used fresh spincch which I  wilted  with boiling water.  i seasoned  the chicken with a chicken spice before sauteing.The meat was  tasty and moist., which is always a worry with chicken breasts. Covering with foil helps keeping it juicy and moist, - Madeleine

Oh this was so good!!!  I made just a few adjustments.  I chopped-up 12 pieces of bacon, instead of eight, used canned spinach and after slicing open the breast, with a boning knife, I then used a mallet and after filling it with the spinach and bleu cheese bits, used string to tie-up the breast, before browning and through the cooking process.  Served with a side of beefsteak tomato slices and EVERYBODY was happy, REAL happy!!!!  Note: I would have been satisfied with half of a breast, but I ate the whole thing!!!!

have had this before without tweaking it..good recipe. You can use other cheeses in the filling. Took 2 foil containers of cream cheese,1/2 cup of grated jack, added diced garlic, then took the bacon and sauteed onion and hit it real quick with my food processor...added a splash of evoo and used that as filling

Excellent! 

I used leftover Turkey Breast,(a half inch slice on the top and a half inch slice for the bottom) floured, sauteed 40 seconds each side, added (75% Blue cheese, bacon, spinach & 25% cream cheese mixture)added toothpicks to make a sammy, and re-entered it into the same saute pan, covered for 2-3 minutes on lower heat...
On the side, a 75% turnip & 25% rutabagas mashed w/butter, Salt & White Pepper to your preference...Yummy. 

Thank you for your artistic integrity.

Excellent! I didn't have enough spinach, only 10 ounces so I added about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs, delish!! 

My husband is a big guy and he was stuffed with one chicken roll and a small side salad. The rolls were just as good if not better reheated for lunch!

Very tasty recipe. I used sharp white cheddar cheese instead of blue cheese, because we aren't blue cheese fans.

I thought that the blue cheese was very strong but liked it with the spinach-i was feeling like I could have saved some calories if the bacon wasn't there because I didnt' think it added a ton to the taste. The chicken was SUPER moist. Next time I am going to try another kind of cheese as my kids THOUGHT they liked blue cheese but what they like is blue cheese dressing!

This was declicious... easy to prepare. Added some Philly Cooking Creme the Savory Garlic. To brown the chicken, I was bad and used the bacon drippings with a little olive oil.... mmmmm well worth the extra calories.

Fabulous flavor combinations!!  Works with both fresh and frozen spinach - I just used what I had on hand.  I added chopped onion and garlic and sauteed it to soften it, then threw in the spinach.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion too and served it with a cream sauce from one of the chicken cordon bleu recipes on this website.  Took the rest for lunch the next day and was Soooooo impressed with my own cooking.  LOL  This recipe is on my fridge as a "stand by."  The next time I have blue cheese in the house, I will make.

Fantastic recipe! The only thing different I did was use fresh spinach that I cooked a bit first, and I used Oscar Meyer cooked bacon. The whole family loved it. Its very rich though, so don't do what I did and serve a rich side dish...I chose to make home made scalloped potatoes and the two rich dishes, while both delicious, were too much together. Definitely some rice pilaf for us next time to compliment this fantastic recipe!

We really liked this but next time we will serve it with bleu cheese and feta and probably make the spinach separate from the chicken.

This recipe was superb!  I used gorgonzola because I didn't have blue cheese.  It was milder in taste, and creamier than blue, and the chicken was moist and tender.  This dish not only tasted like a restaurant dish, but it presented exceptionally well.  My family loved it.  Thank you for a terrific chicken dish that I will make again!

I used frozen spinach that wasn't all the way thawed. I think it kept the chicken amazingly moist... However, I couldn't even TASTE bleu cheese and using another reader's advice I added some garlic which overpowered everything.  I'll have to try again.

This recipe is amazing!  I made it for my family and my parents and my mom said it was the best meat she'd ever had!  My husband who is not typically a chicken breast fan LOVED it!  But the true test was my 3 year old...who ate all of it off his plate!  I plan on making this a regular for our family!

This is a really good recipe!  Great for blue cheese lovers!  I think it might be easier though to brown the chicken before adding the filling, otherwise it willing be spilling out onto the pan.  I also think this recipe is very good with chopped sun dried tomatoes.

Loved it!  Did not change a thing!  My husband thought the blue cheese was just a touch strong so next time I'm going to mix up the feta and blue cheese for something different.  Fantastic - thanks for sharing!

This was delicious and the whole family liked it! I seasoned breadcrumbs instead of flour, coated the chicken with the breadcrumbs and baked. Turned out great.

This was very good.  I made two breasts w/blue cheese for my husband and me and the other two w/kid friendly cheeses that I had (something tamer) for the kids.  Both turned out good.  My hubby and I thought this was great the kids just liked.  There was extra stuffing, so as other readers suggested, I put on top and that just made it better.  Also, I did add a bit of cream cheese because the mixture seemed dry (others had suggested).  This made it!

This has become one of my boyfriend's favorite dinners and was also a big hit with my family on Christmas Eve.  I substitute feta for blue cheese because of pick eaters and as recommended by other reviewers, add a tablespoon of light mayo to help everything stick along with turkey bacon instead of regular.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Wonderful recipe!  I preferred wrapping the chicken with the bacon as opposed to the way the recipe is written.  This allowed saving time by not having to brown with flour before hand.  Just baked for the 30 min and it was spectacular!

Although I didn't have bacon OR blue cheese, this recipe still came out fantastically! I substituted spreadable Swiss and grated Asiago cheese. The boyfriend and I both felt it would have been too salty with both bacon and blue cheese, but I might still try the original recipe. I also butterflied the chicken, rather than pounding it flat.

i made this recipe, though i followed a few of the other raters,and changed a few of things...i only used 4 strips of bacon (i only had 4) i used fresh spinach and steamed it in the microwave and squeezed it dry. i pounded the breast thin, but did not split them,i left them whole and slit them and filled them like an envelope. it worked perfectly, and they baked wonderfully. they were tender and delicious.  my husband hates blue cheese and devoured these!  when i told him they had blue cheese in them he almost died! hahaha!! but he has requested them several times!  this is a definite keeper!! thanks for the great recipe!!

This recipe was pretty tasty! I had trouble getting all of the stuffing to fit into the chicken. So, I put some in the chicken before I browned it. Then I stuffed the chicken as much as I could after it was browned and then put the rest on top of the chicken in the baking dish. Yum!

i made this recipe.  I did add provalone cheese to the chicken.  I also rolled them up as though I was making keiv.  I let them rest for 30 minutes.  I browned them in a large skillet and completed them in the oven on 350 for 20 minutes.  My family loved them.  My daughter even had this meal for breakfast the next day!

I just hate people who review recipes and start with "the only changes I made were", but here I am doing that.  My hubby doesn't like blue cheese, so I substituted some very flavorful swiss instead.  After reading several reviews about it not being flavorful enough, I sauteed mushrooms, onions and garlic in a little of the bacon grease.  Mixed the spinach, swiss, mushrooms, bacon, onion and garlic together.  It was OK, but still not quite flavorful enough for us. I do like blue cheese so perhaps I can try it when he's out of town.

My family enjoyed this very much, even though I thought they wouldn't because of strong blue cheese is.  However, I would make one modification.  Instead of flattening the chicken breasts and trying to fold or roll them around the filling, it is WAY easier to cut a pocket in them to stuff them.  It looks nicer that way as well.

This was the daily emailed recipe, it sounded good so I gave it try.  Wow!!  What a great treat!  I love blue cheese and spinach so it was perfect for me.  My husband thought the blue cheese was a bit strong and thought it lacked something.  He thought maybe mushrooms and garlic.  We will definitely make this again though.  Yum Yum!!

This was great, with some modifications - I don't like bacon, so I left that out.  I used 3/4 cup bleu cheese and 1/4 cup ricotta (so it was creamier).  I also added 1 tablespoon of italian seasoning and a few shakes of garlic powder to the mix.  Also added garlic powder to the flour mixture, and surrounded the chicken with the leftover spinach mixture, and added 1/2 can of diced tomoatoes.  It was fantastic!

Delicious!! My 2 year old LOVED this recipe!  And my husband has requested this be put in the menu rotation.  I modified it a bit. I substituted feta cheese for bleu.  Instead of browning in oil, I coated with bread crumbs and baked it.

Very nice dish! I used butterflied pork chops instead of the chicken and added chopped mushrooms to the mix along with sauteed garlic and onion. I think next time I may make a mushroom sauce to pour over the meat while baking. Thank you so much Judy!

What more to say but YUM!!?!  I made it per the recipe and it was great.  The pounded chicken was a bit hard to work with so I think I would follow other suggestions and brown the whole breast and then butterfly and stuff next time.  Thanks!!

This was simply amazing.  The flavor was so intense and so incredible.  I sauteed fresh spinach with garlic since I did not have any frozen and also coated in breadcrumbs flavored with oregeno, parsley, parmesean cheese and garlic salt.  Absolutely wonderful!  I cannot wait to make this again.

I was pleasantly surprised to get such elegant results from a quick and easy recipe like this one. Like other reviewers, I wrapped the chicken breasts in a thick, pepper-crusted bacon and put them under a broiler for the final few minutes. This recipe is a definite keeper and is going into my regular rotation!

I followed the recipe closely, but don't think I'll make it again. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE blue cheese, but the blue seemed to overpower everything else. I barely tasted the bacon and I found the spinach was kind of boring.

I wrapped the chicken in the bacon strips rather than putting the bacon in the filling, and I probably won't do that next time - it made the bacon flavor too strong.  Other than that, it was a good main dish and great way to get some veggies in.  I might try broccoli next time.

I thought this was phenomenal, but my rating isn't really fair as  I made two significant changes. My husband and I don't care for blue cheese at all, so I subbed with feta, and I was out of bacon (what's up with that?!). I served it with Garlic Parmesan Orzo (this site) and fresh melon slices. Yum!

This is an awesome recipe! I tried it once as written, and it was good. Then, the second time I had extra stuffing which sat in the fridge and marinated for 2 days. That definitely kicked it up a notch in flavor. Next time I'm going to put in pine nuts. A keeper for sure!

I really liked this recipe very much.  My family however was not thrilled with it. I think it was the blue cheese taste. I love blue cheese but very rarely cook with it.  I did reduce the blue cheese to 1/2 cup but I think next time I will use all cheddar for them and keep the blue cheese in just for me.
  I used chopped broccoli instead of spinach (family prefers broccoli.)  And, like other reviewers I agree that it was too dry so I added 1 tsp of mayo, 1 tsp of sour cream and 1 tsp of blue cheese dressing.

It was fair.  Wouldn't make it again.  Too time-consuming to be no tastier than what it was.

Very nice recipe! It seemed like there was a bit too much stuffing for the chicken breast as it was hard to keep it all together, but other than that it was very tasty.
