This is very close to what my mother made for me as a child. She'd melt butter and mix with powder sugar to make a dough. Then she'd kinda mash/roll it out and spread peanut butter on it and roll it up like a log. Then she'd slice, refrigerate and YUMMY candy is eaten! I will definitely try this recipe, as it is similar but maybe not quite as messy.

This is a fine, easy candy.  I like it when I need to make something quickly but don't have time to go to the grocery (these are cupboard staples for me) or make it.  

Additions I've made include using crunch peanut butter, rolling or mixing in mini M&Ms, rolling in chopped milk and/or white chocolate chips, etc.

These have a good flavor and are a bit chewy.  They are tastier than the peanut butter balls with just milk powder and honey, which I do not like.  I had to come back today and change my rating from a 3 to a 4 because after sitting in the fridge all night, I kept going back to get another one.  They are a bit oily on your fingers and don't keep their round ball shape and really stick to the plate, so not the best for taking somewhere or gift giving.  But I will make again for a quick snack when I need something sweet/chewy.  I want to use crunchy peanut butter or add nuts next time!

I am going to make these like little pumpkins (adding orange paste color), imprint some grooves on the outside and put a chocolate chip on top for a stem.

My Dad made this when we were kids and later when my grandchildren were old enough to help he started to make it again. He passed away last year and this really brings him back... easy to make, I roll the balls in powdered sugar or cocoa for a different taste.

This is a great recipe to make with a young child or for peanut butter lovers of any age.  They taste great!  They remind me of peanut butter cookie dough...yum.  There is a lot of room for variation to this recipe too...like adding chocolate.

This was easy and fast. Made a bunch of candies. I followed the recipe exactly. Keep these cold as they get too soft at room temperature. I make the criss cross marks on the top like Peanut Butter Cookies (with a fork)and it also smushes them down. YUM!!!! They don't last long around here.

Haven't had these since childhood!  This is really close to the recipe the was in our weekly reader in the early 70's!  The only difference is mix in 1/2 cup raisins, then roll balls in flaked coconut. Yummy
Thanks for posting!

I found this recipe last night and had to make it.  When I was a little kid, we often had "peanut butter playdough" at snack time and it was one of my favorites.  This recipe is just like it!  I enjoyed mixing it up and it tastes quite yummy. I didn't have much corn syrup and had to use half honey, which lended a very nice flavor. I might try rolling them in little M&Ms next time.  Thank you for a quick, easy and yummy candy recipe!

Made these as directed and they turned out to be very tasty.  They were quite soft, but the taste was excellent!  So quick to make that I will make them often.
