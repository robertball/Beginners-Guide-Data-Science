Since this recipe didn't have any reviews when I made it I was completely faithful to it. I think that if you make multiple modifications to a recipe then declare it is excellent you are really reviewing your version - not the original.

That said, as written this recipe produces a frittata with a very nice texture. If I were to make it again, I would make these changes to suit my taste: this needs more asparagus, maybe 1/4 cup of parmesan, garlic (saut√©ed with the onion and mushrooms) and freshly ground black pepper. I think diced black or kalamata olives would be a nice addition too.

I had this with whole wheat toast and fruit, but my husband ate it with leftover sriracha noodles (from this site) and said that it was a great combination. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I had some fresh asparagus and this was a wonderful way to use it.  A lot of breakfast casseroles I've tried are so-so but this was really good, especially considering there was no added salt.  The only modification I made was using 8 eggs because I don't have egg beaters and I was too lazy this morning to separate egg whites.  Serve with salsa and a little sour cream, yum!
