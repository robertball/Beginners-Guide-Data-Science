I really enjoyed this simple and tasty recipe for cooking a whole chicken.  It's a unique flavor that's tangy, savory, and different from any other marinade I've ever had.  I couldn't get the color right even after 55 minutes on a closed grill (temp fluctuated between 300 and 380 F), but another 10 minutes in a convection oven followed by a few under the broiler got it right.

I have made this many time I have cooked it in a pan, in the oven , and finally on the grill I have to say my favorite way to cook it was on the grill. Everyone loves this dish even my kids because it's a bit on the sweet side from the honey. I did however leave out the cayenne pepper and hot sauce my family doesn't really care for a lot of spice this recipe was still amazing

I had light yellow rather than white miso. It still worked. I've cooked this on the grill and also in a pan in the oven with added chicken broth (in the style of Greek Lemon Chicken and Potatoes, turning rather than dipping). Both were delicious, but if you are cooking in the oven, you might want to line your pan. It was not easy to clean.

We really loved this. I did not make any changes and it was amazing. Simple, flavorful, and the meat was so juicy and tender.
