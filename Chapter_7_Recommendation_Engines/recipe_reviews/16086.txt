It needs a lot more spice; the second time I made it, I added oregano, salt, pepper, and garlic, which improved it immensely.  My husband LOVED it. I thought it was just okay.

On taste, this recipe probably rated a three.  I gave it an extra star for ease of preperation though.  I took the left overs to my mother's house and she agreed the taste was good, not great, but was impressed when I told her how easy the dish was to make.  
I used cresent rolls rather than the crust the recipe calls for.  My 16 month old daughter like it and ate a fair amount.  I thought it was okay, a little bland and mostly what I could taste was the sauce.  I used Paul Newman Marinara sauce for mine.  I will probably keep the recipe in mind for those nights I need something really fast and easy.

Since I had a can of crescent rolls, I used those for the topping. I also added salt & pepper.  I thought the recipe tasted good, but my family didn't care for the veggies in it.  Next time, I'll try to make it taste more like a plain bacon cheeseburger.

Okay folks....first timer at rating.  This was awesome.  I couldn't believe how easy it was and how good it tasted. I took the advice of other regarding the recipe for the crust and made some adjustments because the original recipe seemed too eggy. Instead, I used the recipe for J.P's Big Daddy Biscuits (also from this site..takes 5 minutes to make in a food processor)and just rolled the dough out and placed it on top.  My kids have already asked me to make this again.  Definitely a keeper.

This was really good and easy to make during a busy work week. 
I left out the tomatoes and green pepper but added pepperoni and mushrooms as well 1T parmesean cheese. I took the advice of others and used a pkg of crescent rolls for the crust and it worked out great. Thanks for the recipe especially my children!

it was easy, i had all the ingriediants in my pantry and fridge and hubby absolutely loves it.  He brags about it at work.  I use either my homemade pizza sauce i found on this site or just whatever extra is in the fridge from spaghetti night.  Great husband pleasing recipe, so i bet kids love it too.

My kid loved this and asked for it again!  Update:. I have made this several times and have come to the conclusion that, although delicious, it really doesn't taste like pizza.  It reminds us of a casserole or maybe more like lasagna.  Anyway, I double the recipe and make one with mushrooms added into the beef and add garlic powder into the dough mix.  The other with onions as the recipe states and Italian seasoning in the dough mix.  I omit the green pepper and tomatoes completely and I used a full pound of bacon and divided between the two... that gave them both a really good amount of bacon flavor.  Great recipe and very easy!  P.S. A jar of spaghetti sauce works perfectly if you don't have pizza sauce.

My Children and all their friends loved this...only thing I did different was use real bacon bits instead of frying the bacon...made it even easier and quicker.

I noticed this is one of those recipes that the leftovers taste better than the just cooked version. Don't get me wrong. It was still good, and can be great with a couple adjustments. First of all I like the idea of using some refrigerated crescent roll dough to lay on top instead of using a batter. The crust was a little mushy underneath, and I think a dough would prevent that. I also think it could've uses a little more of a kick. Some hot sauce or chilli powder would probably do the trick.

this didn't taste much like a pizza or a bacon cheeseburger. it probably needs more bacon to actually get the flavor. i added in extra seasoning (salt and pepper), after reading other reviews. and instead of making the dough topping, i put refrigerated pillsbury pizza crust dough over the top and trimmed any edges that were hanging over the casserole dish. overall, this dish needs some adjusting of flavors.

I must have done something wrong because we did not like it at all - it was very bland and the crust was tasteless. we ended up eating PBJ. I will try it again but will have to go with some of the variations recommended.

Thought it was good, the kids loved it and so did my husband, the only thing I would change is it calls for 2 eggs and I only use one, if you use 2 it taste to much like scrambled eggs on top.

Kid approved!  Made as directed but did add garlic and oregano as many reviews said it was bland.  (Did not use green peppers because I dont like them.)  Wish I had saved out more of the bacon for the top of the pizza instead of in the meat as I want to be able to taste it more.  I used bread flour instead of AP flour since many said that they wish they had used bisquick or premade croissants or biscuits.  (I didnt have any of that.)  I also liked adding the extra cheese to the top.  Over all it was an easy recipe and every one liked it.  Would make again.
Oh, then pan size was an issue for me.  I ended up using a 8x11 which seemed the right size.  when I used anything larger, there wasnt enough spread to go around the bottom.  At dinner, husband suggested that could have been on purpose to make it more like a pizza but I liked the fluffier "crust" that the smaller size created.  So, your call on that.

This recipe was very good, I added Canadian bacon and pepperoni to it but it was a little to acidic. Next time I think I will omit the pepperoni but keep the Canadian bacon. :)

I used ground turkey and added some seasoning like salt and pepper, garlic and oregano. I also used turkey bacon. I would suggest to brown the veggies first then adding the meat. I didn't use tomatoes because I didn't have any.  The cheese and bacon do not come through at all in this recipe. And the top crust is a little funky and barely there when it is all cooked. Too much meat not enough crust.  By choosing lower fat/ healthy options I was able to reduce this to 320 calories per serving and only 14 grams of fat.

Pretty good!  I used a pizza crust mix from package because I have a ton from when they were on sale.  I'm really not good with pizza dough (I don't know how everyone got theirs stretched over a 9x13!) so i just pressed it into the bottom.  So...I guess I had a right-side-up pizza.  Left out the green peppers because I didn't have any, but the tomatoes gave it a nice fresh taste.  I also used a smaller pan, I think somewhere around a 7x12.  Very easy to put together, and the taste was great for how easy it was.

I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and used turkey bacon to make it healthier. I also baked it in the skillet I used to brown the meat (less dishes for me to clean). It was good and I will make again.

I omitted the bacon and added a packet of taco seasoning and some spices to the ground beef.  Like other reviewers, I used the crescent rolls over top.  It was easy and delicious and the boyfriend loved it!

This recipe is pretty good the way it is but adding your personal touches will make it even better.I just added garlic,salt and pepper to the meat mixture and omitted the bacon. The crust is plain but still good and just the right amount of crust to our liking.It is easy to add more flavour to it if you'd like. Definatly a keeper for a quick meal on busy weeknights.Added some ceasar salad on the side.

This was just OK. I'm not sure what it needed to be better, but we weren't overly impressed by it. I have a sloppy joe casserole recipe that is similar which we like much better.

Was very good, be sure to let all the crust get golden brown. Also next time I will try seasoning the crust, maybe with some Italian seasoning.

This was awesome! Made it just as is, but added a little more bacon, and of course, added spices to the beef and onion while cooking, but, who doesn't! My hubby and kids loved this, I will definitely make it again! I was going to follow a lot of other advice on here due to previous reviews, and I'm glad I didn't! Some extra spice like salt and pepper and garlic powder and 1 or 2 extra slices of bacon is all I changed, and it was great!

I've made this twice now.  First basically according to the directions.  It did seem a little "thin" in the pan. Needed a little something else.  The second time I made it I used a can of sloppy joe sauce, turkey bacon (added a little extra to the mix and to the top) and extra cheese.  I also baked mine in an 8X8 pan and that made it deep and thick.  My husband and I liked it better that way.  I might still keep playing with it though.

Yummy! Pretty easy, and so tasty! I played with this recipe a little, I used a 26oz jar of Classico spaghetti sauce instead of the reccomended amount of pizza sauce, and added a bit of garlic powder and italian seasonings for extra flavor. I also threw in a can of mushrooms, I think adding some diced pepperoni would have been good as well! I used 1 cup of bisquick with the reccomended amount of milk and eggs for the crust, which turned out very nice. I also sprinkled about 1-2 cups of mozzarella cheese on top for the last 10 minutes. I had to bake about 40 minutes total.

My Husband said this was the best meal ever.  Of course he would think that a pizza dish is the way to go.
Here are some changes that I made.
Sub pizza crust Add more cheddar cheese and some Motz cheese
Add Italian seasoning to beef and top crust with Parmesan and Italian seasoning.  Use diced tomatoes drained rather than fresh roma.

This was very good and very easy to make.  I followed the recipe, except I also added pepper to the topping mixture, and thought it tasted great, although we all agreed it didn't really remind us of pizza.  Maybe with mozzarella cheese instead or a little sausage.

The people who are saying yuck to the crust, must not have done it right. It was wonderfl. I made it last night for my boyfriend (who is way too picky) And he ate 1/2 of the recipe. Mushrroms work really well, as does red pepper flakes.

I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the meat, doubled the cheese, used a whole pack of bacon, and baked mine in a 9x9 pan, adding about 10 more minutes to the bake time. My fiance said he'd eat the whole pan if I didn't stop him!

I've made this recipe twice and everyone who ate it loved it. It's easy and quick to prepare. No rolling or preparing dough. It's great if you have guests over and you just want to male a fast, inexpensive meal.

Made this tonight and thought it was great! I did not have any green peppers so I omitted that but added in a little extra garlic. 3 kids and a picky husband thought it was great, too. Its hard to find a dish that everyone likes and this one was pretty easy to make so it is a winner for us! 

I think the pizza sauce you use makes a difference on flavor, so pick one that you like!

The first time I made this, it was good, although I felt it was missing a little flavor. The second time, I added some fresh basil, and diced salami, and reduced the tomatoes in half. That was great. Next time, I will add the green pepper and onion just before going into the oven. Overall, a really good recipe!

YUM!  We love this recipe.  It's a bit of work, but very worth it.  It makes plenty for leftovers (just the two of us) so it's a great bonus.

I have made this twice now and I can't get over how good it is.  I leave out the tomatoes and the peppers as there is an allergy.  for the topping i use the Betty Crocker Biscuit mix Cheese-garlic flavor for the topping.  I use that in place of the flour and wow I love how it tastes on top.  I used my own pizza sauce that I have been making for years which works well with this recipe.  Its quick and easy and tastes great

After reading the reviews I was really excited to make this recipe.  It seemed many commented on it being a little bland, but I thought I could fix that by seasoning the ground beef mixture well.  I thought it turned out pretty good. My boyfriend said he liked it but didn't seem really excited about it. I guess I share his sentiments on that it was good, but not anything I would really care to repeat again.

This was good and made for something different for a change. I added fresh garlic into my meat while cooking it and some pepper. I added in some onion powder, garlic powder, and basil into the topping mixture. Left out the tomatoes and green peppers because I know my daughter will not eat them.

Oh my gosh!  This is DELICIOUS!  I don't really care for green peppers, but it was still great.  Highly recommended, and can be cooked in a larger batch for big gatherings.   :-)

This recipe was indeed easy, but it taste like was missing something.  I don't know what though.  My children didn't really care for it so I'm not sure it will be in my regular rotation.

I had decided to leave out the bell pepper and tomatoes (dear husband hates them!).  For pizza sauce I used Prego spaghetti sauce.  To our taste it came out a little blander than we prefer.  Planning to saute in some fresh garlic with the meat; add a little more salt or herbs to the egg crust.  Otherwise, we thought it was quite inventive, but easy.  We'll definitely make again!

This was good. I did add mushrooms and pepperoni to it. One thing I didn't like were the tomatoes. That's just a personal thing. I also used the Easy Pizza Sauce II from this site. Please NOTE! The prep time on this dish is way way way off.

My wife rated this a 5, i gave it a 4.  I'm not sure what clock they were using when they said prep time of 15 minutes.  It takes me 15 minutes just to cook bacon and crumble it let alone brown beef, chop an onion, green pepper and tomatoes.  I added black olives and fresh mushrooms and a little more cheese.  We liked the crust.  It is a little like quiche.  Overall it was very good but, my prep time was more like 45 minutes and 30 minutes of cook time.

FANTASTIC!  My 3 & 6 year old loved this.  I added mushrooms and garlic to the meat mixture, 1/2 t italian seasoning and 1/2 t garlic to the breading and to the top I added pepparoni and black olives.  I also was able to easily connvert it for my ALLERGIC son by using 3 egg yolks in stead of 2 eggs and gluten free flour, olive oil and goat's cheese and milk.  We all loved this recipe both the regular way and the allergy free way!

This is SO GOOD! I used mushrooms and 3 serrano chili's instead of the bacon, and added some Hot taco seasoning to the meat. It turned out great. My boyfriend loved it and went back for seconds. I will be making this again soon!!

It was okay. I added salami and pepperoni to make it have more meat. The dough wasn’t good at all and there wasn’t enough sauce.

Good basic recipe, although I will change some things next time.  There was less than 1/4 pan left from my family of 4--2 year old, preteen, husband and myself.  I did a couple of changes--I made my own pizza sauce b/c I did not have any ready made--used 16 oz tomato sauce, 6 oz tomato paste, 1 tablespoon of minced garlic (in the refrig.jar), 1 tbsp oregano, 1 tsp of paprika, and about 1/2 tbsp of basil.  I used 1/2 cup each of bell pepper and onions (the kind you buy precut and frozen).  I wanted to use crescent roll for crust, but I did not have any, so I used the original recipe "crust".  I had some leftover mushrooms, so I added that.  I also used 1&1/2 cups shredded "fiesta" cheese.  Finally, added salt and pepper to taste--did not measure but it seemed like a lot.  Everything else I left the same.  It turned out good, but not quite something we would have again.  For starters, the crust is really more like a quiche than a pizza crust.  I still did not get much of a cheese flavor in it, and the bacon just did not seem to fit.  Next time, I will eliminate the bacon, use more cheese (at least a little bit mozarella if I have any), add some pepperoni, and I will try the crescent roll crust.  The overall flavor was great, so hopefully these changes will make it perfect.  Yes, I realize it is not quite the same recipe anymore--but isn't that the fun of it!?!

I thought this was delish!  I didn't have green peppers on hand or fresh tomatoes so I just used mushrooms instead.  I also used homemade pizza sauce from this site (Exquisite Pizza Sauce) and topped with J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits, also from this site...thanks for the tip Chef-daddy-o!!!

This was just "eh" for us. In my opinion, it's an awful lot of work for just a casserole. I'd go with the "Beef and Biscuit" recipe on this site if I'm going to make something like this again.

This was super - the family gobbled it up! I did subsitute mushrooms for the green peppers (family doesn't like those). Only problem cook time took twice as long for topping - otherwise tasted great!

This recipe was terrific. It was a hit with all my friends. I baked my bacon in the oven because for me it seems a little easier. I added sausage, garlic powder, salt, pepper and italian seasoning to meat mixture.  I also used Ragu spaghetti sauce, and drained diced tomatoes out of the can.  I also added pepporoni on top right before putting on the cheese.  I added mozzarella cheese to the cheedar cheese and made the dough that came with the recipe after an unfortunate mishap with some pizza dough. The outcome was wonderful.  The dough turned out great!!!!!

OK.  I read many of the reviews and modified this recipe.  I used spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce and added basil, garlic and 2T of parmesan cheese. I eliminated the pepper and tomato. I also used lower sodium bacon.  I topped it with crescent rolls instead of the dough recipe listed.  My kids loved it and the leftovers were great for lunch the next day.  I would use this as an appetizer too.

To each their own as they say.  This just wasn't the recipe for my family.  My son took a bite, then requested something else, I ate one piece, and got up from the table still feeling a little hungry, and my fiance did go back for seconds, but wasn't too impressed.  I almost considered trying this with bbq sauce intstead of the pizza sauce, but didn't.  I doubt I'll make this again.

This was easy to make but not all that flavorful. Personally I think it would be better to put all the bacon on top rather than mix it in. That might improve it. I'll keep it and maybe make it again sometime.

Absolutely delicious!  I added some spices and used bacon bits instead of bacon, but otherwise left this unchanged.  My kids are eating it now, and I'm on my way back for portion number 2!!

This was good. I did not use bacon, I did use olive oil, and I only had one tomato, so I added about 3/4 cup diced canned. I liked it - so did my husband. My 3 year old didn't hardly try it - she doesn't like "matoes" - sigh. It wasn't thin as some people mentioned - seemed just right for the size pan used.

So good!  I used spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce and olive oil instead of veg.  I also added an additional 4oz of Jack cheese.  I was very impressed with how easy and delicious it was.  Great for last min, ingredients on hand.

This is an excellent dish. I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! The crust mixture was good, and baked up light and quite fluffy. This is not a flaky type crust, so if you are looking for that, bisquick may be what you want instead! My two year old and husband ate this up. Will definitely make again!

A great idea, but works best if you add to it.  In addition to ideas in previous reviews, another alternative is substituting barbeque sauce for the pizza sauce.  Keep in mind that not all toppings will work with BBQ sauce (I only used beef, bacon and onions).  Also, one of the crust alternatives, such as the dough from pillsbury cresent rolls works better than the originally with the BBQ variation.  Also be sure to add salt, pepper, garlic or similar no matter what varient you use.

Please,Please take the advice of other reviewers and use a diffrent crust. I did not and wish I would have. The recipie itself would have been okay if we had a crust we liked. My advice use a diffrent crust and use whatever veggies your family likes and this will be a great easy recipie!

Very ordinary recipe, nothing special.  My family thought I had made hamburger helper!  Not worth the effort when you can get the same results from a box mix.

Yuck! I should've read the other reviews first and used actual pizza dough or bicuit for the crust. The crust mixture was gross. The filling was ok. I only had turkey bacon and it definitely is not an adequate substitute for the real thing.

I dont know if I did something wrong but this was not a very great recipe... but it is edible.  I used alot of the recommendations of adding more flavor and the filling was good, it was the mix of the topping and the filling that wasn't so great.

This is a great base. It is so forgiving. Based on previous recommendations I added garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and parmesan to crust add a little something. I didn't have green pepper on hand so substituted chopped dill pickles. I'd highly recommend it. This could be modified to make mushroom swiss burger theme or pepperoni to make more pizza theme. Thank you so much for submitting.

Hubby wasn't too sure about this one, but he ended up having several servings. Our two year old ate all of his also. I halved the recipe, and made sure to season the ground beef well (I used garlic powder, basil, and oregano). I also used a mix of sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheese and used a can of crescent rolls for the crust. It came together quickly, and since everybody ate it with no complaints, we'll have it regularly.

Was super simple to make and will be added to our busy night dinner options. It is a must to add season to not only the meat but the egg/ flour mixture. We add italian season to the e/f and galric and onion to the meat.

We disliked this recipe.  Not enough meat and too much "crust"  I do not plan to make this recipe again.

Lots of ways to spice this one up and personalize it.  I have made this recipe for years with several variations. I use a basic meaty spaghetti sauce recipe and top with a seasoned ricotta cheese mixture and mozzerella cheese for the basic.  Also a refrigerated crust works beautifully to give that yummy crisp pizza crust.

I made this recipe and my husband loves pizza but does not like alot of crust, this had to much crust for him so next time I'll cut the dough by 1/4. Thanks for the recipe.

I used a lot of cheese, basically to my own discretion.
I also added garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the ground beef & peppers & onion while they were cooking.

I added garlic and Italian Seasoning as another reviewer had suggested, and it's still just edible, nothing special at all. Not something I would make again.

My 7 yr old: "It was new. I liked it. My favorite thing about it was chewy and i liked the way the onions were made. 

I (mommy speaking) have been looking for different casserole reciepes to help stretch the food budget a bit. We get tired of chicken pot pie and cottage pie- and this was wonderfully different. I added a cup each of green and red bell peppers and an extra cup of cheese. I also added a can of sweet corn to the meat mixture to help it strech some more.  

It was really good! I was very doubtful about the runny "crust" that I poured over the top but it was chewy when it cooked and not crispy. The texture with the rest of the dish was awesome. We will totally make this again!

I've made this several times and really like it.  Of course you can spice it up any way you want it!  Fed it to a friend of mine over a year ago and he's asking for it all the time.  Every now and then I just crave this...thanks!

This was ok. I'm not sure if my kids liked or not...more on the not side I think, but I did get them to eat it and it didn't take too long. They didn't like the green peppers. I liked it and would prb make it again although I might tweak a bit.

I thought this was a great, quick recipe.  The kids loved it and so did I.  Thanks for sharing.  The only thing I added was a crushed clove of garlic in the pizza sauce, and I used four cheese pizza rather than cheddar.  Delicious.

My fiance and I both enjoyed the meat portion of this.  However, she did not care for the crust at all and had to heat up a roll and eat the meat like a sandwich.  I thought it was fine, though.  If we make again, we will probably come up with our own breading.

I'm so sorry, but this recipe was really not worth the beef and bacon.  I did not put bell pepper and used spag. sauce instead of pizza, but was just not too exciting.  My husband said it wasn't goupy enough, maybe wetter?

good, not super, needs more BAM.  thought i'd be able to stick up for the crust, but i do think it needs to be more substantial.  decent, quick, "clear the cupboards" meal.

Made this tonight and my husband and I thought it was wonderful.  It really does take a LOT longer than fifteen minutes to put together.  I'm glad I read the reviews as I did add salt and pepper to the ground beef when browning and added salt and pepper to the tomatoes after they were spread over the meat mixture.  When I make this again (and I will) I'm going to use cresent rolls as the topping even though the other topping was okay...the cresent rolls will save preparation time and clean up.  Thanks Krissy for this recipe-it's a keeper!

There is no way you can cook the bacon, brown the ground beef and chop all the vegies in 15 minutes....Plan for more prep time.  The end result is awesome. I made a few additions after reading some of the other reviews. I added 2 teaspoons Italian spice, 2 pkgs crushed red peppers (I had from a pizza delivery).  I didn’t measure them, but would guess about 2-3 teaspoons.
I also added some grated Parmesan cheese.  I didn’t measure that either, just covered the meat mixture before adding the tomatoes and cheddar cheese. I couldn't really taste the bacon and will use sausage and/or pepperoni next time. I will also add some mushrooms and black olives to the mixture.

This one was edible at best. Very bland. It needed something more. I added extra spice and bacon and it still wasn't too good. Sorry

My family loves this recipe.  I use ground turkey, add red pepper and 8 oz of mozzarella cheese.  Also, for a thicker topping, I like to increase those ingredients by 50%, we tried  doubling them and it was too thick.

Seasoned the ground beef as previously suggested, but still wasn't flavorful.  I also added a layer of pepperoni under the cheese.  I also used a low-carb bake mix instead of flour to lower the carb count.  My family liked it enough to try it again, although I will try a mixture of italian sausage and ground beef next time.

My children loved it and my husband ate half of the dish. I would suggest either doubling the recipe for the 9x13 inch dish or putting it in a smaller dish though. It seemed very thin and I think it could do with being more meatier. My crust did not rise much, not sure if it is supposed to be a thin crust or not. But my children loved it so that's all that matters. For their sake though, I think I will use imitation bacon to cut down on the fat and I also left out the onion and pepper since they don't eat that anyway.

Maybe the people who didn't like the crust for this recipe didn't prepare it correctly. The whole recipe was DELICIOUS! I did use spicy pasta sauce instead of pizza, however, and I used imitation bacon bits to cut fat and prep. My 7 year old ate 3 helpings!!!

My boyfriend absolutely LOVED this one but I just thought it was ok.  We used Bisquick for the topping and it tasted pretty good.  Definitely tasted better the next day!

This was pretty good.  I used the egg top & it was OK, but I can see why the Bisquick idea would be much better- definately use that instead!!  It's a keeper for an every once in a while dish.

Great overall recipe.  Tasted yummy, only good change for it would be to use quick "in a can" crescent rolls for the topping insted of the egg mixture.  That was delish!

This was a little bit time consuming, but turned out very good. I used mozzarella cheese and sprinkled with parmesan the make it a little more like pizza. I also added some jalapenos on top of the cheese before adding the flour mixture. It tasted great! I'm sure I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe Krissy.

I did a variation on this "theme".  I used sliced mushrooms instead of Tomatoes and no bacon.  
My wife loved it!
