My guests loved it. The only changes made were less salt and white pepper since I am allergic to black. I have tons of tarragon growing so I used part dried and chopped fresh on the top. I will be making this again.

Totally different and something I could handle since I am not a very good cook. My husband loved the potatoes, especially.
