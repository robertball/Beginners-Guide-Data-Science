I made a batch of these pickles and everyone I gave then to really like the pickles.  But you need to cut back on the sugar.  I made a double batch of brine and I only used 2 Tbs of sugar and I also used jarred jalapeno pepper in place of red pepper flakes.  I don't care for red pepper flakes.  I used about 7 or 8 jalapeno slices per jar, You can do anything you want for the heat.

believe it or not...my first attempt at making dill pickles and I'M SOOOO HOOKED!!!  we started 8 days ago and could just not wait another 2 days!  crisp...cold...deelicious dill pickles.  regionally (Hawaii) we mainly pickle cut up veggies and fruits like cabbage, onions, eggplant, mangoes, turnips and mustard cabbage so this was quite out of my norm.  these pickles taste just almost exactly like claussen from the refrigerator section (at $5 a jar in Hawaii).  i made these because i found a bag of small pickling cucumbers at a Korean market in town and i have never seen them at any other markets locally.  there were 8 in the bag and so i adjusted the recipe for those 8 cuties and followed the recipe with the exception of the following.  i used dried dill because i didn't have any fresh; my jar of pickling spice was so old the lid was stuck so i read the ingredients and improvised.  i broke up some bay leaves, threw in some peppercorns, put a dash of cinnamon, a dash of colman's mustard powder (in place of the mustard seed); i didn't have any dill seed and didn't add any pepper flakes at my daughter's request.  we packed those babies in a jar and the liquid just topped them...perfection!  i'm planning to start growing my own pickling cucumbers!  can't thank you enough FAIRYFAHRENHOLZ for sharing your wonderful recipe!!!  tell your husband these pickles are the "crack" pickles!  **-*-**mahalo from Hawaii**-*-**

This was a quick and easy way to use up those extra cukes in our fridge! I halved the sugar because I like more of a tart and garlicky pickle--wonderful!

To sum it all up, we have eaten two jars of these pickles in only six days!! Yum! I added sliced onions, extra red pepper, used more vinegar than the recipe callled for and used pickling salt instead of regular coarse salt. I also sliced the cucumbers instead of pickling them whole so we could use them on sandwiches too. They stayed SO crispy!!

Easy to make pickles, everybody loves them.  People cannot believe that they are homemade.  One friend said that the only place that she thought that thy could come from was a gourmet market. I have made these twice and the amount of brine needed to fill the jars was not enough.  I am not sure if it is because I make spears that might be the problem.  I basicly tripled the amout of brine.  Though I was filling twelve quart jars and one pint.  I would suggest making more brine so that when it comes time to jar you do not run out.

This recipe was SO simple- I easily tripled the brine so I wouldn't run out. Plus, I added red onion, red bell pepper and to a few: some little green and orange peppers, so the extra brine was necessary. 
I'm making these as Christmas gifts and they look absolutely festive and delicious! I may make these a Christmas tradition! They not only taste good, but they look like a decoration with the dill and garlic bits floating about. 
Very simple recipe for any experience level- but you will look like a pro when your friends and family see the results!

You have ruined store bought pickles for us.  These were easy and great.  I halved the sugar as suggested by other reviewers and I boiled the 2 cups of water so it disolved the sugar and salt and I didn't wait.  We used fresh hot red peppers from our garden instead of the flakes.  Just wonderful.  We couldn't wait for 10 days and ate them after 2 - it had the crunch of  half soursThanks for the recipe

This was my first attempt at making pickles and I was surprised at how easy it was. I have to admit, I snuck a pickle after only one day, and they definitely get better if you can wait it out a few days. I used 1 T of red pepper, and the flavor was perfectly spicy and garlicky. Yum! The only thing I'd change next time is skip chopping the dill because it got messy and I think you'd still get the same flavor with whole sprigs.

WONDERFUL!!  Crisp, spicy, with a sweet/sour balanced flavor.  Excellent recipe that I plan to use over and over.  I do recommend making a little more of the brine since I ran a little low at the end.

I was very skeptical when I saw this recipe, but I am so glad I tried it. I planted both slicing and pickling cucumbers this year hoping to make pickles, but when I started to price canning jars and canning materials I decided against it and then I ran across this recipe. It is AWESOME!! I did not use dill seed or fresh dill weed instead I used dried dill weed from the $1 spices at the grocery store and only used 1/2 cup. I also used coarse sea salt. I used both slicing and pickling cucumbers from the garden and cut them in big chucks, couldn't tell the difference between the 2 types. I also only used 1 Tablespoon sugar after reading the other reviews. I mixed it all up and put it in a big plastic ziploc container and waited a week. These were super zesty and crisp. My kids can't get enough. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was ok. I am a first time pickle maker so I was very disappointed in my result. It was not spicy and very sweet. If you don't want a sweet pickle I'd cut it down to only a few table spoons.

Yum!!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar, but to a tablespoon, and I increased the salt a little.  I make a couple batches of this brine and filled a gallon jar and some smallers jars.  I filled my jars with onions, garlic cloves, hot peppers, banana peppers, jalapeno peppers, green peppers slices, and hunks of three different varieties of cucumbers.  I picked tiny cucumbers and big ones, and they all turned out great.  They are just that good.   I did add celery seed to the mix as well, I just like the added flavor.  I bought some pickling spice for my next batch.  Mmm! Mmm! Good!

I love these!!!I didn't have fresh dill, used dry. Also, not necessary to presoak the cucumbers in the brine.  I just prepped my jars, added cucumber spears, threw in some whole peppercorns into each jar (about 1 tsp. per jar.) Added 1 tsp. chopped garlic to each jar, 1 tsp. red pepper flakes to each jar. Then pour vinegar,salt and sugar solution into each jar. The other reviewers are correct, cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup or they are too much like bread and butter pickles....I wanted mine to be more like claussen and they were!  Enjoy!

This is the best dill pickle recipe I have found, and I doubt I will try any others. I took a hint from another recipe though and soaked the cukes in cold water and ice cubes for approx 2 hours before slicing them into spears, then I soak them in the brine for 2 more hours, then pack into jars for the fridge. I'm using plain american slicing cucumbers, not pickling cucumbers and they are fantastic. They turn out so crunchy and flavorful. Thanks!

I think this recipe is a true winner!  It has so many of the characteristics of a *great recipe*.  It's easy, cheap, quick and, very importantly, it's so easy to adapt to your personal tastes.  Don't like sweet?  Not too fond of spicy pickles??  All VERY simple corrections to make!  You can cut the cuke's any way you like, or not at all!  I tried some of each, spears, halves and wholes, and are pleased to see good results with each.  The spears were actually yummy (and CRISP!) after only 36 hours.  The halves needed a bit more time and the wholes will need at least a week, I figure.  For those who want good pickles but don't have everything, don't worry!  Here in southern Thailand, many things are impossible to find.  Such as pickle spice, dill seeds, mustard seeds and several other things found in other recipes (even canning jars!!).  So I did without and it's oh-so-good.  Fortunately for us, fresh dill, small cucumbers and garlic are all easily acquired.  I also made my own pickling spice as per another user's suggestion.  2 bay leaves ripped up 2 t dry coriander seeds 1 - 2 t lightly pounded black pepper 1/2 t mustard powder dash of cinnamon dash of turmeric  I'm sure it could be a bit more complex but it tastes great to me!!

Really super easy. Like so easy *I* could make this. With my kids' help. I followed the recipe exact only omitting the sugar because we don't like sweet in our pickles at all. We're going to let these chill out in the fridge for a couple days, then try them. Once we do, we'll update our review. As it sits, they smell amazing and again, were really easy to make. EDITED--few hours later: Little too salty. I'd cut back on the dill weed for next time. We'll see if it mellows after sitting in the fridge for a few days. As is, good. Just really too salty.

Love these! My family can't get enough of these. I cut the sugar to 1 T. (we don't like sweet pickles), just added a pinch of red pepper flakes and I doubled the brine. Since they are eaten so fast after the 10 day waiting period, I just put fresh cucumbers back in the brine and they still taste as good as the first batch.

Yum! I was so excited to try this recipe, & I was not disappointed! I'm a huge pickle lover, & these tasted really similar to one of my favorite kinds of pickles. The only change I will make next time is to probably eliminate the sugar completely. I only put in between 1-2 tablespoons, & I still wasn't a fan of the sweet taste. I guess I just like my pickles sour :). Overall, though, really great recipe!

These are great pickles. THis was my first attempt at making pickles from my home grown cucumbers and they were truly awesome, and better yet EASY!! I reduced the sugar by a lot, next time I think I may only use 1 tbls, I used 2 this time. I also mixed cider vinegar and white only because I didn't have enough cider vinegar. I would have liked a little more dill, but I didn't have enough in my garden. Also, I threw in a couple chopped banana peppers ( because I had them) and a teaspoon of Alum for crispness.  Awesome Pickle!!

These are nice pickles.  I do like the flavor of the dill.  I used about 1/2 the sugar and am glad I did; I love pickles, any kind of pickles, but I'm less partial to sweet pickles.  I, to discovered that there really isn't enough liquid to cover the pickles as written, so I doubled the liquid but ran out of vinegar so had to use a little more water than called for.  It still wasn't quite enough, but sufficient to try these out.  I'm inclined to agree wtih a revieweer who suggested that the dill doesn't need chopped; I actually thought the small pieces got in the way when pulling pickles out of the jar, and would prefer bigger pieces so it is easier.  All in all, though, bf and I really enjoyed these and we will probably try again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, I had everything on hand to make these, including freshly picked pickling cucumbers! After reading the other reviews, the only change I made was cutting the sugar in half. It's only been 5 days, and like the other reviewers, I just couldn't wait to taste them. Incredibly awesome! Absolutely love them, but even with the sugar cut in half, I can still taste a slight sweetness. Next time, ( this weekend, bumper crop!) I will use slightly less than half of the sugar, seeking perfection! It's all just a matter of taste, but I really don't like any kind of sweet pickles, I love garlicky, vinegar pickles. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!

Really good and easy. Only used 1/4c of the sugar instead if the full 1/2c. Next time will reduce even more to just 2 tblspns.  Nice and garlicky, spicy, and dill-y. This is a great recipe that us easily adaptable. Nice and crispy yet totally infused with flavor even after just 5 days....we could not wait the full 10 days. Lol....like the fact that you can also control the sodium in these pickles .....I used sea salt and way less then called for. Thanks for my first experience in making pickles .....look forward to making more.

I just made these last night and I've already snatched 2 from a jar!  They're perfectly tart with just a bit of a burn.  Can't imagine how good they'll be in 10 days :o)  After reading the other reviews, I opted to reduce the sugar to 2 T, up the salt to 2 T, and leave the dill whole and just cram several sprigs in each jar.  For some reason I couldn't find dill seed at the store so had to leave it out, but hopefully the dill weed will impart enough flavor!  I had to use regular cucumbers (cut into spears), but I'm sure pickling cucumbers are even better.  Like some other reviewers, I had to make more of the brine to cover my cucumbers, but I think that has a lot to do with how densely you pack the cukes in the jar.  I'll update this once the required 10 days have actually passed!  I'm willing to bet there will only be a few pickles left by then though because they're so good already!

IF YOU WANT SPICY (SOUR) DILL PICKLES OMIT THE SUGAR ENTIRELY.  If you want sweet bread and butter pickles then follow to a T.  I wanted spicy & dilly pickles.  For my first batch I followed the recipes exactly as written.  Before putting into jars I tasted the liquid.  Yikes!!  I'm glad I did.  It was like a  dillish syrup.  So I rinsed off all my cukes and started over, this time omitting the sugar completely.  Two weeks later, I am eating a pickle.  Definitely the spicy (& sour)type of dill I was looking for!

I was skeptical on this one but so glad I tried it!  I tripled the basic recipe and added some sweet red peppers, white onion chunks, jalapeño slices instead of red pepper flakes, extra garlic, some peas in the pod from my garden. I only used a small amount of sugar as I wanted dill pickles. I started eating the second day. Testing every day. Hoping they stay crunchy for the whole month. I only had pint jars and they don't hold much, but I used small pickling cukes. This is so easy and fun! Fun to give to friends who will want to try it also.

I have made these about 5 times now and EVERYONE loves them, even my picky husband who I feel is a pickle snob.  The only thing I really changed is I add at LEAST a full tablespoon of red pepper flakes to give them a real kick.  I often use cucumebers from my garden and just slice them up.  The flavor is amazing and the process is so easy!

I don't care for the sugar in these, but other than that, they were awesome!  Love the texture, and the spice.  We'll definitely be making more next summer!

Great pickels! I used pickling salt, and like others, reduced the sugar. I canned these and they are really good.

Very easy & very good.  I had large cuces from the garden so I sliced them, using about 8 large ones.  Dropped sugar down to 1 Tablespoon, used 4 teaspoons of canned minced garlic, and added a chopped fresh chile pepper to the brine.  Put it all together & after 10 days they were great!

Too sweet (even though I only put in 1/2 the sugar from the recipe) and too much vinegar. Not enough salt for my palette. Good base though - just needed less vinegar and more salt.

I had no idea how easy it was to make great pickles!  After the first batch, I cut the sugar in half but otherwise followed it to a T.  I think we're on our third batch now.  Great in tuna salad or with sandwiches!

Just tried these pickles & they are great!!! My husband & friends love them too. I didn't have any pickling spice so I just omitted it and they turned out great. Can't get over how crispy they are, they are addictive!

Wow!!!  These are really really good and I just made them.  Had to try them after they soaked for a few hours and they are GOOD!!!!  Can't wait for the full 10 days to see how they taste.  I took some of the reviewer suggestions and cut the sugar way back, added sliced jalapenos and alot of garlic.  I wasn't sure if you were supposed to leave the cucumbers whole or what to do so I made some cut into chips, spears and left a few whole.  Will see which I like the best but I have a feeling it won't matter, they taste awesome!!!!

These were really very good.  It made enough brine to fill 2 quart jars.  I cut the cucumbers into spears rather than leaving whole, stuffed them into 2 jars then poured the brine over the top.  Filled them up to the top.  I let them sit a week in the refrigerator before we sampled.  So nice and garlicky!

LOVE this! So simple and easy I almost can't believe it. I had to make a few small changes to what I knew I would prefer though. I didn't have very much red pepper flake in the cabinet but I did have some dried red chilies so I used a total of 10 small chilies and all of the pepper flake that I had which was about a tsp. I didn't chop my garlic I just smashed it and threw it in and also halved the amount of sugar. These are so good they remind me of my favorite deli pickles!
Update: I've also used this same recipe to pickle sweet peppers from our garden and good grief are they fantastic!

I absolutely love pickles and am very particular about them...they must have FLAVOR like you just got it out of the full sour pickle barrel at the deli, not like some of those storebought that taste like cold cucumbers that ran past the pickle brine.  I also never made pickles before, bought the cucumbers and then had to rush out of town for a funeral.  I knew the cukes would be rotten by the time I got back so I mixed the brine and put the pickles in exactly as directed while I packed. LEt them sit as instructed and popped them in old mayonaise jars and popped them in the frig.  I cut the cucumbers in quarters lengthwise and followed instructions EXACTLY...except I had no fresh dill so I used dried. (I looked in a substitution book which said to use 1 tsp dry in place of 1 Tbsp fresh, which is 1/3 the amount..so I used 1/2 cup in place of 1.5 cup) My dill was a bit old, so I dumped in more than it said...maybe 3/4 cup.  I am making it again today, as all my friends want to try some and I wanted to test it on myself before poisoning anyone else! I am going to try fresh dill.  Also, I cut sugar all the time when I bake, but was afraid to in this recipe as I didn't know what the chemical interaction was with the ingredients.  They were NOT AT ALL sweet...and I can eat a lemon or lime raw. When I get these down I will try canning with a water bath, but this is so simple I wish I had tried it decades ago.

I just finished mixing everything together for three batches of these pickle's, because the last time I made them there wasn't enough for everybody! I have actually been begged to make these. I use regular cuke's sliced into rounds. I also triple the brine to make sure I have enough. The one thing I didn't like was the all that chopped dill in the jar when you're eating them. I bought a tube of dill paste, which dissolves into the liquid, and added sprigs of fresh dill. Added far less sugar, and 3 Tsp. of hot pepper flakes. We all like them spicy!! The worst part is having to wait 10 day's to eat them, but it's definitely worth the wait!! :=)

Absolutely amazing.  I will never ever ever eat store bought pickles again.  I halved the amount of cucumbers and doubled the brine since it's just me and my husband.  I also cut the sugar and added sliced white onions and fresh jalapenos.
They turned out perfect!  I'm already on my third batch.

A friend at work bought me in some spicy pickles he got at Whole Foods.  I was wanting to duplicate them and found this recipe.  I had to use one big pickle jar I had hanging around instead of the three small ones so I had to double the brine to fill it up.  I just love the way these came out!  They don't taste like the Whole Foods pickles, but they are great on their own.  Next time I'm going to reduce the vinegar and increase the sweetner (I used Splenda instead of sugar) and the red pepper flakes which I think will be closer to the pickles my friend brought in.  I want to surprise him with some less expensive homemade pickles, but truly I am very pleased with these.  Thank you so much for the post!

turned out very good. Next time, don't add the peppers. It isn't too spicy, but the pickier people might not appreciate them. I doubled the brine and it was barely enough.

I have made refrigerator pickles for years (only sweet pickles) but I wanted dills as well. I made this recipe and followed it to a T - and although the flavor was right on - the pickles were mushy and falling apart. No crispy or crunchy here.

Wonderful...After reading the reviews I only put in 1 Tablepsoon of Sugar and I didn't chop the dill weed up. I also didn't use dill seed. AND I sliced my cucumbers up so they'd be chips instead of spears.

These pickles are amazing.  Just following the recipe will give you awesome results, but is very easy to tweak to fit your tastes whether you like them sweet, a lot of garlic, spicy, etc.  Will definitely make this over and over :)

These were delicious! I was lucky enough to find pickling spices at the market one day, so I went right home and made them.  15 jars later, we are in pickle heaven! I followed the recipe pretty much until I got to the red pepper. I only used a couple of pinches of it, since I didn't want my pickles too spicy.

FANTASTIC!!  Very quick and easy and SO GOOD! But as others stated, I put a little less sugar and next time I WILL NOT CHOP the dill. It is very messy chopped--I suggest using it whole.   Also, no need to wait 10 days.  I made them at night and we began eating them the next day.  Today is day 2 and they are almost gone.  They were nice and crisp and had plenty of flavor!   I'm getting ready to pull more cukes out of the garden to make some more!!

I liked this recipe a lot, however it should say SWEET spicy pickles, if you add as much sugar as the recipe states. I only added about a Tablespoon and they weren't sweet and more the flavor I wanted.

I too reduced the amount of sugar way down to about a tablespoon since I didn't want sweet pickles.  Cut my cukes in quarter spears.  Could have used a tad more salt (probably to make up for the missing sugar?).  Didn't bother to chop dill, just cut it off plant, washed, and tossed in whole.  One other thing was I had soaked my whole pickling cukes in ice water for about three hours and then sliced before putting in jars.  Yum!

Great pickles!  Extra crunchy!  I cut the sugar in half and doubled the salt (course pickling salt).  Everyone loved these!

Man these are good! I put in extra hot pepper and garic and some thinly sliced onion! The cucumbers have stayed crispy too! I would reduce the sugar and add more salt next time. Great flavor! thanks!!!

The best and easiest recipe for pickles I have come across.  I had an abundance of cucumbers in my garden this year and decided that making pickles was for me.  I had never made pickles before, dill or sweet.  Too much trouble and too cheap in the stores.  I am so glad I made this recipe.  I did wait my 10 days like suggested and yesterday was the day.  I love them and so did my husband.  They are not hard to do, the expense of buying the spices the first time is the biggest hit on your pocket book and was well worth it.  I can't wait for others to try them, that is how proud I am.  My daughter in law will be here to get her jar on her way home from work today.  Cut back on the sugar like other reviewers said would be a good idea.  They are just a little bit sweet, I like em anyway, sugar or not.  I made a double batch, boy am I glad I did.  I will make another batch when I get down to one jar.

These are scrumptious! I did alter the recipe to suit my taste by omitting the sugar and adding extra garlic and red pepper flakes. I also put extra dill sprigs in the jars before refrigerating. I doubt I'll buy pickles in the future because I liked being able to choose organic ingredients.

Awesome! Super easy and extra delish! We had fresh hot peppers and used those instead of pepper flakes! We've made them a few times, the second time we made them we cut the sugar, they weren't as good! We're sticking to the original recipe!

OMG!!! Absolutely perfect... I soaked my cuc's in an ice bath in the fridge for 24 hours, lightened up on the sugar, added fresh garden jalapenos and of course more garlic and fresh dill.. Could only wait 5 of the 7 days or should I say my family could only wait.. And they were absolutely delicious.. Can't believe I finally found a crunchy yummy recipe that my family likes, thank you so much....

These pickles were SO easy to put together and are absolutely delicious. I have tried at least 4 other recipes in search of the perfect dill pickle, when I made these I omitted the sugar completely and they turned out exactly as I was wanting them too. This is definitely a go-to recipe from now on!

I made a couple tweaks (added onion chunks and sliced jalapeno peppers, and some fresh parsley & thyme) but these are really, really good!!!  I only made these because I was gifted with 6 cukes from a neighbor's garden, and we don't really eat them.  Now I'm considering growing cukes next year just to make more of these!

I changed these up a little bit.  I omitted the red pepper flakes, since my kids don't like spicy food.  I cut the pickles into slices for sandwiches.  And instead of chopping up the dill, I added about 4 sprigs of dill to each jar.  This recipe made me 6 jars of delicious crunchy pickles!

These are AMAZING. I was eating them on day one.. my son and I have almost gone through an entire jar. I also increased the pickling juice just so I would have enough and since I had room in the bowl, I pickled onions and celery too. Soooo good!!

Very good pickle recipe.  Was hesitant to try a dill pickle with sugar in the brine, but was very happy at the outcome. Pickles were crisp, flavourful, and delicious.  Will be making this one again when the cucumbers are ready in the garden.

Oh my gosh, these are so good after just one day!  They are nice and crisp and so flavorful. I used a lot of fresh dill from my garden and didn't chop it.  I didn't reduce the sugar because I read all of the reviews after I made the pickles, but I still like them A LOT.  Also, they were very easy to make. Will definitely be making more of these.

Two words- VODKA AND ICE!  Cut back a hair on the vinegar and water to accommodate for these two awesome ingredients.  The ice ensures extra crispy pickles and the vodka, well, need I say more?

I never tried making pickles.  I will never BUY them again!  We always bought the Zesty Dills and loved them.  Now I'd say that they'd "do" in a pinch.  FYI, the 2/3 oz. package of fresh dillweed only makes 1 c. so that is what I used.  It was plenty.  I cut the sugar to 1 T. because I wanted them to be ZESTY, ZESTY, ZESTY and boy did they deliver.  Nice and garlicky, too.  So easy and so tasty.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

This recipe is SO good and SO easy to make.  I cut the sugar in half as others suggested but otherwise made it exactly as written.  I am not a fan of sour foods so I found it too tart but my husband who loves sour thought they were perfect. Definitely a keeper!

Not a big fan of this recipe, I'll try others. Firstly, as others suggested I cut the sugar to about 1 oz per batch (I don't like sweet pickles either). I also didn't add as much dill, I felt it would be too much. A handful of days later I tasted one and I found it to have too strong of a vinegar taste. I added more water to the jars hoping to cut the vinegar taste. We'll see what happens.

This recipe was great.  Loved it. Cann as recommended & you will not be disappointed.  I am finishing my jar off right now.  I made these and a batch of canned ones that I can use in the future as well.  I know this sounds bad but I love drinking the pickle juice.  I don't know if you have ever tried it, but it works with me as an appitite suppressant.  Maybe the next 'diet' recommendation?

WOW!  I have NEVER done pickles before and this was easy and wonderful!  I like dill pickles and wanted to do it without the canning processes.  I had too many cucumbers from my garden and a neighbors (both pickling and burpless) and I just mixed them all up (can't tell the difference) with some jars of spears and some of sliced.  I doubled the brine per other reviews and omitted garlic and red pepper, halved the sugar and added celery seed and a few shakes of alum to the brine.  I couldn't find fresh dill so just used jarred dill weed.  After 3 days, I dug into one of the jars of the sliced and ended up eating the whole thing in 2 days.  I will make these again and again and give them as gifts all summer long.  I also liked that this fits our healthy lifestyle perfectly!  Thanks!

Very good and easy!  Crunchy and flavorful.  Next time I will omit the sugar though.  I cut the sugar in half and they we still a bit too sweet for me.  Plus, be careful with the red pepper flakes- alittle goes a long way!

I tried 3 recipes , and this was the best by far. Not to spicy, just a slight kick at the end. Will make these every time from now on.

Good taste, but they didn't stay crispy after the full 10 days - I actually liked them better when I sampled one on day 5.  I would also tie up the spices in a cheesecloth or coffee filter next time to keep them from floating around.

My first attempt at pickles!  They were good, but next time I make them I'll adjust a little to fit my preferences.  I'll cut way back on the sugar and add more heat. Thanks for sharing!  Very crispy and tasty!

Very easy.  Wonderful and slightly spicy at 1 week.  They have quite a bit more kick at 2.  Very easy and a fun addition to any picnic or party.

This recipe was far too sweet for my preference.  Some of that may have been my own fault, because I used a little over a quarter cup of Splenda instead of a half cup of sugar to cut down on the calories.  Although Splenda is as good as sugar in most recipes (and you use half as much), it may have been the reason these turned out so super sweet - I don't know.  Regardless, next time I'll be trying them without the sugar added at all.

Can I rate zero stars.  They might taste great -- I don't know because when I opened each jar, the pickles had completed dissolved -- just mush was left.

This are easy great tasting pickles. The first time I made them I had one after only 2 days mmm... so good. My husband who can care less about pickles had 3 of them.I did omit the sugar (did not have any on hand) and the were still great. Will have to make some more when my cukes are ready from the garden.

Oh. My. Gosh.  I am a self proclaimed pickle addict (I eat 1 or 2 a day) and these were some of the best that I have ever tried.  I only gave four stars because I wasn't a fan of the sweetness.  Next time I think I will reduce the sugar drastically or leave it out all together.  Yummmmm!

Very good, but the sugar definitely needs to be reduced if you're looking for a classic dill taste.

Super easy and very tasty! I don't even use the sugar anymore, though. Halving it still seemed too sweet. I think the cucumbers I get locally tend to be a little sweet anyway.

I had planned to follow the recipe exactly, but after making the brine mixture I was overwhelmed by how sweet it tasted, so I doubled the brine recipe (without doubling the sugar) to try to compensate. It was still too sweet in my opinion, Not a bad taste, just not a traditional dill pickle flavor. If you like zesty dills, I would just add sugar to taste, I imagine even a quarter of the sugar listed might be too much. I cut my cucumbers into spears to speed up the pickling process and put everything into a large tupperware container as it was too much for my jars. Overall, I good recipe, just more sweet than spicy.

These turned out crispy and very tasty.  I added extra garlic and lots of dill.  Because I used a small amount of red pepper flakes they were a bit spicy too.  At first bite they have a sweetness and finish with a little kick.  My guests loved them!

We love these.   I may have gotten a little off on measurements but put the same stuff in there and same method.  However much cayenne flakes I added in made them super spicy but delicious!  These pickles get nice n pickled after the ten days and have a great crunch.

I made these with the listed amount of sugar and I made them with less sugar. I preferred them with less sugar. I added more spice and some jalapeno slices. This is a great recipe with a few of my own tweaks.

This is the best dill pickle I have ever tasted. I am in the catering business and I frequently serve these at my meals. Everybody that likes dill pickles and some spice loves them. I do double the red pepper flakes.

I used both cucumbers and green beans. This is a good super easy starter recipe. I used half the sugar and it was still much too sweet for my taste.  I also don't like all the dill bits that I have to dig through to get to the pickles or beans. That being said, they were ready to eat 2 days ago and now almost gone. My youngest child thought the batch without pepper flakes was still too spicy but I liked it.  Next time I'll try keeping the fresh dill weed whole and using even less sugar. Our garden is bursting with beans so I'm going to modify the recipe and try again.

Yum! Used less sugar because I don't like sweet pickles... And didn't use the pickling spice.  First batch was gone in four days.  Everyone loved them! Batch number two is resting...didn't use any sugar in this one, and used half white vinegar and half cider vinegar...time will tell.

Seriously amazing! I made two jars of these pickles earlier this week. I cut back on the sugar a bit, and also added some whole garlic cloves to the jar. After 3 days the flavor was fantastic and I ate half a jar. :) I refilled the jar with new cucumbers and i'm waiting to see how they turn out.

I took some of the reviewers advice and cut the sugar back to 1 Tablespoon per batch of brine.  Big mistake.  The pickles are so sour and vinegary that we cannot eat them.  I am opening the lids now and dumping sugar into each jar in the hope that I can save them.  As they are now I have to throw them out.  My advice is to follow the recipe as written.

I love this recipe and so do my family and friends.  It says to eat the pickles in a month but I've found they stay good for months.  I always add more garlic and peppers but I like really spicy pickles.

I made a batch of these, but since we don't like sweet pickles, I just left out the sugar entirely. I also used fresh jalapeno peppers sliced up in place of the red pepper flakes (a friend gave me a bunch from her garden and I didn't know what to do with them).  My husband LOVED them! I thought they were pretty good,  but the pickling spice was even a bit too sweet for my taste. I prefer more of a tangy,  garlicky pickle and the pickling spice has too much of a cinnamon flavor. I'm masking another batch with more garlic and no pickling spice.  We'll see how that goes!

Pretty easy to make and tasty.  I would add slightly more garlic and a little more water to the mix.  They were a little heavy on the vinegar for my taste.  They lasted a long time as well and were better after the first time that we had them.  Not bad for my first time making pickles!

I halved the sugar, as I didn't want sweet pickles.  The flavor was okay, but I really didn't like the amount of chopped fresh dill.  I almost felt like I had to rinse the pickles off before eating them or else I'd end up with too much soggy dill.  If I make this again,  I'll double the dill seed and just use the sprig per jar of fresh.  All in all these were good, but just not quite the pickle I was looking for.

This was my first time making pickles. I only used 1/4 cup sugar and added some sliced onion to my pickles..I think I will only put an 1/8 cup of sugar it. Everyone enjoyed them and my Mother-in-law wants more. I don't put the extra dill in because it already had enough in it probably because I don't chop it up too much. It's a Keeper.

Doesn't anyone think this recipe calls for an unusual lot of fresh dill? I just chopped up a large pkg of dill, and I got 1/4 cup after taking a few springs out for the jars. At this rate I need 5-6 pkgs to yield 1 1/2 cups, and they are $3 each. After buying the cukes, I figure my homemade pickles will be ~$2 each--each pickle, not each jar! Even if I sub dry for fresh, that would be 3/4 cup dried--several bottles. I looked at other recipes for dill pickles, and they don't call for anywhere near this much dill. I'm going to try this recipe but with far less dill. I'm rating 4 stars because I can't send this without giving it a rating.

Must LOVE vinegar ... I LOVE dill pickles but I do not love an extreme vinegar taste.  These have a very strong vinegar taste.  My friend LOVES vinegar and she likes this recipe.  Guess my point is if your a big vinegar fan I would recommend this recipe but if not I would skip it.

This makes an incredible pickle.  The only thing I changed was only adding 1/4 c sugar.  My son can't stop eating them and is begging me to make more.  He says they start out a little sweet and then the dill/garlic taste kicks in... delicious!!!

OMG! These are better than GREAT! And soooo easy. My hubby doesn't like spicy so I left out the pepper (I'll make another batch for me that has the pepper in it). I added more garlic (as I l like my pickles heavier on the garlic). Could hardly wait the 10 days but its worth it.  I'm making my plans now for the taligate market to buy ALL the cukes I can find just to make MORE PICKLES!!!

I have NEVER been a pickle fan, but these have changed my mind!  This was my first attempt at pickles (needed a way to use some cukes that I got) Easy to tweak the ingredients to your personal preferences.  I can't stop eating these things!

We like the other recipe but we went hog wild crazy for this one.  The kick of the spicy was a pleasant surprise for us. We use them on lunch meat or burgers for that custom taste.  Folks are always saying, "What is that great extra flaver?"

I've made these several times.  Conclusion - don't skimp on the ingredients.  I've made them with less sugar, finding the original quite sweet.  But after tasting them I discovered I liked the original taste better.  I've also skimped on the herbs too much and that also caused the flavor to be too diluted.  I'm not sure if I ever had exactly the amount of fresh dill, but do put in a good amount.  I loved this recipe - these pickles are so delicious and beautiful to look at.  Perfect summertime gifts.  Thank you for posting it!!

This recipe was sweet and did not have a strong dill flavor.  It retained a good bit of cucumber flavor.  We didn't even finish these pickles.

I love this recipe.  I've made this at least 4 or 5 times this summer.  As others have said I cut the sugar way back to 1 or 2 Tablespoons.  I gave this recipe to my mom and forgot to tell her to cut the sugar back and they came out to sweet.

Wow. I am a HUGE pickle fan. I refuse to eat the ones in the jars at the grocery store because once you've had homemade pickles it's just not the same. These are amazing and SO easy to make. I thought i had to wait once a year for my grandma to make these. now i can make them all the time!

This recipe is fantastic! I only had 6 cucumbers so I used 1lb of hot Italian peppers in addition. I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and omitted the dill seed and red pepper flakes. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I’ve made these twice, with home made pickling spice, and everyone is bonkers over them!  I added one jalapeño, cored and seeded, sliced carrots and a slice of white onion.  Oh and I only did 2 tbsp of sugar too since we like the dill not so much the sweet.  Thank you!!

These turned out great, and I've made them several times now.
I usually increase the amounts to make larger batches. (We have a large garden)
I give away what we can't use at home and everyone asks for more.

Very good recipe. Cut sugar in half if you don’t want it too sweet. Double red pepper if you want spicer but no more then that. Definitely add bell pepper and onion. I couldn’t wait, I got to day 7 and it is so very good!

Great recipe! I used half the amount of sugar, and pickling salt rather than standard course grained salt. My pickling spice blend already contains dill seen so I chose to not add any additional. I also like to include a few sweet  onion slices alongside the pickles.

This was my first try ever of making dill pickles and I am so excited that I can now do this. I had a bumper crop of cucumbers this summer and outside of salads I didn’t know what to do with them. I think this is an awesome recipe, the sourness of the vinegar and dill, the slight heat of the pepper flakes, but a couple changes will be made by me for the  next crop of pickles. First, it’s too much sugar as is. We could really taste the sweetness. Granted, it didn’t over ride the dillness but it was still very evident. Next time I make them I will cut the sugar in half and see how that goes. I noticed several reviews said the same thing about the amount of sugar. Per my family request I will add more garlic. I also think 10 days  is too long. I will go for 8 Days  the next time. I felt the pickles were just a tad too wilty. Overall, this is a great recipe to start with.

My pickles were spicy which I liked. I used less sugar but it was still too much sugar for me. Next time I my omit the sugar completely.

I've used this recipe several times. it is a good one. But I also cut back on the sugar. Make sure you use Kirby cukes. they are firmer and hold up well. Use wide mouth Bell jars. Quick and easy.

I have made this recipe 4 times and each time, my family raved about the crispness and freshness of  unheated pickles.  All of the flavor... spiciness, dillness, loveliness!!  Each time, I’ve made 3 quart size jars and each time they have been devoured!  This last time, I cut the Persian cukes into slices, rather than spears... just to try something different.  I add a bit more red pepper and garlic, as well as fresh and dried dill.  I have added whole jalapeños  in the past.  Also use only 2 TBS of Xylitol, no other sugar.  You can do no wrong!!  This is an amazing way to use cucumbers, squash, beets, asparagus and whatever veggie you’d like to pickle!  Thanks for sharing!

First time pickler.  Because we had so much produce from the garden and the kids were excited to make pickles with some of it!  We ended up making 5 jars had to make more of the brine so like some have said just make double the batch. We used less sugar as suggested. No rhyme or reason to it we just added dill dill and more dill till we felt happy with it and used kosher salt. The only things we ended up adding was each jar had a little something different. One had sliced red onion another had lots of garlic another had habanero peppers and one had bell peppers and we just went to the local grocery in the canning section and there were several choices for pickle spices so we just got a basic one. It had the pepper corns and cloves and stuff already in it no preservatives just dried spices and goodies for pickles. 

lET ME TELL YOU THESE ARE GOOD AND EASY TO MAKE
 we waited the 10 Days then could barely stop eating them.  They are crunchy, good, addicting and we will most definitely make again

I have made these several times and have enjoyed them often. They add a little spice on a plate with a sandwich or small entrée dinner. I also have adjusted the spicy peppers I add by either using a jalapeno pepper sliced on a mandolin on a diagonal and adding a few slices to each jar along with a few thin slices of onion.  I also slice my pickle cucumbers on the thicker side so I can get more in the jar and more on side my plate.  Excellent recipe

3.18.18  I like the spiciness of these pickles, actually, I like the flavor of these pickles, however, I just don’t like the texture.  Simply put, they are mushy, not crisp like a dill pickle should be, and that’s just too much of a compromise for me.  My husband said he’s not eating more of them, so it looks like the remainder of the jar will be mine.  Some good things and not so good things about this recipe, but I won’t be making again.

I made this recipe about 3 years ago. I bought pickling cucumbers from a farmer's market and followed the recipe exactly. I cut them into spears and my pickles ended soggy and grey. They tasted great, but the soggy texture was unappealing to eat. 
BUT I was not going to give up!!! I did some research and it paid off. I was given a big box of European cucumbers and wanted to try again. I read online to keep cucumbers crisp follow a few rules. 1. Put cucumbers in ice cold water for at least an hour before pickling. 2. Add black tea to the jars. 3. Cut off the cucumber ends that the flowers fell from. 
I quadrupled the recipe and filled 2 one gallon pickle jars. I put 2 tea bags in each jar. I cut cucumbers into slices, not spears. I couldn't wait the two weeks and in one week, I was completely blown away and proud of the perfect pickles. Good thing I made 2 gallons!

Great recipe. Easy and the pickles are crunchy.   The first batch I made just as recipe reads.  They were a little sweet for dills, so the next batch I only used 2 Tsp. sugar, no cracked pepper and these came out just perfect.  They taste like my favorite store brought brand -Claussen.    So far, everyone else that has tried them loves them too.  I  just recently began making pickles: sweet relish, bread & butter and these.  These are the easiest.

Agree with less sugar and I used apple cider vinegar - all my ingredients came fresh out of my non-GMO heirloom organic garden (a little bit more dill). I also used fresh sliced serrano peppers to give a nice zesty zing (serrano are a wee bit spicier than jalapeno). No one will let the pickles sit for 10 days in the jar. I make pickled okra using the same recipe - tasty.

I gave this a 5 star rating - but only after I made a bunch of changes - LOL! The first time I made these they turned out WAY too sweet with hardly any tang or dill flavour.  
Now I use 2c vinegar and 1 3/4 water, and 1 tsp sugar (NOT 1/2 cup). I do use the 1 1/2 chopped dill - but only for the soak (3hrs, not 2). I find that leaving the chopped dill in the jars makes the pickles "furry" when you go to eat them - not very pleasant in my opinion - so I skim about 3/4 of the dill off the top before I pour in the brine. 
I use all the rest of the spices on the list - adding 1/2 tsp more dill seed and 1/4 tsp more crushed pepper but here is where I like to dress it up. 
For each jar I take four cloves of garlic and slice them thinly, four sprigs of dill, and two of the dried Chile de Arbol peppers (long skinny red peppers) and arrange them between the cucumbers before I pour in the brine. The dried chiles don't make it that much spicier unless you pierce them, just in case you are worried about that. (Each jar fits four of the pickling cucumbers halved and this is just enough brine to fit the four jars.) 
These tweaks certainly make for a nice presentation and they do help kick up the flavour! They are a favourite summertime treat and make a great gift for the neighbours!

They were very good except I thought just a wee bit on the sweet side. I gave some to several people and they all loved them. I will make them again, maybe this time I will cut back a little bit on the sugar.  They do have just the right amount of heat.

Super easy, and kinda fun to make. I also made a double batch of the brine as recommended by other reviewers. Also added some red pepper flakes to one jar since I like spicy and my family doesn't.  I'm very impressed with how simple it was to make my own pickles!  Will make this again and again!

My daughter and I made these from our neighbors crop of cukes. This was the first time either of us had made pickles of any kind. They are delicious and easy.

I've made a recipe close to this.  But that recipe called for heating so the sugar would dissolve.  I may try this one instead.  I save my glass jars that have plastic lids to use for these.  we love them.  Marilyn

The reviews are all true, these are awesome!  And oh so easy.  I didn't have pickling spice so subbed 1 bay leaf, peppercorns, and mustard powder.  I also cut the sugar in half and had to use dried dill because our local market had run out of fresh.  Still wonderful.  I brought them to a bbq and they were gone instantly...though I will say they were a bit too spicy for the younger kids in the crowd.

I made two batches with Pickling Spice, but did not have enough to do all 6 batches so I omitted it from the others. Still super yummy. To can them, sanitize jars by submerging in boiling water for 10 minutes, fill jars,  boil filled jars in water for 10 minutes. Your done! Yum!

I really liked these pickles. They were so easy to make and tasted great! I followed the recipe aside from the canning seasoning. I didn't want to buy any so I used stuff I had on hand, which were some crushed bay leaves, Mustard powder, Cinnamon and a bunch of Peppercorns. I used a little more red pepper flakes than the recipe asked for, and next time I'll add more. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough heat in the pickles. Next time I will probably slice some jalepeno as well as double the pepper flakes. I loved being able to just mix everything, put it in the jars and throw it in the fridge.

Awesome pickle recipe, and way easy to make. I cut back on the sugar by half after reading others comments, used about a teaspoon of celery seed, and used Hawaiian black salt (those last two solely because of what I had one hand). These came out fantastic! I love spicy foods, and this had just a touch of it. Soooo good. Following this recipe (nearly) to a tee produced just two pint jars for me.

I'd been searching for a great dill pickle recipe for a while and this is definitely one I'll be making again.  Very addictive.
  
I did make a few modifications:
- I used a few slices of fresh jalapeno in each quart jar instead of red pepper flakes, and halved the sugar.  This gave it a great balance of sweet and spicy.
- I mixed the water, vinegar, salt and sugar in a saucepan over heat to dissolve everything (heat just long enough to dissolve, don't boil), added the rest of the ingredients directly to each quart jar, then poured the liquid over everything.
- My grocery store was out of fresh dill, so I used a tsp. dried dill in each quart jar instead.  I'm sure it's better with fresh, but it still tasted good this way.
- After filling the jars, I sealed them up and sterilized them for pantry storage, and they still ended up nice and crunchy.

Although, I didn't care for these as written, I've given the recipe 5 stars, because this is an excellent SWEET PICKLE RECIPE. I just don't like sweet pickles. Not having made pickles before, I wasn't sure if the sugar was necessary. I reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon knowing I wouldn't like them otherwise. They were still too sweet for me, but Hubby loved them. I didn't have fresh dill, so I used dried, but it was a real pain to have hundreds of tiny dill pieces sticking to the pickles as I pulled them from the jar. Fresh dill is on the list for next time. I won't chop it. There will be a next time without any sugar. Thank you, FAIRYFAHRENHOLZ, for a great recipe to get me started.

I couldn't even wait a day to try these pickles. For my taste, dill pickles are too sour and bread and butter pickles are too sweet. These pickles are the perfect combination of both. I used the full amount of sugar called for and as much dill as I had which was about two tablespoons fresh chopped and two tablespoons dried. I also added about a tablespoon of dried habanero and cayenne flakes for a little kick. I had small pickling cucumbers so I cut them in half and divided them among two quart size jars and put four crushed garlic cloves in each. I then filled both jars with the pickling brine. Even after one day in the fridge they were outstanding! I'm through with store bought pickles. These pickles are easy to make and easy to adjust to your own taste.

These pickles taste okay -- a whole lot better than the other recipe I tried.  Spiciness was just right.  My kids will eat them and say they are good, but they aren't sneaking them as usual, and the hubs actually bought store bought pickles the other day. Can't say I'd do these again, but they were okay.

This will be my new refrigerator dill pickle recipe!  I did follow other reviewers' advice and cut the sugar in half.  I doubled the amount of red pepper flakes, since my family prefers the heat.  I did not add additional sprigs of dill to the jars, and we all found the chopped dill to be more than enough for a full dill flavor.  Wonderful pickles!  Thanks for the great recipe! I wish I had made a double batch!

My son declared these the best pickle he has ever tasted!  I reduced the sugar as I wanted a sour pickle.  I could eat the entire jar myself, by then I would indeed have terrible garlic breath!  I added a bit of zucchini as I had extra, and they stayed crunchy and delicious too.  This is an easy recipe with impressive results.  Thanks so much!

This was my first time attempting to ever make pickles. Very easy and delicious! I made mine into chips, added sliced onion and made a double batch. 1/2 with the peppers, the other half without for the kids. I couldn't wait the full ten days, so one pint jar is already gone. With be making this again.

I LOVE pickles.  These are really good with just a few adjustments.  My family likes spicey, so I add jalapenos to the jars.  These are also a little too sweet for me, so I reduce the sugar by over half.

I make jars and jars of these when my garden is producing lots of cukes. Everyone likes them and when a jar is opened, they disappear fast. i do use 1/2 the sugar. I have made them in spears and in large slices. We only have two jars left in the fridge now in November. They will be gone soon. I have even saved the juice and added more cukes to it, but only do this once and eat them as soon as the 10 days is up.

Made these for my boyfriend and he loved them!  I made enough for 3 Mason jars.  We tried to make one "extra spicy" with more jalapeños in the jar, but it didn't really seem to make a difference in the end.  Good spice with a nice mix of sweetness.  We wound up using about 1/2 the number of cucumbers called for but the same amount of brine as the recipe said.

these were just ok, for me. I don't really care for the vinegar taste. and the dill weed is kinda messy. I think you could just use dill seed, and get a better dill taste. but I won't be making these again.

Think this is my favorite. Every year I forget to save my favorite recipes and every year I do something different. I won't forget this year. Perfect balance of flavors with just a hint of heat at the end. We all loved this one.

My husband has yet to taste anything too hot, so I quadrupled the crushed red pepper flakes and seeded and quartered two jalapeno peppers for each jar and omitted the sugar.  I cut the cucumbers in quarters and we waited a week to try them. They stay so nice and crunchy.  I'll keep a few jars in the fridge year 'round as long as the cukes are available.

These are the best fridge pickles I have ever made. Just spicy enough with a touch of sweet at the end. I think using fresh, good garlic is key. I followed this recipe exactly and could not be happier with the result. All of my family and friends are asking for these pickles now!

I just made these yesterday...I couldn't wait the week to try them so I just did. OMG!! They are perfect! This is a recipe that I will use every year from now on! I used half the sugar called for and doubled the brine as some others suggested.

These are very simple and taste great!  I add a tablespoon of mustard for a little extra kick.

I am in the middle of making these pickles do you strain the spices out when you put it in jars or leave them in

Similar to another recipe I make - try adding some sliced jalapenos for a bit of flavour.

Very simple and very yummy. I followed other reviews and cut the sugar in half but left everything else as is. I always seem to have so many cucumbers in my fridge so I am very thank-ful to have come across this recipe!

These were great! Used sliced peppers from the garden instead of pepper flakes. Will definitely keep this as one of my go-to recipes. Thanks for sharing.

These pickles turned out very good. I substituted ground red pepper for the pepper flakes (because I was too lazy to go to the store). I did add some alum as was suggested by someone else. Nice and crunchy. I will definitely make these again.

These were OK, too many strange flavors going on for me. I like regular spicy dills.
