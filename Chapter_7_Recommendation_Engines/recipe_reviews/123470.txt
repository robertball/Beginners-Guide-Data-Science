Yum yum yum!  I substituted a few things...used 8 oz. velvetta and a little salsa instead of the cheese sauce.  The pineapple adds delicious sweetness to the zing of the salsa!  Highly recommended!

Really great! Besides the pasteurized cheese sauce, I also used half a can of a cheese sauce with ro- tel tomatoes in it. X-nayed the crushed pineapple and put some salt and pepper on at the end. Great dish to have on a weeknight or any night for that matter.
