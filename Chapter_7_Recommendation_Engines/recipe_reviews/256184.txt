Made this for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. I did steam the green beans a bit after saut√©ing as they were still a bit underdone for our taste, but other than that, made no changes. Beautiful company dish. Will definitely make again.

easy and delicious. I just sauteed the beans in the pan for a few min with the lid on before everything else were perfectly done

Made as written and 5 stars all the way! I am typically not a fan of nuts in my food but the preparation of these made them a bite of buttery goodness. The green beans do stay a bit firm which is how we like them but cook them a little longer if you do not like them with crunch.

I liked this. Made it without the mushrooms. I would perhaps use more butter or oil next time it seemed like the almonds soaked up a lot of the grease & didn't leave much for sauteeing the actual vegetables. Maybe using sliced (not slivered) almonds was a poor choice in that regard. Hard to say. But I would make it again. It was tasty and beautiful and smelled great.
