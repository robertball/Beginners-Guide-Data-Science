I am glad I read the reviews before i made this. I used half of the mayo and doubled the curry. I don't like green peppers so I used a red pepper instead. The taste improves every hour that it is cooling in the refrigerator. I added pine nuts (pignolia) and it made all the difference. It really added some nutty flavor. Yummm!

I made this for a tennis team with rave reviews.  I changed a few things.  I used short grain brown rice (heartier and nutty flavored), red pepper instead of green, because it's more colorful and sweeter and I used 1/2 to 2/3 of the mayo called for. I made it the next day for my best friend and her family (3 kids) and they loved it, too.

Prepared this for the first time Saturday afternoon (9/23/00) and refrigerated overnight for a small adult-only group Bible study and potluck meal Sunday evening. Many went for second and third helpings. My wife and I thought it tasted great and it was certainly easy to prepare.

I loved this recipe.  Against the advice of others, I left out the curry powder, used red peppers instead of green and used regular artichoke hearts and not the marinated ones.  I really liked it- I know I changed the recipe around a bit, but I used what I had and it was wonderful.  I also used a bit of lime juice to give it that extra kick.  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings and ate it all over the course of 2 days.  Yum!!!

I have made this salad 4 times and am always asked for the recipe!  Always a huge hit.  I omit the bell peppers and it still turns out beautifully.  After reading the other reviews, I will try less mayo and slightly more curry, though.  Thanks Kathy for a fabulous recipe! Yum!

I usually halve the amount of mayo and artichoke marinade, and add a handful of slivered almonds.  I always get a lot of requests for the recipe after taking it to a potluck, so I know it's a good one!

a great salad.  the combination of ingredients seemed a little odd, but they blend together perfectly.  Don't leave out the curry powder, it really does add the perfect extra touch.  Next time I'll use a bit less mayonnaise though.

I took the advice of some other reviewers (used 1 cup mayo and 2 jars artichoke hearts) and this salad was terrific!  Also, I didn't have any curry powder or parsley, but this salad still had tons of flavor.  Oh, and I only used 2-3 green onions instead of 5, and I think that was enough.  I will definitely make this again, and next time I'll try it with the curry powder!

This is a great recipe.  I took it to church potluck, and everyone mistook it for potato salad!
It makes a huge amount though, I will halve the recipe next time.

Very good salad. I think it was even better warm than chilled.  I halved the mayonnaise and it worked out great.  Could have used more curry powder just for a bit more flavour.

Felt the recipe was a bit tart. Took it to a large pot-luck gathering and only half was eaten.

Wow! What a surprise to see this salad here. I first made this many years ago (probably 20yrs) after hearing it on the radio on the Jackie Olden cooking show. Her recipe also included a 4oz jar of pimento-stuffed green olives, sliced. 
When you read the recipe it sounds like an unlikely mix of flavors, but it's really good. It makes a whole bunch though, and it's pretty rich, so I always halved the recipe. Thanks for reminding me of a great recipe. It will surely be on my menu this summer.

This is really good! I didnt add any celery, halved the batch and didnt put all the marinade in the dressing (although I might next time) I really enjoyed this for my lunch at work however I agree that its much better right after you make it! Thanks so much!!

This recipe is really, really good!  Okay, I did cheat a bit and I used Rice a Roni Rice Pilaf (2 boxes).  Plus, I used 2 large cans of artichokes, in water, not oil.  And, since I like the taste of curry, I used 2 teaspoons, instead of one.  Finally, I made it at approx. 1 p.m. and served it for dinner at 7 p.m.  It was GREAT

I improved on this recepie by using fresh cilantro instead of parsley and yogurt cheese (yogurt put through a strainer overnight) for the mayo/sour cream. It was a big hit.

A lovely, refreshing salad. I made it with salmon cakes and dill dip (both from this site), and it made for a great, yet light, summer dinner. The only reason why I gave this recipe four stars instead of five is because I changed it quite a bit mostly taking other reviewers' advices. So, I cut down the quantity of rice in half (except I made 1/3 wild rice to 2/3 while basmati rice: put wild rice into the boiling water first though, cause it takes about 10 minutes longer to cook than the white variety does). I also cut down on mayo to about 1/2 of a cup and used more curry than recomended in the recipe. It turned out perfect. This is definitelly a keeper, and next time I will consider adding raisins as well 'cause I believe they would compiment this salad nicely.

I only was able to refridgerate it for 3 hours before serving.  My husband and I did not like it.  We each ate a few bites.  I down sized the recipie by 2/3rds so that made a nice small amount and only required one jar of artichoke hearts.  It might taste better today after being in the refridgerator over night.

Another highly rated recipe that disappoints.  This was OK.  My husband and I wouldn't have a problem eating it if served at a party, but we wouldn't make it again.

This is a variation of a favorite recipe.  I tried this one to see if I liked the difference, but I discovered the other is easier and tastier.  Use two boxes of chicken flavored rice a roni...no green peppers...no celery...and four jars of artichokes instead of three.  I bump it up to 1 1/2 tsps curry instead.  Put it in the fridge overnight to get it good and cold.  Looking at it, people mistake it for potato salad, but I always get raves reviews, except from those who hate curry flavor.  Give it a try.  It's well worth it.

This salad is even tastier if you add a 1/2 c of chopped green olives.  Instead of cooking with chicken stock, use the chicken rice seasoning from chicken flavored rice.  Gives it a nice flavor kick!  Enjoy!

This is great with Brown rice and ony 1 cup mayo. I also added more veges to make it more of a side dish: 1/4 c fresh peas, 1/2 c canned or fresh corn kernals, 1/8 c chopped sun-dried/marinated tomatoes. Everyone asked for this recipe. It was a BIG hit!

This is one of my family's favorite recipes, and can be found in the San Francisco a la Carte cook book published by the Junior League of San Francisco in 1979. That version of the recipe suggests adding sliced pimento-stuffed green olives, which is an important addition! Do not, as some have suggested, leave out the curry!

Good recipe, very different.  Most who tried the salad did not realize it was rice in it.  I added a little lemon juice, and a little more curry.  Decreased the mayo by 1 cup.  Everyone liked it and thought it was different.  I like the amount it made, we took it to a family dinner and then had a little to eat the next day with grilled chicken.  Perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

I agree...use much less mayo and DO use some of the artichoke marinade.  The substitution of red pepper for green is a good one.  I don't use the celery.  This recipe is great for Celiacs, but if you'd prefer, it's FABULOUS with orzo pasta instead of the rice.

This was very good (after adjusting the recipe, based on several reviewers' sugestions).  I used half the called-for mayonnaise and upped the curry powder by a half.  I also substituted red bell pepper for the called-for green (milder flavor and more color).  With these couple of tweaks, this recipe will enter my lunch (carry to office) rotation.  Thanks!

I couldn't decide if I liked it or not but I  kept going back to the fridge for yet another taste till I'd used up all the clean forks.  So I guess that's a yes!

I was excited to make this recipe because of the great reviews, but I am sad to say that I really didn't like it and nobody else did either. The flavors didn't seem to go together very well. I took it to a potluck and came home with over half of it left; tried to give the rest to my parents but they didn't want it either! The only changes I made were halving the mayo (as so many reviewers suggested) and leaving out the green onions as I didn't realize I was out of them. But I doubt that was enough to change the recipe too much. Oh well, live and learn.

I am confused by all the other posts because I used all the mayo and marinade and felt it was still a little dry. I made it for an office party and tasted it the morning I took it to work and it was not my favorite. Maybe I am missing something.

Very tasty! I too cut down the mayo, skipped the green pepper and curry powder, and added 1 c of minute white rice (substituting chicken stock for water, microwaved for 5 min) + 1 6oz box of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice (cooked according to package directions for microwave, using chicken stock for water).  Fabulous!  The wild rice adds an interesting color to the salad.

Great recipe - I add all kinds of stuff to make it a little different each time. Try half mayo and half light sour cream with the marinade and curry powder for a less "strong" flavor. Add a 5 oz. can of sliced or chopped water chestnuts for crunch. Use the Mahatma yellow saffron rice (use olive oil instead of butter when preparing it). I like red peppers (for their sweetness) instead of green. Have fun, and happy cooking!

This was a different, but good. It's a good change from typical BBQ/potluck salads. I used red pepper instead of the green pepper.

This was very good...I used a baby yellow, baby orange and baby red bell in place of the green bell.  It was a yummy salad, full of crunchy goodies.  I. too halved the mayo and doubled the curry.  (that suited my tastes just fine) It really matures as it sits in the fridge.

I have made a recipe very similar to this in the  past but couldn't find the recipe so used this one.  After reading the recipe, it seemed to me that 2 cups of mayo and 3 jars of the liquid from artichokes would make for a pretty runny salad.  So I reduced the mayo to 1 cup and only used the liquid from 1 jar of marinated artichokes and I used 1 teaspoon of curry.  It covered my 3 cups of cooked wild rice perfectly!  Also didn't have any peppers on hand so left them out.  I did a pre-taste and loved it...am sure it will only get better sitting in the fridge:)

Loved it. I’d add more artichoke next time. Yes, half the mayo was perfect, double the curry powder. I like salty, so chopped green and black olives, capers, feta cheeese are great too.  A keeper.

This was yummy.  Only differance is I increased curry, added a shake of cayenne, added avocado and decreased mayo.  Oh and I used brown rice.

I sized this down for 4 servings. I used a quick cooking wild rice mixture, only a tablespoon or so of mayo, red pepper instead of green. I used a half teaspoon of mild curry powder, but a whole teaspoon of mild or hot curry powder would have been better!
It was great, two days in a row!

what a great and unique cold rice salad! I was looking for something different than another Italian dressing based pasta salad and this did the trick. I'm vegan so used veggie broth and vegan Mayo. I also only had artichoke hearts in water on hand so I threw together olive oil, lemon juice, pressed garlic, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper to stand in for the marinade. Curry powder really is key. It does make a lot so if you're just making for an average size family and not a lotluck- half it. Will for sure make again!

Wonderful recipe which I've made frequently over the past several years. I couldn't locate my recipe tonight and wanted to check my memory, so came here. Of course the recipe was on "All Recipes"! My version differs slighty: use (2 boxes) Fried Rice rice-a-roni which gives a nicer texture, use artichoke bottoms so I don't have the problem with thorny leaves etc., save the the marinade to add to the salad, don't care for stuffed olives so use black (these also enhance the appearance of the salad), the key is to use a *good* quality curry powder mixture (experiment with spice blend recipes until you find one whose flavor is just right), omit the bell pepper, use plain Greek yoghurt instead of mayonnaise when I have it on hand and top the salad with pine nuts or pecans. Add diced cooked chicken to leftover salad. Yum! Thanks to the person who suggested couscous! I'm going to try a recipe of that tonight. It seems to me quinoa would also work - just might need to adjust the seasoning.

I'm always about combining recipes and this one is no exception.  I used canned artichokes quartered, Reese brand I like best.  Obviously with substituting the canned for the jarred variety meant that I would have to be aware I would need to add more seasonings and flavors.  My choice here was to add red pepper, skip the abundance of mayo but I did use a little.  Also, I took green onions, and garlic and saute' them in a bit of oil, added chopped red pepper for a few minutes and then added the rice to the pan to perk up it's flavor.  Add the curry here so it adheres well to the rice and provides a very nice color.  Add 1/2 the liquid that has been heated up in another pan, stir. Then, add the rest of the broth to the rice, stir & bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and cook for 20 minutes. Do not stir the rice anymore(I used Arborio) Mix the artichokes, celery, a bit of coarse salt, parsley, some lemon rind and set aside.  When your rice is done you will want to cool it thoroughly before assembling the rest of the ingredients.  I took the juice from the canned artichokes & added two heaping tablespoons of mayo, the juice of one lemon, a little salt and made a dressing.  When I assembled all the ingredients I put a couple of tablespoons into the mix.  Once I was ready to serve I stirred in a handful (1 cup) of baby spinach and finished it off by pouring the mayo dressing mix over the top.  Next time I may add a bit of fresh oregano or fresh basil for a little spark of flavor.

nice but a little bland. I used about half the mayo, Brown rice and a little grated carrot, and added a fair bit of lemon juice to liven it up. Claire.

Initially it seemed like it made way to much dressing until the next morning after having been in the refrigerator overnight, the rice had absorbed much of the dressing so the mixture was a bit on the dry side and the curry flavor was barely there so next time I will use all the mayo mix and double the curry as others suggested. I did prefer it warm as opposed to well chilled.
