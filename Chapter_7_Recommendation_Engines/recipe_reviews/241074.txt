I love kale, so, this simple recipe was right up my alley!  I tasted the kale after sauteing for 7 minutes and it wasn't quite tender, so, I added a little chicken broth and covered so the kale would braise for 4-5 minutes.  I let the broth cook off and the kale was perfectly tender for our taste.   I always sprinkle a little red wine vinegar on top of my kale at the end and it gives it a bright flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!! We honestly were not expecting this to taste so good. I am trying to incorporate different greens into our diets and have never really cooked or eaten kale before. My husband was not thrilled about eating kale and has said "I hate kale", however, he ended up having seconds. Before adding the kale to the olive oil I added half of a diced onion and a 2 tsp more garlic than written in the recipe. Definitely will be making this again!

Absolutely love this recipe.  I added cabbage, a pinch of hot pepper flakes, a tiny bit of grated nutmeg,  extra garlic, 1/2 sliced white onion and it was heavenly.
My mother (RIP) often added cabbage to collard greens and I thought that I would try it with Kale.  Smashing dish.  It taste heavenly.  am grateful for your website.

Easy Garlic Kale Haiku: "Love my leafy greens, my husband called this 'kale fail.' Didn't get tender." I like my veggies on the al dente side so I was OK w/ this recipe and made it as directed; however, my husband was disappointed that the kale wasn't more tender. I sauteed it for just over 7 min., and yes it definitely had more bite than squish, so if I made this recipe again, I'd aim for a bit longer. I also think I'd have preferred browning the garlic smashed, not minced, removing it to chop and then returning it to the cooked kale before serving b/c the garlic taste didn't shine as much as I would've like, especially since "garlic" is in the recipe's title.

I liked the simplicity of this recipe. Great side and fast to make - no changes other than using kale that was already rinsed...it made preparation that much faster

For the life of me I cannot understand why people rate something less than 5 stars just because it was too crunchy at the end of the cooking time, even though they state they loved the taste. Just sample it after the time stated in the recipe and if its too underdone for your taste cook it a little longer.  For the extensive gardeners, like us, who grow stuff year round, this is most excellent.  I cannot eat raw Kale because it is just too greeny tasting but this is right at heavenly manna level. Love, love, love at first bite!

I liked this and I'm so so normally when it comes to Kale. I guess I've had some bad experiences. I do love it in Chicken Burgers though and I tried this raw and liked it too. Could have been the fact that I bought it organic and super fresh. So making this for my daughter who's a fan, made it nice that I didn't have anything negative to say but rather compliment the garlic flavor and the simple recipe that packed full of flavor. I can totally see making this again. TY

After reading some reviews, I doubled the garlic and cooked the kale for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  When done I sprinkled salt on it.  My wife loved it, and I liked it a lot.  That means it is GOOD.  And it was quick and easy.  The whole bunch (4 large leaves) did wilt down from filling a large fry pan to maybe a 1/5 full pan.

Simple recipe, though I washed my kale a lot more than directed. I added a little Mediterranean sea salt for flavor, and it turned out alright. I'd make it again. I also let it sit a little longer over low heat, and then no heat, to allow it to get more tender.

I love it!  I added more garlic and salted it after cooking.  Next time I will make 2 bunches of kale as it really cooks down to a small amount.  I love spinach cooked this way also.

This is a staple in my diet.  Sometimes I have just a large bowl of this for dinner. I've found that if I use damp kale and sometimes add just a little bit of water, it sautes better.   I also add some garlic salt to the olive oil and garlic and once I put it in the bowl, I finish off with fresh squeezed lemon juice and some parmesean cheese.  Pretty healthy and super delicious!

I ended up adding a 1/2 c of water to the kale and steamed it to soften it up.  Sorry, but this recipe is not that great.

It is as good as it gets for kale! Since I was out of olive oil I substituted coconut oil. I encourage you to try it with fresh ground pepper.

Next time I plan to add some caramelized onions and some pepper. This was super easy to make. I don't normally get kale but signed up for a produce box subscription and it had a couple of bunches in it, along with fresh garlic. So this easily fit the bill. I plan on making it again.

This recipe is delicious.  I prepare kale all types of ways and this is by far the best for maintaining the nutritious values of the vegetable.  I added a shake of Penzeys Country French Vinaigret Seasoning for seasoning.

I added 1/2 onion that was leftover from another dish and per another reviewer, added some broth after 5 minutes and braised for an additional 5 minutes. Also added a bit of salt. YUMMY!

I made the recipe but made a couple of additions. I added green, yellow and red peppers diced finely. I used about a quarter of each. I preseasoned them with garlic powder, onion powder and some Italian seasonings mix.

I'm between a 3 and a 4 for this one, but I think for more subjective preference reasons than objective quality ones. I do really like the simplicity of this recipe, but it wasn't quite garlicky enough for my taste- I think, overall, I just wanted it to have a bolder flavor. The recipe is easy to make and tasty to eat, though.

This had excellent flavor.  The kale didn't quite cook sufficiently and was more chewy than I like.  But, adding a few tablespoons of water provided enough liquid to steam the kale

This benchmarking recipe in all its simplicity is a very tasty and healthy side dish or salad. I will be making it often. I think it would pair very well with a pork or chicken main dish.

Added more garlic. I cooked this for an omelette filling and it was pretty good. Usually I hate kale, but this makes it more palatable.

This is such an easy quick way to fix such a delightful veg. My whole family loved it! I used Cajun seasoning instead of salt and pepper because I was serving it along side Cajun style fried fish.

I cooked this dish with avocado oil instead of olive, and I liked it. My husband was complaining that it was a little bit chewy but ate it  (first time in his life!)

I used baby kale and it cooked much faster.  Not as bitter too, so those who don't like bitter foods might try baby kale.  The taste is good but I agree - not garlicy enough.  Needs more!  :)  I love browned garlic.  Would probably be really yummy with roasted garlic.

I had some kale in the freezer and used that along with fresh baby spinach. Added some lemon pepper seasoning, and this was a great, simple little recipe for a healthy and easy side.

I tripled the garlic, added 2 large chicken bullion cubes,  1 1/2 cups of water and continued cooking. Toward the end I added   2'tablespoons of sugar to cut the bitterness. Now it is more interesting. I will make this again

I added a bit of butter to the mix, covered the pan with a lid and let the kale sauté in its own steam for a few minutes.
The result was absolutely delicious!

I made it exactly as indicated - although, I didn't measure the amount of kale.  Anyway, mine came out crispy.  And it was delish!  My 12 year old even liked it.

Watch your heat setting, you don't want it to turn limp or a dull green.  I added a splash of rice vinegar and a sprinkle of lemon juice.   This is a much easier, tastier way to get Kale into your diet than a salad.

Had never eaten Kale before but fancied trying it. I did this but I added prawns  to give it a bit more flavour as its a similar combination to a dish we eat regularly here in Spain.

Yummy!! Tweaked it by doubling the garlic, grated some fresh ginger root, a bit of celtic french sea salt, black pepper, white pepper powder, Sichuan chili oil (for heat!), & last I added some shaved bell pepper to my kale. I did mine in the wok, and served over plain rice with a mushroom omelette. Trying  to eat good, N' healthy!
