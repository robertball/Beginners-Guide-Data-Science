These are very nice cookies---extremely easy to make.  My reason for giving these a 4 rather than a 5 is that the texture isn't what I prefer; these are creamy rather than the crunchy that I like.   But don't get me wrong---they are still tasty.  Thanks for the recipe, Lisa!

I like that they weren’t super sweet but the cooked ball tasted like flour.  If I make again I will use almond extract in lieu of vanilla and add more toasted walnuts.

These are the best and easiest Christmas snow ball cookies I have ever had.  I used pecans instead of walnuts (it is what I had).  So yummy!  Super simple and got to use our hive’s honey to boot!
