So cute. My daughter is in Pre-K so when she has a new letter of the week, she gets that letter in her pancakes.

I don't keep bisquick in the house so I applied the directions to another pancake recipe from this site. It worked really well and my kids loved it.

I don't have bis quick either so just used my recipe. I made them tonight for my 2yo. who LOVES to identify any and all letters and numbers that he lays his eyes on - so to see a letter/number pancake he was beside himself! My son gets a bit impatient when he sees me making pancakes so, for him, I just made the letters/numbers on the griddle and didn't cover them with more batter - they cooked faster which appeased my impatient 2yo. FANTASTIC idea, thank you so much! Now I won't have to listen to a whining child & he loves seeing letters and numbers in a new place.
