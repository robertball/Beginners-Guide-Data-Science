This recipe is equally good made with bone-in or boneless chicken, and you can use a whole cut up chicken instead of just the breasts or any whichever parts are your families favorites.  I'm not sure why the site published it as only boneless skinless breasts.

Loved this recipe. The chicken was really sweet which was a nice pair with mexican beans and rice. This may have been the one time that my leftover chicken was devoured before it spoiled... stayed nice and moist in the fridge!

I tried this with a little less sugar and and I seasoned up the chicken with Seasoned Salt, Garlic, Cayenne Pepper & Black Pepper.  I also used Medium CHUNKY salsa.  It really brought the flavors together.  I joined it with Corn Pudding and Peas.  Everyone loved it.

Very nice dish. Made this for my wife on our anniversary. Easy to make and tasty. I used brown sugar with Splenda and 2 tablespoons instead of 3. Mild chucky salsa too.

This was so simple but yet so good.  I used chicken quarters, so my baking time was off but no biggy.  I just really enjoyed the hint of sweetness.  It was quick and easy and tasted great.  That's a 5 for sure.  Thanks for sharing.

We followed the recipe as written.  The chicken was very moist & tasty – along with being simple to prepare.
I’d add a little less brown sugar the next time around but that’s our personal preference.  A good quality salsa is the 
successful key to this recipe.  4 ½ stars here!

Followed this recipe exactly and the chicken came out very very dry.  1 hour is too long for 4 chicken breasts.  The flavor was good, but way too spicy for my 3-year-old.

Pretty good.  I cut down the brown sugar but could've left it the same--probably because the salsa I used was spicier (it was a medium picante sauce), so it would've been fine with the added sweetness.  I just tend to use less sugar in general bc I'm not a huge sweet fan so even where most people are okay with the amount of sugar, I cut it back.  As for the baking time--use your judgment.  I used frozen chicken breasts that I've used before that usually only take 30 min (even from frozen), but it took closer to 50 min and I'm not sure why.  So I'd just recommend with boneless skinless chicken breasts you start checking at 30 min and go from there.  With the recipe submitter's comments about making this with bone in chicken, I definitely get the 1 hour bake time.  Sometimes that isn't enough with bone in chicken in my oven!  So, use your judgment and check your chicken to be sure.  The chicken was flavorful and easy.  I could see this being a good crockpot dish--probably 4 hours on low would make a nice, moist, shreddable chicken for sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this repeatedly, with a variety of salsas, and every time it turns out delicious.  I use 3tbsp of honey instead of brown sugar, which I find works out really well--the more liquid, the better, I figure!  This has turned into a great go-to dinner when I'm tired and don't want to think too hard about cooking, because I don't even have to worry about defrosting the chicken--it defrosts and cooks just fine while it's in the oven.  Also, sometimes I throw in vegetables with the chicken, too.  They cook up very nicely.

my husband and I liked this recipe.  he is really picky, so i made some revisions.  I did everything the same except i used canned chicken. and mixed it all together. it makes it look a little like barbeque.  i then used Pillsbury crescent rolls layed flat, and put the chicken mixture in the middle. I pinched the ends of the crescent up to form a Pide style boat. great recipe! this  will go in my favorites.

This was good, nothing special but tasted ok.  The topping was actually very tastey but the meal itself was kind of boring.  Need to find a way to spice it up some and make it more interesting.  Maybe add some black beans?

My husband loved it!  I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the chicken before adding the sauce.  I also put some monterey jack cheese on top during the last 5 min. in the oven.  I paired this with a Bacon Baked Beans recipe from this site also.  My husband gave the meal 2 thumbs up! :)

Instead of using jarred salsa, I prepared the salsa myself. I used the recipe Salsa II submitted by Kiki Wood.
I agree this recipe is delicious, especially if you prepare it with freshly prepared salsa.

This was great!  I made it in the slow cooker with a little bit of extra brown sugar since I was simmering it all day.  I also added black beans and olives and served it with rice and beans.  Yum!

So simple, so delicious.  Follows recipe exactly.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Made rice to accompany and the "gravy" was wonderful over the top of it.

Loved this but will use a shallow pan like the recipe suggested as my chicken took a little longer to bake.  Used medium salsa and an extra tbs of brown sugar like others suggested.  Next time I think I will salt the chicken before I add it to the pan to bake as it did need a little salt and pepper.  Thanks for a nice, tastey recipe.  Will be making this one again.

The chicken had a great spicy, sweet taste. I used jalepeno mustard instead of brown mustard and it turned out really good.

Not too exciting, but okay.  I would not use as much brown sugar next time.  I thought it was too sweet.  I think I would use this again and chop up the chicken to use in burritos or quesadillas.

i paired this with "black beans, corn, and yellow rice" recipe from this site and warm tortillas.. was very yummy and easy to make .. the only change i made was i cooked it in the slow cooker instead of oven, very tender and juicy.
