Yum! Like another reviewer said, you will lose quite a bit of the gorgonzola to the grill as it melts. I'm thinking of putting the cheese in the middle of the burger next time to try to hang on to more of it. I ended up adding a little cheese to the top of the burgers - excellent.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this makes a delicious burger.  I highly recommend this recipe.  I used organic extra lean ground beef and accompanied the dish with sweet potato fries.  I also put grilled onions and microgreens on the burger bun. Thanks for the recipe!  Easy and delicious.

This month Allrecipes challenged the Ambassadors to make a 6-ingredient recipe substituting some or all of the protein with sausage.  I read the reviews on this recipe, and there was an issue with the gorgonzola cheese melting out of the burger when it was grilled.  I put the cheese inside the center of the burger which eliminated that problem.  I substituted half of the ground beef with Johnsonville® Mild Italian Ground Sausage which when combined with the chopped basil and garlic put this burger over the top.  I typically eat my burgers medium, but I didn’t want the sausage uncooked for obvious reasons.  But there was no reason for concern about overcooking because the mellow Gorgonzola cheese in the center and the sausage itself kept this burger moist and juicy with all ingredients complementing each other, but not one dominating. This was divine, 5 stars all the way!

My new favorite burgers. I added worchestershire sauce. I also saved 1/4 of the gorgonzola to put on top of the burger once it was finished cooking. I cooked the burgers on our inside grill. Delish!!

My husband liked these better than I did. I thought the basil was a bit overdone, which made me sad, because I had so much of it to use and was going to get rid of it in freezer burgers :p I would like to give this 5 stars because my husband liked it so much (he doesn't usually ask me what's in a burger, but this time he did...when I asked why he asked, he said, "Because I taste something and I can't usually taste that".)...but I can't give it 5, because I really do believe the recipe calls for more basil than most adults (and certainly most kids) will find tolerable. Great concept, and I will make it again reducing the basil by about a third. Thanks, Caroline Anne!

These were pretty good burgers, just not as wonderful as I wanted them to be. I will try them again using ground round, maybe, since the extra lean seemed a little dry to me. I think the cheese melted off during cooking, so I will also add it on top at the end of cooking. The basil(from my garden:)) was a really nice flavor.

I dont eat hamburgers that often, but these were delicious! My boyfriend was really impressed too. After I had made the patties, he said they looked like those burgers you get pre-made in the "speciality" section of the meat department. We both loved them. Definitely a great new spin on the hamburger. Great mixture of flavors! Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was a solid recipe- good for when you want to change things up a bit.  I think I just struggled with what to top my burger with....besides red onion & tomato.  Mayo? Spicy mustard?  My husband and I both need a sauce on our food without ruining the intended flavor or authenticity of the dish.

Very good. I have an 8x12 rack. I rolled the meat out in a rectangle slightly larger than the size of a package of Hawaiian rolls and turned them into sliders. That required 1.5 lbs of meat. Next time I'll use one lb of beef and a half lb of lamb. The Gorgonzola tends to overwhelm the beef.

Very tasty and will make again. We didn’t have problems with the cheese melting away, but still added extra on top of the burgers after removing from the grill.  We served them with grilled red onion, tomatoes slices and red lettuce and per other recommendations didn’t add any catsup, mustard or pickles

These were fantastic especially with a slice of Iowa home-grown  tomato on them.    Didn't have any problem with the blue cheese crumbling out of the burger as someone mentioned.  Will make these again.

Great flavor! The basil (and the addition of several healthy jigs of Worcestershire sauce) made the meat very flavorful. Funny, the Gorgonzola taste got lost on me in favor of the meat and thinly sliced red onion. Still would repeat for that alone.

This is excellent!!! I was searching for a different burger recip for the Memorial Day cookout and was tired of the same old burger or cheeseburger. This is like a gourmet burger! Didn't change a thing. Followed the recipe. We'll be having these again definitely! 
p.s. don't ruin it by putting ketchup or a pickle on it. I drizzled a good steak sauce on ours. Everyone loved it!
Thank you Caroline Anne for sharing this recipe!

I did a few changes to this recipe, I cut back on the basil because it was overpowering
added some wostershire sauce and a little onion soup mix to the meat and added less of the Gorgonzola cheese. It turned out great.

Taste was ok. The burger fell apart, cheese works better adding last or on the side. Does not store well so eat right away.

I made many substitutions, but it still turned out great! The ground beef I used was a little too lean when I used half of it to make another kind of burger, so for this, I added about 1/3 of a portion of fattier ground beef (maybe just 10% fat, though). I'd make it with a fattier and more finely ground cut next time than the one I used, though. 

In addition to the seasonings the original recipe called for, I added Italian seasoning breadcrumbs (just about 1 Tbspn for a 6-burger portion), since I had some extra in the pantry. I also added about 1/4 teaspoon per burger portion.

I wanted to make this a pure basil burger, so instead of mixing gorgonzola in it, I put slices of extra sharp cheddar on top. Everyone loved it!
