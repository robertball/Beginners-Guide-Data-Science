This stands out as one of the better salad recipes I've tried in awhile.  Great medley of ingredients that are gratefully just a little different from the same ol' same ol.'  I prepared this delicious and pretty salad just as written, adding some artichokes and dressing it with my own Lemon Dijon Vinaigrette just before serving.

The family raved about this salad and asked me to make it again.  I made only one change and that was to use Kalamata olives instead of ripe, black olives.

I made this for our large extended family for the holidays. Everyone raved about it. I intentionally made extra for the next day. I added the lettuce & croutons just before serving. My family enjoyed it even more. I think that by having all the vegetables & cubed cheese marinade over night was what made it better. This will definatly be our favorite salad choice.

This was good and easy to prepare. I omitted the celery and croutons and made my own vinaigrette. I also used a whole head of romaine, because I don't like just the hearts, so mine came out as more of a green salad. I roasted my own pepper and used Kalamata olives; next time I'll add more of both, along with some fresh oregano. This would also be good with feta.

My family and I enjoyed this salad quite a bit for Easter....However, the recipe did not specify a length of time for marinating the veggies; I suggest 30-60 minutes at the most.  We traveled and the dressing was on the veggies too long (in my opinion) for about 3 hours; although everything still tasted great.  Next time I also plan to use feta cheese instead of the Parm.  The salad is quite colorful and festive for a gathering!

We were ordering pizza for an impromptu get-together and, since I had little time to prepare, I was looking for an interesting salad to serve with ingredients I already had in my fridge.  This salad combo did not look immediately appetizing to me but I was swayed by the reviews to give it a try.  I made my own croutons, balsamic vinaigrette, roasted red peppers, and used asiago cheese.  Nobody seemed to enjoy it all that much and I would not make it again.

Loved the salad. Had a Mediterranian salad at a local cafe recently. This was very close to it. Delicious. Will be making it again.

I served this salad with our Christmas Eve dinner & the colors worked perfectly for the holidays.  It was gorgeous with the well-placed croutons & cheese on their individual bowls.  And besides the presentation, it was just plain delish.  With 11 guests, including 3 kids, only 1 bowl came back to the kitchen with anything left in it.  That's pretty impressive!

I added 1 cup of salad dressing & that was much too much. It made the salad too wet. I will make this salad again & even use less celery. Otherwise everybody at the party liked it.

Great recipe! It worked as a good base for me as I did change a few things. I used Iceberg lettuce since that is what was in my fridge when I was throwing this together. Since I like salad a lot, I used a whole head of lettuce and also kept my olives whole. My family loved it, and I will definitely keep this one in my recipe box!
