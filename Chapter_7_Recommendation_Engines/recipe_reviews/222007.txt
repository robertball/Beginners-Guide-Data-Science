This is not a recipe I would make again without adjusting the spices and leaving the olives out.  I love kalamata olives and cook with them frequently they were an off flavor in this dish for me.  The spices were over powering, it would have been nice to taste the vegetables.  This could be a great recipe if these changes were made.  I knew going into this it was way too much oregano, thyme, and basil but I am a believer making a recipe as written first.

I think this will be one of my favorite veggie dishes! I admit I tweaked it quite a bit, but having the basic recipe is a great help! =)

I made this following the ingredients as written.  I only omitted kalamata olives.  I found it very flavorful!  The leftovers were even better the next day!  I will definitely make it again,especially in the summer when I can get my hands on fresh zucchini and tomatoes!

Made the polenta (which was the first time I made it). It was pretty bad good !   Veggies are always a favorite !
