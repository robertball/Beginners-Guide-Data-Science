Mr. LTH, unsolicited, said, "Tell them Mr. LTH loves this."  There you go...  I used ground beef in place of sausage because I just don't care for sausage.  To make up for some of the lost seasoning, I used Italian diced tomatoes.  To add nutrients, I added shredded carrots with the browning beef/onions/garlic and chopped fresh spinach when I added the tortellini.  It was a tad on the bland side for ME, so I added some seasoned salt to my bowl and that nailed it, for me.  THANKS for the recipe!

This recipe is the best!  I used ground sausage and made it into meatballs to make it easier for my MIL and FIL to eat.   It turned out amazing this way.  My husband loved it as well!   I will be making this again as I am adding it to our meal rotation.   Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  Used ground pork and rolled into mini meatballs.  Also needed to add another 32 oz. carton of broth after I cooked the  tortellini, but I used dry tortellini.  Fresh tort. may not have required the extra broth.  Finally, I stirred in spinach before serving and topped with fresh grated Parmesan .  Thumbs up from both kids and husband.  FYI- the pepper does add some heat.  If you have kids, you may want to start with 1/2 tsp and add more to taste.  We enjoyed the full tsp.  Very good!

My husband and I thought this was really very tasty and very satisfying on a cold winter night.  Easy to make, too.  The only change I'd make, and that's just because there are only two of us, is that I'd cook the tortellini separately and add it directly to the bowls.  By the time I put the leftovers away, the remaining pasta had soaked up all of the broth.  I used mild Italian sausage in this, and we both really enjoyed our dinner.

My husband gave this a rating of five stars, which he rarely does, which is really saying something.  He thought it was very good.  I cut the sausage first before cooking just to speed up the cooking time.

This was easy and really delicious. I used ground sausage and Italian seasoning from Viviano's in St. Louis.  Next time,  I will add kale or chard.  Served with salad and garlic breadsticks.  It was gone before I remembered to take a picture.

Very good! For a kick you can also use hot Italian sausage. Instead of sliced sausage I opened the casing and made crumbles.

I will do 2 boxes of broth with 4cups of water. Also salt and pepper are relative to your tastes. Other than that. Itâ€™s a good clean up after.

Simple and hearty. 
I used a regular Italian sausage and removed the casing to improve the texture and made it easy to  get a little meat with each Tortellini.  I added stewed tomatoes and some carrots for a little depth. I also put in a small rind of Parmigiana Reggiano and served with some of it grated as well.  Really rich tasting and delicious with the pasta.  I might like to try a Romano ( more salty and less nutty) next time for a change of pace. 

Also added a little crushed red pepper and a dash hot paprika to give it little heat that really hit the mark at the back of your throat without burning your mouth.  

I used a plain sausage, but it tasted a little plain in a really flavorful soup. I should have seasoned the sausage more  while  browning. Or,  I may try an onion-garlic  or cheese-garlic sausage as suggested.

The sausage stuck to the bottom of my 2-quart pot.  It would be better if made in a non-stick pan.  Also, it would be better with spinach.

I love making soups and this one is delicious. However as I always do I make a few little side changes by adding a few extra goodies. I did however make this without the tomatoes I'm not a fan of tomato chunks in soups I took those out and added celery(a big must on soups I make) and carrots. My honey loved this I definitely will make it again. :)

I made it just as the recipe states and we loved it!!!  I might use Italian sausage next time.  Also used just plain sausage not one that must be sliced.  Either works........

I have made this recipe a number of times now.  My family loves it and I love that it's simple and I know they're still eating well. I've made it with both pork sausage and turkey sausage. Honestly, I can't tell that much of a difference and for the calories I'll take turkey sausage. Last time I made it I doubled so it could feed my family and a friend's family that needed help. I used one regular and one spicy sausage. It was AMAZING. The friend asked me for the recipe (many times because at first I thought she was just being nice) she LOVES it just as much as I do.

I used a pound of mild bulk Italian sausage instead of pork sausage . I also omitted the Italian seasoning. It was delicious.

Fabulous!  I'm not a big soup eater bit this was hearty and very filling.  My whole family loved it.  I will definitely keep and remake this recipe often.  It was also very easy.  I used cheese and spinach tortellini and sweet Italian sausage,  I can't imagine it tasting any better than it did.  #MyAllrecipes #AllrecipesAllstars
