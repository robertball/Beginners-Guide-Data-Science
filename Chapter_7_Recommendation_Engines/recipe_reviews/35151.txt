This is very close to the recipe my mom used as I was growing up.  She would make 50-100 at a time and freeze whatever wasn't used.  You don't need to defrost them when you're ready to cook.  Remember when frying the lumpia, put the seam down first - it helps to seal it better.  The dipping sauce we used was a mix of vinegar, pepper, crushed garlic and tiny chilies (and/or some soy sauce.)

My boyfriend is Filipino and I've eaten lumpia at every party and get-together we've had with his family.  This recipe is the closest thing to the lumpia his mother makes.  The only changes I tried were to half the green onions and add in 1/4 cup chopped fresh green beans, omit the salt and use low sodium soy sauce and add 2 tsps Adobo seasoning to the meat.  This adds a little more flavor without too much extra salt.  I also doubled the recipe and made beef, beef and pork, and just pork lumpia.  We like the mixture of beef and pork best!  We also dip our lumpia in a sweet chili sauce, which can be found in any asian market.  This is a GREAT recipe!  Thanks Christina.

Very very good! Very easy to do too. I ended up with about 15-16 rolls though. I chopped the veggies in the food processor. I used a pastry brush to brush some water on the ends of the wrappers to seal them. I fried them 3-4 at a time in my deep frier. One of my favorite recipes from this site so far. I've made these with shrimp/pork mixture and they are even better.

This is a great base recipe.  Lumpia recipes are flexible and you can add or subtract whatever you want.  Traditionally the raw meat is mixed with the spices, rolled, and cooked.  One advantage to precooking the meat is you can add more spices/ingredients to taste after the meat is cooked.  Before I remove the final mixture from the stove I will add dashes of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil until it tastes the way I want it.  Another good tip is to let the final mixture sit over night. This makes a big difference in the following: 1. the juices/spices coagulate and soak into the meat giving a much nicer flaver 2. Rolling is much easier because the filling is no longer wet and soaking into the wrappers 3. Since the wrappers don't absorb all of the moisture, they brown very slowly and you get a super crisp lumpia without over browning the outside and blackening the ends.  Thanks again for the recipe!!

This is a great recipe! However, I reccommend adding 1 head of cabbage and 4 medium sized carrots. The extra veggies just seem to add to the flavor and turn out just like I remember them from when I was a child. I also reccommend trying a apple cider vinegar and garlic dipping sauce--4 cloves garlic to 1 cup apple vinegar. Thanks for the great recipe!! :)

As as child in my hometown, there was a large Filipino community. Therefore, I grew up on Lumpia. ( They are so superior to Chinese eggrolls. ) Also, Lumpia wrappers are readily available in most Asian markets. Perhaps for this good review in return the submitter, Christina could add on this web site a recipe for pancit ?   :)

Positively delicious! (hey guys!) This makes a terrific appetizer, but my gang prefered this as part of their meal. I'm fortuante to have a terrific Asian market in the area, so the wrappers were easy to find. (by the way, there is a pancit recipe on this site) Also wonderful! Thanks so much Christina!

For those who can't find lumpia wrappers, you can make your own. it's just equal parts of rice flour and water. use a nylon pastry brush to 'paint' the batter on a large skillet and take the pan out of the fire once it's dry. just flip the cooked wrapper on top of some parchment paper and put on your filling. Whenever I cook lumpia, I prefer to use fresh wrappers because I can adjust how thick or thin I want the wrappers.

I've tried the other Lumpia recipes on this site and they do not even compare to this one. These turned out delicious! Everyone in my family absolutely loved them. I even froze half of them and cooked them a couple of weeks later and they tasted just as good as the first batch. Thanks for this great recipe!

I liked the filling but thought it could have used a little more flavor.  I didn't have the lumpia...actually this is the first time I've heard of lumpia.  I couldn't find any at my local supermarket, but I had plenty of wonton wrappers in my fridge.  We made mini-eggrolls with them and ate every one!  I made a dipping sauce out of orange marmalade, dijon mustard and horseradish to taste.  Thanks for submitting Christina.

I've had lumpia many times over the years and this recipe rates right up there with the best.  I want to point out that it makes 30, as indicated, but you have to use 3 teaspoons of filling, not tablespoons.  If you use tablespoons, you'll end up with about 10 lumpia the size of an eggroll.  One of the notable differences about lumpia is that it's tightly rolled, small in diameter, and doesn't have a lot of filling in it.  See my blog for additional pictures showing how I rolled the lumpia.

I almost wish I had never tried this recipe. I almost wish I didn't know how easy and cheap it is to make these in my own kitchen. Now I find myself standing in my kitchen in the morning wondering how lumpia would go with my coffee.
   Seriously, these things are so easy and awesome. My boyfriend (who eats like a bird) ate 7 of them. And they are full of veggies! So what if it's fried veggies, at least they're there! Like I said, try this recipe only if you want to open the door to breakfast lumpia.

Great  recipe, very close to the orginal recipe that was taught to me as a child. The only change that I would make is to add bakchoy cabbage and cilantro both finely chopped. The trick is to make sure that all ingredents are minced in food processor and then add ground pork. I find that using 1 pound of pork and 2 pounds of veggies balances the rolls. This is a family and gathering favorite!

We really enjoyed these!! For variation, I added some diced shrimp and glass noodles...made it into more of a spring roll, I guess. Brought it to a family gathering and there was none left on the tray. Great recipe LatinaCook, thanks for sharing.

This recipe is good and very close to my family's recipe.  Only a few things were missing, like bean sprouts and string beans.  The bean sprouts you keep whole as for the string beans you actually cut at a bias (diagonal) into very thin slices.  Instead of mincing some of the ingredients you would actually cut them into Julienne.  Now the recipe asks for lumpia wrappers which isn't very precise.  In my opinion Menlo all purpose wrappers work the best, it comes in a red package with chinese writing on the right side and you can find these wrappers at almost any Filipino store.  Also if anyone is interested in a very simple dipping sauce for Lumpia..... believe it or not vinegar and garlic is the typical choice for any filipino.  Just take a few garlic cloves and smack them a few times just to take the skins off and to release the garlics flavor and mix it in with vinegar and some salt.  Very traditional Lumpia dipping sauce.

These were good however they  needed more flavor in the meat. I added sesame oil, oyster sauce, minced ginger root, some red pepper flakes & chopped cilantro to the meat mixture after it cooled.  Made 25 lumpia and all were eaten. Used sweet chile dipping sauce.

I love this recipe!! I've been making these for years and I've found a trick to cut down on prep. Use bagged coleslaw mix! It's got the cabbage and carrots all ready to go. I usually use the whole bag so I double everything else. Also, the thinner you can roll these, the better. Sometimes I skip rolling them all together and serve the filling over rice. SO GOOD!!

I have been a USMC wife for 35+ years and this recipe is the closest i have seen to the one taught to me by a close friend who had also married a Marine. She was new to the US from the Phillipines. My family eat these as a meal with rice and asian veggies on side.  my husband perfers to americanize his, with catsup as his dipping sauce. thanks for the post

These are perfect!!! I doubled the recipe using 1/2 beef & 1/2 pork. Put in 2 extra garlic cloves (can't help myself) and had to use eggroll wrappers cause I live in a small town w/no asian food market. They were still fantastic. Doubling the recipe and using about 2T in each one, yielded about 40-45. I probably could have put slightly less filling in them and made 50 but this was fine for my group. I used Frank's Red Hot Sweet Chili Sauce for dipping. YUMMY ! ! !

DON'T BE AFRAID!  Make these!  I did and they are delicious.  They were VERY easy to make and assemble.  Ingredients were easy to find. I used pre-shredded "fancy" cabbage and carrot match- sticks to save on time.  I used about 1.5 cups of cabbage in the "meat mixture" and still would prefer more.  The flavors were perfect.  Make these ahead of time and freeze; fry up right before serving.  They stay HOT for a long time.  Great recipe.  Will make again and again.  Thanks!

This might be a little time consuming, but it freezes well and is delicious every time. I have tried this recipe, as is and with changes, and it's a huge hit every time. Here is what I have found works best for me: The half pork and half beef mixture is tastiest, although I personally prefer to use a mushroom and some meat mixture. Sesame oil tastes great for frying or baking. We use low sodium soy sauce and no salt or it’s too salty and overpowers the veggies. We don’t use garlic powder; we just up the fresh garlic. We found we need more seasoning then the recipe calls for so we season to taste as everything is cooking. As another reader suggested add some thinly sliced green beans. I recommend adding about half a small can of chopped water chestnuts which will soak in flavor yet remain crunchy. You can use most veggies without fear as long as you remember to keep the ratio of soft & crunchy, and adjust the seasoning/sauce as needed. If you have a good food processors then use it. You really do want small pieces of everything mixed together. I feel the Menlo wrappers work best, but pretty much any lumpia/egg roll/ wonton wrapper can be substituted with good results. Oh and just in case, Youtube how to fill the rolls before you do it the first time.

I had some mini lumpias at a get together years ago and loved them. so when I saw this recipe I just had to try it.
It worked like a charm.  After the first two, wrapping was easy.  Instead of frying them I sprayed them with Pam and cooked them in a small convection oven till a light golden color.  Everyone loved them.  I got about twenty-five out of the batch.  Now I freeze them in layers, in an airthight container separated by sprayed wax paper.  Whenever I want, I just pop a couple into the conv Oven and use them as sides with  stir fry or even with with a nice bowl of noodles in broth.    A great recipe for finger food parties.

This was delicious, I confess to a small modification. I added about double the cabbage and then I added about 2 tbsps of sugar to the filling. It didn't sweeten it so much as smooth out the flavors. Lumpia wrappers are time consuming to separate, but very tasty. I have made this several times and keep getting happier with my efforts. I substituted chicken for the pork and wonton wrappers for the lumpia wrappers once and they were still good. My 3 year old must have an asbestos mouth, because she grabs them up as fast as she can get her hands on them and they disappear. This has already become a favorite around here. Thanks Christina!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe. My grandma Talin used to make these and they were delicious, but I never got her recipe. I remember her adding a handful of raisins to the filling, too..maybe not traditional, but very tasty. Also, we dip our lumpia in banana ketchup (sold in Asian markets).

This was really good! I'm made it as is and then several times with variations. You don't need the oil to cook the pork as it'll cook in its own fat. I doubled the crushed garlic and upped the veggies to 3/4 cup green onions, 3/4 cup regular onions, 3/4 cup carrots, and 2 cups cabbage. I also added 1/2 lb shrimp because we love shrimp! The wrappers should be cut into quarters because lumpias are really small, with 1 TB filling per wrapper. I was hesitant to try baking these as per others' suggestions but I'm sooo glad I tried it! I sprayed them with cooking spray and baked in the oven at 425 for 18 min, flipping once throughout. This made about 70 lumpias. We definitely don't feel so bad eating so many of them if they're baked :) Sometimes I also throw in 2 tsps of fish sauce into the mix. Since my husband is Vietnamese, we eat them Vietnamese-style, wrapping each lumpia in a lettuce leaf and dipping it in fish sauce  when eating. Yum! So glad these freeze well too.

FABULOUS!!!  Living in San Diego I've had the opportunity to sample many Lumpia made by Filipino's who probably grew up making these little gems and this recipe tastes just like them!

Not to keen on the flavor...I'm still going to search for what I was introduced as a Lumpia.  I'm sure there are lots of recipes out there...I just need to find it.  Also I could only get egg roll wrappers....I really wanted spring roll wrappers.  It really makes a difference in taste.

I am Filipino and have tasted many different Lumpia recipes...this was a great one!  I found you have to be very careful with the temperature of the oil, definitely keep it at medium.  If the oil is too hot, the outside cooks too quickly and the inner wrapper doesn't get crispy.  I used Spring Roll wrappers from the Chinese grocery store.

I can't believe how easy this was. And fairly quick! From start to dinner table it was only an hour and 1/2. Could only find WonTon wrappers so I guess we had Filipino Won Tons! I fried them in a little oil instead of deep frying them. YUM! I'll certainly make these again!

This was SOOO good. Reminds me so much of the lumpia that the ladies at my church would make. I omitted the onions since I have picky kids and used onion salt instead. Also....to make this SO much easier on you, I bought the coleslaw bag of cabbage, and a bag of shredded carrots. I did put the carrots in a chopper to mince them but the already shredded cabbage made this recipe the easiest ever. Also, my mother in law suggested mixing corn starch with water in a bowl and using that as the glue. Worked like a charm. 
I froze the extra rolls for easy frying next time!

DEE-LI-CIOUS! I followed the recipe to the letter exept for the soy sauce. I didn't have any so I used a bit of Yoshida terriaki. It was quite good. I did quite a bit of "test tasting" during the cooking that I was full by the first one. I liked this recipe alot, glad I found it!

Fantastic Recipe!  Thank you!  It was my first attempt making Lumpia and this recipe was fab.  I substituted sausage for mince meat as a personal preference an it was a wonderful flavor.  Burned my tongue eating these cause I couldn't wait for them to cool!

This recipe is fantastic.  Tastes just like what I had when I was stationed in Baguio in the Phillipines.  I have been making these for years.  Hint:  To cut down on the labor, use egg roll wrappers instead of lumpia/won ton wrappers.  Cut in half or thirds after rolling.

I have never made ANYTHING asian before. I'm not that great of a cook, but I suprised my husband (whom) loves this dish the other night. It was so easy to make and it turned out WONDERFUL! He took the rest into work for lunch the next day and shared it with the guys. They were impressed that I made it by hand. I plan to make more VERY soon. SO Thank you so much for this recipe. Now I have a great appetizer to make for parties.

I made these with half pork/half shrimp and also a batch with half pork/half ground beef.  We preferred the pork/shrimp combo.  I doubled the cabbage as suggested by some.  Delicious.

These tasted great. Even the filipina girls at work were impressed. These are very time consuming so I make 50-100 at a time and freeze them for later. I use banana sauce or all purpose sauce from the oriental market on them. So good.

I made this once using ground beef but I botched it badly by not heating the oil enough and the wraps were oil-soaked :(

As for the recipe itself, I found there were not enough veggies in it. Next time I will double the amount, particularly cabbage. And, of course, ensure the oil is hot enough!

These are very good.  We used egg roll wrappers and used 2 cups shredded cabbage.  Other than that we kept the recipe the same and used a sweet and sour dipping sauce.  We also froze the lumpias after wrapping, then fried when ready to eat.  The wrappers on the frozen ones were a little chewy, but the ones that we cooked immediately after assembling were crispy.

This recipe was so simple and so easy to prepare! I took the advice of others and omitted the salt and added a lot of extra cabbage to the mix. To save on time, I used pre-shredded cabbage  from the supermarket! 

I will definitely try this recipe again and try some variations to kick up the flavour a little bit.

Great recipe! Thanks for sharing :)

I made a few changes.  I omitted the onions.  I doubled the green onions and carrots (used 1 cup EACH).  I used 2 cups of Napa Cabbage.  I only had access to eggroll wrappers.  It made 30 lumpia.  My husband and I had lumpia often where we used to live.  This is something we have really missed.  This tastes just like "the real thing".  Thank you SOOOOO much!

My step-mother was from Manila and settled in San Francisco after WWII. She made hundreds of lumpia at a time and kept them in the freezer. Her recipe was quite involved.  Ground beef, pork sausage, baby shrimp, bok choy, green cabbage, shredded green beans and carrots, ginger, chestnuts,garlic onion and green onion, fish sauce, soy sauce. I've taken up the tradition of spending 1 or 2 days a year making hundreds for the freezer and cook them up for company, parties, and sending some home with visitors just like my step-mother did. I'm teaching my daughter and granddaughters and a few interested friends how to make lumpia.  Great opportunity to sit and roll and chat and laugh.

I looked forever for a recipe that matched my friend's mother's recipe.  I finally found it.  I do a few things a little differently with regards to prep though.  After cooking the onions and port and draining the fat, I add the seasonings and then put the meat and onion mixture in a food processor and pulse it a few times to get it all into a uniform size (about the size of raw cane sugar).  I also pulse the carrots until they are about the same size of the meat mixture.  It lends itself to a consistent flavor and texture throughout the entire roll.  Everyone who has had them has commented that the flavor is wonderful, but the texture is what sends them over the top.

The first time I made these..it was a semi disaster.. The filling was good but when I tried adding them to the lumpia rolls I think I put too much filling in and they didn't look like lumpias..they looked like egg rolls and tasted like them too.I was very disappointed!.I put the filling in the fridge and went to sleep VERY frustrated.. I love eating lumpias..SO The next day I looked on YOU TUBE to see how to roll the lumpias and how much filling to put in.. AHH..it was very helpful.. I suggest putting 2 teaspoons of filling in and watching YOU TUBE video on how to roll the lumpias.. They came out so much better and tasted more like  lumpias! Also, don't forget the sweet chili dipping sauce! Next time I'm going to try with ground beef 'cause I love ground beef lumpias..

I added about 4 oz of sliced button mushrooms when I added the cabbage.  The only problem I had was the lumpia wrappers were so thin that they wouldn't stay together until I started wrapping with 2 wrappers, then it worked much better.  Not sure I like the wrappers as much as I like eggroll wrappers.  The filling was spot-on though, therefore, 5 stars.

These lumpias have become a family tradition during the holidays. The only change I made was to used WonTon wrappers, it is much easier to use than the spring roll wrappers. Spoon a tsp of mixture into the center, then roll into a smaller version of the spring roll. The result is a 2 bite appetizer or side dish that everyone really loves. The trick is to get the oil hot, then each lumpia only takes about 30 seconds on each side to cook. I usually have to buy 2 package of 50 ct WonTon Wrappers to use up all the filling, makes about 75 lumpias. I used La Choy Sweet and Sour sauce for dipping.

Wonderful recipe! I did adjust a thing or two, to my personal preference, not to fix a problem, just because I liked it a certain way. I'm vegan so I used tofu "mock pork" and wrappers that I knew were vegan friendly. I also substituted bok choy for the green cabbage, green onions for the regular onion, and I shredded the carrots. Other than that, MARVELOUS recipe!

As a kid I remember visiting Philipino friends who fed these to us all the time!  I love egg rolls but really was trying to find a recipe for these  babies...I have made these and find that they are not all that hard (especially with a mini chopper) and turn out amazing!  They fly out of my home when I make them and have given out the recipe a million times!  I have read about people using the coleslaw mix instead and next time I'm trying that because I never use up all the carrots or the cabbage and end up making 2 batches!  I also use the "mini egg roll" wrappers and next time I'm also going to try baking them to cut down on the "fry fat"...425 for 10 min...turn and another 10 min...should be nice and crispy without the "fry fat!"

If you have not tried Lumpia, I seriously suggest you take the time to try this recipe! My MIL makes these and I recently tried my hand in making them. The only change i made was using ground beef for preference over the ground pork. These are AMAZING! They are great with the lumpia wrappers but I find they are delicious with the regular eggroll wrappers as well.  This is one of those dishes you can make in bulk then freeze what you don't fry. Heat up oil at 350 and fry them straight from the freezer for about 5 min and they are just as good as they are made fresh.

I have to give this recipe a 5. I love this recipe! The only problem I had was finding Lumpia wrappers here in Ohio, so I bought springroll wrappers, which didn't work at all. I made a tester and it fell apart, so I form the filling into a meat loaf and it turned out amazingly well! So now, as much as I love lumpia, I love lumpia meatloaf even more haha Thanks for the recipe!

I prefer ground pork instead of ground hamburger because the ground pork has a lot more flavor.  My Filipino Dad who is a great cook told me to add chopped shrimp for more flavor.  I season the meat mixture with oyster sauce.  I found it easier to buy from my local supermarket in Hawaii the chop suey mix (shredded carrots, shredded cabbage, string beans) that comes in a bag.

Our family loves lumpia, this recipe is similar to the one that I use. I have a question for anyone that might be able to answer it. Our local Oriental market closed and I can't get the wrappers anywhere, does anyone know of an online store that ships these wrappers ? Thanks

Very good and very easy to make. I shred my carrot and cabbage in the food processor and also ground my pork a little finer in the processor, after cooking it first. I made some with chicken the same way and they were also very tasty. I did add some cooked bean noodles and I think it made the recipe even better. I will make this again and again!

This recipe is very good.  I read all the reviews ahead of time. So I ommitted the salt as suggested. I put in cabbage, shredded carrots and used more pork than beef.  It was very good and I will use the recipe again except I would even use more cabbage and carrots.  Thank you - great recipe

This recipe was ok. I worked with a Filipino lady that used to always make these and I loved them. I never thought about asking her how to make them until I moved 3000 miles away. There were a few things that I realized after making and eating these that I know I'll change in the future. The first being not to use soy sauce AND salt. To me, they were too salty. And after having them and comparing them to hers, Im pretty sure she didn't use soy sauce. Nor did another recipe that another Filipino friend of mine made. I don't recall tasting soy sauce in his either. I know there are many versions of lumpia and they are very easy to change. They weren't bad, I still enjoyed them. I inhaled 6 in no time with a vinegar garlic dipping sauce. I read through several recipes and noticed some require precooking the meat while others use a raw mixture. I think the next time I will try a raw mixture instead, as these just fell apart and crumbled while trying to eat them, even being rolled tight. Dipping was difficult without loosing my meat. All in all, this was a great starting point and looks like it contained most of the stuff I was used to in a lumpia. Also, mine made 21. I noticed after the first few I was over stuffing, so cut back. Then when I got to about 15, I cut back more. 1 1/2 Tbs. will probably yield 30.  Now I know what my next attempt should be. Thanks for the great start!

Revised: After sitting overnight, the flavors are more blended and mellowed. Tastes much better!

These lumpia turned out okay; made as directed, and yielded only 15.  The main issue was that the filling was too loose, which made consuming the lumpia difficult (filling fell out).  One positive - I used grapeseed oil for the frying, and it was better than any other oil I've used in the past, as it did not smoke, maintained temp, and there was no notable flavor from the oil.

Wonderful recipe and truly easy! Only two changes as we don't eat any "red meat". Used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 turkey italian sausage and fried in evoo vs. veggie oil. Made 21 and there were NONE left.

A new family favorite! I have made this recipe several times now and I can tell you it's been a requested dish for the past several parties I've either thrown or have attended. I have made it according to the instructions and I have altered it by adding my own "tastes" to the dish. Either way, it's worthy of 5 stars. My ultimate preference is to add a bit more soy sauce and I like the idea of substituting adobo seasoning instead---- very important INSTEAD--- of the salt. It may be a minor alteration, but it completely transforms the taste in my opinion. My husband like a more cabbage, so if you have extra, don't be afraid to throw in any of the extra vegetables. Also, just a comment after reading other reviews, it yielded around 25 lumpia for me I'd say, not quite 30, but it all depends on how thick you want your rolls to be if you follow the recipe as is. This recipe doesn't intend them to be fat rolls like Chinese eggrolls, and I prefer the thinner version myself. Modify it to suit your tastes, as is really what we should all be doing with any recipe. Add your own style to it! :) Try it-- this dish is killer! Preferred in my family to the actual main dish. :) Freezes very well also if you care to make them in advance or don't intend to eat much right away--- just wrap, freeze, and cook when ready. Also, cover your rolls/put in plastic ziplock bag and the wraps themselves as you're rolling them so they don't dry out. Enjoy! :)

This is a great recipe for lumpia.  I will season it a little more next time. I am actually going to buy a large food processor just to process everything instead of chopping.  I found that the meat was much better after cooked and then processed.  My son loves these... at 15 months old he runs around munching on them! Thanks for the recipe.

These are wonderful!  We are a military family and have been lucky enough to meet several Philipino friends over the years, and I must say these are as good or better than any others I've ever eaten.  Use a bag of pre-shredded coleslaw for quicker cabbage prep.  I prefer to fry in peanut oil, and make a DOUBLE batch because they freeze beautifully and you can fry them later straight from frozen.  I  ALWAYS use Simex wrappers, which are found in the freezer section.  Great served with Mae Ploy sauce!

OH, YEAH!!  You bet 5 stars!!  I changed some:  used turkey,extra cloves garlic (no powder) 4 stalks celery,mmmushrooms, bag o bean sprouts...  I used skillet and sauce pan (cooks twice as fast), (this would be AWESOME with rice I didn't have wraps so we just ate the WHOLE thing!! -- I made it for 8 serv, but my husband and I wolfed it all in one dinner!!)

This recipe was wonderful!  And not difficult to make at all.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was add about a teaspoon of sesame oil to the mixture.  I did find that three heaping tablespoons of mixture per roll only made about 15 instead of the 30 the recipe is supposed to make.  So the second time I made them I only did about a tablespoon of mixture and got a lot more rolls.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

These are very good! I have used this recipe 3 times & they are simple & delicious!  The only changes I made were 1) I doubled the vegetables  2) Instead of veg. oil, I prepped the filling in sesame oil, and 3) I added about  1/2 tsp freshly ground ginger.  There is a simple tomato paste-pineapple based sweet & sour sauce on this website that goes excellent w/ these.

This reminded me exactly of the lumpia we used to beg for every year when our family friends made their annual batch.  LOVED it!  I served it with some home made sweet and sour.  Although time consuming, I will triple the recipe and freeze it next time.

This was nothing like the lumpia my Philepino neighbors make, but it was still delicious. Meat mixture tasted good, but didn't hold itself together like a traditional filling does. My neighbor suggested adding soaked 'pan', (a bread which can be found at many Asian markets)to the meat after it has been cooked.

Born and raised in Hawaii, I ate alot of Lumpia's. This one wasn't to my liking, but it may have been because of the wrap. Where I live they don't have Asian Markets to buy the wrappers you need. I had to use Egg Roll Wrappers which is not what you use for Lumpia, it's thicker than the traditional Lumpia Wrappers. But, my husband took it to work and all 20 were guzzled by his co-workers within 5 minutes. They loved it!!

My Filipino (Bicol) father is a FANTASTIC cook so therefore I "allow" him to do all the Filipino cooking.  I wanted to make lumpia myself and couldn't remember all the ingredients so I used this with my dad's alterations.
This is very similar to his recipe except: he cuts the carrots into very small matchsticks, does not use green onion, salt or soy sauce and adds finely minced water chestnuts and a little grated ginger.  My sister adds a little oyster sauce to the mix.  
I think there is too much filing per lumpia in this recipe.  I would use only 1 tablespoon.  We make them much thinner than egg/spring rolls.
We always dip in a blend of soy sauce, lemon juice and finely chopped green onion.  My aunt taught me how to make my own wrappers when I was very young but I find it quicker and easier to buy spring roll wrappers. I buy small wrappers (3" x 3") 50 to a pack for less than $2.00.
I think there as many variations of lumpia as there are people who make them.  Use this as a basic recipe and change to your family's tastes or traditions - but make them with your family because making, rolling and frying lumpia is a great bonding experience.

My family LOVED these!! I used a bag of slaw mix and added the green onion and a few more carrots. I also used egg roll wrappers instead because I couldn't find the other wrappers! My boyfriend took these to work and all the guys raved about them!! I've had to make them several more times for them but they're so easy and delicious I don't mind one bit!!

Outstanding! I omitted the cabbage since my husband is on blood thinners and can't have the vit K, but was still great! As another reviewer wrote, use only 3 teaspoons (not 3 tablespoons) per wrapper. Without the cabbage, it made 21 rolls. I served with bottled Thai sweet chili sauce in a bowl. Everyone loved them!

I never heard of lumpias until my coworker brought them for potluck. These things are soooo yummy and satisfying. I didn't have lumpia wrappers so I used egg roll wrappers instead, which made the lumpias rather oily. Next time I'll try the lumpia wrappers and I'm sure they will turn out much better!

I make lumpia all the time.  I don't add cabbage, but I do add green pepper.  To kick it up a bit I take half my meat mixture and add a couple of chopped serrano peppers and some cilantro.  I also use at least a head of garlic.  No green onions, soy sauce, garlic powder.  If you can't find lumpia wrappers spring roll wrappers work pretty good.  I was taught by a Filipino Woman while we were in the Air Force.

These were pretty good fresh out of the fryer but when I served them at the party they had developed into a bland and heavy thing.  I did use eggroll wrappers which I think are bigger (and therefore detract from the filling).

AMAZING!!!! I used ground beef in place of the pork but otherwise made as directed. I found the wrappers at my local asian mart and the prices on the ingredients were a third of the price in the grocery store. I would not use won ton or egg roll wrappers due to the thickness. I served them with a sweet chili sauce and fried rice. So good! Thanks for sharing!

It's OK, a little light on flavor. I added 1 Tbsp oyster sauce and it still tasted a little light. Might want to add more something to it. Good way to cook w/o a lot of oil.

I followed the recipe exactly, except used ground sirloin instead of ground pork and used egg roll wrappers instead of lumpia wrappers (I'm not sure if there is a difference?). The shredded the carrot instead of mincing. They were a huge, huge, HUGE hit with my husband and three picky kids.

I grew up with Filipino food and this recipe is fantastic. I make my lumpia a little bigger so it only made about 18, rather than 30, but they were very tasty!

Excellent recipe!! My friend makes lumpia's but never finished giving me the recipe. This one tastes exactly like hers. I made2 adjustments- I mixed jimmy dean sausage roll with ground beef- YUM!! and I seasoned with a little adobo along with seasoning mentioned. They came out delicious!!! Was able to freeze 15 and we ate up 15 between the 3 of us...:-) Served with Sweet chilli sauce! (the lumpia papers are a headache to work with but sooo worth the effort.)

This recipe was delicious. I did take the advice from one of the reviewers and left out the salt and used low sodium soy sauce. This was a huge hit with my family.

Simply the best, most authentic recipe I have found. The only thing I changed was using half ground beef and half ground pork together plus using a bag of cole slaw mix in place of cutting up the carrots and cabbage. A huge time saver. Love, love, love this recipe!!!!

Wow!  I made this recipe for a group of hungry guys and they all raved about them.  I made mine in spring roll wrappers, and a bit bigger than traditional lumpia.  I've since made this recipe again and used to fill egg rolls.  I must say that the filling has a bit too much pork for traditional egg rolls, which generally have more veggie than meat.  I'm going to try again, but cut the pork down to 1/4 and double or even triple the veggies.   This is a fantastic recipe that will show you just how easy it is to make roll filling and give you a great starting point for your favorite ingredients.  I intend to try this with diced shrimp, veggies and celephane noodles.  Mmmmmm....

The filling is good although I upped the cabbage and carrots and mixed in 2 tblsp Hoisen sauce. I used all green onions. I bought a frozen package of all purpose wrappers and they were a bear to peel apart after completely thawing out. I accidentally wrapped a few in double wrapping (not good) because I wasn't aware how thin the wrappers are. 5 of them got torn while attempting to separate them correctly. Anyway, once I figured it out, I rolled them up and froze them. The 5 I fried fresh wanted to split and filling spewed out the ends. The frozen ones fry up nicely as long as you have oil at 350. This adventure takes some practice and patience is all I can say but in the end, the pre-frozen ones fried up great without falling apart. Prepare for some time wrapping these up and don't overfill  Mine were about 1/2" diameter "logs". Couldn't get them any smaller w/out it being all wrapper versus filling. Mine actually looked the the photo posted. When I want to take the time, will make again! After considering the 5 destroyed wrappers + 5 lumpia I had to throw out, This will make 30 Lumpia using 1 tblsp of filling each. Very tasty treat! UPDATE: I'm so happy to have these lumpias, frozen and ready to deep fry for 5 minutes. SO YUMMY. I will def make again to have on hand. Just ate 4 of these and still want more!

The sweet chili dipping sauce is simply awesome. A good substitute is sold in Wal-Mart, but the one from the Asian Markets are MUCH better.  We make lumpia all of the time (married into a Filipino family) so we don't write down what we do. I needed to find something close for a friend, and this was pretty much it.  We also use the beef/pork combo.  I am going to have to try the adobo seasoning the next time just to see.  :)  The secret to sealing the edges is brusing egg whites along the edge.  By brush, I mean dip your fingers in the egg white and rub it along the edge.    If you think you would like it added to the lumpia, add it!  Be careful cooking from frozen.  Keep the oil temp at medium to medium-low to prevent the oil from reacting violently and caushing a fire.    (Yes, I have done it! But anyone who fries stuff knows to keep a LARGE lid or cookie sheet to slide over a grease fire.  Turn off the heat, wait a minute, remove the lid, and pick up where you stopped. When you turn the heat on again, keep it LOW!)  Thanks for saving me the trouble of trying to measure what we use while making these treats!

This lumpia is really delicious and really easy to make.  The only variations I did was I used a lot more cabbage than what the recipe called for and I used ground sausage because it has more flavors.  I only scooped one to one and a half spoon of the filling instead of three because lumpias are supposed to be skinny when they are rolled up.  When I did this the first time, I was only able to make about 15 lumpias. You can squeeze about 25 to 30 lumpias if you are consistent with your scoops.

This was awesome!  I tried this fried as written, as steamed dumplings, and as a lettuce wrap. All three preparations were delicious but I have to say that my favorite way of eating this was straight out of the pan!  The recipe made more than we were going to eat so I refrigerated some of the filling and ate it the next day heated in the microwave.  The best!!  Also served homemade fortune cookies from this site.  How fun!

OMG....these were sooooo good. The entire family loved them. Being military, we always have lumpia at parties and get-togethers. I had a craving for some and tried these. Perfect! I will make these again and again without changing a thing. Thanks a million for an awesome recipe!

VARIATION: Instead of shredded cabbage, use French cut green beans (thawed and dried, not canned).  Add chopped up water chestnuts for texture if you like that crunch.  Peanut oil is the best for frying this, I think.  Also, the prep time wasn't as long for me... (?) Not sure why.

Close to what we had growing up a little different instead of carrots we used bean sprouts and added raisins. The raisins add a lot more flavor

WOW! I grew up in Hawaii and after being away for 15 years, I feel like I have taken a trip down memory lane. This recipe is delicious, and yes, they are much better than egg rolls. Instead of shredding cabbage and carrots, I buy the preshredded mixture in the bagged salad section.

These are so easy to make and so delicious. These are asked for often at our family gatherings now that I have this wonderful recipe.

Mahalo!

SO good! we always set half of the rolled up, uncooked lumpia aside and freeze for another time because if we cooked them all they most certainly would ALL get eaten. I let them sit in a single layer in the freezer for an hour or so and then bag them up so they will separate more easily when we go to use them later. Also we have found that adding some frozen peas near the end of the meat mixture's cooking time adds a nice pop of color and texture. Usually eat them with sweet chili sauce or sriracha

This was the 2nd time i made these but on the first i used the wonton wrappers like another user suggested because i didnt find the spring roll/lumpia wrappers in the local grocery store. I liked them but found it difficult to wrap with the wonton so i ventured out to the Oriental Market and got the correct wrappers and the lady at the market suggested a sweet chili sauce for dipping. WOW!!!!! THIS IS A KEEPER!! make sure you use the correct wrappers though. Thank you for an original recipe!!

This is a wonderful recipe and a staple of my kitchen now.  I use spring roll wrappers because I haven't found lumpia wrappers, but they work fine.  I use ground turkey instead of pork and at least 1 cup of chopped cabbage. In fact, I usually buy a "cole slaw mix" and chop up that along with some chopped baby carrots. I put a tablespoon or more of soy sauce, and I include a can of chopped water chestnuts.  I use dried minced onion rather than spring onions.  They're always a hit!

I had wanted to make these for a long time, but I thought that they would be really hard to make. Boy, was I wrong. They are really easy and they taste wonderful!! My family loves them. I have made them twice, the first time I used ground turkey, and the second I did not use any meat. They are great both ways.

This is sooooo good and not as hard to make as I thought.  It didn't make as many egg rolls as it said, however, so I doubled the recipe.  It is greasy but even my kids loved it!

These were super easy to make, i used extra lean beef with carrots and celery. I also added alittle ginger. Turned out great, just make sure you keep the spring roll shells moist or you'll have a hard time folding!( found out the hard way) I also didnt use that much oil for cooking, alittle goes along way for a less greasy roll. I will make again!

Excellent!! Loved this recipe. I followed the recipe but made a few adjustments. I used a napa cabbage...about 2c. thinly sliced(will use more next time because it shrinks down), added about 5 sliced shitaki mushrooms while cooking the onion and garlic, and I used already packaged julienned carrots and fresh bean sprouts in addition to all the other ingredients listed.  I was able to get 18 lumpia out of all of this! Maybe I filled them more than I should have...but they were incredible!! Cooked perfectly and none fell apart. Used 3 different dipping sauces. Duck Sauce, Mae Ploy(sweet red chili sauce found in an Oriental food market), and "Oriental Dipping Sauce" found on this site. 3 different tastes....with a great lumpia recipe!!

I make lumpias all the time and this is my go to recipe. I would be making them everyday if all the prepping and chopping wasn't so tedious. 
I typically use ground chicken rather than pork for personal preference and it tastes awesome. sometimes I make them vegetarian by swapping out meat and replace with diced firm tofu and re-hydrated shitake mushrooms. 
It is crucial to buy lumpia wrappers from Asian markets since most American brands are much thicker and pricier.

I make this all the time and spotted a few mistakes.  Traditional Lumpia is made from ground beef but you can use pretty much any type of meat from chicken, pork, beef, etc.  Favorites are leftover pot roast.  Must do's:  grate, not dice the carrots. Forget the green onions, they cook out too soon, use regular white onion.  AND!  Be extra choosey with the brand of wrapper.  I use Spring roll wrappers from the Asian market.  Wonton wrappers are too thick, commercial egg roll wrappers are also VERY thick and do not flake.  Only the Asian made "Spring Roll" wrappers will produce a golden colored flakey and light Lumpia.

Good recipe! Omitted green cabbage and used deep fryer. Use paper plates (not the type with shiny surfaces) and paper towels to drain them. Dip in sweet and sour sauce. Very yummy.

This tastes EXACTLY like the lumpia the lumpia my friend from the Philippines makes.  It is amazing and so easy to make!  Just a note...fresh rice paper or frozen rice paper are easier to work with.

I bought a bag of cole slaw mix and added canned mini shrimps instead of pork.  I used a little too much salt (didn't measure salt), but they otherwise tasted good.  I'll try again tomorrow using pork and less salt.  Best I've tried.  Thank you.

This is the absolute closest that lumpia has ever gotten to my grandma's amazing recipe. To add more flavor, I used a TON (like quadruple the amount) of cabbage and twice the amount of carrots. I also have made this recipe with ground pork mixed with ground beef. DELICIOUS! Thanks for the recipe!

After my husband ate 5 1/2 rolls, I had to prohibit him from eating more so he doesn't get a stomach ache. The taste was not like my grandma's lumpia but it was still good.

Delicious! Used some left-over pork loin roast which I ground up in my food processor.   Heated up with the cooked carrots, green onion and cabbage.  I added a bit more soy sauce.  I used wonton wrappers and also used sweet and sour sauce for dipping.  I must not have used a pound of pork as this made 10 won ton wrappers, which I filled with heaping 3 Tbsl. of the filling.   Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  Will be making again and again....

Very traditional recipe that I was taught by a lovely Filipino lady when I lived on Guam years ago.  She taught me to make the wrappers with cornstarch and water, swiping the mixture on a hot griddle with a sponge.  An authentic dipping sauce for these is garlic infused vinegar...crush a clove in a dish of vinegar, let sit for a few hours.  Yes, smelly, acidic, but wonderful!!  Also can dip in chili sauce or Chinese style mustard.

I grew up eating the authentic Lumpia that a family friend made using her grandmother's recipe strait from the Philippines.  I had not had them in years and was craving them.  I used this recipe and it was exactly the taste I remembered.  So delicious.   I like this filling so much, that I sometimes stir in prepared rice and make fried rice instead of the lumpia rolls. Yummy!

Wow, these were amazing!  I followed the recipe exact, except I could not not find lumpia skins.  I ended up using spring roll skins and they came out great anyway.  To use the spring roll skins, just put water on a dinner plate and place the skin in the water for a couple of seconds on each side, or until it's soft enough to work with.

These were excellent!  I made these into egg rolls instead of lumpia.  I didnt have pork so I used turkey.  I wanted them to be a little sweet so I added in a couple tablespoons of brown sugar and a little more soy sauce to make them a little juicy.  This filling was great for egg rolls!  After dropping them in the fryer and making them nice and crispy, they were the perfect egg rolls!  I will make them again and again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  I used the springroll wrappers found in the frozen section of the grocery store.  After all ingredients were cooked I put them into my food processor for a few pulses.  This made a great consistency for the filling.  These are a lot of work, but well worth it.  They freeze well too.

filipino food isnt complete withourt lumpia!. i grew up having them around. we even had lumpia shanghai yesterday for dinner with steaming rice. there are so many variations of fillings you can use, "lumpia shanghai" are small lumpias about 3 inches long, "lumpia toge" uses monngo brean sprouts as filling, with a little ground pork/beef, "lumpia cebuana" uses sotanghon as fillings along with cabbage, carrots etc.,"fresh lumpia" uses semi cooked soft special wrappers (like crepes but unsalted and softer!) filled with fresh cabbage strips,little meat, carrots strips etc. my lumpia filling yesterday was a variation of ground pork, onions, garlic, salt and pepper, and mash potatoes. this gives the filling an extra sticky texture so it wont easily fall off or its a lot easier to wrap.

I made about 50 of these for our 4th of July block party and they tasted delicious.  Definitely a 5 star recipe.  I bought the lumpia rolls and they were really easy to roll.  Next time I will use the spring roll wraps since these are easier to find (you have to go to an asian store to get the lumpia rolls).  I am ready to make more.  I used this exact recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

These were so good! I used ground turkey instead of pork, and I subbed minced potato for cabbage. Other than that I kept it the same. I am sure it would be good with any kind of meat.

This was great, took me back to my childhood.  My family loved them too.  I used beef (sirloin) and left out the cabbage (that's how I always had it) and used a vinegar and garlic dipping sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I grew up around a large Filipino population and this reminds me of 'home'. Bean sprouts could be added. 
Delicious! Family and friends enjoyed it as well.

I'm Filipina-American and I thought this lumpia recipe was great.  I added raisins (just my taste) as I was rolling them along.  They came out well.  I made them a 2nd and rolled smaller sizes (like cigarette rolls).  I liked them better mini-sized (like lumpiang shanghai).  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday.  He used to get it when he was in the air force and stationed in Guam, and he talked about it all the time.  They came out soooo good, and he loved it.  The recipe only yields about 15 lumpia though, not the 30 that they say.  I left the salt out like many other reviewers said to, and they came out great!  Loved it!

I used ground beef and that is the only change I made.  I will defintely double the veggies next time and the lumpia wrappers were a little hard to work with (for me) but they were delicious !  Will definetly make again maybe I can get the hang of it !

This recipe is great! I agree with no salt.  Like my mom does, crushed some fresh garlic and mix with some vinegar (enough for dipping) with salt and pepper.  Dip your lumpia in it!  Enjoy

This is a very good recipe but I must admit that I made some modifications.  I used cooked chicken breast which I ground in the food processor and turkey sausage.  I also added more garlic, some grated ginger, crushed red pepper flakes, a little apple cider vinegar and a little sake (around a tbsp). I am sure it's not very authentic but it was extremely tasty!

When I lived in San Diego, from time to time our Filipino friends would make lumpia and bring some to work, or by the house.  It was a very big favorite of ours. 
Since we moved to Maryland, we haven't had it, and I've been looking for a recipe for it.
This one is fantastic, if it's not exactly the same as we used to get from our friends, it's very, very close.
Thank you for sharing it.

Delicious!  My daughter helped wrap some and ended up with only 17.  My kids loved it!  I made a homemade sweet and sour to go with it.  I'm going to take some to a church fellowship tomorrow.  There are a lot of Philippinos in our church, so we'll see how they like them. :)

I got this recipe from a friend who made these for a gathering we had.  Her's were absolutely delicious!  Mine, while good, still need some work.  Hubby says they get better each time I make them!

No changes and yes I would make it again.  I would possibly add a bit more spice.   ** Let's put it this way...I'm up at 1:30am working on the computer and I'm fighting the urge to go downstairs and have a cold one from the fridge.  (I recommend making a sweet sauce and a Hot Mustard sauce for heat) Delicious!

Great recipe, the only changes I made were adding about a tablespoon of sesame oil to the vegetable oil and onion powder with the garlic powder.  It adds a ton of flavor.  As for some reviewers stating that it wasn't flavorful enough, I just keep adding more of everything and tasting it until it's to my liking.  This is my go to recipe every time I make lumpia.  Thank you for posting it!  It's delicious!

Very easy and delicious!! Note: DO NOT try to substitute the Lumpia wrappers with (dry) spring roll wrappers! They do not hold up to the density and turn into a gelatinous mess! My second attempt came out beautiful with the right wrappers.

I love this recipe, but I added some Chinese five spice and crushed red pepper flakes to give it a bit more oomph. I also used a 340 gram bag of broccoli slaw instead of the carrots and cabbage, super easy!

Okay, I only made the pork and vegetables, skipped the wrappers and frying because I'm trying to lose some lbs. But, it was still great. The only thing I did differently was substitute sesame oil for  vegetable oil and added fresh ginger. I can imagine this would be amazing wrapped up and fried, yum. I WILL try that some day.

These were excellent!  The filling was so fragrant while cooking.  This was my first time using  lumpia wrappers- they were a little difficult to work with but well worth it.

This recipe was awesome and yielded restaurant quality crispy lumpia. I thought the recipe for the filling was 100% perfect. Since this was my first time ever dealing with lumpia wrappers, I experienced some technical challenges. 

Lumpia wrappers are highly delicate (just like filo dough.) You must keep them covered with a damp cloth during use or they will dry out. Separate into sheets very carefully to prevent tearing. Since it was my first time, I ripped a few during the wrapping process.

The only thing I added was egg wash to seal my wrapper. I used the round wrappers as well which have a different wrapping procedure from the square ones. As soon as they hit the oil, they form the crisp shell very quickly. This was such a good recipe and my family really enjoyed it. It will be added to the list of my favorite recipes.

For special occasions, my mom would roll cheese in the middle of the meat (just like how you roll maki, I guess. the rice is the meat mixture and the carrots, crab stick and everything else is the cheese) make sure not to mix the cheese with the meat before rolling them up because when the cheese melts, it will go out through the seams and would ruin it.

I grew up eating either meat lumpia or veggie lumpia, but never combined. Kinda weird to me. I haven't even been to a restaurant that makes it like this. Also, they're not "egg rolls," as they're made with rice wrappers. If anything, they would be a Filipino version of a spring roll. But ask any Filipino, they're called lumpia!
I'm sure this recipe is tasty but it's not what I'm used to, personally.

Just some background info: my mom is from Manilla and dad is from Sto. Tomas. I'm from San Francisco. :)

Great basic recipe.  I would suggest adding spices to get the taste where you really want.  Also try rolling out the wrappers so they are super thin, and then cut in half along the length of the wrap.  The lumpia will be long and thin; cut in half before frying.  Provides a thinner and crispier roll.

The only reason this recipe didn't get 5 stars is because the quantity is off for doing 30 wrappers if you use 3 heaping tablespoons.  I was a little heavy with the veggies and still was only able to make about 15 using level scoops. If you use about 1 & 1/2 tablespoon you would get the 30.  I'm glad I tried this at home before planning a party otherwise I would have been short.  That being said, the flavor is wonderful.  I could eat it by itself or even over rice.  I'm serving these with traditional pancit tonight :)

These were great.  My husband grew up in the Philippines and was craving lumpia.  The only change I made was sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  The sesame oil really makes a big difference.

It is a good recipe.  However, my mother was born and raised in the Philippines and the traditional way to make Lumpia is to not cook the meat because it gives it more flavor.  It will be cooked because the Lumpia will cook with the heat of the oil.  You should cook on low 3-4 minutes, and you add an egg to the mixture.

These were great!  I used ground beef. I prefer more cabbage/carrots to my lumpias but this is good as written.  I only got 20 rolls by using 2 heaping tablespoons. The best way to seal is to make flour and water mix until paste consistency. Used Mae Ploy's sweet chili sauce or a filipino vinaigrette dip. Update: I added more cabbage/carrots and had exactly 30 rolls using the same 2 heaping tablespoon.

I used won ton wrappers (easily found in most stores) and rolled on a diagonal. A little more than a tablespoon of filling per wrapper.  I did follow a suggestion to put everything in the food processor. I did this with the veggies before sauteing them and back in the food processor with the meat after everything was cooked.  I added a T of Better Than Bouillon while blending.  And served them with (mild) Sweet Chili Sauce.  Yum...the flavor was great.  
Thank you for sharing your recipe.

These are really good. I add raisins to mine and you would not believe how wonderful they are. I make a dipping sauce for them out of vinegar (1/4 cup), sugar (1 1/2 teaspoons), and pepper (1 teaspoon). Stir well and dip lumpia!

These were soooo yummy.  I served them with a store bought bottle of Red Chili dipping sauce. I served them at a dinner party and both adults and children alike gobbled them up.

I used cole slaw mix as a short cut,and added cellephane noodles & baby shrimp. It was definitely a crowd pleaser...and its easy to add your own touch without ruining the recipe.

OMG! These are so delicious!!!, My mom use to make this when I was a kid and as it was cooking it smelt just like hers. The only thing I changed was the meat I used morningstar veggie crumblers.  I made homemade sweet and sour sauce which was 1 tbsp corn starch mixed with enough water to make it slightly runny (set a side) then in a pot mixed 1/4c light brown sugar, 1/4c apple cider vinegar & 1/4 c water stirred the mixure in the pot and brought it to a boil and then added the corn starch mixture stirring til it was well mixed and began to thicken. The sauce was enough for about 9 lumpia but if you need more you have to use equal parts for the the ingredients like 1/2 c vinegar, 1/2 c water, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 tbsp corn starch. Oh yeah I also added a little ketchup to give it a redish color. Anywho my husband thought it was the Indian chutney from the store. And he gave me a thumbs up on the lumpia so I will consider it as a meal on our list. YEA!

My friend's parents are from the Philippines and I've tried lumpia several times at her parent's home.  This recipe is almost the same to her mothers.  I added 1 tsp. of oyster sauce and 1/4 cup of raisins to give it some sweetness.

I used packaged coleslaw mix and it did not add the vegetable crunch I like. Next time sliced cabbage and much more than 1/2 cup.

Great Recipe. The only thing I do different is put all the ingrediants into a food processor and just chop for a few seconds.   (We cant get Lumpia wrappers.:( all we have is wonton wrappers available to us and since wontons are small its easier to roll with a finer and uniform chop on the ingredients)  thanks for sharing your recipe

These are the best lumpia I have ever tasted.  The first time I made them I made the mistake of using egg roll wrappers (I didn't know there was a difference.)  Got lumpia wrappers from the local Asian market.

This is a great recipe, I'd say pretty close to a dear friends grandmothers recipe!  Added 2 egg whites and water chestnuts.  Also mixed 1 lb ground pork and 1 lb ground beef ... which meant I needed to pretty much double the recipe.  Great combination!!!  I loved it, family loved it, grandparents love it ... thanks for sharing.

I have been making this recipe since my high school cooking teacher in Hawaii taught us how.  It's absolutely delicious!  We use hamburger instead of pork, and usually serve it with a choice hot mustard or soy sauce which is easily made with regular mustard and fine horseradish.  It also makes great hors de vers cut on the bias and lined on a tray or stacked on a plate for a meal.  Great snack for Super Bowl parties, in fact it's requested at our yearly party, easy to make ahead and freeze wonderfully so you can just drop them in the oil the day of the party and fry them up!!!!

These were so good! For mine, I used ground turkey and I used a confetti coleslaw mix to sub for the cabbage and carrots (I don't eat cabbage hardly ever) so then I just added a bit more shredded carrots and they were delicious. My mom who is very picky with anything out of the realm of classic american foods loved them!

Loved this one.  Used grated carrots and chopped the green onions a little chunkier for our taste - it was great!  Will try to bake it at the 425 like someone mentioned to lighten it up a bit - but it had a great taste.  Used eggroll wrappers and got 32 big lumpia out of it with enough filling left over to make some killer fried rice to go with it!  Thanks for sharing - I'm making it again soon!

As my Mom says when I first made this, "You've perfected the recipe."  This is really the best recipe I've used ever.  However, I did some changes: I used 1/2 cup of chopped water chestnuts instead of cabbage (for crunch!) and added 1 additional clove of garlic.  And I didn't cook the meat first -- I placed the raw pork in the wrap, and fried them a little longer (medium heat 'til it's golden brown).  And everyone (Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike) LOVE IT!

I thought it was ok.  I followed the recipe exactly.    I think I was looking for more of a Bang!  My husband liked it, but not as much as egg rolls or spring rolls that I make.

I messed it up. I accidentally bought spring roll wraps and they came out like egg rolls. They were just not real lumpia. I didnt add carrots or cabbage either i think this made it bad too.. I am going to try it again and see how it comes out.

These are delicious, a little time consuming, but WELL worth the effort and time. My husband and I made these for our neighborhood 8-8-08 (Olympics party) party and they were a huge hit !! Definitely recommend trying these.

I used low-sodium soy sauce, but will definately use regular next time.  This just isn't a good recipe to modify the sodium on.  Go ahead and splurge!

Followed this recipe to a "T" Except I used wonton wrappers they were all I had. I have to admit I have never made these before and only eaten them twice, and I was nervous about adding cabbage because I thought the ones I tried did not have cabbage but its a wonderful compliment, tastes great!!! Still turned out amazing and even my filipino friend loved them, they were a hit!

The recipe is really easy to follow. I just cooked them and they were delicious. The only thing is that if you dont like spicy food much, only add 1/2 spoon of black pepper instead of 1 spoon. I really recommend this recipe. Jos

I had a neighbor when I was a kid who used to make lumpia and send over platefuls, so when I found this recipe I got very excited. They were relatively easy to make and tasted great. I used wonton wrappers (as used by other reviewers) since they were easy to find in my local market. The resulting smaller size was perfect for an appetizer. I got more than 45+ mini lumpias (maybe even more since I didn't count--the wonton package had 60 wrappers and only a small amount was left when I ran out of filling). I will certainly make these again.

This recipe was extremely simple to make - and very tasty.  I used eggroll wrappers and added extra garlic & onion.  My sister who usually doesn't care for meat, loved them.  I would definitley make this again.

Outstanding!  I added grated jicama and bean sprouts, and used a bigger dash of worst.  I doubled the recipe and made about 25 quarter-sized rolls.  A note about spring roll wrappers:  Buy them as fresh as possible, or keep them frozen until 30 mins before use.  Also, once opened, make sure you keep them covered with a very damp towel.  They will be much easier to work with.  UPDATE:  Second round of lumpia and I was out of garlic powder so I used california blend garlic salt, omitting other salt.  Also used tube sausage.  Wow!  This recipe POPS!

My BF and I made this recipe for his family's christmas dinner and I must tell you, it was a hit! His mom said that it was probably the best egg rolls she's ever had in her entire life. Now she knows what her son (my BF) MUST bring every time there's a family gathering. 

I was able to make 30 egg rolls out of it, just like the recipe said. It also goes best with the sweet chili sauce (for egg rolls) that can be found most in Asian stores. 

Thank you so much for this recipe.

Made this recipe twice and it was great both times. I did use more soy sauce and also added some shrimp. Only thing I didn't like is that they are really greasy. I will continue working on lowering the grease factor but other than that a great recipe.

The lumpia wrappers seemed difficult (but I have never cooked with them before), I think I will try to make my own next time. Other than that, the recipe tasted great!

These are a lot like the ones a co worker of mine used to make. My suggestion is to nix the salt, it's not needed and it makes them taste very salty.

I couldn't find plain ground pork, so I used "country" style ground pork.  And my green cabbage was crazy expensive, so I used 1/2 the amount of red cabbage and some bean sprouts instead... still even with the tweaks, they came out delicious.  I will definately make again.  Mine came out a bit oily even though I tried really hard to drain everything well.

OMG! These are awesome! My husband actually suggested I wrap up the filling with 2 wrappers instead of just 1, which turned out perfect! My family devoured these! Thankyou sooo much for the recipe!

My first time making lumpia. I did 1-1/2 times the recipe (1.5 lbs of ground pork) and followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out delicious! It takes a bit to get the rolling down, but after the first couple, it was easy. Be sure to keep a damp towel over the wrappers while you are working with them to keep them from drying out. I also placed a damp paper towel over the rolled lumpia. I ended up freezing about half of them to fry at a later time. My package of wrappers contained 25 wrappers. Using 1-1/2 times the recipe, I did have a little bit of filling left after making the 25 rolls. Will make these again! Thanks for the recipe!

No but next time, I will add raisins and green peas. I remember having them in the lumpia and it made it even more delicious.

Made this last night, doubled the recipe, added shredded mushrooms as well, and kept the meat mixture raw. You can wrap them without cooking the meat mixture first. The oil always ends up cooking the meat to the prefect temp. Perfect for dipping in sweet chili sauce

Skipped the salt because there is enough natural and didn't miss it's. My frying times were double but not a problem because it is based upon color.Will make it again

Perfect, but don't use cilantro. There aren't any Filipino dishes that use cilantro, and it changes the flavor profile significantly. Instead of cilantro, use grated or minced ginger.  I omitted the green cabbage, and used bok choy instead because that's what I had on hand.

For authentic dipping sauce, use finely diced garlic and white vinegar (Datu Puti brand has cane sugar) in 1:1 ratio. Ang sarap!

A little light on spice but very good! I grew up eating lumpia that had French style green beans so I added them to my lumpia. I doubled the garlic and soy sauce to our taste. Also added water chestnuts because it's the only way I can get my oldest dauggter to eat them. They turned out so good! I'll definitely be making these again!

Excellent Recipe.  My mom used to make them with beef and pork (seasoned), and would cook shredded carrots and potatoes with the meat.  She would let it sit in the fridge overnight to let the juices go to the bottom, and allow the seasoning to marinate into the mixture.

I jumped at this recipe as it immediately reminded me of the huge Lumpia wrapped in a lettuce leaf I used to get from Lien's restaurant in Guam as a young Lieutenant.  On the eating side, this recipe has great flavor...the whole family liked them.  Only down side was in production.  I gained a new appreciate for the folks who wrap these things for a living.  I was only able to find "Spring Roll" paper...so perhaps that was part of the problem???    But I really struggled with getting them wrapped well, so they wouldn't fall apart in the oil and stick to everything.  It got better towards the end of the batch, so recommend you try a batch to experiment with before you try to impress anyone with a meal.  Soaking the wrappers for a shorter period and turning up the oil heat to medium high seamed to help.  The final product still ended up much greasier than I expected or would have liked.  I'm not going to give up on this one.  Suggestions?

Delicious recipe! I used more filling in each wrapper than is traditional, so next time I'll make more filling. I used about 12 wrappers for the amount of filling I had.  We left out the cabbage since we're not big on cabbage and would've wasted the rest of a head of cabbage.

My first time ever making Lumpia, and boy this recipe did not disappoint.  The filling is absolutely seasoned just right and easily modified if you'd like more cilantro, carrot, or something else.  Rolling these little suckers did test my patience, but once I got the hang of the process it was smooth sailing.  Thanks for a great recipe that  I'll be making again.

This is absolutely authentic! Making the pork mixture was the easiest part for me.  From start to finish it took me  longer than what the recipe states.  I bought frozen lumpia sheets and I had to wait until they thawed and pulling them apart was quite difficult. I looked online and found keeping a damp napkin on the lumpia sheets as you rolled kept the sheets from drying/hardening on the edges through out.

Made mine with 50/50 turkey meat and 90% lean ground meat. Turned out ok except the fact they have to cook low and slow if u mix and stuff all ingredients RAW as suggested per other reviews rendering them “greasy”. Will try to cook it again using “pre cooked meat” and “pre sautéed” veggies as recipe originally called for to see if that makes a difference. Other than that, great flavors!!!

I just came back from the philippines where I ate these alot. Good recipe, substituted egg roll wrappers due to availability. People talking about salty have to realize Filipino soy sauce has very minimal amount of salt so if you use salt in this recipe you need to have a very low salt soy sauce.

I don't think I've ever had them before, let alone make them. We're pretty rural here on the Central California coast, but I managed to find a Asian market for Lumpia wrappers. The rest was easy and frying  no time at all. Delicious.

I quadrupled the recipe to make it for an event and it turned out fantastic! My grandmother was in the Philippines so I couldn’t bother her for her recipe, but this came out extremely close. Nothing but raves on this recipe.

Very similar to how my Lola made lumpia while growing up in Cali. You can try different variations for the filling. One of my fave is ground beef with a cup of very small diced potatoes, in addition to the cabbage, carrots, etc. Serve w/white rice and store bought sweet & sour chili sauce..or, homemade vinegar sauce w garlic. Yum

this was pretty much spot on as far as flavor goes.  I grew up eating this, and this was the taste I remeber. The only thing I altered was the meat. I had a section of pork rump roast, so I cooked it in the slow cooker with all the seasonings; it was super tender and flavorful. Then I added the cabbage and carrots to the meat in a pan to cook them up together. The flavor was spot on.

If you are a novice to this type of cooking, I suggest you take a class. I believe when recipe says to put three heaping tablespoons of the mixture They really mean three heaping TEASPOONS.. I did not have lumpia wrappers, and elsewhere on the Internet I was shown that  Spring roll wrappers would work. However, the spring roll wrappers i used did not do very well. I should've known after rolling and being out of mixture at a count  of 13 that I had put too much in these. They exploded in the grease and made a horrible mess. I'll try again another time, after my wounds have been licked, and make sure I have authentic lumpier wrappers. I will definitely only put a generous tablespoon next time and use common sense.  The filling was tasty, though.  Good luck to you!

Have always loved lumpia but when the Asian supermarket I used to buy them from closed I figured I'd take a try at making them myself. Ran across this recipe and I'm so glad I did. Simple easy ingredients. Trying to roll them was tricky for me at first but once I got the hang of it, no problem. Followed as written. Keeper!

I had found a couple of recipes for lumpia here and saved them to my favorites.  I made the other one a couple of times since it was pork and shrimp, and today I accidentally grabbed this one before realizing it didn't have shrimp.  Decided to add shrimp to  it anyway, and these were fantastic!  Even my super picky son ate 2 or 3.  They were much more flavorful than the other recipe I had saved.   Thanks so much for sharing.

I found a recipe on another site to bake at 400*F for 15 minutes. I brushed sesame oil on the Lumpia before baking. I baked instead of fried so my husband can take to work. Fried doesn't taste very good cold. (I baked for 19 minutes - oven issues) I also had prepackaged coleslaw. Saves time.

this was delish. it took some getting used to when it came to wrapping. I'm used to egg rolls so my lumpia were a little thick in the beginning. but, the taste was there. I spoke to several who made these and was told if using ground pork NOT to fry it first so I didnt. it cooked great during the frying. easy enough to make and tasted great with my pancit!

I omit the additional salt and cabbage. I also mix all the ingredients raw and fill the lumpia.   This is the way I was taught by my daughters Filipino BFFs Mom.

I grew up making lumpia with family friends every year for thanks giving and Christmas.   We'd make a couple hundred at a time This recipe is very close to theirs except they did not cook the meat first.  the mix was made and put into the wrap raw, rolled up and then cooked by my friend's mom.

Delicious and just as I remembered from my childhood.  I used my food processor to shred the cabbage and carrots to get the pieces nice and small.  I used the slicer for the cabbage and the grader for the carrots.  Make sure your oil is hot enough so they are crisp and not soggy.  Will make again!

Hubby made these, the hardest part was finding the Lumpia dough to make it with. On the advice of the clerk at the Asian Marketplace. We used the Spring Rolls dough. Turned out pretty good. We'll use sweet onion next time as we thought the green onions dominated the taste. Made the homemade sweet n sour sauce which was a nice compliment to the rolls.

A word of advice...Use spring rolls! I found out the hard way that egg roll is not the same as spring roll!! Cooking the meat first, for me, made it harder to roll.

The only changes I made, were to add some diced celery and added a table spoon of sesame oil while stir frying the veggies.  It was awesome.  I made 60 total for Football Sunday...however with my family...they didn't make it past Saturday night.

Per suggestion I added adobo seasoning to the meat, and used thai sweet chili sauce for dipping. THIS WAS SO GOOD!!!!!! My boyfriend and I are both so impressed with it! Not too hard to make at all either! Would highly recommend!

Good basic recipe. Based on other reviews I increase the vegetable to meat ratio. I used a bag of coleslaw mix (cabbage and carrots) with a half cup of carrots, omitted the salt, and added light soy sauce to taste.  

Used Menlo brand wraps. Watching different rolling techniques on YouTube is a must! 

This recipe will be the basis of future Lumpia.

Made them. Followed the recipe exactly. Turned out great.  Only thing is I had to use egg roll wrappers, so mine had that bumpy  surface after frying, but that was fine. Wasn't worth a trip to the city just for lumpia/spring roll wrappers...  Really a great simple recipe that delivers.

Very good recipe, except I remember bean thread as one of the ingredients, so a added it to this recipe (~2 cups).  I cooked the bean thread in just after the step with the garlic/onions, and cut up some of the strands to make dividing/spreading easier.  I also added a bit of fish sauce to flavor the pork.  Rolling the lumpia took some getting use to.  The lumpia wrappers are round and thin.  I found 3 tablespoons was a little too much.  It also helped to start at one end and roll once, fold the ends, and roll the rest of the way.  I also a mix of rice flour and water to seal the edge.  I am very prone to burning things, and I have also found that using coconut oil helps.  After frying, I like to eat it with siracha sauce.  All around, great recipe!!!

Very similar to the recipe I grew up with. Very VERY tasty.

I actually made this twice and have made variations on it to accommodate various tastes. I made some vegetarian, some regular ones, and then in another batch I chopped up some Thai chilies for a spicy version, and those were TERRIFIC also.

The sauce I dip them in is usually just made with soy sauce, vinegar and chopped garlic.

I'll be making these for years to come.

I made this once when I was in college and had a picky room mate that inhaled them faster than I could cook them. Lost the recipe when I got married and moved, but found this one very close to the original. I only add  a little brown sugar to be more sweet and savory, also I leave out the garlic powder, if you want more of the garlic flavor, less cook time with onions or add in at the end, fresh is always better.

Excellent recipe. I used lean wild pig meat, homemade wrappers, omitted the garlic powder in favor of a couple of extra garlic cloves thrown in with the onions, and added cilantro as suggested in the video. It turned out great!

Loved this recipe! My husband used to live overseas & he's talked about lumpia off & on for years, so when I found this recipe & tried it he loved it. I doubled the batch without any problems & added some shredded parsnip to it. Needless to say they didn't last very long & we are defeinitely planning a repeat. This will become a common occurence at our dinner table.

Taste just like what my Filipino friends make. Just watch the temperature of the grease when you fry them so you don't over cook them.

Absolutely great.  As suggested, I added a teaspoon of Adobo seasoning to the meat and used 1/3 lb. of beef and 2/3 lb of pork.  I also added a half a cup of chopped mushrooms to the onions and garlic.  The lumpia turned out to be delicious.  I froze some for use later.  I think the cabbage could be doubled without problem and may even be better.

These were absolutely delicious, and tasted just like lumpia I tried at an ethnic food festival. Sometimes when I prepare Asian food it's blander than I would like, but these were richly flavored. I was prepared to use spring roll wrappers, but happily was able to find lumpia wrappers at my local Asian market. My only disappointment was that the amount of filling I had only filled about a dozen lumpia. I might double the filling amount next time, because it's a shame to let all those extra lumpia wrappers go to waste!

My husband and I really LOVE this recipe as is!  When I have the time, I place the filling mixture in the fridge for a few hours so the flavors can mix together.  This recipe is even great to make a few days before (without frying), freeze the egg rolls, and then fry them fresh! SO yummy!! Definitely a keeper-recipe! Thanks!!

I grew in a Filipino neighborhood and have always been such a huge fan of their lumpia.. never made them til now. I found it a lot easier than I thought it would be. Not to mention, TASTY!!!! Now the only issues I had are the size of the wrappers... I will cut them diagonally in half next time and also use egg yolk to make the wrapper stick shut. But the recipe itself was delicious!!!

Just what I'm looking for. I didn't add the garlic powder & still turned out right.

This was great. I doubled the recipe to make 60 but there wasnt enough filling. I used a little more then a pound of pork and a little more then a pound of beef. Grated the carrots and left out the salt. We used sweet chili sauce which was a perfect dip. We will make them again...and again.
