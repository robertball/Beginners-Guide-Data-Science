Delicious! I will be making these again for sure. I made 2 small changes, I didn't have any fresh tangerines so I used orange juice and orange extract in place of the tangerine juice and zest. Aside from that I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't do anything with the "basics" meaning the flour, sugar, baking powder...however, I didn't have tangerines but had a few blood oranges left that I wanted to use up.  I microwaved the cranberries and juice for about 90 seconds instead of simmering on the stove and then let them cool.  After everything was mixed in I on a whim threw in about 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips and omitted the sugar sprinkle on top.  Theses are amazing, just a little sweet and probably  because I added the chocolate.  Next time I would go with 3/4 cup sugar.

Just as an afterthought...I might also reduce the temp to 350 for myself.  375 browned them quite quickly and the inside wasn't quite ready.

Absolutely delicious!! I modified the recipe slightly. I used 1 cup of the leftover homemade cranberry sauce from thanksgiving and added about of 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed tangerine juice with pulp. We have our own tangerine tree and they’re oh so sweet and juicy! I microwaved the cranberry sauce with the tangerine juice & the pulp until bubbly. Boy, I’m a master chef but everyone agreed these were the best cupcakes I have ever made!

This was great! I used regular oranges just because I didn't have tangerines on hand.  I would like to use them next time.  I also only used one tablespoon of orange zest.  I wish I had used 2 tablespoons as written in the recipe. It was lacking a bit of the orange flavor. I baked at 350 degrees on convection setting for 25 minutes and came out perfect. I was able to fill 12 regular sized muffin tins and 12 mini muffin tins.

What a great tasting , simple recipe. I used fresh whole cranberries, simm ered in the tangerine juice.  Also adding 1/4 tsp of rum extract to the batter. Lastly, for a crispy top, before baking, I sprinkled raw sugar over the tops.

The bottom of the muffin burned when baked at 375 degrees for 15 minutes. I used half whole wheat flour and half unbleached flour. I added 1 tsp of vanilla. Also topped with streusel topping with chopped toasted walnuts for added flavor.

I made this recipe today. Excellent, baked at 350° for recommended time, broiler for 2 min to brown tops. Added one tangerine chopped to juice and cranberries while simmering, wonderful texture. Highly recommend.

These are absolutely delicious!   Used orange juice (hand squeezed) and it was fine.  375 degrees for 25 minutes worked fine for me.

My son brought us a crate of tangarines yesterday, looked up recipes and found this, will make some tomorrow and let you know how I get on.
Cheers Stevie and all reviews for giving me inspiration.
Dang, don't have dried cranberries, can I use frozen ones, or raisins?

What a happy accident - bought ruby grapefruit instead but decided to use it anyway. boiled the juice down w/honey to taste which will tone down the bitter bite. Use only the berries in the batter & keep the reduce juice as a syrup when serving instead of sugaring the muffin top. added some crushed pecan nuts - optional. Great basic recipe. simple & delicious. I especially liked boiling down the dried berries with the juice. Nice touch - a big thanks of appreciation for sharing!
