My husband and I were pleasantly pleased with this recipe. I did like some other reviewers suggested and used half mayo half sour cream, because it seemed like a lot of sour cream to me. I also used half the lemon juice called for and added some relish for sweetness. The relish helped to balance the sourness. As the grapes weren't looking very good in the grocery store I used a green apple instead, and it complemented the ham just as well as the grapes would have. Very tasty and a nice change.

The author of this recipe is right: the flavors are very nicely complementary. I have made it several times now. I have come to toast the almonds, which strengthens their taste and allows you to use less, as well as adding a haunting new layer of flavor. I also have used yogurt cheese instead of sour cream, but if you do that you should reduce the amount of lemon juice, or the dish will be too tart.

Great recipe, I threw in some curry powder maybe 1/2-1 tsp. to give it a little extra zip.  Served it with pitas.

I didn't like the flavor of the sour cream with the other ingredients. This recipe would have been great with mayonaise or miracle whip.

We added bagged coleslaw mix to stretch the recipe for our large family, and used turkey ham as we don't eat pork. Also added a bit of curry powder and sweet relish as per other reviewer's suggestions- delicious! Thanks for a great basic recipe!

It was very sour. The other reviews say to add mayo. Now I know why. The lemon and sour cream make a very tart salad. My husband and I hated it. I threw it away.

I used half sour cream and half mayo with this recipe. I don't like nuts or grapes with my savory dishes, so I left them out. I did, however, add a chopped kosher pickle for some crunch, garlic and onion powders and Vermont cheddar cheese. The yellow mustard added a nice flavor along with the green onion. This was great on the pita bread. Thanks Denise!

I am rating this recipe based on some changes (half light mayo half light sour cream, toasting the almonds, adding toasted sunflower seeds, substituting some cilantro and celery for the green onion because that's what I had on hand), but I think it turned out really well!  The flavors balance nicely and though I was a bit skeptical about the grapes, they are delicious!  I'll definitely make this one again.

My husband was skeptical about this recipe.  He has asked me to make some ham salad with our leftover Christmas ham, but when he read the recipe he wasn't conviced.  I made this as well as the normal mayo, pickle, etc. ham salad.  He like this one better after all.  My daughter also ate this very well and it went great with pitas.  I did use 1/2 the sour cream and lemon and I am glad I did, it wouldn't have suited our tastebuds as well if it were much more sour.

Great recipe!  It was the perfect ending to the leftover Christmas ham.  I made it twice, but the second time, I put the ham in a food processor.  This made the perfect texture and it really mixed well.  My too little boys loved it which is saying alot.

I used canned chicken instead and loved it. Its great cold-easy to fix and is a good idea for lunches when you are tired of the same old same old. Grapes remind me of Arbys Chicken salad sandwich -  is soooo goood.
think i will try on toast too. Maybe some lettuce would be ok? I dont like onions that much so i didnt add thoses either.

This recipe was okay.....the best thing about it is how quick and easy it is to prepare, which really helps on busy nights.  My husband didn't like it, I thought it was okay, and my oldest daughter liked it a lot.  I used half sour cream and half mayo, spicy brown mustard as well as the yellow, and some sweet relish.  I just don't think that I'm a ham salad fan, so the recipe itself isn't bad, just not my thing.

I did cut the sour cream in half and mixed it with mayo.  I wasn't sure from the recipe if the ham should be diced or ground up. I had a ham steak and I decided to grind it up in my food processor.  It made a tasty sandwich.

Pineapple works brilliantly instead of grapes!
