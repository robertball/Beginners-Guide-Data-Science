Absolutely wonderful!  One of the best recipes I've made from this site.  I used the entire pack of Knorr's (1.8 oz) but wonder if 1/2 a pack would be enough?  I had some extra filling (3/4 cup) that I justed baked in a small casserole.  It held fine.  I really liked the flaky taste of the crust the day I baked the tart, but the next day I really couldn't taste the crust.  I would probably leave the crust out unless making it for company.  Save some calories and some $$.  Definitely not an inexpensive dish!

LOVED IT!  I served this to 7 different people and they all loved it!  The only change I made was I substituted Top the Tator Sour Cream and I added chopped green onions too.  Great Recipe, Thank-you.

Great recipe!  I cut some of the fat by using skim evaporated milk and/or skim sour cream and I still got great results.  The leek soup mix adds tremendous flavor, as does the monterey jack cheese with bits of peppers.

Wow!! Everything about this was wonderful, the flavor... the texture... everything!! I made one as a test before making another for an Easter appetizer. It was the first thing gone and everyone wanted the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I am just getting ready to make two more, I can't wait!!

This was a big hit at Christmas Eve dinner this year - I served a small slice on a pool of Bechamel sauce (http://pasta.allrecipes.com/az/BechamelSauce.asp), with some cheddar cheese thrown in for color, as a first course.  It was well-received and made good leftovers, too.  In the interest of time, I used a frozen deep-dish pie shell (Pet-Ritz), and I found that I had about 1/2 to 3/4c. too much filling after filling the shell to the brim.  Although the recipe is vague, the only leek soup mix packets I could find in the supermarket were by Knorr, so that is what I used.

The texture was good, but the flavor needed an extra something--perhaps a bit of hot sauce or chili flakes. Besides the obvious flavor of onion, this pie was a bit bland. If I make this recipe again, I will take the other reviewer's advice and try Monterey Pepper Jack Cheese for a little extra kick.

This is hands down the best recipe I have made off of this site!  I used about a half lb of spicy pork sausage and pepper jack cheese.  Has a very good complex flavor and was easy to make, presentation was excellent.  The guys especially liked it.

Made exactly as written. Very easy to make, yet is very impressive to serve!  I served this as side dish, as it is very light.  Perfect!

Perfect - followed recipe exactly.  Is very rich but small slices make a wonderful side dish.   Could be a main dish if served with a salad.   Would also be great for a brunch.

+++ This is my new favorite!  From the advice of others saying there was a little too much, I added another egg and more cheese and split it b/t two crusts.  Also, I have to agree that the store bought crust pales in comparison to a homemade one, but suit yourself.  I still give it my highest compliments to the combination of taste, flavor and texture.  One other note:  I would recommend cutting the onion through the stem, laying it flat, and slicing it that way.

Everyone loved this! I made it without the crust and put 2 cups of cheese in it to make sure it held together nicely.  Very good!

Great basic receipe.  To make it a bit more filling I added 1 lb of sausage.  My two teenage sons actually loved this, I was suprised.  They asked that I make it again for Christmas.  Looks like we might have an annual thing here.

I made this for a party, but I lost my evaporated milk and used cream, I added bacon, and I substituted gryere for M. Jack...I also did it in individual tart shells...it was a big hit and I was asked for the recipe...very versatile, I would make it again...I think the leek soup mix makes a big difference, nice touch.

So delicious.  I followed the recipe except made it "light" by using skim evaporated milk, egg whites, light sour cream. I also added a packet of onion soup mix and a dash or 2 of crushed red peppers to give it some zip. It was to die for.

This recipe was fun to make for me..I did tho..saute thinly sliced potatoes to put on the bottom of the pie crust..then filled with the filling ..its a texture thing for me..instead montery Jack cheese(cant get it in Zanzibar) I used mozzerella only on the top.Browned so beautifully.Also I had to use yogurt instad of sour cream(cant get that here either)Off it went to a full on Italian gathering,and everyone loved loved loved it!Aaah perfection!

I thought this was good. It is a simple onion tart. I agree w/ others- good as a side dish. I wish I had put something else in it- maybe mushrooms? I think it'd be good with steak.

Ok, this is so good!  Like another person suggested, you can cut down on the Knorr seasoning a bit, maybe even using just half a package.  Aside from that, this tart is so easy and so incredibly yummy whether you make your own crust or not!

Very nice compliment dish! I made it exactly according to the directions. I was glad I used a whopper onion because the flavor was just right. I'm allll for a short cut, but I won't use a store purchased crust again. It was probably the weakest part of the recipe. Good flavor, and we enjoyed it.

This was incredible. Made more than would fit in a standard pie shell, so I baked the extra without crust and it was still awesome. Subbed fat-free evaporated milk and nonfat greek yogurt for the sour cream to lighten it up a little. Might use less soup mix next time to ease up on the salt. All in all, though, totally delicious.

Flawless. I don't know about that yielding 8 portions, because I ate about half of it in one sitting :) and the rest disappeared just as fast. Delicate texture, nice caramelized onion taste, perfect balance of ingredients, and not too many of those - which helps with the planning, even though I am not a fan of evaporated milk...  Just a perfect vegetarian dish.

I like this a lot, but it is very rich. I ate the leftovers cold for lunch the next day, and I thought it had a very clean taste when cold. Am curious as to how it would turn out topped with cheese for a little extra texture variation.

Beautiful.  I have made this many times and each time they are great.  I've used yellow onions but the sweet vidalia does turn out nicer.

This was very good.  I used refrig. biscuit dough instead and I didn't have any sour cream so I used part cream cheese and part mayo and it turned out great.  I had to beg my husband to try it, but he loved it.

Absolutely LOVE this!  Every time I ask my husband what kind of quiche he wants me to make, this is the one he requests time and time again!  The flavor is heavenly.  The only change I made was to cut the onion amount in half because we eat this for breakfast!  I even bring a slice for lunch and all of my co-workers ask what smells so good.

Delicious!!  I did add mushrooms... will try zucchini and other veggies.   If you add veggies, you will be able to get two pies out of it.   A definite make again!

We made it just like the recipe & as suggested in the comments, added 5 green onions.  That is the only "change" we made.  It came out perfect, just like the photo.  It was light but filling.  I can't wait to make it for a Family Dinner where my vegetarian daughter and her husband are already anxious to try it.  Was surprised how good it tasted as there aren't spices added.  Guess that leak soup is the answer.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Love this tart!  It is easy to prepare and delicious . I used onion soup mix and taco blend cheese as they were available at my grocery store.  A favorite recipe!

I loved this. I think it might even be better with more onion, since they're cooked down before they're added to the filling. It browns beautifully, puffs up, and makes a really nice presentation. It would be great for a brunch.

This tart was so delish! I have 10 lbs of Vidalia onions so I will definitely be making this again and again in the coming weeks. It was so simple to make and I ate all the leftovers. I think it was even better the next day. Highly recommend!

This recipe was amazing. My partner and I used to order this tart every time we went on a cruise and now I can make it any time I want. 5 stars don't do this recipe justice. I substituted the evaporated milk with heavy whipping cream and it turned out great. Thanks most kindly.

Delicious!  I have made it a couple times and always get so many compliments on it.  I didn't change a thing.  The last time I made it I couldn't find Vidalia onions anywhere so I just used a sweet onion and it turned out fine.

This one is going to take some fiddling to come up with a tart to suit my taste.  I couldn't fink leek soup mix so I used a veggie soup mix.  It was way too salty, and the soup overpowered the caramelized onion.  I really like the idea of this tart so I'm not going to give up.  I'm going to try this again and omit the soup altogether and see what I get.

This was an OK quiche.  I didn't care for the odd flavor of the soup mix -- tasted (and was) artificial.  I have better quiche recipes.
