Used my own fresh Italian veggie sauce; no further changes. It was delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was really good. One tip though, try to get it sliced by a butcher, as it's easier to roll as it is thinner and more uniform.  Great flavor, tasted awesome

This is so simple, yet surprisingly good.  I used Panko instead of Italian breadcrumbs (because that's what I had), and replaced half with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  I also added freshly ground pepper to the mix.  I used fresh tomato basil sauce, and served it over fusilli.

I followed this recipe to the "T" and while it was perfect, it did not look like the picture!  Mine was more of sections, but the taste was great.  Very simple and quick for a busy evening dinner.

A nice, creative way to use steak. It took some time, since I made two pounds of steak, but the taste was well worth the effort :)

I plan on making Saturday for company with my homemade sauce. Sounds delish & easy to make. I will add chopped garlic, ital. bread crumbs, parmesan & provolone cheese's grated, S&P to taste. May even use baby spinach as suggested by a viewer. Thank you for this recipe.

Very good.  I will make my own stuffing next time, but the technique was helpful.  I will make this again,
