I followed the recipe very closely, but the results were somewhat disappointing.  Not reminiscent of any cake donut I've ever eaten.  I don't think I will be making this again, but thanks for posting your recipe.  Perhaps it will work for others.

We really like this recipe. I have a Nuwave air oven and it worked just as well as the air fryer works. I did not make holes in the donuts so they were more like very tasty biscuits. I do not have any notion that these are supposed to be like cake donuts. The dough is not like a cake batter would be.  We thought they were super and I will definitely be making these again.

we followed the recipe as close as possible but the dough was too sticky to use properly so we had to add about a cup and a half of flour, if not more. it was still a bit too sticky to work with even with all of the added flour.
they came out more like dense biscuits then donuts and were all-around disappointing.
we will not be using this recipe again, hopefully we can find a working recipe for actual air-fried donuts and not biscuits shaped like donuts.

Maybe the best donuts we’ve ever eaten! I’m so glad I didn’t let the negative reviews deter us... the texture, the flavor... so ridiculously delicious. Saving this to make for special occasions, we loved these so much!!! Thank you for the incredible recipe!

Not  even close to a donut. More like a scone.  I did like the cinnamon flavor.

The most unsuccessful recipe I have ever made. It was more like a biscuit than a donut, but the "biscuit" wasn't great either. I would not recommend.

Mine ended up more like biscuits. I shortened the time for the next batch so they weren’t do brown. Maybe they weren’t thick enough but I was disappointed.

This recipe was a complete waste of time.  The flavor was so lack luster.
