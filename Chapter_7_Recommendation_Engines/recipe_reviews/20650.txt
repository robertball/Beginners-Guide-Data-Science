Sorry but I can only give this 3 stars. I really wanted to give it more but this was not a hit at all last night at my party. I had 11 adults here and only 3 said they liked it. The problem was the curry powder. I even used less than half the amount of curry the recipe called for. Curry is just one of those ingredients where just just never know who will like it and who wont. I would suggest if you make this to leave out the curry.

The first time I made this I followed the directions to a "T". The second time, I modified it to reflect my family's taste and it was a huge hit. I added swiss cheese to the ham layer and provolone to the salami layer. Then, since we don't like curry, I mixed a 50/50 ration of goat cheese and cream cheese with a little garlic powder and onion flakes for the icing. It was awesome@!

I made this for a friend whos' diabetic, but happens to LOVE ham sandwiches! It was fun to make- I used mustard to write "Happy Birthday". People were a bit wary of it at first, but it ended up being pretty well recieved. There was a bit too much of the butter- be sure to spread it as thinly as possible. And next time, I'll spice up the cream cheese a bit. Will keep this one!

This recipe was a hit at a party I hosted recently.  No one had any idea it wasn't a real cake until we cut into it, and then my guests had a delicious surprise.  I had several requests for this recipe.

I loved it!!! My guests where a little surprised to find the *cake* tasting savoury. It looked beautyful and people thought it was a lemon cake!!The only change I made was that I used crushed up Pringles to decorate it instead of almonds. When it was cut it looked real pretty too!! Thank you so much for sharing!

smoked and boiled (lighter colour of the two) ham, mini salami stuck in the boiled ham cones, layed on cucumber slices, together with halved trees cut out from cheese slices (xmas shape), salami hearts in parmesan, small butterflies (green – from cucumber and yellow – from cheese slices with a little help from my daughter´s art set cutter) flying above one cherry tomatoe – not quite, actually they are pinned down with toothpicks... spread slightly white sandwich bread slices with cream cheese mixed with grated different kinds of cheese for individual layers, with or without ham or salami, depending on taste of the cheese... (adding tough of dijon mustard or minced garlic according to your – or the honoree´s – taste) sides spread with “the spread”, decorated with grated cheese, adding a row of cherry tomatoes around would look good, he just came too soon... you can be sure – if your honey is carnivorous - you take the cake!

This is more of a "concept" recipe, and it's a good one, especially if you're commemorating a birthday, anniversary, or graduation with a cocktail party instead of a more traditional sit-down dinner. I would use ham, bacon, and turkey and add thinly sliced vegetables, but it's a fun idea.
