This recipe is SO easy, versatile, and FAST. I’ve made them so often that I have this memorized! My husband loves these. I mix in 3½-4 cups of whatever he wants (even a ½ cup of Optimum Nutrition’s plain cooking whey to create ‘power’ bars) and a pinch of spice. He usually goes for nuts and raisins. I use a 15×10-inch jelly roll pan (JRP-a cookie sheet with edges) to create commercial-sized snack bars. (If you make this in a 9×13, consider dusting the pan with oat flour.) When I use a 17×15-inch JRP, I add an extra cup of oats. I oil the JRP pretty heavily to prevent sticking. I've skipped the butter and also used fat-free sweetened condensed milk successfully. Stir for about 4 minutes to dampen the dry ingredients. I use wax paper to press the mix to the edges and corners. When it comes out of the oven 20 minutes later, I immediately use a pizza wheel to cut the bars. Then I seal the JRP with tin foil and (very quickly) flip it onto the table and remove the JRP to cool. This creates a crisp bar that he can run with. We store them in zip lock snack bags—unless we’re traveling, then a gallon freezer bag works. I love the hint from BEVERLYS55 dated 1/15/2006 (put the unopened can of sweetened condensed milk in a bowl of hot water while you mix the dry stuff, open it and add the melted butter and it will be easier to mix). Thank you, Aliceyn, for contributing this recipe. My husband, his co-workers, and our friends appreciate it!

I don't actually want to rate my recipe, just offer some changes. This is the original recipe that I put in, but what I actually do is use 3 cups oats and 3-4 cups of mixed'whatever'. The more you experiment, the more you come up with your own preferred recipe. I've used Reeces' Pieces instead of choc. chips for a different flavour. Trail mix usually makes up at least 1 cup of my recipes.

On my first attempt to make these I used regular rolled oats instead of quick and they had a raw oat taste because the oats were too thick to cook in that amount of time, without burning the condensed milk. So on my second attempt, because I could see the potential, I doubled the recipe and poured it on to a jelly roll pan that was lined with a non-stick silpat mat. These little mats are so slick. Nothing sticks to them. My kids loved these chewy type of granola bars and they are truly easy to make in minutes. The hardest part is waiting for them to cool. I have used fat-free condensed milk also, but I think they taste better with the regular condensed milk.

This is so easy, and easy to make it as good-for-you as you want. I use freeze dried edama beans and soy nuts and any dried fruit I have around, and my husband loves it. Hint: put the unopend can of sweetened condensed milk in a bowl of hot water while you mix the dry stuff,open it and add the melted butter and it will be easier to mix.

These are fantastic.  I line  a 10'x15'  cookie sheet with parchment.  I omit the butter and use low fat condensed milk.  I reduced the coconut to 1/2 cup.  Deleted the choc chips.  Added raisins, cranraisins, dried papaya, peanuts, almonds, soy nuts, pumpkin seeds and some rice krispies.  I cut the recipe into 40 bars.  My family love them.  My husband suggested toasting the oatmeal a bit first.  I will try that
 next time.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I leave out the butter and use skim condensed milk and it turns out great.  This is a quick, easy, versatile recipe that has turned our house into granola bar-junkies. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good when you use flavored oatmeal.  I use about one cup (2 packages) of maple brown sugar flavored instant oatmeal and use two cups of the regular.  Of course, then I leave out some of the other ingredients and add other things like raisins.  I've also tried it with banana-flavored oatmeal, which was good.  Delicious.  My little brother loves them.  It's awesome because you can experiment with different flavors!

I had high hopes for this recipe -- I really love granola bars.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.

The flavor was good (although I probably would reduce the amount of chocolate chips), but texture was not.  The bottoms of the bars were slightly mushy.  (I think moisture formed at the bottom of the pan as they cooled. I'm not sure how to fix this problem, since the recipe said not to take bars out of pan until fully cooled.)  Would not make again.  :(

Unbelievable good! I enhanced the nutritional value by adding about 1/2 cup wheat germ. My kids loved them and I am going to use them for my daughter's "snack sharing" day at school. You can make all kinds of different mixes. today i made craisin, raisin and butterscotch chip bars.

I didn't want to worry about these bars spoiling (as butter can do in granola bars), so I substituted vegetable oil in place of the butter. I made no other changes. I honestly thought that this recipe wouldn't be as great as the reviews stated but I'll tell you, they turned out absolutely perfect. The kids had one each for lunch and are still telling me how good they are and begging for another. Next time, I'll play around with the add-in's to try to come up with another combination but the recipe as is is fabulous!

I followed this recipe pretty closely. I did take the advice of one person who said they added an egg. I had no problems at all with it crumbling - even just 10 minutes out of the oven - maybe it was the egg?? I also added vanilla and about 1/2 tsp of salt. We used dates (just a few), dried apricots, craisins, slivered almonds, sunflower seeds and about 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. I didn't try them cuz of a restricted diet, but my kiddos and hubby loved them. Hubby said he liked them better than store bought. I think I will try them with PB instead of butter next time. Oh - and my 9x13 batch made 15 bars that were just the same size as store bought. Wrapped in plastic wrap and froze for future lunches. Thanks for a good recipe! UPDATE - I make these about twice a week now. I use 4 cups oatmeal, 3 cups other stuff (usually choc chips, dried fruit, nuts), plus one egg and omit butter and add 1/2 cup pb. Tastes awesome - never falls apart. Because of added oatmeal making them thicker I cut the pan into 20 bars. Store in snack baggies. Yum! They freeze well too. With 4 c. oatmeal, 3 cups other stuff, add one egg and 1/2 cup PB - cutting into 20 bars - I went to a calorie calculator and they are approx 300 per bar. Keep that in mind when you make yours! They might be healthier than some in the stores but they aren't low-cal!

I LOVE this recipe!!  I have used it a ton and everyone is impressed with the healthy snack.  I skip the butter, they are fine without it, and use low fat condensed milk. I follow another reviewers suggestion of 3 cups of oats and 3 cups of whatever else you like, then I just chop or food process my nuts, add in coconut and craisins.  I use a 15 x 10" pan and I line it with parchment paper and the bars never stick. No need for cooking spray.  The tip to press with wax paper was inspired.  Works like a charm.  I have also crumbled the mixture onto a baking sheet and baked for 15 min. stirring every 5 to get a great granola to add to yogurt.

easy AND yummy granola bars. i liked the taste of sweetened condensed milk and butter, a nice change up from oil and honey. and the submitter was right, just use whichever mix-ins sound good! my first batch were cherry and chocolate, and i will try other combos in the future. i used parchment paper to line the bottom of the pan and they came out easily, and they cut easily while still warm. everyone loved these, great recipe!

Easy is right!  I never knew making homemade granola bars could be so easy and SO GOOD!  The only thing I didn't have on hand was almond slivers so I used chopped pecans instead.  My family LOVES them!  I won't be buying store bought granola bars ever again!  I like that it is so flexible and I can use whatever I have on hand too.  I can't wait to experiment!  My husband is a hunter and likes to pack granola bars in his pack to curb his hunger in the stand and that's what made me decide to try these.  They literally took 5 minutes (or less) to mix up.  My 2 toddlers loved them too.  I did follow the advice of a couple other reviewers and warm up the condensed milk before mixing and that worked really slick.  A 9 x 13 pan made 14 generous sized bars.   Thanks Aliceyn!  UPDATE:  Since I posted this I have made this using a jelly roll pan and the bars don't get as thick and it yields anywhere from 18-22 bars depending on how wide I cut them. Also, one day I had only 2 1/2 cups oatmeal so I substituted more coconut for the rest and will make them this way from now on!  We LOVE coconut and you definitely can taste the coconut this way!  Also, I have made these without the butter and they turn out just fine.  I won't be using butter in the future...the fewer calories the better.  I make this at least 2x a week now.  My family can't get enough of them!  I have used pecans and walnuts in place of almonds when I didn't have any on hand and that tasted good too!

This is an awesome recipe.  Some earlier reviewers had wondered whether you can use evaporated milk in place of the sweetened condensed.  You certainly can!  I made this with evaporated skim milk and without the butter (I added a couple tablespoons of sugar)and it turned out great.  Next time I'll add a few spices to give it some more flavor (I don't do coconut).

These were wonderful!!! I was reluctant at first because of the sweetened condensed milk, and not wanting to use so much sugar for the children, but let me tell you, the trade off was worth it. My 3 and 6 year old loved it and ate it all, asking for seconds. What a healthy treat. I used my homemade granola, which I usually make in large amounts, and contains oats, wheat germ, sesame seeds, raw cashews, peanuts and almonds, dried cherries, dates, and raisins, and used only half a cup of chocolate chips, another half of a cup I put on the bottom of the parchment lined pan, and melted in the oven prior to spreading in the granola. When done, I lifted out the parchment and let it cool on a cookie rack for about an hour, then cut into bars on the paper on a cutting board, and into the fridge to cool completely. The granola bars had a soid chocolate layer on the bottom, and crunchy gooey goodness on top! Wraped in wax paper aith kids stickers to hold closed - I will never send another store bought bar for snacks! Thanks!

I am super pleased with these!!! So easy; can't wait to try out different variations of cereal, nuts, dried fruits, candies, & try w/nonfat/lowfat condensed milk. I used: regular oats (not quick cook), ground flax, chopped pistachios & almonds, sunflower seed kernels, dried cranberry & blueberry craisins, raisins, Kashi crisp cereal, & coconut.  I 'chopped' the oats a bit since they were not quick cook -worked great.  I toasted the oats in the oven, then toasted the nuts, coconut, and flax too. Used 3 c oats & planned to use 3 c  other ingred but got carried away & it was closer to 3.5-4 c. Warmed milk in hot water before opening -great tip.  With the extra ingred, I did use 2 T. melted butter (Smart Balance - healthier) because the mix seemed a bit dry, otherwise I don't think it's needed.  Mixed in lg bowl & then used hands to mix better. Pressed down firmly, covered w wax paper & hammered w/ flat meat mallet. Removed wax paper, baked in a 16x11 pan lined with foil, which yielded 16 lg bars, maybe .5 in. thick. Baked 18-20 min, could have been less. Cooled 2 min in pan, cut into long rectangles with pizza cutter, cooled 10 more min, removed foil w/bars from pan, cooled completely on the foil. Great texture, delicious flavor w/customized ingred, and so much healthier! Next time I will try 6 c total ingred, add chocolate or M&M's & bake less to try for softer texture - these are chewy & firm (but not hard). Hold together beautifully. (They get firmer as they cool; cut warm).

Excellent recipe; I followed the ingredients list exactly as written.  Only small change I made wasn't a "recipe" change, I just didn't press the bar mixture all the way to the edges of the pan. I left about an inch border between the pan edges and the mixture. The bar mixture is solid enough that it holds it's shape while baking and doesn't spead itself out to the pan edges. When I do this, it avoids any of the bars having hard pan-border edges when they're cut. Also, just one other note. I reallly like all the variations of this versatile recipe, submitted by those who have tried it. However, I don't understand why some people are saying this recipe is no good when they changed the recipe to the point where it is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT recipe, then they give it one star.

Used dried apricots and blueberries and semi-sweet mini chocolate chips (the chocolate chips make this special).  They taste like the Kellogg's dark chocolate-almond bars you buy at the grocery store.  Watch the baking time, as you don't want these to overcook.  Absolutely delicious and EASY.

Instead of butter I added a large 1/2 cup of peanut butter which I "melted" in the microwave to thin down, added an extra cup of oats & some protein powder.  Warmed the condensed milk which was a great tip. To keep the mixture from sticking when spreading wet your hands and press down with fingers or palms and rewet as you go. I thought it would fill a 17x15 jelly roll pan but wasn't quite enough. 20 minutes was the max in my oven as the edges burned.  Used parchment to line my pan so wouldn't stick.  Cut in pan, covered with foil and flipped onto counter.  Just make sure you completely cool or they will crumble.

Such an easy and tasty recipe!   For my healthier batch I omit the chocolate chips and cranberries and add 1/2 c. Chopped dried apricots, 1/2 c. raisins, 1/2 c. chopped dates.  For a guiltier pleasure I substitute the butter with melted peanut butter, and subtitute the cranberries with 1/2 c. banana chips (broken into little pieces) and 1/4 tsp. salt. A tasty treat for sweet & salty fans like me!   Also, for those of you who find that these bars crumble too easily, I've found that you have to really press these into the pan. Try spraying a spatula with nonstick cooking spray and using it to firmly press the granola into the pan. Also, I never had any luck flipping the pan. I just wait until they are completely cooled in the pan before I cut them and that works for me.

I would give this a zero if I could. The sweetened condensed milk is the only saving grace of this recipe. First off, quick oats are not the best option. You would be much better off toasting slow oats and allowing them to cool before applying them in the recipe.  Second, these do need to be packed rather firmly in order for them to hold well and the end result is a very dense bar.   This recipe needs something to lighten the mixture considerably. Puffed rice would work or as I had mentioned, toasting the slow oats would work as well. Also, this recipe needs at least a half teaspoon of salt to balance the sweetness. Vanilla helps too.  These were just dense and raw tasting, and ultimately unpleasant.  I have NO idea how it has been rated so high thus far.

I really like this recipe and have made it many times now, because both my husband and I take them to work. The first time I had a hard time getting them out of the pan, so now I line my baking pan with wax paper. MUCH easier :-)   I also add 1/2 cup of flaxseed meal to make them a bit healthier.

I absolutely love love love this recipe! I made it today with a few changes though! I added 1 cup honey instead of the condensed milk and used regular vegatable oil instead of butter. I used the regular old fashioned rolled oats and I toasted the three cups in the oven for about 15 mins at 160C first. I added dried apricots, dried cranberries, pitted prunes and almonds. I just eye balled the measurements. The result was fab! My husband said " This is even better than the ones we buy at Whole Foods"....WOW! Thanks for sharing the recipe..

Absolutely DELICOUS!!!  Made recipe as close to original as possible with raisins as a substitution for the cranberries, 3/4 cup chocolate and only 1/4 cup almonds for that is all I had on hand. As mentioned by another reviewer, I did cut with a pizza cutter immediately after baking and covered pan in foil and was able to flip entire pan of bars over to cool.  Nice brown crispy bottom. Devoured one before they even cooled. Easy, delicous and will make again and again. YUMMMMMMM.

Probably one of my favorite things I have ever made!  They are definitely going to be a staple at our house now!    I used regular oats--not instant, and opted out of the cranberries, choc chips, and coconut.  I used almonds, dates and raisins--about 3.5 cups worth.  And I also used the skim condensed milk.  I cooked them on a Pam sprayed Silpat mat, and they didn't stick a bit.  I cut them within 5 minutes, but didn't take them out till completely cooled.  They turned out so hearty, chewy, sweet, and delicious!  This gets 6 stars in my book!

I've already made 4 batches of this stuff.  Every week I make it since I found it.  The first two times I found it a bit dry, I think you can totally ge carried away with adding stuff.  So what I did was I bought all my nuts and mixed them in a tupperware bowl I could keep for next time and measured out a cup of them, and the same with my fruit.  I also added a little less coconut in exchange for a 1/2 cup of protein powder.  And the other thing I had to do was use a smaller pan, as well as use 1/4 cup of honey to make them moist enough for my 2 year old to eat as well which made for a really nice chewy bar.  I've used both regular and light condensed milk with really not much of a taste difference probably because I do add 1/4 cup of honey to the mix.  My mom and I discovered you could make different kinds using just like pecans and almonds with apple pieces and cinnamon and using a butterscotch chip in replace of the regular chips.  This is a favorite in our house, and I have now the recipe down to a science without looking.  Thank you for sharing such a healthy snack for me and my family!

I did not have any nuts on hand, so I just used the shredded cocnut, and white chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips. I felt like the bars were a little bland, but the kids and I liked them and ate them. Next time I will add casheews to them. I also took somebody's advice and cooked for only twenty minutes rather than 25. But they were not crunchy enough for me. I envision granola bars being a little crunchy. I will work with this recipe and turn it into my perfect granola bar! Also I lined the pan with parchment paper. Worked great!!

Yet another rave review...Rave! Rave! Rave! I have never been able to eat granola bars before due to nut allergy, but now I make my own so easily! The pickiest husband in the world gives them two thumbs up and takes one for breakfast every morning. Use parchment paper (not wax paper) and they don't stick at all.

I will never buy store-bought granola bars again!  My husband and I love trail mix so raisins, peanuts and mini M&M's were the perfect combo.  I added 1/3 cup wheat germ for added texture/crunch.  Yum!

This is a great recipe as-is, absolutely no adjustments needed. The oats/condensed milk/butter/coconut base is great for experimenting; I add all sorts of various dried fruits, nuts, and sweets. My favorite is cranberries, macadamia nuts, and white chocolate.

In my biased opinion (as a fan of many types of boxed granola bars--NOT a fan of all the junk they put in it), I found this to be the best I've tried so far...and I've tried a LOT of recipes for granola bars from this site!  The consistency was exactly right once cooled.  They hold their shape, not too crumbly, slightly chewy, perfect amount of sweetness.  As long as I've got oats and sweetened condensed milk in the pantry, I have no need to pay through the nose for a box at the store!!  Thanks for sharing!

I make these often for my 5 children. I use regular oats and combinations we have enjoyed are: 
almond/blueberry/white chip/vanilla extract, cherry/dk choc/pecan, 
peanut/heath bits/peanut butter instead of the butter
walnut/pecan/cinn chips/raisins/cinnamon
Perfect recipe! Cut right away and let cool before removing.

AMAZING.  I used karo instead of sweetened condensed milk, and also used pecans. I had the nifty idea of using muffin tins, and they work out just as well, and store better too.

The only change I would make is to bake on parchment paper or aluminum foil since I found it took a lot of patience to get the bars off the pan, and I greased it really well.

This is a very good recipe--not exactly what I was looking for, but very good.  Chewy, held together well once cooled, came out of pan nicely, good flavor.  I didn't have all the add-ins listed, instead I used chocolate chips, raisins, and a few chopped walnuts.  Also added in some flax seed meal for nutrition's sake.  They are very sweet, but the kids loved 'em and they thought they were getting cookies instead of (halfway) heathly food.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. Used the rest of a trail mix I had (cheerios, raisins, granola, pretzels (crushed), m&m's, peanut butter chips)my 5 kids loved them. Will definately take them on our camping trip. SO EASY!!! Wasn't sure if consistency was right, but was perfect after letting them sit in fridge for about 30 min.

LOVED THESE!!  A very easy recipe for kids, and so adaptable!!  I love use-what-you-have recipes, and this is certainly a good one for that!  (I substituted raisins and miniature M&M's, yummy!)  Yes, even though they're delicious warm they really need to cool to firm up - we ate some out of the oven with spoons though as we just couldn't help ourselves!!  Thank you.

nice, i like that's it's quick and customisable. I used ground up hazelnuts instead of sliced almonds. I also like that it's got lots of oats. I used rolled oats instead of quick cooking. A keeper. Hazelnuts and apricots come to mind, as does white chocolate chips and cranberries. Lots of possibilities. (I just noticed, reading other people's reviews, that I forgot to add the butter to the recipe! oh well, it was nice anyway!!)
* * *
Made it a second time, used 1 cup almond meal in lieu of sliced almonds, dessicated coconut in lieu of flaked coconut, 2 tbsp rice bran oil in lieu of butter, and added one egg white (just because I had it on hand) and it turned out beautifully! I absolutely love this recipe. I have a healthier one with yoghurt and honey instead of sweetened condensed milk, but I love that this one is so delicious, versatile, and QUICK!!! Thanks again!

These are great, and super easy. I make them healthier by doubling the recipe, and use 1 1/4 cups of Almond butter instead of the second can of condensed milk. Per recipe I also sub 3 tbsp canola oil for the melted butter, use pumpkin seeds in place of the coconut, up the cranberries to 1 cup, omit the choc chips and add 1/3 cup of flax seeds and 1/3 cup of whey protein powder. (These substitutions are per recipe. Double them if you are doubling the batch like I do.) Super healthy and high in protein and Omega 3's...nothing bad in there except the condensed milk, and one can divided between 2 pans of bars is pretty minimal saturated fat. I freeze one of the pans (cut into bars, layer between wax paper in an airtight container). Awesome grab and go breakfast with some fruit (even my breakfast-hating husband will eat one of these every morning on his way to work), or a great post-workout snack.

I just took these out of the oven a hour ago....used parchment, not greased and they did not stick at all.  Used a 9 x 13 pan..thought they would be too thin with the 10 x 15 pan.  At first they were crumbly when i started to cut them but when I let them sit about 20 mins they firmed up and I was able to make squares easily.  I should have cut the peanuts up and should have cut the cranberries (trader joes) up as alot of them kept falling out...otherwise the recipe is very good..thanks

OH MY GOODNESS, SOO GOOD! No, really. . I would give these 10 stars if I could. So simple, so delicious, so many options. I'll be making these again and again. . .

After mixing the first 3 "base" ingredients, I added a dash or two of cinnamon and salt, 1/2 cup toasted coconut, 1 cup toasted sliced almonds, 1/2 cup pecans, and 1/2 cup craisins. But, again, as long as you have the first 3 ingredients, the rest of the recipe is very forgiving and flexible. . . thrown in a few cups of whatever you like! 

Next, for my mix-ins, I'll try a little pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, toasted pecans, and perhaps butterscotch chips. 

Thanks for such an amazing recipe!

I love this recipe. I use this site all the time and never leave a comment but I had to post and say how yummy these were. If you're looking for a healthy granola bar recipe this isn't for you. But if you're looking for a recipe that tastes like what you buy at a store this is it. I made a substitute for the sweetened condensed milk using 2 eggs, 2 tbsp flour, 1 c. Brown sugar,1/2 tsp. Of baking powder, and smoothly salt. Sooooo much cheaper than buying the real thing. After the bars cooled I made a thick powder sugar icing and drizzled it on top. Yummy!

Great texture and flavor. Followed other suggestion of 3c oats and 4 c of whatever. It worked perfectly. I added craisins, chopped nuts and choc chips. I'm getting ready to make them again and I'm going to try peanut butter and mini choc chips. The tin foil flipping suggestion worked great also.

These work great!  I read the reviews and used greased parchment paper in a jellyroll pan.  I cut them as soon as they came out and covered with foil, flipped them over on a cooling rack right away.  I have made them with many different ingredients and they're always great!  Just keep to about 3 cups oatmeal and about 3 cups add-ins.  
This would be a good recipe for those who have nut allergies with coconut, chocolate and dried fruit!

These are pretty good. I added seedless raisens rather than cranberries because of the cost, and couldnt find anything other than organic chocolate drops so used smashed up plain cooking chocolate pieces. I also missed out coconut because I can't stand the stuff! They're really moreish and my daughter loves them. We will be taking them camping with us on Saturday.

I just wanted to add to the reviews that I have made this recipe into granola to serve with vanilla yogurt as well.  I just bake as directed and stir after the 20 min, then bake and stir in 5 min intervals till it all looks golden.  After baking a spread it all out on tin foil and break up into small pieces and let it cool.  This is a great recipe!

I found this recipe a few months ago, printed it up and have been making it quite frequently.  I lost my print out, and came back for another copy!  I would be lost without this recipe.  It turns out perfect every time, with all the different varieties I have done!  The 2 recipes that are requested the most are a mix of 1 c raisins, 1 c sunflower seeds, 1 c coconut and 2 c of mixed dried fruit, 1 c sunflower seeds, 1 c coconut.  Thank you so much for contributing this recipe Aliceyn!  My family and I greatly appreciate it.

Very easy and yummy.  Have made this several times and have made the following alterations to my liking.  I use old-fashioned oats or a mix of old-fashioned and quick cooking.  Also use whole almonds.  Makes for a heartier bar.  The whole almonds are definitely harder to cut, but worth it.  Easiest prep I have found for this is to line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper, dump in the stuff, cover with a sheet of waxed paper, and roll with a rolling pin.  When done baking, slide them off the pan (while still hot and on the parchment paper), cut with a pizza cutter (while still hot).

I make these all the time. My family LOVES them! I usually substitute peanut butter for the butter and change up the add-ins. Basically 3 cups oatmeal, can sweetened condensed milk, 2-3 tbsp peanut butter (or butter) and 3 cups whatever else sounds good! Our favorite is mini chocolate chips, coconut, craisins and macadamia nuts. :) My husband says they taste like the expensive, all natural granola bars only better (and cheaper!).

This recipe is so versatile. I used 3 Cups quick oats to 3 1/2 Cs of chopped pecans, dried cherries and one entire large 8 ounce bar Lindt 90% cocao. The 90% cocao kept the sweetness of it down while the cherries added just enough. I baked them for 27 minutes, took them out, cut them into bars and let them cool completely. They were perfect!!

For second batch I used 14 ounces of Karo syrup instead of the sweetened condensed milk. Then I added 2 cups raisins, 1 cups finely chopped becans and about 1/4 cinnaman and a tsp. of salt. I baked it the same way, cut them into bars and then let the cool. Again, very awesome.

Oh, one more tip. I lined my 9x13 pans with parchment paper first. The bars came out like a dream both times.

Thanks for sharing this great recipe. I can't wait to try another combination. I'm thinking peanut butter and chocolate chips with salted peanuts. Mmmmmm

My husband loves these, he's been taking a couple in his lunch box the last few days. I used a jelly roll pan and found the bars to be the perfect thickness that way. I also recommend following the suggestions of the most helpful reviewer, I did...and had no problems with a soggy bottom crust. I added raisins into the mix as well as the cranberries. Very good, moist and chewy. I'm storing mine in the fridge in a plastic container and on day 4 they are still moist and fresh tasting.

Just made 2 versions of this. I made it "as is" and also made it substituting 1/2 of the almonds with sunflower seeds and 1/2 of the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips. The second version is my favorite.
I saw in other reviews that theirs came out soggy. I suspect that they may have used evaporated milk instead of condensed milk. There is a big difference in volume and consistency that might explain why theirs did not turn out.
I will be making this and will continue to substitute. This is by far one of the easiest.

I replaced the melted butter with peanut butter, reduced the flaked coconut to 1/2 c and increased the choc chips by 1/2 cup to compensate.  I also did not use 1.5 c of nuts/fruit but substituted with rice krispies which worked well.  Totally a versatile recipe if you bear the general proportions in mind :)

This is exactly the type of granola bar recipe I have been searching for! I followed the recipe but added a few more ingredients -- 1/2 c. wheat germ, 1/4 c. flaxseed, 1/2 c sunflower seeds, 1 c Craisins, 1/2 c raisins, 1/2 c shredded coconut and a 1/2 c mini chocolate chips... my boys LOVED them. This will definitely be my go-to recipe from now on. SO happy about the money I will be saving, not to mention knowing exactly what I'm feeding my kids! Thanks!

i was really looking forward to making this, especially because of the high rating and reviews. But unfortunately it did not come out the way i hoped for.  The bars did not stick together--i had to cook them an extra 10 minutes. The bottom was really moist. I think this was partly on my fault because i added the "3 cups of whatever" that had some moisture in it. i will be trying this again with drier ingredients though. thanks for the recipe! God Bless! __Alexus

Sooo tasty, and really easy to put together. I don't think it's possible to screw this recipe up!! With a base of oats coconut and sweetened condensed milk you can customize these granola bars to suit any taste preferences. I added 1/2 cup of 100% bran and 1/4 cup of ground flax seeds to my granola bars and they are delish! Great recipe!!!

These bars were great! SOOO easy and versatile! I toasted the almonds and coconut and put peanut butter in place of the butter. Took them camping last weekend, and they were a hit! Thank you for awesome recipe :)

I love how easy it is to change the ingredients in this recipe to suit your mood.  I've used mini m & m's and mini marshmallows for a sweeter treat, and sometimes substitute dried cherries for the cranberries.  Thanks for such a yummy, easy to follow recipe.

Great filling healthy bar. I made with fat-free condensed milk and have changed the ingredients many times. It is fun to see what you can create and such a nice option to have on hand. I like my bars a little crunchy so I bake them a little longer and put them in a cookies sheet pan 11x15. I baked them on parchment paper for 25 minutes. When they came out of the oven I slid them off the pan, let them cool on the parchment paper 5 minutes and then cut with my pizza cutter and let them cool. WI cut these into 36 bars. When cool, I wrap 2 bars in plastic wrap and put them in a sealed bag. I can then have them convenient to grab and not eat the whole pan as they are so good but they are so filling you don't need anymore than 2 bars at a time.  Easy and fun recipe.

OMG! This recipe was a hit with my husband. He LOVED them! I added dried cherries instead of cranberries and used fat free condensed milk but they turned out great! Very easy to make, very tasty, will make again. The chocolate and cherries were very good together. Thanks for sharing!

This was very simple and very good, I don't like coconut so I substituted 1/2 cup sunflower seeds and 1/2 cup chow mein noodles! I used dried bing cherries instead of cranberries. I took them to work and they disappeared!!  Everyone wants this recipe! They held together fine, not much crumbling & I did line the pan with parchment paper.  I will do less chocolate & more fruit next time.

Wow! Easy and so many options to try. I read all the reviews and and made mine with all of them in mind.I stirred the mix for 4 minutes. I used the Jelly Roll pan with parchment paper and coconut oil on the bottom, and then I pressed down the granola firmly with wax paper. I coverd the finished granola with foil for easy flipping. I used the pizza wheel after 5 minutes, and it worked beautifully! I pretty much stuck to the recipe except I added the one extra cup of oatmeal(old Fashioned). I used 1 cup of chocolate chunks, and 1/2 cup of dried cherries. I also warmed the condensed milk. Thanks to all of your reviews! They all helped. My bars tasted GREAT! This recipe will be a staple!

this was way easy and adapatable and yummy! okay, maybe it's not a healthy granola bar exactly but I don't eat granola bars for the health anyway :) I added Goji berries, ground hazelnuts and walnuts and used regular chocolate chips - the goji berries gave them a festive holiday look for the party I went to (cranberries would work the same) and they were gobbled up faster than the chocolate chip cookies on the table. Thanks - I'll use this one over and over again!

Made these for my daughter's volleyball team and they went crazy for them!  I used parchment paper on a jelly roll pan and had no problem getting them out.  Also used this as an opportunity to finish up all the half empty bags of granola in our snack drawer...put in about 2 cups of it.  My daughter did comment however, that she'd prefer fewer chocolate chips (I'd used 1 cup), as we don't really love the combination of dried fruit and chocolate.  I'll experiment more next time...and there will be a next time!

i didnt have condensed milk on me..so i combined a can of evaporated milk and 1 1/4 cups of sugar in a saucepan and simmered it until the sugar was dissolved. it took almost an hour to bake the bars and they came out a little too sweet

This recipe is GREAT, I will be using it regularly.  I used coconut, craisins, and chocolate chips, they are much better than any store bought variety!  I let them cook for only 20 minutes, so they would still be chewy.  Could not believe how sweet they turned out to be (though not too sweet), with no sweeteners other than the sweetened condensed milk.

I don't know if it is just me but after eating a couple of 1 inch by 1 inch portions of these, I start to feel nauseaus (sp?).  I'm not lactose intolerate, though I have a very mild allergy to dairy but I eat cheese everyday and not go through this.  I think it's a little too sweet for my taste and way too moist.

Super easy!  3 cups of oatmeal, 3 cups of various mix-ins (craisins, choc chips, nuts, etc) and a can of sweetened condensed milk.  I skip the butter and use fat free milk.  Comes out great everytime.

My kids gobble these up! I leave out the fruit and nuts (for now) and add 1/2 a cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup flax seed meal or wheat germ. Another variations: I add 1/2 cup cocoa powder instead of the peanut butter and mix in half a bag of peanut butter chips. After baking I slice into bars with a pizza cutter while they are still in the pan. Once they cool for 15 minutes or so I take them out of the pan and I have perfect litte bars.

I use this recipe all the time, or at least the general idea of it. I always change the ingredients, just keep the same proportions. 

I always sub out the butter for extra virgin coconut oil - and if you aren't aware of the benefits of coconut oil you really should look it up. Its great. :)   I sub in things like chia seeds, hemp hearts, quinoa puffs, ground flax. Sub in organic agave nectar instead of sugar.

I use a baking sheet with a lip and line with parchment paper. A regular sized sheet will fit two batches nicely. I press the mix into the pan until firm and smooth. I bake until the top starts to turn golden and then when I take it out of the oven I slide the parchment and granola out of the pan and leave it to cool on the stove top (glass top) I find the key to getting good shape is to gently and quickly cut the granola while it sits warm and then leave it to cool completely before running the knife through again to cut them apart.

This was ok but waay too sweet for me. I made with frozen blueberries, and one chopped apple omitted the chocolate chips and coconut, and it was still too sweet I can only imagine how it would have turned out if I had added the choc. chips or even raisins or dried fruit..shudder. Next time I will try to make my own condensed milk so I can add less sugar but written as is, I had to give it 3 stars only, sorry.

These granola bars were delicious! They are very sweet so if you aren't looking for a really sweet bar don't use this. I lined my pan with wax paper, and the result was a disaster! The was paper melted into the bars and was really hard to get off. The granola bars themselves were amazing and I think you could put anything in them. I also used peanut butter instead of butter and I think they tasted better. Good recipe!

Thank you for this awesome recipe!  They are delicious!  This is definitely what my daughter's soccer team is getting for after game snacks the next time it's our turn!  Those of you who are having trouble with them being too wet or not sticking together, make sure you're using sweetened condensed milk like the recipe calls for and not evaporated milk.

I love this!!! It didn't come out sticky like some recipes but also came out chewy like I like it. Nice gentle sweet taste and easy to make. Would be great made just as recipe indicates but I played around to get some more protein. This is what I did:
only use 1/2 coconut
no almonds (didn't have any)
1/2 carob chips instead of chocolate chips
added 1/2 cup wheat germ
added 2 scoops vanilla whey protein powder.
Yummy! Again this is just what I did to play around to get more protein. The original recipe is just as tasty.

I loved this recipe...it is truly flexible. Basically, I did 4 cups of quick oats and 3 cups of everything I found in the pantry...chocolate chips, trail mix, some puffed rice, some rice crispies and some sliced almonds. When I took cookie sheet out of oven, I cut it with pizza knife, immediatly sealed it with foil and flipped it to cool. Perfect! Thanks for the tips...we allllll love this recipe in our home!

Awesome recipe!   Highly recommended.  Quick, easy, delicious and nuturious!   I could eat the whole pan!  I make in a 9 x 13 dish, sprayed with cooking spray.  I make the recipe exactly as written except add in my favorite add ins.  My favorite combination is 1 cup sunflower seeds, 1 cup craisins, 1 cup of coconut.

I spend a small fortune on granola bars and have been looking for a good recipe that my kids will like and will not crumble everywhere and make a mess.  I have tried tons of recipes and this is the first one that I will make again.  These were great!  They are very versatile.  They stayed together, were a nice chewy texture, and my kids loved them.

My family LOVES these bars.  I've even made them for the office and they get rave reviews.  I use fat-free evaporated milk to bring down the fat content.  They're delicious and super easy to make.

My husband and I LIVED off these for the first few weeks after our baby was born. We were so tired we didn't have time to cook. I found time to make a quick pan of these and ate them every day. We don't care for coconut, so I left that out and added Wheat Germ. These are pretty healthy and they taste better than store bought in my opinion. My husband wanted me to smother them in chocolate (which I could have done), but that would have defeated my goal of having a "healthy" treat.

honestly, I have not tired these yet (had some of the raw "batter")... I am in the process of baking them, but it 10:30pm and I have to wake up at 6:00am.  I really look forward to trying these, but I found this recipe under healthy treats.  There is no way these are healthy unless you cut and add a bunch of different stuff.  They were extremely easy to make, which I loved!  I look forward to these.  Thank you for the idea!

These were really good, it was nice having a recipe without corn syrup. These are so versatile with what you can use as ingredients. For an extra health kick I always add some wheat germ and ground flax and you'd be none the wiser. Another modification I did was to use 2 1/2 cups of oats and the remaining 1/2 cup I used oat bran (or wheat bran) - it looks like oats anyways, nobody will know it's there.

This is a very yummy recipe! I subsituted dried cranberries for dried pomegranate, and peanuts instead of almonds. It gives it a nuttier flavor. it was delicious!

These were so delicious!  I used 1 cup of almond slivers and shopped pecans, 1/4 cup ground flax seed, 3/4 cup dried cherries, blueberries and cranberries, and 1 cup of mini choc chips.  I can't stop eating this!  I plan on taking this on our vacation next week, hiking in the Smoky Mountains.  These bars are way better than anything I've had from the store.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I made two batches.  The first with 2 Tbsp peanut butter, 1 C peanuts, and 1 C mini chocolate chips.  They're pretty yummy, but not as sweet as store-bought, so you can't expect that.  I might add more peanut butter and a little brown sugar next time.  My second batch had 1 C coconut, 1 C sliced almonds, 2/3 C white chocolate chips, 1/2 C craisins, 1/3 C flax seeds, and about 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Oh my goodness.  Delicious!

This recipe is great. I didn't have dried cranberries or chocolate chips on hand, so I made it with dried blueberries. I made it a second time with dried blueberries and dried cherries. The first time I put it in the fridge instead of bagging them, so it got kind of stale after a couple days, but when the granola bars are bagged they last for at least a week. It's great for breakfast with milk or just as a snack to take with you when your in a rush.

These turned out great!  I followed someone elses review and baked on a Jelly Roll Pan, I wanted them a little thicker so I just left a few inches at the end of the pan and it worked out great.  I didn't have everything in recipe so I added what I had, almonds, pecans, sunflower seeds, and coconut.  I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you put in it.  I will bake for 17-18 min. next time.  I especially liked that they weren't real sweet as with store bought granola bars.

This is my 100th review on AR:] Boy am I glad that it was a good one. I figured I should follow the recipe this time, so the only changes I had were very minor-- raisins for cranberries, reg. choc chips, fat free sweet. cond. milk, and a mixture of almonds and cashews to make up the one cup of nuts. I stored them in the fridge, and it gives them the perfect texture--just chewy enough. Many are saying that this is the best thing I've made the entire summer, and even though I would like to think that I've cooked nothing but awesomeness. this is particularly awesome. I'm adding applesauce( maybe 1/4 c or so) next time, omitting the butter, and taking it out at exactly 19-20 min. And lining the pan with wax paper. And has anyone tried using evaporated milk for the sweetened condensed? just an idea.

These were indeed easy. I reduced and put in 1 cup of sweetened condensed milk and made up the rest of the liquid with 3/4 cup water and then stirred all into the melted butter (I will omit the butter next time). The bars turned out sweet enough for me. I greased and lined my pan with parchment paper so the slab released with no effort at all. I cut them with pastry cutter pretty soon after I took the pan out of oven. This is a great base recipe that allows you to play around with the add-ins. I added lots of different stuff like almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkim seeds, dried cranberries, chocolate chips, butterscotch morsels, sesame seeds, flax seeds and even psyllium. I just made sure that everything totaled up to 3.5 cups and the texture turned out perfectly fine.

I've made this twice in two weeks.  The first time I made the easy recipe even easier by using Sam's Choice "indulgent trail mix" from WalMart.  The mix has white chocolate, choc chips peanut butter chips, golden raisins, cranberries, almonds, peanuts, and cashews in a 1 lb. 12 oz bag.  I found this a good mix, not too much of any one thing, plus cheaper ($5 for entire bag) than buying separate components.  I had coconut in the freezer so I threw a little of those in.  I also doubled and used a jelly roll pan. I also used one can fat-free condensed milk and one regular because that is what I had on hand.  I used 1/2 quick oats and 1/2 old fashioned.  I found that these were thicker and needed a little more cook time but turned out great and chewy!  The second time I made a single batch with fat-free condensed milk, the trail mix, no coconut but added cinnamon, 1/2 quick oats 1/2 old fashioned oats, and 1/2 C wheat germ.  In a 9 x 13 these were thinner and didn't need additional cook time, in fact 20 minutes was almost too much.  Either way, they were great!  They also freeze very well!

Great, easy recipe. I love how you can easily tweak it to your preferences. I used 1.5 c regular oats and 1.5 flavored oatmeal packs. I omitted butter and used fat-free condensed milk. Take the greasing the pan part very seriously!

This recipe was a good starting point.  I made it vegan by using 2 mashed bananas instead of the butter, coconut milk instead of sweetened condensed, and agave to sweeten.  I had to use more nuts (chopped walnuts, almonds, and a few brazil nuts instead of sliced almonds) and added chopped dates.  This is a very versatile starting place for really good, healthy granola bars.

I followed the recipe the first time, but since nuts and coconut are not allowed in our school here in town I had to make some changes - just eye balling I added raisins, white chocolate chips, more oatmeal, cranberries and fresh apples! They are super tasty!!! My son LOVES them and now I have a healthy alternative for a snack! Thanks!

Good base recipe.  I used what I had on hand: walnuts, dried dates, chocolate & some cinnamon-pretty good but not great with these changes.  UPDATE: followed recipe but used 1c of dried cranberries, only 1/2c chocolate and fat-free sweetened condensed milk.  I baked them on a foil-lined cookie sheet sprayed with Pam and they're excellent!  My son snuck one off of the cooling rack and gobbled it down immediately.  He says they're "cookies".  I got the crunchy texture I was looking for!

I tried this recipe because I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I only substituted raisins for the cranberries and added a scoop of peanut butter.  I pressed them into a jellyroll pan lined with a silpat. I baked them at 300 for 35 minutes.   They were good but too sweet. They taste A LOT like a magic bar.  The taste of the sweetened condensed milk really prevailed and it's not something you would expect in a granola bar.  Overall, it was easy and yummy but not what I was looking for.  I think I'm looking for something with more of a trail mix feel - fruit, nuts, and honey.

These were quick and easy to make.  Reminded me of the 7-layer bars.  I did leave out the chocolate chips.  Only complaint is that they are a little crumbly.  Definitely will make again and keep recipe.

Very very yummy! It is a wonderful alternative sweet treat. For an added health benefit I substituted walnut oil in place of butter and found it to be just as tasty.

These were very good, though I wasn't totally blown away. Anyway, I made these pretty much as called for, just varied the mix-ins somewhat and added a pinch of salt and some spices. That long review a page or two back by wife2maleRN was very helpful. I baked mine in a 11x17" jelly roll pan, lined with foil that was heavily buttered. When it came out, I scored it with the pizza cutter & flipped it onto another sheet of foil to cool. After cooling, it easily broke into nice clean bars. My husband and I took them camping this weekend and ate every one. His only complaint was that they should be chewier -- but maybe if I had used the 9x13" pan as called for, the thicker bars might've been chewier. May make again if occasion warrants.  Cost-wise this doesn't beat store-bought by much, since nuts aren't cheap.

These are great! I used crushed dried banana chips, walnuts, and raisins, and substituted fat free sweetened condensed milk. I also followed advice seen in other reviews and used a slightly larger pan lined with wax paper. I think next time I will add some honey to make these a little sweeter.

These were OK at best.  They were a little too hard to get out of the pan then would fall to pieces in my hand.  The flavor was a little bland.  My daughter wouldn't eat them.  Don't think I'll make these again.

I love these granola bars.  I substitute coconut oil for the butter and use coconut oil for greasing the dish.  I use a mixed antioxidant dried fruit blend from Costco instead of just cranberries.  So yummy and lasts a long time sealed in a zip lock bag.

AWESOME. I have been making these bars for a year and the kids still devour them. i was looking for a healthy alternative to store bought. I have since made them for hiking trips and great for a quick snack. The great part of this recipe is the flexibility. Using different nuts or peanut butter, maple syrup, craisens, dates. the possibilities are endless.

Excluded the nuts, so my kids would eat them. These actually taste like granola bars, not like cakey cookies, and they hold together pretty well. Make sure you remove them from the pan right when they are cool enough. And enjoy! They are good.

Skipped the craisens and added chia seeds for the "health" of it!  Turned out great.  Helped to spray my hands with non-stick spray to press in the pan.

This recipe is fabulous! Be sure to read the review by the recipe author, that is what made this recipe 5 star for me! She said what she does is always has 3 cups of oats and then add 3-4 cups of anything else that you want! So I did 3 cups rolled oats, 1 cup chopped almonds, 1 cup chocolate chips, 1 cup crushed pretzels and 1 cup crushed corn flakes. I baked them for 22 minutes so that the outsides are crunchy but the inside is somewhat soft. Perfect! You can sub Fat Free Sweetened Condensed Milk to make it a bit healthier. The butter is totally unnecessary in my opinion, omit it! Great recipe--thanks!

I use a cupcake tin, drop a bit of olive oil on the paper, and press the bars into place with an oiled drinking glass.  After baking, I press again.  Fantastic, fun, and healthy recipe.  Thank you for it, Aliceyn.

This is wonderful- I love how customizable it is.  I have a co-worker who is allergic to nuts, so I just subbed in extra dried fruit.  Dried apples are amazing in it.  What a great versatile snack bar.  And, the parts that crumbled when removed from the pan make a nice sprinkle to put on top of yogurt and ice cream!

The flavor was excellent, although the bars did not stay together very well which was a bit frustrating.  I didn't use coconut, but a mix of cranberries, walnuts, butterscotch nibs, sunflower seeds and raisins.  Very tasty.

I didn't want to buy individual bags of fruit, nuts and chocolate, so I just bought a trail mix that had all the things that I liked in it: white chocolate chips, cranberries, and almonds!  The flavor was amazing!  

As for the consistency, I think I pulled them out too early because they lacked shape. :-/  I will definitely try a longer bake time and see if I can get a better appearance out of them.

Soooo good! Little high calories but at least I know what is in them. I made two different kinds: Banana-Walnut-Chocolate and Apricot-Almond-Chocolate. Both turned out to be delicous and I will definitely make them again!

These are incredibly tasty and I love that they do not contain flour! My four kids and husband are crazy about them. I got a little creative with additions, but I used the overall basic recipe. I added mini chocolate chips, a small handful of peanut butter chips, flaxseed meal instead of almonds, and a scoop of peanut butter. It seemed slightly dry as I was mixing it, so I added maybe 2 tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce. They were nice and crunchy on the edges but chewy in the middle. They held together really well. Next time, I'll play around with more peanut butter and maybe some banana chips. Thanks for a keeper!

Use parchment paper or they stick to the pan and impossible to get out.  I've made them twice now and I love them and so do the kids. I've served them to people and they ask for the recipe as well.  Great snack and very nutrious.

These were delicious!  Great flavor!  I had the same problem with these that I have with all the granola bars I've made though, they don't hold together like the kind you purchase!  I don't think it's the recipe though...it's me!  I think I need to get a larger pan and cook them slightly longer.  I would definitely make these again, they were the perfect fix when I had a sweet tooth!

This is such a great recipe to experiment with! I took the advice of wife2malern, baking the mix for 20 minutes, cutting the bars with a pizza cutter, and flipping it onto some foil while still hot. Worked great! Just make sure you oil your pan well and squish/flatten the mix firmly or it might fall apart. Along with the oats and fat free condensed milk, I used 1 cup shredded coconut, 1 cup sliced almonds, and 1.5 cups of dried cherries. I also added a tsp of vanilla. This came out perfect. Great recipe!

I recently had a baby so spare time for baking is hard to find but I wanted to make something homemade to serve to my Mom's group. I needed something quick, easy and good. This recipe is it! It's incredibly easy and very satisfying. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I did substitute dried cherries for the cranberries (delicious!). I also lined my pan with parchment paper so it was a snap to get the bars out of the pan and clean-up was a breeze. I also had to bake the bars longer (about 50 minutes) - maybe because of the parchment paper. 

My guests loved the bars and they are now my new favorite! I'm looking forward to experimenting with different add-ins. This one's a keeper!

I did change it a bit (my daughetr loves candied cherries, and I had nuts instead of almonds, and reduced the coconut increasing teh cranberries instead...). It really allows you to play and comes out amazing!

Great recipe!  An easy recipe to tailor to your own tastes.  I followed another reviewers suggestion that it basic ratio of 3 cups oats to 3 to 3 1/2 cups mix of nuts, dried fruit, and chips.  I also omitted the butter and used fat free sweetened condensed milk.  They came out awesome and I've already made them 3 times!
To keep them from sticking to the pan or my hands, I lined the 9x13 pan with parchment paper then covered my hand with a plastic bag put a few drops of oil on the bag and pressed the granola in pan using the plastic bag- worked great!!

Wow! This was super easy and very yummy. I used granola instead of oats and it turned out just as good. In fact, my teenager said that they tasted a lot better than the Nature's Valley Fruit & Nut granola bars that he loves. Oh, and the suggestion to put the can of condensed milk in warm water worked very well. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

These are the best granola bars I have tried to make from scratch - and that's saying something, since I've been trying recipes for years.  I've made 1 change - I use 1 cup whole oats, and 2 cups quick oats, for a less starchy texture. I mix in choc. chips, dried cranberries, 1 tbs. ground flax seeds, and salted pumpkin seeds. I make it every single week because I feel a bit sad in the morning without one! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

Followed the directions of the recipe and her posted comment. The oats was the base, I then added puffed rice cereal, choc chips, dried cherries, some mini marshmallows, and almond slivers. I made a double batch and baked it in a greased jelly roll pan. Yes pressing the ingredients into the pan is a sticky mess, but my son loved helping. You could either use foil, parchment, rubber spatula, oiled or buttered hands, then press down the mixture evenly into the pan. I baked it for 20 mins at 350'F. They were a bit difficult to remove from the pan. So next time i'll line it with sprayed parchment or foil, or a silpat. They were very chewy and a little difficult to cut even after 20 mins of sitting. I like mine a little crispier so next time I will do even longer, 25-30 mins- until the center starts to look slightly browned too. Overall a GREAT recipe. Thanks Aliceyn for a great, versatile, quick &  easy recipe. A definite keeper. Update: the bars were even better over the next few days. Not as gooey after they sat overnight. YUM. My 2 yr old loves them. ***Update: I have made this 2 other times now; as the single recipe & again as a dbl recipe. The recipe as is works out great. The dbl recipe I put in about 1/3 C. more cereal  b/c the bars the first time I made the dbl batch were very wet after baking & sitting 5 mins. Also, I've been making them in the evening, covering them w/ foil & a towel & let sit til morning, then remove from the pan and cut them; perfect & easier to cut.

These were a big hit at my house and couldn't be any easier. I used regular oats, and toasted them and the coconut and nuts (I used pecans), beforehand. I can't wait to customize them.

This is a great recipe.  I actually forgot to add the butter and did not realize until after I baked them but they were still good and chewy.  I cooked for 23 minutes and they are chewy.  I also added 1/4 cup of flaxseed meal and you can't even tell.

Delicious - I won't be buying the boxed granola bars anymore.  I made the recipe as is - I added some wheat germ just to sneak in more fiber.  There were 2 pc. I hid for myself that I forgot about - I made this batch 9 days ago....and it's still moist and fresh.  Crumble it over some vanilla yogurt and it was great.  My next batch will be dried apricots/cranstrawberry/almonds/coconut - can't wait!

These are fantastic and so easy. Was in the mood for sweets that day and substituted dark chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, raisins and walnuts and still came out great. Will keep playing with combinations. Thanks for sharing!

I wanted to save these all for myself! Yum! I used regular oats, toasted coconut, raisins instead of cranberries, and I replaced the butter with coconut oil. I can't make these often, since I'd gain 20 pounds fast!

HELP.  I'm reviewing from my husbands account... OMG!  Delicious!  And, I'm so happy with actually knowing what I'm putting into my body.  I used 1 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1 1/2 cups dried blueberries.  I will absolutely be making this again.  But, how do you get them not to fall apart when lifting them out of the pan?  It's stupid that I care about appearances, but... why are mine falling apart?  Hmmmm... suggestions?

I love these! Perfect combination of crunchy and chewy. I add all kinds of things depending on what I have in my pantry; flax seeds, sunflower seeds, raisins, craisins, chocolate chips, or all5! My 20 month old daughter and husband both love them. They are not super low in sugar, as someone else mentioned, but I feel good knowing that there are fewer chemicals and preservatives than store bought, they're cheaper, and I can sneak in good stuff, to. Try getting flax seeds and organic raisins in grocery store bars without spending a fortune!

I just added 1/3 chopped roasted almonds, 1/2 peanut butter, 2 T honey, and some raisins and it turned out great. I also made them thicker by using a smaller pan. Yummy!

Yum! I made these this morning and my 15-month old daughter hasn't stopped eating them! I followed the advice of the review that suggested cutting them with a pizza slicer and then flipping them onto foil.

Love this recipe!  Was simple and quick, I used a bag of mixed fruit and just cut it into smaller pieces, along with a bag of mini chocolate chips! Took the advice of another review and stuck the can of milk into a bowl of hot water and it was a huge help!

Not a huge fan of the flavor.  They need something salty to balance the sweetness of the condensed milk.  If I make these again I'll use some kind of salted nut.   I would have given 3 stars, but +1 for being easy and flexible.

These are very tasty and my kids really liked them. I found them on the sweet side and I prefer old-fashioned oats rather than quick oats. I also prefer more fruit, which, of course, could be added to this recipe. I would also bake them a little less, maybe only 17 minutes, as they were very firm and difficult to cut.

These were REALLY easy to make & taste great :) I added raisins, chocolate chips & trail mix. I also decided to add 3 Tbsp of honey, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon & 1 tsp of vanilla to give them a little more flavor...worked out fabulous!! Before cutting, I put the pan in the fridge to let them cool down completely. I'lll definitely make them again :)

Certainly the easiest granola bar I have made! The chewy texture turns out great every time and they hold together better than most bars I have tried. THis recipe is so easy and fun to experiment with. Add some flaxseed meal, wheat grem or oat bran for the added health benefits. Almond extract with dried cherries and alomonds is awesome as it any combination of nuts, dried berries and dark chocolate chips:) Thanks for sharing this!

Easy and delicious option to store bought granola bars.  I like to go to the bulk section at our "Whole Foods" type store and get dried cherries, chocolate chips, dried apricots and apples.  We go hiking quite a bit and it's a treat we all look forward to!

Wow!  These were so good and so easy.  I used about 1 cup choc chips (semi-sweet), 1 cup butterscotch chips, 3/4 cup coconut, and about 1.5 cups of salted, roasted cashews.  I used the 7 seven layer bar as my inspiration and that is what they taste like.  I baked them for 20 minutes and I have chewy, delicious bars that taste like a cookie or a candy bar but are healthier (at least a bit)!  Thanks for the recipe.  I can't wait to try different combos.

I altered this recipe by replacing the chocolate chips with a finely chopped apple. It turned out very soggy. I was hoping for something crunchy. I think the baking time in this recipe is not enough.  Next time I will use liquid honey instead of the sweetened condensed milk.

I thought this was okay, but tasted very strongly like the condensed milk. My hubby didn't care for the, so I probably will not make them again. On the plus side, though, it was very easy and had nice flexibility.

I love this recipe. I add flax, hemp seeds and whatever I have on hand. The condensed milk is very high in calories but when you can add all the other good stuff then the calories are worth it. Sometimes you need to forget about the calories and worry more about the nutrients. Adding things like hemp will give you the oils you need and is also very filling so your granola bar becomes more like a meal rather then a snack. If you don't like the sweetness just don't add the chocolate. My kids love my homemade granola bars and I love hiding healthy things in them. ;)

These were good; followed directions pretty closely, but added some flax seed just because.  They do need to be pushed down firmly in the pan to stay together (and you do need to wait until they are very cool to cut).

To make healthier use golden raisins instead of chocolate chips - still tastes great and won't melt in the heat of summer!!!

Very good and easy! I used wife2maleRN's suggestions about flipping it out of the pan and that worked very well. The only difference was that I used non-stick foil (didn't have parchment) on the bottom that I coated with cooking spray (to be extra sure it wouldn't stick) and that worked really well. I also warmed the condensed milk in some hot water before mixing. Overall, very tasty and easy. This will be a recipe to experiment with!

I make these at least once a month.  I began with this original recipe and have tried altered versions to keep it new and fresh.   I double or triple this and make a huge sheet pan full, then cut them into bar sized chunks to keep in ziplocks.  They store quite well.  My kids ages 3 and 18 months will eat a whole bar for a snack.

This is the best recipe that i've come across for granola bars.  The kids at my daycare absolutley LOVE them! Since we're not allowed to use seeds or nuts in our facility, i incorporate dried apples, dried cherries, raisins, and dark chocolate chips.  Also, they're so easy for the kids to help make on bake sale days!

Delicious and easy! The only thing I may do different in the future is to toast the almonds before adding. I thought they'd toast in the oven but they really didn't.  It would give the whole bar more flavour.  Oh, and I did add a pinch of salt and it was a good addition.  Keep in mind this is a SWEET recipe, almost like a dessert or cookie- my BF loves sweet and when I told him I might like to take out some chocolate chips and add some pretzel pieces in the future for some salt he said absolutely not! He really loves it as is!

I thought these were okay. I found them a little bland-maybe because I left out the chocolate chips? Maybe a little vanilla or extra cinnamon would help? My mom liked them and so did my 2 year old, but my husband and I didn't care for them much.

We love this recipe, we did substitute fat-free sweetened condensed milk for the regular and we use low-fat peanut butter instead of the butter.  We have halved the chocolate chips and put some chopped butterscotch chips in.  I also use chopped roasted/salted almonds instead of the sliced almonds. We have made this weekly since finding this recipe.  I also double the recipe and use a jelly roll pan with parchment paper to bake it on.  We then place in snack size bags and put in freezer.  These are quick grab and go snack that are filling.

Great Recipe!  Kids loved!  Will make again.  I didn't have any cranberries, so I substituted with some raisen date nut instant oatmeal.

I made these with 2 cups rice cereal, 1 cup mini chocolate chips, and 1 cup with a combination of slivered almonds, heath toffee bits, and mini m&m's (cleaning out pantry).  This wasn't the healthiest version, but they were yummy!  I used a large jelly roll pan and sliced them with a pizza cutter when they came out.  The rice cereal gave them a nice crunch.  I look forward to making again with wheat germ and flax seed for a healthier version.  Can't go wrong with these!

I made these as writen and I reall *like* them.  Next time I will use more cranberries and nuts, less chocolate.  I read one review that had you put tin foil over the granola bar tops immediately after baking then flip the pan over so the bars came out to dry nicely - this worked, thanks for the tip.  I also cut the bars just 10 minutes out of the oven.

These are delicious!   I line the 9x13 pan with parchment paper so some is hanging over the sides.  Then I take another piece of parchment paper and place it on top of the granola once I've dumped it into the pan.  I use my meat pounder (flat side) and pound it and smooth it all over the top of the parchement paper so the granola underneath gets nice and flat and pushed into the edges of the pan.   Once they're done baking, I pull it out of the pan with the parchment paper and l cut it into bars with my pizza cutter.  Perfect!

Easy, yes.  Good flavor, but...  ... the texture is fairly mediocre.  I let mine cool plenty, and they still really wanted to crumble on the edges.  The color is kind of unappetizing, too.

Great basic recipe.  We have made these several times and changed them up each time.  I use a large jellyroll pan to make thin bars.  Make sure not to overcook!    Also, followed the advice to soak the milk in warm water to make mixing easier.  Great recipe!

These stayed moist and chewy ~ a true winner in our books! Because this recipe is so versatile you can add what ever additions you want. I added mini choc chips, dried cranberries, raisins and about 1/4 cup peanut butter.  It was soooooo good.  Also, I subbed flax meal for half of the wheat germ.

I just finished making these bars - they are still cooling (so much for the cool completely - they are super yummy warm!)  I think the thing that makes this recipe great is the versatility - you can use whatever you want to!  I did what Alicecyn recommended - 3 c. oats, 4 c. of 'whatever' - and was very pleased.  Going to be very easy to change and allow for different tastes.  Thanks for posting it - and thanks to other reviewers for ideas!

I love this granola bar! It is so easy and much more economical than buying pre-packaged bars. As other reviewers suggested, I omitted the butter and didn't miss it. I highly recommend adding sunflower kernels.

These are terrific. I made my first batch yesterday and already I'm making a double batch today to send as a class snack with my daughter tomorrow. I used chopped chocolate and peanut butter chips and they turned out delicious - and much cheaper than any of the premade bars you can buy at the store. Thanks for a great recipe!

AWESOME!! Very chewy! Super easy! I ate 3 before they were cooled off! I added cashews, crushed almonds, chopped marshmallows, chocolate chips, and reeses pieces (varied the amount to my liking..add as much of each as you want!) Perfect Halloween colors! Will be making more in a day or two when these are all gone ;)

While I like the easy prep and so few ingrediants, I didn't like the taste for the same reason I don't like 7 layer magic bars - all you can taste is the condensed milk.  Gave me a tummy ache!

Easy to make and can be altered with so many different ingrediants.  My daughter made them and omitted the butter and they were excellant, and I love that there is no added sugar.  Its a huge hit with the whole family.

Since I didn´t have cups to measure, I used 2 glasses of "Haferflocken" (I live in Germany) and 3 glasses of cranberries, apricots, almonds, hazelnuts and sunflower seeds and added condensed milk (unsweetened, so I added two tablespoons of brown sugar) until it was a moist sticky mixture. Baked 30 minutes. Great basic recipe that works with eye judgement!

I used only a few chocolate chips and added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1-2 tbsp of sesame seeds. I mixed everything together on low speed in my kitchenaid mixer.  Pressed everything down with wet hands in pan. Came out perfect. Cut it when still a little bit warm. Easy, easy so easy recipe.

I'm going to have to experiment with this recipe to get it to come out just right, but the taste is so yummy I have to give it a 5 stars.  I only had old fashioned oats and I'm sure using the instant will be much better at holding the bars together.  Will use parchment paper and a smaller pan next time.  These are just too thin for me.  Look forward to all the possibilities with this recipe.

tasted good, but was very crumbly because in Canada our Sweetened condensed milk comes in 300ml cans (about 10oz).  This was an oversight on my part, but just in case....check the size of your can.  I will make this again and adjust the ratios.

These came out perfect. The only thing I did differently was that I added 1/4 cup of milled flax seed just to give it an extra healthy boost. I keep them in the freezer and just grab them as I need. They thaw within 10 minutes.

That was frustrating.  Let me share my experience so you can avoid the same mistakes.  I followed the recipe exactly except I altered some the the extra ingredients.  Nevertheless, there was a total lack of cohesion.  I baked them for 20 mins and although the top was  relatively hard the bottom was just gooey.  I cut them at 5 minutes and it was just a mess, they crumbled.  They were very difficult to work with.  I would recommend at least 25 minutes in the oven, leave them to cool for a few hours and then try working with them.  Otherwise, somebody, feel free to let me know what I could have done wrong :(    Happy Baking! 
Since I wrote my original review, I've made this at least 7 times.  It's perfect now!  It's important to add a full 3.5 cups of add-ins, whatever you choose.

We didn't like these at all.  They are hard to chew, and the taste of condensed milk is overpowering.  I made them several months ago, and they are still sitting in the freezer.

BEST GRANOLA BARS EVER! I've made these so many times with so many ingredients, White chocolate, cranberry, almond, or peanut butter chip, smartie, trail mix... even protein powder for power bars. So simple and delicious every time! My only caution is to spray your pan or use extremely non-stick jelly roll pans because they are very hard to scrape out of pyrex pans

I give this 5 stars for ease and versitility. Have made it several times with several variations for friends. For those that had problems with texture, I found that cooking on a baking sheet allowed the bars to cook more evenly. They come out a bit more chewy in the middle when cooked in a glass pan (some people like that though). You must let them cool and harden before you cut them up. 
Variations I tired: Omitted the butter and used Fat Free S.C. milk. Added a cup or two of high protein cereal, cup of butterscotch chips and sunflower seeds. Delish. Also made them "tropical" with coconut, macadamia nuts and banana chips. Be creative!! I am going to try and add some protein powder next time and see what happens... :)

These are so quick and easy. I love how versitile they are. I always use Fatfree Sweet and Condensed Milk. You can make these as 'healthy' or as sinful as you like! Some of my favorite combinations in addition to the oatmeal:

Add 1 TBS almond paste to the Milk, slivered almonds, coconut and  dried cherries or blueberries. 

Add 3-4 TBS Peanut Butter to the Milk, Peanut Butter chips, Reese's Pieces and Chocolate Chips

Add 2 TBS Caramel topping to the milk, Mini chocolate chips, coconut, pecans, butterscotch chips

This recipe gets 5 stars because it really is easy.  They are also quite yummy.  I didn't have almonds so I used pecans and I also added a half of a cup of bran to up the fiber a bit.  They are super chocolatey.  I took someone's suggestion and put my can of milk in a bowl of hot water while I assembled the rest of the ingredients.  It was much easier to pour and incorporate.  I will make these again!

Yummy and SO easy.
I substituted some Rice Krispies for part of the oatmeal...next time I may try cutting down on the condensed milk as others have done, as it's pretty high calorie/fat.
I made half dried apple/dried cranberries/cinnamon/almonds and half dried cherries/chocolate/almonds...loved them both!
Mine were getting dark around the edges and, when I checked, on the bottom but the top was still too pale for my liking.  So after they cooled a bit and I cut them into bars, I flipped them over and stuck them back into the oven for 5-10 more minutes.  The color improved and they were nicely crunchy/chewy.

Wow!  This is an amazing tasting granola bar.  I added about 1/2 cup peanuts, 1/2 a small pkg of shredded coconut, 1/2 small bag of dried cranberries and strawberries combined, and about 2/3 cup raisins.  So good!  I wrapped them up individually in foil and sent them to school with the kids.  My seven year old daughter said they were better than store bought granola bars, and I agree!  This recipe is extremely easy, and would be a great recipe to use with a group of children, because all you do is mix the ingredients together in a bowl, spray the back of a spoon with cooking spray, and then spread the stuff out and press down on a cookie sheet.  Delicious. :)

These are just scrumptious!! Nice and soft, but not gooey I made them for a friend of mine for Christmas who's by all accounts the outdoorsy/healthy type. I did make a couple of changes. I added cinnamon chips(hershey's) and I added about a tsp of cinnamon, some ground ginger, nutmeg and a pinch of ground cloves. I also didn't have any sweetened condensed milk...so I looked up subs and did 1 cup plus 2 TBLS of powdered milk, 3/4 of a cup of sugar and 1/2 cup warm water and disolved it all and it worked like a charm! The only reason that I gave these 4 starts is that some of them have a tendancy to break apart a bit...but it's about as close to perfect for homemade as you can get! Thanks for the great recipe!

First of all, did you know you can make sweetened condensed milk at home? It's way cheaper and easy! Yes, this granola bar recipe is a great base, although I did find it didn't stick together quite as well as I had hoped. I used half instant oats and half regular oats (because I ran out of instant), and it turned out fine. We added lots of crazy ingredients, and they were delicious! I used the crumbles as granola and ate with milk. Yummy! Thanks

This is a great basic recipe!  To cut carbs and calories, I used a can of evaporated milk and added @4-5 packets of splenda.  2 cups oats,1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1 cup each of soynuts, sunflower seeds, coconut, and almonds/pecans.  I then crushed 85% dark cocoa bar on top instead of chocolate chips.  A little messy, but wonderful!!

I've made these several times now.  I might make them with homemade sweetened condensed milk next.  I also very it, like a previous reader.  3 cups oats and 3-4 cups of whatever else.  I use flax seed, steel cut oats, wheat germ, regular oats, coconut, cinnamon, raisins, and sometimes chocolate chips.  I also try and use all organic ingredients.  Great recipe!

I prefer fewer chocolate chips than called for, but overall a great, easy recipe (as the name suggests). I also am going to try lining the pan with wax paper next time I make these. I have had trouble with it sticking in the pan.

OK, I am not a granola expert by far-maybe second attempt at it.  This is a great starter recipe.  Easy and tasty.  Can't say they were the healthiest thing ever but I make a lot more rich desserts so this qualifies as pretty healthy for me!  Easy to cut and store.  Stayed nice for about a week.

These were very easy and delicious. Actually, kind of hard to stop eating. All I had was whole oats, so I buzzed them in the food processor and that put them into the quick-cooking size. After cooling, I cut them with a pizza cutter and plastic knife, which I find cuts hot sweets easier.  I used a combo of almonds and pecans, chopped b/c I like to taste my nuts!  I baked mine for 20 min. and that was perfect for us.  The only drawback:  my yield was 20 pieces at under 11 g. fat per piece (Lifeform program).

Yummy - great for kids lunches and eating on the run. I'm pregnant and having trouble finding high energy, high fibre snacks that appeal to me, this one is great.
I used dates, walnuts and dessicated coconut and baked them for 30 minutes at 350 -  they're perfect.

Great recipe.  I used the ingredients listed, didn't add the melted butter, and used fat free sweetened condensed milk.  Sort of tasted like Seven Layer Bars, but really good.  I am going to try them next time with sunflower seeds, dried apples, and cinnamon.

I omitted the coconut and chocolate chips, and added a dried fruit blend of cranberries, golden raisens, blueberries, and cherrys.  I used whole instead of sliced almonds and added just a touch (maybe a tbsp) of brown sugar and a pinch of salt.  These were very easy to make--and tasty too.  Will make again.  :)

Delicious, easy to make and a hit with the hubby!

The best mix so far has been : Trail Mix and mixed dried fruit. Thanks for this great recipe! It is easy and very versatile.

This recipe is wonderful.  The kids love it, it's easy and very versatile.  I also make it with the low fat milk, and change the extras to whatever I have on hand.  The only problem I have is getting it out of the pan.  I do use a Pam spray, and I've tried paper lining, but it stuck to the paper!  Any way, it's worth the effort, and it is a staple in my weekly baking!  Thanks so much!!!

The directions to mix the dough by hand is important.  Making sure that all the oats have been covered with the condensed milk is very important before baking it.  We are also thinking about the possibility of spreading the mixture between 2 square pans to create more surface area during baking, which seems to be the reason some pieces stick together and others don't. 

Pecans and dried fruit are a good combo for breakfast or snack, and chocolate chips and cranberries are a terrific desert.

This granola bar turned out to be the perfect "on the go" breakfast bar.  It was delicious and not crumbly at all.  To make it even less messy (for the kids) I left out the chocolate chips and put in a few mini m&m's instead.

I teach nutrition to children and we are always looking for new cooking experiences. we followed this recipe except for adding different ingredients and we called them grizzly granola muffins since our experience requires each child to maker their own. we broke the recipe down to 1 and had each child make their own in a bowl and placed it in a muffin tin and cooked them for 10-15 min. then we put them in the freezer for 10 min then in the refrigerator for 30 min. The kids really enjoyed it!

These were great- the only change I made was substituting raisins for the cranberries since I didn't have any in the house. I cut them into the smallest bars I thought would hold together but only ended up getting about 15. Next time, I might try a slightly larger pan to get a thinner more bar like shape. These are even better a day or two later, and the white water kayakers I was with LOVED them.

This was the best recipe I have found on this site! It was true to the recipe, it came out perfect, and everyone loved them. I didn't even add the chocolate chips, instead I added more nuts and dried fruit. This recipe is a keeper! The baking time was correct too. Thanks for the great recipe!

Love the speed and simplicity of this recipe. I had sunflower seeds, some dates, dried apricots and sultanas in the pantry so used those instead of the choc chips, nuts and fruit. Also substituted oatbran for half the coconut,skim condensed milk for full fat, and a sterol margarine for the butter as I have high cholesterol. My five year old said 'these are SO good, Mummy', and I felt great about giving him something healthy. Next time I am going to use lots of nuts and dried apricots - YUM

Best granola bar recipe I have found!  My family loves these bars!!! A definate keeper and one I will make often.  These don't last long at my house! Delicious, easy to make, wonderful chewy texture. Dried papaya tidbits work well in place of craisens.

I changed the recipe slightly using Glace cherries, shredded coconut and flaked almonds to flavour.  Perhaps this is just to our English palate.  Would like to hear if any other version have been a success.

I needed to make a different recipe than I've  been making  and tried this one.  I used  old fashioned oats  and used the  other ingredients as listed.   Parchment paper lined my 9x13.   I've already eaten two.  Yummy!  The  oats on top look pale  so next time I will toast them at 400 for 8 minutes before mixing them in.  This recipe is a keeper.

VERY versatile! I've made it exactly as written and at least a dozen times with different flavours.  I use three cups oats, a can of sweetened condensed milk and then make up the remaining volume with whatever else I have (fruit, chocolate, seeds, nuts, grains). I press them into greased mini muffin pans so no cutting is required. Makes two-bite snacks!

Yummm! I made these mostly for my husband. He has been eating store-bought chewy granola bars for breakfast for years and years, and I wanted to try something healthier for him. These taste 100 times better than those, IMHO. I made them almost exactly as written, only substituting coconut oil for the butter. I live at 7200 feet so I baked them for 30 minutes. Make sure you cool them on a rack; I think that helps eliminate any "sogginess". Next time I might try peanuts for almonds and peanut butter instead of/in addition to butter. Soy nuts would be great, too.

Just made this recipe with a few adjustments, turned out great! For my 3 cups, I used mini chocolate chips, sliced almonds, and I cut up some dried banana chips. I thought I did a good job greasing the pan with spray olive oil, but it wasn't good enough. Next time, I'm going to try vegetable oil.

I had about 3 cups of a fruit and nut "muesli" cereal that nobody liked. So I added another cup of oats, and then a blend of  dried cranberries, chopped dates, pecans, chocolate chips and coconut to the bowl. Added the warmed sweetened condensed milk and a little vanilla. It went into a very greased 9x13 glass pan and was easily removed once it was cool. It is beyond delicious, and so easy. I planned to serve it for breakfast, but I doubt there will be any left in the morning! YUMMY!!!!!

I love this recipe! But I hate using condensed milk,I just used soy milk instead and I never use coconut flakes. I like to add brown sugar and maple syrup, sometimes honey depending my combo. So far my fav combo is dried blueberries, cashew, white chocolate. Literally add anything, bake, and enjoy, that's why I love them so much!

I made few changes to the recipe and turned it into gluten-free and dairy-free. Substituted butter with almond butter, chocolate chips with chopped walnuts, milk with almond milk, coconut flakes with half brown sugar and half chopped flaxseed. Turned out great! I will do it again! Thanks

Just tried for the first time and love it! I know it will be a staple in our house! I didn't use the recipe exactly (just like most) but I do have to make ours GF. The Bob's Red Mill Oats are not quick cooking so I put them and Milnot (instead of sweetened condensed milk) in a bowl and just let them soak for about 5-10 minutes. Added the remaining 4 cups of whatever I wanted (almonds, pecans, chocolate chips, rice kris pies, and flax seed) and that was that!  oh and I also added some cinnamon :)Thanks for an easy to convert and use recipe!

I followed the directions exactly as written. Just a pan full of raw oatmeal taste.  31/2 cups of toasted nuts, toasted coconut, and dried fruit and I can't taste ANY thing but the oatmeal.    This is the biggest disappointment I've ever had on this site.

I make these all the time now for my kids instead of buying granola bars.  So easy to make, and super yummy.  I used peanuts, chocolate chips and peanut butter chips - the kids love them!  A great, versatile recipe.

I threw in the kitchen sink and it all came out so tasty! I added hemp protein flakes, sunflower seeds, pecans, and Trader Joe's dried mixed mango, cranberries, and blueberries, along with TJs dried Cherries (I only added about two tablespoons of each added ingredient). I topped it off with chia seeds and sprinkled cinnamon for added flabor. Scrumptious. If I had the time, I'd sort out the fiber per serving, as that's what I was going for. Oh yeah, and I had some Lindt 80% bitter chocolate and chopped off a couple of bars, not too many however--just to add a couple of surprise bites along the way. Marvelous.

So yummy!  I made a double batch and cooked for 30 min. then put them in the refrig.  I do wish I had put them in a larger than 9x13 pan,  pretty thick but still good.  So easy to make!

Flavor was great but it was a bit crumbly so might lower the amount oats or maybe add some peanut butter to hold it together.

Great recipe.  I don't use the chocolate chips, these are plenty sweet as is. Instead I put in an equal amount of blener-ized popcorn.  I do use half dried blueberries and half cranberries and a tablespoon of flax.

I thought I'd give these a try and am glad I did.  They were very good and my husband loved them.  I did omit the butter and instead of sliced almonds I added a cup of mixed nuts, mini semi sweet chocolate chips and added some butterscotch chips as well & crasins & 1/3 cup of peanut butter.   This recipe is great because you can change it and they are still so yummy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This turned out great! Pretty easy, too. Followed another viewer's suggestion to warm the can of milk (I used fat free) in hot water and blend with melted butter (in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup). It got a little messy mixing by hand but used a large spoon to scrape down my fingers. Bars came out of pan easily. I used dried cherries instead of cranberries but that's just personal preference and also because I live in the National Tart Cherry Capital of the World (Traverse City, MI). I wrapped each bar individually in aluminum foil and store in zip lock bag. Will definitely make again and possibly change up some ingredients.

My family and I love this recipe. So easy to make , but They never last long. Instead of the butter I add in 2 TBS peanut or almond butter.   The flavoured condensed milks work well to change it up every once in a while too!

My children and I love this recipe. I leave out the butter. I have three combinations: the basic one above with walnuts or almonds; a tropical one with dried pineapple/papaya, dates, and sunflower seeds; and a YUMMY crunchy peanut butter/chocolate chip version.

This was incredibly easy to make, and extremely delicious!  My daughter has a nut allergy and has always been afraid to try granola bars.  She loves them!  Next time I will try it with the low-fat condensed milk and decrease the chocolate chips a bit, but I had no trouble getting the cooked mixture out of the pan and onto a cutting board to cut into bars.

The first time I made them, it didn't work. The second time, I used a jelly roll pan (cookie sheet with sides) and that worked out perfect. I used partchment paper and just pealed it off when I cut them up.  My co-workers loved them so much, they all asked for the recipe!

I've made this as written and was good but I thought there was a lot of chocolate. Here's my current combo of ingredients: 2.5c oats, 1/2c rice krispies cereal, 1/2c. each of peanuts and sunflower seeds, 1c of cranberries, 1/2c. of white chocolate chips, and then the condensed milk. I didn't feel like melting butter on the stove because I don't have a microwave so I omitted it and it turned out SOOO good. If you make these as individual portions like a cookie you should use those ice cream scoops people use to portion out cookie dough and bake for 10-15 min. I baked them for 20 this way and they were slightly overdone but still tasty.

Tip: need to generously butter AND flour the pan for the bars not to stick. Parchment paper, even when also buttered, still stuck to the bars. I have made these several times, and we love this recipe, especially now that I can get them out of the pan. As with most things homemade, so much better than store bought granola bars. I actually bought some name brand ones recently when in a hurry, and they tasted so "processed" and bland in comparison now. Very easy, very flexible for changing up the add-ins! I use old-fashioned oats, not the quick or instant kind, because it's what I have and think they work great. Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect recipe for an easy snack! I have been making these all the time with different requested add-ins. Chocolate chips and hazelnut (or walnut) seem to be the favorite. Add a little wheat germ for a great snack that can be made ahead of time for the school week. They do seem to get better the day after cooking, though.

Quick and easy, and tastes great! I didn't do any nuts or anything else with salt, so I added a tsp. I also added a bit of ground flax seed to make them "healthy" (ahem) and a cup of rice krispies to make them more like the store-bought variety so my kids would eat them. Used a jelly roll pan and parchment paper and they came out perfectly.

Update: I made these again the other day and underbaked them a little (18 min). It's been three days, and they are still soft and chewy. I just have them in a zip lock bag.

I guess it depends on whether you want a sweet, cookie-like bar or one that tastes kind of healthy.  This one is a cookie bar.  I used 3 c. quick oatmeal, 2 T. melted butter, fat free sweetened condensed milk, 1 c. chopped, salted almonds, 1/2 c. chopped walnuts, 1 cup dried strawberries, 1 cup dried blueberries, and 1 cup miniature chocolate chips.  I pressed it in the pan using leftover butter wrapper.  As other reviewers recommended, I cut it right after it came out and tried a piece - I had no problems getting it out of the pan, using non-stick cooking spray for baking (includes flour in the spray).  I definitely like the flavor combination - maybe I would use less condensed milk, and sub almond butter to make it less sweet (noted in other reviews).  Also, increase the walnuts to 1 cup, then decrease the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup.  It's whatever suits your taste.  Texture seems good - will have to see how it is when it's completely cooled.

I haven't made these... but my Dad makes these ALL THE TIME! Its the granola bar that my daughter requests to have handy for an after school snack - or before a track meet. They are filling, and not disgustingly sweet. Lots of crunch and chew - depending on what you put in them.

These can be very hard to get out of the pan. I buttered the pan well and covered with a thin layer of rolled oats before putting the mixed ingredients in and they were much easier to remove. Otherwise very good; an economical and tasty bar. Don't forget to add the salt or they may taste a bit bland.

I only had regular oats on hand so I used those. Probably why they are a little crumbly! Next time I will try quick oats to see if they hold shape better. I also wasn't paying attention to 'wait 5 minutes to cut'. After a few minutes of cooling they held together better. Any crumbly peices I pressed back together and that seemed to help. I would love to find something else besides the canned sweetened milk to use, like honey. I wonder if it would be as good of a binder.

I have made these many times and I get compliments every time. The best thing is that you can change the ingredients to suit your needs - I often leave out the nuts for allergy reasons or add raisins instead of cranberries. My family won't eat store bought granola bars anymore. Thanks for posting.

I didn't read all 499 reviews.  The first time I greased the pan and it was very hard to get the bars out once they cooled.  This time I used non-stick release foil and made it so much easier.  Now I will continue to use this recipe.  Great for gluten-free too.

I followed this recipe exactly and termed what resulted as "granola disaster."  Not sure what went wrong, but they aren't bars and don't stay together at all, just crumble when touched.  Also, the only flavor I get is raw oats.

SO easy - the hardest part was giving them enough time to cool before eating!  Unbelievably quick and very versatile.  Just made my first batch with toasted almonds, cranberries and coconut - and I'm looking forward to testing other combinations!  So happy to have found a new go-to recipe for years to come!

These are WONDERFUL.  We have a 17 year old here at the house and he loves to grab a couple of granola bars for breakfast.  We decided to make these to see if he might like something a little healthier for him.  It turned out that he loves them and he's picky about his granola bars too.   We have made 2 batches of them so far and the only thing we did differently on the second batch was to add 1/3 cup of wheat bran and extra cranberries plus 1 tbs extra butter. We use our Ninja to chop up the cranberries, chocolate chips and almonds and that works perfectly. Wait till you try them. mmmmmm

Very good--used frozen cranberries instead as that is all I had and cooked a bit longer (~25 min).  The fresh berries were unbelievable in this.

I love the versatility of this recipe! You really can put whatever bits and pieces you'd like in these. I made mine with a cup of chocolate chips, a cup of sliced almonds, and a cup of dried cranberries. I cooked mine for exactly 20 minutes and they came out nice and chewy. I think next time I make them, I will cook them a bit longer, just to see how they taste when they're crunchy. I definitely will be making these again!

I just made these.  It worked out extremely well.  Because of nut restrictions at my kids' school, I substituted sunflower seeds for the nuts.  In Canada they sell sweetened condensed milk in 350ml containers, which is just about 12 oz.  I used that with a tablespoon more butter and had no problems.  I'll be making these again for sure!

We followed the recipe with the following substitutions: walnuts for almonds, chopped dried cherries for cranberries, and mixed mini choc chips and white chips for the mini chips.  We all loved them.  They set up perfectly.

This recipe is terrific.  I replace the chocolate chips with dried blueberries and the almonds with sunflower seeds to make them school friendly. You can also leave out nearly half the condensed milk if you add ground flax or mushed up banana to help them bind during cooking. They also freeze REALLY well.  You can put them frozen into the kids lunch box (as long as you've not used nuts in the recipe!) and by lunch they are ready to go.  My son actually eats them frozen too...

I was surprised how easy these granola bars were.  My family loved them. I followed the recipe exactly. For the most part they kept their shape as well.  Great after school snack for the kids.  Can't wait to try some other ingredients.

I loved these!I followed the ingredients exactly but I did lower the temp. to 325 and baked them for 25 minutes because I like my granola bars more chewy and less crispy.I love how versatile this recipe is.I'm excited to try different combos!Thank you so much for sharing!

Delicious!! I personally added 1 cup dried cranberies and 1/2 cup choc. chips. Also, these don't really form into granola bars I found that they were more of a crumble snack. Still super yummy!!

I love these granola bars!  The only problem is that I find they dry out a little and then become crumbly instead of chewy.  I don't think I'm overcooking them but I guess it's possible.  It makes them harder to cut but still soooooo good!

this was the BEST granola recipie I've ever had! They are soooooo yummy and had the least amount of sugar and butter of any other I've seen. My whole family absolutly loves them and I love that they're healthy and not to mention SUPER easy to make! I am going to make these once a week now to have on hand and can't wait to try different fruits and nuts. So so so good, a MUST for anyone who loves granola bars but doesn't want all the sugar. YUM!

These had all my favorite flavors! The only problem is I don't want to sit down and eat them in one sitting.  I have lots of college students in my house right now and they are loving them!  The only change I made is using chopped pecans rather than almonds.  I cooked them until just brown around the edges.  I wish I had cooked them longer and I will next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are a hit with my family!  I like how this recipe just calls for the condensed milk to sweeten the bar.  I also added flaxseed and wheat germ to mine.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Just made these and they are ok.  I skipped the butter and the coconut and halved the choc chips.  Added an extra 1/2 c. each of the dried fruit and oats plus a 1/2 c. flax seed to make up for the missing coconut and chips.  I think I'd like them better with all dried fruit and no choc chips.  The bars were also a little dry, so I may make them one more time and add a splash of canola oil to replace the butter.

I was given 3 big tubs of organic quick cooking oats and decided to try this recipe to use up some oats. These are FANTASTIC and easy! I was so tired of the store bought boring granola bars. Love this recipe.

I made these for my hubby to take to work one day.  He took enough to share with some of his co-workers and they asked where he got them!  I'll make them again for sure but mix and match my ingredients.  Maybe some almonds or dark chocolate chips...  MMMMMM

So easy!  I just made a pan of these for my son to take for snacks to preschool.  All 4 of my kids loved them.  I used raisins instead of cranberries, about 1/2 the coconut, and used sunflower seeds instead of almonds.  I really didn't have any problem getting them out of the pan at all.  I baked them for 20 minutes in a well-greased Pyrex pan, cut them while still warm, and inverted them onto a cookie sheet.  They were a little sweet for my taste, but I didn't make them for myself.   The kids gave them a A+.

I have already made these 3 times since I found this recipe. Each time with slightly different ingrediants and each time I love them. They are wonderful. I always toast my coconut and other nuts first. I found that soaking the oats in pineapple juice (one of those little cans) makes the bars moister. I have used dates, walnuts sunflower seeds and sesame seeds in them I always add a tad of wheat germ too and sometimes a dash of cinnamon. Thank you for a wonderful and healthy treat.

These are really good, although I am sure not much more healthy than oatmeal cookies! I baked them a bit longer so they weren't as chewy so my son could eat them without them sticking to his spacer in his mouth! had no problem getting them out of the pan warm or cool. We used chopped chocolate and white chocolate chips. My kids have been begging for me to make them again, they work great for lunch boxes, snacks in the car, and general munching!

Delicious, just as written. Not sure what others have done wrong. I subbed peanuts for almonds because they were on sale. I did cut them before they were cool and that worked out well. Enjoy!!

Love the versatility!  I mistakenly added too much tidbits the first time around (4 1/2 cups rather than 3 1/2 cups) and they still turned out deliciously.  Just took overnight to set up firm enough to eat like a bar.  Just finished making for a second time, but with 3 cups of pre-made trail mix and 1/2 cup of coconut.  Can't wait to give them a try!  They look just like granola bars from a store.  I may never purchase granola bars again :)

Love these bars. They are super easy.  I love the fat free sweetened condensed milk.  It really made a great taste.  I made the first recipe exactly and it was great.  I am making a new batch with a large scoop of peanut butter and vanilla extract.  They are super fantastic.  Thanks for this little treat.

Just spent a few difficult minutes trying to remove my first batch from my non-stick pan without ruining it -- gave up and the whole thing is now soaking in hot water! This stuff is like cement so oil the pan generously! Not sure the flavor is worth it -- you have to like the flavor of cooked milk as it seems to dominate the recipe. It certainly is easy and adaptable, though.

I can't say I will make them again...or I will be able to use my pan again.  The oven I used was not my own, so maybe it ran a little hot.....It took me forever to get this out of the pan to throw it away.  Looking forward to this recipe.   I suggest you start checking this at about 15 minutes or you will have a rock to contend with

I love this recipe for its simplicity and adaptability - and of course, great taste! I change it up depending on what I have in the pantry - almonds, walnuts, sunflower kernels, pumpkin seeds, rice kripsies, etc. I've been making these granola bars for almost 2 years and constantly get requests for more.  I made these for a bake sale last year - they were so popular that I had to make them again this year.

My family, friends enjoyed these tremendously!  They are simple to make and very adaptable to whatever you've got in the pantry.  I would recommend these to any busy parent for school lunches or an anytime snack or even an on the go breakfast when you are running late.  Try these today!

With all the good reviews I can't believe this one is a dud!  It tasted like eating solid oatmeal.  And it really needs some salt and maybe some flavoring.  I may try it someday using actual GRANOLA which would make it granola bars.  This is not granola bars, this is oatmeal bars.  Maybe if you love oatmeal you will enjoy these, just be sure to add some salt.

I have made these 3 times and each time a little different. The first 2 times I only used 1/2 can of milk and while good, this time I used it all because I added more goodies. I mix some sesame seeds, ground flax seed and about 3 tablespoons of peanut butter to the nuts (cashews, almonds, pecans , walnuts and a few macadamias), cranberries and choc. chips. One time I also added a few mini marshmallows since my kids love them. Not too many but enough to make them want to eat them more. I am also using reg. rolled oats and they are fine to me. I guess you could toast them . We really enjoy these and they have become a staple in my childrens lunch box.

this is a great flexible recipe but you must grease the pan very well and don't let it cool before you cut it. reduce the cooking time to 15 mins and use less sweetened condensed milk (it was pretty sweet) even though i couldn't get mine out of the pan after baking it my kids loved it and just chipped away at it till it was gone.

These are yummy. My only problem is I was expecting a healthy granola bar and instead it's a dessert bar, very similar to a Magic Bar/7-Layer Bar/Kris Kringle. Still good, just not what I was looking for.

LOVE this recipe. I had to make a few changes, as I only had a 10 oz can of condensed milk, but they are great. I am a University student, and I made these for "back to school"; I will def. make them again :)

NOTES: I have made these a bunch of times, but always use parchment. This time I didnt, and I regret it. Always use parchment paper, and I like to re-bake the middle ones to make them crunchy on all sides.

Super easy!  My 5 yr old and 8 yr olds helped me with this!  We chose to use a cup each of reeses pieces, raisins, and sunflower seeds.    I greased the jelly roll pan with crisco very well and followed the suggestions of wifetomaleRN and turned upside down with foil.  The bars still stuck to the pan - I scored the edges and twisted pan like an ice cube tray and they came out.  They are cooling now but we have all been eating them already.    We will definately be making again and seeing how many variations we can make!  I might add more dry ingredients next time to see if it will help get them out of the pan easier.

Very nice tasting and lots of room for ingredient options.  The husband really loved it.  I thought it came out more like a square in terms of sweetness.  I make this as a treat granola bar occasionally and save the healthy no oil, no sugar recipe for the kids.

These are excellent!!   These bars really keep you feeling full.  Also, so easy to make!  I follow the recipe and add 1/2 cup wheat germ, 1 cup of any cereal on hand(adds some extra whole grain goodness), and a splash of vanilla.  Oh, I also use fat free condensed milk and omitted the butter.  I love these and can't stop eating them!   My 1 year old son loves these!   Don't worry, I crush the almonds pretty fine, so he won't choke on them.  Awesome recipe!  Thanks!!

Very good recipe!  I took out the butter and the chocolate chips, added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts - 1/4 cup chopped almonds - 1/4 cup pecans - 1/4 cup shelled sunflower seeds and replaced the cranberries with raisins.    Of course, the best thing about this recipe is its versatility.

Mmm, I think this will be my new favorite breakfast. I eat a ton of store bought granola bars and hope to make these frequently; a little more healthy, a little less sugar and salt. These turned out 1/2 way between an oatmeal cookie and one of those store bought fiber bars that I love but are just a little too sickeningly sweet. I used reduced fat condensed milk, 1/2 c of wheat germ, substituted in 2 packets of maple brown sugar oatmeal, added a little brown sugar, used margarine instead of butter, greased pan in margarine (edges came out nice n buttery), added a little salt, a cap of canola oil, a bit more than 1/2 c of coconut, 2/3 c of pb chips and my secret ingredient a single serve packet of crushed honey roasted peanuts. Wow! sugar salt oats and peanutty can't go wrong there. Next time I want to cut back on sugar and add a little honey. I really like sweet things but at least 1/2 the store bought kind are just too sugary. These were sweet but felt denser and healthier. I was worried would be too crunchy and crumbly but I cut it right out of oven and delicately removed the bars with a knife and fork and they stayed together. They were a consistency that I could even squish the pieces that fell off back on so definitely more chewy or brownie-cookie like than hard and crunchy. I bet you could use some oil and maybe a little corn or rice syrup and protein powder and peanut butter and make it more like a pb cliff bar. Can't wait to share with my bf on fishing trip tomorrow!

These were excellent! I didn't have quick oats, so I made some simple granola with 3 c. old fashioned oatmeal, 1/2 c. ground flax seed, 1/2 c. wheat germ, 1/2 c. coconut flakes, a little agave nectar and a couple tbsp canola oil, baked on 300 for 30 minutes (stirring 1/2 way through). I let it cool, then made the bars per the recipe, using a mixture of macadamia nuts, crasins and cho. chips. Fabulous recipe and not too sweet, either! Thanks!

Definitely an amazing recipe.  I got it made inside 30 minutes the first time, and it came out great.  I use a cranberry-nut mix from the local store and add two tablespoons of vanilla and 1 tbsp of cinnamon and nutmeg each.  Highly recommended.

These are good but not outstanding. They are a little bland. I didn't use butter or chocolate chips but added lots of dried fruit, sesame seeds & flax seed. I will make again because I would rather feed my kids these than the store bought kind.

this is a great recipe easy and yummy.  I add different kinds of dried fruits and different nuts. I use fat free condensed milk, coconut oil instead of butter.  I have even used different kinds of rolled grains. If you want it to be chewy, put in more fruits or even a sweetened coconut helps with how moist you want the bar. It also helps if you heat up the liquid and have the dry mix all together and mix it slowly and evenly. enjoy :)

simple, great, and fast. No messes! You can make so many variations. I like chocolate and peanut butter. The only problem is that they go fast. Also great to make with young children.

Excellent, Easy recipe- and really versatile.  The first time I made them I added wheatgern instead of the almonds- probably only 1/2 cup though(no nuts at school) and then yesterday I added 1/3 c ground flax and some dried apricots, in addition to the craisins- My girls and husband LOVE them- great snack for school!

I love this recipe! So versatile. I use cranberry trail mix in it, and add extra oatmeal to make drier, not as sweet bars. Just love them, and so do my friends and family! I also like to add a touch of cinnamon and vanilla. Made them with low-fat sweet. con. milk today, and they were still faboulous. Thank you! Also - I line my pan with tinfoil or parchment paper, to prevent sticking. That way I don't have to oil the pan.

Yum!  I used the fat free condensed milk so they weren't too sweet.  Will definitely try different ingredients for variety, although the cranberry chocolate chip was very good!  Want to try peanut butter.  Will definitely be making these for grab-n-go breakfasts, and would be great to take camping too!

The hardest part about making these was shopping for the ingredients. I made them for a meeting and was asked for the recipe 4x. I used the parchment paper which made it very easy to remove from the pan. I have never used parchment before and now I don't know how I cooked without it. I plan to keep these bars on hand for lunches and grandkids. An easy recipe to "play" with. Apricots, pineapple, pecans, flax seed....

i only used chocolate chips and rice puffs instead of dried fruits or nuts, but it came out yummy! It was a bit too sweet with the condensed milk even though I used only 1 cup of chocolate chips and unsweetened rice puffs - but everyone else said they liked it so they were either being nice or my taste buds were being to sensitive to the sweetness! I liked that there was no flour in this recipe compared to others. I left out the butter and added half a mashed banana which added a hint of banana flavor - i might use a full banana next time, half the condensed milk, and half something else to keep everything sticky without oversweetening - perhaps unsalted peanut butter?

LOVE this recipe.  Very easy and flexible so you can add whatever you want.  Other than the oats and the condensed milk, everything else can be optional and substitued as desired.  And very good too!!  So much better than store bought.

I thought these were really good! I left out the coconut but I used raisins, semi-sweet choco chips, and almonds slivers. I also added about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and about 1/4 tsp cinnamon and it was delicious! I just wish there was something to use besides sweetened condensed milk, that is the most unhealthy part of the whole thing. I also added 1/4 cup wheat germ for some fiber. My next batch will be cranberries, raisins, pecans, and walnuts. Healthy healthy!

Very good and easy.  I have made them several times, and enjoyed them every time.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because of the strong sweetened condensed milk taste that I wish I could get rid of.  Any substitution for the SCM I've tried hasn't yielded favorable results.

Not sure what I did wrong with this recipe but it did not stick together very well :{ It has enough "glue" but it seems like it didn't harden enough to keep them from bending. May be I should have baked it longer. The mixture is pretty good though!

This is a wonderful recipe!  It is so easy to make.  I used a large cookie sheet so the bars were thinner and crispy.  I liked the tip about using waxed paper to press the dough out on the cookie sheet.  As suggested, I increased the oatmeal to 4 cups and omitted the butter. I have used dried cherries, dried berries in the recipe along with nuts.  This recipe was liked at work that I have shared this recipe with many co-workers.

I made these for my daughter who is a cross country runner and eats a lot of bars for snacks. Trying to get away from the unhealthy fats and sugars added to store bought products....one word...amazing! I too added my favorites from my cupboard and they turned out irresistible. You can't go wrong, just stick with the proportions and you're good to go! I'll make them again for her definitely but someone needs to hide them from me!

I used almonds, raisins, sunflower seeds and chocolate chips. My kids and husband loved them. I am not allowed to buy store bought bars anymore. I used low fat sweeten condensed milk. Turned out great. I loved them too. Think I will do a tropical one with flaked coconut, and dried pineapple and mangoes. The recipe is versatile!

Easy to make and good to eat.  I followed others suggestions on cooling.  I did not let them cool in the pan, after taking them out of the oven I cut them with a rolling pizza slicer and turned over on a cooling rack using aluminum foil.  They came out perfect.

Wow! I was so drawn to the flexiblity of this recipe. I went to see what I had available and thought I would wing it. I had maple flavored instant oatmeal only and I think that was a fabulous "only" because it added alot of flavor! I had a few packages of slivered almonds so I toasted them up. I used around a cup of Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate chips and around a cup of Quaker Oats and Honey granola. I used my chopper to chop up the almonds and the chocolate chips and added that plus the granola to the maple flavored oats with the sweetened condensed milk. It was AMAZING! Wow! I am sold! I pressed it into an 11 X 9 glass dish using wax paper and I cooked it exactly 20 minutes. I cut after 5 and it seemed like maybe it was going to be a bit crumbly but after it was completely cooled they were perfect. I've been packing them in my son's lunch with wax paper and then some aluminum foil around them and his friends are stealing! I can't wait to make it again and mix up the ingrediens a bit!

Definitely easy!  Mine turned out tasty but crunchy.  I didn't use melted butter so that's perhaps why.  I added orange-flavored cranberries, cinnamon raisin almonds, rice crispies, corn flakes, oatmeal, chocolate chips and the sweetened condensed milk.  One of my two boys liked it.  I waited about 10 minutes to cut them which was not a good idea--5 minutes would have been better.

Can anyone say yum!? These were so chewy, and that made me very happy due to the simple fact that I really don't like cruchy ones. As you open the oven, the smell of the dried cherries fills up your body. I'm not too crazy about flaked coconut, nor almonds or chocolate chips (for the chocolate, not in my granola bars at least haha), so instead I added dried cranberries, like stated in the recipe,  dried cherries, glazed pecans, flax seeds, and sunflower seeds. Wow is all my vegetarian trail mix loving self can say. This recipes is like an open canvas to whatever you want to add to your granola bars, for everyone has his or her own taste. Thanks again!

These are awesome. I used pecans instead of almonds, because that's what I had, and chopped up regular chocolate chips because I didn't have mini's. These are going to become a regular. They are so tasty and easy to make. I'll never buy granola bars again.

So very easy to make and nicely flexible.  The recipe can be altered according to taste rather simply. As another reviewer said, you just need about 4 cups of whatever you like.  Thanks!

Very good, but alot of the condensed milk kind of ended up settling at the bottom, has kind of a white top coat, maybe I just didn't stir enough.  Also I think I will try tweaking the fillings as these made by recipe are a little too sweet for me.  Will make many times again though.

I love oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and this is such a quick and easy substitute.  I make these bars when I go to functions, because they are full of heart healthy oats and I don't have to mess with sugar, flour, and eggs.  I haven't met one person who doesn't love them!

My family and I love this recipe!  It is so easy but really delicious.  It's also very healthy in my opinion so I'm so happy my daughter really likes it.  This one is a keeper for sure.  I'll be making this often and I want to try some other nuts or fruit with it.

These bars make a great filling breakfast on the go. I added almonds, walnuts, sesame seeds, and cranberries. Mine seemed a little too dense though--next time I think I'll add some crisp rice to lighten them up. Wonderfully versatile!

Very good!  I added 1 1/2 c rice crispies, 3/4 c Bear Naked All Natural Granola, 2T wheat germ, 2T flax seed, and left out the coconut, chocolate chips and raisins.  They were SO good. Only gave 4 stars because they aren't very healthy as written, but this is a great base recipe that can easily be modified to suit your taste.  I didn't have any problem with crumbling, sogginess, or sticking to the pan that some reviewers mentioned.  Next time I'm going to try using evaporated milk and honey instead of the sweetened condensed milk.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are simple to make, tasted great,and won't fall apart provided they are pressed down enough prior to baking and not cutting them until they are completely cooled.  I found them to be very rich though, almost like a candy bar!

UPDATE....I cooked longer and they were PERFECT!  Changed rating to a 5.   ORIGINAL REVIEW....The reason I gave a 4 instead of 5 is because the cook time wasn't enough. I cooked for 23 minutes and they are so chewy that they fell apart, however, they taste GREAT!! I'll make again and cook longer. I used Trader Joes trail mix w/cashews, almonds, dried cherries & cranberries. Also added some choc chips. REALLY great taste.  I will rereview after I cook longer.  UPDATE: Made them again, exactly the same but cooked until edges were brown.  PERFECT!  LAYERED the pan w/Pam then after cooling just a few minutes I turned it upside down and they fell right out.  Picture perfect.

These are great.  I put coconut, cranberries, raisins, chocolate chips, pecans, flax seeds, and whey powder in them.  I had one for breakfast along with some fruit and wasn't hungry again until dinner! I doubled the recipe and baked them in a jelly roll pan (cookie sheet with sides)which I heavily oiled with vegatable oil.  I found that I did have to almost double the cooking time probably because they were really thick bars.  Great recipe and really easy!

I love this recipe because I always have the ingredients on hand, and it is so easy to modify. I use rolled oats, and just put them in the food processor on pulse three or four times, and it works just as well as the quick-cooking oats. I also took out the butter to make the bars lower in fat, and didn't notice a difference!

last week i tried the "playgroup" granola bars and they were a big disappointment.  i was hesitant to try another homemade bar but the condensed milk made me a little more confident because i love it!  i'm so glad i tried these!!  i used 2.5c oatmeal and 1c crushed special K for added crunch.  i actually used the berry one and crushed up the berries... sooo good.  added 1/2c dark choc chunks, chopped almonds, craisins and a small bit of grapenuts for extra fiber.  these don't taste healthy at all!!  low fat condensed milk and very little butter make these far more wholesome than the bars i buy and way cheaper.  i did bake them the full 25min cause i wanted them crunchy but they are a little too hard to bite!  probably the 20 minutes would be perfect.

Great flavor and very easy to make (delicious with walnuts and cranberries), but too sweet for my taste.  Also the bars crumbled to pieces.  If I make them again I think I'll make them much thinner so they bake all the way through and maybe then they'll stick together better.

I am not a fan of these granola bars. I would rate them 2 stars, but husband is eating them and says they are pretty good, so I guess I can give 3 stars.  I doubt the rest will be eaten up before I have to throw them away, they are just very bland.  I will not make these again, and stick with my other recipes for snack bars.

I was looking for a somewhat healthy recipe for in-between-class snacks while I'm at the university.  I used macadamia nuts instead of almonds, reduced the chocolate chips to 2/3 cup, used 2/3 cup craisins instead of 1/2 cup, used fat free sweetened condensed milk and SmartBalance instead of butter.  Everything else I did the same.  I love these and will make them again and again.  I hope to toy with variations because they could be limitless. :)

They were good... but a little too sweet for our taste.  I think next time i will try just "condensed milk" instead of "sweetend"

I just made these bars and stayed with the original recipe, except that I used margarine made with olive oil, instead of butter.  I really liked the bars and used parchment paper in the pan so that I didn't have any trouble getting them out of the pan.

This looks almost exactly like my mom's recipe only she adds a couple of extra things: sunflower seeds and raisins. I haven't actually had any yet, but they smell delightful and look just like moms.  I made mine with dried cherries, cashews, and dark chocolate chips.

A hint: line a jelly-roll pan with tin foil and then grease it.  Works like a charm and really decreases your cleanup.

These are SO GOOD ans SO Easy! I made them with dried cherries and vanilla chips. There are so many varirtions to adapt this recipe to your taste. This will certiantly save money on all of those expensive granola bars at the store. This is a keeper, I will be making these on a regular basis and the cool thing is if you change a few ingrediants you will never tire of them... They are healthy to, which is always a plus:)

I love this recipe. I've used all kind of different combinations of nuts and fruit and it comes out wonderful. I usually don't add the chocolate chips, they are not needed. You can make these crispy if you lower the oven and bake longer. Make sure you cut them while they are warm! Easy and tasty!

Kinda tasted like a cookie bar.  Would defiantly reduce the amount of chocolate chips next time.  This was super easy to make and will try and change up the ingredients next time.

These are terrific! Like other reviewers, I put it in a jrp, but instead of greasing it, I lined it with parchment paper so it wouldn't stick. Worked great!  Can't have nuts due to allergy so increased the coconut 1/2c and used 1 c plump raisins.  Otherwise, followed recipe to a 'T'. Daughter, who usually can't stand raisins, or anything healthy for that matter, loves these.  Will definitely make these easy bars often, and may change up the ingredients here and there! Thanks for the post!

Just as easy and versatile as other reviews say. Can't wait to experiment more. I warmed the sweetened condensed milk as recommended and it was easy to work with. I sprayed my pan with Pam and they came out with ease. Also used wax paper to press mix firmly into pan... great recipe!

Fantastic granola bars!  I made them exactly as the recipe states, but changed the chocolate chips to vanilla chips.  These are delicious!  My picky family loves them.  My husband shuns anything healthy-looking, immediately expecting a terrible flavor.  My daughter is 2, and well, it has to be good or she won't eat it.  I love that I can change them up and make them as healthy as I please. Also, this was one of the only granola bar recipes on this site that did NOT include honey.  Young children cannot have honey, and it was frustrating wanting to make healthy snacks for my toddler and hitting that road block.  Thank you for this recipe, Aliceyn!  What a winner it has turned out to be!

Wow!!! I love this recipe!!! Made a bunch  I added a cup of oats and 1/2 c of honey to the recipe.  I also cut the chocolate chips and added 1/2 a cup of golden raisins and 1/2 a cup of sunflower seeds in place of chocolate.  I used yogurt butter in place of regular butter!  I also toasted the coconut and almond pieces before adding to mixture! Turned out fabulous!

This is a very versatile recipe. My picky kids love them and it saves me money making bars instead of buying them. I did take another reviewers advice and I pressed them into my jelly roll pan.I sprayed my hands with cooking spray to press the mix into the pans without it sticking to my fingers. I also used pecans and sprinkled the top with cinnamon before baking. I cut them into 24 bars.   Easy recipe for kids too! My 7 year old daughter was able to help me with most of it.

These are SO easy to make.  Right up my alley!!  They are excellent!  It is so nice to know exactly what you are putting in your body!  I will definitely experiment with different ingredients the next time I make them.  Great option!  I do recommend adding a bit of salt to enhance the flavor.  I had sprayed the cake pan and had no problem with sticking.  I used a pizza cutter to cut them while still warm.  I even wrapped some individually so I'd keep my fingers off them.  YUM-YUM!!!

updating my review a couple years later:  Still using this recipe weekly.  I have gotten so lazy about it. I put in 3 cups of oats and 3.5 cups of whatever (nuts/raisins/seeds/chocolate and always coconut) then add the condensed milk.  I skip the butter totally.  How easy is that?? 3 cups of this....3.5 cups of that ...some condensed milk and you're done! try it...it's a great recipe.
my original review said :
scrumptious recipe and wickedly easy! I lined a 9x13 pan with parchment paper and gave it a teeny spray of veg.oil stuff and it literally tipped right out of the pan. I used orange craisins, a little less chocolate chips, almond slivers, coconut and flax seeds. They turned out perfectly for flavour. Only concern?  Browned a bit too much on the edges. Seriously great though...thanks for sharing this and all the tips that went along with it!

Beyond easy to make.  It can really be made in less than 5 minutes.  We used raisins instead of cranberries and I added half pecans/helf almonds.  You could go any way you wanted to though.  They are nice and sweet and hold up very well.  I think that I will use this for some hiking/camping because of how easy they are to make and how portable they are.
Being an accountant by trade, the cost to make these is miniscule when compared to a box of granola bars from the store, and these are so much better tasting.

YUMMY!  These are so good even if you use low fat condensed milk(sweetned) and no butter.  I wanted to eat the whole pan before I put it in the oven.  I ran out of granola but replaced it with fiber one cereal.  The most important part is the condensed milk and the coconut other then that you can totally play around with it.

I really like that this recipe is flexible based on what you want to put in it and have around the house.  I put in chopped peanuts, choc chips and mixed dried fruit.  I'm looking forward to using coconut next time, just didn't have it on hand.  I'll also probably add craisins because they were missing any tart flavor.  They stayed together well after they had cooled, but as others have said, they're not easy to get out of the pan.  I liked it best broken up in vanilla yogurt.  Baked for 22 minutes and I should have gone longer - I would have liked it to be a little more crunchy.  All things to keep in mind for next time!  This is one of those recipes you can experiment with!

This is a fantastic recipe - I make it often but switch out the "additions" to suit whatever cravings I may be having. Very flexible. My only suggestion (hence the 4 star rather than 5 star rating)is to add salt. 1/2 tsp up to a teaspoon depending on the ingredients you use. Thanks for the submission!

This is truly a very easy granola bar to make that tastes great.  I used the fat free sweetened, condensed milk, and left out the butter to make it healthier.  Also dropped the coconut because I don't like it and upped the craisins to a full cup.  I lined the pan with parchment paper and sprayed that with Pam.  I lifted the whole thing right out of the pan and had a clean pan and no sticking.  I plan to use this recipe with our Sunday School kids - simple for them to prepare, bakes quickly, and they'll love eating them too!

I make a recipe similar to this at least once a week for the kids I babysit. They can't get enough. I use 3 cups oats, 1 cup each of coconut and chocolate chips, 2tbls of butter and 1 can condensed milk. Bake for 20minutes and voila!

I split my batch in two... but I didn't want to make bars, I wanted to make rolls.  

The first: currants, cashews, sunflower seeds rolled in half toasted flax seeds and toasted sesame seeds.

The second: Toasted almonds, toasted pecans, and very lightly toasted coconut flakes (didn't even let them brown, just let them dry out a bit).  

I shaped the rolls in waxed paper as firmly as possible with my hands. Unwrapped and sliced (0.75" diameter x 2.5" long).  Then rolled in seeds/coconut, and finally placed back in a clean sheet of wax paper to secure seeds onto logs and lightly rolled.  This is advised if the bars will be traveling far (living in a glove box of a car, or being shipped).

Placed on cookie sheet and baked at 375 for 7 minutes... until the coconut browned.

Looked and tasted phenomenal! Just took a while to roll. But the inside is chewy and outside lightly crisped, baking time is only 7 minutes and didn't need to get them out of a pan.

Excellent recipe!  I used 2 cups rolled barley flakes for the oats (son has allergy) and toasted them with 1 cup coconut for 5 minutes at 350F. If you were going to use old-fashioned oats, I think this would help too.  I also used 2 cups rice crispies, 1 cup chopped almonds and 1 cup chopped cashews. 
I put it in a jelly roll pan lined with buttered parchment and then placed a sheet of waxed paper on top and used a rolling pin to get them pressed out flat and even.  Then I removed the waxed paper and baked.  The bars ended up being about 1/2 inch thick.  You could also do this in the 9 x 13 pan for thicker bars.  Cut them while still warm.  Wonderful flavor and held together well.  I will make again for sure!

LOVE that this is such a versatile recipe. Last time, I used 2 cups chopped dried apples, a cup of Rice Krispies and added cinnamon. SO good and so easy. Thanks!

I love these!!  They taste great and are so simple to make.  I used fat-free condensed milk (thanks to the reviewer who mentioned that).  I did use my hands to mix them, even though I don't like getting all "dirty" like that, lol.  It was the easiest way.  I used half white chocolate chips, half semi-sweet.  I'm thinking of adapting this recipe into peanut butter granola bars!

I've been trying granola bar recipes and this is the first one that stayed together. Be sure to cut them early and maybe line your pan with parchment. They are a bit tough to get out. I used blueberries and cherries, and a five grain oat mix. Yummy! (update 7/2012) I used old fashioned oats and toasted them a bit as someone else suggested, did not use butter, added a pinch of salt, and warmed the milk can in hot water. I used a jelly roll pan with parchment, but didn't spread to the edges, just formed a square, baked for 18 minutes, ran a pizza cutter through right away, then let cool. Love them.

so yummy, healthy, and easy! i used fat-free condensed milk, ommited the butter, baked in just a cookie sheet, with half-inch walls lined with parchment paper and only used 1 cup coconut and 1 cup almonds, because i didn't have any dried fruit. i also added a drizzle or so of sugar-free syrup for extra taste. i set my timer to bake these for 15 mn, but i probably didnt pull them out until about 22 minutes, which was a mistake because the bottoms were dark brown and the edges were crisp. however, these were still so yummy and full of fiber and i actually got compliments by my family! (it's very rare since everything i make is reduced-calorie in some way) i have this commited to memory! just make sure they don't get crispy on the edges, and they are very sweet, so dont add any sugar! will definitely make again

 i made this recipe again with some ff evap milk with some splenda and also added some cereal, and they turned out soft and a little soggy. i wouldnt use breakfast cereal (maybe thats obvious?) and i would make sure to cook the evaporated milk on heat, til it thickens a bit, if you dont have any condensed milk to use.

These are really good.  I didn't have quick oats so I used old fashioned and they were still great.  I also added  vanilla extract and salt.

sure got the name right on these. they are so easy for the great flavor. i didn't have quick oats, but i ground my oats just barely in my cofee grinder seemed to work great. only used 1/2 cup chocolate chips and that was more than enough. won't use my hands next time to mix, seemed there was more on my hands than in the bowl, sticky sticky!i look forward to using this recipe again,and experimenting with different dried fruits and nuts.

This is now a staple in our house! After mixing the oats with the butter and SCM I halve the recipe and make half chocolate chip peanut butter, and half cranberry, apricot with walnuts! I line my baking sheet with parchement paper before baking so that it's truly nonstick and comes off easily!

What an excellent recipe!  I mixed up two batches in less than 20 minutes.  I used chocolate chips, crushed peanuts, and craisins in one batch, and peanut butter/milk chocolate chips and mini m&m's in the other.  I added wheat germ to both batches for extra fiber.  They turned out wonderfully.  I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a delicious basic recipe that is very flexible. Try adding cinnamon or peanut butter chips rather than the chocolate. Any dried fruit combination will work. Thanks Alycn

These are fantastic!  I didn't have anything on hand except for the chocolate chips and they still tasted awesome!  My family couldn't wait until breakfast to eat them - half the pan was gone the night I made them.  I'm making more tonight with the coconut and almonds!

I mixed dry ingredients in kitchenaid mixer with paddle before adding condensed milk. made my own homemade condensed milk. could have been more than it called for in recipe, therefore
I found it needed more oatmeal, also added more cranberries, some almond slices, chopped pecans.
I heated milk, but that was a mistake. it melted the chocolate chips. would not do that next time.
mixes together very well in mixer.
I will make it again.

This came out great for our first try.  I cannot wait to experiment with different add ins.  I also want to try this with a stone pan for more even heat distribution as there was a definite textural difference from the top to the bottom.  Great recipe though and worth some experimentation.

Made as directed, it wasn't enough liquid/stickiness to  get it to get to stick together-added more-ended up being too much like a dessert not a granola bar.  It was tasty though.

I love, love, love this recipe. I've had a granola bar for breakfast practically every day for the last 15 years, and these are far and away the best. I took Aliceyn's advice and tweaked it to my own tastes, though the basics are the same. I sub peanut butter or coconut oil for the butter. I split the oaty ingredients between rolled oats, quick-cooking oats and crispy rice cereal. For the treats, I throw the following into a 4-cup measure: shredded coconut, walnuts, peanuts, flax seed, chopped dates, chocolate chips,  Decas Farms baking cranberries with orange oil, espresso chocolate chips and caramel chips. The orange-flavored cranberries and the espresso take the recipe over the top in goodness. So many thanks for pure pleasure in a bar form!

I didn’t use my hands which may have contributed to them falling apart & not sticking together. I did press into the pan but they aren’t coming out very well. I like the taste. I will try again some other time & definitely use my hands.

Much better than store-bought, and you can add different nuts and dried fruit to give you a variety of bars.  Great as a snack or quick breakfast food.

I took the base recipe of the oats, condensed milk and butter and changed the extra ingredients. I made peanut butter ones, which were amazing! I made cranberry almond. There's many possibilities to what you can add to make different varieties!

These are good but they are really more like a cookie bar than a granola bar. They are very sweet and remind me of a seven layer bar. I made them exactly as written and baked them for 22 minutes until they were golden brown and they stayed too soft to travel with.

The granola bars were very good. I slightly reduced the amount of chocolate chips.  The coconut added sweetness too. They were dry the day I baked them but perfect after they sat in the refrigerator overnight. This recipe can also be a good base recipe for different variations.

I followed the recipe as written.  I baked them on the light side because I was looking for chewy rather than crunchy.  They were yummy!!  Will definitely make again!

I used wife2malern's tips. It's a long, but very helpful review. I addded dried apricots, cinnamon. No butter. Put milk can in hot water while mixing other ingredients. I made this with my 3 year old charge as a fun activity. Her dad even texted me later and said he couldn't stop eating them! Warning though, they are high calorie. I guess that's why they're so delicious!

Love this I have made them a lot, like most I change things up by adding whatever I have on hand. This batch is maraschino cherries, chocolate peanut butter chips. I now do a double batch too share with neighbors and found it much easier to line the pan with parchment paper and cover with a piece to really flatten it evenly in the pan and because I share with others I feel better my hands aren't all over it especially with cold and flu season and it bakes and cuts better when it is all solid and know soft parts.

Very yummy and easy recipe. I followed the recipe but I did play around and added a pantry full of goodies. Raisins, flax seed, sunflower seeds, chopped walnuts and pecans, a tbsp of honey, 3 tbsp of chunky peanut butter and some red and green holiday mini m&ms. I did use the sweetened condensed milk and butter and the oats were old fashioned (all I had in hand) so perhaps the heavier texture is from not using the quick oats, but I still love these. My husband and I will enjoy these on our hunting trip! Thank you for this recipe I never knew it could be this easy!

I loved this recipe. Simple and uses ingredients I have on hand. What I did first is to toast the oatmeal 350 for 10 minutes and let the can of sweetened condensed milk sit in a bowl with warm water. Then I mixed all the remaining ingredients using coconut oil for the butter. I added a splash of vanilla and a dash of salt. Then I stirred in the oatmeal and finally the warmed sweetened milk. I pressed firmly into a parchment lined 9x13 pan and baked for 20 minutes, rotating the pan once. I cooled the pan ten minutes and lifted the bars out of the pan and cut into bars. Then let them set as is till cool and placed in little snack bags. Nice and chewy. Not crumbly at all. No refrigeration needed and my college age grandchildren love them. WIN WIN

I've made this recipe twice now and found that there is a difference if you substitute with low fat condensed milk and omit the butter - don't do it! I would suggest instead using dulce de leche flavoured condensed milk.

If it's too dry, add half a cup of applesauce and shorten the cooking time. Because of allergies we made it with pepitas(pumpkin seeds), flax seeds, applesauce(flax seed absorbs moisture), and butterscotch chips. They are wonderful. We are making them regularly now.

Thanks for this easy recipe!  I used 2 tbsp of coconut oil instead of butter and I added some cinnamon and flax seeds to the recipe. I did not use chocolate chips or coconut. I used raisons,  cranberries and almonds.   I also used parchment paper as some suggested . I baked mine for 24 mins bc I prefer them crunchy and they came out great. Some fell apart a but but that's ok because I could use it as a cookie as well. It's all going down  the same stomach! Will definitely make again and again and again!

We have been making this recipe for ages.  It's so versatile.  You can use any dried fruit and nut that you prefer.  We like cherry  Cranraisins with pecans and white chocolate chips.  Butterscotch with peanuts and raisins is great too.  We always us coconut though.  Love Love Love this recipe.

My son and I made these last night and they are delicious! We substituted chopped pecans for the almonds as that’s what we had on hand. I lined a 9x13 pan with parchment paper. Definitely wait to serve until they are cool as they will crumble if you get impatient like we did and try to serve them too soon! Next time I’m going to try making them in an 11 x 17 half sheet pan as others have suggested.

This was my first time making granola bars and I will definitely make them again!  These were delicious and sooo easy to make.  I had peanuts and shelled pumpkin seeds on hand, so I chopped them up and used them instead of almond slivers.  Everything else was done according to the recipe.

I am making these again right now.  My whole family loved them.  They are so good.  I made it just like the recipe said. They are super easy to make.   I have two picky teenagers.  They are both athletes.  I usually get them the store bought granola bars.  Not anymore.  They both said these taste way better and my son begged me last night to make some more.  Now I have 2 boxes of store bought sitting on my pantry shelf.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I made these for girl's camp this past summer, and the girls loved them.   No nuts were allowed, so I subbed pumpkin seeds for the almonds.  These were easy to make, cut up and package in individual plastic bags for the girls to grab 'n go.   I also made a  variety adding cinnamon and dried apple bits in place of cranberries, and they were great also.  Top rated!

Added 1/2 cup of coconut instead of 1 cup and salted. Otherwise it is too sweet without a bit of salt

I made this with honey instead of the condensed milk. But I used half the amount of what the recipe calls for. It turned out great!

I made this recipe for my mom who loves chewy granola bars.  She says that they are perfect: not too sweet, not too chewy, and "lots of good stuff."  Of course I played with the original recipe, substituting mom's favorites for the original ingredients, and I baked them for 18 minutes.  Great recipe.  Thank you!

BEST ever!  I used the recipe as a starting place i.e. 3 cups oats and 3 cups of dried fruit and nuts combined.  I added dried coconut; 1 Tablespoon honey, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, cinnamon and a very small amount of grated nutmeg.

These were such a hit with my family (3 teens plus hubby).  I've made them 3 times now substituting or replacing items like nuts, coconut,raisins and chocolate chips.  Each batc was still a hit. I just finished making a pan of these when a neighbor stopped by unexpectedly.  She was so impressed that I was making my own granola bars and when I offered her one w/ a cup of coffee she thought I was the greatest for making these and inviting her in.  It's nice to know they were served as a gateway to a nice friendship.

I didn't have coconut so I used shaved carrots. Otherwise I made the recipe as directed. It's good but really sweet and my bars never set up.

Have made this many times. I use a cup of raw quinoa I need place of oats. No complaints. You can throw in whatever floats your boat! These are great and the tip on heating the evaporated milk is wonderful ??

Super yummy! They made a lot of bars, maybe a little too many for just me and my other-half! I tweaked the recipe by adding raisins and honey.. i guess they turned a bit on the flapjack side rather than a granola bar but still very yummy and will definitely make again.

Have you noticed how SMALL the granola bars in the stores have gotten over the years? I swear, they kept the wrapper the same size, but the bar inside has shrunk! Well, I'm not buying them anymore. These granola bars are so much better than store bought, and no preservatives or other things that I can't pronounce. They were so simple to whip together. Two things I did slightly different . . . I chopped up the dried cranberries a bit, so they would distribute more evenly, I used a spoon to mix everything together (rather than my hands, as the mixture was quite sticky), and pressed them into the pan with slightly buttered hands. Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!! People could not believe how chewy-bar like these came out.  Very legit.  Made recipe as written for the first batch, and then got a little greedy.  Changed the proportions around and used pecans/brown sugar/cinnamon chips/dates.  Still pretty great though.  My advice - use whatever nuts/fruit/chocolate you want but stay true to the proportion size (except for the coconut - double the amount for sure :)

Edit - next time I will bake them in mini-muffin containers (no cutting required) per another user's suggestion.

Very good recipe.  Lots of flexibility.   I combined several nuts as I didn't have the almonds necessary.  I even added peanut butter to help with the consistency. Nice additional flavor. 

Thx

Loved it! So easy, not too sweet especially when you put a lot of mix ins. Only thing I would recommend is adding 1/4 tsp vanilla extract to the butter before mixing it in.

Like another reviewer mentioned, the bottoms of the bars were slightly mushy. I baked them on parchment paper, so I wonder if that had anything to do with it. Other than that, they were quick, easy, and yummy. A real hit with my somewhat picky five and three year olds.

Before these, I ate a Quaker granola bar every morning. (Literally. Every, single, day.) These are so easy to make, and even easier to customize. This time, I used Flax seed, dried fruit, poppy seeds and nuts. Next time...I'm thinkin' trail mix bars: M&M's, Raisins and Peanuts. They make a large amount-which is good since my family loves them, too.

I love tthis recipe and the flexibility it has. I do like to toast the oats before I mix them in with everything else. It gives it a rich nutty flavor. Toast the 3 cups at 375 degrees for 7-9 minutes. These bars disappear quickly in my house.

I added 1/2 cup each of raisins & dried cranberries, 1 cup mini choc chips, 2 Tbs chia seeds, 1 cup sunflower seeds, 1 Tbsp each vanilla extract & cinnamon, then drizzled maple syrup over this before I put in the oven on parchment paper. Great to customize. I had trouble with the baking time though. I like my granola crunchy but not brick hard either. 25 mins wasn't long enough. I ended up baking this for 53 mins & just now got golden browned edges. My recommendation if you prefer crunchy is to bake for at least 45 mins, turning your pan halfway through.

Tried this recipe today. Very simple and quick. Used a 9x9 baking pan and made 12 good sized bars. As a first attempt, I used semisweet chocolate chips, a little bit of coconut, and honey roasted peanuts for a salty boost of protein. Turned out great, and look forward to making different variations.

Yum!  It's good as is and good with various alternatives!  I did as everyone said and put the milk in hot water until used.

I was very happy with how these turned out! I also added some chopped dried apricots in with the cranberries. I used 60% cacao dark chocolate chips, 1/4 cup of that was white chocolate morsels, leaving them regular sized. I lined the pan with foil and sprayed with cooking spray, making for a very easy cleanup. I wanted a chewy bar, so I baked them for 20-21 min and they were perfect. After they were a little cooled off, I scored with a pizza cutter and fully cut after they cooled completely. These have endless possibilities for add-ins. I'm thinking a little peanut butter would go great here! So much better than the dried out things you get at the store and you control the ingredients! Can't get much better than that! Thanks for the great recipe, Aliceyn!

These taste great, but I have to keep them in the fridge or they fall apart. So, they're not really portable.

These are a great snack because of the nutrients that you get from the fruit and the nuts. Another thing I love is that you can easily alter this recipe to your preferred taste. I only baked them for 22 minutes and they turned out a little too soft and crumbly for my liking, so I would recommend that they bake for the whole 25 minutes.

I omitted the canned milk for whole milk because I hate the taste of how overly rich it is. Unfortunately, I only had salted butter. I added cashews in addition to almonds and I also added white chocolate chips. Before putting it in the oven, I topped them with brown sugar. Finally, I cut the recipe in half because my grandparents are small eaters.

Great recipe!  I basically used the same equation of 3 cups oats to 3 cups extras (almonds, pecans, sunflower seeds, chia seds, chocolate chips and craisens) and instead of butter, I used coconut oil, which added a bit of coconut flavor without it being overwhelming.

Awesome recipe. Like another reviewer added 3 1/2 cups of dry to the oats and condensed milk. We used chocolate chips, coconut and some granola with almond slivers. Kids cant stop eating them!

So simple!  Love the taste. I used 2/3 c mini chic cups  (will use 1/2 c next time), swapped raisins for cranberries and used half almonds, half peanuts.  Yum!  My only problem?  Everything got REALLY stuck to the pan!  I'll try the suggestion to add oat flour after greasing next time...

These were really good I left out the coconut only because I don't like coconut I also found that 13x9 was to big to spread the mixture out and cover the pan so I used a 8x8 and just cooked it a little longer. I will def. make these agin.

These were moist in the middle and just a touch of crunchy on the outside after 20 minutes.  Easy to make also. I'm keeping sw. condensed milk handy so we can whip up a batch anytime.

This is so easy to make! Everyone in my house LOVED the bars, even my very fussy son (who was reluctant to try them) loved them! We like them chewy, they have substance to them and are a nice filling snack! I am so excited at the possibilities with this recipe! Next time I am going to try the sweetened condensed chocolate milk with Reese Peanut butter chips!

This is such a great base for amazing creations!  My daughter has a nut allergy so I used pumpkin puree and pumpkin spices, also added ground flax seed.  Today I made a batch with chocolate chips and chocolate protein powder - amazing!

Do yourself a favour and line tin with parchment paper! My kids loved these. I used dried blueberries and cranberries, and opted for mixed nuts (no peanut blend).

These were definitely easy and quick! They tasted good too, just fell apart easily. I added more wheat germ, but they were still quite crumbly. It was easier than many granola bar recipes though, so props for that! Also easy to experiment with. I added peanut butter/choc chips to half, and cranberries/walnuts to the other half. Both were good!

This was a super easy treat to make, but on the sweeter side.  It was a bit crumbly, but the taste was really nice.  It tasted more like a dessert than a snack to me, but I tend to like less sweet dishes. It is a good basic and easy recipe.

I have to give this recipe the full 5 stars because, altho I felt they were lacking a tiny bit in the flavor department, they turned out a nice soft consistency, I got compliments on them and because they were soooo stinkin' easy to make!

For me, this is probably the most used, best recipe I have found.  I probably make these once a week.  I sometimes change it up a bit and use white chocolate chips, cranberries, raisins, rice krispies, or sunflower seeds. Very versatile. I'll never buy boxed granola bars again.  One little tip to keep them together-after taking them out of the oven, press them
 with back of a large spatula.Thanks for posting!

They had great flavor but fell apart.  I will have to adjust cooking time to see if that will help.  I also used homemade coconut sweetened condensed milk so that could have made a different texture.  I will make these again, hopefully I can get them to come out as bars. Either way they will get eaten my husband loved them.

The entire family gave this recipe a thumbs up. I did not put in nuts because they don't really like them, so I added raisins, making it a chocolate/coconut/raisin bar. Nice, easy recipe and I can see that it would be pretty forgiving if you decide to "do your own thing." I would like to experiment with some options like bits of caramel, crushed pretzels, or cereal like Chex or Cheerios. As others did, I used the Fat Free sweetened condensed milk and it was fine. 

I used a 9.5 x 13.5 glass pan. I lined it with Reynolds Non-stick Pan Lining Paper, which is foil on one side fused to parchment on the other. Using the parchment side up, I packed the mixture down in the pan. I left enough paper sticking up to grab when the bars came out of the oven. After scoring them into bars, I lifted them out of the pan by the paper ends and put them on a wire rack to cool. They came out well. I baked them about 23-25 min in a gas oven. They were just a little brown on the edges and quite chewy!

My family LOVES these! they are so easy to make and super yumy. My only question is if the condensed milk can be substituted for something with less sugar, say peanut butter??

I wasn't a big fan of the sweetened condensed milk, it gave the bars a strange, sickly sweet flavor. May try making these again, substituting honey for some or all of the milk.

Made this one twice. The first time, I must have used regular oats and it was not good at all, tasted very strongly like sweetened condensed milk (which I generally like, but not good here) and uncooked oats and nothing like a granola bar should taste like. It was such a fail that it took me at least a year to try them again. I just made them again with quick oats, used chopped pecans, coconut, mini chocolate chips, some leftover rice chex crushed up... a little of everything, plus a splash of vanilla and an egg to help bind it together. No butter though. They turned out great! I'm so excited this worked this time, and will definitely make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  I used rice crispies, chocolate chips, walnuts, and coconut for the add-ins.  Where has this granola bar recipe been all my life?  :)  I may try using slightly less oats and add-ins next time to see if I can get the bars a bit less crumbly.

These are more like cookies than granola bars - very sweet.  They taste very good though. I used chopped walnuts instead of almonds and skipped the cranberries.  I would maybe try these with dessicated (unsweetened) coconut flakes rather than the sweetened kind, to cut the sweetness a little.

So good, but I needed to cook them longer. Five more minutes might have helped them to hold up as bars.

Very easy and versatile! In Canada, the cans of condensed milk are just over 10 oz rather than 14, so I only put in one can, and they turned out just fine!

This recipe is AWESOME thanks so much for sharing!  I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate, a little bit of cinnamon and honey drizzled on top.
You seriously can't mess this one up, and you can make it what you want it to be! dessert OR healthy snack

I line the pan w/ parchment paper which makes life a lot easier. My kids beg for these (and they are now adults) I used to have to make these weekly for my sons baseball team when he was in college. Adjust your oven temp depending on what you 'load' these with.

These were ok, but I found them too sweet for my taste.  They were very simple to make, though.  Also, I think you really need to watch the baking time, depending on how chewy/crispy you desire them.

My husband and I can't get enough of these! The first time I made them with almonds/cashews/peanut butter chips and again with peanut butter chips/chocolate chips/almonds both times were sooo delicious. For chewier bars I added a bit of brown sugar and honey and some almond milk the second time around and they tasted EXACTLY like quaker chocolate chip granola bars.

Overall they tasted great, I found them to be a little "wet." I cooked until brown but they didn't hold together like ones Ive made in the past. I used evaporated milk and fresh cranberries, and added 2 tablesoons of sugar. I also used rolled oat but let the oats and milk sit for awhile before adding everything else so they would be soft.

So easy to put together and make. The entire house thinks it's delicious. I left out the butter and used low fat sweetened condensed milk. I think you can easily make similar substitutions of fruit or nut types. It's definitely something I'll make again.

I wouldn't call this healthy by any means, it is made with a whole can of straight up sugar, but it is a nice treat/dessert. I add a slightly scrambled egg to the mixture before baking. Makes the bars exceptionally moist. Cranberry/walnut/white chocolate chip has been the favorite combo.

These were nice and chewy but a little bland. It was probably my fault because I didn't have chocolate chips so I used raisins. I used homemade condensed milk made with splenda and applesauce in place of butter. Plan to make again with chocolate or butterscotch chips and I think they will be much better.

Great recipe and I liked the fact that they're not too sweet, like the store bought ones are.  I did the original recipe, but I'm making plans for other variations soon.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These are really good! I don't make them too often though otherwise I'll eat them until they're gone my husband might get a few lol. I've added several different dried fruits and so far mixed berries and dates has been our favorite. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I omitted the chocolate chips and almonds and added wheat germ, pecans and raisens.  We liked them better the second time around but these are great bars nonetheless.

These are awesome!!!  I divided them into twelve, much bigger than store bought, bars and wrapped them up with a little plastic wrap and every morning my husband and son were eager to eat their "breakfast-on-the-go".  A great way to have breakfast during the busy week!

We enjoyed the flavour of these granola bars, but they were awfully hard to get out of the well greased pan in one piece: they tended to crumble. Made them more than once with no better results; used parchment paper and they stuck to that too. Rather sweet for my taste, will stick with my old favourites.

They were OK - the taste of the sweetened condensed milk wasn't the yummiest.  My 7-year old boy really liked them though.

Amazing!  So quick to make.  I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk and left out the cranberries only because my kids won't eat them.  I sprayed my hand with no-stick butter flavored spray and firmly pressed the mixture into my 13X9 pan.  I didn't have any trouble with the bars crumbling.

These are delicious granola bars, I only gave it 4 stars because mine were pretty crumbly and didn't stick together like a bar. Still, the whole pan was gone within a few days :) I used a trail mix with cherries, pecans, and almonds, and I also added some choc. chips and coconut. I felt a little creative so I added a teaspoon each of vanilla extract and cinnamon. Yum Yum! These are great, filling snacks for long nights of homework! I also liked them from a budget perspective- you can bascially add whatever is in leftover in your cupboard and you don't need a lot of "extra" ingredients that I tend not to have as a college student :)

This is a great tasting easy recipe.  I omitted the butter like other reviews suggested.  I used 1 1/2 cups craisens, 1 cup raisens, and 1 cup semi sweet choc chips.  They are delicious... I plan on making several other varieties.

I liked them and I used nonfat condensed milk and they were still great.  I over cooked them or they would have been perfect.  I added peanuts to part of it and that was by far the favorite part.  It was really alot easier than I thought.

I've become addicted to these. They are so flexible and so delicious. We add about 1/4 wheat germ and use non-fat sweetened condensed milk. I let the kids choose the flavor. Our favorite so far is dried cranberries, white chocolate chips, milk chocolate chunks and dried cherries. Yum!

I added 1 cup of sliced almonds, 1 cup mini chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup dried cherries to mine, and they were great. Very moist from the coconut and dried fruit. I used fat free condensed milk to make room for the chocolate chips!

EXCELLENT!!  This is a very good base for granola bars.  I made a half batch because I didn't know whether I'd like it or not, but forgot and put in a whole can of sweetend condensed milk.  Came out great even with the mistake.  I added 1/2 cup raisins in place of almonds and a little less than a 1/3 cup of choc chips - rather have more fruit than choc.  Will make again and will experiment with other mix ins.

the only reason i'm giving this 2 stars is because it tasted alright but i think there were too many chocolate chips and the sweetened condensed milk hardened the bars too much

This was excellent.  I made these for my man who is a big granola bar fan.  He loves the playgroup bar recipe but these were just as good. For me it was easier to make.  The condensed milk was the only liquid.  I made it with 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips.  I also used peanuts instead of almonds.  I used did raisins in place of cranberries.  It all worked out great.  Granola bars are so easy to improvise with whatever you like.  The condensed milk was fat free but you would never know it.  I am not sure this batch will last the weekend.  Yummy!

A dummy-proof recipe indeed! Super easy and very versatile. I added 1/2 C of wheat germs and 1/2 C of oat bran to bump up the nutritional value, also instead of coconut flakes, I substituted it with sunflower seeds. What a great snack!

Flavor good - I used chocolate chips, macadamian nuts, banana chips, and then 2 1/2 cups oatmeal and 1 cup special K with berries - but it was super dry - my daughter thinks she broke a tooth eating it.  Don't think I will make it again, although it might be ok if I pour some milk over it and eat it like cereal.

Really good and SUPER easy to make. Instead of adding separate ingredients, I just bought a bag of trail mix (whole almonds, cranberries, sunflower seeds, etc) and mixed it with the coconut, chocolate, oats, milk and butter. Make sure you really grease the pan very well and press it down hard. I cooked it for about 35-40 minutes and then cut it into bars, and cooled it before I removed them from the pan. I brought the bars to work and everyone loved them. I will definitely be making these again!

Everyone loved these.  I made 2 different versions; one with chocolate chips and toffee chips, and the other with dried cranberries that had different flavors. A big hit with adults and kids.

I have tried 2 other recipes from this website and these by far are the best!  nice and chewy like granola bars should be. I even used long cooking oats and they turned out fine.  but I think I will try them with quick oats just to compaire the texture. I added dried blueberries instead of cranberries and they were very good. I also added 1/4cup of mini mnm's for the kids.  I will be making these all the time, thanx!

These are quick & easy to make, very good and easily customizable.  I've left out the nuts because the kids can't take nuts to school, but otherwise made the recipe as-is the first time.  My family now like them with a little extra coconut and dates instead of the cranberries.  If you're not using parchment paper to line your pan, manke sure you DO NOT leave these bars in the pan very long. I accidentally left them in overnight and they had to be chiselled out of the pan.

These were very simple and very good.  They also lasted 2 weeks so they served their purpose since we do not eat more than 2 a day.  I added 1/3 c. more coconut and I used dried strawberries, apricots, cranberries and cherries.  The strawberries were amazing.  I will be making these again very soon!

This was a fun and easy recipe to make with my 5-year old son, and they turned out delicious!  Even my husband, who does not like coconut, thought they were great.  We'll definitely make these treats again!

This recipe was super easy and delicious.  I used dried cherries instead of cranberries and I did not use any butter.  I made these a couple days ago and everyone who tries them wants the recipe.  I am a very busy high school teacher and coach so a healthy, easy snack that is easy to transport is greatly appreciated.  Thanks for the recipe!

Ill add chocolate chips next time I think.

I followed the recipe exactly, but these came out gummy, extremely sticky, and yet somehow also very hard and tough. Disappointing and a waste of good ingredients. Not sure what went wrong; guess I'll keep looking for our granola bar recipe.

Great, easy recipe, but I like it much better with regular oats rather than quick-cooking oats. For the extras, I use 1 c. chocolate chips, 1 c. raisins, 1 c. honey-roasted peanuts, and 1/2 c. sunflower seeds. Great snack.

I wasn't overly impressed with this recipe. The taste was ok, but it was so crumbly I couldn't get them out of the pan. It works fine as a granola but I was really looking for a good granola bar that would hold together.

delicious!!  i had some trouble getting it out of the pan post-oven though.  i used non-stick cooking spray to coat the 9x13 pan, but half of the mix came out and half stuck to the bottom of the pan.  i think i'll either cook them longer (they were in 23 min) or let them sit longer than 5 min before trying to get them out and cut them.  i also used fat free sweent and condensed milk...they were yummy!  (not sure if that was my problem though...) however, my husband liked the chunks of granola enough to ask for them again though!!

Turned out great! I used dried cherry chunks and dark chocolate chips. I also added diced pecans and walnuts instead of almonds(since I didn't have any on hand). Fabulous! Way better, healthier and much cheaper than buying in the stores.

I LOVE this is recipe!  I use less sweetened condensed milk and leave out the butter.  I have made it with every dried fruit and nut under the sun.  Blueberries and almonds are my favorite.  Also choc chips are a nice treat.

These are good. They hit the sweet spot, without being over the top. 
 
I only used 3 cups of oats, 1 cup of Special K cereal & 100g chopped dates. As well as 1 tbs butter and low fat sweetened condensed milk. 

The oats are pretty energy dense, so I'm going to substitute other cereals next time and add dried apricots as well.

This is a great basic recipe.

I used an 9x13 pan and it only made 12 thick guys, so next time I will use a cookie sheet with edges.  Also I felt these bars were more of a dessert bar than a granola bar for snacking.  Still, my husband loved them.

I have always wanted to try making granola bars and this recipe couldn't be easier! I did not have dried cranberries, but can't wait to try this again with them included. I also meant to include wheat germ, but forgot. Will make again with other variations. Thanks for a keeper!

Quick, easy.  My child loved them being chewy instead of crispy.  I had a bit of trouble getting them out of the pan in intact pieces.

Very very impressive!!!  Generally I don't enjoy baking as much as creating main courses and soups...but my husband has developed a cholesterol problem and I was tired of the cost of oatmeal bars.  These were actually fun to make and turned out great!  I used 1 cup trail mix (berries and nuts) 1 cup chocolate chips, 1 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  No problem at all to mix even without heating the condensed milk and came out nice and easy from the pan.  This recipe is a keeper and I won't be buying store bought any more!!!

Very, Very, Very Good. Kids already love them and they are still warm.
Hope they stick togther when they cool as of now not sitcking togther.
Next time I will use a jelly roll pan
I think they should be thinner.
Will use often in my home.
Used fat free condensed milk.
Taste the same.

These are fantastic and are made often in my house.  I love controlling what goes into the bars, and since my husband and I are active people, we always need something quick to take when hiking, cycling, etc.

I make a similar recipe all the time.  I omit the butter, and add a mixture of seeds like pumpkin, sesame and sunflower.  My whole family loves these, and I love the fact that I know exactly wat it is we're eating.

These are great! I used this recipe as a base for my own mix of stuff :) I first toasted the oats a little in the oven, then added coconut, nuts, sunflower seeds and a currants. I also used lite condensed milk and no butter. I like my bars more crispy than chewy so baked them a little longer till they browned on the top too. Oh yum! I think next time i might add a little vanilla to the condensed milk just for a change. 
Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe is so easy and tasty. I added some milled flax seed to make it a little more healthy. I also added a tsp of vanilla for some flavor.. Very good, will use again!

Talk about versatile recipe: I used 2c muesli mix (had nuts, raisins, coconut etc) and 1c cornflakes...only half the can of condensed milk and 1/3 bag of coffee marshmallows...cooked this mixture with 2-3tbsp butter on the stove...and pat it into a wax-lined pan.  Turned out nicely!

What a find! I won't be buying granola bars with ingredients I can't pronounce any longer! This is a great base to which you may add whatever ingredients you wish. I tried lining the pan with wax paper for a non-fat and easy cleanup option but the bars stuck a little. Next time I'll try Reynolds wrap Release instead.

Really good. So versatile. I added some mini choc. chips and Reece's peanut butter chips, and some nuts. Really good. Next time I'll probably do dried fruit. Pack them in the pan real good so they don't break so much. I like them chewy, so I didn't bake them long. YUM

These are great!  Next time I will try adding cinnamon, salt and maybe a little vanilla. I also might toss in some  protein powder. I love how versatile the bars can be!

An easy to make treat which I have made several times (I have been known to have one for breakfast as well). I use low-fat condensed milk and 1 tbsp of margarine, melted. Our favorite combination is 1 cup trail mix, 1 cup almonds, 1/2 cup of each of coconut, dried cranberries and chocolate chips. Keep well - I have mailed to our son (from Nova Scotia to Boston) and they stay fresh tasting.

These are fantastic!  I used fat free condensed milk, mini chocolate chips, and coconut.  The bars taste like cookies, they're so delicious!  I will definitely be making these again, next time I will try it with raising.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

These are fantastic and super easy to make.  In my first batch, I used a standard trail mix, but also added mini M&Ms, which were great.  I am excited about trying some different add-in ingredients.  These are great for a quick snack or breakfast on the go and are easy enough to make often.

So easy and soooo good.  Made them for a boating trip.  One batch was gone in one afternoon.  Made a second batch tonight.

These are quick to put together and so easy that my toddler helps out. They store well and travel well, so they make a great afternoon snack to pack in the lunch bag. I love that they are customizable -- I prefer raisins to craisins (too sweet) and jumbo chips because I'm a chocoholic. I also like adding sesame seeds for texture.

Delicious!  I substituted chopped dates for the cranberries.  Perfect to grab when in a rush in place of an energy bar.  Super quick to make.
