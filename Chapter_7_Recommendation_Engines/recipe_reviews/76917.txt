Wow! I've never made a cheese ball before, I made this a few hours in advance and the onions turn into little chewy bits and the whole thing just tastes amazing. I used a fairly good quality sharp cheddar that I finely grated, and I used chopped toasted pecans instead of walnuts. Everyone loved it, thanks for a super simple recipe!

This was definitely too salty the first time I made this..the next time I made it I used 1/2 of an envelope of dry onion soup mix and substituted sliced almonds for the walnuts. If you let the cheese ball sit overnight covered, the flavor is excellent!

I made this for a 4th of July party at my inlaws. I put it out on a plate and it was half gone before the party even started. I was not sure about it at first because of the cream cheese, but it tastes great. You really don't even taste the soup mix. Super easy to make. Tried it with Wheat Thins and came out well.

I wish that I'd read the reviews before making up this recipe----it was WAY too salty! So salty that to salvage the recipe, we added 4 times the amount of cream cheese to make it edible--ending up with 4 times the number of cheese balls we needed.....I wouldn't make this again.

As other reviewer's mentioned, there seemed to be way too much onion soup mix.  You can get away with a quarter or half of the packet.  I also added a  couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce and rolled the mixture in crushed almonds.  When you modify to your specific tastes, it is an awesome starter recipe!

I used chives for my herbal flavor which gives it a nice " oniony" flavor and adds a pop of green festive coloring !

I should have read the reviews before making.  Easy to make but way too salty.  I served it at a get-together and only one or two tried it.  Will definitely not make again.

We did not like it at all.  The onion soup over powered it and left a funky taste in your mouth.  Did not serve it - threw it away and made another appetizer.

Not it.  If you think this is "that" cheese ball you had before that was onion-y cream cheesy goodness you couldn't stop eating at a party----this. isn't. it.  It isn't the salt, though, if you make it, use half the packet.   The flavors in the soup mix over power the cream cheese even halved.  It needs to be more straight up onion, maybe a touch of garlic.  There is another recipe circulating with blue cheese and Worcestershire Sauce?  Maybe.      If you're stuck with the ingredients & you're in a pinch.....add onion, garlic to taste instead, or only make half recipe.  Its edible, but not delicious.

We loved this! I made it the day before to allow the flavors to blend and mellow. I did not use 10oz. of cheddar, I just eyeballed it until I though it was enough. We are cheese ball lovers and thought this was right up there with some of our other favorites. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe was very good and very easy to make. I did change it some because it didn't make much. I used 2-8 ounce of cream cheese and I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts. It turned out wonderful and my guests ate it all!
