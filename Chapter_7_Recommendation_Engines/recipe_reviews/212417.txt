This is a good cupcake recipe but let me make this very important suggestion.  I made the cream cheese icing first and discovered that Stevia does not taste that great.  I ended up throwing the icing away and making the cupcakes with Splenda.  They were a big hit.  I don't know how the icing would have turned out if made with Splenda.  My son is a Type 1 diabetic so taste is important.  Splenda is the best in my opinion.
