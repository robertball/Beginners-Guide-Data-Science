This needed a lot more broth for us.  Here is what I would do - either reduce the egg to 1 egg or increase / double the broth and seasonings. I added some white pepper which perked it up a bit.  As written this was 1 serving in this house.   Thanks - we really enjoyed this soup.

Put a tiny bit of vinegar in with the eggs and they will break up less when stirred. I add tamari instead of soy sauce.  Soy is wheat and soy and tamari is only soy.  I always use Better Than Bouillon roasted chicken paste when cooking.
