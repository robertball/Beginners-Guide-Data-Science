These are very good as is but can be VERY "heart healthy" without sacrificing taste with these changes: replace white flour with 2 cups whole wheat flour and one cup rolled oats; Replace oil one for one with applesauce; replace eggs with egg beaters (1/4 cup per egg).  I used canned pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice (6 teaspoons) to replace the other spices; and decrease sugar to 3/4 cup.  This recipe will make 24 "normal" sized muffins that are about 100 calories.

Absolutely delicious!  I cheated and used canned pumpkin in place of the fresh and the muffins were moist with just the right amount of spice.  I'll definitely be making these again.

Insanely delicious muffins!  My husband isn't a terribly big fan of pumpkin, and even he found them irresistible.  I used 15 oz canned pumpkin like others suggested, and cut all the spices but the cinnamon in half.  I substituted whole wheat flour for regular, Egg Beaters for the eggs, and used a 1/2 Splenda/ 1/2 sugar blend for the sugar.  I also added 1 cup chocolate chips and an oatmeal streusel topping.  Someone called these "coffeehouse quality" and I absolutely agree.

This recipe was very good, I did tweak it to my own taste, I cut the cloves and nutmeg in half, but left the cinnamon and allspice the same. I used 2 cups of canned pumpkin and topped them with an oatmeal streusel topping (3/4 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon,1/2 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup rolled oats, and 1/2 cup melted butter) they were fantastic. For my own "notes" the recipe yielded 18 muffins, and they took approximately 35 minutes to bake.

Great recipe! I made it healthier by using 2 cups unbleached flour + 1 cup rolled oats, used applesauce instead of oil, and only put in 2 eggs. Also used canned pumpkin. Turned out awesome! Kids love it!!

I'm making these again today! Used whole wheat,flax and spelt flour as we don't use white flour anymore. 1/2'd the sugar,added some apple sauce, some pineapple juice and cheated with canned pumpkin. I think I added some honey. As you can see, very versatile. Using whole wheat flour makes them very filling. For people on the go that want a quick healthy breakfast, that stays with you until lunch, this is perfect. My husband and children all loved these (even though they were good for them).

This recipe was AWESOME.  Perfect taste, perfect texture--just like what you might find in a restaurant.  I cut the recipe in half (used 2 eggs), and it still made 10 large muffins!  I also used a little less cloves and allspice than recommended so that it wouldn't be overpowering.

These are GREAT!  Just what I was looking for - a pumpkin muffin that doesn't need added things like raisens, nuts or chips to taste good - this is IT!  I used 1 cup wheat flour and 2 cups white flour.  Kids loved them too.  Thank you!

The amount of spice (particularly cloves and nutmeg)  HAS to be an error.  It ruined the muffins. I'm sitting here eating a "clove" muffin (as I've renamed them) right now.  What a shame, I love pumpkin muffins and I wasted all that time and ingredients and now am left with a big batch of cloves!  It's just horrible.  I LOVE spice, I tend to add half again as much cinnamon as is called for in most recipes, but I cut back the amount of spice called for in this recipe and it still was ruined.  I can't imagine how strong they would have been if I'd used 2 tsp. of each of them.  I think the basic pumpkin part is a good recipe.  The texture is good, but the spice as I said, is just TOO MUCH.  Not good at all.  Doesn't taste like pumpkin at all, sorry.

These muffins are without question the most delicious and moist muffins I have ever made or eaten in my life. Regardless of what other reviewers may say, do NOT alter this recipe in any way. The spices are perfectly balanced, and every ingredient at its stated amount is vital to the success of this recipe.

I would have loved to have made these with fresh pumpkin, however, I have no freaking clue where I'm supposed to find a sugar pumpkin! Even during the Halloween-Thanksgiving season, I cannot find them ANYWHERE. Don't make the mistake of using a yucky jack-o-lantern pumpkin that are plentiful during Halloween. They feed that stuff to cattle for a reason. That said, this recipe is extremely successful using canned pumpkin puree instead. HOWEVER, one standard 15 oz. can will NOT cut it. Use 2 HEAPING CUPS of 100% real pumpkin puree, NOT pumpkin pie filling. Do NOT skimp on the pumpkin puree! It's not just there for flavor; it adds incredible texture and moisture to the recipe.

Also be wary that this recipe makes TWO dozen medium sized muffins. I was astonished that I was able to perfectly fill 24 medium cups without a drop of batter left over.

Top with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe for absolute bliss. Add some chocolate chips or coconut for something extra special.

THANK YOU, JULIE!

Really good!  I didn't have any allspice or cloves, and I only had 2 eggs, but it still tasted great. Just double the cinnamon and add 1t of extra nutmeg, and it's fantastic!

Since I haven't gone to the pumpkin patch this year yet, I used organic canned pumpkin instead of homemade pumpkin puree. I cut this recipe down to eight servings as I had a feeling this recipe would make more than it stated. Because I wanted to cut back on the butter called for in this recipe, I used the whole can of pumpkin and only used three tablespoons of melted butter. I also cut the sugar in half and I added a teaspoon of vanilla. For eight servings, the amount of flour was two cups. When I looked at the amount of wet ingredients, I thought that might be a tad too much. I added a cup and a half of flour and folded it into the wet ingredients and it was just right. I think had I added the extra half cup of flour, the muffins would have been too dry. We didn't miss the extra sugar or fat. I think I could even cut one of the eggs out next time and substitute it with applesauce and it would still taste awesome. Really moist and dense muffin with a good fall flavor. We really enjoyed these muffins. NOTE: Even cutting this recipe back to eight servings, I still got 12 medium sized muffins so if you don't want a large amount, you might want to cut back the serving size amount as well. Mine were done at exactly 20 minutes.

These turned out very yummy w/ a few healthier alterations. I used 1/3 c. applesauce and 1/3 oil instead of all oil, added a cup of chopped walnuts and used 1 c. Whole wheat flour instead of 1 c. all-purpose. I also reduced spices by 1/2 except for the cinnamon. delicious!

LOVED these! I really enjoyed the spice level (they are super spiced) but I can understand the desire to cut the spices back a bit. I've made it several times now, and I like them best when I cut the nutmeg back to 1 1/2 tsps and the allspice back to 1/2 tsp. I followed another reviewer's advice and replaced one of the cups of flour with a cup of rolled oats, and they sort of blend into the muffins as they cook, so they turn out very tender but with just a bit more structure. I also reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups because I like my muffins not so sweet. Great recipe!

I *love* that you provided directions on starting with a fresh pumpkin and doing it all from scratch. I have also used canned pumpkin, but it's nice to see the full details. The only thing that stops this from being 5 stars is the amount of spice. To me, nutmeg and cloves are too overpowering, and it leaves a lingering taste on the tongue. I would cut them each in half and up the cinnamon. I've also used 6-7 teaspoons "pumpkin pie spice" in place of all the seasonings. Another thing I do is sprinkle shelled pumpkin seeds over the raw batter in the cups just before they go in the oven. And I also frost my muffins with a vanilla icing and add a bit of pumpkin pie spices to it.

I just made these muffins and they turned out great! I used a can of pumpkin puree instead of fresh, and reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Made 24 mini muffins and another 6 full size. They sure are tasty, the kids love them and I do too. I am going to frost the mini muffins with a cream cheese frosting and decorate with a piece of candy-corn for Halloween.

Great recipe! I made it in 2 loafs and I altered it a little bit. Used pumpkin puree that I had frozen last fall, 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups all purpose, halved the cloves, all spice and nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon. I also added a few walnuts and raisins on top. Baked them at 350 in greased, lined loaf pans for 45 minutes. I froze one loaf, hope it will keep well.

I was scared off by the amount of spices in this recipe (and I'm the person who ALWAYS doubles the spices called for in pumpkin pie!).  So, I made it with 1/2 tsp. of cloves, 1/2 tsp. of allspice, 2 tsp. of cinnamon, and 1 tsp. of nutmeg.  I also cut the oil back to 1/3 cup and the sugar to 1 1/2 cup, based on reviews I read, and I too substituted a cup of oatmeal for one cup of flour, to add a little texture.

Made this way, these muffins are pretty much perfect!  Moist, not too dense, with just the right amount of spice.

A very good muffin, not too airy but not too heavy.  I only used 1 tsp. of cloves and that was plenty - you can cut down the spices to your personal taste.  I also cut the sugar to 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white using applesauce instead of oil and a handful of raisens.  Still a very sweet muffin.  And as others have shared...kids love these!!!  Makes a dozen regular size AND 24 mini muffins - plenty for the kids and adults :)

This is a great recipie.  I changed a few things though.  I like organic foods..so I used natural cane sugar.  If you like heavier muffins use "whole spelt flour".  It's so healthy...I use it for pumpkin bread too.  I didn't want to bother with all the different spices...so I just stuck with cinnamon and pumpkin spice.  Home made apple sauce is the way to go instead of oil, and that's about it.  This recipie was so easy to work with.  Thanks

These are wonderful, moist, delicious, muffins!  The seem to have a perfect combination of spices.  We added some raisins and walnuts to ours.  Many times I'm tempted to add some cream cheese frosting to pumpkin muffins but these are perfect without any additions.

Good... I made these for my friend who loves pumpkin muffins, she loves them. I even liked them and I am not usually a big fan of anything pumpkin.

The spice ratios are way off. They would be better called 'Clove Muffins'.

Second time making these and they were again delicious. The first time I did it as is ,this time around, I made them "healthier" by replacing oil with homemade unsweetened apple sauce but still added a table spoon of omega 3 veggie oil.I reduced sugar to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup craisins. End result was delicious but I think I will keep oil to 1/3 cup and the apple sauce to a 1/3 cup since I found the mini muffin paper cups tended to stick to the baked muffins when the oil wasn't used. Yielded 48 mini muffins .Thanks for the recipe.

We really enjoyed these and have made them a few times now.  I would add a strusel topping with oats next time, but this is more for my husbands taste and request.  I do add vanilla (I almost always add vanilla to sweet baked goods) and use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.   I have also made these with my own baked pumpkin (which was frozen from the previous year) and with canned...both are good. I would not change out the oil for applesauce...really rubbery and dense.

DELICIOUS and Moist! My MIL brought us two cooking pumpkins, I don't like pumkin pie, but I love muffins. I halved the spices and omitted all spice and this muffin is delcious.  It is moist and had a very nice texture.  I also took out one cup of flour and added a cup of oats (kids love oatmeal muffins).  Very good, thank you for sharing this recipe!

These are wonderful, moist and tender.  The taste of autumn in a muffin!  The changes I made to this recipe are minimal, but include using canned pumpkin (it's too easy to resist!), adding an extra tsp. of cinnamon and throwing in some raisins and craisins.  Since the can of pumpkin was only about 1 1/2 cups, I used sour cream to make up the difference.  This recipe made 24 "regular-sized" muffins.  They turned out so good and made the house smell fantastic!  I'm very impressed!

This is now my favorite muffin/quick bread recipe! Like everyone else I made some changes--I omitted the cloves but doubled the allspice and kept the rest the same, plus I added a 1/4 t almond extract. Sometimes I add bananas, coconut or coconut extract, sometimes raisins, sometimes ground flax, wheat germ and/or oatmeal, some yogurt to replace some of the oil...these muffins are so versatile and always delish! 

This recipe does make a at least 18 large muffins. I freeze them right away, which is a good thing because we could eat them all in a day! Oh, and I always reduce the sugar to 1.5C but recently tried adding a pint of strawberry jam w/ no added sugar and that was great too. I love this recipe!

This is really a very good recipe, but I agree with the person who said it wasn't good enough to make me switch from my regular recipe. In fairness to this recipe, I didn't follow it exactly. I used 15 oz canned pumpkin as suggested by other reviewers, but in my opinion this wasn't enough. The muffins weren't pumpkiny enough for me. I also used 1/2 white & 1/2 whole wheat, which worked great. I'd say with more pumpkin flavor these would be perfect. I also threw in some chocolate chips - yummy!!

Would have given 5 stars but changed amounts of spices and oil and still an awesome recipe.  Can use 15 oz canned pumpkin instead, 1 1/2 c. sugar plenty, 1 1/2tsp. cloves, 1tsp. nutmeg, and slightly more than 1/3 oil. Everyone liked these.

Love these!   I used canned pumpkin (15 oz. can) instead of fresh.  I also topped them with a crumb topping (1/3 c. brown sugar, 2 T. flour, 1/2 t. cinnamon, 2 T. cold butter) which really took them over the top.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Good recipe, I used canned pumpkin instead of fresh. Used 2 cups whole wheat and 1cup of all purpose. Used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and 1 cup of brown sugar. Turned out really well and they are a hit with my 3 year.

I think if I had left the recipe as it was written, it would have tasted like a spice rack, personally. 

I modded it to the following:
2C canned puree (no access to a sugar pumpkin in Feb!)
1tsp cloves
2tsp cinnamon
1tsp nutmeg
½tsp ginger (in place of allspice)
½C of raisins

Baked for 22mins in my gas oven was perfect for a moist and delicious muffins that go over big time here with my husband and my 5yo picky son.  

Next time I may sub ½ the AP Flour for WW flour and sub applesauce for the oil. I might even add a whole cup of raisins since I prefer to have them in every bite! It's also possible to sub flaxseed for the egg if you're looking to go vegan.

I have made these muffins several times and they are alwasy delicious.  For Thanksgiving, instead of making muffins, I made it into a cake and drizzled it with cream cheese icing.  I used a bundt pan and baked it at the same temperature for about an hour and 15 minutes (until a toothpick came out clean).  It turned out very good.  Definitely a great fall recipe.

This muffin is Delicious!! Just like in the coffee shops!!
I did tweak it a little
1. Instead of 3 cups of white flour, I only added 2 cups of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat
2. Instead of 2 cups of white sugar I added 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown
3. I used 2-14oz cans of pumpkin puree instead of making my own
4. I halved the spices...if you don't like cloves..don't use the spice!  I only used cinnamon and some nutmeg.  Taste the recipe as you add the spice...it won't kill you
5. I added 1 cup of nuts and 1 cup of raisins.
6. This recipe will make 2 dozen muffins or 1 dozen muffins and 1 loaf.
My kids thought that these muffins were delicious...even with the nuts!
I will definitely be making this again!!!

Would have given 5 stars because they turned out so delicious, but I altered it per suggestions of others. I used canned pumpkin, reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups, reduced all the spices by half except for the cinnamon, and added chocolate chips. The result was definitely 5 stars, so moist and delicious!!! My 5 and 3 year olds loved them. I also put on a simple sugar glaze- mix powdered sugar with milk to get a glaze about the consistency of heavy cream, then sprinkle in some nutmeg and cinnamon, brush on the hot muffins with a pastry brush. Very delicious, will definitely make this one again.

This was an excelent recipe, although I made a few alterations. I was short on time so I used a 15oz can of pumkin puree. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and only used 1 1/2 tsp of ground cloves.

This was the best! I halved this recipe because I didn't need so many muffins. Following some of the other suggestions, I did the following: Used 2/3 a 15 oz can of pumpkin, 1 egg and 1 TBS of water, 1 c. flour, I halved the baking powder, soda, sugar, cinnamon, and salt. On the spices, I used 1/2 tsp nutmeg, no allspice (didn't have any), and 1/2 tsp cloves. This method made 12 regular size muffins. Really moist and flavorful, just the right amount of spice.  Definitely will make again.

A good pumpkin muffine recipe.  Do not hesitate to use a fresh sugar pumpkin.  It is SO easy!  I followed the instructions and just pureed it in my food processor.  My small sugar pumpkin yielded exactly 2 cups.  I was able to make 12 muffins and one good-sized loaf with the recipe as-is.  I used 1/3 cup applesauce, 1/3 cup canola oil.  I also used half whole wheat pastry flour.  I added 2/3 cup Ghiradeli milk choco chips.  I cut down a bit on the nutmeg too.  Delicious!

Excellent! I went to a restaurant today and had a pumpkin spice muffin. I had to try to make my own & this is pretty close! I threw in some ground walnuts, used melted butter instead of oil, and topped it with coarse sugar & super-finely chopped walnuts. this is a keeper!!

These are so yummy!  I made the recipe healthier by using unsweetened applesauce for the oil, egg substitute for the eggs, 1 cup of oats and 2 cups of whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and 1 cup of brown sugar for the 2 cups of white sugar.  I made some into muffins and also poured some of the batter into mini-loaves.  Even my 4-year old loves them. This is a yummy and very healthy snack!!

Yummy! I substituted the oil for 1/3 cup applesauce and 1 cup ground flax to make it healthier. It made them heavier but still moist and delicious.

Super Yummy and very moist!  I used canned pumpkin puree and it worked great.  I agree that  the amount of  spices needs to be cut down.  I didn't add any clove and only used half of the nutmeg it called for. But I used the full amount of cinnamon and allspice.   I sprinkled a small amount of brown sugar on the tops before baking and it was delicious!

Any baking recipe with vegetable oil can be replaced with unsweetened applesauce. For every 1 part oil, use 1 part sauce and make it a bit healthier. Can't tell the difference and it makes the recipe a bit more moist.

This is a good recipe that my family loved. I did, however, tweak it a little bit. I used 1 can of pumpkin instead of fresh. I also dialed back the nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves to 1 tsp each. The result was an awesome spiced pumpkin muffin that crowned beautifully. The top was slightly crunchy while the inside was moist. I did get more batter than 12 muffins, probably because canned pumpkin just has more volume than fresh. I filled my muffin tins all the way and got big, beautiful muffins, and still had just a little batter left over. So if you do this recipe with my "tweaks," you could probably actually get 18 muffins out of it. Definitely keeping this recipe (with my changes, of course).

I woke up early this special morning, exited to surprise my fiance with delicious, freshly baked Pumpkin Muffins. I chose this recipe because my Fiance and I really like spicy Pumpkin confections. I was reassured this was a good recipe as it was highly rated and had a lot of saves on this site. After baking them. I must say I was really disappointed with the results. On a minor note; I found the timing of this recipe misleading. It doesn't account for the considerable prep time required to prepare the pumpkin puree. But, my main issue with this recipe was; On my first bite of these muffins I was confronted with an overwhelming blast of CLOVES and Nutmeg. My Fiance and I found the SPICE content in this recipe excessive. I can't deny I am disappointed to be left with a batch of twelve large INEDIBLE muffins.

Wonderful. I added cranberries just because i love the 2 together! My batch made more than 12 muffins though. I had enough leftover to make 3 full mini loaves of pumpkin bread. And I made Large size muffins and the mini loaves were bursting over.

I've made these several times now, the recipe actually makes 18 nice size muffins. I've adjusted it to 2 cups of canned pumpkin, 2 c. whole wheat pastry flour, 1 c. all-purpose flour I also use 1 c. Splenda and 1 c. sugar. They are a big hit where ever they go. I highly recommend them.

This was pretty good. I only had 2 eggs.  I also used pumpkin pie spice and just added a little extra cinnamon.  I substituted home made apple sauce for the oil and used the oatmeal streusel recipe that someone posted and they turned out great.  I also used 2 cups of wheat flour and one cup of oatmeal that I ground into powder with a food processor.  Next time I will reduce the pumpkin pie spice even more than I did already (i'll try halving it like someone else suggested) and replace it with cinnamon.  Over all this recipe is a keeper!

The taste of the clove was too overpowering for the muffins.  Good texture but next time I will omit most of the cloves.

I thought these were good but there are too many spices going on.  I love cloves, but they are very overpowering in these muffins.  My husband said that he wouldn't know they are pumpkin if I hadn't told him.  I will make these again but I will cut the cloves completely out and cut the rest of the spices in half.

I made this as a loaf - it's wonderful -  I always read all the comments and tweak depending on those - but this one needed very little tweaking.  I used the spices as indicated, used half oil and half applesauce and half white and brown sugar - thank you for all the comments and a wonderful recipe!!

I used freshly ground spices and omitted the cloves by accident. Had to use bread flour because we were out of all-purpose. Possibly the best thing that could have happened. One of the best recipes I have ever made. I will be making these again.

Made it EXACTLY the way recipe was written and they were fantastic! Wow! I am blown away at the taste and texture of these muffins. Definitely one of the best I've tasted! I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make them again and again...until my family gets tired of pumpkin anyhow :) Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

These muffins are sooo good.  I made mini muffins and baked them for 9 minutes.  They are so moist.  I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before I baked them.  I don't feel guilty adding it since the recipe uses applesauce instead of oil.

I made these today however since I was not looking for candy I reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  They were very good.  Also since I do not care for nutmeg I replaced it with ginger.

Delicious! Only change I made was that I used 15 oz. pumpkin puree...very moist & made exactly 12 standard-size muffins. Oh, I did have to bake for 28 minutes.

I make 2/3 of a recipe because a full recipe is too much for one 12cup muffin pan.  I cut the spices and salt in half.  I add nuts and raisins also.  I substite part of the white flour with 1 c oatmeal and 1/4 c ground flax seed.  Now, you have 5 stars and better nutrition too.

Very, very good!  I made these muffins last night and my kids literally gobbled them up for breakfast.  I happened to have some pumpkin puree in the freezer from pumpkins we grew over the summer, so used that.  I used applesause instead of oil, and used half brown sugar/half granulated sugar.  The muffins are so flavorful and very moist.  After I mixed the dry ingredients I realized I only had one egg, so (per allrecipe's substitution guide) I used six tablespoons of mayo in place of the other two eggs.  I was a bit nervous about what this would do to the muffins, but they came out wonderfully.  This recipe made 24 standard muffins with just enough batter leftover to make a mini-loaf.  I'm keeping this recipe and will certainly use it again!

These muffins are wonderful!!!!  I will have a ton of pumpkins left over from Halloween, and now I know just what to do with them.  These gourmet muffins are not too sweet, spicy or dry.  They are moist and so flavorful I was fighting my kids over the last one!  I will definitely make more tomorrow.  This recipe is an absolute keeper!!!

I had to give these a 5* rating so other people would try them but I did make a few changes.  Less sugar (1 1/2 cups), oil (1/2 cup) and all spices 1/2 the suggested amount.  These really moist muffins were great for breakfast but I made some fancier by topping with cream cheese frosting and adding a marzipan pumpkin.

I used 2 cups of canned pumpkin instead, and they turned out really well.  I also added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and 1/3 cup of golden raisins.  Instead of 2/3 cups of oil, I substituted 1/3 cup of applesauce and 1/3 cup of oil.  It could have made more than 12 muffins, but I filled my tins all the way to the top, and they needed about 12 more minutes of baking time.

These are the muffins I was looking for!  Perfect muffiny texture... nice and dense and perfectly seasoned.  I added chopped pecans to the batter for protein and topped each with a half pecan.  They were beautiful!  The perfect grab and go breakfast for our family!

These are delicious.  I have made them several times and everyone always wants the recipe.  I always top them with cream cheese icing so they are more of a cupcake than a muffin.  Like other reviewers, I have found that the recipe makes many more than one dozen muffins - more like 20 muffins.  I have also made them using mini muffin tins and they turned out great. I just had to reduce the baking time to 13-15 minutes.  This is a terrific fall recipe!

This recipe should actually be named "Ginger Snap Cookie Muffins" because it tasted just like one of those cookies.  They were good but the pumpkin taste , I thought, got lost in the spices. I guess I was looking for something a little sweeter and creamier like a pumpkin and cream cheese muffin recipe.

Very moist and yummy muffins. Easy to make too. I would recommend cutting down on the sugar by a 1/2 cup and slightly increasing the overall amount of spices. Went well with a simple icing mading out of icing sugar and melted butter, which I pepped up with more cinnamon and nutmeg.

My friends love these muffins and they seem to get even tastier after a day or two.  I went full spice, replaced half the oil with apple sauce and sprinkle a little bit of brown sugar on the tops before baking.  I love this recipe!

These muffins turned out really yummmy.  I was able to get 12 muffins and a small loaf of bread out of the batter.  I skipped the cloves because I don't care for them, and skipped the allspice because i didn't have any.  Next time I may add a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg to make up for the other spices.  I added chocolate chips to the batter used for the loaf and turned out so yummy.  Thanks for the recipe, will be making this again.

I wish I had reduced the spices. The cloves were very overpowering,especially. They were still very good. I did 1/3cup applesauce, 1/3cup oil - substituted 1 cup flour with whole wheat flour and reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups.

These muffins were great! My husband is a diabetic, so when I saw the total carbs per muffin, I knew that I had to make some changes. I replaced the 2 cups of white sugar with 1 1/2 cups of Splenda Granular (the one that measures cup per cup like sugar... not the new Splenda Blend... haven't tried that one yet) and 1/2 cup of regular white sugar like the recipe calls for. I also added an extra 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda to compensate for the Splenda. Everything else was the same and now they are only 33 carbs each instead of 59 (carbs minus fiber). They have a great spice taste to them too! Will definitely make them again!

I made this last night and brought them into work today.  For starters, these are VERY LARGE, pouffy muffins.  I thought I had too much batter to put in the pan, but I fit it all in and they came out beautiful.  I had to cook them at 350 for 45 minutes.  At 25 minutes, they were still raw (and I know my oven is right, I have a thermometer and its brand new).  So, be prepared to cook them a little longer. I topped them with cream cheese icing and they were so goooooooood!  Yummy.  Very spicy and yummlicious.  These were a hit.  I'll definitely make them again.
Cream cheese icing:

1 80z pkg light cream cheese, softened
1/4 pound of soft butter (1/2 cup is what I use)
2 tsp vanilla
1&1/2 cups icing sugar
- works nice mixing with a hand blender.

Enjoy!

These are totally awesome! I used canned pumpkin, otherwise didn't change a single thing. My entire family loves them and my 5 year old requested them for his preschool birthday party treat. I then had moms asking me for the recipe because their kids liked them so much! I did drizzle them with a maple glaze, which I made from powdered sugar, syrup and a bit of milk. Excellent!

I halved this recipe and came up with 12 large muffins.  The muffins were easy to prepare, had great texture, and fantastic taste.  This recipe is a keeper!

These were wonderful.  I brought them to work to let a coworker try them.  She is very picky and will never buy cookies or other baked items from a store.  She loved them.  They were moist and the spices just right.  I used pumpkin from our Halloween jack-o-lantern.  I cooked up the pieces and then froze them in plastic containers.

i can't have any sugar so I used stevia as a substitute and they worked great. I also added a little homemade yogurt to fill up some of the bulk for the sugar I deleted. these were good for me.

I made these in little muffin tins and they turned out moist and perfect. They also went over well at my sons playgroup. The mommies loved them as did the 1 1/2 - 2 year olds. I will make these again for sure.

Incredibly flavorful, moist, delicious, aromatic -- these are fantastic muffins that are easy to make and appealing to all ages. I would only add that the recipe can make 18 to 24 muffins.

I shouldn't review this recipe because I did make a few changes to it...but, here goes.  I loved it with my changes.  Halved the recipe and still got 12 muffins.  Used 3/4 c. canned pumpkin and the rest in apple butter to make up the difference to equal 1 full cup.  Because of the reviews stating the spices were too heavy, I put in 1/4 t. cloves, 1 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg, and 1/4 t. allspice.  Used 1 jumbo egg and everything else as written.  Added some raisins and 1/2 c. toasted chopped walnuts.  Sprinkled with course sugar on top before baking...excellent!  One more change, I had a bit of whole wheat flour left in the bag and wanted to use it up...1/4 c. of the flour was substituted with whole wheat flour.  A lot of changes, not exactly like the recipe, I know.  But this made a great pumpkin muffin that produced a better muffin than the one written in the recipe.

I made these muffins exactly as called for, using fresh pureed pumpkin I had in my freezer.  They turned out wonderful.  I used regular sized muffin tins and this made a total of 20 good sized muffins.

It is even more flavorful and healthy if you substitute coconut oil for the vegetable oil and use 1/4 cup Chia seeds & 1/4 cup walnuts; omitting 1/2 cup flour
I also swapped out 1 cup of white sugar for 3/4 cup brown sugar and some honey.
Still has lots of sugar but sticks to the ribs with healthy fats

I cheated and used canned pumpkin. Also, I had leftover icing from Paul's Pumpkin Bars and tried it on 1 of my muffins to make a cupcake. Alone, the muffins were good as is.

These are very moist. However, I did not use the recommended amount of baking soda or spices. I used a little more than 1/2 the recommended amount of baking soda, and just a teaspoon of nutmeg and ground cloves. Also, it made almost twice the number of muffins that it claimed to make. I would be interested to see AllRecipes double check this recipe and put a note on it, verifying that these amounts are indeed correct.

Excellent! I made mini loaves instead of muffins and they took 30 min to cook. I was also on a restricted diet so I used GF flour, walnut oil instead of veg. Oil, and a sugar substitute blend of cups n coconut sugar...they turned out great! Thx for the revipe!

I want so bad to give it five stars, but the yield and cooking time was way off. I'm all for big muffins, but this made 14 HUGE muffins. I had to scramble to find two single silicone muffin things. The bake time at 350 degrees took 35 minutes!!! Way over the maximum time stated (25 min). Only change I made was that I use half whole wheat, half all purpose flour. I will definitely make these again knowing that I need extra muffin trays. I read other reviews, and although I was sceptical, the amount of spice was just perfect in my opinion.

Got many raves on this one! Definitely one to make part of my repetoire. Made the following changes: used canned pumpkin leftover from cookies I had made two weeks earlier, left out the nutmeg and allspice since I didn't have them, used half brown sugar because I was out of white sugar, and added small golden raisens, about a cupful. My batch yield 24 muffins probably because I used a smaller muffin tin.

These are so tasty! I made them for Thanksgiving for something sweet and spicy. The recipe made 24 muffins in regular muffin cups. I would perhaps add a little less clove next.

These are very tasty pumpkin muffins with a nice blend of spices.  We used thawed purèed pumpkin that we had processed and frozen in the fall.  To add my own twist, I made a simple icing glaze with milk and powdered sugar and drizzled over the top.

Lovely recipe. Used half white/half wholemeal flour. Used 1tsp cinnamon, 1tsp ginger, 1tsp all spice to flavour mine. Also cut back on oil and used 125g of plain sweetened yogurt and some milk to moisten. Only used 1tsp baking soda and 1tsp baking powder. Lastly, to save time, i steamed my pumpkin for 10 mins in the microwave rather than roasting. Delish!

Really good. I used half the sugar, half the oil, and replaced half the flour with whole wheat flour & oats. Added some chopped walnuts. Didn't have allspice - used 1/2 tsp cinnamon + 1/4 tsp nutmeg + 1/4 tsp ginger to replace that. Will definitely make again. Mini Muffins cook 10 minutes. Extras freeze well. Next time I may add a little orange zest/juice &/or some chopped cranberries.

Great texture & a very pretty muffin-- It tastes overwhelmingly of baking soda, though, even after I used a quarter of a tsp. less than noted in the recipe. Next time, I'm using self-rising flour and omitting the baking soda and baking powder. Overall a great recipe!

I just made these, and they're delicious! They are very dense. I used 2 cups AP flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, so I ended up having to add little bit of milk at the end to thin the batter out. The flavor and texture was wonderful. Perfect for a fall morning. :)

I made these twice. The first I followed it as written and they were far far too sweet. The second time I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and it was very bland, almost like bread. Logic would say to use 1.5 cups but I don't think I'm going to bother with these a third time. Even using a fresh pumpkin the actual pumpkin flavor is very subdued. I would add more, but I fear that would throw off the balance and make the batter too wet. For what it's worth they made my house smell great both times though.

Made these for my daughter's preschool class (all the kids ate them right up!) and it made 24 regular size muffins. I think this recipes is for jumbo muffins...so if you only want 12 you need to cut it in half. If using fresh pumpkin for this recipe no need to drain the pumpkin puree. I was very happy I saved the juices that collected or these would have been too dry. Otherwise, I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour and halved the cloves, all spice, and nutmeg. Kept everything else the same and these came out delicious. Big hit at our house and with the preschool crowd :)

Replaced oil with applesauce. Reduced cloves and increased cinnamon. Used almond flour to make them gluten free. Got great reviews by everyone at the party. Very moist. My 3 year old absolutely loved them! Highly recommend.

Was looking for a way to incorporate pumpkin into my diet, and found this recipe. I followed one of the reviews to make it a healthier version. I used a can of pumpkin, 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup rolled oats, apple sauce for oil, 3/4 cups sugar, egg beaters for the eggs, and pumpkin spice. At first they were a little dry, but I covered them and let them sit over night and the next day they were much more moist. Next time I'll freeze them to make them super moist. I did a recipe analysis using these ingredients, and if you make 24 muffins, they are only 89 calories each, .4 grams of fat, 1.3 grams fiber, and 2.5 grams protein.

Great muffins, and this is a very forgiving recipe.  I used canned pumpkin, as many others did.  I wanted them to be healthier, so I used 1 1/2 c of whole wheat flour, and 1 1/2 c of quick oats, both of these I ran through the food processor to grind them up finer and make them lighter.  Also only used 2 eggs, but added a few tablespoons of water at the end to lighten up the batter.  I love the amount of spices, although I didn't have allspice.  I used a little pumpkin pie spice to replace it.  Also used a combination of splenda, white sugar, and brown sugar to make the full 2 cups.  Great recipe!

These muffins are great, and even better the day after. They also freeze well.  I use whole grain flour and top them with an oatmeal streusel topping, and sometimes put hulled pumkin seeds, chocolate chips or walnuts on top. My kids just love them!

I **LOVE** these! And my 2 year old can't get enough of them. I didn't have all the spices so I used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and also used 15oz canned pumpkin.   I ended up with 24 regular muffins and 6 huge ones- we are fine with that many though! This is a keeper!

Should have followed the recipe but took other reviewers advice to cut back sugar, not good idea.  They were moist, but I did add 1/4 of milk because mixture was too dry I am glad I added milk.

This recipe yielded muffins with a perfect consistency!  I followed as written, but used a whole can of pumpkin (15 0z) vs. the fresh pumpkin.  The reciped made 12 large muffins--I used a muffin tin w/ paper liners.  I thought the blend/amount of spices perfect.  Thanks!

These were good, certainly not fantastic.  I ended up adding pumpkin pie spice and using a whole tablespoon of cloves.  Not enough spice!  I used mini-loaf pans and had enough batter to make 14 loaves.  Certainly twice what the author believed the recipe would yield.

Very moist and delicious!  Be aware, though, that these ingredients make more than 12 muffins!  The only thing I had left in the house to use was a mini muffin pan.  So I made 12 normal sized muffins + 16 mini muffins.  :)  No complaints here!

I made the recipe to the letter EXCEPT that I made a bundt cake, I added 1 teas. ginger instead of nutmeg, I omitted the allspice and added a dash of vanilla. It came out REALLY good. I liked the nice soft texture. It taste like pumpkin pie to me! Amount of Ginger didn't make it too spicy but just right...

This recipe turned out AMAZING!I don't see how anyone gave it less than 5 stars... Granted, I also made some minor adjustments like other reviewers. I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white granulated sugar. I used a 15 oz can of pumpkin pie filling(canned puree with spices added) and also added 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the stated spices in the original recipe. I baked in a preheated oven for 22 minutes and they turned out PERFECT! It made exactly 24 regular sized muffins. Before baking I topped with crystalized sugar- just add some butter to them and a cup of coffee and your morning is set! Yum! I will definitely use this recipe again!

Absolutely perfect!  The recipe made exactly 12 jumbo sized muffins, although they took closer to 30 minutes to cook in my oven.

Mine turned out a REALLY thick batter. I only held back on the sugar and oil by a little in order to reduce the calories, so I was shocked at how thick the batter was. Turned out fine though. Sprinkled turbinado sugar just before baking, and they were so pretty!

I'm not crazy about the first try because of all the spices--way too much!  I used 1 can of pumpkin, 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup flour, 1 c brown sugar, and 2/3 cups applesauce instead of the oil.  The texture is great, and they come out huge.  I'm looking forward to tweaking these again.

Family loved them. I added a struesel topping made up of 2 tbsp of flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp of butter and 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  Next time I may cut the allspice in half as I personally felt too strong taste.  But as I said the guys liked them.  My husband like because not super sweet tasting.

These are fantastic and very versatile! I took some othes suggestions and these are the changes I made: applesauce for oil, 1 cup wheat flour, 1 cup white flour, 1 cup oats for the 3 cups flour, and a 15 oz. can of pumpkin instead of fresh. I was out of allspice so I couldn't use it, but I'm sure it would have been fine. I doubled the recipe and added chocolate chips to one half... delicious, moist, delicious!

The prep time on this is misleading as it doesn't include the 90+ minutes to prepare the pumpkin puree.  This is obviously no problem when using canned, which I did. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It yielded 18 normal sized muffins that were moist & tasty, but just average.  I will make them again using some of the other reviewers suggestions for substitutions/additions (nuts, raisins, applesauce for the oil, etc.) that make for a healthier, more interesting muffin.

I have never reviewed a recipe here before, but this one compelled me to do so! These muffins were amazing! I made 2 changes: I added about a cup of mini chocolate chips, and I used one can of pumpkin puree instead of using a real pumpkin, because I am too lazy to go through that step. But - this recipe is perfect! The flavor is great, they are very moist! It made about 2 dozen muffins. Try this!

Way to many spices for me and my family. I found the cloves overpowering my husband couldn't even take a second bite. I did change the recipe some based on some reviews just to make it healthier. Whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar used oats also even added some mini chocolate chips but didn't change the quantity of anything. I will try this again sometime with reduced spices, just disappointed I made a uneatable batch.

Wonderful recipe! I made the "healthier" version subbing oil for applesauce and 1 cup wholw wheat flour, 1 cup white flour, 1 cup oats, cut sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I also used canned pumpkin and about 1 cup of raisins. Delicious and the kids loved them too!

Makes about 24 nice sized muffins- perfect for breakfast or snack. My kids LOVE this recipe- and I make them ALL THE TIME.

Nice and moist. I cut back on sugar (just 1.5 cups) and left everything else the same, but think I could've boosted the spices a tad.

I made a gluten free version of this muffin. 1c brown rice flour, 1c oat flour, 1c quick cooking oats. If you are truly allergic to gluten check your oats and oat flour to make sure they are indeed gluten free. I used 1c agave nectar in place of sugar. I could have used 2c but was worried they would be too sweet. If you are a sweet person you may want 2c nectar. I did use juice from half of an orange for added sweetness and then grated the orange peel into the mixture. I used grape seed oil instead of veg oil. I used egg substitute of ground flax seed and water. 1 egg= 1/3c water to 1 Tbs flax. I didn't have all spice. I love how spicy they are! They turned out very moist! I definitely taste the clove more than cinnamon so maybe next time I will use a tad less clove. I did use fresh pumpkins too! This is officially a fall muffin in this house!

I can only say three words here to describe these..  YUM YUM YUM !  The biggest compliment comes from my son though.. The recipe made enough for 12 regular size and 24 mini muffins. I'm getting ready to start making a second batch because he has ate them all! The rest of us only got a bite of one.. He ate the rest.   The only thing was I worried about was I used pumpkin that I had frozen last fall.. But I worried for nothing.. they turned out perfectly!  Thank you so much for an awesome recipe!

Awesome! I made this recipe for my coffee shop and they are wonderful.  Sold out in no time and can't keep up the demand! I added a crumb topping and maple vanilla glaze. Also, I used canned pumpkin.

These muffins are WONDERFUL!  However, they make about 17 muffins, not 12.  I used a 15 oz can pumpkin and changed the spices a bit - 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  Also frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  Absolutely delicious!!

I followed the directions to the "T". Well, minus the Allspice as I did not have it. These turned out AWESOME! Very moist and tasty. I am waiting for them to cool so I can add vanilla glaze to them. I have a feeling these will be gone in no time!

Thank you for sharing!  I followed others and reduced flour to 2 c. and added 1 c. oats, and swapped applesauce for oil.  I love Chinese 5-spice for pumpkin recipes, so I used that along with an extra t. cinnamon and nutmeg. I used 2 whole eggs and had an extra egg white from today that I added too.  Will keep this a secret in my house!!!

Another muffin fav for my recipe box!  Love the fact that I usually have all these ingreadients on hand.  They have alot of flavor, and are very moist, plus economical.  I anticipated 12 muffins, however ended up with 15.

That was a lot of spices, but they sure taste good!  Cut the sugar in half and used 2c. whole wheat graham flour, 1 c. unbleached white flour.  Very yummy and great with Rhubarb Jam (recipe also on this site). Made mini muffins and got 48 LARGE mini muffins.

Very yummy and easy to make. I added a streusel topping. The 12 serving size makes about 24 of the regular muffin liner sized muffins. Not sure if 12 servings are for a large muffin tin.

What the heck?? I made these 3 times and on the 3rd time I finally omitted ALL the cloves and all spice to get rid of that super spicy taste. They were good muffins, but too many changes had to be made to get them to my liking. I will be trying another version from this site to be my go-to Pumpkin Muffin recipe.

Absolutely fantastic! These muffins fill your entire home with such a warm and cozy aroma...I did as others said and replaced the oil with applesauce, which made them deliciously moist! This was the first pumpkin recipe I've tried that I really loved.

Very Easy & tasty!  I tooke some advice from other reviews and halved this recipe. I used 2 eggs, and canned pumpkin.  I also didn't have allspice so I just added an extra 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  They turned out great!!  My husband took a few to work and they got great reviews there.  THanks!

Yummy....we used a can of pure pumpkin instead of using a fresh. Also decreased the allspice and cloves a bit. Instead of the oil, we used homemade applesauce. Very good, nice flavors...made 2 dozen muffins. Thanks!

I failed this recipe, it didn't fail me. I made changes based on others suggestions without first giving it a go "as is." I was disappointed with the strength of the spices, they left an aftertaste I couldn't shake off. I also didn't like the substitution of applesauce for oil or oats and whole wheat for all purpose flour. The muffin was very lumpy, dense, spicy and "healthy" tasting...an overly gritty quality. I will make this again and re-review soon.

I thought the spice in these muffins was a little heavy.  If I made them again I would omit the allspice and just use cinnamon and nutmeg.

These were good and went over well with everyone. I, too, used canned pumpkin and less sugar (1 1/2 cups) and just a little more than 1/2 cup of oil (I used olive oil). I also used about half of the amount of spices called for. The muffins tasted just right. There was too much batter for 12 regular-sized muffins, though...I filled the paper cups practically to the brim and there was enough left over for 2-3 more muffins. I'd give this one four and a half stars.

I just made this recipe and it turned out really well. I read the reviews and made the following changes: replaced 2 cups of flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup quick oats; reduced the nutmeg and allspice by half and the cloves to 1/4 tsp; replaced the oil with sweetened applesauce; reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and replaced 1 cup with brown sugar; replaced the pumpkin with canned puree. 
I increased the recipe by half as I had 3 cups of puree (used 5 eggs), and it made 12 large muffins (I filled the cups to the brim) and 1 small loaf (baked for 50 mins). I'll be making this recipe again, maybe adding some chopped pecans.

I used 2 cups canned solid pack pumpkin because I didn't have the time nor inclination to use fresh.  I was nervous because the batter was very thick, but they came out fine.  The muffins were moist with good spicy flavor.  My toddler loved them.  

In half the batter I added 1/4 cup nonfat plain yogurt.  These muffins were more lighter, more cake light but they didn't look as good.

The recipe yielded more muffins than expected but I might have smaller pans.  The cooking time was accurate.

I will probably use this recipe again.

I made this recipe exactly how it was written, and the muffins were fantastic! I had to fill the muffins cups all the way and then make 3 more, but they are moist and delicious. I did have to bake them a little longer than 25 minutes because they were so large.

Awesome. I used 1 big can of pumpkin and only one tsp of cloves. Everything was the same. My 2.5 year old ate it and loved it. My mom who isnt a muffin fan thought they were great. They were very moist, I think if you use the actual pumpkin as opposed to the can it is drier. So, for moist muffins use the big can of pumpkin.

this was yummy and everyone liked it.  Did a little variation by using canned pumpkin, 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white, 1 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites.  I also took other peoples advice and cut spices in half...except cinnamon, and added choc chips (I was making them for a Brownie troop), they were a hit. Very good recipe.

This recipes rocks!
Of course, I had to change it a bit ...
I used a large can of pumpkin, which was the 2 called-for cups.  And I cut all the spices down to just 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg since strong flavors tend to overwhelm me.  The muffins turned out excellent - light, moist, not too sweet, not too spicy.  A big hit w/all the family!

Very moist, I used a 15 oz. can of pumkin also. I cut back the spice as suggested in one of the reviews, it wasn't spicy enough for me. I also cut the sugar, and did not notice that they weren't too sweet. They were just right.  The baking time was perfect. I suggest everyone check their ovens to be sure your oven temperature is accurate.......don't give bad star ratings because your oven is off! I added nuts to this, I have made several batches, they are a hit at my house. I agree, coffee house quality.

These were yummy!  I did everything the same except reduced the clove to 1/2 tsp and used a can of pumpkin puree.  It yielded 20 nice sized muffins and the kids and I polished off half of them as soon as they came out of the oven.  Wonderful spread with whipped cream cheese, Mmmmm...  Very quick and easy and a great recipe for the kids to make on their own.  Next time I'll try it with fresh pumpkin just to see the difference.  I'll use this recipe again, for sure.

These muffins (or bread) are so moist and yummy. It is a fail-safe recipe. I am not a baker and they have turned out every time. You can use canned pumpkin if you don't have time to use a real one. It made 2 dozen small muffins for me (or 12 muffins and one loaf).

Wow.  Really moist and tasted great.  We didn't put any topping at all on them (we were too busy eating them).  I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the individual spices.

Yummy! Recipe made 24 though not 12.  I put in half the oil and added 1/4 cup of applesauce to reduce fat.  I also stirred in 1 cup of raisins after mixing the batter.  Moist and lots of flavor.  Thanks!

These muffins were great! I changed the recipe a bit -- cut the sugar to 1 3/4  cups and added one cup of chocolate chips. May try reducing sugar still more as they were plenty sweet. We will definitely make these muffins again -- easy and quick recipe.

These muffins were wonderful!  I ran out of eggs and had to use egg beaters, I substituted half of the oil with applesauce, and I didn't have any cloves . . . and they're still awesome!  I made a quick glaze and drizzled it over the tops to make them look prettier.  They are wonderful, moist, and tasty!

I'll admit, fresh pureed pumpkin is amazing, but that's not always available and I use plain Libby's canned pumpkin as a substitute. Tastes just as wonderful and these are my family is second favorite muffins.

Our first favorite are blueberry muffins that I'm just going to have to share the recipe for you to understand just how amazing they are!

I read the other reviews and decided to change a few things. I was happy I could use  I can of pumpkin instead.  I used 3 tsp. of pumpkin spice, which was perfect to avoid overpowering taste of cloves and nutmeg. They turned out perfect so I am taking them to church tomorrow for the Thanksgiving dinner. I sure do love this site;  it is so helpful.

Good starter recipe.  I read some reviews and combined some suggestions.  I used one can of pure pumpkin, cut the sugar in half, used 2 cups flour and 1 cup rolled oats.  Cut the cloves way back.  The muffins turned out ok.  Nice texture.  Not at all sweet, but a nice flavor.  Next time will add a bit more sweetness.  Recipe is easily adjusted to your tastes.

While reading the ingredients I asked myself, "Why allspice, and everything else additional?" All spice is all the spices you need for pumpkin dishes. The only thing I noticed was ginger wasn't called for. Clove is a strong taste so I replaced that with the ginger and it turned out really great that way.

VERY FANTASTIC.  Just what I wanted, a recipe for Pumpkin Muffins that were made from the raw pumpkin to the oven, all from natural ingredients.  It turned out beautiful to look at and so very tasty.  I bet when the grandkids get home from school I won't have any left for tomorrow.  More beautiful than any pre-made mix I have used.  This is going to be my main recipe for muffins from now on.  Oh, I thought I'd make my own pre-made mix by putting all dry ingredients in a jar (or zip bag)and when I want to make them again (if I'm in a hurry), I'll just pour out the dry mix from a jar and then add the oil and pumpkin puree.  And another thing, I made it without eggs, using about 1.5 tbsps Tapioca powder in it's place and adding moisture if needed when adding the oil and pumpkin.  See how nice they turned out?

I really enjoyed these muffins I also altered it and used whole wheat, & spelt flour, also flax meal and chia seeds inplace of the white flour,  I used 2 eggs like someone reccomended.  And I replaced the spices with pumpkin spice and added a little extra cinnamon.  I did put less sugar  1 1/4cup.  I did use fresh pumpkin puree as I bottled pumpkin puree this week.  The method of roasting pumpkin is super easy and now I have homeade puree all year.

These muffins were delicious. I followed the advice of others and cut the nutmeg and cloves in half. I also substituted the vegetable oil for unsweetened apple sauce. This recipe is going to be a new staple in my holiday cookbook!

I love spicy pumpkin flavors and kept all the spices at what the recipe called for.  I am always making mini muffins for the little ones to snack on or grab and go for breakfast and a single batch of this recipe produced 56 mini muffins!!!  Awesome!  Plus, the kids were hovering around the kitchen waiting for them to cool, and they loved them!  I made 2 changes to this recipe, first was using 2 cups pumpkin puree and the second was switching one cup of all purpose with one cup of whole wheat flour (I had a bunch left that needed to be used up).   Very moist, very flavorful, it's going in my recipe box for future uses!  Thank you!

These muffins are perfect and delicious! Nice crust on the outside, tender and moist on the inside. I added pecans, golden raisins and a touch of molasses. I also skipped the allspice and halved the cloves and ginger. I also used canned pumpkin this time as I had no whole pumpkin at the moment. I think they would also be good with whole wheat flour.

I followed this recipe to a T except that I used canned pumpkin puree.  There is way too much spice in these muffins and the flavor almost burns your tongue.  The aroma is wonderful, but the spice is overwhelming and I could not taste any pumpkin.  The muffins rose to a beautiful peak and I topped with a streusel topping. I will half the nutmeg and add a little ginger.

It seemed like the recipe called for an aweful lot of sugar. I used 1 3/4 c instead of 2, not wanting to tweak it too much without trying it first. It was good. The spice amounts seemed way excessive, especially for my young boys. I used the cinnamon and salt as written and cut the rest in 1/2. The result was the perfect amount of spice. I used 1/2 applesauce/1/2 oil. 
UPDATE: I made this again with the same modifications and a crumb top. Super! Made the crumb top using 
2/3 cup packed brown sugar 
3/4 cup rolled oats 
1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
6 tablespoons butter

Everyone who likes this recipe seems to have not followed it. The amount of spices is overwhelming. The texture of these muffins is very dense. Using this recipe for 12 muffins, each muffin cup was almost overflowing with batter. They didn't get much bigger although they did develop nice domes.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  After reading other reviews, I used 1 cup white all purpose flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup rolled oats.  I also only used 2/3 cup sugar.  I used one can of pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling, just canned pumpkin) and it only had 2 1/2 cups of pumpkin in it, so I added 1/2 cup applesauce to make up for the difference.  I also replaced half of the oil with applesauce. And, I added 1/2 cup golden raisins and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts for added flavor. With these changes, I was afraid the muffins would turn out gummy - but to my surprise, they did not!  They were very substantial - tall and sturdy, but still moist.  My kids gobbled them up!  

I got about 19 muffins from this recipe.  After baking, I put some aside for breakfast and then froze the rest.  I usually freeze muffins and then put them in a plastic bag in the morning and put them in my kids' lunches. By the time snack time rolls around, they have thawed and they are great!

I read past reviews on these before making and cut back on the spices by half except for the cinnamon which I kept as the whole amount. These are good, kept their shape nicely and would be good with some nuts. I was going to do a streusel topping but forgot and I am glad I did because the muffins rose nicely. The whole family liked them although they said I could have used the original spice amounts called for. I will be making these again using the original recipe.

These are moist and delicious.  I cheated as well and used one whole can of pumpkin and 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice.  I also substituted one cup of flour for oat flour and oil for browned butter.  I know they are delicious when my three year old sits quietly and eats.

These were amazingly good.  The only change I made was using half a cup less sugar and adding a cream-cheese frosting.  With the frosting they tasted like carrot cake.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These are great as is, but I made an even healthier option by increasing the pumpkin and subtracting all oil/shortening, cutting the sugar in half, and substituting whole wheat flour for half of the overall flour. Comes out great and my husband and kids gobble them up just as fast.

Absolutely fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly with one exception - I cut the sugar to one and a half cups. I even used my own fresh pureed pumpkin, although I'm sure canned would be good too! I must say these are absolutely beautiful, I'd even say bakery-quality, muffins. They are moist and have a perfect consistency - cakey on the inside, and that perfect, ever so slight crunch on the outside. :) Will definitely make these again!

These were moist and dense muffins-I liked them! They were 12 pretty big muffins, I could have made more and had them a more normal size. I used someones healthy suggestions and used less than 1cup of sugar and used sugar free applesauce. I also used canned pumpkin to make it easier. With all the spices it included I was expecting more flavor, but they were still good.

These were very good. I made a few changes to make them healthier. 1c a.p. flour, 1c whole wheat flour, 1c oats, applesauce instead of oil, canned pumpkin.  I only had cinnamon so I just used that to spice them up.

I made these muffins yesterday.  They are delicious!!  I did make a couple changes.  I actually substituted roasted butternut squash for the pumpkin and I didn't have Allspice, so I doubled the cinnamon.  This will be my go to recipe for pumpkin (or squash) spice muffins!

Wow, these are OMG so good!  I've made them twice now and frost them with cream cheese frosting. My husband and I are totally addicted to them. I don't even think they deserve to be called muffins. With the frosting, we refer to them as cupcakes.  I mean, it does call for 2 CUPS of white sugar, after all. :)

My only complaint was I ended up with batter for 22 muffins but they were nice, moist  flavourful,  i added grated carrot and nuts to the second batch, just for texture.  Definitely a keeper.

Oh my gosh these are awesome!  I used a 15oz can of pumpkin puree for the sugar pumpkin.  I decreased the cloves to a few dashes because cloves can be overwhelming.  I was out of allspice so I added a dash of ginger.  I used half white and half brown sugar because I didn't have the full amount of white sugar called for.  This recipe makes 24 muffins not 12 as stated.  This is a fantastic recipe and would make great pumpkin bread as well.

I made the recipe exactly as is (except with canned pumpkin) and they were DELICIOUS!   I down-scaled the recipe to 3/4 for the amount of pumpkin I had, but I got 16 muffins instead of 9 ;-)   Add about 1 cup chopped pecans if you're making the full batch.  I don't need to look any further for the perfect pumpkin muffin recipe!

Yummy!  I didn't have allspice and reduced the clove and nutmeg by half and it turned out great..  Very tasty and easy.  The kitchen smells great and the muffins are terrific.   Canned pumpkin works perfectly.  When I made this, i ended up with 18 muffins.

These were really good. I did omit the allspice just because I didn't have any. Everything else I kept the same. It made 24 muffins for me though not 12.

Turned out great!  I had to substitue pumpkin pie spice for some of the spices.  I baked the pumpkin the night before, put the pulp in the fridge and made the muffins the next day with great results.  I kept all the measurements the same and got 18 regular sized muffins out of it.

Wow!  Really yummy muffins!  The recipe doubles easily and made 3 dozen very large muffins.  Like other reviewers I made substitutions as needed: 1/2 the sugar, 1/2 whole wheat flour, applesauce for oil flaxseed mixed with water for eggs.  Delicious!!

I love these muffins!  I used, instead,  1 cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar and replaced a small bit of the oil with applesauce.  Sprinkled a tiny bit of raw sugar over the tops, as well.  Wow!  Five stars for sure.    And I think you could safely decrease the sugar a bit more.

these were edible but that was about it. Too much spices following the recipes exactly left all of us with numb tongues! Honestly could not taste the pumpkin at all once cooked, and I even added a bit more then listed. Was def. disappointed with these :(

I just now made these and they are wonderful. But yes, I did make some changes so I didn't give it 5 stars as I think the spices would have been way too much.  I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup oatmeal. 1 cup natural sugar and 1/4 cup agave. 1/2'd spices except cinnamon. Replaced oil with same amount of natural, unsweetened applesauce.  7 year old son and I are eating them as they come out of the oven. Sooo good.

Amazing muffins!!  Made the pumpkin puree, added 1tbsp chia seeds and only 1 egg, 3tbsp yogurt and no oil, and added walnuts.  Didn't have nutmeg or cloves, so just added 2tsp of allspice instead and the cinnamon.  Very easy to make - canned pumpkin would make it quicker - very tasty!!

I made this recipe EXACTLY as stated, but used a 15oz can of pumpkin instead of the actual pumpkin. The dough was very thick and bready. The muffins were dry and bready as well, with no flavor. AND it made 18 large muffins as written. Definitely not making this one again!

I love these muffins because they actually call for "real" pumpkin (not from a can) and were easy to make.  I found that the pumpkin flavour was subtle though not a bad thing for picky eaters like my husband.

Fantastic, my daycare kids and my own children LOVE them.  I used 1/2 spelt, 1/2 ww flour. Cut back the sugar and used only cane sugar.  My recipe made 23 regular size muffins.  :) Mmmmm, great with a coffee mid morning.

Delicious muffins! This was my first time cooking a sugar pumpkin and it was really easy and fun.I've always just used canned pumkin but the fresh is so much better! I can't get over how moist and delicious these muffins are.I used applesauce for part of the oil and I just used half the amount of cloves.I also used oatmeal which I ground in the blender and wheat flour for half of the white flour.I may add some craisins next time just for fun but they are delicious as is.

I followed the directions completely except for two things- I used canned pumpkin pie instead of a real pumpkin for ease, since its really smooth and creamy and already has sugar + seasonings. I didn't have any nutmeg, so I added brown sugar instead. This made 24 full sized muffins, not 12! They weren't as moist as I was expecting, and definetly not as sweet as I was thinking either. They were a little dry, but the spice flavor is fantastic, they're fairly easy and next time I might try using a real pumpkin.

These muffins are very good. They remind me of Tim Hortons Pumpkin Spice Muffins. I used 2 cups whole wheat, 1/2c rolled oats, 1/2c wheat bran, 1c organic sucanant, 1 single serving of applesauce, 1/4c veg oil, 1 14oz can pumpkin, and a slash a milk. Cooked these at 350 for 17 minutes and they were perfect. I fed theses to my two year old daughter and she loved them. Thanx for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Sooo Gooood! I added chocolate chips and walnuts and did the health conscious replacements as suggested (2 c. whole wheat, 1c. oats, applesauce instead of oil, and 1/2 brown // 1/2 white sugar). Next time I will see if I can get away with even less sugar. These didn't seem too healthy to enjoy at all!

Great muffin for fall. The only things that I changed were: 1/3 cup oil and 1/3 unsweetened apple sauce, 2 cups stone ground whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar.

I usually try to make a recipe exactly as written the first time to give a fair review.  However, a recent change in a family member's health status has required us to modify recipes for health reasons.  So...I made these with 2 c. whole wheat flour, 1 c. oats, unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and 1 c. sugar/1 c. Splenda.  They were delicious and I will definitely make them again.  I also used canned pumpkin and 6 tsp. pumpkin pie spice because I'm lazy. :-)

These muffins are very tasty and moist.  It is July so I did not have a fresh pumpkin on hand, but did use a 15 oz can of pumpkin instead and it worked just as well.

Replace white flour with 2 cups whole wheat flour and one cup rolled oats; Replace oil one for 1/2 c cinnamon applesauce &1/3c additional pumpkin puree; 2 eggs and 1/2 c sugar. I used canned pumpkin. I got 18 full regular muffins. Very delicious and healthy - to make it a bit of a treat for my kids add in a cup of semi chocolate chips.

These are great.  They stay moist and keep well.  I made the recipe with can pumpkin and part whole wheat flour and it was very good.  My family loved it.

Turned out great! Taste brings to mind gingerbread cookies. I might try the recipe with less vegetable oil next time. They were wonderful with fresh pumpkin puree.

Pretty good but found the spices to be too much and I even left out the allspice. I ground my own nutmeg and cloves, so perhaps the author's spices are less pungent. I might try one less egg next time as they were a tad chewier than I'd like.

This recipe definitely makes MORE than 12 muffins.  I only had 1 egg on hand (and didn't miss the other 2 at all) and the recipe still made 17 muffins for me.  It is definitely heavy on the spices, which I loved, but I would second others who said that if you would like it on the milder side, decrease the spices by about 1/4.

Delicious recipe. Too much cloves IMHO. Gives an interesting aftertaste. Use only 1 tsp and use fresh nutmeg.

Straining pumpkin puree for excess liquid is usually done when making your own - if muffins are too moist, strain puree first.

I got 23 good sized muffins. Substituted 1 c whole wheat for some of the flour.

Pretty good- I used fresh pumpkin turned out moist -almost too much- tried cooking them longer. Sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Could still use more cinnamon.

These just came out of my oven, and they are great! I halved the recipe which made a dozen muffins. I used canned pumpkin, added rolled oats and used half white and half brown sugar. These are sweet, but not too sweet and they're very moist!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it just like the recipe and substituted can pumpkin and then I made a cream cheese and powdered sugar mixture put 1/2 the batter in the muffin pans then scooped the cream cheese in and then the remaining batter followed by sprinkling them with pecans and baking.  They turned out awesome!!  You have got to try these!

This was just beautiful! I made it into a loaf, and substitute the oil with butter since I do not like the smell and taste of oil (I creamed the butter), and they were soo fragrant and delicious! I will definitely be keeping this one! Thanks!

Funny that this should be the "star" recipe on the website today...I just made these on Friday for my co-workers.  They loved these muffins!  I used slightly more than half of a 29 oz. can of pumpkin puree instead of fresh pumpkin, put in half brown sugar and half white sugar, and added some chopped Hershey's dark chocolate to the batter.  Awesome!

I added 1 cup of oats instead of the flour and used brown sugar (no reason).  My 4 year-old loved them; I think she add half a dozon throughout the day.  Great fall snack.

The best muffins I've ever mad.  People are impressed.  I used canned pumpkin.  To make a little healthier I used half whole wheat flour half white flour and used applesauce instead of oil.  I sprinkled the top with oats before cooking which gave them a store bought look. SO GREAT!

These are wonderful!  I used canned pumpkin but next year will grow some pumpkins and make them with those.  Subbed applesauce for half the oil and cut the sugar down by half a cup.  Used whole wheat pastry flour.  Also added ginger to the spice mix.  So perfect for a blustery autumn day when it's best to stay indoors with a kitty on your lap, a cup of tea, and something yummy to eat!

These came out yummy! I used a full can of pumpkin puree - 3.5 cups. And so used 2 sticks of butter in place of the oil. They were delicious! My kids ate every last one. They made 9 muffins and 6 HUGE muffin heads.

Good muffin, my modifications were to go with 2 eggs instead of 3 and use applesauce for half of the oil. A little chewy, but still tasty.

These were fantastic.  Following other reviews, I cut all the spices but cinnamon in half.  I frosted them with a cream cheese frosting (cram cheese, powdered sugar and almond extract) and they were so good!  The recipe made 24 regular sized muffins.

We made this recipe today.  We used half brown and half white sugar as someone suggested.  These were the best muffins we ever made!!!  Our whole family loved them.  We used fresh sugar pumpkins and the recipe came out just great.  Can't wait to make another batch!!

I thought these muffins were very good.  I made them once according to the recipe and once with several of my own changes, and liked the second batch better!  
1)I used one 15oz. can of pumpkin, 
2)used half whole wheat, half all-purpose   flour, 
3)and reduced the eggs to 2 based on others' advice.  
4)I added a little oil (about a T or two), 
5)reduced the cinnamon to 1tsp, 
6)added 1tsp of ground ginger, 
7)used 1.5 tsp baking powder and 
8)only 1 tsp of baking soda.  
9)Then I added 1.5 c chocolate chips.  They were fabulous!  Everyone who ate one asked for the recipe.

These are extremely good. I used 2 cups of canned pumpkin instead of roasting a pumpkin at home, subbed out half the white sugar for dark brown sugar, added some ginger and black pepper, and topped them with candied pepitas (shelled pumpkin seeds). Next time I think I'd add more of the sweet spices, as I like a lot of spice in my muffins, but the flavor is very good just as is. Great texture too. Will definitely be my go-to recipe from now on.

These muffins are awesome! I did make a number of changes to them though to make them a bit healthier...
I used 1 c white flour, 1 c wheat flour and 1 cup oats. I added a ripe banana, 1/2 c water  & 1 egg in place of the 3 eggs. I replaced the pumpkin with 1 can of pumpkin. I used 1 c sugar and 3/4 c splenda (baking). And, I threw in 1/2 c mini chocolate chips. I made them in muffin top pans and it made 18 large muffin tops. YUM!

Gotta admit, I'm a sucker for a good muffin recipe and this one definitely fills the bill.  I've made these several times now.  This recipe makes quite a bit of batter even when prepared just as directed.  This time around I added some extra goodies - raisins & chopped pecans so that increased the volume a bit more.  Thanks to the great advice from What a Dish, I decided to make 12 regular sized muffins and a small loaf.  The only other change I made this time was to use EVOO to make these even healthier.  With all that wonderful pumpkin and spice flavor, you will never notice the taste of olive oil.  Since I'm a spice lover I used every bit of spice called for and thought the taste was out of this world.  Another change I might consider in the future is to sub out a little white flour for whole wheat.  But this recipe made without any changes is a winner in my book.

My daughter and I love the Pumpkin Muffins that they have at Dunkin Donuts but that is a seasonal thing I they just stop making them until the fall and my daughter and I are so bummed out. So I set out on a quest to find muffins similiar. These are very good although not close to DD's but we'll settle on these until the fall. I did cut the spices down to 1 tsp each except for the cinnamon. Having done that I still find the spices to be a little overpowering. I can't imagine what it would taste like having used the exact measurements as written. I think it would be too much. Regardless they were very moist and very tasty. I also drizzles the tops of them with a glaze of powdered sugar and half and half. I definately will make these again.

This was a great switch from the boxed mixes I've been using.  I too used the canned puree and cut back on the spices.  I also went 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat on the flour and cut the sugar to only 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown.  Instead of oil I used 1 ripe banana and 1/3 c applesauce.  It turned out really yummy but not overly sweet, I may sprinkle cinnamon sugar on the tops next time before baking to add just a touch more sweet.  Thanks so much for a great snack for me and the kids!

These are the best homemade muffins ever! The only extra thing I did was add a small splash of milk to make it easier to stir.

I made these a couple of times over the Holidays. My husband and my co-workers went nuts for them!! I too used a 15oz canned pumpkin and for spices I used 1-1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice!! I have made them with and without chopped walnuts, both are great! I frosted about half of them with cream cheese frosting. Everyone enjoyed them both ways!! Incredibly moist. Will make again soon.

I made these with chocolate chips and used 1/3 cup oil 1/3 cup applesauce. I also left out the allspice. They are delicious! Just the right amount of spice and sweet.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I cut down on the amount of cloves, though kept everything else the same!  I used creme cheese frosting for the top.  Excellent...my whole family loved this.

The spice in the muffins was a little too much for my taste.  Next time I will cut down or omit the allspice.  I went ahead and added cream cheese frosting on top. My picky 7 year old loved them!! He thought it was really cool that we took a "real pumpkin" and made something with it besides a jack-o-lantern.

Very good muffins. It felt great not to waste all the halloween pumpkins for a change! 

I substituted olive oil and chinese five-spice instead of the vegetable oil, ground cloves and allspice.

I'm gonna give this 4 stars because mine turned out well and they're tasty, but I changed up the recipe a bit after realizing that I didn't have any baking soda! (ohnoes!) So I used 1 cup pancake mix and 2 cups flour. I cut the spices in half, then totaled them and used that amount of pumpkin pie spice which I believe was 3.5 teaspoons. THEN! I stole the cream cheese filling from the Chocolate Surprise Cupcake recipe, omitted the chocolate chips, and put it on top of these muffins before I baked them. I should have put it more *inside* since it wasn't heavy enough to sink as it stayed on top and just spread out. It was still tasty though! My fiance really liked these, and I do too. Mine weren't overly sweet though, I didn't cut down the sugar like others requested. But maybe I have a different sweet tooth?

This recipe turned out wonderfully.  I did modify the spices as I did not have all-spice so I eliminated it and cut back on the cloves as suggested by others.  I also substituted applesauce for the oil and added an oat topping w/oats, margarine, sugar, cinnamon and flour.  Yum!  Great snack for the kids after school!

I followed the recipe except I omitted allspice, as I had none.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that you could cut down on the cloves as it's a bit overpowering.  The muffins turned out great besides that...great texture.  I also found that it made about 20 muffins.  Great recipe - I will be making this again - minus some of the cloves.

These were incredible! Very moist and my husband ate 5 of them in one sitting and loves them. One word of caution, the recipe appears to say it makes 12 muffins. So I decided to triple the batch to make them for friends. I ended up with seven and a half dozen muffins. Also, I did use normal jack-o-lantern pumpkins and they turned out great.

I haved the spice portions and also substituted one cup of oats for one cup of flour. I added about a 1/4 cup of raisins to general approval. I poured all the dough into one bread pan, which was too much and meant baking for about an hour to an hour and a half at 350 degrees. Done again, I would divide it into two. Good reviews from all who ate it!

These were pretty good - not the coffee shop kind I'd hoped for but definitely worth making again.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the amount of cloves in half, and next time I will decrease it even more.  I didn't have any allspice, so omitted that.  I added 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I used 1/3 cup plain yogurt + 1/3 cup canola oil to cut down on the fat a little.  I also used a 15 oz can of pumpkin puree instead of whole pumpkin for the sake of convenience.  I added chopped walnuts and topped with "Cream Cheese Frosting II."

Very good -- went easy on the cloves and allspice, did half white sugar and half brown sugar, and used 2/3 whole wheat flour.  My only criticism that I didn't see mentioned in other reviews is that they're very sweet.  If you want more of a breakfast muffin and less of a dessert muffin you might want to cut down on the sugar.

This was fantastic- I used the canned pumpkin- got way more than 12.  They were a little heavy on the spice- which usually I don't have a problem with spices but it toned down nicely with cream cheese frosting!  I used to work at Perkins and our seasonal muffin was pumpkin with cream cheese frosting- this definitely compares!

Oh.My.Goodness!!  We absolutely LOVE these muffins. They're huge and heavy. I certainly get more than 12 muffins out of this recipe.  These have become a household fave...I must make them frequently because the kids love them, *I* love them, we eat them up in a hurry. Good stuff!  Thanks!

My family absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I baked it in a bundt pan for about 50-55 min and it turned out perfect.  Sliced, then stored in a ziploc bag and took camping.  It was so moist.  I used the canned pumpkin and varied the spices to what I had on hand.

We also used canned pumpkin. For a treat, I jazz these up with mini-chocolate chips.  Wow!  It makes them soooo delish! I have used many recipes with pumpkin.  This is by far our FAVORITE!!!!  I made 18 regular-sized muffins and 24 mini muffins with this recipe.  They still didn't last long.  My kids and husband rave.  Thanks for posting this!

Very good recipe.  I have made these many times.  Not only do my kids love them, but they're a great way to get the  kids to eat fruits/vegetables (pumpkin), especially if you grate some carrot in the mix.  My only change would be to cut down on the spice a little bit.  The cloves/allspice taste is a bit much.  Other than that, these are excellent.

These muffins are wonderful! The amount of spice was perfect for our taste.  My only alterations were using canned pumpkin, and sprinkling the tops with sugar, which added a nice touch.  They were light and moist...not dry at all, like some other reviewers experienced.  Next time I may add chopped walnuts or pecans.  I was able to make a dozen, healthy sized, muffins plus 3 dozen mini-muffins.  Yummy!!!  Thanks, Julie!

I did change these a bit to suit my taste, but they turned out great.  I left out 1/2 cup flour to ensure that they were moist. I also did my seasonings differently too.  I added ginger, but didn't put in as much cloves or nutmeg.  I guess you could use pupkin pie spice and add to taste.  They turned out wonderful though and everyone raved out them.  I have made them several times since I found this recipe and each time they are gone in a day or two.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Good, easy recipe.  I substituted canned pumpkin for the puree, eliminated cloves and allspice as others have suggested, and dusted them in powdered sugar.  Also used melted butter in place of vegetable oil.  I didn't find them at all dry, but they were a little plain.  Tasty little recipe, but a little bit dull.

This was good, wasn't as moist as I would have like it to be, but still pretty good. I didn't have allspice so I just omitted that, otherwise I followed the recipe exact, the spices where not overpowering like others have suggested, it was just right to acompany the pumpkin. Also, I just used canned pumpkin, as I've read commercially canned pumpkin could actually be more flavorful. It'll probably be fine either way.

This were very good muffins..but I even cut the cloves down to 1/2 tsp. and it was still a bit clove heavy.  I used a 15 oz. can of pumpkin instead of the fresh puree, for time reasons, and they were very moist and tasty....I will just cut the clove down even more next time.

This recipe turned out great.  You have to adjust the spices according to you taste.  I used 2 t. cinnamon, 1 t nutmeg, 1/2 t cloves and 1/2 t allspice.  That was just right for my tastes.  If you like it spicier, increase them, if it is still too spicy, decrease them.  I also used 3/4 c white sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar.  They were still plenty sweet.  I may cut it back a little more next time.

This recipe was amazing! I didn't use cloves and I only used 1/2 teaspoon of allspice.  I also sprinkled sugar on top. It was enough to make a loaf of pumkin bread too. It was deffinetly a winner.

These were very tasty and fall-ish, but they tasted a little dry.  The consistency was not dry, but they tasted that way.  I might add a little sour cream next time to give it a little more of a moist texture.

I really liked this recipe.  My husband even at 4 of them and he doesn't like muffins!  I used canned pumpkin and only cut the spices back a little.  I like it spicy!  I will definatley make them again.

Outstanding pumpkin muffin recipe.  Except for the cinnamon, definitely cut those spice amounts in half, though.  I like them spicey and they are MORE than spicey enough with 1 tsp each of nutmeg, cloves, and 1/2 tsp of allspice.  I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown, and also added a simple cream cheese icing on top.  Delicious!

Very good recipe. Used canned pumpkin puree and kept the spices the same. Also made this into a loaf and served with some yummy pumpkin butter from Williams Sonoma.

These are the best pumpkin muffins I've ever made! They're moist, rich and flavorful, with none of the blandness that some pumpkin muffins have. I used canned pumpkin instead of fresh, and I cut the nutmeg to 1 tsp. and the allspice to 1/2 tsp. -- the rest of the spices I used in their original quantities. This made 24 regular-sized muffins.

WOW!!! These are FABULOUS! So plump and moist! Definately "coffee house quality"! I substituted the fresh pumpkin and all the spices for pumpkin pie filling and added chocolate chips. I'm making them for our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner this weekend so I doubled the recipe without reading the reviews before I made them. Needless to say I'm STILL baking muffins! This recipe would have been plenty as it makes approximately 2 dozen! Well good thing they are SO tasty!!! Shouldn't be a problem getting rid of them!

Very good recipe. Perfect for this time of year. I Used the canned pumpkin as well...the batter was delicious! The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars was I think the baking time is a little off. My muffins seemed a teeny bit overdone at 20 minutes. I think 17-18 would have sufficed, they rise quickly. Very tasty, and I think I will experiment with low-fat versions with yogurt and eggbeaters...

I followed the recipe exactly substituting with a 15 oz can of pumpkin.  Came out awesome!  Easy to make, bakes quickly, and my picky 6 year old absolutely loves them.  Ate 4 before they could cool off.  I think I will try cutting the clove and nutmeg in half next time. I feel 1 teaspoon of each spice may be enough.  I served them with a chicken salad on mixed greens, cantalope, and strawberries.  Huge summer lunch hit!!!

These were super tasty and my boyfriend ate them all within two days. He even took some into work to share with his friends but ended up hiding them and secretly eating them later because he loved them so much. I cut the cloves to a teaspoon and half and they turned out great. But the recipe makes A LOT of batter, way more then a dozen. It made a dozen jumbo sized muffin (grocery store size) and will for sure make 24 regular sized.

I didn't use fresh pumpkin either, rather I found that omitting the spices and instead using canned pumpkin pie mix makes some TASTY muffins! Very big, thick, moist, and taste just like pumpkin pie. I also subsituted brown sugar for 1 cup of the sugar to give it more spice.

I have made this recipe twice using can pumpkin both times and it turned out wonderfully!  Great recipe just the way it's written.  I don't think it was too spicy at all. I gave these out in my Christmas package of goodies this year and got wonderful reviews!  I added a maple glaze over the top of them.  YUM!

I made these muffins again using canned pumpkin, 3 tcp of cinnamon, 3 teaspoons of nutmeg and 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice since I was out of cloves. I also used melted butter flavored shortening instead of the oil since I was out of that as well.....they still came out perfect! I even made these with a mix of millet flour and gluten free baking mix for my husband who is allergic to wheat and his came out beautiful as well. This is a no fail recipe!

Although this recipe was good, it was not a 5 star recipe. It was more like spice cake than pumpkin bread.  I tried it once with apple sauce instead or oil.  Don't do that. It does not come out moist enough and looks dull.  Definitely, do not use 2 tbls of cloves that is way too much.  I think chopped nuts would improve this recipe although I have never tried it.

Really good, but I'd personally reduce the amount of cloves to 1 1/2 tsp.  I made them with 2 tsp. and it was a bit too spicy for my taste.  I made them again with 1 1/2 and it was delicious.  I used canned pumpkin because I didn't have time to use fresh.  I also got more like 24 instead of the 12 it says.  Maybe they mean 12 big ones like you buy in the store.  I just used cupcake size pans.

I used organic canned pumpkin from Trader Joes and these were outstanding.  My girlfriend said "They could sell these at Starbucks!"  hahaha  I made one tray of muffins and a few small loaves - they're all great with cream cheese!

These were fantastic! I don't like pupmpkin pie, never had anything else pumpkin, but wanted to try these. My boys were eager as well.  I used 2 c previously prepared puree (using the boil method) Other modifications: 2 cups whole wheat flour subbed in and the sugar I did half white half brown.  Oh my goodness these were scrumptious!!  My boys devoured them (the picky little guys they tend to be)  Definitely a keeper recipe. mm mmm

I enjoyed the heavily tasting cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon in this recipe.  I used canned pumpkin and whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour.  I think they were a little too sweet - I like the idea of shaving off the sugar and oil and perhaps using apple sauce or even honey.  However, great recipe. Definitely a keeper.

Totally yummy! Moist, not too heavy. I made these for my son's class for his birthday(in October). I used canned pumpkin and topped them with a orange tinted cream cheese icing. I think they would be good with raisins. Will try that next time.

Delicious. Should have read other reviews first and cut back on the cloves. You don't need 2 tsps of cloves. It was good with that much, but I'd cut it at least in half next time. I added raisins too and would keep that addition.

There is too much Clove in the Recipe. I just made the recipe "as is" and burnt my mouth. Try 1/2 Teaspoon.

Very good and moist and easy.  I used canned pumpkin, eliminated the cloves and reduced the nutmeg by half.

They were so easy to make and were a big hit! The bake time was a little off for me because I used a silicone "tin" and a metal tin. The metal tin took significantly longer than the silicon one.

My kids loved these, they described it as gingerbread with pumpkin pie! I made exactly the same and was moist and good. They come out dark, but not burned or anything. I’m making a bunch of loafs for Christmas gifts!

Made mini cakes instead, used mix of flours: almond, buckwheat, coconut, and sorghum. Only had cinnamon, but added maple syrup. Topped with cream cheese icing!

Perfect muffins! I’ve used a pumpkin from farm pumpkin patch. Turned out delicious. I have also added 3 cranberries to each muffin cup prior to adding the butter, nice combination to cut the sweetness a bit. Thank you for this beautiful recipe!

If you are not an experienced baker or even if you are - be very wary of 2 tsp of cloves.  That would be way too much and must be a typo.  Any more than l/8 tsp would be overpowering.   I wish this would be corrected as it is probably a very good recipe.

These were lovely, I added a crumble topping but they are great without it. However it says 12 muffins and this recipe actually made 24 large muffins... not sure what's up with that.

Super moist and delicious.  I took the advice on the other reviews and cut the spice in half (good thing). I also used canned pumpkin and added raisins.  I highly recommend.

Real good!
I halved the recipe and still had a bunch of batter leftover (after filling 6), but I think that because my muffin pan is kinda shallow.

I made these today with a pumpkin my neighbor gave me. They are absolutely tender and delicious! I used half the amount of clove and cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and ground Ginger. No allspice. I also made a quick cream cheese topping. Fantastic!

The perfect pumpkin muffin. Deceptively simple recipe, but the result is perfectly balanced, with great texture and flavors. The only tweak I made was to use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and it works great.

Have made these a few times by now, in both muffin and loaf form, and with both fresh puree and canned. Foolproof every time.

Fun story: brought these to a party full of skeptics who were dubious about the weird American penchant for putting squash in desserts. And the muffins were a hit! The world has a few more pumpkin dessert fans wandering around it now, thanks to this recipe.

The only change I made is that I added my own crumble topping to it because crumbly, sweet toppings make me happy.  But as far as the muffin itself, I followed the recipe exactly  and it was delicious.  Some say the spices were too much, but I thought they were great.  I do think it was tastiest (is that a word?) the next day after sitting covered by tin foil all night.

I love this muffin.  Although I refer to it as pumpkin gingerbread.  :)  It is very spicy and while delicious, not exactly the standard pumpkin muffin I have made in the past.  If you don't like gingerbread, then you can always halve the amount of spices and make it less spicy.  I substitute canned pumpkin (for fresh), stevia baking blend (for sugar), Kodiak Cakes Power Cakes mix (for flour), and apple sauce (for oil).  I call them Pumpkin Power Muffins.  I added a neufchatel/egg/vanilla filling in the latest version.  YUM!  So glad I found this recipe.  One of these days I will make it the way it is written, but will have to stick to the power muffin version for now.

This recipe made 19 large muffins, not 12. I'm not complaining, just saying it makes more than 12. I omitted the raisins and added walnuts. It made a very nice, dense muffin. I was in a hurry so I just used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of all the individual spices. These would be very nice with cream cheese frosting. :)

Overall a good recipe! I just used pumpkin spice since I didn't have some of the spices it called for, and just kind of "seasoned to tasted" it. I do advise that you start off by baking for 15 minutes rather than 20. The first dozen I baked at 20 minutes and it was much too long. Muffins came out overcooked and dense. 15 minutes worked perfectly. I  added a dash of salt at the device of my roommate to help bring out some of the sweetness.  This recipe works will if you had chocolate chips as well. Will use again!

I was excited to find a recipe that didn't use canned pumpkin. I made this recipe with a few variations: brown sugar instead of white and halved the amount, a mixture of white, wheat and oat flour,  put apple slices and drizzle of oil in my nutribullet and used mixture in place of oil.  These muffins are great and recipe is so forgiving of variations. These muffins turned out beautifully.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These turned out well, but I agree with some who have suggested that the spices could be scaled back - in particular the cloves and nutmeg. I would make this again, but am much more likely to experiment with other recipes first...

These are very good, and I used canned pumpkin.  I can only imagine how good they would be with fresh pumpkin purée.  I made them as the recipe described and they were moist and tasty.  I think I would add a tiny bit more salt the next time, but otherwise they were very good and easy.  I made them for a friend who is dairy free, and she thought they were a great treat!

I usually read reviews before making, but this time i didn't. That was a mistake. Made it just like it said. They have no pumpkin flavor at all. Very strong nutmeg and clove.

I've made these 3 times. After the second time, I decided to switch the baking soda/baking powder measurements. When you use the baking soda amount written in this, the muffins tasted very salty with a slight bitter taste. To me it makes much more sense to have more baking powder than soda. Third time these were perfect . No bitter taste.  My family and friends love them!

I  used pure canned pumpkin and also made them as minis and super minis!

I took them to school to share with the middle school students I work with and they were a HUGE hit!

I will definitely make them again!

Good recipe but if you use fresh spices, reduce this by at least half. I dunno how people got palatable results with these measurements. Another measurement problem is that this makes about 24 muffins.

This is a quick pumpkin recipe. I decreased the oil to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup more pumpkin. The end result was a moist chocolate chip muffin. That is it. There was not much in the way of pumpkin flavoring. The chocolate chips overpower any other flavors.

I used part brown sugar and part white, and used about 1/2 c of quick oats in place of 1/2 c flour.   The batter looked quite thick and I was concerned , but the texture is nice and they taste quite good.   I did cut back on cloves and substituted about 1/2 tsp . pumpkin pie spice mix, along with the other suggested spices.

Muffins were delicious, moist and flavourful. I used 2 cups of canned pure pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling). My husband and I love them and plan to make again very soon 
Note: the recipe yielded 15 large muffins for me

I did not cheat like some of the others, I used a real not canned pumpkin like the recipe called for. I did however change the spices. Instead I used 2 tsp of a  mix called pumpkin pie spice, it contains all the spices listed plus ginger. The result was fabulous! Moist and perfectly spiced muffins. This has now become one of my favorite recipes.

I've made these twice, once with all pumpkin puree, once with half pumpkin, half butternut squash (had leftovers of both floating around the fridge).  LOVE THESE MUFFINS as is. They are a great treat.

Loved by all my children and myself. Used olive oil as that was all I had on hand and 1/4 tsp less cloves and all spice.  They were perfect!  Must have two cups pumpkin purée (not pumpkin pie filling) or they will be way too spicey. Will definitely be making again and again. Moist and fluffy!! Perfect 24 count

Delicious, light and huge muffins. I, too, substituted a can of pumpkin and it worked very well. Because I didn't have enough flour, I used a cup of all purpose flour, a cup of oat flour, and a cup of whole wheat flour. Also subbed unsweetened applesauce for oil, and 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar. I'm sure it would be delicious as written, I was just low on ingredients but needed to make muffins in a pinch. Definitely a keeper.

Very easy recipe, I also added about a short cup of chopped up pecans and then i put a couple of mini marshmallows in the middle of each one instead of using frosting. Great for holiday company or for a quick grab in the morning.

These turned out very well, however, I cut back on the cloves and allspice.  It would have been overpowering if I'd used as much as the recipe called for.  However, when I cut those in half the muffins were delicious.

Loved them. I will make them again. These muffins were very moist & tasty. From the previous reviews, I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1 tsp nutmeg & 1/2 tsp allspice. Next time I may try 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg & 1/4 tsp allspice to taste the difference.

I made some changes to the recipe after reading the reviews and adjusting to what I have but these turned out pretty moist and good! I used a whole can of pumpkin, which I love because I wouldn't have to deal with leftover pumpkin puree although my dog would love having some. I used 6 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spices though I think I could've used more. Instead of 3 eggs, I used 1 egg and 2 table spoons of flax seed meal mixed with water. Instead of 2 cups granulated sugar, I used 1 cup of brown sugar and it was still plenty sweet for me. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil it didn't taste like coconut at all and it was still very moist. I used 1/2 cup oat meal and 2 1/2 cups AP flour, but I could've used more oatmeal. Next time, I might try add some raisin or dried currants or cranberries.

I made these muffins for my coffee cart. Sold every single one. I used 1/2 organic unbleached flour and  organic whole wheat pastry flour.  I also grind all my own spices fresh and 1/2 the sugar between white and golden brown.  I also added cherry juice sweetened cranberries.  I topped it with an oatmeal streusel.  These will be a fall favorite!

More of a cupcake than a muffin, it was for a birthday so I added white chocolate chips (2/3 of a 226g bag in the batter and the rest I put on top of the warm muffin so the heat of the cake made them stick). I also added 2 tsp of powdered ginger and used only 1 tsp of clove. oh and most importantly, I used sweet potato and carrot purée. Moist and delicious! I made 25 tennis ball sized muffins.

Tried this- used 1/2 cup less sugar and added 2T molasses and about 1t  extra ginger and allspice. 

Yummy! i think next time I'll do with seeds or nuts for a heartier texture.

I made them with all purpose gluten free flour and oats.  I used only one cup of sugar and applesauce in place of oil like suggested.  I did sprinkle the tops with a little cinnamon before baking.  They came out great!!!  Thank you!!!

I thought it was a five-star recipe, but I made some modifications that other reviewers did. I did whole wheat flour and rolled oats instead of white flour, and I did one cup white sugar and 3/4 cup maple syrup. I also ran out of half the cinnamon, and I only put in 1/4 tsp cloves and 1 tsp nutmeg, and I didn't put in allspice because I didn't have any. I also threw in 3/4 tsp vanilla. The muffins were plenty sweet - I might even cut the maple syrup to 1/2 cup next time. I also used butternut squash instead of the pumpkin, although I'm sure pumpkin would be just as good. The muffins came out very sticky - I don't think the oats absorb as much of the liquid as the flour does, so I had to add more flour after the first round of muffins. Overall, this is a great base recipe, and I will be making these again!

Really super yummy! I'm not crazy about rating a recipe having made changes, but...I had some left over homemade chunky applesauce from Johnny Appleseed Day (school teachers!), so I doubled the recipe and used 2C pumpkin & 2C of the applesauce that had plenty of cunnamon & brown sugar.  Used pumpkin pie spice w some extra freshly grated nutmeg. Doubling it made 21 fairly large muffins, 36 mini muffins, and 2 mini loaves- I was making to share w/ a note, "Happy Fall, y'all!".

I've made this recipe SEVERAL times and every time, everyone loves it!  We have several allergies, so I substitute Bob's Red Mill baking flour for the flour and add 3 tsp of xanthum gum.  I substituted milled flaxseed and water for the eggs.  And I also used brown sugar instead of white and add chocolate chips.  I've made it exactly like the recipe and also with the changes...both were equally Delicious!!!!

When making this I was a little hesitant about the amount of spices and baking soda. I'm glad I didn't have allspice or cloves on hand to add to the recipe or else it would've been much too spicy, it's already pretty spicy with just the cinnamon and nutmeg. The texture is lovely but the initial taste of baking soda and strong spice is really unattractive. I also addes 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla, and I think that really improved the flavor

This was great! I cheated and used canned pumpkin and I added mini chocolate chips just because I had them. They were wonderful! So flavorful! Perfectly moist with a crispy and delicious top!

I made this recipe using stewed rhubarb instead of pumpkin, as I had a bunch I needed to use up. They turned out great! My kids all loved them. I sprinkled a wee bit of sugar on the top before baking to add that crunch they all like.

This seems like a very versatile recipe!  After reading some of the reviews I subbed in a cup of oats for a cup of flour and only used 1 1/2 cups sugar.  I didn't have any cloves or allspice on hand so I just excluded those and used canned pumpkin instead of fresh.  Even after all those changes they came out WONDERFULLY.  Next time I think I'll sprinkle the tops with a bit of raw sugar before baking for a nice looking top.  I also think nuts or raisins would be perfect in these.

PERFECT! I don't like the muffins too "spicey" so I used less cloves and cinnamon then what the recipe called for. The muffins are better after storing them in a ziplock bag overnight. Thank you for this amazing recipe.

Since I'm allergic to gluten I tried this recipe with plain white rice flour and they came out perfectly dense and delicious. I took the suggestions in the comments of halving the spices besides the cinnamon and.added a gluten free oat struesel topping (needed to add 5 more min to bake time for the topping to crisp nicely). I've tried a few pumpkin muffin recipes with rice flour and this one is the most delicious. This recipe is very representative of what you would find in a coffee shop muffin or loaf cake, as I saw in the comments below.

I seldom, seldom comment on recipes, but I feel compelled to say this was scrumptious. I also used a can of pumpkin puree and subbed whole wheat flour for the AP, and the muffins were unbelievable, so much better than the apple pumpkin muffins on this site. Also halved the sugar and the salt. This was just what I was looking for, a muffin that doesnt have the texture of dense pumpkin bread. Thanks a million!

The spices over powers the pumpkin, so next time I use this recipes I will use 1/2 teaspoon of clove and allspice.  Other than that, they were delicious.  Its made 24 nice size muffins after I added nuts and raisins.

My family loved them.  I made cupcake sized and mini-muffins.  I used a puree I made from a medium sized Halloween pumpkin. I cooked the cut up pumpkin in a crock pot and then peeled and pureed it. I thought my puree was a little watery so I only used a half cup of oil. That seemed to work fine.


The muffins seem a little spicy. Next time I will reduce the cloves and nutmeg So I get more pumpkin flavor.

Tastes more like a spice cake then pumpkin.  If you like a stronger pumpkin flavour then don't use this recipe as it loses its pumpkin flavour due to the amount of spices.  Won't use this one again, its ok.

Doubled the receipe and got 48 muffins. Besides for the cinnamon, I cut down the spices to about half what it called for, and used half the sugar. Taste fantastic! If anyone is curious, I calculated it out to 154 calories/muffin (with only half the sugar) or 178 calories/muffin with all the sugar.

We grew pumpkins this year (two plants, 29 pumpkins) so it is time to bake!  I made this recipe as written which is why I am reviewing it.  The whole family loved it.  Why 5 stars?  My husband who generally only likes pumpkin prepared in the curry pumpkin soup recipe I use, just loved these.  Why? Likely the "spiciness".  The recipe made 24 muffins, 12 of which I dusted with powered sugar for looks since they will be going to neighbors.

I made this recipe as directed, except I cut the servings down to 8 since I only had two eggs on hand.  Even with cutting down the recipe it still made 10 fairly large muffins.  The muffins were moist and had a spice cake flavor that my family loves.  I especially liked that it did not taste like pumpkin pie.  Thank you Julie for a wonderful recipe that even my picky eaters like!

Ok, so I baked these today and I have to say that the batter was dry, however, I added extra puree (yes, I cheated and used the canned version) and I substituted 1 cup of sugar for 1 cup of brown sugar and it was a hit! I think next time I will also add a bit of condensed milk and see if that helps moisten the batter. I also don't let it cook the full time, I find that they are softer when you take them out of the oven a bit short of the cooking time and let them sit.

I doubled the recipe and used jumbo muffin tins, a double recipe made about 18 muffins and baked at about 40 minutes.  I also added raisins and was generous with the spice.  Oh my, these were decadent, spicy and sweet.

Very good.  Took some liberties with the recipe.... cut the recipe in half, only used 1/2 cup of sugar, some whole wheat flour, in place of the half an egg, I added a bit of yogurt and some milled flax seed.  I also didn't have enough pumpkin, so I rounded out the quantity wih mashed banana.  Added chcocolate chips too. Got 13 muffins.

This recipe is great. I substituted demerara sugar for the white sugar, used one 15 oz can of pumpkin instead of the fresh, and added a teaspoon of ginger to the mix of spices. Fabulous!!

I made these gluten free, with 3 cups of all-purpose gluten free flour and 1/2 tsp of xanthan gum replacing the 3 cups of all-purpose wheat flour. Also used 2 cups of canned pumpkin puree. They are amazing!

I really liked it and it is kid-kitchen friendly. My daughter (8) helped me bake and eat them ;)
We also added fresh ginger. I squeezed it through a garlic press...ahh, delicious.

I baked my Halloween pumpkin for the first time this year and was looking for ways to use up the puree.  These muffins turned out great.  I didn't have cloves and allspice, so I used 2 tsp. cinnamon, 2 tsp. nutmeg, and 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  Next time I will try the healthy substitutions others have suggested since I feel a little guilty about all the sugar.  As others have noted this makes more that stated.  I generously filled 12 muffin cups and had a little left over for one or two more.

Made these in mini-muffins (baked for 15 minutes in my oven which runs cool) and my 5 year old said they were the best muffins she'd ever had, and she doesn't usually liked muffins. Great texture and flavor. I thought that maybe the spices would overpower it, but it was great.

Loved the recipe. Cut the cloves measurement in half (am not too fond of Cloves).  I left them on the table Thanksgiving day they were gone by that evening. I am going to try pumpkin bread next with fresh pumpkin!

I liked these muffins a lot. I did make some changes though: two cups of sugar seemed a little excessive to me, so I reduced it to 1/2 cup demerara sugar. I used 2 1/2 cups of canned pumpkin. I used 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. allspice, 1 tsp. cardamom, aprox. 2 tsp. grated fresh ginger, and approx. 1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg; I very seldom follow a receips spice directions, as I know what my family and I prefer. I also added about 3/4 cup of raw pumpkin seeds. My daughter and her friend are eating them right now and love them! Next time I make them I would like to substitute the white flour for some spelt and/or whole wheat. This receip also yeilded 18 muffins.

Made with kids this morning and it worked out great.  Following the comments, I reduced the cloves etc - the quantities shown do look like way too much.  I kept the full amount of cinnamon, but used only 1/4 tsp of cloves and 1/4 of nutmeg (no allspice here).  A bit of ginger would probably be nice as well.  Used 2 cups of frozen homemade pumpkin, thawed in advance.  Baked in muffin tins - perfectly done in 20 minutes!

Good muffins.  I used 2 cups canned pumpkin.  Also substituted about 1/2 c oil with apple sauce and made up the remaining 2/3 c with olive oil.  I used spices as in recipe and would keep that the same.  If you don't like cloves, maybe could drop to 1 t.  But otherwise not sure why others dropped the spices.  I also added some dark chocolate chips which was tasty.  Could definitely add nuts if you like that.  I got 16 muffins total.

I used half the cloves and nutmeg and added a quarter tsp ginger, used 1 cup brown sugar lightly packed, and omitted oil and used 1 cup applesauce, and went for two cups flour one cup oats. 
The seasoning was awesome, the consistency was great, but as someone who doesn't like sweets, these are still not sweet enough. I think I'd try again with white sugar and more of it. It really just tastes like spicy bread. 
I really can't imagine these with more cloves- such an intense flavor, I think it would overpower all other flavors.

I wasn't sure about this but it turned out beautifully!  The muffins were really light and fluffy.  Recipe made about 22 muffins.
Pumpkin cooked in the hot oven in less than one hour.  I used mixed spice not allspice and added a pinch of ginger.  Lovely!

I tried this recipe and my first thought was that there was way too much cloves and nutmeg. I reduced the amounts before the first batch and they were very tasty. I also changed the oil to unsweetened applesauce. They are plenty moist and fluffy. I will use this recipe again with those changes.
Also, I stuffed the middle with cream cheese,hmmm! 4 oz. Cream cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp. Cinnamon. Spoon half amount of batter into the baking cups, add one tsp. Of cream cheese mixture, and spoon more batter on top. Add a minute or two to your baking time. Yummo!

Yummy! Lovely & moist. I didn't have the cloves or the nutmeg so I upped the cinnamon & allspice. I also topped with Quaker Harvest Crunch granola. I think next time I might add cranberries and either walnuts or sunflower seeds. I will be adding these to my regular muffin roster.

Note: These made 18 medium sized muffins for me. And I cooked for 23 minutes.

I loved these finely textured muffins.  I divided the recipe in half (still used 2 eggs) and got 9 nice "tea size" muffins.  I used canned pumpkin (1 cup)  as I am always in a hurry - and they were delish.  Put a dab of cream cheese icing on the few remaining muffins the next day and that was a nice addition.  Almost like a light pumpkin loaf.  I went a little light on the cloves for fear of overpowering the pumpkin flavour. Will make these again next week!

Love these!  They are perfectly spiced.  As per another suggestion I used 2 cups W/w flour, 1 cup oatmeal, omitted the oil and used 1 cup homemade applesauce, cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and used 2 eggs and 1 tsp BP.  Will make these again and again!  Tip:  Roast your pumpkin whole and then cut in half and scoop out seeds and strings.  Much easier.

Made the recipe as written except for using canned pumpkin. I used 2 1/2 cups of the canned pumpkin puree. The spices are good, but I think next time I will cut the cloves and allspice by 1/2. It made exactly 24 regular muffins. They are delicious and so moist!!! The second batch I made I added raisins to it. I did make a topping for the muffins and put it on them right before I put them into the oven. (1C flour, 1C instant oats, 1C brown sugar, 1/4tsp baking powder, 1/4tsp baking soda, 1/2tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 cup melted butter. Mix until it's crumbly and put onto unbaked muffins..) These are so good and the house smells amazing! Definitely feels like Autumn now

I followed this recipe exactly the first time a made it. It made 16 large muffins. The spice was perfect for me, and I don't really like the flavor of cloves. It is not an overly sweet muffin, so its a nice treat to have with tea. I give it 5 stars based on the exact recipe as written with no substitutions.

I have now made this recipe 4 times. I have tweaked it to suit my liking each time. It is very versatile. Even with a few experimental substitutes, I haven't had a failed batch yet. I doubled the recipe in my standmixer, and swapped out 1/3 flour for bran. Still Great! I subbed brown sugar for white. Steel GOOOOOOOD! I whipped up a batch of Cream cheese icing and "stuffed" my muffins. I poked a hole in them when they were still warm and piped my icing in the hole. WOWSERS!!!! 

Do what you want with this recipe, it will not disappoint!

This recipe did not make 12 muffins. Unfortunately, I followed the recipe exactly, despite the initial disbelief. I don't even know where to start with these. First of all the timing is wrong, mine needed about 6 more minutes - and then the edges were getting a bit too brown so I took them out. This led to a couple of the middle muffins, collapsing since the middle wasn't completely done. Taste-wise, WAY TOO MUCH SPICE. Seriously, can't taste the pumpkin at all. Also, incredibly oily. I dont care too much about ingredients, health-wise, but these were way too oily. major disappointment all around really.

We cannot obtain canned pumpkin here and I only had half the fresh pumpkin the recipe called for so I halved all the ingredients except used 1 egg plus 1/3 cup plain yogurt (and I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour with 1 cup regular all-purpose flour instead of 1.5 cups all purpose flour) and they still turned out nicely. This is a good basic recipe that smells delicious, looks attractive and tastes good. I will make these again.

Verry yummy!  A little strong on the spice side, but that can be adjusted to taste easily .  The muffin is very good at holding it's shape and not falling in the middle.  Wonderful texture.   I used canned puree and sprinkled turbinado sugar on top for a pretty finish like in the photo.  I also substituted melted butter for the oil, a must for baking.  My kids ages 1-5 love them!

Made my kitchen smell like a fragrant dream of autumn. I topped the muffins with a swirl of cream cheese frosting and some orange sprinkles to turn them into eye candy for a bake sale fundraiser. Let's hope it works!

I made these mini size, used whole wheat flour, canned pumpkin. Did anyone else think they were a little on the dry side? Maybe it's just me, I also cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups.

I used a 15 oz. can of pumpkin, and threw in a handful of plumped currants -- these muffins were delicious! Lots of batter, though -- it actually made 24 normal-size muffins.

These are AMAZING! I didn't have any cloves or allspice, but were still delicious, though I am sure they would be better with. I also added about 1 tsp. of vanilla, and just used canned pumpkin instead. It measured to be closer to 3 cups instead of 2, but I think that helped keep the muffins so moist! I was able to make 19 muffins and a loaf from the recipe!

I made these in the summer so I used canned pumpkin puree. We already had a 29oz container so I doubled the recipe and it made 3 dozen muffins. Other than the puree I followed the directions exactly and they were amazing! My 2 year old devoured his!

I've been making a healthed up version of these muffins for years, but I stumbled on a winner version today when I discovered I was missing some ingredients halfway through: 2 cups wheat 1 cup white flour, 2 mashed bananas (approx 3/4 cup), 3 tbsp coconut oil, 2 eggs, 2/3 cup sugar, and the rest of the dry ingredients stay the same. Makes them more of a pumpkin banana muffin, yum!!

Absolutely the best muffins - light and fluffy full of flavour.  I used a medium sized regular pumpkin for the puree and it turned out perfectly.  It made about 8 cups of puree so I am preserving the rest so I can have them thru the winter too!

SO YUMMY. i made these with my lovely mother and we had a blast. we used almost 16oz of the canned pumpkin and left in everything else, spices and all and they came out fantastic. we had to keep them in a little longer then 22 mins but we blame that on our oven haha. anyways amazing with tea, a little butter and a family member or friend! for us, we were able to make 20 muffins on cupcake pans with liners! using it again!!

I LOVE pumpkin but I thought the spice in this recipe was a little too much.  It overpowers the pumpkin flavor.

Very good recipe! We had leftover buttercup squash from dinner so I used that instead of pumpkin and they were wonderful.  I too used part oatmeal to make them healthier.  YUM!

These are so surprisingly delicious!! Finally, bakery quality muffins!  I made a few small changes to sneak in some fiber because I'm pregnant and for my husband.  I followed the directions but used canned pumpkin and replaced 1/2 cup flour with 1/3 cup of oat flour (that I made from whole oats in the food processor) so I put that in the measuring cup to 1/3 cup and then I continued filling the measuring cup with flax seed meal to the 1/2 cup mark.  When I mixed the pumpkin, oil, and egg mixture, I didn't beat it, I just mixed well.  Then I added walnuts and golden raisins.  The last change I made was to add the streusel topping (doubled the recipe) from the Pumpkin-Apple Muffins with Streusel Topping recipe by Carolyn.  I filled the muffin pan completely and totally covered each muffin with struesel (what I used to do when I used to bake muffins at a bakery).   These were DIVINE!!!  Definitely coffeehouse/bakery quality!!  With the walnuts and raisins, they taste almost exactly like Whole Foods pumpkin muffins in the bakery section that are always gone by the time I get there and want to buy my muffin...now I don't have to go anywhere!  I'm going to make a couple batches of these to freeze and take with me to work as my pregnancy progresses and experiment with less sugar and some other modifications that other reviewers posted for health reasons only.  They're really perfect as I made them.  Thanks for this recipe, Julie!!

Excellent muffins!  I call them pumpkin spice muffins because they have a bite but we all like that.  I doubled the recipe then realized I didn't have enough pumpkin- woops!  I added mashed banana to make up the difference (about 1/4 the total) and they were still delicious.  I think this is going to replace my old pumpkin bread/muffin recipe and I didn't think that could be done.  Thanks!

These are so good. This is my new favorite muffin recipe. I didn't use any all spice, and they still turned out very yummy. We ate them hot out of the oven with butter, mmmmmmmm!! The recipe says 12 muffins, but I got 18 (regular size muffins). I will be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made these gluten free!!!! Although, I made these muffins with a lot of changes, I mainly followed the recipe as a guideline! If you can bake, you can alter these and have them come out fantastic! I didn't have fresh pumpkin so I used a can of pure pumpkin, and didn't have quite two cups so I subbed in applesauce. I subbed the white sugar for organic raw sugar and cut down on that by about 2/3 of a cup and increased with MORE applesauce. I wasn't done there with the applesauce, I also replaced the oil with applesauce!!! I used all the spices so you could get more "autumn" flavour. I wanted to make them hearty so in my gluten free flour blend I also used ground pumpkin seeds, ground flax seeds and ground oats. I used 1/4 cup un-ground rolled oats as well. This recipe does make 24, not 12. I made 12 without a topping and 12 with a topping. The topping was AMAZING and turned the muffins into more of a dessert than a snack. I made the topping with rolled oats, walnut pieces, demarara sugar and coconut oil. I wanted to keep this recipe dairy free so I didn't use chunks of butter like you normally would in a crumble type topping. I got the most rave reviews out of any other muffin I've ever made!! People that don't eat gluten free, dairy free, said they were hands down, the BEST muffin they've EVER HAD!!!

Great muffin recipe. I followed exactly as I have Crohn's and cannot eat anything other than white flour.  I made these a second/third time and substituted 2 cups of applesauce for the pumpkin.  Delicious, moist and gone fast!  Thanks for the great receipe.

YUMMY!!  I used 2 1/2 cups of pureed pumpkin because I had it on hand and didn't want it to go to waste.  Very moist and delicious - I got 27 standard muffins and used the streusal topping suggested by another user!  A KEEPER!

I've been using this recipe for a few years now! I absolutely love it. I use whole wheat flour and the healthier alternatives sometimes. Other times, I add a cup of chocolate chips to the batter. (It really depends on if I'm giving them to others or eating them at home. )

These were perfect. I did half all of the spices, however, except the cinnamon after considering other reviews. I like a muffin a little more subtle with the spice, so you can taste the pumpkin. These stayed moist and scrumptious all day. It's a 5 star after the spice adjustment.

These are so good. I made them two days in a row. I made some plain and some with chocolate chips. This recipe goes into the permanent repetoire.

I like this recipe because I love to cook from scratch. I used half the sugar and half the nutmeg, left out the oil and used 1/3 cup butter instead, and left out the allspice (just 'cause I didn't have any).  I also threw in about 1/2 a cup of applesauce. They were delicious, and so soft!

Had to modify due to allergies (dairy, eggs, & nuts) but these still turned out great!  I used 1/3 C. homemade cinnamon applesauce per egg.  I used EVOO also instead of veg. oil.  These were a big hit in our house as they are very moist!  I know what I plan to make with the rest of our pumpkin puree.

Very, very good! I made this with a leftover Halloween pumpkin that we roasted about a week or so ago. I was a bit worried that the flavor wouldn't be quite right, since it wasn't a cooking pumpkin, but I made the recipe as is, and the muffins were delicious--I wouldn't change a thing! It was, I must say, quite draining on my muffin-making resources, since there was so much dough and not a lot of muffin tins around. But that's good--means lots more muffins for me!

These were very yummy!  I used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 reg AP flour and cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups.  They were moist & loved by all.

WOW!  Great recipe!  My 9 yr old son made these from a pumpkins he grew.  He used butter instead of veggie oil.  I went out and bought extra pie pumpkins to cook up and freeze so we can enjoy this recipe all winter long!  THANKS!

I like this recipe. I didn't have allspice so I used about 1/2 a teaspoon of ginger instead. Next time, I'll cut the ground cloves to about 1 teaspoon as it is a bit overwhelming once they bake. Also, the recipe yields closer to 18 muffins. I do like the recipe a lot though. My husband is enjoying them for breakfast this week - they're very filling!

Good recipe! It makes 12 VERY big muffins. I cut the sugar in half, 2 cups made it much too sweet. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also used 1/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce in place of the 2/3 cup oil.

Very good recipe.  I halved the sugar and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Also, halved the nutmeg, but kept the rest of the spices original to recipe.  I probably cold have halved the cloves as well.  I used 2 cups all purpose flour and one cup rolled oats (old fashioned).  I also used 15 oz. can of pumpkin.  They turned out great and my 3 year old and 1 year old love it!

These muffins came out perfectly. They smell amazing, and taste even better. Great consistency, and they look great too! I glazed myn with a really simple Vanilla Glaze.

This is a great recipe, moist and delicious.  Makes at least 24 regular size muffins and works well with left over squash instead of pumpkin, too.  I didn't use quite as much clove as called for, thought it would be too overpowering, so I just used 1/2 a teaspoon otherwise I followed the recipe. Very Good.

Like others, I used whole wheat flour (actually I blend my own own wheat with whole white).  Added some extra spice, cut down on the sugar by 1/2 cup, sprinkled with raw pumpkin seeds and used fresh pureed kabocha pumpkin.  Very good.

I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup rolled oat combo for the flour.  I used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 splenda brown sugar blend for the sugar.  I also added 3 T of flax seed.  Used olive oil for the oil.  SOOO good!  I also cheated and used canned pumpkin.

I followed the advice of other people using applesauce, whole wheat flour and rolled oats. They are great. My husband is very simple when it comes to the foods he will eat, and I wasn't sure about how the substitutions would sit with him. He loves them. Thanks!

I modified these slightly, using whole wheat flour and applesauce instead of oil, and I cut the cloves to 1 tsp, but they were great - very moist and delicious. I found the cooking time to be 25-30 minutes and the recipe made 18 muffins, not 12.

These are excellent! Even my 5 year old loves them. I took some of the reviewers suggestions and made the following changes. I cut the sugar in 1/2 and  blended 1 cup whole wheat, 1 cup white and 1 cup oats for the flour mix. I substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce and used 2 cans of pureed pumpkin. I also added raisins to half. I might add walnuts next time and I may try some of the crumble on top that people have suggested. These are going to become a regular in my house; moist and flavorful.

Hint: Mix a little sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon in a bowl and dust the top of the muffins before you put them in the oven! Fantastic recipe! These muffins were nice and moist. We made them on tour and our groupies loved them.

I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 cup quick oats and 1/2 cup oat bran in place of the 3 cups all purpose flour. I also used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar and omitted the 1 tsp all spice for about 1/2 tsp. ginger. VERY good! A new favorite at our house!

Great muffins, but didn't have enough of a pumpkin flavor for me.  I used fresh pumpkin puree, not canned.

I cut down the amount of clove and nutmeg but the muffins were still a bit strong.  I think I will reduce those 2 ingredients even more the next time.  Still a good muffin!

These are awesome muffins.  I doubled the batch both times and instead of 4 c sugar I used 2 c sugar and 1 1/2 c honey.  Yum.  In addition I added a little rolled oats and turbinado sugar to the top.  This recipe will be used for years to come!

By far the best muffin's I have ever tasted! I changed a few things like others previously have. I used applesauce in place of the oil and cut all spice in half except for the cinnamon. I could not stop eating these especially hot and fresh out of the oven!!

Wow! These were phenomenal!!!  The only spices I had were cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. I didn't measure, just kinda threw in what I thought would work. I also substituted half wheat flour, and applesauce for the oil (although it was a bit dry and I needed to add some oil at the end).  Rave reviews from family and friends, I made a double batch and they were gone in a day! Fun to play with, easy to make (I used canned pumpkin), and pretty healthy (I also cut the sugar down to about 2/3 what the recipe called for). Great to freeze for winter breakfasts.

My husband loves all things pumpkin-flavored, but said the nutmeg and cinnamon overpowered the pumpkin in these. Next time I'll up the pumpkin and cut back on the spices. That said, these were still good, homey muffins.

I used the canned pumpkin mix that had all the spices, I also added the spices that it called for. Was worried it would turn out too spicy, but they were delicious.. My 2 yr old granddaughter loved them and so did her nursery class... Thanks for sharing the recipe....

I halved the spices and used canned pumpkin. Plenty of flavor and aroma. Enjoyed by all - most by our five year old. The recipe makes about 2 dozen muffins, not one as indicated.

These muffins are amazing! I used leftover canned pumpkin and underbaked by a few minutes to keep them nice and moist. I'll definitely be using these during the holidays. Note: I cut the recipe to a third (for just me and my husband), and it still made 8 reguar-size muffins. My mom made the original yield and got 24.

These were great! I used some uncarved halloween pumpkins and put them in a casserole dish with a little bit of water in the bottom and covered with foil. The skin rubbed right off after about an hour of baking. I made some substitutions to make it a little healthier as other reviewers did. Sub have of the veggie oil for applesauce as well as used two cups wheat flour and one cup regular. I found a splenda/sugar mix at the store which directed me to use half the amount asked for and they turned out perfectly! While they were good on their own I took the advice of another reviewer and made an oatmeal streusel for the top. Great recipe and fun to make!

These were very tasty. The only things i changed was the allspice, I didnt have any so omited and I added a cinnamon, sugar and butter mix to the top for a little extra sweetness after they were out of the oven. Very good, will be making these again for sure!

VERY TASTY!  I loved the taste of this muffin. It has many nutrients and it is very filling. I doubled the recipe (but you would still only need one pumpkin), I also added applesauce to make it more dense, I used whole wheat flour and sliced pieces of bananas into half of the muffins. I LOVED the added moisture and sweetness of the bananas. I had enough to make a small cake which I will crumple into vanilla pudding for my 22 month old daughter (she also loved the muffin).

I made these the first time following the recipe exactly and they were awesome. The second time was out of pumpkin season (and I couldn't even find canned pumpkin!) so I substituted two sweet potatoes for the pumpkin. I also ran out of oil, so I used butter (2/3 cup) instead. Having tasted them, they could have used a smidge more butter (maybe a tablespoon) but they worked out great!

I love this recipe!  An orange glaze gives it just a touch of sweetness! 1 cup confectioners sugar, 4 teaspoons orange juice, 3/4 teaspoon orange zest.   As a loaf bake for about an hour.

As far as taste goes, this recipe deserves five stars. However, I am giving it four because the "servings yielded" is quite misleading! I made these this morning for my fiancee and I for breakfast and wanted to make soem extra for his lunches this week, so I doubled the recipe, anticipating 24 muffins. Was I suprised! Doubling the recipe made 36 "normal" muffins AND 36 mini muffins.

I was looking for something different for snack for my daughter's preschool class so I made these. I substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour and used canned pumpkin and they were fantastic! The kids ate all of them and even my 1 yr old loves them! This will definately become a staple in our home.

These were really good.  Everyone at work seemed to like them and said they were surprised by the spice in them.  I used canned pumpkin and i didnt have the cloves so i left them out.  I also added some brown sugar mixed with a tablespoon of butter and some flour to sprinkle on top as a crumb topping

Good recipe, very nice texture and flavour. The only change I will make next time is the amount of sugar - two cups of white is way too sweet. One cup of brown sugar instead, should be fine, and add another 1/2 cup of puree to replace the volume. Otherwise very tasty!

Very good muffins - I made it with canned pumpkin and some leftover butternut squash.  I also used 1/3 c. oil and 1/3 c. applesauce rather than the full amount of oil.  I substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour and used white flour for the rest.  I only used 1 c. sugar - 2 is much to much.  They were delicious but a little dense from the whole wheat flour but it was worth it.

These smelled just like Fall!  Mine were a little gummy, but that may have been because I subbed all the oil for applesauce.  I used 15oz can of pumpkin, just under 2 cups of sugar and I upped the nutmeg and allspice (didn't have any ground cloves on hand).  One batch made 12 regular sized muffins (baked for 16 min) and 5 jumbo muffins (baked for 28 min).

I made them twice with my eight year old daughter and they were VERY very good. Second time I added 1/3 cup of melted butter and did half brown and half white sugar to enhance the autumn pumpkin flavour. Everything else as written. Delicious.

This was a GREAT recipe! I also cut a bit of the sugar, and tried it with white and whole wheat flour, and half and half. It is a versatile recipe that my family loves, and it will be a repeat recipe to be used on a regular basis! I am going to try freezing some with the batch I made today to see how they fare being frozen! Thanks for sharing!!

Very good muffins. I tweaked them of course...  I used melted butter, not oil. I make my own pumpkin  pie spice at home, and it has ginger in it. Used 2 1/2 cups pumpkin, and 1/2 cup whole milk.   Set aside 1/4 of batter, and mixed it with 1 egg, 1 package softened cream cheese, and 1/3 cup raw sugar. blended until smooth. next I topped each muffin with a spoonful of the cream cheese goodness before baking.  they came out super moist and the pumpkin cream cheese was a built in topping! yum yum.

These were really, really tasty.  I had to grind my own cloves and nutmeg, and contribute much of the flavor to the fresh spices.  I used a 15 oz can of pumpkin puree since it's July and no pumpkins to be found in this town right now.  I ended up with about 15 good size muffins that rose beautifully.

I love using these spices in all my baking, so I absolutely love this recipe.  I would suggest that the sugar used be half of the recipe before starting. To take mine up a notch I added 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 heaping tablespoon of peanut butter.  Yummy!!!!

I doubled the recipe, replaced 1/4 of the sugar with brown sugar, and used ginger instead of allspice because I didnt have any... I used home made pumpkin puree I made a couple of weeks ago... It made about 50% more muffins than I had expected and I filled the cups to the brim... They turned out amazing!

I just made these and they turned out great.  Instead of roasting the pumpkin, I steamed it in the microwave for 20 minutes and then pureed it with a submersion mixer.  The flavor turned out great.  Other than the pumpkin, I didn't change the recipe at all.

At first, these were a bit blah -- good texture but the spices didn't come out much.  The day after baking, however, these tasted much better.

I had left over pumkin puree from making a scratch pumkin pie and I used this recipe. It came out great. I like brown sugar so I followed others advice and did 1 cup sugar 1 cup brown sugar. I also do not like oil in recipes (it usually doesn't work for baking)so i used softened butter instead of oil.But as far as muffin recipes go this is the best one i've seen in years thank you!

Made these muffins as written.  I was concerned that the amount of flour and sugar would make them dense and sweet, but I am delighted with how they turned out.  I might even add a bit more cloves next time for an extra 'oomph'.  Nice and moist, this recipe made 24 standard muffins.

Excellent! I used half wheat flour, and half white flour. half brown sugar, and half white sugar.  I substituted apple sauce for oil as others recommended, but then I chickened out and put about two table spoons of oil and the rest apple sauce. I halved the cloves because I'm not a huge fan of the flavor as per recommendation below. I think it would be fine w/ the entire qty because I don't taste the cloves heavily. Next time I may add a little more cinnamon because I

These turned out excellent.  They made 16 and were moist right to the last one, about a week old.  I only used half the amount of cloves because I was afraid it would be too strong, but I think I would use the correct amount next time.

Good idea but this recipe lacks butter. Way overkill on spice. My tongue is numb from the nutmeg. I would use butter instead of oil and these are for sure made for frosting. The recipe also makes more than 12 large muffins.

My new favorite muffins! I had 1 1/2 cup of pumpkin so instead of being short, I halved the other ingredients (using only 1 egg), and added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I made 9 large muffins and they were perfect (baked about 30-33 minutes).  I also used a regular ol' jack-o-lantern instead of a sugar pumpkin. Delicious!

These muffins are absolutely delicious!!! I've never been good at  following directions, so I mixed everything together in 1 bowl with no problems. I used canned pumpkin and whole wheat flour. I was able to make a dozen big muffins. These were a big hit with everyone I shared them with. To sum it up in one word, YUM!

These were tasty muffins even while using canned pumpkin in place of the baked.  It seemed to call for quite a bit of sugar, so I omitted 1/2 cup knowing I would pair it with "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" later.  Next time I will only use 1tsp of each spice as the original recipe was a bit excessive and over-powering with flavor, it seemed to mask the pumpkin taste.

I used canned pumpkin and since I didn't have cloves, nutmeg or allspice- I used pumpkin pie spice (1 tsp). These muffins were a hit! I will definitely use this recipe again. I was told they looked as though they came from a bakery! Tastes great AND looks good- what more can you ask?!

My husband says these are the best things I've ever baked! They were awesome. Just to note, I halved the recipe and used 2 eggs instead of 1 (or 1.5 :)). They were really moist that way, and somehow still made 12 muffins!

These were unbelievable!  I made two changes - used canned pumpkin and left out the allspice as I didn't have any.  The flavor was wonderful, not at all bland like other pumpkin muffin recipes I've tried.  Our new favorite!

These were wonderful!! I didn't have any clove, or all spice. I just used cinnamon, and nutmeg and they were wonderful. I might just use the cinnamon alone that's how great this was. I also used canned pumpkin. * This recipe made more than 12 muffins for me. A KEEPER! 4yr old loved it.

These were great!!! I used pure pumpkin puree because I had some that needed to be used up. I also omitted the clove all together increased the allspice by 1/2tsp (because I had no nutmeg on hand)and added chopped pecans. My husband loved them. Will definately be making these again.

The second time i made these, they were delicious... the first time i used whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil, and only half the sugar as the recipe called for (but i added dark chocolate chunks), and they were very good. the second time i did everything the same, but used the full amount of sugar. i have to say, healthiness and tastiness have to find a balance! whole wheat flour and applesauce amped up the health of this recipe, but use the full amount (or almost full amount) of sugar if you want these to be really delicious! and i always want to add dark chocolate... but even without these still would be great!

I just now made these and I'm a little disappointed. They weren't as moist as I thought they would be with the oil and eggs.They're not DRY, just not moist. Hm. Oh well! The flavor is good, just not sure I'll bother making this specific recipe again.

Mine ended up with more of a spice cake flavor than pumpkin. I think by cutting all the spices in half like some other reviewers suggested would make them more pumpkin-y. I used a 15 oz. can of pumpkin instead of the fresh and it worked out perfectly.

These are very good muffins.  I would like them to be a bit lighter, not so dense, but overall the taste is very good.  My three girls can eat all 2 dozen in a day!

I made these tonight and the texture is perfect - just like you'd find at a coffee shop.  Thanks for a great starter recipe.  I tweaked the recipe a bit per other reviewers suggestions.  I used 1 6oz container fat free vanilla yogurt and 1/3 cup oil, 1 whole egg + 2 egg whites, 3/4 cup white sugar and and 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 tsp salt, and  2 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice.  Next time, I will increase salt to 1 tsp, increase the sugar by 1/4 cup, and use 3 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice.

Light and yummy. We used pumpkin pie spice 1 1/2 tsp and added butterscotch and chocolate chips. Kids ate them up and didn't even realize they were eating a relatative healthy muffin.

Wonderfully light and delicious!  I substituted half the sugar with honey, and added cinnamon chips.  They were a bit on the sweet side, but that was my fault with the cinnamon chips.  My kids loved them!

This was yummy! I used melted butter instead of the oil, and I omitted the allspice and halved the other spices (I used a heaping teaspoon cinnamon). The clove taste was still a little strong - I could've used a half teaspoon, I think. I also used 1 1/2 cups spelt flour and 1 1/2 cups white flour, and 1 cup Rappadura (unrefined sugar) instead of the sugar. If you like cafe style muffins (with tall, mounding tops!) then only use one 12 cup muffin pan and bake it for 20-25 minutes, as directed. If you like smaller muffins, then you could probably get 24 out of this recipe. This was delicious - I made it for a group of moms and children at a playdate at my home, and everyone loved it- especially the smell while it was baking! My 13 month old is eating another one right now!

I made these last night and they turned out moist and delicious. The only changes I made were no allspice and tsp of ginger.Next time I will frost them with cream cheese frosting. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Great recipe! I happen to run out of sugar, so I only put 1 cup instead of 2. And I added a cup of milk. It turned out great!

These were great!  I used canned pumpkin as it's a lot easier!  I also took the advise of others and used less spices, all I used was the nutmeg and cinnamon.  They came out great!

This was really good.  I added nuts and made them into mini muffins for the kids.  I thought it would be to many spices but I followed the recipe and they were great.

Very good muffin and will definately make again! I had a few small fresh pumpkins from the garden and I needed to do something with them after the kids painted faces on for Halloween. I prepared the pumpkin and used the recommended amount pureed and I made them lighter with 1/2 cup applesause and no oil and egg beaters in place of the 3 eggs.  Perfectly moist.  I didnt have all spice so threw a little ginger in but I dont think I will do that next time. Their great but I can taste the ginger a little too strong. A must try and my 2 year old ate them so believe me that says a lot!!!!

Excellent recipe. I used some of the "heart healthy" ideas mentioned in a previous comment and they were delicious. I also took cream cheese icing (store bought) and mixed in a generous amount of cinnamon and a little allspice to make a nice spiced icing for them. PERFECT right out of the oven with the icing a little drippy. :)

Tasty treat for the fall days!!  I used about 20 oz of canned pumpkin, kept the cinnamon the same and 1/2'd the other spices so we could mostly taste pumpkin and not just spices.  I also added about 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips.  Delicious and moist!! YUM!!!!!!!  Thanks!

based on some suggestions on modifying the recipe I will give these a 5.
I used hlaf unbleached flour and half whole wheat flour.  I also used half the amount of spices except for cinnamon and I never used all spice at all, I don't see the point.
I backed these in mini muffin tins and I got 48 mini muffins.  They took about 15 minutes to back.  The recipe is super easy, quick and they back up extremly well.  I was very happy with the results.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used my muffin top pan for this one.  Definate keeper.  I did change a few things like other reviews suggested.  2C. white flour/1c. whole wheat.  I reduced my sugar to 1 1/2 cups and instead of white sugar I used brown sugar.  I reduced the spices by half (as other reviews suggested) except for the cinnamon.  I think next time I won't reduce them though.  And the oil I reduced by half and used applesauce for the other half.  My whole family loves these muffin tops.

Very yummy! I followed what others said and I used canned pumpkin(2 cups) and also put some white and dark chocolate chips in half the batch. They were gone soo fast. This one is soo easy I will be doing this one more often.

These muffins had a good taste, but were very cakey - not what I consider a great dense muffin. I made some plain, with raisins and with chocolate chips.  I definnitely recommend adding raisins or chocolate chips because the plain ones were, well, plain.  I won't make these again.

Made these muffins with raw sugar instead of regular and sprinkled a bit of the raw sugar on top.  I also took one of the suggestions and made them a bit healthier with the applesauce instead of oil, whole wheat flour and rolled oats instead of regular flour, and only 2 eggs. Everyone loved them and said they were bakery quality!  I will definitely make these again.

Wonderful recipe...although I'll admit to making a few changes.  I went just a bit lighter on the sugar and oil.  I also replaced half of the regular flour with wheat flour and wheat germ for more texture and better nutrition.  I didn't have nutmeg so I used pumpkin pie spice instead. I also used canned pumpkin. I loved the well spiced taste.... very hearty breakfast or snack.

This was very tastey! I used canned pure pumpkin puree instead of a real pumpkin. I only had exactly one teaspoon of nutmeg instead of two, but I still made them and they turned out great! When I tried the dough, it tasted like it had too much spices in it, but when they were baked, they were not too spiceful at all. They made two dozen, not one dozen. Also, they went really well with egg nog; I wish stores had egg nog all year round, but they would probly go well with milk too.

My kids lovedthese muffins because they were sickenly sweet.
Overall:
- Too much oil and sugar (probably twice too much)
- So much spices that it does not taste like pumpkin
- Recipe too big for 12 muffins, too small for 24

I used pureed jack-o-lantern pumpkin and it still tasted great.  These were a hit with my kids.  Very good.  Moist.

These were very good--very moist and just all around yummy! I ran out of pumpkin pie spice, so added extra cinammon, but will have to make sure to have the right amount of spice enxt time (my fault-not the recipe's). My kids love them and so do I! Can't wait for dh to try one ;) I think walnuts or pecans and raisins would be a terrific addition to these!

This is one of the best muffins recipes I have ever found! Muffins stayed moist, light, and fluffy for days. I used canned pumpkin, ALL of the spices, and actually cut back the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cups. Half white sugar, half sucanat. I wanted muffins that could be a savory treat as well as good for breakfast. They were fabulous hot and spread with almond butter and a good companion to homemade butternut squash soup.

Not much for pumpkin or spice flavor, kind of bland.  Threw half of them away.

Easy recipe to make (I used canned pumpkin puree) and bakes super quick ... but, a bit too much on the "spice" side for me.  I'd like to be able to taste more of the sweet pumpkin flavor.

Followed recipe exactly except I used one 15 oz. can of pumpkin puree instead of fresh pumpkin.  Very easy and good result.  They smell great baking.

I used canned pumpkin and cut the spices (except the cinnamon) in half.  I am famous for making tough dry muffins but these were moist and flavorful.  This recipe is a keeper.

Yummy!  Kids loved them, which is a bonus.  I used a regular jack-o-lantern pumpkin instead, and it worked great.

These are amazing muffins. They're so full of flavor, I just eat them plain: no butter, no cream cheese. I used canned pumpkin puree and it worked great.

The best muffin recipe I have made!  Used one less egg because I had extra large eggs .  Put 1/3 cup of applesauce.  Used olive oil because that is all we cook with.  Took exactly 25 minutes to cook.  Also put a bit of cream cheese icing on top.  Excellent muffins!

Very tasty, and I love the fact that they are nutritious. My young kids like them too. I halved the recipe and used canned pumpkin (and 2 eggs). Based on the new numbers, I still used only a little more than half the amount of sugar called for. Instead of all the spices, I used close to 3 teaspoons of Pumpkin Pie Spice. Thanks for the recipe.

I wasn't so happy with this recipe. I used half the oil and sugar, which turned out fine. The flavor was ok, but tasted like it lacked something. I might make it again and change it around a bit.

This recipe was okay but not great. It makes a big batch; at least 2 dozen muffins that are dense and heavy. I advise cutting way back on the spices. I made it "as is" and the spices were overpowering. The muffins were also a bit too sweet for my taste. I agree with the other reviewers, you have to make major modifications to this recipe.

This makes a delicious muffin, and using fresh pumpkin makes it very moist.   
But as a personal taste, I will be cutting down the amount of cloves in future
batches.  It had just a bit too much for me, other than that, they were wonderful.

Very good exactly "as is". I can only imagine how delicious these would be with cream cheese frosting! I used canned pumpkin. Baking time was more like 30-35 min.
