This was pretty good...but it makes alot and gets old fast.  Unless you have a huge family, I recommend cutting the recipe in half.  Also, I used crushed cheez-its on top instead of crackers, which added some nice flavor and crunch!

Tasted like a thanksgiving type casserole. It was good though, and super easy to make. Just make sure to have enough time to cook it completely.

My family did not care for this dish. Just not for us I guess.

Good, but I made a couple of changes. I cooked the onions in advance in butter, and added a bit of milk  to the dish before  baking. I had fresh green beans on hand, so I used them. I also used the frozen corn. Everyone loved it. I will make it again. Quick, easy, and few ingredients.

This is one of our favorite holiday recipes. The only thing we changed is to add a can of chopped water chestnuts for a nice crunch and some cheddar cheese.

This dish was delicious! Very tasty, and everyone enjoyed it very much. The only change I made was I used frozen green beans and corn, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. I will definitely be making this again for the holidays (and on other other day as well!).
