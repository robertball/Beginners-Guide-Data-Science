Wow! Best brownie recipe ever! I followed the advice of some other users: Decreased the cocoa powder to 3/4C, decreased the sugar to 1 1/2C and increased the melted butter to 3/4C.  Also, to help with the mixing so it doesnt get crumbly, melt the butter really well and then add the sugar, vanilla and eggs.  In a seperate bowl mix the rest of the dry ingredients.  Now mix the two together. Mixing the indregients this way (rather than putting them all in a single bowl and mixing as the recipe says) will make the batter easier to mix and spread.

This is my favorite brownie recipe on the site. (I’ve made all of the top rated ones several times). It makes some wonderful, chewy brownies with a very powerful chocolaty flavor that I find most recipes lack. It doesn’t always turn out though. 

The brownie will be very thin no matter what size pan you’re using. Try putting wax paper on the bottom so that the brownie can be lifted out to cool and be cut. 
 
In order to avoid a crumbly mixture, stir the coca and sugar together, then add the melted butter and eggs and vanilla, and then the flour and salt.
Make sure that you melt the butter. If the mixture still seems too crumbly, it’s possible that your eggs were too small, (I use extra large size eggs) consider adding another egg. 
The mixture will be very thick.

I still have problems with the brownie not settling all the way and the middle square has to be discarded.  But I still prefer this recipe underdone to overdone. 

When they come out of the oven at the prescribed time, do not test the center for doneness, or try to cut them immediately. They will not seem done, but they will settle. (I like to put them in the fridge to settle.)  If you cook them to long they will be very dry.

My friend and I have tweaked this recipe to our liking: use three-fourths C cocoa, and add a quarter C vegetable oil (this will make the brownies moist and chewier, promise!).  I agree they are very sweet, so I think you could leave the full sugar in or decrease up to a half a cup.

After reading many reviews and making this recipe I can safely say that is one of those recipes that you either love or hate.  If you like the brownie mixes this is not for you.  I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful.  Not the usual kind of brownies that you might find on a bake sale.  These brownies are not cakey, they are thin, chewy, dense, moist, strong chocolate flavour (even with all the sugar the recipe calls for) and amazing with vanilla ice cream.  It is a dessert that you might find at five stars restaurants.  It deserves a fancy name!  If you love chocolate this is for you.  Don't over cook them!  I had to use my hands to level and spread the batter as it is really thick.  Turned out wonderful - wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!  This is my brownie recipe from now on.

Yummy!!! For a perfect top and chewy inside, use 1/2 cup of cocoa and 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and follow the rest of the recipe exactly.  I love the flaky top. It cracks beautifully with your fork and has a moist chewy inside. I have made this 4 times already. Absolutely delicious.

This is my new brownie recipe! We love chewy brownies and these are awesome. They are so easy I have made them three times already....a few tips - rather than trying to spread the dough which is more like a clay than batter, press it into your pan by hand, working from the middle out to the edges (a 10 inch round cake pan is perfect), the parchment paper is an unecessary step if you grease your pan (i've made them twice now without it - no problems). Lastly a little splash of milk (less than 1/4 cup) can help to make the dough more pliable - without changing the texture. Warning these are addictive!

THESE BROWNIES ARE GREAT, I'M EATING THEM AS I TYPE. READING THE REVIEWS BEFORE I MADE THIS RECIPE HELPED ALOT, BECAUSE OF THE OTHER REVIEWS I CUT DOWN ON THE SUGAR AND USED A SMALLER PAN TO BAKE THEM IN.  THEY CAME OUT REALLY GOOD AND CHEWY JUST THE WAY I LIKE BROWNIES ( I USED 1 AND 1/3 CUPS OF SUGAR BUT COULD HAVE USED 1 AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS GOOD) OH YEAH I ALMOST FORGOT I USED ONLY 1/2 CUP OF COCOA THEY CAME OUT TASTING JUST LIKE BROWNIES WITHOUT THE OVER POWERING FLAVOR OF COCOA.

My family and I did not enjoy this recipe very much at all. First of all I think there was way too much sugar and cocoa in it...that's all I could taste was the sugar.  I really like a fudgy brownie but this one just did not do it for me.  It took about 20mins longer to ensure it was baked, and even then we had to eat it with a spoon, just as another person mentioned.

I changed this recipe some, to not use butter but the shortening eq. I also melted this down and mixed the cocoa completely, then added the sugar, using 1/2c. at a time to taste the sweetness. These are too dense to be baked in a 8x8 pan... you should use 9x13 as stated. Parchment paper is also a must. I did not grease mine, mostly because it is parchment paper, you aren't supposed to, that's the idea. Please view the picture I posted that shows up close along with a measurement of 1/8". Yes, these are thin by height means. They are not spongy, like cake. They are very rich. If you are not looking for as described, do not make this, you won't be happy. I did bake at 300 for 33ish minutes. I always feel airpressure and altitude play a part in things not baking properly for some. I am not much above sea level, summer, barometric pressure is fair (not rainy or dry)... baked perfectly.

I like experimenting with brownie recipes and this one is for sure a keeper. I decrerased cocoa to 3/4 cup and sugar to 1 1/2 cup, increased butter to 3/4 cup. I softened the butter(Did NOT melt) and wisked that in a bowl with the cocoa so it looked like melted chocolate.Then wisked in the sugar,eggs and vanilla, Then stirred in the flour and salt. I do ALOT of baking and all the good brownie recipes usually get handmixed in that order. The only thing I would do different is bake in a square pan, They were awful thin. I like my brownies thick. Thanks for the good recipe!!!

These live up to their name - they're really chewy and not cake-like at all. I used extra dark cocoa for this recipe and the brownies came out BLACK because they were so rich. I needed to add about 2 or 3 tablespoons of milk to the batter because the egg and butter mix weren't enough to wet all the ingredients. I baked about 5 minutes longer than what was suggested, let them cool, and cut into them. Very good.

First of all if you completely change the recipe, you shouldnt rate things, thats not fair!!  Second- These were beyond wonderful!!!   I made these brownies Exactly how the recipe was written and loved every thing about them.  They look too dry when you put them in the pyrex, but dont worry about it-  they spread out and bake up evenly.  They are melt in your mouth delicious!

These are the best!!! My husband loves a chewy brownie and these were perfect. After reading the reviews, I did make a couple of changes. Cut sugar back to 1 1/2 cups and cocoa to 3/4 cup. Put in a 9in. round pan and baked at 325 for 30 min. My husband wants them all the time.Thank you for a great recipe!!

I agree that you either love or hate this recipe. After tweaking the recipe a bit, these were the best brownies I've ever had. I used three eggs instead of two, increased the butter to 3/4 C, and sprinkled coconut and bits of dark chocolate as a topping before I baked it. I also increased the baking time to 38 minutes. They were dense and fudge like and very, very rich. This is definitely a "company worthy" dessert.

These get a solid 4 stars, the results were worth 5 but that's after making some changes to the recipe.  Like many others I decreased the cocoa to 3/4 c. and the sugar to 1 1/2 c.  I also added a couple tablespoons of milk to make the batter easier to spread.  Used a 9x9 pan and ended up with brownies that were crisp on the top and amazingly fudgy under that crust.

I have made this recipie twice and love it. I eat wayyy more than my share. The first time I made as written and loved them. The second time I made them with Dutch Process Cocoa powder and I added two teaspoons of Roasted Milled Flax Seeds (which adds a little nutrition and a slight nutty flavor). They were even better. As hard as it is, I would say to let these COMPLETELY cool before eating. They are really good warm, but believe me, they are somehow even better cold.

I used the reviewers suggestions and decreased the cocoa and sugar. Also, I mixed the cocoa, butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla in one bowl and the flour and salt in another before adding it all together. The mixture was still hard to mix, so I added a little evaporated milk leftover from another recipe. I also baked it in a greased 8x8 pan at 300 for 20-25 minutes. The brownies still came out fudgy and tasted like dark chocolate, which was great.

As many others have, I modified this recipe and it is now a family favorite.  We make them at least once a week.  I reduced the cocoa to 1/2 cup, the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/4 cup oil and 1 cup pecans.  I bake the brownies in mini muffin tins for the recommended time and temp.  Spray the tins w/ cooking spray and make sure the brownies are completely cool before removing from pan to prevent sticking.

I've been hunting for a chewy brownie recipe for ages and this one is the best I've found! I did reduce the sugar to about 3/4 on the second attempt and the brownies were still great.
We have taken to cooking these in individual dishes and serving straight from the oven as a dessert - very moreish!

After reading the reviews I wanted to give these a try and see if I could come up with a great brownie.  I really think the directions are off on the temperature.  I set my oven at 350 and had really great results.  I used 3/4 cup of cocoa, 1/4 melted butter, 1/4 cup oil and 1 1/4 cup sugar and left everything else the same.  I did use an 8x8 pan and baked for 35 mins and they were delicious.  I did let these cool before cutting as they are very fudgy and would definetly be a mess if trying to cut them warm.  Use the oil and up the temp you will have some great brownies!

I've been searching for a CHEWY brownie recipe on this site and finally found it!  I mixed in chocolate chunks.  I took advice from others and baked in a smaller pan (8x8).  Increase cooking time to 45-50 mins.  Best the next day!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I made these brownies because I was bored one day.  I delivered some to my dad, sister and boyfriend three days after I made them and they have not stopped raving about how delicious they are. I plan to bring a fresh, hot batch to them tomorrow.  Who knows how they will react to those!! 

Also, this seriously makes the BEST brownie batter EVER. It was so good I was glad I tasted it after I put the pan in the oven.

This is the first brownie I've made from this site that my 5 y.o. liked and devoured. Husband liked too. From reading the other reviews, I went with a round cake pound, which made brownie thicker. Depth of chocolate reminds me of the Ghirardelli brownie mixes.

These brownies were just OK. The "batter" is more like a dough, and in an 8x8 pan it was barely 1/2" thick. But unlike a cookie dough, the 2c sugar and lack of liquid makes it kinda grainy even after cooking.  As I said, in an 8x8 pan these were very thin. 24 servings (as written) would be bite size! I'd say this makes no more than 10 modest size brownies. They are certainly tasty and chewy, but far from great brownies. I probably wouldn't try making these again...

I adjusted the cocoa powder to about 2/3 cup and added 2 squares melted semi-sweet chocolate. I also baked them in a smaller pan. These are intensely chocolate, not your everyday lunchbox brownies. I won't make these everytime I want to make brownies, but I will make them when I want a special dessert and serve with whipped cream or ice cream.

Made these brownies last night.  Was easy to make.  I did follow some of the listed modifications though.  I used 1/2 cup unsalted butter (on a sodium restricted diet), and 1/4 cup oil.  Also added some chocolate chips, and walnuts.
They were kind of thin for my taste, next time I will use the 9x9 pan instead of the 9x14; regardless....they were AWESOME!

These were "just ok".  As other reviewers have written, they are gummy, and collect on the knife, so you don't get a good clean cut.  By the 2nd day, they are rock hard, and nearly impossible to eat.  We will keep looking for a "favorite" brownie recipe.

If you LOVE chocolatey chewy brownies-these are the ones! NO cake stuff here! Minus 1/2 cup sugar and these ARE the perfect brownies.  For those whose were gritty, add sugar first to melted butter, stir well then add remaining ingredients.

We will not be making this recipe again. The cocoa was overpowering and the texture more gritty than chewy.  Not at all acceptable for a brownie recipe.

I've tried to make these brownies twice and had dismal results both times.  I'm not a pastry chef, but I consider myself an above average baker.  I followed the recipe both times with the only change being the baking vessel.  I used a 8x8 square pan just sprayed with cooking spray instead of a 13x9 glass dish.  I made this call because there did not look like there was enough of the batter to fill a 13x9.  Both times when I spread the batter in the pan and baked according to the instructions, by finished product retained the same pattern as the way I spread it out.  I baked for the 30 minutes at 300 degrees as instructed and still had uncooked batter in the center squares.  ( I let them cool for about 20 minutes before I cut them into 16 squares.) On my second attempt I even fired the oven back up and tried cooking them another 20 minutes and STILL had raw batter.  Like I said, I've tried this recipe twice and have not been satisfied with the end product either time.  Hope you have better luck than I did.  Bottom line: I would not recommend.

What did I do wrong? After so many good reviews, I had high hopes for these.I used an 8X8 pan, followed instructions implicitly.They turned out way too sweet, oily, and grainy. The top looked like a brownie, but the inside was very soft, greasy and mushy so I put them back in the oven and baked them for a total of 1 hour and they still didn't get done on the inside. Sorry Kristin!

The flavor of these brownies were good, but they were very grainy. They were not cakey, but they weren't especially chewy either. The "batter" (felt more like streusel) was very dry and crumbly, and while the brownies seemed to moisten and bind a bit while they baked, the final texture was very grainy. I was very disappointed. I guess my search for a moist, very chewy brownie is still on!

Even with the 1/4 cup of oil the batter was too thick to work with. They had a very heavy granulated suger taste to them. They tasted better the second day warmed a bit in the microwave. More like fudge than what you get in the commercial brownie boxes.

Yummy! Gooey and you NEED the parchment paper.  I baked 5 mins extra. Cooled 30 minutes before cutting.  Sprayed my knife with cooking spray before cutting.  SO RICH AND GOOD!!!  Oh and bake in an 8x8 pan -- they are thin .  Hubby said "They are like a Rambo movie with chocolate instead of blood"  Chocolate overload!!!

Very very good. My changes: 9x9 pan, bake at 325 for about 35 minutes, 1.5 cups sugar, splash of milk. I also added a couple dashes of Jim Beam. Why the whiskey? Why not? Very subtle added flavoring. Take out of the oven while the center is still 'gloopy.'

Rich, chewy brownies that I will make again! :) But...After reading the reviews, I made this recipe with the following changes: 
a) Used about 3-4 Tablespoons of bakers cocoa powder instead of a full cup
b) Used 1 C. sugar, and it was still plenty sweet(I also added 1/4 C. of Ghiradelli Chocolate Chips)
c) I substituted 4 T. of soymilk for the 2 eggs, and used Earth Balance in place of butter. (allergies)
d) Baked the mixture in mini muffin pans.

I've been wanting to try this recipe for a while, that it saddens me that I didn't love it!  I followed all the steps, the only change I made was that I used 1.5 cups of brown sugar.  The dough was impossible to work with and after 30 mins they were still kind of raw.  I had to cook them for 20 more minutes and leave them in the oven until they cooled off cause they still seemed uncooked.   I let them cool for 5 hours since it looked impossible to slice them, but I gave up and did what I could.  The "brownies" would stick to the knife and fall apart.  I basically had to scrape them off the greased pan and toss them in a plate (and then they would fall apart).  I wanted to serve this to people but I decided not to (good thing I also made jello!).  The taste is very good, that's why I gave it 2 stars, but the work and the cleanup is not worth it for me.  I don't think I will make these gooey brownies again :(.

These came out very good, chewy and moist, just right for a thin fudge-like brownie! I only gave it 4 stars because I did lower the amount of cocoa powder to 3/4 C and the sugar to 1 1/2 C. I mixed it in one bowl just fine. It is very thick to spread, but it worked out okay. I baked it in a glass pyrex 9X13 dish lined with aluminum foil at 300 for 45 minutes.

This is the perfect brownie recipe.  I am on a dairy free diet, and I substitute the butter with the same amount of soy butter and it's perfect for my chocolate fix!  Today I bought a boxed brownie mix and baked it.  I am throwing it out and making these instead, because the mix is just awful!! Nothing compares to these!

These were terrible.  I like chewy brownies, I like cakey brownies.  I just like brownies.  These were grainy, incredibly sweet and the chocolate flavor was lacking.  I'm going back to the Betty Crocker one from my Mom's 1960s era cookbook.

These were very rich and chewy indeed! Here were the changes I made based on others' suggestions: (1) Decreased the cocoa to 3/4 cup. They were still VERY chocolatey, so don't fear! (2) Added 1/4 cup melted vegetable shortening (or you could increase the melted butter to 3/4 cup total. (3) Decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups. Perfect! Want a sinful topping? Sprinkle the top of the brownies with semi-sweet chocolate chips as soon as you take them out of the oven. Wait two minutes, then use a spatula to spread the chocolate chips into a "frosting". Your brownies will now be affectionately known as Death By Chocolate Chewy Brownies, and your coworkers will beg you to bake a batch every week.

I took this recipe home and put it together in about 5 minutes for a quick and easy dessert.  I would probably bake them in a 8" or 9" pan next time instead of the 9x13".  Very tasty.

These are were so good.  After reading a few reviews I melted the butter and sugar (only used 1 cup of sugar and that was plenty) in the microwave until the sugar was dissolved.  Mixed all the dry ingredients first, made a well and stired in the eggs, then added butter/sugar in three goes.  The mix wasn't too difficult to stir-so maybe that helps (or I was lucky).  The best part of this recipe was eating it, the biggest bonus is hardly any washing up.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will make again and again

If you like dark chocolate you will love these. I also recommend mixing the melted butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla first. Then add the dry ingredients. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and I added about 2oz of chopped baking chocolate after mixing everything else. Spreading in the pan is a task, but perseverance pays off. I also bumped the oven up to 325. Don’t expect the batter to spread and rise while baking, as there is no leavening agent (baking soda or powder).

I made these last night and they were very yummy.  I like my brownies really sweet so I didn't take the advice of other reviews to cut back on the sugar.  However, next time I make these, I will cut back on the sugar as they are SUPER sweet.  Walnuts would probably offset the sweet flavor.  Also, they *are* very hard to spread in the pan so I put some water on my fingers to spread it out and that seemed to work.

This is a great recipe though I modified a few things.  I only used 1 cup of sugar and added about 1/8 cup of strongly brewed coffee to the cocoa to moisten it.  I beat the sugar and eggs together then added the moistened cocoa paste to the eggs & sugar until everything was smooth. Then I stirred in the flour.  I also added walnuts, orange extract, and red pepper for a truly grown up delight.

These are the best brownies I've ever had!! After reading most of the reviews, I conclude that people who don't like these either messed up measuring the ingredients or they didn't mix it well enough (a mixer is essential for this one). The only changes I made were to use dark cocoa powder and a buttered & floured pan instead of parchment paper. It puffed up a little during baking and then fell down a bit to make a lovely chewy texture. Yummy!! :p~

These are amazing. I do alot of baking and I am a HUGE chocolate and brownie fan.  These were the best!  I followed the recipe exactly but I didn't use the parchment paper just alot of Pam. I also just dunped the lump into the dish and kind of gently punched it around until it was even. I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips but they weren't needed.   THis will be my only brownie recipe - no more store bought they were so easy too!

at first we followed the recipe exactly.  but when we mixed the egg mixture with the dry stuff it just turned out crumbly and very powdery. we tried adding an extra egg.  then we tried adding milk--but we ran out, so we added 2 tbs of soymilk.  with no prevail, we decided to just double the recipe (add more of everything but the cocoa) and it came out fine. It was a very very dense dough and we had trouble spreading it in the pan. it was very dry and very rich. 
i wonder what i did wrong? 
it is a little misleading to rate a recipe high when there were so many alterations done to it. 
If you altered a recipe, repost it! Please don't just give it high ratings.

This is what brownies are supposed to be, if you want something else look for chocolate CAKE recipes.

Adding milk makes them a bit cakey, take the time to measure right and spread it in the pan, it dosn't pour. Try an oiled spatula. And don't forget the parchment in the instructions, helps to read those.

Very pleasantly surprised about this recipe, was not expecting the brownies to taste sooo good!! These brownies taste just like brownies should. They are very chocolately so can taste sickly if you eat too many or haven’t got a major sweet tooth!

If you’re a brownie lover you will love this recipe so I recommend that you give it a go. I would absolutely make them again.

This is one of my favorite recipes as you almost always have all these ingredients on hand and when that brownie craving hits you are covered. Plus, this is quick and easy to make.  I have chronic pain so can't fuss with a lot of steps or ingredients, everyone in my support group loves this recipe!!

I made these last night and actually...eating one now and they are wonderful! It was not kidding when the recipe said that the batter would be thick and sticky. I had a little bit of a hard time speading it in the pan and had to cook it a little longer as I took the advice of others and cooked it in a 9x9 pan. I lessened the sugar as others mentioned to 1 1/2 cups and they were definitely sweet enough. The only problem was that they seemed to be a little crumbly when cutting them but as far as the taste....it can't be beat. Will definietly make them again...maybe next time...add a half cup or so of chocolate chips too  :)

I would have to say that this recipe is wonderful! I live in Mongolia as a missionary and have never before made Brownies from scratch, but since Mongolia doesn't have such things as Brownines in a box I decided to try it out as a surprise for some of the men on my team here. They were gone in no time!  Since then I have been asked to make them over and over again.  I have one suggestion; I doubled the recipe to be used in a 9x13 inch pan and they came out really thick and chewey.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  This will be a keeper especially when I go back to America, no more of this boxed stuff!  I'm converted!

Although taste-wise, these are the PERFECT brownies (in my opinion), I can't give it 5 stars because the measurements of some key ingredients are wrong. As suggested by other reviewers, I reduced the cocoa to 3/4 cups and the sugar to 1 cup. I mixed the ingredients in one by one in the order listed in the recipe. Baked it in an 8X8 baking dish. Turned out REALLY yummmmmmmmy and it's so easy!

We were told we had to do this review for marks.  The brownies were very good, considering the cake like brownies are definatly not good.  So we all thought these brownies were awesome.  They tasted like the two-bite brownies that you can buy from A&P.  The only thing I could say would be about a quarter cup less sugar, because I had to drink a full bag of milk with each one.

Love,
The KD Boys

Very good, chewy brownies.  These are rich, and although I thought about not putting in as much cocoa powder as the recipe called for, I did and they were very good.  I disagree with some of the other reviews about only using 1 or 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, I would use the full 2 cups, as the unsweetened cocoa is very bitter.  I baked these in a 9x9 greased pan for 45 mintues and they came out great!   My husband loved them!

This is truly the chewiest brownie recipe!!  As far as I'm concerned, a brownie isnt a brownie if it isnt chewy.  I baked the brownies a little longer to make them chewier, and put in a little less cocoa the second time I made these because I dont my brownies as strong as many people do.  I've finally found a brownie recipe for my recipe book!  Thank You, Kristin!

I found this recipe just ok. I didn't change it much, I reduced the sugar by half a cup and instead of putting parchment I greased and floured my dish. Even with less sugar I found them very sweet. Like others said, they were to thin and a smaller pan was needed. The batter was very thick, I had to flatten it with a wet hand. I assumed the batter would even out when cooked but my fingers were still indented in the brownies when removed from the oven which did not make them the most attractive to serve.

Very good but not as chewy as I would've expected given that they're supposed to be the 'chewiest'!  The edges were nice and chewy though, and the flavor was very chocolatey.  I added some instant coffee too.  Will make again.

Yuuuuum! My boyfriend (a chocoholic) and I loved these. We could have eaten the entire batch in one day.
I usually make MMMM Brownies (delicious, but cakey not fudgy) but was out of chocolate chips so I decided to try something new. Like others, I reduced the cocoa to 3/4 cup (maybe a bit more), and the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I am allergic to milk and soy so I used a 1/2 cup of extra light olive oil instead of the melted butter. I baked mine for about 37 minutes at 300 and they came out wonderfully!
Thanks Krissyp, I will be adding these to my chocolate repertoire!

This is exactly what I was looking for! I did cut back to 3/4 cups of cocoa powder though. I used all organic ingredients so maybe that's why I thought it seemed like enough cocoa at 3/4. I added it 1/4 a time. These were the best chewie brownies ever! I don't like cakey brownies, if I wanted cake I would make a cake! These are the best! Thank you so much for this recipe : )

I really love the rich, chocolatey flavor of this recipes. I took other's advice and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 c. I also like my brownies fudgy rather than cakey, so I added some vegetable oil, too. A great recipe!

I had high hopes for these but I was disappointed. I wanted chewy, chocolatey brownies with a nice crisp/flakey top. The kind you would pay money for. I got the crisp/flakey top kinda. These were also thinner than I had hoped but I knew there were going to be when making the batter. Baked at 300 degrees for about 35 min but everything except the outer inch and a half still seemed a little under cooked. Now for the flavor. I mixed together my flour and cocoa in one bowl and in another I mixed all of the other ingredients in another bowl until the mixture was pale then added the flour/cocoa. With the amount of sugar called for I was concerned that the batter would be grainy in texture. I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and the cocoa down to 3/4 cup. The brownies were still grainy and literally tasted like sugar and cocoa. I felt guilty eating them and really wished they were richer in taste so I could at least feel like my guilt was somehow justified. Needless to say I wouldn't spend money on these but because I have them and I don't want to waste I am going to try covering them up with some ice cream.

Really great!! My daughter and her friend made these and absolutely loved them! Although, I do suggest baking them for a little longer (around 10 minutes) and maybe on a higher temperature. After only 30 minutes for us, they were still a little undercooked. Although they were still really delicious without being fully cooked (we had to try), they were even better when cooked! Over all, a great recipe!!!

THE best brownie recipe I've tried in years! I use proportions for 26 servings (about 0.25 cup more of flour and cocoa), omitted the salt and added about between 0.33 & 0.5 cup of caramel apple dip I had in the frig that needed a home, LOL. To be honest, I don't remember how long I baked them: I popped them in the oven, ran to grab a gallon of milk down the street (about a quarter mile) and came back and a knife came out clean. WARNING: DO NOT eat these brownies without milk. LOL! THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!!!

100% chewy!! Just like the title. I love the chewiness. I hated when it just came out from the oven, it looked greasy. But after it completely cooled, the grease's gone. Especially when you put it in the fridge. I put 1c cocoa, Dutch processed,  and less 2-3T sugar from the recipe called for. Still sweet, but not overly sweet. I was hoping slightly bitter, but it wasn't. Anyway, good recipe!!

OMG! This is the best brownies I've tried so far. Even better than the 5 star scrumptious fudgy brownie recipe in this site. I followed reviews from others though, 3/4 cup butter, 3/4 cup cocoa (i used hershey's), and 1 1/2 cup sugar.Yes, this brownies baked thin. I greased the pan with some vege oil, line with parchment and greased the parchment as well. Brownies can be taken out of the pan this way. YUMMM!!!! ..now i'm scared of too much chocolate in my diet!!! :D

Very chocolatey and moist! However, I felt the texture resembled that of a cake's, despite the description. Perhaphs I have to chill the brownie first (I ate it right out of the oven :)Overall, pretty delicious, moist, full of flavour, QUICK AND EASY, will defintely make again!  My variations: reduced sugar to 1 cup (it was sweet enough like that), reduced cocoa powder to 3/4 cup,  added 1/4 cup oil, did not have to use milk. Variations to method, as per a fellow reviewer's suggestions, mix melted butter, sugar, vanilla, and eggs. Mix till the mixture just very very slightly pulls away from sides. In seperate bowl, mix reminaing dry ingredients. Mix both together. I felt that with these modifications, the batter was of a good consistency and baked up well. Also, to ensure brownie rises and does not end up so thin, leave battter in mixing bowl for about 10 mins before baking. Mine rose like muffins!

This recipe is terrific!  I've made these several times now, and have never had any issues, though I've noticed that some other people have had some trouble!  Here are some helpful suggestions: 

1. If you used Splenda or reduced the amount of sugar, the texture will absolutely be dry/hard.  The sugar needs to melt to contribute to the moistness of these brownies.  
2. If your brownies were grainy, your oven temperature might be off.  Most are!  Try baking these again at 325 instead.
3. If your brownies tasted too much like cocoa powder, it could be because there were chunks of cocoa powder in your mix.  Cocoa powder tends to clump.  Sift it and combine all dry ingredients together before adding the wet ingredients.
4. If these weren't cakey enough for you... its because this isn't a "cakey" brownie recipe!  There are no leavening ingredients to give you a "fluffy" texture.  You're going to get a dense, chewy brownie because that is what this recipe was designed to give you.

Great recipe, and if followed properly will give you some great brownies.  Thanks for sharing!

sooo rich! the first time i made them, my boyfriend ate half of them in one evening and spent the night moaning "chocolate..." with a tummy-ache. that did not prevent him from finnishing them off the next day, however.

the next time i made them, i used half the chocolate and half the butter, almost doubled the flour and added half a cup of applesauce. oh-my-gosh, they are the fudgiest brownies and very still chocolatey.

These are definately the 'chewiest' brownies I have ever had, somewhere between fudge and traditional brownies?  Kept the cocoa and sugar as called and there was a very slight grainy consistancy, but did not bother me at all they were SO good!  Next time will skip the parchment paper and try greasing the bottom of the pan.

I really like these brownies because they are super chewy. The only thing is, they get hard very fast. Perhaps I am over baking them? I have made them three times and I find the best use of them is to bake them and them cut them up and cover them in ganache and people love them!

I used dark cocoa when I made - so they actually turned out to be "blackies" rather than "brownies". I put them in an 8x8 pan since so many reviews said they had to double them to fill the 9x13 - and I have to say one recipe in an 8x8 is perfect. I also pressed semi-sweet chocolate chips into the top since the batter is more like cookie dough and once it was in the pan I couldn't stir it or anything. Keep in mind that if you put them in an 8x8 they will take a lot longer than 30 min. I forgot and kept checking them and wondering why they weren't done yet! Doh!

This is the brownie recipe that I have been looking for.  This makes the most dense, chewy and rich brownies I have ever made.  If you want cake-like brownies then go buy a box of Duncan Hines because this recipe is not for you.  I do recommend that you experiment yourself with the time you let these bake.  The people that ended up with gooey brownies apparently don't know how to check doneness with baked goods and this is something you must make sure is done.

Like others I used 1/2 cup of cocoa and 1 1/2 cups sugar. I still found these brownies too sweet. I definitely like the consistency but will probably increase the cocoa to the full cup and decrease the sugar to 1 cup in the future.

What makes these brownies so chewy is that there's so much dry mixture.  This means that the mixture you end up getting is very thick so you must have strong arms to mix it!

I would also recommend using less sugar.

The best brownies - fast and easy to make!  I scaled the recipe down to fit an 8x8" pan - 1 cup sugar, 1/3 cup melted butter, 2 eggs, 1.5 tsp vanilla, 3/4 cup flour, 3/4 cup cocoa, 1/8 tsp salt, 1 tbsp light cream, 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Very bizarre.  The batter was VERY thick, as indicated in the recipe.  So thick that I couldn't spread it well in the pan.  ALso the batter never spread out in the pan during baking.  I pulled it out and it looked exactly as if it were still batter--but cooked.  I have never had that happen to me.  I follwed the recipe exactly, used high quality cocoa and vanilla, and baked it exactly 30 minutes.  What happened?

Very chewy. Have to let them cool completely, which is their only downfall (I love eating brownies warm, and when these are warm they're soft and gooey, but not chewy).

As the name is, these brownies are very chewy, and not to mention dense. I had to put the brownies into the oven for an extra ten minutes. The top of the brownies were really hard too, almost like a sugar coating. The brownies also crumbled very easily. I had to layer the crumbs with vanilla bean ice cream. However, the taste did some how make up for them. Probably will not make them again, unless upon request.

Absolutely delicious!! I made these with my friends and we finished it the same night. It's so chocolately and gooey and stays chewy in your mouth...if only my family liked chocolate I would make this more often.

I actually made this a second time and substituted the butter with apple sauce and the sugar with brown sugar and it still tasted as good as the original!

These suck.  Don't know what I did wrong- I followed the recipe exactly- they didn't rise at all and tasted like dough even after baking for 45 min.  Take my advice and don't waste your time on these.

These were not what I expected at all. Followed recipe exactly but what I ended up  with just tasted like chocolate flavored sugar! Guess the proportion of sugar to flour should have tipped me off. Looks like I am in the minority here, thanks anyway!

They live up to the name, that's for sure. Almost too rich for me, and the bake time was a little short. I agree with another reviewer that the recipe could be thinned out with just a little milk; my dough was so thick and almost crumbly that I had to press it into the pan (but that's probably the result of heavy-handed measuring.)

This was a terrific recipe.  I was kind of scared towards the end because the mix was so thick, but they turned out great!  These definitely live up to their name, most definitely the chewiest brownies I've ever had.  The only complaint I have is that it was very hard to spread in the pan because of it's thickness.  I will definitely make these again!

Wow, these were just what I needed!  I halved the recipe and used vegetable oil instead of butter.  I baked the brownies in muffin tins and got 8 brownies out of the half recipe.  I baked them at 350 degrees for 22 minutes, and they are perfectly chocolatey and moist.  I did have to add about 2 tablespoons of milk to wet all of the ingredients, though.  I think I like this recipe even better than boxed brownie mixes!

I've tried this recipe twice to make sure I did it right -- kept checking steps and did everything like I was told, but both times it was horribly grainy -- like eating chocolate-flavoured granulated sugar. Simply awful.

I enjoyed these wonderful brownies, but I thought the batter was a bit too thick to use parchment.  Having a pan lined with parchment and then trying to spread out a thick batter was difficult.  I would recommend, instead, to grease and flour the pan instead of using parchment paper.

These brownies were delicious. I made them this morning and they are fudgey and not cakelike. I've been looking for a good chewy brownie and this is it. I did add 1/8 cup oil to the recipe and creamed the butter,sugar, oil, and eggs before adding other ingredients. I also suggest the 8x8 pan. Wonderful recipe.

The brownie is truely very chocolaty and thick, but it's not as chewy as I expected it to be.  The texture is more chalky and not very moist.  I might try baking it again with other's suggestion by adding some more oil.  Taste great, just not what I expected.

I was having a powerful chocolate attack and thought this sounded good.  They weren't just good, but great.  I added some chocolate chips to the batter.  These are very rich & chewy.  It is a VERY thick batter so don't worry, they turn out great.  Thanks for the recipe, Kristin!

Tried this recipe w/out changing anything but I didn't like the texture, it's like eating batter although I put it in the oven longer. I used 4 eggs the second time & creamed the butter & sugar (1-1/2 cups only). This turned out right for me as this is how I like my brownie. I used 9"x13" pan & it's just right.

I can't believe how great these turned out.  Just like the Betty Crocker box ones, but way better.  I was very pleased with these.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were great, except I did use a 9x9 pan.  GREAT!!!  I will never buy the box brownies again.  Thank you so much, Kristin, for an awesome recipe!

I did not like this recipie at all.  I followed the instructions to a tee and these brownies came out really grainy and way too sweet.  The amount of cocoa didn't bug me, but the batter came out really tough and the brownies cooked up all lumpy on the top.  I had to wonder if my brownies were even cooking because they didn't flatten out on top.  I don't reccomend this one.

If you're looking for a fudgey, chewy, cholately brownie then you've found it. Unlike the brownies that are made with chocolate squares, this one comes out ireesistably rich and not cakey at all.

This was the most disgusting brownie I have ever put in my mouth.  They are gritty and have too much cocoa in them. I had to drink nearly 3 glasses of milk and brush my teeth twice before the taste was out of my mouth. YEEEEUCK!!!

I have nothing but raves about this recipe! The batter is very thick but I put it in to a 12 cup cupcake tin (the batter filled 11 cups) because I felt in a 9x13 pan they would be too thin, like others have said. I baked them for slightly too long (oops!) but even though they were crunchy on the outside (my fault) they were still chewy and moist in the center. I will definitely make these again! Thanks for ruining yet another diet!! hahaha.

This was super easy, and were AWESOME tasting! Kind of like fudge, and my husband ate them until he was sick ("Too sweet? Nahhhh!")  I did have to bake them longer (1 hour), but made them in a 8 x 8 pan. They are definitely a keeper in my recipe box!

These brownies are sooo good! I would give them 5 stars but I had to use the alternative recipe given by most of the other reviewers which calls for 1 and 1/2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa powder, and 3/4 cup butter. Changing the measurements made them perfect though! I’ve made them 3 times now.

i just don't understand why reviewers give five stars for a recipe that needs so much tweaking to make it work. this recipe yielded crumbly, overly sweet brownies that were gritty from too much sugar. even the middle, which i left quite underbaked, became almost rock solid & sand-like after cooling. we barely choked through the brownies, even with adding ice cream they were so sweet & gritty we could hardly eat them. 

i should have trusted my instincts and added more oil or an extra egg & decreased the sugar significantly, but with so many five star reviews i decided to make the recipe "as is." when i later looked through the reviews, even the five star ones had MAJOR alterations to the recipe in order to make it yield the correct results. shame on me for not doing all my research, and shame on reviewers for not rating this recipe accurately to reflect the amount of tweaking it really needs.

i definitely won't make this recipe again!

Made a few changes according to comments and my preference and these were absolute warm chewy chocolatey heaven, especially in my brownie sundae!!! Use 1 cup sugar (I used half dark brown, half light brown because that's all I had); 3/4 cup cocoa; 1/4 cup vegetable oil (in addition to listed butter). I also followed my tastes and added plenty of chocolate chips and candied pecans (pecans toasted in butter and brown sugar). Finally, I cooked in 8x8 pan so brownies are nice and thick. I overcooked them the first time -- 300F for 1 hour in an 8x8 is too much, they were dry. This time I did 300F for 25 minutes and 275F for 35 minutes and they were perfect! The center was 158F when I took it out which is about the safe temp to cook things containing eggs. Absolutely delicious!!!

Best chewy brownie recipe ever! I did as other reviewers suggested and decreased the cocoa powder to 3/4 cup and sugar to 1 1/2 cup (I did 3/4 c white sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar). I baked mine in a 9" pie pan at 300 for 40-45 minutes and they were PERFECT!

By far the best chewiest brownies, just don't over cook it.  I don't really like cakey brownies. If I wanted a chocolate cake I shall make a chocolate cake, but a brownie should be nice and dense like this one.  thumbs up!!!

The best brownies I've ever had. I love them as is. I do mix the dry ingredients first and then add in the wet just so it mixes easier. The batter is like no other and the greased parchment is a must!

We're still waiting on the brownies to cool off but I wanted to say that we did what several others did by tweaking the quantities & it still took an hour to bake & I'm not sure it's even done. I baked at 300 for 30 min (it was soupy), then 325 for 30. I used parchment paper in an 11x7 pan. If I had used a 13x9 per original instructions it would have been way too thin.

Followed the suggestions of other comments:
3/4c cocoa powder, 1 1/2 brown sugar and 3/4 cup shortening, then mixed in a cup of marshmallows in the batter. It looked like play doh -- not like brownie batter at all. Wanted to throw it out because it almost wouldn't even out on the pan, but baked it anyway for 35 mins. WAS I SURPRISED! It was the BEST brownies I've ever made and are currently my #1 fave. Will be making these again this weeked.

Too chocolately. Had a very flat flavour profile, no depth at all. Overwhelming cocoa powder and grainy sugar flavor.

Used 3/4 cup cocoa, 1-1/2 cups sugar, and baked for 5 mins longer. Also, I did line the baking dish with parchment paper, and had to let them sit for 2-3 hours to set. But, after that, eveybody raved about them! Loved their chewy texture and small portions (they are thin if you use a 9X13 pan). they are a teeny bit sticky, and slightly greasy. But even as finger food, I had zero complaints! awesome recipe

What did I do wrong? My batter/dough was not spreadable at all. It had the consistency of clay rather than a very thick batter. And when I baked it, it didn't rise at all. I had an extremely chewy brownie. On the taste, it was too sweet.

I don't know what I did wrong. I followed the recipe except I used an 8x8 for 'thicker' brownies. It was similar to eating a pumice stone. I SOOO wanted to love these.

This recipe is great! I followed the advice of using 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cocoa powder and I even substituted the butter with shortening. The brownies ended up being really soft and chewy, I am extremely impressed!

In my quest for chewy brownies, I came upon this recipe.  I prefer chewy, not cakey brownies.  This recipe delivers.  I did take other reviewers' suggestions by decreasing the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup and decreasing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  Definately chewy.  Dough is sticky, so I added a splash of milk and lined an 8x8 pan with parchment and spread mixture on top.  Next time, I will double recipe.  Not the prettiest, but definately the tastiest & chewiest recipe I've ever tried.  Outside crust is crackly and slightly crisp.  I may try pouring chocholate ganache over the top next time.  Yummy!

Delicious! This recipe produces brownies like you wouldn't believe. My friends have been constantly harping on me to make more each time they come over. If you're interested in making little brownies, like the two-bite ones that are incredibly addictive, mine turned out quite well when I baked the batter in small silicone muffin cups for 14 minutes @300F. Have fun with this... they are so good!

Very fudgy and rich. A few drawbacks: bakes into a thin brownie and if you cook it even two or three minutes too long, the top and edges become very dry and crunchy.

Just like others, I changed the recipe a tad to get the texture to match the taste.  Reduced cocoa (organic pure dark) to 3/4 cup and sugar to 1.5 cups. Also added 1/4 cup oil for texture and vanilla pure paste vice extract for smoother taste.  Using the parchment brushed with melted butter certainly does prevent this from sticking, which it absolutely will otherwise.   It isn't really chewy while it is still hot, but once it cools it becomes much moreso. Very tasty, very rich and just perfect when the craving hits you for chocolate brownies!

I followed the recipe exactly and these did not turn out very good. They were way to sweet and had a grainy texture. Not sure if I did something wrong or what but they were not very good. Really just felt like they were missing something. Maybe I'll try again with the alterations.

My 5-year-old basically made these with my direction while I held the baby (they are REALLY easy to make). We loved them -- delicious!  Very chewy (like we like them).  I'm not sure why others found them grainy -- ours turned out perfect.

It lives up to it's name :D But I halfed it to a 9 inch pan, used 3 tbsp cocoa and round 5(?) tablespoon sugar, to sweeten it/balance out the bitterness of the cocoa. Will make it in 9X13 pan next time :)

I think these are fine. I reduced the amount of sugar to 300g from 400g as per other reviews. I left all other ingredients the same and I mixed the sugar, butter, vanilla and eggs together first before adding the dry ingredients a little at a time. I used a 10in round and spread it into the pan. I cooked for longer than the recipe stated as I was not comfortable with the raw feeling of the mix after 30 minutes. I cooked for 35 mins then left in the oven as it cooled down for about another 5 mins. It got quite hard on the top but in cutting into them found the rest of the mix was chewy and soft. Very delicious!  Planning to share these with ice cream on top!

These were great when it first came out of the oven. I thought it was a bit crumbly and grainy when making and high hopes that the end result would be great but it was just ok. I stored it in a plastic container with the lid and in 2 days it turned as hard as a rock! I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds(per my hubby) and it tasted soft again. So I don't think that I will make these again.

WOW! This is a great recipe... I tweaked to be lower in sugar by using Splenda (about 1/2 the recommended amount) and it worked great! They turned out to be very chewy and rich. I give this a thumb up all the way!

In a word, Bad.  I follwed the recipe exactly as written.  They were easy to make.  I greased my pan and my paper and after they cooled they were so sticky I couldn't pry the paper off.  Who wants to eat a brownie with little bits of paper stuck all over the bottom?  The bite I did manage to scrape out wasn't very good, it tasted like raw batter.  
I was really let down by this one.

I was on a search for the best brownies, since i didnt have my own favorite recipe, this is the first and only recipe i tried since it was perfect! i decreased the cocoa to 3/4 cup as suggested and they were still heaps chocolatey!Next time i think i will decrease the sugar as well. A great recipe! Definately a keeper!

These were really cakey, and I was specifically looking for a chewy brownie recipe. But they still turned out delicious. My fiance loved them and I ate them as well but will still look around for another chewy recipe.

These brownies are very chewy, very good, but chewy. And teh 9x13 pan didn't work out for me. I think I'm going to use something more square. My brownies came out paper thin, they didn't look too presentable, but tasted very good. You have to like chewy brownies to enjoy these.

I've made this twice.  The first time was exactly to specification and turned out perfectly.  The second time, I only had medium-sized eggs and had to add a third (luckily, I knew what texture to look for from the first attempt.)  I also added white chocolate chips the second time.  
For a fancy-looking dessert, serve with a dollop of homemade whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Magnificently rich and delicious!!  Received highest marks from my husband and his buddies...

These have to be the most divine brownies that I've ever tasted! I made the following changes (per recommendation of other posters): Decreased the cocoa powder to 3/4C, decreased the sugar to 1 1/2C and increased the melted butter to 3/4C. I've shared very small amounts :) with others and they LOVE them!

The flavor of these brownies if very good but the texture is a mess.  They are sticky, not chewy.  They are impossible to cut cleanly.  The brownie just gathers on the knife & it ends up a sticky crumbling mess.  They are very messy & you need to eat them with a fork.  "Chewiest Brownies" simply isn't true.  "Glueiest Brownies" would be more fitting.  I wont make this again.  I gave 3 stars because they do at least taste decent.

These brownies taste amazing.  They are definitely a much chewier type of brownie, which I really love.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used an 8 X 10 pan instead of the 9 X 13.  They took much longer to bake, about 20 minutes longer.  They definitely are a brownie that have to  let cool, although they taste delicious warm (I couldn't wait)  Some people have remarked that these are too chocolatey??? Is there such a thing?  will make these again, since they are easy to make and I alwways have the ingredients on hand.  The only thing I might change next time is to sift the cocoa and the flour, and mix the ingredients much better.  Overall it was great though.

did my girls do something wrong?  THAT is the question! LOL!  they were a little thicker than a piece of paper and dry [9x13 pan].  may try it again - with supervision, or just use a different recipe all together. Hmmmm....

These brownies are awesome. I gave them 4 stars only because I did make some of the changes suggested by other reviewers: used extra 2 tbsp of butter, reduced cocoa to 3/4 c., reduced sugar to 1 1/2 c., and baked at 325 in an 8 inch pan for 36 minutes. I didn't have a problem with the batter being too dry  as mentioned by some reviews. These brownies stay moist and fudgy inside, which is just the way we like them!

I made one batch of this recipe, but it wasn't thick enough to fill the pan so I had to make another batch. I put the two batches together in the 13 x 9 and baked it 30 minutes--the brownies looked really weird and were really gooey. I said they tasted like someone poured chocolate syrup over them, but someone else said they tasted like they WERE chocolate syrup. I don't know, they aren't really brownies, but they were still a surprisingly good brownie fudge mush thing.

This was the weirdest baked huh ?good? ever.  It definitely was not a brownie.  I followed it to a T.  Maybe I should have mixed the dry ingredients 1st and then added the wet, I don't know.  It took a long time to bake, and then never really set, and when it kind of did, it had a really thick, cakey gooey texture, if that's possible.  Very weird concoction.

Fabulous! I just finished making them and my family couldn't wait for the 30 minute cool down. They loved it! For my own taste, I might cut the cocoa down to 3/4 cup, but   that's all I would change. Unless I planned on serving it with vanilla ice cream, then I would leave it as is. This is definitely more like the brownies you would get in nicer restaurant, not the box kind. This is actually the first recipe that I have tried on this site that actually turned out! THANKS! It's a keeper!

I had a recipe very similar to this but, lost it in a move.  I always made mine, by melting the butter on the stove, then adding the sugar, cook until melted then add vinalla, salt and flour.  I then remove from heat and add eggs beaten one at a time to the warm batter.  finally I add the cocoa.  cook as directed.  I was so excited to see this recipe, for the porportions were the same and I just could not remember. I did increase the butter by 1/2 a stick. YUMMY my family loves them!!!! Thank you

These weren't very good to me.  They were more mushy than chewy.  The insides were mush and the outside was crunchy, and I followed the recipe exactly.  I was a little disappointed.  I won't make these again.

this was the first time i have never made brownies without a mix and let me tell you, after making these i don't think i will ever get them out of a box again! these were so good and moist! i was skeptical at first because the batter came out REALLY thick but they cooked up great and i actually added an extra 5 minutes to the timer, even though previous reviews said that they would settle i wanted to be sure. the brownies were delicious and devoured by my family very quickly! i will definately make them again!

These brownies were definitely chewy and chocolatey. I also liked that they used cocoa powder. Other recipes use baker's chocolate, and I didn't have any on hand. 

However, they were much too sweet! My husband will eat pretty much anything resembling a brownie, and after he had one, he said he wasn't going to eat any more. We'll probably chop them up into chunks and mix them into vanilla ice cream in small batches, so they don't go to waste.

This was exactly what I was looking for. They are very chewy and very moist. I cut the cocoa to 1/2 cup and offset it with some dark belgium chocolate. They were heavenly! I used mini muffin pans and pressed out the batter with moist finger tips. I will defintely keep this recipe forever! Thanks for sharing!!

ive made them 3 times now, thinking maybe the change in weather, humidity or something would help.  followed the recipe to a "t" and they still didn't turn out even close to being good.  yes, they were chewy; entirely too chewy and wet.  Some review said these are 5 star restaurant brownies - I would have to highly disagree. I'm giving this a 2 star instead of 1 or non because they were still edible and i like chocolate and these are very chocolatey.

Taste was okay, but a little on the bitter side; not chocolately enough for me.  Not suited for our tastes, but does live up to its name of being chewy.

I followed the exact recipe the first time and extended the baking time. As a result, it was crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Just the way I like it! But it was way too sweet for me, though. Made another batch with less sugar and it turned out to be cakey and not chewy at all. Guess I have to live with the sweetness after all. My 7 & 11 yr old siblings loved these so much. They didn't mind the sweetness.

These brownies are a hit in my household. I do recommend not using the parchment paper. It was huge mess for me. I would however spray PAM or another non stick spray in the pan. I also sprayed some on my hands to flatten out the mixture with ease. Coming out of the oven, they almost looked undercooked, but I resisted the urge to put them back in, and they turned out beautifully. They are moist, rich, and chewy!

We thought these were good. I thought they were a little too cakey, so next time I will put some veggie oil in the batter. I took another reviewers advice, and only put 1/2 cup cocoa, and 1 1/3 cups sugar, and they tasted just right.  I also used an 8x8 glass dish. I will definetely make these again, thankyou!

This wasn't too bad.  My husband absolutely loved them.  I was hoping for something a little different.  I baked it at 325 for 30 mins and it came out perfect.  Also used one person's advice, and splashed a lil milk to make it workable.

While my husband loved these brownies, I agreed with another user that all I could taste was the sugar.  These would probably be great for a torte, but I can't eat them on their own.

These brownies do live up to their name. Nice-n-Chewy. They were a bit over chocolatey..tasted a lot like a piece of fudge with a chewy brownie texture. I used half for a torte..crumbling up the brownies with layers of chocolate pudding and cool whip. It was perfect for that recipe and would use it again.

These weren't so bad.  I baked the brownies in a 8x8 pan in the oven at 300F for about 45 minutes.  I really like the chewiness of these on the inside, but the crust is just too hard.

The taste was pretty good, but the texture was a bit chalky/gritty.  My four year old loved them though.  The only thing I did different was to add chopped walnuts.  They are also very thin, though that's not a bad thing.

Not sure if I'll make them again.

These brownies tasted good, and were chewy as promised. I found them a little too sweet and chocolatey for my taste. They also took a lot longer to cook than the recipe instructed.

These ROCK!  The only thing I did differently was to use 4 1 oz. squares of melted unsweetened chocolate instead of cocoa.  {Personal taste preference}  They were done in exactly 30 minutes at 300 degrees, just as the recipe states.  They do get just a bit of a thin crust on the top, but it's yummy and a nice contrast to the soft and chewy inside.  The only way I can imagine these would be called "Grainy" is that the crust part is not quite as smooth as the inside, which is heavenly.  I left them all in the pan since I wasn't going to serve them all at once.  I covered the pan with Saran Wrap when the brownies weren't quite totally cooled.  I keep them in the microwave so my kids can't reach them at will.  I don't know if any of this has helped to keep them from having the "drying out fast" problems some reviewers have noticed, but I've got half a pan left and they're still perfect 3 days after I made them.

Thanks for the great recipe, Kristin!

This is a wonderful recipe for fudgie type brownies, my favorite. I have searched for years for a brownie recipe such as this one!! I did decrease the sugar to l l/2 cups, and they were still decadant!!  The batter is VERY thick, I actually used my hands to pat it into the pan. I frosted them with a quick fudge frosting.  Next time I will be adding pecans or walnuts.  Thanks for sharing.

I was looking for a brownie recipe one day when I was craving them.  I found this and it is EXCELLENT.  They are real chewy, which is exactly  how my family likes them.  I will be making these instead of buying the mix.

These brownies are more like fudge than like brownies to me.  I'm looking for brownies that aren't cake-like, but aren't fudge-like either:  that chewy texture between those two extremes. These aren't it; but if you want fudgy brownies, these are great!

I have been making these pretty regularly for the last 6 months. And I ALWAYS get asked for the recipe. They are very choclatey and very chewy.

They are not really a dessert type brownie, and I prefer to serve them as a snack. I prefer something a little fudgier which I can pair with ice cream and drizzle with chocolate sauce as a dessert....
These always turn out perfect, even when I accidently left them in too long, and they kind of burned....they still tasted good!
This is fool-proof recipe. Also you can make it in about 3minutes!!

thank you so much!

These are exactly what my definition of brownies should be: rich, chocolately, slightly chewy, and heavy. These are the best I've tried, and are a hit with the family too. Very easy to make. They go great with ice cream or on their own.

This was great, except not enought batter for bundt pan.  I increased the milk to 3/4 cup, baked in a 9x9 for 35 minutes, and put the crumbs on top of the cake, not the bottom (the original recipe has crumbs at the bottom of the bundt).

I tried this recipe 2 times, hoping I did something wrong.  They got very hard after a couple of hours and they were very hard to cut.  The last time I took them to a party and when we were ready for them they were hard.  I was very disapointed. I won't use it again.

These were really chewy. Making the changes to 3/4 cup cocoa, adding 1/8 cup of oil, and lessened the sugar to 1 1/2 cup. Then I added chocolate chips and marshmallows for fun. They turned out moist, chewy and very tasty.
-It only gets a lower rating for for the instruction issues.

Alright, its true, they are REALLY chewy. But these are FUDGY brownies. I took the advice and used a smaller pan (9x9) and added 1/8 of a cup of oil. It took a good 55 minutes to cook these threw. I thought after all the good reviews that these would be good, but I was really disapointed. Although they had a good flavor, they just weren't what I was looking for. Sorry..

CHEWY!!!  It's very hard to find a brownie from scratch recipe that's not cakey but here it is!  I served these at a candle party and people were asking for the recipe! I did add 14 cup veg. oil and only used about 34 cup cocoa - because that's all I had left so I threw in some mini chocolate chips instead.  I didn't have that paper on hand so I just greased the bottom of an 8x8 pan and baked at just over 300 for 35 minutes (I have a hot little oven though).  Thanks so much for sharing!!!!

If you gave this less than 5 stars, you either messed it up or don't like rich, luscious, moist brownies.  These MUST be doubled or baked in an 8x8 or 9X9, but remember to increase baking time accordinly.  These are incredibly fudge-like so if you like dry, cakey brownies, stay away.  Oh, and this recipe makes the "best brownies" recipe taste like a jiffy box mix!

This recipe is POOR.  Since previous "reviewers" stated that brownie was too thin using the recommended recipe, I prepared one and one-half times the batter and placed in a 13x9 inch pan.  I checked it after cooking for 30 minutes and there was no way it was done.  I cooked it for at least another 30 minutes and it appeared done when I stuck a toothpick in the middle.  However, after a few minutes of cooling time, I attempted to cut a square and it was raw/fudge-like at the lower section of the brownie.  (Note:  Seemed odd to me that the oven temperature be set at only 300 degrees.  Maybe setting oven at 350 degrees would work better?)  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE.

I agree with some of the reviews that said not to use a 9x13 pan. I used one, and they came out too thin. I like a nice thick brownie. But I rated them a four because I thought the taste was good, and apparently the kids did too, because they didn't last an hour! I also didn't have parchment paper, so I just greased the bottom of the pan.

This was an easy recipe to make but I found the consistancy just a bit too dry. I added a 1/4 of vegetable oil and this did the trick.

I have been on the hunt for a chewy, fudgy brownie that isn't cakey and I think I've found almost the perfect recipe! The texture was great, but I would recommend using 4oz of semi-sweet chocolate melted into the butter instead of the cocoa powder (the cocoa seems to overpower)...for all of those who prefer the taste of chocolate over cocoa. Very good recipe.

I had to add a bit of oil to the batter, but they were delicious!

Well, the name does not lie, these were VERY chewy.  Almost strange to call it a brownie.  More like dark, thick fudge.  I thought I liked chewy brownies but maybe I like them a  touch more fluffy.  They were very sweet and like another person said, the top didn't look like a brownie at all.  It wasn't a complete dissapointment (I tried to tell myself that I was just eating chocolate fudge) but I don't think I'll make these again.

If you love dark, strong, chocolate flavor, this recipe is for you. I made 3/4 batch and baked in a 8x8 pan, and the thickness was just right. I would NOT use a 9x13.  I also cut back on the sugar and they were sooo rich and fudgy.  I didn't have any parchment paper, so I put PAM in the pan, and they didn't stick at all.  I can honestly say I thought these were the best brownies I have ever made.  The strange thing is, my husband didn't like them at all. Oh well, more for me!

GREAT RECIPE!!  If you want a chewy brownie (just like the title says) this is the one.  I made these tonite for dessert.  It was just the recipe I was looking for, being in the mood for a sweet chocoholic fix.  Everyone loved them.   I did make them in a 9x9 and baked for 38 mins. and sprayed with bakers joy as others suggested.  I cant imagine how thin they would have come out in a 9x13 pan.  These were perfect.

I thought that they were a little dense, but otherwise they tasted great.  I'm one who prefers chewy brownies to the cake-like ones, so this was definitely worth the try.

Quite tasty...We used an 8x11.5 glass dish and added 1/4 cup of peanut butter to the ingredient list.  (Next time I think we'll add 1/2 cup.) Baked 40 minutes instead of 30.  Did not use parchment paper.  Just spritzed the dish with oil with a pampered chef kitchen spritzer...so Pam should work just fine too.  My husband loved them...did not wait till cooled completely...just about 5-10 minutes.  Excellent warm! We'll make these again.

These brownies were very rich, too rich for my blood. I doubled the recipe but didnt add enough time so my brownies were a little bit gooey in the middle. I patted out the mixture with my hands and the top of the brownie was pretty smooth. I didnt have pachment paper so I covered a paper bag in cooking spray and that worked really well.

I have been using this recipe for quite a long time now, more than a year I know. I love these brownies because they are exactly as described, rich, chocolatey, chewy, and not cakey. I double this recipe for my family and bake it in a 9x13 inch pan so they are nice and thick the way we like them. If you are just making what the recipe calls for I would take the advice of others and make this in a 9x9 inch pan or they are too thin. Thank you Kristin!

These taste okay, not great, although next time I will use less sugar and probably less cocoa! I had to use the confectioner's sugar to hide how ugly these looked! They look very grainy on the top, but the inside is moist, but too thin for my taste. Will use an 8x8 next time. Maybe just go with an entirely different recipe...

I can't bake anything that is not from a pre-mix box, but to my surprise this was very easy and it turned out great!  The texture was rich, with a light crust on the top, fudgy and chewy inside, even the next day.  I only had cake flour, and baked it on a 9x9 pan for 45 minutes, and it still came out great, without crumbling or rising like a cake. It is a wonderful overdose of chocolate - that's what brownies are for, right?

These are SUPER GOOD! I made them in a 9 by 9 pan, sprinkled them with chocolate chips and pecans, poured on about half a bottle of Caramel ice cream topping, and baked for 40 minutes. To Die For!!!!!!!!

These brownies have a rich chocolate flavor and they are delicious! I baked them at 350F in a 8"x8" pan for forty minutes.  The corners were a little hard and there was more of a crust than I'm used to, but who cares! The best tasting brownie I have ever had and I've been baking for over 20 years.  Everyone in the family loved them and they will definitely be a regular recipe in my house.  Thanks, Kristin.

I think I over baked them.  They came out a little hard.  Once I added a few slices of bread in the bag I stored them in and they softened up and they were good. Very chocolatly!  A good fudgy frosting would go great.  I will try these again.

I'm pregnant and have been craving chewy brownies just like the ones from the Duncan Hines boxed mix. But, I wanted to make them from scratch. I tried about a half dozen recipes til I found this one. My craving is satisfied :) This is by far the BEST chewy brownie recipe I have ever made. And, it's very simple, too!

Very chewy & delicious! I baked them in a 9x9 pan and next time I'd probably double the recipe to get a nice super-thick brownie. I may also add a little oil or milk to thin it out a bit since it's more like a cookie dough then a brownie batter.

This recipe makes really thin brownie that are underbaked. 30 minutes at 300 is way too short a time. They came out so gooie it was like eating batter. I think you should bake them at least 50 minutes or more...

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for since I don't really like the cakey brownie.  Next time though, I am going to double the recipe as it didn't fit in the 9 x 13 pan.  These are very chewy and good!

This recipe was kind of really awful. A lot of things need tweaking to make it work. I had to cut the whole outer ring of the brownie off because it was hard. The inside took too long to bake. Would not recommend.

Followed directions exactly. Disappointed as I was expecting brownies to rise up a bit. If I could suggest, next time I will try 1 teaspoon of baking powder.

Did not cook at all at 300.  Turned the heat up to 350 after a half hour at 300.  It was done after 20 min, could’ve taken out after 15 min.  Looked horrible but it tasted amazing!  My family loves it as well.

These were the best brownies I have ever made. I used 3/4 cocoa, 3/4 melted butter, and 1/2 cup of sugar

I ended up putting another cup of flour in my brownie mix for a total of two cups, four total eggs, two sticks of butter, and cut back to 10oz of white sugar and 5oz of cocoa powder. I can’t imagine what it’s like at the full amount of cocoa powder! I’d even say you could cut back to 4oz of cocoa powder and be OK. Very happy that this was the first brownie recipe I tried, I screwed up, but it still came out reasonably well. Thank you for sharing!

Delicious brownies! Very chewy (as promised) and rich. I had to tweak the measurements of the sugar, cocoa, and vanilla to get the flavor I wanted. I added  1/4 cup of sugar, and reduced the cocoa to 3/4 cup. I may have gone a bit crazy with the vanilla, but can you really have too much? Definitely the best brownie I've had in a while.

Chewy, dense, rich chocolate flavor. I loved these brownies.  Came out great. The second batch I left in the oven just a little too long and they were more like a cookie. Chewy or crunchy win win.

I followed the recipe based on the suggestions of others: Decreased the cocoa powder to 3/4C, decreased the sugar to 1 1/2C and increased the melted butter to 3/4C. This did not cook at all. The result was slightly formed brownie batter. The taste seems pretty good. Perhaps it needs baking powder? This is the only recipe I've tried that doesn't call for baking powder. Maybe that's the missing ingredient, but it did not cook.

Recipe as-is was not great for me. Brownies could barely hold their shape. Too much cocoa powder and sugar. Very far from what I would expect from a brownie.

I made these brownies as suggested first, OMG so good.  I had to cook closer to 40 minutes but so chewey and delicious.  I would recommend getting everything measured and ready and then melt the butter.  I would also recommend once butter is melted add it to the sugar first before anything else to get it smoother, but even if you don't it makes for a nice crust on top of the chewey.

This recipe tastes great. However, it is very sticky, which makes the batter hard to spread in a pan. The batter also was a bit to dry, so I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of milk, and it turned out great. Besides these minor issues, I highly recommend this recipe.

I only added 1/4  cup Coco powder instead of 1 cup and I only used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and no confectioners sugar for decoration and cooked for a little longer 

Turned out pretty good!

I added a cup of semisweet chocolate chips instead of sprinkling the brownies with icing sugar and they taste incredible! The top was nice and crinkly and the brownies where chewy goodness. This is my new go to brownie recipe.

Great recipe. I can't give it four stars, because I followed the adjustments recommended by other reviewers. 3/4 cup cocoa powder, 3/4 cup melted butter, 1 1/2 cup sugar. My husband also loves chocolate chunks, so I added 1 cup chocolate chips. Chocolate and more chocolate. I needed ice cream with mine.

Added less sugar (1 and 3/4 instead of 2) and it made a lot of good difference as the first time I made it was way too sweet but so good now! Whole family loves it

I followed the exact recipe, first of all the texture is not fluffy, chewy or airy. Second this took 10 minutes extra to bake but the inside still seems underbaked. The outside of the brownie was hard and very un chewy. Also the batter was just like cookie dough instead of it being thick and runny. I’m very sad I wasted my supplies on this. Overall it is too sweet, not chewy and I do not recommend this. Maybe changing the measurements might help.

Obviously I did something wrong, it's just the question as to what it was. I followed the recipe as it it said and didn't tweak anything, yet the batter didn't turn out like batter at all, it turned out like dough.

I made these tonight and they were perfect! Super chewy, chocolatey goodness! Prior to cooking, I read some of the other reviews, and made a couple alterations. I decreased the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup and the cocoa to 3/4 cup. In addition to the other listed ingredients I added 1/4 cup coconut oil. I only greased the pan, did not use wax paper. I’m at a very high elevation so they only needed about 27-28 mins on 300 degrees. I let them cool on a rack for 15 mins. Cut & served w/ confections sugar. Delicious and super easy! Will be making them often LOL

Yummy, chewy, and moist. Not cakey like other brownie recipes. I bake mine in an 8 1/2 by 8 1/2 glass pan at 350 degrees for 40 min.

These are VERY chocolatey. Too chocolatey for my taste. A little less cocoa powder and I'd probably like them. Texture was good.

This is exactly what i was looking for: chewy, chocolatey goodness.

I've made this recipe as written numderous times, and altered it with equal success. Tonight I'm using it as a base for a Mounds taste idea.

Good brownies if you decrease the sugar and cocoa like others suggested and add 1/4 cup vegetable oil.  But mine were 1/4 inch thick.  I will use an 8" square pan next time.

I tried this brownie recipe because I really wanted to make some good brownies. So far, the recipe has worked fine. The 30 minutes for me was a little too short, and mine have been in for 15 minutes more, so you should CHANGE THE TIME TO 40 MINUTES at least! The batter was extremely thick and very hard to stir, so be ready! The brownies were really good, and very chewy. They are very heavy, but extremely delectable

These brownies are good, but they took FOREVER to bake. The middle did not cook the brownies were just heated up batter. I will not make these again.

My family and I really liked the recipe but it took a while to get out of the pan because it was so thick and sticky. It also took a really long time to bake. In the end though, I think it was worth it! :)

I'm allergic to chocolate and eggs, so I used carob powder in place of cocoa, and tapioca gel in place of eggs. I think those substitutions, as they often do, necessitate some other adjustments. My brownies are delicious but even for fudgy style they're pretty wet- actually oily. That may have something to do with the carob chips I added, too. And the edges are caramel, quite chewy and hardening as the pan cools. It's good, but not ideal. Also the recipe calls for a 9x13 pan but next time I will be using a smaller pan or a doubled batch because they're about half an inch thick. 
I think next time I'll add fewer carob chips, and increase the flour by half. This batch is absolutely edible and gave me the brownie taste I was craving after seven allergic years without it, but as with most allergy baking it's going to take a few tries to get it right.

What I did was I used 1  1/2 cups of sugar, 3/4 cup of coco powder, 3/4 cup of butter all melted. When I was putting the mix into a 9 13 inch pan I was thinking that it was way too liitle dough and I considered switching pans. dont switch pans. It turned out really good and I added some chocolate chip and it made 24 brownies! I would totally make again. excellent recipe!

I made this based on all the good reviews and made the suggested changes from some other reviewers  (increased butter, decreased cocoa and sugar) but I did not like the taste and texture of these at all. To best describe them - if you have ever eaten one of those Little Debbie brownies then they are very similar - very dense and fudge like. As one other reviewer warned: if you like the cake type of brownies that you make from the boxed mixes, then these probably are not for you. My kids were able to eat them, but I won't be using this recipe again. Also, if you do go with this recipe I would suggest using a smaller pan and baking them a little longer, unless you like a very thin brownie.

Soft and Chewy! Probably one of the easiest brownies I have ever made. I had all the ingredients on hand as most  bakers would.  Rich and Decadent. I did not use the powder sugar to dust them since they were sweet enough.

This has a truly fabulous taste, but now I know I'm not one for a fudgy/chewy brownie.  This is a good recipe, and the second time I made it, I used the very same quantities of everything, with room temp eggs and butter.  It still ended up chewy but I think it baked better.  Using a fork, I creamed together the butter and sugar, then the eggs one at a time, then vanilla.  I mixed the rest of the ingredients together in a separate bowl, adding 1 teaspoon baking powder and 2 teaspoons baking soda, and then mixed it with the wet ingredients.  It was just as hard to mush into the pan, which I lined with parchment paper.   After cooling, the center was as flat as the first try, maybe a little bit grainy, but the sides and top were crisp and delicious.

I absolutely love this receipe, after a prior failed attempt using a different recipe. 

I made alterations to the recipe by reducing the cocoa to 3/4c. Also, I used 3/4c white sugar + 3/4c brown sugar. I added 1/4c of vegetable oil too. 

I mixed the dry and wet ingredients before combining into one single bowl. Instead of stirring the ingredients, I lightly folded the dry into the wet. 

As for oven time, I cooked for the suggested amount of time, and temperature, but found that brownies required addtl time, possibly due to the added oil. So, I added prox. 15mins, and upped the temp to 310 degrees. 

I baked my brownies in a small pyrex pan that I lightly greased with butter before adding the mixture. 

The brownies came out perfect. I had to contain myself from eating the whole batch at once.

I made these twice now and they are delicious!  My entire family is in love with them and I get numerous requests.  I do not modify the recipe at all as we love chocolate, but if this is your first time making these you should know that when the batter is all mixed up, its not just a thick batter, but about the consistency of a grainy play-doh.  to make it easier to mix consistently, I mix all the dry ingredients together, then add the eggs, butter, and vanilla, then the mixing with my electric hand mixer takes less than a minute.  When you put it in the pan, it does not spread out so I use a flexible spatula to push everything to the edges and even it out.  These are CHEWY brownies- almost tough (in a good way, IMO).  I will make these again, and also try it with the modifications a lot of other people are suggesting (less chocolate and flour, more butter) and compare to see which I like better, but I think these are amazing in their own right!  Also, they do come out super thin and do not rise, so if you like a thicker brownie, use a smaller pan and you'll probably have to increase the baking time

I love this brownie recipe. I make it for my roommates and teammates whenever they want a good moist chewy brownie. 
New bakers. Remember to not use an electric mixer to mix the brownie mix. It will make the brownies cakey. Instead use a fork to mix all of the ingredients and then a rubber spatula.

It didn't cook.  It just remained a wet mix. I went ahead and plopped the one big lump of chocolate mix into the pan and gave a go. It was pretty much the same as when I put it in the pan.  Wet. It was a good mushy mix to eat.  **UPDATE** I did put some in a mug and placed it in the microwave.  It def cooked in the microwave.  I think maybe 300 degrees is just too low of a temp.  I recommend 350.

3 stars only because they were way too sweet before I made adjustments! 1 1/4 cup sugar not 2. They sugar didn't even dissolve the first time. We just crunched on it. But they were the best brownies the second time!

These are phenomenal. Super moist and chewy. I did however decrease the cocoa powder to 3/4 cup and the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I only used 1 stick of butter and added 1/4 cup of oil. PERFECTION!!!

I am really upset because I don't like fudge brownies and I wanted brownies that were gooey and chewy (like advertised). However this was not the case and I spent my time and money into a brownie I did not enjoy at all. Way too sugary and dense. Find another recipe.

I love these brownies. When the recipe is followed as written, they're very good, but a bit too sweet. When I simply reduced the sugar, that of course produced somewhat drier, less chewy brownies. After tweaking and testing the recipe a couple of times, I find decreasing the sugar by half a cup, as well as adding a quarter cup of vegetable oil, makes them chewy and perfectly chocolatey for a dark chocolate lover like myself.

I am glad I read the reviews before I made these. As suggested I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2Cup, decreased the cocoa powder to 1/2cup and also added1/2cup of melted chocolate, and I added 1/4th cup of butter and 1/4th cup of oil. I added a bit of oil because I thought the batter would turn out crumbly and dry and I was right because with the addition of a bit more of oil the batter was not very dry and not very wet and just right. 

I also added a splash of strong coffee about 1-2 tablespoons worth and a dash of cayenne pepper powder. I usually add the coffee but this was my first time adding cayenne powder and it turned out great! 

I think I have found the perfect recipe with just a little bit of tweak here and there and I will be making it often.

I used this recipe to make brownie cups.  I patted these into 18 well greased muffin tins and baked at 350 for 22 minutes.  They came out perfectly.  Add a scoop of ice cream, chocolate sauce and a cherry and you have a decadent brownie sundae that is beautiful and yummy.   It was a hit with my kids and pretty enough for guests.  This recipe lives up to the "chewy" part.  And its also really chocolatey.  I cut back on cocoa powder, as suggested, and added flour so that the dry ingredients stayed at 2 cups.   I did not cut back on the sugar, but should have.  They were super sweet.   That's why I could only give it 4 stars.   I'm not sure these  would make good stand-alone brownies, but this recipe was perfect for my use.

I was not impressed with these brownies. They were dense and dry and way too thin. If you do make them, use an 8 X 8 pan, although I'd suggest you try a different recipe.

These came out exactly how we all like our brownies: chewy and fudgy! My only problem with them is that they didn't want to come out of the pan in neat squares, but who cares how they look when they taste great?

It took longer to cook. I had to raise the temperature to 325 just to get the center to cook which made the edges hard. I will try this again because the flavor was good.

I've been looking for a recipe like this for years. It's so hard to find a true chewy brownie recipe. Not cake like at all. Thank goodness!!  I followed Matt's (below) directions exactly and they came out beautifully. Next time, I'll add a few nuts to the top before baking. Thanks for posting, Krissy!

Delicious!  I followed the advice in some of the reviews and did 3/4 C cocoa and 1.5C sugar.  I thought they made the perfect amount for a 9/13in pan, baked up nicely, and tasted great!  They are even chewier the next day!  (I would not follow what some suggested about adding oil, 2 sticks of butter was plenty!) Great brownies!  My husband loved them too!

Tried w 3/4c cocoa & 1 1/2c sugar, the 1/2c butter & added 1/4c oil, same 1c flour, same 1/4t salt, same 2 eggs.  I melted the butter.  Whisked in the sugar.  Added the oil & heated just a little.  Added vanilla then the cocoa.  Then eggs, & flour w salt.  9x11@300 for 30 - or 36 :/  I tested & took out when still sticky but not wet on the toothpick.  These are just a little dark.  Not all that chewy, surprisingly enough; but good.  The wax paper is very necessasary - & grease it.  I took them out - paper on - & had to peel it off.  No way could I cut them from the dish.  Much of the edges still stuck.   These have what looks like one of those mixes with the onion paper top, but it's firm, not papery.  I served mine upside down since the bottom looks more brownie/fudgelike.  'Better than absolutely best, but not "it".  :/  :)  KK & J liked a lot.  No surprise.  :D  "Track 29" brownies w jelly beans on top.

I couldn't wait to try these brownies! They smelled so good. Saddly my oven runs too hot and they were over cooked and started to crumble! :( 
I do agree with others that maybe you can less cocoa and sugar. But I will try this recipe again!

great tasting brownies.Based off the previous reviews I did reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups & reduce the cocoa to 1/2 a cup. I used 8x8 pan size so had to cook them about 15 minutes longer. turned out great

I made the brownies as directed with the addition of a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. They were very thin and probably could have baked in a small pan. They were super chocolate-y and chewy on the edges. I may try subbing some of the butter with applesauce next time, so that they are slightly less greasy, but otherwise they were very good.

These were great! Had the fudgy texture I was hoping for eventhough I overcooked them a little. Really nice chocolate flavour, I reduced the cocoa just a bit (about 2 tbsps) and increased the butter by a smidge (a tbsp or two). Think I will try it exactly as written next time. Oh, I also stirred in a few chocolate chips. I baked them in a muffin pan to make individual brownies which I topped with icecream and caramel sauce. There were no leftovers!

These are totally fudgy, moist, and rich, and that's exactly what I was looking for.  If you're looking for a cakey brownie you should keep looking because these turn out exactly as advertised and they're definitely not cakey.  I think they taste great, thanks!

This tastes AMAZING it's chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. My whole family loves this.  All I have to say is that you should use 1/2 cup of cocoa and 1 1/2 cup of sugar.

I made this exactly as instructed and I wouldn't change a thing.  I line the pan with wax paper and place the brownie on a countertop after cooling about 20 minutes.  A long thin knife will separate the brownie from the wax paper.  Don't even try to lift the brownie out of the pan.  It won't work.  Extremely chocolaty, very dense, rich and gooey- just like I like them.  Not anything like a boxed recipe though those are good too.  I did add one extra egg since mine tend to be small (fresh farm eggs).

Very very rich and chocolate like, reminded me of a brownie you get as a sundae in a restaurant. I added some chocolate chips and pecans to mine, I couldn't find any walnuts. I shorten my cooking time sometimes to 20mins instead of 30. Once cooled they harden nicely and all it takes is 20seconds in the microwave to make them warm and lovely again.

Okay, I have now found the best ever brownie recipe.  This brownie is very, very chocolaty, and has the texture I've always been looking for, CHEWIE!  I've always preferred the edges and this came out like one big edge yet not burned or over done.  I only made half a batch to try and baked it in an 8x8 pan.  I did add 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/3 cup walnuts per half batch.  Everything else was done exactly like the recipe.  I will never use another brownie recipe.  Thank you so much for posting this.

Not bad at all :) I did change this recipe a bit, went with 3/4 cups cocoa and 1/4 cup vegetable oil. Also reduced sugar to 1 cup and added half a cup of splenda (I'm diabetic but it's so hard to find a decent brownie recipe that doesn't have sugar so generally I just reduce) Creamed the butter and beat in the sugar/splenda until it was fluffy, gradually added the flour, beating after each addition then added the cocoa, alternating with the oil. I think the splenda made the batter a little easier to work with, it wasn't as sticky or hard to spread that other reviews have suggested. Lined the pan with parchment paper (made it ~so~ much easier to lift out of the pan!) baked for time suggested.  They came out quite nice, very chocolatey, very chewy, didn't have that nice crispy top that I like but I would still definetly make these again :)

REALLY GOOD!! Chewy and all. Last time I made some the ends were a bit dry but I spread it a bit too much(thinned) and my non-stick pan is too big for the recipe(I didn't have enough butter to double it...). I'm making another batch right now and I'm going to add a couple of chocolate chips on them for a simple chocolate frosting. My boyfriend loves them(and he's pretty picky! :P

Very good brownie... Per other reviewers I used 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup cocoa powder. They are very chewy and yummy. Another great thing about them is that they are low in calories and you cannot even tell. I have made other low fat brownie recipes and you can look at them and thell they are low fat, they also taste low fat. This is NOT the case with these, I will keep this recipe in my favorites pile..

Really good brownies! Just made them on account of being snowed in with very few ingredients! They're wonderful with ice-cream.  The only concern that I had was the size of the pan. Given the amount of mixture in the bowl, it wasn't enough to evenly coat the 9x13. I opted for an 8x8 and it worked fine. Used my hands to spread the mixture out evenly.  Awesome recipe!

I cant make brownies.  I dont know why, but they never turn out.  HOWEVER these brownies were the easiest, best brownies to make ever.  This will be THE recipe for me from now on.  I used Hershey Special Dark Cocoa and cut it like the other reviewers suggested.  YUMMY!!!!  My first 5 star review.

I was pleasantly surprised by these brownies!  I came across these while looking for a lower fat brownie.  Just as a note I did decrease the cocoa powder to 3/4 cup and decreased the sugar to 1 cup and a half.  At first I was concerned because the batter tasted a bit overpowered by the cocoa.  I did bake these in a smaller pan than the recipe required but they were definitely done within a half hour with no problem.  These brownies were the right consistency, chewy yet not too dense.  I think next time though I will decrease the cocoa a bit as they are still quite powerful.

These tasted pretty good and I didn't change a thing. They were chewy, but also a bit grainy. Next time I will use a darker, more smoothe chocolate and see if that makes a difference.

I made these with the following changes: decreased sugar to 1 cup and baked them in an 11x7 pan and baked for 41 minutes. The texture was perfect! I will make again but I will decrease cocoa...it was a little too strong. Great, fudgy texture.

So yummy. very chewy and good. I listened to others reviews and used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 3/4 cups of cocoa. When i took them out of the oven they were still very soft so i left them sit on the counter for a bit then in the  fridge and they hardened up. perfect little brownies

I made a change in this, but only with the cocoa powder, I used a mix of 3 cocoas that would be a dark blend. I used the brownies to make an ice cream sandwiches for a sanctioned contest. this took first place

DELICIOUS!!! We brought the cocoa powder down to 1/2 cup, and the sugar down to a cup. Also added a cup of dark chocolate chips (coated in flour first to keep them from sinking to the bottom of the pan), and then sprinkled dark chocolate chips over the top (about 1/2 cup) while the brownies were still warm, then spread them with a spatula once they had melted some. We also only cooked them for 25 minutes and they were perfect (probably because they are so thin in the bigger pan).

So as I sit here waiting for my brownies to come out I just had to review this recipe. It looks so good, but I did make just a couple of changes. I made 1 1/2 of the amount, because I noticed just 1 batch was a bit thin, and I also added peanut butter in-between the layers. I did this by putting half my mixture down, dropping peanut butter on each of my brownie squares, and then putting the rest of the mixture on top. This is a little difficult to do because its so thick but if you take the batter and flatten it out either on your spatula or on parchment paper and then lay it down on top of the peanut butter. Then add more on top and swirl! Looks great, thanks for the recipe. :D

Tastes so good! I did use less sugar, more butter and a bit of milk as was suggested. Hard to cut up but completely worth it.

This is the worst Brownies Recipe ever. When mixing, so so very very DRY. You can tell right away, when mixing and tasting these brownies will be dry and gritty from the sugar. The cooked slightly around the edges, and NO COOKING, in the middle for 30 min. GRITTY GRITTY GRITTY. NASTY NASTY NASTY. Don't waste your ingredients. Save your butter, and eat another recipe.

Really good! it only filled about a 9by 9 inch square of the recommended tin, bit it spread out during cooking. Gooey and delicious, though did stick to baking parchment. I made it with melted butter as opposed to oil, very luxurious.

I thought that this recipe was so easy to make. It truly was very chewy and soft. It was a big hit at my school bake sale. But i would have to say that there was too much sugar and it made it alitte bit granny.

This recipe always turn out good but it looks like it turns out better if I mix everything very quickly by hand, not mixer. I refer to reviewers' suggestions for amount of ingredients but stick to the original recipe for cooking temperature. After several attempts, for me it's best to bake it at 150 degree Celcius for 30 minutes. I used to get unbaked piece in the center. So I try to fill up the edge of the pan with the batter first and then work its way to the center. This way, the brownies get moist texture more evenly and less unbaked center. I cut the brownies into squares only after it sits for at least 3 hours or overnight.

These brownies were great! I made the revisions that the other posters suggested and baked mine in a 9x9 pan at 325 for about 30-35 minutes.  I also added about 6 oz. milk chocolate chips.  They were even better the second day, not dry at all.

The 3 stars are only because they tasted ok but other than that, I did not like this recipe.  The mixture is a mess, very sticky.  They came out very flat and they crumble easily after the first day.

I followed this recipe exactly, but when I took them out of the oven, they had a baked look on top and gooey mess underneath.  I actually had to put them back in the oven for an extra 20 minutes.  The first day they were fine, they are very sweet and chocolaty.  They did break apart easily though.  The second day they were hard and crunchy on the top and chewy underneath.  Next time I'll try the others suggestions.

I loved these!! I was having trouble finding a good brownie that wasn't cakey. I prefer chewy and very rich brownies.  I added about 1/4 cup vegetable oil and threw in some chocolate chips. The oil helped with how crumby the original mix was and contributed to the chewy texture. I was very happy. The one thing I didn't do is use the paper lining in the pan and it made it impossible to get out of the pan neatly. So definitely don't skip that part! Awesome recipe though.

This is a very good brownie recipe. Don't worry if it seems underdone after coming out of the oven. My mother said that means they are just fresh from the oven. And they are not as "gooey" when they air after a while. I added a bit of milk to make the batter creamy. The brownies turned out well and everyone in my family liked them.

Awesome recipe.  I did some modifications others talked about here - 1/4 cup oil, and less sugar (I used 1 1/3 cup).  But I also used a 9"X9" pan with a heaping cup of flour, and that seemed to clear up the problem of too-thin brownies.

These were just not as good as people mentioned.  Too much chocolate, to thin in the 9x13, too moist.  I baked it at 350 for 27 min because I live in CO so I changed the temp but still turned out wet.  I wont be making this recipe again.  A waste.

Unfortunately this didn't work for me.  It was way to crumbly and a little too chocolaty for my taste.  I really should have read the reviews and made the recommended adjustments.  I may give this one more shot, (with revisions).  :(

This is now our family brownie recipe.  I only use 3/4 C cocoa and 1 3/4 C sugar and it comes out perfect!  Be sure to only cook for the time indicated.  I forgot about it one time and overcooked it by just a few minutes and we had hard-as-a-rock brownies after they cooled.

GREAT recipe! I did however change it up a bit by using only one cup of brown sugar, but adding 1/4 cup of honey. Also, I added about 1/4 cup of milk. Extremely chewy and decadent!

i cant really rate this as i didnt really follow the measurements. i did follow the ingredient ideas but i followed the advices from all the ppl from the reviews and tweak it a little more. with this new recipe, i didnt have a hard time with the batter. 
what i changed :
1. i only used 1 cup sugar
2. used 3 eggs (medium... i think)
3. added 1/4cups of vege oil
4. thrown in a small fistful of choco chips just before baking
5. i used a 8" round pan... 160C for 30 mins... but i think 25-27 mins should be better for even chewier brownies.
6. the eggs were lightly beaten before mixing into the melted butter
7. mixed all the wet ingredient first then fold into the mixed dried ingredient

my brother loves it! he said it is nicer than the one sold in his office cafe! wat a great review for my first time baking a brownie after searching so long for a really chewie brownie recipe!

and it was very quick too! the whole process plus the baking time and cleaning up took me around 1 hour or so. and it is really very little to clean up considering no need to use the mixer etc.

be warned! it is reall ADDICTIVE!!! i ate 1/4 of the brownies 30 mins after baking!!

Very chewy and moist. I used 3/4 cup cocoa powder and 1.5 cups sugar and 3/4 cup butter as suggested by others. First off I melted the butter then combine the rest of the ingredients, stirred with a spatula. This is a great chewy recipe especially if you wait for it to cool.

This recipe was very good.  Although I did not have any cocoa powder, so i used hot chocolate instead and the consistancy was a little thick and dry---so I also added a teaspoon of milk---which made it take VERY LONG to cook, although the milk made it taste better i would not suggest adding it in.

The brownies turned out excellent. I added a pinch of cinnamon and a squirt of chocolate syrup. They're a delicious, fudgy brownie. Will definitely make again!

It was a tasty brownie, but certainly nothing special to look at.  It reminded me so much in taste, texture and appearance of a boxed brownie, that in my opinion, you may as well just save yourself a few steps/ingredients and make the box mix.

Good brownie recipe if you like 'em really chewy!  Other than adding butterscotch chips, I followed the recipe to a T and they came out very yummy. :)  The only thing I'd consider changing next time is doubling the ingredients as the batter didn't quite fill out the pan.  Overall a good brownie recipe though!

Definitely not good.  They looked exactly like the lumpy batter when baked. The batter definitely does not spread out into a 9x13 inch pan.  They come out way too thin.  These are NOT brownies.

If you're looking for something rich and chocolatey then this fits the bill. I thought that the texture was almost like a cookie- it was definitely different. This won't be my "go to" recipe but I usually have the ingredients on hand so it would do in a pinch.

This recipe should really call for 3 extra large eggs. When I added 3 large eggs it quickly became apparent that it needed a 4th as the mixture was simply too dry. Turned out absolutely perfect.

I also used dark chocolate cocoa powder and baked it with dark chocolate chips sprinkled on top.

I cooked it in silicone bake ware which usually bakes at a faster rate than most pans. That wasn't the case with this recipe. It needed almost the full time specified.

These brownies were awesome!!!! Very rich tho but sooo good!  I used 3/4C of cocoa and 1/2C of oil like someone else had mentionned and 1 1/3C of sugar and they are perfect (probably could have done with 1C of sugar)  I can see how people didnt like the texture and i can see how it would be hard for dessert plates at a dinner party but for home and for people who dont care what it looks like.. Fab!!!! Id definately make this again! Oh and i added some walnuts too and they worked out!

Not a fan....These brownies were way to thick to spread in pan and way to chocolatly and gritty for our liking.  Maybe a little less chocolate powder would work better.

DECADENT!!!!The only changes I made was to use a 9x7x2 inch pan sprayed with Pam and I reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cup. Baked an additional 15-20 minutes because of pan size. A definite keeper, delicious, the best I ever made!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't imagine how good these will be tonight with vanilla ice cream :P YUMMMMMM!

Hrm...not digging this recipe. I wanted to like it, maybe I should have cooked mine longer but I followed the 30 min rule. When I took them out I let them cool about an hour or so, and cut into them. They tasted like pure batter, def chewy but almost TOO chewy since it was literally smooshy. Maybe if they would have cookied longer theyd be ok, but Im not sure I dug the taste either. Blah!

Big mistake.  These brownies came out a big mess in the pan and the taste wasn't even enough to compensate for the horrendous texture.

Wow. This should be renamed "Chocolate Sin". I halved the recipe, and put it in a 9" pie plate (adding an extra tablespoon or two of ghiradelli cocoa powder). Be aware, you MUST like a strong dark cocoa flavor, or you will not like these. However, for all you dark chocolate addicts, you will find it difficult not to eat the whole plate. Very dense and rich. Just be careful of overcooking, as they dry out very quickly if baked too long.

I made this recipe as written, but I can't help thinking I did something wrong because the brownies turned out awful! Was uncooked  and had a grainy sugar texture. Even the hungry boys wouldn't touch it. I won't be making this again.

I thought this was okay. I had to broil and spread some semisweet chips on top to make it fudgier tasting to me. I did decrease sugar and cocoa as suggested by other reviewers, so maybe had I done the recipe as stated it would've been better?
I will stick with the Texas Sheet Cake II off this site - tastes just like I think a brownie should!

I'm not sure about this recipe.  Made as directed, I thought they were too chocolatey and a little too sweet.  Tried it again cutting back to 3/4 c. cocoa and 1 1/2 c. sugar, used l/2 oil, 1/2 butter.  Baked for the same amount
of time and they are hard.  Will used as a base for 'Death by Chocolate'

My problem could be that I used "lite" butter instead of regular. but these were not very good.  I had a REALLY hard time spreading these into my 9x13 and when they were done, they were only about 1cm thick.  The flavor is so-so, and the texture could be creamier (mine came out a little grainy/gritty.)  I hope you have better results with these than I did!

This recipe turns out brownies that are almost identical to packages brownie mix.  They were easy to make and just as the recipe implies--chewy.  I will be adding this recipe to my personal recipe file.

Too bad for the one who didn't enjoy this recipe!!! My son loves brownie especially the chewiest one. The first time I tired this recipe a few months ago, my son kept asking me to bake it again. This week, I've already baked three batches and I am going to bake another one tomorrow for my friend's birthday party. I will definitely continue using this recipe as the taste is really great.  The only thing I didn't follow the recipe is that I baked mine in 9 x 9 tray and the baking time is 70 minutes. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

Ohh.. lovely brownies.. me and my husband both loved it. A little bit too sweet so u might wanna cut down the sugar. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Next time I'll just use ½ of each sugar. I made this brownies together with Best Brownies and applied frosting on both.

This recipe is excellenty chewy and fudgy.  It has a tendency to be more fudgy and soft than desired in the middle of the pan, but it doesn't detract from the delicious taste.  On a recent experimentation, I scooped the brownie batter into greased mini-muffin tins, and I ended up with awesome chewy "two-bite brownies".

I have won contests with these brownies.  It will be very think and grainy, but will desepate once cooked.  I add 1/2 cup semi-sweetchocoalte chips at the end.  I also cook an extra 5 to 10 minutes.  These will be chewy and gooey as indicated, but good.

Either I did something wrong (I triple checked the recipe) or these are simply worst looking brownies I have ever made.  While they took care of my chocolate craving I would never serve these to anyone.  Don't waste your time and ingredients, there are better recipes out there (see "Deep Dish Brownies").

I think the baking time, as notated in this recipe, is definetly incorrect.  The brownies required an additional 40 minutes to bake!  My oven was pre-heated and I confirmed it was operating at an accurate temperature. The final result was pretty good, but there is definetly an error in the cooking time or perhaps the temperature should have been increased to 400 degrees to achieve doneness in the indicated bake time.

This makes a great VERY chocolatey brownie.  I followed the advice of several other posters and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I wish I would have left it in.  I also added a little less than 1/4 of a cup of oil.  I'll definately be making this again but next time I'll use the original amount of sugar.

I was looking for something that resembled the Betty Crocker brownie.  The top of the brownie had all the sugar.  I was dissappointed.

Made one batch over the weekend with some modifications, added a quarter cup each of cooking oil and cake flour and a third cup of crunchy peanut butter.  Turned out beautiful, gone in no time.  Will make again tomorrow for a picnic dinner for an outdoor starlight movies on Friday night. Naz in Malaysia

WOW. these are definitely the chewiest, fudgiest brownies ... but the recipe itself only gets 4*. maybe my eggs were too small, but the "batter" i ended up with at first more closely resembled coarse crumbs ... i added some plain, lowfat yogurt and the texture was perfect. i baked these in a 9" round pan and had to keep them in the oven almost an hour. with some chopped pecans, these are perfect brownies!!

REALLY GOOD!  I've made them twice and the first time they were everything i think a brownie should be (chewy, fudgy, chocolatey--not cakey AT ALL) but the second time I was running low on flour and overcooked them as well,  Then it was the same problem as a prior poster, very hard after a couple hours.  But the first batch was enough to earn this recipe 5 stars

This recipe was great. Both my Dad and I love chewy brownies, and these were by far the chewiest. The batter came out so thick, not liquidy like boxed brownie mix. They were a real hit and I think I may go make some more......

I baked these "as is" in a 13x9 pan, they were very thin but cooked through in 30 min at 300 deg F.  The only change I made was to use cooking spray on the pan instead of the parchment.  They came out of the pan fine.  The only problem I had was that the brownies got pretty dry and hard the day after baking them.

These are definitely chewy! I found them too doughy for my liking- I have not tried the "Best Brownies" recipe yet, but I have tried the "Deep Dish Brownies" recipe- and I like that better, but that is just me! My fav. brownie recipe used to always be the original HERSHEY'S QUICK N' EASY FUDGY BROWNIES recipe. Good luck with your brownie making!

These definitely satisfied my craving for a chewy brownie! They are rich are fudgy and hard to stop eating.  But I did find them a bit too sweet, and next time I think I'll cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I'll also follow other reviewers' advice to use a smaller pan.  But I'll be making these again for sure!

I made the full recipe,baked it in a 9x9 pan, and they are delicious.  I put frosting on too.  They are very sweet and chewy and chocolaty and I love them.  Good for those chocolate cravings.

To die for Choclatey!  Very easy to make and rich.  My 5 year old loves to make these with me and they are gone by the next day.  I also cut back the sugar and bake in a 9 X 9 pan.

What a GREAT tasting brownie.(yum-yum).I will make them again and again.I used a 9"x9"pan and they were just the right thickness for a brownie.
I made chocolate icing and spread it over the brownies right out of the oven.My 4 kids just love them,they don't last long in my house.

This a very good, but not excellent recipe. Very easy to make with a lot of chocolate taste.  I agree with most reviewers to NOT use a 9X13 pan.  I used a much smaller one and it made 1" brownies. I did cut sugar a bit and added a touch of peanut butter.   They are a bit grainy, but tasty.

Have you heard the song... "Sugar, Sugar, bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-pa oh honey, honey".  Lots-O-Sugar, I will try these again with a little less sugar.  They were good the first day but hardened up.  Maybe I didn't follow the recipe right, it's worth another try.

I have been searching for a chewy brownie recipe for a long time and this is the best so far!  I made them exactly like the recipe said and they were great!

I tried this twice in one night, once in the 9x13, which was way to thin and hard, then in a 9x9 which took forever to cook, but worked a little better...I reccomend using a smaller pan...

Wonderful chocolatey flavour, but a bit sugary for my taste. Best eaten while still warm.

Very good flavor. I substituted fructose for the sugar and it made more cake like but the flavor was very good.

I agree with the other rating - the pan size is wrong, unless the brownies are supposed to be 1/4 inch high!  But they taste great.
