These are so good! You have to use the "bite size" candies, not the fun size ones that the recipe calls for.  I used snickers and everybody loved them! :)

These are so good! My son said "best cookies EVER"!! The dough itself is really nice, and complements the candy bar pieces very well. I refrigerated the dough between batches since it was fairly soft and greasy with all the pb and butter, and it helped when shaping it around the mini size bars (very important to use mini NOT fun size). I used a bag of mixed snickers (regular, dark chocolate and almond) which was fun so they'd all be a little different. Also make sure to bake only 13 minutes the first batch and check, 13 minutes was PERFECT for my oven, lightly browned and they firmed up while they cooled on the cookie sheet - I did my first batch at 15 minutes and they were crunchy when they cooled and browner than I wanted. The interesting thing I noted between the 2 batches is that 15 minutes the candy bars melt completely into the cookie, at 13 minutes some of the candy bars still held their shape so the cookies were more lumpy and have more solid candy bar pieces in them when cooled. Neither way is necessarily better, I just thought that was interesting to note. These are super yummy and fun to make and eat, will definitely use again!!

I made these cookies as part of our assorted cookie plates for Christmas.  The bite size Milky Ways do work better.  We also used Rolo candies and rolled half the ball in sugar. Both were BIG hits.

I used the Nestle Treasures because I could not get the bite sized milky ways.  I then sent them to a friend of mine in the Navy in a tupperware container. He recieved them a week later and told me that the sailors he works with all want the recipe!  It is hard to find cookies that stay fresh when you don't know when the delivery date is going to be, guess these pass the test.  They ate em up right away.

I just noticed I have never left a rating for these cookies! I've made them several times and they always impress people. I use Mars bars, and I also made them into non-PB cookies a couple of times for bake sales when we were asked not to use nut products. Thanks for the fabulous idea!

These were the biggest waste of a perfectly good candy bar.  Plus, the recipes was not well written.  It said to use fun size candy bars and cover them with a heaping teaspoon of dough.  It took a lot more dough than that to cover them.

Very good recipe - the cookies were chewy - I baked them for about 15 minutes. Instead of Milky Way bars I used Hershey Kisses- the combination is great!  I did not wrap the kisses in the dough.  At the end of the 15 minutes I pulled the cookies out and pushed a kiss into the cookie.  The kiss settles into the cookie as it cools.  These were really good!

I usually prefer cookies warm from the oven and don't care for them once they've cooled.  These are an exception.  Although they are good warm from the oven, they're much better once they've cooled completely and the candy has set.  I followed the recipe exactly (okay, I may have added a smidge more peanut butter!) and ended up with just over two dozen cookies.  I used miniature Snickers, but I'm sure these would be good with Milky Way too.

These are great!  My kids and I have really enjoyed them.  I made the cookie dough per the recipe, but I used the fun size candy bars instead.  The dough was just enough to cover all of the candy bars that came in the package.  I also, put popsicle sticks into the bar lengthwise before I wrapped the dough around them.  The kids get a kick out of the unique way to eat a  very good cookie!  We'll definitely put this one in the recipe box to try again.  Thank you!

I made these exactly as stated and they were awesome.  The peanut butter cookie was so tender that I might make someday without the candy. Very easy.  Gone in minutes.

Nice idea but the Milky Way gets hard (compared to the cookie), not chewy.  Also, don't use fun size, use the bite size candy.  Cookie w/o the candy is one of the best though.

I've loved this recipe for years. I add a generous dash of ground clove, nutmeg and cin for extra holiday bite in the batter, then I roll the balls in a sugar/cin mixture before baking. Rolo's seem to work the best for a smaller cookie, but you can really use anything. Today I substituted half the flour for almost flour (ground almost - you can make it in a blender or coffee bean grinder). Always a hit!

This rating is from my daughter. I made this without peanut butter and used rolo's. It's so easy to cover the rolos with the soft batter when using a tablespoon size cookie scooper; just scoop, insert a rolo candy in the center, fold up the sides making sure that the rolo is completely covered, and then drop.

Very good recipe.  I make a snicker cookie just like this one.  They are very similar.  Try putting a mini snicker inside.  OUTSTANDING!!  I also drizzle chocolate over the top of mine, make them very gourmet.

Yummy! My cookies retained their shape nicely, and the candy bar in the middle was nice and gooey! I only had king size bars, so I sliced them into 3/4 inch slices. When they were done baking, they still looked a little drab...so I melted another large milky way bar with a pat of butter (50% power in microwave) until smooth and then put a dollop on top of each cookie (like frosting)....mmmmm! the perfect touch! I'm looking forward to trying different candy bars inside this yummy recipe after the kids get their trick-or-treating stash!

I wasn't the hugest fan of this recipe.  I used the fun size and I expected them to melt into the cookie and produce this delicious gooey thing.  Instead they sort of flattened, but were just this hunk of caramel in the middle of the cookie, which I found slightly unappetizing.  They tasted alright, but didn't fit my bill.

Excellent cookies! Definitely need to use BITE size, not fun size! Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I used Milky Way in some, baking apple caramels in others. Both excellent!

I made these cookies for a party one time, and everyone loved them! 
Next time I made a double batch, and all the cookies were gone within 3 hours!
The candy & peanut butter cookie is the BEST combination ever!

These really are wonderful cookies.  Soft and the centers are nice and chewy!  They disappear very quickly!  Make two batches!
