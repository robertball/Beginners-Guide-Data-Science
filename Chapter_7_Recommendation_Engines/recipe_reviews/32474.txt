This couldn't be simpler.  Really any kind of juice will work.  I made it with White cranberry apple juice for my daughter's first birthday party.  There was none left over.  I went with the White cranberry to be practical.  However, if you are making for an adult party, I would recommend going with the regular juice for color.

This is always gone at any party I use it for.  I have tried this several time swith different kids of juices (per the advice of Navy Mommy), and it really does work with any kind of juice.  I do like some better than others, but all turn out well.  Thanks for the post.

This punch made quite a hit at a party I gave.  I made extra and froze it in a rubber star mold.  After it was frozen, I popped it into the punch.  Better than ice-cubes which serve only to dilute it and better than using a rubber glove as shown in the picture.....unless you are using it for a Halloween party.
