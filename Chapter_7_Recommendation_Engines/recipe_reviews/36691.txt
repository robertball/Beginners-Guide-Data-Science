My wife and I really enjoyed this Minestrone recipe.  The preparation was a breeze and it created such an enticing aroma while it was cooking.  I would defintely recommend this to anyone who likes a good hearty stew.

We did make a few minor alterations to the original recipe...I added some minced garlic, italian spice and cracked pepper to the dutch oven as it cooked.  It was excellent!!!

Very tasty, and so easy to make too!  I substituted stew beef for ground round and added a can of tomato paste and some pepper, italian seasoning, and grated parmesan.  I will make this one again for sure.

Very tasty, quick and easy to make. I make this soup at least once a month during the winter. I sometimes substiute lean ground turkey and no one notices a difference in the taste. I always substitute lowfat beef broth for the water. Usually serve this with crusty Italian bread or corn bread. I often double the recipe so that I can freeze some, but when I do I leave out the pasta since it tends to become mushy. I add the pasta when I get ready to reheat and serve.

This minestrone is very easy to make.  It is also very delicious if you like spinach (which my husband and I do).  It is good if you let it cook a little bit longer on low like a sauce or chili.  This dish is very tasty and nutritious.  I will definitely make this dish again.

Great recipe. Easy to make, tastes great. I added more macaroni to fill the soup up. The sourdough bread dipped in it was fabulous. I'll be making this again!

Excellent flavor - does not taste like 'packaged' soup. Ground turkey works great too. One of our favorite cold night meals... with a crusty bread

I don't know if I didn't have the correct Minestrone mix or what but it was not the best.

Sorry to disagree with everyone, but this was not impressive!  All I could taste was the packaged mix. (maybe I used a bad one?)  I also did not add tomatoes, as I discovered too late that I had none - I'm giving this three stars because maybe it would have been a lot better with tomatoes.  My husband said it wasn't bad, but he'll eat anything (sorry!!)

This creates a wonderful smell in your house while cooking. 
I accidently put too much pasta in this recipe and so it sucked up all of the soup. It became more of a pasta dish than a soup, but it was still very tasty and filling.
I added fresh garlic, salt, and ground pepper while cooking. Next time I'm going to add italian seasoning to give some extra flavor.
Very nice.

This is a great recipe, now a family favorite.  I do want to note that I kick it up with chicken broth, seasoning, garlic and most importantly some Parmesan/Romano cheese. Otherwise, its a little plain, but still deserves 5 stars.
