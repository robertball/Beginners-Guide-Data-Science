One of my husband's favorite sandwiches is meatball subs. Therefore, I decided to find a recipe and surprise him. After one bite, he said that it was the best meatball sub that he had ever had.  I did make one major adjustment and that was substituting ground turkey for the ground beef called for in the recipe. He raved about this sandwich for the rest of the night. He pointed out that the only thing that would have made it better was cheese on top of the sandwich (which of course is just his personal preference).   I followed this recipe to the letter, and it is perfect as is. Also, a really nice side that goes with this sandwich is cheese and bacon baked fries. I cut up three medium sized potatoes, drizzled olive oil over them and sprinkled with salt, garlic powder and pepper. I added a handful of chopped onions and green peppers and baked it @ 425 for 25 minutes. Lastly, I added mixed cheeses (cheddar and mozzarella) and bacon and popped it back in the oven for 5-7 minutes (until the cheese melts).  I would definitely recommend this for a Saturday afternoon lunch that is fun for the kids (all kids must love meatballs) or during a football game.

Very good meal sandwich (not a lunch thing unless you're REAL hungry).  I will definitely double the sauce next time as others have suggested.  It was VERY good and there just wasn't enough.  We used wheat sub rolls as we prefer wheat bread.....tasted great!

We really liked this recipe and will make it again.  I will make the meatballs smaller next time, as they were so big, they fell out of the sandwich making the meal very messy.  But the flavor was nice.  I added a dash of worcestershire, red wine vinegar, and soy sauce to the sauce.  I also used 2/3 a cup of rolled oats in the meatballs rather than hollowing out the bread (it just seamed easier to me.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

We loved this recipe.  I liked it because it was simple and quick to prepare.  I made a few changes.  It doubled it and it still worked well.  I used finely chopped garlic in the meatballs and in the sauce.  This is a definite repeat meal.

Very good.  Very messy! But aren't bbq sandwiches supposed to be messy?  :)   We just kept eating more, even though we were stuffed.  Added swiss cheese to my sandwich which was excellent, but it would have been good even without the cheese!

Love the sauce, but agree you need to at least double it.

I did this tonight and we all loved it!  And I didn't even have any onions! I didn't want to serve it on sub bread so I made some buttered noodles and served them over that.  I'm going to double the sauce next time since it was delicious and we wanted more:)
