This is absolutely one of the best things I have ever eaten hands down!! I added Portabella mushrooms, a 1/2 c. frozen spinach, some extra garlic salt, and Grated Asiago, Parmesan and Ramano Cheese Mixture to the Cream sauce.  This tastes like an Olive Garden dish!!

This recipe was very good and VERY filling. We added a small red onion thinly slighted.

Will be making it again but will need to change the recipe a little. We thought that it tasted like there was way too much cream cheese. (it was so thick) We will try to use just one pack of cream cheese, up the milk, and add a beaten egg to the mixture to hold it together and make it a little fluffy.  :)

Good.  Too good.  :)  I didn't have the kind of mozzarella that had cream cheese in it so I just used fresh mozzarella and shredded it by hand.  It worked just fine.  I still put the regular cream cheese in where it said to though.

This was very good. Next time I may add some mushrooms. Maybe reduce the cream cheese and add more milk.  I didn't find it dry. I wonder if the people who said so had not covered it.

Extremely rich, even though I chose to use only one package of cream cheese and more milk.  Next time I might cut the total amount of cream cheese to 4 oz and add ricotta.  Loved the sundried tomato flavor!

Items in it were tasty, but the lasagna was a little too dry. I would have liked a more creamy/cheesy middle sauce.  My husband said that it was MUCH tastier as leftovers the next day.

Delish!  We didn't have mozzerella so I used colby-jack and it was great.  We also used whole wheat lasagna noodles.  The cream cheese/milk mixture looked very thin and watery but it worked out great in the dish.

This was fantastic!  We'll definitely be making this a regular on our dinner rotation.  As if there wasn't enough cheese already, I added 1/2 cup ricotta just because I had it in the fridge.  WOW!

Our dinner guests loved this and requested the recipe!  I had altered a little based on others' comments.  Mostly I just added some more flavor with extra basil and dried Italian Seasoning, extra cheeses ( I mixed Mozzarella into the cream cheese sauce), and 1 egg.

Way too much cream cheese flavor. I like cream cheese, but this recipe leaves your mouth FILLED with it.  Tastes similar to chicken alfredo, but I would rather just eat chicken alfredo and leave this messy, time consuming process behind. Definitely won't be making this again...

My family was not at all crazy about this.  It was borderline edible.  The flavors were good, but the texture was off.  Maybe I did something wrong...

I really didn't like it and was disappointed after seeing this recipe advertised so much. It seemed too dense/heavy. Maybe more liquid in the sauce would be better.

This was awesome!!!! I added mushrooms & chopped spinach. I had to add a jar of alfredo to the meat mixture, since I added ingredients. Also, added more shredded mozzarella between each layer & on top. This was heaven for the taste buds. Try it, you won't regret it.

Delicious flavor blend, but a bit rich. I'll definitely make it again but I might try to tame down the cheese mixture a bit.

AMAZING!!!!!  This was fantastic!!  Great flavor and fairly easy to make.  I used a rotisserie chicken and that made it all the easier to make.  This definitely went into the "keeper" folder!

I Really Liked It, But I Changed a Few Things And I Think It Would Have Been Better With Different Noodles. I Used The Oven Ready Noodles And I Should Have Used The Ones You Cook. I Also Didn't Add Tomatoes, And Only One Thing Of Cream Cheese, I Used ricotta cheese instead, I Also Added A Egg To The Cream Cheese Mix. Over All it was Super Yummy, Just The Noodles Didn't Cook Right, But Thats all i Had LOL

It was five stars with my changes! I made it for Mothers day and my family absolutely loved it. We cleaned up the entire pan with no left overs. First I changed the tomatoes. I did not use sundried, I used Rotel tomatoes with green chili's. I also added sautéed spinach and marinated artichoke hearts (drained) to the chicken mixture. Also used fresh garlic and not powder. Then I cut the cream cheese back and only used 1 1/2 cream cheese blocks instead of 2. I didn't add any milk to the mixture but used an entire jar of already made alfredo sauce. I just mixed it in with the cream cheese and it turned out perfectly. Thanks to all of the previous reviews I knew exactly how to adjust the recipe to make it EXCELLENT! Next time I thought about adding sautéed onions and red/yellow peppers and maybe a little bit of bacon. It was absolutely perfect this time around. Multiple family members asked for the recipe. And, this was my first time cooking any type of lasagna. Will be making it again for sure!!! If you want to cook it and your afraid it will turn out bad because of what previous reviews have stated, change it. Make it your own. You don't have to follow the recipe exactly. Happy Cooking!!

The flavors were great and it was surprisingly easy to make for  lasagna. However, the cream cheese sauce was too thick. So I will make it again if I can come up with a modification.

This was my first attempt at making any lasagna ever and it was an absolute success! I tweaked the recipe based off of some of the comments and personal preferences. I used whole wheat noodles. I cut the cream cheese portion in half and used Ricotta con Latte in its place. Instead of garlic power I used real garlic. I added diced tomatoes with green chili peppers, spinach and doubled the quantity of chicken. For the top, we made a mixture of the left over cheeses, diced tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes and more spinach. Baked it uncovered accidentally but it came out perfectly. Will definitely make this dish again!

Very tasty! I added fresh cilantro, cream of chicken with mushrooms, and a cup of milk which reduced the thickness of mixture.

I made this for a potluck at Church and it got rave reviews. It is very rich and will only make a couple time a year as a splurge.

I'm not sure how anyone has successfully made this dish. I made it exactly to specifications, the food hardly has any moisture for the lasagna noodles, so despite that the noodles were pre-cooked, they were floppy and chewy. On top of that, it's very lacking in flavor from spices...after removing the noodles, the food was a bit more bland than expected. I won't be using this recipe again.

This was expensive to make and it tasted like tuna casserole. : (.  Basil was too strong and not a spice generally used for chicken.  I halfed the sauce it was creamy enough, couldnt see putting a entire cheesecake in the middle of it.

Excellent recipe as is however I wanted spinach which I added to the artichoke cream cheese mixture.  I also mixed in cottage cheese. I mixed in all the chicken as well.  I had to thin the mix a bit.  I used the broth off the chicken I poached. I layered mixture, noodles and cheese about 4 times!  It turned out amazing!

Very poor written instructions.. I had to make more sauce because of it. I think it kinda flat lined, it was mediocre. Probably won’t make again

We thought it was a little dry. We used no boil noodles so that was most probably the cause. Will probably add extra milk next time.

This is a really good recipe! My entire family loved it...even the picky one! I added a little red onion, added a can of cream of chicken soup and omitted 8oz of cream cheese. I also added an extra cup of milk, because I wanted to use the ready bake lasagna noodles. Baked at 375 for 50 minuets and it came out perfect. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I love white/cream based pasta dishes and this one was excellent.  I'm also a huge fan of sun dried tomato and artichoke.  I did tweak things based on others' reviews and because I didn't read the directions carefully enough.

I used 1 package of cream cheese plus 8 oz ricotta cheese and an egg.  But I did not catch in time the part of the directions to use 1/2 of the remaining cheese sauce (aka 1/4 of it since half went in with the chicken/artichoke mixture) so when it came time to do the last layer I had no more cheese sauce.  So I used 8 oz more of ricotta, milk, garlic powder, some basil, (even used dry with the fresh), and another egg.  

Other changes included adding some minced garlic to the chicken/artichoke mixture and adding mozzarella to each layer, not just the top.  

I forgot to cover it before baking but I think with the extra sauce and changes I made it was ok because it did not turn out dry.

So good. So creamy. Must be a cheese lover for this one.
