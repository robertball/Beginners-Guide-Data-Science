I used 3 eggs, halfnhalf instead of cream, and added some garlic and chopped green onions for extra flavor.  My family loved it.  Very quick to prepare (20 min.)  A keeper.

This is always been one of my favorite pasta dishes.  I used pancetta instead of bacon, cooking the pancetta in olive oil until lightly crisp.  I added another 1/4 cup of Parmesan to the dish and a pinch of salt to the cream to heighten the flavors.  Some sauted crimni mushrooms rounded out the dish.

This was a good recipe.  It did need a little more flavor.  I added more parmesan cheese and more salt and that really was enough to make everyone inhale it.

I modified the recipe slightly by frying some chopped onions in the bacon oil and once soften, i added the pasta to the same pan. My partner, a carbonara fan descripted it as perfect.

very good-just be careful not to overcook the cream sauce mixture or the eggs will cook independently of the cream. Also add some ham and mushrooms for added zest.

Anyone preparing this for dinner is already not concerned about fat or calories, so...I have always added 1-2 tablespoons of butter to the pan when frying the bacon (chop bacon before frying).  Instead of whole eggs, seperate and only use the yolks, it makes the meal richer.  You can also use half-and-half instead of cream.  Add more parmesan at the table (fresh, if possible). To round out this meal for kids, add 1 1/2 cups thawed, frozen peas before adding cream mixture.  Serve with green salad and french bread.  Always a hit!

Excellent recipe!!!! It would be 5 stars with the simple addition of a little salt. My first bite was.. meh.. then i added MORE black pepper and a little salt and ... PERFECTO!!!!!!!!!!! I scaled the recipe back to 2 and I wish I'd only done 1 because I ate both helpings and now I feel really fat. Soooo yummy. This is going into the rotation. Perfect for those nights when I forget to defrost meat for dinner.

I really liked this recipe with a few tweaks.  I sauteed onion in the bacon grease and upped the cheese.  Not a figure friendly or healthy recipe, but oh so delicious.

It was really good, but I cut the amount of bacon in half worrying that had I used 8 slices it would have been way too salty. As it was, the saltiness was perfect. 

My boyfriend reported that it was better the second day when it took it for to work as leftovers.

I enjoyed the pasta, but it definitely needs more flavor! Don't be afraid to make this recipe your own. I plan on trying this again, but I will customize it for more taste!

This was pretty good.  As per another reviewer, I also cooked up a bit of onion in the drained bacon pan; then added the pasta and added the other ingredients.  I reduced the recipe to serve two, which still meant using two eggs. No way I could use that many - went with only one and it was plenty.  The resulting sauce was quite thick enough.  Quite tasty.

This was a great recipe.  I added onions and chicken to this recipe to add some flavor, and I would have added mushrooms if I wasn't cooking for such picky eaters but overall this dish was great! Thanks so much for adding.

Very good basic recipe, just added much more cheese - Romano - and some garlic powder.  I used whole milk instead of heavy cream..a little looser, but just as tasty.

This was really good. I added a couple extra peices of bacon, some chopped ham and peas. 
I'm only giving it 4 stars because I really couldn't get past the fact that I was using eggs and not cooking them the way you would normally cook eggs. It was my own fault, I didn't read the entire recipe before I started to make it. 
I don't know if I will make it again.

The original way was a little bland.  I made it a second time and added ham with the bacon.  I also used half herb and garlic fettucine and half regular fettucine on the third time which was really good.

Maybe I used the wrong kind of noodles, but my version had little taste.  The bacon was the only thing that gave it any taste at all.  It was okay.

I added mushrooms, onions and parsley for a bit of extra flavour, and cooked it with sliced chiken breast also to bulk the meal up for my male flat mates. They loved it! Was delicious next time I will have to make extra so I can have it for lunch again the next day!

Good basic recipe. Similar to other reviewers I felt the recipe was a little bland, so I added salt, extra cheese, garlic powder, crushed roasted garlic, and peas to the pasta mix to increase the flavors.

Fabulous!  The sauce turned out beautifully creamy.  I did add some garlic and extra parmeson (I LOVE CHEESE), and a little garlic salt at the end.  The flavor was great, the texture was great.  I made it as an entree, so I added a chix breast w/ lemon pepper for a complete meal.

I took some of the suggestions given here already and used 1/2 & 1/2 and lots of cracked pepper.  I really enjoyed this simple, yet tasty, meal.

It tasted really good! But when I looked at the calorie intake per serving - I don't know if I want to make this again- or even eat it anymore! :) I might have to exercise for 5 hours to burn those calories :)

This recipe is good, and simple for first-time cooks. Instead of average fettucine noodles, i changed it to farfalle; it made a nicer presentation. I found that the original recipe was really dry, so another 1/3 cup of heavy cream did the trick. Since it's mainly a white dish, I used fresh white pepper instead of black. Good recipe!

You can't go wrong w/ this easy carbonara recipe.  My 6 yr old requests this dish once a week.  I tend to broil the bacon while I'm waiting for the noodles to cook, as it just cuts down on time (and makes crispy bacon w/out the greasy mess!)

This recipe is great, very quick and easy. I used a whole can of coconut milk instead of heavy cream. Doubled the parmesan cheese, and added garlic salt as well as salt and pepper. Made for a very creamy and delicious carbonara!

The carbonara was delicious. When preparing the dish, I did things out of order, but it worked out! I drained the pasta too early and left it sitting for a while when I was mixing the ingredients together. I had do the final step for longer than 1-2 minutes. I also recommend that you let the carbonara sit so the dish becomes creamy. Great as a cold leftover. I would like to try adding garlic to this dish. I feel like it'll offer more good flavor to the dish.

Fold until egg sets, but not scrambled.  Serve!  Yumm..  Grandkids-2 & 5 loved it as well as PaPa.

Oh so easy to make and quite delicious! Used garlic and parsley fettuccini since my family likes a lot of spicy foods. I would have preferred plain fettuccini for myself to be able to enjoy the simple combination of flavored. Five stars!

I used one less egg and it turned out fine.  Instead of using real bacon and bacon grease, to save time I used Oscar Meyer's real hickory smoked bacon pieces.  I used about a 1/2 cup, and this flavor, coupled with parm and pepper and a little garlic turned out to be excellent.  I think without that variety of bacon, it probably would have been bland.  I also added broccoli instead of peas.

First time we made this it tasted good but was missing something...try this, rather than 1/2 cup of parm, use 3/4 cup.  Also add 1 tablespoon of garlic powder.

Yum! I was pressed for time and looking for the simplest Carbonara recipe possible. Something I could whip up w/o running out for extra ingredients. This was it. I followed some of the suggestions of the other reviewers and added a bit extra cheese and salt. I also added a bit of torn basil to the cream mixture and for garnish. Very satisfying and bit hit.

I used 1/2 cup ricotta cheese instead of parmesan and added 1 cup shredded cheddar. Also a little garlic salt and cooked it until the cheddar had melted. At the end I through in sauted mushrooms, celery and gr. onion. Very versatile recipe. I will use it often.

I loved this recipe, but I made it my main dish by adding some chicken.  I cubed the chicken and cooked it in the skillet where the bacon was (I poured the grease out, but left a small amount in it).  It's wonderful!!

This is a staple at our house and served often for guests.  Very easy.  I add a lot of bacon for flavor and increase the parmesan.  I just wish I knew how to keep it from getting cold so fast once it's served!

This is quite possibly the best thing I have ever eaten, and certainly one of the best things ever to come out of my kitchen.  My husband said it tastes like something that would be served at a really good Italian restaurant.  My 15-year-old son had THREE helpings (he wasn't even going to try it!!) and was wishing he wasn't full so he could have more.  It is very rich, so a little goes a long way.  The recipe says it serves 4, but with my husband and I each having a serving and my son having 3, we still have lots left over.  If you like carbonara, try this recipe!!  Shannon, thank you so much!

Great recipe!  Easy to follow & easy to make.  My husband loved it!!  
We always had this dish growing up, but that recipe didn't call for cream. I found that it added a heartiness.  
I try to prepare low fat/low calorie dinners most of the time, but this will definitely become one of our 'diet-out-the-window' night recipes!

I loved the recipe!  I was craving a good carbonara but lost the recipe I had long ago.  Found this one, and with the addition of red onion and frozen peas (sauteed in the bacon grease, btw) combined with the perfect proportion of the wet ingredients as laid out in the recipe, the taste took me back to my first carbonara in a restaurant in Dayton, Oh!  I will definitely make this dish again...it's the new hit in my house!

After reading other reviews, I used 3 eggs, and cut the bacon before frying. I substituted milk for the cream and turkey bacon for regular bacon. Definitely needed the salt and pepper. Enjoyed and will make again.

My family really liked this. I had a lot of bacon to use up so tried this. I never, ever follow any recipe -- it must be a quirk I have -- so I made this a tad healthier by using canned milk, and egg whites. My son had some of my fave -- New Castle Ale on hand-- so I had to throw some of that in too Just a bit. Awesome. Use ground flax seed to thicken sauce. Oh, yes -- my family for some odd reason doesn't particularly like Parmesan -- so I used a combination of Asiago and Mozzarella. Everyone really liked it! Thanks for a great recipe.

Maybe I messed this one up-I tried making it twice.... I cooked it on low heat to keep the eggs from scrambling, but it kind of ended up tasting like pasta with eggs and bacon. It also took me much longer than 10 minutes to cook the sauce into the pasta, the eggs were still very runny. Which was still okay, but I couldn't get the sauce texture down! My boyfriend and I agreed- it was a 7.

This was ok, I found it a bit gooey and as recipe said egg can curdle if you leave to long, when I remade the next week I added mixture after taking pan off the stove and served up real quick and was good.

Points for being a quick and easy recipe.  But, it needed some work for favor.  Second time around, I added minced garlic and sauteed onions, salt, and red chili pepper flakes.  I like a lot of sauce so I used less pasta as well.

Yum. I wanted a good basic cabonara, without onions or peas or shallots, etc. and this completey hit the spot.  However, I did add a little garlic.  It's a great  comfort food.

This was pretty good with a few changes.  I added nutmeg and salt, and a 1/4 c. more parm.

this was so easy and quick to make. My whole family loved it! I substituted 12 cup of the heavy cream for milk, just to cut down on the fat, and it turned out PERFECT! Thank for the great recipe...

This is very similar to  my favorite pasta dish at Johnny Corrinos.  I think it needs more parmesean cheese and maybe on more ingredient... some one suggested olive oil.

made it today. a bit bland but after adding a bit more pepper, it met my expectations already. will definitely do this again. let the ingredients sit for awhile to make the taste blend better.

my family doesn't eat pork so i substitued turkey bacon for real bacon, big mistake.  i'm sure it would have been better if i were able to follow the exact recipe. sauce was good though.

This was a great dish!  Carbonara is one of my favorite meals and I have been looking for a fast easy recipe and now I've found it!  I made dinner, ate dinner and cleaned up in less than an hour!  Thanks

Awesome! It came out perfect the very first time I tried it. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone. One little note: you may want to cut down on the egg, and add more bacon for a better taste.

My very picky boyfriend loved this dish but next time I will add some onion and seasonings because I found it to be rather bland.  It did have a very nice texture and with a little doctoring it will be worthwhile to make again.

Definitely a fabulous addition to any chef's recipe file.  I have been searching for the perfect carbonara recipe for years and find it funny that it is just so darn easy to make. (How come most restaurants can't figure this out?) I used only three eggs and it came out fine.

This is fantastic - and so easy! I cut back a little on the bacon the second time I made this - just my preference - and used spaghetti when I did't have any fettucini - I think I like it better with spaghetti. I also added another 1/2 cup of cream (half & half works too) to make it creamier.  Excellent recipe.

This recipe is so AWESOME!! I cooked this for my boyfriend for his birthday. I was kinda nervous because I don't cook that oftern because I'm away at school most of the time.  But it was so simple. My mom tried some later and had to take back  the words that I don't know how to cook. She, as well as my boyfriend, told me I did a wonderful job. No one can really mess this up. 
They said they would expect to pay a lot at a resturant for a dish like this!

I changed this slightly. Instead of using bacon alone, I added leftover Easter ham with the bacon. I really liked the flavor. I liked the kids' pasta more than the one I made for the adults )see other review from today) but they weren't interested in this one.

I had this in Europe a few years ago and this is just as good as authentic!  I used angel hair pasta and added some garlic powder, oregano, and a dash of red pepper....wonderful!!  Thank you!

I have been looking everywhere for a good carbonara recipe.  You may think I am crazy, but the only thing I have ever had was a tv dinner by Michaelina's that was a carbonara and it was divine.  I am so happy to finally have the recipe, and for that matter a excellent recipe.  Thanks Shannon.

I thought this dish lacked in flavor. Needs some additional spices.
