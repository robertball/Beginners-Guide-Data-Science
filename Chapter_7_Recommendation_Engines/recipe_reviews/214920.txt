This is my submission--I suppose it's not great to rate your own recipe, but I made this tonight and tried some new things with it--was great and wanted to share the ideas. Tonight, I used 1 Tblsp sugar and 1 Tblsp Splenda, with 2 Tblsp cider vinegar and 1 Tblsp rice wine vinegar. This is the amount of sweetness we like in it, but some like it a little less sweet so adjust to your own taste.  Also, for tonight, I used a can of Summer Crisp Mexicorn (I think its called Southwestern, actually) that had red and green peppers and black beans in it. Added a can of rinsed great northern beans also. Was REALLY good with the beans, added protein and fiber. Thanks to all who have reviewed--it helps to get feedback. I appreciate that, and I'm glad you liked the salad.

Too much sugar.  1 tsp is all it needs.  I substituted white balsamic vinegar for the apple cider vinegar and  green onion for the sweet onion.  It was attractive and delicious.  Fabulous when you use raw fresh corn kernels cut off the cob.  I make this frequently.  p.s. I freeze the corn cobs and use them later to make corn chowder.

LOVED THIS...took to a barbeque and hubby had filled his plate and tasted this corn salad.  He said "who made this great corn?" . He didn't know what I had made for the meal.  He's has a very discerning palate, but does like things on the sweet side. This was definitely the hit of the meal in a family that really knows how to cook and enjoy food.  Followed the recipe exactly, except that I had a small shallot I wanted to use so replaced the sweet onion.  Will be making again definitely!  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great way to get more raw veggies into your diet. I used half appple cider vinegar and half white vinegar. I also used a packet of stevia instead of sugar.  I loved it and intend on using it regularly for my family as well as for pot luck dish.

This was so easy to assemble and quite good. Would be great to take on a picnic or a potluck since it requires no refrigeration. Thanks for the easy recipe!

This salad is very good.  I enjoyed it.  I thought the dressing went well with this.  I did add jalape√±os instead of green bell peppers to give it a little more kick.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I like this because you can pick and choose veggies or stir-up the dressing according to your preferences. I used freshly cooked corn-on-cob and cut it off.

This is not really a fair rating of this recipe in particular but I found a recipe similiar to this at my local grocery store so I used this as a base for that salad. I added 1 can of drained and rinsed black beans, 1 can of drained and rinsed lima beans, an extra (smaller size) can of corn and whole wheat fusilli noodles. For the sauce I tried the one in this recipe and didn't really care for it so I added about 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of roasted pepper salad dressing (similiar to italian), very yummy.

I followed the directions pretty closely except used freshly grilled corn on the cob (I cut the corn off).  Also used all kinds of bell peppers, not just red/green.  Tasty!

Very good fresh summer salad. Quick and easy recipes. I made this for a block party because I had a ton of vegetables I wanted to use and leftover corn on the cob. I cut the corn off of the cob and mixed all of the ingredients together. I topped the entire salad off with fresh parsley and added fresh grape tomatoes. Everyone loved the salad, however, I personally felt like something was missing. I will definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe as is. I found I needed a little more salt. Other than that, this was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

Used splenda instead of sugar and kept the rest the same. Fyi It is on the sweet side but still very good

This is a great make ahead dish. I thought it was better the second day, letting the dressing soak into the food. We made it while camping and it was very easy and delicious to add some veggies into our diet out on the road.

Delish!  I used fresh corn off the cob(cooked and cooled) we had left from dinner, added parsley, a pinch of garlic powder and green onions.  I didn't use the apple cider vinegar, but did use regular distilled.  I omitted the water, but honestly ... don't think you could ruin this.  I didn't measure anything and it was perfect!

Great recipe serves as a base.  I threw in some veggies that I had left over, like a can of artichoke hearts and finished off a bottle of Red Pepper vinaigrette.  Sorry to those of you purists who want a recipe rated on exactly as it is written.  My purpose was to use this as a guide for a salad to take to a pitch in and it was great for that. I like reading changes that other people make.  I think it is interesting and provides some good ideas.

Having a lot of corn in freezer, this is a great  use for it.  Simple and tasty side dish.  I make enough at one time to last for more than 1 meal.  It keeps very well for several days with this type of dressing.

This is a great summer side dish. One note, I backed off on the sugar a bit the second time and thought it tasted better. The thing I like about this recipe is how easy it is to mix it up. Using corn as the base you can vary the recipe based on what is coming out of the garden and the vinegar really helps blend all the flavors together. The one thing I was surprised by was how well this kept in the fridge.

It was very good, but a little too much vinegary. Will reduce the amount next time and put in red onion instead.

Couldn't wait to try this because it sounded so good. I guess I like my corn hot and sweet not cold and vinegary. Sadly I wont be making this again.
