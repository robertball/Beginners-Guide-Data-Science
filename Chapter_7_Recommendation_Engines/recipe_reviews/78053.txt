I tried this recipe and the candy would not firm up - it was very runny.  I'll try making it one more time since it is much simpler than my usual divinity recipe.  The only change I will make will be to increase the temperature.  I heated to 238 degrees -- next time I'll bring the temperature closer to 250.

Yes, divinity will turn out grainy and runny if you make it on a humid or rainy day. That is true with any candy or fudge.

No one in my family can make divinity so year before last I tried it and it was a flop.  Last year I tried this recipe and it worked wonderful.  It was soo good and soo easy to make.  Anyone can make this!!!!!

This did not firm up well and the texture was too sugary.

Tried this today and it turned out wonderful.  Taste just like the old type of divinity.  I cooked it to the 140 degrees.

I used a thermometer and this recipe is a waste of Mallow Creme. Will not try a gain. Apparently from the other reviews this recipe is unreliable.

I made this candy or I should say I tried to make it.  I cooked the sugar syrup 5 minutes and it still never firmed up. Not wanting to waste the ingredients, especially the pecans, I rolled the mixture into 1 inch balls, Refrigerated them and dipped them in melted chocolate bark.  Yum!  I've gotten rave reviews. 
There's more than one way to salvage a recipe!
