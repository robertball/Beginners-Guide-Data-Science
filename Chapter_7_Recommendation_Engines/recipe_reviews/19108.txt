YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!  Thank you!  A few of you have mentioned lumps in the frosting.  What works for me, I warm my mixing bowl with hot water first.  It is just enough warmth to "melt?" the cream cheese. Then use a chilled bowl for the Whipped cream, whip till very stiff.  Maybe why some are having trouble with it being runny. Fold together and it is absolutely scrumptious!! Awesome flavor!  So much lighter than a Cream Cheese frosting.  It won't over power the flavor of your cake.  Had many requests.
MAY I ADD A HINT TO ALL WHO HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH THIS RECIPE BEING RUNNY!  IF USING THE SAME BOWL AND BEATERS YOU MUST WHIP THE CREAM FIRST.  IF THERE IS EVEN A HINT OF THE CREAM CHEESE (OILY SUBSTANCE) IN THE BOWL OR ON THE BEATERS YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR CREAM TO "WHIP" UP TO A STIFF CONSISTENCY, WHICH MEANS THE FROSTING WILL BE TOO RUNNY. YOU MUST TRY AGAIN.  VERY DELICIOUS!

This was a real, real disappointment.  There is NO WAY you can pipe this frosting...it is soooooooo soft and runny. I am an part time cake decorator so I am very familiar with piping frosting.  I placed my bowl and beaters in the freezer and chilled my whipped cream.  It was still too soft to really ice anything other than a flat sheet cake. After reading the reviews I noted that some people said use only 1 cup of whipped cream and not 1 Â½ cups.  Possibly that may have made it a little thicker.  But my point is...the recipe as written does not work.   Another reviewer suggested that this frosting can only be used on a flat, sheet type cake and I totally agree.  I used this to frost a 10 inch angel food cake and it just started to drip/slide down the sides.  It did not hold up well.....and that was after refrigerating and trying to chill/thicken it up.  I would never make this again....stick will regular, buttercream creamcheese frosting.  If you enjoy carrot cake with traditional cream cheese frosting you will not enjoy this fluffy, runny, whipped cream version.

Very Good recipe.  If you are concerned about it not being stiff enough for decorating I would do the following.  Dissolve 1 Tablespoon unflavored gelatin in 2-3 T boiling water.  Strain out lumps if necessary.  While beating the finished frosting very fast with mixer pour in hot gelatin mixture.  I know this may seem odd-beating quickly and adding hot liquid but it works.  Keep beating for a minute or two until it is well mixed (if not there will be lumps of gelatin).  The frosting will stand up much better for decorating, I've used it many times for borders, writing and other (nothing too fancy though).  The frosting will hold its shape after it is decorated for a few days.

I make large special occasion/wedding cakes.  This recipe is a definite winner in the taste category, but it's only good as a filling.  I was very disappointed in it as a frosting because it has way too many airholes, and it just doesn't firm up enough when chilled to be stable (and not slide off the cake).  It does truly taste wonderful, and would be great as a fruit tart filling.  I made a double batch decorate a large cake and ditched that plan shortly after I started frosting the cake.  I read that it piped well, but I could just tell that was not going to work (and NO, my cream was not over whipped!).  Note to the person who tried to substitute powdered sugar in this recipe:  Powdered sugar is less sweet than granulated sugar, so you need 1 3/4 c powdered sugar to equal 1 c white granulated sugar.  You can't always substitute powdered for granulated, but in this case you can.  Actually, now that I think about it, powdered sugar contains 3% cornstarch which might aid in firming this recipe up a bit - I'll give it a try using powdered sugar next time.

I was nervous to make this based on the same concerns and problems coming up in many reviews and I was using this for a round devil's food cake. I always chill beaters and copper bowl.Chilled heavy cream also. Cream cheese was room temp.  Debated the sugar issue:10x or granulated and chose to stick to the recipe.  I beat the cream until it was almost like butter and placed it back in freezer while doing the rest.  I whipped the sugar/cheese forever and there was no grainy text. When I put it together I could see that it seemed somewhat 'loose' so decided to put it back in the freezer for another 15 min. Garnished w/strawberries as seen in the pic and placed them between a papertowel to draw up the extra moisture and not leave pink 'footprints' on my frosting, or slide down the sides from wetness.  The cake frosted fine although it is a very whippy frosting even after all the extra precautions.  I wouldn't hesitate to just whip it up and throw it on a sheet cake but would take the extra time when doing a round cake.  The taste is incredible.  I love it because it is not sugary sweet but sweet enough and complimented by the cream cheese.  I agree that this would make an A-1 fruit dip!!! Slathered liberally on the cake and still had about 1/2 a cottage cheese container left over so it does make plenty! I absolutely love this and would be great with almond extract on a cherry cake.  This is definitely a keeper.  thank you so much for such a lovely whippy non-sickening frosting!

Since I wanted to pipe the frosting onto cupcakes, and given some reviews indicated this frosting wasn't firm enough for that, I adjusted the sugar and cream to suit my needs. I used powdered sugar rather than white, and reduced the whipping cream to 3/4 cup. Once I had the frosting made I chilled it just long enough to make it of piping consistency.  This was a light, fluffy cream cheese frosting which was the perfect choice for "Red Velvet Cupcakes," also from this site.

ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT ICING AND FILLING!!!  I used this on a yellow cake for my husband's birthday and HE even said the icing made the cake.  IT TASTES WONDERFUL!!  You HAVE to be patient while you're whipping the cream because it can take a while, but you will know the cream is ready when it looks like Cool Whip.  Also, make sure to stick the beaters and the bowl (I prefer a glass bowl) in the freezer for about 15 minutes before you whip the heavy cream.  Your cream cheese MUST be at room temperature or you will end up with lumps.  You'll find that if you do it right, this icing is light enough that it spreads PERFECTLY onto your cake, not like the tubs of icing you buy in the store.  THIS ICING IS GREAT!!

Wow.  This is amazing.  I just frosted some pumpkin cupcakes with it and they are perfect.

I had absolutely no problem with runniness, and can imagine piping this.  It isn't really stiff, but it could happen.

I did as another reviewer suggested and whipped my cream in a separate bowl than the other stuff.  I happen to have a copper bowl, which I put in the fridge to chill for maybe 30-45 minutes first.  I also kept the cream cheese cold, and I think this is important.  Just by nature of beating something like this you warm it up, so I took this straight from the fridge and used it.  I also chilled that bowl.  I whipped it for a good long time - at least five minutes.  I took little samples of it because I thought I was done, but when I tasted it I crunched on grains of sugar.  After more beating and careful folding, I was done.

This is amazing stuff.  Just a little bite from the cream cheese, but otherwise light and fluffy with a wonderful vanilla flavor.  What I don't know is how they will hold up overnight or for any length of time, so I'll post when I know that.

Update:  I made this on a Sunday night and took the cupcakes to work.  One woman who ate one on Tuesday said it was the most amazing thing she had ever tasted and it was just wrong to moan and groan so much over the frosting.  Thought that was a pretty good review, and convinced me that the frosting held up for a couple of days!

I've played around with this recipe a bit and found the right adjustments in order to make a frosting that will hold up to the weight of a layer cake, taste like cream cheese, and still not have that dense pasty texture of most cream cheese icings.  

1 cup pasteurized heavy cream, cold
2 tbs granulated sugar
1 package Oetker (or other brand)    
  whipped cream stabilizer

16 oz cream cheese, softened
4 tbs unsalted butter, softened
1 cup powdered sugar, sifted
vanilla extract to taste 

Beat together cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla.  

In a separate bowl with clean beaters whip the cream, granulated sugar, and stabilizer until medium peaks form.

Add a bit of the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture.  Stir to combine.  Fold in the remaining whipped cream in two additions.

This is the ultimate in frostings! I use it exclusively on my famous carrot cake that I make for the holidays. It is easy to make, and it is very flavorful, delicate, and simply sublime! It is does require cool temperatures, especially when making it, so be sure to lightly soften the cream cheese just enough to work with it. If your room is too warm the frosting will be a bit runny. I found that it will snap back into form if you spread it quickly and then refridgerate it immediately. Some trial and error, but well worth it!

I was unsure about this recipe after reading some of the reviews.  Here are my conclusion, however.

First, you can definitely pipe with this. I used it to make cute swirls on mini and regular cupcakes.  You just have to get the stuff cool enough.  Chill a metal bowl, the beaters, and the cream in the freezer for 15-20 minutes.  Meanwhile, blend the cream cheese and sugar on med-high speed with the mixer (preferably the stand type) for at least 5 minutes.  Put this mixture in the fridge while you whip the cream to very stiff peaks--stiffer than you would want for garnishing your favorite dessert.  After you mix the cream in, chill the finished product for 15 minutes or so and that will make it firm enough to pipe.  Although I wouldn't attempt any detailed piping, you can definitely do rosettes, shells, and swirls.

Next, the taste is very pleasing but mild.  Don't expect a really strong cream cheese flavor.  That being said, this frosting is delicious and would work well with a lighter cake.

As far as the type of sugar to use--I made the recipe as stated.  The key to eliminating grittiness is to blend the heck out of the cream cheese and sugar mixture.  Substituting powdered sugar would work as well, so feel free to swap it up.

I hope these hints help--you should definitely give this recipe a try if you are looking for a change from the usual.

I have used this recipe several times. First off, it tastes AMAZING! It is the perfect combination of richness without being too heavy or too sweet.  If you're like most of my family, and you cringe at the sweetness of buttercream halfway thru a slice of cake, you WILL love this flavor. I can just about eat this straight out of the bowl, if I didn't know better.  I have made this with and without altering the recipe by substituting powdered sugar. It is slightly firmer with powdered sugar (do add 1 3/4 C. instead of 1 C). I should also mention that I do freeze my metal mixing bowl and balloon whisk attachment prior to beating the cream (old trick I've used for years anyway). I whip the cream first, then transfer it into another bowl, then it goes into the freezer while I mixed the cream cheese and sugar.  Once I take my whipped cream out of the freezer and mix them together in the metal mixer bowl, I return it to the freezer until I frost my cake. I don't leave it long enough to freeze, maybe 15 minutes tops. But the chill helps it to stay firm, I'm sure.
My favorite way to use this recipe is as a filling/frosting for a layered strawberry shortcake. Amazing flavors! My only complaint is that everyone asks for this cake for their birthday and it isn't exactly a fun one to decorate. I much prefer playing around with buttercream and fondant so it would be NICE if someone would ask for a regular cake one day! Not that it has anything to do with this recipe! : )

The BEST cream cheese frosting I have ever had. I did take another persons comment and subtituted the white sugar for 1 3/4 C of Confectioners Sugar and it came out incredable. This definitely be used quite often.

Great frosting, but one you have to play with to get the right consistency for piping... I was using this for cupcakes so I used confectioners' sugar vs. white sugar a bit more cream cheese and cut back on the whipping cream.  Overall, it was delicious but needed a little work.

This is a fabulous recipe.  As the title clearly states, it is *whipped*, as in, fluffy.  It pipes beautifully.  I have never had it turn out too thin to pipe, and I've made it dozens of times. Nor would I consider adding any kind of stabilizer or starch or gelatin.  I will vary the amount of sugar, depending on what I'm using it for.  As it is, this is pretty darn sweet.  I blend the softened cream cheese and sugar together, with a stand mixer, first; until there is no trace of grittiness from the sugar.  I frequently whip the cream in the same bowl without washing the bowl.  This is cream we are whipping, not egg whites.  I have used this as a filling and frosting for layer cakes without a problem.

This is an absolutely wonderful frosting for those of us who do NOT like sickeningly sweet frostings!  I took the suggestion to use 1 3/4 cup conf. sugar, instead of regular sugar.  I froze the bowl and beaters for 15 minutes before whipping the cream to stiff peaks, and it was no problem at all. I then put bowl of whipped cream into the frig to keep it cold.   After cleaning the beaters, I then creamed the room temperature cream cheese and sugar together in a different bowl, then beat in salt and vanilla.  Again, no problem.  Folded the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture, and the result was wonderful! I had more than enough frosting for my 9" x 13" pan of carrot cake. If you are careful to follow the temperature directions, this is actually a very easy recipe.   This is a keeper for me!

Excellent!!! I am going to add a photo soon. This was not runny at all. I followed the recipe as is and frosted a two layer chocolate cake (too much chocolate chocolate cake, on this site) with lots of strawberries...sooo good!!!
If you have not made whip cream before be sure to follow these tips: chill beaters and bowl before mixing - mix until you have the consistency you want. If you over mix your cream will turn to butter, if you under mix your cream will be runny. Once you have made whip cream put it in the fridge while you make the cheese mix. When cheese mixture is well mixed, fold in whipped cream. If you do not know how to fold it in, do not be scared. Pour whip cream on top of cheese mixture and stir in by scraping down the far side of bowl and coming up the other side. (Bringing some cheese mix to the top) continue this motion turning the bowl a little each time, until you have an even consistency throughout. 
I hope this helps.

This recipe obviously doesn't really need to be reviewed again, but I wanted to let anyone know who is worried about some of the reviews that stated that the frosting is too runny and wouldn't pipe, that they shouldn't be concerned. I'm not sure what mistake those who had problems made, but it certainly isn't the recipe. I made it as stated with NO changes and it is perfect, would absolutely pipe, and tastes fantastic. Obviously with it calling for real whipped cream, this isn't an icing that can stand up to being at room temperature very long, but that's an easy trade off for me so I can enjoy real whipped cream instead of the store bought kind that has to use partially hydrogenated oil to be able to stand up to warmer temps. This is an excellent icing. It's got a wonderful texture and is just sweet enough. It is a great icing to use for cakes that are already very sweet on their own. It will be my "go to" white frosting anytime I don't need to have a cake that will be sitting out for a long period of time. If the kind of icing you need is one that you want to be able to sit out on the counter all the time, then you need to stick with a buttercream frosting. Make sure you use a high quality whipping cream. I have found that the cheaper ones, in fact, don't hold their "whip" as well over time (also make sure it is very cold). I also refrigerated my frosting over night so the cream cheese could get cold again and help with the frosting not being too thin. Hope this helps some!

I love this frosting!! After reading some reviews I changed it up a bit. Instead of regular sugar I used 1 3/4 cups of powdered sugar to cream cheese portion and also added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch to the heavy cream portion. I froze the whipping utensil and mixing bowl and the heavy cream for about 15 minutes. I whipped the cream for about 2 minutes on the highest setting and then added the cornstarch, beating it until it is very stiff almost butter!! This way when you add the cream cheese to it, it doesn't get too soft.  Mine came out awesome...not overpoweringly sweet...perfect for frosting AND piping!!

I knew there had to be a whipped cream, cream cheese frosting recipe out there!  I love this site.  Hey you guys, even I, an "intermediate" level cook, know how to stabilize whipped cream:  Soften 1 envelope Knox gelatin in 1/4 c. water.  Then microwave it for 30 sec. (watch it so it doesn't boil over the cup.  You will have a mess and blame me for it.) Stir the thick mixture until gelatin has melted.  It smells weird, but you won't taste it in the whipped cream.  Then let it cool.  Don't use it while warm.  When you whip the cream, add the gelatin when you put in the sugar.  It will keep the cream stiff and will hold it from separating.  Good luck.

I have a cupcake business and this is one of the frostings I use on carrot cake... it's fabulous!  Just make sure you whip the heavy cream VERY FIRM.  Then I fold it in the best I can with a spatula, then I quickly whip it with the hand mixer for just like 30 seconds to make sure it fully incorporates, it's great!

Absolutely delicious! I used less sugar called for & added some pureed strawberry/raspberry into the frosting which made it very raspberry-ish which is absolutely to die for. Frosted on my from the scratch strawberry cake. Will definately make this again & again.

I think this recipe has wonderful flavor. I don't understand why other reviewers are calling it bland. Maybe they did not add enough vanilla.  I must admit - I'm always a little heavy handed with the vanilla. I used my frosting for an orange layer cake so I added just a splash of orange extract also. The reason I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the sugar choice. I can't figure out why this recipe uses granulated sugar and not confectioners/powdered sugar. The granulated sugar results taste fine but the granules were noticable in the frosting.  My thought is that a powdered sugar would produce a much smoother and non gritty frosting. But don't let that comment stop you from making this frosting.  It's very very tasty and a wonderful idea and a welcome change from the traditional heavy cream cheese frosting. The whipped cream adds such a fluffiness to the frosting and the results of this frosting are PURE white which is hard to get when you make a buttercream recipe because butter is yellow. But to make it pure white you must use the "clear vanilla extract". I would say this frosting will go well on any cake recipe you choose. I'm sure it would be an ideal recipe to flavor with wonderful extracts also. Try it!

This is a really great frosting. Don't be nervous that it calls for regular white sugar - don't be tempted to use confectioner's instead. Just be patient and mix it until smooth, as directed. It will suddenly go from grainy to silky. Don't rush it! What you'll end up with is delightful - it would go well with so many flavors: strawberry, pumpkin, carrot cake all come to mind. I used it for strawberry cake and loved it (so did everyone else).

I normally don't make frosting for cakes.  This one is excellent, easy to make, and holds up well for a day or two in the refrigerator.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

This is the perfect cream cheese frosting ever! I omitted the salt because the cream cheese is salty enough to our taste. Other than that, followed exactly. So light, flufy and full of flavor. Not too heavy like traditional cream cheese frosting, and not too light like whipped cream frosting. Perfect! Would go great with any cake, but especially perfect with carrot cake. I am sure that even those who do not usually like cream cheese frosting, would love this one! Thank you!

This recipe is excellent, it's my go-to recipe for my strawberry shortcake cake! It's light and fluffy and it's the most beautiful frosting I can imagine. The only thing I noticed when reviewing it was that people are having trouble with the amount of cream used in the recipe because it makes the frosting a little thinner and less able to stand up than needed. The best way to get around that is not to reduce the amount of cream, because in my opinion that makes it less fluffy. I always make it by whipping the cream cheese, sugar, salt and vanilla for about 2 minutes with a stand mixer (with the whisk attachment) and then just adding the heavy cream to that mixture, and whipping it together until it's to your desired consistency. Works every time for me and turns into a gorgeous frosting!

Tried this... Ingredients are great but the directions need more input. Read all reviews and found that "KATSKI" was right on. Try this and see. You will change your mind if you gave a poor previous preview. Thanks for a gret recipe.

I've made this frosting several times and love it each and every time.  I follow the recipe as is, and have even substituted almond extract for the vanilla (cutting it from 1 tsp to 1/2 tsp).  Recently I frosted nearly 70 cupcakes with this for my Grandson's first birthday and got rave reviews all the way around!   Made three batches, adding food coloring to two - worked GREAT!

Have to say that my Kitchenaide mixer made whipping the whipping cream nice and stiff which made the frosting easier to pipe with the star tip.

I was skeptical about how stiff this frosting would be, but it was great and SOOOO delicious! The key is to make sure your whipped cream is beat to very stiff peaks. 
I put it on strawberry cake, it was very light and refreshing dessert. I can't wait to try it with lemon cupcakes! So good, I highly recommend!

This really cannot be called a "frosting."  It is a whipped cream topping for a flat sheet cake or bar recipe.  Don't think that you can actually frost and decorate a cake with this.  It is very runny.....and I whipped the cream until stiff peaks formed and chilled the entire mixture well before putting in on my cake.  If you like buttercream or cream cheese frosting this is not for you.  If you like a rather bland whipped cream frosting give it a try.  I did not like it at all and I don't agree with all the rave reviews.

I used this recipe to frost and decorate a two-layer cake for my sister's birthday party.  The frosting started to slide off the top of the cake as soon as I began applying it.  After adding confectioners sugar to thicken it, I finished frosting the cake but it still continued to slide down.  By the time we cut the cake, this frosting had slid off the side of the cake into a pool on the cake plate.  What a mess!!  It tasted good but BEWARE - don't use for a anything but a 13x9 cake in a pan!

This frosting is by far âthe bestâ cream cheese frosting ever!! I first made this when making the recipe âFrosted Banana Barsâ by deltaj, which was a reviewer recommendation. This works great whenever cream cheese frosting is needed â red velvet cake, carrot cake, spice bars, cinnamon rolls, pumpkin bars, etc. As recommended by others DO NOT let the cream cheese get too warm. I only leave mine on the counter for no more than 10 minutes. I also use the whole pint (2 cups) of whipping cream instead of the 1 Â½ of which the recipe calls for. I do this simply so I donât have any leftovers, and I find the Â½ cup addition only makes the frosting fluffier. Whether it is made with 1 Â½ or 2 cups of whipping cream, you will not be disappointed only addicted!

I just got done making this recipe and it turned out fantastic and tastes great too! I was a little leary since other reviewers had trouble with the consistency being less than desirable but thought i would give it a go anyway.  I used my KitchenAid stand mixer and chilled the stainless steel bowl in the freezer for about 15 minutes before starting. I whipped the cream as directed using my wire whip attachment and then placed into a separate bowl when done. I then added the cold cream cheese, sugar (I used C & H Baker`s Sugar Ultra-Fine Pure Cane Sugar) and vanilla into my mixer bowl and beat until smooth and creamy using the beater blade attachment. I then removed the beater and using a rubber spatula I slowly folded the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Turned out great! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This frosting is GREAT!!! I used it to frost cupcakes and it piped really well. The ONLY problem I have is that if I leave the cupcakes out it gets very soft, but not to the point of melting. Next time I will add some powdered gelatin to my cream before whipping it. I will keep this recipe for ever!

The best word to describe this frosting is: WOW!!! A week after using this frosting to make a Flag Cake for Independence Day I'm still getting rave reviews about this frosting and requests for the recipe.  The next time you want to make a Cream Cheese Frosting give this one a try.  It's not too sweet, light in texture and ultra creamy. You will NOT be sorry you tried this recipe.

This is delicious on pumpkin cake, and box recipe cupcakes.  We found extra freezes well for at least a week (just cover very tightly) and is tasty for dipping thin mints and berries into.

It has more "kick" than whipped cream frosting, but is lighter than traditional frosting.  Perfect combination for a light dessert!

This cream chesse frosting is absolutely grand!  I made it with fat free cream cheese, room temperature and it was a success on a carrot cake...the trick is to have patience with the whipping cream, it will be well worth the time spent when everyone is raving over it!

This frosting is SO GOOD, it didn't leave you feeling sick like all other buttercream cheese frosting. I used 1 cup of heavy cream instead, and did chill my beater and bowl in the freezer for 20mins. Quick tips, if you want the whipped toppings to hold up better, I added 2 tablespoon of confectionary sugar to the topping, and beat til it stiff. And i placed them in freezer while beating the cream cheese. For the cream cheese, I used 10oz instead for stronger cream cheese taste and dumped it into food processor, and once smoooth, i added fine sugar to it, and beat til smooth and no lump. Transferred into another bowl, and then I folded in the whipped cream. I chilled the topping for another 15mins, so it is more easy to spread without being too soft on my round red velvet cake. Being a whipped topping base, you definitely have to keep your cake chill. This is definitely a keeper, as my family kept on asking for more!

Yum!!  This is fantastic frosting!  I added about 1/2 c raspberry juice (raspberries and water put in a blender then strained) into mine because I wanted it to taste like raspberry, and it turned out great!  Very light, airy, fluffy, and delicious, but yet the right consistency for piping onto my cupcakes.  I recommend, though, to others who may want to add a different flavor to scale back on the vanilla.  Its a little much if you're going for any flavor other than vanilla.

I jove this cream cheese frosting recipe.  The whipping cream makes it less sweet, fluffy and easy to spread.

When I read the recipe for this frosting I was excited to make it...then I read the reviews and was a little worried but decided to go ahead and follow the recipe to the letter. I mean its frosting..if it doesn't turn out, toss it and start over, right?  If followed exactly this is the best frosting ever! It is not runny by any stretch of the imagination, in fact while I was folding the cream cheese mixture and the wipped cream together it stopped my mixer several times and I had to help it along by hand. The only thing I can figure out is that those that have said so did not whip their cream long enough.  Try it; I don't think you will be disappointed.

Terrific frosting recipe! Very simple and easy! I made this to put on a vanilla cake I made for a birthday. I had no trouble whipping this up! It was my first time making frosting, so I was a little nervous on how it would turn out. It was fantastic! The only thing I had to change in this recipe was the amount o the vanilla. I reduce it down to 1/2 teaspoon. I kept everything else the same. I loved making this, and my friends enjoy eating this too! I had a friend who didn't like cream cheese, but she loved this! I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

Simply Delicious! I did however take the advice of others and used confectioners sugar instead of the granulated, it gives it a much better (stiffer) consistency that doesn't drip down the sides. Thanks so much!! :D

This is one of the best frostings I have made. I use it as is and sometime I add some flavor.  Lemon was a hit.  I added lemon extract in place of vanilla and some fresh lemon zest with a few drops of yellow food coloring.  Today I made chocolate.  I added half a cup of coco powder to my cream cheese mix.  It was just devine.

Great frosting.  I had no problems..I added in 1/3 cup confectionery sugar to my heavy cream(I only had 1 1/4 cup)and whipped it for a good 5 minutes until it was thick(I added in the sugar thinking the recipe said to add in whipped cream-oops-came out so good though!).  I didn't soften my cream cheese that much..thinking maybe that is why other people were getting runny frosting.  I must say it came out perfect and it spread on my "strawberry Cake I" cake from this site beautifully. THANKS.

This recipe is the only one I use for my Red Vevet cakes/cupcakes and Banana Bars. It makes alot of frosting so I usually cut the recipe in half. It IS critical you fold the mixture, not beat it. Otherwise, this turns runny and not the ideal consistency for spreading. Your usual cream cheese frostings can be very heavy-this one is not. It is light and perfect every time.

Very tasty on a spice cake, not too sweet. Make sure to thicken and be quick if your planing on piping with it. It will break down if reaches room temp, or over worked. Remember to keep refridgerated!

This was very light and creamy.  I used this on a 2-layer 9 inch chocolate birthday cake.  I was nervous to try white sugar for a special occasion, so I just used 3/4 cup powdered sugar (it wasn't too sweet with that).  But I want to try the regular white sugar next time to see the difference.  I used the tips to chill the bowl and beaters, I let the cream cheese set out for about 15 minutes, and I beat the whipping cream for about 2 minutes on high speed.  Thanks again for the great recipe!

Wonderful icing.  If you let it sit in the frig a while, it sets up enough to be very usable on a variety of cakes.  I have been using a recipe like this for 20 years and our favorite is to bake a chocolate cake in a 9 x 13 pan.  Let it cool.  Spread this mixture on and let set in the frig a while.  Top with a can of cherry pie filling- swirling a bit to get a marbled effect and let sit in frig until ready to use.  We use it for birthday cakes and special occasions and get asked for the recipe often.  I have had friends call from across the continent if they lose this recipe.  Raspberry pie filling tastes great with the chocolate and this frosting as well. Thanks for a great recipe.

Make sure your cream cheese is at room temperature.  Otherwise you will have little lumps all over the icing.  It tasted good, not too sweet, but the presentation was awful because it was lumpy.  This is definately not as rich as regular cream cheese frosting if you are looking for a light alternative.

I prepared this recipe with a chocolate cake, and although the frosting is absolutely delicious, I didn't find that it went well with it.  It is extremely tasty (if you use fat-free cream cheese, you'll get the same taste), I'd recommend using it with carrot cake.

Oh my goodness!  oh my goodness!  This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site.
My mother turns 95 tomorrow and when I asked her what she wanted for her birthday dinner,
she said,  "I don't care as long as you make that cake again with that frosting."   She is raving
all over her assisted living facility about her daughter's (me) fabulous cake - Betty Crocker Devil's Food
boxed cake mix!

I think you could smear this frosting on cardboard and it  would be awesome!  Followed the hints - put my bowl and beaters in the freezer for a few hours before whipping the cream.  I used the entire one pint carton (can't waste this good stuff) and didn't change the other proportions.   The whipping cream stiffened up nicely in about 6 minutes.   Brought the cream cheese to room temp.  Just frosted a two-layer 9 inch cake -really the cake is just an excuse for this frosting.   It's in the fridge and will serve tomorrow.   Have done it ahead like this before and the cake stays moist and the frosting just keeps getting better and better.

Thanks so much for this recipe.  It's becoming my claim to fame :-)

This is simply the best of both worlds in cake icings!  I usually just do whipped cream with my choice of flavors.  But my husband wanted cream cheese icing on his coconut cake.  So, I saw this one on the side border of the page and thought it would be perfect, and it is!
       This turned out really well!  It is super easy to make and really easy to keep it firm.  You do not have to change the sugar you use.  Use granulated sugar.  You do not need powdered sugar to make this work.
       First, I left my cream cheese in the package on my counter for 6 hours prior to whipping it up with the sugar and flavorings.  I usually leave mine out overnight.  That is totally safe and works well.  Make sure it is really soft and then beat it with a hand mixer for a couple of minutes until the lumps work out.  Simple easy peasy.
       Second, while you are mixing the cream cheese have the metal bowl for the whipping cream in the deep freeze.  That will keep the bowl cold and will help speed the process of whipping the cream.
       Third, make sure the whipping cream is heavy and that it is in the fridge right up until you whip it.  Whip the cream on a higher setting.  I use my cuisinart 7 speed hand mixer at 5 speed.  Make sure you scrape the cream into the beaters while mixing, makes it go faster.  Then I folded, not mixed or stirred or blended, it into the cream cheese.  Then I put wrap on the bowl and put in freezer until I had my cake area ready to frost.   Wahlah perfect!

This was delicious. I wanted a fluffy frosting to put between my Red Velvet Sandwhich cookies, to resemble Ice Cream.  This was PERFECT.  I followed the directions.. chilling the bowl for the whipped cream (and doing it first) then warming a seperate bowl for the cream cheese making sure that I whipped both to fluffy consistency.

Everyone loved it, will be making this again.

WOW.... I can't believe I did this right.... but its really easy if you follow the instructions.. but its also better to use powder surgar as well.. When you mix the cream cheese make sure its at room temp , use a spoon to mix the vanilla extract and sugar once you get it all mix to where you see a look kind of creamy get your wisk an then continue to mix to get any lumps out & real creamy..... Now the key to this frosting is WHIPPING THE HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM... I used a stainsless steel bowl that I had in the Freezer 2 hours freezing I also froze my blender mix utensils . I poured the whipping cream into the cold bowl & begin mixing. BE PATIENT this takes about 5 - 12 minutes of mixing.. I started with it on low setting 1 then escalated to 5.. You continue to mix till it thickens so that it will be popping off the mixer .. It will look like very firm whipped cream. Yes it needs to be firm so you can fold it into the cream cheese mixture. Get your flat spatula pull the whipped cream out of the bowl start folding & steering it in the bowl. I pulled some , mixed some, pull so more into the mix till I got all the whipped cream out of the bowl. Now as you stir this will look like a smooth creamy frosting. I then put it in the fridge to chill while my cake cools down... FOLLOW THE RECIPE EXACTLY... THIS WILL TURN OUT PERFECT

I like the flavor of a cream cheese frosting.  I usually don't like the richness, though.  Cream cheese frosting tends to overpower the cake.  I went on a quest to find a less heavy frosting.  This one is perfect!!  It spreads like a dream.  It doesn't separate.  It accentuates the cake without overpowering.  Perfect!!  I even had some left over and put it in my coffee.  Try it in hot chocolate, or on some spiced apple cider!  Perfect perfect perfect!!!  Love this one!

This was the probably the best frosting recipe I've ever made.  As per other reviewers, I used 1 cup *powdered* sugar and whipped the heavy cream until stiff peaks formed.  I frosted a four layer cake and the frosting held up very well.

I agree with others saying that this frosting is not the best to decorate with. I used to cake decorate as well and I know that cream cheese frosting is the hardest to work with so I thought maybe this would be better. Anyways...its better on a flatter cake or cupcakes-I tried to ice a taller oval shaped one and had trouble keeping the icing from staying put. Does taste good, but honestly...cream cheese frosting always tastes better than decor icing. So i found this to be average but I did like the fact that it was a bit fluffier. I just wish it was stiffer. (It was when I first mixed it, but it started to lose its volume over time. (I did not have any meringue or cream of tartar...so ended up popping this in the fridge to get it to be a more workable consistancy.)

My suggestion would be to not make this while your cake is baking as you will have to wait for it to cool...during this time your icing will lose its fluffiness, so make it right before you plan to ice your cake and throw it in the fridge so it doesnt have time to try to slide. I only used 1/2 powdered sugar and 1/2 granulated (as I thought I'd have enough powdered...but next time I will just do what I had originally intended and use all powdered as I do when making other types of icing.

I live near Buffalo,NY and in our grocery stores we have 'Whip it". Its made by Dr. Oetker from Canada. Its a whipped cream stabilizer. I use this every time I'm making a whipped cream topping,it keepe the cream stiff so that you can pipe with it and it holds its shape.Added to this frosting recipe it makes beautiful decorated cakes and cupcakes.Its one package to 1 cup of whipping cream.

I didn't have vanilla so I used about a teaspoon of maple syrup and it was amazing. I can't get enough of this frosting. In fact I wouldn't call it frosting, it's so light and fluffy. It isn't too sweet it just melts in your mouth. Amazing!

I used strawberry cream cheese and I thought this frosting tasted great. It is a little soft, and I did put it in the freezer for about 10 mins before I frosted my cupcakes... I gave the recipe 5 stars for it's nice, light taste.

This frosting is awesome! Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect and delicious. Very rich though so I would not suggest putting it on super sweet cakes.

And yes you can pipe this and yes you can use this frosting for cakes other than a sheet cake. I have used this frosting for double layer cakes and cupcakes.  

It is important to remember that is a whipped cream frosting. It will melt if you leave it out too long! Also you MUST get the cream to stiffen. This takes about 10 minutes in my kitchen aid on medium speed. You don't want to whip the cream too fast as this will make the molecules bind to each other instead of getting air molecules in between them as this is what you want.

Absolutely AWESOME!  Yum, Yum, Yum!  I frosted my son's bday cake with this and got rave reviews.  The only problem I had with it was that it would thin out when I stirred in the food coloring.  But that's because it's the type of frosting you need to fold, not stir.  So might be best if you just keep it white.

I have made this a few times and it is spectacular! I made the mistake of using low fat cream cheese and it didn't turn out nearly as well.  I added crushed oreos and used it as a filling in my daughters b-day cake and got tons of compliments! Delicious!!!

My boyfriend wishes he could give this more than 5 stars.  I made it for his birthday cake and it was quite the crowd pleaser.  Perfect for ppl who don't like really sweet frostings.  FYI - we learned that it doesn't hold up in heat - at all.

I made this today for a trial frosting and I did tweak it because it had too much of cream cheese flavor for my taste. I ended up adding more whip cream (about another cup). I also didn't add salt. I did have plenty left, so maybe next time I will use a little less cream cheese. The consistency was great to spread on the cupcake.

This turned out perfect! I love cream cheese frosting, but sometimes it can be a little heavy. This is the absolute best of both worlds... a light fluffy icing with the great cream cheese taste.   After chilling in the fridge overnight I piped it on top of cupcakes and it didn't melt in the heat of the afternoon, even after sitting out for 3 hours during our birthday party.  After reading a lot of the reviews I only used 1 c whipping cream and whipped it until very stiff in a chilled bowl and set aside in the fridge while i was mixing the cream cheese mixture.  I used a separate bowl for the cream cheese mixture. Brought the cream cheese to room temp and substituted sugar with 1 3/4 powdered sugar, almond extract for vanilla (since we were using a strawberry cupcake, YUM!), and added the food coloring in. I mixed it very very well until it was super smooth the GENTLY folded in the whipped cream and chilled overnight.  I loved it, but it must have been really good because half of the guests wanted the recipe : )

Delicious! Wonderful is you prefer a not-too-sweet icing, and it's very light and fluffy, yet stiff enough to pipe on cupcakes. I haven't tried it on a cake yet, so I'm not sure how well it would stick to the sides, or if it would slide. I have already used this a few times and am getting ready to use it again for my friend's birthday cupcakes - she liked it so much when I made it before, she asked for it specifically!

I was  very worried to try this because I didn't have any vanilla extract.  But I wanted to try sonething different for dinner.  This is by far one of the best tasting frosting I have ever tried!!  I actually started eating the frosting right out of the bowl...sooo good!

Oh my goodness. This is beyond yummy! I read many reviews before attempting this recipe, and by combining several, I think the end result was fantastic! I used a whole pint of the heavy whipping cream, since what am I going to do with 1/2c of it after making this? I put the mixer bowl and mixing attachment in the freezer for about 15min before whipping the cream and it whipped up so fluffy after just a couple of minutes on 8 on my stand mixer. I poured a kettleful of hot water in my stoneware bowl I was mixing the cream cheese in to help "melt" the cream cheese a bit, letting it sit while I whipped the cream, and then when I put the whipped cream in the refrigerator, I dumped out the water and dried out the bowl. I used 1 1/2c of sifted powdered sugar, and added 1tsp of lemon juice as well as the vanilla, since I'm icing Sam's Famous Carrot Cake with it. As I was trying to fold the whipped cream in, I kept seeing blobs of the cream cheese, so I impatiently used my hand mixer to get it entirely incorporated, which seemed to work well. It seemed very firm, I think pipe-able with the cornstarch in the powdered sugar. I generously frosted a sheet cake with it, and saved what was left to have with strawberries on waffles for Saturday breakfast. My 19-month old son cleaned off the beaters of my hand mixer better than the dishwasher could! *Update: The next morning the frosting was very firm- if I want to put this between layers or pipe it, I'll refrigerate it overnight, then use it

GREAT GREAT GREAT...compliments any cake but is my favorite to use on the sour cream chocolate chip cake...absolutely awesome!! Only thing different that I do is cream the sugar, vanilla, and cheese together then add in the heavy cream and beat till peaks form...much easier and you dont have to worry about your whipped cream going flat.

This recipe makes a perfect lightly sweet, fluffy, cream cheese frosting.  If this frosting doesn't turn out well, it's a technique problem, not a recipe problem.  Beating the whipped cream to "stiff peaks" and using the proper folding technique are probably the big issues. Proper folding will keep your frosting fluffy and firm and not turn into goop.    If your frosting is too soft or runny, either the whipped cream was underbeaten and not at stiff peaks, the whipped cream wasn't properly folded (ex. was stirred or worked too much), or both.  If you have trouble folding the whipped cream (or are new to folding), add a few tablespoons of milk to the cream cheese mixture first.  The finished frosting will be softer but it'll be easier to fold.

What is all the fuss about? I was very nervous to try this recipe because of all of the reviews which stated problems, but I was very impressed with this recipe.  I used powdered sugar and chilled the bowl/beaters, like others.  This was just incredible!  Fluffy, not too sweet, and was perfect for devil's food cake!  Don't be scared off my all of the negative reviews - it's amazing!!!

this is shockingly good. there is a bakery in town that sells oodles of expensive cakes with people forming lines out the door every weekend.  well you know what?  this is the frosting that they use.  it tastes exactly like it.  excellent!  i used 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar in place of the granulated kind and it turned out magnificently.

SUCH a great frosting! I piped it out and it worked wonderfully. Here's what I did...I thoroughly whipped just 1 cup of heavy cream in a separate bowl and stuck it in the refrigerator, then I put the sugar / cream cheese mixture in a pot on low heat on the stove, just to get it a hair above room temperature. I mixed the cream cheese and sugar with a spoon as it was on the stovetop until it was almost totally smooth. I removed it from heat for a few minutes, then added it all at once to the bowl containing the chilled, very whipped heavy cream. I mixed all ingredients until velvety smooth and immediately placed in a piping bag. I then put the piping bag in the refrigerator for an hour or so, and when it was time to decorate my apple turnovers, the consistency of the frosting was PERFECT for piping. Not too runny or lumpy. Just right. The flavor is wonderful as well...sweet, light, creamy, and not overpoweringly sugary. Tastes divine and looks beautiful. Thanks for the recipe! Will use again and again!

Notes about technique.
1. Use stabilized whipped cream
2. Use superfine sugar
3. Use slightly warm cream cheese
4. Finally - add the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture in stages.  Add 1/3 whipped cream and fold then add another 1/3 whipped cream, fold and finally add the last 1/3 and fold.
Put in refridgerator for a few minutes and voila - yummy, creamy pipe-able frosting.

This is our absolute go-to, all purpose, foolproof frosting. It pipes so beautifully, and it's so sweet and cream-cheesy without being heavy. I've been making it for over three years now...thanks so much for sharing the recipe. :)

I agree with one of the reviews that it's really best as a filling, not all over frosting, but honestly...I just didn't like how it tasted!

This icing tasted great although I'd be tempted to add a little more sugar.  I used powdered sugar as I was short on granulated.  The icing wasn't quite as smooth as I'd hoped, but maybe I should have beat the cream cheese mixture together longer before adding my whipped cream.

Excellent Frosting! My only recommendation is whip the heavy cream AFTER doing the other portion; my cream flattened by the time I folded it in (still very good though!) but I enjoyed this frosting and it WAS bowl-lickable :)

Don't expect this to be a true cake icing - it will not pipe and in my opinion doesn't even have that great of a taste. I made this icing for a carrot cake for a party and am very disappointed. I used it to fill the middle so I didn't waste it and made more traditional cream cheese icing to frost it.

10 Stars!!!!!!!!!! This was wonderful! I made it exactly to recipe. Hubby kept getting spoonfuls out of the bowl, he couldn't wait for the cake to get frosted. I put this on Banana Cake VI from this site and it was out of this world! Hubby has already asked me to make a carrot cake with this frosting on it. This is such a versatile frosting - I can't wait to try it on everything! I am gonna be making strawberry shortcake just so I can put this on it. This one is a real winner - thank you so much for sharing it!

I wish I could give it 10 starts. This is the lightest cream cheese icing in the world. My hubby recently commented "The icing isn't as good as yours" when my daughter made a carrot cake with cream cheese frosting for my birthday I use it on cupcakes and get personal requests for it often. BTW I have a cottage baking business and it is my go to cream cheese icing. FABULOUS!

Based on some of the reviews and problems that other ppl had I adjusted this recipe. First I put my metal mixing bowl, beaters, and heavy whipping cream in the freezer. I left the cream cheese (I used low fat version) out so it would soften up to room temp. Instead of regular sugar I used 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and 2t of vanilla extract. It came out AMAZING.

I was a little leery about using this recipe because of the negative reviews, but it sounded so delicious I couldn't resist... and I'm glad I didn't!  It was amazing.  It complimented the gluten-free vanilla birthday cake I made for my MIL bday... GF cakes tend to be dry if not eaten fresh out of the oven, so I wanted a softer-fluffier filling and icing, and this took the cake!!!  I took extra precautions when making the icing because of the negative reviews... I followed amounts EXACTLY as called for, but what I did with the sugar, because I thought granulated sugar, as is, would be a little heavy (and I didn't want to risk it), I ground it to a fine powder in my spice grinder (only one cup)... and it worked.  And also, I learned in a cake decorating class I took that the name brand ingredients you use DO make a difference.  My instructor said that for stiff cream cheese icing, you should only use Philadelphia Cream Cheese... other cream cheeses won't hold up... no concrete explanation for why.  I don't know if that will help, but this recipe did not fail me.  EVERYBODY at the party loved the cake... they didn't even complain that it was gluten-free, and I'm certain it was because of how delicious this icing paired with it.  oh, one more thing... I didn't even freeze the beaters or the bowl before mixing... also, the icing held up fine during the 1 hour car ride to my in-law's house.  I used this icing to ice and fill a 4 layer birthday cake.

Super rich. Probably would have been great spread thinly on a carrot cake but was way to rich (not light and sweet like I was hoping) to put on cupcakes. It tasted like butter too much. Had to add extra sugar and still wasn't right :(

I followed the recipe exactly as written. This is a good frosting for those that like cream cheese desserts, such as cheesecake. I may use a little less sugar next time. I used it on a white cake, but didn't care for the combination. It would be best on a chocolate cake and/or with some kind of berries.

A nice and light cream cheese frosting that isn't overly "cream cheesey" if that makes sense.  Very delicious and fluffy and easy to make, with a stand mixer!  I had my cream cheese at room temp. and it blended perfectly, no lumps.

I loved this frosting.  I chilled the whip cream bowel and beaters which worked great.  I put the CC in microwave for 15-25 sec to cream betterwith c.sugar.  This frosting needs to chill before and after frosting your cake etc.  I let mine chill over night and it was so good.  Thanks for sharing.

This frosting is THE MOST DELICIOUS frosting i've ever tasted, not greasy or heavy or too sugary. It's easy and totally suitable for piping. Mine didn't come out runny at all, i made sure all of bowls and whisks were washed with soap and dried perfectly! If they're not, the cream won't form peaks and will be runny. Oh, and you need to beat that cream for a looong time. I made no adjustments, it's perfect.

I don't like frosting. I always scrape off the frosting from any kind of cakes. But, I was assigned to make cupcakes for kidsâ birthday. Kids wonât eat cakes without frosting right? I am so glad I found this recipe. OMG. This is so good I can just eat out of bowl. From my anti-frosting standard, this is not a frosting!!! This is a perfect combination of the fluffiness of the heavy cream and creaminess of the cream cheese. Very light tasting. Make sure to whip up the heavy cream over ice. I used 3/4 cups sugar just because I like it less sweet.  I whipped up the heavy cream until it gets a soft peak. I was worry that it will turn in a butter. It was still a little soft side. But, once I mixed it up with the cream cheese mixing, it all came together to the very nice consistency. It is the best âstuff âto put over my cake.  Totally recommended.

Excellent! I used powdered sugar because it was all I had. This is a wonderfully light frosting. I used it on the "Mafioso Cake" recipe on here (BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER!!). It was a perfect combination. I kept licking the frosting bowl! Got many compliments on it :) Will make again!

I use this lots. Especially with heavy chocolate cupcakes and red velvet. 

I substitute the sugar for 1 3/4 cups of icing sugar, an often add cocoa to taste, and even add a couple tbsp of fruit or berry jam to give it a slight flavoring. Adding instant coffee and cocoa together makes an amazing mocha flavor as well. 

In case you haven't noticed, I've used this recipe dozens of times in the last year, and it's perfect every time. Probably my favorite frosting.

This is a great recipe . It's so light, not like some of the other cream cheese frostings I have used before which can be overpowering on some things. I was a bit concerned about the consistency & how well it would stand up, so I did add 1/2 tsp. of corn starch as another user suggested and used 10X sugar (which has additional cornstarch in it) instead of granulated. It turned out great. I piped it onto some cupcakes & topped a chocolate silk pie, both were delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for my son's 1st birthday cupcakes and it was delicious. People were asking where I bought the cupcakes! It does have a strong cream cheese flavor, which I wliked, but if it bothers you, extra sugar would probably minimize the cheesiness. I used powdered sugar and only 1 cup of whipping cream to try to make it a little sturdier, but it was still very soft. I wouldn't try to use this for decorating a cake, but as a nice basic topping, it was perfect.

I just got done making this recipe to put on a black magic cake. I followed the recipe to the exact amounts. I didn't have a problem with lumps or being to thin. Will definitely make this again and again.

A keeper! This turned out great and the taste is fantastic! I used for layers rather than outside frosting and I put a thin layer of raspberry preserve on top before the cake.
I read the other reviews and used whipped cream stabilizer (basically cornstarch) to keep it stiff, and used the white sugar rather than icing sugar.
Think I need to make some cupcakes to use up the remaining icing...

delicious. make sure you buy the highest fat percentage for your cream it makes a difference in the final product. I used this on strawberry cake II from this site. It was to die for.

The best!!  Super easy to make - I did add some powdered sugar at the end to firm it up a bit and some food coloring gel and stirred it to a beautiful, creamy, dreamy frosting.  So much better than the heavy butter cream frosting.  Then I piped it and my kids went nuts for it!  Thanks!

This was very good, but very rich.  I used cool whip instead of heavy whipping cream, because I did not have any cream.

LOVE this recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly though I was not sure about using white sugar.  I make lots of cakes and have always used my mom's butter cream recipe.  I had a request for a whipped frosting for a wedding cake and tried this, not only is the taste and texture perfect, it also smooths nicely and is easier to work with than my butter cream recipe.  I will be using this from now on!

i have never had better frosting than this. it was very easy, and better than you could imagine. it wasn't stiff like regular frosting but it wasn't falling off the cake either. i would suggest using powdered sugar. you will agree that this frosting is fantastic.

I love a good buttercream or a traditional cream cheese frosting, but my family prefers the whipped cream-like frostings, and they INHALED this! Not too sweet, but the cream cheese makes it like a "richer" whipped cream.  Follow instructions exactly and came together beautifully.  Held its shape pretty well, too!

Wow. This was the best frosting EVER. According to me, and all 5 of the kids who enjoyed it. I actually modified the recipe to make a strawberry flavor (stewed down some fresh strawberries, added cornstarch and pureed -- plus used strawberry cream cheese) and it was amazing.  I will use this frosting forever. We could eat it straight out of the bowl!!!

This frosting is wonderfully light and delicious! Mine was not very stiff, but was perfect for frosting the Sam's Famous Carrot Cake that I made. (also from this site...I highly recommend!) My husband (who doesn't like frosting) LOVED this recipe. Not too sweet, but not too cream cheese-y either! I followed the recipe exactly as written. Thank you for a great frosting recipe! - UPDATE I also used this recipe as a filler for a mock cherry napoleon. I changed it some - used 4 cups whipping cream and almond extract instead of the vanilla....soooo good! It was perfect and not too sweet with the cherry pie filling I made.

This frosting has excellent flavor and I love that it's not too sweet.  I made it a day ahead since i was going to be piping cupcakes and wanted it to be stiff.  At first I was concerned because it seemed like it wasn't stiff enough, but it worked out just fine.  If you want a really stiff frosting for piping though this may not be it.  But everyone raved about how delicious it was.  Thanks!

great frosting. followed the recipe. i did however use powdered sugar. it is not a very stiff frosting so it's not ideal for decorating, which was fine for me. it tasted great! you can definitely taste the cream cheese more than anything. very easy recipe, thank you!

This frosting is GREAT!  I upped the deliciousness by adding a packet of vanilla pudding to the heavy whipping cream at the start of the mixing.  I also subbed 1 3/4 cup of powdered sugar instead of granulated so the consistency would be smoother.  The pudding mix tightened the frosting a little too much, so I thinned it to piping consistency with some evaporated milk.

It's certainly tasty but it's too much like a salad I make.  Just add sliced bananas, crushed pineapple, and strawberries and you have a delicious salad called champaign salad.  I can't remove myself from that.  I'd like a recipe for whipped cream frosting without cream cheese I guess.  Still, it tastes delicious.

I'm definitely going to make this frosting to cover my daughter's first birthday castle cake. I made a 2 serving batch to see how it would taste and look compared to a butter cream frosting. And it came out delicious and the texture was what I was looking for. It was so easy to spread and wasn't too runny, too thick, or too sweet . I can't wait to make the actual cake and spread this taste bud watering recipe over my castle cake. My frosting did come out a little bumpy, but I think next time I will use room temperature cream cheese.

I made a red velvet cake last week and made a traditional cream cheese frosting.  I made another for this weekend and tried this recipe and this won hands down.  The frosting came out fluffy and easy to spread.  It tastes delicious.  This is my new go to recipe for cream cheese frosting.  Thanks!

This is the best "frosting" ever!  It turned out exactly like the recipe said it would, and I even piped it for the top of my daughter's cupcakes for her birthday.  I think that the big secret is to make sure that you fold the whipped topping into the cream cheese mixture.  It takes a little bit to get it all folded in, but it makes so it doesn't get runny. I will definitely make this again!

YUMMY!!!  Followed as written.  Used powdered suger and sifted to be safe.  I was able to pipe.  Tasted like wonderfully lite and fluffly cream cheese icing.  Went great on red velvet cake.

This is very good frosting! I had no problems with it being runny or grainy, used regular sugar like the recipe called for.  The only thing I changed was accidental, I only bought 8oz of heavy cream.  Still very good, its a little sweeter than it would otherwise be, I think next time I'll be sure to get the right amount of cream but still this is delicious, has that cream cheese flavor but not too sweet, thanks!

Best frosting recipe I've ever found! I put this on almost every kind of cake I bake and have yet to find a flavor it doesn't go with.  Everyone I've had try this frosting has loved it - all the perks of cream cheese icing without any of the heaviness thanks to the whipped cream.  I'd give it 100 stars if I could!

Oh WOW, this frosting is DELICIOUS!!!! I just made it this morning & used it to top Red Velvet Cupcakes. This will be my new favorite frosting. The only thing I changed, like other people was, I used Powdered Sugar instead of white sugar. It is perfect, not too sweet, not too rich, it makes you want more & you enjoy your cupcake even more with this frosting. Thanks for the recipe!

This is now a requested family favorite! Great mild flavor. Very light which is remarkable for cream cheese frosting. Tip: Put your bowl in the freeze for a while before whipping the cream. Really makes a difference!

Great on Pumpkin Sheet Cake!  It was light, not too sweet.  I used Reduced Fat Cream Cheese (it was all I had) and it came out great!

As of trying this recipe today it is now my favorite frosting! I followed the recipe as posted except for adding 3/4 cup granulated sugar as opposed to 1 full cup and it was perfectly sweet. The frosting was so easy to work with, even spreading on a bundt cake. I had no problem at all with the frosting being "runny". I am not sure why that would happen.   Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...

This frosting is DIVINE. I've made it several times now, exactly as written, and although I can't see myself piping anything intricate with it, it makes a clean border and holds up fantastically as filling between layers. I whip the cream first until it's very stiff, then transfer it to a different bowl and store it in the fridge, and when the cream cheese mixture is ready, I use the paddle attachment to slowly stir it all together. Also, this time I reduced the sugar and added some pureed, canned strawberry pie filling. The result was to die for! Like a light, smooth cheesecake taste that still worked with my cake. The recipe does make a bunch, but it'll keep a few days and goes well with a great many things. IHOP-style cheesecake pancakes, here I come...

Great recipe! Topped my red velvet cupcakes with this and everyone loved them! I added a small amount of gelatin (1tsp to 2tsp water, bloomed and then melted in the microwave) to my whipped cream when it reached soft peak stage. My end product never got runny... Kept one in the fridge for a few days and it still looked perfect!

When I first made this recipe and put it on my cake, I thought I'd make a mistake in using it.  It has air bubbles and does not spread easily, BUT,  when I brought out the cake the next day it was a hit.  Everyone like the frosting especially.  Would also make an excellent filling for a chocolate cake.

Great tips about the heating and cooling of the mixing bowl. Mine was very smooth. I would only add half the cream next time though - personal preference though. Note - this makes enough for 12 HUGE cupcakes!

This frosting is truly wonderful!  Based on another review, I used 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar instead of the regular sugar.  It turned out perfectly - amazing flavor, and not overly sweet.  This will be the frosting I use for everything now!

I use a slight variation of this recipe regularly. 1 (8oz) pkg cream cheese, 1/2 C. sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla extract beaten until completely smooth.  Then gradually add 2 C. whipping cream and whip until stiff peaks form.  I have piped and textured birthday and detailed wedding cakes with it.  It always gets rave reviews and my sisters like to clean the bowl with a spoon. :o)  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing! Read the first review to make this turn out. I had no problem getting it to thicken and I only had regular whipping cream. I would suggest you make sure you have the heavy and it will get even thicker. As the first review said, MAKE SURE YOU WHIP THE CREAM UNTIL STIFF...STIFF...STIFF! It took about 10 minutes or so to get it to the right consistency, so keep going. Again, amazing! Thanks for the delich recipe.

TRY IT! Don't let the so so reviews steer you away from this frosting it is so worth the effort you put into it! I froze the bowl I used for the whipping cream, used whipped cream stabilizer, and put it back in the freezer while beating the cream cheese. Then used a hot bowl and mixer for the cream cheese. And folded the two together by hand. It turned out perfect, and piped into high professional looking peaks on my cupcakes. SUPER DELICIOUS! And not too sweet like powdered sugar frostings can be.

This frosting was amaaazinng! I had issues with consistency, but that's not the recipe's fault. Also, to make the whipping cream hold, I took 1 tbsp of strawberry Jello (I didn't have unflavored at home), mixed it with 1/4 cup water and let it sit. Then cook it on low heat, until the Jello dissolves. Let that cool for a few minutes (but don't let it solidify). Add that slowly to your partially beaten whipping cream and you will automatically see a difference. Your whipping cream will hold and not become loose for a good couple of days :)

Best frosting/filling/icing I can remember.  1)Did try to reduce potential graininess from white sugar by adding 1/3 cup pineapple juice to sugar and microwaving on low for a few minutes.  Not sure if it helped.  I also whipped the cream cheese for several minutes with the sugar to help with graininess.  (I was concerned that I'd made it too "thin" with the juice experiment, but no problem when I combined.) 2) Like others say, it's really hard to whip the cream too much. But whip it first using cold bowl/beaters and then put back in refrig while making the cream cheese portion.  3) I took advice and let both finished mixtures sit in refrig for 1 hour before folding whipped cream into cream cheese - not at all grainy by then.  Used as a filling for a pineapple upside down carrot cake (9" layers); it even kept its shape between the layers. Put extra dollop on each piece when serving.

I had some of the smae issues as others with this frosting.  It had little flavor and the consistancy was not holding up to piping.  In order to make it work for me, I used powdered sugar and doubled the cream cheese.  Lumps were worked out with good old fashioned arm power.

Since my dad can't have regular sugar, I used 1/2 a cup of Splenda, which can also be adjusted according to your taste. Instead of the vanilla extract I added almond flavoring in the same amount. The first time I made it I didn't have any Heavy Whipping Cream, so I used normal Heavy Cream ans used 1 tsp of Corn Starch to achieve the desired consistency. It was flavorful, yet not overpowering to the cake. I served it with Sams  Famous Carrot Cake (from this website) and it was a hit! Everyone wanted to know how I had gotten cream cheese to be so frothy! I highly recommend it!

I have made cream cheese frosting 100x using different recipes.  With that being said, I know you have to chill the bowl, beaters, cream cheese at room temp., etc.  This recipe was runny.  Not thick enough at all.

Wow! This is a great recipe! I needed a whipped cream-type frosting for a strawberry cake that would be sturdy enough for decorating, as well as for sitting at room temperature for a couple of hours! This one was just right; the cream cheese was just enough to make it sturdy without making the frosting too heavy. It tasted wonderful, and I will definitely make it again!

This is really yummy frosting!  This was excellent on the dark-chocolate cupcakes I made for my daughter's 3rd birthday party.  I was in a hurry and subbed a an 8-oz tub of Cool Whip in place of the whipping cream.  It worked like a charm!  SUPER EASY!  The frosting turned out very fluffy and light, perfect for cupcakes (I did not pipe, though). I added a little pink food coloring and sprinkles - it looked so appetizing & the little party-goers just loved them!  The taste was excellent, and the frosting actually held up really well even after leaving the cupcakes out of the fridge for a couple hours.  I had several moms ask for my recipe - they couldn't believe how good it was and were even more surprised when I showed them how simple it was to make!!

I made this exactly as written and it came out great!  Love the very light and creamy texture and it got rave reviews at our family gathering.  I would say that when whipping the cream, err on the side of overdoing it.  You are on the right track if it is nearly butter by the time you are done, and remember, the buttercream frosting everyone seems to love is made with... butter!  So whip away and don't worry about overdoing it.  Same with the cream cheese mixture - the longer you do it, the smoother it will be.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is excellent. It is light and fluffy and makes quite a lot of frosting. I used it with an Almond Bundt Cake recipe from this site and it made a very nice light dessert after a huge Easter meal. I will definitely make this frosting again. The only change I made was to use powdered sugar and almond extract because it went well with the almond cake. Thanks for sharing.

This was perfect just as written.  i also used cold cream cheese and a frozen bowl and beaters.  I whipped my cream in a stand mixer until it was really firm.  Not sure why others had a problem with it being runny.  It was amazing with the frosted banana bars on this site!

YUM!!!  I have now made this twice - one, a double batch, and tonight a single batch - and it will be gone by tomorrow!!! The first time I used reduced fat cream cheese and grain sugar.  Tonight I used powdered sugar and whole fat cream cheese.  I found that I had more lumps with the powdered sugar and had to beat that longer.  It was also less 'stiff' than the frosting with the 'real' sugar. Either way - it is SUPER YUMMY and you want to eat the ENTIRE BOWL!!!  It is THAT good!  Just make sure you beat the whole cream in a cold bowl until you see peaks - and you should be fine!  LOVE IT!  10+++ Stars!!!!

The best.I did change the granulated sugar to powdered sugar after reading reviews. I had no problem with the frosting setting. I would say if you did ,dont blame the messenger make sure your cream has stiff peaks. Thanks

Yes you can pipe this frosting, however, you need to really chill (I stuck it in the freezer for an hour or two, it was icy when I pulled it out)the whipping cream prior to mixing it.  You also have to have to refrigerate your cream cheese mixture prior to folding it into the whiupping cream.  So in other words, the key here is, Keep everything cold.

Beat the whipping cream so thick it's almost butter and add the cream cheese mixing just until fully blended. Very thick and creamy! Piped beautifully! Excellent recipe going down in history in our family! YUM OUT! Thanks, Tom!

Love This Frosting..Used it on my mother-in laws b-day cake and it was  a hit. Used on a devils food cake and sprinkled with grated chocolate..yum!!(Little hint for whipped cream frosting.. there is a product called Whip-it made by Oetker, that is a stabilizer for Whipped Cream.  It's a great product to have if you like using whipped cream frosting rather than buttercreams, Makes it easy to pipe and decorate with.)

DELICIOUS!!  Very fluffy, perfect for making a light cake without having to use a heavy buttercream frosting.  Kept well for several days on frosted cake (in fridge)

I think it's a good recipe...my only problem was I used Cool Whip and I wasn't sure how much so I used a whole tub...WAY TOO MUCH...i lost the cream cheese flavor..I will try less next time or use real whipping cream but i didn't have any problems with grainy texture from sugar and I thought it wasn't bad

I have a new favorite! I used the frosting on cupcakes I took to work. The response was incredible! Everyone loved it and 2 co workers approached me to make them just a bowl of the frosting to eat!! I love that it is so easy, too.  The hardest part of this recipe was whipping the cream!!! Love It!

This is yummy!  I didn't use whipping cream because I bought just heavy cream accidentally, so I used some Cool Whip that I had in the fridge, and it really was good!  I put it on a banana cake and it was so much better than a standard cream cheese frosting!

This was very easy and the best frosting ever!  When I chilled the bowl and beater I put them in the freezer and that wasn't good because when I poured in the cream it froze along the bowl sides!  It was still OK, but maybe I should have put the bowl in the frig instead of the freezer!  I put this on Pat's Award Winning Carrot Cake (recipe on this site) and made a trifle by layering cake, drained pineapple cubes, and frosing in a clear bowl (3 layers of each) It was delicious and a great Easter dessert:)

Although the texture was fantastic, it was still missing something-more sugar, I think. Taking others' suggestions, I chilled the bowl and beaters and brought the cream cheese to room temperature. It came out perfect-no lumps and it looked like Cool Whip. I substituted powdered sugar for the white, but next time I will use white and more of it. This has some possibility if you like a light icing.

I am stupid because when I made this I thought it was the actual cream cheese icing. but this turned out just as good if not better with the cake that I made.

I really do like the regular cream cheese icing best, but if you already have a rich cake, or you want something a bit lighter this is perfect. I used to for the German apple cake recipe on this site, and it worked beautifully with it.

Very great IDEA for a frosting, but the recipe is off.  I don't care what anyoone else says about the recipe being fine...if you have to put all that work and wait for all the stars to align for something to turn out, it's wrong.  I had everything chilled and beaten to stiff peaks and the frosting was just too runny.  I switched to powdered sugar, which is more appropriate, since that is how you make homemade whipped cream.  The powdered sugar and keeping everything chilled did the trick.  I thought the idea of this was great, but in theory, the recipe should be changed to be made with powdered sugar.  The white sugar is just too harsh for the whipping cream.

This recipe was wonderful, I've added it to my personal cookbook and will use it many times in the future.  EVERYONE complimented on it and asked me how to make it.  I substituted the sugar with confectioners sugar and put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes before frosting.  I frosted a 9 Inch round layered cake, using the frosting for the layering & the frosting.  It was delicious!!!!

WOW!!!  Just give me a spoon.  Tastes like a heavenly mousse.  I used orange extract instead of vanilla.  It tasted like a orange push-up.  Was a little soft.  Needs protected from much heat.  A keeper for sure.

Don't know what I did wrong with this one, but it was much too runny to frost my pumpkin spice cake (from this site) for my Dad's birthday last month.  However, it's taste was wonderful and it made a great fruit dip instead!

4 stars based on the original recipe, but certainly 5 stars with some modifications recommended by other reviewers:  used 1 1/5 cups POWDERED sugar vs granulated. I also used a chilled bowl to whip the cream and a heated (with hot water) bowl for the cream cheese. I then whipped the 2 together and it truly is the best cream cheese frosting I have ever had!  Yum!

This icing piped extremely well and stayed formed on top of a test cupcake in the refrigerator for 4 days.  The second time around I cut the cream cheese in half and added a little more whipped cream to keep it from being quite so tangy.   People liked it both ways, so it's just a matter of taste.

Definitely a keeper, and that's from someone who bakes A LOT. Read the reviews. Used the 1-3/4 c powdered sugar. I also stabilized the whipped cream using the 1 tsp unflavored gelatin/tablespoon hot water method. I didn't want to be changing the recipe on first try, but I was making this for a birthday party and worried the frosting would be a flop without stabilizer. Interestingly, though the frosting was a bit soft going on the cake, a few hours later when I took the cake from the frig for the party, it had set up beautifully--it hadn't slumped at all. The cake looked great and the frosting tasted divine. I can't wait to try it on other cake recipes. I used this batch for hummingbird cake. Truly amazing flavor: not too sweet, not as rich/heavy as cream cheese frosting, just the right amount of lightly sweet/cheese balance. Fluffier than cream cheese frosting but more personality than whipped cream. Everyone loved it.

This frosting is the bomb!!  I usually prefer cake without frosting, as most are too sugary-sweet for my taste. I've made this twice now, and perfected it with only minor tweaking.! I use the entire 16 oz carton of heavy cream, rather than 12oz, so then I also add more cream cheese as well.  I decreased the sugar by half, and added a pinch more vanilla and a tiny dash of cinnamon.  YUMMY!! Also works great as a dip for fresh fruit such as strawberries & grapes.. Try it! You won't be sorry.

Thank you Chubbs, Cindy and Tom, my first time with this frosting is a success! I used the balloon wisk on my Kitchen Aid 600 to whip the heavy cream first, scraped it into another bowl and refrigerated it. Then I put on the paddle and whipped up the cream cheese and other ingredients.  I like the addition of salt.  I was a little worried about the cream cheese mixture being a little too stiff for folding so I set the metal mixer bowl in warm water in my sink for a few seconds.  Then I brought the whipped heavy cream out of the fridge and used my best folding technique.  I don't make sweets often but when I do this frosting is worth my while.  However it will never go on my red velvet, that is received for a roux frosting only.

I made this frosting for carrot cake cupcakes, but I used "whipped" cream instead of heavy whipping cream, confectioners (powdered) sugar and added 1 egg white for a creamer texture.  I had no lumps at all.  Perfect frosting.  Thank you for sharing.

LOVE IT! I followed the recipe and the advice to use 1 3/4 powdered sugar. Whipped the cream and put it in the freezer while blending the cream cheese and sugar. I used NeufchÃ¢tel cheese because it was all I had, it turned out perfect. Did not chill or warm any bowls, and when I added the cream I whipped it on the highest speed for about 30 seconds and it was perfect consistency. It piped out fabulously straight from the mixer and was not runny at all. I used my kitchen aid mixer with metal bowl.

Just made this to frost a chocolate birthday cake.  I followed the suggestions to use icing sugar, and was concerned about the texture not being firm enough to pipe, but it did firm up in the fridge after a couple of hours.  The flavour is outstanding, and I mixed about a cup of the frosting with a half cup of natural peanut butter for the middle of the cake. AWESOME!

This recipe is unbelievably good!  I studied the comments, and ended up following the recipe exactly, BUT making sure to chill my beater and bowl in the fridge beforehand.  My cream cheese had been sitting out for several hours, and so that was no problem.  I also folded the two together carefully and then finished off with 30 seconds with the mixer, as one commenter suggested.  It came out BEAUTIFULLY and was perfect for "Sam's Carrot Cake".

I realize that one reason I normally feel guilty about carrot cake is that I have to leave the icing behind.  No longer! 

Advice: I used regular (not confectioner's) sugar, and it worked very well.  However, I was NOT piping, and frankly it didn't look stiff enough to pipe easily. I almost didn't use the entire amount of sugar because I thought it would be too sweet, but it wasn't.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it's just the right amount of sweetness not to overpower the cake. 

So light and fluffy -- beautiful, really. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe this morning, using 1 3/4 c. Powdered sugar instead of white sugar, and it came out PERFECT. It is light and delicious. I used it to frost cupcakes and did not have any problem whatsoever piping it. It looks Beautiful! Wish I could get my IPAD to let me upload a pic!

This is the most delicious frosting I have ever had thus far! Thank you so much for sharing. The frosting was not runny at all; it was ideal for decorating my muffins and cake. To make sure it's not runny, you need to whip the whipping cream properly. First, put it in the freezer for about 2-3 hours. Afterwards, pour into a plastic bowl and whip it with a mixer on high speed for about 10-15 mins. It will start to form peaks after some time, so don't give up. Once that is ready, dump in all the other ingredients as in original recipe and continue whipping with mixer for another 10 mins or so. To get a smooth consistency, leave the cream cheese on the kitchen counter or somewhere in a warm place for it to soften (an hour should do, but better if you take it out at the same time you put in your whipping cream in the freezer). You can get the perfect consistency and texture with this frosting but you have to be patient and dedicate a bit more time to get it just right. good luck!

When I read the comment by the "part time cake decorator", I had already made my first batch of this icing, so got a little nervous.  I make wedding cakes, and was trying this icing out for some angel food cupcakes I made for a birthday.  I used just shy of one cup of icing sugar, so that was why I was nervous after reading reviews.  I thought it would be too soft for piping.  Everything else in the recipe, I left as it was.  The icing came out PERFECT!  I had let it sit in the fridge after I put it in the piping bag, just to let it cool.  It piped so beautifully, and stayed looking perfect even through transporting!  Everyone absolutely loved it!  It was not overly sweet like so many icings are.  I will absolutely use this recipe again!

Somebody call the police (this frosting is SO good), it's criminal!  Takes just about any cake from good to great.  I've made it several times now, but I used it on banana cake today.  O. M. G.  I added 2 mashed bananas to the frosting, and they took me away in handcuffs.  Yum.  Yum.  Yum.

I twicked this just a little. I used 8oz c.cheese, 4oz butter, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup p sugar, 8oz heavy w cream and since I was using on a coconut cake I added coconut flavoring as well. Mix c.cheese, butter, flavorings and sugar at room temp and the very cold w.cream was whipped using a very cold bowl and beatters. This frosting turned out great. Whip the c.cheese mixture first and then whip the the whipping cream and fold the w cream into the c cheese mixture. This will not fail. WONDERFUL.

I was looking for a frosting recipe for my son's black forest cake (he is extremely picky) when I came across this one. I can honestly say that this is one of the best frosting recipes I have ever used. The cream cheese is not over powering, yet you still get that cream cheese flavor. It also has the whipped cream like texture without "melting" so quickly. This frosting along with his cake have now become he yearly birthday cake.

I followed the recipe and added a tiny bit of fresh lemon juice and a little fresh grated lemon peel and it turned out perfectly.  This is the best cream cheese frosting I've ever eaten.  I used in on Sam's Favorite Carrot Cake.  Yum yum.

This is a light and very lovely icing. My 5 year old son loved it! I found it helpful to have the cream cheese at room temperature, it was very easy to whip. The end result was smooth icing with no lumps.

Really nice frosting if you tweak the recipe a bit as others have noted.  Used less then a cup (approx. 3/4) of whipping cream and this held up very well.  Also, chill for about 20-30 min. before using and it can be used well on a double layer cake.  I used this with a strawberry compote in the center and a chocolate ganache topping and it did not fall or melt.

Very nice topping, my advice is to smooth the cream cheese with a little less sugar, then fold in the cream. And add a small amount of lemon rind or citrus extract.

I ust made this icing on the weekend to go with some made from-scratch red velvet cupcakes. It was one of the BEST icings I have ever tasted. I read alot of the comments on here and was hesitant to try it, as I wanted to pipe the icing onto my cupcakes, and many comments said that his icing was not stiff enough. Mine came out perfct! To get the icing thick enouh to pipe, I suggest using a package of whip cream stabalizer like "Whip It" (in the bakling isle at the grocery store follow the package directions). Your whipping cream will not fall, and the icing will hold up for a few days with refridgeration. Excellet Recipe!

The frosting tastes really good. It's one of the best..I think. I have made 10 different kinds of frosting and I would say this is one of my top 3. But I have to agree with the others..it came out clumpy. But I will try it again. I think the cream cheese wasn't warm enough and I didn't beat it long enough. oh I also used 1/2 a cup of sugar and 1cup of icing sugar instead of 1 cup  of white sugar.

Followed directions with some of the advice of other reviewers: chilled whipping cream bowl, used my food processor to cream the cream cheese and sugar for about 10 minutes, whipped the whipping cream until very, very stiff.  I added food coloring to my cream cheese mixture to make the color I needed.  It was wonderful!  My hubby who NEVER eats cake icing said if I made his birthday cake with this, he would definitely eat it.  Not too sweet and a great compliment to chocolate cake.

I absolutely love cream cheese and cool whip and this icing is purely delicious! But unfortunately for me I didn't have any vanilla extract so instead I put in two teaspoons of sour cream and a pinch of ground cinnamon and it still came out well! :)

It tastes great. I made the whipped cream and the other ingredients in separate bowls like suggested, but the consistency was still not what I was hoping. Maybe after either freezing it or chilling it for a while it will set up like I want. I also added some meringue powder (I use it in my buttercream to create a stiffer icing).

This is my go-to recipe for whipped icing. I just substitute the vanilla extract for any desired artificial flavoring. Everyone loves it and I love it because it is not too sweet!

This recipe was great. I used it on top of pumpkin muffins. Thanks for the tip of using beatters that do not contain any oils. I thought mine were clean but the whipping cream was not getting stiff, so I hand washed them and dried them with a paper towel. I thought that it piped very well. This was the perfect blend of whipped and cream cheese. I will so use the again and again.

Best frosting ever! I've been making this recipe for a year but forgot to review till I printed it for a friend today. I've had good results every time but 1. (I was too rushed to whip the cream properly-lesson learned.) It's even been piped on cupcakes that had to be transported on a hot day. Everyone who tries it, loves it!

Very yummy frosting! I used this to frost 24 Red Velvet Cupcakes that I also got from this website. I did use 1 C confectioners sugar instead of the regular kind. I also creamed my cream cheese first at room temperature, then added the rest of the ingredients. I had to stick it back into the fridge for about 20 minutes before using to frost. I used a large star tip to pipe it onto the cupcakes then back into the fridge. I do not recommend this frosting if its going to be outside in the heat.

Absolutely amazing. I took the advice of another and chilled my bowl (and even my beaters) before beating the whipping cream. I brought it to a very thick consisteny to avoid runniness. I then beat my cream cheese combo together (in a warm bowl) and then folded in my whipped cream. This is the perfect combination. I don't like the rich flavor or thick consistency of regular cream cheese frostings and I don't like the lack of flavor in just a whipped topping. This is the best of both worlds.

Based on the reviews I used powdered sugar and modified the amounts of whipping cream & powdered sugar. I chilled my whipped cream bowl and I brought my cream cheese to room temp. I folded the two together. This frosting did not keep it's shape on cupcakes for long. The flavor is amazing and it would be good on a sheet cake but anything you are adding depth to I would not recommend this frosting. I should also note I used whip-it stabilizer and it still didn't hold.  Also... I had planned on adding color to my frosting and it's impossible with this recipe. It u handle it to much after you fold the two together it gets runny :(

This frosting was absolutely delicious. I followed others suggestions and used powdered sugar instead of white sugar. And I chilled my mixing bowl and beaters. This was delicious without being super sweet. Complimented my red velvet cupcakes perfectly. Will definitely make again I will never buy cream cheese icing again. Thanks so much for this recipe

Amazing! Just made this to frost my husband's red velvet birthday cake and it came out great! I did use 1 3/4 cups confectioner's sugar as suggested by others and chilled my bowl and whisk attachment before whipping the cream. Not sure it would be great to pipe with this the way it is, but since I didn't make it for that, I was very satisfied! (Also tried dipping a strawberry in as someone else had suggested and that was even better!)

I have totally cheated when I ran out of time I use a container of cool whip. I took the package of cheese out and put it in my bowl with a splash of vanilla ( I used FF with both cheese and whip and it was still super delicious) then when it was call warm and soft in the bowl I add my whip a little at a time with the mixer on low. If it is really warm out add a T at a time of confectioners sugar to help it get a bit stiffer otherwise it is super good!!!!!

I have always made this frosting by mixing the sugar and flavorings into the softened cream cheese and just adding the whipping cream and beating it for about 4 minutes, no seporate bowls no folding, it has always worked for over 20 years!

This frosting was amazing!  I can't take sweet frostings so I'm always looking for a lighter, less sugary solution.  This was a perfect match for my taste buds!  The only thing I did differently was to add and blend in one packet of dream whip to the cream cheese, sugar, salt, and vanilla extract.  I then folded those ingredients in with my already prepared whipping cream.  I don't know if adding the dream whip makes this frosting more "pipeable" but the frosting I made would definitely pipe very well.  I also agree that this would make an excellent fruit dip.  Definitely a keeper!

Bottom line, this is not a frosting, it is a cream cheese whipped topping. I give it a 4 for the taste and a 1 for the consistency, because it started melting as soon as i put it in the piping bag! I thought it was because I used confectioners sugar instead of white sugar (for fear of it being grainy), but after reading the reviews-everyone who gave it a low rating was due to it being runny. I think this is something you would use as a topping for Belgium waffles. Since it has a good flavor, I will keep it and tweak it. Hopefully I can get it to a frosting consistency. If not...waffles anyone???

I substituted 1 3/4 C Powdered Sugar as someone suggested and this frosting came out perfect.  I used it to ice my daughters birthday cake.  To make sure that it didn't slide off on me I did a very light layer of icing first and let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before I added the rest of the icing to it, and then back in the the fridge it went.  I will definitely use this recipe again!!!

This is very light and airy. Perfect- for the cake recipe I used on this site. (Sam's famous carrot cake) A dense cake, and a light frosting. YUM! I used half substitute sugar, half white sugar. Will be using this again!

This is a lighter, fluffier, airier cream cheese frosting. Actually, I would categorize this as more of a whipped cream topping, with cream cheese flavor.  The consistency was very soft and fluffy.  I'm not sure it would hold up well as a filling between cake layers (I imagine it would collapse under the weight). The whipped cream should be reduced if you are going to pipe or fill a cake. I would like to note that I used less sugar, and slightly softened cream cheese (although the directions did not state to use softened cream cheese). This may have affected my results. The flavor was very good. It was great on chocolate cupcakes &  a nice, lighter alternative to heavy chocolate frosting. Please note that this is not that thick, classic cream cheese frosting typically used on carrot cake.

Love this!!! Make sure your cream cheese is softened to room temp and no lumps. Also using 1 1/2 to 3/4 powdered sugar instead of reg. sugar makes these pipe out great. Store them in the fridge and just bring to room temp before serving!

first and foremost the taste is awesome. My mistake did not let cream cheese sit out a bit to soften up. got a little lumpy.  i will make  again and use whipped cream cheese maybe.

I was looking or a substitute for buttercream frosting and this is just perfect. I used less cream cheese for a more subtle taste. I whipped the cream then added to the cheese mixture with a drop of pink color. I used confectioner's sugar to avoid the grainy texture. The consistency was perfect and piped easily onto cupcakes.

I think I know why some of you have trouble with the consistency of the cream. I think it has to do with the brand of whipping cream. I have made this recipe thrice previously using a particular brand of whip cream and it was perfect for piping. Today I used another brand of cream as I didn't have time to go to my usual supplier and it was way too runny I had to abandon the lot. Guess that means you just have to experiment on a few brands to find one that works! And when you do, this recipe is superb!

SO EASY! Im no dessert chef by any means but I felt like one when I made this. It was so easy and everyone that tried it LOVED it. I followed the recipe how its read and had no problems whatsoever. I was really skeptical after reading through the other reviews...but was pleasantly surprised. Came out nice and fluffy and not too sweet or overwhelmingly creamy cheese flavored.

This is the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had.  My family loved it too.  We put it on brownies - light, fluffy and delicious!  I will use this in all my recipes calling for cream cheese frosting from now on.

Great recipe but you have to tweak it a bit because it's a little too runny. I used Dr. Oetker Whip It Stabilizer. I bought mine from World Market but you can also order them online through amazon.  Whip It made it a little thicker and stabilized the whipped cream from melting. I added a couple of tablespoon of butter to help the consistency.  It was the best cream cheese topping I ever made. It's so light and not too sweet nor too buttery. I can eat more cupcakes with this topping because it's not too heavy.

This recipe is similar to the "Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting" on this site but I think I prefer this one better.  The smaller amount of whipping cream makes the difference and I like these directions better.  I probably should have read some of the reviews before I started and whipped this longer to make it more stiff.  But I'll know for next time.  I've topped this on "Crazy Cake" from this site and works amazing!

We found that making sure the whipping cream was good and stiff. We were able to add color and flavor and make a great banana flavor.   We added butter extract instead of vanilla extract to the cream cheese and banana extract to the whipping cream. My sister is our resident cake expert and this frosting was excellent!

So delicious!  The only thing I would recommend is that when you go to fold the whipped cream in, use a whisk.  I had a difficult time blending the thick cream cheese mixture in with the whipped cream, but once I used a whisk it blended right in!  This recipe gives you the taste of cream cheese frosting, without the heavy texture.  AWESOME!

I used the chilled whisk beater and bowl method.  I halved the recipe, which was barely enough for the cupcakes from one box of cake mix.  I substituted fat free cream cheese, and 3/4 c powdered sugar, and added 1/8 tsp of cornstarch. Making sure it stayed chilled, I piped it easily with my icing gun, but I wasn't doing fine details.  I liked that the frosting was light and fluffy tasting, less heavy than buttercream, but it was very delicate (doesn't stiffen as butter does).  Turned out fine, just had to be careful when handling the finished product.

Used this icing on a carrot cake and on a lemon layer cake.  The only change I made was replaced the sugar with 1 1/2 c. of powdered sugar and used very cold bowls and beaters.  This icing needs to set up in the refrigerator before use.  It is fantastic!!

I think the problem with this icing is the use of white sugar instead of powder sugar. If you use 1 cup of powder sugar instead, it has a much better consistency.

My husband does not like buttercream so for his birthday I made the Almond Wedding Cake posted by another used, put seedless raspberry jelly between the layers and topped it with this icing. It was heaven! My friend even broke her diet for it and said it was completely worth it!

Excellent and delicious!!!  I used powdered sugar instead of white sugar.  I chilled the bowl and whisk first, mostly because I was in a hurry and wanted the whipped cream to set-up faster.  I frosted about 20 red velvet cupcakes and then ate the leftover frosting right out of the bowl.  SO GOOD!!!

The frosting turned out great on chocolate cake.  It is a soft frosting, and i didn't have any problems with it.  I did only use one cup of whipping cream, because that's all I had, maybe that helped.  Next time, I will try it on a carrot cake.  Yum!

Easy and delicious! I followed another recipe first, and the whipped cream broke and practically became butter. It is key that the whipped cream remain separated until it's folded in.

SO GOOD! Ate so much of it without the cupcake! I left the cream cheese out on the counter for about an hour, omitted the salt and used 1 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar instead of regular white sugar. Tasted exactly like the cream cheese frosting used at a local cupcake store. So delicious and so easy!

This is excellent! The texture is light and fluffy for a cream cheese frosting. I whip the cream until it is like fluffy clouds. The hint of salt is adds a nice balance. I use this on the "Strawberry Dream" cake because the white chocolate frosting that is on that recipe is too sweet.

Absolute best frosting I've ever had. I don't know about everyones reviews about it being runny because all I did was ice a flat 9x12 inch carrot cake. What I DO know is that it is amazingly delicous. I made it with my sister and we couldn't stop "taste-testing" it. I was afraid there wouldn't be enough for the cake! ;)

Really good recipe, came out nice and fluffy.  Did work well for piping.  This is not an icing you can lay decorations on, though - especially fondant decorations.  They slid right off. I added a bit of orange flavoring and iced the Dark Chocolate Cake I from Allrecipes and the combo was delicious!

This frosting is amazing!  I read through lots of reviews and here's what worked for me:  I whipped the cream in a cold metal bowl and put it back in the fridge.  I mixed the rest of ingredients, then added the whipped cream a little at a time until it looked/tasted good to me.  I did not use all the whipped cream.  I think 1 cup of whipped cream might work.  I could not stop tasting it and it's awesome on Frosted Banana Bars on this site!!

Fantastic recipe! Made for use on a yellow cake topped with berries (the 4th of July flag cake). Much better than the traditional Cool Whip topping. Had to search for a different frosting as the country I'm currently living in does not sell Cool Whip. Everything turned out perfectly and it set up nicely in the fridge. No problems with lumps. Added a little extra vanilla extract to the whipping cream. The recipe makes quite a bit of frosting, so we have been dunking strawberries into the excess frosting.

This frosting was sooo good.  I don't usually like frosting very much but I was eating this plain.  My sister was able to pipe it out (we did use powdered sugar, not granulated), but we don't think it would hold up as a wedding cake out on a table all day (it seemed like it would melt).  It is light and not too sweet.

These were great!!! We didn't have any powdered sugar so I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for powdered sugar, and I found this! This was easy to make and it tastes great. It seemed to runny when I was making it but it thickened up and then worked like a charm.

This frosting was a hit at my God Daughters 1st birthday. Very light and great taste.  And it looked real good on the other baby when she knocked the little cake off the highchair and all over her head!

As reviewers instructed, I whipped the cream in a separate bowl, then did the (room temperature) cream cheese mixture in a separate bowl and it worked great. No problems with lumps.    I made the recipe as is.  After sitting in my car for the one hour commute to work, it was so soft and runny that it was a complete mess trying to pipe it onto cupcakes.  The flavor is good, a bit sweet-I wouldn't use this on an already sweet cake-and the recipe is easy to follow, but if you are going to let this sit out at work or at a potluck, look for reviews that discuss how to make the frosting more stable, and chill the frosting before using.

This is a great base as it comes out very smooth, but it doesn't pipe well at all. I followed the directions exactly. It does taste fantastic, but I'd rather it pipe.

This frosting is FANTASTIC! I use it all the time now for every single cupcake I make. The first time I made it, it was slightly runny. I cut down on the cream to 1 cup and whipped it for longer than normal, and it turned out amazing! Everyone that tries it, loves it. Thank you for the great recipe!!!

This is a fabulously light frosting, and it saved my otherwise dreary little cupcakes.  It was perfect for piping with the 1 3/4 powdered sugar substitution instead of regular sugar that was recommended by another user!!

yum!  I'm generally not a big fan of cream cheese frosting but this is delicious!  I was looking for a recipe to top a carrot cake but wanted something different than regular cream cheese frosting...and this is just what I was looking for.  The whipped cream mellows out the "cheese" and the texture is nice.  I left the cream cheese at room temp for a bit before making.  I made step 2 first (I beat the cream cheese by itself for a minute or two to get the lumps out before adding sugar etc) and placed in fridge while I made step 1. Really whip the cream so it isn't soft or runny, you want a stiff whipped cream.  I used chilled bowls for each mixture (yes, two bowls, or wash in between steps) and combined quickly and the texture was fine not runny at all.  I bet this would make a nice fruit dip too.  give it a try!!

Great recipe.  I have made it with both the white sugar and confectioner's sugar.  Both are good, but it is much smoother with confectioner's sugar.  I would use between 1 1/2 and 2 cups confectioner's sugar depending on your taste preferences.  You must whip the cream first with VERY stiff peaks.  Set aside and whip up cream cheese mixture very well.  Whip together and refrigerate mixture for an hour or more and it is substantial enough to frost a cake with! No problems with lumps or it being runny.  If it is too runny, the frosting got too warm or whipped cream was not stiff enough.

Very good-exactly what I was looking for! Quick and easy and set up perfectly! I used splenda instead of sugar and used it to frost Cream Cake from this site. To keep it simple and let my son have some fun, he topped it with sprinkles-will use again, thanks!

This is great frosting! I noticed for a lot of people it didn't work and this is because they didn't properly cool their ingredients before they started because I had the same problem until I followed what some of the other reviews said about chilling my ingredients. Its a great light and fluffy, and sweet(but not too sweet) frosting

it was pretty time-consuming and I really didnt think it was worth the effort put in. I will, however, say that I was very happy to find a recipe that my baby could enjoy for her first birthday and that was a lot healthier than those made with shortening or with butter. I did use powdered sugar, so I would suggest adding more sugar if you are replacing with powdered. Thanks for sharing it!

Pretty good stuff! Used it with the red velvet cake recipe (by eleanor) on this site. Came out great and although it's not buttercream consistency, I was able to make a nice shell border on my cake and it cam out very pretty. Will use this again!

It was whipped as promised but not as great as I had hoped.  Tasted a bit strange...maybe because I paired it with a cake that did not turn out so great either.

This frosting is so delicious! Not too sweet & not too "cheesy". Gave it 5 stars with the substitution of powdered sugar for granulated sugar. I substituted 1 3/4 cup powdered sugar for 1 cup granulated sugar & it was perfect. I chilled the beaters, bowl & heavy cream while I was preparing dinner & left the cream cheese on the counter to soften. I beat the heavy cream in its bowl for about 8-10 mins til it was thick & fluffy with several peaks, then placed bowl back in fridge. I then washed the beaters & beat the remaining ingredients(powdered sugar, cream cheese, vanilla, salt) in separate bowl for 8-10 mins. I placed that bowl of ingredients in the fridge along with the whipped heavy cream for about 10-15 mins while completing dinner. I took out both & folded the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until well blended. Oh my goodness! I could have eaten the frosting straight from the bowl it was so delicious. :) I placed the finished frosting back in the fridge overnight to chill. I am using the frosting on a white cake made from a recipe on this site. The frosting made enough to frost 2-9" round cakes. This was definitely a yummy, yummy frosting & highly recommended. The key to getting the thickness for piping uses is to substitute powdered sugar for white/granulated sugar & refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. I wouldn't recommend attempting to pipe this after immediately making because it needs time to chill.

I'm not a big fan of the heavier cream cheese frostings, but I absolutely loved this lighter one! I used it to frost a round strawberry layer cake and had no problems with it running off the sides of the cake. I did follow a lot of advice from other reviewers - I made sure that the cream cheese was at room temperature, whipped the cream until it was extra stiff, and made sure to keep the whipped cream very cold. I refrigerated the icing for about 30 minutes before spreading it on the cake. Delicious!

Oh holy yumminess!!  This was a GREAT frosting recipe.  I tried it in 3 variations.  1. The original-- scrumptious! 2. With lemon extract added-- was okay, but not great. 3. With extra vanilla-- you can't go wrong with this either, it was yummy.  4. (Yes, saving the best for last) With 8 pureed strawberries (skinned so there were no seeds), 2 tablespoons strawberry syrup, and 1 cup yoplait strawberry yogurt mixed together and then folded into the original frosting recipe-- to die for!!!  (I justify this as a healthy alternative because it has the cream = dairy, strawberries = fruit, yogurt = dairy... yes, I'm bad!)  This recipe get's 5 stars because the original version is GREAT and it is even better with the strawberry additions above and served over angel food cake or angel food cupcakes.  TAHNK YOU Tom for sharing this keeper!

Delicious frosting. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect! I would like to mention that you need to whip the cream in a chilled bowl until STIFF. I put it in the freezer to keep cold while I mixed the other ingredients. I mixed the other ingredients for at least 5 min maybe more. That will smooth out the cream cheese and the sugar wont be grainy. No need to make the cream cheese room temp. Don't be afraid to over beat the cream cheese. If you follow these two things you will have a wonderful frosting that is easy to spread and pipe. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I really enjoyed the light and fluffy taste of this frosting recipe.  The frosting was not runny at all.  I whipped the cream on high in a stand mixer for a few minutes while I mixed the other ingredients thoroughly.  Then I added the cram cheese mixture to the whipped cream and mixed it all very well in the mixer.  I think the trick is to mix the cream longer so that it is very thick.  I put this on top of carrot cake and it was very yummy!  I think that I might even use this recipe for a dip for fruit! Thank you for the recipe!!!

Holy Cow this was fantastic!!  No more store bought stuff for us, this recipe is the one for our family.   I had none of the problems that other viewers mentioned.  The next time I make this I do want to try it with powdered sugar instead and see what the difference is (if any).  Again, awesome!!

I put this cream cheese frosting on a Duncan Hines Decadent Carrot Cake(better than I can make from scratch), and it was just perfect.  I made it just like the recipe and kept the cake in the refrigerator after frosting.  Yummmmm!

This icing was phenomenal!  It is NOT your traditional thick and pasty cream cheese icing, but a nice, light and fluffy topping. It worked great piped using a 1M tip onto my chocolate cupcakes.  I chilled both the cupcakes and the frosting prior to decorating. I did add a 1/2 cup of cocoa to match the chocolate, but it still worked out great!

Im giving this a 2 star cause the original recipe didnt work for me. Too runny and was grainy from the white sugar. I made changes and it turned out wonderful.  I wont use any other frosting again.  I used 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar instead of white sugar and reduced heavy cream to 1 cup. Much better. This was creamy and mild in sweetness, which means it will go with any cake without over powering it.  I havnt tried piping it, but it was holding its shape when i frosted my Chocolate Suprise Cupcakes.(from this site, its a must try)  It might be to airy for piping, but i bet you could get away with doing a border.  Yumm Yumm.

This was nice, though not as strong of  a cream cheese taste as I would prefer. To prepare, I whipped the cream cheese/sugar mixture for several minutes (to aerate the cream and dissolve the sugar), then removed from bowl, more or less, and added the very cold cream. I whipped the cream and then folded the two together. I noticed that after chilling, the frosting held up very well. I frosted the cake with chilled frosting. I am going to make this again, and I do agree that powdered sugar (1 3/4 cups or so) would be even better for stability.

Awesome!  Just a hint of cream cheese in a light, fluffy frosting.  I added two tablespoons of meringue powder so I could pipe it.  I piped it onto brownie bites and it looked as yummy as it tasted.

This frosting was sooo tasty.  It had a great texture and just the right amount of every ingredient.  I used fat free cream cheese and confectioners sugar.  I was trying to cut down on the fat, because who needs any extra, right???  Anyway, this was awesome frosting and I will definitely make it again.

This is a really great cream cheese frosting.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I frosted a 3 layer cake and was able to add a couple drops of food color and PIPE on some decorations.  Some reviews said you could only frost a flat cake, that is not so.

This was my first attempt at making frosting and boy am I glad I chose this recipe!  The flavor was amazing and it was pretty easy to make.  I chilled my mixing bowl and beaters before whipping cream, and let cream cheese get close to room temp.  I also let the frosting chill overnight before using.  It was the perfect consistancy for me to be able to frost a cake.  I would definitely make this again and again!

Best homemade cream cheese frosting!! Did not alter anything.  Made sure that  whipping cream was really stiff before combining with other ingrediants.  I think I beat it on medium speed for 10 minutes.

Thought it was a bit thin but after putting in the regrigerator, it was awesome!  I LOVED the texture and taste.  Made it with a boxed confetti cake for a birthday and it was terrific!  I will always use this recipe whenever possible.  I think it will be perfect with a "Velvet" cake!

Delicious and unique, this frosting has a lightness about it that is most-pleasing!  I used it to frost and fill 3 layers of Strawberry Cake from Scratch, found on this site.  Three things to point out:  be sure to thoroughly chill (in freezer) the bowl and whip you will use to beat the cream; the cream cheese should be at room temperature before beating; I used powdered sugar.  I will definitely make this frosting again, and I think it would be wonderful on several different kinds of cakes.

Simply one of the best frosting I've tried. Anyone whom I served it to, loved it as well. It's a favorite on carrot cake or chocolate cake. But quite frankly it's good enough to eat by the spoon.

I love this recipe! This was my first attempt at making frosting and I was thrilled by how successful it was. I used 1 3/4 cup powdered sugar as suggested by other reviewers and cut the cream down to one cup. I did not pipe it; I used it to fill and ice Sam's Famous Carrot Cake (from this site), and it looked beautiful spread on the cake. The taste was unbelieveable; light, fluffy, and absolutely delicious. I got lots of compliments!

This was FABULOUS!!  Not to sweet, light and fluffy.  Thanks to the reviewer "niferp" for the great techniques in making this.  I have made other whipped frostings and didn't realize I needed to "stabilize" the heavy whipping cream.  I also followed her other suggestions for cold bowl and beaters, and warm cream cheese.  I halved the recipe to frost 12 cupcakes (Fluffy Banana Cake recipe) and had plenty of frosting left over.  I will definitely make this again!!

The frosting is fairly tasty.  I prefer it over the tradition version of cream cheese icing.  However, a recent reviewer recommended adding unflavored gelatin to the whipping cream.  I highly recommend doing that.  Unlike her, I usually add the powdered gelatin to the cream as it is whipping.  Sure, when you taste the whipped cream immediately afterwards, the texture is a bit grainy.  However, as the whipping cream sits, I have found that the grainy texture diminishes as the gelatin absorbs liquid.  I did try the previous reviewer's method whereby she dissolved the gelatin powder in boiling water prior to combining it with the cream.  I do not prefer this method, as the cream doesn't seem to become as fluffy.  I suspect it has something to do with the water that is added with the gelatin.  Thanks for sharing.

This was great. I like my frostings a little sweeter, so I added about 1/3 c more sugar. I also increased the cream cheese by 1/2 of another package to thicken it up a little. Whipping the cream in a separate chilled bowl really helped. Also, be sure to FOLD the two mixtures together with a spatula... don't beat with a mixer. I'm using this as both a filling and frosting for chocolate cupcakes.

Absolutey delicious!!!! Finally a frosting that doesn't give you the impression that you're eating sugar with a spoon!  I followed the tips others reviewers gave (placing bowl, beaters and cream in freezer to chill) and got the most amazing frosting ever!  if you follow the instructions and tips you'll get a perfect frosting that won't overpower your cake.  You can frost a million things with this.  Oh, one more thing, once I'd frosted my cake I had no choice but to place plastic wrap over it to place in the fridge and I was a bit sad to have to 'lose' some of this delicious frosting to the plastic wrap afterwards....BUT when I uncovered it later to eat more, it didn't stick to the wrap!  Amazing!  So we were able to eat ALL of the frosting.  Definitely makes a lot of it!  
Thanks for this fabulous recipe!!!!!

The only reason I'm not rating this recipe higher is because I think it is definitely best to make significant adjustments. Here is what I do:
8 oz cream cheese
1 c. whipping cream
1/4 -1/2 c powdered sugar (depending on how sweet I want it - adjust to your preferred sweetness).
1/8 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla

I whip the cream in my kitchen aid mixer, then put that in a separate bowl.  I then blend the cream cheese until smooth, adding the whipped cream back in a little at a time.  Mix with other ingredients until well combined.

I always chill it for a little bit before using, and it is stiff enough for decorative accents around the edges of the cake -yum!!

The perfect cupcake frosting!  After reading the reviews of this recipe here, I decided to use 12 ounces of Cream Cheese instead of the 8 the recipe called for hoping that would keep the frosting thicker.  I used two separate bowls for mixing my ingredients (one for whipping the cream and one for the other ingredients) and kept everything very cold until I was ready to mix.  It turned out thicker than a simple whipped cream frosting and very easy to spread over my cupcakes. It is lighter than a traditional buttercream, though. My daughter has already declared this her favorite frosting and expects a birthday cake covered with it in February! Thanks for this one!

I used this recipe to frost a two layer round chocolate cake and it came out wonderful!!! I got many complements on the cake and frosting. I doubled all the ingredients in this recipe and took a short-cut on the whipped cream by using one small tub of cool whip in it's place..... make sure you are going to double it if you use a whole tub. I love this and will use it again. It was plenty thick to pipe with as well! Thank you!

Fantastic! When I started whipping the cream cheese, it was not quite at room temperature, but it warmed up in the process of whipping and I had no texture problem.  I've added a 1/4 of a vial of Dr. O's lemon flavouring. Also, once I've folded the whipped cream into the cream cheese mix, I whipped the frosting for about 30 seconds on medium.  It's important NOT TO OVERWHIP it, so you have to pay attention.  The flavour was fantastic, the texture silky, and it worked wonderfully with sponge cake and strawberries. And no, this recipe will not work for piping purposes.

I LOVE this frosting! By far the best one I have found. Im not sure why everyone is having problems with it.. it has come out great for me everytime. Im making 2 cakes for easter and plan to decorate them with flowers and a border and I know I wont have any problem with it. I chilled my bowl and whisk beater then beat the whipping cream on low speed and slowly went up to the highest speed.

I've never reviewed a recipe before.  After reading some of the reviews for this I had to respond.  This is a marvelous recipe!!!  I have made it many times and have never had a problem with the frosting being runny.  I chill my bowl and beaters before beating the whipping cream.  I mix the cream cheese and sugar in a separate bowl, and then fold them together.  I have always got a light, fluffy WONDERFUL frosting that could be easily piped.

This was a very tasty recipe that wasn't too sweet, but like another reviewer, I had the problem of it being too runny when I spread it on the cake.  When I was whipping it, I had nice, stiff peaks, but once I started scooping it and spreading it, it started to get runny.  From a different whipped topping recipe, I decided to dissolve some gelatin and mix it in.  Then I fridged it for a couple of hours.  That seemed to help.  I would also recommend storing it uncovered so that it "dries out" a little and gets thicker.  Maybe it was b/c I used lite cream cheese?  I'm not sure why.  But end result, after some tweaking, was yummy.  Quite rich; a little goes a long way!

I used this recipe with the Chocolate Cake II on this site.  It was lovely. I made it for a colleague's birthday and it disappeared pretty quickly for an office where each person wants "a really small piece". I used a raspberry filling in between layers - Delicious.  I did chill my bowl and beaters and used confectioner's sugar with no consistency issues.  I had to force myself to not eat what was left in the bowl after topping the cake.

Used this on my daughter's first birthday cake.  I was wonderful!  Didn't have to change a thing.  I couldn't stop eating the frosting.  Everyone thought the frosting was great.  I am known for my cakes but this frosting made my cake even better!  Actually, it made people comment more on the frosting than the cake I am always getting requests for!

This frosting was excellent!  The whipped cream helped make the cream cheese mixture not to be too sweet.  Made it for a carrot cake but it would be perfect on a chocolate cake as well! Thanks Tom!

This is a very good recipe.  I used powdered sugar instead of regular because I was concerned how it would hold up.  I think next time I make it, Iâll cut down on the whipped cream so that more of the cream cheese flavor comes through.

Excellent frosting recipe!  It has just a hint of sweetness from the cream cheese so it's not overpowering.  This is the best frosting recipe I have ever made.  It got high reviews from family too.  Thanks for sharing!!!

EXCELLENT! I opted to make it low-fat style. I used reduced fat cream cheese and Cool Whip instead of the heavy whipping cream. It came out delicious--wonderful cream cheese flavor, but a lighter, airier feel! My new favorite!

This is simply heavenly!  I am not really a frosting fan, but this is the best.  So fattening, but so good.  I just made it and put it on carrot cake and it was good beyond words.  Unfortunately, I ate almost the whole thing by myself.

This is a very light tasting frosting.  I used powdered sugar instead of white sugar to help with sturdiness.  Not super sweet like other frostings and super tasty!  I've used this on pumpkin cake, chocolate cake, and lime custard cupcakes.  As written, the recipe generously frosts 12 standard cupcakes (actually, I probably had enough to frost 16 cupcakes total if I had them).  For the lime custard cupcakes, I also added lemon extract instead of vanilla.

I made this with regular cool whip instead of whipped cream and only used 3/4 cup of confectioner's sugar.  I thought it was delicious, very light and had a whipped texture but still had that cream cheese taste.  It was perfect, not as heavy as the normal frosting on a carrot cake.  I had no problems with it being runny, as other reviews have commented.

Served with superlatives! This is the best cream cheese frosting ever to touch one of my carrot cakes. As a diabetic, I am always looking for ways to cut back on calories and sugar. I beat the cream cheese with 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda. Then folded in light Cool Whip in place of the whipped cream. The texture was airy, and the frosting could be applied thickly, lending an impressive presentation, but never overwhelming either in flavor or texture. A+++++!!

I used almond extract because I didn't have vanilla and it was excellent.  I will be using this for a long time.  I got a recipe off of this site for the chocolate cake mixed with canned cherries (cherry pie filling) and it was unbelievably good.   Great icing.

Don't listen to the negative reviewers!  This frosting is wonderful, all you have to do is follow the directions.
1.  Whip the cream until stiff peaks form- that means STIFF!!  It was pretty thick stuff, almost like butter when I was done with it.
2.  white sugar= granulated "white" sugar, NOT powdered sugar.  If it was powdered sugar, don't you think it would say "powdered sugar"?
I'll admit it is a little hard to "fold in" the cream mixture after you whip your cream so stiff, I used my beaters.

Easy and delicious.  The recipe did not specify granulated or powdered sugar.  I used powdered sugar.  Also, I "lightened" the cream cheese mixture with a bit of the whipped cream before folding the two parts together--this worked like a charm.  It was easy to use--neither too thick or too thin.  Once the cake was iced, the frosting held up for several hours at room temperature.  It kept several more days covered in the fridge.  The flavor is simply scrumptious.

Yummy! I put this on a strawberry cake -- can't wait to try it on lemon and chocolate too. It's so creamy and not too sweet at all. I chilled the bowl before whipping the cream (experienced bakers have told me this helps), and I also immediately returned the whipped cream to the refrigerator while I mixed the other ingredients. The frosting spread very easily with a spatula. Thank you, Tom!

I just made the "A Number 1 Banana Cake" found on this website and used this frosting with it.  It came out great!  I refridgerated the whipped cream while I was making the cream cheese portion and then put it back in the fridge after everything was folded in for about 10 minutes as suggested by some other reviewers.  The consistency was excellent.  It makes a lot of frosting, I think maybe a little too much for a 9 x 13 cake, but I will just eat the excess with a spoon (or maybe dip some strawberries into it!).  I will be using this recipe again and again!  THANKS!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!
I used 1 cup cream, and refrigerated for 15 min before using (some users found this icing to be runny), and it was picture perfect on the chocolate cake that I made. This is a keeper for sure. Two thumbs up for Tom!

The frosting turned out divine! You have to have patience when beating the heavy whipped cream it takes about 7-10 min depending on the speed of your mixer.  If cream cheese is too hard, put in microwave about 15 sec's.  After i made it i put it in the fridge for a few minutes before i spread it on carrot cake recipe i made from this web site. The frosting totally made the cake!

This has got to be the best cream cheese icing I have ever tried!  It is perfect!  I already have the recipe memorized, and will use it over and over again.  Be sure to freeze your bowl and beaters for the whipped cream, it makes all the difference.

This is THE frosting to use!! I got such compliments on it!I made it w/ Strawberry Cake 2 I believe from this site (which ever one said mashed strawberries in it), I followed the directions exactly, but added some red food coloring to make it pink (I made a double layer heart shaped cake).  It came out perfect!  We all really DID lick the bowl too!

Excellent! Very nice texture... those saying it cannot be piped might not be whipping their whipping cream stiff enough.  Love the lightly sweet flavor.

This is a great tasting whipped frosting. In Germany, where I grew up, whipped topping was what we always used in our home. I remember my grandmother putting her bowls and beaters in the freezer ahead of time..it takes a little while making solid whipped topping, but I wouldn't use anything else on my Black Forrest Cake. The addition of cream cheese is absolute genius!!The Cream Cheese should be at absolute room temperature! Powdered Sugar seems to make it stiffer, but you get great results with regular Sugar as well, I tried both.
 I am reviewing this recipe just by making it as posted and it was a huge hit and has become a favorite in my family. 10/18/2018...Once again, I made this frosting. It came out perfect, like it has done time and time before!

I used confectioners sugar rather than granulated and the icing tastes amazing. I am left missing the kind of crunchy shell regular icing gets, but I think that's all whipped icings.

LOVE this frosting. If u can use real vanilla beans - itâs worth the splurge bc the flavor was AMAZING. If u canât, using high quality PURE vanilla extract is a must (donât use imitation vanilla). . I needed to double this recipe but chose NOT to double the cream cheese bc I didnât want the cream cheese flavor since I was making chocolate cupcakes.  Turned out EXCELLENT.

We love this recipe!!! I've played with it a bunch and never had problems. Used different kind of extract like orange, strawberry and almond. All was good. I even have added cocoa powder to make it chocolate. I can pipe this with no problems, occasionally I feel its to soft to pipe but I just pop it in the fridge for a while to "harden" the cream cheese back up. Its the best and not overly sweet.

I made as written but used 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar instead of the granulated.   The consistency was perfect.    The flavor was super cream cheesy - my daugther liked it but said that it would be a good spread on a fruit bagel.   I think this would be great on a carrot cake.    I however, used it to fill and frost a chocolate cake.   The end result was good and got compliments.    I will make it again but will cut the amount of cream cheese by half next time.

I think you should use powdered sugar, not white sugar.  Also, be sure the cake is COLD before icing it and refrigerate it after.

Made this for a lemon cake and substituted lemon zest for the vanilla.  Used 1 pint cream (bc I read the recipe wrong) and still turned out.  I 
used a zip top bag to pipe on lettering.  Totally a keeper.

This recipe is lighter and fluffier and more easily spread on the baked good(s)!  Using regular sugar instead of powdered makes it less sweet! Yum

I don't bake often or even make dessert, so this was my first frosting and it was amazing for a strawberry cake!

However this time around I am making this frosting for a red velvet cake and I don't feel like it's cream cheesey enough. I'm thinking about adding more cream cheese to it (I made a huge batch). Could I potentially add butter and confectioner's sugar into it as well (mix in a different bowl and then fold in)? I'm not having issues with it being pipeable or firm enough but I just want it to be a litter cream cheesier and I'm not sure how to achieve this. Party is tomorrow! Any help is greatly appreciated :) TIA

This is a great recipe - I was careful to follow all the tips to make it stiff and it was, I had no problem with it being runny. However, I did have an issue with lumps - when I folded the whipped cream into the cream cheese mix, the cream cheese didn't incorporate as well as expected and I have lumps of cream cheese.  Any suggestions?  Not a huge deal, as it still tastes amazing, not overly sweet like most frostings, but it would be even better if it was smooth too!

Excellent lighter cream cheese frosting. I substituted the vanilla extract with almond extract.

Delicious!  I used this on a chiffon cake because I wanted something light that wouldn't weigh down the cake.  I used it between the layers and also on top, then I used royal icing flowers to decorate it, since this icing wouldn't work for piping.  The royal icing flowers softened up a little bit, but they still looked great on the cake, even 4 hours later, when it was served.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! I used this on a pumpkin birthday cake. It is truly delicious. I read reviews and was grateful. I followed chubbs advice and chilled my beaters and bowl and whipped my cream first. I also through my block of (light) cream cheese in the microwave for 10-15 seconds). I took another reviewers advice and swapped 1 3/4 c of powdered sugar for the granulated, then beat those together. After folding in the cream, I had the most wonderful cream cheese frosting ever! It would be very easy to pipe, not runny at all.

Yummy! Very Light and refreshing. Recently made this frosting for the one bowl chocolate cake. Everyone loved it! I added shaved chocolate made with a vegetable peeler as a garnish. I did not alter the recipe itself. It was great the way it was written and easy to follow. This will be a favorite request.

So amazing! It has a very nicely balanced flavor of cream cheese, and light as a cloud. I also used 1 3/4 cup of powdered sugar as others have mentioned. Powdered sugar has a hint of corn starch, which in turn stabilizes the whipped cream more. As you can see in the photo I posted, it piped beautifully! I even topped each cupcake with a whole strawberry! The strawberry did not fall off, or droop to the side. It stayed put - even through a 20 minute car ride on my lap! I also used the frosting to fill each cupcake... Used a small round cookie cutter to pop out the center of each, diced up strawberries, fold berries into the frosting to "thin it out" some, bagged it, piped it in the center, covered it with the cake cutout, piped on frosting (without the chopped strawberries), and topped with a whole strawberry. The end result - a lot of "ooohs and ahhhs" and many requests for the recipe.

The perfect combo! I've never been a big fan of cream cheese, but this was tasty. I put it on a yummy carrot cake, but this frosting stole the show.

So many compliments!!! I wanted to pipe the frosting onto cupcakes I was making for my daughters baby shower...I followed the recipe exactly and I couldn't have been more thrilled! It was the best tasting frosting, not too sweet and very light it had everyone asking for the recipe.

Delicious! Very balanced, not too sweet or cream cheesey. I used it to layer between white cake with strawberries. It went over amazingly. I'll definitely use it again and again.

I made this for a chocolate cake. Added 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder to make this as chocolate frosting. I agree with another reviewer that the cream cheese taste does dominate a little bit. I used NeufchÃ¢tel cheese. Since this is my time with this cheese I do not know if regular cream cheese would taste different. 
My daughter loved her birthday cake and I liked it too. Thank you!

Very good. I cut the cream down to 1 1/3 cups and it whipped nicely. I was able to cut the cake bars I was using it on immediately and the frosting stayed put nicely. I'll definitely make it again.

Best. Frosting. Ever.!! I'm not a frosting lover, I prefer plain cake, but this is absolutely amazing! Light, fluffy, not too sweet, perfect consistency. I doubled the recipe and frosted a chocolate layer cake with it. I can't wait to try it tomorrow with the cake.
Even my husband loves this frosting, and he is not a fan of sweet things at all. He took off with the bowl to lick it clean.

Oh, I did use powdered sugar instead of regular white sugar. I substituted 1 cup white sugar with 1 3/4 cup powdered sugar (and then doubled it since I doubled the recipe). I just thought the texture would be better with powdered sugar.

Anyway, this frosting is so good I would give it even more stars if it was possible.

Well here is what I do any time I use whipped cream in or on something.  Add some Dream Whip.  Start with a couple of tablespoons.  If it's still too soft add a bit more until it is like you want it.  That should set it up nicely, and it won't turn runny and soft for the rest of the day or longer!

For those of you who say this frosting is too runny: I think you may be confusing whipping cream with whipped cream. Whipping cream is also called heavy cream & is a liquid. Whipped cream is heavy cream that has been beaten until it is light & fluffy (like cool whip). This recipe calls for the whipping (heavy) cream to be beaten (step 1 of the instructions) before being folded into the cream cheese mixture.

YUMMMM....You'll want to lick the bowl, spoon and beaters!! 
Tips- Put whipping cream, a stainless bowl and beaters in the freezer for 15-20 min. before whipping. 
Cream cheese(@ room temp.) was mixed with vanilla and 1 heaping cup of powdered sugar instead (didn't want to chance it being grainy).
After whipping both separately, fold cheese mixture into whipped cream, stir until combined.  If it's too soft to pipe, just pop in fridge for a few minutes.  :-)  This is a keeper!

This is a staple piped cupcake topper in my house. I generally whip light cream cheese with 1/2c granulated sugar, then whip the cream separately with the other 1/2 cup granulated sugar and vanilla added gradually. Whip until almost butter! Then fold both together. I can pipe this without issue. (Or eat it straight from the bowl, lol)

This was fantastic. It was the first frosting recipe I have used, but having made cheesecakes in the past, I took the advice of warming the bowl to mix the cream cheese with up. that worked really well and I didnt have any lumps! I also chilled the bowl and beaters used to whip the cream. Will definitely be using again, TY!

I am not a "part time cake decorator" but I have tried this recipe many many times and it came out delicious and not too runny! To the ones saying that this icing is too runny, you obviously did not read the instructions right. i didn't change anything about this recipe and was perfect! All the directions say is to beat the whipping cream until STIFF PEAKS FORM, if you use a whisk for this it will obviously take a while for it to form peaks so i recommend using the electric beater, i also got a larger bowl filled with ice under the whipping cream bowl so it forms peaks quicker and it wouldn't melt. The other thing is when you are done making the cream cheese part that you make sure you FOLD it into the whipped cream, DO NOT whisk.

Okay so I created an account just to review this recipe!!! It's absolutely delicious, I altered the ingredient amounts slightly and added a little cocoa powder to make a chocolatey version. The cookies I wanted to frost didn't turn out great so I just saved the frosting in the fridge and I keep going back to taste!!! I kid you not, every time I go back for another taste, it just gets better and better. I thank you for the recipe and also forgive you for any resulting weight gain.

The absolute BEST cream cheese frosting I have ever had. I normally don't like a lot of frosting because I find it too heavy, but this recipe was light as well as delicious. 5 stars! I will say, I only used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of a full cup, and it turned out perfect. A must have for any baker! =)

I love this frosting!  Not too sweet and lovely texture/flavor.  I used it on top of the Key Lime Pie VIIs that we made and it is just the right complement.  I made exactly as is EXCEPT used Whip It when whipping cream to stablize because of all the reviews who said too runny.

The Whip It worked like a charm.  I used glass bowl, did not freeze/cool bowl or attachments, used cream cheese right from frig, and ended up with perfectly thick, rich topping I could easily spread on anything.  Still looks great late next day.

This is the BEST FROSTING EVER! PERIOD! It is so delicious, not too sweet, is very fluffy and so so easy to whip up!!! Much better than frostings that call for confectioner's sugar, in my opinion. If you want to pipe it, just put it in the fridge to chill. Worked great for me! Thanks so much for posting - everyone that tried this frosting LOVED IT!! :D

I LOVE this recipe. I add one cup of crushed raspberries to the cream cheese sugar mix , beat until creamy then fold in the whipped cream. I use this frosting on strawberry/raspberry cake, then sprinkle coconut on top. My family calls it Zinger cake. It gets rave reviews whenever I bring it

Oh my goodness, please disregard the negative reviews! This recipe is totally worth a try. I just finished my first batch for a carrot cake & had to save a big scoop for myself after frosting it! The texture is perfect! Just be sure to have your cream whipped & it all falls together PERFECTLY. I added a aqueeze of lemon juice & it gave it a great citrus flavor. If you love cream cheese frosting this recipe is a must! Enjoy!

Made this last night for some gluten free chocolate cupcakes. The frosting was amazing! My new favorite. I used two cups of whipping cream instead of the cup and a half since thats what was in the container. I kept everythiing else the same. Whip the whipping cream in a bowl and beater from the freezer and whip until its very stiff. Put the whipped cream in the fridge while you do the cream cheese. Beat the rest of the ingredients until very smooth. Even after its incorporated you need to make sure the keep going. Then fold in the whipping cream slowly until combined. Ive also folded in frozen raspberries and used as a filling for cupcakes. SOOO soooo good. I will be using this for all my cakes. Next Im going to try it with marscapone cheese for an italian twist.

Absolutely love! Makes a great frosting for angel food cake, among many other things. I have trouble piping it smoothly, the chunks of cream cheese get in the way, but I don't care. The taste makes it worth it!

The taste is heavenly but it is runny. I imagine putting this frosting on regular cake will be difficult. But I used this frosting for my (first time) ice cream cake. I wanted something soft so will not be too hard to cut when it's frozen, and this frosting is the perfect one. I put my bowl and in the freezer for about 15 mins. And I put the frosting real quick on my frozen cake and ice cream, then put it back in the freezer. The frosting (decoration) stood up nicely until all were eaten. YUM.

SO YUMMY!  I have never whipped cream but I followed the other reviewers and froze my metal bowl before hand and it was really easy.  I also left my cream cheese out to soften for about 30min to avoid the lumps others were talking about.  It turned out great.  I substituted powdered sugar instead of white sugar because I ran out.  The frosting was not very sweet and my daughters said it tasted like butter.  I thought powdered sugar was sweeter than regular white sugar but next time I will increase the powdered sugar a bit.  I still thought it was very good and rich.  The consistency is amazing.

Delicious and easy! This is now my husband's favorite frosting! I use Neufchatel cheese (the low-fat cream cheese) because it softens better.

Help please??!!

I've had used this recipe before and it came out perfectly. Recently I used it to frost my carrot cake and placed it in the fridge. However, when I took it out of the fridge about a day later, the frosting turned into a gummy-like texture. Has this ever happened to anyone before? Or does anyone possibly know why this happened? The only thing I did differently was use 1 cup heavy cream instead of the usual 1 1/2 cups cream (which I have always used).

thank you

Excellent! I used this on the Banana Cake VI recipe on this site, and it was amazing. My husband said this frosting really made the whole dessert complete. Super easy to make and it isnt heavy. Very light and tasty! A keeper! I plan on using it again and again.

This frosting is fabulous!  I made it for my family at Easter and put it on Devils Food cupcakes and everyone loved it so much they had 2 cupcakes!  I didn't have any problems with it being lumpy or too soft like some people complained about.  The key is to make sure your whipped cream is whipped until firm and if you set the cream cheese out for 30 minutes or so before using, it blends perfectly resulting in a smooth delicious frosting!

Fantastic!!! I made this exactly as the recipe was written, and it's to die for! We were all fighting to lick the bowl. I used it to frost a carrot cake and it was the best part of the cake. I love that it's not too sweet. I will be making this again and again.

Very good taste, light and fluffy.  The best cream cheese frosting I've ever had.  Only problem I had was cream cheese mixture didn't fold smoothly into whipped cream, was a little lumpy and the lumps were not there prior to folding in.   There will definately be another time with this recipe, maybe then it will be smoother or more combined is more accurate.  Also, there was no way you could pipe this frosting, not thick enough.

YUM!!!  I halved the sugar and added 2 oz melted baker's white chocolate.  I frosted the "Heavenly Angel Food Cake" recipe from this site with it, and served with fresh sliced strawberries for my little girl's birthday.  This is my new favorite frosting!  THANK YOU!

This frosting was amazing. I did what some suggested by putting the bowl/beaters in the freezer ahead of time. It came out perfect. Next time, I do think I will reduce the sugar a little, to make it less sweet. Other than that, I consider this a favorite so far.

I used this to decorate the top of a strawberry cheesecake. Looks and tastes great. Held up very well, even though the cake was sitting on a table for a few hours. Great decorator icing, nice alternative to whipped cream.

I gave this two stars only because the flavor was so nice.  Otherwise, it was very runny and there would be no way you could pipe this frosting.  It did not whip up well at all and I tried it twice.  Again, the flavor was good, but it is a runny mess;  If you need something for piping, this is not the recipe

Love this frosting! It was a hit on my red velvet cupcakes.  I did alter it as others suggested and sub. white sugar for confectioner's and reduced the whipping cream to about 3/4 cup.  It was perfect! Not overly sweet and just a hint of the cream cheese.  This will now be my go to frosting.

The tastiest cream cheese frosting.  My daughter even had some who hates cream cheese frosting.  I did however use the powdered sugar.  I did same parts heavy whipping cream and same parts sugar.  Mine was semi-thick for piping, but it looks nice and is very tasty.

Add my 5 stars to the rest.  This recipe is well worth it!  A very nice balanced combination of flavors, which are enhanced with a little extra time.  (Try making this one day before you need it for full flavor experience.)  No too cream-creesy, like some of the store-bought kinds.  Like other reviewers, I tried it with the 1 3/4 c powdered sugar in stead of plain light.  Maybe that helped add to the lighter texture.  Also, as another reviewer suggested, I made this to top the Mafioso Chocolate cake, a wonderfully rich and dense treat.  The flavors of the two complimented each other beautifully.  Both will stay in our home recipe box!

I'm absolutely sold!  This recipe has such a great balance of whipped cream and cream cheese.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I made the pumpkin ginger cupcakes to go with this wonderful frosting and it was a hit.  The frosting is pretty soft so after frosting the cupcakes I put them in the fridge.  Thank you for this keeper!

Yummy! 
doubled recipe and used powdered sugar
double layer rectangle chocolate cake for my sons birthday.
Sprinkled Andes mint pieces all over the cake when I was all done. I used a stainless steel bowl, put it along with the beaters in the freezer about 1/2 hour before whipping the cream, worked perfect... I would not use this for decorating but is a wonderful middle and base for any cake.

This is an excellent recipe. I froze my bowl before making the whipped cream and then put the whipped cream in the freezer while mixing the cream cheese. It did seem a little loose after folding the two together so I also added about a 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar so I could pipe my frosting. It was a perfect consistency.

I was worried this would taste too rich with the cream cheese, but instead it had a wonderful light flavor and stood up nicely.  I would add that i left the cream cheese out till it was softened and had no problem with bumps, also I did the whipped cream first as per the other review.  I definitely think this is worth a second try with the change to the order and allowing the cream cheese to be softened.  You DO have to whip it really well though.

I only rate this a 4 star because of the consistency of the frosting. Because you have to fold the cream cheese mix into the whipped cream its hard to no when it is finished. It also takes a while for it to completely be mixed (which is most of the time done by hand). I would not rec amend using plain white sugar, the white sugar gives it a grainy taste. You should use powdered sugar and be sure to sift it before adding for a smooth consistency and easy piping. The icing did have a wonderful taste that complemented my carrot cake wonderfully. Thanx for the recipe :)

This was a very good recipe. The taste is great! I used it on a white cake that had different jam layers, and it complimented the cake well. The only problem, which has been mentioned was it was a bit runny, which meant I kept it in the refrigerater except when actually cutting and serving it. Other than that good recipe.

Thank you! This is THE best frosting! 
When it comes to the whipping of both the cream and cream cheeses mixtures, patience is the key. Good things come to those who wait, or whip, and whip, and whip in this case!
#1 The beaters and bowl must be chilled before whipping the cream. Whip until those stiff peaks form or it won't work! 
#2 It takes time, but cream together the cream cheese mixture until you can hardly taste any sugar  grittiness.
#3 Chill the frosting for at least an hour, you want it cold when you put it in the piping bag. Remember to work quickly because the warmth of your hands can cause the frosting to become runny.  I use smaller amounts at a time in the 
#4 Grab some strawberries and your leftover frosting and enjoy!  This is a great frosting recipe that is versitile!

This is an AMAZING frosting recipe!  I followed it to the letter and it came out absolutely delicious!  I'm not a huge fan of whipped frosting but with the cream cheese in it it is just heavy enough to satisfy me!  The flavor is unbeatable as well.

I've used this recipe numerous times and it is always delicious, but I wanted to share some of the variations that I make: Caramel- add a few tablespoons of thick caramel (not the imitation stuff) to the cream cheese mixture. Strawberry - use either fresh or frozen strawberries thawed that are pureed to the cream cheese mixture. Lemon- add 3 tsps of lemon juice and the zest of one lemon to the cream cheese.  The options are endless! Enjoy!

I always had a time with this kind being a bit runny and too sweet for my taste, but it's still a great frosting for everyone to enjoy. For me, I generally take 1 cup of confectioners sugar+ 1/2 cup sugar+ 8 oz cream cheese+ 12 oz cool whip and beat it together to make a very smooth frosting.

After reading all the reviews on this site, I decided to use powdered sugar. The icing was delicious! I used it on carrot cake cupcakes. The only bad thing is that I felt that my cupcakes needed to be refrigerated because of the frosting. They held up well, though! I was very happy with how they turned out and everyone raved about the icing.

Wonderful frosting!  Easy to make, had no problems getting it to be creamy and delicious you just have to be patient with beating the sugar until it is non-grainy but it eventually becomes smooth.  Kept it in fridge for a couple of days before using it to decorate my son's chocolate flavoresd construction themed cake.  Spread easily and had a strong enough finish to pipe some green grass on my son's cake.  The flavor is to die for, perfect combo of cream cheese and whipped cream flavor; just the right amount of sweetness!  I think the next time I try this recipe will be with carrot cake.  Two recipes is more than plenty for frosting and decorating a double layer half sheet 18 by 12 inch cake.

OMG this is the best frosting I have ever made. I used about 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, put the whipping cream,  beaters and bowl into the frezzer for about an hour before whipping the cream. I also left the cream cheese out for a couple of hours to soften it up.  It makes plenty of frosting and was just the right consistency.

Great flavor but Do Not use all of the whipping cream!  Luckily I read the reviews before I tried this so I just added as much whipping cream to make it the consistently I needed.  Other than that I LOVE this recipe! It's great on cakes and also as a fruit dip.  I love that it has the cream cheese flavoring but also light and fluffy.

We had guests last night and I was looking for a fast and easy dessert.  I used the Chocolate Cake II from this site with this frosting.  It was great!  This frosting is super easy to make and tastes fabulous!!  The white sugar is powdered sugar, I'm sure.

I tried this recipe with the 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar instead of regular sugar,and I think it turned out pretty good! I am using it on top of cupcakes, kind of like in the picture. I chose to try it because I am not a frosting lover, so I would say that overall it is worth the try!

Excellent frosting.  I much prefer this over butter based frostings. I add half a vanilla bean for a more sophisticated flavor.

I had some cookies that turned out a little bland so I wanted to spruce them up rather than watching them go to waste on the counter (no one was eating them). So I Googled for a cream cheese frosting thinking I had the ingredients and sure enough, found this recipe... and WOW! This is sooooo tasty. I dropped a couple drops of red food-color in while beating it all together and made the tastiest pink frosting ever for my brilliantly green and blue cookies. :)  Really went fantastic with simple sugar cookies.

Love, love, love this frosting! I am not a fan of buttercream or most cream cheese frostings but this one is fluffy and light and not dense. Great for my son's birthday cupcakes.  I used a large star tip and the shape help up perfectly.  Everyone raved!  Yummy!

I used this recipe for St. Patricks day themed cupcakes and it was great! I used the suggestion of going with 1 3/4 cups of icing sugar and just a bit of cornstarch and the icing was not runny at all. I beat the whip cream until it was very thick and was sure to freeze my bowl and beaters. I will keep this cream cheese icing on hand from now on!

I really like this frosting. I had no trouble at all with it being too thin. I piped it onto cupcakes perfectly.Not too sweet and a really good and different flavor from the norm.

I used whipped topping instead of real whipped cream.  It wasn't as decadent but it traveled better and I think it probably will pipe better if you were into decorating. Still a great light taste and consistency for either a sheet cake or round cake.

My best friend and I use this on all our cakes, because we love it so much!  We follow the advice of another reviewer and always put the bowl and beaters in the freezer for a few minutes before whipping the cream.  For simple piping, this stuff works great!  You just have to stick it in the fridge once in a while to cool it down (and using a gel food coloring is a good idea).  We have also made versions with cocoa powder and melted dark chocolate (add slowly while stirring), which tasted absolutely divine.

This frosting was the bomb! I am not an experienced baker and used this on cupcakes; at first it come out a bit "gloppy" but after frosting the cakes I popped them in the fridge briefly to "set up." They came out great; can imagine that incorporating the other raters' comments about freezing the mixing paddles would definitely help. Thanks Tom!

This is absolutely delicious !  I used it as a frosting for the  "Chocolate Cake II"  recipe and it turned out really great . Since the cake is sweet, i just added half cup of powdered-sugar instead of the whole cup in the frosting.  If you put this frosting in a freezer for some time, it will taste like a really creamy vanilla ice cream :)

Wow!  Loved it.  It was a light, cream cheese frosting that was perfect for my red velvet cupcakes.  I used powdered sugar instead of white sugar and was very satisfied with the consistency.

Very delicious and easy to make. It does get kind of soft and runny at room temperature unless you keep it refrigerated. I found that adding more cream cheese makes it hold up a little better.

DELICIOUS!  Perfect recipe as written!  For those of you who are having trouble with the runny frosting...  I used 2 separate bowls; one for whipping cream (chilled bowl) and one for the cream cheese/sugar/extract).  After whipping the cream till firm, I put both mixtures in my kitchen aid mixture and whipped at high speed...perfect consistency and it is just simply delicious!

This frosting tastes great, but it was kind of a hassle.  I chilled my mixer and bowl, and whipped the heck out of it, and everything was fine, until I frosted my carrot cake...about half way through frosting it, the frosting began to get thin and runny.  I just placed the cake in the fridge and served it cold, but next time I will switch to powdered sugar and use less heavy cream.  Very light taste though and everyone liked it, despite the appearance.

reduce the salt, and maybe even the sugar, as it is a bit sweet for me. i also whip the cream till it is very heavy, but be sure not to make butter! and serve it cold!

I followed this recipe precisely except putting ceramic bowl and beaters to the FREEZER for 20 min before whipping cream. I took this step because on the day I decided to test this frosting our AC broke down (%$^*!!!). So even though I had to frost cupcakes in 80F hot kitchen, the frosting was perfect, I piped it in big swirls and could have easily piped roses, but it was just too hot (for ME) to do extra work. I would have added pictures to prove that this delicious light frosting is quite pipeable but there seems to be no option to do that here.

This is the best frosting ever!  If I have any leftover I'll add a bit on top of a plain bagel for a sweet treat.  I have also taken maraschino cherries, drained the juice, then blended them, and drained the extra juice from that and mixed it in.  It gives it a pink color and just enough of a cherry flavor to know it's there, but not to be overbearing.  It pipes well, both with and without the cherries mixed in.  Super yummy!

This frosting tastes amazing..But it was hard to pipe it out sometimes. It became watery..and hard to pipe with! so i had to fridge it for awhile..Other than this, It was a pretty good tasting frosting. Everyone loved it!

The flavor is to die for!  I made a red velvet, 2 layer cake with this and it was a hit.  I used about a quarter of a vanilla bean instead of the extract and it was fantastic.  I have a feeling I will return to this recipe again and again.  THANK YOU!

This frosting was o.k. nothing out this world. If you want it to firm up a bit more use powdered sugar instead of regular white sugar. I made this a day ahead. Stored it in an ice chest for travel, it held up very nicely while in while in fridge or cooler. Keep  frosted cake in fridge until ready to serve or frosting tends to not hold up too nicely in warm weather.

Very light and fluffy. I chilled my bowl and whisk attatchment before make the cream and warmed it for the cream cheese. Some people complained about it being runny, I didnt' have that problem, but it is whipped, so its not as stable as buttercream and therefore won't hold up as well when decorating.

this was an excellent frosting.  After combining cream cheese with whipping cream i beat for a couple minutes - i just didnt "fold" it in.  It had a wonderful consistency beating for a few minutes.

I made this icing yesterday for the Sam's Famous Carrot Cake and it was wonderful...nice and light and not overly sweet.  My co-workers really enjoyed this icing versus the traditional cream cheese icing used on carrot cakes.

I used this recipe for the filling layered in a pumpkin trifle and it had the perfect consistency and flavor for the dessert.  However, if you want to pipe it, it may be a little too thin.

I found this recipe 3 years ago and have used it many many times.  I love the taste, so creamy.  However, not until this Easter did I perfect the method for my liking....I decreased the heavy whipping cream to 3/4 c and chilled overnight.  PERFECT.  Chilling overnight is essential! It sets up so well...much creamier.  I love this recipe and will use it forever!

Made this but with powered sugar, and WOW, this is great frosting! My husband didn't want a heavy cream cheese frosting so I found this and it was perfect. I don't think I will ever make normal cream cheese frosting again. This is so light, I could practically eat it out of the bowl. I made this with a strawberry cake.

I liked this light 'n' fluffy alternative to the usual heavy cream cheese frosting. I was aiming to translate a guava and cheese pastelito (I filled the cupcakes with a pureed guava pasta) into a delicate cupcake and this worked beautifully. (Note: I did cut out the vanilla extract so it wouldn't interfere with the effect I was going for.).

I made what I call cookie sandwiches with chocolate chip cookies and used this frosting in the middle, took them to work and every one loved them. Every one has asked me for the recipe! I used some other peoples tips I got from other reviews and beated with whipping cream in a cold bowl first before mixing up the other ingredients in a seperate bowl. The frosting turned out perfect. No lumps, not runny.

I just made this absolutely perfect frosting.  The taste is great.  It piped beatifully.  It wasn't grainy as some have suggested.  Maybe becaued my cream cheese was room temp, and I mixed the cream cheese stuff first so it sat while I whipped my cream in a glass bowl that I had kept in the freezer.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Karen

I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great. very light and fluffy, just like whipped cream, but more stable and lightly sweetened. I had people competing for the bowl! a little too powerful for a whole cake, but I think it would be perfect for cupcakes.

Sooooooo goood! I'm not much of a baker and these were for my daughters b-day party so I was a little nervous. I made a cake the night before and added 1/2 unflavored gelatin and it held up wondefully. 3 days later and its still holding strong on the leftover pieces! So yummy!

This recipe was extremely easy as well as AMAZING. I'm not a fan of thick grainy frosting, so I fell in love with this recipe. I made it to frost a Carrot Cake as well as Red Velvet cupcakes. The frosting wasn't thick enough for the carrot cake, but it was perfect for the cupcakes. Everyone loved it, especially my husband who ate all the remaining frosting from the bowl.

As others have stated YUMMY !! I used the exact measurements in the recipe and had no problems. I did however chill my mixing bowl and beat the cream first until very stiff, then mixed the rest and folded it together.  Turned out perfect, not runny at all. Will definitely keep and use again and again !

It's so light, but you can still tell that it has cream cheese.

Made once using powdered sugar & once with regular white sugar.  Both very, very delicious!  As far as next time I use it, I'll probably use which ever is closest to the front of the cupboard door (translation: no preference between the two, both totally yummy!)

Too runny.  I chilled everything before whipping, kept it chilled before folding, chilled cake after frosting.  I used powdered sugar instead of granulated, but still sagged a bit.  It was very yummy, not too sugary, and light tasting, and I might make it again in certain situations, but not a pro finish cake frosting.  Should be an awesome treat on top of fresh strawberries in summer!!!

Awesome frosting!  I used it on the 'Cream of Coconut' cake and it was SO delicious!  The first time I made it, I wasn't paying attention and added all the ingredients together.  I used a hand mixer for about 10 minutes and it came out just fine.  Perfect consistency, not runny or lumpy.  The second time I made it, I thought it was a little runny when I tried to fold the cream into the other mixture, but then I just used the hand mixer to blend all the ingredients and it worked out fine again!

This frosting is so delicious it's almost addictive! It spreads easily and I was even able to decorate with it--nothing too precise, but I found it very manageable, even using the old (cheap) technique of putting icing in a baggy and snipping a tiny bit of corner off. I made sure my beaters and bowl were cold for whipping the cream and that the cream cheese was room temperature. It was a hit with everyone who ate it. Thanks!

Delicious & fluffy!  I made a raspberry cream cheese frosting by reducing the sugar by half & adding a half cup raspberry jam.  Also, I folded the whipped cream in 1/3 at a time to help make it more fluffy, less runny.  Definitely a keepr.

In my opinion this is a 3 star recipe that earns 5 when you tweak it. For me, adding cocoa powder bumped this up to 5 stars.

I didn't know if I should try this, b/c I already had a cream cheese icing that I liked.  But, I had some cream I needed to use up, so I gave it a shot, and boy am I happy I did.  It was delicious!  Very light, but still that wonderful cream cheese taste!  I will use this recipe again for sure!

I really love this recipe.  I've used several times now with different recipes.  It's easy to make and it's great when the traditional cream cheese frosting is too sweet or overpowers what it's frosting.  The tips here are great.  I've used powdered sugar and granulated - both work fine, but I prefer the powdered.  Light delicious and hold up well.   I would not pipe it.

LOVE this frosting.  I used it on the two ingredient pumpkin cake recipe from this site.  It was a BIG hit with the book club.  I will use it from now on as my cream cheese frosting recipe but will probably add a splash of grand marnier.  The Boozier the better!

It was GREAT!! I did take the advise of others and replaced sugar with powdered sugar.  I also put the finished product in the refrigerator to set before frosting the cake, to ensure it wasn't runny.

I thought this frosting was okay.  I like my frosting thick and frosting like, and this was like cream cheese flavored whipped cream.  Mine didnt turn out runny at all. I think the key to it not being runny is beating the whipped cream not just until soft peaks form, but until it is thick thick.  Then most importantly use POWDERED sugar (i used 1 cup).  I think the submitter must have ment powdered not reg white sugar.  But that made all the difference in the world.  Mine was light, and airy like cool whip but thicker than cool whip.  It would be fantastic on a strawberry cake.  I made it for a banana cake and thought it was just ok.

I AM IN LOVE!  I love cream cheese frosting and when I made this I could not believe how light and fluffy this was. I used it to pare with Banana Cake IV from this site (this cake is heavy so I wanted the icing to be light and this was the perfect pare for me).  Thank you, Thank you for this wonderful recipe I can't wait to find something else to put it on.

I think that this recipe and I were meant to be!  My daughter & I made cupcakes, then I realized we were out of powdered sugar for frosting.  So, I checked AR of course to see what I could find.  I was so excited when I found this recipe.  I *just happened* to have 1-1/2 cups of whipping cream left over from making ice cream.  I only buy whipping cream 2 or 3 times a year and I just happened to have the EXACT amount needed for this recipe!  Best of all is that this recipe is awesome.  It could have easily iced 4 dozen cupcakes.  I only made 2 dozen and it took all the will power I have to not eat the rest of it right out of the bowl.  I LOVE this recipe.  I will be making it from now on.  This recipe and I were meant to be!

The frosting tasted great but wasn't as firm as I had in mind. Perhaps if I had whipped the cream until it was firmer it would have held up better. I added lemon zest and lemon juice to it which gave it a nice zing.

This is the best frosting I've ever made and one of the best I've ever had! Some time in the fridge makes it the perfect piping consistency. This got rave reviews at the last birthday party I baked for.

I made this frosting for an apple cake I made for a party dessert. A couple modifications: instead of sugar, I used 1/2 C Agave Nectar and I only had 1 C heavy whipping cream on hand, so that is all I used, but it turned out fantastic nonetheless.  One of the guests, who is unusually hard to please when I try to make healthy desserts was absolutely in love with this frosting!

After reading many of the reviews and hearing of all the possible problems with this recipe I was really leary of trying it. I went ahead and gave it a shot and I am glad I did.   I did use confectioners sugar rather than the granulated, but other than that I followed the original recipe. It turned out perfect in texture and spreadability. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the cream cheese taste was milder than I prefer in a frosting. I served it on a white cake and everyone said it was great.  Note: I whipped the heavy cream with frozen metal bowl and beaters and then put it in the fridge while I prepared the cream cheese mixture (just in case).

I love this recipe!!  I reduced the vanilla to a 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp of mint extract, green food coloring and 6oz of Andes baking chips.  I layered it on 2 9inch chocolate fudge cake layers and decorated with cutting full Andes mints in half and standing them around the edge.  Everyone that tried it raved!  It definetely cannot be piped though.

It was a terrific recipe, I used this icing on my tye-dye cupcakes. It was a hit, however I think next time I won't use salt. The vanilla was not too much, it was actually just enough. I probably mixed the whipping cream too much, so it was a little harder to fold in the cream cheese mixture. Overall it was a great recipe and I will use it again.

It is a very good frosting. If you would like it a little thicker use confectioner sugar in place of the white sugar.

I loved this recipe!!!  Followed previous reviewers' advice and did the following: Used 2 cups powdered sugar instead of granulated, 1/4 tsp almond extract, 3/4 tsp vanilla, chilled the bowl and beaters for whipping the heavy cream; had cream cheese at room temp; after mixing together both cream mixtures put in refridgerator to chill for an hour, then took it out and mixed in food coloring, chilled again and then piped it out on cupcakes using a star tip and turned out BEAUTIFUL!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't really care for this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly, but the frosting was way too runny, even just spooning it onto my cupcakes was nerve-wracking as it started to run off the edge.  After realizing the recipe was a dud, I added an entire additional package of cream cheese, which firmed it up a tiny bit, enough to at least get it on the cupcakes and then stick them in the fridge so it could harden.  I also had to add a ton of extra vanilla to get it to taste like something other than just cream cheese.  It's O.K., but I won't use this recipe again, mostly because of texture.

I made this to go on a the Gelatin Poke Cake.  I had some whipped topping I needed to use up, so I used that instead of heavy whipping cream.  Since whipped topping already is sweet, I cut back the sugar to 3/4 c.  It is good for just spreading on a cake, not sure about the piping.

This is awesome!  I made it using powdered sugar instead of granulated.  I frosted carrot cupcakes with it.  The consistency was fine for spreading it on cupcakes.  It is light and not too sweet.  Others reported the consistency being too thin, but by adding additional powdered sugar it could be thickened up.  I had no problem with the consistency, but I beat the whipping cream a bit more than stiff peaks, but more like fluffy butter.  My family LOVED this.

I liked the taste. It was lightly sweetened, smooth and a hint airy with a strong enough dose of cream cheese. I felt it was fairly easy to make too. Initially, the frosting was grainy from the granulated sugar, but keeping it in the fridge for a day or two smoothed it right out. I was also told that the frosting was really soft when in room temp but really hard out of the fridge. (I only made and ate the frosting. Didn't frost it.) Here's a tip, if you can, whip the whipped cream while making the cream cheese mixture because it took a while for the whipped cream to whip. But keep an eye out for it! I would definitely make and eat this again.

I think this is a very good frosting, maybe just not that firm for piping purposes, though.  I only substituted confectioner's sugar (1 3/4 c), used it on a chocolate bundt cake and garnished with fresh strawberries.  I cut the cake in half and put some frosting and strawberries in the middle, and did the same on top.  Everyone liked it, mostly because it was not excessively sweet, thanks for the recipe !

As previously stated. Stick the mixing bowl and the beaters in the freezer before starting. Beat the whipped cream until very stiff. Stick the whipped cream in the freezer while mixing the cheese part, and then fold back it in and chill again before frosting. Absolutely no problems here. It was delicious, held up beautifully, and I added some cocoa powder to the cheese mixture since I used the white cake recipe. Double yum!

WOW!!!  This has to be the best frosting I have ever tasted. I used it on the Strawberry Cake recipe from this site and it was awesome! I made sure to do as others suggest and whipped the whipping cream till it was almost butter and then after whipping the cream cheese for 10 minutes whipped the two together for another 10 minutes.  The icing was smooth, easy to work with and transported great in a cooler. Yummy, Yummy!!!

I am SO GLAD that I found it and that I read the reviews ahead of time so I was able to heed their advice.  Definately whip the heavy cream until it's practically butter, about 5 mins on hi speed, scraping the sides. Get it as thick as you can. And whip the sugar/cream cheese part for about 5 mins as well, med-hi until the sugar granules have fully disolved. And although it says to fold them together, I used the mixer, on med-lo to get it nice and evenly smooth. I mixed crushed pineapple into 1/3 of it for the cake's filling and I could eat that with a spoon! Left covered in the frige overnight and it was so easy to frost in the a.m. I LOVE cream cheese frosting, but not the heavy, butter-ladden ones, This one is light, perfectly sweet and cream cheesy. I will NEVER use another cream cheese frosting recipe ever again!!! Could easily be made (almost) healthy with FF cool whip and cream cheese  too.

I was making cinnabon clones when I realized I didn't have any confectioner's sugar for the frosting. I searched for another cream cheese frosting and this one popped up. It was a nice, lighter alternative to the frosting listed with the cinnabon recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  As another reviewer shared, whip the cream first in chilled bowl.  Does not get runny.  Yum!  Lighter than the usual cream cheese frosting.  I've found my new favorite cream cheese frosting!

This is delicious!  I use this for my carrot cake, because it is light and not as sugary as the usual carrot cake frostings

This was an excellent recipe for a "light" cream cheese frosting. We're not big on cram cheese frosting so this fit te bill for my carrot cake. I did however decrease the cream cheese and sugar. I was able to pipe it. I filed my bag and refridgerated it. I did notice that as I wa piping my hands warmed it up so I had to place it back into the fridge for 20 monites. I was then successfully abble to frost my cake. :)

This was really good! I used 1/2 the amount of sugar. I also whipped up the whipping cream first and then incorporated all of the other ingredients. I tinted it pink - and it was really tasty!

So scrumptious!  I have made this recipe multiple times and it is simply delicious!  I always get RAVE reviews when I serve this!  Many people ask for the recipe each time because it is so light and fluffy, not too sweet and refreshing!  I have had problems with the cream cheese not incorporating well to where you can still see little pieces of it on the frosting, but most recently when I made it I accidentally whipped the cream with the sweetener, salt and vanilla first.   I was hoping that I had not ruined it, but I went ahead and added the softened cream cheese and beat it with a mixer until it was smooth and incorporated.  It turned out to be the best "mistake" because the cream cheese incorporated wonderfully with no visible pieces!  I like to serve this frosting on "Fabulous Orange Cake" found on allrecipes as well, but it would be great on many cakes.

I tried using Cool Whip instead of whipping cream, and it did not turn out too bad.  It was not soupy, but not thick.  The texture was light and delicious.

Yummmmm!  My 13 year old daughter made this icing to go on top of Confetti cup cakes.  She added a little red food dye to give them a pretty pink shade.  Had some left over so she put a bit on the chocolate chip cookies she made the following day.  She is getting to be quite the chef!

Great frosting.  I thought it wasn't quite sweet enough at first, but later changed my mind...it's just right!  Also, I had no problems with it being too runny....worked great on my layered red velvet cake.  I did pre-chill my mixing bowl, and the whipping cream as others suggested.  Will definitely make this again.

I have made this 2 times now and it is my favorite frosting.  I was a little leary after reading others reviews, but this is what I did to aleviate any potential problems.  I put the beaters and metal bowl in the freezer for at least an hour before using.  I also put the cream in the freezer for about 30 minutes.  Comes out creamy, flavorful and gluten free! So now my neighbor friend can enjoy it as well.

Really really good! I used it to frost an Irish Cream cake for St Patty's day, and wanted something close to the consistency of cream cheese frosting, but with the flavor of whipped cream. This was the best of both worlds. I did have an issue with lumps, some of butter and some of cream cheese, but it was late and I was in a hurry.. didn't read through the reviews enough to find out how to take care of that. No worries though, my client LOVED it! I will be making this one again and again (tonight as a matter of fact, I got another request for it!) but will heed Chubss advice concerning the lumps.

As written, I gave this recipe four stars because I found it to be too sweet.  I now use between 1/2 cup sugar to 3/4 cup sugar depending on the sweetness level of the item I am frosting.  With the adjustment of the sugar, the recipe is five stars.  I use it all the time.

Followed the recipe exactly! Sooooo yummy. I could sit here eating out of the bowl for ages, it's so good. Doesn't pipe very well, but I would still frost a cake with it. Firmed up a bit more in the fridge for me!

I made this last night.  It ended up too runny.  Maybe I did something wrong, not sure.  I used heavy cream instead of whipping cream.  That may have affected it.  I fixed the frosting by adding powdered sugar to it.  The powdered sugar made the frosing less runny.  It had a sweet taste to it.  But it wasn't too sweet.

Delicious!  I was a little confused about the "white sugar" because powdered sugar is usually used in frostings.  I decided to use 'granulated sugar' and it turned out perfect.

I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 only because it was not firm enough of a frosting.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and the taste is fantastic!  I beat the cream for a solid 5 min with a chilled beater wisk.  Next time I will try the powdered sugar to firm it up.

Really really sinful! My husband makes cakes for people and I convinced him to top a carrot cake with this frosting and now people are lining up to order! This frosting also is superb on Italian Cream Cakes - add chopped pecans and it takes it to a whole other level. I will never make plain cream cheese frosting again - never liked it much and this adds so much to anything you bake!

This was so yummy! I beat the cream cheese and other ingredients very well before adding the whipped cream and it wasn't grainy at all. It didn't turn out runny, but it was a little softer than I would have liked.

This recipe is so simple but so perfect! I followed the recipe exactly and the consistency was just right. Creamy and not too sweet. I used it to frost my carrot cake and it was an instant hit. Thanks!

GREAT taste - I had people tell me they loved it even though they normally never eat frosting/icing. I had no problems making this, and I followed the recipe exactly. It took gel food coloring well (I added the color while whipping the cream). The consistency was just a bit loose even after letting it sit in the fridge for an hour or so after making it, so I'd use it for simple frosting jobs and maybe piped swags or borders, but not for anything intricate like roses. The flavor is really what sets this apart from a typical frosting - light, airy, and just the right amount of cream cheese flavor. Will definitely make again, thanks!

Quick, easy, and fabulously delish!

Used 1 1/2 cups whipped topping as did not have whipped cream at home.  Also used powdered sugar.  Fabulous!

Used on carrot cake recipe found here.  GREAT!!!!!!

Just made this icing for the first time, and it is delicious and easy to make!!  I used powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar, and whipped the cream first in a chilled bowl.  My icing did not come out runny at all.  Great recipe!  (I made to put on pumpkin spice cake, very good combination).

This frosting ROCKS!  I love how light it is compared to other cream cheese frostings.  I paired it with the pumpkin ginger cupcakes from this site and they were gone in a flash.

I made this frosting for a friend's birthday cake. The frosting was a little soft to use. I would use this frosting for cooking with my kids and cakes I refrigerate to keep the texture. I will use this frosting again because it taste really lite and good.

I know there are a lot of reviews that say otherwise, but just making this by the recipe works great. Just make sure you mix each part really well before the final combination and there won't be any issues. It came out so well, very light and creamy. I am not usually a cream cheese frosting fan but the taste in this one is so small that it is almost like an aftertaste.

This frosting is a combination of 2 of the greatest things in the world.  Cream Cheese frosting and whipped cream.  Wither of them, I will totally lick the bowl clean.  For starters, the day that I made this, my kitchen must've been 95 degrees, with about 75% humidity.  I did not have any problems making it, whatsoever.  No lumps, not too thin, just keep in mind that this frosting will melt.  It has whipped cream in it, which WILL NOT stay solid at room temperatures.  I did not chill my bowl in the freezer to make the whipped cream, I did not bring my cream cheese down to room temperature.  I did use a stand mixer.  I chilled my bowl by dropping a dozen pieces of ice in the bowl and twirling them around the inside until the outside of the bowl started to sweat.  I then poured in the heavy cream, attached the whip attachment, and turned it on.  Started with a low speed to keep from splashing, but as the cream started to thicken, I slowly turned it up.  Now, leaving this unattended is a bad thing, as I have lost bowls of cream to over whipping.  Keep an eye on the cream and turn it off just after starting to get stiff peaks.  Moved that all out of the mixing bowl and into a holding bowl in the fridge.  I then took everything else and put it into the mixing bowl.  If you are using the blocks of cream cheese, you might want to cut them up.  I used the same attachment, didn't really clean out the bowl, just scraped it down with a silicon spatula, whipped it for what must have been

This frosting is absolutely fantastic.  Like others, I whipped the cream and cream cheese in separate bowls, and the whipped them together, and it held up just fine to a three layer cake.  I used 1 cup of powdered sugar rather than regular granulated sugar, and this made for a not-too-sweet frosting that was perfect for an extremely sweet cake.

Good recipe.  I used powdered sugar for the "white sugar" called for in the recipe.  I was planning to pipe this frosting, so I wanted to make sure it was a stiff consistency.  As other reviewers have said, the key to a good consistency is to keep the frosting cool while working with it.

This tasted good but it was too runny to pipe anything with.  I had to use it to just frost the cake, even though it wouldn't smooth very well, then had to use another frosting to decorate on top of that.  I wouldn't use it again.  I even read through all the reviews and thought I would be able to overcome the "runniness" issue, guess not.

This was easy and very delicious!  I did have to whip the heavy cream for about 10 minutes to get the peaks (I never did it before and didn't realize it would take that long).  Also it got a little runny when I was mixing the colors in (I used it to decorate a birthday cake), but I just stuck it in the freezer for 5-10 min. and then it was perfect - piped beautifully!  Everyone loved it, I will definately make it again!

wow, is this delicious! I followed the recipe using regular sugar and it turned our wonderfully. It is not as smooth as buttercream for piping/icing due to the cream cheese, but the flavor makes it worth it. Used it this time to ice a white cake with a strawberry filing, but it seems this would work well with chocolate, carrot and banana cake. This is for sure going in my permanent recipe box!

This frosting is the best. I like cream cheese frosting but this one combines two of my favorites, cream cheese and whipping cream. It yields a good amount so you don't have to skimp on the topping.

Wow. This frosting is amazing! Very light and fluffy. I took the advice of another reviewer and made it to top the banana bars recipe that is on this website. It did take a while to beat the whipped cream to the right consistency, but well worth it! Everyone in the family loved it!

This is my new favorite frosting!!!  It's so good and not super sweet just right!!  For the people who are giving negative reviews about decorating with it, it's whipped cream based so of course it won't hold up as well as a buttercream.  This is a great frosting!!!!

I was expecting light and fluffy frosting with a cream cheese taste. What I got was not light and fluffy but somewhat thick and way too soft to keep any kind of form. I will move on from this recipe and try to find a better cream cheese frosting.

I had no problems at all with this recipe.  I chilled my bowl and beater (used a stand mixer) before whipping the cream.  I added a third of the sugar and vanilla in with the cream while it was whipping.  I then transferred it to another bowl and whipped the cream cheese, remaining sugar and vanilla, salt, and a pinch of allspice (my cake had allspice in it) with the paddle beater.  When the cream cheese mixture was nice and light, I folded in the whipped cream on "stir" setting (the lowest mixer setting) and it maintained its density.  Tastes great - light and fluffy and sweet enough without being sickening.  I used it to ice a banana cake (Banana Cake VII from this site), and it was delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made it as is in the recipe and I tasted incredible. Now, it needs to be kept cool because of the raw dairy, and its not the best for piping and holding its shape, but its delicious enough for me not to care. :)

This was wonderful!! My only suggestion would be to First whip the cream putting in the fridge until the cream cheese and sugar is blended. GENTLY fold the whip cream in and voila! Good Stuff! Went wonderful on my carrot cake stuffed with cheesecake! FYI-it makes A LOT!!

This recipe was so forgiving! I often speak in those terms when I cook because I am an...intuitive cooker, i.e., I rarely use the exact ingredients called for. The best recipes for me seem to allow for a bit of play. In fact, I originally looked for this recipe because I had no butter. I used more cream, because there was more in the container I bought, and kept the other ingredients the same. I took the advice of other raters and whipped the cream quite stiffly, figuring if I whipped it too hard I would have my butter after all... In any case, it came out fantastic, tolerated my excessive folding and generously frosted a double recipe of carrot cakes. I topped them with coconut and crushed pecans. They look great! Thanks for sharing!!!

YUMMY!!!!! I don't know how pipe-able this is, and mine wasn't too pretty (I think I overbeat the cream), but the flavor is so great I don't care.  It feels so light and fluffy, yet the cream and cream cheese make it so rich tasting at the same time.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Delicious, pretty and worked really well.  I added cinnamon to this for a chocolate cinnamon cake topping. It whipped up perfectly for piping or anything with minimal effort and with NO need to substitute the regular sugar for powdered sugar.  I chilled the bowl and beaters and beat the cream until firm peaks and shape formed and that's it.  Perfect!

This is a fantastic frosting!  I only had 1/2 cup of sugar left so that's all I used and it still tastes great.  Just enhances the cream cheese flavor.  I used this on Pumpkin Gobs from this site and it was a perfect match!

OMGosh, this frosting is pure heaven!! I loved it. I was actually walking around with the frosting in the pastry bag and asking everyone in my family to taste it. I'm not sure what everyone was talking about when they said it doesn't pipe well. It held up great and piped wonderfully. I'm thinking maybe the others just didn't whip it long enough. MINE PIPED AWESOME!!!

This frosting is SO delicious!! I whipped the cream until it was super thick and stiff, then put it in the fridge until I was ready to fold it into the cream cheese mixture...I used it as filling for the "pumpkin gobs" recipe from this site...delicious...but I do agree with others that this frosting is not thick enough to pipe, and I am not sure how it would hold up on a layered cake...I think you would have to keep it refridgerated...I will make this again!!

I used a little less cream cheese than called for and added 2 Tbs of strawberry preserves (pureed). The topping was light and not overpowered by the cream cheese. I used this to top a french vanilla cake with strawberry preserve filling. The topping was also delicious on macerated strawberries in a glass.

This recipe worked for me!
I used this recipe for my daughter's birthday cupcake.  This recipe piped up good.. and tasted even better.  I even got a request from a friend to make it for her own child!
Will make this again.

Awesome!  Made with a 4 layer french vanilla cake (box) and adorned with lots of fresh strawberries.  Tinted the frosting pink for a baby shower.  Everyone asked for the recipe. (so easy!)
(Used 1-3/4 powdered sugar instead of 1 cup granulated.)

This is the absolute BEST cream cheese frosting.  I make it exactly as it's written and I get compliments on it all the time. It's got that fantastic cream cheese flavor without the heavy sweetness of the traditional cream cheese frosting.  I usually make a 2-4 tier carrot cake and when I do, I double this recipe so I can slather it on nice and thick!

The only frosting I've ever liked!  Absolutely creamy and delicious.  Having whipped the cream well, and then folding it into the cream cheese, I had no problems decorating a three layer round cake!

I'm licking the spoon as I type!  Yum!!  I did not have the whole amount of heavy cream; I may have had a half of cup if not less and it still turned out really well!

And it came out pretty thick, which was perfect for frosting.  I would say it was just as thick as the frosting you buy in a can.  

I think I will continue to use 1/2 cup of heavy cream in the future; it turned out really nicely.  I followed the rest of the directions and measurements to a T.  

I also like how it did not come out overly sweet.

This frosting tastes really good. Kind of like the filling in strawberry pretzel salad. But, after folllowing the recipe EXACTLY as stated, along with chilling along the way, it does not set well. I really like the taste of it, but I have no idea how you could actually pipe with this stuff. Its very runny, even after being in the freezer for a half an hour after making it. I'm going to give it another try and add less cream and maybe some flour because it tastes so good. I would love to use this for decorating because I really hate all of those sugary buttercreams out there. Wish me luck!!

I found this recipe on another site and was about to add it when I decided to check if anyone else had. I'm glad I did! This is a wonderful frosting that's great on spice cakes! I've also added apple pie spice or pumpkin pie spice to this and it's just perfect! My husband constantly requests this...and I'm delighted to make it!

I served this frosting with a vanilla cake and a strawberry blueberry mixture.  Everyone commented that it was hands down the best frosting they have ever had!!  I couldn't agree more!! Spreads nicely after being left in the fridge for an hour or so.  I left mine in over night.  If you aren't going to use or eat the frosting right away, I suggest leaving it in the fridge as well.

Holy Moses.  I do believe the heavens parted and I heard the angels singing when I tasted this.  Light and fluffy manna from heaven.  I used it on the Strawberry Cake II from this site for my daughter's 2nd birthday.  Followed it exactly and it was perfect.  Maybe the other people had a problem because they didn't first whip the cream into stiff peaks first?  I had no trouble at all.  Fantastic !

Great tasting frosting.  Used it on a 2 layer (one choc, one vanilla) cake with fresh fruit on/in it.  Used a little less whipped cream than the original recipe called for.  Served at 2pm, and left sitting on an A/C vent all day.  No problems with melting.

AWESOME ON BANANA CAKE!!! Thanks this is great! I do have to say that because I live in Bulgaria and the white sugar here is pretty coarse I substituted what they call powder sugar here, which is still  much coarser then the stuff from states. Turned out to be the perfect texture!

Mmmm!!  I love cream cheese frosting, but it's so heavy!  This was a very nice change.  I followed the advice of another user, chilled my bowl and beaters before whipping the cream - I worked quickly and was able to color some and pipe it, too.  It spreads nicely and tasted delicious.  Thanks!

This frosting is delicious with carrot cake.  I found that folding in the whipped cream didn't work very well -- the cream cheese/sugar mixture was too heavy -- so I used the mixer on it for an extra minute and everything combined perfectly.  The frosting was light, fluffy, and delicious.

Very easy to make, and very yummy. I used this on strawberry cupcakes. My husband who is not much of a cake person literally inhaled 3 of them. Was a hit at a dinner party....Though was a bit sweet, maybe I'll cut back on the sugar, will definitely make this again!

This frosting was very good but I have a caveat.  The first time I had it was at a party where there were so many people I could only have a small piece.  It was divine.  But when I made it for a family birthday on top of banana cake, there were only 5 of us and so everyone got a BIG piece.  My husband loved it on bite one, but by bite eight, he said it was "intense."  And he was right.  Don't get me wrong, it has a lovely texture and is so satiny and light, but that cream cheese in there makes it super rich and that can backfire on you if you want a big piece of cake.

I am not much of a cook but decided to have a meal at home this holiday instead of going to homes of friends and family.  I followed the directions, just as listed, used granulated sugar and beat the cream until my arm hurt but it was well worth it.  I iced a boxed moist white cake and it was a great combo.  The small amount that was left, I had to refigerate to keep fresh.  This has definately inspired to do more home cooking.  Thanks so much for this delicious treat!!!!!

I adapted this recipe to frost some lemon mini bundts I'm making.  I wanted a creamy, lemony frosting and this one fit the bill.  I substituted whipped cream cheese for the regular cream cheese and canned whipped cream for the whipping cream.  I kept the vanilla and added 2 capfuls (I presume they're teaspoonfuls) of lemon extract and 2 drops of yellow food coloring.  It came out wonderfully fluffy, creamy and the lemon flavor was refreshing.  Definitely a keeper!

Ok, this filling is so wonderful.  I used it in Pumpkin Gobs from this site and if you read that review for those you will know that this frosting is the only cream cheese frosting you should ever use.  People want to buy this combination from me.

Very good! This frosting comes out lighter than the traditional cream cheese frosting recipes so it's great for certain things like the Pumpkin Gobs from this site. Also, it seems to be a little stiffer than that tratditional. Same great cream cheese taste, but sets a little firmer and lighter than others! Great recipe, thanks!!!

This is the perfect frosting!! It is creamy and not sickening sweet like so many frostings.  Great on strawberry cake and I cant wait to try it on other flavors of cake.

I loved this recipe!  It was exactly the sort of thing I was looking for and I didn't have any problems with its consistency, though I realised I had run out of whipping cream and substituted reddi whip.  The next day my husband cut himself a slice of cake that had to be a fourth of the cake!

Absolutely delish!  I topped the Fabulous Fudge Cake I also got from this site with this frosting for a co-workers birthday. Everyone at work loved it.  Going to use it again this weekend on a carrot cake I'm baking for my boss.  This is definatly a keeper in my recipe box.  Thanks Tom!

(Do NOT substitute powdered sugar in this recipe)  This recipe is wonderful. follow directions exactly and mix everything well. Turns out wonderfully flavored and fluffy. It would probably be thick enough to pipe if you whipped the cream enough.   I'm in heaven! Yum! I actually used it to decorate a cheesecake I made for a friends birthday and it turned out wonderfully!  Love it!!

This was just what I was looking for! I did adjust it per other reviewer's suggestions, 8oz of cream cheese to 1c. milk, and a little less sugar. I got a wonderful light yet firm topping, and just the right amount for a pie. Loved it! I also made another half batch, didn't whip the cream for as long and added some lemon juice, presto, fruit dip.

This recipe is wonderful.  I used Dream Whip instead of whipping cream because I had it in the house, and it was really good.  So light and fluffy, perfect if you don't want a really sweet frosting.

I love this icing. It's creamy and not too sweet. I've been making it for years now and have never been disappointed. I make it first before I make my cake/cupcakes and put the icing in the fridge to firm it back up again. You can also make it the day before. I have never had problems with it being too soft or runny. I put it in my pipping bag with a big star tip to pipe it on my cakes. I've even pipped it on top or cheesecakes.

I made this with half sugar/half confectioners' sugar.  This was a good frosting but it didn't "Wow" me.  I will most likely make it again.

The best cream cheese frosting that I've ever had.  I've tried it on carrot cake, poppy seed cake and even as a dip for fresh fruit.  I recently used it as the filling for the raspberry trifle recipe on this site and it turned out fantastic.  Looking forward to trying it on many different kinds of cake.  I think you could use it as a substitute for whipped cream on many desserts as well ... pumpkin pie comes to mind.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious and easy! I followed the advice of other reviewers and chilled the mixing bowl and wisks before whipping the cream and to whip the cream before the cream cheese (so as not to get any cream cheese in the liquid cream, which will hinder its becoming whipped), and it came out just right. The frosting is not too sweet and not too sour or overpowering. I put it atop the Chocolate Lover's Chocolate Cake, and they went together perfectly! Yummy!

This frosting was not at all what I expected from a cream cheese frosting.  It was very light, both in texture AND in flavor.  I couldn't taste any cream cheese flavor at all.  It was okay, but the title is very misleading.

This was just the right recipie I was looking for.  Usually cream cheese frosting can be to sweet for me, but with the folded in whip cream I think It added a more light and fluffy texture to it.  It was still sweet but not overly sweet. I agree on letting the cream cheese soften uop at room temperature, I think It would be easier to fold the whip cream into.  This recipie is a must have!

This is by far the easiest and best tasting frosting I've ever made. Very light and absolutely delicious.  My family raved about it.  I used it to frost my spice cake (13 x 9 pan) and even had enough to frost 2 dozen cup cakes for my daughter's class.  
I will definitely be making this often...bye..bye..to store bought frosting!

This can easily (and tastily) be modified to be fat free and have MANY fewer calories.  I used Philly fat free cream cheese (you could also use any Neuchatel cheese) instead of regular.  I subbed a package of fat free Cool Whip for the heavy cream and I used 3/4 c Splenda instead of sugar (the Cool Whip is already somewhat sweet).  I kept the vanilla and salt as in the recipe.  VOILA!  Fat free, and it is still great!

This was a hit in my family.  It was a good alternative for those of us who don't like whipped cream frosting and those who think the buttercream is a little too sweet.

This frosting is absolutely delicious!!!  It makes a wonderful fruit dip as well.  Made with a boxed yellow cake and topped frosting with fresh sliced strawberries.  My family has claimed it as their favorite.  Make sure to use cold bowls for the whipped cream and cream cheese or frosting will be runny!!!

This is the best fluffy decadent frosting I have ever had ! I made a pink and white checkerboard cake and frosted with this wonderful icing tinted pink.  Wow what a pretty cake for a party. Everyone loved especially the birthday girl. Will make this again and again.  I didn't change one thing, excellent and not over sweet.

This was easy to make and a nice change from a traditional cream cheese frosting. It was plenty sweet on a chocolate cake. I have made the recipe as it is and I substituted 1 cup powdered sugar instead of regular sugar. I liked how creamy it came out this way.

This is exactly what I was looking for!  I don't understand why some of the reviews said that it was too thin to frost a cake. I think the key is making sure your whipped cream is very thick with stiff peaks. I frosted a double layer white cake and added some strawberries and it was delicious!  Thanks Tom for sharing!

This frosting is absolutely delicious!  It's a very nice substitute for the traditional cream cheese frosting because it's not as heavy nor as sweet.  I followed the directions exactly and the frosting came out perfect.  I used it to decorate a double-layer round carrot cake and it worked great.  I did not find it to be at all "runny" (as did some other reviewers).  Just be sure to beat the whipping cream adequately, and then fold it into the cream cheese mixture gently.  My guests loved this frosting and I will definitely make it again.

This is so good you could use it as a mousse instead of frosting. I layered pieces of lemon cake, this frosting and strawberries. It was unbelievable. I would give it more stars if I could!

This is a great light cream cheese frosting!  For those that find a regular cream cheese frosting too rich, this is a heavenly alternative.

This is a great frosting recipe.  I use it on almost every cake I make.  I usually scrape the frosting off of a cake because it is way too sweet, but this stuff is delicious.  Everyone else loves it too.

Very, Very Tasty. I couldnt quit eating spoonfuls of this when i was icing the cake. But i am a lazy cook and i didnt want to whip the cream, so i used a tub of cool whip instead. it worked great. and it was easy to decorate with as well. my roses held up beautifully.

Oh my goodness, this frosting was such a hit! I made it with only one cup of heavy cream, instead of 1 and a half, so the frosting was quite thick, and paired perfectly with the Champagne cake I made for New Years with a raspberry/RazzM'Tazz filling. Thanks Tom! I will make this again!

Phenomenal recipe!  We put this on Frosted Banana Bars (on this site) one piece at a time, and it was scrumptious!  It made more than we needed, so we just started eating it by the spoonfuls. I'll use it next to frost a carrot cake, but will definitely refrigerate it overnight prior to doing so.  It helps it stiffen a little bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to use this frosting to pipe on a cake - it didn't have the consistency at all. I decided to put it on a banana cake instead and it was terrific. If you don't want to pipe this frosting it's a winner!

I just wanted to add my 5 stars - I made this to top a white cake with lemon filling and everyone loved the frosting.  It's light and fluffy, but for the cook who thought it too soft, try putting it in the fridge for a little while to stiffen it up a bit - perfect for piping!!

This recipe is fantastic, 5 stars.  It is very light and fluffy.  It might not be what people expect from a cream cheese frosting, since it's not very rich.  I topped the Best Carrot Cake Ever (another fantastic recipe) with this and the cake is dense and this recipe is so light that I was afraid the cake was going to squish the frosting out of the center, but it didn't, it was fine.  Will try again with banana cake, etc.  Thanks Tom.

This is delicious and different.  I think it's an especially great alternative to the typical cream cheese frosting during the summer when you don't want anything super-heavy.  I used this to frost a banana cake and it was absolutely delicious!

Great frosting!  Not only is it easy and fast, it is delicious!  Another thing about this recipe that makes it a five star is that it makes plenty of frosting.  I actually had frosting left over, which has never happened to me before.  This will be the only cream cheese frosting I ever use!

WOW!  This frosting is fantastic.  I used it to frost a strawberry flavored cake for Easter.  Wonderful flavor, and the recipe makes enough to both frost and decorate the cake.  Thanks for sharing, I'll definitely be using this one again.

This is the yummiest recipe I have found (so far). The only changes was that l let the cream cheese warm a bit outside of the fridge before using. This eliminates the lumps. I also used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream instead of the 1 1/2. Great consistency and plenty of frosting to top my sheet cake.

I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup because I was filling the middle of my lemon cake with lemon curd and some of the frosting. The frosting was easy to work with. My family wants me to use this frosting on my carrot cake. It's much lighter then regular cream cheese frosting.

This was my first time making  a frosting with heavy whipping cream. It turned out wonderful and delicious! At first, I couldnt get the mixture to thicken or stiffin up at all! Then I learned everything has to be very cold. So I stuck The mixing bowl, metal mixers and frosting in the freezer for 10-15 minutes several times throughout the whipping process to keep everything cold. That is the key to this receipe! Cold! It worked and I was able to beautifully pipe!

I just made this frosting for the first time.  It is so good and not too sweet.  I used it on a home made cake.  I haven't cut the cake yet, but I'm sure it will be wonderful!  I have a dumb question though.  Does my cake need to be refrigerated because of the frosting ingredients?

Use whole fat brick cream cheese, not the spread, and it should be stiffer. I actually use a small amount of brick cream cheese to stiffen my home made whipped cream and keep it from deflating. You may also want to use powdered sugar and make sure your cake has cooled completely before frosting.

All my friends said this was the best frosting theyâve ever tasted. I piped this easily just whip and heavy cream till itâs very stiff and then just put it in the fridge for awhile. It was the best!!!

I replaced the vanilla with lemon juice and used this frosting to ice "lemon cake from scratch". I used dehydrated lemon slices to decorate it and the cake was to die for.

I absolutely love this recipe! Piping problems? No! I did use 1 1/2 cups of confectionery sugar instead of granulated. Chilled the bowl and beaters for the whipping cream. Cream cheese was almost room temperature (last minute Nancy here ??). I piped this on my cheesecake cupcakes. Sliced strawberries stood up fine, and the ones with 1/2 cookie on top stayed up as well.  
I had some extra, so I just mixed some sliced strawberries and blueberries with it. My snack for work tomorrow!  Shhhh! LOL

Oh wow. I loved this. It is so light, but keeps a great cream cheese flavor! I was running low on granulated sugar, so instead used 1.5 cups of powdered sugar after reading some of the reviews. It turned out delicious and was quite easy! I kept my whipped cream bowl cold, and warmed the cream cheese bowl. A perfect topping for my carrot cake! I had plenty to frost an 8x13 sheet pan, with a little left over.

I have 32 people in my office and I bake each person whatever they want for their birthday. I made this frosting to go on my French Vanilla White Chocolate cupcakes. Everyone loved it  so much that one of the guys said he just wanted a gallon of this and a spoon for his birthday!

This is the best cream cheese frosting ever!!! I put my mixing bowl and beater in the freezer for around 30 minutes and let the cream cheese soften on the counter during that time. I mixed the whipping cream first and then added the cream cheese mixture!!! I could eat this by spoonful itâs that good!!!

This recipe turned out perfect!  I was hesitant on making it after reading the reviews because there were many that didn't get the "whipped" frosting they were hoping for. I am SO GLAD i chose to try it anyway. I did use a cold bowl and beaters. It definitely could have been piped. I would recommend it!

I made this to ice an orange layer cake.
I added 1.5 oz orange juice and 1t Grand Marnier
The icing was plenty thick. I whipped the cream until it was very thick and heavy, not quite butter. I put it in another bowl and set it aside. Then, I mixed the remaining ingredients  and folded the whipped cream in. 
You definitely want to whip the cream first with clean utensils and get it thick. You might be able to get away with using less whipped cream, but then you will be a little sparse on the icing, especially if you cut your layers in half so you have four nine inch layers.
I would have liked a lighter icing. I prefer a chantilly cream. This was a good icing though.

I used only 1 cup of cream in hopes of piping this on cupcakes.

+The taste was nice and light.
-The icing started firm, but started to loosen up and fall in room temperature.

Might be okay for cakes or cinnamon buns, but will not try to use for piping purposes.

BEST FROSTING RECIPE EVER!  I adjusted the ingredients slightly: reduced sugar to 1/3 cup and added 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar to whipping cream before whipping.  Otherwise, I followed the instructions as shown.  Frosting turned out great and was easy to pipe onto cupcakes.  Brought some to my son's school and office, and it held up just fine.  I will definitely make this recipe again and again!

The frosting was GREAT! It was very simple, the only tips I have it to make sure that the cream cheese and other products are room temp, because if not it would turn out worse, and that you have to whip it perfectly, not too much to make butter, but just until stiff peaks. Tasted amazing, not too sweet and still had a slight cream cheese flavor. 10/10.

I made this for the strawberry American flag cake for fourth of July! The cake disappeared.  I made sure to soften the cream cheese first and chilled the bowl for the cream before whipping.  Came out perfectly!  Also great for those who aren't huge fans of a cream cheese icing...

This was a very tasty recipe. I used brown sugar instead of granulated and I'm not sure if that contributed to the thin consistency.  Definitely not pipeable, but very good.

This was a great whipped cream! Light, decadent, easy to make, and a perfect accompaniment, there were only a few changes I made based off of the reviews I read that assured that. I chilled the bowl and beaters and ran the larger bowl under hot water then dried it before putting the room temperature cream cheese in it. I was surprised that it didn't come out grainy, or runny, as some reviews said. It wasn't very sweet and did well with a chocolate cake I made. It was good, but it wasn't amazing. If I don't find anything better, I'm definitely sticking with this the next time I need whipped cream.

I would not make this again. It wasn't spectacular in taste and was way too runny. Husband will be eating this cold, but not sure if icing will have to be scooped up with spoon. Never have I rated recipe on-line before, but baker beware. Not the recipe to use unless you're an expert cook at repairing things.

I used this but a minor tweak that I added an extra 1/2 cup of heavy cream because I wanted a lighter, fluffier version to finish off a Strawberry pie I wanted to try.

After reading some of the reviews I am confused.  This was my first time making it and it turned out really well. I whipped my cream first and set it in the fridge while I prepared the rest. Also, I used 2 cups of cream in mine. I had my bowl of cream cheese setting on top of the oven while my cake was baking so that it was very soft. I also poured the whole cup of sugar over the cream cheese before I started the mixer. Then I folded the two together.  Update: I made this again and it turned out great once more. For piping the frosting I slowly folded in the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until it was the desired consistentcy.

The only change I made was to add a slight bit of cream of tartar to help hold the whipping cream. It's a yummy frosting but piping it is not made for.

I made this EXACTLY as is and itâs one of the best frostings Iâve ever had. Light, creamy, I add less sugar to personal preference. For me it held up great frosting but I could see how it might be thin and squish out between the weight of a lot of layers. Tips : Use a cold bowl for whipping cream. Cream cheese must be room temp in order to beat smooth. I did still get a few small lumps but once itâs on a cake you wonât notice flavorwise or visually. Once frosting is made it MUST be kept cold until serving or else the heavy cream will start melting out. I have subbed 1.5 cup confectioners sugar if thatâs what u have on hand.

SO YUMMY and not overly sweet! I used this frosting to fill and frost the "Sam's Famous Carrot Cake" recipe on this website! Taking advice from other reviewers, I altered the recipe slightly as follows:

- 1 3/4 c. confectioner's sugar instead of white sugar, sifted.
- Chilled a metal bowl & beaters in the freezer before 
   whipping the cream
- Beat the cream SLIGHTLY longer, not yet to butter but so that it 
   was very stiff.
-  Chill the whipped cream in the fridge while you beat the 
   cream cheese and sugar!
- Make sure to whip the cream first, as any fat reside or oil on 
  the beaters will prevent the cream from whipping.

Following these easy alterations led me to a structured frosting that was absolutely perfect for filling and frosting a carrot cake. This recipe also was the perfect amount to generously frost a 9-inch, two-layer cake with just a bit leftover.  It is perfectly sweet but not sickening! Love it!

Outstanding! Thank you. No lumps and perfect for piping. I followed the directions exactly which is rare for me. Had I stopped beating the whipping cream when it wasnât stiff, I would not have been able to pipe it. I just left the cream cheese and other ingredients out at room temperature, except for adding the vanilla with them and it was very smooth. Then folding in the stiff whipped cream made it perfect!  I got the beaters, stainless steel bowl and whipping cream very cold before whipping. Just a great recipe if done well, and desserts are not my strong suit in cooking, as far as I am concerned. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I used this recipe for a red velvet cake from a famous wood pellet smoker. I made some changes, used 1 cup of powdered sugar instead of refined, like recommended. The frosting wasn't sweet.  I allowed the cream cheese to sit out all day and get to room temp before using. I would cut it to decrease the time needed to bring to room temp. 
Whip the cream cheese like you would creaming butter.
I had to use a separate hand mixer for the whipping cream, and mixed until stiff.
Amazing! Thank you!

Since the reviews said it was soft, I used it for filling. It was tasty. It was SLIPPERY! I watched a cake layer slide as I was trying to frost it. I have never had that happen.

I made this recipe as posted. I froze the stand mixer parts and whipped the cream until stiff, set aside in another bowl, and then whipped the other ingredients until the sugar dissolved before folding. I set the bowl of combined ingredients back in the fridge for a few minutes before frosting some cupcakes for my daughterâs birthday party. I found the frosting was plenty sturdy for piping. But the fluffy/air bubbles prevented the piping flowers from looking nice and uniform. I ended up using a knife instead. The texture was very nice and light but I didnât love the flavor. I canât put my finger on why. Maybe too creamy and not enough tang from the cream cheese? Iâll probably stick to regular frosting next time. My daughter didnât care for it either but her friends loved it. I guess itâs a personal choice thing. Also, the frosting held up great for me at rook temp for many hours. That was a nice surprise! I think this recipe could probably frost 20-24 regular-sized cupcakes.

This recipe worked wonderfully for me. I used about a cup of powdered sugar and the frosting seem to set well for me. I was in a bit of a rush so I didn't let the frosting sit in the fridge long so it had a more whipped substance but once it cools, the frosting holds well. I used this as a filling and frosting for my cupcakes. I added a bit of cinnamon for extra flavoring. It was a hit! I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this using 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar in place of the granulated sugar and it turned out WONDERFUL! I made sure my bowl and beaters were chilled when seating the whipping cream and chilled the frosting when it was done. I feel it could have been used for piping but I was just frosting a spice cake that had a layer of Carmel sauce poured over the warm cake. I allowed the cake to cool then frosted it and the finished product was delicious!

Flavour is 5 stars! I piped it on cupcakes. I think you could pipe some trim/decorations on a cake. I actually added 1/4 cup soft butter... not sure if it made much difference. But I'll make it again

Used 1 3/4 powdered sugar as suggested by others instead of granulated.  Stuck bowls and beaters in freezer and cream before mixing.  Put it back freezer once whipped, while mixing room temp cream cheese.  Folded in whipped cream with cream cheese mixture and put it back in freezer for 15min...then iced a cooled 2 layer carrot cake.  It was still too runny to be piped.  Not sure how people are piping this frosting.  Delicious though.  Next time will try adding gelatin as suggested by others to stabilize.  BTW-the powdered sugar had cornstarch in it but not enough to make frosting stiff enough to pipe...maybe more sugar would have made it stiffer but then frosting too sweet.

When I made this frosting Angels came down to my kitchen and sang to my taste buds. I was skeptical about using granulated sugar but made the recipe as is any way. But I had no grainy bits in my finished product. It also pipes very well. Im planning on using this for a wedding cake a friend asked me to do.

I LOVE this recipe. It's light and fluffy but not runny and can sit at room temperature without falling off the cake. Taste and texture is more like whipped cream than it is frosting and it has a slight cheesy taste (not decadent). Can you pipe it? To a degree. If you want to do a simple swirl on a cupcake then sure, that can be done but if you are looking to make actual designs it probably won't hold up. I find recipe is nice in between layers as well as top and sides of cake (note: it will not smooth down completely, be aware it will look more homey as a result. To do more serious pipping I use buttercream on top of  this recipe's layer.

OMG, I used this to decorate  carrot cake (you've got to try the ultimate layered carrot cake recipe on allrecipes.com!) for a charity event. I received many compliments. I followed  the directions explicitly.  The frosting was easy to spread and set beautifully. This is now my go-to cream cheese frosting. You won't be disappointed.

BY FAR MY FAVORITE FROSTING! I make this frosting for almost every cake I bake. It is the perfect balance of tartness from the cream cheese and sweetness from the sugar. So much better than any buttercream I've tried.

Amazeballs! If you had issues with it being runny or anything else, try again. 1st time I made this I followed excact directions and it was wonderful. The 2nd time and the way I will do it from now on is to ribbon the cream cheese mixture. When I added it to the whipped heavy cream I left the whip attachment on my kitchenaid and let it whip a few seconds more. OMG it was like eating an ice cream flavored cloud, in my humble opinion Lol. Speaking of ice cream....freeze it and scoop it on some warm apple pie, you're welcome!

This frosting is amazing.  I use it on the Strawberry Cake from Scratch recipe from this site, on chocolate cupcakes, spice cake and just about anything that a cream cheese frosting would go with.  The whipped cream just lightens up an otherwise dense frosting.

A couple tips:
1. Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature (I leave mine out over night to soften).
2. Beat the cream cheese and sugar until the sugar dissolves and it is light and fluffy.  This takes several minutes.
3. I put about a cup of the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture and just stir it in vigorously, then I gently fold the rest in.  It makes it much easier to incorporate.  
4. If you intend to pipe this frosting, you need to refrigerate it for about 30 minutes before-hand to allow it to set up a bit.  Then place it in the fridge to set up once piped on your cake or cupcakes.
Enjoy!

I will definitely use this recipe again. I used powdered sugar instead of granulated and cut down to 3/4 cup which was perfect for us.

I am a serious baker, and I was really disappointed with this.  I used the sugar, instead of powdered sugar, followed it to a T.  Never set up like one of the other people who did it.  I did not use powdered sugar though.  Even in the freezer!  So I will be pouring it over my cinnamon rolls.  I was very disappointed because I had a time crunch on  full sheet cakes to ice.  Had to scrap the whole thing.

This was a huge hit!  No more powderrd sugar in this house. I didn't make one change but I may try grinding the sugar a little finer next time so it doesn't take as long.  Absolutely the best I've ever tasted!

Highly recommend making this recipe, it was delicious! It doesn't have a strong cream cheese flavor and it's light and fluffy. It is important that your whipping cream remains cold throughout the whole time you are making this, or else it will curdle. I whipped the cold whipping cream and then popped it in the freezer for the short time that I was whipping the cream cheese. Then gently folded them together. It is also important that you whip the cream until it is STIFF peaks, if not your icing will be runny.

Light and creamy! To everyone who rated this recipe poorly and said they can't pipe this icing, you HAVE to use powdered sugar. The recipe calls for "white sugar" and I think some of you may have used granulated. If it's not stiff enough, add more sugar. It's not a really sweet frosting like a buttercream. I frosted a carrot cake with it and it was fabulous!

Super good and pipes great!  I followed another reviewer's tip and used 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar instead of granulated and it piped perfect.  The cupcakes are still holding their shape a day later. (In the refrigerator)

This was not only my first time making this recipe, but it was my first time making ANY whipped cream frosting.  I followed the recipe to the T, but I chilled my bowl and mixers.  All of the ingredients and measurements were the same.  I had no problems with this recipe being too runny.  I was able to use it as a filling and frosting on a layered carrot cake without a problem.  Make sure you beat the cream cheese, sugar, etc for at least five minutes.  My cream cheese was fresh out of the refrigerator.  I didn't have to soften it or warm it to room temperature.

OUTstanding!!!    Following reviewer's suggestions, I substituted 1 3/4 c confectioners sugar, creamed the cream cheese with the sugar, salt & vanilla while the heavy cream chilled out.   Refrigerated the sugar mix while I whipped the cream then Gently folded it all together.    Just magical, how delicious & easy to work with this frosting is!   Topped my favorite carrot cake with it.... *le sigh*

I made apple cupcakes to put this on and stopped before I even wasted my precious whipped cream in it. Already too runny, even after being chilled. Perhaps it is the type of sugar being used? 
Will not be trying this again, and I do not recommend to others.

very good and easy to make! but lemme tell you, this recipe says 12 servings, and i assumed thats for 12 cupcake frosting, but it already looked like much, so i didnt add extra. like seriously this recipe goes for about 2 plates of cupcakes!!! that depends a little on how much you use, but still!!!!

anyway, this is excellent, easy to make, recepie, and some things i made was using lemon extract for a more sour-sweet chocolate/lemon mix (also good to go with orange)

you can replace vanilla extract with anything else! lemon, orange, ginger, chocolate, food coloring!!!

So, this is my first time making a homemade frosting. I've always bought the store bought ones and they tend to usually be overly sweet. Well now I don't have to buy those anymore. This has become my go to frosting recipe. It's really easy and simple to make. I was worried about whipping the heavy cream the first time I made this but I just used my intuition and sight to guess how it should come out and I got it right the first time! This recipe is perfect for a two tier cake. So far, I guess it lasts a week at best, I had some leftovers in the fridge for that long. It did lose some fluffness but other than that it was still spreadable and was even perfect for the filling instead of the outer coat. I wanted to try adding some chocolate, so during the whipping phase of the cream cheese, salt and sugar, I added 3 TB of powder coco and 1/4 c of hot water, very slowly until it became creamy again and the sugar granules  dissolved. Also I ditched the vanilla for a more stronger chocolaty flavor. It came out with a good chocolate flavor, though because of all the cream, it was light in color, but that didn't matter, I'm sure with more adjustments and tweaks, you can improve the color, if you wanted. All in all, I think this frosting recipe is perfect

I used powdered sugar as suggested, but still turned out way too soft to pipe on my cupcakes.  Tasted yummy though.  I would consider using this as a starting point and maybe add butter to the cream cheese to give it more firmness in the future.

Didn't have any issues with this recipe. Make sure you leave your cream cheese in room temperature for two hours to make sure your final result isn't chunky. Taste was a bit bland but it piped ok. It's a perfect recipe for people who don't like super sweet frosting and I'm going to use it on my cake. Doesn't pipe like buttercream obviously but it pipes much better than anything you can buy at the grocery store. For the real fancy stuff, still definitely use buttercream but I put this stuff under the buttercream decorations.

This is by far the best frosting I've ever tasted!! If you've ever had the"Cool Whip" brand frosting in the cream cheese flavor, that they stopped making??, then this is it. Everyone is a big fan in my family and my husband insists I make this every year for his birthday. I follow the directions and mine is always very fluffy. If you are looking for very stiff, store bought, can like icing,  this is not your recipe.

Very smooth and light cream cheese icing.  Not heavy like the usual cream cheese icing.  Others have said it comes out lumpy or watery.  I made sure I whipped the cream to STIFF peaks and put it in the fridge.  Then I put together the other ingredients and used a hand mixer to cream them together.  You really have to make sure to incorporate the ingredients together for a few minutes so you will get s smooth icing.  

Put the icing on top of carrot cup cakes and they were a hit!!!  Frosted 24 cupcakes generously.  YUM YUM YUM

I followed the recipe exactly, but added crumbled Oreo cookies and made Oreo Cookies & Cream frosting to go with some chocolate cupcakes (that taste more like brownies!)  I had made. My husband and kids could not get enough of it! They said it was to die for! The frosting was super YUMMY and it's perfect for piping. Only advice would be to make sure to mix the crumbled cookies with the cream cheese part of the frosting really well so there are no chunks left, that way it won't get stuck in the piping tip. LOVED IT!

I made this to go in a cranberry-orange-gingerbread trifle, and it turned out amazing! I've never piped anything before, but it seems stiff enough that you could? Based on other reviews, I put my bowl and whisk in the freezer for a good 20 min or so and then whipped the cream first on high speed. When it got to stiff peaks, I transferred it to another chilled bowl and made the cream cheese mixture with room temperature cream cheese, the granulated sugar, and some orange zest (to go with my trifle). I beat it on medium-high speed for several minutes (scraping down the bowl every few minutes), until I could no longer feel the sugar granules when I tasted it. I then folded in the whipped cream. That took a little while to do because the cold cream stiffened up the cream cheese, but I just kept folding until it was mixed really well. With the orange zest, it tastes like an orange creamsicle, making this recipe one of my new favorite things.

Absolutely the best icing I've ever made, and I love icing. My husband, who thinks most icings are too sweet, thought it was fantastic and it's the first time I've ever heard him say he wished there was even more icing on a cake, even though I had layered it almost an inch thick. Sweet enough to satisfy sweet tooths like myself and our friends who also loved it but also light and not overpowering.

This frosting/icing was delicious just as everyone raved it would be. I did not change a thing. It was one of the lightest tasting frostings that I have come across, which is really nice because many are quite rich. This will be my go-to cream cheese frosting from now on. ** To the part-time cake decorator: YOU must be a real, real disappointment as a cake decorator if you couldn't even frost a cake with this icing! I am no cake decorator and still had no problem frosting the top and all 4 sides of a double layer 9x13 carrot cake, with it staying in place nicely.

Came out great. A bit too sweet for me so in the future, I will reduce the amount of sugar and probably use  powdered instead  of granulated sugar. But mine came out fine for piping.

This recipe does work, you just have to be patient whipping the cream so that you get stiff peaks. Once you have that done, folding it into the cream cheese mixture is simple and it is firm enough to pipe, I did it. Not whipping the cream long enough could give you a runny effect. This recipe is so yummy, light, and just sweet enough!

After looking through the other reviews, I put one stainless steel bowl into the freezer for 10 minutes and warmed the other stainless steel bowl with hot water. I mixed the cream cheese side with the warmed bowl, then the whipping cream in the cold bowl.
After the cream was whipped, I carefully folded the cream cheese into the still chilled bowl. I folded until just mixed then frosted my cake.
After I was finished, I placed my cake straight into the fridge.
I had no problems with the icing being too runny, although it was starting to loosen up as the bowl came up to room temperature.
I think the key is to have the bowl well chilled and work quickly. 
I rated it a 5 star because it was a very nice icing made as per recipe, the kids really enjoyed it, but I would have preferred it to taste a bit more of cream cheese.

I can't comment to this piping well, but I think this frosting is delicious.  Based on a previous review, I used 1 3/4 cup powdered sugar, and I folded in the whipped cream a little at a time until I had the consistency I was looking for (I didn't end up using the full 1 1/2 cups.)  I've used this frosting many times to make a strawberry shortcake - it's very good!

I love the idea of lightning up cream cheese frosting with some whipped cream.  For my taste I added a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice and I substituted 1 & 3/4 cup of confectioners' sugar for the white regular sugar I was looking for a smoothness and was quite happy !

Omg this is seriously the best "frosting" I've ever made or tasted! It's not your typical frosting. Doesn't get hard, even in the fridge, and it's not overwhelmingly sweet. Super light and creamy with that great cream cheese taste!! My whole family is a fan too and agrees this is what I'll be making from now on for my cake toppings.

I made this to combine with a carrot cake for a retirement party - and it was a HUGE HIT! Everyone loved how it tasted distinctly cream cheesy but was actually light and fluffy at the same time. I made the recipe EXACTLY as it was written, but as other reviewers stated, make sure you whip your cream first in a chilled bowl (I use stainless steel because it stays cold longer) first. Great recipe, will definitely use again!

I'm not sure why others couldn't pipe this frosting, but it worked out fine for me. I followed the instructions provided in the video and it came out fine. In fact, I didn't even follow the instructions; it was my husband and he doesn't cook...at all. I just made sure he didn't stop whipping that cream until I saw VERY stiff peaks. 
The frosting is super light, but not too sweet and worked well on top of devil's food cake cupcakes. 
To pipe, the cream cheese portion was beat in one bowl while the whipped portion was made in another. For the whipped portion, I used a very clean and cold bowl. When the two separate portions were ready, we folded the whipped portion into the cream cheese portion. My husband wanted to beat them together, but I made him resist the urge and he folded until everything was just blended. No more mixing beyond that. Once everything was put together, we let the mixture chill overnight.  In the morning, I piped out what I needed without incident. The cupcakes were sitting around for awhile before they were touched, but the frosting did not melt or move. In fact, the frosting held together better than the cupcakes (so sad they dried out :-(  )

Very light compared to a regular cream cheese frosting. Tastes great. Some other reviews said it was runny, I didn't have this problem at all. Make sure that your bowl and whisk are cold before whipping the heavy cream! I also found that it helped to whip the heavy cream further than normal so that it was fairly stiff. The cream cheese mixture thins it out to the right consistency

This frosting made the cake! It was the best frosting I've ever had. I didn't have a problem with it being firm. I just made sure to whip the cream until it was whipped as much as it could be without turning it into butter (I put the bowl and beaters in the freezer ahead of time). I put it in the freezer while I mixed the cream cheese. I powdered the sugar (I used coconut palm sugar in a coffee grinder). I added a little bit ginger (it was going on a carrot cake). I also started out with whipped cream cheese instead of just the packaged cream cheese. When it came to folding, I did find it did fold in lumpy. But I ended up stirring it and it mixed in and stayed firm. The frosting was light and flavorful.  This will be my base frosting method from now on!

I love the consistency of this frosting. I also love how easy it is to make. Why I gave it a three is because it tasted like cream cheese yes I know it is in it but it was too over powering so next time I make this I am going to lower the cream cheese. I also did not like it because know matter how many times I whisked it it still had chunks and had to chew the icing I don't know about you but I like to lick the icing off of cupcakes. Over all it was okay.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe and when it came to folding the whip cream into the cream cheese mixture it was clumpy and runny. So I decided to try to mix it with the hand mixer again and it worked great stiff peaks and perfect texture.             Thanks for the recipe.

Used 1 3/4 C powdered sugar instead of sugar.  Made sure to freeze mixing bowl, paddle and that heavy whipping cream was very cold.  Mixed rest (cream cheese after softening) in bowl by hand and rested bowl in shallow warm water to make sure no clumps in cream cheese.  Was excellent!  Makes two 13x9 cakes worth of frosting.

For first time I ever made cream cheese with whipping cream was awesome and delisious an easy to do. I made it for my fellowship at church on carrot cake. When mass was over in an hour, we always have something  to nibble with cup of coffee. The people were really going for it. It was gone in five minutes. They loved it. Now I'm making it again  for my neighbors birthday in May. Thanks for recipe. Gail

Simple whipped cream frosting. It was light and fluffy, not overly sweet. Perfect for Carrot Cake. I did as others suggested chilled my bowl and the beaters for the cream, for about 30 minutes in the freeze. Also used powdered sugar and reduced the amount of sugar as well. Worked like a charm!

Very good on angel food cake with strawberries.  I didn't try piping it, but mine was definitely not sturdy enough got that.

FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!!!! This is an excellent recipe.  The only way you can screw this one up is by not following the directions.  The 1 star reviews claiming that it comes out runny, are a result of poor execution. People,  please make sure you whip the cream first all the way to stiff peaks before adding other ingredients.  The whipped cream should be the consistency of softened butter before continuing.  Make sure you whip that cream good.  You'll get good results.

This did not turn out for me. I used the same whipping cream that I always use, to make whipped cream, but it turned into a soupy mess. I ended up adding more cream cheese, butter and sugar, in order salvage and make a somewhat thick frosting. I must have done something wrong

Loved it! Very light frosting, not too sweet! I used t for my daughters first birthday cake and got lots of compliments! Had zero issues with the consistency. Mine was pretty stiff for a whipped frosting and spread easily onto the cake.

Delicious! I've been hunting for the perfect non-buttercream, able-to-be-piped frosting recipe and I found it! Subbed 1 3/4 cups of powdered sugar for granular sugar and added 1 T. of OJ for a hint of orange flavor. Chilled for 30 minutes after folding together before piping frosting in fat ice cream like swirls on cupcakes. It is not firm enough for fancy piping but worked great for what I needed. One recipe made enough to very generously frost 18 cupcakes.

Made no changes, maybe a bit less sugar 3/4 cup. Was not runny and piped very well. This will be my go to if I am looking for a vanilla frosting, heck may even throw some cocoa in it next time a I  want a light chocolate frosting.

Fantastic light taste that is not overpowering.  I used white sugar per the recipe but had to beat the sugar for 5-10 minutes until it dissolved into the cream cheese - it will dissolve!  I also added 0.5 t vanilla and 0.5 t almond flavorings in place of the 1t vanilla. After folding in the whipped cream, I refrigerated the frosting before icing the cake. I did not pipe the frosting, so I can't comment there but I can see how it might be difficult. I recommend doubling the recipe for a layer cake, especially if you are going to pipe it.

This was a very easy recipe to follow and the end product was excellent!  The frosting was fluffy, light, and not too sweet.  I didn't have any lumps.  I put the cream cheese and sugar in a mixing bowl and mixed it until it was a creamy consistency.  I'll be making this again.

Tasted great however way too soft. Could not do justice to cupcakes. I'm thinking too much heavy cream. It keeps sliding off cupcake mounds. Way too much cream.

A. Maze. Ing!

I made this frosting to top a pumpkin cake. I couldn't believe how delicious and light it is. I used cup of powdered sugar instead of granulated, and I added 1/4 tsp of corn starch to the whipped cream to help with the firmness. It was perfect.

Wow - really fluffy and not too sweet.   Yum.  Good with carrot cake.  I substituted neufchatel cheese (room temp) and splenda (full cup), and it still came out great and thick enough.  Definitely chill beaters and metal bowl for whipping cream in freezer first and between steps.  I let it sit in fridge for 15 minutes before spreading on the cake.  I didn't have any of the consistency problems noted by other reviewers.

I made this a few years back without a hand blender. LOL! It took forever, but let me tell you, it was sooooo worth it. I no longer am allowed to bring anything other than this to family gatherings and potlucks. It has become a stand alone dish for many people. I like to serve with berries since it's so rich. Thank you for posting this. My life has been made simpler. Oh, and I now have a hand blender! :-)

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  I've been making this recipe for probably 5 years-it is phenomenal.  Easy, fluffy, perfect amount of sweet and fluffy-and we pair it with our gluten free dark chocolate cupcakes-a major hit every time.  Nobody even knows our food is gluten free.  If you follow the recipe-and make sure your whipping cream gets slightly firm-it's magic.  Easy to pipe with.  I have also used this in our whoppie pies...and I use this exact recipe, but add in a couple of tablespoons of maple syrup-delicious!

Made this many times. It pipes nicely but will not be as firm as a buttercream frosting.  I liked whipped cream but wanted a bit more resilience if I was doing some decorating. I've done some simple piping (small lines and swirl) and spreading. Helps to really go for the stiff peaks in the whipping cream, but be careful not to go too far.  I've used gel and liquid food colors and they look pretty good, but you won't get super dark colors. 

Any extra freezes pretty well if you wrap it tight. It also tastes really good as a fruit dip.

I was skeptical about the whipped cream folding into the cream cheese, and it definitely didn't go well.  The result was quite lumpy.  I could have beaten the concoction smooth, but that would defeat the point of having whipped the cream in the first place.  The frosting definitely did not pipe well, kept clogging and spurting.  

I did whip the cream first.  I did whip it quite stiff.  I did whip the cream cheese until it was super smooth before blending.

The frosting was also quite runny.  This may have been because I cut back on the amount of sugar by almost half.  So I added a second package of cream cheese, but that didn't thicken it much at all.  The resulting frosting was lumpy and runny.  I wouldn't make this one again.  I'll stick with the cream cheese beaten with butter versions.

I made one big mistake....I only used 2/3 of the recipe on my pumpkin cake because I thought it would be too rich.  Next time, I will use it all.  It was easy to spread and complimented the flavor of the cake really well.

This was a lackluster recipe.  Recipe didn't adequately frost a regular size two-layer cake, nor was the flavor a standout. It was okay--but certainly wouldn't make it again.

Yum yum yummy! This works best in a stand mixer to get the heavy cream really whipped. Just don't let it go too long it will separate into butter that's happened to me! This is really good with Splenda - to make a low carb icing

This recipe is so good. My husband even said it's very good! I used it on a pudding spice cake. And I had said that I will try both the pudding spice cake and this icing, to make a "pumpkin roll" 

Thanks for sharing!

Would be 5 star, but recipe needed some changes. I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cup powered sugar depending on how sweet/sturdy you want it. After the adjustments it turned out delicious!

I love this recipe and when I run into this recipe being a little loose I just add a little bit of instant vanilla pudding dry mix into the whip cream mixture..

Great light frosting. Took others recommendations and whipped the cream in a cold bowl until very stiff. Whipped room temperature cream cheese until light and fluffy. Used powered sugar. It piped just great.

Delicious light fluffy cream cheese icing. I did have to throw out a package of cream cheese. I used regular white sugar first. It was so gritty. I then assumed it meant powdered sugar. After that it was great! It was a little soft, but if you add more sugar at the beginning it makes it thicker. I also overbeated the cream a little to make it stiffer.

This came out great - not to sweet like a traditional cream cheese frosting. Others said theirs came out runny but mine was quite firm. You can layer it on very very thick without worrying about the cake being over-iced. The tips from other reviewers were VERY helpful: whip the heavy cream first so as not to introduce any cream cheese into that process. Freeze bowl and beaters before whipping. Use 1 3/4 cups confectioners sugar instead of regular sugar. I used this on the "Perfect St. Patricks Day Cake" from this site. Magnificent.

When I told my family I was going to make carrot cake they all turned their noses up.  And when I said I was going to make cream cheese frosting for it they all told me they "hate" cream cheese frosting and would not be eating it.  Boy where they wrong.. I had everybody just taste the frosting and they all moaned saying it was so good.  I'm not a sweet eater but could not quit tasting this as I frosted my cake.  BIG BIG BIG hit!!! It's not too sweet and very fluffy.  This will be my go to recipe for frosting.

Absolutely delicious! Used 1 3/4 c powdered sugar instead of regular sugar, and whipped the cream first in a chilled glass bowl. I also chilled the mixture before frosting chocolate cupcakes.  Amazing and not too sweet! Thanks for the tips!

Fantastic!!!! Perfectly sweet, not sickening. Perfect texture, thick and fluffy. I'm honestly confused as to why other reviews are saying this is runny, as mine was not runny in the slightest. Will absolutely make again!

This recipe is outstanding in flavor, but lacking in explanation. If you do the recipe as stated, you will have to beat, beat, beat & beat the cream cheese mixture to get the graininess out of it. I beat with my KA hand mixer, on 9, for around 10 minutes. If you want your life simpler, just use 10X confectioner sugar. The flavor is absolutely incredible though, so I felt it deserved 4 stars. With the powdered sugar tweak or a better explanation about the cream cheese mix, it would easily be a 5 star recipe :) Hope that helps all future bakers!

A lot of the pics look like the frosting was stiff enough to pipe, so I don't know why others didn't have the same outcome.  The "hint of fat" thing doesn't apply to whipping cream - it applies to whipping egg whites.  Whipping cream has a lot of fat in it.  In fact, whip it too much and you'll end up with butter.

I made these for my sons 2yo birthday party and everyone loved them! I put the frosting on top of mini banana cupcakes and vanilla cupcakes. I ran out of icing towards the end and had to use store brought but next time o will double the recipe. I used 1 cup of confectioners  sugar instead of the regular sugar. It came out perfect and not too sweet for me.

This is the best cream cheese frosting and so light and luscious, it is delicious and worth the effort.  Makes any cake a special treat. No tweaking necessary, I probably used more vanilla because I just pour it and don't measure.  Many ways to use this delicious cream such as on fruit or layered in a trifle.

I'm not a baker or cake decorator and I probably did everything wrong. I didn't chill or warm bowls, I didn't weigh or measure anything just winged it, I didn't have air con on and it was close to 40degrees Celsius, I didn't have sparkly clean bowls, I used powdered sugar, I didn't use it straight away (stored in fridge) and this was absolutely perfect. Thick, silky, smooth and beautiful. Perfect for piping.  Thank you. Just what I was looking for. ??

Perfect for a heavy bunt cake! I mixed the room temp cream cheese with the sugar in my stand mixer on high. I left a glass bowl and beaters to my hand mixer in the freezer for 30 minutes to whip the cream. The end result was cream cheese cloud frosting!

This frosting is incredible.  I've been making cupcake frosting with this recipe for a couple years, and everyone at work likes it so much, they fight over who gets the most cupcakes.  I normally don't even like frosting, but you can't make this and not want to lick the bowl clean.  So delicious.  btw, put it in the fridge for a while after making it if you want to pipe it.  It will solidify in the fridge.  Just after mixing it, it's kind of runny.  After letting it sit in the fridge, I can pipe the frosting nice and high on each cupcake.

I had a couple of issues but not sure if it's the recipe or my ingredients.
I found it wasn't smooth at all. I followed the instruction to fold them together. Even though it wouldn't get smooth & my head kept telling me to go and use the mixer to get it there. I didn't.
To me it way to thick. Way to sweet and sticky. Kinda the main reason I wanted to make the whipped frosting to begin with.
Anyhow the one thing I did differently was, I used fresh store made whipped cream rather than whip my own. 
Next time I will make my own and probably cut back on the sugar added. Hopefully it will be better. Not sure the family is going to like it. We arent big on super sweet things much...We'll see tonight.

I followed the recipe except instead of adding vanilla extract I added a packet of vanilla pudding.  Turned out thicker (and a sweeter) than I was hoping so I whipped up a little more whipping cream and added it. It tastes fantastic.  I have yet to ice my cake...just hoping it isn't still too thick. We will see...     :) I think next time, reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup would probably solve both the thickness and sweetness problem s

This is my first time making  whip cream and I was hoping it was a good recipe pick. Oh my goodness!!!!! Amazing!!!! I had no issues with the recipe other than I used a had mixer to combine the heaving whipping cream and the cream cheese mix. I used it on a GF chocolate cake that was tasty but was lacking the sweetness of a chocolate cake. With this recipe made it the perfect cake! I love how simple and quick it was to make for such a great tasting treat. I'll never buy it again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Started with the cream cheese portion, to which I also added about 1/3 cup of fresh strawberry purÃ©e, whipped the cream in frozen bowl, folded the cream cheese mixture into the whipped cream instead of the reverse, which helped keep it colder. Worked out perfectly. A total keeper!! :-)

The BEST cream cheese frosting I have ever made! I used 1 3/4 cups of powdered sugar instead of the sugar. It firms it up just right. Just make sure you beat the heavy cream and then fold it together. My family and friends just raved about it.

Light and creamy and oh so delicious. I make sure to beat the whipped cream until it is very stiff, and beat the cream cheese mixture until the texture from the sugar is no longer noticeable. Spreads nicely this way, and keeps its shape if chilled before serving. YUM.

So good you can eat it by the spoonful (well maybe bowlful!).  I have made this probably 2 dozen times.  Turns out amazing every single time.  Great as frosting and doubles as a fruit dip if have extra.  So tasty and versatile.

Followed tips (frozen bowl and whip, cold cream cheese, etc)....STILL super soft.   I was trying to frost a tall round layer cake.   Serious runny melted look after prepping per the recipe.   There's no way it would've held up to the sides of a vertical cake wall.   Had to dump in about 1-1/2 cups of powdered sugar to stiffen and that was only marginally helpful.   Overall, quite a disappointment as a "frosting".   The only reason I give it 3 stars is because I think I've just discovered a great new filling for one of my puff pastry desserts.    The people who said it would make a good fruit dip were also right on the money.

I let the cream cheese get to room temperature, and beat it slightly to ensure it will fold well.  I ALWAYS whip the cream in a chilled bowl (make sure you get nice peaks!), and I've never had a problem with it being runny. For some cakes, I use vanilla bean paste, which gives you great vanilla speckles.  Be sure to fold gently... no mixing!

Everyone loves this frosting; It is always a winner, and pipes extremely well! If you are topping cupcakes, be sure to half the recipe to save your ingredients.

Love, Love, Loved it!!!!!!!! I put it on a Mexican Fruit Cake. My husband loved it. The neighbors (4 different families) loved it. Took it to a family potluck and they all loved it. It's really not difficult. You just have to whip the cream enough, use powdered sugar, and you will have no problems. I feel like a rock star. Thanks for a fabulous recipe.

This has to be one of the best cream cheese frosting recipes I've ever made. I followed the Recipe and had no problems with it at all. For those who aren't Bakers the longer you beat the cream cheese and sugar together The smoother the product.. Five stars hands down!!!!

Wow.  I was nervous to make this bc of the mixed reviews and bc I usually have bad luck in my attempts to make things w heavy whipping cream.  I used 1 3/4 cup powdered sugar as others suggested bc I was frosting carrot cake cupcakes and I wanted to be sure the frosting would not fall flat.  I put my beaters and metal bowl in the freezer for a bit and whipped the cream for several minutes to get it thick.  Then I used the same beaters to whip the cream cheese mixture (room temp).  Folded together and the swirls on the cupcakes held up in the fridge overnight so we're good!  I doubled the recipe and did have quite a bit leftover and so glad bc it is amazing as a fruit dip for strawberries!  I plan to swirl some onto each plate as the cream to accompany the caramel macchiato cheesecake I also made for Easter- fancy and delicious!  Will definitely make again

powdered sugar works best, so it's not gritty. You HAVE to take your time with this and really make sure the cream peaks! Otherwise it can be kinda runny. a clean, DRY and cool / cold bowl helps. Delicious recipe and always runs the risk of not making it onto the cake!

I see where a lot of people are having issues with runny frosting. I have not had this problem with this recipe, but I have had that issue in the past with whipped cream. 
I use 1c powdered sugar and when the cream cheese mix seemed too stiff I added just a little granulated sugar to thin it out. I have found that using just granulated sugar makes it too loose. The powdered sugar stiffens and gives it more of a frosting consistency. Also I refrigerate my frosting until cake is totally cooled or served warm and add frosting at the table. (makes a yummy gooey mess with warm spice cupcakes)

I love this recipe: I dislike too sweet, grainy frostings; this is perfect, low sugar, light, and easy to substitute fake sugar(splenda) for all the diabetics. But the Splenda will make it more runny than powdered sugar.

I cut the recipe in half to make less, however I think I might have used the same amount of sugar... It was delicious... It was not runny I used it on top of cupcakes. I think it's possible the people who experienced it being runny you did not beat your heavy cream long enough. And I did not beat the whipped cream and the cream cheese together I mixed it in with a spatula. Definitly will make again.

I read the majority of the comments before i made them, some of which scared me, almost to the point of not trying it. However, with such high ratings, I figured it was successful for more people than it wasn't, so I went for it. A coworker had asked for a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, and I wanted something light. I followed the instructions to a T, with the exception of adding 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa with the sugar (I used granulated white), and the results were superb!  I used my Kitchen-Aid stand-up mixer, and literally drizzled the chilled whipping cream into the bowl as it was mixing. It turned out to be the perfect consistency for frosting (not for decorating) - exactly as the poster said - and it wasn't too sweet. In a word, it was PERFECT! My niece, who hates frosting, tasted it and told me I could use it on all her cakes! I am still trying to find the perfect buttercream, but this is going to be my go-to frosting. Thanks for the recipe!!

This tastes divine. The only problem I had was trying to mix the cream cheese mixture with the whipped cream -- it was very hard to get them to mix completely and smoothly. Some say that this doesn't pipe well or hold up well, but that was not my experience. I piped this onto cupcakes for my son's birthday, and it held up perfectly outdoors in 65 degrees for a couple of hours.

this recipe tasted wonderful, but was definitely not good for piping. if using it for a sheet cake it would be ok as you could pour in evenly over the cake, but to pipe with as the recipe claims its terrible.

Great recipe.  I only had one cup of whipping cream on hand.  I did not try to modify any other ingrediant.   Also I did squeeze a half of lemon in the cream cheese mix before I folded it with the whipping cream.  The designs are endless with this type of frosting.  Bundt cakes are hard to frost in my opinion. But I was able to v use a stucco pattern.  It turned out great

This is the best icing on the planet!  Light and the perfect cream cheese flavor.  I used confectioners sugar and whipped it so it was stiff peaks.  I chose not to add the salt, could not tell a difference.

A fantastic frosting --- very light!  It would never work on a heavy cake (like a carrot cake), but I made the red velvet cupcakes on this site submitted by McCormicks and it was DIVINE!   Definitely a keeper!  I'm in full agreement about the fact that it would never work as a "piping" frosting, but a chocolate cake or put in between some chocolate cookies for a "sandwich," it would be awesome --- a great topping for puddings, fruit, or lemon bars!

This frosting is amazing. Not too sweet, perfect for cupcakes. I used 1 cup powdered sugar instead. I've also made it with 3 tsp of cocoa powder and it tasted great. I found my go-to cream cheese frosting.

This frosting tastes great but it is a little too runny to actually do more than just "slather" it on the cake. It's delicious but not great if you are trying to make something look pretty! I would recommend maybe adding powdered sugar to thicken it? Or possibly using less whipping cream? Or maybe putting it in the refrigerator for a while first?

I loved this recipe! I used it for a cake filling on a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. It was delicious!

I did use this recipe for cupcakes because I love it so much. I just used 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar to thicken it up. I piped it using tip 1M and they came out beautiful.  FYI:I added fondant flowers but by the next day the fondant started to melt. They were fine for the party but the left over cupcakes were not so pretty.

I used 2 cups powdered sugar and a container of Cool Whip.  It turned out great and was easy to pipe and decorate.
I will defiantly use this recipe again!

Wonderful!
I used this frosting for cupcakes I brought to my husbands platoon (Army). 
Here at Fort Bliss it can be REALLY hot so I was worried about it melting. But it held up perfectly, even kept the details I piped.

Honestly, sooo many reviews complaining of being to runny. I adapted this by my own venture:
8 oz cream cheese softened
1 vanilla Hunts Pudding Cup 
1tsp vanilla
Beat w mixer til smooth
Fold in 8 oz cool whip
UNBELIEVABLE!!
So good you'll eat it til you're sick.
PS- I frosted a 9x13 with this and embellished the entire cake with sliced strawberries.
I used a french vanilla white cake.
Apologies for the modification....however this adaptation recipe is definitely worthy of a piping bag!!!

topped my strawberry cupcakes with this fantastic frosting, my only suggestion is to place items in freezing in between mixing, then refrigerate until the cream cheese sets back up.

This is to die for!!!! I have been searching for a recipe for whipped cream cheese frosting and I found it!!  I made red velvet cupcakes and made this frosting-need I say it made a big hit.  My daughters had friends over and they licked the bowel, not to mention the left over they were using animal crackers to eat the left over!  I am very pleased with the outcome and I plan to use it today the 4th of July.  It is out of this world!!!!!

too liquidy! Even though the whipped cream was stiff, with the cream cheese mix it was too runny!  I only took have of the sugar and it was sweet enough!

This worked perfectly, exactly as written. I did chill the whipping-cream bowl and made sure the whipping cream was very cold and the cream cheese was almost room temperature. 

I used it for a sheet cake. It's delicious.

I replaces sugar with Just like Sugar to make a diabetic friendlier version. Used exact measurements and it was very thick. Mine didn't turn out runny at all. Loved it.

I am amazed that this recipe has gotten any bad reviews!  This is by far the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had and I get rave reviews every time I use it.  I'm not sure this is suppose to be a piping type frosting if that's what you are looking for.  A trick I learn somewhere on the web was to beat warmed gelatin in with the whipped cream at the soft peak stage and then continue to beat until stiff peaks form.  The gelatin keeps the whipped cream from separating, and in a warm room the frosting won't melt.  Love it!!!

Truly a wonderful icing.  I followed one reviewer's advice and used 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar for the granulated sugar.  Also chilled the bowl and beater before whipping the cream.  The icing made enough to ice on 8-inch cake with one layer of icing between cake layers plus top and bottom borders.  It spread beautifully but I did put the iced cake back into the freezer since there was over seven hours before the cake was going to be served.  Took it back out about three hours before serving.  Used the icing on Sam's Famous Carrot Cake recipe.  Scrumptious!!

This is the taste in frosting I was always looking for - I followed the recipe to the exact measurements and am very pleased with the taste. I would like it to be firmer.  Otherwise, it is a great recipe.  For now I will keep the cake (or whatever) refrigerated until just before serving.  I will try some of the suggestions from the reviews.

Lighter than the other cream cheese frosting I usually use, but for me, personally, it tastes too much of whipped cream and too little of cream chesse.

Needed something light to use instead of whipped cream on Key Lime Tarts.  This was perfect- it piped on and held its' shape overnight in the fridge and for several hours at room temperature.  I prepared exactly according to directions.  I did chill my bowl and wire whisk in the freezer before whipping the cream.  I also piped it into the center of raspberries and served for dessert tonight- yum.

I think this recipe was the best so far! I wanted to make something light and airy for my daughters birthday. Not too sweet and still easy to pipe. This was that recipe. I was able to cover my daughters first birthday cake successfully. 
As others have said I couldn't stop licking the bowl. My friend wouldn't let me throw away the pipe she wanted to lick all of the icing from the bag and couldn't stop digging into my bowl as I worked to finish the cake. It was a complete success!
I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXACTLY! I didn't have any trouble with the consistency. I whipped the the heavy cream with a hand mixer for about 15-20minutes. I used COLD BOWL with COLD MIXER ATTACHMENTS. I had the metal mixing bowl in the freezer for at least 20minutes. UNDER THE BOWL was an ice pack. 
The cream cheese was set out at ROOM TEMPERATURE for 2 hours. 
For anyone adding food coloring I put my color into the cream cheese mixture with the other ingredients.
It was a very simple recipe! I am a complete amateur and it was perfect so I am pretty sure anyone can do it and then some.

Delicious without being overly, cloyingly sweet. I've used this recipe quite a few times, mainly for birthday cake frostings. I've tried both white sugar vs. powdered sugar and honestly don't notice a difference. I generally have leftovers, and it keeps nicely in the fridge for a few days - - it also makes a nice fruit dip!

As is it was grainy so i changed it up by making another batch with powdered sugar and that was better. I only used one cup of powdered sugar. I frosted sam's carrot cake from this site with this and it was a light and delicious compliment. Thank you.

I think this recipe is excellent for people like who don't like really sweet frosting.  It is a great alternative for buttercream.  I have seen a lot of people comment on how runny it is.  This will happen if you don't thoroughly whip your cream.  It needs to be REALLY stiff.  I also refrigerate the frosting overnight if I am going to pipe it.  It will lose a little bit of the shape, but not a lot.

Mine came out plenty firm to pipe onto cupcakes.  Great taste!  Added some cocoa powder to half of it to make chocolate icing, too.

great recipe! I didn't have any lumps, I stirred (with a fork) room temp cream cheese with sugar vanilla and salt until smooth. Then folded into whip cream it was easy and perfect. Everyone loved it.

The perfect icing for carrot cake. Fluffy and not too sweet like cream cheese icing tends to be.

Delicious! So easy to make and the best cream cheese icing I've tried. Even better than the fancy cupcake shops! Just cream chees-y enough without being too sweet. Perfect for red velvet cake :)

A delicious light cream cheese taste! Good consistency that held up over time. I only whipped to soft peak stage and it was very creamy! It was not very smooth when spread, however. Will try to go to stiff peak stage to see difference next time.

This is my favourite recipe for frosting. I make it exactly as the recipe states. I use it on everything, cakes, cinnamon buns (a fav), you name it.  I have never had any problems with it being runny, i have had a few little lumps of cream cheese, but no one seemed to notice.  As one reviewer said, whip the cream first and make sure its nice and stiff before you mix the cream cheese part, the oil from the cream cheese will affect the whipping cream if you do it the other way.

This is YUMMMMMY! Perfect cake filling, don't think I'd try to top the cake with it, but it isn't hard to make. Just follow the advise and use a chilled bowl & beater for the whipping cream and I beat the cream cheese until creamy smooth. I'd guess for about 5 minutes. Great recipe!!!

I loved the smooth texture with the cream cheese taste. I'd never piped frosting before so they weren't all that pretty, but I had no problems (which kind of surprised me). I didn't change a thing, but I was careful to make my whipped cream very thick and blended it with the cream cheese carefully to avoid lumps.

Light cream cheese icing is exceptional with banana nut bite mini cupcakes!  I made a tray of 48 and they were completely GONE at a brunch this morning.  I used less sugar and whipped cream cheese which was phenomenal!!  Bravo...

This unique recipe tasted delicious but runny.  I've been baking for 20 years, so I'm not new to this.  I did make my own modifications, like other readers, but won't rate this recipe based on my changes. It's a nice spin on traditional cream cheese frosting, though I thought it tasted more whip cream than cream cheese (not a bad thing, just an FYI).

My changes (because I won't pay to post a modified recipe. Meh, call me cheap): 1 3/4 c powdered sugar (thanks other reviewers) in original recipe.  It still stayed somewhat fluffy, yet runny, so I whipped 1 stick butter and about 1 cup powdered sugar in a mixer, added in original icing, and continued to whip in powdered sugar until consistency and taste i wanted.  It still tasted like whip cream, it still tasted like cream cheese.

The overall taste was great and it piped fairly well, however a little more stiffness to the texture would have gone a long way, great with coconut extract and flakes in it!!!

Any time I use a recipe from here I follow it exactly, and then tweak it to my tastes. This was good, although I did experience a little thinner frosting than I had hoped. I followed a few suggestions from the others, such as using a cold bowl for the cream and whipping it first before whipping the cream cheese. I think next time I will beat the whipping cream longer and use confectioner's sugar rather than crystalline sugar. It was very delicious though!!

This frosting is wonderful!! I used 
1 3/4 cups of powdered sugar and keep the ingredients cold while making the frosting. It piped better than any frosting I have ever made and the it tasted wonderful. The key is to make sure you whip your cream until it is very stiff.

This is a great tasting frosting.  I would use powdered sugar and clear vanilla though to keep the color whiter and smoother.  Don't over beat the cream, or you'll have a nice bowl of curdled cream, which by the way still tastes awesome and can be used like a clotted cream on scones and/or even on waffles with berries.  Always find uses for your mistakes ...!  Today I used this frosting like a scoop of ice cream on a Root Beer Float Cupcake.  adorable! (And yummy!)

I didn't have a problem with mixing the cream cheese or whipped cream together. I didn't chill or heat any bowls as some reviewers may have. The whipped cream I made doesn't really look like the photo. It's very airy and light (perhaps the picture is too far).

Delicious!  A delicate mouthfeel, lovely on a light textured cake.  I like that it doesn't harden like a rock in the fridge, which happens frequently with butter based frostings.  I frosted this on a light carrot cake and it was fantastic!  I highly recommend this recipe!

Soooo good. I used 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup powdered sugar. My cake wasn't really sweet so adding more sugar made sense for me. It didn't come out firm enough to do fancy cake piping but it did give my cake a nice fluffy look. DELICIOUS!

I love this icing. So easy! The only thing was when I went to use it right away, it was too soft and didn't spread right. But after being in the fridge for a while it worked fine!

I was looking for a whipped cream frosting that I could add colouring to without my frosting bleeding and am so grateful that this recipe fit that bill!  I followed the review that was rated most helpful about subbing icing sugar for regular but cut it back to one and a quater cups and even that was still a bit sweet for my liking.  Next time I'll cut the sugar down a bit more yet.

I made this last night to ice the outside of a lemon filled lemon cake. I added a few handfuls of raspberries to the cream cheese mixture and used a cup of icing sugar instead of regular. It was plenty sweet and iced the cake beautifully! Will Definately use this recipe often! Thank you!

This is probably the best cream cheese frosting I have ever had. The cream cheese flavor is not to over powering.

I only had whipped topping, so I incorporated that into the cream cheese. It was just as good! I actually forgot I added it and still added POWDERED sugar (because I didn't want grainy frosting with plain white). It wasn't bad at all. So just add sugar to taste. It was very soft and smooth.

This frosting is a delicious alternative to the traditional cream cheese frosting.  It is light, fluffy, not to sweet and has a nice cream cheese flavor.  I used powdered sugar instead of granulated (I was out of granulated) and halved the recipe.  It was light and smooth and was the perfect amount for a 13 x 9 carrot sheet cake.  I will definatly be making this again for other cakes and cupcakes.

Great tasting recipe. Needs 40% Heavy Whipping Cream. In an electric stand mixer, switch to the paddle attachment after whisk. This will eliminate air bubbles and result in a smooth frosting that pipes quite beautifully.

The whipped cream cheese frosting was a huge hit with my family.  It is lighter than a normal cream cheese icing.  after whipping the cream, and  then mixing the cream cheese and sugar together, I blended the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture and it turned out GREAT!!  You will love this :)

This is the best.  I even had to sign up just so I could say how much we love this frosting!  I followed the recipe as written except I only had 1 C heavy cream.  Still turned out perfect.  The piles of snow outside my door helped.  I put the heavy cream and glass bowl in the snow for awhile, the beaters in the freezer and my whipped cream formed under 2 minutes.  Pefect!

this was good.  Maybe a little bland, but I had no troubles when I whipped the cream really good and then in another bowl whipped the cream cheese really good.  Next time I may try the powdered sugar.

This is a great Whipped, Fluffy Frosting that I used on a red velvet cake.  I followed the recipe and used the recommended chilled beaters and bowl.  Outstanding results.  I was hesitant to use granular sugar, but am happy that I did.  I can't wait to try this basic recipe with other flavors.

Love this recipe. I used it on red velvet cupcakes.  I topped them with toasted coconut.  It has the richness of cream cheese frosting without being so heavy.  I also added some softened butter, because I like butter in my cream cheese frosting.  This recipe I will definitely make again.

I am not a professional in any sense of the word, but had no problems with consistency or lumpiness. Was able to decorate with this frosting as well. No changes to the recipe were required, just used HEAVY, not LIGHT whipping cream.

This frosting is amazing!  It makes cupcakes taste like those you pay $3.00 each for at the specialty cupcake shops!  It came out perfect for me, not runny at all as some have said.  I first softened my cream cheese at room temperature for about three hours and mixed it with the sugar and  vanilla until it was very light and fluffy.  I chilled my bowl and beaters before whipping the cream.  Then folded the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture using my Kitchenaide stand mixer on #1 on the mixer to "fold" in the cream cheese.  No lumps!  It was perfect.  This is my new favorite frosting!!!

I made this recipe EXACTLY AS IS and it was amazing. Like others have said, the trick to (any) frosting really is in the whipping process. Freeze your bowl and whisks prior to whipped the heavy cream. The cream cheese must be allowed to sit out at room temperature before attempting to cream. If it is too cold, you will have a lumpy result. If you do not whip the heavy cream to a very still peak, you will have a runny result. If made properly, this recipe is heavenly without adding any other ingredients.

I replaced the standard cream cheese frosting on my carrot cake with this frosting and sent the cake to an employee pot luck with my husband. He said that the carrot cake was delicious but everyone raved about the light tasting frosting. Excellent recipe.

I loved this recipe, however the cream cheese was too hard so there was zero chance to fold in the cream, so i whiped it in with the beaters. Still turned out great.  When making it again i will use a lot more cream cheese, as the flavour was a little drowned out by the flavour of the cream.

Made it using the exact ingredients.  I even creamed each batch using my machine, and then folded using the machine.  It was perfect.  A must have recipe!

This frosting is delicious I don't care for super sweet frosting, so this flavor is perfect and complemented the chocolate cake i used it on very well.   i followed the directions from some of the other reviews and made sure to whip the cream first (in a cold bowl, with cold beaters) and then did the cream cheese. worked perfectly. i also used powdered sugar, and if i wanted to pipe with it, i would have just added more sugar to stiffen it up, the consistency it was from the recipe as followed was not stiff enough to pipe.

This is wonderfully light and tastes like  whipped cheesecake.  I used the powdered sugar as others had suggested and it set up real nice. I put my cream cheese in the microwave for about 30 sec to help soften it up. I also put the frosting in the fridge while finishing up my cupcakes and it made it firm enough to pipe.

awesome!  not sure what's going on with the runny reviews- i chilled the bowl and made sure it and beaters were absolutely clean.  maybe the room's temp was too warm or they didn't beat it long enough.  it does take a little time.  this one's a keeper

Very good.  The granulated sugar makes the end product a little grainy, so if that is a concern, use powdered.  I only had 6 oz. of creme cheese, so the final frosting wasn't real cheesy--that was okay with me.  No problems with the frosting being too thin.  I prefer this to the traditional cream cheese frosting I had been using.  I vote two thumbs up.

This frosting is AMAZING!!!!!!! I could eat it right out of the bowl! Wow! And I had no problems with the consistency at all. I made sure I kept the ingredients cold which made it harder to beat but it turned out perfect! I may never use another frosting recipe again after making this one!!! Thanks for the awsome recipe! I would give it more stars if I could!

This is a great recipe by itself, and also a good base to play around with. It's quick and easy, and the consistency is perfect for decorating.. I added a drop of maple syrup to mine for a pumpkin cake and my family loved it. Thanks for sharing :)

I have to edit my first review.
I made this for my daughter's preschool class and 2 out of 18 children did not like the icing, that is pretty good for a bunch of 3 year olds.
I used powdered sugar and did not use the entire cup, but I put 4 tsp of corse sugar in with the whipped cream.  it was very yummy and light tasting.
I put the icing in the fridge over night before I pipped the minin banana muffins and it pipped very well.  I also kept them refidgerated untill they were ready to be eaten.
I will for sure use this recipe again although my cream cheese hating son does not like this recipe at all, I think it is a "healthier" alternative to the traditional butter and shortning icing.
oh and I used maple flavour instead of vanilla, but you could use pretty much any flavour you like.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I used this on top of red velvet cupcakes and it was fantastic!  A light and fluffy version of cream cheese frosting.  Make sure you use the heavy whipping cream, not a substitute, because that's what makes this recipe great.

This was relatively easy, not overly sweet, and it got pretty good reviews at work.  I think I didn't beat the cream cheese and sugar enough to get it light and fluffy, and my version would never have held up for piping.  But I believe it's possible.  I never bother with a chilled bowl or beaters for whipped cream - just throw it in the food processor and let it do all the work.  Be sure to stop before it separates into butter though =)

This is probably THE BEST frosting I have ever made.  The only thing was that when folding we couldn't get everything to really mix together so I ended up beating it at the lowest speed for about a minute and everything mixed perfectly.

This frosting is great!  But it was a little soft probably because I didn't get the peaks stiff and I was in a hurry because I was making them for a baby shower.  But I got so many compliments on them.  This frosting made the cupcakes awesome!!!

This is a very good frosting I use it for everything that needs frosted. I have also replaced the vanilla extract with almond extract and it was excellent.

Planned to use this frosting to top recipe from this site - Mary Ann's Carrot Cake - however, I'm passing on it. I was disappointed on both flavor and consistency. Whipping cream almost turned to butter; my fault for not watching more closely. Other ingred's beat smooth at sight, but were runny; also, grainy from white sugar. Add'g whipped cream didn't change consistency; it was still runny. Frosting was way too sweet for my taste buds. If I make this again I will substitute white sugar with Apriva, as "A" is more not so grainy. Some recipes work for me, some don't - trying a new one is what it's all about to become an expert "chef" in my kitchen. Thanks, Tom, for the challenge.

I loved this icing!  We used it on my sons birthday cupcakes and it was just right.  It was a bit soft but piped fine.  We weren't really looking for any great detail anyway - just cupcake coverage.  Unlike most icings this one was light - delicate - delicious!! Not too sweet with a velvety mouth feel that reminded me of whipped cream.  I usually scrape most of the frosting off my cakes and cupcakes but I ate every bit of this icing!  If you want something that will not overpower your dessert with a sickly sweet frosting this is it!

I, like other reviewers found this frosting a bit on the runny side (I don't actually think it was meant to be firm in the first place) but let me just say that I loooove cream cheese frosting and this one is in my top two on taste!

This was not firm but it was delicious! I used it to layer this pumpkin dessert and added cinnamon to it. I followed the directions exactly.

5 stars for flavour! For firm frosting that you can pipe, use Kraft Philadelphia cream cheese which comes in a brick. Other cream cheese will be too soft resulting in runny frosting.

Not quite as firm as I would have liked. I spread it onto the too much chocolate cake, and it kind of ran down the sides. Maybe more sugar next time. UPDATE: I have no idea why I decided to try this recipe again, but I did. I whipped the cream until it was almost solid it was so stiff, then I whipped the cream cheese and added the salt and vanilla. I then used about 3 cups powdered sugar instead of the 1 cup granulated (thinking this would make it smoother and thicker).... and lastly added the cream (which wasn't even a full 1 1/2 cups to start with).... but it was runny again! I added about a cup more powdered sugar, but it was starting to taste too sweet. I ended up making a different frosting, since I wanted to pipe this onto cupcakes, and its so runny that it would never stand up. A word of caution.... this stuff is delicious, but WILL NOT work for decorating.... pour it over your 9x13, but thats about all its good for.

I decided to make this frosting because I had whipping cream that needed to be used...I'm glad I did! Made exactly as written except little less whipping cream... an awesome frosting for a "last minute decision" 4 layer red velvet cake which was courtesy of Sunny ... Thanks Tom for a great frosting and Sunny for a terrific cake recipe!

This frosting had a great consistency, but was VERY cheesy. In the future, I will add more powdered sugar and probably a bit of vanilla. :) That is just my preference, however, and it is great for frosting and decorating! :)

This recipe is delicious.  I recently made it for a red velvet cake for a coworker's birthday, and it has now been requested for all future birthday cakes.  I just made it again today, and it came out perfect again.  I didn't make any changes, but I did chill the mixing bowl for a few minutes before whipping the cream.

Fabulous frosting. I used it on the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe from this site. I used 1.5 cups powder sugar instead of regular sugar and beat the cream until it was almost butter!  Came out fabulous.  Will definitely use again.

Ohh my!  Yes, this is good.  Made it with reduced fat cream cheese because that's what I had (not like it was going to save much in calories or fat, right?) and goodness...I think my family would like me to use this frosting all the time.  I was very surprised at how well the granulated sugar lost in "granularity" after the frosted cake had rested for a half hour or so.  I'd recommend a little longer though, as this is a very soft frosting and some chill time makes it a little easier to slice.

Wonderful frosting!!!  I have used it on Strawberry cupcakes (dreamy) and the most recent time I used it was for tarts.  I made small tart shells, cooled them, filled with this frosting and then topped with strawberries and strawberry coulis.  They were amazing.

This is my new favorite frosting!!! It makes enough to frost a layer cake, so easy to spread, and tastes delicious!  You must make whipped topping out of the heavy whipping cream or the frosting will be runny, so chill a bowl and some beaters, then beat until thick like cool whip. Then beat in the remaining ingredients.

This was very good, but it was a little grainy from the sugar.  I think next time I will replace the sugar for honey.  It isn't a frosting that you can pipe, but it's just an easy topping for a quick sheet cake!

This was awesome! A flavorful yet light icing. Not too sweet. I used this on a yummy chocolate cake and everyone raved about it. I cannot attest to the piping quality but the icing was fairly thick making it just as instructed, not runny for me at all. I did cool the mixing bowl before whipping the cream and beat the cream cheese first as earlier suggested. This will be used on many cakes of mine in the future, I guarantee it!

Delicious on carrot cake. Exactly what I was dreaming of. I used exact measurements and followed other's advice to ensure proper consistency and it turned out great!   Winning tips: - Chill a SMALL bowl and whisks in the refrig or freezer for 10 mins.  - Whip the cream BEFORE beating the creamed cheese (ensures no traces of creamed cheese or oils in your whisks) - Return the whipped cream to the refrig while you beat the creamed cheese/sugar - When done icing cake, put cake in refrig to set.

When I first made this icing, I wasn't sure if I would like it because it really tasted too strongly like cream cheese.  BUT once I frosted my cake and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight, it was fantastic!  Just what I was looking for.  I iced a double layer white cake with strawberry puree in it and topped with strawberries for a strawberry cake.

Wow.. My measurements were a bit off because I was using what I had on hand; 8oz of heavy cream whipped and then I added just about 1/4 cups sugar into the cream, whipped it and then threw in about 10oz. of whipped cream cheese and continued blending in same bowl.. I didn't add any vanilla because I like the flavor of cream cheese! Very good on my poke cake... Thanks!

This was fabulous! I can't stand cream cheese frosting or heavy frostings so it is great that the whipped cream makes the frosting so light. Maybe I got lucky but I just followed the instructions and it turned out great! I didn't have to chill anything special. The directions didn't specify any speed for the whipped cream and that was what I was worried about since I had never made it before. I just whipped the diddly out of it until the stiff peaks formed. :) I was a little afraid of it collapsing from my folding but, really, it held together very well. Only thing was, I found it really difficult to spread. Maybe I was just afraid of it because it was so light but even trying to pipe it didn't work well for me. So, yes, it was the ugliest cake I've ever made but the taste soooo makes up for it. :)  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was good, but not great. The flavor is nice and light, but it is too thin. I frosted a single layer strawberry cake, but I wouldn't use it on a layer cake or for piping.

I was looking for a frosting for a cake I made for a good friend, as she doe not like buttercream frosting (shocking!)  I saw this one and thought it would be perfect.  Cream cheese flavoring, but nice and light, not too heavy.  It is easy and quick to put together and tastes absolutely fabulous!  I couldn't be more pleased!  I doubled this recipe for a 1/2 sheet cake and had plenty to spare.  Kids can spread on graham crackers to use up the leftovers!  Quick and tasty treats.

Excellent - light, fluffy and not too sweet!  Make sure to chill your bowl and beaters before whipping the cream.  I substituted powdered sugar for the regular sugar.  I know it says to fold in (which technically means by hand) the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture, but I used the mixer on low speed until I got a normal frosting texture.

This is a great frosting!!!!!  I like several others who have reviewed use powdered sugar because I feel that it helps stabalize the frosting more because of the corn starch.  I like to omit the vanilla and use some fresh lemon juice and lemon zest and make it a lemon frosting for my lemon cake.  When I make it everyone asks for the recipie.  If you like it extra tart then I would squeeze several lemons and reduce the liquid in a sauce pan, let it cook completly and then add it to the cream cheese so as to not make it tooo runny.  I use vanilla and cinammon on pumpkin cake too it is great.

Awesome!  I whipped this up last minute for some birthday cupcakes.  This was a light sweet slightly cream cheesy flavor.  I put it on strawberry cupcakes and then used in little fruit tartlets.

This was such a success at my Grandaughter's Graduation party.  I used it as filling in a 3 layer Banana cake.  Because I was using it as filling, I wanted to be sure it would hold up to the weight of the cakes so I added a couple of Tablespoons of instant Banana Flavored pudding to the whipped cream. Very Yummy

Delicious! This was my first attempt at cream cheese frosting and it tastes great.  The whipped cream in the frosting seemed unusual and the consistency was a little more fluid than I expected but it was a great topping for an applesauce cake.

The taste was wonderful, but the consistancy was a little thin.  I'll doctor it up next time to make it a little thicker so a pastry bag can be used.

Made this yummy frosting for a mothers day cake and followed the advice of cooling beaters and bowl like previous cooks. We really enjoyed this as it was light and delicious and not quite as rich as plain cream cheese frosting.  I will definitely make this again and thanks for sharing this with us - it's a keeper!

I made this frosting for a chocolate layer cake with strawberry filling and it was fabulous!  I took others' advice and put the bowl and beaters in the freezer and whipped the cream first and then put the whipped cream in the freezer while I made the cream cheese part.  I also ran the bowl for the cream cheese part under hot water and let the cream cheese sit on the counter to soften for about a half hour before I mixed it.  And I used 1 cup of powdered sugar and a half cup of cocoa powder (my son wanted chocolate frosting) instead of the regular sugar.  I then popped the whole thing back in the freezer while I made the strawberry filling for my cake, so that may have firmed it up a bit too.  It was light and fluffy but still firm and I could have done piping with it if I had needed to, so it definitely was not runny or lumpy at all.  Thanks a bunch for the great recipe!

Absolutely the best cream cheese frosting I have ever had/made. I would give it 10 stars if I could. I did put the bowl, beaters and whipping cream in the freezer for a few minutes before I whipped it. I whipped the cream first then the cream cheese mixture. I put it on carrot pineapple cake l (from this site) and everyone loved it.

This was really good. Stable enough to frost a cake but not to decorate with. Next time I'll have to adjust the liquids. Hopefully I'll be able to decorate with it. Used for "Frosted Banana Bars."

This is by far the best frosting that can be used for just about any cake.  It is so light and fluffy.  It is not too sweet or too cream cheesy.  I have people request this frosting any time I am asked to do desserts.  Give it a try.  You will not be disappointed.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because without the heavy cream the recipe by itself is great, but because I read all the reviews before using it and changed the amount of ingredients I felt I could not give it the full credit that it deserved.   I have to agree, like many reviews before me who said the filling was way too water, I added 3 tablespoons of heavy cream only after I mixed all the ingredients. My grandfather always used to say (he was one of the best bakers I know) you can always add flavor and texture, but you can never take out.   Also, since I was going for a filling and wanted a custard type filling. I used granulated sugar instead of confectioners sugar. I find when you use confectioners sugar the outcome is more of a frosting and not a filling.    Over all my strawberry cream cheese filling came out wonderfully.

This frosting DOES hold it's shape. You can pipe it if you want as long as you make STIFF peaks with the whipped cream.  Great flavor! If you refridgerate, cover it well. It will absorb any flavor in your fridge. Will use this again.

This was an awesome frosting for the banana bars I made.  I didn't use all the whipping cream that I whipped up, because I like my frosting to be a little sweeter, and instead of the gran sugar I used about 2 cups powdered sugar.  Turned out awesome!  Will def use on a carrot cake too.  Great recipe!!  Thank you!!!

This frosting is decadent, yet light and fluffy. I used it to frost a plain yellow cake and got rave reviews. This also makes a yummy dip with fresh apple slices or strawberries. My kids love it sandwiched between graham crackers too.

I liked this recipe.  It was the first time I ever made whipped cream and it was very good.  I do agree that it was difficult to pipe, but the taste was fresh and simple.  Took to an office birthday and all loved it.  I did only use 3/4 cup sugar and next time will try 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar, as I think it was still a little too sweet, but very good.  Cake was gone in minutes!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious.  Not too sweet for those who don't like buttercream, but plenty sweet for those who do!  Really yummy with the Frosted Banana Bars from this site.

DELICIOUS! I used 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar instead of 1 cup regular sugar and it turned out perfectly.

Love it!!! Sooo good. I did NOT use the salt and I used 1 3/4 powdered sugar... I also followed chubss suggestion--used a chilled bowl for the whipping cream. It thickened just fine!

I have used this several times now.  I really like it.  I always taste to make sure the sugar dissolves in and have no problems.  Sometimes I use a little less sugan than the reicpe calls for but it depends on how sweet the cake it.  I have never tried to pipe it but it works great for simply frosting cakes and cupcakes with a knife.

This was EXCELLENT!  I used powdered sugar instead of white sugar and it was perfect. I made chocolate cupcakes for my son's 2nd Birthday party and everyone gobbled these up!  Will make again, super easy and tasty!  I did chill the frosting for an hour before topping the cupcakes and keep the cupcakes chilled until eaten....PERFECT!

Frosting came out perfect for my red velvet cake. It's not runny at all! Very fluffy and tasty. The key is to beat the heavy whipped cream until it is whipped.

This is an AWESOME frosting.  Rave reviews from everyone.  It is important that you whip the heavy whipping cream until it is VERY stiff.  I think this is why people say it is runny.  It is not runny at all if you follow the directions and use the proper ingredients/techniques.  Fabulous and not overly sweet.

Absolutely perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly, using a chilled bowl/beater for the whipped cream.  I piped 6 dome shaped cakes - the frosting was light enough to make piping easy, but thick enough to maintain it's shape through my daughter's 1st birthday party.  By far my FAVORITE frosting recipe I've ever had!

This frosting turned out wonderful and it was light and delicious.  I did not change this recipe at all.  I did not find it runny.  I put a bowl and beater in the freezer before hand.  I whipped the cream for more than 5 minutes on high speed to get the whipped cream consistency that I liked.  Before I frosted the cake, I put it in the fridge for about 1/2 hour.  I used it on a red velvet cake.  It makes enough for a 2 layer 9x13 cake.

My first attempt making homemade frosting!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really good.  Hubby & I really liked the flavor and kept stealing licks from the bowl.  I do have to say that mine came out way too soft for piping, and I kept it in the fridge for quite awhile.  I just ended up spreading the frosting on with a knife.  I will be making this again, we really liked the nice and fluffy texture of this frosting.

This is the yummiest!  It is not the best for piping however.  You can do a border, stars and writing.  Don't expect to get a good rose out of it.  I will definitely make this again because it is the best tasting.

This icing was really great.  We used it with the Black Magic Cake from this site and it was a perfect match.  We had no problem spreading the icing on the cake (we put the bowl and beaters in the freezer in advance) - but we used the icing on the cake right away (didn't have to put it in the fridge at all before frosting). I does however make extra - and it's in the freezer for now.  Not sure how/if we will use it.  I would reduce the recipe by 1/3 if making a two-layer 8 or 9 inch round cake.

Awesome recipe and a big hit at a friend's birthday party! My only substitution was that I used confectioner's sugar. I had no problem with it being too runny. I whipped the cream and put it in the fridge while I mixed the cream cheese.  I had enough frosting to cover two 9 x 13 cakes. Everyone raved about the taste, it was delicious and just right, not too heavy on the cream cheese flavor and not too sweet.  Thanks!

I wish I had tried this as-written. Replaced 1 cup sugar with 1 3/4 powdered sugar as suggested, but wasn't that happy with how it turned out (too tangy tasting). So I whipped an extra 1/2 cup of cream and added a handful each of white and powdered sugar, along with more vanilla. I added it to my bowl and it was perfect! I had way too much frosting for my cake, but I wasn't complaining! Turned out very soft and creamy - white sugar would probably have come out "stiffer".

I love this frosting! It tastes perfect with pumpkin cupcakes, and I can't wait to try it on some carrot cake! The only recommendation I have is letting the cream cheese warm up a bit before blending.

This frosting was excellent!  Very light and fluffy.  I used orange extract in place of vanilla and it was phenomenal!  However,  like other reviewers noted, the consistency   was not as stiff as I would have preferred.

Absolutely Fabulous! The key is to really whip stiff peaks in the whipping cream, takes about 5 minutes and then when you add everything together, mix until smooth! Takes a little longer than you think, those clumps everyone gripes about will smooth out! I gave my 10 month old a sample when I was done, and he went crazy with excitement! He couldn't get enough! Got wonderful reviews from others too.

This recipe was o.k.  Like others have said, the frosting was way too soft.  Because others cautioned about this I used this as a filling, rather than a frosting.  It was still just too soft.

I didn't have vanilla so I used almond extract and the taste was great. i also used Z-sweet instead of sugar so mine didn't dissolve, but it still tastes good. I love the consistency and the little tangyness the cream cheese gives it. Very yummy!

this was a really easy icing to make, I was worried about making it since it was my first time making something like this. everyone loved it. I followed some of the tips about keeping the whip cream cold and the cream cheese, so i didnt have the drippy icing.

Delicious. I am new to baking, and found the 2-bowl method fool-proof. I made the cream cheese mixture first and left it out overnight. The next morning I whipped the cream in a separate bowl. I gently stirred the contents of the two bowls by hand and frosted spice cake cupcakes. I received so many compliments! Frosting held up well and did not slide for 8 hours before serving.

Totally the best frosting I've ever made!  Thanks for this easy delicious recipe that I could frost and decorate my carrot cake with.
Kept the bowl, cream and beater cold until whipping, and used another bowl for the cream cheese and sugar. Used the wire wisk on my Kitchen Aid and the cream came out perfectly in less than 5 mintues.
It came out wonderful.

Fantastic!  This is also great as a fruit dip.  Be sure to beat the ingredients until the sugar disolves; it may take several minutes.

This was WONDERFUL! I used it in combination with the Awesome Carrot Cake recipe from this site. I made carrot cupcakes for a shower and wanted a fluffier frosting than the usual cream cheese frosting. This was divine and I had no troubles with it at all. Everyone fell in love with this frosting. Will make again!!

Not too good in my book.  But other people liked the frosting so I bumped the rating up to a three.  Tasted more like whipped cream than cream cheese frosting.

I was looking for a Pumpkin Whoopie Pie filling because I do not like the shortening in the original recipe.  This worked out great.  I doubled the recipe and added a 3.5 oz box of instant cheesecake pudding mix to it.  It is defintely a keeper.

It has a good taste but I can't get it to a piping consistency, even after sitting in the fridge for a while.  I did color it with liquid coloring, but it wasn't pipeable prior to that.  I beat the cream to a super thick consistency and it didn't help at all.  This really isn't even good for spreading it's so thin.  I ended up dipping my cupcakes upside down in the frosting, then sticking them in a bowl of sprinkles to cover up the mess.  I'm not sure what happened here, but I don't think I'll be trying this one again.

This was delicious! I used my KitchenAid wisk attachment rather than the paddle attachment to beat the cream cheese until it was smooth before I added the rest of the ingredients, so I didn't have any lumps at all. I also used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar. Then I put my mixer on the lowest speed and mixed in the whipped cream in three parts so it would stay nice and fluffy by the time I added the last bit. I had time before I had to decorate, so I refrigerated my frosting for a few hours before I used it and at that point it was the perfect consistency to pipe onto cupcakes.

I didn't have any cream, so I used whipped topping in place of the first step.  So easy, and it turned out great!

The perfect frosting recipe!! Everyone loved the frosting, it is so tasty. Yum! I whipped the cream cheese for awhile in the mixer until there were absolutely no lumps. Meanwhile I put the other bowl in the freezer for the whipping cream. Once both were done I folded the cream cheese in and frosted my cupcakes. Very simple, and soooo good.

I just made this today and it is amazing! Make sure the bowl and beaters you use for whipping the cream are well chilled and careful not over whip. Also, whip your 'softened' cream cheese first before adding anything to ensure there are no lumps. After folding the 2 together, I used the mixer for a couple seconds just to blend it a little better. I'm going to try piping it onto some cupcakes this weekend.

The flavor was EXCELLENT, but I found it to be kind of thin and runny when I frosted my cake.  I used this to frost and fill a two-layer 10 inch round and had a little left over.  It held up well as long as I kept the cake cold!

This recipe was sensational. I made it for a birthday party and everyone raved about this frosting. Even my mother-in-law  -who was trying to convince me that I should just mix the cream cheese with the icing sugar and go that route. I'm so glad I didn't. 

I did use about 1.5 cups of powdered sugar instead of regular sugar. I whipped the cream first and then stuck it in the freezer while I beat the cream cheese and powdered sugar. It was super easy to make and it tasted so great. 

I would make this as a fruit dip in the future.

Absolutely delightful! Definately chill mixing bowl and beaters for whipped cream portion! I used half splenda and half powdered sugar for a low-cal version. My mom enjoyed the frosting a little too much and licked the bowl clean!

I made this recipe with the following changes: 1 cup powdered sugar, and a half-pint of whipping cream.  I combined the whipped cream and the cream cheese together with my mixer on low.  It was fast, easy, and turned out DELICIOUS!  I can't wait for another excuse to make this frosting.  Everyone loved it.
Oh, and it held up very well, even hours later.  Very spreadable, not too soft at all.

I wanted to use a cream cheese frosting for a layered chocolate cake.  I was a little concerned that layers of cream cheese might be a bit overwhelming.  This recipe was perfect for layering and it was very spreadable.  It still has a nice cream cheese flavor, but it is light enough that if you eat a whole piece of cake it won't send your heart racing from sugar overload.

Subbed in 1 cup of icing sugar for the white sugar and it had the perfect consistency for frosting a cake, not runny at all.  Delicious, will use this recipe again!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I've been using it for years to frost my carrot cake.  I add a little cinnamon and nutmeg for a nice compliment to the cake.  I noticed many state it isn't stable enough but I have never had a problem with it, and I always make a torted 3-layer round cake.  That said I added gelatin to stabilize it for a Mad Hatter type cake to ensure it held up to the structure and sugar and fondant decorations that I am putting on it.  It just wasn't worth using buttercream cream cheese frosting because the taste doesn't compare!

I must have did something wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly, it wasn't fluffy and full as I had hoped.  But the overall taste was delicious!!!

This is wonderful!!! I had to stop myself from eating spoonfulls out of the bowl. I use this as a filling for cakes. I made a chocolate fudge cake with mocha expresso buttercream and folded a gourmet raspberry filling into this cream cheese frosting and it was to die for!!!

Tasty frosting but definitely not for piping.  It is very runny and I followed the recipe to a tee.  I could not even frost my cake, I had to pour it over the case, which gave an alright drip effect but not what I was expecting.

Awesome, amazing...WOW excellent recipe.  Made it exactly and that is a feat in itself I always seem to change things up.  This is the perfect frosting to complement a cake and not take away from it.  Light and fluffy and tastes just awesome. Might have to make it with a bit of creme of tartar to frost a carrot cake bet it would be awesome. I used it to frost the Strawberry Cake from Scratch recipe from this site also.  Was amazing.

I've made this a few times now and it is awesome! My husband says it is the best frosting he has had. I've used regular white sugar and powdered sugar, and I can't tell a difference in taste. Not overly sweet, but sweet enough. Just perfect. Thanks for sharing!

Made this last night to top a carrot cake.  Only thing I changed was used powdered sugar instead of regular.  We loved it!  The flavor was great, not too sweet, and the texture was light and fluffy.  My husband's only complaint was that it was too fluffy for carrot cake, but will use again.  Would be a good cupcake frosting.

I followed the advice of other reviewers... I beat the cream until it was VERY stiff and whipped the cream cheese with the sugar until there was no possibility for lumps. I served it on a banana sheet cake and it was delicious.

I made this for a luncheon today for 40 ladies.  I used this frosting with the Strawberry Cake from Scratch.  There are not words to express how delicious this was.  There were many compliments.  I am planning on using this next week for a bridal shower.

I made this frosting for St. Patty's day cupcakes (I added green food coloring, of course).  It came out amazingly!  Everyone at the BBQ loved it and impressed I made it myself.  If you follow the directions carefully, it is not even remotely runny.  I am not a professional pastry chef and I found it pretty straightforward and simple.  

Also, I had a lot left over and left it in the fridge and it became thicker, still.  I made a second batch of cupcakes just so I could eat more of this tasty frosting.

This tasted just great, but the consistency is not appropriate for "frosting" - it is really more of a whipped topping that you would put on fruit of some sort.  Not sure how to make this thicken up better and not melt all over a cake??

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!
Cream cheese frosting is my fav, but many recipes turn out to be too rich.
This frosting is lite & fluffy and so easy to make.  I too went along with the suggestions & chilled my mixing bowl before whipping the cream.
This is a recipe that will stay a family favorite - thanks for submitting!!

Absolutely delicious! Followed others suggestions and chilled my beater and bowl before whipping the cream until stiff.  Then gently folded in the cream cheese/sugar mixture.  Had no problems with it being drippy, even decorated it with canned decorator icing with no problems.  Everyone devoured the cake and gave me 2 thumbs up on the icing!! YUM......Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is wonderful!  I'm a huge cream cheese frosting fan but I wanted something a little different for the strawberry cake I made (from this site), so I thought I would try this.  I had no problems with it being runny at all.  I followed the recipe to the "T".  It turned out light and fluffy with that yummy taste of cream cheese.  Don't hesitate to make this frosting!!

I followed other reviewers advice & let the cream cheese get almost warm and the whipping cream very cold. I added the sugar & vanilla to the whipped cream then folded the whipped cream into the cream cheese.  I thought it was very tasty & great addition to my lemon cake.

I hate powdered-sugar frostings, and this was a great alternative. Very delicious and perfect for sheet cakes or a filling for layer cakes. If you put only a little extra effort it is great for frosting layer cakes too, but it is excellent as is.

Make up your heavy whipping cream first...chill it while mixing "cold" cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and salt. Beat cream cheese mixture until it is smooth (about 3 mins.) Fold in heavy whipping cream gently for several minutes until mixture is smooth. This made a basic boxed white "sheet" cake taste fantastic!

The flavor was wonderful, but the consistancy, even with chilled cream, warm cream cheese, and letting it chill overnight, was still thin and soupy. I ended up adding quite a bit powdered sugar to thicken it up - it worked, but made the taste slightly 'off'.
Definately will not use this again.

OH MY GOSH!!! This is the BEST cream cheese frosting I have EVER had!!!  Thanks to the post about whipping the cream seperately (thank you!) it turned out perfectly!  You can make it exactly--according to the recipe and it is very easy.  I did put my glass mixing bowl in the freezer for probably half an hour first.  It might have taken 3-4 minutes to whip it to stiff peaks.  It is absolutely YUMMY...and was enough to frost an entire 2-layer cake, and have maybe a cup left--to use as a fruit dip!  I can't wait to see my son's reaction (it's his 20th birthday)!!! This will no doubtedly be a new family favorite!

This is an easy and versatile recipe. I know it says frosting, but this is also great as a fruit dip or other kind of whipped topping. One thing however, make sure your ingredients are nice and cold from the fridge, otherwise you'll have a runny frosting if they've set out to room temperature. 

Great recipe :)

WICKED AWESOME!  I made this to go with pumpkin pancakes Thanksgiving morning and then with the pumpkin pie later that day.  The whip cream was more of a hit than the pies - and when it came time to divvy it all up - everyone wanted to take it home, so I ended up with none.

This frosting was so good on the pumpkin gobs (also from this web site) I chilled the whipped cream and the cream cheese was at room temperature and instead of mixing into two seperate bowls I just blended it all together and it was great...thank you for the great recipe

Made this to go over a chocolate cake for my daughter's 3rd birthday.  Absolutely amazing!  I followed the directions as written and had no problems with it being runny at all.  I will make this again and again, this is the best frosting I've ever made!  I am still surprised at how thick the heavy whipping cream can get.  When I thought it was done, I just kept mixing it and it got even more stiff.  I think this frosting can stand up on its own, it's so thick!  My mom actually said this is the best frosting she's ever had.  She doesn't had out comments like that casually!  EVERYONE and I mean everyone at the party wanted the recipe :)

This frosting is perfect!  I made this for my son's chocolate birthday cake and it was delicious.  Not over the top sweet, but sweet enough with a little tangy zip to it.  Nice light consistency, but stiff enough to pipe.  Everyone Loved this frosting. This is going to become a staple for all of my cakes from now on.

I made this frosting to go with carrot cake. After reading the other reviews, I chilled my bowl and whisk and had my cream cheese at room temperature.
I can usually make whipped cream with no problems. But, there has to be something wrong with this recipe. My "frosting" was never close to stiff enough to pipe. When I got it as stiff as I could, I tried to spread it on the cake with a butterknife and it was just sliding right off. It was this big goopy mess. 
I thought maybe the taste would save this "frosting". Wrong. The taste was just okay. It certainly wasn't worth the hassle.
I'm going back to my original frosting recipe. Sorry!

This is a terrific recipe. Not too sweet, sets up well and does not "melt" on the cake like so many white frostings tend to do. I used this on a chocolate cake for my daughter's third birthday and made a double batch (we love frosting). It is great to use for decorating too. I will use this one again and again.

I thought that is recipe was great.  I made it with just a boxed Devil's Food cake mix and sliced fresh strawberries.  The BEST CAKE I have ever made!  I have done it twice now and have zero complaints.  I would agree with the the other review that said that you cannot pipe with it.  It is a little soft and does work better if it can sit in the fridge for about 1 hour befor frosting your cake. I would also no recommend leaving your cake out of the fridge for very long when serving.

This is one of the best frostings I've ever tasted.  I don't even like frosting that much and I couldn't stop eating the left over frosting.  I made it with lemon chiffon cake and sprinkled coconut shavings and powdered sugar over the top.  Even my friends who don't usually like cake loved this.  Creamy and mellow.  Not a very stiff frosting.  I wouldn't use if for fancy decorating, just a great tasting frosting for a light cake.

I did not chill bowl or beaters, I did not use separate bowls, I just did what the recipe said, and it was perfect.  It was not lumpy, runny, I even flavored half of it and it was wonderful.  Do not know why 'the pros' are having trouble with it.  Seems you have to be an amateur to follow directions,  maybe that is what it takes to be a success with this, ya think?

LOVE this. It is light and fluffy and not very sweet. I used powdered sugar and just "eyeballed" it. I also added some to the whipping cream after i had it whipped. I combined the cream cheese mixture and whipped cream in the mixing bowl (stand mixer) on "stir", kind of pulsing it, to combine it thoroughly. I used this w/ a chocolate layer cake, with strawberry jam and a layer of frosting in between the layers. There was plenty of frosting for a 9" double layer cake and the husband/ kids to lick. This does not taste like a sugary butter cream, so if that is what you like, it may not be your thing. We all loved it.

The flavor was delicious.  This is a very light and runny frosting.  I used it to ice cupcakes.  I refrigerated them overnight because I was serving them the next day.  Overall good.

I did everything exactly, even freezing the bowls ect.ect. Mine turned out runny too. I had to make another batch just to thicken it up without the whipped cream.  It tasted good though, I just wish i could have piped it.

The frosting tasted very good. I have made this before using cool-whip and it really tastes about the same. I just felt with this  particular recipe the texture overall was not firm enough, almost runny. I beat the cream until it formed stiff peaks so I thought I did it right, but who knows? I used this to frost some cupcakes using a ziplock baggie with a tiny piece of the corner cut. If the frosting holds it's shape it will look perfect tomorrow for the potluck I'm attending. If you need a firm frosting, this may not be the best choice. Also refrigeration is a must, keep that in mind.

Oh so yummy :) I couldn't get the whipped cream to the right consistency, I guess the bowl and beaters were not cold enough, but it was still delicous. Thanks for the recipe :) I served this on top on banana nut cake, mmmmm, to die for.

This is an awesome all around cream cheese frosting, that is not too sweet.  I have varied the recipe a couple of times, using the flavored (strawberry and fruit cream swirl) softer cream cheeses and it is wonderful.  It is a common request at family, work gatherings.  I use this frosting, and make a layered white cake with raspberry pie filling between layers and they think I'm Martha Stewart!!!!  (I won't tell them how easy it really is)

This was the best!!  Everyone loved it!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Chilled the bowl & mixers for the whipping cream & beat until very stiff.  Mixed the cream cheese at room temp with vanilla & sugar until creamy.  Not runny at all just perfect!!

This frosting was tasty and easy to make. I used it on a homemade strawberry cake and it was really yummy.  It wasn't too sweet but had a very nice texture and flavor.  I will use this again.

Such a winner!  I've been looking for a whipped cream frosting recipe that won't wimp out after a day.  This is it!  I used it on a black forest cake and the frosting stood up perfect for days.  Plus... it tastes wonderful too!

This is the first recipe I have taken the time to review.  It was absolutely delicious and I had no trouble with getting it to the perfect consistency.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and chilled my bowl and mixers, then I put the mixing bowl in a larger bowl filled with ice to keep it chilled while I was mixing.  Perfect!!!
Thanks for recipe!

WOW! This recipe saved the day! My youngest was born on Christmas day. We've always saved the evening to celebrate her birthday. She asked for whip cream frosting on her cake.  I had found another whip cream recipe that sounded easy and good. What a disaster! I was tired and ready to just dab Cool Whip on slices. She sat quietly. I got on the internet and found this recipe. I had the ingredients, gave it a shot and the day was saved! I have since wondered if flavored Jell-O could be used to make flavors. I have to give it a try!

Not a huge favorite , probably my mistake, I get confused when recipes call for White sugar, does that mean powdered sugar or granulated sugar?  I used powder for this frosting.  It seemed to not be sweet enough and I added extra!  Oh well will try with granulated next time.

My brother-in-law requested an angel food cake with cream cheese frosting for his birthday.  I thought my regular cream cheese frosting would be too heavy for this cake, so I went looking and found an alternative in this recipe.  It was exactly what I was looking for!  It was a perfect topping for an angel food cake.  Not too sweet and with just the right amount of cheesiness needed for an angel food cake.  I prepared the recipe as is and had no problems.  I feared the granulated sugar would be too grainy in the frosting, but it dissolved when it was mixed with the whipped cream.  The frosting was spreadable and not too runny (it's all in the whipping cream preparation).  AND it was pipe-able!!!  I won't change a thing.

I thought this frosting was outstanding!  I used it on Pumkin sheet cake (here on all recipes) and the cake disappeared.  Maybe it's not good for piping, but the texture and lightness of this frosting due to the cream makes it kind of like a cross between whipped cream and frosting.  I will make again and again!

This is the best frosting I have ever had.  I have made this several times just like the recipe said.  I think the key is getting the whipping cream the right consistancy in the beginning.  My husband requests this all the time.  It tastes great on spice and butter cream cakes.

use about half the sugar- too sweet!  organic brown sugar works well.  i used less whipped cream to bring out the cream cheese.

DELISH!  Made this for Easter to put on Sam's famous Carrot cake and it was the best thing ever.  I will always use this frosting anytime something calls for this type.  It wasn't too sweet which I don't like so it was perfect and made plenty.  I never eat frosting even the whipped cream frostings on cakes because they just are too sweet and rich, this can be eaten with a spoon and put on just about anything.  Thanks for a great frosting!

So light and fulffy with the addition of the whipping cream. I used icing sugar instead of granulated. Very good!

This was so yummy!  I used it w/the best brownies recipe...my husband and mom could not get enough.  I would suggest giving yourself more time to make this, it took a good 10-15 minutes to get the cream to form stiff peaks and I used an electric mixer...but worth every minute!

I just made this super easy recipe and frosted an orange layer cake for my 32 year old son's birthday party tonight. It's a dream to look at and I can't wait until everyone take a bite. I'm already looking forward to the many variations I can think of. It's in my permanent recipe box for sure.

Who needs store bought frosting when you can make a recipe as tasty and easy as this one?  I would recommend allowing the cream cheese to get to room temperature before creaming with sugar, etc.

I made this instead of using the pre-made "tub" frosting and the cake was so good.  There was extra left over so I used it on grilled Pineapple slices that I made a few days later.  The texture and sweetness it so perfect.

This frosting was too sweet for me, I could really taste the sugar granules. I ended up mixing in cocoa to make it a cholocate frosting instead which tasted great and took the sickly edge off it. If I wanted it to remain just cream and cheese I would reduce the sugar.

This frosting was not at all stable enough to ice a cake. This would be great as a dip for fruit or even a filling, but a frosting? NO...There just isn't any stability in it especially for piping as the recipe says....I followed all the chilling protocol before making the whipped part, and can tell you that there is absolutely no stablizer present for this icing to be used to frost a cake or decorate. I wish I had read some of the reviews before I wasted my time and money.

My husband loves this since he doesn't like really sweet frosting. The combination of whipped cream and cream cheese makes a light, fluffy frosting. The only reason I didn't rate it a "5" was because I like really sweet frostings. If I were making it for me, I'd add a little more sugar.  I chilled my bowl & beaters and had no problem getting thick frosting.  For those who think this is too runny, be patient and really whip the cream until it's really stiff.  Also, be careful not to stir too much when mixing with the cream cheese mixture.  I increased all the ingredients to use the entire 2 cups of whipping cream and had enough to frost an 8" three layer cake and still have almost 2 cups of frosting left! It will be good on bagels or cinnamon rolls.

We have a child in this house who is highly intolerant to refined sugar so I had to find a recipe that didn't use 4 cups of sugar!   This recipe is awesome.  I used organic sugar (crystallized sugar cane juice) blended to a fine powder.  I also added 1/2 cup cocoa to the cream cheese portion and 1/2 cup cocoa to the whipped cream portion.  I will adjust those to 1/4 and 1/2 respectively next time as the whipped cream portion was lighter in color and took more time to fold in.  Lovely light frosting that is not sickeningly sweet.  This cake sat on the counter all day and I had no problems with it getting too soft as some readers say, also had no problems piping it.

The taste is really great.  I used this on Banana Bars from this site and also as a fruit dip later on.  I chilled the bowl & beaters first, then whipped everything together (Blending cream cheese, etc. first then whipping in cream).  Nice flavor, lightly sweet, with a creamy texture.  Don't think I would use it on a regular cake though, but that's just me.

A wonderful recipe. I used it on a strawberry cake, and then topped it with chocolate covered strawberries and it was fantastic. Got lots of rave reviews at a party. I put the beaters and the metal bowl I was using in the freezer first so they were very cold, then whipped the cream until it was stiff, put it back in the fridge while whipping the cream cheese mixture and the frosting was a perfect consistency for spreading. Will definitely make this again.

The flavor of this is wonderful.  I did have a slight problem with the thickness, or lack thereof, but I also let my cream cheese get soft.  I will certainly try again!

This is the BEST frosting ever.  Once you try this, there's no other frosting you will like close to as much.  I have used this on Banana Nut Cake, chocolate cake, I even had a friend ask me to make the frosting for her little girls birthday cake. My whole family loves this frosting.

Wow! Light and fluffy with a mild, not-too-sweet, cream cheese flavor. I used it on the banana bar recipe found on this site. Not sure I could have piped it as it was quite soft, but I did forget to put it in the refrigerator as others suggested. I will definitely be making this again.

I should have listened to some of the other reviews...this was an awful recipe.  A very good taste, but as with some others, it did not set at all.  I even chilled it for awhile, but still never hardened the least bit.  It ruined my cake and I will never make it again.  I highly do NOT recommend this recipe.

My husband loved it. I normally don't like  any kind of frosting, but this was pretty good...perhaps a little too sweet for my taste. I'll add a touch less sugar next time.

I made this last night and it was incredible!  Absolutely the best frosting I've ever made.  Mine started to melt a bit when I first put it on the cake but then I realized that though the top of the cake felt cool, the bottom was still warm.  I let it cool COMPLETELY and used the rest to re-do the cake and it was perfect and beautiful and best of all, TASTY!  I'll be using this one forever!  And it's impossible to not start "tasting" this one over and over while you wait for the cake to cool so make extra.  Also was excellent on a few strawberries that I had in the fridge....

This is the best cream cheese frosting I have ever made!  It isn't too rich and has a nice cream cheese flavor.  It would be good used as a fruit dip, I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

not quite the traditional cream cheese frosing, but still quite good.  i added about 3/4 c. powdered sugar just for the heck of it.  next time i think i might add lemon juice in place of or in addition to the vanilla just to give it a bit more kick.  either way, it was realy good.  i made it for the "best ever" cinnamon rolls, also on this site.

This has got to be the best cream cheese frosting ever!  My family loved it!!  Thanks to those that advised to make sure the cream cheese is softened before making.  I followed their advice and the frosting came out perfect!  I used it on the A-Number-1 Banana Cake (also on allrecipes.com) and it was a great combination.  I had extra and used the rest as a fruit dip.  It was great!  Thanks for sharing!

Unbelievable! This frosting is amazing. My family is big on Danish layer cake (yellow cake w/layers of raspberry preserves and vanilla pudding) and they freaked out over this frosting. It absolutely made the dessert . . . I think I even saw them licking the cake stand!!

Delicious recipe.  I used it on top of the "Mother's Applesauce Cake" recipe and it was fabulous.  Makes quite a bit, so next time I will probably cut back the recipe.  Thanks Tom!

this frosting was delicious!!!!! I made one mistake though, I did not let the cream cheese soften first. When mixing together I had little lumps of cream cheese. I used on a 2 layer white cake and my whole family loved it!! GREAT RECIPE!!!

Unbelievably good frosting.  This would make a brick taste fabulous.  Everyone who tried this said it was the best cake (served on banana cake) they've ever had.  The second time I made it my fiance begged me to let him lick the bowl.  You must try this!

This is sooo good you will want to eat it by the spoonfull. The kids hate coconut so we used this recipe to frost this years Easter Bunny Cake. I know we will be using it again and again. Very easy to make and well worth every calorie.

This is a simple, no fuss recipe, and is just heavenly. Very light with a subtle cream cheese flavouring. After reading some reviews that it could be little runny,and wanting it for a cake filling I cut the sugar amount by half.  I had so many comments about the cake and the way it tasted. I did white cake with thickened Rasberry Coulis and Whipped Cream Cheese Filling. YUMMY!!

I tried this one first before I found the other (Whipped Cream Frosting by Tom Parker - same guy??) which is the same as this and read reviews from both. I concur with most, this is the best frosting; I love cream cheese frosting  and I love freshly whipped cream and together it is oh! so mmm. Hits you right there, deliciously. Goes with everything and keeps well too, Though I love having sneaky spoonfuls of it dipped lightly in homemade caramel sauce, of course a cake could be frosted just that way too, and more. Did I say this is good? ;) Good one. Thanks, to both Toms and all.

This is light and not overly sweet.  I used non-fat cream cheese, and it turned out really good.
