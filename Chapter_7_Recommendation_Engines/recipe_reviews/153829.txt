I cut this recipe in half, as 1-1/2 ounces of liquor in a drink is plenty for me.  Vanilla vodka is good. Amaretto, too...very nice.  And Godiva white chocolate liqueur, which I used for this drink... wonderful. All of it thrown together with cranberry and pineapple juice is just... NOT good.  Too sweet, too strong, strange flavor.  Reminds me of my youth when everyone brought something to parties - it  didn't really matter what and it was never "the good stuff," dumped it into a big tub and had at it.  We weren't particularly picky then.

This was pretty good.  We thought the pineapple juice was just a bit overpowering, but it didn't stop us from having 2 each!  The second one was fantastic - we dropped a maraschino cherry into the glass with a tiny bit of the juice.  We'll be having these again, wedding or no wedding!

All in all, these were great.  At first I could not tell if there was to much pineapple for my taste but after the second round my neighbors and I decided they were perfect.

Woo-eee!

Holy cow, is this good! I don't know why I didn't make one of these sooner. I'm on my second and starting to feel a little happy. They are good, but will sneak up on you. Be careful!

Sweet as heck! Would be ok as a small shot drink, but I certainly don't want a glass of this stuff.

Very tasty drink! I'd try it again. Personally I'm not too fond of very sweet drinks but it was good.

I thought the flavor was good, but it left you wanting more....perhaps something with a kick?

I didn't have any creme de cacao on hand, so I used Godiva white chocolate liqueur. Absolutely awesome! The drink is very strong, so I might cut back on the vodka a bit next time.

Like another person said...I doubled everything but the vodka and it was killer!!!  Too many of these and it would hurt!!!

EDITED:  Have been trying to figure out what it reminded me of...a cherry flavored Tootie pop...when you get to the chocolate center and still have just a little bit of the cherry left....yumm
