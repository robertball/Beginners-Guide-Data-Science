Due to my sensitive innards I dispensed with the heat of the red pepper flakes but found even without it this was a 5-star recipe. I used less capers than the recipe directed so as to add a subtle, not overpowering flavor, which capers often can be. The butter and vermouth worked together to make a rich, brown pan sauce, the perfect finish to the meaty, sweet (use dry pack!) scallops.

I love scallops, but can’t say that I’ve ever loved any particular way they’ve been cook.  At least not enough to get excited about making them twice the same way.  Well, that's all changed!  I’ve fallen in love with this recipe, have made it several times, and have no desire to search for another scallop recipe.  The rich butter sauce compliments the scallop’s flavor and doesn’t try to  cover it up like many bread crumb coated recipes.   The best part is, it’s easy to make.  I'm not one to stock fancy flavored cooking oils, so I start with plain olive oil and saute it with a clove of minced garlic before adding the scallops. For a beautiful golden brown color, you really need to get the scallops good and dry by patting them with a paper towel. I leave out the red pepper flakes, but will sprinkle a few over the top of hubby’s since he enjoys a little spice. When you’re done, you will feel like a gourmet chef.

Excellent! I only used 8 scallops because my supermarket only had the large ones and I substituted vermouth for white wine. I made some fresh pasta to go with it and it was a huge hit.

WOW! I made these scallops for New Year's Eve dinner and they were a huge hit!  In fact, I'm making them again tonight and it's only a few days later from when I first made them.
Gosh, the capers really add a great saltiness to the sauce.  I went a little easy on the red pepper but everything else was just as the recipe calls for.
So glad I found this recipe!  I've already shared it with a few friends.

Great easy recipe. I took out the capers and added chopped onion to the sauce we had it over linguine. I will definately make it again.

Delicious.  The scallops were cooked just right following these directions.  I didn't use the pepper flakes because I don't like spicy food.  I tasted the scallops by themselves, then ate them over pasta with alfredo sauce.  They were delicious both ways!  Great flavor.

Such a quick and easy way to impress your friends and family!  I used fresh garlic and sweet vermouth.  These scallops were the highlight of the night!

This is a great keto dinner recipe.  The vermouth adds very few carbs (any?) since it is cooked off.  A very rich stand-alone entree; pasta would only take away from the exquisite flavor of the scallops.

I’ve made this at least 10 times and each time it’s incredibly delicious! Follow recipe exactly and turns out great every time. We love scallops and I’ve tried several other recipes but this is our favorite. Best and easiest way to cook scallops that I’ve found. Always serve it over angel hair pasta or polenta. Love it!

Delicious: I used Natrel lactose free butter(dairy intolerance)
and left out the red pepper flakes. 
Also used olive oil with and sautéed minced garlic, as another reviewer did. Will make again.

I make this recipe often, it is really top shelf.  I agree with other reviews to reduce the red pepper flakes as a little goes a long way in this recipe.  Quick, easy and full of flavor.

This is delightful.  And easy, which makes it even better.  I reduced the amount of capers by at least half due to personal preference, otherwise making the full amount of sauce for about half the amount of scallops and I’m glad I did, as the sauce is delicious.  Hubby appreciated it - “ a keeper”!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent recipe and so easy!  I only used half of the amount of capers but left everything else the same   It took a little longer for ours to brown up but it was not a problem and the scallops stayed tender.  Will definitely be a regular in our meal rotation.

3 and half stars.....4 with some personal taste adjustments. Watch those red pepper flakes. I used only a 1/2 teaspoon and it still was just a little too much,  but overall it does add something. Also don't add any salt. Those capers add just the right amount for my taste. I used only 1 tablespoon with a bit of the brine. The cooking times are  spot on. The scallops were still nice and tender. I served them over a flavorful roasted garlic & olive oil couscous and garnished the entire dish with a generous  serving of good crab meat!  A cool broccoli slaw rounded  out the meal nicely.

Made this as directed, including the pepper flakes and it had a nice little bite to it. This recipe goes well over angel hair pasta. I thought about adding a little gin for flavor, but didn't. I'll try that next time to make it a real "martini" supper.

I would have rated this 5 stars had it not been for the suggestion to use 1.5 tsp red pepper flakes. That seemed like way too much so I cut it in half and it was still too much. I will cut to 1/4 tsp next time. I cooked a lb of fresh green beans and mixed them in to coat them with sauce during the last 3 minutes of cooking, then served it all over spaghetti. Delicious, even though our lips and innards were burning!
