This recipe is Excellent!! My whole family loved it.I used chicken tenderloins and cooked them on my George Foreman grill. I did tone down the cayenne pepper and garlic powder, I thought it would be a bit too spicy for my 8 year old. She loved it and so did my very picky 14 year old Son! Thanks for a great recipe!!

I used half of the seasoning mix for 3 chicken breasts and it was the right amount. I broiled the breasts for a total of 25-30 minutes instead of grilling them. We used wheat hamburger rolls and they were delicious.

This is a great spin on chicken. Nice and spicy. For those weak of tongue in the heat dept, you may want to tone it down a little but this was great. Goes good with the Tailburner French Fries recipe on this site too lol. Nice combo for heat.

Very easy to make, and has a lot of flavor.  Works just as well on the George Foreman grill.

This was very good, and very spicy! I toasted the bread and melted the cheese using the broiler and grilled the chicken, cut fajita style on the george forman grill.  Will definetly make again!

Nice and Spicy!  I did rub the chicken with the spices but with the leftover spices I combined them with the mayo for extra spice!  I cooked the chicken and brushed it with the mayo mixture while cooking.  I also added a couple of pieces of bacon (because I had it on hand) and used cheddar cheese instead of mozzerella because I had it on hand.  Toasted the bread and viola, a nice spicy sandwich!

Good but way too spicy for us.  Next time I make, I will cut the spices in half.  I did not make into a sandwich (trying to eat healthier) and it was nice and juicy.  Made on my counter grill inside.  Thanks

Very tasty and easy to make.  Everyone in my family enjoyed these sandwiches.  I had enough rub left over for another time.

I love this seasoning. I make it all the time now and have used it on chicken, beef, tilapia and salmon. All great. I also pan fry the chicken in equal parts butter and extra virgin olive oil. It gives the taste a richness.

Very simple reciped, ez for those beginning or "challenged" in the kitchen.  I didn't make a sandwich out of it, cut some calories and just ate it with a knife and fork.  My wife and children loved it.  Great recipe.

I didn't find this recipe very special.  It's easy for this to get too dry.

Easy to make, tasty, spicy. Made with salad instead of a sandwich. Husband really enjoyed it.
