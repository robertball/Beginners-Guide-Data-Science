Threw all the ingredients in the slow cooker and let it cook on low for 6 hours. It was quite tasty. I used beef broth instead of water and I also left out the allspice. I may reduce the Worcestershire to 1/2 Tbs next time. My family did mention that this was the best stew they'd had.

I made the dish and here are my recommendations/changes:  Have your butcher de-fat a chuck roast and use 2lbs of Chuck,  never use bottom round or sirloin for beef stew....never.  I added the following :  one  14.5 oz. can of Hunt's Stewed Tomatoes (large chop) and 1/2 lb. container of fresh sliced mushrooms.  Instead of using 2 cups of water, I used one cup of chicken stock and one cup of water.  I also added more fresh garlic.  Finally, the recipe stated to add the cut potatoes and cook for the last 40 minutes.  There is not any cut potatoes on the planet that takes 40 minutes to cook.  Cook the stew for 15 minutes more and then add the potatoes for the last 25 mins.

I loved this stew! The only complaint I have is that next time I need to double the recipe because it was gone so quickly I had no leftovers for lunch the next day.  You also may want to use a little less paprika if you are making it for someone who is sensitive to spice.

Excellent! I just found my new beef stew recipe! I made as directed, with the exception of the ground clove - didn't have 'em, don't like 'em. I questioned the lack of water, but this turned out perfect, even after adding the potatoes. From a proud little Irishman, Thank You!!!!

I used  Monk Fruit sweetener rather than sugar.  I added fresh green beans and I used both red and yellow onion.  I used beef stock and water.  I also doubled the amount so that we could have some wonderful leftovers.  It was quite the hit with all.  Oh so Good.  This is very much a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly, although I wasn’t sure about the allspice and I really thought it was too much pepper, but I wanted to taste it the way it’s written. I was right about the pepper - my husband and I both agreed it was too much. Next time I’ll cut it in half. Didn’t care for the allspice because it kind of overtook the flavor of the meat. But it’s a very good beef stew recipe, and I’ll make it again without the allspice!

I like making stew and using others ideas. For this I added mushrooms, just like em in stew. I also used 1 cup of water and 1 cup of beer, I have found I like the flavor it adds as well, used a amber type ale.

I make a lot of stew during the winter and this is now my go to stew. It is just a great stew and see no reason to it. Only did a few things different and that is because I made a larger amount. I used a whole carton of beef broth (32 oz)  and I used tenderizer stew meat. I like green beans so threw some of those in the pot. I served it to my girlfriend and her mother and they both wanted the recipe. I did not have allspice so left that out. I was also very generous with the seasoning. I have never written a review on food, so that tells how much I loved it.  I attached a picture before adding in the rest of the beef broth.

Amazing! I loved it , my husband really liked it as well he said it tasted just like his grandmother used to make it (yayyy!!!!) He did mention that he could taste a spice he was not fond of ...he said: Nutmeg? ...or something similar to it? and I knew he was referring to the Allspice even though I only used a tiny amount  in the flour before coating the beef (he could still taste it!) ...next time definitely no Allspice but there will be a Next Time....Many next times. This was the best stew I have ever produced ...Thank you!

This was excellent! I made it without celery (I didn't have any & didn't feel like going out in the snow to get some) & added beef broth in addition to the water (i doubled the recipe). Was very good!! I will make it again, for sure.

Thank you for your years of effort put in, Big Papa....this is the best stew on the planet. I highly suggest not changing a thing when making this. It is as good as it is because of the combination of ingredients. Awsome!!!

This recipe comes as close to my Mom's beef stew that I have found. I doubled the recipe, omitted the allspice, sugar, and paprika, but otherwise left it alone. my husband is a vegetarian, so I made this all for me! If any is left, I will freeze it.

Well done Big Papa. This is one of the best beef stews I've tasted. Double the recipe if you want ANY leftovers. The pepper and paprika add a surprising kick which I like- but if you don't like it a little spicy then cut back on the the pepper and paprika. I also used broth instead of water, a splash or 2 of red wine and thickened with cornstarch and water as I like a really thick stew.

This recipe was not boring, very nice flavors in the stew. Everyone loved it even my 8 year old son!  Made my own Allspice because I didn't have any, 1/2 teaspoon each of ground cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg which really gave it a nice flavor.  I used beef broth instead of water, and may use a little more than 2 cups next time. I made sure to get the bottom round roast . Will be making again.

Very flavorful.  I floured and salted the beef before pan cooking.  It gives the broth a little more thickness.

Loved it. Replaced sugar with Splenda to cut carbs. Remember to cube beef against the grain for added tenderness.

I made this tonight and used a pinch of cinnamon and cloves as I did not have any allspice or nutmeg. I also used a package of frozen stir-fry vegetables instead of the veggies listed (I only had the frozen stuff). This was absolutely delicious. Without a doubt the best vegetable beef stew I have ever made!

This was my first time making beef stew and I am glad I found this recipe!  I did not change a thing and my husband and I absolutely loved it!
