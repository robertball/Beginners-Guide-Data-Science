You don't need the velveta. Mix an equal part of mayo with sharp cheddar. (One cup) instead. I also chop up some cooked shrimp and add it also.

These were pretty tasty.  I don't keep Velveeta in the house, so I doubled up on the cheddar - even at that I will try a good sharp cheddar next time. Thanks for the recipe, Mattsbelly.
