So easy and delicious.  My husband tried it and said we need to make this and share with all our mustard loving friends and family.

#allrecipesallstars   A new day, a new taste adventure. I wasnt sure about the surprise ingredient, but it works.
I did find it a little runny for my tastes, but I guess that is why it is suggested as a glaze.
I will definately try this again as is, as well as a base for  regular honey mustard

I haven't made this yet but I plan to this weekend. This has got to be the most interesting looking recipe I have ever seen. I can not wait to try it. I will definitely post my review when I DO make it.
