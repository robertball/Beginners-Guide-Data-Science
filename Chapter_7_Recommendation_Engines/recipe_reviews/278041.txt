If you are looking for a recipe to wow your guests, this is the one! I had never used this method for cooking pasta before and was amazed at how much flavor the pasta takes on by doing it this way. This is a meal you would pay big money for at a high end restaurant and yet it is simple enough to do in your own home. If I could give this 10 stars I would.
