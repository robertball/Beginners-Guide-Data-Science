This was pretty good, soft and juicy, although i made a few adjustments to the marinade. I added 1 tsp of cumin and about 3 tbsp of olive oil. I find that by adding a it of oil the marinade and flavors stick to the chicken better. I would make this recipe again it was quite easy.

Tasty, however it really didn't have the wonderful citrus flavor I was expecting - even with 24 hours of marinating. I loved the idea of this, using orange juice paired with lime. I even added a bit of orange and lime zest to heighten the citrus flavor. It's mildly sweet and does have some citrus flavor, but in the end the heat from the red pepper flakes prevailed....

Tasty and moist grilled chicken, but would have liked more of the citrus flavor.  Marinated for about three hours, but next time, I'll try putting the chicken in the marinade in the morning for an evening meal.

This recipe deserves five stars if you add minor adjustments to the dish ?? 
Marinating the skinless, boneless chicken breasts in 1 cup of Tropicana orange juice, 1 fresh squeezed lime, 1 Tablespoon of all natural honey, and Ciltranro, Adobe, Salt, and Peeper to taste in the fridge for 1 hour gives it a delious fragrant flavor. 

While the chicken marinated I put canned corn (drained) and drizzled in all natural honey, pepper, salt, and basil and cut up slices of yellow squash that was seasoned to taste by adding orangic extra virgin olive oil, honey, salt, pepper, Adobe, and garlic powder. 

Once an hour is up don't dicard the marinade, instead I chose to add it to a pan and cook it on the stove. Putting a lid over the marinaded chicken kept the flavors in and I added additional salt and pepper for extra flavor. I decided to add mini red and orange peppers into the mix to create another level of delicious flavors. You know it's done once the chicken has a nice carmalized finish to it and the juices are all absorbed into the chicken and mini bell peppers. 

Trust me your taste buds won't be disappointed!!!!

I used fresh squeezed orange juice and the juice of one lime as my lime wasn't very juicy.  Like other reviewers, I added the zest of half the orange and lime.  Unlike other reviewers, we did not find this sweet and in fact talked about adding a bit more honey the next time.  We found the citrus flavor really was highlighted, but I attribute that to the 10 hr marinate time and the fact that I did used freshly juiced fruit.  I think the juice combination would make a great sauce if thickened with a bit of corn starch and boiled for several minutes (or make a fresh juice combination and cook less). We will try that next time.

I thought this recipe sounded fresh and tasty,  but the ingredients added little if any taste. Perhaps if marinated overnight?  I may try that as I was a fan of the ingredient list.

I made this tonight for the first time and my boyfriend and I LOVED it. Out of all the chicken recipes I've taken off this site, this one had the best flavor. I used more honey, marinaded for about 4 hours, and I didn't use cilantro because... well I had none. But it still tasted great!

The chicken was moist and flavorful.  Next time we'll make a larger batch of marinade and substitute some marinade for part of the water required to make a batch of (brown) rice.  The meal was a 3 due to less intense flavor.  With more flavorful rice (than plain rice served with flavored chicken) we'll likely give the full meal a 4 or 5.

Just made this tonight and it turned out great!  My family loved it.  I used a juice blend I had in the fridge, an orange/mango/peach juice and the half of squeezed lime.  The only other thing I changed was the amount of pepper flakes; I used only a dash since my family doesn't like that much heat.  Overall, the chicken turned out very moist and it was flavorful.  I only marinated it about 1 hour in the fridge.

This is my recipe that I wrote and submitted to allrecipe a while back. In writing the recipe I forgot to add salt & pepper to the chicken before placing on the grill... I hope you all continue to enjoy the recipe.

I did not care for this recipe. Using both orange and lemon juice is a no go in my book, but I tried it anyway. Followed recipe to the letter.

I cooked this as directed. In my opinion, it was fine.  My boyfriend didn't like it at all. He just dumped hot sauce over it to mask the flavor.

Simple and good.  I would add the grated rind of an orange for more citrus flavor as noted in some previous reviews.  I did substitute  spring of fresh rosemary for the cilantro in the marinade

Love this recipe!!  I did make a few adjustments, but it turned out great!!  First I cut the chicken into chicken tender slices, to get more of the marinade flavor on the chicken.  This also cuts the grilling time down. Just be careful to not overcook it, so the chicken stays juicy.   I added some dry seasoning to the chicken before marinating it.  I sprinkled on both sides of the meat some mango chipotle seasoning I had on hand, garlic powder (or the roasted garlic & herb grinder is good, too), and fresh ground black pepper, and I let that sit while I made the marinade.  I made the marinade, as directed, but instead of using the cilantro as a garnish, I put it right in the marinade.  And I used more like 1 1/2-2 Tbs, instead of just 1 Tbs of cilantro.  Added it to the marinade by mistake the first time, but it is amazing with the cilantro in the marinade, so that is how I'll always make it now.  I think next time I'll add some olive oil to the marinade, as someone else mentioned, because the marinade is very thin, so I agree that that would help it hold onto the chicken better.  After I placed the chicken on the grill, I brushed the marinade on both sides of the chicken, as well.  This is one of mine & my daughter's favorites now!

I made this with some user suggestions. I added 1 tsp cumin, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 minced clove of garlic and increased the honey to 2 Tbsp. Will definitely make again. The marinate is good heated and used over rice.

Very easy to put together quickly and very refreshing on a hot evening. The citrus flavors were a great change from regular barbequed chicken.

We used Bone in skin on chicken breasts and cooked it on an outside charcoal grill, Do to a storm coming up we postponed cooking it until the next evening , So the chicken was marinated for 36 hours. WOW is all I can say, moist and flavorful and the skin was so good with a nice char on it. We will do it again !

I used a whole lime was not impressed with the flavor: it was not very strong at all. If I hadn't put cilantro on top I wonder if the chicken would have had any flavor at all.

Such a simple marinade with a great blend of flavor. I followed exactly as written for the ingredients But cooked in oven. I pounded the chicken and cut into smaller pieces,put into a greased pan, mixed the marinade and dumped on top of chicken pieces. Let sit for about 30-40 minutes then bake with the marinade at 375, turning chicken halfway through cooking.  The whole family loved the flavor.

Tasty, but a little sweet, even with the lime and pepper. I added lime zest and a couple more squeezes of lime, which just took the sweet edge off. Exceedingly moist and tender. I will make it again though.

This was great! As previous comments posted, I added some cumin, and a Pampered Chef jerk blend. I didn't use any honey, because I'm not into sweet. I used fresh squeezed orange and lime juice, marinated for about 2 hours in the fridge, and nearly doubled the cilantro (my herb garden is going crazy). I will definitely make this again.

We liked this very much. I didn't make changes to ingredients but did double the amount of red pepper flakes and lime. I marinated for about 4 hours and the flavor was very good and they were tender and juicy.

Couldn't get a mixed flavor either it was all orange juice you tasted, which my daughter said; my self The fresh cilantro and lime mixture over powered everything, ended up putting BBQ sauce over them, think I'm going to try with pineapple juice, to give it more of a Chinese flavor.

I followed the suggestion of other cooks and added both orange and lime zest along with some fresh pineapple and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.  The chicken was very moist.

GOOD, LIGHT FEELING ,EASY   This was very good.,I tasted the citrus but not the red pepper flakes. I marinated for an hour. I think that was fine. This was an easy,  light, clean , moist chicken. Make again.

Great, didn't change a thing except the timing, adding 1 tsp cumin, 3 Tbsp olive oil and I used thighs.  I'm always looking to save $$ and I buy chicken thighs when they are close to  sell buy date for 1/2 price.  I take them, prepare the marinade and let them sit for a day in the fridge before putting them in the freezer, then when the come out to thaw, that another day in the marinade.

The citrus and cilantro really brighten up the chicken. Very fresh tasting and perfect for the beautiful warm weather that we're getting in early May.

Took suggestions from previous reviews to increase honey (used 2 tbs), a touch of cumin, less red pepper, and including 3 tps of  olive oil. I used chicken thighs. Marinated 24 hrs. I put the salt and pepper on right before putting the chicken in the oven. I  poured all of the marinate in with the chicken.  Since using the oven instead of a grill, I  put on broil for the last 15 minutes. I ate with white rice and tricolored green beans. I  put some of the marinade on the rice. All of it was really good!!

The way I made this dish was somewhat different from the actual recipe, but I did use it as more of a guide than anything.  You always have to HAVE TO salt & pepper your chicken, no matter what.  I didn't have OJ, so I used more lime and added some honey & brown sugar.  Also, as other reviewers noted, I added some olive oil, and about 3 heads chopped garlic & let this marinate for less than an hour.  It was actually really good, but, sounded like it wasn't that flavorful based on other reviews.  I did like the bones of the recipe though, but I'm always customizing things.  Pretty yummy!

07-26-16 ~ This chicken was ok, but we were hoping for a stronger flavoring. The tenders marinated for about 8 hours, but the flavors didn't shine through. The tenders were very moist and we enjoyed them, just not exactly the taste we were looking for.

I'd give it another star but I don't grill so I didn't get the full impact of the recipe. Still very good. Made it in a pan. Forgot the honey, but everything else remained. Also added liquid smoke to give it that smokey grilled taste. 

Since I didn't grill it, I basically poached it from the inside with its own juices. Brown both sides of breast, cover for 10 minutes. DON'T PEEK! Turn off heat. Leave for 10 minutes. STILL NO PEEKING. Very juicy. :)

Used this marinade as is. Chicken was tender and moist, but had a bit of a kick, due to the pepper flakes.
