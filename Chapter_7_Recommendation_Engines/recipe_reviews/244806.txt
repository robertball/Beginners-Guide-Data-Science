This is quite good; a nice low-carb option. However. DO NOT ADD ANY SALT. The recipe calls for ONE TABLESPOON, which is 100% unnecessary. The cheese and bacon are salty, as well as the garlic and oregano and onion providing additional flavor. You don't need salt at all. I made it without any salt, and it was perfect. I cannot imagine how it would have tasted with the ridiculous amount of salt called for in the recipe.

This is my original recipe. Thanks for making it!  To assist one reveiwer: The cheese is pretty critical to getting the right amount of sauce. If you change the cheese but not the egg amount, the dish will come out very custard-like. Much cooking love, Aprildd

I made this over the course of two days...baked the spaghetti squash one night and then put the whole thing together the next. I only made two changes. One was to add a can of cream soup to the mix because I like my casseroles moist. My spaghetti squash was huge so I felt one can of condensed milk wouldn't be enough. I grabbed a can of cream of broccoli and that was a nice addition. I also added garlic because I add garlic to EVERYTHING that isn't dessert, lol! I probably put more cheese on top than was called for as well and actually added a little mozzarella that I had lying around. Excellent flavor! The bacon bits, though not much, really added a nice taste to everything. This is my favorite spaghetti squash recipe ever! Thanks so much!

Great recipe! Family loved it. Next time will try with cream instead of evaporated milk to make it really low carb and keto friendly.

This was unbelievably good! I scaled down to 4 servings, but still used the entire squash and 1/2 can fat free evaporated milk, and it was like like an au gratin casserole.  I also used low sodium real bacon bits (the jarred). I will make this often.

Wow, this is really good!  Unfortunately I was unable to find ripe spaghetti squash so I subbed whole wheat spaghetti for it.  I also used a rotisserie chicken.  I kept everything else the same.  This recipe was so good, I would never have thought it was diet-friendly.  I will make this again, hopefully with the spaghetti squash!

I did not use evaporated milk as I thought it would be to sweet.  I mixed 1/4 sour cream with a 1/4 cup water instead.  Did not have bacon bits and used pork instead of chicken.  Added red pepper flake.  It was delicious, even husband approved.  Had it for breakfast the next day so could be a breakfast casserole also.

Reading this recipe it sounded like my cup of tea as I love carbonara.  However, it is much more like a breakfast egg casserole.  I could not taste either the bacon or the squash.  I doubled the spices and added fresh garlic.  Still was rather bland.  I did, however enjoy it, it just wasn’t carbonara to me.

If you are not a fan of modified recipes, do not read. I picked up a squash from the farmers market, it was a combo of spaghetti and acorn.  It had consistency of both, definitely sweeter than expected. Instead of chicken I used both ground beef and Italian sausage.  I also used whole milk instead of evaporated. Omitted the bacon. It was yummy!  The whole family enjoyed.

I left out the salt, and a reviewer suggested, but I wish I had not.  Maybe not a whole tablespoon, but more salt would have made it tastier.  It was very easy to make, so I will definitely make it again--with salt.

I really hate when people review recipes that they made lots of changes to,  but I had to go with what I had on hand. I just think you could make this a variety of ways, it's  a great base recipe. I used some good ham that i chopped up, no chicken or bacon this time. I used a combo of cheeses, i didn't use condensed milk, i used  a little bit of whole milk, and some cream cheese.  Very tasty, and just as yummy the next day, too!

For a low carb dinner, this was really, really good. I did add a can of cream of chicken soup to make it more moist.  Next time I make it, I'll add more bacon and maybe some green chilies.

I made it according to the recipe (the only fair way to rate a recipe).  I found the flavor a bit bland , but none-the-less a reasonable substitute for our usual high-carb offering.  Next time I may add some peppers and perhaps some ricotta hoping for some moistness, as the carbonara seemed a bit dry the second day.  Please don not take this as a pan as I will definitely make it again.

Thank you for a very worthwhile and healthy dish.

We just started low carb for our health, and this recipe was wonderful!  We were very skeptical, but we didn't miss the carbs at all. Also, it was good when we used what we had on hand, substituting hamburger instead of chicken and also adding some mozzarella cheese on top.  Delicious!

This is an excellent recipe.  The only thing that I noticed is that it seemed watery when mixing it together.  This was not a problem however because once the dish cooked it was fine. NOT watery but nicely moist.  Will definitely make again.

We loved this recipe! My family likes things spicy so I made a few changes. I added 2TBS chopped pickled jalapeños and 2tsps Slap yo Mamma Cajun seasoning. Omitted the salt the recipe called for. I added a can of 98% fat free Broccoli cheese soup and used 11/2 lbs chopped rotisserie chicken. I had a very large spaghetti squash so decided to make this full recipe and divided into 4-8x8 aluminum pans. Baked about 50min. We ate one for dinner which served 4 people. We had extra sides of steamed veggies and a green salad. We froze the other three to eat later or to share. Will make this again!

This was really good but a little dry. I halved the recipe and made one with spaghetti and the other with spaghetti squash 
( my husband does not  like squash). I put the pastas in
their prospective dishes and mixed the rest of the ingredients in a bowl and divided it between the two dishes. Tasted wonderful and he loved it too, I think I need to add more milk next time. Thank you for a great recipe that's low carb.

Great alternative to the standard carby carbonara! My Hubbs,and I dislike the texture of spaghetti squash,so I subbed with 4 cups of zucchini zoodles, ( zucchini strands). I replaced the evaporated milk with cream  cheese and I added 1 teaspoon of chopped garlic,and half chedder cheese,half parmesan cheese. Delicious!

Delicious!! The only thing I changed was the squash and I left out the salt. I had zucchini and butternut squash noodles on hand so that’s what I used. I let them drain and pressed as much water out as I I could, between paper towels. I was crossing my fingers it would set with that type of squash and it was fine. Sorry about that photo, but no one could wait for me to take a picture. My husband ( not a veggie noodle fan) had two servings!

This was great, but I did my own thing for the seasoning: no salt, a couple of tsps of oregano, garlic, onion. I upped the bacon to 1/2 cup. Plenty of salt from the bacon and the cheese.

This was a great recipe to try! I followed some of the tips that other cooks left and I think they were good additions. I added the cream of broccoli soup and cut down on the salt. One thing I might add is to warm the squash in the microwave so you can cut it in half a little easier. Then before you bake it with all of the other ingredients, I would blot the squash with a paper towel so you can remove all of the excess water. Definitely worth a try!!! Loved it!

I reduced the salt by half, because of the comments, and it was great. I baked for 45min, but the center had a lot of water from the squash, so we ate the sides and then I returned it to the oven. Great recipe, nice flavor and the best part, we eat with no guilty at all.

Very good.  One challenge with spaghetti squash is the variation in size so I had two very small ones that I used.  Per other reviews I cut  the salt in half and also the garlic powder.  The texture was sort of like a quiche versus a casserole.

I really didn't know what to expect but am so glad I made it.  It is delicious and a good comfort did.  The next time I will cut the salt in half. But guaranteed I will be cooking this again.
