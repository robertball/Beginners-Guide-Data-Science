I absolutely love this recipe.  I am surprised more people haven't raved about it.  Last year was the first thanksgiving I cooked and this recipe was a peace maker.  I love yams with brown sugar and nuts and my husband is a marshmellow man.  This way, he can get all the gooey marshmellows of the top and the second layer lets me have them my way.  I made this several times after thanksgiving and this year I tried something different.  I mashed the yams with butter before layering (so we could cut the butter in half) and also used pecans for a more traditional taste. It was fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe!

Hi all!  This is my recipe.  I'm so pleased that others have enjoyed this recipe as much as we do!  When I want to start this recipe a day ahead, I just rinse off the whole sweet potatoes, put in a large pot, cover with water and boil the whole potatoes until just tender (not mushy!).  Let cool a couple of min and then peel away skin, slice and continue with recipe.  I've also made this with pecans instead of cashews and everyone always loves it.

This is the recipe I will use from now on..the flavor was excellent and just what I was looking for.  Since I was looking for a quick side, I sped things up.  I used a 40 oz can of cut yams (drained the juice).  I didn't have cashews, so I just left them out.  I cooked it in the microwave for approx. 6 minutes, added the marshmallows and cooked another 1 1/2 min.  The marshmallows didn't brown, but we didn't care...they tasted fabulous!  Next time (when I'm not in a hurry) I'll cook it exactly as written and I know they'd rate a 10 if possible!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this when my mom requested I bring a sweet potato dish to Thanksgiving, and it turned out to be my favorite thing on the table. I searched for hours until I decided on this recipe: I wanted one with recognizable pieces of sweet potato instead of a mash, some sweetness but not syrupy, and a marshmallow topping. I have never made sweet potatoes any other way than roasting plain with oil and salt but following this recipe gave me EXACTLY the dish I was looking for. I used pecans instead of cashews for preference, that was my only change. Everyone at dinner enjoyed them, I hoarded the few leftovers and those are delicious reheated too. Cara I really appreciate you sharing this recipe, this is now my ultimate sweet potato casserole and I was so proud to bring this to Thanksgiving, thanks so much!

Five stars without the marshmallow from the non marshamallow camp. Five stars from the Marshmallow camp. (I made two separate pans) That should be a ten! Really good recipe and not overly sweet w/o mm :) I usually use pecans but the cashews were a terrific addition. Will be making both again at Thanksgiving.Thanks so much for sharing.

OMG this is so good. I didn't use the salt or the nuts due to diet restrictions and allergies. And I mashed the potatoes . But it was so good it was the talk of Thanksgiving. 11/26/15
