Before sprinkling the ham w/ brown sugar, brush on some Dijon or grainy mustard on both sides, then continue on with the rest of the recipe...Adds a little extra "kick"

My family absolutely loved this meal.  My 5 year old son, who is the pickiest eater on earth, wanted to have this again the next day. I added a sprinkle of chopped walnuts to my husband's and my "packet".  This was one of the easiest and tastiest recipes I have ever found and not having to wash any pots or pans was a big plus.   I will definitely be making this recipe at least twice a month. :-)

I remember making this over the campfire as a Girl Scout so it was fun to try it out again. My recollection is of chunk pineapple rather than crushed, so that's what I used and I liked it fine that way. I am not sure I'd like it with crushed. The packets are good cooked in the oven, on the barbecue or on the coals of a campfire (when you're out in the woods with no refrigeration you can substitute Spam for the ham, too.) I will be interested to try this with fresh sweet potatoes rather than canned, I think I will like the firmer texture.

i made this unique recipe with a pre-packaged center cut ham steak (about 1 1/4 lb.) then trimmed & cut it into two portions. i also pre-baked 3 slender sweet potatoes & cut them into thick slices instead of using the canned variety. the end result was both tasty & pretty, especially with the broiled marshmellow topping. one note: my finicky boyfriend remarked he could barely taste the pineapple but i thought the flavor combination was fine. thanks gloria!

I used this recipe and just made the ham part - no sweet potatoes, no marshmallows and it was VERY good.  I did have to make a slight change though.  I baked the foil packs for 30 minutes but DO NOT open the foil packs and cook an additional 10 minutes - your ham will be overcooked and tough.

My picky kids loved this meal! I made it, wrapped it in foil, and froze it(all except the marshmallows, because those are added later). I wasn't sure it would freeze well--I defrosted it, cooked it, and everything tasted fine.

I used the prepackaged RAW ham steaks, and they did not dry out, they were perfect.

OMG!!! Why did I not think of this myself??  This was so good.  I left out the pineapple because I forgot to buy it but it was so delicious anyway!  I will try with the pineapple next time for sure although I am not sure it can get better!  It was so easy!  I used fresh sweet potatoes because they were on sale and I microwaved them for a few minutes so that I could get my knife through them and I just put a big slab of sweet potato on top of the ham and more brown sugar on top of that.  I am sure it would be just as good with the canned ones but they weren't on sale that day (lol) If anyone tries the fresh ones remember to increase cooking time.  Since its in the packet the ham was still tender and delicious even with the increased cooking time.  I hate to review a recipe and say well I did this and that but I don't think the changes I made mattered much. It will be even quicker and easier the next time when I use the canned sweet potatoes and remember to buy the pineapple.  I will definitely be making this again just as it is written.  Thank you so much for a great recipe!!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe - I added some dried mustard and a little ginger to the crushed pineapple before I added it to the ham and sweet potatoes.  Will be making this again.  Thanks!

This is easy and delicious. I gave it 4 stars only because it is a bit sweet and we would fix it only occasionally. We love ham. The only variation is that I coated both sides of the ham with spicy brown mustard. Next time I'll use fresh sweet potatoes to cut down on the sugar. Thanks.

I did this more like a casserole, and it turned out well.  I tossed cubed ham with brown sugar, layered crushed pineapple, sweet potatoes, brown sugar, more pineapple and covered with foil and baked, then added the marshmallows.  It made a little larger portion, and it was tasty.

This was so easy and delicious.  I used less brown sugar and omitted the marshmallows to cut down on the sweetness a bit.  I will be making this often.

This recipe is a keeper.  It was so easy to make and clean up was a breeze.  I didn't have much time to prepare dinner and fortunately this recipe doesn't take any time at all.  The family loved it and it tastes like you spent all day in the kitchen.

I've been making this for years except I've always used a combo of UNDRAINED fruit, 1 can each of  pineapple, pears and peaches (sometimes a jar of marischino cherries)  plus 1/4 tsp Pumpkin Pie spice.   Toss fruit (w/syrup) with brown sugar & Pumpkin Pie spice.  Place ham steaks, sweet potatoes & fruit mixture inside a casserole dish, cover and bake for 30 minutes.

I made this using leftover ham and canned sweet potatoes from easter which made this very quick and easy!! I liked it, I didn't add the marshmellows to it though.

I hate to be one of the only ones that didn't care for this recipe...but we just didn't like it that much.  Everyone ate it, but I think it needs some tweaking in my opinion to make it work for us. I made the recipe as it was written, and now I know it could use a bit of help.  I used a ham steak, canned sweet potatoes-drained, and crushed pineapple-drained, all of which created too much liquid (as well as the other recipe ingredients).  Possibly, the problem was the ham I used, so if I make this again it will be with either leftover ham or deli ham, not a ham steak.  The ham would need to be cooked first to release the liquid/juices, the pineapple would be sliced, not crushed and it would have to be a bit less sugar as well (too sweet).  I normally love the flavors of this dish, and I like the concept as well so I might give it another try with changes.

Well this was interesting and certainly very easy.  It was too sweet for me and I didn't care for the crushed pineapple.  My son, who is 4, absolutely loved it though!

Good stuff! I altered it a bit by using fresh sweet potatoes and baking it in a casserole dish instead of tinfoil. It tastes great and really hits the spot. Thanks!

5 minute prep AND no clean up?!! That alone is 5 stars! For 2 people, I put dijon mustard on both sides of one ham steak. Then I added pineapple chunks, brown sugar and a bit of ground cloves. I used a fresh sweet potato that I sliced and heated in the microwave for 6 minutes in a casserole dish. I then added marshmallows and broiled it in the oven 3 minutes. Great ham!

I am trying the weight watchers thing and this was too tempting as a filling meal at 10 pts per serving, and it was filling!  I will make again, but it was super sweet.  I think I will either omit or seriously cut the brown sugar next time.  The pineapple and sweet potatoes were enough sweet on their own.

Super easy! and good!  Used fresh sweet potatoes I microwaved and cut into thick slices (don't care for canned). Left sweet potatoes off of husband's as he doesn't like, and marshmallows off of 15 month old's as she doesn't need them, and every one loved their own little packets!

This is very tasty and easy!  I used fresh sweet potatoes so cooked them on my Foreman Grill first so they were tender.  I used the cooked ham that comes in the 1 pound can.  I also added deli mustard to the ham after reading other reviews.  All in all, this was very good.  I think next time I may put the ham on top instead of the bottom so the juices saturate the sweet potatoes better.  I will make this again...

This was so easy to make. I used 3 ham steaks instead of 2, and pineapple chunks instead of  crushed. We like our sweet potatoes a little sweeter so I just used a touch more of brown sugar. I didn't use the marshmallows, thought it would be too sweet. My husband had 2 huge plates, and he's not a big eater. He also said it smelled like Thanksgiving in the house. I definatly will make this again.

We actually weren't too crazy about this. I like ham and pineapple and I like ham and sweet potatoes but the combination of the three didn't work for us. If I make this again I will probably use fresh sweet potatoes, lots of brown sugar and cinnamon, and no pineapple.

This was tasty, and it gets extra points for the easy clean-up. This dish is best made on a night when youre not serving a big dessert since its very sweet!!!

I had such large ham steaks, that I used one for just the two of us.  Wonderful mix of flavors.  I would do this one again for a variation.

Really liked the way the flavors worked together in this and it was very easy to make.  The only problem I had was I didn't close the foil tight enough and it leaked on the cookie sheet and burned onto it.  So just be careful to close it all the way.  Also, I used big marshmallows since it was all I had, but they tended to slide off and then stick to the foil.  I think mini marshmallows as the recipe calls for are definitely a better choice.

I have tried lots of new recipes lately and this is the only one that my whole family actually ate and liked.  I cubed the ham before assembling the packets to make it easy for the kids.  They will definately be asking for this again.

My family just loved this dish and it's certainly very easy to prepare. I'll make this one again but I think I'll use fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned. They're just too mushy for my taste.

This was pretty good, but if I make it again, I will definitly leave off the marshmellows, for us they just made it too sweet when combined with the pineapple and sweet potatoes.

I really was not sure about the canned sweet potato being cooked on top of the ham, but it worked.  My husband loved it.  He does not like pineapple so I just put all the pineapple on my serving.

Jackpot!  A truly quick, easy, and delicious meal.  I am not very successful in experimenting with recipes, so I followed the recipe.  The only thing that I know I will adjust next time is the amount of servings prepared.  I have a house full of picky eaters so I ALWAYS have leftovers.  They fought over my lunch "packet" and have already asked me to make it again for dinner tomorrow.  I really like that it is prepared in individual packets because I don't have to alter the kids' meals to accomodate my caloric intake.  I hope it stays as yummy after alterations.  I loosely follow the low glycemic diet and 
count calories.  Next time I make it, I am going to try applesauce instead of pineapple and will use Splenda brown sugar instead.

This was super easy and a delicious combination!  The slight changes I made included the following: 1. 1/4 cup brown sugar sounded like a lot so I cut it down to probably no more than 2 Tbsp, which was still sweet enough. 2. I only had fresh sweet potatoes so I took the advice of another reviewer and just microwaved them for 5 minutes before scooping it on top.  3. I sprinkled a little cinnamon to top it off.  After baking for 25 minutes it was done.  My husband loved it too, and we'll definitely be making this again!

This recipe came together quickly all with ingredients I had on hand.  Unfortunately, the overall taste didn't seem enhanced by the combination, it really was like eating the separate items all together.  I won't be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe though!

Very good, but I discovered a variation I like better.  I use a can of apple pie filling or a package of Stoffers escalloped apples in place of the pineapple.  yum.

I was a little skeptical about this, then made it for me and my husband, and we both agreed it was delicious - he asked if he could have more marshmallows!  It was really good, and will be a new regular meal for us.

I never rate a recipe unless I have made it exactly to the directions given.  I get very annoyed when someone gives a poor review after they have altered the recipe.  With this recipe, I really wanted to love it --  but all I can say is that is was pretty good.  Some good points are it is quick and easy to put together and quick for clean up.  It is great for a fast meal after a long day of work. I think next time I might try pineapple chunks or manderin oranges.  I didn't care for the crushed pineapple.  My husband liked it so I will make again.

I rate this 3 stars for taste(it was kinda bland and boring) but 5 for ease, adaptability, and my 3 yr old loved helping me make these.  We all enjoyed it although i think the next time i will jazz it up with something more than just brown sugar.  I used a bit of mustard but i coudn't tell it was there and i wonder if i would miss it the next time.  Will make again.

This was fantastic.  We both loved it.  We used leftover Honeybaked Ham Slices so didn't use a lot of brown sugar.  Next time will probably use more when using regular ham steaks.  Did I mention it is so EASY too?

Simple & tasty- gets our vote! I liked the mustard idea and used microwaved yams. I didn't fuss with the foil packets.  Just put a quartered ham steak in a 13 x 9 dish with toppings and covered it with foil.

I love this because I never know what to do with ham steaks. I left out the marshmallow and did applesauce instead of Pinapple and added some milling spices and it was delicious! And no cleanup!

This was a quick and easy meal.  I would recommend it.  The only part was I don't know if I put too much pineapple or something but it was very watery (probably my error in reading recipe).  I don't like marshmellows so I didn't add them and it was still delicious!

This was surprisingly good. I basted the ham in some homemade honey mustard (yellow mustard, honey, onion powder, pepper), used regular baked (diced large) sweet potatoes and added a small cube of butter to the tops of the potatoes before adding the brown sugar.

Although a bit ordinary, this was good. You can't go wrong with a winning combination.

I was hesitant with making this b/c I thought it would be average. I finally cooked it the other night and loved it! It's easy, with little clean-up and suprisingly REALLY GOOD!!! It's even better the next day for leftovers, after the juices settle. YUMMY!!! Thanks!!

I didn't care for this recipe all that much. Next time I'll just cook everything seperately and do the extra dishes.

We had left over ham which I sliced thick like a ham steak and this was absolutely delicious and I am not a ham lover.  This was very quick to make up and I used fresh sweet potatoes partially cooked and OH SO LOVELY the topping of marshmallows.

It was too sweet for us. Presentation isn't great.  I'll stick cooking my sweet potatoes separately.  Won't be making this again.

I've been looking for a good pork recipe, and my family absolutely loved this one.  It's definitely going into my regular rotation.

Great recipe.  Although I was rate it a 4 out of 5, my husband only rated it as a 3.  The topping was sweet and the ham was moist.  Made as is except left off the marshmallows.  Next time will try it with the marshmallows and will add some dry mustard as previously suggested since my husband appreciates a little kick.

OK, like another poster, I did just the ham.  Had a 1 lb. Cook's ham steak, rubbed both sides with a tsp. of mustard and then sprinkled and rubbed in the brown sugar (just eyeballed it.)  After 30 minutes it was still a bit red around the bone so I baked longer.  Also, it was really watery and leaked all over the baking sheet. Taste was okay.  Perhaps I will try again but will either bake for 40 min, or at 375 for 30.
