I loved this!! It was SO creamy! It went over very well at my house and has become a main element in our family meals. Great way to get my kids to eat plenty of fruit too!!!

This recipe did not turn out as well as I had hoped. It was too liquidy. If I try it again I will be sure to decrease liquid and be sure to drain fruit cocktail really well. Thanks anyway!

Excellent recipe.   I had to double the recipe since it was for a potluck-type affair, and it turned out great.  It was one of the first salads to be completely eaten.  This is definitely a keeper and I'll make it again!  Thanks

Made recipe as is and it lacked a lot of flavor.  I added more sugar and vanilla, but still rather bland.  Will not make again, too many other great fruit salad recipes out there.

I didn't care for the canned fruit in this recipe. There was also too many cherries. This may be just a personal preference. I would make recipe again, substituting fresh fruit for the canned.

Easy to make, great and fluffy.  My husband doesn't like coconut so this worked great.  People liked it alot at the Superbowl party.  I did make two batches since it was so easy to make and yummy. Thanks.

I bought strawberries, blueberries, bananas, and black berries the other day and didn't want to just mix them together. So I followed this reciped and just used my fruit choices and it came out wonderfully!

Tried this recipe today and it turned out great. Really creamy and fruity, neither flavour overpowers the other. I'm going to serve it with vanilla ice-cream :). Will definitely make these for parties or whenever there's a lot of guests over!

This will be the second year that i have made this salad for my child's confirmation. It was a HUGE success last year, as I'm sure it will be this year again. It is so easy, and so good.

This is a very quick and easy recipe. Although me not being a fan of bananas and not having any canned fruit, I added 1 cored and sliced green apple, about and 1/2 cuip of halved grapes and one peeled sliced orange and a half a jar of cherries instead. I also chilled it for 10 to 15 minutes because the cream seems to be a bit warm after mixing it. other than that i found it sweet but not too sweet. It was very delicous!! i will definatly be making this again!:)

This was very creamy, but way too sweet for my family - we couldn't eat it as is. Would make it again though and have of the fruit juice and mile for the balance of the liquid. I did use it up by making an angel food cake and pouring it over the top of each serving as a sauce.
