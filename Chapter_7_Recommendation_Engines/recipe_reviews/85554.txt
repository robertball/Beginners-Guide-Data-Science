This is an EXCELLENT burger recipe and one of the most flavorful that I've had. I was a little hesitant thinking that it'd be too spicy and the blue cheese overpowering, but with the positive reviews, I had to try it and am glad I did. It had just enough zing for the taste buds and the perfect amount/blend of seasonings.

I was really looking forward to these, but was disappointed. I cut the jalapenos back to 4 peppers and it was still way too hot for our tastes.  

I think it might be better if you boiled or sauteed the jalapenos first.  That may mellow the heat and make them softer.  As is, the jalapeno "crunch" in the burgers just didn't taste right.

These fell apart on us...not sure why. Hubby couldn't get them to stick together after mixing in the soy sauce so he added some egg to bind them together. I think the egg "helped" them stick to the grill. I did use really lean meat..maybe that was the culprit although hubby swears it was thawing the meat in the microwave ( he says it makes the meat watery which inhibits it from holding together).  Flavorwise, these were all right...the jalapeno didn't add as much as I had anticipated though. For us, this was, at best, 3 stars but I am giving four since I know somehow it has to be hubby's fault.

This is by far the best darn burger yet!  We have always made the blue cheese burgers found on this site, but this recipe is far better!  Wouldn't change a thing and we'll continue to make these every week!

I made this for a dinner group, and since then a couple people have asked me for the recipe.  I thought it called for too many jalepenos, so I didn't use them all, but I wish I had.  The combination of bleu cheese and jalepenos is excellent.  The portions of this recipe are generous.

These are wonderful!!!  I used feta instead of blue cheese due to family choice.  I did add one egg and had no issues.  Yummy!!

Excellent burger!  I did not add the salt though.  The soy sauce I used has plenty of it already.  Also, it said to make 4 patties out of 2 lbs. of ground beef.  I'm more of a quarter pounder kinda girl, so this really yields 8 healthy size burgers.  I added some finely chopped cilantro and left the seeds of 2 out of 6 jalapenos in, just because I love spicy food.  If you're not a fan of Swiss Cheese like me, just add your favorite instead.  I used Cooper Sharp cheese.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

My wife and I loved these burgers.  As long as one ordinarily likes the flavours, they meld well together.  I used Danish Blue cheese and made no changes to the recipe.  These were good enough for company.

Fantastic!  I actually managed to get seven burgers out of the mix; I'm not sure how well they would hold together if they were much larger.  I left half a pepper seeded and actually wish I'd left the seeds in a whole pepper or two.  I think the review that said they were too spicy didn't bother to seed any of the peppers.  They're even better if you use a thin layer of blue cheese salad dressing for a condiment.

Personally I don't think there is enough bleu cheese but I am not sure if I want to use so much for such a faint taste.  Sprinkling some on top of the finished product would be best.

This recipe calls for way too much blue cheese!!!! The burgers were white because of all the cheese. Cut it down to one or.two ounces of cheese for 2 pounds

These are awesome.  I followed the receipe to the tee first and then second time used ground turkey.  Both are really good.  The peppers are warm because the cheeses help offset.  Throw some avocado on there as well and it's delicious.  Easy, quick, and so tasty.  A real crowd pleaser (and if you like it with more heat you can throw in more peppers or add some chili powder).  Thanks for the fab burger!!!!

So I made these for a "man's night" a few weeks ago.  I only tweaked a couple things-I hardly put any salt to taste and I didn't put on any swiss.  They were a hit!  I made double this and three of my buddies and I polished them off.  It was during Lent, and one of my friends actually waited long after everyone took off, until midnight, just so he wouldn't be eating meat on Friday.  
The only thing I would've done different is: no extra salt.  There will be plenty!  I will add the swiss next time, or add more bleu cheese.  I will also use fresh jalapenos.  It was a pinch decision to go with the pickled ones, though they turned out great.

This burger was absolutely delicious. One of the best I have had, especially with the bacon I put on it. I noticed some people saying it was too spicy. All you have to do is cut the membranes out of the peppers... problem solved...

Very good. No need for additioal salt the blue cheese is salty enough. Also I cut back on the onion and garlic powder. Will make again.

Absolutely delicious burgers!! I followed the recipe and added in some chopped mushrooms and onions along with the recommended egg...no prob with binding.  I cooked the burgers in a pan & used pepper jack cheese since I didn't have swiss cheese on hand ... they were aweseome!  Thanks for the recipe!

These burgers turned out well, however, I'm not sure what to do to keep them from sticking to the grill.  Ideas?  I used one less jalapeno than the recipe called for and it turned out to be just the right level of bite.  I also felt the swiss cheese was a little excessive and that the burgers didn't need it.

This recipe was good...We were wanting something a little different to put on the grill during the week...I only had 1 lb of hamburger so I halved the recipe and ended up with 4 burgers. Topped with grilled red pepper and lettuce..made french fries to go with...I think I may try a little steak seasoning (montreal) next time and a dash of olive oil...thx for a great recipe!

WOW! What a fantastic, bursting with flavor hamburger! I really want a second one but I'm stuffed!  I made 8 burgers and they are still plenty large enough! Amazing, I do not like Swiss nor Bleu Cheese, but I wouldn't change a thing!! I'll need to start trying more things with Swiss and Bleu cheeses!!!

Followed the recipe and it was absolutely delicious, the jalapeno/blue cheese combination was very flavorful and kept the spiciness at a level acceptable to most. Next time I'll try pepperjack on top.

these were fantastic.  i cut the recipe in half but followed directions to a T and they came out perfect.  I did not grill them outdoors but in a pan on the stove instead.  Next time i will leave the seeds in the jalepenos, as I woulda liked more heat.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  We used venison burger and so all the extra spices helped mask the "wild" flavor.  Because the venison is leaner we added an egg to hold the meat together. This is a repeat recipe...can even make ahead and freeze patties to throw on the grill later!

I loved this recipe. They would make great "cook-out burgers." I can't wait for summer to make these for friends. BUT(yes, there is a but) I would strongly recommend no salt. There  is already the soy sauce, which I think would provide enough salt itself. Adding extra salt makes it too salty.

delicious!  next time i will use 3/4 the amount of blue cheese as my husband and i both thought the burgers were a little too salty.  i scaled the recipe down to 2 servings, but realized you can make 4 regular sized burgers

Flavorful.  I made a day these in advance, so was very stressfree the day of my gathering.  Surprisingly they were pretty spicy.  I thought removing all the seeds would cool them down, but they were good, and had a kick to them.  Was afraid of all the blue cheese in them, but when I was eating one, I could not even tell that blue cheese was in them.

I thought this was good but there is no way that I need to eat a 1/2 lb burger.  I scaled it to 2 servings and made 4 burgers which were surprising large after adding the peppers and cheese.  I used pickled jalapenos which worked out fine.

I adored this recipe.  I do not like the taste of beef, so I customarily use buffalo.  With respect to the Jalapenos, I oven roasted half of them (which gives them a toasty heat-sweetness) and left the other half per the recipe. This added moisture to the burger while retaining the crunch within as a texture element.  I dislike swiss cheese, so I substituted more blue, which I also love and melted it on the bun, and I grilled the buns, which is a necessity with any burger.  One needs to learn how to modify recipes to enjoy the decadent ones to the fullest.

Woderful....very flavorful, and easy to make.  Not sure what the Swiss cheese is suppose to do, really can't even taste it, but I loved this one.  I only made half the receipe, and made 3 burgers.  Cooked 2 and can't wait to defrost the 3rd for an awsome lunch.

These were absolutely fantastic!!!  I did make them into 8 instead of 4 and they were still huge!  I cooked half and froze the other half.  Still great after freezing.  Next time I will try adding fresh mushrooms-can't wait!

Excellent!  Husband loved these!  I did reduce the amount of jalepeno peppers.  And only added half the blue cheese (what I had).  They were great!  Next time, I'll try the amount of cheese called for in recipe and reduce the garlic and onion powders by a tad.

This is the best burger I've had in a long time.  Like previous reviewers,  I was worried about the amount of jalapenos used in the recipe.  But after grilling, the jalapenos mellowed and blended well with the bleu cheese.  I took the advice of others and added one egg to help hold the meat together.  I made these into 6 large patties instead of the 4 the recipe called for.  We had leftovers for 2 nights and still couldn't get enough of it!

The taste of these burgers is really good!! I had the same problem as a lot of others, they didn't seem to hold together very well.  It seemed like once the cheese starting melting, that the hamburger fell apart around that.  I will try to add some egg to mine next time.  Other than that, they were good!

These were very good.  It was a great change from a plain old burger.  I don't know if I would use the swiss cheese next time though.  I think that it takes away from the flavor of the blue cheese a bit.

We LOVED these! I only had a little over 3/4 pound of ground beef, so I adjusted the ingredients accordingly. I got 3 nice burgers out of it. These had great flavor, and I didn't find them too spicy at all (I was using the end of the garden jalapenos, so they may not have been as hot). I really liked the blue cheese in this...we topped them w/ the swiss and served them on whole wheat sandwich thins along w/ onion, tomato and pickles...Nice! I will def make these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Talk about an AMAZING burger!! Made this for my family and they absolutely loved it.  The only thing different we did was we used dear meat and it was so flavorful.  I think If I make this again, which I probably will! I am gona add bacon bits to it and only put maybe 4 or 5 jalapeno in it.  Totally recommend this to everyone.  Already have been told they want it again. Guess its a winner!

WOWIE KAZOWIE!  These are without a doubt the best burger I have ever experienced!  They are so loaded with flavor no condiments are needed.  The blue cheese I used was purchased at Costco, their Kirkland brand.  I did not notice when I bought it, the label said "with Seasalt"...needless to say, the cheese was sooo salty, I knew I'd have to make some adjustments to this recipe.  I replaced the soy with Worcestershire and reduced the amount to half...did not add the extra salt and reduced the garlic powder at the suggestion of other reviewers.  I also did not add the swiss cheese on top...glad I didn't, it might have blocked the WONDERFUL flavors from coming thru.  I also liked that the blue cheese flavor is not "in your face"...just enough flavor to make these the most killer burgers ever.  I'm making more to stash into the freezer.  This is our "go to" burger from now on!

Awesome AWEsome AWESOME!!! This are by far one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. The mix of the jalopenao peppr and blue cheese make for a tangy spicy burger that is just to die for. I also made some with feta cheese instead of blue cheese and they were just as good.

My husband and I really enjoyed this burger. I cut back on the jalapenos at hubby's request and only used half the blue cheese as it is too strong for my tastes otherwise. We loved this burger though. Thanks!

Bland. I like for my burgers to burst with flavor. This burger had a lot going on, a lot of calories, and very, very little flavor. If you are looking for a little something different, this may be the ticket, but if you are looking for a burst of flavor, this one just doesn't deliver. Not a bad burger at all, just not what I was looking for. Thank you!

Fantastic! My family of men loved this recipe. It is packed with flavor, but not overly spicey. The jalapenos mellos during cooking and are not overwhelming. The bleu cheese kept the burgers moist.

I made these exactly as directed in the recipe.  Unbelievably flavorful!  Don't fear the jalapenos or the amount of garlic powder, but you could probably go a bit scant on the salt if desired.

I was really hoping these would taste a little bit better as my hubby and I love blue cheese and jalapenos. I found them to be a bit too salty and they didn't have much flavor. Not sure if we will make these again. Thanks for the recipe though!

I thought these would be so yummy. We love spicy, we love burgers, we love blue cheese. Unfortunately we couldn't taste ANY of that - since our burgers wound up tasting like burger-shaped piles of salt. I choked down 1/2 of one and had to drink almost 2 qts of Koolaid to quench my resulting thirst. Not making these again.

We had a lot of company and I made these burgers and everyone loved them.  I will lessen the amount of garlic and onion poweder some next time but they were delicious, easy, and great leftover.  I didn't add an egg and had no problem with the burgers falling apart.

This burger is delicious!! The only change I made was reduce the jalapenos to 4 and added an egg like others suggested. It's like a gourmet burger you'd get in a restaurant!! This will be a regular in our house. Thanks!

Although these burgers fell apart on me - the flavor was amazing and they were so juicy! I used a smoked swiss cheddar cheese instead of the regular swiss and added some extra jalapenos - wonderful!

These were some of the most juicy and flavorful burgers that we ever had.  Not spicy at all, and the blue cheese flavor mellowed a lot during grilling too.  These were great for my carb-avoidant husband since they taste great on there own without the bun.  Definitely a keeper.

If it's too spicy for you, try pickled jalapeños(the one you get in a jar) instead, they are a great substitute for fresh ones.  I also used Worcestershire instead of soy sauce and they turned out amazing!

Okay, not better.  I like the red meat & blue cheese combination, but the burgers - well, I think I'd like it on steak or some other better grade, not ground beef.  At first, I thought it would be too much blue cheese for the amount of ground beef; but it wasn't.  Evident, but subtle enough.  The jalapenos didn't cook, just warm.  'Not a fan of warm, raw veggies.  Suggestion is to cook & cool then add to the mixture.  :)  I wouldn't dissuade someone from trying these, but I doubt I'll be repeating.

Fabulous burgers.  I do agree with a few of the other reviewers that 6 jalapenos could be too much but it depends on your taste.  I use 2.  Only other change is omitting salt. Between the powders, the blue cheese and the soy sauce...no salt is necessary for our taste.  It's a keeper tho!

One of my favorite burger recipes.  Love the combination of jalapeno with blue cheese.  I make these with 1 pound of ground turkey, so I cut all the ingredients in half.  I've given this recipe to friends and they love it too!

Ok, but need more heat.  Added habanero to our mix.  Good, but flavor was still too low for our preferences.  Was surprisingly pleased with the flavor combo of the blue cheese in the patties and the Swiss on top.

This recipe is awesome, I reduced the jalapeno since my family couldn't handle spicy food, this is the second time I made them, and both times I got so much compliment how good it is.

Delicious, but I wish the blue cheese would have been more fine. Perhaps grate your own if you don't like big doses of blue cheese.

Excellent burgers. We made them on the George Foreman grill. If you like spicy foods, you might want to add some hotter peppers in with the jalapenos

AMAZING!!!!!  My whole family loved these burgers, which is a really great compliment as I have two very picky eaters!  The only thing I did differently was I reduced the amount of jalapenos to four because I made the kids burgers before I mixed the jalapenos in.  Will definitley make these again! Oh, I also added sauteed mushrooms to the top of the burgers before putting on the swiss cheese.

This was great.  I couldn't decide between this recipe and the cream cheese jalapeno burgers on this site, so I did this one, but added 1/3 cup of cream cheese.  I also kept all the jalapeno, and added 1/2 teaspoon of diced habanero.  I omitted the salt based on other reviewers and it didn't need it. And, instead of burgers, I mixed everything together and stuffed it into halved peppers and baked it.  Outstanding!

Raw Jalepenos ... no thanks! I roasted them first, then added to the meat mixture. We eat Buffalo mostly and the extra juice from the peppers and fat from the cheese made them moist and good. I upped the spices, including roasted garlic, added some salsa to the meat and made sure to spray the grill very well to avoid stickig. An ok recipe. I see similar patties offered for sale in our local grocery stores.

THe best blue cheese based burgers I've had.  The jalapenos complemented the blue cheese flavors nicely.  I minced the six jalapenos to avoid the crunchiness and that worked out beautifully.  Thanks for the recipe!

These burgers were fantastic!  Guests and husband would not stop raving about them.  I put the jalapenos in my food processor for a few minutes to get them chopped really well and fine so as to avoid major crunches when biting into the burger.  I substituted feta cheese instead of blue cheese and used ground london broil and they turned out great.  I also added some caramelized onions on top of the swiss.  Thanks so much, this one is definitely a keeper!  I can't wait to pass it on to my friends and family.

Out of necessity, I had too change this recipe a bit by substituting chipotle peppers in adobo sauce for the jalapeno peppers and ground turkey for the ground beef.  Will probably make this again when in the mood for burgers.

I have to say, these are HUGE! I cut it in half, but made four burgers, and they were still big. Followed other's advice about the salt, and left it out completely. Otherwise, exactly as written. Husband didn't care for as much, so the four rating--personally a five.

Great flavor! I bought a 6oz package of blue cheese and felt it was strong enough. The deseeded jalapenos didn't add much spice, so next time I will keep some seeds. I had no problem with mine falling apart, perhaps because I used less blue cheese.

These were delicious! I skipped the swiss cheese on top. I really wanted to show case all of that lucious blue cheese. The amount of jalepenos sounds like a lot. However, they really mellow during the cooking process. So, go for it!

I liked these burgers.  I love jalapenos so this was right down my alley.  I used half the blue cheese, and eyeballed the garlic and onion powder, did not use 2 Tbs though.  Used worchestershire instead of Tamari.  Overall good, not the best, but good.  Would make again.

If you use soy sauce, as I did,  omit or reduce salt. The combination of that and the blue cheese made it too salty in my opinion

My husband made this. My husband and I loved it! The flavor is uniquely delightful! They are not my-mouth-is-burning spicy like you might think using jalapeños. Think flavor explosion! Only four stars because although my husband and I loved it, my young kids, on the other hand, did not. They thought they were too spicy.

this is the best hamburger recipe I've ever tasted. it wasn't spicy to me tho. The jalapeños over powered the bleu cheese so I added bleu cheese on to the patty instead of the other cheese, and it was great.....will make again

This recipe was easy and fast to make and the outcome was delicious. I had chopped the jalapeños in bigger cubes to give it more color...but in the frying process some of them would loosen up. Very yummy hamburgers!!!

This was the best home burger we've ever had. They started to fall apart so I put some foil on the grill to finish cooking them. I used half the amount of blue cheese and it was fine and a jar of  soft jalapeño. A great burger

Since this was just for me and my husband, I used 3/4 lbs ground beef, 1.5 jalapenos (small because they were home grown) about a teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder, and 2 tsp of the tameri soy sauce, and 2.5 ounces blue cheese crumbles. This was VERY good!! I'd probably use just one jalapeno with all else the same next time not because it was hot but just because it was little crunchy bits. I was worried about the soy sauce being too overpowering, but it blended just enough to make the burger moist even at well done ( I prefer medium, but this worked!) I didn't use any other cheese, just a bun w/ mayo, but both my husband and I really enjoyed. the flavors work great together, I'll def. make again, thanks for sharing!

This was a very tasty burger.  The cheese combination was interesting.  The blue cheese was a bit overpowering, so next time will use less, it may have been my mistake.  Will make again, with a little tweaking, less blue, a little less jalepenos, so that it won't be too "hot" for guests that aren't that fond of spicy.  Maybe anaheims.

I loved these!! Very flavorful. I left out the extra salt and cut back (about half) on some of the other salty ingredients and it was perfect. I didn't put on any provolone or swiss, just to save on some calories/fat but it didn't need it. The blue cheese came through wonderfully. I will certainly make these again!

I subsituted ground turkey for the beef and they came out juicy and wonderful. I also made 6 burgers instead of 4 because they would have been way too big for us. I will make these again.

Very good.  I used roasted red peppers as a contrast, smoked gouda, and some homeade vinegar slaw for crunch.

Overall, a good base to play with.

I cut this recipe in half, and it serves the four of us, perfectly.  Each of us enjoyed a nice, fat burger.......but not a heart clogging 1/2 pounder.  My family loved these.  They weren't too spicy, but they had a nice flavor. Next time, I will reduce the salt. I forgot to add the Swiss cheese and the burger was still one of the best I've had in a long time.  OH!  I used a half and half mixture of buffalo and ground round.  I recommend the mixture for a combination of flavor and a healthier alternative to ground beef.

Sensational!  An absolute keeper!  

I did not find the jalapenos too hot (and I'm pretty sensitive to heat).

Loved the burgers!  After reading the other reviews I added two eggs, I didn't have any problem with them coming apart.  I do wish, however, that the pepper amount also included a cup measurment since there is a large variable in pepper size.
