This is SO SO good. Not over sweet, just the right amount of tart.

This was pretty good. Surprisingly the cointreau is the dominant flavor, with a sour after taste from the lemon juice. Next time I will try shaking it in a cocktail shaker and straining it into a chilled martini glass, like a lemon drop.
