Simple and delicious! I used crunchy peanut butter and mini chocolate chips. Also, I used my small cookie scoop and got 26 cookies out of this. Baking for 8 mins. was perfect for my oven. The kids (and adults) are LOVING them...definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

So simple to follow, my kids did it all on their own. 

I halved the amount of white sugar, since I used the no-stir crunchy peanut butter. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly, but increased the baking time to about 10-20 minutes depending on the cookie thickness and size. 

After it comes out of the oven, leave it to cool for one minute. If you can shift it around the baking sheet without it crumbling, it's good to go. Otherwise, I popped it back into the oven. Once it can be moved, I let it cool on a wire rack. 

Cookies spread out a little, so the 2" gauge was pretty good. Texture is crunchy on the outside, a little soft on the inside (perhaps shortening the baking time might make it more chewy). 

So yummy and easy to make!

This was my first attempt at a flour-free baking recipe. I made these exactly as directed, but the cookies didn't come out very well at all. I moved one from the baking sheet to a cooling rack, it crumpled, fell through the wires and onto the counter. Think I'll stick to a more traditional recipe next time.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies were crumbly. I returned them to the oven for another 10min and let them cool completely before taking them off a parchment lined cookie sheet. They came out great. I will definitely make them again, especially for my gluten free friends.

Made with crunchy peanut butter (3/4 was Adams, and 1/4 Kraft). Delish!    I've heard that using natural peanut butter can sometimes make recipes a bit drier, so next time I will use Kraft.

The only change I made was to cut the white sugar back to 1/3 cup.  It is important not to try to move the cookies until they are completely cooled.  I baked them on parchment paper sliding the paper from the pan to a cooling rack of even height.  They didn't crumble at all.  I did add Nestle espresso morsels.  You get a little taste of coffee with your peanut butter cookie.  These cookies were made for an adults-only party.  Otherwise I would have just used chocolate chips.  I have a nephew with celiac desease so I wanted to have a gluten free recipe available and this is the one I will use.  They came out picture perfect.

Big hit at family Christmas get together! I exchanged coconut sugar for the white sugar and they  were still sweet enough. I used a fork to crisscross on them, flattening them.

Followed recipe exactly. Baked for ten minutes. Used mini cookie scoop which doubled the amount of cookies. They baked up beautifully! Crispy on outside and soft on the inside. Really pleased with this recipe.

Great cookie! I used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. I also used chunky peanut butter and left out the chocolate chips (only because I didnâ€™t have any).
These were yummy and chewy. Let cool before removing from the pan or they will likely crumble.

Easy to make and very good! I made these with a friend of mine who is gluten-free, and I think she'll like them. I did cut back on the white sugar by 1/2. I used crunchy pb and added just over 1/4 cup mini choc chips. I used a 1" scoop, and you should allow a few inches between. Mine spread out to about 3 1/2 - 3 3/4" and came out very flat. I let them stay in the oven close to 10 min (after some of the comments), but I think 8 min would have been fine. Also, you shouldn't try to remove them too soon from the sheets. I let them rest about 5 min before removing, and there was no crumbling problem. Thanks....great recipe!

Came out ok. Think I'll try again with different peanut butter. Fresh ground , natural may not be the way to go with these
