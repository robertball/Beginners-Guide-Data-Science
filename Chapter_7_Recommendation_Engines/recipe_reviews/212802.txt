This was delicious!  I did not have honey-mustard dressing on hand, so made my own by mixing about 1/3 cup mayonnaise, couple of tbsp of honey, couple of tbsp of stoneground mustard and a tbsp of lemon juice ... followed the rest of the recipe as written, although only baked for 40 minutes - came out golden brown & juicy - thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe. I don't use exactly dijon mustard. I just use whatever mustard is available and it is awesome! And easy!

I made my own honey mustard dressing and my own seasoned bread crumbs (homemade garlic-butter croutons ground down into crumbs, then I added a heaping teaspoon of homemade italian seasoning). This recipe really is as good as your ingredients, honestly. My husband and two kids inhaled every piece of this chicken dish and wondered why there wasn't more. I'll make this again.

I made this for a dinner party of 16 adults plus kids.  It was a big hit.  I used another recipe from this site for the Honey Mustard called Honey Mustard Salad Dressing.  I liked that I could dredge ahead of time and keep refrigerated until it was time to bake.  Since it was refrigereated prior to baking I did add a couple (maybe 5mins) to the baking time.  Even the little ones who are picky eaters ate this up.  All the parents wanted the recipe  : )

This received raves last night!  I was only cooking for 3, so used about 1/3 c of the dressing, but added a tsp of dijon to that for just a touch more zip.  Didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, so added a tsp of curry powder to the bread and cheese mixture, and grated some black pepper over the breasts before popping them into the oven.  You don't really taste the curry, but it does add a little something. This will be part of the dinner rotation - so easy to make, and tastes so good! (Spray the pan with a Pam-like product to help with clean-up.)

This was good, quick, and easy.  I mixed 1/4 c of honey dijon dressing and 1/4 c of mayo and coated thin cut chicken breasts in that and then into bread crumbs.  I wanted it to be served quickly so I cooked them on the stove instead of in the oven.  Took about 15 min total.

This is definitely edible and this is saying a lot for someone who doesn't like chicken (me)... I marinated a boneless, pounded chicken breast all day (after poking it with a fork)... baked it for about 20 mins.  Served with jasmin rice; sautee'd onions and peas. For dessert, I sauteed apples with cinnamon sugar, topped with ice cream and hot fudge sauce.

One heads up about this.. I used two whole chicken breasts each cut in half and I ended up having to mix together more breadcrumbs and parm to make sure I had enough to coat all of it. I also used Panko bread crumbs and Marketside honey-dijon (my walmart doesn't carry the marzetti honey dijon) and it came out so flavorful! I served the chicken with sides of seasoned rice and corn. My boyfriend (the picky eater) has already decided he wants this again, I made it last week and he wants it again tonight!

This was awesome, I made some changes since I didn't have some ingredients at that moment.  I had Dijon mustard, I added sugar and a little bit of milk. I replaced the bread crumbs with soda crackers. I also put some salt on the chicken. It was not dry. My son doesn't like chicken but he ate it all. This is a KEEPER!. Thank you for posting it.

A little plain. Needs a side sauce. But simple.

Don't need but half the bread crumb mixture. I made 4 big thighs & 7 good size drumsticks. Also, my son favors BBQ sauce so I dipped a few pieces in that instead. Both delicious!

We love honey dijon so this dish was a nice weeknight meal.  It was just average though-- nothing Earth-shattering.

This was Great! I made some Roasted Red Potatoes with the dish and it all came out great. Couldn't find the Marzetti brand but I used the Ken's brand of dressing and I forgot to put the Parmesan Cheese in. It still came out great! My wife and my two year old son loved it!

I did not like this recipe at all.  It did NOT come out the way I expected (according to all the rave reviews).  I was disappointed because I've had dijon chicken before but this was soggy and overpowered by mustard.  My kids LOVE chicken but they wouldn't eat this.

I was trying to find a new chicken recipe and decided on this one.  I was pleasantly surprised by how tender the chicken was and how good it tasted.  Will definitely cook this again

Unfortunately, I couldn't find the Marzetti Honey Dijon Mustard, so I used whatever I found in the stores... I personally didn't care for it. I felt that it needed to be a little spicier (next time I will add more pure dijon mustard). I will customize it to my taste more.   My husband loved it though, and he'd like me to make it again. I personally thought it was just OK.

Made it tonight and the family loved it. So easy and tasty. Ran out of parmesan cheese and added a Mexican/quesadilla cheese. Still delicious.
