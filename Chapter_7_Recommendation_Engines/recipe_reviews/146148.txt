Not bad with these alterations: 1/4 c. lime juice, 1/4 c. water & 4-5 ice cubes. I added some mint leaves as well. Make this in a blender only or it will be like mulch. Splenda substituted for the sugar makes the recipe much healthier. I can only see making this if trying to use up cucumbers or serve a novelty drink. My husband said a shot of tequila would improve it greatly :-)

Good base recipe. I didn't have a lime, so I juiced one large lemon, instead. I also cut the sugar back to about 2 tbsp. and added some ginger for a kick. Yum!

Feeling adventurous?!  Try using this recipe for a refreshing Cucumber Martini and using chili seasoning made for fruit (check your produce section) on the rim!  YUM!!!

My friend made this for me yesterday.  I fell in love.  Today I made it myself, using zucchini instead of cucumber, because that is what my garden is overproducing.  It is wonderful that way too.  I used raw sugar and honey in place of the sugar, and added some ice cubes in place of some of the water.  Also, it worked better for me to start with the water, mix in the sugar and lime, and then gradually add a chunk of zucchini at a time, blending as I went.  Then after the zucchini was all blended, I added in the ice cubes.  I'll be making this often.  I peeled it today, but next time I might try with the peelings on.

Great recipe, the sugar is unnecessary though, especially white sugar makes it ultimately a non healthy juice

It was different, but very refreshing.  Ice is a must, and mint is a nice addition too.  I added a bit more sugar, but I have a sweet tooth!  I recommend seeding the cucumber if you have time.

The quantities can really be changed to your liking.  I only used one lime, and I added ice, not water.  It was delicious!  And it got rid of two cucumbers, too.  We added a little vodka to one serving (no rum on hand) and it was very tasty.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very good, refreshing. My one complaint is it didn't say how much cucumber, since cucmbers come in all sizes "2 cucmbers" isn't much help. I uaed cucumbers which when blended equaled about 1.5 cups of liquid per cucumber. I also seeded the cucumbers.

Like the author, I'm also currently in the midst of an explosion of cucumbers in my garden. What a great recipe! Delicious! I recommend adding the sugar to taste. I used only 2 tablespoons to balance the acidity of the lime juice.

My girlfriend loved it! I wasn't too sure about it, but indefinitely enjoyed it more after I added a shot of vodka. All in all, pretty good!

Made it using honey instead of sugar, and found it too "pulpy," so added about 2/3 cup vanilla Greek yogurt. That helped. Will make again but will cut back on the lime juice. Good way to use the cukes! Refreshing. Thanks!

this recipe was refreshing & delicious!  It used up lots of extra cukes!  Definitely add ice!  We tried it with lemon but did not like it that way as much as with the lime.  We also used zucchini one time by mistake and it was very good, but with a creamier texture, more like a smoothie than "juice".  A keeper for sure!  For measurement and the problem of how much cucumber we used the lime and sugar amounts and then filled up a Vitamixer with cucumbers and substituted ice for the water and only used water to get the mixer started.

If you like cucumber and lemon then you'll love this. I was surprised at how good it turned out. I made a smaller batch and cut the recipe in half. I also used splenda instead of regular sugar and added ice. But other than that, the recipe is pretty much the same. Someone mentioned it being mush. I peeled it and put it in my nutribullet and it came out nice and smooth, not chunky at all or mushy. Maybe they need a stronger blender? or add more water. Very Refreshing!

I have to admit that I modified the recipe a bit, but this was the inspiration for one of the best smoothies I've tasted!  I eyeballed the measurements as it was going in to my Vitamix: 3/4 cup homemade almond milk (I make it really rich!!), 1 cucumber, juice of 2 limes, 1/3 c. Splenda (I know, it's poison...would have used Stevia extract, but I was afraid the taste would interfere and couldn't stand using that much sugar in a smoothie).  A handful of ice, a spin in the blender, and you've got yourself a healthy, creamy quencher for a key lime pie craving!

My daughter made some and she loved it. She used lemon instead and sugest less sugar for a more bitter taste.
