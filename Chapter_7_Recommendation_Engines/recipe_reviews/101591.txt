Everyone agreed this was a four-star meal, which is a really high rating for my family. The sauce had a nice flavor.  I sprinkled some bread crumbs on top of the chicken with about 10 minutes left.  I only made three chicken breasts so I had a lot of sauce left over which might have worked well with some noodles. I'll have to try this next time.

Excellent meal! The chicken cooked very quickly because it had been pounded thin. I added some sliced mushrooms to the butter inside the roll. The sherry adds a nice mellow touch.

This was good, not spectacular. Hubby thought it was very good. I did use low fat soup and lite sour cream, and only 3 chicken breasts (so only 3 Tbsp butter and not the whole pkg of dressing mix.) Served with rice, we like lots of sauce but of course still have some left over.

This chicken was good, but I am not sure I would make it again.

This one was...bizarre to me.  My taste buds were very confused and I think I liked this.  My husband mentioned it seemed like a sauce that would be good a nice lump crab cake or a nice white fish.  I think we'll eat this again but try it on one of those instead of the chicken.  I think you really need a protein that has a very distinct, noticeable flavor as opposed to one that tastes like whatever it is cooked in.

This is a dish fit for company. I put fresh spinach leaves inside the chicken breasts before rolling them up. I also cut the sherry down by half just because I was afraid it would be too strong for my personal taste. I served it over egg noodles. Delicious! (The butter puddles on top, but if you stir up the sauce, it's all good. The butter could probably be omitted.)
