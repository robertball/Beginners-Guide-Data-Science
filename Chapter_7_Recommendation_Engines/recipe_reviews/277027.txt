Loved the ease. Love coffee but didn't like the taste of it in this? Smell was great - taste too bitter for me. Probably just preference. Will try again without the coffee and I'm sure it will be great.

My friends and I love these!!  They are easy to make and relatively healthy!  Can substitute the sugar for stevia and never know the  diff except the calories!  Very, very good dessert!  I even have a party request to whip these up for!!:)
