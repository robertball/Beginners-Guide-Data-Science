This came out really good, but I didn't have tamarind paste.  What I had was this chuck of tamarind goo from the asian store.  I cut off about a 3/4 cup chuck of it and soaked it in 3/4 cup of water.  Then I had to strain all the seeds and fiber from it...squeezing the pulp into a bowl.  Then I went on to the next steps.  I used one tablespoon of brown sugar blend, about 1/4 cup raisins (as I didn't have dates) and the cumin SEEDS.  Well, after running it through the food processor, the cumin seeds were mostly all intact, which I didn't want.  So I strained it again....came out perfect.  I think next time I would just use ground cumin...like maybe 1/4 to 1/2 tsp depending on how much you like that flavor.  Thanks Rani

This was very easy and tasted just like my favorite Indian restaurants.  I did add a bit of salt and would use just a tad less water next time.  I also used my tamarind paste since I didn't have extract. I made it with dates from Indio California.  Very tasty.  Great with tandori chicken and naan.

I was expecting to add corn starch but found that leaving it on medium low for half an hour stirring occasionally it was perfect.  I found it slightly mild (heat wise) for my taste, so I added 1/4 cup liquid from a jar of hot banana peppers.  Also, after it was cooked but need to reduce longer I strained it to get rid of any lumps of tamarind skin, coriander seeds, cloves, cinnamon bark etc..  It has been a big hit with everyone.
