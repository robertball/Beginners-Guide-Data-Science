I found this recipe to be too bland for my tastes, but it tasted much better after adding fresh chopped tomatoes and a bit of fresh squeezed lemon.

I made this last night when I needed a complement to my Italian breaded chicken.  It was great!! Like many others, I made some alterations to the recipe and I encourage people to do so as the original seems boring.  I sauteed some onions, several cloves of garlic (minced), and a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a pan while the pasta was cooking.  I also added in some broccoli and sauteed that for a bit, just until it started to get a bit of brown on the edges from the garlic and oil.  I added this mixture to the cooked (and drained) penne pasta and stirred.  Lastly, I added some garlic salt and lots of shredded parmesean cheese (probably 1/2 cup or so)!  This was important for flavoring.  It was fabulous!!  I ate it with "Angela's Easy Breaded Chicken" which I also got from AllRecipes; eat with a slice of lemon on the side (I love lemons).  For a new cook like me, this recipe was simple and enjoyable.  Thanks so much!

I have made a variation of this recipe for years as a last-minute dinner.  I use vermacelli and I would adjust the amount of garlic depending on who was going to eat it (I LOVE garlic). I also add the juice of 1/2 a lemon and toss in 2 cups of steamed chopped broccoli.  I never use measurements for this recipe and it has always been one of my and my son's favorite!

great and easy side dish- i would double the garlic and definitely add the crushed red pepper- as others have suggested. (i use angel hair pasta) great with grilled chicken and a side of tomatoes drizzled with olive oil and basil.

This was very good and very easy!  My husband even said it was a keeper, and he usually hates anything new or different.  I will definately keep this one, but I think I will use it more often as a side dish (for steak or chicken) than a main dish.  (although it makes quite a bit, so I'd probably cut the recipe in 1/2 for a side dish)

I thoroughly enjoyed this pasta.  From the easy preparation to the tastiness of the oil and cheese, it was heaven to my mouth!  A great dish the whole family can enjoy.  I used to love red sauces...now I am hooked on this recipe!  Thanks a lot!

I used a specialty pasta and the recipe didn't suffer for it. Not a Parmesan lover so I didn't include it on my plate but did on the wife's.  I added a little butter in addition to the olive oil.  I eat this regularly, so am very familiar with it and love it, but this is the first time I made it, not my wife, Naples34102.  Went great with "Italian Cheese Stuffed Pork Chops."

This was really great!  Family loved it!  I added some browned Bob Evans Italian Sausage and a 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper to the sauted garlic then mixed in some steamed broccoli and the parm cheese.  Family said this recipe was a KEEPER!

I really liked this recipe but I did need to alter it as many others have said. After I tasted it with the recommended amount of garlic I found it to be to bland so I added a half teaspoon more garlic powder and some fresh ground pepper. I also put in about a cup and a half of fresh steamed broccoli and chopped chicken breast to make it a full meal.

Add any veggies you like. This is much healthier than what I use to do when using butter. This is easy and a nice comfort food.

Simple and delicious!  The suggestion to add fresh-squeezed lemon was exactly the touch this needed, and a tiny bit of salt.  Served this alongside stuffed filet of sole.  PERFECT!

This is a side dish not a main and like others, I decided to modify it to my tastes and add some things that I had on hand: Asparagus, more garlic, salt and pepper, and a little italian seasoning. I will make this over and over again because I often need a side dish to accompany a protein and this one's a winner as it can accomodate other ingredients that you have available such as bell peppers, yellow or green squash, broccoli, plum tomatoes, carrots.  This will replace the overly-salted and procesed Lipton/Knorr pasta sides that I have been buying for years.

Simple to make. I thought it had a very simple taste.. possibly to simple for me, but then again I think I made to much pasta...hmm  It was good with a simple chicken breast cooked with salt, pepper and lemon juice.

I liked this recipe a lot, but more as a side than a main dish. It is pretty bland alone, but I serve it with blackened chicken for added flavor and call it Black and White Pasta.

Tried this tonight...delicious! My husband and son loved this recipe as well! Served it with a side of thick slices of tomato, roasted for about 10 minutes. Then topped each slice with a heaping spoonful of pesto sauce and topped with mozarella cheese and baked another 10 minutes.

Very nice.  Felt like it could use just a little something but just couldn't put my finger on it.  Definitely something I'd like to play around with.

This recipe alone was fairly bland, as stated by the other reviewers. However, upon adding more parmesan and more garlic, it was comparable to restaurant-quality pasta. Not too bad of a recipe, just play around with the ingredients a bit to suit your own tastes.

I liked this a lot. First time I made as directed and second time I used angel hair past and squeezed a lemon over and added 1/4 tsp dried chiles.  Even better the next day for lunch.

I make this all the time for my family.  It's my youngest's favorite dinner.  Don't forget plenty of fresh ground black pepper, and any kind of pasta will do.  We usually use spaghetti.  Add a tossed salad, and you're set!!

Okay, I cheated.  I kind of merged this recipe with the Chicken Parmesan Pasta recipe, and added a few things of my own.  It was good!  I used penne pasta, browned my chicken with garlic, seasoned with salt & pepper, and mixed everything together with lots of real, grated parmesan (not the one in the green can), some parsley, milk, and thickened it with a little milk mixed with flour.  You can even get away with skim milk on this!  We'll make this again.  You can do many variations on this.

I eat this as a side dish or as a main dish.  It's like comfort food for me. I always use olive oil. Like others I added more garlic and red pepper flakes.  I've had it with feta cheese and cilantro and it was great.  Also had it with parmesan and basil and still great.  A wonderful recipe to change/add to according to your taste.

Pretty tasty and 'clean'.. I did make some changes.. I added twice the garlic, about 1/4c of diced onion sauteed in the olive oil, a dash of 'grind'n grill' seasoning and more cheese.  I served topped with sauteed beef tips.  Very good.

Love this basic pasta and have been eating it this way for along time. If it's flavorless then I'd change my olive oil brand and make sure my garlic was fresh or just add something else that will make you happy - slice green onion, broccoli ,as suggested, or red pepper flakes. All good stuff.

This is the best!  A few minutes before the pasta is done, I add small pieces of chopped broccoli and slivered carrots.  This is a very good & filling meal.

Good dish, but not very exciting. I tried first as a side dish to a very spicy chicken, and it went perfectly with it. However I tried it again on it's own for lunch one day and was disappointed. Quite boring on it's own. Will make it again though when I need a side dish that will compliment and not overtake a very flavourful main dish.

I too am a teenager, with a rather imbalanced budget. This has become the ultimate staple for me, even sometimes when I don't have any cheese, i load it up with spices instead! Not crazy bout a lot of flavour, I like it plain and simple...and that is what this dish is. #1 comfort food.

A nice pasta but a little plain. 
I made only a few changes to the original recipe:
1.I added more garlic (just because I love the stuff.)
2.Instead of mixing the Parmesan in with the pasta I left it on the table for sprinkling.
3. I tossed some dried parsley over the top of the pasta once it was finished.

A quick and easy side dish.

This is so simple and easy. My mom and I recently made this and it was just awesome! In the future, we'll probably cut the recipe in half, as our only complaint is too much pasta for just two people.

Pretty good, but I'd add some broccoli or even peppers to give it a little more flavor. This is quick and easy and satisfying in a healthy way. I make it with whole wheat pasta and broccoli to make it even healthier. Great weekday dinner.

This is really good! I made it with bow tie pasta and I didn't have fresh parmesean and didn't want to use the canned kind...so I used fresh Pecorino Romano (and a lot of it)and it was great. Also sprinkled on some dry minced garlic and roasted garlic flakes. Very good.

I've recently been diagnosed with congestive heart failure so I'm on a sodium restrictive diet, trying to keep my daily intake below 2000mg. This meal was perfect! I changed to portion to just 1 and used 1.5oz ounces egg noodles. Boiled as normal but added a few frozen peas and broccoli florets to the noodles about 2 minutes before they were ready. Sautéed the garlic as called for and  tossed all together in a bowl. Topped with the Parmesan, a little spray butter, and a few squirts of lemon juice and it was a perfect very low sodium lunch!  And the portion size was just right.

I really like how simple and basic this is. It allows plenty of room for additional ingredients to suit my personal tastes, while offering a solid base of flavour. I favour garlic taste, so I added some garlic salt to the olive oil as well. I dislike tomato sauces, so this is a very nice, quick, and delicious solution for my dinner when I'm running late! Great recipe!

This was not my favorite.  It was very bland.  I ended up having to doctor it up with garlic and italian dressing since that was all that i had.  Its a good base recipe to make your own though.

I'm giving this 5 stars but based on the additions I made. I sauted three cloves of garlic in butter and olive oil. I added garlic salt, pepper, basil, and a few splashes of lemon juice. Topped with parm cheese. It was DELICIOUS! Will make again and again.

Even after reading the reviews and adding ingredients suggested I still found this recipe to be bland. I'm thinking of adding a full tablespoon of Garlic Salt next time to help with the lack of flavor. Good starter recipe though.

This is a nice recipe, but I thought it needed more flavor. I did add a small can of Italian-style diced tomatoes, and that helped. Also, I used garlic powder instead of fresh. This would be a great recipe if your family likes mild and you need a meal fast.

This was okay.  I added tons of garlic.  Leftovers are not very good - pasta gets firm after it's been cooled - so, you may want to cut the recipe in half if you don't have a lot of big eaters!

This was a great base... I added a few things: I used 1 can of diced tomatoes flavored with garlic and balsamic, tripled the amount of garlic, added three table spoons of brown sugar, 2 tbsp butter, and added corn starch to thicken and tossed with 1/2 cup Parmesan.  The second time I made it I also added some Perdue short-cuts Italian flavored, diced and tossed into the sauce as it thickened!  YUMMY!!!

Like others, I added in red pepper flakes (good way to use up all those little Domino's packs in the junk drawer!) and garlic salt. I also used a tbsp of minced garlic rather than a tsp. Oregano and basil were thrown in, as well as fresh broccoli and a leftover lemon garlic roasted chicken breast. Delicious!

We love this recipe. It is simple but tasty.  I also double the garlic and add steamed broccoli and extra parm.  I keep eating up the leftovers for my snack.

I took the other reviewers suggestions and had to dress this dish up to my families liking. I sauted the garlic with some onions in butter instead of the oil. I then added button mushroom to the onions and garlic and sauteed those also. Added some EVOO to the pasta noodles, a splash of lemon, parmesan and poured the sauteed mixture over it all. This dish definitely needed salt added. Would have probably been good with some sweet basil. We all ate it...not bad!

This is a good starter recipe but it just needs to be spiced up.  Like some of the reviews I read I also added a good amount of garlic 4 cloves (not small) and onion.  I added the onion and garlic in with the chicken and olive oil and let it cook and then added everything to the pasta.  I didn't measure anything just kept tasting it until it tasted good to me.  Work with it and it turns out good.

This was a nice side dish to broiled salmon. Not very heavy and tasted good, though nothing exceptional.

Ok, so I started off trying to make this recipe exactly... I decided to substitute margarine for the olive oil (just kind of taste preference) added a bit more minced garlic. Then I realized that I didn't have enough parmessan cheese. So I decided to add a bit of mozzarella and cream cheeses. (I took the albino thing a bit too far!) The sauce wasn't pretty to look at, I melted the cheeses into the margarine and garlic. But the taste was superb! I will definitely keep this recipe and try to make it with only parmessan (or some other interesting cheese mix!) next time.

This was light, and quite tasty. I topped with a grilled chicken breast and it looked like something you get at a resturahnt. It's quick, easy, and fairly healthy -- you can't go wrong with this. I may add some fresh basil next time for a new flavor.

Good stuff! Served a nice meaty sauce over it, and it went very well. The flavour of the pasta is nice, without being overpowering.

My daughter and I eat one of a number of variations of this dish frequently for lunch or dinner.  Make sure you use a good quality olive oil and real parmesean cheese (not the stuff in the green can).  If you like, you can also add some crushed red pepper flakes to the garlic while it sautes to add a little kick.

I can see how this would have no flavour if it wasn't modified some.  I added basil to the oil and garlic.  Like others I also added broccoli to the mix to give it some additional flavour.  Make sure to have lots and lots of parmesan cheese around, you'll need it for this dish!

I love this recipe!  It's so quick and easy to make.  I pick up whatever kind of pasta catches my interest at the store, and I use shredded parmesean and a little shredded mozerella too.  Because it cooks quickly and has so few ingredients it's perfect for busy college students like myself.  Also, if you get "smart pasta" or something of the sort and go light on the olive oil, it's a filling meal without too many calories.

I loved this pasta, but I made several changes to it after reading the previous reviews. I added extra garlic, some onion, bacon, a bit of an instant cheese sauce pack and some ground chilli. Probably without some changes I would've found it way too bland, but in the end everyone devoured it, including my VERY picky flatmate (who lives off deep-fried chips most the time!)

I agree with others, no flavor to this dish.  It tasted like oily pasta.  Not good.  This is a lot like the Garlic Angel Hair Pasta on this site.  That one is excellent and I think it benefits from using a less substantial pasta.

I made this the other night for dinner and it was very good.  I did, like most people, make several changes.  I also added some chopped up onion, red pepper flakes and broccoli.  I also added a lot more garlic...since I love a strong garlic flavor.  I also added a little Ramano cheese which added a nice flavor!  Was great as a left over for lunch the next day..will be making this again!

Great for making ahead.  I made everything the night before & stored in seperate containers, then threw everything together right before in a container with a lid and shook.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes with a bit of the juice, shredded chedder, and cut up chicken fingers.  The flavour was mild which was perfect for a side dish.  Everyone loved it.

I really liked this recipe.  It was light and great as a side dish and something different than sauces with pasta.  I used whole grain pasta, added some minced garlic and a small head of broccoli florets.  And of course lots of cheese!

This is a good recipe - a nice change if you don't want red sauce.  I used extra garlic, and added sauteed onions and tomatoes.  It was good and easy.

A simple and mild recipe that is perfect for a side dish.  Definitely not flavourful enough to hold its own as a main dish, but it is a great compliment to stronger dishes like chicken cacciatore or whatever.  Thank you for sharing

This recipe was great. It was very quick and easy. I used it as a side dish with Honey Mustard Chicken. I added 2 cups steamed broccoli and 1/4 cup toasted pecans. Try adding some chopped chicken breast for some protein. I will definitely be making this again and again. Next time I will add some more broccoli though.

Very good! I sauteed a few grape tomatoes along with the garlic. I added 2 sliced, lightly breaded chicken breasts (Perdue frozen Simply Smart). Dinner was ready in less than 30 minutes and was delicious.

This is great, I make it all the time.  The only difference is I add a little more garlic (BIG garlic fan here) broccoli and a little dash of red pepper flakes.  I would imagine that some grilled chicken or shrimp wouldn't be a bad idea either.

4 Stars because it is a good start, but made better by sauteeing garlic with red pepper flakes and anchovy (yes, it dissolves and adds a nice saltiness).  Either one or two filets or some anchovy paste,  which is more convenient.  Then toss with pasta and parmesan reggiano.  Yum

Like many of the other reviewers I added red pepper flakes and I also addd a dash of italian seasoning. I had the issue of the parmesean cheese clumping at the end, but it was still tasty! I didn't add any veggies to the pasta and I think next time I will have it as a side dish to chicken rather than as a main dish. Simple and yummy! And a husband-pleaser:)

I have to tell you....if i was a poor college student this would probaly be a grand meal. I only made it because I had all the ingredients on hand, even the red pepper flakes, maybe the lemon juice makes a diffence but i hardly doubt it.

This side dish left a lot to be desired.  We used half the amount of pasta, 2 tbsp oil, and the full amount of cheese and garlic...it still needed something.  We often make a recipe found on this site that is very similar to this dish called "Calabrese Style Spaghetti"...it is significantly better tasting.

I have been making this for years. I'm finding that just about everyone has made a variation of this recipe and here I thought I came up with this myself! 
I make it with thick spaghetti, then I drain when pasta is al dente, then return to the same hot saucepan, add a tablespoon or two (depending on the amt. of pasta you're making) to the hot spaghetti, then a touch (around a tsp or so - use your judgment) of garlic-infused extra virgin olive oil (can be found around the bakery section of your grocery store - used in dipping sauces for breads), also depending on how much pasta you're making. Then I add the parmasean cheese in the green can and sprinkle a dash (tsp) of parsley on top for color.

This pasta was great! It was a big hit with my five year old and two year old, after a few days of them complaining about not liking dinner it was nice to have them eat a good portion. I think you could make this as a main meal, which we did and added some chopped chicken to make it a little more filling, or you could make it as a side dish as well. I could see us having it both ways. Thank you for the recipe, TUGORETZ!

omg!!! i absolutely loved this side dish, i added Mozzarella to it for a more cheesy flavor but my family loved it. My step-mom doesn't even like pasta and she had a big portion of it! Thank you so much, 5 stars!

I made this last night and thought it was great.  I had it with sauteed pepper shrimp.  I also added some italian shredded cheese (we love extra cheesy foods!) And made myself a little bit of pesto to add to my own plate.

I thought this was the easiest and tastiest recipe I have ever eaten. I made honey mustard grilled chicken and didn't know a healthy, easy side to go along with it. I came across this recipe and had to try it. I did do some alterations. While I was boiling the pasta I threw in some broccoli, red and yellow peppers(chopped).I put them in when the pasta was about to become al dente. I didn't want the broccoli to become too soft, you want a bite to it, so I left them in for approximately 7 minutes. I then drained both the veggies and pasta, placed them in a bowl and followed threw with the rest of the recipe. The veggies gave the pasta color and taste. I recommend this to everyone, it's a great dish ans side dish.

It was quite flavorless.  I tried it because my girls don't care for red sauce, but they took a couple bites and wouldn't finish it. We won't be making this again.

I really did not enjoy this recipe. However, my husband absolutely loves it. I think I put to much garlic in it for my liking. So it is not actually the recipe I don't think. My husband is very picky with new recipes and he loves this one. Maybe it is a " guy " thing. Anyway, I think it would have been great without so much garlic.

It's a delicious healthier pasta! I plan to add chicken to it sometime in the future, but for now, it's great just as it is!

Good quick penne recipe that compliments any strong main meal. I used a bit of shredded mozzarella instead of parmesan. Also added dill and pepper

I made the recipe as it said. It went great with the Chicken and Basil Cream Sauce that is on this site. I didn't need to change anything.
