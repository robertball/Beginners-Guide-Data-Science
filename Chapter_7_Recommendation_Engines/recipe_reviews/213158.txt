Really great dish! My husband loved it!!  I'm not a fan of cream cheese in pasta, so I used ricotta cheese instead, and real fresh grated parmesan instead of the pre-grated Kraft parmesan. I will definitely make this dish again!

This was very good. I used Di Parma 4 cheese for the pasta sauce and left out the spinach. I have very picky eaters and they all ate this.

Excellent! Added fresh garlic, parsley, oregano, and crushed red pepper flakes to kick the flavor up a notch. My husband absolutely raved over this. Thanks!

I really liked this recipe, but I changed it quite a bit.  The changes made it amazing!  when cooking the chicken I also added 1.5 TBS extra virgin olive oil,  1 medium white onion, small zucchini, 4 cloves of minced garlic and 1/4 cup of fresh basil, 1tsp. salt and 1 tsp. oregano.  I also didn't add the light cream cheese or the other cheeses.  Instead I added 1/2 cup Italian mixed cheese to the mixture and then added the rest of the cheese on the top for the last 3 minutes of cooking.  It turned out amazing!  I loved it and my boyfriend was raving about it!  Make these changes and you'll enjoy this tasty dish!!!

This is a great pasta recipe. My kids loved it, and they are so picky. I used a bag of frozen spinach and 16 ounces of multigrain pasta (whole box), but it turned out great. The baking dish needs to be bigger, I used 13 by 9. The multigrain pasta is great, it stays consistent, and doesn't get mushy, and it's healthy too.

Used regular penne instead of multigrain, frozen spinach, added some garlic when I sauteed the chicken, and no tomatoes (added some extra sauce) and it came out pretty good.  Something was definitely missing, so I'll work on tweaking it next time, but will definitely make again.

Easy and quick to make and was good.  I think the chicken should be cooked with more just just the basil add first for more flavor.

This is a really great base recipe to change and substitute as needed. I found this searching for a pasta dish (my husband was craving it) and wanted to use things I had on hand. I omitted spinach (hubby doesnt care fot it), added lots of garlic and more basil than called for and subed feta for the mozz (bc thats waht i had on hand) and it was a big hit! Definitely a keeper.

This turned out very well! I used the Mexican cheese blend instead of the Mozzarella and omitted the basil since I didn't have any. Other than that, it was a smash hit as I served it with some garlic bread and a fresh salad.

Fast, easy, nutritious.  What else do you do you need for the dinner.  Didn't have fresh spinach, so I used a 10 oz. box of frozen chopped spinach.  Not gourmet, or very original, but it fit the bill for a weeknight dinner.

awesome recipe... i mixed alfredo and marinara for the sauce, which i probably wouldn't do again because it was real heavy after adding the cream cheese... also, i added mushrooms... i would definitely make this again because you can vary the flavors so much depending on the sauce you use.

Easy and tasty.  I used the 1.5 cups pasta the recipe called for, but I think it could have used 2 cups.  I also added onion and garlic when I sauteed the chicken.  It was very good!  Looks like leftovers will freeze well.

This is a very delicious and easy recipe. I ended up using 2 1/2 cups of noodles because 1 1/2 cups wouldn't have been enough. I ended up using half diced tomato with chilies because that is what I had and I added extra seasonings with extra cheese.. Yummy :-)

An excellent dish that was just as tasty the sixth time as it was the first (I made this for my dinners during my work week). Might try tossing in a bay leaf to add a little more savory flavor next time.

My family loved this meal! However I tasted the noodles before I put it in the oven and I thought it tasted better before. The 20 minutes in the oven made it a little too dry. Next time I make it I'm going to add garlic to the chicken and only put it in the oven for 10 minutes or just enough time to let the cheese melt instead of the 20 minutes.

I like this recipe. My sister and my brother in law loved it more. Only changes I added was a tad more spices/ seasoning to the chicken and a little sugar to my sauce.

It's a good recipe, but maybe needed more cheese, some salt, in general extra "stuff".  But still good!  Great with a salad!

This would probably be a great recipe, but I'm a murphy's law cook and my 'alterations' turned it into a mushy mess. Here's what I learned:


1) Don't use quick cooking pasta. It disintegrates, and mixed with frozen spinach turns into glop. 
2) The missing ingredient is garlic. Lots of garlic.
3) NEVER use quick cook pasta. Seriously.

This was very, very yummy! I used less spinach than called for(my boyfriend is spinach-phobic) and he reluctantly admitted he loved it- even with the spinach. I accidentally picked up a can of whole tomatoes instead of diced, so I just drained them and chopped those up, and I think the extra juices from that made the sauce a bit too runny...but it was still very, very good! This one definitely goes in the recipe box.

OMG this is so delicious!! Super easy too! I actually used canned, cooked chicken because that's the only thing I had on hand. Didn't make a difference though, still a very flavorful recipe! Would definitely make this again.

Great recipe, though I admit I didn't try it with chicken.  My chicken was still frozen when I opened the fridge, but I saw some bulk Italian sausage and thought I would try that in place of chicken.  Awesome flavor, the kids love it. Still haven't tried the chicken version because the sausage version is great. Fits best in a 2.5 quart casserole dish

Delicious pasta dish.  I only had regular penne, so I just used that instead of the multigrain.  Followed the recipe otherwise, and this was enjoyed by the whole family.  A side salad and garlic bread make for a great weeknight meal.

I really like this and have made it several times.  I don't ever put spinach in it, but my family, even picky kids, eat it.  I, just out of habit, used a 9x13 pan and my husband likes things saucy, so I added an entire jar of sauce.

This is very easy to make!  I've made it once with chicken which was delicious and this time with ground beef.  Both very good!! I used a 8oz can of tomato sauce and a can of condensed tomato soup.  I didn't have basil so I used oregano and garlic for flavor.  I had fresh tomatoes from my garden so I diced those up and added them instead of a can of tomatoes.  I followed the recipe as directed!  Excellent and easy to make!  My family loves it!!!

This is a great recipe to use as a base and get creative! I added 2 green zucchini, 5 minced garlic cloves and crushed red pepper flakes to the chicken bits with olive oil and sautéed them together. Then I added 1 lb of asparagus (trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces) to the last 3-4 minutes of the boiling pasta. I omitted the spinach because I was using what I had on hand. I used cheddar/jack mix and fresh parmesan. Baked covered for 10 minutes with foil then dusted a bit more cheese and baked uncovered for about 10 more minutes. Since the recipe calls for kraft parm, trust and believe I liberally topped off my plate with that.  And this is SOOOOOO good left over. As pastas usually are.

Just made this for my college roommates - everyone LOVED it. Kept raving about how amazing it was. I used Ricotta cheese instead of Cream cheese, and tasted great! I also used an italian mix and mozzarella and sprinkled with parmesan. It was an overall hit!

The family loved it!  I did use more penne pasta because I wanted more servings.  I used a little more than 1/2 the box and it wasn't multigrain.  I just picked a plate full of spinach leaves out of a 50/50 salad.  I seasoned my chicken with seasoning salt, garlic salt, pepper, AND the basil. I used 2 cups of mozzarella shredded cheese and also added another shredded 3 cheese blend (white, sharp, and mild cheddar cheese.

This was pretty unremarkable.  I used regular (not multigrain) pasta and added mushrooms and extra sauce.  Also used full fat cheese, and it still was pretty blah.  Kids wouldn't even eat it.  I just don't think we're casserole people.

This is one recipe I keep pretty true to the ingredients listed without many modifications. Always comes out delish and my friends and family enjoy. I do season the chicken while cooking much more with garlic, onion powder, Italian herbs, salt and pepper. I believe you can never season chicken too much.

My family raved about this! It's the perfect recipe to use as a starter for using up what you have.  It's very forgiving.  I had mushrooms so I tossed those in but I didn't have cream cheese so I used chive & garlic brie that was about to expire. I didn't have any mozzarella so I used cheddar. I'm sure if you didn't have chicken it would be great with ground beef or left-over roast or turkey.

This was definitely the best recipe I've tried from Kraft as of yet, and from anywhere, lately! The only thing I did differently was use a 5oz package of spinach, and some more mozzarella on top. More spinach would probably be fine, but not sure about the entire amount. Just delicious, though - equivalent to a restaurant dinner, for sure. Will gladly serve this to company to impress. Easy and so tasty.

I loved this. I used fusili pasta and frozen spinach which both worked wonderfully. I may increase the chicken next time but it was great as is (I used a garlic and herb pasta sauce).

I used a pasta sauce without salt, and we added salt to our own dish as desired.  I did not think it was necessary to use the diced tomatoes.  Can probably substitute chopped broccoli instead of the spinach.  I'm all about not having a lot of dishes to clean up afterward.  As written, this recipe requires a skillet (to cook the chicken), a large pot (for the pasta), and a casserole dish, all of which I do not put in my dishwasher (they take up too much room).  Therefore, I suggest that you could use COOKED CHICKEN to eliminate the skillet, or maybe even frozen, breaded chicken (it would taste more like CHICKEN PARMESAN) - just cook as directed on the package and serve it  with the casserole.   As I see it, the casserole really did not need baking, either.

I'm going to give this 4 stars even tho I didn't really care for it as I made it. Had I followed the recipe more I'm sure it would have been better. I used an inferior brand os pasta sauce that I really didn't care for.

I found this recipe to be rather bland and added cajun spice to jazz it up.  I did not have any cream cheese, so used some heavy cream I had leftover from another recipe.  Still not sure if the cream cheese would have added more flavor.  Also, I used whole wheat pasta -- as the recipe called for -- and found it's taste incompatible with tomato sauce.  I want to like ww pasta, but it's just not the same.  The like the basic premise of this recipe, but it needs a lot of tweaking.  I would also double the spinach.

This was very easy and tasted pretty good. I used frozen chopped spinach (drained and thawed), its what I had on hand. I think it would also be good with ground beef/chicken instead of the boneless chicken breast. Would maybe add an onion when browning the meat next time.
I misread the ingredients and added a can of chopped tomatoes instead of using fresh. That was fine, but I think next time I'll double the pasta sauce and omit the tomatoes altogether.

This was a quick and easy recipe that wasn't bad. I didn't think it was extremely delicious but it was nice to have something different for a change. :) Definitely will use it on a night that I don't feel like cooking!
