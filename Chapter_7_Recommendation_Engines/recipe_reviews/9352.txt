OK, am I the only one who ran into problems here?  The mousse was way, way too stiff and it was crunchy from the pudding powder.  I added about 1 cup of half and half to compensate and then it wasn't chocolatey enough for me, so I added some Special Dark syrup.  I still felt like there was a little too much crunchy texture from the pudding, so I heated the gelatin back to hot before adding it in as the last step.  That helped a lot!  The recipe was good in the end, with a little fixing up but not a 5 star.  My favorite recipe for mousse is richer with melted dark chocolate and this recipe pales in comparison to it, so only 4, not 5.

This recipe was delicous. It was ready in a snap. I brought it to my sisters' house for Christmas dessert and it disappeared. From reading one of the other reviews, I cut down on the amount of rum used in the whipped topping. Instead of 2 teaspoons, I only used half a teaspoon. I found the flavor just right. Also, instead of chocolate curls, I crushed Oreo cookies (minus the filling) and sprinkled that on top. Wonderful!!!

Could never get the topping to work.  Tastes great without it.  For those who don't love the rum flavor, you can use only 1 tsp instead of 2.

Very tasty, very easy to make.  Cutting back on the rum is definitely a good idea though.

I followed the recipe exactly and the pie turned out GREAT and easy to make! The rum I added was coconut rum, but next time I will add one more teaspoon than the recipe calls for...we could taste a little rum, but not very much.

I wish I would have read the reviews before I made this recipe for my family for Thanksgiving. I love rum but this recipe was too overboard. Definetly cut back. This was my first Thanksgiving and I'm glad I made 4 different pies because the look on my families face when they tried this it was priceless. Not a good thing though. I must say however this recipe was extrememly easy to make and if you are pressed for time this is the route to take!

This is a very nice no bake pie and is very good if you like the flavor of rum with a chocolate compliment. The rum will dominate the pie in this recipie. Most people enjoyed it at my christmas party and it looked great with chocolate shavings on the cream topping!

This dessert was absolutely AMAZING! SO GOOD! I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it.  I could not find a 3.9 oz packet of instant chocolate pudding so I used 2- 2.03 oz packages, which worked out perfect. I also, used whipping cream to make the topping and vanilla extract instead of the rum. My family devoured it and the dessert was better the next day! Will be making this again as this is a dessert you can prepare the night before.
