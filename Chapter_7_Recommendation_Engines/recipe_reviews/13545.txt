I had high hopes for this recipe, but it was fairly tastless.  Jiffy mix has better flavor.

Excellent recipe. Prepare without the onions and canned corn for a more traditional Spoon Bread.

Very big hit at the holiday party. I added 1/4 cup of sugar to this. This was exactly what we were looking for, will make again as a side.

This is sitting in our kitchen, 1/2 served but not really consumed... we really didn't enjoy this.  Too time consuming (stove watching & stirring) to really accomplish much else except maybe, MAYBE stir browning beef, but really, no one enjoyed it as I hoped.  I think I'll try the Chi Chi's corn cake recipe, that's more like what I was hoping from this.  
More like a corn meal mush quiche.

I used 2 cups milk, one cup half and half and one cup vanilla soy milk.  This recipe is very good.  It's a nice variation to cornbread or a casserole.  It has a mild flavor, but is delicious.  It is creamy and bakes up light and fluffy.  My wife and 3 yr. old loved it.  I will make this again, maybe with some sharp cheddar and sour cream...

I made this to go with Rosemary Chicken Stew. This recipe produces a creamier, less grainey texture than most other recipes, which went well with the stew.

I thought I had made a double recipe, but my family loved it so much there was nothing left at the end of dinner.

This was VERY time-consuming, required constant attention, resulted in a kitchen-full of dirty dishes because of the multiple steps, and did not taste like traditional spoon bread.  The whole-kernel corn was distracting to the texture; I would recommend using a can of cream corn instead for anyone else trying this.  I am moving on to a different spoon bread recipe; this one is not a keeper for my family.

This is a great basic recipe and lends itself well to experimentation. I used chives instead of onions and sour cream (diluted with the liquid from the canned corn) instead of milk. I also used half the butter and substituted rosemary flavored olive oil for the other half. It was amazing!

I used 2 jalape√±os instead of the onions that this recipe calls for. Also, it felt like a lot so I used a bigger baking dish. I thought it was an awesome side and was very complimentary to other things on my plate. I'd totally make it again.
