Very good flavor and texture. I cut the recipe in half and shorten the cooking time by a half hour. We enjoyed this dish a great deal. I will make it again.

I would have given this five stars, but after reading some of the reviewer's suggestions, I used their advice and so the four stars is due to making the changes. I tripled the milk and flour (using heavy cream instead of milk), and reduced the salt and pepper ( just sprinkling some on each layer- so maybe 1 tsp. each in total.) I used Kirkland bacon bits instead of frying up bacon, but other than those adjustments stuck to the original. It had wonderful flavor, creamy and rich with just enough sauce( I can see why people commented about it being dry and needing more liquid, so that is why I tripled it- thanks for the heads up!. The salty, smoky taste of the ham and bacon were a delightful addition to the potatoes and this is high comfort food. I will make this again- very good!

This recipe has a lot of promise but 2 tablespoons of salt and 2 tablespoons of pepper is a lot of spice for 10 potatoes. Also, as another mentioned, there is no way you can cook this for 2 hours and use only 2/3 cup of liquid with a thickener. My first attempt at this recipe was far too salty for us to enjoy but we used milk to reheat the next day and that helped make it more edible. I also used 4 - 4-1/2 cups milk with appropriate amount of flour. 

So anyhow, next time I will  use only 2 teaspoons of salt, 1/2 pepper and more milk with less flour. I may  try parboiling the potatoes to quicken the cooking time as well. 

It's a great recipe otherwise. The flavor was fantastic once we got past the salt. The simplicity was appreciated.

This dish was delicious.  I did modify it a bit, since I was only cooking for 5 people and didn't want a ton of leftovers.  I cut the recipe in half, did not use salt (cheese and ham are salty enough) and swapped potato flour for the regular flour to make it gluten free.  I used 1T of potato flour, and to keep the milk/flour mixture as a liquid, I ended up using 2/3c of skim milk.  It was creamy, great flavor, texture and heard lots of "mmmmm's" during dinner.  Easy to assemble and cooked for about 90 minutes.

OMG  This was great.  I did triple the milk and flour and used 10- 12 potatoes.  I did need to cook the whole two hours plus I left it in the oven with the heat turned off.  It will be great for Christmas tomorrow. :)))))))

The only thing I did different is instead of cubing the ham I put it thru the food processor.  You get ham in every bite and it seems to flavor the potatoes even better.  I tried it both ways but processing the ham is the best way.  I also do the ham this way for ham and bean soup.

Overall, this recipe was very good. After reading some reviews I tweaked this recipe.  I  also made 1/2 of the recipe since the meal was only for my husband and I. First, I made the bacon in the oven.  Then, I cut up the bacon. I shredded 1 cup of cheddar cheese.  I chopped 1/2 an onion and sauteed the onions with 1 T. of butter.  I added 3 T. of flour and  2 and 1/3 cups of milk, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper and whisked the sauce. I let the sauce simmer about 5 minutes. I added some sauce to the bottom of the baking dish.  I sprayed the pan with a cooking spray.  I  then added the bacon to each layer. I added some sauce to the bottom of the pan and layered per directions. The scalloped potatoes were done in an hour.

I made it according to the recipe, though I did have to make more of the flour/milk  mixture.  Covered it with foil (as per the recipe).  Not at all dry. It does make quite a bit.  So, we'll be eating leftovers.  My kids were not too excited about it.  So, while it is good, between the negative kid reaction and the amount of prep time / labor it took (it always takes me longer than stated prep times), I probably won't get around to this recipe again.

I made approximately a half recipe in my mom's big porceline covered iron dutch oven...used the lid instead of foil to cover the casserole. I used 12 (4 for each layer) average golden potatoes and about 1.3 lbs diced ham, and one sliced onion.  I didn't measure the salt and pepper, but I'm certain I didnt come close to using as much of either as the recipe calls for. I ground sea salt from my grinder over each layer as the recipe directed; I will use less next time, it was still too salty.  I just sprinkled pepper evenly over each layer.  I used half the milk...think I will leave out the flour next time and maybe use a little more milk.  I will probably use a little less cheese, too, but it's so good!
The potatoes were cooked perfectly in the dutch oven with the lid on at 350° in two hours.

Takes a lot of love , but sure came together pretty!
Great smell, infused with the ham, potatoes, onions & cheese!! So, so good. Quite filling and makes you proud when you pull from oven. Don’t substitute anything or add. Absolutely perfect just as it is!
Thanks so much

The only change I made as to put the potatoes into two Pyrex pans rather than a roaster because there was too much for one pan. My husband liked the recipe quite well. I think I prefer one with a cream sauce and will that next.

I added one onion instead of two and sautéed the onion first.  My husband wanted less cheese so I cut that in half.  They were amazing!!

Well...tried this and added extra flour and milk according to other reviewers as well as cutting way back on salt.  Baked it for 1 1/2+ hours and the liquid was still that...liquid.  So, I mixed up some cornstarch with water and added teaspoons of the mixture throughout the dish to help thicken the sauce.  Upped the temp to 375 and baked for another 30 minutes.  It was okay...but will go back to making my version.

I didn't use ham. I made these to eat with pork chops. I used double the amount of milk.  And 6 heaping tablespoon of flour then added half a cup of chicken broth (I use better than broth 1Tbs dissolved in the half cup of water) to the flour mixture.  I didn't add any salt. The bacon and broth actually makes it plenty salty enough. And as another reviewer mentioned I baked it for 90 minutes instead of 2 hrs. But I use a slicer and it slices them very thin.

I made it without ham.  Doubled milk/cornstarch and also added more milk at the end.  I started it at 425 for about 15 minutes (until I could see bubbles in milk) and then lowered to 350 so it was done a little sooner.    Easy, delicious and I highly recommend it.

I left out the bacon, cut the cheese to 8 oz, doubled the milk and flour. Also cut the salt to 1 tsp and the pepper to 1/4 tsp.
