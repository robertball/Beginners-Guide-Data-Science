Just made this and it was tasty. I used frozen cauliflower that I pulsed in my blender. I didn't have onion so I substituted with onion powder and also added a little garlic powder in addition to the garlic cloves. I sauteed the chicken with red bell pepper since we love this veggie. Be mindful not to add too much broth as the cauliflower does not absorb the water. You will have to simmer longer to boil off the excess. I think it's actually better to use some type of bouillon cube with a half cup of water. That way you get the full flavor of the concentrated bouillon without the extra water.

I made this recipe it exactly as written.  It was incredibly bland.  It definitely needs salt, and it needs a flavor (the chicken broth did not add much, and the lemon juice did not work with the Parmesan cheese).  I won't be making it again.  My family hated it.

WOW!  This is a great recipe!  Easy to make and wonderful to eat!  The riced cauliflower tasted better, and less filling than rice.  My husband even liked It (normally, he is adverse to trying anything different)!   This recipe can be so versatile, just let your imagination run wild!

We enjoyed this dish ! I wasn’t too sure as I was cooking the cauliflower but another reviewer had said it did need to cook off some of the liquid so after it did, It turned out well! I did use 2 packages of cauliflower ,and added some frozen corn ,we like our vegetables! It actually ended up tasting like a risotto with chicken! I’ll definitely be making this again,thanks for sharing!

Great dish especially if you have some rotisserie chicken on hand. I needed only two servings so I used a cup of chicken.  We like our food with more herbs and spices so I didn't cut the amount of lemon juice, oregano, or parmesan.  It looked kind of bland so I added 1/2 cup of green peas. We ate it all in one sitting. Delicious.

Pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this dish. I love cauliflower, however I've never been able to get on the cauliflower rice bandwagon. Until now! Full disclosure -- I'm on the Whole30, hence why I'm trying to give cauliflower rice another shot, so, I needed to change a couple ingredients to make it Whole30 compliant. But, I imagine I'd like the recipe just as much as if I used the original ingredients. Only caveat, it  definitely needs additional salt & pepper. Basically my Whole30 version was subbing out parm cheese with nutritional yeast, compliant chicken stock, and using leftover roasted chicken (I had the thigh & leg leftover so that's what I used). It made a perfect lunch and I'll be keeping this on my Whole30 menu rotation!

This was great. I didn’t have Parmesan cheese so I used mozzarella cheese. It was very good and easy to make.
