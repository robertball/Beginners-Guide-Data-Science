Better than Kneader’s. Yippee, my husband loved it. And it didn’t stay around long enough.

Excellent. Followed the recipe as is because it was my first time making it. I may substitute the vegetable oil for butter next time just to try the difference. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

11.27.19  This baked up very high in the center, so I had to trim about 1-1/2” off the bottom of the cake.  I used a Le Creuset® silicon bundt pan which is a little smaller than the listed 10” pan, so I’m sure that’s why this happened (not the recipe’s fault).  We’re not into too much sweetness these days, so I just couldn’t see adding 2 cups of sugar.  I reduced that amount (personal taste here) and sub'd Truvia® Baking Blend to cut back calories.  Sweet enough for us, and you still get a nice kick of tartness  from the cranberries. The cake baked up very moist, and the cranberries were evenly distributed throughout.  I couldn’t taste any orange flavor at all, and that was a bit of a disappointment.  In the future, I’ll add more orange zest, perhaps even a little orange extract because a cranberry-orange combo is divine. This was EXTREMELY easy to make, and that’s definitely a plus for this recipe.  Thanks for sharing, we really enjoyed it.
