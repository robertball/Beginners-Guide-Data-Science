I did not have vanilla yogurt, I did have nonfat greek yogurt. I used that instead and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also used two frozen bananas and omitted the ice. Good basic smoothie.

This was ok, but it was too sweet. I think it would have been better without the honey.

I helped my daughter make this, she used banilla yogurt, 1 banana and 1/2 cup of a caprisun pouch! She liked it.... easy enough for her to remember to make again.

I used vanilla almond milk instead of milk & added no yogurt. Threw in some broken up pecans. It came out pretty good. It was my first smoothie.

It was really good! I didn't add honey because someone said not too.
