this recipe is very tasty, not too strong. the dough does need to be refrigerated just not too long. I chilled mine for the afternoon while I ran errands and it was rock hard. I had to let it sit for about 10 minutes before I could roll it. It doesn't get soft too fast, so it is fairly easy to work with.

These were very nice!  I didn't have molasses in the house so I wanted a recipe that didn't call for it.  These have a nice mild taste...sweet enough for my kids and not overly sweet for my husband.  They held their shape nicely.  I would recommend you let them cool on the sheet a minute before removing them so your gingerbread people don't end up missing limbs :)
p.s. I only chilled them about 1/2 hour and they were fine.  Also, we used canned vanilla frosting to decorate our gingerbread people and the kids had a ball.

Made these for a conference, went down an amazing treat, added a touch more cinammon and ginger to make 'em taste a little more. Once people had the taste for them, they came back for more.

very good recipe, I subbed molasses for corn syrup, took out 2 tablespoons of flour and subbed corn starch, added extra ginger and cinnamon, and added 1/4 tspn allspice. 10 minutes leaves them just a little bit soft....perfect!

I made 2 batches for my son's teddy bear birthday breakfast picnic, both batches came out different but both tasted good. 
I bought small tubes of icing & let the kids decorate them themselves.
It was a hit & worked out well :)

Loved this! I am not a cut-out-cookie kind of person so I was reluctant to try one, but my teenaged daughters boyfriend requested gingerbread cookies so we decided to try. This one is great! Rolled out really easily, easy to handle and the flavor was great. Interestingly the ingredients call for butter and corn syrup and the recipe says molasses and margarine... we went for the latter, skipped the cloves (didnt have any) and doubled up on the cinnamon and ginger- and it was great! Only chilled it for about 30 min and between batches and it rolled out fine. Will absolutely make these again.

These look great but are lacking in flavor (I used half molasses & half corn syrup; perhaps all molasses would have been better). My gay lovers definitely thought they needed some more spice.

Very easy. I chilled the dough for less than 30 minutes and the rolling and cutting out was super-easy. The taste is very good as well, I decorated some with powdered sugar while they were still warm and they looked too pretty to eat!

I used molasses and more cinnamon/ginger but no cloves.  Great flavor, but a bit dry and not as soft and chewy as I'd like.

Delicious!!! I made these one night when some friends were over; between four people the cookies disappeared and they were begging for more.

I'm not a big fan of gingerbread cookies. I make them just because it's the thing to do at Christmas time.  These were awesome! We ate every last one. Not too strong of a flavor, but really wonderful. They also held their shape really well.

These spread a little too much, just a little.  I noticed the thicker ones spread more.  I reduced the cinnamon to 1t since we're dealing with gingerbread cookies.  Also added half t salt.  Very mild tasting.  I'm not so sure anyone would think these were gingerbread, if it weren't for the shape.  Next day:  Well, of the three recipes I tried, these are almost gone.  :?  Huh?  'Seems they pass the taste test, but not the gingerbread cookie test ... I guess?  'Upping one more star.
