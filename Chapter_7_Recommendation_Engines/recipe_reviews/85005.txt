This is just okay, but in all fairness I don't think it was intended to be a 5-star dessert. I used just 1 T. of sugar and the strawberry sauce was still plenty sweet. I also thickened it with a bit of corntstarch and cold water. Still, it's nothing more than doctored up instant pudding. Actually, the sauce is great on its own, and would be wonderful over ice cream or pound cake, or to top a basic cheesecake. These parfaits are great in a pinch for a quick, emergency use of fresh strawberries, which was exactly what I was looking for. Four stars for the sauce, three for the dessert.

I made these with cheesecake pudding instead of vanilla and they were SO GOOD! The other benefit of using cheesecake pudding (Jell-o) is that it takes less time to prepare than Jell-o's vanilla pudding; after sitting for five minutes, it's ready to eat, and it's just perfect with strawberries.

Wasnt a terrible recipe, the strawberry sauce was a bit runny though. I used both chocolate and vanilla pudding. The vanilla looked nicer, but I liked the way the chocolate tasted with the strawberries better.

We didn't really like the strawberry/jam layer.  It looked beautiful in my glass coffee mugs with pedestals though!

Not bad!  I didn't have any strawberry jelly and used a seedless raspberry jelly instead, that gave it a nice good kick.  I also topped it with a little bit of granola for an extra crunch.  Very easy to make.

The flavors were great, but I found the jam to leave the mixture still too runny even after chilling for an hour. I also thought it needed maybe some oats, granola or maybe crushed vanilla wafers and a little whipped topping to give it more of a presentation for parties. Still a great tasting a dessert and definitely a go to for those hot summertime eves.

Tasted pretty good. Not a dessert I would really make for company, but it was a nice light dessert.

I added some oats to the mix for the sweet taste and for more nutrition, for the kids. This was simple and was done rather quickly. The taste was excellent, though this is not design to be a 5 star dessert in a restaurant.

This is really good. I didn`t use the sugar because I find jam sweet anyway. I was glad I did or it would have been too sweet. But it was awesome. Would make again. If you don`t like too sweet leave out the sugar. But try this recipe, easy and yummy!

This dessert doesn't get much easier.  I used instant chocolate pudding because I didn't realize that we had no vanilla until I'd already started cooking the strawberry sauce.  Next time I make this, I will not add any sugar to the strawberries at all - we found the them to be VERY sweet.  I will also use vanilla pudding because I think it would taste better than the chocolate.  One last thing - this dessert really needs a dollop of some sort of whipped topping (cool whip would be my choice), but that's just a personal preference.

This tasted great but it didn't layer very well and was a tad watery. Maybe it was something I did wrong. My daughter loved it though so I will make this again.
