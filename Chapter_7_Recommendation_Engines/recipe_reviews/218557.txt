This a great combination of flavors.  Very refreshing.  A friend of mine served me a version of this; she had added toasted pine nuts and some fresh mint.  Delicious!  I made it for my family last night and they loved it!

Delicious!  I can't resist adding seeds to most salads...roasted sunflower seeds complement this very nicely.

This salad is amazing! What wonderful flavours. I can't count the number of times I've made this over the summer both at home at at friends' homes for potluck. It's a hit every time! Making it again tonight for dinner. Can hardly wait!

I've recently served this salad at two separate picnics.  It was a huge hit, even with those folks who "don't like salad".  I wound up sending this recipe to a dozen folks who wanted to recreate this easy & delicious dish.  First rate.

It has a very mild, but refreshing flavor.  My husband and I liked it very much and I'll keep it as a summer favorite when I'm wanting to change up the pace a little.  I wondered about adding fresh mint to it and plan to try it next time I make it.

Fabulous!  I didn't have to add thing to it -- and I ALWAYS add something to a recipe.  I've never seen my husband ooh and aah over a SALAD, but he did with this one.  This has become our forever "go to" salad.  Thank you, thank you, BamaHaole!

I had made it and it was absolutely delicious. The watermelon sure is a refreshing touch, and I've always been a fan of arugula. Added boiled, unsalted chicken breast as a filler.

Perfect sweet and savory salad.  The arugala provides the perfect hint of pepper.  I only had the red basalmic but doubt it made a huge difference. I also added toasted pecans that added another level of crunch.   Delish!

This is currently our favorite salad. We have it probably once a week, if watermelon is available. I hope we never get tired of it from eating it too often.

Loved this refreshingly different salad, though I added less oil and more vinegar for the dressing.

I thought it was good, but it really needed some texture to it, some crunch.  I added some toasted almonds, maybe some croutons would work?

Took this salad to a potluck and everyone raved about the flavors and the dressing - and it was super easy! I followed the recipe but didn't measure the veggies or watermelon. Turned out great :)

I  just found my go to salad for the summer. Fantastic!  I  just used baby arugula and regular balsamic vinegar. Quick and easy and very kid friendly.  My 5 year old loved it!

The salad is excellent but I suggest you either make it by servings or eat it all up the first day because after the first day the greens in the salad are limp and wilted.

Delicious & easy to make, especially if you prep in advance. I tossed in 2 ears of roasted  corn cut off the cob & put some cut red onion to the side for those in my household who prefer it.

I added cucumbers, mint, and toasted almonds and held the onion. Made the dressing with white jalapeno lime balsamic vinegar from Olive and Grape. Go light on the olive oil as it's not needed. My guests loved the final salad!

We always enjoy this with in season watermelon.  I don't add oil. I see no need for the extra calories

I went light on the onions and sliced very thin with mandiline. Also only had quarter cup of grape tomatoes on hand. Doubled the amount of watermelon. My book club loved it.

So delish!  I sauteed the onions till they were soft but otherwise followed the recipe.  So juicy and light, with the counterpoint of the cheese..  Such great flavors and textures really balance each other well.
