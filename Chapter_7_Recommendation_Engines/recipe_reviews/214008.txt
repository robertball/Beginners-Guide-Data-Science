Very tasty!  I was skeptical about the wine sauce, but it ended up coming out perfectly.  It was quite a labor intensive recipe, though, I'd suggest giving yourself plenty of time.  I also used lamb loin to save money, and it was still perfectly delicious.

It is absolutely delicious but it does take a lot of time to make, and also a mess to clean up.  It would be a perfect Boxing Day type of dish.  The best way to use lamb leftovers if you have the time!

This dish was good but not all the time required.  I was disappointed.
