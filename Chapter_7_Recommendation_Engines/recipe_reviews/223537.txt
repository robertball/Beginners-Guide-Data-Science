This Hot Dog Chili really works well.  I found the other review confusing.  I used slab thick cut bacon so that might have given me the edge with the bacon flavor.  I also used beef bouillon packets not cubes.  The cubes have a lot more salt. Maybe this was why I just didn't have the salt issue.  I didn't get the bitter taste either.  Can't figure that one out.  Mine was great! Gone in a flash.

As the first reviewer, I feel really, REALLY bad, but we did not like this at all...The concept was great and I had high hopes, but it fell short for us. We felt it had a bitter after taste and it was very salty (I didn't even use the salt at the end). I also wish that the bacon flavor was more prominent. I halved the recipe, and it made A LOT, so keep that in mind.

Never before has so much work and expense gone into something so mediocre. My family said "next time just buy a can of chili." I agree with them.
