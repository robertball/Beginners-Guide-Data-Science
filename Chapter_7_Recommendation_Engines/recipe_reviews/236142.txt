Very good! I do think that they need a bit more salt, but that's my personal preference. These were very easy to make, and they rose beautifully. This is more of a dense biscuit than a light and fluffy biscuit, which worked well with our dinner tonight. I wish I would've had the lard, but I didn't, so I used butter flavored shortening. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

My goodness. Never heard of these before yesterday. Watching a TV show last night and they were mentioned. I quickly looked it up and made them this morning  ( it's Thanksgiving Day) with sausage gravy. My other half's fave. They were great! Used butter. I don't even know where you can get lard. Halved the recipe. Made 4 gigantic biscuits! We loved them! Will make these again for sure! Captain said he loved the texture. Yum!

Very delicious and easy. I was looking for a good biscuit recipe with lard and found this one! I have made it three different times the first with the standard recipe, second substituting 1/4 cup flower with whole wheat and the third substituting 1 cup flower with whole wheat (a much stronger whole wheat taste but still good). They are more dense (perhaps because of the lard) but i love them and so does everyone else. When ever i make them the roommates hang around waiting for them to finish and grab the first biscuit. I made them with gravy (excellent) and without, eating them with butter and jam (excellent). The recipe only makes about 7-9 depending on the size, i wouldn't call them "big-as-cat-head" they serve 2-3 people (maybe 4 if you are all light eaters/depending on what else you are eating) so for a group i would double the recipe.

I make these often. They always disappear quickly.  Like some others I increased the salt a bit and used a combination of milk and yogurt instead of butter milk.

I used butter as the lard because that was what I had. I had to add a little more flour so I could divide into biscuits because it was very sticky, but they turned out perfect and tasted great!

I didn't make them quite as big as a cathead, and I made them on a cookie sheet. I used soymilk with a little lemon juice, because I didn't have buttermilk (and I limit my dairy intake). They are really good. A bit crumbly when slicing, probably because I made them as drop biscuits on a cookie sheet. I mixed several flours, because I was using up leftover bits- some all purpose white, some gluten free, and 1/2 cup cozonac (which is a little sweet).  Terrific. my new go to  biscuit.

These are NOT cathead biscuits!  No butter or cake flour.  too smooth and not craggy.  Way too dense.

These are so easy, delicious, and economical! Have made them a few times now and everyone in my family loves them. Excellent alongside a chicken dinner, stew, chilli or just with jam and butter. Also tried them with the half yogurt half milk variation as someone else recommended and they were just as good, slightly richer. Really a winning recipe that I'll continue to use.

Almost a five!   The flavor was very good and the ease of making them was great.  I do prefer mine to be a little more crumbly and moist on the inside .  

The only variation  I used was one I used to see my grandmother use.  After the biscuits were ready in  the pan, she would make a small indention with  a spoon on top of the biscuit and put a small amount of oil on to.  This leaves the tops of the biscuits beautifully cooked, though they may not brown as much on top as on the bottom.

These were so much better than another recipe I tried recently. I did have to add more flour than the recipe called for, but they still turned out great.
