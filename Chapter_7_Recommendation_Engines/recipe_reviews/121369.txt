I used fresh peaches (6 cups) and otherwise followed the recipes as written.  It is very delicious and easy to make.  I thought the sweetness was perfect.

Luscious! I made 1/2 the recipe, used fresh peaches and splenda. My husband (Joel) and I loved it! I'd make it again for sure.

We LOVED this!  The texture of the crust is melt-in-your mouth; and it was so easy, I just made it in the food processor and then patted in the pan with the back of a long spoon.  I cut the reicpe in half- it's best warm, but it's good cold too.  I will definitely be making this again!  We had this at the end of our German-themed meal a few days ago.

This was very good and very easy to bake.  I used fresh peaches and only used 2/3 of the crust to cover a 9x13 pan and had plenty. This also lasted well over several days.

I made this recently for a dinner club that my husband and I belong to.  We were putting together a German themed night and I made this for our dessert.  It was a hit!  Everyone just raved about it!  I did not make any changes to the recipe and I found it very easy to make.  It was best the same day as it was prepared.  I left it on the counter all afternoon until our dinner that evening.  Once I put the leftovers in the refrigerator that evening I felt like the tenderness and taste were compromised by the next day ... so I would definitely suggest making it the day you plan to serve it.

Think of the most delicious fruit dessert you've ever had and multiply by a factor of infinity. I kid you not, this Sour Cream Peach Kuchen is heavenly!  My mom used to make a similar recipe whenever we were having VERY special company over for dinner and so I was thrilled to find this version here. She always served it quite warm, usually baking it while we were eating dinner. When I made this the other night for dessert,  I served it to my family 30 minutes after removing it from the oven and it was perfect. I usually like my fruit desserts very cold but this is the only one I prefer warm/reheated. I think it's because the custardy topping loses much of its flavor and creaminess when cold.  I made this recipe exactly as specified and I can't think of a single thing I'd change. And btw, my husband refuses to eat all fruit desserts (except his mom's Apple Betty recipe) and so he was very suspicious of this one but grudgingly admitted that he thought it was delicious. He even had a second piece the next day!

I lost my favorite version of this recipe, and although it was VERY good, it just wasn't the same as my old one.  I will make it again though.

We actually didn't care for this. I mean it was fine, but IMO nothing special. My son thought it tasted eggy. Ended up throwing out 1/2 the pan after it sat in the fridge for a few days. Was disappointed, as all the other reviewers loved it so much!

Great recipe! I had never had kuchen before and my husband and I loved it. I made half the recipe in a 9x9 pan and it worked out perfectly.

I have made this cake several times now and each time I take it somewhere I am asked for the recipe.  It is a different twist on a peach dessert.  It is easy, nice looking and delicious!  This is a favorite in our household!  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm most sorry to say this, but this was a failure. It might just be a personal taste, thing, but it was just not sweet enough! The under layer of this recipe was more like a pie crust than what I like. The yogurt/sour cream layer was not sweet at all. I'm going back to using my recipe with the cake mix.

This didn't turn out well for me at all.  The crust was really dry and didn't hold together.  There weren't enough peaches which obviously was my fault but all together it just didn't work for me.  Sorry.

I'm a pretty darn good cook and baker, but this dessert just didn't do it for me. It sounded good and the only thing I changed was fresh peaches vs. canned. I also strained them but it turned out a bit watery still. I'm sure the sugar created that extra juice. The crust was good and after it sat for hours it seemed better but I wouldn't make it again.

This was easy to make and tasted great! Served it warm by itself after dinner today, but I think it would taste great with vanilla ice cream. I followed the suggested baking times but the crust ended up burning slightly, so next time I might try either reducing the baking time or lowering the temperature to 350F.

This turned out really well.  Peaches are in season, so I used fresh, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I served it at a dinner for friends and they loved it.

Tried this recipe today (5/30/10).  It is the most delicious peach dessert I have ever eaten.  No changes or additions are necessary.  My family went nut's for it.

So easy and so yummy! I loved the way the canned peaches tasted in this. I love the crust. I cut it in half, but made no other changes!

I made this poor recipe all wrong (shouldn'tve been on the phone while baking!) and put ALL the sugar into the crust, and hardly any in the peaches. It still came out tasty, but I will try the actual way soon!

This is a tasy treat.  I'd used a bit less flour in the crust, it seemed to be a tad too much.  Otherwise -wonderful and easy to make.

I've been making this for years and it's one of my favourites. The only time I've had it not turn out was when I accidentally bought low-fat sour cream and then it was just runny. It's best with 14%.

I used fresh peaches (about 6 cups like another reviewer and used real butter) and thought this was excellent! My family loved it!! The crust was shortbread/pie crust texture and it's not too sweet. Will definitely be making this again!
