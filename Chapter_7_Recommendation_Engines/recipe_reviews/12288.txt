Excellent. I did make the following changes: I used about 7 or 8 c of wild blackberries, because I love blackberries. I used about 2/3 c of sugar, because I always eat blackberry pie with ice cream and I wanted it to be a little tart. And, I didn't put anything on the crust because I didn't have an egg. Everyone loved it. It was a little runny, probably due to the extra berries. The extra juice can be spooned over the accompanying ice cream. Ahhh... life is good.

Mmmmmm ... delicious!  A few suggestions, though: I used only 1 cup of sugar instead of the extra half, because I like a little ice cream on my pie and that makes up for the sugar.  Also, I used frozen blackberries instead of fresh (since it's winter), and I would make sure to use at least 5 cups if going this way.  Tapioca did the trick to keep it from being runny!  Will make this again!

I had used a different recipe last year during blackberry season and the pie boiled over in the oven and was extremely runny. THIS RECIPE WAS JUST RIGHT! Had the right thickness thanks to the tapioca. One thing I would recommend is using less blackberries, about 4 cups instead of 4.5 since I couldn't fill the pie with all the mix. I brought the pie to work and everyone loved it! Simple and easy.

Wow!  This pie is really, really good.  I grown my own blackberries and used them in this recipe.  I used Minute tapioca in the recipe and it turned out wonderful.

The pie crust I used wasn't great but the filling was delicious!!! Make sure you put your pie on the bottom rack in the oven so it sets properly and the crust cooks correctly- mine didn't but even then it was still really good. Great recipe!!
