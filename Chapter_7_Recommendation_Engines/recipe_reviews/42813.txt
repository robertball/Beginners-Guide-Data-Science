The tanginess of the orange marmalade and the soy sauce was reminisced of the Orient.  What a delightful combination with the cilantro and the not too overpowering garlic flavour.  I found I had to cook the tenderloin on a low to moderate grill because the sugar in the marmalade caramelized too quickly.  We accompanied this recipe with fried sesame noodles.  The Tenderloin was very delicious!

The flavor was great, but I did things differently.  I spooned on the marmalade. Needed no where near 12 oz.  Then I sprinkled with garlic powder, soy sauce and ground ginger and then the chopped cilantro.  Is 1 1/2 cups soy sauce correct?  I used about 1/4 cup. I marinated for 3 hrs turning occasionally and then put on the grill.  It took alittle longer than 15 mins per side. But was yummy!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I used 2 small 10 oz pork tenderloins instead of thr larger roast(grilled them for about 4 minutes on each side for medium temp).  I also only made half of the marinade in the recipe, and used a large plastic ziploc bag instead of the shallow pan.  The meat came out much more flavorful that way.  The original amount of the marinade seemed excessive, even for 2 lbs of meat.  The last thing i did was make a glaze with 2 Tblspns of Orange Marmalade, 1 tspn of soy sauce,a handufl of chopped cilantro,  and half a clove of garlic finely minced.  I warmed the glaze in the microwave for thirty seconds and poured it over the meat while serving.  It came out great, will definitely have again.

We served this recipe at a dinner party for 15 guests.  The feeling was mutual.  This recipe is a winner!  Following the first reviewer's lead, we reduced the amount of marmalade, but it was still to much.  I will change the instructions to mix the marmalade, soy sauce, and garlic thoroughly prior to placing the meat in it.  The zip loc bag idea of one reviewer is a good approach.  We also added the glaze option, but omitted the garlic from this glace.  This mixture also became a good 'sauce' to keep the meat moist.  With these adds, it is great!  My family is already asking for it again!

This was really good...I served for hubby's friend who came for dinner.  Did use the grill pan and had to reduce the heat level because the natural sugars started to burn a little bit.  I cut the pork into medallions to stretch it out a bit.  I also decided to add just a little bit of grated fresh ginger to the marinade....thought it would work well, and it did.  I halved the marinade and reduced the second half on the stove to make a thick sauce...to pour on top of white rice and the finished pork.  Really good stuff...thanks for the post.

Thanks Katie this is a winner!  As others have suggested, we also kept the BBQ on a low heat to prevent the marmelade scorching.  We have made this a few times already using both tenderloin and pork chops.

We used this recipe for pork chops vs. pork tenderloins - it had a great flavor on the grill.

Messed a bit with the amounts because I had a small tenderloin.  Sliced into medallions and marinated. Heated  grill to a high heat, and turned it low when I put it on the meat on the grill.

Great recipe.  I used much less marinade, just eyeballed the amounts and mixed it in a ziploc.  Grilled on medium.  Delicious!

After reading the other reviews, I made quite a few changes. I used only 1 cup of soy sauce, added 1/2 tsp bottled minced ginger, and then I baked it (low and slow to avoid burning the marinade) under aluminum foil for 30 minutes at 350F, removed foil and inserted a digital thermometer, and finished cooking to 165F. Meanwhile, I poured the excess marinade in a sauce pan, added 1/4 cup chinese rice wine, and boiled for 5 minutes for safety, then simmered while the pork cooked. The reduced sauce ended up the best part of the meal!

I froze meat+marinade (only used half the marmalade) together in a ziploc bag weeks ago, then let it defrost/marinate for 2 days.  We liked the flavor - didn't need to add any further spices at the table (which is rare).  Used dried cilantro.
