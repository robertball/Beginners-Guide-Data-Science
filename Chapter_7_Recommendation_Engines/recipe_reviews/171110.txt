A nice hearty soup for a rainy day. One word of caution if you're a beginner like me: My parsnip yielded more than one cup but I thought what the heck, don't be wasteful... wrong! It really overpowered the rest of the flavors. After adding more of everything else to balance it out, it turned out to be quite a good vegetarian dish.

A great, easy, healthy soup! I doubled the amount of pumpkin puree so i could empty my large can. It wasn't too pumpkin-y. To add some variety to my lunch-time soup later in the week, I added some black beans and salsa, mixed, reheated and enjoyed. It was yummy!

I love this soup. Great on a cold rainy day.   I add cayenne pepper to bowl right before serving and it adds a nice heat profile.   Also, for the garnish, i like to put the parsley, garlic, cilantro in the food processor and make a pesto out of it. I find it intensifies the flavors of the garnish.

The first day I made this, I thought it was bland and not at all what I expected. I added cumin, crushed red pepper, and tons of black pepper, and still nothing. It sat uneaten in my fridge for three days until I decided to take it to work for lunch... I added a little curry powder and BAMMMMM!!!  GREATEST. SOUP. EVER.  Needs a lot more spice, a few days to sit, and then this is an incredible recipe! Thanks!

Very good soup!  I also added the whole can of pumpkin (what do you do with the other half anyway?) and three good shakes of cayenne.  I also only had chicken stock on hand and it worked well.  Add some good bread and it's perfect for a chilly Fall day. Oh, and an immersion blender is one of the best purchases I've ever made.  Buy one!

Fantastic!!!  Both my husband and I LOVED it.  I pretty much followed the recipe using a supermarket pack of 2 carrots, 1 big parsnip, 1/2 a small leek, 1 small celery stick, 1 small turnip, a lot of parsley, and 1 sprig of dill.  I added 1/2 a sweet onion.  I sauteed everything but the herbs in olive oil for a few minutes before adding the pumpkin (1/2 a can) and the vegetable stock.  I added salt, pepper, and dried cilantro to taste and simmered for about 45-50 min. covered.  I then blended with an emersion blender.  I made the garnish separately and included the dill, which I had also chopped.  I eyeballed the paprika and probably used much more than 1/8 tsp.  Instead of adding the garnish to our bowls, I added it into the soup since we ate 1/2 of it and will have the rest another day.  I will definitely be making this soup again and again.  It is very warming and filling so it is great for winter.  I recommend the recipe highly.

This is definitely one of the best soup recipes I have made so far. There are so many interesting flavors, and just delicious overall. Also, it helps me get some servings of veggies which is also a plus! However, I used an entire can of pumpkin puree as some of the reviews had said, since, there really isn't much you can do with half a can of pumpkin. I did not believe the pumpkin overpowered any of the other ingredients, and actually preferred the extra pumpkin taste.

When I think of Moroccan food, it includes warm earthy spices, such as curry, cinnamon and clove.  The way the recipe is written, provides a good base for a soup that needs a little doctoring.

Expected to like this more than I actually did. Tasted pretty good but I got tired of it quickly. Husband not keen either. This was ok but I wouldn't make it again. Thanks anyway!

Tip- If you don't like butternut squash soup or carrot soup, you will NOT like this recipe.  

The soup was simple to make but between the pumpkin and the carrots it was overwhelmingly sweet, for my taste.  

I added cumin, coriander, curry powder, cayenne pepper, and cilantro and I still thought it was too sweet and too bland.

This was a really delicious soup! Better than I expected!
I used fresh pumpkin - softened and then pureed. I added fresh cilantro to it and pureed that too (in addition to the dried). 
However, forgot to puree the carrots - oops, although I don't think it mattered at all.
I also added paprika and turmeric to the main soup (after one reviewer's comments about adding more spice). As I said it was really delicious, and I loved the lemon juice flavor - I added a bit more than recommended. Next time I'll double the recipe to make more for my family as the kids happily ate it too.

This is a good base recipe, but it definitely needed more flavor, IMO.  I added plenty of cayenne and cinnamon, along with a some cumin and curry powder (as another reviewer mentioned doing), and that was a significant improvement.  I really liked the garnish, and I appreciated how easy this was to put together.  I love pumpkin soup, and this recipe is a a very good starting point. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious.  Tasted as per recipe, liked it, but we like more heat so I followed another's suggestion and added some adobo.  Made the lamb kabobs recipe on this site into meatballs and placed one large into each bowl.  Great contrast with the sweet and spicy.  Will definitely make again, and again, and again.

Thanks for the recipe!

great recipe! I used real pumpkin puree instead of canned and had fresh dill in the fridge therefore added some to soup after it was finished simmering.  Everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe and thought I would freeze but didn't make it to the freezer lol  Thank u for sharing this recipe.   I've never cooked with parsnip and look forward to again

This was really good. Instead of making the garnish I put the garnish ingredients directly in the soup (to taste), which gave it a good flavor. I also used extra vegetables which worked out fine but I think it made the soup thicker than it would have been otherwise.

So easy! So delicious! I added the garnish ingredients into the recipe, and instead garnished with a swirl of Ceylon cinnamon. My husband loved it and I loved the opportunity to use my immersion blender for the first time. I have to say, the lemon juice is marvelous; it really makes a difference! Next time I might garnish with pine nuts. This recipe is great as is and also is great as a jumping off place. OH, as others said, I used the whole can, but I can see using half and then using the rest for another soup! Or to make a dip or spread or something else wonderful. (Spread it on chicken parts with za'atar and sliced olives? Who knows? Use your imagination!)

Having never tasted a "winter soup" I was quite excited to try this...but it appears neither my husband or I are in the fan category here. The consistency was one factor, with overall flavor another (a little bland, even with addition of Ancho chili powder).

My husband came home starving after a long day, had some of this soup, and said it warmed his tummy. It really hit the spot in his words. He liked it so much he went out and bought me more ingredients to make it for Christmas. Lol, I love it myself. It is so healthy and filling. I would recommend this to everyone. Thank you so much!
