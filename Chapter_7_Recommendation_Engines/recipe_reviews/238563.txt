My husband loves baked beans, so, I thought I would give this easy recipe a try.   It seemed liked 3/4 of a cup was quite a bit of brown sugar for this recipe, so, I started with 1/2 cup and that was plenty sweet for our taste.  I thought the bacon made the beans a little greasy and personally we didn't like the texture of the bacon mixed into the beans. It was a little too soft and chewy.  We prefer the bacon put on top of the beans, so, it gets a little crisp. The BBQ sauce did give the beans a nice tang though!  Great idea!

I only cooked my beans an hour and a half. I donâ€™t like my beans real dry. They turned our delicious!

Instead of 2 cans of pork n' beans, I used  3 cans. I also used a 1/3 cup of light brown sugar along with the mustard & ketchup. My son, who loves KFC's baked beans, loved these just as much. They were a big hit on Xmas.
