This was good! Loved the flavor!
Changes I made this time: Used apple cider vinegar, cut down the sugar by one TBSP (personal taste), added baking soda to the water for the broccoli to really bring out the green, used craisins instead of raisins. (It's what I had on hand!)
Next time I would- Not cook the broccoli! (More nutrition and more crunch raw!) 
Thanks for a great recipe! I'll make it again!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used fat-free mayo, reduced the sugar by about half, and added a few extra pepper flakes and it turned out great. I love the contrast of the creamy dressing with the spicy pepper flakes! I will make this again!

A favorite at our rehearsal dinner for my sons wedding. Small changes ... Grated the carrots, added small dice sweet red pepper 1/4 c, 1/4 mayo and 1/4 cup Greek yogurt.  Did cook for one minute with 1/2 tsp baking soda, after putting in strainer, dunked in ice water and then on to paper towels two times to get as much water off ofthe broccoli as possible.  Didn't add any salt as I used roasted salted sunflower seeds. Rest of ingredients were the same.  Easy would do again

I was looking for a new garbanzo salad recipe that also had broccoli and stumbled upon this one.  I changed ingredients up a bit - for the dressing, used 2 tbsp cider vinegar and 2 tbsp mayo with 1 tsp table sugar and a few drops of liquid stevia.  I grated the carrot, and used fresh broccoli blanched in the microwave.  I was not inspired to use any kind of herb or spice so I didn't doctor it at all in that way, using only salt and pepper.  The non-spiced flavors of all the ingredients were good, but it was missing something.  Maybe Rock_Lobster, or someone else, will try it and offer suggestions?  Maybe I'll be inspired myself when I have the rest for lunch today!  Thanks for the recipe to try.

Used dried cranberries instead of the raisins, and added pepitas. Yummy!

This was really good and a different way to use broccoli, but I couldn't  see cooking the broccoli, even a little bit, if it's considered a slaw,  so I used raw broccoli. Other changes included swapping dried cranberries for raisins, cutting the sugar in half, and replacing white vinegar with apple cider vinegar, and replaced sunflower seeds with pepitas since I already had them on hand.Tasty. Would make again.

I grated some cabbage in there as well; and my SO told me that this was better than the broccoli slaw we had at the Longwood Gardens barbeque .  That was an amazing compliment; my thanks to the cook who shared it.

We enjoyed this salad, for many days.  I doubled the recipe as I didn't want a half can of garbanzo beans left in the fridge.  I made as written in the morning and we had it for supper.  We also had this in lunches for a few days, and it held up really well. The night I made it, it was served with 'Barbecued Pork Kebabs' and 'Brazilian Grilled Pineapple' both recipes from AR.  Thanks Rock_lobster, for sharing your recipe.

I made this for 10 servings.  I added baking soda to water to make the broccoli brighter as another reviewer suggested.  This is a new trick for me!  I plumped up the raisins in hot water, then drained them before adding to veggies.  I used low fat and regular mayo in 50/50 ratio to lower the fat a little.  I substituted roasted pine nuts because I had them on hand.  This is wonderful and I am going to use THIS sauce for my cole slaw in the future.

Tasty sweet/tangy dressing that stretched farther than for 2.5c of broccoli (could easily double the amount of broccoli). I did NOT cook the broccoli. I used pepitas, pine nuts, and craisins in lieu of the sunflower seeds and raisins (it's what I had on hand). No garbanzos as they weren't in the house. Also used apple cider vinegar. I might use slightly less vinegar and sugar next time. But only slightly; it's delicious as written.

I'll definitely make it again! (Over and over!)

Liked the combination of seeds, broccoli, carrots and raisins, but did not like dressing.

Great recipe but as a diabetic I made some changes.  I use mayo made with olive oil, white wine vinegar and Stevia leaf drops (1 cup mayo, 1 tsp liquid stevia and 2 tbsp. white wine vinegar).

Very very good!  I threw this together quickly for a side dish for dinner last night.  It didn't get to cool for an hour in the fridge, but it was still tasty!  The dressing is still a little runny after sitting in the fridge overnight, so I might try to find a way to thicken it up a bit.
