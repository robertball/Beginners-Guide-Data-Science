I didn't have any onion dip so I added sour cream and green onions instead.  Then of course butter, and lots of shredded chedder.  I piped the mixture back into the skins then sprinkled a bit of paprika over each one.  Beautiful and delicious!

Awesome and if you don't have the prepared dip, use one 500 ml (16 0z) tub of light sour cream and one pkg. of onion soup mix, let sit to absorb flavors and add cheese.  Great and really hold the heat.

My husband loved them too. I never would have though about using onion dip but it wouldn't have been nearly as good without it! Great recipe!

I served this dish and only 1 person ate the whole potato.  Most just picked at it.  Too strong of an onion taste, too much cheese.  I love all the ingredients in this recipe, but I was very disappointed, and won't be making this again.

This tasted SO good! It does make a ton of filling though. I had to pile it on top of the hollowed out potato and still had a bit left over. I didn't put it all on because I thought the filling would get melty and make a mess, but it didn't. So next time, I'll just pile it all on =) Also, I first baked my potatoes in the microwave, and then put them in the oven for the second cooking. It worked perfectly fine, and cut the cooking time in half.

The recipe will be wonderful I'm sure, but photo number one should probably be replaced with a better one. That's not so appetising I'm afraid.

Nice idea but the wrong flavor profile for baked potaotes. There is a reason why butter, sour cream, cheddar cheese and chives cannot be improved on, and this is not an improvement.

These were good; I liked them more than my husband did. I added pepper. I will make them again, but probably use sour cream and my own seasonings, to cut down on the sodium.

Good recipe, but I usually do the old fashioned one with butter, sour cream, chives and bacon. When I have done this one, I have used the garden vegetable soft cream cheese, which is a little "milder" than the onion dip  but gives a similar taste. I agree with someone else, "take a new picture!!"

I used fat-free sour cream, but I wish I would have used low-fat instead.  These were still yummy, but I think they would have been better with low-fat (or of COURSE full fat) sour cream.  Rather than mixing in cheese as the recipe calls for, I topped my potatoes with broccoli, sliced turkey, and cheese sauce.  Really really yummy - I will make again.

I use very large baking potatoes, micro wave them, then cut them in half, and stuff both halves. There's plenty filling to pile it up and it's a much more reasonable portion as a side dish. Wish I had a picture to submit, that photo on the recipe is absolutely gross!!!!!

I'm not sure where I messed up, but when I scooped out the flesh, I ended up with potato scoops that were really hard to mash up, so I ended up sort of making a scalloped potato in potato skins.  It did taste delicious though.  I added some ranch and some extra spices (like paprika).  It tasted good, but it wasn't a soft stuffed potato like I'd wanted.

Much better if you stir fry bacon and onion first, then add that to the mashed potato, along with seasonings. Grate  some strong cheese (I use cheddar), chop up a tomato and mix these together with some paprica and spread on top of the already filled potatoes and pop under the grill for a few minutes.

Sounds yummy - haven't tried it yet, but I would rather add my own onions and a low-fat sour cream.  Definitely wouldn't use onion soup mix as it is full of sodium.  I also would use 1/2 potato per person.   I probably would try Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I'm pre-diabetic so have to watch calories & carbs.

I have not baked a potato since the microwave was invented. This worked out fine in the micro, but I also added bacon bits to the mix.

I founf this reciepe when.looking to use up some large russet potatoes I had before they went bad...I made this reciepe into a FULL MEAL by adding ground beef chopped onions and mushrooms to the cheddar cheese and sour cream and onion mix. They turned out great!! Everyone loved them and there is a lot of mix left over so it was so good we added mote mix to the hollow potatoes once we ate the first servings out of the potatoes!! Will def make this again!!!

This was very good and a little different from the usual twice baked potato by using the french onion dip. I did end up having to add a little milk to the mixture to get a bit more of a mashed potato consistency before stuffing back into the potato shells. We dipped the tops in a bread crumb & shredded cheddar mixture to give these a little extra crunch factor.

Super yummy! I also added bacon bits, cheddar cheese and chives to the sour cream mixture and it came out so good. I rubbed the potatoes with a little olive oil and kosher salt to make the skin a little toastier. I found it easier to cut the potatoes in half and then refill them instead of trying to scoop it out from the top. Everybody loved them and I will make them again.

I served this dish at a family get together, most everyone picked at the potato, didn't care for the onion/sourcream dip.  Honestly I didn't either.  Won't fix ths dish again.

OMG. This were out of this world amazing. I loved them. Difference for next time would only be to make my dip the night before and let it meld together better. With the cheese I did split it up and use half cheddar and half blue cheese (had it in the fridge and didn't want it to go bad) they just knocked them out of the park

I had some sour cream and onion dip left over from a picnic I had attended. I was thrilled to be able to use it in a completely different way! This is a delicious recipe even though I changed the type cheese I used. Lots of wiggle room here for variations.

The family LOVED it. I added a bit of chopped turkey breast quickly fried for a few minutes in the mix and they asked for more. Best stuffed potato recipe ever. And I'm not into potatoes.

The problem for me with baked potatoes, (and really what husband doesn't love them!!) is the time involved.  Even with microwaving this just takes too long. I'll save this idea for weekends. :P

This is by far the best! I found that a half of a large potatoe was enough for each serving. No need to have extra sour cream on the side. I did have chopped green onion to sprinkle over just for color. Leftovers for breakfast were yummy!

Easy to make and plenty to go around. It is very filling so you can figure this to be the main attraction. Goes good with cottage cheese.

Didn't have onion dip but made my own with sour cream and dried French onion soup.  I didn't think it had too much onion as some of the reviews said.  But again, we like meals with flavor. The whole family gobbled it up!

Used sour cream and ranch salad dip ... Blended that morning to make sure it all combined.  Added some left over chicken and 2 T of milk and 2 T of Frank's Hot Sauce.  Put it all together and topped with partial cooked bacon.

I followed the recipe exactly as posted and my daughter (who considers herself a potato connoisseur) wanted me to make more that very night!  The only reason I'm not adding the 5th star is because the potato mixture could use some seasonings before completing.

Recipe was perfect...the only thing I did different was bake potatoes for 1 hr. instead of 45 min.  Perfect texture! Most people at 1 1/2 halves!

I would just suggest that BEFORE you bake the potatoes, Grease or OIL the skins as they will form a better "bowl" to be refilled. Also (simply because "I LIKE" sliced Black Olives, Crumbled Bacon, -your favorite "tater-toppings"), I have VARRIED this Recipe to include those in MINE.
These make a "Meal" in itself.. just add Salad.

Very good. Lots of extra "stuffing" left over! Also, very easy to make.
