I've been making this cake for over 20 years and it's still the family favorite compared to any other pound cake. I don't usually have canned milk around the house and have substituted regular milk and even sour cream. It all works and it's all good. The butternut flavor gets better after a few days and this cake freezes beautifully.

I printed this recipe to bake cake and after the cake is in the oven I checked to print copy for friend and discovered the note (which doesn't show on printed copy)the cake should start in a cold oven.  My cake is in the oven and don't know how it will be by starting with hot oven.  Sue

Purchased butternut extract from King Arthur Flour on line, and it's delicious. This cake has the finest texture I've ever seen. I baked it Dec. 2010, and am just finishing up the last of it after having been frozen that long. The texture and taste are better than ever (vacuum sealed, which may have helped). Butterscotch Ice Cream Topping from this site pairs beautifully.

My family has made a similar cake for as long as I can remember.  It's definitely one of our favorites.  We use Superior brand Vanilla, Butter and Nut flavoring which gives the cake a beautiful yellow color.  It used to be available in the grocery store, but we've had trouble finding it for years.  I finally found it online at http://www.shopbettys.com/detail.aspx?ID=33

Enjoy!

I used 2 sticks butter and 1/2 Cup Crisco, 3 cups sugar, 1 small can of evaporated milk with water added to make 1 cup, and 1 tablespoon of Superior brand Vanilla Butter & Nut Flavoring. Been a recipe I've used for 40 years. I often use Land O Lakes margarine and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. I have put it into a cold oven but prefer to preheat oven to 325 and bake 1 hour and 15-30 minutes. Needs no garnish.
