Oh so tasty and lovely! I broke the yolk on one (which I served myself) and even it was delicious, though not as visually pleasing. I followed the recipe to a T and it did not disappoint.

Honestly tasted very good. Similar to a chowder.  A simple and well presented meal.

This was the first time I've ever had anything like this and I thought it was absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was I seasoned mine with sea salt and mrs. Dash because I love it on absolutely everything! I was pleasantly surprised to find this tasted similar to clam chowder to me,which I love, and I'm glad to know how to make something tasty like this that does not come out of a can!

I didnâ€™t have smoked salmon or cream.  So I substituted with grilled salmon and a non dairy milk.  It was quite good with these changes.  However, I will try it again with the actual ingredients.
