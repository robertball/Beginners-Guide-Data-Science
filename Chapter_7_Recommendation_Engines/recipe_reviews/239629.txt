Very good. There is an error in the recipe, though. It calls for 1 (3 oz) package of cream cheese and it should be 8 oz. Almost too much frosting...and I love frosting!  Next time I make it I'll make smaller rolls and use 1/2 the frosting.  Great way to use squash!

These were deliciously amazing, I cut the recipe in half and still got 9 big rolls.  I baked a butternut squash a few months ago and scooped out the flesh and froze it. I used about 3/4 cup of this (thawed) for my half recipe.  I also let dough rise about 3 hours the first time and 2 hours after I made it into rolls but I'm sure it didn't need that long, I just got busy.  Hubby said these were the best cinnamon rolls I've made so far.

It probably isn't fair for me to rate this, since I made some changes. But they came out so good that I wanted to encourage others to try this recipe. I used canned pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon (family's preference). We omitted the frosting since we thought it was sweet and delicious enough without it. 

I did have some issues with the dough. It is important to note that I used a gluten free flour instead of regular. Usually, my blend converts to wheat flour recipes pretty well, but my dough problems are likely related to my flour. My dough was so soft that I couldn't work it. I wound up letting it rise, laying it out, refrigerating it to get it to roll, then cutting it and letting it rise extra long before baking. But it came out fab none-the-less.
