The first change I made was, instead of using the bouillon and the 1 cup of water called for in the sauce recipe,  I replaced it with 1 cup of the left over liquid from cooking the chicken. 
I don't think it would of made any difference in the taste, except for the salt.  
The second change I made was, instead of rolling the filling into the corn tortilla's, I laid the corn tortilla's out flat in the greased 9 x 13 casserole dish,  I added the filling, then topped the filling with another layer of corn tortilla's.

Very yummy dish.  Didn't have the green chiles on hand, but will definitely add those next time to give the dish a little zip.

Pretty good but bland. Needed more cumin. I thought the filling was dry too. Next time I will put some sauce in with meat mixture. I did double the sauce and it was needed. Husband added lots of hot sauce and said it was ok.

Theses are EASILY the BEST chicken enchiladas I've ever had.  I was a little skeptical of the Greek yogurt but...WOW!  This is the only enchilada recipe I'll ever need.  Thanks for sharing!

As with another enchilada dish I make, I always add fresh cilantro to the chicken mix and overtop the finished product.  I also put some fresh sliced jalapenos atop prior to baking.

FIRE!

I cooked the chicken in a crockpot and then added the green chilis and some fresh jalapenos. I also doubled the amount of sauce. The recipe was very easy and tasted great.
