I doubled the pesto and olive oil and added garlic (2 cloves). Also added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and some Mrs Dash tomato basil garlic to liven it up a bit. Served with chicken apple sausage. My hubby said this was a definate keeper.

This pasta is absolutely delicious!  I did double the olive oil, pesto and onions.  For a kick, I sauteed some garlic in the olive oil before adding the onions and pesto.  Also, I crumbled some bacon on top of the dish for a little bit of a crunch.
Perfection.

This was good but a bit dry. I sauted the onions to sweeten them up and then added some chopped sun dried tomatoes in olive oil.  I added the pesto to that mixture for just long enough to get it heated through when the pasta was finished.  We added some extra pesto as it was dry. A extra sprinkle of parmesan and we never missed meat.  I never would have thought of adding sauted onions to pesto pasta but it was very good.  This will be made again.

I made this according to instructions, and while a good basic pesto pasta recipe, there was something missing.  After the onion/pesto mixture cooked, I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and a 14.5 ounce can of petite diced tomatoes, heating another 5 minutes.  I then added the pasta to the pan and mixed well, serving right out of the frying pan.  This added the 'it' factor I was looking for.

wow this was such a hit with the family!  I was worried that they would not like a dinner without meat!  The only change was that I added some red pepper flakes.  Yum- we will have regularly!!

Very nice. Pasta was a bit dry. But other than that. It was awesome. I added some Cherry Tomatoes...mainly because I love them.

This was good! I would recommend adding Feta Cheese instead of the Parmesean. It was delicious with Feta.

I tried to make this a little healthier by omitting the extra olive oil.  The pasta was way too dry.  I added about 1/4 cup olive oil to make it taste great.

This is another one of my favorite, most often used recipes.  Based on other reviews I make the following modifications:  Saute chopped onion (between 1/2 and whole onion) and 3 cloves of minced garlic in olive oil first.  Add sun dried tomatoes, sometimes chopped black olives, then the pesto, which i up to 3 or 4 TB.  I also add a couple healthy pinches of red pepper flakes (most important!) and add the parmesan just before serving.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Great! For 2, the recipe was perfect. I added a pinch of red pepper as suggested by another reviewer(s). My husband likes "simple" tasting meals & this fits perfectly. I used a pre-made pesto, "Cibo Naturals Pesto": fast, easy, lovely.

Simple, easy, yummy!  Used not quite as much onion, gluten free brown rice pasta and Buittoni pesto.  Absolutely fabulous.

This was really great.  I went with a whole onion, 3-4 T. of pesto, and about 4 T. of butter (since I was out of olive oil).  The onion really made the dish.  It was just perfect.

This is tasty. As others mentioned, it's too dry. I added mushrooms, cream cheese, and a little plain yogurt and 1/2&1/2. It was still rather dry, but the pesto flavor is excellent. A great addition to my lunchbox for work!

We loved this pasta!  I used fresh fettucine noodles, (only 12 oz.).  I also added two cloves of crushed garlic since we love garlic.  I will make this again.

I am an onion person, so I used 3 large onions, and 1/4 cup of pesto, with whole wheat rotini.  Very tasty!  I can make up a pot of this and have dinner all week.

This was very yummy! It was quick and easy too, which is always a plus! I thought it was great even without the parmesan cheese. Can't really mess this one up.

I added garlic to the onions and sauteed them in olive oil before I added the pesto. I also added crushed red pepper in addition to salt and pepper. I can't eat dairy so no cheese. First few bites I thought it was meh, but I've just filled my bowl again. It is very yummy and I will likely make it again!

Easy to make and very good.  I did my own modification which came out beautifully-I added feta as suggested, and black olives.  But also added in sun dried tomatoes with a little of the olive oil the come in.   I used knorrs basic pesto (not the creamy) as my base.   A little salt/pepper, italian seasoning and voila!

This was pretty good.  I added much more pesto then the recipe called for.  I think that is was good.  I added sun dried tomatoes (I put them into the frying pan also) and those made a BIG difference.  There is no need for an entire box of pasta. Plus, I used some butter.  (Without it is was REALLY dry.)   All in all, really good.

This was really quite good, and simple for one of those nights you really do not have a clue as to what to make for dinner!  I did use 4 TBLS of pesto to cover the noodles a bit better.  The idea from another cook to add feta sounds like a good plan, too.

This probably sounds nuts, but I didn't have green pesto, I had red pesto. So, I used that instead. I also omitted the onions. It was very good!!!

Great and simple. :) I didn't have any onions (which was ok w/ me cuz I hate chopping them) and I doubled the oil and the pesto. My 3 yr. old niece loved it and she's a picky eater. I'll definitely make it again! :)

I made this yesterday and I found that it was not all that flavorful. Like other commentators have said, we added more pesto, and we also added a few garlic cloves. However, the finished result, while appetizing in appearance, was a bit bland. When we sprinkled some garlic salt on top, however, it definitely improved it.

I'll probably make this again, but next time with more garlic, more basil, and garlic salt instead of regular salt.

Giving this 4 stars, because I added quite a bit to it based on suggestions. We LOVED the way it turned out - I give the final product 5 stars. I cut up some chicken and marinated it in italian dressing, then cooked it with the onions. Then added the garlic. While the pasta was cooking (I used wheat linguine), I added half of an 8 oz. jar of pesto, as well as chopped black olives and sliced sundried tomatoes. Tossed with the linguine and parmesan and it was delicious.

Good basic pesto pasta recipe but like many said, a bit bland. After following the initial recipe, I added more pesto a bit of cream.  Suggest veggies or meat of your choice.

Super simple recipe.  I made this last night and I added some roasted pine nuts and increased the oil and Pesto.  I used Brown Rice Pasta and the dish really worked.

I made the recipe as is and it was completely dry.  I wound up adding the whole jar of pesto (8oz) and that made it decent.  It was very bland, though.  My kids did like it, but DH and I found it tolerable.

I think I used too much pasta because mine came out dry & not very green.  I love the cheese, didn't like the onions but my mate did.  I'll definitely try again without the onion & less pasta or more pesto.

I didn't enjoy this dish as much as I thought I would.  I made only four servings but doubled up on parmesean and pesto along with some garlic for more taste however I still found it to be somewhat bland.  It tasted a little better the next day when I warmed it up but I won't be making this again.

I think we could have this 8 or 9 days a week!  I added some green & red bell peppers with the onion.  For those who found this dry,  save a half a cup or so of your pasta water before you drain the pasta.  Then add it back in a little at a time until it's moist enough.  Something about the starchy water does the trick.

First, the success of this recipe depends highly on what kind of pesto you're using.  Second, you can vary this one a lot according to your tastes. I added a little fresh jalepeno to give it a slight tinge. I also added a little fresh minced garlic.  Works well if you strain, then toss it lightly in the frying pan with the pesto mixture.

An excellent base recipe that you can tweak to suit taste. I used half a dip tub of pesto dip and a half tub of spinach ricotta dip that had been sitting in the fridge for a while, which I wanted to use up. Added a couple of cloves of garlic to saute with the onion. Saved some of the hot water that was used to boil the pasta and added it to the sauce to thicken it up. Cooked up some diced bacon and breadcrumbs to crispness and used as topping on the pasta. Delish with a bottle of white wine!

It was good, only I thought it did not need more olive oil since there is enough of that in the Pesto.  I think I will try creaminstead of extra olive oil, like someone else suggested.

This recipe came out great BUT I changed it up a bit.  I added red, yellow and orange bell peppers, chopped, and asparagus to the onion and pesto mixture.  I used angel hair pasta. It came out really good, a nice, light, meal, but I think without the extra veggies it would have been kind of dull.  I will definitely make this again, with whatever veggies are in season.

I followed the recipe to a "T" & it was SO bland!
Neither my husband or I like it.
Since it was so bland, I added a little bit of garlic powder & mixed it up in our pasta, and that didn't seem to matter much either.

I like to make homemade pesto.. I have been making pizzas and pasta with it and just wanted ideas to make it even better.  I used a diced homegrown tomatoe and a sliced banana pepper in it this time.. 
I love the reviewers idea of adding hot pepper flakes! Next time I'll add that and sauteed onions. 
 Thanks!

I doubled (or maybe tripled, TBH) the pesto, and added chopped garlic. The garlic really enhanced the flavor.  After it cooked a bit it was quite dry, so I stirred in about 1/4 cup water and it made it perfect.

It was a big hit with my family, and since it was so easy, I'll definitely make it again.

This is a huge winner. And versatile too. I can imagine adding grilled chicken or shrimp for an even heartier meal. I used the  Pesto recipe available on the allrecipes website and it was an excellent choice. So good! I suppose it's a matter of personal preference, but I used well over a cup of pesto rather than the 2 1/2 tablespoons called for in the recipe. I like a heartier taste and intuitively, I knew that such a small amount of pesto would not be enough. I was concerned about deviating so much on the amount of pesto, but I have absolutely no regrets. It came out  spectacularly. I dropped a pinch or two of red pepper flakes into the recipe and it was perfect. Rather than making it spicy hot, it was just enough to add a very slight curious bite.

I doubled the pesto and used a pasta that the pesto really stuck to. I used one of the pesto recipes and made it from the plants we've been growing this spring. Love this recipe.

I added one cooked chicken breast sliced in strips and added it into the pesto mixture before tossing it into the pasta (I used whole wheat angel hair) and I added 1 Tbsp more of pesto and 2 cloves of garlic. So yummy the chicken really makes the dish delicious!

This was quite tasty and is a nice, fresh tasting pasta that makes for an easy weeknight dinner! I doubled the sauce as recommended in other comments.  I served this with rustic bread and vegetables on the side.  I would make this again.

I made this last night and it was yummy!  

I used spinach pasta and based on other comments I doubled the pesto and olive oil.  It was really good.

I got rave reviews on this one. Very tasty. I did double everything except the pasta and I didn't even use all 16 oz. Like other reviews I added 2 cloves of garlic and a bit of chicken broth. I used gluten free pasta which may be why it needed the extra moisture. This is going to show up in my house frequently!

Wished could give this 10 stars!  Followed the recipe exactly only with doubling the amount of pesto & chopped onions.  Served it with baked pesto chicken.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with us all.

I sauteéd garlic and onion first, then lightly cooked artichoke quarters, broccoli and mushrooms in the same pan. Then, I added 3 TBS of ready-made pesto sauce. I added olive oil w/ freshly grated parmesan cheese to the pasta before mixing it all together--it was delicious, especially as leftovers the next day!

Never cook pesto. It will go from fresh and bright and green, to brown, bland and blech. Also, should use way more pesto than that, at least half a cup to a cup for a pound of pasta or it will be dry and flavorless. I make my pesto from scratch every summer from my garden, put it in jars, cover with a layer of olive oil and put it in the fridge. Good all year round that way

It was OK. It was easy to prepare since I had most of the ingredients readily available. However, I thought it lack flavour so I added  a few dashes of my Badia All Seasoning mix and threw a few mushrooms in the mix. Very easy to make, enjoy!

This is PDG (Pretty Damned Good).  Double oil and pesto.  Add some garlic. Try feta cheese instead of parma.  Fast and easy too.  I threw in some diced Pancetta and that boosted it to a 5.

We used homemade pesto made from parsley.  We used a bigger scoop of pesto.  We used 4 T olive oil. We added a half teaspoon chicken bouillon, a half cup pasta water, some fresh garlic cloves and a 1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes.  Then I added the pasta to the sauce and tossed in cheese.  Pretty tasty.  I liked the lesser pesto than we have been using in the past.  Because homemade pesto is an easy way to use up greens before they go bad, I bet we will do this again.

Quick and easy - just how I like a recipe when I get off of work and want to eat right away without spending a ton of time in the kitchen. This is a go-to base recipe to add any protein of your choice. I usually prefer sauteed shrimp with pesto, but chicken works as well.

This was my first time working with pesto and it turned out great! I added one clove of garlic and took advice from another member and put in half a cup of chicken stock in the pesto mixture. The flavor was subtle but delicious!

My whole family loves this recipe!  I followed the advice of a few reviewers and made the following adjustments: 1) I doubled the pesto sauce, 2) I added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the onions.  Also, I only cooked 12 oz. of spiral pasta.  It was the perfect amount and my family of 4 (2 little ones) gobbled the whole thing!  This was a super easy side dish that could go withere so many things.  I will definitely be making this again.

it was good, but a large box of pasta with just a little bit of pesto didnt give it much flavor. the onions helped. i added 3-4 more tbsp of pesto and a tbsp of garlic, still didnt give it the zing i needed. it was still alright and good for a healthy dinner

This was absolutely delicious! I added a few minced cloves of garlic and probably salted it more than some, but I like my pasta more towards the salty side. Home run!!

I agree to double the recipe and add some garlic with red pepper flakes.

This dish was very easy and yummy!  I followed the advice of others and doubled the olive oil and pesto.  I only made about 8oz of pasta.  Had I made the entire box it would have been too dry. I also added mushrooms and halved cherry tomatoes when cooking the sauce, and added grilled chicken  when tossing the sauce with the pasta.  I will be making this dish again.

Nice basic recipe, and I had all the ingredients (I do not use pine nuts in my pesto).  I used a 1/4 cup of each pesto, cheese, and onion because that is the portion sizes I keep in the freezer.   I chilled for 2 hours, but my DH said he liked the sample at room temperature better.  I used it as a side dish, and am saving the recipe to make again.  I will be even better with summer veggies added.

This was a really simple, quick, and tasty pasta recipe. I increased the amount of onion and added minced garlic to sauté. I used tomato pesto pasta since I had some left over from another recipe I made earlier. I increased the amount of pesto used for a more flavorful and creamier result.

This was a super simple recipe.  I used the Trader Joe's pesto in the jar, and added cherry tomatoes and basil tomato chicken sausage.  It was delicious and took about 20 mins total.  I will make this again!!

I had never cooked with pesto before, so I wanted to do something easy, plus I was looking for a side dish for tilapia (another new menu item). This worked out great! Thanks.

This was an alright recipe, I followed other people's advice and made more sauce than the recipe calls for but it still was just ok. It was very easy, however, so that was a plus. Thank you

This pasta did not taste bad, but it just did not have much taste. I followed the recipe exactly, and I am not known to be a bad cook, but it just did not come out very well. I won't make this again!

Excellent!  Added an extra tablespoon of pesto and tossed with high-fiber penne.  Served with a salad and pan-fried texas toast.  Yum, yum, YUM!

I made this recipe and really enjoyed the resulting dish.  I didn't have onions, but I added extra pesto and seasoning, plus I substituted Parmesan with Mozzarella (due to what I had in my fridge).  Delicious-o!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I added probably 4 T pesto sauce and another T of minced garlic.  After everything was cooked and mixed, I added probably 1 t Italian seasoning.  It definitely was not bland.

Good, basic pasta dish,  I did add more pesto.  Sauted onions with some fresh garlic before adding pesto (used cilantro pesto I had in freezer from this site)  Nice, easy side dish.

Great recipe! Quick to make and low in Weight Watchers points too! I used Red Pesto (with sundried tomatoes). Makes a great lunch, hot or cold!
