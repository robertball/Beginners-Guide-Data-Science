This one was really good...Here are some minor suggestions...we did not slice the sausage...we cut them up in chunks!! I also added some mushrooms as well...everyone really liked it!! I think that we will use this one at a church potluck sometime!! Thanks for the recipe...easy to make too!!

Loved the taste. Doesn't hurt to recruit help in slicing all the kielbasa and cheese.

Very easy to make, but no flavor, very ugly to present.  If you have left over veggies, and sausage you need to get rid of use this recipe otherwise skip it.  My family thought it was to cheesy, and sweet.  I followed the directions, since I am not experienced enough to tweak recipes.

The kids and husband loved it.  I thought it could do without the veggies, maybe use fresh veggies instead (like broccoli).  The cheese was awesome in it!

I like trying new recipes. I fixed this for our evening meal and my husband and I loved it. It is something I can fix on a minutes notice. Easy clean up.

Pretty good. Though next time I'll probably tweak it to my own taste. I'm not big on the processed cheese so next time I'll probably use half as much.

I made this for my kids and myself, I did change it a bit as I dont care for processed cheese. But we loved it and will make again!! Instead of the processed cheese I used campbells chedder cheese soup and then 3/4 can of milk. instead of mixed veggies I used steamfresh green beans still frozen. I also used shredded fiesta blend cheese about a cup. Mixed it all together placed in a casserole dish then toped with breadcrumbs! We will make it again and again!!

Quick and easy.  I liked it.  the only thing I will do differenly next time is add just the veggies I like.  I am not fond of everything in a can of mixed so I will make the veggies to my taste. Otherwise, very good.

I made this exactly as written, it was okay, but no real wow factor. I felt like I ate a bowl of melted cheese. If I was to make it again, I'd probably cut the amount of cheese in half.

I had not seen this recipe before I made it tonight. Worked all day, ran through the market gathering up pasta and Velvetta cheese.  Got home through it together, nuked it cuz the oven is Way to slow for hungry teenage boy and dad. Family friend shows up, they seem to Know when its dinner time huh? The whole group Loved it and were very happy! Btw, I used the ham leftover from New Years eve dinner. Thank you Crystal.

Ehh.  This was just average here.  I made a few variations, mostly in technique, nothing that would have much real effect on the recipe...and certainly none in a negative way.  I sauteed the sausage in a non-stick skillet before adding it to the pasta mixture.  I also used Mexican Velveeta, thinking it would be more flavorful (it wasn't).  I didn't bake this because there was no way I was turning on my oven today (but I do this sometimes with my tuna casserole).  I really don't feel that baking this would have changed the flavor that much.  I probably won't make this again unless my family specifically asks for it...which I doubt.  Thanks!
