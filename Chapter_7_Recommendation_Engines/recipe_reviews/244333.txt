We thought this was delicious!  I used a plain pork tenderloin as I couldn't find a seasoned one.  As a result, I sprinkled some mesquite applewood spice on the medallions before dipping them in the honey mustard mixture.  I was careful to only flip the medallions once as the coating didn't stick as well as it could have - perhaps I didn't have enough oil. Will definitely make it again!
