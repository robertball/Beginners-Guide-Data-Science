This sauce was so amazing, I joined the site just to share my experience. I love venison and thought this sauce would be good with game. I adjusted the recipe based on reviews others had given. Some said it was too sweet, so I used one tablespoon of brown sugar to three tablespoons of jam (I used seedless boysenberry preserves). Some complained that it was too watery, so I used one tablespoon of tomato paste in place of the tomato sauce. I also used a habenero hot sauce. I agree that the quantity was small, so if you are serving more than two people, or want leftovers, adjust accordingly.
I drizzled the sauce over Medallions of Venison Tenderloin (cooked rare/medium rare)served with garlic mashed potatoes and a good Cab for a true gourmet meal that was as good if not better than venison I've had at the fanciest restaurants. I would be proud to serve this to my most discerning guests. For leftovers to die for, try my “fancy cheese steaks”: spread sauce on a baguette, slice your leftover meat as thin as possible and top with caramelized onions (optional) and blue cheese crumbles.

Oh my.  As a rule, I don't buy commercial steak sauces; just don't like them.  After reading the reviews on this recipe, I prepared this sauce to go with two grilled steaks and I have to say that this is the BEST!!  I am fortunate to have some homemade raspberry jam in my refrigerator.  The combination of flavors is out of this world.  This sauce is tangy, complex and complements everythig.  I mean, we put it on our steaks,  potatoes, grilled onions....Bernard, you have created a masterpiece.  Thank you.  I will be making this again and again and again.  This deserves 10 stars!  I still have some left - it's like a little jar of gold sitting in my refrigerator calling me......

Made the sauce as directed except used apple cider vinegar instead of malt (too expensive to buy just to use once in awhile) and it came out perfect. Have also used ketchup in place of tomato sauce - works equally well. Recipe is very forgiving so you can spice/sweeten up or down, try different jams, have fun experimenting to your taste as other reviewers have obviously done. My favorite use is on country fried steak (cube steak coated with bread crumbs and fried - also goes great with cubed pork steak), accompanied by a side of roasted rosemary red potatoes (wash and chop red potatoes into bite sized pieces, coat lightly with olive or vegetable oil, sprinkle with crushed rosemary and bake for about 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven). Entire meal takes less than 30 minutes.

I was very skeptical about this recipe, even after I tasted it by itself I thought it had a strange flavor, but with steak, WOW - I loved it!  I didn't have jam so I used some frozen raspberries and it still turned out fine.  Served with grilled ribeye.  It was thick and delicious.  Really, someone should bottle this stuff; they'd make a fortune!

Wow.  I made this last night to use with steak and it was amazing.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I used apricot jelly instead of the raspberry jam and apple cidar vinegar inteast of malt.  Everything else I followed to the letter, and it came out GREAT!  My boyfriend loved dinner even though the steaks were a little under done for him (perfect for me!)  I feel like this recipe with the apricot would be good on chicken too.

I made this last night and loved it!  I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce because it's all I had but the sauce was still to die for.  Thank you so much for my new favorite steak sauce. Yummmmm!

Yum! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, but it tasted too much like worcestershire sauce. So the next time I made this I used *slightly* less and I also doubled the recipe and added 1/4 cup frozen raspberries (melted and mashed up). It tasted extra sweet, but I love that. If really sweet sauce isn't your thing, then don't do what I did. But using a little less worcestershire sauce would help either way.

I loved the sauce, it had a great combonation of sweet and spicy.

To all those who had runny, watery sauce: I had the opposite. It simply depends on how long you boil it. That will reduce the liquidity of it, and I left mine on for too long (taking heed of other reviews!). I think 10-12 minutes of boiling is pretty good; once it cools, it thickens, so beware.

Also, my only gripe is similar to others, in that it wsa rather sweet. I will probable remove a tad of sugar from it next time. (Disclaimer: less sugar will make it more watery based on equal boiling times. Less carmelization)

Okay...this recipe is awesome!! At first I tasted just the sauce only and I was too afraid to put it on the meat...then i cooked a small portion of round eye and let me tell you, it was perfect! I forgot the ketchup and used apple cider vinegar instead and only one T of jam and it worked out great!! LOVE IT!! I don't like eating my meat with A1 sauce so I'm thrilled to have this recipe!! THANK YOU!

I've been using this site for quite a while, but nothing ever made me want to jump out of my seat and write a review like this one did!!  It's complex, sweet, savory, rich, but not overpowering. AMAZING. When I tasted it alone, I was a little taken aback. It didn't taste like I thought it would, and I was wondering if I had forgotten an ingredient. But once I tried it with the steak....MAGIC! I'm in love.  I recently ran out of my raspberry jam so I used boysenberry, which happens to be a family favorite, and it was RIDICULOUSLY GOOD. Also, I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand, so I used 2 TBSP of ketchup instead. Also used plain white vinegar as well.   I didn't change the recipe because it was lacking in any area, I just substituted for what I had on hand.  I'm curious to know what it tastes like with strawberry jam as well. I'd also like to do something like this over salmon...perhaps apricot? Will have to look into it. :) As for some people's complaints of it being too runny, the longer you SIMMER the sauce, not boil, over low heat, the thicker it will get. Also depends on your stove. On my range, I had to set it to 3, which is about med-low to keep a nice steady simmer. If you boil it won't thicken the way it needs to, and if you keep it TOO low, it won't either.  Also, when you take it off of the heat it will thicken more as it cools. Just keep that in mind. :)  Thank you so much for such a great recipe!

This was really good. It was a little to sweet though, so I think next time I'll cut back on the sugar. I made it with blackberry jam, as I didn't have raspberry, but it complemented our steaks nicely. Thanks for the recipe!

This sauce was ok, but too sweet.  I don't normally like sweet sauces on my steak, but because it got such good reviews I thought I'd try it and unfortunately, I just didn't like how sweet it was.  It was a fine sauce for a steak, but just not to my liking.

Lick the plate tasty.  I'll admit it, I like steak sauce, the citrusy, smoky, sweet taste is the perfect foil for a hunk of grilled meat, but we were out and too lazy to drive to the store (even thought it is less than a mile away) so I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  I had to adjust the ingredients a bit since I didn't have everything called for, I was missing the raspberry jam, of all things, so I subbed a mixture of blueberry jam (I really don't like blueberry jam, its been sitting in the fridge for ages) and marmalade, my thought was that my famous brand steak sauce had orange juice, so why not add it to this homemade version?  Well, it turned out delish, my honeybun thought it was a bit sweet and added more hot sauce to his.  Thanks for the great recipe.

We really liked this. I thought it was a tad sweet so I added a couple more drops of hot sauce and a few drops of liquid smoke. Will make again.

I made this sauce as written without additions, etc.  This is an excellent sauce.  I have been experimenting with different sauces on this site.  My husband said this is the one he has liked the best.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is terrific.

Easy and tastes great! I plan to try it on chicken too.  I used strawberry jam instead of the raspberry and red wine vinegar instead of malt because that's what I had.

This is really, really good.  I put it on filet mignon as well as grilled pork.  My family loves it.  I make it exactly as is, using seedless raspberry jam.

This is full of flavor and delicious!  I contemplated using tomato paste, rather than tomato sauce, because I had an already-opened can and the ingredients, to that point, seemed sort of runny; but I decided to go with the recipe as written.  Glad I did because after it cooked, and then cooled down, it's quite thick.  Thank you, Bernard, for sharing your recipe!

Wow, what a great sauce! I purchased ingredients specifically for this recipe and I made it exactly (something I don't do often). As such, we found this too sweet for our taste and next time we will cut the sugar in half. Other than that, this was mmm mmm good! By the way, there were 4 of us eating strip steaks tonight, and due to the rave reviews I doubled the recipe, I am not sorry that I did so! This sauce is a bit runny, so you might want to be prepared to simmer this longer than called for. This is also great on baked potatoes!!!

This sauce was very delicious...not a drop was left over this first time making it.  I used black raspberry jelly, cider vinegar, and ketchup instead of tomato paste cause those are the things I had on hand.  I also omitted the hot sauce...thanks for the yummy recipe.

This sauce is perfect. I used kethcup instead of tomato sauce, white vinegar instead of malt, and strawberry jam. Still turned out awesome. I plan on making it as the recipe posted asks in the future. I also doubled all ingredients and did the boil/simmer process twice.  Brought to a boil, simmered for ten, repeated.  I thought it would turn out runny, it turned out thick after cooling, but not to thick. My wife and her sister loved it!

Mmmm, this is good...a perfect balance between spicy and sweet.  I used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce as another reviewer had suggested.  This is a nice change from the usual steak sauces.

Whipped this up last minute, didn't have raspberry so used strawberry preserves. Had leftover homemade tomato sauce. Didn't have Malt, used Apple Cider vinegar. Skipped the brown sugar all together bc some said it was too sweet and I'm not a big extra sugar person. Used it on veggies (peppers, squash, red onion, etc) on the grill.

YUM! Wasn't sure the strawberry would work but it was great! I'll try it with raspberry and brown sugar, I'm sure it's even better.

I normally like my steaks naked, but wow, this sauce is amazing! I made it for a date night despite having doubts and was very impressed.  The only change i made was to add a little more hot pepper sauce.  The look on my fiances face after his first bite let me know this is definitely a keeper.

OMG! My husband was kinda iffy while I was making this, but it is AMAZING! We made a chipotle rub for rib eyes and the flavor combination of the chipotle and the raspberry was to die for!

10 STARS!!!!  Absolutely fantastic!  When I tasted just the sauce, it was good.  When I ate it with my steak....Oh My Golly!!!!!  I will say it was a bit on the spicy side for me, so next time I will add the hot sauce drop-by-drop.  But, that is just my preference.

Per another trusted reviewer (hey, SunnyByrd!) who thought this was maybe a bit too concentrated flavor-wise once it had cooked down, I doubled the recipe and decided to sub the tomato sauce with about 3/4 of a can of tomato paste so that I wouldn't have to reduce it quite so long.  (I also used sriracha for the hot sauce, and added a few shakes of fish sauce for added complexity.)  This honestly may be the best recipe I've tried on Allrecipes.  It is sweet, but unique.  We used about 1/3 cup as a quick marinade for sliced pineapple (if you haven't grilled pineapple you don't know what you're missing) which was outstanding - truly - with our steaks.  I am a huge fan of A1, and I can honestly say I'll never buy it again.  Edited to add: this is also a fantastic base recipe to play with and add your own spin.

Woo wee- Brilliant is right! I used lingonberry preserves because thats what I had on hand, and made this in the same pan that I just pan fried my steaks in, incorporating the pan drippings. I also subbed tomato paste for the sauce based on reviews that it came out runny- completely unnecessary if you're using a large pan (or a frying pan) like me. I ended up having to add some water to thin it out a bit. The flavor is great, an excellent balance of sweet and tangy.

This sauce is beauitful, i made mine with the amended ingredients and doubled the quantity and it was great.  I actually served it/over with thin strips of beef (stirfry cuts) over a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and vegies on the side... The effect was unusual but fabulous.

Thanks for a great recipe, i will definitely keep this one as a regular.

I tried this recipe on a vacation with 15 friends. We ended up putting on our steak, chicken, potaotes, bread, and anything else we could find. It is the best sauce I have ever tried and so easy to make! I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

We have never posted on any recipe site before, but feel that this recipe is worth it. Went with the tomato paste recommendation, and found fish and chip vinegar (malt vinegar) after an epic grocery store search. The sauce was amazing, sweet and tangy and spicy, with a kick that lingered on your tongue in a most pleasant manner. It let you know it was still there, but didnt burn. Doubled the recipe and had enough for 4 steaks n potatoes, plus a tiny bit extra. Easy as pie and super tasty!

Delish!  Tried it with different jellies - IceWine Jelly, Garlic Jelly, Merlot Jelly - all great.
Also tried it with a Thai hot sauce - very nice bite to it.  Will definitely be serving more variations of it.

I had to simmer it for a little longer than the recipe said because it was a little thin.  The sauce was slightly too sweet for me so I think next time I may cut down the brown sugar and rasberry jam.  However, the taste was still amazing and everyone at dinner kept saying how much they enjoyed the sauce.

Fantastic! I simmered mine a bit longer & it came out thick & rich. Grilled some t-bones inside on a grill pan & served them w/ this sauce, a baked potato, a salad & a glass of merlot. Simple but very enjoyable dinner! Thanks!

Bernard!  I must add my kudos to growing list!  I don't have A1 Steak Sauce in the house because I don't believe in smothering the flavor of a wonderful cut of meat... nor does my husband, but last night, he said he had a hankerin' for some kind of sauce to put on the rib eyes he bought for us for dinner.  I thought AHA! Allrecipes to the rescue!  I had to make a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand (boysenberry jam for the raspberry, 1 T tomato paste + 1 T water for the tomato sauce) and we both just LOVED it!  Hubby says I should keep a batch of this made up and in the fridge at all times!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was wonderful!!! It had enough kick in the sauce, yet wasn't too hot for the kids.  I thought it would be better if it were a bit thicker.  It was a bit to runny.  I'll be sharing this recipe with all my friends and family.

The sauce was fantastic, easy and inexpensive. My twist on it was Tarragon Vinegar since I didn't have Malt (I was scared about that, but it turned out good). I also added some garlic to the mixture and, just for fun, some sesame seeds. It was fantastic!

Very nice, quick and easy!  I used Blackcurrant Jelly as didn't have any Raspberry Jam.  Yummy as!  Also subbed Malt Vinegar for Apple Vinegar.  Definately will make this again.  Would go very well with Venison.

I used this over steaks that were simply seasoned with steak seasoning. The sole changes were homemade strawberry-balsamic jam instead of the raspberry and apple cider vinegar for the malt. Tasty, I would use it again.

Would definitely use again.  I only had raspberry jam and cointreau so used that and it was fine.

This was awesome. Love the sweet and tangy flavor. No more store bought Steak Sauce for us.  Has anyone made to much and stored the rest in the  fridge? If so how long?

Really enjoyed this sauce on our cheesesteaks. We've been experimenting with different cuts of meat and cutting to different sizes. Finally hit on the way we like it and this sauce set it off.

Oh my gosh this was good! I was a wondering with the name "Devil" that it might be too spicy for the dinner party I took it to, these people can't do spicy. It was delicious, not hot! I doubled the batch to have enough for 8 steak dinners. There was some leftover even though we liked it so much we kept adding it. Served with grilled tenderloin steaks, what a treat. I used ketchup instead of opening a can of tomato sauce and it was just fine, I just cut back on the brown sugar a little to compensate. Why go to a steak house when you can easily cook restaurant food at home?! Thanks!

wow. this was the best steak sauce i've ever tasted and this will be my go-to recipe for the rest of my LIFE! I was out of tomato sauce, so i used ketchup... and i used apple cider vinegar instead of malt. I was so skeptical about the raspberry jam, but that really is the "magical" ingredient.

I don't even use steak sauce but this was excellent!  Used some home-made tomato jam instead of raspberry (which is much like an orange marmalade).

Pretty good!!! Made this with cider vinegar and ketchup instead of malt and tomato sauce.  I doubt you could tell a difference.  Ate this on grilled pork rib eyes!  Hubby said he didn't think it would be good on beef....but we loved it on the pork.  Will make again!

Yes!  Amazing sauce you can whip up in a flash!  I found this recipe to be especially acommodating to substitutions:  I used grape jam instead of raspberry and soy sauce (!) instead of Worchestershire.  No more A1 for us!

I made this sauce using a tablespoon of Tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce and cut the brown sugar in half since a lot of the comments stated the sauce was sweet.  Came out nice and thick and very tasty.  But I think it's much better on chicken or pork than a steak, both as a marinade and a BBQ sauce (as long as you use it as BBQ sauce after it comes off the grill).  I think next time I grill a rib eye, I'll include some bleu cheese and garlic.

Very flavorful and unique sauce that my son and I loved. It had a simmilar taste to bbq sauce but with an extra kick, not at all like the steak sauce you would find in the stores much much better. The raspberry jam is what really adds to this sauce, if you leave it out it would not be the same. I suggest doubling the sauce because you may just run out!

Pretty good!  I used blueberry jam, apple cider vinegar, and ketchup.  I like my sauces thin, so I added a teeny bit of water, which also made up for the reduction in Worcestershire sauce I did (just a bit).  I had this over boiled chicken, and it's pretty tasty.  I can't wait to try this on steak!

The sauce was SOOO DELICIOUS!!!  In fact, I created a user profile just to rate this recipe.  I had to improvise a little bit because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used an all berries jam, prego for the tomato sauce, red wine vinegar in place of malt vinegar and added crushed red pepper flakes and minced onions.  Simple yet delectable!

Excellent sauce.  Served at a dinner party with filet mignon.  Got raves.  It thickened up well by reducing as recipe recommends. Someone commented that ingrecients and initial tasting didn't excite, but she was right: with meat it is outstanding.

I used watered-down tomato paste instead of sauce. I also used apple-cider vinegar instead of malt. It was absolutely incredible. So was the steak. Just salt and pepper, let it rest for 5 minutes afterwards. It was a ribeye.

This Sauce is really good with steak that has been Marinated in Soy Sauce, Vinegar, Worcestire sauce and coke.  I made a few of my own twists on it though such as adding a little more tomato sauce and adding a half tbs of blackberry jam and a tbs and a half of gentleman jack daniels.  and using a half tablespoon of tiger hot sauce

My DBF was skeptical when I wanted to try this recipe over his usual homemade steak sauce, but he loved it!  The sauce was very thin and is definitely on the sweet side, but I loved the sweet/spicy combo.  I did sub blackberry jam, cider vinegar and ketchup b/c I had all these ingredients on hand and therefore did not have to buy a thing to make it.  I'm sure the recipe is equally good despite  these substitutions.  I will certainly make this again.

Very happy how this sauce turned out. Recipe seems to handle minor changes if you have not got the exact ingredients EG Vinegar normal everyday and replaced hot sauce with pinch of chille flakes. This is very simple and makes a basic meal into something special straight to the cook book with this one.

Best Steak sauce ever!!!  Instead of the rasberry jam, I used Jalepeno Jelly (tastes just like jam but with a hot bite) and I excluded the hot sauce.  It was just the right hot/sweet flavour.  Yummy!

Very tasty!
I didnt have any worchestershire sauce, so I used Japanese Tonkatsu (Bulldog)sauce instead, and it turned out great! I thought it was a little too tangy and strong at first, as another reviewer pointed out, but steak sauce is not meant to be eaten on its own! The sauce went great with mashed carrots and potatoes so the next time I made it, I stirred a bit of the sauce directly into the mash before serving. Mmmm!

Excellent!  I ran out of my favorite steak sauce and came across this.  Just an FYI I had all of the ingredients on-hand but the tomato sauce.  I used ketchup instead and it worked out fine.  Can't wait to make it as directed. Thanks

Excellent steak sauce!! substituted spaghetti sauce for tomato sauce because its what we had.  Even the steak hating kids who usually have hot dogs instead were stealing the steak right off our plates! Grilled steaks marinated in Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks Submitted by: Angie Zayac then topped with Devils Steak Sauce, definately a winning combination!

I will never buy A1 steak sauce again! It's that good. And its that easy to make. If you're going to go to the expense and effort of cooking a steak, why not take the last step!

I made this sauce last night when we grilled a London Broil.  The taste is unique, and yes, really good!  I used Black Raspberry jam, which is my favorite. I'll be making this for my friends cookouts this summer.

I made this last night to use over grilled strip steaks and it was wonderful! I used a Raspberry/Chipolte sauce instead of jam and balsamic vinegar, just because that was all I had on hand. I also simmered it until it had a "glaze" consistency. No more expensive store bought sauce for our house!

Thanks for a great recipe!  We tried it on rib eyes tonight, and it was good!  We used tarragon vinegar, since I too have never seen malt vinegar in the store (not that I've looked...).  Guess I'll have something new to look for at the store next time I go!  Can't wait to try this on fliet mignon or Chateau Briand!  Yummy!

I used rice vinegar cuz I didn't have any malt vinegar.  I also thickened up the sauce with some corn starch & water.  Tastes pretty close to my favorite brand at the store and I don't have to pay $4 a bottle!  Very delicious!  Thanks Bernard

Really good .... I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce, red wine vinegar instead of malt vinegar and strained out the seeds at the end.

I've been on allrecipes for a few years and I constantly search the internet for new things to make. This is THE sauce I use on my steaks, after growing up with A1 going on everything from ribeyes to pork cutlets. I have a good seasons carafe on the door in the fridge filled with this sauce next to my other condiments. Wonderful recipe. Amazing.

This has to be the most wonderful steak sauce ever!  I have been looking for years for the perfect sauce recipe and this is it.  I made it exactly as described and it turned out wonderfully.  The only complaint that my husband had (while licking the bowl) was that I should have doubled the recipe.  My thanks to the author for submitting this recipe!

I think A1 is overrated. If you don't like A1, this is the sause to go to. This steak sauce IS THE BEST!!!! It's sweet and tangy. Just perfect for Mr. Steak.

This was a nice change of pace.  I do feel that this might be better as a sauce to be served with Duck.  I felt it was too sweet after a while, even though I halved the amount of sugar.

We are not a steak sauce family (I was looking for a recipe for catsup and ran across this; it looked intriguing, so I tried it) but this may change things!  I took the advise of Shanagan and used tomato paste instead of sauce, which meant less cooking time to get to a good consistency.  The flavor was good - a bit too sweet for us, so I think I will cut down a bit on the brown sugar next time - but the hint of raspberry really adds something.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Wonderful, I'm a nut for sweet and savory. This fits the bill. I just eyeballed the ingredients to our taste [ used everything basically the same, just doubled], I made to go with 'Deer Poppers' from this site, I'll diffently be making again. Thanks.

I didn't have malt vinegar so I used cider. I did add two tsp. of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. I thought this was insane-good, although a little sweet. I say it's not the recipe's fault as I think it was because of the vinegar substitution. I plan on buying it and making it to recipe and NEVER BUYING A-1 EVER AGAIN! Good with steak, even better with chicken. This would make a great marinade.

First time I tried didn't have the exact ingredients and tried to improvise.  It turned out Ok but not great.  So last night did it exactly as called and we all enjoyed it.  It added a different flavor/dimension to our steaks (on the sweeter side).  No problem thickening but will double the recipe next time!

Very good. In order to get this sauce to thicken, it has to reduce quite a bit - which makes it pretty strong. I may try boiling it a few minutes and then adding a little cornstarch to thicken it next time, but it is also very good as written. Thanks for the recipe!

Great flavor and a big hit at a recent family get together.  I didn't have any raspberry jam, so substituted guava jam (the only jam open in the refrigerator) and I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce.  It was wonderful and my son-in-law who never uses steak sauce loved it.

This is amazing, I made it as directed but X's 40. I was wanting a thick sauce to go over my pork roast and then some left over that I could store in the refridgerater for steaks later in the week. Very Nice Job!!

This sauce was very good. We covered two good sized steak with the amount it made. It tastes a little weird on it's own, but really goes well with a steak. I also added some liquid smoke to the mix.

I got this recipe probably 8 months ago and we keep a "batch" of it in our freezer for everything! We use it on every cut of meat for marinate and every cut of meat for dipping sauce. We use it for bar-b-que and ribs and chicken. If we have steak and we don't have any in the freezer or the ingredients to make it my kids literally get upset enough to cry! (minus the pepper sauce for them) Such simple ingredients and equal parts of each. How much easier does it get? Fantastic!

This was surprisingly good.  I subbed red wine vinegar for malt because I had it on hand, and I totally forgot the tomato sauce.  It still thickened nicely -- I probably simmered it longer than called for -- and my husband who'd seen the ingredients list and had to be FORCED to try it, preferred it to his favorite steak sauce!  It was a bit sweet but then again I did forget the tomato which might have dampened that down a bit.  Quite good and I will make it again!  I might try adding a bit of garlic, too.

My husband has been putting this on everything.  Mine came out a little runny, I think I over cooked it.  I think I cooked it for like 35 minutes waiting for it to thicken, and it never did!  Next time I will  only do the 12 minutes and see what happens.  Update 6/9, I tried this again, but it still turned out runny, was actually a little better when I let it cook longer.

Wow! Really yummy.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was using cider vinegar instead of the malt, since cider vinegar was all I had on hand.  My sauce came out really thick once cooled.  Not sure if that's the consistency it was supposed to be or if I over-cooked it. So, keep that in mind when making it yourself. Otherwise, maybe it could be thinned out a little. But it really was good with medium rare steaks.  The meat I used was a low grade cut - I'd love to try this on a slightly better cut of meat!

What a great tasting sauce!!!  I used grape jam and cider vinegar as that is all I had on hand.  It turned out wonderful.  Will be making another batch, much bigger, so I can have some on hand.  I think it would really spice up a plain hamburger.

I've made this sauce twice and it's fabulous.  I used blackberry preserves and cut the worcestershire sauce in half because it was too much of a "kick" for my wife the first time around.  I prepared 2.5" thick filet mignons to medium rare on the grill and this sauce made the dish.

This was great!  I tried to make it to exact specifications, but found that I did not have tomato sauce, nor malt vinegar.  I used tomato paste and cider vinegar instead.  I also used Roasted Garlic hot sauce.  As a previous reviewer said, it didn't really smell all that tasty until I put it on the steak.  I brushed some on while the steak was in the final stage of cooking, then more while it was sitting afterwards.

This was awesome! I made two batches, one spicy and the other not, and had 30 people over for Memorial weekend BBQ and they all loved it.  Print off the recipe because others will want it.  Thanks for sharing~

this was amazing and so easy to make.  I added garlic chili paste in place of the hot pepper sauce (only about 1/8 tsp for a doubled recipe) and it was perfect.  Just the right amount sweet and a touch of spicy.  i will do this again and again

This sauce is great!  I used white vinegar because I didn't have malt vinegar, and also used a combination of preserves as it was all I had on hand.  I used rasberry, strawberry, and grape (just a little, to even out the cup)!  It sounds a bit extreme, but I was hopeful.  It came out great!  I even bottled some for friends.  You can cut the sugar down a little, but I think the grape preserves took care of the extra sugar.  Definitely worth making!

I made this sauce with a lovely sirloin steak I thought it was really yummy but my boyfriend thought it was too sweet. So the next time i made it i only put in one spoon of jam and no sugar i also added 2 drops extra of pepper sauce which gave it a real kick. I had this sauce with chicken and it was lovely. A fantastic sauce but i am curious about the quantities cos it doesn't look like it could feed 4 people there is barely enough there for one person let alone two.

I accidentally forgot to add the hot pepper sauce, which I think would have only improved it.  I did add garlic to the recipe.  I've never made homemade steak sauce and this was great!

I've used this 2 ways.  The first time I made it and used it as suggested and we found that it just overpowered the wonderful flavor of the steaks.  The second time I used it just to baste the steaks before broiling them.  They were outrageous that way and I will definitely use this recipe again.  I give it a 5 star for the basting method!

Loved this sauce. Made it a little bit hotter by adding a touch more chilli sauce also used ketchup instead of top sauce. Had the leftovers on a burger but think sauce would go with most foods

I used this as a base for my steak sauce.  I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce, and since I like things spicy, I used Vietnamese chili garlic sauce (the kind with the green cap that they always have on the tables in pho restaurants).  It had the perfect amount of heat to offset the sweet and tangy flavors.  Loved it.  It's insane how quick it is to make.

I made the recipe as it is. I must say this is very sweet. It tasted so good and I feel it lends itself better for lamb, pork and chicken. I prefer a more savory sauce for beef. It really is a great sauce and that's why I rate it a 5. Also, I would also try other jams as other reviews suggest. I will make this again but for pork and chicken.

WOW! What a fantastic sauce!!! I'm not a fan of steak sauce, but if all of them taste this good, I'm sure I'll quickly change my mind! This tastes complex, but takes no time to whip together (winner!). It was the perfect complement to our bacon-wrapped filets. Thanks for sharing your unique recipe, Bernard. I'll be making this again for sure! :-)

Delicious! I added a little bit more Worcestershire sauce to cut through the raspberry taste. Used it as a condiment with steak and on top of meatloaf, worked well with both!

If you don't have raspberry jam, strawberry will also do.  Used my homemade strawberry jam that wasn't too sweet.  The key with these sauces is to boil them enough so most of the vinegar is evaporated.

I am a bit perplexed as to what to say.  Whilst I was cooking it, I tasted it a couple of times and found it delicious.  But when I went to eat it with my steak, I was quite disgusted and I scraped it off the plate.  However I am convinced that it would be just superb with game or duck.  I have ordered a pigeon for next week.  I used raspberries instead of jam.  I was too lazy to walk a couple of metres to buy a jar.  I have given it 5 stars for game, but none if it's with steak.

My review is based on other reviews and the recommendations to serve with venison. Venison isn't available where I live, but I plan to order some online very soon and serve a special dinner to fellow foodies. This sounds like a first-class recipe.

I spent 2 weeks in Austria several years ago, and I ate venison at least once a day, most of which was served with a berry-based sauce.

I made a version of this sauce and loved it.  I had seedless blackberry jam and apple cider vinegar instead.  I had to use soy sauce instead of Worcestershire due to a food allergy.  Like other reviewers, I was not sure about it when I tasted it in the pot.  It does have to be over meat.

This was a huge hit.  I increased the heat by dicing up 2 Thai chilies in addition to the hot sauce.

This is our go-to sauce for steak and chicken.  It does make quite a bit so we scale it back (about 1/2) when it serves two.  As suggested, I add brown sugar and trade 1 T tomato paste for 1 T tomato sauce.

Awesome! Simple and cheap to make. It's even better than the bottled version. It's just the right amount of sweetness with a twang. I love it!!

In a word, EXCELLENT!!  I've made this a number of times in the past and it's always a hit!  This is one of those sauces, for me anyway, that doesn't taste that great from a spoon, but put some on a perfectly grilled steak and it's HEAVEN!!  Since we decided to grill steaks tonight I asked Hubs if he'd like a marsala wine sauce with it.  He turned up his nose and said - how about the Devil's Steak Sauce?  So he's obviously a fan of this recipe too.  Five stars for this one all the way!!!!!

Very Good!! The only changes I made, based on a few of the reviews, was to add five shakes of Habanero Tabasco instead of five drops. It was hot and spicy and great! It didn't make much sauce after reducing, so next time I'll try doubling the recipe. I may also experiment with using tomato paste instead of sauce to aid in thickening and trying other jams. It's a great recipe. Thanks for sharing Bernard.

This is a wonderful steak sauce. I doubled the recipe after using 5 shakes of Tabasco sauce as opposed to five drops. I increased everything 2 times and left the additional Tabasco out. It is now perfect! It has a lot of flavor and just the right amount of kick in the finish. Cudos to the submitter!

I fixed this before the Fourth of July to see how it was and then again at a cookout on the Fourth. Everyone fell in love with it and asked numerous time for the recipe. Not only is it good on steaks, but on any kind of beef, chicken and pork. I have to quadruple the recipe to make enough for all the things it is good with. Also tried it with shrimp and was just as good. Kudos to the chef!

This sauce is great if you're sick of gravy and looking for an alternative sauce. I didn't have raspberry jam so used fig jam and didn't put in much hot sauce due to feeding it to young kids. But it still tasted great. Wouldn't use it all the time but great as an occasional taste change. Will make again but not for a month or two (its quite sweet!)

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this sauce on a good steak.  I didn't have raspberry jam, so I substituted low sugar blackberry and I used a splenda blend brown sugar to further reduce the sugars in the recipe.  I did bump up the hot sauce to 10 drops and we enjoyed it very much and are looking forward to try it on grilled chicken.

I thought this recipe was just okay.  Perhaps the raving reviews from others raised my expectations.  I actually preferred my grilled steak simply seasoned with salt and pepper and without the sauce.  My husband liked it better than I did.

I have only one question. what country is the contributor from? 
I lived in New Zealand, and they called ribeyes, Scotch fillet and ketchup was called tomato sauce. 

My son came to visit from the USA, and I tried to explain that to him, but he got two cans (tins) of ketchup anyway. Our spaghetti sauce was really ketchup-y and sweet as a result because he was too embarrassed to exchange it.:}

Works very well with steaks that have little marble.  The best steak sauce I have ever tried.

Wonderful. Nice combination of sweet and sour. I was weary of the jam but it was perfect. I substituted tomato paste for tomato sauce and it made for a nice consistency. Give it a try. You will be pleasently surprised.

For those having a hard time finding malt vinegar: You may buy a bottle cheap, cheap at Long John's Silver. I always keep a bottle at home for take-out on my fish. A bottle will last a long time.

Great sauce!  I was frantic when I did not have any sauce for my filets so I searched and this sauce caught my eye.  I made it with stuff I had laying around the house because most of the ingredients are common.  Turned out great and will make again.  Thanks.

I found this to be a good homecooked sauce. Much better than store bought. I thought it could have been a bit more thinner to pour from the sauce pan. I think that adding just a bit more vinegar would do the trick.

best steak sauce ever. My bottle grocery store steak sauce was very old.... way way over the expiration date. So found this recipe and was thrilled. It had a TON of flavor. I had to use some substitutes. Like for the malt vinegar I had to use white and for the raspberrie jam I instead used fresh raspberries. I mashed the raspberries in the sauce while cooking. It tasted fantastic. It did cut down on the sugar that's in the jam. I was thrilled it turn out so good. A must try.!!!!  I will never go back to store bought.!!

how have I never reviewed this amazing concoction yet?? it is absolutely AHmazing, and I dont even like steak sauce. its so good my kids refuse to eat steak any other way now, including my oldest (aka "veggie boy") the vegetarian, who puts it on his faux meat strips (and everything else!) they love it on the baked potatoes just as much as the steak! I always set the serving size to 20 for the 5 of us, and they still complain its not enough! not to mention that I am a big "tweeker" when it comes to recipes- I love putting my own twist on things- but the only change I make to this is using ACV, simply bc thats what I always have on hand...its simply perfect as is! I definitely agree with the reviewer who said the creator of this recipe should bottle it and would make a fortune- I highly suggest they hurry before someone else does! Truly the best steak sauce I've ever had...BRAVO!!!

I have made this a half dozen times now and it is always good but maybe a bit on the sweet side. I decided to try it with a raspberry habanero jelly that I had made instead of the raspberry jam that is called for in the recipe and I eliminated the hot sauce. This made a huge difference in the flavor. The next time, I used the vinegar to marinate habaneros overnight and used that with the raspberry habanero jelly and WOW! Very zesty, a taste of sweet then it opens up your senses and the flavor of the steak. My friends and family rave about this sauce now and would never guess that it contained raspberry as a key ingredient in the steak sauce. Great recipe, and a great starter to customize to your own taste!

I've made this as specified and it's excellent and it's also easy to vary the ingredients- we like it with spicy jams/jellies - pineapple habenero,  hatch chile jalopeno jam, etc. and I've been using ketchup instead of tomato paste - and last night I used  a half seasoned  rice vinegar and balsamic vinegar. Anyway - super awesome steak sauce.

This sauce is sitting on my stove right now, waiting for our steaks on the fire... and it is AWESOME! I doubled it, used the cider vinegar I had on hand, and added just a bit more of my homemade raspberry jam. It is the perfect blend of sweet, spicy, and tangy. Just what I was looking for. I will be using this again on other meats. :D

I am not a fan of A1. It is what I buy because my husband likes it. I always add honey to get it where I like it. He likes hot hot salsa and I am a no heat kind of girl. I like Sweet and sour he does not. I was serving up left overs and ran out of steak sauce last night. I found this recipe and boy did I find something great for me! I did not have raspberry jam but did have raspberry peach jam and used it. Also did not have Malt vinegar but used regular white. Also only added one drop of hot sauce because I am a heat whimp.  I am now in love with this sauce. I am going make a large portion of this and figure out how to can it. It is that good!

I also used ketchup instead of tomato sauce becuse that's what I had so I backed off the sugar a bit.  After tasting this sauce plain I was far from impressed, but I went ahead and used it as a glaze for some salmon fillets I was broiling and after the first bite my boyfriend and I were raving about how perfect it was.

I love this sauce recipe!  I've made it twice now, once with strawberry jam and the other with the raspberry jam - both were equally as delicious!  We had the strawberry jam version with bacon wrapped fillets and the raspberry version with chicken breasts, both done on the grill.  Fabulous!

I will never buy A1 or any other steak sauce again! My husband who never ever puts anything other than salt/pepper on his steak tryed it and liked it. Made the sauce according to the recipe, why would anybody rate it if they make changes. mjs

I loved this recipe! I am not a big steak person but my husband and son are. I tried it exactly as it was (although I did use ketchup instead of totmato sauce) and the final verdict from the boys was 'amazing'! I like how you can adjust the heat with the amount of hot sauce you put in.

I love trying different sauces and I saw this recipe and thought it looked interesting! I have to say that it really is amazing, I made it with apple cider vinegar since I didnt have malt on hand, and its out of this world. Definitely a different combination of flavors for sure!

Simply FANTASTIC. I was a bit apprehensive at first but it was more than worth the risk after I took the plunge. I made the jam from fresh raspberries.

I love spicy/sweet and that is exactly what this sauce brings.  It could have been a little thicker, but it's true to the picture so who am I to complain.  I will absolutely make this again but will try to thicken it up a bit just so I don't waste any because it was awesome.  Even my foodie boyfriend ate it, and that's saying a lot he's picky and moans about everything he didn't come up with...

This is one recipe that really lives up to its stars! I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor and the fact that the sauce didn't drown out the flavor of the steak!

OMG this is so good!  I love the sweetness of it with the little kick of heat.  I halved the recipe thinking no one else would eat it but me, but everyone tried it and loved it and wished I woulda made more!  My husband doesn't like steak sauce but loved this and my daughter hates spicy and dealt with it cause she liked it so much!  Ha!  So glad I tried this, now its gonna be demanded with all our steaks!

I was looking for a quick sauce to make and this was perfect.  I started by frying onion and pepper in 1 tbsp of butter then added 2x sauce.  I substituted mixed berry jam, salsa, and white vinegar for raspberry jam, tomato sauce, and malt vinegar.  It was still delicious.  1st time I've rated a recipe 5 stars.

This sauce was perfect with my steak! I loved it, but a couple of family members weren't as thrilled about it.

yummy!  followed recipe, was sure to let the sauce bubble for 10 mins to thicken....it probably could have been a little thinner.  great flavor!

this sauce is a keeper.  my husband printed if out one night and said it sounded good let try it.  i was a little hesatant.  it sounds kinda sweet.  we always double the sauce and add a little extra tomato sauce.  it is so easy and taste so good.  it is a great sauce and the recipe is used on a regular basis in our house.  give it try you wont be sorry!!!

OMG!!!  This is so good!  I didn't change a thing, and it was a huge hit at our BBQ last night.  I had people coming back for seconds just so they could have more sauce!  Thank you so much for your post.  :)

This was an okay sauce.  It didn't wow my pants off but it was very forgiving of substitutions and my kids really liked it (which speaks volumes of it got them to eat steak!!).

This is a delicious alternative to A-1 or Heinz 57.  I served it with barbequed rib eye steaks, several time already.  Outstanding flavor

It is always nice to find another Montgomerie, with the "ie" at the end.  We must be related. The sauce was dynamite.  You make all Montgomerie's proud!
