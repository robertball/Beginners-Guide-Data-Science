These were delicious :) We used ground venison instead of ground beef. We found that the chunks of onion and garlic were bigger than we normally eat so I ended up having to chop them up more before mixing them in. This, along with the fact that they definitely needed seasoning is why I gave this recipe 4 stars. Added some salt and pepper and grilled them over charcoal. I used a patty press and they stayed together no problem. They were very moist as well!

I used my immersion blender and blended the Birds Eye Chopped Onions and Garlic just enough so there wouldn't be big chunks of onion in the burger. You certainly need to add seasonings to the meat. While I'm a fan of the packaged Birds Eye Recipe Ready products, I'm not a fan of this particular recipe.

I made burgers as instructions said and burgers were received well by family. Juicy, tasty and tender were the words used by all. I made sure to freeze patties for a few minutes before cooking so they would stay together.

These were tasty. I did chop the onions and garlic up a bit more as I cannot eat large piece of veggies. Added lots of salt and pepper to the burger. Having the onions and garlic pre chopped makes for a quicker meal

Lovely, simply lovely!  The garlic and mushrooms gave the ground beef a whole new flavor-very nice.

These were good! I do agree w/ others that said that the meat needed salt and pepper, but that was no big issue. These did come out nice, moist and flavorful. We topped ours w/ swiss cheese instead of cheddar. I used my burger press and had no issues w/ them falling apart. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The burgers fell apart on the grill.  We felt that if they were going to have so much garlic and onion they needed a binder of some kind, such as an egg in order to stay together.  We also felt that the garlic and onion didn't add to the flavor enough to make it worth the trouble.  We used 75/25 beef.  I'm disappointed because I really expected this to be a great idea.  I'm looking forward to trying some of the other Bird's Eye Recipe Ready mixes, I think it's an excellent idea.

The burgers turned out very moist and quite tasty.  I used ground round and added ground black pepper, seasoned salt, and some Worcestershire sauce along with the Birdseye® recipe ready chopped onions and garlic.  I cooked them on my gas grill.  I'm only rating it a 4 stars because I added seasonings and I am a purest when it comes to my burgers, in that I don't really like onions in them...but that is a personal preference.

An easy, tasty burger with minimal prep time.
I used 93% lean, grass-fed ground beef. I also added in about 1/4 tsp sea salt and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. I mixed it all together with my hands, then used a burger press to get six nicely shaped patties. These took about 15 mins to cook to well on my grill. Remember when you're grilling very lean meats like this not to press down on it with the spatula. There isn't too much fat, and if you press it all out you'll end up with a dry burger instead of a flavorful and juicy one.
