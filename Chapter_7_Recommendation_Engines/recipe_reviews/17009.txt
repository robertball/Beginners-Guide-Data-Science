Very nice. I added bacon to the browning chuck steak cubes and used store bought puff pastry. I used beef stock instead of red wine and frozen veg. Before I added the pastry lid, I covered the meat mixture with a layer of tasty cheddar cheese slices. My hubby loves steak, bacon and cheese pie. Because I added the bacon it was a lot saltier and next time I will use salt-reduced stock.

We made 10 pies' worth of this recipe for a big group. It was very easy, but I found it somewhat bland. I would also at least double the meat:vegetable ratio if I was going to make it again.

Simply DELICIOUS, good comfort food! I used beef broth in place of the red wine and frozen veggies instead of canned. I LOVED IT! This will definitely be a favorite! Thanks!

Very good pot pie.  I used the refrigerated pie crusts which were perfectly cooked. The canned mixed vegetables I used had potatoes which was a nice addition to the pie.  I might explore using frozen vegetables next time to see if their was a big difference.

Will make again.

This has a strange flavor, the wine is not a good addition.  I followed directions exactly, maybe I should have used broth instead.  It's basically chicken pot pie but with stew beef and a bland gravy...

I used left over pot roast and it turned out wonderfully. My boyfriend and I actually liked it better than the pot roast!

I had to improvise with this recipe, I made my own pie crust, and beef gravy as I had none pre-made on hand. I also cut back on the wine because I didn't make enough gravy ( ooops!). Plus, I used frozen veggies. Other than all that I followed the recipe and it was my first time cooking with wine I was pleased overall. I will build upon this recipe, and make again thanks Andrew!

This is the 2nd pie that I have ever made and it wasn't until this recipe did I discover the importance of letting a pie "sit" so that the flavors can set in. At first taste I thought that maybe the recipe called for too much wine but a few hours later after I had it in the fridge and heated it up it tasted perfect! My sister the picky eater even enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a really great recipe that you can alter to your personal taste. I omitted the wine, and instead of canned veggies did a quick saute of fresh to include sliced onion, celery, carrot. I added a small can of mushrooms and some sliced baked potato. Thank you for the great recipe.

Really loved this. We were getting sick of the old chicken pot pie recipe, and this was just a easy, with a totally new flavor.  The whole family loved it!  Thank you Andrew

Just making it now, and it's cooking in the oven now.  I'm not usually into home baking but today i decided i wanted to make pie.  Easy instructions, and easy to do.

Great recipe, my first time making anything with a crust and it was delicious. I left out the wine and I think I would prefer using leftover pot roast as the steak that I used was a little tough.

This was a REALLY nice base recipe.  I added rounded 1/2 tsp. of dried oregano and about 1/2 Tbls. of dried parsley and a small onion (which I lightly sauteed first) and then added to the beef/wine mixture for reducing.  It was a little liquidy even though I let it stand for 10 mins. after baking.  May add 2 tsp. flour or corn starch just to thicken a little...but not by much.

Good. Easy! For some reason I ended up with too much liquid and it overflowed the pir crust. I'd love to blame the recipie but it was probably operator error. 

Overall a quick and reasonable dish.
