This was a very mild dish. Not sure if it was intended to be so unassuming. I ended up adding a tablespoon of red curry paste to give it a bit of flavor, but it was still a bit lacking.

I made this for dinner tonight, following the recipe. It might make a good base for a sauce, but it lacked flavor. Also, there are many kinds of creamy pasta sauces you could name this after but carbonara is not a good one. Traditional carbonara is made with bacon and eggs. This lacks both the flavors and textures of that. I hate to be harsh, but there it is.
