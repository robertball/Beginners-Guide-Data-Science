This will be the 3rd time making this pie and i lovee that it's so easy.  I used 1/2 c sugar, 2 T cornstarch, and about 2.5 T sugar free strawberry jello.  Cut the berries only in half, mixed with the glaze, and let it set overnight.  Turned out perfect with just the right mix of tart and sweet.

This was great. I made my own crust and put a layer of cream cheese mixed with powdered  sugar on the crust after I baked it. Delish!

This made a nice glaze. It was perfect for a deep dish pie. I used about 6 cups of fresh sliced strawberries and mixed them in a bowl with the glaze. I mounded them high in my pie crust. It was the perfect amount. I was surprised that it did not taste like Jello. Was better than Marie Callendar's who's pie crusts usually taste freezer-burnt. Now I can make my own! thanks Karin! I have impressed many so far :)

Very tasty, BUT BE CAREFUL!  When boiling the ingredients, it might bubble up and splash...VERY HOT!

Good but a little too sweet and to much gelatin but well worth modifying.  Next time I will try reducing gelatine to 3 packages and reduce sugar to 1/3 cup sugar.

Delicious!  I only had half the gelatin on hand, and it still turned out amazing.  I also used half sugar/half splenda.

Extremely good glaze.  On my second attempt, I added 1/2 tsp "Vitamin C Granules" to the recipe, since I love a tart fruit pies.  That did the trick.  If you like a sweet glaze, this one is great.  If you like a little tart kick, try adding the Vitamin C.  Also, be sure you let the glaze cool to at least 80 degrees before adding to the strawberries.

Very easy to make. It looked so yummy that we couldn't wait to let it set 24hrs. We only let it set 2 hours and it was still delicious! The kids had two servings! It was a light and refreshing summer treat! Thanks.

Divine! Added the layer of cream cheese (8oz) & powdered sugar (2T) as suggested. Used only 1/4c. sugar in the glaze because strawberries were very sweet. Used graham cracker crust I recipe from this site.  Had to make it two nights in a row because the demand was so great from my family. Can't wait to try it with peaches.

This was a simple recipe to prepare.  I had all the ingredients on hand which is why I made it.  I'm not sure it needs 1/4 cup (4 Tbsp) of corn starch tho.  Good recipe, and simple for summertime

I used two containers sugar free jello (I only had cherry on hand) 2T cornstarch and substituted splenda for sugar.  I quartered the strawberries and the family raved about how good it was.  The hubby thought I should have had more glaze or moisture, so next time I will use three boxes of sugar free jello and a little more water.  It wasn't too sweet and didn't taste like a healthy version at all...I might just make the filling in a bowl and serve with cool whip for a potluck or something.

I hate Jello but after reading all the good reviews, I gave this a try.  I'm so glad I did!  The glaze doesn't taste like Jello at all, and it's much tastier than the gluey red stuff that you buy at the grocery to use for strawberry glaze.  Excellent recipe and very easy!  Next time, I plan to use my own pre-baked pie shell, simply because I'm not a big fan of graham crackers.  I bet this would also be good with one of those chocolate cookie pie crusts.

I found this recipe easy and fun to make! But it was a little too sweet for my tastes...and and glaze turned out too much like Jello--maybe add more water? less cornstartch?

Perfect! We were having a dinner party and our guests were bringing small children. I was worried they would not like dessert, so I opted for this recipe instead. The children loved it! And the adults didn't feel like they were eating something off the kids menu. I will be making this again soon.

Something was "off" about this glaze... I think maybe too much corn starch or gelatin. The glaze thickened up super-quickly on the stovetop (one minute it was watery, the next minute it was thick and gel-like). It formed a good seal around my strawberries, but the taste was a bit artificial.

I use raspberry jello instead of strawberry. It brings out the flavor of the strawberries more. I also use whole berries instead of slicing them. Just arrange them however you want them and chill until you serve.

Cut recipe in 1/2. Used exact ingredients ratios and directions. Used shortbread crust (1c flour, 1/2c butter, 1/4c powdered sugar, 1t vanilla) instead of graham crust and i'm really glad i did. After pouring strawberry filling into crust I stuck it in the freezer instead of the fridge for a while to set up cuz i get impatient. Served the pie with cool whip.  Flavor of this pie is amazing. not too sweet just perfect.

I used this for strawberry shortcake. My mom had bought the wrong thing, so I found this. It turned out great. I did have to thin it out when we were ready to eat. It was not too sweet and the texture was great.  I am not a fan of the store bought glaze, but with this it was great!

VERY GOOD.  But my crust got soggy. I used an oreo crust. Maybe that's why. Wish I knew how to keep it crispy.

Easy to make but had to much of a jello texture and taste.  Made way too much sauce for pie.

The pie looked beautiful, but was too dense.  I would cut back on the cornstarch if I tried it again. It had the consistency of a hard finger jello.

I made this recipe twice just as written and everybody loved it both times. It's pretty sweet (maybe due to the jello mix) but I didn't feel it was overly sweet. This is a quick and easy recipe. It takes longer to clean, hull, and slice the strawberries than it does to make the glaze and put it together. I did find that this barely fits in the 10" (2 extra servings size) pie crust so I don't know how it could all fit in a 9" crust without cutting back to 5 cups of sliced strawberries.

E-Z! to convert to a low sugar recipe- and I modified the sugar using Truvia & used sugar free Jello, and a low-cal whip topping. I value the nutrition value info that is offered for each recipes.

I've made this twice now and it tastes great! The first time I used a homemade pie crust and it was better than the store bought crust I used the second time. My mother and father, whose first jobs were at Shoney's, said this recipe was just like Shoney's only my pie tasted better! I didn't make any adjustments to the recipe, didn't need to!

This was a great recipe. I had most of the ingredients on hand. I only had a small package of sugar free strawberry banana jello, so I used that and added regular gelatin to make up the 4TBS. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! It will be made again for sure, after all the great reviews I had. Thanks!

I used the glaze for strawberry shortcakes. The only thing I did different was cut the cornstarch down to 1 1/2 tbsp. and the gelatin to 2 tbsp. When I first made it, I thought it was too thick even for pie. Tasted delicious. I will never buy glaze from the store again!

this recipe is great! i even used fresh-picked strawberries from a local farm. the only thing i changed about this recipe was using a frozen deep-dish pie crust instead of the graham cracker crust. of course i baked the crust before adding the ingredients to it. the pie turned out GREAT. perfect amount of sweetness!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used frozen strawberries that I had left over from strawberry picking. I just thawed them a bit (left semi frozen for easy slicing) and cut them in slices. Worked perfectly! A very quick dessert to put together.

it is so quick and easy to make. it was a little too sweet, so i tried half of the white sugar required and it still worked; just wondering if it would be the same if tried with splenda.

This is by far the best strawberry pie recipe I have tried over the years, and I also received many compliments from my neighbors who sampled slices of the pie.  With the exception of adding 2 tbsps. cornsyrup, I made this recipe with the listed ingredients.   I didn't have a ready made  or refrigerated pie crust so I made a no-roll pie crust from another website.   This recipe is worthy of 5 stars, and I will be making strawberry pie again using this recipe!

This glaze was delicious, but too thick!  I added another 1/2 cup water but it still could have been thinner. Next time I will use two cups of water or lessen the cornstarch. Definitely a tasty strawberry pie!

I made it exactly as said.  Excellent, naturally delicious!  It was an easy light dessert that had just the right amount of sweetness to bring out the natural flavor of the strawberries.  It brought back wonderful memories of stopping in at BIG BOY after an evening out (45 years ago).

Very good.  My berries had come out of my garden and were really sweet, so I reduced the sugar to a scant half cup.

I made it night before. When I served the following evening it wasn't as glossy. I made two. I did make one with sugar and cream cheese on top of layer of graham crust. Someone recommend that to avoid soggy crust. The one without cream cheese was not soggy.  The cream cheese mixture was hard to spread, maybe it didn't have enough sugar.  To do over I'd make the morning of or 4 hours before serving. Made my own crust with graham's.  Definitely will try with peaches.

Made it for Father's day and it was such a hit that my husband requested it for his birthday (a week later!).  I stuck to the recipe as written (except maybe added some extra berries for a total of 8 cups cleaned and cut and used a regular pie crust instead of graham cracker) and it was perfect!  Not too sweet or jello-y.

I made it.  Everyone liked it.  I would use less sugar next time, maybe only 1/4 c.  I'd like to try the sugar free jello but if I do I'll start with only 1T.  It seems that the sugar free is really sweet.  I made it the day before so it chilled about 15 hours before serving and we all were amazed at how perfectly the pieces came out.

This was so easy to make and my family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except for throwing some blackberries and raspberries in with the strawberries.  I would definitely make this again and want to try it with a shortbread crust.

My all-time favorite now. I even have it posted on the inside of my cupboard. Always a no-fail recipe. Sometimes I halve this, and put a layer of cream cheese (with a little sugar & Cool Whip mixed in)on the bottom.

I didn't make the pie but I use the glaze. It's excellent and super easy. It's great as a cheesecake or pound cake topper or even a poke cake. I remember my mother boiling berries and measuring and straining and what a mess. This is a breeze. I also cut it in half for smaller cakes and it's a beautiful color.

Very delicious and easy. Watch it carefully so as not to over cook.  Great strawberry flavor and not too sweet. I used it to coat strawberries for a layer cake with white cake and cream cheese frosting and it was amazing.

Best strawberry glaze ever. I put  a cream cheese layer - whipped and  sweetened with a bit of sugar on the crust, then chilled it. Then put on whole berries which I tossed in glaze first, then the balance of glaze over all.
No restaurant pie can touch it. Gorgeous and delicious.

My family loves this, but we love anything strawberry.  I use the  pre-made reduced fat graham cracker crusts which is probably why mine usually breaks up when I try to serve it.  My filling never seems to stay together, but I don't let it sit overnight.  Mine doesn't look like a pretty piece of pie when I serve it, but my family loves the combination of strawberry filling, graham cracker crust and cool whip on top so they don't care what it looks like.  Delicious!

EXCELLENT PIE!  Everyone loved it.  I made two, one with a pastry crust & one with a gluten free pastry crust.  I read the reviews and thought about modifying it so it wasn't too sweet, but didn't and there are no left-overs.  Bummer!!  I'll be making another one in the next week.  YUM!!!

This pie didn't last long in my house but even so, the next time I make it I'll tweak it a bit.  I'm going to use less sugar next time.  I had some plain vanilla cookies that I wanted to use up so I made a crust with them using the same method as for a basic graham cracker crust except without adding more sugar.  Result was very good.  Used the trick of chilling the pie crust before brushing with egg yolk.  That worked well.  This pie has great eye appeal.  The colour is amazing.  With strawberries fresh from the garden, what could make a better dessert in early summer?

I made this with a homemade flaky pasty crust instead of the graham cracker, just a personal preference. The filling is AMAZING!  I tried it for the first time less than a month ago and have already had to make six of them!  My family and husbands co-workers have been demanding them every time I see them.  I have finally found my staple strawberry pie recipe, thank you!

I bought strawberries on sale the other day, but they were out of the "glaze" I mix with them for our traditional Strawberry shortcake. I simply made this glaze for the strawberry pie recipe. I needed to add a little water to thin out the glaze after it had setup. I also used sugar-free gelatin. Very good! I will never buy the store glaze again!
