Nothing super fancy, but it is a great base for creativity.  I added some pepper to spice this up a bit.  Next time I may add some diced red peppers and experiment more with spices.  My husband took a bite and said "This is good..... Mm... this is really good!"

This is easy and delicious. I used prepackaged, pre-cooked Perdue grilled chicken strips, heated them up, and added the soup and other ingredients. When everything was ready, I mixed the pasta into the chicken and sauce. It was perfect.

This recipe is fast and simple to prepare, but very tasty.  I added sauteed onion, celery and sweet pepper, and also some ground black pepper.  Next time, I think I will try increasing the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp.  We served this over brown rice and it was very good.  A definite keeper!

I was quite amazed at the ease and tastiness of this.  I wasn't so sure I would like the tomato soup aspect...but combined with the garlic powder and basil, it had a nice subtle taste.  And come on...it is so easy!   I chopped the chicken into small pieces for quickness of cooking and ease for the kids, and served it on top of the pasta.  Both the 5 & 8 year olds ate it up (always a surprise when they both like it).  In fact the 8 yr old went and got herself some extra.  (The biggest kid liked it too.)  I might have added a bit more garlic powder for my taste, but as kids taste buds are often more subtle - I can just add it for myself.  Easy and good.  Go for it.

I needed something quick for dinner last night so I gave this receipe a spin and I was plesantly surprized.  I thought that it would turn out bland and would need to be doctored up a bit, but it worked out of the box.  This was quick to prepare and the kids enjoyed it.  I used fresh basil instead of the dried becuase that's what I had on hand.  This recipe will be a player in the rotation.

For a fast, cheap, dinner, this has pretty good potential.  It definately needs some jazzing up as the other reviews have stated, but for a busy night, you can't really beat this.

Good recipe if you are short one time and ingredients - but definitely needs more flavor.

This was quite bland, although I added some chives and pepper to it. Also, Chicken breasts had to simmer in soup mixture for 20 mintues to be cooked thoroughly. Not a keeper for my family.

It was good, but I would say it was delicious. I thought it was sort of bland. I ended up pouring some of the extra sauce over the chicken to give it more. I added some extra pepper, and it was still a bit blah. It's definitely something easy and I will make it again - but with some modifications.

Did not like this at all. Could have been that the parmesan I used was not good quality, I don't know.

Great Recipe!  Easy, quick and delicious.  I used the leftover sauce for the noodles, which I pre-cooked earlier in the day and this turned out to be a one pan meal that my husband and 4 year old loved.  Will definitely make this again!

Super easy and delicious was even a hit with the kids.  The Ziti was great topped with the leftover sauce.  I paired it all with a nice salad

This sauce was great for how simple it was to make. I added a bit more garlic powder, and pepper. I'll definitely be making this dish again! Delicious!
