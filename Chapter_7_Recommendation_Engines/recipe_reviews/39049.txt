This was the hit on Thanksgiving.  I was nervous after I read the negative review, but this was light, creamy and delicious!  I kept it in the freezer for 5 hours, but then I refrigerated it overnight and it was still fine for serving.  I will make it again and again.

I have been making this recipe for years! I love it because it is simple and very tasty. I have never used the raspberries in this recipe, or frozen it. I sometimes vary the spices, I have even used a regular baked shell(crust). I make several pies one or two days before the Holidays. Freezing the pie would give you an opportunity to make these pies well in advance of the Holidays, but I would make sure that it is completely thawed out before serving it. This is the best pumpkin pie I've ever tasted, but forget that for a minute, this is the easiest pumpkin pie I have ever made, it's a great time saver!

My coffee group loved this pie. This is a really good pie but I don't have room to freeze. So I did add an extra instant pudding and used only 1 cup of whip topping folded in. It was firm enough to cutand nice  light chiffon texture. This
pie has a mild pumpkin flavor; not like a baked pie which is intense in flavor.
I didn't use pumpkin pie spice. I prefer using 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon each nutmeg, ginger and 1/8 teaspoon cloves.

A big thumb's down on this one.  First of all, I don't think freezing is necessary.  Secondly, my husband took one bite and threw it away.  I didn't care for it too much either, I didn't finish my piece.

The consistancy of this turned out to be like melted whipped topping.  I am not sure what I might have done wrong, but I am sure it wasnt meant to be like that.  

It did taste delicious though!  I used cheescake pudding instead of vanilla, and a shortbread crust instead of graham.  Still, niether of those changes would have caused a runny pie :).

I found that the original recipe from Nestle calls for Evaporated Milk, so I used one cup, plus  little extra, since I had vanilla and butterscotch pudding mixes of only 3.4oz each that I decided to go with, along with a little extra pumpkin.  Since many reviews called this pie watery, I also left the whipped topping amount at 1.5 cups stirred in.  Even after thawing in the fridge, it was still very frozen.  The pie was well recieved by family, with some second helpings.  We are storing the leftovers in the fridge and will see how that goes.
