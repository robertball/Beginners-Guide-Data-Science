Wonderful soup recipe!  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs in the meatballs, and substituted approximately 25% lean ground beef for sausage in the meatballs (75% sausage, 25% ground beef).  I baked the meatballs for 20 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except for that small change and the soup turned out great.  Rave reviews from all at the potluck luncheon I prepared the soup for!

I have a TNT wedding soup recipe, but thought I would give this a try since I had chorizo sausage in the freezer.  For the meatballs I used 1/2 lb ground sirloin and 2 links chorizo.  Since the chorizo is pretty fatty I only used about 1/3 cup breadcrumbs, and added some parm to the mix.  These formed beautifully.  A little time consuming sauteing the veg, removing, browning the meatballs, and preparing the orzo separately, but the flavor of this soup was outstanding.  Thanks for sharing.

Oh yeah baby..good stuff!   

I "accidently" made the meatballs quite spicy; was short about 1/4 C. on the regular bread crumbs and remembered that I had some spicy Japanese panko bread crumbs, so I added those.  Pretty good mistake!  After that, I decided not to add the
spice to the broth, thought it would be too much flavor "fighting" and I think it turned out just fine that way.

With the spinach, I cut the stems off and stacked several leaves together, rolled them up cigar fashion and cut them into ribbons.  A little extra work, but I think spinach looks nicer that way in soup.

Great tasting soup.  I used a bit more spinach than called for. Due to the meatballs it was a filling soup and can be used as an entree with a load of home baked bread.

I doubled the recipe, but kept the spices the same and even reduced the fennel seed to 1 tsp. Two tsp. seemed like it would overpower the soup.  I also added extra veggies and used regular sausage instead of Italian sausage since the kids don't like Italian sausage.  It turned out to be quite a hit, and the whole family loved it.

Great soup for those chilly days.  I subbed ditalini for orzo since that was the smallest pasta I had on hand and added some salt to taste.  Will be making this again!

I halved the meatball recipe along with the chicken stock and orzo, yet kept everything else the same. This made for a flavorful, very traditional Italian Wedding Soup, restaurant worthy. Thank you, Johnsonville!

Love this recipe! I made it last night and my husband loved it. The best part is that I made it gluten free. Yum! To make it gluten free, I used gluten free bread crumbs for the meatballs.  Then I didn't add the orzo but gf elbow noodles instead.

1st soup I ever made from stratch it was delicious n I am not a huge soup fan. Family rated it a 10 star.. Used Italian sausage Hatfield and only 1/2 cup breadcrumbs..  I baked meatballs also n premade orzo before hand..didn't use a lot of cayenne pepper n didn't use fennel at all. Instead used Italian seasoning instead of just parsley n other different herbs. Also used 3 bay leaves as well.

Use 1/2 each chicken and veggie broth. Use meatball nirvana recipe for meatballs. Use small (not tiny soup pasta though) shell pasta rather than orzo. Use full bunch of spinach. Add small diced zucchini with center scooped out.  Used fresh bread crumbs and variety of fresh Italian herbs.  Once veggies cooked, add meatballs with the broth. Add uncooked pasta with spinach near end to avoid overlooking pasta. Add couple dashes of worcheshire sauce.

This is great!  I replaced the cayenne pepper with 2-3 times the amount paprika but left the other ingredients in tact.  I'm not sure what is meant by "marble sized" but I made mine all about an inch across and 14-15 grams (.45-.50 ounces) and they seems to come out properly cooked.  I don't think I waited for the onions to brown but just start to turn brown, typically around 8 minutes.  Keeping the sausages in the refrigerator until you form the balls makes it real easy form them to stay firm.  I also used a normal curved plastic spatula, rubber or silicone is not needed.  Just do not use a flat one.  I think I let it simmer pretty long.  Maybe a half hour?  I also garnished after serving rather then in the pot, as implied.  The fennel comes through perfectly one the first day but was not so present a few days later.  Serve it the same day as made.

Very easy to make soup and recipe can be converted for the crockpot. I made my own chicken broth instead of using canned. Baked my meatballs at 350 for 20 minutes and then added to the crock pot. About 2 hours before eating added orzo to the crockpot (on warm) . Before serving I stirred in baby spinach. Since I was using baby spinach I did not chop it up.

Good! I for the most part stayed with the original recipe until it was finished. I thought it lacked depth of flavor so I added a large Tbsp. of fresh (frozen in olive oil) basil and 1 1/2 tsp. salt which produced a better fuller flavor. I did decrease the bread crumbs in the meatballs to about 1/3 cup and I added a wild rice mix instead of the pasta and finally I added more carrots and celery. Personally I prefer "Italian Sausage Soup with Tortellini" much better.

Loved it!  I decided to bake my meatballs in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes, just to firm them up and keep them from crumbling.  Don't be tempted to add salt to this soup, as it is salty enough with the chicken broth and sausage.  I also used acini di pepe instead of orzo.  It's a small pasta, that looks more like traditional Italian Wedding Soup.  I did have to add a bit more water than called for as well, just to increase the broth to "stuff" ratio. My Italian hubby loved it too.  It's a "do again" recipe, for sure!

Very tasty! We added beef broth along with the chicken broth. We made the meatballs bigger than marble size just because it was easier.

Wonderful! It was a cold & rainy night last night and I was looking for a soup recipe. I've had this canned before and loved it so decided to give it a try. Used the Johnsonville Mild sausage (which I ALWAYS have in my freezer!) and increased the cayenne to give it a bit more bite. Used a bit less of the fresh ground fennel seed and added a small amount of chopped fresh fennel bulb with the celery. Right at the very end I added about 1/4 cup of lemon juice to "brighten" the flavors. To serve I placed a serving spoon of the orzo in the bottom of a bowl, topped it with a handful of chopped fresh spinach and then ladled the soup on top of it. It was so good that no one in my family said a word for the longest time. They were too busy eating!!! Definitely added to my recipe box!

My only complaint is how long it took me to make all of those puny  little meatballs! Next time I will make them  in advance. The soup turned out quite good so it will be worth the effort.

It would get 5 stars, but I used a different recipe for the meatballs to cut down on the fat.  The soup itself is wonderful!

Loved it!  I did the meatballs with 1/4 90% ground beef though.  Hleped cut the grease a little.  Got a lot of compliments on it.
