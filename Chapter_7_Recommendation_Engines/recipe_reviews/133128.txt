This was really good!  I did make a few minor adjustments.  The family demanded that I not add the cayenne pepper.  I had medium shells instead of penne so I used them.  The portobellos I sliced into medium thick strips and I had a jar of roasted red bell peppers that I used instead of fresh.  Everyone loved this dish!  One thing to note, I have yet to find alfredo sauce that isn't salty so don't add any salt until you've tasted it just before it's ready to plate.  Mine didn't need any because the salt in the alfredo sauce was enough.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks to the original poster.

Absolutely easy and fast recipe to prepare that has wonderful flavors.  Even better the next day when the flavors have had a chance to marry.  Used a combination of red and green bell pepper for additional color and added an additional 1/4 cup of fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  Thanks Jzeller for submitting this recipe.

This was a great recipe! I made a few changes only because I didn't have all the ingredients. Instead of shrimp I cooked chicken seperately in salt and pepper and then cut into strips and served over the pasta. I used parmesan cheese instead of Romano, and added chopped spinach instead of mushrooms as I don't like mushrooms. It was absolutely delicious! My husband never goes back for seconds, but with this he went back for thirds!

Absolutely delicious.  I modified the recipe a little bit (with apologies to the creator!).  I cut out the oil entirely.  Used 1/2 of the red pepper and onion.  Used button mushrooms.  Finally, I used fat free half-and-half in place of the cream.  This receipe was OUTSTANDING.  Hubby and son said it was as good as anything you would get in a restaurant (and I agreed).  There wasn't a scrap left!

I made this recipe for my family and we all LOVED it so much!!! We all agree it is worthy of being on a menu at any wonderful Italian (or any) Restaurant! We added scallops to ours and it was DELICIOUS! I hope more people try this recipe. I printed it out and lost it... I looked through about 100 recipes before I finally found it again. (I was looking for fettuccini) THANK GOODNESS I FOUND IT! IT WILL BE TREASURED!

WE loved this recipe. Followed exactly using 1/2 and 1/2 and all e.v.o.o. The baby bellas and sweet red bell added so much to this alfredo mixture. We also used cooked thawed shrimp instead of fresh cause thats what I had. We'll be having this again!!

Why buy alfredo ready made? Its simple to make and tastes better when home made! Now it is a five star.

This was awesome.  I made it two weekends in a row.  The first for friends so I cut the cayenne to 1/2 tsp.  Had to cook in someone elses kitchen so not perfect (looking!) but yummy.  One of my friends made a comment again about it last night. Made it again for hubby tonight.  He loved it!  Wanted a little firmer mushroom so I used Baby Bello's and still kept the cayenne to 1/2 tsp so as not to overpower the rest of the flavors.  Definately a favorite for me!

One of the top dishes I've ever made, and I've made hundreds.

Followed the recipe exactly, except I used whole milk instead of cream.  Turned out incredibly delicious.

I learned a recipe very much like this one from a friend, so just for the record a good variation is to substitute about 3/4 a cup of tomato sauce for the cream.  It makes it into a rose sauce, and really complements the ingredients.  For this variation, I would leave out the cayenne, and and button mushrooms would work too.

This is a really great recipe. I added red pepper flakes to the butter when added shrimp. This is one of my most requested dinner recipes. Thanks for sharing.

This really was a fantastic dish.  My family, including the four kids, really liked it.  The only thing I did differently was instead of using penne pasta, I used fettuccini.  We will definitely be making this a regular in our meal rotation.

I just made this for the first time the other day.  It turned out great!   Instead of using Shrimp, I grilled some chicken, cut it into slices and laid it ontop of the Penne Alfredo.   It was really good.  We enjoy a little spice in our food, but my 8 year old thought this was too spicy.  So if you are making it for sensitive tastebuds, you might want to omit the cayenne.

This dish is so wonderful and easy. It is such an upgrade from the traditional alfredo. However, if young ones are going to also be enjoying this dish, I would suggest cutting the cayenne pepper down to about 1/2 tsp, otherwise leave it alone if you like a bit of spice. This recipe is a keeper :)

This recipe is awesome! I made a few changes: 1) I didn't use garlic and mushrooms. I couldn't find romano cheese in the supermarket (most likely I didn't look hard enough) so I used a 4-cheese alfredo sauce (contains romano, parmigiano, provolone and ricotto) instead. Everything turned out great!

Super duper yummy!! Creamy sweet and shrimp mmm.  I made it almost according to recipe; I used fat free evaporated milk instead of cream (I know, it's Alfredo, but I'm trying) and I was afraid of over cooking my shrimp so I sauted it separate and threw it in at the end.  I was apprehensive because its making a sauce with jarred sauce but it's my new favorite thing with shrimp!

We liked this recipe a lot but think next time I will use a 4 cheese mix from my deli instead of only Romano and for a more striking presentation I will remove the shrimp from the pan before adding the remaining ingredients and place the shrimp on top plate by plate.

I loved this! I followed the recipe very closely, although I did omit the cream. It just didn't seem like a necessary ingredient considering I had already used a jar of alfredo sauce. It had a very good flavor. It was kind of cross between Stroganoff and alfredo as it did have a strong mushroom flavor. Don't be turned off by the color the sauce turns after adding the mushrooms. It didn't look very appealing, but it was very good.

My family and I love this recipe, the only thing I do different is add a clove or 2 more of garlic, and make homemade alfredo sauce, makes it more creamier instead of thick like canned alfredo....yummmm

this recipe has been a hit with friends and family.  The first time I made it with the small frozen shrimp from the market.  The second and third time, I made it with fresh jumbo shrimp from a specialized seafood shop and it was amazing!  Don't skimp on the shrimp!!!  ;-)

mmmmm!!! So good, better than a restaurant! The only change I made was substituting frozen precooked shrimp for fresh but it was delicious!

AMAZING!! This is by far my favorite recipe I have made from this site so far. I don't usually give reviews either but this is worth it. It was so delicious and easy to make. I actually had to prepare most of it while holding my one year old. : ) The only changes made were I used parmesan instead of ramano and canned portobello mushrooms instead of fresh because I live in Japan and fresh produce, especially mushrooms are WAY expensive. But this was still great either way. Definite keeper!! I could eat this every week.

I loved this recipe! I followed all instructions with only one modification. I used sriracha instead of cayenne pepper because I was out. I will definitely make this again!

Wow! This is the first recipe that my husband agreed deserved 5 stars. This was easy to prepare, had great taste, made a large serving and I only used 2 dishes! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I did take the most helpful comment's advise and tasted it before adding salt and it did not need it for the Alfredo sauce was salty enough. Thanks for the great addition to my favorite meals!

I don't usually like shrimp, but I liked this recipe!  I did everything according to the recipe, except I left out the mushrooms.  Also, I cooked the pasta last instead of first - otherwise, it gets hard before the sauce is done.  Overall, very tasty and super easy!

This was so good! The first night I made it, though, I felt it was too rich although my boyfriend loved it. However, after adding more pasta to the leftovers it was just the right consistency for me.

This was soooo good! I rarely try the recipes that call for alfredo sauces, butter, heavy cream, etc., but we are 82 years old and I thought what the h...! I used 1 less tbsp. butter, 1/2 red and 1/2 yellow pepper & button shrooms 'cause that's what I had and 3/4 tsp cayenne. It was perfect. Good enough for entertaining. Also, have enough for another meal, which is great for me.

The only reason why I did not like this recipe is because it used for jar alfredo sauce. To me because of that it tasted just like the jar alfredo sauce.

I rated this 5 because it was an awesome dish. However, in my opinion,the 1 tsp Cayenne is way too much..I only put 1/2 tsp and it was still too much.

Easy to make! I can't pinpoint what else needs to be added to the recipe but it seemed kind of bland during the bites. You get the subtle cayenne pepper taste after but I would have preferred a little more flavor. Maybe I will add some seasoning salt or something next time. Will make again though!

This was VERY good. Had great flavor, I think it was a little too peppery for us though. Next time I will use less black pepper. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was AWESOME!! I accidently left out the butter and just used olive oil and probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Also used entire 16oz box penne. I rarely measure and I added more cream and romano cheese to make more sauce since I was using more pasta. Add in the lazy factor and I used frozen shrimp.. just defrosted and pulled off the tails. Also used about 2 bulbs of roasted garlic.. we love garlic. My boyfriend ate it like crazy! Even ate the rest off of my plate that I couldn't finish. Thanks for this recipe! I will make this often.. it was super easy also.

I would really give this recipe a four and a half but I just don't think its a five.  The five star recipes I try on this site knock my socks off. Although this recipe is very good, and definatly one that I'll make again I don't believe it should be ranked as one of the "Grand Daddies". If your debating about it make it.  It's relatively easy and good.  It is very good on top of crackers as well.

Outstanding. Tastes like something from a gourmet Italian restaurant. I skipped the cream. I used a "light" alfredo, and with the mushrooms and shrimp, there was just the right amount of liquid for a balanced sauce.

This was a hit! Came out restaurant quality pasta. Used what I had in pantry so substituted: Parmesan (Romano cheese), Half-Half Cream (Full Cream), EVOO (Butter+EVOO) Big plus= very easy and cooking/prep time is short.  Perfect dinner after work.

This recipe is ok, and edible.  The ingredients do not really "go" together.  It needs more garlic and cayenne than the recipe calls for.  I started with the amount listed and then added another 1 tsp garlic and 1/4 tsp cayenne, and could add even more.  Also, the sauce is very runny, and gets runnier overnight as leftovers sit in the fridge.  The cream is probably not necessary. Will not make again.

I feel very comfortable giving this 5-stars because even though it's base is a jarred sauce (I used Bertolli) the added ingredients take it to a new level. I made a few substitutions (out of necessity) such as angel hair pasta, white button mushrooms, half of the onion & 1 extra clove of garlic (I guess that wasn't out of necessity but glad I did!), parmesan instead of romano, milk for cream & 1/4 tsp. cayenne...A delicious meal that was easy to prep & quick to the table. My husband, our friend & myself all enjoyed! (By the way, we served with a green salad & caprese/garlic bread & in my opinion this meal would easily serve 8).

I made this as is and it is awesome.  I made it a second time and trying to cut down on the fat a little bit by only using 1T of olive oil instead of 2, 3T of butter instead of 4 and a mix of light sour cream and 1% milk to equal 4 oz instead of the cream and it tasted the same to me...just as good as the original version.

This was great!! We did not have some of the ingredients such as red bell pepper,mushrooms or cream. Yet this was great!! Added a little lemon pepper, oregano and Italian seasoning for a delicious flavor, Yumskiddy.

This is one of our favorite dishes, every time I make it for someone they ask for the recipe! I usally make some with shrimp and some with chicken since my husband prefers chicken. I prepare the chicken the same way as I prepare the shrimp. Thank you for such an easy and yummy dish!

Delicious recipe.  Only modification I made was I added more veggies (carrots, broccoli) and I made my own Alfredo sauce instead of using store bought.  It was a big hit at my house!

mmmm!  Didn't have fresh peppers on hand so I used roasted ones in a jar and it worked just as well.  I enjoy a lot of heat in most of my dishes but I would use about half the recommended cayenne because it overpowers the dish otherwise.

I read all the great reviews so decided to make this dish for company. Everyone loved it! I did not use the cream and cut the cayenne pepper in half, but next time will use the full amount. I will make this again real soon. Very good!

I didnt think this was anything special. Perhaps the flavor of the alfredo sauce I used wasnt to my liking. Also, I omitted the cream, as it didnt seem necessary at all.

To me this is one of those recipes that is good the first time, not so great for left overs the next day, and not really one I'd want to make over and over.  It's just okay.

I love this recipe. I made 2 versions: One with with bell peppers and mushrooms and one without...because my bf doesn't like them. It was delicious either way. I used half the amount of cayenne pepper, and it was really spicy. I love spicy food, but any more would have been too much. TY for the recipe.

I made this without shrimp because my boyfriend is allergic and it was still delicious! I added brocoli, which I find to be delicious with alfredo. Delicious, delicious, delicious! No wonder it's one of the top recipes on here! I will make it again for myself with the shrimp :)

My husband and I both love this recipe.  Best results when I use Bertolli's peppered alfredo sauce.  I've also used with scallops, would also work with chicken.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would! Easy, yummy and really made alot! I have plenty of leftovers for a few days, and I can enjoy it over & over! I followed the recipe exactly, except I forgot the cream, so I just used milk I had on hand (1%) and I don't like onions, so we didn't add the onions.

wow!  this is AMAZING!  I've been trying a lot of new recipes lately & this one is going into our monthly menu box.  i forgot to add the salt & pepper, but that's perfectly fine, it was wonderful without it.  has a nice zing to it because of the cayenne pepper, so i would add less if you don't like spicy food.  wonderful recipe & everyone should give it a try!

Very very tasty! I am not a fan of mushroom, so I also replaced it with spinach. I liked this especially because it didn't take long at all to make, but tasted like it did. Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved this.

Only changes I made was to add half the cayenne and one very large chicken breast cut into strips. 

Yum, thanks for this recipe.

Very Good and Easy to make.  Next time I am going to substitute Chicken Medallions for the Shrimp.  Thank You for the recipe.  It is a keeper.

Not sure how fair this review will be but I made it as in the recipe except I used ground mild Italian sausage instead of shrimp (don't like shrimp) 1/4 tsp. cayenne, and whole milk (didn't have cream). It was easy to make and fabulous! My husband said he wasn't "that hungry" but ended up scarfing 3 bowls of this. It will be added to the regular dinner rotation. May try it next time with some homemade Italian bread. Very good!!!!

I give this five stars for my family.  We had my family over for dinner at our new place, and they RAVED about this recipe.  I used a homemade alfredo sauce with it, and it turned out wonderful.

Fantastic recipe! I'm definitely a novice cook, and this recipe was simple, straightforward, and most importantly - TASTY!  We didn't have cayenne paper so I replaced it with some crushed red pepper. Hubby went back for thirds!

There are only three in our family and I needed to double this the second time I made it. Wife and daughter just loved it. My wife never liked Alfredo dishs before this one. I used the 3 cheese sauce.

To cut down a bit on the calories, you can use Half & Half instead of cream; maybe less of it so the sauce isn't too runny.  Cut back on the cheese and it won't be so salty-tasting.  I also have used jarred roasted red peppers PLUS jarred artichoke hearts and diced tomatoes.  Whole wheat pasta makes it healthier too.  We love this dish!

Having found this recipe, I make this all the time! You can add all kinds of vegetables alongside or instead of the bell pepper - green beans and crunchy broccoli work really well. Also, a mixture of red and yellow bell pepper make for a visual feast. Absolutely delicious, and so easy!

This recipe was GREAT!!  I used a whole box of pasta and 2 jars of sauce.  I love sauce and had a funny feeling that 2 jars wouldn't be enough so I had the little alfredo powder packets on hand, which I ended up using 2 of those (about 2 more cups of sauce) because I added too much cayenne pepper and needed to reduce the spiciness.  Also used baby bella mushrooms. I bought the Kraft Romano-Parmesan in the spice aisle.  I absolutely loved it!  I think this would be great with chicken or just as a side without the meat at all.  Everyone who I had try it said it tastes like it's from a restaurant.  FANTASTIC RECIPE!!!!

I am a novice and did not realize that the cayenne would add such a punch.  I found it to be very overwhelming.  Will try this recipe again but will cut waaayyy back on  the cayenne.

This was good but I don't think we will make it again.  It felt guily eating it.  Had to make my own alfredo sauce because hubby bought marinara sauce by accident.  Used 1/2 & 1/2 cream and only 1/4 tsp. cayenne which was enough for us.  We prefer the seafood fettuccine by Leslie Ann Update: made again and used canned alfredo sauce and broccoli instead of red peppers. Didn't use too much pepper.  Very good.

I followed other's advice to omit the salt and it turned out great! I used pasta shells, Classico Four Cheese Alfredo sauce, couldn't find Romano cheese so I just bought a shredded Italian mixed cheese.  I used 1/2 cup sour cream instead of regular cream.  Also used frozen deveined uncooked shrimp.  This is really tasty!!

This is the absolute best meal I have ever made. Everything was perfect. I added scallops and grilled them together with the shrimp, and it was amazing. After the first bite, my dad just looked at me, speechless, reached in his pocket, and gave me $20. Looks like I'll be making this dish whenever I need gas money. (:

This is definitely restaurant quality! My husband and I used angel hair pasta and didn't use red bell peppers, adjusted the mushroom, onion, and garlic portion to our liking. We also used an italian cheese blend instead of just Romano cheese and added a lot of parmesan cheese also. Added green onions and half and half instead of cream. Loved it.

Oh my goodness!  Once again my very picky husband said to feel free to make this anytime!  Even sent the leftovers with him for lunch.  The only thing I changed was used roasted red peppers and 1/2 a jar El Pinto roasted green chilies.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is a great weeknight recipe, my husband and I loved it!  The only changes I made were that I didn't have any parsley so I omitted it and I used whole wheat spaghetti because it is what I had on hand.  I will def. make this one again, its super easy and fairly quick.

Excellent, rich and a lovely company meal too. Have made a variation of this recipe using chunks of roast chicken and adding a can of pickeled artichoke hearts.   Also very good.

This recipe was wonderful.  Easy and delicious.  Added a bit more cayenne for spice but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

WOW! absolutely delicious. My huband was very impressed. And so easy to make. I didn't have the cream for it but it still came out wonderful. I Aso used parmesan and Romano cheese bc I didn't have Romano by itself. This is going to be the family favorite from now on!

Delicious recipe!!! I made a couple of changes by using fettuccine noodles instead of penne, 3 garlic cloves, added parmesan and skipped the parsley. I was also able to find an alfredo sauce with red peppers already in the sauce, which saved time. One tip DON'T skip the cayenne pepper! It really adds flavor

Will make over and over again.  
I used slightly about 1/4 tsp Cayenne for heat but not too hot for my kids (who are sensitive).  I also used 1% milk instead of cream w/ no missing the richness.  I eliminated butter and added spinach.  We just loved it!

Simply delicious.  Followed recipe and it was great.  Next time, will try without the mushrooms--but only because i have a son who refuses to eat them in anything.  I think the dish will be great without them, but we'll see.

Tasty! Per reviews I halved the cayenne pepper & the mushrooms. I like baby portabello mushrooms the best. Would be great with any noodles. Careful not to overcook the shrimp though. Nice presentation.

This recipe is delicious!! Most recipes I have to alter slightly, but this was perfect as is! I've even made it without the mushrooms (I didn't have any) and it was still wonderful!! It has become a family favorite! This is how I get my children (9, 5 and 4 yrs old) to eat seafood without frying it!!

Loved the concept of this recipe.  However, I made a few adjustments.  I don't care for Alfredo so I substituted Vodka Sauce (yes, from a jar).  My son won't touch anything with bell peppers so I substituted sun dried tomatoes.  I was an awesome dish and will definitely make it again.

I decided to go with this recipe based upon all the great reviews! I made it for our recent  family Sunday dinner. The wife practically crownd me "Top Chef". The only changes was I made 8 servings. I added 1 1/2 head of garlic (we LOVE fresh garlic), 1 lb of mushrooms, 1 cup Romano and 1/2 cup half n half. I loved going with the suggested 1 tsp of cayenne, However, I can telll that the wife probably would haven't noticed perhaps 1/2 tsp cayenne instead. She still LOVED the dish though. As we were eating we both said next time try adding scallops to the "party". Why stop there.....we may just intoduce more "folks" from the shellfish family as we experiment! :-) Just my 2 cents. Anyhow THANKS for sharing. BTW folks I'd suggest using ALL fresh veggies and shrimp.

I opted not to use the Alfredo sauce in a jar, but made it from scratch. Very delicious recipe and also tried using chicken instead of shrimp another time and came out just as good.

This was very good.  It was a little creamier and heavier than I expected, but it was still very good.  I liked the spice a lot, so I upped that just a little bit.

This is one of our favorite dinners.  I usually use chicken instead of shrimp.  Also, if I have time, I make my own Alfredo sauce using another recipe from this site.  Other than that, I follow the recipe and we have an excellent meal.

This was SO good!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have all the items on hand so I used what I had at my house.  I used evaporated milk instead of cream, shredded parmesan instead of romano, and I omitted the mushrooms because my husband is allergic and added green onions instead.  The amount of cayenne was perfect for this dish, but my family likes spicy food so those who don't may want to decrease the amount. This is restaurant quality, I was surprised I had actually made it myself, lol. This is def a keeper!

This is hands down the BEST dish EVER! It's now my new favorite!! The only thing I did a tad different was sliced up the mushrooms a little bigger pieces and used about 1 1/2lb of baby shrimp.

Good, easy, and spicy! Definitely use less than a teaspoon of cayenne if serving this to picky eaters or kids.  Great as is for us! I used fettucini noodles and this was so filling.  It made a ton, so we have another complete meal left over!

Delicious! I made a few minor changes. I didn't have a red bell pepper so I used a jarred roasted bell pepper instead. Because I like them, I also chopped up 8 peppadews and added those along with about 3 or 4 tablespoons of the liquid in the peppadew container.  Didn't have Romano so I used parmesan in its place.  At serving, I squeezed a generous amount of Meyer lemon over my portion. (I am addicted to Meyer lemons.)

Finally, I did all my cooking in the microwave simply because it was easier tonight. Mine took longer to reduce down, of course, but it still turned out great and the flavor is amazing. I'll definitely make this over and over.

Really good!! I used frozen shrimp because we don't live in an area for shrimp. I only used half the amount of Alfredo sauce. I always substitute cream for skim milk. It tasted great!

This was extra Yummy! The only change I made was add 1/4 cup white wine with Alfredo and only used 1/2 tsp cayenne. That was just enough heat for me. Thanks Jzeller for great recipe.

Even without all of the ingredients this was yummy!  I used what I had in the pantry/fridge so I had to do some improvising.  I didn't have any mushrooms so I left them out.  I added an extra clove of garlic and I used pre-cooked shrimp. I also used Parmesan cheese instead of Romano and milk instead of cream.  I  didn't measure the cayenne pepper...just sprinkled lightly since my 4 and 7 year olds were going to be eating it.  It gave the dish a lot of flavor and if it wasn't for the kids I would have used the whole teaspoon.  Even with my substitutions this was a really yummy recipe and gave my jarred Alfredo sauce a nice kick :-) I served it over bow tie pasta (that's what the kids like) with fresh broccoli and sour dough bread.  Yum!

Like others, I modified this recipe slightly, in my case to make it a little more healthy - used only the olive oil (no butter), and substituted fat free half and half for the cream.  We also left out the red pepper (kids don't like it) and used onion powder instead of onion (kids don't like onion either).  It was YUMMY!!

I made this for dinner last week and it was delicious!! I made a few changes to the recipe - made my own Alfredo Sauce from this website and also did not use the mushrooms.  It had just enough heat for my liking but I always serve red pepper flakes with any pasta dish I make for my future hubby.  He tends to like things extra hot and spicy.

I thought it was great, but all four of my kids hated it.  I even got the alfredo sauce from an Italian restaurant.  They ended up eating cold noodles while I enjoyed this dish.

Very good, however I just couldn't bring myself to using a store bought jar of Alfredo sauce, have never found one I like. I used the Quick Alfredo sauce recipe on this website for the sauce, just used extra parmesan cheese in it and didn't add the extra cream, but followed the other ingredients of this recipe to place the sauce on. Very tasty, a meal all in one.

Excellent, quick recipe.  Family loved it, too.  I've used both shrimp and chicken with tasty results.  I usually make my own Alfredo sauce for this and sometimes sub fat-free half and half for the cream.  It always turns out wonderfully.  Thanks for posting this delicious recipe

I'd give this 6 stars if that were an option! My husband and I LOVED this. One tip though, if you have kids don't add the cayene pepper (or take some pasta out first for them then add the spice). I only put in 1/2 tsp and the kids thought it was too spicy. My husband and I like spicy food and thought 1/2 tsp was enough spice as well... other than that- delicious!!!! Will be making this again.

This recipe is delicious and easy to make...have also used chicken instead of shrimp and it is just as good...do not add salt until you taste it as other reviewers have mentioned.

Absolutely fabulous. The added cream and cheese help this pasta stand out as super cheesy and simply delicous. Since this recipe sounded so much like a Bertolli dish I was tempted to chop the vegies into inch size pieces instead of dice them. Luckily it works both ways. I diced the onion, garlic and pepper, but chopped the shrooms into large pieces.  Don't overcook the shrimp since they'll cook further when the cream sauce simmers, and next time I may sautee and simmer in a sauteeing pan rather than a pot as the sauce never fully thickened (but it worked out without a fully thick sauce).   I also cut the cayenne way down, to just a few shakes and it added a nice but not too powerful kick. Next time I'll add more.   LOVE IT!

This was an excellent recipe that will impress all!! I get ALOT of premium shrimp where I live down south and I am always looking for a good shrimp recipe. You MUST use the red pepper, even if you half it like I did. It still had a kick but red pepper complements shrimp and cream like no other kind of pepper. I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter except for the 1/2 red pepper and a little extra cream. WONDERFUL.

Excellent! Perfectly spiced at 1 tsp cayenne. Made as written except for using roasted red pepper strips instead of fresh and skipping parsley. Thank you for a wonderful date-night-worthy recipe!

This dish was absolutely wonderful. I'm not sure what adds so much great flavor to it, but I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and made no changes to it. For my family, it fed 3 people AND I had leftovers for the next day at work. I'm definitely keeping this recipe.

I loved this recipe!  I didn't add peppers as a personal preference but my husband said he would rather have peppers and no mushrooms since he is not a huge fan of mushrooms.  Next time I will just make one with peppers and one with mushrooms...

I used boneless chicken thighs, since I didn't have shrimp.  Family really liked it.  I boiled the chicken first, then followed the recipe.

This was fabulous! We've made this a few times since discovering the recipe. We used chicken instead of shrimp and added spinach instead of mushrooms. The spinach adds a perfect amount of taste and color to the dish! The 1 teaspoon of pepper was perfect for us, not too spicy, but not bland! I also used half and half instead of heavy cream and used less butter to try to cut back a little on fat

I thought this recipe was amazing but I did make a change - instead of mushrooms (because we don't like them), I used spinach.  In the future, I would add the shrimp at the end because they were a little tough for my liking.  Otherwise, it was an great recipe that even my picky husband liked a lot!

This was good but really heavy. I tried it again without the cream, adding garlic, fresh tomatoes, and doubling the mushrooms. I also added a splash of white wine. Much better!

My son wanted to  make a nice dinner at our house for prom date and chose this as the main course.  Left out the mushrooms - but they both loved it and so did the reset of the my family.

DELICIOUS! Only changes I made were using fake butter, not as much oil, not the entire jar of Alfredo, only 1/4 cup of cream, no peppers, and added ground flax seed. So good! Thanks so much for this recipe!

My husband and I thought this was delicious and tasted like something you would order at a restaurant. After sauteing the onions/peppers/mushrooms/shrimp, mine was very liquidy so I'm glad I drained it a little before adding the sauce. I added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne instead of 1, which was plenty of kick for us! I will keep this recipe!

My husband & friends liked this, but I think it tastes like shrimp with Alfredo sauce from a jar.  It's a great concept, so I will try to work out a 'real' version, not one from a jar.  And, no, I didn't buy  cheap sauce, used a good brand.  Not a fan....

I made this exactly as the recipe outlined, and I was thrilled!!  Next time I will try some of the variations suggested by other reviewers but for the first time it was great.  This dish is one of those rare treats that is actually better the second day as left-overs (if there are any).

I have made this twice now and both times it has come out really good... but I made multiple changes. First of all- I used chicken instead of shrimp. Second I substituted grated parmasean cheese for the romano, and whole milk instead of cream. I also used 2-3 bell peppers sliced into strips and a lot more mushrooms. I did not have to season with anything other than lots of cayenne pepper and some crushed red pepper flakes. Great recipe!

Good recipe. I did attempt to "healthify" it somewhat (er, as much as one CAN with anything involving the word "Alfredo"). My modifications: light Alfredo, EVOO instead of butter, fat-free half-and-half instead of cream, whole-wheat penne, and almost double the amount of peppers, mushrooms, and onion. I used a Parmesan/Romano/Asiago blend. I also added a lot of extra garlic, some Italian seasoning, and a splash of lemon juice. Yum! Definitely will make this again sometime. I cut back on the spice factor quite a bit this time, since my brother was over for dinner, and he has an extremely low heat tolerance. So I want to try this again soon with the heat (which I personally reallllly like) really upped.

This was really easy to be so tastey!!! The only things I did differently was omitted the mushrooms and added chicken strips as well (only because the shrimp I had on had were so small). It came out wonderful! My husband said it taste like it belonged on Olive's Garden menu!!

Wonderful! The only change I made was to roast the red pepper on top of my gas stove before dicing it and adding to the onion with the garlic. 
This is a keeper.

This was so tasty! Made it knowing that I'd have to change it a bit as my boyfriend doesn't do mushrooms. I added spinach just as the shrimp were done. And spiced it up with 1/4 jalapeno with seeds. Used parmesaan and 1/2 cup of Mexican cheese. We loved it!

After reading a lot of reviews, I cut the cayenne by 1/2. Still, it was quite spicy. But hubby 'sneaked' back for 2nds. LOVED it! Great recipe, thank you.

Might be the best recipe on this site! Made it with the Alfredo Sauce by Rebecca Swift, also on this site.  Using homemade sauce remedied any salt issues that other reviewers noted, and the sauce took about the same time to thicken as the shrimp did to cook, so no extra time.  This will be a staple in our house!

This pasta is fantastic!! I used a package of angel hair pasta (it's my fav) and it worked perfectly.  I ended up with a slightly healthier version but can't imagine it tasting any better!! I only used about 2 T of butter and 1 T of oil.  I used half a red onion and nixed the bell pepper since they're so expensive right now.  We used Newman's Own Roasted Garlic alfredo sauce.  I took other reviewer's advice and nixed the salt and used fat free half & half for the cream.  We topped with parsley and shredded parmesan - it was absolutely restaurant quality.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Quite good.  Since my family doesn't like mushrooms, I replaced them with brocolli.  Used whole milk instead of cream to cut down on the fat. Used half as much as cayenne, and that turned out perfect, the spice was not overwhelming.  Will make again!

Very good but I think next time I may put my own twist on it. Maybe use a different meat or something.

This is the most awesome recipe for Shrimp Alfredo I have ever made or tasted.  I am making it again today for dinner for the second time in 3 days.  The only thing I changed was that I only added a small pinch of cayenne because my stomach doesn't like hot and spicy.  Otherwise I did everything the same as the recipe calls for and it's beyond great.  Thank you so much for this delicious dish.  I can't wait to make it when company comes.

The Best pasta I've ever had. I had to make a few changes to the original recipe. Instead of using  Romano chesse I used the combination of Parmesan/Romano because the store did not have only romano and instead of Penne Pasta I used Linguine pasta. It turned out so delicious that I had it the next day again and my fiance loved it too. Overall a wonderful pasta recipe.

OMG - sooooo yummy!  Made as recipe is except I didn't add salt and I'm glad because the Alfredo sauce was salty enough.  I also only had a 1/2 lb. Of shrimp so I cut up 1 chicken breast and sauteed with olive oil, salt and pepper separately and then added to recipe when I added shrimp.  My 13 year old and very picky hubby both had seconds!!  They loved it - and we all loved the spicyness!!

We enjoyed this.  I was worried about using alfredo sauce from a jar, but it was good.  I think we may use more mushrooms and add bacon to it tomorrow.  I would also suggest using less than the amount of pepper listed and add as you go.  It is pretty hot.

I love this recipie . The 1st time I made it I made this exact way and it was wonderfull . The next time I made it I added a can of rottel and my family loved it .the only  thing is when your adding the rottel  you need to reduse the  cayyan pepper other wise it can get too spicy.

This was delicious.  I was afraid to put so much cayenne in it, but several people said it wasn't too much, so I did it.  My husband loved it, but it was a tad spicy for me.  Still good though.

As an inexperienced cook, I can say that this recipe was very easy to make and was EXTREMELY yummy! I bought frozen shrimp in a bag and boiled them first for about 5 minutes before adding them to the sauce and it worked perfectly!

This was pretty good. I really liked the addition of the cayenne pepper. Gave it a really nice kick. I think next time I'll try to make my own alfredo sauce instead of using premade jar stuff.

This was a yummy dish. I did make some minor adjustments- added 2 diced grilled chicken breast, as well as green bell peppers and boiled the shrimp before adding to sauce. I also used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream. This will become a regular on my dinner menu!

Great recipe, I'm not a fan of jarred Alfredo sauce but I did not want to take the time to make it from scratch but adding milk to the sauce thins out the thick jarred sauce. I only use one tablespoon of butter instead of the 1/4 cup listed still turned out great. I also added nutmeg in with the cayenne pepper, this added a slight cinnamon flavor with the spice from the cayenne and the red pepper.

This recipes is a winner, the portabello mushrooms tops it off, I made my own alfredo sauce with just heavy cream - salt, pepper and parmesan cheese.  Jar kind will not taste gourmet.

LOVE, love, love it!   This has been thrown into the rotation at our house.  I recently tried it with shredded chicken instead of shrimp and it was good too but I think I will stick with the shrimp.  Don't be afraid to add the spice - it totally makes the dish!

I'm currently enrolled in a Culinary Arts program at my high school. We competed in the Prostart regional competition back in March; however, did not place. My instructor then decided as our finals, we would have an "Iron Chef" competition (run exactly like Prostart) 60 minutes to dish out an appetizer, a starch, a vegetable, a protein, and a dessert using only two butane burners. I used this recipe as my protein and my starch, and I am happy to report that I took first. All the judges loved the recipe, and so did my family when I made it for them. =) The only thing that I changed  was the amount of cream. I recommend cutting the amount in half. THANKS! Success is a dish best served SPICY!

This is an excellent recipe, and was quite easy to prepare.  I did leave out the mushrooms, as I don't like them.  I used the full amount of cayenne, and left out the salt as advised by another reviewer. I did find it to be quite spicy, and would probably use less cayenne next time. I didn't find the sauce particularly salty, and might try adding the salt next time.  My shrimp never really turned pink, so they were a bit over-cooked, but that isn't the fault of the recipe. I did use part of a jar of roasted peppers intead of the bell pepper.  Highly recommend.

This was amazing!  I omitted the mushrooms (picky eaters in my house) and cut down on the cayenne for the kiddies, but fabulous!  Everybody loved it!  Thanks so much for sharing this one.  Definitely a keeper.

I wasn't too sure about this recipe at first because I DO NOT like using Alfredo sauce from a jar. To my surprise, this delicious meal tasted as good as the reviews said it would! I planned on making the recipe step by step, but didn't have some ingredients on hand. I used left over grilled chicken instead of the shrimp and I didn't use bell peppers. This meal was better than resturant quality!! Even my kids, who complain about most meals, loved it! I chopped all the mushrooms and onions very small so no one even realized they were  there. :) I will use this recipe often and plan using all the ingredients next time!

We really enjoyed this!   The portobello mushrooms add to the dish.  Be careful not to overcook shrimp.  Serve with toasted garlic bread (this site).

This was AMAZING.  I used whole wheat pasta and roasted red pepper instead of fresh (that's all I had).  Next time I will not add the parsley--none of us liked the texture it gave the sauce.  Other than that, we loved this!

Oh this was SO GOOD! VERY rich and creamy..almost sinful! I never thought of adding cayenne pepper to alfredo sauce. It gave it such a great kick! Awesome recipe!!

We eat this once every 2 weeks it seems like. It is great right off the stove but tastes even better warmed up the next day after all the ingredients have sat together in the fridge overnight! We make NO changes except the amount of red pepper/cayenne depending on our spice mood. This recipe is the BOMB and EASY! :-)

this is the best alfredo I've every had. I used 1/8 cup butter & olive oil, used half & half instead of cream, and spiced up with crushed red pepper and a lot of black pepper. Yummy!

Have cooked this for my boyfriend and I twice now and both times it has been amazing! The first time I followed the recipe to the letter, and although delicious, made a few adjustments for my tastes. Using cooked shrimp saved a lot of time and tasted the same as the raw shrimp (without the hassle of deveining) and cut down from 1 tsp. of cayenne to 1/2 tsp. which I thought added just the right amount of spice. Tweak to your liking, I recommend to anyone!

This recipe was DELICIOUS, I rarely give 5 stars but this dish deserves it. It tasted like something you would order out at a restaurant. Instead of shrimp I made breaded chicken parmesan without the sauce and cheese. It's got a great kick to it which we loved, but you can reduce the amount of cayanne pepper for a little less spice. I'm going to add asparagus and prosciutto the next time I make this.

Husband went back for seconds and was VERY happy. I made alfredo because it's easy instead of using jarried. I also roasted a red pepper to go in this because it's easy and really made the meal. We'll be making this again... if he's good.

I found a great spicy pasta at an Italian restaurant that I was sad to hear was removed from the menu. This tasted even better and easy to make! Next time I will make with fettuccine noodles. I did have to replace the Romano cheese with the mozzarella I had because the store did not have any Romano. My family loved it! I will definitely make this on a regular basis.

The only thing better than this dish is the leftovers! (if you can stand to not finish it immediately.) I made the mistake of not removing the tails the first time- i strongly suggest this. I left out the cream and butter to make it slightly more healthy; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. This is a new staple in my cookbook. Making it a second time tonight!

This is GREAT, but VERY spicy.  My husband and I like spicy food, but I think next time I will cut the cayenne to 1/2 tsp.  The flavor is so good and it's pretty simply to make.  I also used half and half instead of cream.

I forgot the cream so instead used milk- the sauce was thinner than I would have liked and Im assuming its bc of this one change I made..?  Other than that I followed the recipe to a "T" and it turned out really tasty.. I will make it again

This is a fantastic recipe and what I especially like about it is that you can generate endless variations from it. Regardless of whether you go with the original decadent version or prefer a more healthy approach, exchange the protein or vary the veggie, you won't go wrong. One small note, if you should need to thicken the sauce at the end, wait to add the shrimp so as not to overcook it. This prevents the shrimp from becoming hard and rubbery.

Like many others, I used what I had on hand but without compromising the integrity of this good recipe. I first baked my large shrimp in olive oil, salt and pepper at 425 degrees for 10 minutes while pasta (Rao's homemade larger penne rigate)was cooking. Felt it better to saute veggies in my double handled saute skillet using 2 T. Smart Balance and 2 T. olive oil, using only 1/2 C. of onions. I then deglazed pan with 1/3 C. white wine.  The addition of Parmesan cheese instead of Romano and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream worked fine; think I'll even use 1% milk next time because the dish was so rich.  Classico's sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce added an extra layer of flavor, and I used dried red pepper flakes to control the heat. Added shrimp and pasta to sauce before serving in the same saute skillet.  Delicious!

Excellent dish, very easy to make. Very good flavor. I changed a little because I just don't like mushrooms. I used one each, red, yellow, orange bell pepper it added a nice color. Definatly will eat again.

Yum, yum, yum, just as other reviewers have stated. I used just 1/2 tsp of cayenne, and that was just right for me.

This by far, is the BEST Peppered Shrimp Alfredo I have ever had. My entire family just loved it. I served it with a salad and I swear I thought I was eating in a high class Italian Restaurant. I have Italian friends who sometimes share their sauce recipes with me, but this cant even come close to comparing. Thanks for sharing such a fantastic recipe. I don't know if should share this when asked or keep it my specialty secret. A Definite Make Again, and no altering.  It's FANTASTIC just the way it is. :=))

Wow! Even though I had no cream (thanks Allrecipes for the substitution list!) and I had no Cayenne (I used Louisanna hot sauce, black pepper, more garlic and paprika) it was still great! My youngest went back for thirds, my husband seconds and everyone agreed this one for sure gets put in the cookbook!

Quick and easy, I'm relatively young,(15) and I had no problem making this. A few tips on making this is make A LOT. also, if you don't normally like mushroom, still try it. i don't care for them either and i found they really helped in this recipe.

This dish it a totall hit at work! I follow the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I do different is instead of Romano Cheese I buy the Kraft Shredded Itailian Cheese Mix and put almost 1 cup in. Sooo Good! I love it with the fresh cheese stuffed ravioli! Also if you don't like food too spicy I would cut the cayenne pepper in 1/2.

This Peppered Shrimp Alfredo was absolutely delicious!  Now that I have this recipe, I will never go to another Italian restaurant and have their seafood alfredo ever again!  Magnifico!  Seriously going to have this every week!

This is my teenage daughter's favorite meal, and requests it often.  Every time shrimp goes on sale, I stock up!!  

You can be flexible with this in many ways.  I'm not a fan of red peppers, so I don't add as much.  You could eliminate them if you like, but my family likes them so I just cut it back instead.  I add extra onions, lots of cayenne, etc.

I did not put in mushrooms and instead put 3/4 lb of crawfish tails and 3/4 lb of shrimp.  I put 2 onions and 2 bell pepper to really give some substance to meal.  It was a very good meal and my friends already asking me to make again.

My Husband's favorite dish to order out is a seafood fettuccine. This recipe is AWESOME and he couldn't get enough. Tasted even better the second day. I used shrimp, but you can use scallops, chicken or a combo. I also opted for fettuccine noodles instead of penne. I used fat free half and half to cut calories and I don't think you could notice the difference.

Very easy and delicious recipe.  I loved the Romano cheese on this.  I actually omitted the cream and found using only the Alfredo sauce was sufficient.  Instead of using portobello I used a different kind of mushroom since that's all I had.  The cayenne pepper definitely gave it a kick!

Very good!  I only used 1/3 of the cayenne the recipe called for and thought it was plenty spicy.  Serve with garlic bread and caesar salad.

This was really good!  Followed as written, but to make a little extra, I used 1# penne and used 1 jar alfredo,but to make a little more sauce I added another 1/2-3/4 c fat free half and half and extra romano. 2# shrimp and 1# regular mushrooms, quartered. Doubled garlic, red pepper as well. This made enough for 6 GENEROUS servings.  Can't wait to make again!

I am a pasta fan and enjoy spicy entrees also. Easy to make, hardest part was prep time. I subsited the cream with half and half and it still ended up having a thick, creamy consistancy. I also added green pepper to the recipie for extra flavor.

I make this ALL the time! I used the Classico Roasted Garlic Alfredo jar instead of plain 'ole alfredo sauce, parmesan instead or romano, and half & half instead of creme. The amount of cayenne makes it super hot and harder to eat, but 1/4 t is too little for my taste. This is so good and really great leftovers too!

This was fantastic! I'm not much of a cook and I thought it was very easy to make! I added spinach instead of the red peppers because I'm not really a fan of red peppers. It was a little to spicy for me, next time I may only add 1/2 a teaspoon but my boyfriend thought it was perfect! Tastes good heated up the next day too!

This was very tasty and easy to prepare.  I had some leftover grilled chicken so used that instead of the shrimp and my hubby thought he would prefer that anyway.  I also threw in some sliced zucchini and spinach for more veggies.  Will definitely make this again.

This was soooo good!  I had a luncheon get-together recently with three old friends and this was my main course.   It is excellent, so flavorful!  It is quite spicy and I like spicy, but I backed off and used 3/4 tsp. of cayenne and I'm glad I did as it had quite a kick.  I also made it for my family later that day and used even less, about 1/2 tsp. cayenne.  Still really good, but I would probably used closer to 3/4 tsp. again next time.  This is a really lovely, elegant dish.  My friends and family raved about it.  It is quite easy to prepare.  I made sure that I cut everything up and had it ready to go early in the morning.  When it was time to prepare it, it was easy and done very quickly.    I am craving it now.  Oh, FYI, I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and I thought it was great.  Cream may have made it too rich for me.  It was rich enough with the 1/2 and 1/2.  Great recipe.

This recipe was perfect!! I did not put in mushrooms because we don't eat them. Other than that I followed it exactly except I just put a sprinkle of cayene pepper and I also added garlic powder that had parsley flakes in it. I also added broccoli. My family loved it. Definately a resturaunt quality dish!!

mmm THANK YOU I made this today and even my father (a picky eater) realy enjoyed it --probably because its so fatty, its gotta taste good :P  I substituted the cayenne pepper with red crushed pepper which gave it a tangy/spicy flavor but i liked it 'cause u could actually see the pieces of the crushed pepper throughout the pasta! :)

This was really yummy.  I think you could add sliced or diced zuchinni or asparagus pieces.  I prefer linguine pasta over penne.  Great recipe, but high in cholesterol.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for dinner last night...can't wait to have the leftovers.  This was REALLY good!  Made just as directed-though I hesitated a bit on the amount of cayenne!  Glad I followed the recipe though-the cayenne is a must!  Thanks for the "restaurant quality" dish!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!!! I did substitute some things though, since I did not have everything on hand.  I used a green pepper, 1 tsp. of already minced garlic, 1 lb. frozen shrimp, 1/2 C. of parmesan cheese, 1/2 C. milk, and a pinch or so of red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne.  I do think the cayenne pepper would have given it an extra "kick".  This could be a very versatile recipe!  Hubby says it's a keeper!

Amazing! I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge success! I used milk instead of cream and didn't have red peppers, but it was still great! I usually don't like alfredo (too rich), but with the cayenne it was great.

After reading nearly all the reviews before making this dish, and now after making it, I am shocked no one mentioned it has way too many mushrooms.  I was very disappointed in the dish because, for me personally, the mushrooms way overpowered any other flavor in the dish.  To like this recipe, you must love them!  I thought eight ounces of mushrooms seemed like a lot, but I went ahead and used what the recipe called for.  I should have gone with my instinct and used, at most, half that amount.  My husband, who loves mushrooms, also thought it had too much mushroom flavor.  Sorry, but will not be making this again.

This was outstanding! And quick enough for a weeknight meal.  Had our mouths watering before we even tasted it, a keeper for sure!  I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp so that the heat would not be over-powering and used h/h instead of cream.  Delicious!

I LOVE this recipe.  It is sinfully delicious.  I followed the recipe as written, except cooked the mushrooms separately as my husband doesn't like them.   Its as good as any restaurant.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I opted to use fresh Parmesan instead of Romano cheese. I also used pepper flakes instead of cayenne. With the cheese and the sauce already salted (plus I salt my pasta when I boil them) I omitted the "salt" to taste portion. My husband loved it. Thank you!

This recipe was more than outstanding!  I decided to follow this recipe exactly as stated except I doubled the sauce so I could have plenty to dip my bread in (Italian bread, Chicago loaf, dinners rolls all work).  If you are someone who doesn't like a nice "kick" then you may not want to add the cayenne pepper.  It's not super hot at all, or at least it's not to a Bayou Man like myself, but it will slightly open up them nostrils upon your first bite!  lol  The MOST IMPORTANT part of this dish is to ensure you do NOT OVERCOOK THE SHRIMP!!!  I can assure you that you do not want rubbery shrimp in your meal.  While it says cook until pink and firm and THEN cook for 5 minutes after you pour in the sauce, cheese and cream, I would implore you to cook it until the shrimp still has some slightly uncooked portions, primarily pink but not all the way, and then add the remaining ingredients so once you do the final 5 minutes of cooking, your shrimp will come out perfect because keep in mind........even though you may cut off your stove burner, the shrimp will still cook for a couple of minutes afterwards since the sauce will still be extremely hot.  Use your best judgement and you won't have to suffer the atrocities of shrimp being too tough

Great recipe! I didn't have any Alfredo, and not enough heavy cream to make my own, so I used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead to make a creamy tomato sauce. Didn't change anything else. It was amazing! I don't think I'll even try it with the Alfredo, it was too good with the spaghetti sauce!

I cooked this recipe exactly like the directions said and it wasn't that good. The mushroom was too overwhelming for our family....and we like mushrooms! Next time I will eliminate them completely because everything else was good. Also, it was a little bland, I can't put my finger on what it needed but it needed something.

Just made this recipe and it turned out very delicious! Followed the recipe as written, with the exception that I used half & half instead of cream and 1/2 tsp of cayenne. The shrimp, veggies, and creamy sauce compliment each other very well. Will definitely make again. Only next time I will double the yummy sauce. Thank you for sharing!

Made this tonight for the first time. It was very good! My husband and I live in Texas and enjoy spicy dishes, but this was just a hair too hot for us...will cut the cayenne back to 3/4 tsp next time. Can't wait to make it again and will use some yellow and orange peppers too, plus chopped tomato. I used bowtie pasta and it was super!

This was delicious!! I made a few changes to make the recipe healthier.  I used only 1tbsp butter to saute the onions.  When I added in the garlic, mushrooms, and bell pepper, I also added chicken stock for these to cook in instead of the extra butter/oil. I omitted the cream.  And for the alfredo sauce,  I used Knorr seasoning mix which is a sauce that is made with just milk. I did have to use a little cornstarch to thicken it, however.  These changes probably don't taste quite as well as the original recipe, but it still tasted great so it was worth it to me to reduce the fat/calories!

Awesome recipe for people who liked foods with a little heat to it!
Had to make a few substitutions....used white sliced mushrooms instead of Portobello mushrooms and grated Parmesan cheese instead of Romano cheese because this is what i had on hand at the time I made the recipe. I'm sure if it was great with the substitutions then it will be even better with the actual ingredients. I do suggest for those who don't like a little heat in their food to use a little cayenne pepper or none at all like some of the other reviewers said.

This recipe was incredible everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I didn't add cayenne pepper. What made it amazing was the alfredo sauce it was perfect. Quick and easy Alfredo sauce on this site! I'll never pay 20 for a plate of Alfredo this bets it anytime!

I have doctored up "jar" Alfredo sauce for years without the onions and peppers. I like it over linguine pasta. I may try it with the onions as I don't care for bell peppers. Sometimes I add a can of chopped clams with juice to give it a more seafood taste. Delish!!

This recipe is probably my favorite dish I have ever had in my life!  I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  Since then Ive made it about another dozen times and did the following changes.
1.  Used 2 Onions (2 cups Chopped)
2.  Used 2 Red peppers (2 cups chopped)
3.  Since I used double of the onions and peppers I had to add another tbsp. of olive oil and about another 2 tbsp. of butter for the saute.  
4.  Doubled the Cayenne pepper to 2 tsp. 
My modifications might not suite your taste but we loved it!

So high quality resturant delicious!  Cut down cayenne to 1/4 tsp. used milk instead of cream (too rich for me). Since I'm a single, I had leftovers, even though I changed the serving size to 4 servings,and the next day, opened the fridge, and saw a small bunch of fresh broccoli, hmm, took it, steamed it, added it to my leftovers and still yumm. Thank you JZeller for submitting and sharing your recipie, which I will be so pleased to serve to guests.

Very simple and came out delicious.  Because its' base is a canned alfredo and I make many other seafood pasta dishes that our family prefers, I gave it 3 stars.  To make it a little healthier I doubled the mushrooms (baby bella) & added a green pepper & spinach.  I eliminated the cream, and added a splash of ff half & half instead.  I used a jar of classico light alfredo & a half a jar of the regular alfredo.

I followed this recipe almost word for word and it was just delicious. I didn't have any Romano cheese so I used Parmesan and I also had no cream so we used Half and Half and it was just excellent. Used a bowtie past instead of penne and was just delicious. This has made it into the weekly rotation at my house. I'm going to try w/ chicken at some point very soon and I'll let ya know how it turns out.

Loved this!  Enough that my husband asked when I was planning on making it again as he finished off the leftovers at dinner last night.  I followed the recipe except for a few minor changes... I used Parmesan instead of Romano cheese, whole milk instead of cream, and added steamed fresh broccoli near the end instead of the mushrooms (only because I didn't have the exact ingredients on hand).  I also chose to use red pepper flakes (a heaped 1/4 tsp.) instead of the cayenne pepper just because I like how the flakes look in a white sauce.  Like I said, a definite winner for us!  I plan on trying it with the mushrooms next time.  :o)

WOW!!! I can't believe I made this!!! It was truly like I was eating in a 5-star restaurant. My kids (13 & 16) LOVED this!!! And it got everyone full pretty quickly (which is a good thing). I followed everything to a tee but left out the mushrooms. Glad I did. I will DEFINITELY make this again and again, and can't wait to make it for my family when I visit them next. GREAT recipe!!!

This was excellent. It made the jarred sauce taste so much better. I took some of the other tips and used milk and parmesean in lieu of the cream and romano, but it seemed to work perfectly. I also used broccoli instead of mushrooms. Overall very good recipe and will make again!

The first time I made this, I accidentally used twice as much Romano cheese as the recipe called for, but it came out great so I do that now.  I also dislike mushrooms, so I left those out and put in some asparagus.  If you're like me and you don't like mushrooms, I highly recommend asparagus as a substitute!

This was a great dish! It has a little zing to it! We really enjoyed making it.. we sliced the mushrooms rather than diced but that was really the only change we did to the original recipe.

I cannot believe how good this was. I added half the amount of cayenne because our family can't take the heat. I doubled the garlic and used half n half to cut down on some of the fat. Truly delicious!

UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!!  I do have to say I was hesitant for it calling for jarred Alfredo sauce.  I've never tasted one I liked, but with all the great feedback on this one, I knew I had to try it!  My guys finished off every bit of the double batch I made!  I'm anxious to serve this at our next poker game we host 2 times a year.  THANK YOU so such an easy, great tasting, restaurant quality recipe!

This was delicious!  What a simple way to jazz up a jar of alfredo sauce.  I loved this my kids however found it bit too spicy, so next time I will probably cut back on the cayenne.  I didn't put in any garlic because I used a roasted garlic alfredo sauce.  Will be making again for sure.

Very tasty!  just make sure you chop everything before you start cooking to make it go quicker.  This meal tasted like something from a restaurant.  It did have more of a kick than I expected (and it was a delayed kick at that!) even though we cut the spice in half.  We will make this again and again.

This was a great recipe - my husband actually said,  "I would pay for this in a restaurant".

And he's picky!

I did add a tad more cayenne though to give it a little extra kick.

After receiving this recipe from a friend we had to try it and fell in love!  I do believe we will be having this again soon!  The only thing we changed were the mushrooms, we left them out but it was still so good!

Huge hit.  Type of pasta dish you would expect from a restaurant. Might cut back just a little on red peppers.  Excellent main dish.

Fabulous! I used 1/2 jar of roasted red pepper from Trader Joe's instead of the red pepper, chopped button mushrooms, and a little more garlic, a little less cream, and no extra salt. Other than those changes, followed recipe exactly. Wonderful - it REALLY does taste like something you'd get from Cheesecake Factory. Thanks much!

This is very spicy when you add the entire teaspoon of cayenne pepper, so if spicy isn't for you, add a little less! But I love spicy and this was fantastic!

Fantastic! I substituted broccoli for the mushrooms just because I didn't have any... the same for parmesan cheese instead of Romano. Everything else I followed exactly and it was delicious. And very easy to make. Highly recommended!

I cooked this last night for dinner and WOW was it amazing. even my pickey eater liked it. I followed the directions exactly and it was great. I didnt think I would have to add the salt because alfredo sauce is generally salty but after tasting it I did. It might have just been the brand of sauce I was using. I had a little left over and 2 of my kids fought over it for lunch the next day. Thank you so much for this recipe, it is quick and easy and delicious.

This was really good and everyone loved it. Next time I am going to leave out the mushrooms (because I don't care for them) and add something else. Even my kids liked this.

My 4 year old LOVED this dish, ate it for 3 days in a row!!!

I made it with whole wheat penne, and I think that made the dish less appealing. I am going to try again with a different pasta but really it gets a 5 either way

I made it as written. I used heavy cream..wasn't sure what "cream" meant. Anyways, it had a bit of a sweet flavor. I went easy on the cayenne cuz I have small children. I don't know if doing that plus the red bell pepper made it sweet or what. I did like it though and would try it again...with some tweaking.

The reviews said it all. My wife rated this 6 stars, the highest rating she has given out of any recipe cooked on this. I skipped the onions as the wife doesn't like them, and used a tsp of Onion Powder to help make up the loss - worked out well, I think.

So good! Everyone loved it and it reheated well. I cut the cayenne in half but think I'll put all of it next time. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

Very good.  Followed the recipe to a tee.  I would prefer it with grilled chicken instead of the shrimp...hence the four stars.  Will definitely make again...with the chicken :)

I didn't eat it cause I dislike shrimp, but my boyfriend loved it. He said it was just spicy enough and very tasty. I made it as directed, but left out mushrooms. Ick. I also served it with rotini, and a couple ounces less than recommended so everything was nice and creamy. It looked great. Thanks!

Made this to the letter.  Did not like the jar of Alfredo sauce.  Next time I may find an easy recipe for alfredo (so it is truly fresh and home made).  Yet, this was a keeper.  If you don't want too much spice- add half the cayenne.  And the mushrooms really shrink down, so us the whole 1/2 pound.  Otherwise it does have a kick which we love.  This was soo much better the next day.  The sauce did not harden the ingredients blended and the penne was much more tender.

My family loved this.  I thought it was pretty good.  It needs a little more spice to it.  I didn't use the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them.  I will definitley make it again.

so delish! I couldn't believe what I thought would be a simple 'alfredo' dish would turn out so flavorful! The red bell really added flavor to this dish. I added chicken and used a whole red bell pepper, I used the 1tbsp of cayenne b/c we love spice. I did sub asiago cheese for the romano ch b/c that was what I had. my BF was raving over this meal throughout saying how great it was. The final clincher was when he said "I would eat this 3x a week, this is a keeper!" then he high-fived me! What a way to start & end a dinner. Thank you for posting this.

YUM!! I just made this for dinner tonight and it had my husband moaning and groaning. He even said it was the best meal I've ever made. Wow! It was delicious. I pretty much followed the recipe to a T, except I used only about 3/4 of the jar of alfredo. Make sure you use the cayenne. It adds the delicious kick at the end!

Very good and quick. Next time I make it though I will not use a whole red pepper. Also, my husband doesn't like mushrooms but I love them, so I just did those on the side in some evoo and a little butter with garlic powder.

Excellent, easy recipe.  I substituted broccoli for mushrooms and it still turned out perfect.  It was a big hit.

Very excellent dish, would just cut back on the red pepper as was a little to bitey for our taste. Will definitely keep in our favorites just like something you would find in a resturant.

Made recipe but omitted cayenne pepper as I thought it would be too spicy for my kids.  The family loved this dish.  Would make again.

This was the best alfredo I've had in a long time. The only changes I made were I didn't add the cream. This was because once I started cooking the shrimp there were a lot of juices in there. So I added the Parmesan (I don't like romano) and once it started to cook, I figured adding 1/2 cup of cream would make it too liquid-y. But all in all, this was great. Last night leftovers were today's breakfast and lunch!

This always gets inhaled in one sitting.  Our 3 1/2 and 2 even like it...they eat more of the noodles, though...I didn't have cream this time but it still turned out heavenly.

This has become a regular in our house. There are so many variations in the veggies that you can do. We have used spinach, broccoli and cauliflower.

This recipe is wonderful and tasty. I often used can mushrooms, green peppers and thin spaghetti (anything I happen to have in my pantry)and it is still great. I think the cayenne makes the whole dish yummy.

I must say this recipe was D~E~L~I~C~I~O~U~S and so easy to make. I made this for my family and they thought the same thing. My 7 yr.old kept wanting more. I will definately make again. Thank you for a great recipe.

YUMMY!!! Used canned portabellos, shredded parmesan and forgot the parsley and still love, love, loved it!! My husband and I were quite pleased with the subtle "burn".  Hate the fat, love the taste more. Thanks!

Instead of cayenne, I put in crushed red pepper flakes - a lot - and it was fabulous. I also left out the mushrooms. 

This recipe also works really well with tomato sauce instead of alfredo, and cheese.

OMG - I made this with spinach instead of mushrooms - delish!!  Also, I didn't have any red peppers on hand - but it turned out fantastic.  I'm sitting here eating the leftovers now as I review this! I also used half and half like previous posters recommended.

Sooooooo good.  We did mess with the proportions, though.  First of all, one does not need an entire jar of alfredo sauce for 4 portions.  We also cut the butter in half and used FF half-and-half.  I'm sure it still wasn't "diet-friendly" by any means, but it was delicious all the same and we didn't miss the extra fat / calories.  To those afraid to add the cayenne:  the combination of the pepper and the cream made it more sweetly spicy than hot.  Absolutely delicious.

AMAZING!!! I made mine with scallops because that's all I had on hand but stuck true to the recipe otherwise. The red bell pepper seems to be the key ingredient here as it adds that touch of sweetness you never knew you were missing. My boyfriend licked his plate....I'm not kidding.

PERFECT – the only change that I made was to use my own home made alfredo sauce. I followed the rest of the recipe and it was fantastic. I ate so much that night, couldn’t stop, it was incredible. I will be making it again!!

My husband LOVES this recipe, he can't get enough of it.  He likes spicy food, and he even added crushed red pepper to his bowl.  I put in a little more shrimp than it called for, and used less cayenne but added crushed red pepper while the sauce cooked.  Bow tie (farfalle) pasta makes for a fun presentation for company.  Oh, and the grocery store was all out of any type of mushroom when I went, so we didn't use mushrooms and it was still great.  This is definitely a new favorite in our house!

Made this for guests tonight and it was a hit, though the 12 yr old thought it a bit spicy.  I used a little less butter and oil, and half and half instead of cream.  Also added broccoli.  Scrumptious!

I made my own sauce from scratch (using garlic, flour, salt, pepper, milk, cream, parmesan, colby-monterey jack, tomatoes, and sour cream) and then added the shrimp, mushrooms, and onions.  My fiance loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

I have used this recipe a few times and absolutely love it! I'm sorry it took me so long to write this review, but as I am looking at it again to make dinner tonight I thought this recipe deserve a review from myself. I follow the recipe exactly minus bell peppers since I do not like them, I made them for family and friends -- my friends who were visiting woke up in the middle of the night to eat the left overs! Thank you for this recipe!

I was a little disappointed when I first cooked this...I will definitely not add mushrooms next time, I like mushrooms but what the recipe calls for is way too much for this dish. However, after sitting overnight in the fridge, the flavors were so much better. Thanks for sharing!

Really enjoyed your recipe, JZELER.  Nice, easy recipe for a weeknight.  I used sun dried tomato alfredo and added some diced tomatoes, too.  Skipped the added cream and cheese, just added a bit of white wine to get the right consistency.  Delish!

This was awesome. I sautéed my veggies in some white wine before adding the shrimp- just a little more flavor!  I wouldn't change a thing- it's perfect! My husband and my son both agree this is a keeper!!!!!

This dish is freakin' fantastic! We ate it up so quickly and fought over the leftovers. The only reason not to make this dish is if you want to avoid the animalistic fight afterwards.

This was a tasty dish that came together quickly.  I followed the recipe as written except for making my own alfredo sauce from scratch- I found the end result a touch oily for my own liking, next time I will cut back on the butter.  Other than that- delicious!  There were a lot of different flavors going on but they balanced each other nicely, thank you JZeller for sharing!

This was very good and so easy, too!  I did find the cayenne a bit overpowering, though, and would only add 1/2 tsp. in the future.  Otherwise this was an exceptional dish and we will definitely make it again!

I made some modifications in attempts to cut calories. Omitted butter, olive oil, salt and cream because that's already in the jarred Alfredo. I like spicy foods but 1 tsp of cayenne is waaaay too much. By boyfriend could barely eat it. It was as spicy as a Thai dish. Still yummy though, Just had some extra heat. Also used cheese bertoli tortellinis instead of penne pasta. So didn't need extra cheese

My only suggestion would be to cut the cayenne pepper in half if you don't like spicy foods.  Other than that, this is an excellent recipe!

This was fantastic!!  My husband traditionally isn't big on anything with an Alfredo sauce....however, he had 3 servings of it!  I made it for our anniversary dinner and he loved it.  We both agreed that the different flavors all came together very well.  It was very simple to make too!  Thank you to the original poster for sharing the recipe!

I made this for my family and used chicken in place of shrimp for them but used shrimp for myself. It was excellent all around. We did omit the mushrooms because no one in my family eats mushrooms. Will make again.

This was delicious! Might as well go all out.  I added more cream, and cheese, yellow, red, and green bellpeppers in addition to oregano marinated diced tomatoes for added vegetable content. Yes, it is wonderful! Thanks for sharing this quick and easy recipe.

Nice change to our usual Alfredo.  I followed the recipe to the letter except to add chopped celery (gives a little more substance to the sauce) and served over cheese ravioli instead of Penne pasta.  The neutrality of the ravioli with the spice of the alfredo sauce made a great combination. Though it does add even more calories to an already high calorie dish.  But, will be making again!

I know now what I am fixing for my best friends birthday dinner party.  This is heavenly.  For all those saying there is too much salt and whatever other reason they gave for not preparing this.  You are cheating yourselves and why do you write reviews that are completely uncalled for?   Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Way too hot even at 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  I will make again but use 1/4 tsp.  Should be perfect with that change.  You folks out there must have tough taste buds.  We were sweating.

Several months later: Made with 1/4 tsp - PERFECT!

This turned out great. I made it as described here but substituted in milk for cream and let it simmer for a long while. Next time I make it I believe I will use more cayenne as I liked the spice and would have liked more.

tastes really super good, but i make a different from the normal Alfredo sauce which tates really better, ( I use for example 100 ml cooking cream and melt in it 50 gm butter, plus 1/2 tsp white pepper and 1/4 or less nutmeg and some grated parmigiano reggiano cheese) and i didnt add the extra cream in the recipe because its all ready creamy. I will try it next time on rice instead of pasta.

Great, tried the recipe w/Louisiana crawfish and it stilll rates 5. kicked it up a little bit and everone loved it.  Remember, Louisiana crawfish and not Chinese, they do not absorb the flavor.  Shrimp is great but a combinaton of shrimp, crab & crawfish will make you slap your favorite Chef.

Great recipe!  Doing the same thing I've been doing with store-bought spaghetti for years...tweaking it a little.  I'd add a little sweet peas to the mix and some black olives.  Chop a roma tomato and add 
near the very end of the cooking.  Another added wine, which I thought was good too.

Great dish. Next time I will drain off some of the liquid from cooking the mushrooms, as it made the sauce a little thin.

I only rate 4 stars due to using jarred alfredo sauce. I make my own. You can use either half and half, heavy whipping cream and dilute to desired consistency with milk. For my sauce I use half cup milk, and half cup heavy cream add it in my already cooked and drained penne or fettucini noodles. I cook over med low heat and add 1-2 cups  shredded parmesan cheese. And thats your basic alfredo sauce. but I like to add a variety of cheeses. I add (serving for 4 ppl) 1 1/2 C parmesan, 1/2 C pepper jack, and 3/4C swiss. And constantly stir until mixture forms a nummy sauce.  (i also add 1 tsp italian seasonings 1 tsp pepper and 1 tsp sea salt)

Easy for a beginner in the kitchen! I cut the butter to 1 tablespoon, 8oz of baby bella mushrooms, 2 chicken breasts, and 1/2 cup of 2% milk. Still came out great!

So delish!  Cayenne pepper makes my day happier.  I used slightly more than the recipe called for because I love SPICE!  Also, I used an olive oil sauce instead of the alfredo.  I am sure the alfredo sauce is delightful but I just wanted a slightly lighter taste.  In a small skillet I warmed 6 minced garlic cloves, 1/2 cup of oil, and parmesan over med low heat and combined it with shrimp and pasta.  The cayenne looks overwhelming in the skillet but mixes with pasta well!

Loved  it! I used whole grain linquine(sp)instead of penne! I added regular fresh mushrooms instead of portebello...They wer half the price. Used a green pepper instead of red because that's what I already had in the fridge. I added a can of diced tomatoes and fresh spinach! I used prepared  alfredo sauce with sun dried tomato.  Also, added a little bit of ole'bay seasoning to the shrimp!!! I'm a Maryland girl!!! Awesome...Love the peppery taste....

followed recipe except ingredients were doubled for a bigger 2day dinner and didnt use any cream or milk as stated per recipe. Full 1 t paprika used not 2   and the red pepper didnt really add anything except collor.Also a can of basil and garlic tomatoes were added. approx cost$25 for two dinners that served 6.Colby didnt really like anything but the shrimp

This is an excellent restaraunt style meal! The first time I followed as is and it was delicious, you really can't mess this up.  Second time around I added white wine (simmered), only 1/2 onion, no salt, used heavy whipping cream, and added more shrimp.  It was a bit spicy which didn't bother me but since I was cooking for a group, I did only 1/2 tsp.  If you're not worried about the calories, the heavy cream makes the sauce a bit thicker and richer.  A good sauce to use is Buitoni alfredo sauce, which is in the refridgerated section (you will need at least 2), and Kraft's Natural grated romano/parmesean cheese, also in the refridgerated section.  Keep in mind that this recipe can get a little a pricey if you're using fresh shrimp but you don't want to cook for a group and they only get 2 shrimp on their plate.  So that's why I went with 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp, which should be plenty.  Last but not least, make sure your pan is deep enough for the sauce, or after simmering the vegetables you may want to transfer everthing into a medium sized pot. Thanks JZELLER! :-)

Perfect meal for a college student. HEB had everything I needed, and the recipe works out so you have almost no left-over ingredients! I had enough leftovers to eat this on-and-off for about a week. My only complaint is that I didn't add enough pepper this time around! Overall, it's a fantastic dish! I'll definitely be making this one again.

This was a very good spin on boring jarred alfredo. I have to say that a tsp of cayenne was too much. My kids would eat more than a bite. My husband and I enjoyed it anyway, though! I will make again, just with less cayenne. Even with all of the spice, the flavor was awesome!

So delicious and simple! This tastes like restaurant quality even though it's sauce out of a jar. I will say that I omitted the cream and the sauce seemed the perfect consistancy, so I think I would do that again when I make it the next time.

I've been cooking for only a couple years. I don't have much confidence and have never really been impressed by anything I've done. Except for this one. It turned out absolutely amazing. Just fallowed the directions, left out the mushies (not a fan) and it tasted like something i would buy in a nice restaurant. Thank you for this recipe. Now if i can ever get a date i have a meal that i know will impress.

Wonderful recipe. Will definitely make again. Followed it almost to the T except for swapping mushrooms for spinach as my other half doesn't care for them. Also didn't have cayenne or romano so I used ground red pepper and parmesean.

Awesome pasta.  Easy to make.  I have a vegetarian wife and used soy-based chicken cutlets to sub out the shrimp for her and she still loved it.  I made it with shrimp for myself and it was bursting with flavor.  Very good.

This was very good! The sauce is flavorful and creamy, however the 1tsp of cayenne pepper is a little overbearing; next time I will halve that. Other than that, it is easy and well worth the effort!

This is a great recipe!! The only changes I made was using sliced white mushrooms and parmesan cheese instead of romano, because that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make again!

Yum.  This was fantastic!  I wish the sauce was a little thicker but I probably should've left it a little longer.  Great recipe... it's a keeper!

Fantastic! My boyfriend loves this. I try to ignore how many calories are in it though! In the UK we don't seem to have Alfredo Sauce so I make the Easy Alfredo Sauce recipe from this website and works perfectly.

Wonderful Recipe. The original recipe is awesome, and I like it with some of my changes as well. Instead of using pre-made Alfredo sauce I made my own by reducing some cream til it was saucy and adding Parmesan or Romano, then salt and white pepper to taste. I like to use spiral-shaped pasta for this recipe when I don't have penne. I sometimes omit the mushrooms, too.

Delicious!!! I made my own Alfredo Sauce using "Easy Alfredo Sauce 1" on this site. You won't need the extra cream the recipe calls for. Turned out fantastic! One word of caution...if you don't like your food a little "hot and spicy" you might want to half the cayenne pepper.

This is a delicious dish!  I cut the cayenne pepper and alfredo sauce down by half, added scallops and spinach instead of mushrooms.  I made it for our Christmas Eve dinner party and it was a big hit!! Very easy to make, this recipe will be one of my favorites!

This was awesome. I added red roasted peppers from a jar like someone else mentioned and this was excellent. Instead of a jar of Alfredo sauce I used a homemade alfredo sauce and loved this.  Very rich. This recipe is definetly enough for 4 if not 5-6. Will make again.

I used chicken instead and Halved the amounts of Mushrooms Onion and Bell pepper. I must say this recipe was by far my favorite recipe ever! The flavors are amazing. This recipe could quite possibly be the best Alfredo Dish to DATE.

Super easy recipe. My family enjoyed it and my husband said it was "simply delicious"!  I added skim milk instead of the cream, I used red pepper flakes instead of the red pepper(didnt have any in fridge).  This became a family favorite right away!  Thank you!

The shrimp was fantastic in this dish and the cayenne was a nice kick.  Didn't care too much for the portobellas (I thought it was a little too heavy for the dish) so next time i'll just use regular shrooms.  All in all will definately make again!

OMG!!! I loved this recipe.  Had to make some slight changes because of what I had on hand.  I used parmesan instead of romano and fetticini noodles instead of penne.  I could eat this weekly and never get sick of it.  One of the best recipes on this site that I have tried!!

This was very good! I love alfredo when done right, but I often find that it's too bland when made at home.  This recipe gave it a lot of rich, creamy flavor.  I omitted the mushroom and didn't have Romano cheese, so we sprinkled Parmesan on it instead.  I also used half and half instead of cream, and I use Bertolli garlic alfredo sauce. My husband and I both enjoyed it. I think I'll try it with chicken next time. Thanks!

Excellent.  I made just a few changes but it still turned out great.  I used regular mushrooms b/c I didn't have any Portobello.  I also used Frozen Shrimp that was peeled and devained already, thawed.  I think I'd like to try it with another type of pasta like Linguine or Fettuccine.  This one is a keeper. Thanks!

This recipe is wondderful!!!!!I normally don't rate recipes if I alter them. Howerver this one is worth it. The only thing differant I do is exclude the peppers( my husband and kids won't eat them) and add sundried tomatoes. You can use a jar or paste, I've used both. Add as much as you like for flavor. I also like green onions for the color and they are easier to cut up.

This was a little too spicy for me, otherwise the sauce was really good.  Here is what I'd do next time:

Half the cayenne pepper to half a tablesppon.
Add lemon zest and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice.

I think this would take away the spice and I just love the flavor lemon gives fish.

I accidentally poured in to much red pepper so it was a bit spicy and a bit overbearing of the other flavors later in the meal but it was still excellent!

I didn't much care for this...hubby loved it though and we all know I live to please. I guess I'm just a traditional alfredo kind of girl. The sauce is very unique and tasty but it's just not my cup of tea.

This was awesome!!! Everyone loved it. I made two batches, a kid friendly and the recipe as written. I omitted the mushrooms and red peppers for the kids. I am from southern Louisiana we like things spicy so it was perfect but the kids did comment that it might have been a little too spicy for them. Definitely restaurant quality.

I made this and loved it! My husband said it's his #1 favorite thing I've made and it was so easy. I didn't add mushrooms or cayenne pepper cause we don't like either of those and just added lots of regular pepper. I think it was so good!! I might like it with chicken was well!

SINFULLY DELICIOUS! This was absolutely wonderful. Good enough to come from a restaurant kitchen and presentation was nice to...but you have to add the parsley. The portebellos were devine. This recipe is great for company...special occasions...and left over! I added the cayenne pepper last (which added more color to the dish) since I love spicy and my 1 yr old doesn't. this is so good you could actually get awy with using low-fat half n half in place of the heavy cream. BTW...I used the huge fresh shrimp from the seafood section at the grocery store...even better for presentation. Make this ...you won't be sorry!=)

This is an awesome recipe!  My husband usually doesn't like any alfredo claiming a lack in taste, but he loved this one!  The only changes I made was I substituted a can of sliced mushrooms (chopped) for the portobellos, and used a mix of parmesan and romano, and it all turned out great.  This is definitely a new favorite- so much flavor you can't pass it up!

Really good recipe. I did change it a little based on the previous comments.  Like I used Parmesan cheeses instead of Romano.  I like my sauce extra creamy hence why I didn't give the recipe 5 stars. I didn't cook all the noodle which allowed it to be extra creamy and only added 1/2 the shrimp. Good portion for 2.5 people and will make double the sauce with all noodles and shrimp when I have company. Flavor however was A+.

Really, really good.  Made as written, except used only 1/4 tsp cayenne, and half and half.  I have also made it using milk, and it was still great.  Leftovers are awesome as well.

Very easy to make with a good flavor. Cooking for family, I left out the mushrooms and peppers on request. I also did not have Romano cheese, but fresh Parmesan worked well as a substitute. This was very good that night, but I think I actually preferred it cold from the fridge the next day. Excellent!

My family loves this recipe! This pasta is especially great to parties, and I comments every time. I changed it up a little by not adding the garlic, and substituting it with Dijon mustard. I also put chicken instead of the shrimp because the chicken broth gives it more flavor.

This food keeps reminding me that I'm lactose-intolerant, hahaha! But it's so good I don't wanna stop eating! Hubby even took some from my plate coz he already ate all his portion. I used canned tuna (about 14-15 oz, drain the liquid), 1.5 tsps red pepper flakes, and 4tsps dried parsley, instead of shrimp, cayenne and fresh parsley.. I don't think we have jarred Alfredo sauce from where I live (AND I don't wanna buy pre-made sauces from pouches coz I don't know what else they put in there) so I made my own alfredo sauce using Rebecca Swift's Alfredo Sauce from this site also (doubled the sauce recipe; and the sauce is not salty so you can adjust the saltiness to your liking). This will be my go-to recipe from now on! Thank YOU.....!!

This was outstanding! I think it would have been excellent even without changes, but I did make some slight changes. I used a little more shrimp than a pound. Instead of cayenne pepper I added smoked paprika. I also added about a 1/2 cup of chardonnay to the veggie mix as it was cooking. My wife was blown away at how good it was. I think the next time I will add some chopped spinach and some bacon crumbles to give it more of a carbonara flavor.

It is amazing. My husband keeps telling me he can eat this dish every week, and that is what we do. I have made it almost every week since I first discovered it. No red pepper? No problem. I have used green instead sometimes. And different kind of mushrooms too. We love, love, love it! Thank you for sharing.

VERY DELICIOUS!!! The only difference I did was add more onions/pepper/garlic and mushroom because the sauce was really runny. After I put the pasta in the consistency was perfect. Although a fattening dish, it is very hearty and I cant wait to make it again! I will probably make it again using less fat ingredients (Low fat alfredo sauce...) Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely wonderful!! I am by no means experienced with cooking; I recently started because I am at college and it's way cheaper than eating at the dining hall. This was so easy to make and the result was seemingly gourmet! I'll definitely be making it again for more people!

This was okay, probably won't make again. Maybe too much of the veggies, can't really put my finger on why I didn't rave about this recipe.I have had other shrimp alfredo's that I like better. Just personal taste I am guessing. 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper was plenty.

This is a very good recipe but it was a little too spicy for the kids. I would suggest using 1/2 to 3/4 of the suggested amount of cayenne pepper. Other than that , it was wonderful and even better the next day. At first I thought the amount of mushrooms would be overwhelming but it wasn't, it was the perfect amount. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I've made this twice, once with chicken and once with shrimp. Both times it was a hit. Live the extra kick of the cayenne...especially because we opt to make it without the red pepper. Will make it again soon. Thanks for posting this great easy recipe! :)

Absolutely delicious. I didn't change a thing, except add lots of cayenne pepper, because we like it spicy. I used 2 tablespoons. It was delicious.

Very good! I would cut the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. I love spicy, however, it was a bit too hot for even my taste buds.

Just one thing...add the shrimp and parsley at the end, and simmer just enough to cook the shrimp through, and they won't be rubbery. If you buy shrimp unpeeled, make a liquer with the shells by boiling them in a small amount of water, and add that to the onion/mushroom/pepper mixture for an added seafood layer...

Great recipe.  I thought the simplicity of this was perfect.  I followed it exactly and loved the bit of heat from the cayenne.  I like food a bit spicier, but this was a good amount for the dish.  

The only thing I'd do next time is add more veggies, shrimp, etc.  I thought it had too much liquid for my liking, although my wife was fine with it. Really good and simple recipe overall though!

I made this last Sat and we LOVED it! This is a fine restaurant-quality dish! I left out the cayenne and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. I also used  a small jar of roasted red peppers chopped up instead of the bell pepper. Throw in about 2/3 lb. of bay scallops with the shrimp and you've got a dish fit for a king. Thank you JZELLER!

Good recipe! However initially I was scared by the caloric content of this dish because I "try" to be healthy. I used less butter, used whole grain (spaghetti) pasta and cut out the cream. And it still tasted very rich. Absolutely addicting.

This was very easy but it wasn't very tasty.  It's lacking a great deal of flavor.

I had to make some changes because I was missing some ingredients...  I used cream cheese instead of teh cream, and mozza cheese instead of romano...  This was so unbelieveablly good...  I dont like pasta either but it was fabulous!!!  It was fast and easy.  I used frozen shrimp so it was pretty cheap as well!!

There isn't any getting around the fact that jarred Alfredo sauce is awful stuff. I think I have tried every brand.  The one I used this time Victoria was the lesser of the evils. It was better since it was doctored up with added cream,butter and cheese....but could have been better yet with real Alfredo sauce in the first place.By the time you are done doctoring the jarred sauce you could have made it from scratch already. Only change I made was to use less red pepper....to me 1 tsp would overpower the other flavors with heat.I also only used half an onion/think a whole one will overpower the shrimp. For the s and p to taste: used 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp salt and I had cut the red pepper back to 1/ 4 tsp for my tastes. In short: would be a 5 with real alfredo sauce so will make it again...just not with the jarred stuff.Update on leftovers: had the leftovers day 2. The sauce which had been a bit thin was sopped up by the pasta and the flavors had blended better. It was sooooo much better the second day!

OMG....LOVE!!!  I made homemade Alfredo sauce using cream, butter and parmasan. I cooked the shrimp in water, white wine, and herbs before putting in the mix (saved as seafood broth).  I put just a tab bit of the seafood broth in mix. I didn't have any penne on hand so I used macaroni instead.

Delicious recipe! Will make it again. Instead of heavy whipping cream, I used whole milk. It still tasted good. Also, I didn't use parsley.

Oh yum! This was so good! I was sure that Alfredo sauce from a jar would be like canned gravy, not good at all. With the great reviews I decided to try it anyhow. I must have picked out the perfect brand of Alfredo because when it all came together it was simply wonderful. I used more garlic and regular mushrooms because that's what I had on hand. I changed the cooking directions a bit to suit my taste. After cooking the vegetables I removed them from the pan because I wanted my peppers to have a little crunch with the soft pasta. I cooked the shrimp quickly and removed them from the pan while I made the sauce. I used less cayenne because I wasn't sure if I would care for it. I made the sauce and adjusted the flavor with pepper flakes and more cayenne. When the sauce was hot and thick I added the pasta to warm and then the vegetables. Last I added the shrimp. I was amazed at how good the sauce turned out with the jar of alfredo. It was also a pretty dish with the red peppers and a sprinkling of fresh parsley.  It is a rich dish so I won't make it weekly but I will make it often. I would be very proud to serve to company. Thanks JZELLER!

This was absolutely delicious. My husband asked me to put this in the rotation. I omitted the cayenne pepper and red bell pepper. So I really I made just Shrimp Alfredo. lol I added spinach too.

Loved it! It was great. I didn't have red bell pepper but I had green. I also ditched the mushrooms because nobody in my house will eat it. I also added parmesan cheese. Instead of garnishing with parsley I garnished it with finely chopped celery. It gave it a refreshing crispiness and even though added to the hot food, gave it a coolness to it that was a perfect counter. All together, loved it!

This is really good. I "lightened" it up a bit by using Classico's Light Alfredo and half and half. Also used wheat penne. Maybe next time a little more cayenne because I like it spicy but, overall it was yum!

This recipe is superb!!!!  I made a few changes since I needed to stretch the amount for company.  I used 3/4 a stick or margarine, a full pack of mushrooms which I sliced, 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 jars of Alfredo sauce, 1 cup cream and 1 cup Parmesan Cheese.  Left everything else the same.  My family loved it!!!  We will definitely make this again.  The sauce beats making it from scratch any day.  Thanks for the great recipe:)

Delish! The only concern I had was the color the dish turned out. It was grey in color from the portobello mushrooms so it didn't look extremely appetizing but the flavor was definitely there.

DELICIOUS!! Every person in my family liked this!! And that is saying a lot with an ultra picky husband, and 5 and 3 year olds! The only thing I did differently was to omit the heavy cream. I didn't feel  like it needed it and it wasn't missed. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and will make this a regular in our home! Thanks so much for an amazing recipe!

My family found this dish too rich for our taste.  Next time I'll substitute butter, cream, garlic and parmesan for the jar of Alfredo sauce ... the recipe is already relatively time-consuming to prepare, and it wouldn't take any longer for the sauce to be 'homemade'.  Other than that, the dish was flavorful, and I added spinach for more color and nutrition (peas would work as well)!

REALLY yummy. I used a different pasta (angel hair), used a mix of romano/mozz/parm cheese, and used a little less cayenne pepper than called for. Otherwise I followed everything else to a T.

I don't usually care for alfredo, but the alfredo flavor is really mild (and I used jarred!). The peppers and mushrooms blend really well with the cayenne for an amazing taste! I can't wait to eat the leftovers today. My boyfriend said it tasted like something he would order in a restaurant.

You could easily substitute chicken--or throw out any kind of meat altogether--and this would still be delicious!

This was phenomenal. DH said it was the best shrimp dish he ever had. I had to use green pepper instead of red and I used low-fat creamer and button mushrooms b/c it's what I had on hand. I may add peas to this next time to change it up. LOVE this recipe!

This was very tasty. I added more garlic, used white mushrooms and regular milk because thats what I had on hand. Didnt get the full 5 stars for its calories.

Would give more stars if I could. This is wonderful. I didn't have the parsley or romano (used parm), but I made a homemade alfredo instead of something out of a jar. Just another recipe off of this wonderful site- butter, cream cheese, garlic, milk, and parm. cheese. Oh and pepper. ;) Thank you to the publisher of this fantastic recipe!

Fantastic! I made this for supper tonight and my mother could NOT quit eating! She finally had to force herself. I just made two changes, okay, 3, I used olive oil instead of butter,didn't use mushrooms ( ugh ), didn't have romano cheese so I used mozzerella and okay, I did 4 changes, the only 'cream' I had was evaporated milk so I used that and it was SO GOOD! Made enough for leftovers for lunch tommorow. You can't go wrong with this dish.

This was very very tasty and had a good spice to it.  I didn't have shrimp, so I used chicken, and I substituted carrots for mushrooms.  Also, for the amount of sauce the recipe makes, my family needed close to 16 oz of pasta, as opposed to the 8 oz listed.  We will definitely be making this again!  The cayenne pepper gave it a mild kick, that wasn't overpowering.

I think this was a pretty good recipe, only reason why I didn't give it the full 5 stars is because it's very high in calories and calls for too much cayenne pepper.

This was EXCELLENT! Everyone loved this dish, and kept going back for me. My father in law even said that this is definately a keeper! I followed the recipe pretty much as is, although I could have added another mushroom and it would have been perfect. Thank you for this recipe!

I served this for company last night and everyone     loved it and it was a very easy dish to make.  Its probably one of the best pasta dishes I have made.  I did add green peas just for more color but certainly not necessary.  Its worth all five stars.

Thanks for this great recipe!  I made my rendition of it, based on ingredients I had on hand.  (I used angel hair pasta, I didn't have cream so I used milk). My husband said that this was the best meal he has ever eaten!  YAY!  It is zippy and creamy, and easy to make.  I will make this again, many times!

My family loved this recipe!  I have three teenage boys and my husband, so I had to double it but they insist on it at least once a week.  The only thing I did different was parmesan cheese instead of romano cheese, only because of the difference in price.  Great recipe.

This was simply delicious just as presented. the only thing I did different was by accident I had picked up hard provolone cheese instead of Romano, but it made no difference I believe.  Also added some feta at the end.  It is a keeper for sure!!!!

This recipe is definately a keeper! I made a few minor changes only because I didn't want to have to go to the grocery store so I used what I had on hand.  I used "BUITONI" 3 cheese filled tortillini noodles in lieu of penne and I used BUITONI alfredo sauce which I think is far tastier than any of the Jar alfredo sauces.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written and my family LOVED it.  The cayenne pepper is what made the dish.  Oh yeah, I also sprinkled crushed red pepper flakes on top of the dish because I like a little spice.

Followed the recipe exactly, and still felt like it needed a little something that I couldn't quite put my finger on. I thought it was really easy to make, and loved the consistency, but next time, I will buy a better quality jarred alfredo sauce, increase the garlic, and decrease the cayenne pepper. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Fantastic dish! We removed onions out of personal preference. Replaced the portobello mushroom with baby bella mushrooms. Shrimp was replaced with chicken due to availability. Parmesan Cheese was in the fridge so we used that in place of Romano Cheese. Light Cream was used instead of whole Cream. This is defiantly a favorite. Thanks!

Oh my god! This dish is the best food I've had in months, and I made it in my own kitchen. The only thing I changed was the amount of cayenne pepper from 2 tsp to 1 1/2. Otherwise it was wonderful. Thank You.

This was delicious I tweeked it a little and used Bertolli Vodka Sauce instead of the original Alfredo Sauce and it was amazing. The shrimp soaked up the flavors so well.

This recipe rocks!  I substitute a small box of Baby Bella mushrooms for the Portobello and Parmesan for the Romano.  I add extra cayenne because we like our food spicy.  I serve it over rice as we are not big pasta eaters.  Adults and teenage kids love it.

Pretty good flavor!  I should have put the shrimp in last because they were not tender at all.  I substituted Parmesan for the Romano cheese and it was still yummy.  I would make this again.

Excellent recipe, substituted milk for cream & scallops for shrimp and turned out amazing, dont skip the cayenne spice, it completely adds a perfect nip, I also added 1/2 a diced tomato for a slightly tinted color and flavor. Either way this is a no fail recipe, you will not be disappointed!

This is one of our favorite recipes.  It's even good without the shrimp!  Only one change, 1 tsp. cayenne is too much for us--I only use 1/4 tsp.  I use Classico 4 cheese alfredo sauce.  Absolutely deeeelicious!

I made this recipe almost exactly (omitting the mushrooms, personal preference) and loved it! I am definitely adding this recipe to my rotation. The family wanted seconds and thirds!

Oh my gosh! This was INCREDIBLE!!!  I changed things up a bit...I used regular mushrooms, and roma tomatoes instead of bell peppers and portobello mushrooms, and I didn't use all of the butter. I used 4 cheese alfredo sauce and it was truly incredible. This might be one of my favorite things I have ever made! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

My DH took this to work to share because he and the kids loved it so much, they accused me of being a gourmet chef! His co-workers said it tasted like something from a fine restruant. I have made it several times and it is always good.

hTis was excellent!  I didn't have mushrooms or cream but I added carrots, and I substituted parmesan for romano.  I also added  ground walnuts to it which gave it a wonderful flavor.  I'll make this again in a second!

This is yummy!  My husband and I really liked it and thought it tasted like something we would get at a restaurant.  I might have put a little too much cayenne pepper but it gives the dish a great kick.

Outstanding! I wanted to use what I had in the house, which came very close to the called-for ingredients. I used white mushrooms, and although I didn't have a red pepper, I happened to have a jar of sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce.  In addition to sauteeing the onion mixture in butter/olive oil, I added about 1/4 cup of good quality dry sherry (I do this often, and it adds a nice dimension to many saucy recipes).  Also added a handful of fresh spinach and a couple of Tbs. of pesto -- this added beautifully to the color, taste, and texture of this recipe. Oh, 1/2 tsp. cayenne is plenty "hot" for us.  We'll make this often.

This recipe is easy to make and the entire family loved it. I modified this recipe a little by using less cayenne pepper, half an onion, and no mushrooms (I'm allergic). I also used far less parsley; I just sprinkled it over the plates before serving. I will definitely make this again.

Made dish faithful to recipe.  Husband loved it, but thought it was very rich, it was way too rich for me, kids (teens) wouldn't touch it.  Maybe half the butter, half the sauce and some white wine would help...  Flavors were good, I liked the cayenne touch.

This pasta is absolutely delicious.I followed the recipe for the most part but i made some small changes.  I used fettucine noodles and I didnt use as much cayenne pepper.  I also did not use salt because the alfredo sauce is normally salty enough, and I use chicken instead of shrimp.  But I love it!!! and will be making it again

The onions and redpepper were a little to crispy for me.  My husband said he liked it that way.  I would have cooked them longer though.  Also used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper -too spicy for my children.  But I will make again.

Fabulous recipe! I normally tweak recipes but wanted to try this one "as it" and it did not disappoint. Don't be afraid to add the 1tsp of cayenne... I added a touch extra and my children didn't even notice.

Not much to say about this one, except that we love it!! I've cooked it twice now. ~~~The second time I made this, I didn't use peppers, but opted instead for 'roasted red pepper' alfredo sauce. In a word: FANTASTIC!!!~~~

I was skeptical with  using bottled alfredo, but I have to say that this was awesome!  You certainly can't tell the alfredo sauce was bottled after you're done doctoring it up!  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Wow, and I mean w-o-w. I made this the other day, and my wife said, and I quote: "This might be the best meal I've ever eaten." Can't find Alfredo sauce in the store here in the North Po..I mean Finland, so i made it with this Alfredo Sauce 2 recipe on this site. I didn't use as much mushrooms as the recipe suggested, but I'm sure the ½ pound wouldn't be too much. I also didn't add the cayenne (there wasn't any), but all the same - this was brilliant!

This was great! Whole family loved it.  And they are picky. Only made a few changes because of lack of ingr. on hand.  I used 2 diced roma tomatoes instead of red pepper, alfredo sauce with mushrooms already added, added sliced zucchini, and used half the ceyanne.  Will definately make again.

The only reason i didnt give it five stars is because it was too spicy for my taste. My mom loved it though, and i have noted to put less pepper next time. Other than that it was amazing!

This was a fantastic dinner! We used a little less cayenne pepper and used a combination of both red and green bell peppers. This is definitely my new favorite meal. This recipe was plenty for 6 people and there’s still enough leftover for 1-2 people. I definitely recommend this, it’s super easy to make and is sure to please. A definite 10/10 from me.

This is an awesome dish, the whole family loves it.  Better than anything we could get in a restaurant.

I substitute chili powder for the cayenne pepper and use Parmesan/Romano mix .  Chili powder adds a touch of sweetness.

And eh....I've made it at least 10 times.  It's very easy to make.

So good, but I would cut back on the butter (1/2) as it is a bit greasy and I like less fat in my food.

This is an awesome recipe! Delicious and creamy. I did  own Alfredo sauce because it is such an easy thing to do, and has so much more flavor. Use whipping cream for that extra creamy status. Also, I used Parmesan, not Romano, and included cream cheese in my Alfredo. It was a definite hit with my family, and I will definitely make it again!

I loved it, minus the cayenne pepper. I made it per the recipe and found the 1 tsp is too much cayenne pepper. It overpowers the flavors too much. I will make it again but next time I will use 1/2 tsp cayenne.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The only change I made was to sub milk for the cream just because I didn't have it. I was hoping the fat content on the Bertolli Alfredo sauce I bought would be adequate to sub the milk and luckily I was right. It also cuts down on the fat amount. Don't forget the cayenne! It is what makes the dish peppered. It may seem like a lot but it's not spicy, my three year old ate it no problem.

Great recipe!  I didn't want to overcook the shrimp, so I removed them after they were sauteed, then added them back in when I was finishing the recipe.  This was delicious!

I wrote my review, but failed to mention I used bow tie pasta. I think any pasta would be good. I also only had a half of a red pepper so added a half of an orange one.

I don't usually rate or review recipes but this was delicious. I didn't add the parsley or red peppers, only because I don't eat them. This is a two day meal; tonight for dinner and some for lunch tomorrow.
Thank you!!!!

This was my first time for making shrimp alfredo. It was fast, easy and a real hit with hubby...always a good thing!
I made it with half and half rather than heavy cream, a lighter Bertolli alfredo sauce and omitted the pepper. Despite the modifications to reduce the fat content, salt and spiciness it was absolutely delicious.

This is an excellent dish and reminds me of Macaroni Grille's Penne Rustica.  I agree with others that the olive oil is unnecessary and made the dish without it.  What's nice is the cayenne pepper goes in at the end, so if you have guests/kids who don't like a kick to their meal, you can separate the dish in half and add the cayenne to the portion desired.  Excellent and easy recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Let me start by saying that I aboslutely HATE when reviewers rate low then talk about all the changes they made!  I am not a fan of jarred sauce, I find them to be bland.  The addition of the Romano was necessary to boost the flavor.  After reading some of the reviews, I added a couple tablespoons of white cooking wine (because of my aversion to jarred sauce), and a half pint of raw pureed grape tomaoes with a tablespoon of tomato paste as well to give it a more appealing color, as another reviewer had suggested.  The recipe NEEDED none of this, but I had the stuff on hand so...why not?!  My preference would also be to add some fresh basil ribbons at the last minute and as garnish.  Great as is for an easy meal, and a great recipe to build in your own twists.  thanks so much!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe. The only change we made was adding the shrimp much later, as we like them just cooked.  I usually make my sauces from scratch, but this is a good "cheat", and certainly speeds things up. A great recipe for times when you feel like being indulgent!

This dish was delicious! I made it exactly as written except I used half and half instead of the cream and Parmesan cheese instead of Romano. When I make it for my bf , instead of mushrooms I put in sliced zucchini sauteed with the chopped peppers and onions. He doesn't like mushrooms. Otherwise, he loves this dish. Also, I used medium shells pasta instead of penne...or I use Fettuccine. Next time I make this, I will add mushrooms to a separate portion for me....Also, I will cook this with about a cup of Vodka sauce mixed in with Alfredo sauce to make a pink sauce...YUM! Thanks for this recipe! We love it  :)

Made this and everyone loved it.  Great dish, however, I did add 2 teaspoons of sherry and about 1/2 cup of white wine.  Felt like it needed some acid .  Could use lemon juice if you don't want wine.  Definitely will make this again!

Wonderful recipe!!! I have made this twice now as is and the last time I doubled the cheese and halved the mushrooms and cayenne pepper per my preference. 5 stars either way. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I made this last night and it was fabulous!  Easy for a week night dinner as well.  I omitted the red pepper only because I didn't have it in but would add it in next time for some colour.  A really tasty recipe!

My family liked this dish. The only modification I made was - I didn't add mushrooms because I didn't have any.  I also added lightly grilled diced chicken after the shrimp cooked. I served it with breadsticks and one of my favorite wines.  Next time I will add spinach to kick it up another notch.

Love this dish. I made some adjustments: I removed the mushrooms as in my house we don't like mushrooms. I also changed the cayenne pepper to pepper flakes as its all I had. Instead of penne I used fettuccine and the dish was a major success. Even for my spouse who doesn't like alfredo sauce pastas. He went for seconds and thirds! :)Will make again for sure.

I love this recipe.  I've made it several times and it's a hit each time.  I actually don't even think meat is required but once I made it with chicken breast pieces, shrimp and scallops and no meat at all.  All the veggies (I double the mushrooms and add a green bell pepper) give it so much flavor and it's so hearty.

Delicious!  Omitted the parsley because I didn't have any and used frozen shrimp.  Other than that, left the recipe as-is.  Makes a lot and I can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow!

This is simple awesome.   I intended to follow the recipe exactly, but when I found myself out of cayenne pepper, I had to improvise.   As a substitute, I chopped one large jalapeno with most of the seeds and veins removed and I added in about 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.   The sauce is absolutely creamy, smooth and  divine and you could make it any flavor your heart desired just by subbing out the cayenne with whatever you'd like.   Want more Italian?   No problem, add in basil and oregano.   The sauce makes this great and I will use again.

This is a keeper!  -- I've made this many, many times, and my family loves it.  - One small adjustment -- try sliced crimini mushrooms. -- They are usually on sale at my market.

Again -- Love this one!

This was a delicious way to use up the jar of Alfredo sauce my boyfriend bought.  He doesn't like Alfredo sauce, and the jar in the pantry has been bugging me all month.  Why he bought it i don't know ... never let a man go to the store hungry, I guess.

Tonight I made this, and it was awesome.  I added a few tablespoons of white wine and a freshly-roasted Hatch green chili pepper to give it a little bit of a charred, smoky flavor.  

Yum! My boyfriend liked it, after he put a bunch of extra cayenne on his.  He puts extra cayenne on everything, and this dish handled it well.

Can't stop, won't stop. This is by far the best dish I've had in a long time. We add more peppers, mushrooms, cayenne and cheese and it turns out amazing.

The whole family likes this one. I tend to down scale the cayenne pepper, as myself and my kids don't like it so spicy. I have tried it with bottled Alfredo and made from scratch, and it is good both ways. This is one of those recipes where you can add as you please, and it turns out amazing. I love the mushrooms and the zing that the peppers add. This is also good with chicken. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this almost exactly as written....I left out the mushrooms and red bell pepper, and used Parmesan instead of Romano (it was all I had on hand).  This was a hit! Everyone loved it. The perfect amount of flavor, and very simple.  I will make this a regular item on our menu :)

Love this recipe!  I made my Alfredo sauce from scratch and left out the mushrooms. The red pepper gives it a nice crunch with the sweet taste of the onion. The creamy sauce has a hint of a kick with the cayenne pepper.  My family loved it!

I never leave comments or rate things but I just had to rate this recipe.  It was delicious!  I made this exactly according to the recipe and it turned out so wonderfully.  I am a picky Alfredo sauce girl--I don't like mine runny or too salty.  I am impressed.  It took me about 30mins start to finish and the dish is so full of flavor.  I all definitely cook this again!

So good!! My husband LOVED it! I agree on 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. Also, next time I make it I will use broccoli or asparagus instead of the mushrooms.

Since I tried it, I have made it at least 15 times, and every time someone eats it they ask for the recipe, and they say that it's better than Cajun Alfredo pastas they can get in a restaurant.  I made a few changes, only due to preference, and I didn't really alter the recipe itself at all.

-I use Ragu Roasted Garlic Alfredo, normally 5 jars because we love this sauce and are feeding at least 5 people every meal.  Leftovers also completely rock!
-I fire-roast the peppers, skin them, and slice them versus dicing.
-I also very thinly slice the onions, and saute them until super tender, I hate crunchy onions. Always a sweet onion, like Vidalias.
-Skip the mushrooms, just a personal preference. 
-Double the garlic.  Did I mention that we love garlic???
-Double the pepper and cayenne, we like it spicy!

I almost always make grilled blackened chicken with this.  When it's in the budget, I skewer shrimp, season it with the same home made blackening seasoning, and grill it as well.  I serve with grilled crostini with olive oil, garlic, and Italian seasoning.  I'm a major foodie, but weeknights and budgets sometimes require the semi-homemade approach.  With the additions of this recipe, jarred Alfredo becomes better than home made.  It's flavorful, classy, and good enough for company or a weeknight meal.  Make this, tweak it as you wish, and enjoy!  This is my go-to Alfredo.  Totally worth it, and amazing!

The shrimps gave the sauce its sweet flavor. Be sure to put lots of black pepper for the contrasting kick. All the ingredients combined made the sauce more flavorful. Husband loves it!

My son found this recipe and wanted to give it a try.  We did, and now, it is a family favorite!  We followed the recipe just as it is written with only one exception.  We reduced the amount of cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon.  Now I like spicy food and would probably use the full teaspoon IF I was the only one eating (thus the five star rating!), but it would be much too spicy for the rest of my family.  It is still somewhat spicy with 1/2 teaspoon so be careful with that one ingredient and you will LOVE this recipe!

Delicious! Restaurant-like pasta dish. I did half shrimp half chicken because that's what I had available and we liked it...probably best with all shrimp though. I also added more pepper since I didn't have mushrooms and it was great. I highly recommend this! Easy weeknight meal.

This is a staple in our house! Fantastic! I crave this stuff! The only thing I modify is the amount of cayenne pepper. Using the whole amount the recipe calls for tends to be too spicy for our little ones.

WOW..this was DELICIOUS!!!!  Full of flavor and very filling..but I still found room to sneak a little bit more. I didn't have cream so I used half & half, it didn't make a difference at all. I also didn't need to use the parsley. I will definitely be making this again!

Made this for dinner.  A couple of friends couldn't come and we had the leftover pasta for lunch the following day.  It was so delicious.  My son asked for more although he knew nothing's left.  I will surely make this again soon.

This is an excellent recipe, I get a lot of requests for it at home. I made it for dinner this evening I added 6 slices of bacon (chopped) with the onions and a one pound lobster tail, cut into chuncks, with the shrimp. I also used tri-color penne pasta to enhance the presentation. The meal was amazing, great recipe

I changed it up a little, I added yellow and orange bell peppers in addition to the red bell peppers. I omitted the mushrooms and substituted a shallot for the onion. I also added Tonys Cajun seasoning with the cayenne and used angel hair pasta instead of penne. It was delicious!!!!

Very good. I started making my own Alfredo sauce and that really helps. I really enjoy that I can usually whip this up for supper with nothing previously taken out or planned. It has worked its way into my regular rotation of "I forgot about supper" recipes.

My family loved this recipe! I am a wimp when it comes to spicy though so I reduced the cayenne pepper to a fourth of a teaspoon and I didn't have cream so I just put a splash of milk. I also used the knorr Alfredo seasoning packet that I prepared before starting the noodles. Turned out fab and I will definitely be making it again.

My favorite way to make this is to substitute a can of diced tomatoes for the cream and to add grilled chicken and chorizo, it really makes an impressive plate for guests. And it's so easy to make, even with two toddlers hanging on your legs :)

Yum!  This was so good and really easy to throw together.  It looks really beautiful on the plate, too.  I like spicy so I increased the cayenne a bit but it was a little too spicy so next time, will just do the 1 tsp. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

Excellent!  This recipe is a great base for adding whatever you have in your kitchen.  I used the mushrooms and instead of the peppers used 3 fresh jalapenos and a huge hand full of basil from my garden.  

Next time I will add sun dried tomatoes.  I also didn't have heavy cream so I used chicken broth to thin the sauce a little, then added the cheese to thicken it back up.  We loved this!

Made it as written, except for doubling the shrimp. FAN-tastic! Grandpa said, "This is better than what you get at an Italian restaurant." To which my husband replied, "Well, it's definitely better than Olive Garden ..." But I think my husband was in a bad mood, so I'm taking Grandpa's assessment and running with it. I ponied up for a real nice jar of alfredo sauce, so I do think that's important. I served with spinach linguine and it made for a colorful, restaurant-quality (according to my dad, bless him) presentation. Great recipe, thanks!

Yummy!  I followed the recipe, except I made my own alfredo sauce and used parmesan cheese instead of romano cheese (skipped adding the 1/2 c. cream and cheese at end and put cream and cheese in my homemade alfredo sauce instead). I also added fresh lemon juice before serving.  Soooo good--my husband raved about it!

Can't give it 5 stars with jarred alfredo sauce.  Made my own with 6 T butter, 3 T flour, 1 1/2 c cream and 2/3 c parmesan/romano cheese.  Why use fresh vegetables and canned sauce?  Also served on fettuccine.

My kids really liked this recipe! I like that you add to an already prepared jar of alfredo sauce.  I did cut back to 1/2 tsp of ground cayenne pepper and it was still a little too spicy for my youngest so I ended up adding the rest of the small carton of heavy cream to help balance that out. My kids ate it great the next night too!

Fantastic, Made Exactly as the directions say- but a heaping teaspoon of cayenne pepper and whoa was it spicy.   I would recommend to go a little easy on the oil and butter and I went with 2 jars of alfredo sauce due to all the oil from the butter and olive oil.  Great little dish that I will be making again and again...THANK YOU!  Super Easy to make, I had it done in about 40 min.. Highly Recommend

This recipe even impressed my mother in law. And that is saying something. She has liked exactly 4 things I have made in the 2 years she has lived with us. My guests and hubby loved it too. I used less cayenne,(about a fourth of a teaspoon because we had some people who can't eat spicy foods, but if I HAD put it all in, my MIL and hubby would have even liked it better, I am sure. I like that you can change this to suit the people you are serving so easily...

This recipe is so easy and so mouth-watering that it leaves you craving it for days. So easy to put together for a friendly get-together. It looks like it took a lot longer to prepare and make than it does.

So easy! My husband loves this. I don't like onions and peppers so left those out, used light alfredo sauce and only had Parmesan no Romano and still delicious. Will try with Romano one day!!

I loved this recipe so much. Added cooked chicken instead of shrimp. Omitted the salt altogether (alfredo sauce already has a lot of salt in it.. can also add it after cooking for individual preferences). Was so easy and much better than just dumping canned alfredo sauce onto some pasta. Will definitely make this again! Might try it with fettucini next time.

This was FABULOUS,Fast AND Easy !  I had left over shrimp from a Low Country Boil & didn't want them to go to waste.  My entire family went back for seconds.  This is now a family favorite in our house.
I only used 1/4 tsp Cayanne pepper because I didn't want it to be too spicy for kids.  Easily feeds 4 with enough for 2nds ( 6-8 ).

This was good but waaaay too much cayenne!! I should have listened to the reviews more-->most people cut it in half. I didn't because I figured we are a family that likes hot wings so we are used to hot and spicy foods. It was too much and over-powered the recipe. I doubled the recipe because I have teenagers and now I have a ton of leftovers. I now have to figure out a way to cut the heat, so that its not a total waste (probably end up freezing some). If I make this again it will be with less cayenne

Really enjoyed this for dinner tonight - it was posted as the "Recipe of the day" and I already had Cooking Light's shrimp fettuccine on my 2-week menu plan to prepare at some point (I just list everything for dinner for 14 meals but I don't assign a date, more random to what fits our life). This recipe was easy to accommodate to and am so glad to have tried something new! What I liked was that in the time it took the pasta (gluten free for us) to boil, the rest of the meal was ready to go, plus a tossed salad, warmed bread, & table all set. One of those awesome, zippy-gourmet meals. I used a combo of green, red, & yellow bell pepper and topped with fresh basil leaves.

My daughter said it tasted like something at a restaurant. Husband said it was even better :)

Loved it!!! The only modification I made was that I added more cheese and actually used Alfredo pasta instead of the penne pasta. Other than that, this was the best Alfredo recipe I have tried by far.

I really did like this recipe! I made it yesterday for a couple of friends and they loved it. I made a few changes like 2% milk instead of cream, parmesano cheese, roasted red peppers, and spaghetti, had them on hand so why not, outcome was perfect!

I made this tonight and it is the first Alfredo recipe that I love. It taste just like or even better than the restaurants. This is definately a keeper. Made exactly as shown. The only thing I would do differently is use less cayenne pepper for my 4 year old.

Wow, my taste buds are thanking the original poster. I made a mistake and used green bell pepper instead but it was still delicious. i didn't use the ceyenne pepper but the black pepper gave it enough kick.

This was the first dish I cooked for my boyfriend -- it's definitely a cream-heavy recipe, but it was delicious.  Now, Its definitely a fav dish to make.
I've also made this for my family, my only alteration to the recipe is the cayenne pepper, it was a little too much for our tastes so I only put in half a teaspoon to add that little kick.

This may possibly be my new favorite meal.  It is that delicious!  I made it according to the recipe except I cut out the salt, and substituted for Bella mushrooms, chicken, and Parmesan cheese (couldn't find Romano and my brother prefers chicken to shrimp).  I absolutely love this recipe.  Made the full recipe for just the two of us, so I'm stocked on leftovers for the week.  So excited!  The leftovers are great :D

Love this recipe. I actually use my mothers alfredo recipe and added the pepper and things that were different. My mothers recipe wasn't that much different than this one, though. I'm sure it'd be five stars the way it is.

Absolutely Love this recipe! This was a big hit with my husband and my father. This is going to be a repeated meal for us. I followed this recipe exactly except I tried it with whole wheat pasta, added a little extra shrimp, and 2 oz less of mushrooms. Loved it!

Quick and easy and very tasty!  I made this recipe as instructions but reduced the Cayenne pepper.  I used defrosted cooked shrimps and added them at the last minute just before adding the cooked pasta back into the sauce.  I think this would work well with cubed cooked chicken which I will try next time.  Plus maybe some smoked chopped bacon.   My only suggestions would be to tune the seasoning to your liking.  Other than that, a great quick and tasty recipe.

Great recipe!  Easy and really tasty, I do season the shrimp some before cooking, but otherwise I don't change a thing.

Very tasty. My cayenne wasn't very fresh so I used Creole seasoning and it gave it some heat. I didn't use the cream at all-didn't have any and didn't want to use milk. It was still creamy and nice.
I'd serve this to company since it's simple and delicious.

Love this recipe.  I did have to tweek it a bit to match what I had left in the pantry.  I used onion salt instead of the real onion, used mini penne pasta, used shredded mozzerella cheese instead of Romano, used canned mushrooms and added a can of peas.  Great recipe thanks!

This is excellent! I made it for my brother and sil and they loved it.  Sorry, I did change it a bit, but I could not bring myself to buy a jar of alfredo when I had everything for Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce in my fridge, so I made it instead.

This recipe is yummy!  I used light cream and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and it still came out good.  I also threw in precooked shrimp during the last minute or two to save time.  Excellent!

So very good! Prepared for a family gathering in Naples, at a rental house, and had only basic cooking utensils on hand.  It was still easy to do. It was a great crowd dish. Couldn't find all ingredients at store so subbed shredded 3-type Italian cheese, frozen raw shrimp, no cream, no cayenne, only 1/4 stated portabella mushrooms (too spendy).  And it was still so yummy.  I'll be making this again back in anchorage, as written. I am certain it will be even better. Bon apetite!  Update 1-26-10...  made again halving the recipe and using only half the cayenne pepper.  Omitted cream entirely, thinning out sauce with a splash of pasta water, thawed frozen cooked shrimp, and still...WOW!!  I love this recipe, and SO easy!  Ate only 1/2 a serving, this is soooo decadent!! Made again 2-22-10 and had to use tobasco - not too shabby.

Spectacular dish! Had a little dinner party and served with AUSTAD's Garlic Mashed Potatoes, garlic bread, and some salad. Needless to say, my friends were impressed and so was I! I can't stress it enough though... use FRESH ingredients! It makes a wonderful difference!

Made it exactly as the recipe calls for except for couple of twists. !/4 teaspoon cayeene was enough. I also added a small strip of beef cutlet that I pan fried with Italian bread crumbs and plated the main dish over it.  My favorite Italian restaurant does it that way and it is great.  If you like lemon, try squeezing some lemon juice over the dish.  Outstanding!

Doubled the recipe for New Year's eve.  Got rave reviews; one guest even uttered the words "uemami" (the word for excellence when all the flavors come together).  I skipped the salt, used scallops instead of shrimp and Paul Newman alfredo sauce.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

Delish!  The amount of cayenne pepper was perfect for my taste, but the kids thought it was a little spicy.  I'll probably reduce that the next time around.  Otherwise, it tasted terrific!

Definitely a restaurant-quality recipe! I made it for our New Year's Eve dinner with hot cheese sticks and was gobbled up by my husband and son (who is really a red sauces/meatball pasta kind of guy) I just used a sprinkle of cayenne, as I don't like spicy food, but was enough to give it a great taste. This is a keeper. Would serve it to company!

Made as listed, and I think my husband is going to frame this recipe!  I was afraid the cayanne was going to be over whelming, but I don't change the recipe the first time I try it.  Turned out to be just the perfect amount.  Magnifico!  I wouldn't change a thing.

I've made this a few times now.  It is so easy and delicious.  I only used 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne and it was just the right amount of zingyness.  I've used both raw shrimp and added cooked shrimp at the very end and couldn't tell a difference.  This one will be in my regular rotation.

Super delicious.  My fiance loved it... that says a lot.  However, we both thought it was too spicy so next time I will cut down on the cayenne pepper.  (Or maybe I just added too much since I eye-balled it).  Also, since my fiance doesn't like shrimp, I also added sliced cooked chicken breast for him.  Will definately be making this one again.

My 13 year old son made this tonight and the only changes he made were: Used 1/8 tsp. cayene pepper, used corkscrew pasta, used grated Romano and Parmesan cheese and added fresh spinach to the sauce right before he added the pasta.  Delicious!!!

Very nice! Used extra garlic and less red pepper. (personal taste) I had less shrimp than called for so I added more mushrooms. Next time I will add scallops as suggested. Yummy.

I used sundried tomato alfredo sauce and a blend of parmesan, romano, and asiago cheeses. I also cut the cayenne in half and added a little extra cream and cheese. It was absolutely delicious. I wanted an Olive Garden type dinner without having to go out and got just that.

This dish is incredible! Very easy to make. I didn't have romano cheese so I just used some that I had already and it still turned out great, I also added some pepper flakes for an extra kick.

WOW! This was really tasty.  I made it for dinner last night and we loved it.  The only changes I made was to use fettucini instead of penne pasta and I used only 1/2 t. of cayenne pepper because I was afried 1 t. would be too much.  Will be making this again.

Wow this was soo good! I added a splash of milk instead of the cream and used roasted red peppers because I didn't have a red pepper and used a whole container of fresh mushrooms. It had a little spicyness from the cayenne pepper. So good will def. make again and again. Thanks

Oh my goodness, this was yummy, yummy, yummy! I made it as it was written with the only exception being that I used parmesan instead of romano simply because I picked up the wrong block but it was still devine! My middle son is not a huge fan of shrimp but other that that this dish got rave reviews all around. We will be having this one again soon.

Very good!  I made a few minor changes based on what I had in the kitchen.  I reduced the butter, used sun dried tomatoes instead of peppers since that's what I had, didn't add milk or cream (didn't notice anything missing) and added capers.  We really enjoyed!

This would be a great recipe if it included Alfredo sauce from scratch. It’s not hard to make. Using a jar of premade sauce seems like it just adds too many variables to the end result. If the sauce is poorly made or contains a lot of artificial ingredients, it could ruin the meal.

I will definitely make it again.  My husband loved it.   It was good for three nights' dinners for the two of us.  On the third night, I added about 1/2 c. sour cream as it had dried out a bit.   It enhanced the flavor after all the heating up.  I would stick to the original recipe until it needed more moisture if repeated nights servings.

My husband loved this... It's hard for me to make new recipes sometimes bc I'm a vegetarian so I can't taste what I'm cooking after meat is added in.  I skipped the onions, parsley, and oil- and used red pepper flakes because I didn't have cayenne.  He really loved it and ate 2 bowls.

Very delicious. Added 2tbsp of sun dried tomatoes, 1/4tsp red pepper flakes, 1/2tsp basil and 1/2tsp oregano to Step 2b.  Made Alfredo Sauce using Rebecca Swift's recipe using Kraft  Shredded Parmesan cheese. Also added 1/2tsp sugar to Step 3 with the cream and cheese (used Kraft shredded Romano & Parmesan Cheese). Reduced cayenne pepper to a pinch. This dish exceeded my expectations for taste...definitely a keeper..

Very good, but I left out the mushrooms, they overpowered the dish and gave it an earthy flavor which I personally did not like at all, so I  used  4 oz mushrooms (instead of 8) and also left them out completely as well ...much better! To each his own Enjoy

Made this delicious dish for my partner, using a homemade alfredo instead of using jarred since you can use most of the same ingredients already needed. Came close to completely blowing it by accidentally dumping half a bottle of crushed red pepper in with the onions and garlic, but we were able to recover it and it had just the right amount of kick. Highly recommend.

We thought it was a little spicy so cut back on the Cayenne pepper but this is an amazing dish and has quickly become one of our favorites!

OMG this was good!! I made it exactly as written, except I doubled the entire recipe for leftovers the next day ( soooo good) and ended up cooking one additional package of penne at the last minute as it looked like there was a LOT of sauce...  the consistency was perfect this way - very creamy and still ample sauce! Oh, just remembered one other change I made... I didn't have enough shrimp for the doubled recipe, so I made up the difference with some precooked chicken chunks I had from Costco. The combination was delicious and I wouldn't hesitate to do it this way again! I'll definitely make this again in the near future, probably trying all shrimp next time.

My husband loved this and told me I can make this anytime I want. I followed the resume except for the romano cheese which I did not have (I used parmesan instead).
Fairly easy to make but I recommend to chop and prep ingredients before starting if you are not a fast worker in the kitchen as everything goes fast once you start heating up the oil/butter.

We just had this for dinner and it was delicious!! Even my 2-year old said “mmmm yummy!” So it is kid approved and husband approved! We will definitely be making this again. I bought Newman’s own Alfredo sauce to mix in with the cream and the Romano cheese and it turned out well.

We LOVED it.  Used red onion and red bell pepper.  Replaced the Romano with Parmesan and left out the cream. It was so delish!

It was very good!!!! BUT... I am one who makes it by the recipe the first time, then I will alter it after.... Next time I will leave out the red peppers, (I am not a huge pepper fan) ADD some small pieces of  Broccoli..  And possibly some crumbled bacon... But overall IT WAS VERY GOOD!!!!

I pretty much followed this recipe however I used extra  garlic and cayenne pepper. I also used half and half and extra cheese. It actually is a good pasta dish with excellent flavor!! Definitely will make this dish again.

I really like it. The only thing I’m going to change next time I make it is that the parsley wasn’t needed. Adding that changed the taste a little bit. Not necessarily for the worst it’s still good. It just wasn’t needed.

This is a fantastic dish! I didn’t have any Romano cheese in the house, so I used Parmesan instead. Just the right amount of heat. My wife likes a lot of sauce and I was nervous it wouldn’t be enough for her, but it was perfect! I will definitely make this again.

Made a slight alteration by throwing the mushrooms and pepper into the food processor and finely mincing it. It still had the flavors and added color to the dish while using smaller pieces for those picky eaters. My family loved this dish for its cayenne kick, and restaurant-quality taste. Definitely going into the recipe box!

It was a tad spicier than I care for.  I wish I had started with 1/2 tsp of the cayenne pepper and then added more if it needed a bit more of a kick.  Generally I dont like to cook with jarred sauces or dry packet mixes but I didnt mind this one whatsoever.  I'll cook again for sure.

A bit on the bland side, but great recipe idea! We made as directed and felt it needed a bit more oomph.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband loved it.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  We enjoyed the flavor and the spice of the cayenne pepper.  I will definitely make this dish again.

GOURMET DELICIOUS!!! I used fresh spinach instead of mushrooms and penne pasta and cayenne pepper with everything else being as the recipe stated. This taste like something you would order in a top restaurant. It was nice and creamy and the flavor was outstanding. Will be in regular rotation at my house!!

Amazing!!! However I switched out the shrimp with prawns, added another jar or alfredo and removed the heavy cream. I also added two tablespoons of lemon pepper seasoning while the prawns and veggies were cooking and it turned out amazing!

Excellent! Followed it to a T except we don’t eat mushrooms and we like more heat so I added a bit more cayenne pepper.

Absolutely loved, loved, loved this recipe!  The parsley is not necessary. I did everything just about the same except added garlic salt to taste and Bella baby mushrooms. They were cheaper then the portobello mushrooms.

My husband and I both love the recipe but for our kids sake, I would use only 1/4 of teaspoon of the Cayenne because even though I cut it in half like most reviews said on here it was still too spicy for the children but I overall love it. Will definitely make again.

So good and easy. Next time I will add something green. Either broccoli, green beans or peas for more color. The taste and creaminess so rich.

This recipe is 5 stars as is. The cayenne pepper really ties it all together. I highly suggest if you don't like it to even add just a pinch. A favorite for years now!

I used veggie penne instead. It was amazing, my boyfriend LOVED it. Looking forward to testing these other comments about the left-overs being better.

Scrumptious meal shared with company.  As I wasn't sure how spicy the cayenne would make the end product, I erred on the side of caution and only used 1/2 tsp - gave great flavour without being overpowering.  I will probably stick with that in the future unless I know the diners like heavily spiced food.  Our  company loved the entree as well.  I'll definitely use in the future!

this is one of my family's favorite meals (too spicy for my 4yr old though)!! doesn't taste like Alfredo it's more like a Cajun spicy dish but I absolutely love it. has just enough kick to it to make you wanting more!

This is outstanding!  I did use half n half and I just thawed out cooked frozen peeled and deveined shrimp and tossed it in the sauce after everything was incorporated because my family hates the tails on.  But I’ll definately make this again!  Thank you to the creator of the recipe!

Awesome recipe.  Made it with fettuccine rather than penne, and my wife and daughter seem to love me again!  (also, used 2 lbs of shrimp....why the heck not?)

This is an exceptional recipe!  Hubby came back for seconds; when I said we would be having leftovers tomorrow night because reviewers said it was even better the second day...he said “I don’t see how it could be any better!”  This is a keeper for sure!  We like spicy so I followed the recipe exactly. I did add a couple handfuls of baby spinach toward the end.

Super fast & easy recipe. I made some changes.. I didn’t have cream however I did have half & half so substituted. I also only had roasted garlic Alfredo sauce & added an additional 1/2 tsp. Cayenne pepper. It was an easy alternative to a similar lengthy family loved recipe.

Hands down our favorite recipe, but we have to limit ourselves since it's so calorie-dense and we're trying to eat more vegetarian.

This is outstanding!  My husband said it was better than anything in a restaurant!  I used red pepper flakes instead of the ground red pepper.  It flavors better and is more authentic.  You will probably only need a pinch of the red pepper flakes.
This recipe is so easy to make and I will make again!

I just don't use the mushrooms.  I'm not a fan.  But other than that,  this is one of my FAVORITE dishes to cook when I want a great, creamy pasta dish.  I've made it several times and will make it several more I'm sure!

I followed the recipe the first time, the second time I followed the recipe with the exception of adding chicken instead of shrimp.  Everyone loved it both ways.

Definitely liked this recipe!  Very creamy and had a great kick!  I would reduce the olive oil and butter though in the beginning.  I am sensitive to oil though so that is why I would reduce the butter/oil combo.  I cut the bella mushrooms in to big chunks which was great.  I would make this again for sure.

I did not have all the ingredients but substituted red bell pepper for yellow, thin pasta for penne, omitted mushrooms because I dislike them cooked. I had leftover asparagus and so threw them in too. Delicious!! Will definitely fix again.

I substituted the sauce with the Skinny Alfredo Sauce recipe from this site, adding a little cayenne to it.   Very good, and far fewer calories and fat grams.

Followed recipe except left out the mushrooms. Was very good and will definitely be making often.  Will try putting in the mushrooms next time. The cayenne pepper added so much to the flavor.

My family liked this dish. I made it as written and would not change a thing. I played with this recipe a few times.  It is still good if you leave out the pepper, use parm. Chesse instead, and leave out the cream.  One hint: watch the amount of cream  or milk you add. This sauce can become  too thin. When the consistency is to you liking, stop adding any more liquid.

Totally yummy. May decrease the cayenne to 1/4 tsp was quite “hot”. Will make AGAIN for sure!

This was amazing dish, and very easy to put together.  My picky three year old liked it too which it is hard to please her.  I will definitely be making this dish again!  Thanks!!!

I made a few substitutions based on my family's tastes.  The sauce came out great. This recipe was really quick and easy to make.  The combination of ingredients didn't require there to be much more seasoning to add.  My family loved it!

This dish is absolutely awesome! Definitely restaurant quality.  

I used baby bella mushrooms and Italian blend cheese, because I couldn’t find Romano. Except for those changes, I followed the recipe exactly as shown.

Very good, this should be a staple of any pasta maker.  My variation is I put some smoked trout I made with my dad in with the shrimp and went a little overboard on the mushroom.  But it’s a very savory dish, with mushroom and shrimp and alfredo, earthy

This is fantastic.  The only things I did differently were: 1) I used more shrimp - 1.25 lbs and 2) I used premium-brand linguini (not the hard kind in a box) instead of penne.

This was definitely up there as one of my favorite recipes that I've ever made, which I wasn't expecting at all as I'm generally not a huge fan of alfredo.  The flavors and consistency were perfect.  I used cavatappi as it is one of my favorite pasta shapes and it turned out beautifully.

Excellent is the best word for this meal.  I made two changes.  I used two pounds of Argentina red shrimp and due to this I had to thicken with cream and corn starch.  I will cut back on the cayenne pepper.  It was too hot for my wife even though she though it was excellent.

No need to make any changes!!  The only thing I changed was ''less'' of  cayanne pepper... It's really delish!! You can get this on the table in less than 20 minutes & people will think you spent all day on it!!   My Fiancee loves this dish, even though he's not really crazy about Shrimp, he eats them & always says how good they taste!!  You can't ruin this either..

Absolute delicious!!  My husband and 14 year old loved it!!  I left out the green pepper and celery. Glad I did because the flavor was perfect!!  I also doubled up in the heavy cream as I discovered there wasn't quite enough 'sauce' for the entire box of pasta. Definitely going in my Favorites!!

Absolutely spectacular! As a veggie-phile, I added about a cup of spinach and waited to put the spinach and red peppers in last so that they wouldn't overcook. Oh, I only used a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. Delish!

Used fresh angel hair pasta and a reduced fat jar of sauce. Added 1/2 cup parm also. Was a big hit! Doubled the shrimp for a heartier portion.

Great simple to make dish. My family loved it. Probably one of our favorites. I used store alfredo but go light on it to just coat the pasta.

This is really good! My husband is allergic to shrimp so I substituted chicken in. I also added jalapeño peppers. And it came out really great! Will make again!

I made this today and the only things I did different were I added chicken with the shrimp and instead of cream I used 2% milk. It is really delicious. I can’t wait to make again!!

This was great!  The recipe was simple, and delicious.  I only used 1/2 the amount of cayenne pepper that the recipe called for, and it still had quite a "kick".   I will make this again.

Yummmmmyyyy!  Used half the recommended cayenne and was still very spicy so use this sparingly to taste.

I liked it, considering I forgot to add the parmesan cheese. I subbed spinach for the mushrooms. For the alfredo sauce, I used the recipe from this website called "Skinny Alfredo Sauce" and it was good. And as always, I subbed almond milk for the cream.

Followed recipe to a T other than using little bay scallops instead of shrimp. At the end I let it simmer for probably 20 mins and it turned out amazing!! The hubby doesn't even like seafood!

I think it is absolutely delicious! 
just 2 things, if you ate not a fan of spicy things then I would go with LESS cayenne pepper. it was a little too spicy for us. And my fiance LOVES spicy things. then secondly, if the sauce is a little runny or soupy not a big deal just add a little flour to thicken it up before you stir in the pasta. overall pretty great. would have given it 5 stars of not for the too spiciness

I started out true to the recipe and it was a five star. Over time, I have tweaked it and it remains five star but easier. I use roasted red peppers and let the onions, mushrooms, peppers, garlic and shrimp simmer on low once the shrimp are pink. 
I skip the cream and add the milk (+), Alfredo, Romano,  Parmesan and double cayenne. I let that simmer 5 minutes and add the pasta for another 5 to 10.
Frankly, I think if you are in the ballpark this recipe is going to work and work well

Wow!!!  This recipe was FANTASTIC!!!  Everyone who ate some of this dish immediately after the first bite gave it a “thumbs up.”  I made two small changes:  1) substituted the diced red bell pepper for one green bell pepper – simply because I was already adding cayenne and black pepper; and 2) I added some thinly sliced carrots which I added with the garlic and bell pepper simply for the color.  This is a simple, quick and all around excellent dish that can be completely done in under a hour. 06/25/2019.  I have made this dish at least three times this year, it is a favorite of all who eats this dish.

It turned out wonderful except do not substitute one teaspoon of cayenne pepper with one tablespoon of cayenne pepper. That is VERY wrong and you will pay for it at the back of your throat. Other than this minor issue, this recipe is muy suave.

100% good as written, I used a "roasted garlic" Alfredo. I was also lazy and used the full 16 oz of pasta since that was what was in the box, but I'll probably only use 12 next time (like the recipe said) so I've got a hair more sauce next time. This was bomb-diggity!

Followed recipe exactly, except I used homemade alfredo (store bought? UGH). THIS WAS SO GOOD!!! Served with sauteed broccoli on the side. I also used fresh shrimp that we just caught earlier that day. Hubby kept commenting on how good the house was smelling as I was cooking. I will definitely make this again!

We have made this over and over again!!! It is absolutely amazing just the way it says to make it. We do change it up a bit from time to time using what we have on hand. Chicken instead of shrimp, sometimes adding spinach, sometimes we make homemade alfredo sauce instead of using jarred. But this is a keeper for sure.

This is another great easy dish to prepare.  I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted plain greek yogurt.  It worked really well in the recipe.  My husband and I both loved it.  I will be making it again and again.

Amazing dish!!!!!  I only used 1/4 of the cayenne pepper  because I can't do spicy, and it was perfect for me.  My husband added extra to his bowl (so the regular amount would have been perfect for those who like a nice kick!)
Thank you for sharing this perfect recipe :)

I gave this a 4 star due to it lacking something. Can't put my finger on it but it just is. I only used a dash of the cayenne because my hubby does not like spicy at all. He still thought it was too spicy. I think I will play with this recipe next time.

This was great.  Not that difficult to prepare.  I did make some minor changes because I wanted to use what I had on hand.  Used grated Parmesan rather than grated Romano and white mushrooms rather than portobello.  Other than that, I used slightly less cayenne and no added salt.  I would fix this again.

This is SOOOOO good....maybe next time I'll use a little less cayenne though....I didn't use the red peppers which I'm sure will add some additional good flavor (boyfriend doesn't like the peppers)....still wonderful!

Made this for dinner tonight. Instead of jarred sauce though, I whipped up a batch of home made Alfredo. Because I knew the sauce was already loaded to the max with cheese, heavy cream, and butter I just skipped adding the extra cream and Romano the recipe calls for. It turned out fantastic! I will definitely be making this again. Even my über picky 5 year old loved it.

Very good and easy! Note to self: adjust cayenne pepper for personal taste...quite spicy.  Second time I made this I added Penzey's Arizona Dreaming spice instead of cayenne...very good and not too hot.

1/2t of cayenne pepper is perfect. A little kick with just the amount of flavor. I'm going to try with chicken, fresh baby spinach and 1/2 a jar more alfredo sauce. ??

We did tweak it a bit: we used thin spaghetti noodles, added baby crimini mushrooms along with baby portobello, and sautéed baby tender asparagus. Also used a romano/Parmesan cheese blend and doubled the shrimp (frozen was what I had on hand) , with fresh diced tomato and a sprinkle of cheese with the parsley garnish. Didn't add salt (the Alfredo had plenty) but offered it to taste. This recipe was a huge hit with my family!  The flavors are delicate and very complimentary together.  My husband does not care for spicy so I held back on the cayenne, but it  had an appealing little "kick" nonetheless. Also very appealing when plated: the red pepper, green asparagus, fresh parsley and a few shrimp as a garnish was visually appealing.  This dish would make a lovely dinner guest meal! My husband loved it!

This was good.  I didn't have the jar of alfredo so I just used good ole homemade.  It was good.  Family liked it as well.  Seems like it needed a little more shrimp and a little more seasoning, mostly because we love shrimp.

I love this dish!! I added seasoned grilled chicken breast instead of shrimp. Although I like it spicy everyone in my household does not. I sprinkled a tiny amount of the cayenne pepper. I also added steamed broccoli. Excellent Recipe and very easy to follow.

This is a family favorite! I've followed the recipe exactly and changed it a bit when I had other peppers on hand and used salad shrimp. I prefer baby bella over portabella.

A hit! A very simple, delicious recipe. My mom, boyfriend, and I loved it! I either didn't have all the ingredients or they were left out by request, so I didn't use the peppers, mushrooms, and cayenne pepper. It was still amazing. I'll be cooking this recipe again very soon.

Amazing!
I never cook seafood because I'm honestly a little intimidated by it. I made this for my fiances birthday (he actually sent me this recipe) and it only took 45 minutes to make.
I didn't add the mushrooms just because they're not our favorite, I added a little more Cayenne for a kick and it was fantastic. I also followed the recipe exact with the raw shrimp and it was so soft and fresh, you also get SO MUCH shrimp, not one or two on your plate if you were to go out to a resturaunt and get the same dish.i
LOVE LOVE LOVE. Will definitely be making this again for family!

I've made this for the fourth time tonight...first time as written and came out great. I think after a few times our preference is to add grilled chicken tenderloins instead of shrimp and spinach instead of the peppers. That being said the portobellos and fresh baby spinach yield a lot of liquid and so I do not add the Alfredo and Romano to the same pot instead at that step I get another pot add the sauce and cheese then with a slotted spoon add the chicken mushroom onion mixture..also add more cheese and garlic.

I've made this a few times, now, and it has become a family favorite.  I even made it once when my in-laws were visiting, and my father-in-law, who is kind of an intense guy (retired cop) and also notoriously picky about food, had THIRDS and couldn't stop raving about it.  I feel like that was the moment he really accepted me into the family. :P
In all seriousness, though, this is a great dish.  I didn't even change anything about the recipe.  Five stars from me.

It was really, really good! The onion was pretty overpowering though, so I'd cut back on that and I personally cut back on the cayenne, using only about half of what was called for.

Loved this! It was cheesy, creamy & soooo yummy! I made the Alfredo sauce from scratch & it was well worth the taste.  This was so rich & delicious! I used Romano cheese petals by Saputo & just regular button mushrooms. This was the best pasta dish I've ever made, definitely a keeper! Tasted like restaurant quality!

Family loved it! I only used a table spoon of butter in the olive oil and didn't add any salt.   Also, I cooked 2lbs of shrimp and there was plenty of sauce without having to make extra.   Lastly,  we added microwave steamed garlic/salted broccoli when mixing the penne pasta.    Thanks!

This recipe is amazing! I got rave reviews and my husband even said it was better than Olive Garden's. The only changes I made were for preference. I used frozen small shrimp that were cooked, deveined, peeled and had the tails off to simplify prep and I only use 2 pinches of the cayenne pepper, since our family is not into spicy food.  Also it was plenty salty enough so I didn't add any salt during cooking. This is a fantastic dish that I'll be making again and again! Thank you!

I just made this and it is delicious. I made minor adjustments by only putting two tablespoons of Alfredo sauce, a teaspoon of zesty lime Weber flakes to the shrimp and used wheat penne pasta. I did not have mushrooms nor added cayenne pepper.

This recipe was amazing.  It was like we were eating at a restaurant!  When I make this again I will probably put in half as much cayenne pepper.  It was a little hot for me and much too hot for my husband.  Otherwise, totally delicious!

Turned out wonderful! The whole family loved it. I didn't have the right cheese so I just threw in what I had (mozzarella), so     it 's probably even better with the Romano cheese. I will most definitely make this again!

Made this last night for a small dinner party. Only change was to add a little more cayenne. It was a huge success. Everyone loved it!! Just enough heat to make it interesting. Will most definitely be making again. Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was REALLY good! I usually go for red sauce pastas, but the addition of the peppers, mushrooms, and cayenne really put this recipe over the top. I did change a few things based on other reviews...I used half and half because that's what I had, and I reduced the amount of cayenne to 1/4 tsp. The first time I made it, I used the 1tsp it called for, and it was just WAYYYY too much--and I like hot stuff! To be able to truly enjoy all the flavors, I definitely recommend reducing the cayenne. I also topped the bowls with fresh chopped green onion and Roma tomatoes....so good! This will be made again and again!

This was so easy to make and delicious!  It looks like a gourmet dish but so easy to make.  I agree not to add salt because the alfredo sauce is already salty.  Taste first.  Next time I am going to add blanched broccoli for additional color.  This is a keeper.

I added fresh spinach right before I added the alfredo sauce.  And used homemade alfredo sauce instead of jarred.  It was awesome!  Served it to some friends and a friend's one year old grand baby.  He said it best!  Mmmmm!

I made this last night.  There were NO leftovers!  It was very good and had a little spicy kick to it.  I didnt get to use the red pepper because the one I bought was molded inside unfortunately, but it was good without it.  I also used the mini penne pasta.

Made completely to recipe specs. Thought the cayenne might be a bit overpowering but it was mild enough that my 3 year old still loved it, and mommy ate multiple dishes over the course of the evening. This one's going in the book!

Awesome!  I would cut back on the cayenne next time.  Husband loved the spice, but a little too spicy for the kiddos.

This was fantastic! I love foods with a kick and this one delivers. Not too spicy but gives you just enough to keep you coming back for more. This will be a meal that is made again!

This meal was so delicious! It had a great mix of heat, flavor, and it was so easy to make. Everyone (6 people) in the house loved it. My finicky daughter is on bowl # 2 and she was thrilled that I was able to put some aside for her to have tomorrow. If you are not a big fan of spicy food cut back on the cayenne to half of what is called for so you still get the peppered taste to it but not so much kick. I followed the recipe to the T and made no changes. However, I did use large shrimp instead of smaller ones. This is one recipe I'lol gladly make again in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious recipe!!  I cut in half because it was only for 2 of us and it made a lot.  Only change was fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream because that's what I had.  Otherwise, followed exactly and loved it!!!

I made the following adjustments; I used crushed red pepper instead of cayenne, and parmesan instead of romano, both substitutions because I didn't have the ingredient called for. This was a solid dish that my mom and I enjoyed.

This is definitely 5 stars! I agree with other reviewers that it is best to use fresh Alfredo sauce, and I used a little less pasta since I like my dishes saucey. Those were the only tweaks and it was a winner.

Only had fresh parmesan instead of romano cheese; and 1/2 and 1/2 for the cream.  Cut back on the cayenne.  Added about 2 cups of streamed broccoli to make it a one-dish meal.  Used gluten free penne pasta - couldn't tell the difference.  Have enough for another meal.  Very good. Would make this for company.  Chop ahead and an even easier dish to prepare.

This was really delicious although I recommend not adding salt since the Alfredo sauces that you buy in the jar is already salted.

Great recipe, so simple.  I used a spicy tomato egg pasta instead of penne.  Also threw in some cherry tomatoes and spinach.  Will definitely make again.

Absolutely loved this! I made it and followed each instruction and measurement step by step because it was my first time making it but it turned out perfect. Except I used one tablespoon of cayenne pepper like it said (I like spicy) but I think it was too spicy for me k can only handle a little bit! All in all it was great and would definitely recommend it

We really enjoyed this dish. It's something I'd make for a dinner party. I only used 1/4 tsp of cayenne because my hubby doesn't like his food too hot. It was very nice with a Riesling. I will definitely be making this one again.

I can't say enough about this recipe. It's absolutely delicious. my 14 year old son who has never had pasta in his life, as he claims it all to be sooooo unappealing, had two servings. I followed it to the letter. Its one of the few recipes that I feel it would be a crime to alter. ALTHOUGH... I may try it with chicken, just to see how it would be. I suspect I will not be disappointed.

Delicious!  I don't make anything with Alfredo very often, so it's a big deal that I now keep it on hand because of this recipe!  This is the second time I've made it, sticking very close to the directions and ingredients.  The first time I made it, I didn't have any red bell peppers or penne pasta.  I ended up just having mushrooms, and I used spaghetti noodles instead.  It was still delicious!  Spicy, but delicious!  This time, I had all ingredients and cut down on the cayenne to make it just right for us.  I will be making this again, and again!!

I'm quite partial to garlic and spicy pepper, so I tripled the garlic to 6 cloves and added crushed red pepper flakes, paprika, and Louisiana hot sauce. I used Prego brand Alfredo sauce, a bit more cream, and linguine instead of penne, just because it was on-hand. I also sliced the mushrooms instead of dicing. *Personal notes: This recipe is best served immediately, because the sauce can quickly absorb and congeal; Cook for a large or hungry group; For those not used to cooking with shrimp, it is easiest and tastiest to buy frozen uncooked deveined shrimp (shell on), thaw in cool water, then add to boiling water that is lightly seasoned with sea salt, for 2-3 min., then drain and run under cool water, then peel. Very easy.

Loved it! Could not get enough. I actually let the  onions, mushrooms, and red peppers simmer for a couple minutes. Added some chicken pieces along with the shrimp. Did not add Cayenne pepper, but the dish turned out amazing! We couldn't get enough of it. Definitely had some left overs for lunch. This will definitely be a constant weeknight dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

Used 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 scallops. Nice, but not necessary.
Cut the cayenne pepper in half.
Salt and pepper to taste (I hate it when recipes call for that), I used 2 teaspoons salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper. (It was good, but I will cut the pepper next time.)

Absolutely love this recipe! I did make a few small changes. I doubled the garlic & added 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes. I used only 10 oz container of Alfredo sauce from the cold food section (don't recall the brand), I also substituted Parmigiana-Reggiano instead of Romano because that's what I had on hand. I decided to use fresh cheese filled tortellini instead of penne pasta.  Everything else I kept the same.  This dish was amazing! WE LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT!!!! Will definetly make this again! Steamed broccoli florettes & zucchini for my side, with a few thin slices of the red pepper for color.

I used 1/2 & 1/2.... halved the cayenne....
Just about any pasta, bowties, etc., will work....

I increased this to 9 servings to feed my family of 6 (I have teenage boys). I followed the recipe to a T. I used Prego garlic parmesan Alfredo sauce. I typically do NOT like any jar Alfredo sauces but that one came out perfectly with this recipe! I did add an extra 1/2 TSP of the cayenne pepper. We happen to love spicy food. Thank you for this recipe!

Overpoweringly hot! The teaspoon of cayenne pepper makes this a no go unfortunately. Everyone was overpowered by this! I liked this but as other people have said, reduce to (at most) 1/2 tsp.

Will definitely make this again.  The only thing I didn't add was mushrooms, since I hate them, and I didn't use more than a dash of the cayenne pepper.  I don't normally use it in my cooking so I was leery about using a lot.  But this is a great dish! And adding more than the 1 lb of shrimp it calls for doesn't hurt, and there is plenty to use a full pound of penne also.  Great dish!

Omit the oil. Red AND green peppers, roasted. BABY potobellos or portobellos sliced medium thick. Add 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes while  sautéing; omit cayenne. Sub home-made skim with extra powder for real cream. Half scallops, half shrimp - a nice idea. VARIATION:  sub 3/4 cup tomato sauce for the cream to make a rosé sauce which complements the ingredients. Use button mushrooms. Omit cayenne.

This was a great tasty meal that the whole family loved (even the 2 year old)! I used a roasted garlic alfredo sauce to add flavor since I was skipping the cayenne pepper and ended up not needing the cream. Overall, this was an easy shrimp dish that I would definitely make again and again!

This meal is quite convenient and easy to make.  I bought pre cooked shrimp so that made it even easier.  I also cut the amount of cayenne in half (I have a six year old and spice does not do well with her) Even with only half of the cayenne pepper amount used the meal still had a good bit of spice to it, just enough for the little tummy.  This meal also makes a large serving so for a family of three there was plenty of leftovers.

This was very good and very easy, just a little too hot so next time I will use 1/2 tsp cayenne.  I also used 1/2 onion, omitted butter and increased EVOO to 3 tbsp. Mwah!

I was a little worried about the jar of Alfredo sauce, however it turned out really good.  It seems soupy at first when off the heat, but I allowed it to sit for a bit to thicken.  Easy and fast, and I will most definitely be making this recipe again.

It was really easy and delicious. I followed the directions almost completely. Instead of fresh peppers and onions. I used a small bag of precut frozen onions and peppers. I also used a lot of creole seasoning in the recipe. It turned out great and got good taste reviews from everyone. Definitely a new favorite to make again and again.

This is an excellent recipe; my husband and kids loved it and said it reminded them of Olive Garden. I added a 1/2  tbsp of lemon juice to the shrimp for extra zing.  I also used the Classico 4 cheese Alfredo sauce. I could have made the sauce but decided to try Classico.... It was cheaper than making it on my own and just as delicious.

I make this at least 2-3 times a month!! it's great!! I always use chicken in mine instead of chicken. it's just as good. I made it with shrimp once. it's just as good with shrimp too. my family just doesn't like shrimp that much. but I've made it with different color peppers, without the onions or mushrooms (sometimes I forgot to get them) I never put the fresh garlic in though. I always use minced or garlic power. I've also substituted the milk. for either half and half or whole or whatever heavier milk the store had or I had. Also, I've changed up the cheese too. I've used plain Parmesan or plain Romano or I've used just powdered shaky cheese(the one you use for spaghetti) Trust me, u can make any of these adjustments and it'll still turn out great. As long as u add veggies, meat, milk, Alfredo sauce, cheese,spices and pepper you will be fine:)
ENJOY!!!

Great meal!  Next time I will add two red peppers as they shrink in size.  Along with additional mushrooms.  Cut the cayenne to half a tsp.  Instead of just parmesan cheese, I blended in asiago and romano cheese as well.

I thought this was way to spicy - even with half the cayenne.  I reduced the butter a little.  My husband did like it, but I didn't.  One suggestion would be to not use extra large shrimp, which I did -- it made the dish too "saucey."  Perhaps that's why it seemed so spicy to me.  Smaller shrimp would have added more shrimp to each bite.

My family really liked this recipe.  They all agreed the longer it sits the better it tastes because the seasoning just settles so well after a day.  I also added a paella mix of scallops, calamari and shrimp to the shrimp I already had it was soooo good!

This was so simple and delicious!  Used the same basic recipe,but used spinach instead of red bells be causes hubby doesn't care for bells.  Used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne and onion powder instead of onions...for the same reason I can't use bells!  It was absolutely delightful and will definitely use again:)

This was delicious ! I used the classico pasta sauce and seasoned the shrimp with a tablespoon of garlic powder and a tablespoon of Goya adobe seasoning prior to adding it to the pot.  I decided to skip the parsley and the recipe is still amazing the family loves it. Try this recipe you wont regret it!

Rich, indulgent & delicious! The only thing I did different is I used jarred roasted red pepper as that was what I had on hand and did not add mushrooms, because my teenager won't eat them. Although it is certainly not a low fat meal, it is definitely a keeper for us and will be in our monthly meal rotation!

This was excellent! Omitted the mushrooms and used 3/4 tsp cayenne and it was plenty peppery-spicy. Those were my only changes. Used one pound of size 31/35 shrimp - which are perfectly sized for this dish - but we each wanted more shrimp so next time will try 1-1/2 pounds. We had it for dinner with a salad but this would definitely make a nice first course for a winter dinner party of 8-10.

This is a really good. I followed the recipe pretty closely, and it turned out great! The only thing is that it is a bit spicy for my family's taste. I wish I put in less cayenne pepper. Instead of 1 teaspoon, I think next time I'll put in 1/2 or 1/3 teaspoon instead. Other than that, it's really great!

An awesome start; I used it as a base considering what I had in the house. I used cooked frozen shrimp, thawed and pulled tails off. I sauted onions, added garlic, sweet colored peppers  & diced portebella mushrooms as directed with EVOO & butter as needed for amount I had. We used egg noodle as that is what we had available, tossed that in cooked and added bottled Alfredo sauce, tossed in shrimp to warmed through. I liberally peppered and served with shredded Parmesan cheese.

I followed the exact recipe but doubled the ingredients so that I could have left overs for the next day.   I have four kids of which all play sports and needed something quick for us pasta lovers!! It was creamy like my husband like it and my kids had seconds.  This one is definitely a keeper and will be added to our meal rotations.

I made this pasta on the spur of the moment, and boy am I glad I found this website! I don't like mushrooms so I left them out and I have to say, this pasta was restaurant quality. My husband kept saying over and over how delicious it was. I have it saved in my favorites and I think I am going to make it for my family on Christmas Eve!

This is a great simple recipe that tastes even better the next day. When I made it I was a little underwhelmed but the next day we couldn't stop eating it. The only thing I added was some drained diced tomatoes. They make the sauce a nice pink and add a little bit of crunch.

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe was written except I decreased the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp. It was Awesome!!  I used Bertolli Alfredo Sauce which has a wonderful flavor. My hubby loved it. This is a keeper and company worthy!

This was delicious though I used crimini mushrooms instead that I had leftover, plus a mix of mozerella and parmesan cheese since I forgot to get the romano cheese.  Oops. I'm not too spicy in my food but the given amount of cayenne pepper felt right to me, just enough kick. A great dish and will definitely make this again.

Wow, 10 stars in my book. I added extra cayenne and used milk instead of cream to reduce the calories. I bought a block of Romano and hand grated it.  Give it a try when you want something different or want to impress someone special.  Bon apetito!

I made a few adjustments, I don't like having too much fat in my dishes so I used light alfredo souce, I used fat free half and half creme, and I skipped the butter. It came out amazing. My boyfriend came home for lunch from work just to get more. Also 1 tsp of cayenne is strong unless you really like spicy so I would use half a teaspoon instead.

I followed recipe for the most part exact, except I added basil, and oregano.

This is so easy and my family enjoyed the flavours. I left out the cream.  It was already rich enough.
Definitely a keeper.

This was a fantastic recipe, that I'm definitely going to make time and time again.  The only modification I made was to substitute 2% milk for cream.

I love this recipe but I do wish it included an Alfredo sauce made from scratch as it's very easy to do so. I followed the recipe except for the cream, Romano cheese and jarred Alfredo sauce. Instead I used a (full stick of) butter based sauce with a small carton of whipping cream and two containers of mixed cheese (Romano, Asiago and Parmesan) and added the seasoning to this mixture as well as chopped parsley and one clove of garlic. I like a lot of Alfredo sauce and this made the perfect amount for this recipe! I also doubled the garlic as I'm a big fan of it. I can't wait to make this one again!!

I followed the recipe exactly. Next time, I'll eliminate the parsley. Overall, it was a great dish! My twelve year old son loved it, and he's a very picky eater. This dish is definitely of restaurant quality and so easy to make.

This recipe is awesome! The only thing I will do differently next time is cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half. It was still delicious but just a little too spicy for me to fully enjoy it.

Yes I did today!!! I changed up some minor things. I used yellow, orange, & red bell peppers. I added my parsley in the dish while it was cooking. last I added a chicken bouillon cube in it just for more flavor.

Great taste but a little too spicy. If you enjoy sweat on your forehead when you eat, this is for you. If not, cut back a little on the cayenne and enjoy.

This was really quite good. It actually rather lacked a bit of flavor for all the ingredients. I'll add more spices and such next time. Also, I really disliked the cop-out "jar of alfredo sauce" the recipe calls for - better to look up an Alfredo sauce recipe on your own.

And on what freakin planet does it only take 30 minutes to dice / mince / chop all that ?! Pft.

But I'll make it again. :)

this was crazy good. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I unknowingly used alot more butter. I also used preminced garlic and prechopped onions that I bought for a dollar in the season isle. I roasted some asperagas and threw it on top with cherry tomatoes. 

yum yum yum

This recipe is amazing! I will definitely be making it again. However, I did make one minor substitution. Instead of shrimp, I began marinating chicken breasts the morning of and baked it later that evening while preparing the pasta sauce. I'm sure this dish would be just as delicious as is though!

Delicious! Made as indicated (except I made my own Alfredo sauce, but some of the store bought are very good!). I used a little less butter and more olive oil. In honesty I was low on butter, but the switch to only 2 tablespoons of butter and a 1/8 cup of olive oils worked out well.  I also used slightly less cayenne pepper because my daughter is sensitive to the spiciness. That being said I think the full teaspoon would have been just fine and not too much at all.

I've don't usually remember to review the recipes, but I just had to stop and give this one a High Five.  It was simple and so very delicious.  I used milk instead of cream but other than that I didn't change anything.   OK so maybe I added a little more pepper and a little more garlic. But that was to taste.  It was just WOW!  And Easy.  Will definitely make again, probably very soon.

Yes I made this dish, since I didn't have any Romano cheese I added 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese instead, it was very good.  You can use milk if you do not have any cream.

This is the most delicious and creamiest pasta I have made and it was a hit! My husband loved it and even said,"It was better than Carino's"!! I didn't have cayenne pepper or Romano cheese, but it came out terrific either way!!! Will definitely be making this more often with a change or two!

LOVED IT!! Easy to make and tastes fabulous. I used the low fat alfredo sauce and it tasted great! The only change I made was a little extra shrimp because my husband is a shrimp guy.

I will make this again,  although not too frequently as I usually  try and have less fat in my meal. If you are sensitive to spicy heat, maybe cut down on the cayenne by half,  but don't leave it out.  It really adds
 to the dish.

I have made this dish dozens of times and it is always a hit. I have substituted chicken breast in place of shrimp and it since my son doesn't really care for shrimp and it is great either way.

It was very good. Hubs asked for seconds.  I used low fat Alfredo sauce, left out the Romano cheese and used pre cooked shrimp. I also used extra cayenne because we like spicy food.  Served it with a green salad with Italian dressing.

Using jar sauce?   I honestly think recipes with pre- made, store bought ingredients should be placed in a separate category .

Make your own Alfredo sauce. For kicks I thought I would just buy the "stuff" in a jar....BIG mistake.

This was a big hit in our house. I didn't have Romano so subbed parm, and cut cayenne to half teaspoon. I'm going to make it with chicken next time.

We loved it! It is very filling- had so mutch left over put it in a pan to bake tomorrow with fried onions on top. I did make some changes to it. Instead of using heavy whipping cream I used half and half and used about 1c 1/2 c used and 2 cups of fresh shredded Parmesan cheese. Instead of olive oil used coconut oil. My husband did not notice or taste the coconut oil. It does taste better the next day! Enjoy

Best pasta I've ever made, couldn't stop eating it! The cayenne pepper was pretty spicy so I would suggest not using the full amount if you don't like spicy stuff. I also added in green bell peppers and bought sauce with mushrooms in it instead of doing the mushrooms myself and it turned out great! Other than that, followed recipe to a T. Highly suggest this recipe. And jt goes amazing with a glass of red wine :)

I reduced some white wine 2ith the nutter amd veggies, before adding cream. i did not add the jarred alfredo....... butter, cream and parmesan or romano, IS an alfredo,  the outcome is much better if more of each is added and the processed alfredo is set aside.

Omg delicious! Made this just for me, bc the hubby doesn't like any pasta other than spaghetti. Shrimp is expensive so I didn't use any, although I'm sure it would have been that much more magical with it. I also didn't use mushrooms bc I don't like them. I think chicken would be good in it but didn't feel like dirtying another pan. Even without two of the ingredients this was probably the best pasta I've ever made. Beware though, this is spicy! Which is why I loved it. If you like spicy, creamy pasta, this dish is for you!

I did my own twist on it.... I added asparagus to the mix as well. I did not add the olive oil to the sauce but to the pasta instead as I did not want it to soak through.

My husband and I absolutely loved this dish. I made a few alterations. Firstly, I used rotini pasta instead of penne. Also, in an attempt to cut back on cheese I left out the Romano. It turned out great! The sauce had just the right amount of creamy-ness without being too runny or too thick. Needless to say, I will continue to make this recipe and keep it on my list of favorites. One of the best pasta dishes out there and I highly recommend!

So yummy I couldn't stop eating it! I made only a few adjustments. I made the Alfredo sauce using another (Allrecipes) recipe because store bought is too salty and chemical tasting. After learning the lesson to next time buy shrimp already cleaned, I followed the recipe except after cooking shrimp I only added my premise Alfredo sauce with a sprinkle of crushed red pepper and black pepper. I'll make again maybe with chicken next time.

This was tasty but beware of adding a whole teaspoon of cayenne unless you really like it hot. I added about a half teaspoon and it was plenty warm.  I used half and half instead of cream which worked fine and I have an herb garden so I tossed a whole handful of parsley, oregano and chives into the mix. Don't skimp on the garlic.

I made this for my boyfriend and my roommate. I added a bit more shrimp of course and it was a hit! Make your own Alfredo sauce if you have an extra ten minutes but other that that adding peas is a nice touch as well. Love the spiciness and even without the Cayenne Pepper the flavors are delicious!

This dish was extremely easy to make. I didn't use canned Alfredo sauce, I made the Alfredo sauce. I also added asparagus to this dish. I didn't use any pasta. Instead of topping pasta with this sauce, I used shredded baked spaghetti squash instead.

My husband and I have made this recipe twice now, exactly as the recipe calls for once and with a whole lot more mushroom the second time. Super über delicious. I made it with Veggie pasta, if you haven't tried veggie past, you should. I get it at WalMart : )

Awesome Alfredo. Best I've ever made and the only one I will make from now on. I substituted the mushrooms with spinach like someone else suggested. Used 1/2&1/2 instead of cream cause it's what I had on hand. I also added a homemade sofrito of spices for a kick instead of paprika, and served on angel hair also because it's what I had on hand. Excellent recipe! Thanks!

My husband and I absolutely love this the recipe! He told me I should make it more often. I did exactly what the recipe says, I just added a little bit of chicken broth because I'm not really a fan of shrimp. but it gave the pasta a really good flavor! Making this recipe at least once a week now

I made my own alfredo sauce instead of using the ready made.  I am not a fan of cayenne pepper so I totally eliminated it from the recipe.  Everyone is asking me when  I am going to make it again.

Easy and delicious.  I used 15 oz canned mushrooms (family preference), fat free half and half for the cream to lighten calories/fat, and parmesean in place of Romano (couldn't find it).  Thanks so much for sharing, new family favorite.

Probably too many calories as written, but it sure was good!  Cut some of the cayenne if you don't like it spicy.  This recipe is a keeper.

Made this for Valentines Day! It was great! I didn't use mushrooms..added spinach, more shrimp of course, a little more butter and I used about a tablespoon of sour cream, because I had no idea exactly what "cream" was needed..and. I used Romano, Asiago, & Parmesan cheeses!! It was Delicious! Also it was even better 2days after with a side of Texas Toast garlic bread! Thanks for your tasty help !! My picky 4 year even nibbled on it, & demanded I pick out all the shrimp so he can just have the shrimp..he said it was Yummy!

Delicious, folks!!

This was great, but 1 tsp of cayenne pepper was a bit much.  1/2 or 1/4 tsp would have been sufficient for our taste.

This was amazing! The only changes I made were cut the cayenne pepper in half and used 1/4 cup of 2% milk because that's what I had in the fridge. My family loves the dish paired with roasted asparagus. Will definitely cook this again.

So Good! There are so many variations possible for this yummy recipe. I made it vegetarian with extra mushrooms and added fresh spinach. Used only 1/2 the cayenne to accommodate sensitive palates as I served it as part of our Italian Christmas feast. Great addition (and I will never tell my MIL it was a jarred sauce - she loved it!)

THIS IS HEAVENLY!  My DH has been through chemo/radiation and nothing has tasted or even sounded good to him. He said yesterday that pasta sounded good, so I made this last night. It was delicious! To see him eat this with such enthusiasm made my heart sing! All I did different was sauté the shrimp and I used a roasted red pepper. Will be having it again for tonight...thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

Loved it! Instead of salt and pepper, I added chilli pepper and adobo. I passed on the mushrooms however. This recipe made me fall in love with making pasta again.

That recipe is so gooooddd! The combination Alfredo Shrimp is awesome. I added yellow bell pepper with red, it tasted awesomely great. I sprinkled also with oregano. It was a great dish my family loved it.. Next time will try the Salmon Alfredo combination to see..

Absolutely loved this. I was concerned about the heavy cream AND alredo sauce, but it worked brilliantly. 

I'll be making this again, one of my new favorite recipes.  I added about a 1/2 tsp of cayenne for spice and it was perfect.

O.M.G! This is so good! I followed the recipe, but made a few minor changes. I used spinach instead of mushrooms. I sprinkled Italian shredded cheese on top (at the end). I also baked it in a casserole dish for about 10-12 minutes.

The whole family loved this recipe.  The teaspoon of cayenne pepper maybe a little much for the little ones but over all it was super yummy! We will be making this again and again.

I used linguini as I'm not a huge fan of penne, and made my own Alfredo sauce so I skipped the extra cream and cheese. Other than that, I followed it exactly. Even my mom, who's a huge foodie, loved this recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly except I left out parsley.  For the alfredo sauce, I used Newman's Own.I am surprised that some people said they used two jars.  It made ALOT of sauce!

Overall, flavor was very good and I recommend trying this recipe.  I would have preferred grilled chicken instead of shrimp.  I used the full amount of cayenne and added black pepper - it had great kick.

There is nothing healthy about this dish - definitely not something I would make often but it is a good recipe to have for days when you don't mind eating something rich and bad for you.

Also - this was not the most budget friendly recipe.  I only had some of the items on hand so it ended up costing me more than I would have liked.

This is great.  I made it as is other than omitting the shrimp and just adding marinaded roasted chicken breasts on top instead and using a full 16 oz of pasta (added more cream to compensate).  I do think it's a little spicy with 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Next time I'll use half.  Other than that it's a very quick and tasty meal. You can't even tell you use bottled alfredo.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can use instead of romano cheese or Parmesan cheese? Something that will still give it a good flavor/texture? I am asking due to an allergy. Any suggestions help! Thanks!

This recipe is great!! I used quinoa penne pasta for a healthy choice, Parmesan cheese instead of Romano, half an onion instead of a whole one, and white mushrooms instead of portobello to cut costs. Super yummy! Will definitely make again :)

This really good!! I got here, because I bought the mushroom Alfredo sauce and had no idea how it would taste with shrimp. It was delicious!!So yeah, you can just buy Alfredo sauce with the mushrooms already in it too. I used slightly different ingredients, that I already had at home. I use green pepper instead of red, and Parmesan cheese instead of Romano. It was still amazing!! I really love cayenne pepper to replace my black pepper (it has more health benefits), so that was a nice surprise ingredient I wasn't expecting. :-)

I made this recipe today for Mother's Day for a surprise for my mother in law. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but added some of my own additions. I used spaghetti noodles instead of penne pasta and added chicken, broccoli and bacon. I also used Soul food seasoning and Cajun seasoning which really made the dish burst with flavor. I recommend everyone try this out as well. Thanks a lot for sharing such a wonderful recipe. I will make this many more times.

We love this recipe but I do cut back on the cayenne pepper to suit our taste. I also use 2 jars of alfredo sauce instead of 1.  Yummy!  I think my husband would have this every night if I would fix it!!

This recipe is to die for! I make it atleast once a month as it is simple and delicious. Depending on my audience, I adjust the cayenne as it can be considered overly spicy but thats an easy adjustment!

I made this for my best friend's birthday. I mixed chicken and shrimp with just a dash more cayenne and received rave reviews from even my pickiest eaters!

I made this for the 22 guys at Engine 42's Firehouse located in downtown Chicago.  With all the great Italian food around us it's hard to compete but this was a hit.  Definitely going to put it in my monthly rotation..

We liked this dish, but didn't love it. I didn't use butter and I didn't see the need for the cream, but I still used it.

I'm really pleased with the recipe. The only thing that took a while was peeling the shrimp. I added a lot more cayenne pepper because I just like it a little hot and it turned out great. This recipe makes plenty. I don't think I'll use as much shrimp in the future. I'll probably reduce it to 1/2 a pound.

Made the recipe as listed with the addition a couple cloves of extra garlic and used a shallot in place of the onion as that's what I had on hand. Boyfriend said it was the best meal I've made him. I'm sure I'll be asked to make it again...and again. Very tasty!

Absolutely fabulous dish!!!!! Easy to make. I used ragu style Alfredo sauce. It doesn't seem to make enough was my only complaint. I would add extra to all ingredients. I don't like mushrooms too much but they were just great in this recipe. Highly recommend for a dish to be made for serving guests. Definitely at least double the recipe though.

Wow this is a great recipe!! My husband said it tasted like something he would get at a restaurant. I didn't modify much, just used what I had on hand - red and green peppers instead of mushrooms, half and half instead of cream, and frozen shrimp instead of fresh. It was amazing! I will probably use less cayenne next time but still an amazing dish!

I love this recipe just as it was written!  It's fast, easy and super good!  I actually, love recipes that you can use things like jarred sauce, lol.  I seek them out when I want something quick but still yummy!  This will now be in my rotation. Ty for sharing this.

I loved this, but my hubs, 13 and 11 year olds didn't. I have no idea why. They must notta been in the mood? As always, I made it without alterations the first time, except, and I know I'm contradicting myself now, but I used half and half instead of whole cream. No biggy, right?
I think my crew is getting picky cuz this was great, and would also be awesome with clams instead of shrimp!

This is my go to recipe for company.  It is delicious, presents well and doesn't have a lot of complicated juggling at the end, which is the worst thing in the world when you are stressed out trying to get everything on the table for guests.  Thanks so much for making me look good with your great recipe!

The recipe is real easy to make and is very good.  The only thing I would change is to decrease the amount of cayenne pepper.  I found it real hot. Maybe it's because I am not from the south where hot food is a norm.

This was such a great dish!! I used Newmans own sauce and it actually is naturally rather light and not salty so it gave me the freedom to add salt to taste. I also doubled the Romano and didn't chop the mushrooms...gives a better presentation!

Easy to make and very, very tasty.
My guests found it too spicy. Be careful with the cayenne pepper. I would reduce to 1/2 tsp or less.
Otherwise it was fantastic.

I make this all the time now! Bertolli's Alfredo goes really well here. I sometimes use mushrooms, but I've found it really good without it. Instead, I just use 1/2 a yellow or orange bell pepper in its place. I This goes really will with linguine pasta and is my usual go to, just for texture's sake. Also, 1 teaspoon is way too much cayenne pepper if you aren't a huge spicy lover. 1/4 teaspoon is still zesty, though I usually kick it up to 1/2 a teaspoon. Go slowly adding this to suit your family's tastes! 

Other then that, amazing dish and makes even better leftovers. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Just OK. Definitely fast and easy, however not a lot of flavor. I did stick to the recipe and found the dish bland with the exception of the cayenne which only added heat no depth of flavor.

This was a fantastic and easy recipe.  I didn't deviate from the original aside from pasta choice.  You could leave out the cayenne for a milder version, but I personally liked it and my cream sauce-hating husband LOVED it.

Wow..well I have never rated a dish on here but this was worth taking the time. Even out of the other so called 4.5 5 star dishes, I found this to be a true 5! It was easy to execute and the flavor profiles came together great. I did use spicy red pepper for the kick and it worked well. Delish!

Made up my own Alfredo, and had to use Parmesan (no Romano).  Still tasted great, especially as I felt guilty due to the sauce so I shoved in some spinach. A great hit with the family!!

Loved this recipe! I made it without the cream and it was still fantastic. All of the flavors come together so amazingly. After I made this the first time... I ended up making it again the next night. Sooooo good!!! I now know this recipe by heart. Love love love it!!!

This was outstanding! Not to mention easy to make!  My husband doesn't really like to eat and he even took seconds of this!  If something is "OK" to him that means it's a hit.  I did substitute parmesan for Romano as I didn't have Romano and canned mushrooms for the Portobello mushrooms.  Next time I make this, I'll use the real ingredients although it was awesome the way it was!  There WILL be a next time.

I like to add chicken to this dish, never disappointed with this entree and I prepare it at least once a month. I make this recipe as instructed but I add Old Bay seasoning to the shrimp before pouring in the Alfredo sauce.

A spectacular shrimp pasta dish, and one worthy of serving to your special guests. Used the entire 16 oz. box penne pasta and 1-1/2 lbs. large shrimp rather than have small leftover amounts. Otherwise, essentially made as written. Used Classico Light Asiago Romano Alfredo Sauce which was very tasty, and grated Italian Pecorino Romano cheese (sharper taste than Romano made by large American producers). I wondered about draining off a little liquid after cooking the veggies but conflicted by not wanting to loose flavor. Decided not to, and with the sauce thickening a bit and the pasta absorbing some too, the Alfredo sauce turned out perfectly. Fantastic recipe JZELLER, and thank you for sharing.

We followed it to the letter, with the exception of using half and half instead of heavy cream. 

I will definitely make this again, but without the cayenne. We LOVE spicy things, but this was a bit too much for us.

Fantastic! Made it exactly as written! Watch the amount of cayenne however... 1 tsp was quite a kick for my taste. I would use less next time.

My dinner guests would probably give this a 5 star rating based on their favorable comments. I give it four stars because it wasn't quite awesome enough to rate 5 stars in my book.  I've made this twice and did make some changes based on reviews I read.  I changed the recipe to 10 servings and used about 3/4 tsp cayenne.  I did not add cream; instead I added 1/2 can diced, fire roasted tomatoes and I did like that change.  I did not add the romano cheese to the sauce; I sprinkled it on top of the dish and then sprinkled the parsley on top of that.  It was very attractive and I like the cheese on top.

Very good. Very easy and quick. I used thawed out frozen shrimp made this meal a breeze. Keep in mind if you are cooking for other people the cayenne is definitely not for everyone. My boyfriend liked it for the most part he just was not a big fan of the spiciness . I on the other hand loooooved the cayenne in this dish. A winner.

This is an excellent recipe! I followed the recipe pretty much the way it was, except I added Parmesean cheese since I had it on hand. It did make a lot for 2 people, so I froze some.  It was a great meal!
Thanks

I have been making this dish for quite some time now. I am an alfredo lover, and this is a very good dish.  I have not made this one time, without getting rave reviews.  I like my alfredo meaty, so I add boneless skinless chicken breast to this.  I also usually end up adding broccoli.  I have been told by a certain gentlemen that the way I make this is similar to a 5 star Italian restaurant's alfredo dish.  Very nice recipe.  Thanks for sharing Jzeller.

This was super-yummy and easy too. Only change: I used half as much cayenne and thought it still had plenty of heat, although this is a personal thing. And I used skim milk instead of cream. The consistency was still plenty thick, with fewer calories, and then you don't need to buy cream; everyone has milk on hand.

This was a great recipe. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my husband and I are unsure as to how it got the name Peppered. Any way you go, it is still an amazing meal. Next time I might consider adding Crushed Red Pepper for a little bit of kick.

Everything was easy to follow and straight forward. Nothing was hard to follow and my final product turned out to be really awesome. We just needed a little bit more pepper and salt and I think thats what I need to keep in mind for next time, but the overall outcome was really good. Yes I would recommend this recipe to other people, its easy and quick and goooooddd!!!

There's a lot of fat in this recipe and I cut it down by not adding the butter, using 10 ounces of light Alfredo sauce, and fat free half and half instead of cream.  Very delicious!

The recipe turned out well. It turned out well because of the easy to follow instructions. One of the changes that we did to the dish was substitute chicken for the shrimp. We used the same amount of chicken as the shrimp and it turned out fine. We also didn’t include mushrooms. We just don’t like mushrooms. The final product looked nice, it was covered in the Alfredo sauce and it looked delicious. we would definitely recommend this, it was delicious.

Yes I have tried this recipe and omg it was sooo good. Everything was easy to follow and straight forward. Nothing was hard to follow and my final product turned out to be really awesome. We just needed a little bit more pepper and salt and I think thats what I need to keep in mind for next time, but the overall outcome was really good. Yes I would recommend this recipe to other people, its easy and quick and goooooddd!!!

I love this recipe!  This is one of my new husband's favorites!  Super easy!  We chose to leave out the mushrooms.  I have used homemade alfredo and canned alfredo.  Canned is so easy for a quick meal!!  And still tastes great! (Can't even really tell it's canned!)

it was great, but if you have small children, ease up on the cayenne pepper......esp if reheating the next day. I guess the cayenne absorbes into everything, but its hotter the next day.

This is an awesome recipe. I actually got the Alfredo and Sun-Dried Tomatoes sauce instead of just Alfredo because I thought that just alfredo would have been too thick and creamy. My family isn't used to excessively creamy things. Skipped the parsley because I was lazy and the cayenne pepper because I didn't want it to be spicy. Used parmesan instead of romano, but close enough. Oh and I used rotini instead of penne because it worked better. Shrimp was great and so was the sauce. I've wanted to try this recipe for a while and now that I have, I can serve it to family friends and relatives with minimum fuss.

My husband is a shrimp fiend, but hates pasta...so this was an iffy recipe.  I thought I would try it anyway and lo and behold he loved it.  I did everything except the parsley.  And I used Parmesan cheese instead of Romano.

This was a very easy recipe to make and it was tasty enough... but it was just missing something. It may have been the type of alfredo sauce I chose. Maybe it just wasn't high quality enough.

I made some minor changes.  1/2 tsp. of cayenne instead of 1 tsp.  Did not add 1/2 cup grated Romano cheese or the 1/2 cup of cream as the Alfredo sauce has those ingredients and I made my own Alfredo sauce, recipe in allrecipes, Put the cooked penne in the sauce and served on plates and we added our own amount of Alfredo sauce on top.
It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!  Will definitely make it again.

Loved it!!! I can't afford the $8 to get 1/2 lb. of Portobello mushrooms at our local mkt. Nor can I afford the extra-virgin olive oil. And our small town grocery store didn't carry grated Romano. So I made with regular, cheap mushrooms, Canola oil, and parm/romano blend cheese. I'm sure the correct ingredients would have made this better, however, we loved this in spite of the changes I made. I had to promise that the next time shrimp goes on sale.....I will make it. Thank You, for sharing!!

My bf and I loved it but there is way too much pepper! 1 teaspoon of cayenne AND a whole red pepper? I cut the cayenne to 3/4, only used 1/4 red pepper and further diluted the sauce with about an extra 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1/4 cup milk. It was still pretty hot! :-) But I must say very tasty, he ended up licking the plate clean. If I had made the recipe as stated neither of us would have been able to eat it. I'm sure it's a personal preference thing but a little cayenne goes a long way by itself. (also used Classico's asiago and romano cheese alfredo, eliminated the need to buy cheese seperately) Looking forward to making this again! Thanks

My family loved it! I followed the recipe except I didn't have red peppers and I added a few shakes of hot sauce. Also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream & that worked just fine. I cut the portobello mushroom into long slices. Follwed another reviewers advice and didn't add extra salt. Pan seared shrimp & chicken cutlet strips separately to serve on the side for those who preferred either/or. Also steamed brocolli and everyone added it right on top. Will make this again!

YUMMO!
Family ate it up so quickly and said that it was THE BEST pasta dish EVER!
My family love, love, love spicy - so the 1 tsp of cayenne was just right! I did add spinach instead of parsley per the advice of another reviewer - and it was GREAT..
Better than restaurant quality for sure!

Great recipe!!! I added a whole cup of garlic and subbed the red pepper for a whole chopped tomato, then cooked all of the parsley in with the pasta instead of serving it on top.  This was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had.  Served with garlic/butter french bread to soak up leftover sauce, WONDERFUL.

Used this recipe last night for a simple anniversary dinner mid-week.  It was absolutely fantastic!  I only did half the onion that the recipe called for, but probably should have done the whole thing.  I added a bit more cayenne and it was a great combination.  Also added some sea scallops that I cooked off to the side and added right after the shrimp and it was fantastic.

Completed this recipe step-by-step...only thing I changed was using Parmesan cheese, which I had on hand, instead of Romano. It turned out wonderfully. I'm definitely going to be making this again soon. Super easy... Wonderful for left-overs the next day (I'm sitting here eating mine right now for lunch and it quite possibly tastes better than it did last night!).

Really good, except a little too spice so next time I'll cut the cayenne pepper to probably 1/8 tsp

Great recipe...quick and easy.  I modified slightly - used mushrooms from a jar; also used "Italian cheese mix" (mozzarella, parmesan and romano) bcs could not get 100% romano in our store.  Backed off on the cayenne a little bit, and used frozen pre-cooked shrimp (thawed).  Worked great...big hit!

Super delicious. Have had leftovers for lunch for 2days now. My husband made this and also added some lobster, skipped the cayenne pepper (3 y.o. eating it too), used whole milk over cream, used linguine instead of penne, used baby bellas and used a parmesan/romano mix. The red peppers gave it a delicious sweet flavor, and I like having the peppers/onions/mushrooms in there to get in some vegetable servings. Agree with comments of restaraunt quality.

Tasty! I served this with garlic bread and salad. *Careful with the cayenne if your sensitive to spicy foods. It may be a tad bit spicy for some.

This recipe was excellent and not to difficult to prepare. My family are garlic lovers and I added 2 extra garlic cloves. It also has the advantage of preparing it and then it ahead of time and adding the parts together and finish cooking it when it is time to eat.

My daughter was cooking a meal for her father and I found this simple recipe for her.  As it turned out it was easy and delicious!  We will definately make this again.  The only thing we changed was the cayenne pepper - used about 1/2 tsp. and used the President's Choice prepared Alfredo Sauce.

DELISH!! I subbed zucchini & broccoli for the mushrooms and added a little extra cayenne. Next time I would like to try this with half & half instead of cream to reduce fat and make a little less rich.

Amazing. Seriously tastes like it's from a restaurant.  But, If you don't like a lot of spice I would definitely half the tsp of cayenne pepper.  But, the group I made it for absolutely loved it.  I'm sure I will be making this again before long.

This was pretty good. I gave it 4 stars.  What would have made it a 5 star recipe? ....make your own alfredo sauce.  Alfredo sauce from a jar is like ranch dressing from a bottle.  It just has that underlying "tangy" taste.   If cost and time are a concern, stick with the jarred sauce.  However, this would be really impressive if you made you own sauce and follwed the recipe accordingly.

YUMMY!!  I too altered just a tad...Used baby bello mushrooms, frozen tri-colored peppers & half & half.  My husband said this is definately one of his favorites.  I used only 3/4 t of the cayenne pepper for my toddlers, but didn't really notice any kick at all.  I will definately use the whole teaspoon+ next time.

DELICIOUS!  I used 1 lb portobellos, 1/2 onion, added some chicken, and used fresh linguini.  My non-pasta husband loved it.  I've made it twice since then.  The second time I used frozen cut up peppers and onion and it was an easy weekday meal. No parsley either time.

I made this with homemade Alfredo sauce (a recipe I found on allrecipes). It came out to be VERY good. A little more garlic would have satisfied my palate.

Extremely easy and delicious recipe. My boyfriend enjoyed it and devoured the leftovers the next day. I used light cream instead and decreased the butter a little bit to lower the calories. Also, after plating, we topped it off with a little crushed red pepper for an added kick. Definitely recommended for those who like a little extra spice.

Wonderful recipe and so easy. My husband loved it, he said it tasted like something the Olive Garden would make. He's already asking when I plan on making it again. I only cnanged a couple of things -  I omitted the cayenne pepper and added 1 cup of cream.

This recipe is so easy and great! I omitted the bell peppers and onions since I do not care for those. I even added crawfish with the shrimp. I had an italian blend cheese and added that instead of just the romano and it was delish. Thanks!

This is an amazing dish - I've lurked for years and haven't posted my own review, but I just had to do it for this recipe.  I used Classico roasted garlic alfredo sauce and the additions (pepper, mushroom, cayenne) really spice it up so it doesn't taste like a jarred pasta sauce.  Paired with perfectly cooked al dente pasta, this dish is PERFECT!  My changes: used canned mushrooms (didn't have fresh on-hand), sour cream and ricotta instead of cream, parmesan instead of Romano.  I love a kick so I added 1.5 tsp cayenne and a generous sprinkling of crushed red pepper AND black pepper.

Loved it! Added extra garlic and parm, plus a rainbow of peppers. proportions were just about perfect. one of the few recipes i've hardly altered. Definitely a new staple. Hubby and kids loved it!
