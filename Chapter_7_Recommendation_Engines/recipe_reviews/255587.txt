Let me start by saying that my ingredients weren’t of the highest quality (tomatoes not in season and lacking that homegrown punch).  I also forgot to grab fresh mint at the grocery and used (gasp) dried mint that I crushed, hoping to release a hint of flavor.  Even so, I LOVED this.  I can’t wait to try this again with higher quality ingredients.  Other than that, I wouldn’t change a thing.  Thanks for another great recipe, Chef John!  You have yet to disappoint!

So simple but incredibly fresh and delicious. It’s a great way to use all the cherry tomatoes in the garden. I wonder if these could be canned...

Since I don't care for mint I replaced it with cilantro. Yummy!

Removing the skins really made the flavors pop!  I served it with a roasted pork sirloin, spinach and pasta. It was really refreshing, guests loved it and I will definitely make it again.
