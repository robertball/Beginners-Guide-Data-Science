I like it with or without the lemon pepper, usually do it without.  They're even better if you add the vegan sun-dried tomato pesto recipe from this site too!!!!

Could I give this 7 stars!!! Oh. my. Heaven. I made these for a dinner party, for I had picked a bushel of green peppers at a farm, and needed to use them up. They were the first things gone, and I could have eaten them all. My steaks were still on the grill and so we were just eating all the sides, and my guests said that they were so good they could've had these for the main course! They were tangy with the goat cheese, and the tart lemon pepper with the charred grilled pepper was to die for. I made them again for a friend and her husband, and he liked them so much, he mentioned putting the steak inside and making a pepper steak sandwich! Make them, you will love them!

This was a fantastic idea.  I used it as a basis for my own variation - caramelized some onions and sauteed some smoked turkey sausage, a little bit extra garlic, and some chopped tomatoes, and mixed together with the goat cheese to make a more substantial filling.  Absolutely delicious - thanks so much for the idea!

These are great!  I don't have a grill so I just broil in the oven.  

I have played around and have added feta to the cheese mixture.  Last night I added a couple of pepperoni slices to it and kind of made it like a pizza topping.  The pepperoni made it kind of like a Greek pizza.  I'm thinking of adding some chopped black olives next time.

The char of the grill and the contrast of the cheese is delightful. I used a mixture of feta and goat cheese. The feta adds a nice tartness that we like.

These were a unique dish, but there was just no "wow" factor to them. I followed the directions as written with no changes. Four stars for a creative recipe, though. Thanks!

These were good, i love goat cheese.  I didn'T measure the lemon pepper very close, it's easy to over do it.  i recommend serving as a side dish. I'd make this again.

This is excellent!  I also used feta cheese instead of goat cheese and my husband and I just went crazy for them!  It's a great way to do something different with all those peppers from the garden.

Wow! This is the first time I've ever felt compeled to write a review. These peppers were amazing and so easy to make! I didn't have any lemon pepper, so I put regular pepper and added the juice of a half lemon. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent. Used 1/2 goat and 1/2 feta cheeses. Don't have an outside grill so I just broiled them.

These are so addictive!  Very easy to prepare and versatile.  Use goat cheese, feta, cheese, or any other soft cheese that suits your fancy!  Have made them over and over with fresh peppers from the garden.

Delicious!  We had lots of sweet banana peppers, so I halved them, seeded them and then marinaded as the recipe says.  For the cheese I used crumbled blue cheese with a couple tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and fresh pepper.  Next time I will add fresh crumbled bacon to the cheese mixture.  Thanx PolkaDot, great recipe!

didn't make as written - we just grilled plain peppers (halfed and seeded). Once they were charred/soft enough I added in a misture of goat cheese and crumbled feta with fresh cracked black pepper. These are amazing and we have made them three times in the last two weeks! Will play around with adding in chopped jalepenos, crumbled bacon etc in the future...

Very good.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so I just used pepper.  It's missing *something.*  Other seasonings - cajun, etc. - would also go well on it.  I did not have a grill, so used a George Foreman Grill.

Great recipe ! I used red peppers and mixed a teaspoon of bottled lemon in the cheese since I didn't have the lemon pepper.  It gave it a nice zip.  Will make this over and over. My husband almost did not leave me any.  A nice colorful dish for a party appitizer.

I had some extra goat cheese left over from another recipe - this was a perfect way to use it up! I also used orange and yellow peppers. Served with steak and corn on the cob - Excellent!

Easy and good recipe. I served them as an appetizer for a small BBQ.  I had the lemon pepper in a grinder and I ground it too large, so I will do very finely ground seasoning next time. I actually baked them almost all the way and threw them on a the grill to heat them up when we arrived at the party.  They would have still been very good without grilling them.

Wow! I was wishing I'd made a double or even triple batch. Extremely delicious. I used red bell and "garlic & herb" spreadable goat cheese.

MAde these for a Sunday bbq and everyone loved them. I did a few things differently but highly recommend the changes. First, I used mini peppers (orange, yellow and red). I cut them in half and filled them with mixture before grilling. I use goat cheese, feta, pimentos, green onion, lemon pepper seasoning and salt and pepper. Grilled them on a bbq grill pan. They were awesome!!!

Very good recipe! I did put feta instead of goat cheese, just because that's what I had in my fridge. I also added olives because my husband loves them! Yum!!! :)

A nice way to use up some peppers.  I didn't find that the flavours commingled very well, what you have is grilled peppers with goat cheese.
