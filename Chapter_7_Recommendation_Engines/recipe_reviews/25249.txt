I was looking for creamed spinach I order at boston market.  This wasn't quite it but i think i got it.  I added about an extra tbsp of butter, half an onion, 2 garlic cloves, sauteed that.  added spinach, chicken bouillon cube and soup.  then I added about 1-2 tbsp parmesan cheese and about 1/4 cup milk.  ooooooh VERY GOOD almost perfect.

I modified this and used 10 ounces of fresh spinach (never go wrong with fresh veggies) , a can of cream of chicken, some fresh minced garlic, some chopped onion, kosher salt, and topped it with parm. cheese.  It came out ver well.  No complaints about this one.  I imagine any creamed soup would work but it will need seasoning.

Tis is by far the best ever creamed spinach we've ever had!  Had to join allrecipes just to rate this recipe.  Did follow others advice & sauted onions & garlic in butter first.  Also added about a 1" slice of cream cheese.  (Melted into soup, onion, garlic, butter mixture before adding spinach) Thank tou Lori!  This is a keeper!

This was simple and delicious.  My husband and sister-in-law both turned their noses up at the idea of spinach, then ended up going back for seconds and thirds.  I added fresh, chopped mushrooms and about half a cup of grated cheese.

The basic ingredents in this recipe are great.  I too modified it with 1 spoonful of cream cheese, parmesan cheese, and some of those "Real Bacon" bacon bits.  It was ready before the rest of dinner was, so I put it in the oven with some breadcrumbs on top and let it stay for 20 minutes.  Everyone, including kids, simply loved it.  Thanks!

This was even better the next day! I made a couple of alterations to the recipes, however, as suggested by other reviewers: I used a low-fat soup and fresh minced garlic and onion instead of garlic salt, and I added some sliced white button mushrooms for texture. Next time I will add black olives and some red pepper flakes for a different taste!

Pretty good.  Adaptions I made included sauting an onion and 2 cloves of garlic with some Italian seasoning.  Then I added the soup (using low fat cream of chicken instead.) and spinach.  I added a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese while cooking and more on top to serve.  The cheese is a must!

This was so yummy - it was pretty "soupy" but the flavor was good.  My kids weren't overly thrilled with it but the adults liked it!  Not good as leftovers though!

WOW! I also changed up my recipe a bit based on past reviewers. I added some cream cheese and then finished it in a small dish in the oven. I added some parmesan cheese to it before putting it in the oven. It is awesome! One thing is (which I am not sure if it was the cream cheese or not) but I did feel like more spinach in the dish would have been a perfect dish. But a 4.5 stars for sure! haha this is a must try!

This really was a quick and easy recipe for creamed spinach. Next time, though, I may add cooked bacon and onions for more "punch" to the flavor.

This dish was okay.  It wasn't particularly great or tasty, but it served its purpose as a side dish.

I was nervous when I was told to bring Creamed Spinach to my in-laws house one holiday, as my FIL considers himself a creamed spinach connoisseur.  I chose this recipe as 1) Looked easy, how hard could it be? and 2) Cream of mushroom soup makes everything delicious.  I was right!  Everyone loved it!

Simple and really good. I halved the recipe used cream of celery soup topped with bread crumbs and a little parm and baked. A nice to for a different side dish.

I love how easy this recipe is.  If you like really creamy creamed spinach, I'd suggest adding cream cheese or something as this recipe isn't really creamy.  I added a can of artichoke hearts and two cloves of garlic, cut up.  This is good reheated, too.

After reading all the other reviews, I decided to boil one bag of frozen chopped spinach (cheaper than the boxes of frozen spinach) and drain it carefully (pressing it against the sides of the colander with a wooden spoon until totally dry). I finely chopped half an onion and sliced 5 whole mushrooms, and sauteed them, and then added the rest of the ingredients (campbell's cream of mushroom soup, butter, spinach, and garlic salt). Totally delicious!

This is soo yummy to be so quick.  Didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of onion but as another reviewer said, I imagine you could use any "cream of" soup.  Instead of garlic salt I used salt, pepper to taste and smidgen of minced garlic and grated a little nutmeg in.  YUMALICIOUS

I use this as a base recipe (hence the 3 stars), but after adding in some sour cream & cream cheese it's a 5-star recipe!! My sister was skeptical the first time I made it for her family, but she now makes it herself :)

Pretty good.  I had some fresh spinach left over and nothing to make "traditional creamed spinach" so I tried this last minuite and it turned out great.

Quote from my daughter, "This doesn't even taste like spinach, ymmmmm".  I did carmelize some onions and garlic before I added spinach and soup to pan.

This was very yummy! I added 2 tbsp of butter, sauted half an onion and some garlic. Then added soup with 1/3 cup milk and chicken boullion. Then added the cooked spinach. I then stired in a handful of parmesan cheese. I licked my plate!!

Quick, easy, and delicious!  I ended up making this twice in the span of two days, once with fresh spinach and once with frozen.  I substituted creamy broccoli soup for the cream of mushroom soup, and it came out beautifully.

This was excellent!  I did use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom and added some sauteed onion and garlic as mentioned in other comments, also the 1/4 milk.  Hubby loved it.  Can't wait to try making it again but using more spinach, I used what I had from an already opened bag of fresh spinach....a little too creamy but it was my mistake.  This is definitely a keeper!

Awesome! I ate this up like it was my last meal ever! I did make a couple of changes though. Used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom soup. Sauteed some fresh garlic and mushrooms and added them in. I also put my own spices in- salt and pepper, a little italian seasoning and parmasan. It was so good I scarfed down a lot of it before putting it on the plate! So good I'm making it again tonight. Thank you for my new favortite recipe!

LOVE IT!!! I'm so glad I found this recipe! All tho it says to add garlic salt to taste! I found out on my own that I don't need to add that. All I did was add cream cheese and 2 table spoons of butter and that got enough taste from there. Anyway thank u for this helpful recipe. :)

I made this and it was a big hit.  I made some modifications... I sauteed about 1/3 cup of onion and garlic clove in some oil.  With the spinach and soup mix, I added about 2 oz of reduced fat cream cheese in addition to the butter.  Everyone loved it!

Very tasty and very easy to make. I did make a few changes...based on a few other reviews I added a little cream cheese to make it creamier. Also used fresh spinach since that is what i had on hand.

Excellent!!! Only a couple minor changes....I used a clove of garlic instead of the powder, added sauteed onion, and sprinkled in some red pepper flakes for a little kick. Only took minutes to make too! Thanks!

Soooo good! I LOVE cooking with mushroom soup and I was so excited to find this recipie. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and melted the butter with some minced garlic, then added the spinach. I mixed the soup with a little bit of milk before putting it in the spinich so it would be easier to mix, added a little bit of sour cream and some extra seasonings and wow! I will make this with every meal!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a great hit!  I had to triple the recipe for the amount of guests, but they devoured it so much so that there weren't leftovers.  I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and added some garlic, onion, heavy cream, etc.  It was delicious and will make this a lot!  Thanks a lot for the recipe!

Hands down best Creamed Spinach I ever ate. Super easy to make. Made a few changes (real minced garlic, added a touch of heavy cream, dash of pepper and paprika for color and sprinkled grated cheese on top).

This receipe offered a very good base, and once I added in everyone's suggestions (adding fresh onion and garlic, plus a little cream and parmesan cheeses... and a chicken boullion cube) the receipe went to 5 STAR!

I don't know what I was expecting - but this gloppy mess wasn't it. I sauteed some onions first, then I added the spinach, a can of cream of mushroom soup and some sauteed mushrooms. It was thick and gloppy. I added about 34 cup of half-and-half hoping to "cream" it out a bit, but it remained a big gloppy mess. I won't be making this again - and frankly, it's scared me from trying any other creamed spinach recipe (especially any that call for cans of condensed soup).

Thanksgiving morning I discovered that I was missing a key ingredient for my usual spinach casserole.  This recipe saved the day.  It was so good I may never make the casserole again.  Garlic pepper is also good in this recipe.

Such an easy recipe and really good. I also added about 1 1/2 t minced garlic. Personally, I thought it needed some salt which I added to it once it was on my plate. The other two diners did not add the salt. A very worthwhile dish that I predict will become a regular staple at my house!

I used fresh spinach rather than frozen. I let it stand for twenty minutes before serving for the flavor to soak in to the spinach.

I wanted to like this because it's such an easy recipe but it doesn't taste like creamed spinach but rather, spinach in mushroom soup. I added the sauteed onion and a little cheese as others did but didn't seem to help.   I gave it 2 stars only because it was easy but I won't make it again, I'm sorry to say.  My guests who were friends here for dinner agreed.

Just made this recipe.. sooo yummy, ready to eat it all by myself!! hopefully the family will agree to how tasty it is.. I took the suggestions of others and sauteed onion and garlic in butter with a lil salt and nutmeg, then added a touch of cream cheese and then cream of mushroom soup.. I then added fresh spinach.. Came out real good.. I am actually going to put in the oven for a bit with some parmesan cheese on top. Should go great with my pork chops.. Looking forward to dinner tonite!! Thanks for the recipe!

This receipe is great and super easy.  I personally only used 1 box of frozen spinich and 1 can of mushroom soup.  I added maybe a 1/4 cup of milk, 1/4 of an onion, garlic, italian & oregano seasoning and about 1/4 cup of parmasen cheese. All that was missing was bacon.

I started with a roux of butter, garlic, onion, and flour, then added the soup and spinach and cooked for about a minute and then threw in a handful of shredded parmesan, and a 1/2 inch slice of cream cheese.  Since I prepared this before dinner I put it in a casserole dish and sprinkled Italian bread crumbs, parmesan, and asiago on top and put it in the oven for about 10 minutes.  It was pretty good.  It didn't blow my mind but I suppose it would take a lot cheesier and fattier recipe to do that.  This one was still moderately healthy so I thought it was a good compromise.

liked this one a lot! But, I must admit that I am a garlic freak and added garlic and onion to butter and sauted then I added a little cream cheese ( 2oz.) but I dont think this recipe needed the cream cheese. I also used fresh spinach and steamed it for 3 min.--big  difference in flavor!

Easy and quick. However, I cut down on the amount of cream of mushroom since one of the reviews commented the soup base was overpowering and replaced with chicken stock.  Since this thins the sauce, I start with a roux, melted the butter and added a spoonful of flour. Made sure the flour and butter was cooked then added stock and cream of mushroom. Once it thicken add the spinach.

Very quick and simple but ultimately it just tastes like spinach and mushroom soup.  Needs A LOT of modifications.  My mom took 1 bite and couldn't eat anymore (and we eat spinach on almost a daily basis).  I'll keep looking for a low-fat, simple creamed spinach recipe.

So this needed some spicing up when I tasted it although it could have been because I used canned spinach instead of frozen. I sauteed half an onion in butter with minced garlic and added that to the spinach and I also added a little whipping cream just because I had it on hand. I wouldn't buy it just for this, but figured what the heck since it was in the fridge :o) I got a few compliments on this dish at my uncle's b-day party, but not as many as I wanted! I would probably make it again in a pinch since it's so fast and easy.

This was a great easy recipe. My family loved it with the cream of mushroom soup. We will be making this again! I did add a good bit of fresh garlic, and black pepper which made it even better!

I've had this in my recipe box for a while and finally tried it tonight.  We thought it was good enough to make again and possibly add to our regular rotation.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added chopped onion and minced garlic sauteed in butter until golden.  I also added some Parmesan cheese and enough milk to thin the mixture just a bit and a little salt & pepper to taste.  I think next time I'll add a little lemon juice for extra kick.  Has anyone tried Durkee french fried onions?  I think that might be a good addition as well.  Great basic starter recipe!

UPDATE - I used one package of frozen spinach and one bunch of fresh spinach.  It was probably more than the recipe called for in the end but it was the perfect consistency.  I didn't have to add cream cheese to make it thicker/creamier.  Still need some added flavor though.  I sauteed onion and garlic with the bunch of fresh spinach and added about 2 tbsp of Parmesan cheese plus a dash of salt.  Perfect, my way!*****It was really easy to make but bland.  Needed a bit work in the end.  I added sauteed chopped onions and minced garlic, 1/4 cup milk, 2 tbsp parmesan cheese, and a dash of salt.  Even after this, it wasn't as thick/creamy as I liked but it didn't taste that bad.  Next time, I will try adding cream cheese as others suggested.

It was a good base for the spinach.  Like other comments before I also added minced garlic, onion and cream cheese.  The dish was a hit.  Everyone wanted to take some home with them, plus I was asked for the recipe.  I will make again.

Very good recipe. Even my 4 and 6 year old daughters liked it.  I was craving creamed spinach but didn't have alot of time.  Anyway, it was very tasty.  I added the sauteed onion, garlic, and cream cheese to the recipe, and it turned out great.  I will definitely use it again.

Wow... this was delicious.  Plus it's much healthier than your normal creamed spinach recipe and it's easier too.  I did follow the advice of the reviewers before me and sauteed an onion and some garlic in a little bit of butter before adding the cream of mushroom soup and spinach.  It was delicious.  Between 3 of us, there was nothing left.  I even used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup.

I thought the recipe was great.  I am not a huge spinach lover so I made a few changes to this one. First of all, I used 4 tablespoons of butter and sautéed diced onions, 2 cloves of garlic and some bacon bits (real bacon bits).

I also used 16-17oz of fresh spinach instead of frozen spinach.  Although I should have added a little milk to the soup to thin it out just a tad, I thought it turned out great.  

Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs are a must.

This was a good recipe, but I made a few changes. I used one 10 oz package of spinach, and about 3/4 can low fat cream of mushroom soup.(a whole can would have been too creamy) Next time I'll probably try cream of chicken or cream of broccoli, for a little different flavor.

It was really easy and pretty tasty but not the consistancy I was looking for. I added 4oz of cream cheese and that made it a bit thicker and it was great. It does heat up really well also, I reheated mine about 3 times and it was just as good as the first time.

Very easy and very good.  I simply cooked the spinach in the microwave with no water.  It has enough on its own.  Then I drained it exremely well and added it to a saucepan with the soup and so on.  I thought it needed some punching up though, so I added a 1/4 teaspoon of parsley and oregano.  My husband and I liked it very much.  A recipe keeper for sure!  I am thinking of trying cream of celery soup next time just to see which I like best.

I tried this and it turned out great but I felt it was lacking something.  I decided to add a little more texture to it and added diced water chestnuts.  It turned out great!  You don't have to alter anything else in it.  The crunchy and creamy texture goes great.  My family couldn't stop eating it!

I only used one package of chopped frozen spinach, and also added a little bit of milk. Turned out great! Perfectly creamy and delicious. There was a bit left over, so the next day we reheated and had it over toast, which was actually pretty tasty! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great quick side dish.  I have made many times. I have used only one box of spinach, non-fat mushroom soup and cut the butter down to 1 teaspoon and it always turns out great.  Have tried adding onions also.

Quick and Simple recipe!  This was awesome!  I actually just use 1 package of spinach to make it alot creamier, and fresh mushrooms added makes it even better.  This rocks!

I turned this into a one pan lunch meal. I only had 1 bag of fresh spinach so I added 1 large clamshell container of fresh kale. I had a lot then in pan so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and then I added in a pack of organic hot dogs cut-up and a can of black eyed peas. I used olive oil instead of butter. When it was finished cooking I sprinkled pepitas on top. It was a very good easy to make quick lunch for my family.  I took a picture of  it on my plate.

It was good, however, next time I would take the suggestion of some others and use half the amount if cream cheese and add one more egg. I think I’ll add chopped onion and mushroom too.  I’ll make it again with these alterations and how it turns out.

The recipe as shown is bland and tastes nothing like a good creamed spinach is supposed to taste. With that being said the rating for this dish is extremely elevated and misleading because once reading the reviews you'll almost everyone if not everyone modified the recipe to make a 4 star dish. Waste of time and food. SMH

This is a fast side dish and a good base recipe ! I finely chopped 2 large garlic and 2 shallots sautéed  them in olive oil with 2 (9oz each) bags fresh spinach just until it wilts. I took my kitchen shear and cut up the spinach into smaller pieces right in the pan ( I didn't want long strands ).  I dumped in 2/3 can of healthy request cream mushroom soup and 1/3 low fat cream cheese block. Stir around on low heat until creamy. I seasoned with plenty of black pepper and dash of salt and hint of red pepper flakes. Delicious !

Cooked frozen spinach straight from bag in microwave bowl, nothing to drain. Added 1 can  mushroom soup, liberal shake of garlic salt and 3 ounces of cream cheese. topped with a dusting of nutmeg. Came out great and quick.

A great and quick recipe!  I added lemon juice, grated cheese mix and parmesan cheese to it.  I was afraid to go overboard by adding too much, but definitely would add more to it.  A very versatile recipe you can alter, but is very tasty!

I added a half an onion and about 5 garlic cloves.  tastes great but using just the condensed soup leaves it looking like gel when it starts to cool and is cooled which is a major turn off and totally gag worthy.  But the flavor is great, next time I want to try it with a cream of mushroom soup that is not condensed and and it needs some seasoning of some kind.  I will have to play with it.

This was good, but I followed Christina's recommendation.  I sautéed onion and garlic in butter.  Then added fresh spinach and the cream of mushroom soup.  I added 1/4 cup of milk and parmesan cheese.  I enjoyed it very much, my husband just thought it was "okay".  I gave this 4 stars because you definitely have to modify it based on the reviews!!

Was easy to make and sounded good in theory, but we quickly discovered that creamed spinach felt like it had already been chewed. Not one for my family, but still a great recipe.

This turned out delicious. The only change I made was to use fresh, crushed garlic and then a bit of salt in place of garlic salt. The whole family liked it.

Yes, it was easy but it wasn't as good as "the real thing". Next time I'll take the time to do it up right.

We used fresh spinach, cooked it with a little butter until it wilted. This is the first creamed spinach we had, although the spinach itself was tasty, the cream of mushroom overpowered it.  It was 'okay'.

I also sauteed some shallot and garlic before adding the spinach and soup!  At the end I added a dash of heavy cream and topped off with  parmesan cheese than finish it off in the oven!  EXCELLENT!!!!!

I agree with the last poster. It tastes like spinach and mushroom soup. I think if you have had creamed spinach before, and really liked it, then you will probably like this. I had never had creamed spinach before, and will probably never again. It just seems "blah" to me. I would rather use the spinach for a salad, or just with butter and salt, otherwise I am wasting my calorie intake!

This recipe was awesome!  First time I'd tried creamed spinach, and it turned out wonderfully.  I cut the recipe in half, since it's just me here, but the only changes I made was to add a little minced onion and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I rated the recipe as it is, but with some minor additions it became a 5 star dish that even my family who doesn't really like frozen spinach loved (my 8 yr old said she could "eat a gallon of it!").  I added about 1/4 c of cream cheese and about 1/4 c of very finely chopped onion and a few shakes of garlic powder.

Great spinach recipe, maybe even as good as the cream spinach we get at our favorite high-end steak houses here in Boston.  I followed others advice and sauteed an onion and garlic first and also added cream cheese and bacon bits.  Tripled the recipe for a large Christmas gathering and it's great!   Bon appetit!

This was just ok.  The spinach wasn't soft enough.  Restaurant kind is a lot creamier too.  I will try to make this again with a few adjustments - possibly more cream cheese next time.

This is exactly what we were looking for.  I made it exactly as stated, and I was very happy with the results....more importantly my husband and 2 toddlers loved it too!  My son asked "Can we always have spinach like this??"

What a great, easy way to make cream spinach.  (and a lot cheaper than the store bought kind)  I used 2- 10 oz bags of fresh spinach leaves.  I wilted them in a frying pan with olive oil.  I used cream of celery soup because that's all I had and seasoned just with the garlic salt.  I thought it was perfect.  Maybe next time a can of water chestnuts would be a nice addition, but by no means necessary. After we ate our initial dinners, we scooped up the remaining creamed spinach with Tostitos scoops!!  Yum-Yum!

This was delicious! I did as others and sauteed onions and garlic in butter then threw that in with the spinach and cream of mushroom soup.  My first time making creamed spinach, my 11 year old and 15 month old loved it!

Yuck! I used a low-fat cream of mushroom but still added the butter and used fresh garlic rather than garlic salt. I even added parmesan cheese. No one (5 adults) wanted to eat this!

This was surprisingly good. I followed the advice given by CHRISTINATEASLEY in her review. I am not a spinach person and I had two servings. My two-year-old ate his in about two bites and cried for more. This was a great recipe, and I will make it again.

I was expecting this to taste like cream of mushroom soup but it didn't at all. I was pleasantly surprised. My 2 yr old who dislikes veggies, gobbled it up and kept asking for more. I used fresh spinach, minced garlic and parmesan cheese as others had suggested. Yummy. Will make this again.

An excellent start!! I started with 2 tbsp. butter and sauteed half an onion and one clove of garlic, then I used 12 oz. of fresh spinach instead of frozen.  After that wilted down, I let it cook for about 10 min and mixed in half a can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup Parmesean and Romano cheese mixed.  Let it warm though, and FABULOUS!!!

This was pretty good.  I was leary of using a cream soup for yet another recipe but time was against me and creamed spinach was really on my mind!  I used a 16oz. bag of frozen spinach and kept the other amounts the same but also threw in some fresh chopped garlic.  I've had much better results when i've used whipping cream or half and half but like i said i was out of time and those items.  This suficed but i think unless neccesary, I'll stick to the original without using creamed soups. Thank you for the post, it's really not bad, just not very authentic.

I don't usually like spinach, but I gave it a try.  I also added 1/2 an onion, 2 garlic cloves, 1/4 cup mile and some parmesan cheese.  I decided to use leftovers with pasta. So I cooked rotini pasta, added the creamed spinach, added 1/3 a can of cream of mushroom and a little more milk and cheese. That made a great meal!

WOW!!!!
This was sooooo good. Taking other advice, I also sauted onion and garlic in butter before adding the soup. Also, I put in parmesan cheese as the last step. I used one box of frozen and one bag of fresh spinach as well.
This was quick, easy and yumm-O!!!!

Eh.  It was good but I wasn't especially wild over it.  Sauteed onion and added garlic and cayenne, used fresh spinach, added a sliver of cream cheese too.  Okay but not fabulous.

We're big spinach lovers, but this just didn't cut it for us.  I added the onion and garlic, cajun seasoning, and some feta and cheddar cheese...maybe I overdid it, but won't do this again.

Made this last night for Valentines dinner for my husband. It was so simple and really good. I used reduced fat, low sodium cream of mushroom and reduced fat cream cheese. Definitely follow other reviewers and use chopped garlic and onions.

So good and so easy!  I was running out of oven space and couldn't make our traditional spinach casserole and found this terrific stovetop version.  Based on the review of others, I added onions that were fried til golden, a small can of mushrooms, drained, added a bit of garlic, and a good handful of cheddar cheese. Very good!  Will make this again!

I was looking for a very easy recipe that I could throw together.  The only change was that I sauteed garlic, then threw the spinach, butter, and soup in the pan.  My sister said it exceeded her expectations for her Dinner party and she kept the rest of it.  Will definately make again.

Pretty good. This is much better if you add onions and mushrooms. Also, no extra salt is needed if you use the condensed soup.

My 5 star rating comes from the fact that I have never had creamed spinach before and after trying it only this one time, I know I want it again!  I added chopped onion, garlic and a small amount of parmasean as per other's suggestions and I would definitely do that again.

This was so quick, easy and delicious!  I made this recipe without adding anything and my husband couldn't believe it didn't have any cheese in it and he loved it.  Next time, I will try a few of the suggestions.

I'm not a huge spinach fan, but am making an effort to eat more of it, so this was a nice option. I used 1 10 oz. packages of fresh spinach, and low fat soup... added in a couple cloves of garlic, and pepper. Baked in the oven for 15 minutes with a little bread crumbs and parm on top. Easy to make!

This was very easy and quite yummy. My 2 year old gave it the thumbs up. I took the leftovers and thinned it a bit with milk, added a little mashed tofu and mixed up with cooked pasta. Toddler lunch! Thanks for sharing :)

I thought the basic ingredients were a good foundation but tasted bland.  With parmesan cheese and freshly sautted onions and garlic really made awseome,  Kudos to everyone who are making their own modifications .   It was awesome with the extra touches.

This was just ok.. Not sure if I'll make it again. I have never had creamed spinach so I didn't know what to expect. This recipe might make a good filling for a stuffed chicken tho, so I think I'll try it again.

I made this recipe and thought it was tasty, when using modifications like the others who've reviewed this recipe.  I added a small can of mushrooms and sauteed onion and garlic first.  I'll make it again, but it isn't a favorite - just a decent way to get spinach into my body.

I made one portion of this just for myself, so I took a wild guess on how much, and 2/3 cups of spinach plus 1 cup of condensed soup (with an additional 1 cup water) and it turned out to be the perfect consistency. I also left out the butter and mixed in 1/4 teaspoon of Dijon mustard instead. It was PERFECT. Great recipe! Lots of room for experimentation.

The consistency was fine and the dish was quite popular at my Thanksgiving, but I think there should've been more flavor in the spinach.
