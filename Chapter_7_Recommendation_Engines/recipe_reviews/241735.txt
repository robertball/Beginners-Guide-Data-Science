Mark's Surprise Meatloaf Haiku: "What is the 'surprise'? Is it the cayenne pepper? Or beef measurement?" Checked and re-read, and yup, it says "1 1/2 cups ground beef", and I could only assume that meant pounds, but I ended up using 1 lb. anyways, along w/ the rest of the ingredients decreased to 6 servings. Not sure what the surprise was; surprise! It's a little too salty, or surprise! There's a little kick from the cayenne pepper, or surprise! I've never brushed olive oil on top of a meatloaf b4. But well, we were surprised at how good it ended up tasting, but not thrilled that even after letting it sit, it didn't slice into nice pieces pfffflooof more of a crumble-loaf, but a tasty one.

I used red bell pepper rather than green (personal preference), and I did cut back on the pepper, salt, and cayenne to a level that I thought my granddaughters could handle.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  If you read the first review, you'll see that AR fixed a typo in their ingredients!

This was simple and delicious - a nice change from all the ketchup covered meatloaves.
