My mom is from England and she has made mint sauce for years. Mint sauce is about the mint not the vinegar... In a sauce pan take a fist full of fresh mint leaves that have been coarsely chopped and place them in the pan with 2 cups of simmering water. Let it simmer on med.low heat for 15 min. then add two level table spoons of white sugar and mix till dissolved; then add three table spoons of apple cider vinegar and simmer for a few more min. Taste to see if you would like more sweet or tart and add some more sugar or vinegar to your liking. The true English Style Mint Sauce has more mint flavor and less tartness. Enjoy.

This is the mint sauce I have been looking for, for a long time.  It was perfect with the roasted rack of lamb.  I did add a good amount of sugar.  It turned out perfect.  I will use this a lot now.  Thank you for putting it on.

Definitely way too tart as is and also very runny. I added another tbsp of mint and about a tsp of sugar. With these changes was much more like what I remember my step mum making when I was a child. Thanks

I mixed cider and red wine vinegars for this one, and I also added between 1/2 and 3/4 of a tsp of sugar to help cut the tartness.  It tastes just like I remember it did back when lamb with mint sauce was served for our school dinners in England in the mid-80s.

Way too tart. Definitely stir in a little white sugar bit by bit until it is how you like it.

It's so surprising that a sauce that difficult to find store-bought is so easy to make at home! Thanks a million for sharing, I will never scour the aisles for ready-made again!

I added quite a bit of sugar as it was way too tart for me as well, but it turned out very nice.

This was really not what I remember as mint sauce. Extremely tart even with sugar added. My quest goes on!

I tried this recipe tonight using several ounces of organic mint leaves  purchased on sale at the local farmer's market. 

I tossed all the leaves into a Dutch oven on top of the stove, and let it simmer for about thirty minutes.  

I then added the three tablespoons of white sugar and cider vinegar, as suggested in on of the above recipes. 

The "sauce" is watery tastes fairly bland, and I can't taste much mint flavor. I would like a stronger tart flavor, but wonder if more vinegar would totally over power the mint.

Not sure what I will do with it.

Too tart for me even with 2 tsp sugar added.  I used red wine vinegar, but next time I'll try the British standard malt.
