I had a blast making these! The recipe submitter said any juice could be substituted for the orange juice. I chose white grape juice so that you could see through them and also because orange juice has a tendency to give me heartburn. For the apple I chose a Granny Smith to give it some tartness. I'd use a sweeter one if making them for kids. You really should give this one a try for your kiddos. It's super easy and fun too.
