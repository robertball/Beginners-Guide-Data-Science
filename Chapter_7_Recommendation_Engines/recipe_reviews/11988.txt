I was a little nervous about this recipe, as no one else had reviewed it yet...I figured I'd give it a go! Let me start by saying that this is the best sausage and peppers I have EVER had!!!! I followed the recipe exactly, and I am not sorry about a thing! Well, I did add a little extra water as the sauce was a little to thick, and we like to serve it on rolls. Don't be intimidated by all of the spices in this sauce...it makes your taste buds stand up and take notice. Thank you Jimmy for this recipe and for not being afraid to add a little of this and a little of that...BRAVO!!!

I made this exactly as written except I added a few more anchovys. Absolutely delicious and addictive. One of the best sauces I've ever made.

UPDATE: MY BF & I JUST HAD LEFTOVERS. THE SAUCE (AS IS) IS VERY THICK. TODAY IT WAS REALLY THICK (ALMOST THE CONSISTENCY OF TOMATO PASTE!). I THEREFORE, ONLY RECOMMEND EATING THIS FRESH. Pretty good sauce. Made this for dinner last night. My bf enjoyed it and thought it was quite filling (it was just "OK" for me). My only complaint (if you can call it that...) is the expense incurred for MSG (never used it in all my years of cooking!), vermouth and anchovies. I ended up tossing most of my leftover anchovies as they do not refrigerate well and I rarely ever use them. I WILL use the vermouth, although not often (most of my recipes do not call for it and I do not care for martinis...). I found MSG at my local specialty spice store (small bag only cost $1.75) and REALLY cheap, freshly made Italian sausage at the Italian market. Neither the vermouth or anchovies lent a distinct taste to the sauce (IMHO). In the future, I think both could be omitted. Served over penne pasta with a side of sun-dried tomato & garlic parmesan artisan bread to soak up all the yummy sauce and spumoni ice cream/Italian butter cookies (compliments of my Italian bakery) for dessert! A couple of things to note: This makes a TON (def. more than 4 servings worth). Also, if you are concerned about using anchovies... DON'T BE. They dissolve into the simmering sauce and are barely noticeable. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good red sauce!  I took this to a potluck and there was not a sausage left!  I did all of it in a fry pan and then transferred it to the crock pot and it worked like a charm.  The only ingrediants I didn't have were sage and fennel.  I don't care for fennel.  Any way there is a lot of ingrediants, but it is easy to do and tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a great recipe.  I added fresh herbs as I grow them, and didn't have sweet vermouth so used a blush zinfandel, but really didn't stray from the original posted recipe. (didn't add MSG either)You must use anchovies, it makes all the difference!
My entire family loved, loved,loved it.
Thanks

A really wonderful recipe -- definitely the best sauce I've ever had on pasta! My family loved it (even my picky little brother).

AMAZING! WOW! Absolutely the best red sauce I've ever prepared. This recipe is a long-term keeper. I made this for friends and nobody noticed I used low fat sausage instead of the regular Italian sausage.

I made this recipe yesterday, and I do have to say it was very tasty. I will be making this again in the near future. Thanks for a great recipe Jimmy!
