pertty good recipe, wasnt sure what flaovors to expect but it turned out great. Also works great as a dipping sauce for dumplings and spring rolls. Add some pepper flakes for extra spice.

Not bad, but I used Sake, Japanese rice wine instead.

I really liked it. Such a simple and flavourful recipe that doesn't require tons of effort. Something I will definitely be going back to. Instead of frying, I used cooking spray and baked at 375 for 40 minutes, garnished with fresh tarragon. Still came out great, and crispy!! A suggestion for those who don't like the calories/mess/smell of deep frying.
