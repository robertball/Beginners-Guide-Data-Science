I loved this recipe. The only complaint I got was that the cake was a little dry. I would make this again, but maybe tone down the peppermint a little.

Wonderful cake!  We used peppermint extract instead of vanilla & it was perfect (same measurement). Icing was too heavy for us, so we used cool whip to frost & added the peppermint candies.  Perfect and refreshing!!
