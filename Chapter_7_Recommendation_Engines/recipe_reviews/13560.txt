I made these for Thanksgiving this year, my dad's wife asked me to bring noodles.  Historically, I have not had great luck with noodles - ask me to bring Pork Tenderloin en Croute, no problem, but noodles defied me.  These turned out great, and I think I figured out what I had done wrong in the past - not enough flour.  They were terribly sticky initially, and I thought they were done for, I added a tad more flour a Tablespoon at at time and they turned out great!  I rolled them out on the counter-top with plenty of flour top and bottom, and covered them with a tea towel and let them sit for a hour before cutting with a pizza cutter.  I tossed the cut noodles in the leftover flour and popped them into a baggie and frozen them for the next day.  I left them frozen until I popped them into the boiling water.  We served them naked so folks could put gravy or butter on them.  Very good, I will make them again.  Oh, one comment, I used freshly ground black pepper - I LOVE pepper, and they were almost too peppery - almost.

I've made noodles at Christmas every year for the past 7 years...they NEVER turn out UNTIL NOW!!!!  I changed to this recipe this year and am so proud of the results! :0)  Truly appreciate this recipe and will use it more than once a year due to how easy it is and how great the noodles taste!  Thank you!
