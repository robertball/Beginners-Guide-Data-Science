Delicious, traditional recipe!  I did use chicken broth rather than water but otherwise followed the recipe and I could not be more delighted.  It is smooth, flavorful and easy to prepare.

We loved this.  Of course, we love pate but this one reminded me of the Chicken Liver pates that we ate in Tuscany...and that's a good thing.  This does make quite a large batch of pate, so have a bunch of pate lovers at your next party or plan to freeze some (it will freeze well).  This is my new go to pate recipe...its that good.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

The recipe does not call for draining the livers after they are cooked.  The first time I made this it was a bit soupy.  The second time, I drained the liver mixture with a slotted spoon.  Much better consistency. Also substituted brandy for the cognac.   Really good!

The taste was great but it didn't set, rather it had the consistency of a thick soup.
