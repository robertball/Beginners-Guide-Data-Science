Absolutely wonderful! I used a 12.75oz bottle of champagne vinegar (it makes the best base). I selected Purple Basil (it makes it a lovely blush colored vinegar) and a couple sprigs of chives from my container garden. Boiling the vinegar is necessary - don't skip this step! I took a class years ago on making flavored vinegars and this process is identical! 

This vinegar is simply fabulous used as a salad dressing: In a bowl, mix (to your taste) a splash of oil, splash of flavored vinegar, splash of fresh squeezed lemon juice and salt! Once mixed toss with salad! It's fantastic! My absolute favorite hands down!

A great substitute for Basil is 2 sprigs of fresh Rosemary and 2 sprigs fresh Tarragon - the BEST!

Thanks for the post!

Wonderful just to have on hand--especially good with a tomato, red onion and mozzerella cheese salad.
