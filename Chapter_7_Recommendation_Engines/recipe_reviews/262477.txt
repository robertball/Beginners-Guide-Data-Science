My family is trying to eat more plant based meals and this was a huge hit.  My 13 year old loved it and ate the whole bowl.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.

Turned out amazing, I only omitted the red peppers and red beans and added crushed red pepper and extra onions. Definitely very filling and tasty.
