This was delicious and so colorful.  I omitted the atichokes and snow peas and added some frozen corn.  It makes a lovely presentation...so colorful.  I made it to take to my mother-in-laws for Easter.  Too bad we left it at home sitting on the counter top!  It would have been a nice addition to the meal! :)

This is a pretty side dish of veggies that would grace your table any time of year.  My only sub was to use chives instead of green onions.  If I do this again, I will cut the steaming time a bit.  For our tastes, the crunchier, the better, so I would like to try this adding all the veggies to the skillet without the water, and saute until heated through.  I do like the combination.

This was very yummy! Took it to a carry-in and had no leftovers. Because I had to prepare it and then carry it and it sat until we ate, the vegetables got mushy. Still very tasty, but I'm sure it would be better fresh.

I will make this again, it tasted so fresh! I increased snow peas to 2 cups and decreased the peas to 1/2 cup.  Added chopped garlic last 2 minutes when cooking onion and added a few shakes of crushed red pepper flakes with the green onion tops. Added asparagus and snow peas  after cooking carrots two minutes so they would be crisp. Can't wait to make it again!
