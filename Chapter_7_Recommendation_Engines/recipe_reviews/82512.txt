I prepared this dish for some dinner guests from Kenya because mango is such a staple over there.  They loved it!  He said that he didn't like most American desserts because they are too sweet, but he thought this was perfect.  So that tells you that it is not a rich dessert, if that's what you're looking for.  I just used plain white bread like the recipe called for but perhaps using the Hawaiian bread that a previous reviewer used would give it a little extra sweetness.  I personally love sweet, rich desserts so I probably would not make this again for myself, but I'm giving it 5 stars on behalf of my friends from Kenya.  And it's so quick and easy to make that I give it 5 stars in that department.  One more note--I could not find cardomom in the grocery store so I substituted a combination of cinnamon and ginger.

Just like some of the others, I was unsure of how the combination of bread pudding and mango was going to taste.  This recipe was so simple.  My mother-in-law is German and a fantastic cook.  I made this and brought it over to her for her to taste.  I carried it in, set it down on the counter and went out to my car to get something else. When I returned to the house I caught her with spoon in hand already eating the mango bread pudding right out of the baking dish.  I laughed and she remarked how tasty it was.  She just about ate the whole thing.

Next time I make it I will make sure that I pour the egg cardomon mixture onto the bread/mangoes immediately after mixing the cardomon in.  I didnt the first time and the cardomon had all settled to the bottom of the mixture and consequently it was all concentrated in the same area of the baking dish.

This recipe is a winner in my book!

This was a hit.  We had a bunch of mangos and tried this.  We didn't have Cardamom, so substituted pumpkin spice and cinnamon.  Also we used Hawaiian sweet bread instead of plain white bread, and added raisins too.

This is an excellent recipe. I love mangos and was looking for some good ways to use them, and my husband loves bread pudding so I figured this would be perfect. The only thing I changed was to reduce the cardamom to 1 tsp for fear of it being overpowering, and I thought that amount was perfect. I also really urge people not to replace the cardamom with another spice- it gives such an amazing flavor to the mango. I made this in ramekins, and topped them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream- delicious, and looked pretty too!

I love bread pudding & I love mangoes but I was unsure of the two together...I shouldn't have been....this was good! I had 3 WW kaiser rolls that needed to be used so I used those, I had two small mangoes & one large so I used all three & I added a little more sugar. My eggs were very large so I just added a bit more milk to compensate for the additional bread. On the test bite, I thought it might need a sauce to accompany it but then I couldn't stay out of it while I was cooking dinner so evidently not. LOL The first thing my hubby said to me this morning was to say again how good the bread pudding was so I guess it's a winner in his book too.

Pretty tasty. Good texture and easy to make.   I halved the recipe and baked the pudding in four 6 ounce ramekins.  Not exceptionally sweet and the cardamom is a little overpowering for me--next time I'll cutting the amount of cardamom and adding cinnamon, and perhaps some raisins.  Will probably be really good with whipped cream, custard sauce, or ice cream, too.

I was looking for a healthy bread pudding recipe for our extra baguettes, and this was it!
This is a great combo (it tastes like an indian dish that is basically mango pulp with cardamom), and I lightened it up by using Splenda and Smart Balance instead of butter.  It was really delicious and not too sweet-- my entire family loved it.  Crunchy on top, kind of a custard on the bottom, and the mango adds plenty of fiber!  Thanks for this great recipe!!

Just wanted to let anyone that needs cardamom that it can be found in middle eastern and international food stores. Th middle east stores sell it quite cheap and it works well in rice dishes and makes coffee flavorful too. Definitely a spice you are missing out on if you never tried it before..... This recipe is fabulous

Loved, loved, loved this recipe.   Made it for friends who were duly impressed.  Then, made it again substituting plums for the mango and yep, still fantastic!   This recipe is a keeper.  Love the cardamom spice in this. So flavorful!

Halved recipe, used 1.5 qt casserole and baked for 30 min.  I made two batches, one with a cinnamon raisin bread and one with a bagguette.  The cinnamon raisin batch had too many competing flavors the first day, but given a chance to meld was acceptable - 3 stars.  The bagguette version was great right out and didn't last to the next day.  The crusts were especially nice; I'm glad I used an end - 4 1/2 stars.

I really enjoyed this-I found the mango to be a little tart, so I will make sure mine are nice and ripe next time.  Also, I second another reviewer's advice to make sure the cardamom is well mixed.  I really enjoyed the flavor the first time, but the second time I forgot to give it a final mixing and we had a few bites that were a bit too strong!  Really a nice spin on one of our favorite desserts and the texture is perfect!    *Note-my husband wanted me to try it with apples (he's not a huge mango fan).  Don't even bother-I reduced the cardamom but it was still way too strong).

Amazing taste and texture! I don't think I'll use cardamom again next time but that's just a question of personal taste. I'll try with ginger or cinnamon. My bf gobbled it down and I don't think he had ever eaten something with cardamom before: that's a keeper in my books!

I had some Marzipan Stollen (from Christmas) in the freezer that needed to be used.  I dried the slices for 2 days and diced the bread up small.  I soaked the bread in the custard for about 30 minutes.  I thought it needed just a little sauce so I whipped together a coconut sauce:  1 cup coconut milk (light works just fine), 1 T. white sugar, or more to taste, 1 T. cornstarch, 1/8 - 1/4 tsp. coconut extract and 1/2 - 1 T. shredded unsweetened coconut.  Put 3/4 cup of coconut milk and sugar into a medium pot and heat until just simmering.  Mix the cornstarch into the remaining 1/4 cup coconut milk and whisk till smooth.  Add mixture to simmering milk and stir constantly until thickened.  Remove from the heat, add the coconut extract and coconut.  To serve I sliced the bread pudding and served the coconut sauce on the side.  I actually think the bread pudding tasted better on the second day, but maybe it was because I had it with the coconut sauce on the second day and plain on the first day.  At any rate, I liked this recipe.  For someone who likes their dessert not so sweet and delightfully fruity, you should try this recipe.

I made this for a family gathering, and everyone loved it!  Of course, my parents are Indian, so they like anything with mango and cardamom in it.  :-)  I really do suggest using cardamom and not substituting another spice.  The flavor meshes with fresh mango unlike anything else out there.  This recipe was also easy, which is always a plus when cooking for a crowd.

Fantastic! This was my first attempt at a bread pudding and it was delicious. I had some rock hard leftover french bread and a super ripe mango to use up so this was perfect. Plus, I was really excited to use the cardamom I recently bought from Penzeys :). I did only use one mango since that was all I had on hand and like other reviewers I used 9X9 baking dish. I also learned my lesson on pouring the egg mixture immediately after whisking, my cardamom had sunk to the bottom of the bowl.

I made this recipe as it was written except the amount of cardamom.  Since I only had cardamom seeds that I had to grind myself, I feared that it would be too strong, so I reduced it to 1 tsp.  It was the perfect amount.  I really love how the cardamom and mango tasted together.  And it was relatively easier than I expected bread pudding to be.  I will be making this again.

This was pretty good. I agree that it tastes better with icecream. It's a very different light flavor that I think someone who likes bread pudding better than I could appreciate more.

I had such high hopes for this recipe as I love mangoes and I love cardamom.  But I did not care for this.  Maybe if I'd used fresh french bread or something, but I used old hot dog buns (to use them up) and just maybe that was the problem.  What a waste of good mangoes, really.

So Easy! So Good!  I've never had cardamom before (knowingly anyway) and what a distinctive and GREAT aroma and flavor. Kids loved it.  Guests loved it.  A WINNER!

My bread pudding came out horribly!  I think the mangoes I used were too ripe and juicy because after the bread pudding came out of the oven, there was a layer of mango juice on the bottom!  I literally had to pour and scoop it out.  I also didn't use cardamom, but instead used cinnamon and ground ginger like another reviewer suggested, but it was still very bland.  It was quite embarrassing when I brought this dish to my church's annual Thanksgiving dinner and no one wanted it.  :(

Good recipe.  I was asked to bring dessert to a dinner featuring Indian food.  This worked nicely.  I used half cinnamon and half cardamon based on previous reviews.  In the future, I would go ahead and use all cardamon, but that is a matter of personal taste.

This had a smooth texture and a great taste. I turned it into a sugar free recipe by using Splenda in place of the sugar. I only had whole cardamoms and it took a while to husk them and then grind the spice in my blender/grinder. Other than that, it was quick and easy. I will make this again.

Loved it! Not too sweet! I also made a drizzle for it using 1/4 Cup Hazelnut coffee flavor syrup, 1/4 cup Half & Half, and 2 ablespoons of Cornstarch. Heat it in the microwave for 2 minutes. And drizzle over top when down baking! YUMMY!

WOW!  This was so different than the average dessert and with the cardamom it had a very unique flavor.  I upped the sugar to 1/2 cup and used a deep casserole dish but otherwise followed the recipe.  Next time I will use just 1 t. cardamom since, as others mentioned, it is a strong presence.

Made this twice in one week. Served with a vanilla sauce recipe I found after reading the reviews that it wasn't very sweet. I also used Hawaiian sweet bread and I did find the cardamom at my local Safeway. I served it to my family first and then made it again over the weekend for a party. Everyone LOVED it, said it was delicous, wonderful, etc, so I'm giving it 5 stars, even though I just thought it was "good". VERY easy to make and I would make it again.

I just made this pudding and unfortunately I did not like it as much as everyone else did. I thought it was too sweet and the consistency of the milk/egg mix was similar to that of an omelette. I even cooked it for much longer than the indicated time and at a higher temperature. I sprinkled some brown sugar on top hoping it would caramelize nicely but it just seeped through instead. Maybe I just don't like bread pudding!

Delicious.  I used a 9 x 13 inch baking dish and it came out great.  Just the right amount of cardamom in our opinion.  Next time I might try half mango, half some other fruit that would complement it like peaches.  We will definitely make this again.

Really good! Istead of white bread, I used cinnammon raison bread which made it really yummy. I dont know what the heck cardamom is so I used cinnammon. You can never have enough cinnammon. I baked it a little longer because it was very juicy. Grandma loved it cause she can't eat anything hard cause it will hurt her teeth.

I used Spenda and Spenda Brown Sugar blend to replace the white sugar. I just wanted to lower sugar a little bit. I also added raisins.  Very good.  I may add some kind of glaze or cream sauce next time

maybe the mangoes I added weren't the best, so it didn't turn out so great. also reduce the sugar to half, with the mentioned amount it gets very sweet.

Did not like this.  Way too much cardamom, not enough mango and too much milk.  Baked it for a little over an hour and there's still some liquidyness in the bottom.  Not terrible if the taste was good but 1.5 tsp cardamom takes over the whole flavor.  Maybe .25 tsp would have been better so you get a hint but its not overpowering.

8/29/2018:  To those who had cardamom issues, I always strain while pouring the mixture.  Hope it helps??  UPDATE:  4/12/2019  I made this over Christmas this year while camping here in southern California.  I had a can of peaches, sweet coconut shreds,  white shephards bread that had dried, some egg, evaporated milk (I use it as coffee creamer when camping) and vanilla.   Well, over the fire, we made this delicious peach-coconut bread pudding in an enamel-coated, cast iron pot over hot rocks! It was gorgeous! We couldn't believe how pretty it looked and it was a bummer our camping neighbors couldn't share it with us because there simply wasn't enough!

Not sweet at all but a good bread pudding. I used 1 pear and 1mango since it was what was in the house. I also added a teaspoon of crystallized ginger. Very good!

I'm a big fan of mangos so I was pretty excited by this. I used what was probably 2 cups worth of several days old french bread cut into about 1 inch pieces and followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. It was good but not great. I couldn't really taste the cardamom (I have to admit that what I used had probably been in my cupboard for a couple of years or more) but the mango was clearly present. This biggest problem was the bread part of the bread pudding- just not much happening there. I guess it needs that addition butter and sugar that most bread pudding recipes have to make the caramel that bring it all together- and that probably wouldn't work well with mango.
I'll stick with mango lassi for now & keep searching.

My husband and I enjoyed this quite a bit.  The texture of the mango compared to the rest of the bread pudding was a little off; I think it may be better to make the pudding without the mango, and serve the mango on the side as a garnish or on top.  It still tasted good, though.  We loved the addition of cardamom in this.  I made this a second time using some other fruit instead of mango (it may have been apple, but it's been a while so I don't remember for sure) and still enjoyed it, but again the contrasting texture was a little off.  I guess we just don't like anything in our bread pudding (neither of us really like the traditional raisins in bread pudding either.)  I will definitely make this again and just leave out the fruit if we don't feel like it.

I love bread, so i love bread pudding; but most of my family doesn't care for it too much. But my Grandmas Husband wanted me to make a dessert that had mangoes in it. So of course, i looked on [my fav. site for recipes] this website, and found this lovely recipe. I had just made bread pudding a couple days earlier from Paula Deens cookbook (which is the best thing i've ever tasted!) but i thought this would be something different and something to try. I dont care for mangoes that much, but it was good with the sweet and kind of tangy flvor from them, and i used fresh ones from the yard. And, boy did this just taste wonderful! I thought it came out just like bread pudding should, and the recipe was easy to follow. Very delicious! I served with some cool whip; you could also add an extra sliced mango on top for a garnish.  :) enjoy.

Very tasty. I used wheat bread and fat free milk. I halfed the recipe but kept both mangos in. I didn't have any vanilla, but it was still plenty sweet. I wasn't sure about the cardamom (didn't like it in the lentil soup) but it tastes great in this. I served it warm with fat free cool whip on top. The cool whip really gave it the extra push it needed!

Tasty recipe!  The first time I made it, I did not have cardamom and substituted cinnamon.  The result was very delicious.  BF requested it again, so the second time, I used cardamom as listed in the recipe but we both wish I hadn't.  The cardamom is strong, but that could just be personal taste.  Next time, I will use only cinnamon and maybe mix in a handful of raisins as well.

This is a light and flavourful dessert.  Recommended!

I made this for Christmas dinnner... it was very good! It was such a light and refreshing dessert, contrary from what I think of when i think of bread pudding! But nonetheless, the flavors were perfect together! The cardamon and mango go SO well! The only change i made was that instead of white bread, i used a combination of italian bread and Whole Foods "Seed-uction" bread... It was great! Crispy top and edges, and moist inside.... yummmm....
This dessert went perfectly with a Curried Monkfish dish that i made... an Indian theme!

This was really good.  Be sure to use ripe mangos.

I was looking for something to do with an overabundance of mangos, and when I found this I was excited, because I also had half a loaf of day-old homemade bread.  I scaled back on the sugar because the bread had molasses in it (Lisa's Sunflower Bread, also from this site; good combo, btw), and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  We found the cardamom to be a bit strong for our liking, though husband had whipped cream, and said that it toned the cardamom down some.  We will definitely be making this again, just with a little less cardamom.  I like the idea of low sugar, high fiber recipes like this, and when you find one that tastes good, you hang on to it!

This was excellent! I used day old french bread- made it nice and crisp on top. Can easily add more or less mango or bread to this recipe depending on your preference.

Thank you for sharing this absolutely delicious recipe! I mix the cardamon with the bread and mango to ensure an even distribution then sprinkle somemore on top before baking.  I have also used French and cinammon/raisin bread to rave reviews.

I thought this was awesome, and so did almost everyone else in my family.  It is very light, not a heavy load like most bread pudding.  We ate it hot, with some cool whip and it was wonderful!!

This dessert was excellent. I cut down on the milk the first time because I like my bread pudding on the dry side. I also baked it in a loaf pan and it turned out great. I loved the mango taste and made a simple vanilla sauce to go on top. This was so easy and tasty--it will be a regular dessert in my house.

Definitely a different, smooth bread pudding with a fresh, interesting flavor that is perhaps best suited for summer meals.  I used canned pureed mango as I didn't have fresh mangoes at home, and it turned out fine (you can get canned mango from an Asian grocery).  Topped it with toasted coarsely chopped almonds, since I like having that nutty crunch.  Served it warm with whipped topping.  Went over better with the adults than with the teenagers, so I'll probably only make this one if a gathering includes many adults with adventurous tastes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm going to make this again tomorrow, but will use more cardamon (I scaled this down to 2 servings, and we could barely taste the 1/2 tsp). I might also try it with raisins. With a little bit of tweaking, this would be absolutely awesome. Thanks!
