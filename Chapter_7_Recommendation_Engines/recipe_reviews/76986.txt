This recipe was all right.  The taste was really good, but the texture was kind of a turn off.  So I ended up throwing it all in the blender and pureeing it.  Consistency is much better.  I used fresh cilantro, as that is what I had around the house.  It was very refreshing, but I don't know if I'll make it again.

I added a couple of pears and pureed a portion of the red pepper,pineapple, and pears.  The appearance is very enticing.

This is about a 3.5 or so. Tasty. I also pureed all the ingredients as I despise chunky gazapachos. I strained it as well and then then added back about half of the pulp to the liquid portion. Very spicy at first. Chill for best results.

The texture was too chunky....so I also pureed all together.  I used half of a small vadalia onion and only tablespoon of basil.  Probably used a little more than 2 cups of pineapple (just the whole pineapple).  Very different from what I am used to eating, but it is good.  Not sure I'd make it again.
