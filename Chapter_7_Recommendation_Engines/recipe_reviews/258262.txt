Great recipe! I used bacon grease instead of lard. Baked for 24 minutes.

The puddings rose to amazing heights! We re very pretty coming out of the oven and looked great next to Chef John s Perfect Prime Rib. My husband raved over them. Frankly I don t get Yorkshire Pudding. But as long as they tasted right to our dinner guests - well I guess they are a win!
