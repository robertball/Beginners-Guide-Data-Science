This was a wonderful, tasty, surprise!  I did this on the grill (charcoal) with chicken legs and thighs.  Considering it had only marinated roughly 2-3 hours, it was delicious!  I used a bit of the marinade to baste during cooking. I'm glad it's early in the grilling season as I will surely get this in a couple more times before the cold weather returns.

A flavorful change of pace.  Works even better when using boneless pork.

This turned out to be very good.  The second time I made it I used part soy and part fish sauce.  Everyone loved it.

Sorry but there is nothing we found fabulous about this dish. I have never had to throw out a dish before so this will be the first. I'm sorry but there is no way to salvage this chicken.

I love this recipe.  It had wonderful flavours.  I wasn't able to use soy sauce but used Maggi instead and it turned out great.  I marinated it for a few hours making sure all the chicken was covered.  tasty bbq chicken!!

Wow!! Just prepare this chicken today with the "chinese five spice seasoning" that's been sitting in my pantry for sometime. Decided to try this today and it was on point. At first when I tried the sauce, I thought it might need a little more brown sugar, however, I followed the recipe without adding anything extra and was very surprise. I will add this to my go to list to prepare in the future. Great chicken and thanks for posting!!

This is a great marinade, I used it on wings. BUT....you have to like Chinese 5 spice. It's a different kind of spice, with cloves, cinnamon, anise, anise & ginger.
