These cookies are an excellent way to use up that box of Grapenuts.  Great browned butter flavor.  I liked to bake them until brown and crispy.

These oatmeal cookies were Awsome! The recipie was great and the fact that there was not to many oats was great as well. I did omit the Grape-Nut cereal just for the fact that I did not have any. These cookies are fabulous and a MUST-MAKE

If you have Grape Nuts to use up, then these cookies are a great choice!

Delicious crunchy and chewy!  Haven't been able to achieve this chewy texture with other recipes I've tried.  Used crunchy oat cereal instead of the Grape Nut that was suggested, I think this made it a bit too sweet, but it nonetheless went down very well with the family. Mother-in-law actually asked for the recipe.

A good crunchy, crispy and flavorful cookie.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and some raisins.  Freezes well if you can keep them long enough.

The grapenuts kind of give these cookies a undesirable texture (hard), but the flavor is so good that they are getting 5 stars anyway!

Just decided to make these since I had a box of Grape Nuts and oatmeal to use up.  So much tastier than I thought they would be...simple and delicious.  Next time I'm going to try making them bigger and leaving them softer to use in ice cream sandwiches.

Very good, my family likes cookies a little chewy so I increased the butter to 1 1/2cups.  I also add cinnamon and raisins,crasins,chocolate chips different things depending who I'm making them for.

This is a very good recipe, but I didn't quite like it well enough to give it 5 stars. Easy to make though and tasty.
