I am Brazilian and had done it so many times. But a bit different . No add water. I put two sheets of aluminum foil on the counter and spice the rib there. wraps up and seal well. Take to roast , turning every hour. Them take off  the aluminum foil and let it turn brown. Easy and delicious.

I was looking for a basic beef rib recipe, and came across this one. I already had the beef ribs and wasn't able to remove the white membrane, so I just left it on. I only have to cook them for about 5 hours though, which i'm blaming the altitude we live in.
 I followed the directions and the ribs came out perfect. The "Sea Salt" wasn't specified to being fine, medium, or coarse.  I only had fine sea salt, and the ribs were a tinge on the salty side. But I think next time I will go with Coarse.
Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! The ribs came out extremely tender & tasty

Incredibly good for being so easy to prepare.  Hubby has mentioned this dish several times since I made it and wants it to be a regular because of the versatility with the finished meat.  I used a boneless chuck style rib as that was what we had on hand and they were delicious.

I made a full pan so we were able to eat them several ways.  Plain out of the pan with au gratin potatoes and salad.  Leftover reheated brushed with barbeque sauce and mac-n-cheese on the side.  A third lunch meal of toasted sourdough bread sandwiches with the meat shredded topped with muenster cheese along with pan drippings/broth for dipping.  
 
Will keep using this low slow cooking method for tenderness and flavor!

WOW! So glad I tried this recipe. Already had beef ribs - good sale at the market, but didn't have a clue how to prepare.  This recipe was so easy. I followed one reviewers method by wrapping salted ribs in foil and baking 6 hours at 275° - turning every hour. We couldn't believe how tender and flavorful they were. Hubby says we'll definitely be making these again.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I could not believe how easy and delicious this dish was.  I followed one reviewer and baked the ribs without basting, turning them every hour and took the foil off for about 30 minutes.  No more messing with BBQ sauce of any kind.  With just the sea salt, you really taste the meat.  Thank you for a great recipe.

My husband loves beef ribs! I have never been able to get them fall off the bone tender. I tried this yesterday and I couldn't believe that they were sooo good. I did use Marcia's idea to just wrap them in foil, and turn them every hour or so. I cooked mine for 5 hours and I think next time I will cook them for a little less time. The bones lost all their meat when i picked them up.....but the meat was fantastic.

Use the handle end of a spoon to pry the membrane from the ribs.  Once you pry up enough to get a grip it will peel right off. its pretty tough and unless you cut it it comes off in one piece

I used short ribs. Seasoned them with steak seasoning consisting of coarse salt, spices,red and black peppers. Added a little kosher salt. No water. Covered tightly in foil. Put in 275 degree oven for 3hrs. The taste was incredible. I made gravy with the  essence. Served over rice. My family loved it. Next time will use beef ribs.

Perfect ribs!  Followed Marcia's suggestion and used coarse ground sea salt, garlic pepper and a bit of Maggi seasoning.  None better!

I didn't use water. They were good; however, they fell off the bone so you couldn't pick them up by the bone (I like to hold on to a bone:) Very easy to prepare.

I was looking for a good beef rib recipe. This one seemed too simple to be good but most of the time simple is better. My husband is from eastern North Carolina where they do not use the tomato based barbecue sauce and he doesn't like

no, i will never make this again.  i followed the recipe exactly b/c i was out of my comfort zone---which is why i chose to try it.  i love trying new things, from different parts of the world.  this was not great.  i went to our village butcher, he has unbelievable local organic produce, he loves his business.  i brought home perfect beef short ribs.  i wish i had simply gone with our usual bbq sauce.  okay it may be that we live in victoria bc, a very humid, cool climate not brazil, & perhaps the difference in temperature affects how we respond to SALT---but the whole process of salt & yes i used coarse himalayan  salt rocks, so it wasn't salt from a standard shaker, but even so the salt never disappears!  yes, it does take down the fat---the salt remains.  it's choking.  we do not add salt, we are not big salt eaters so, yes, we may be more sensitive than some---but this is outrageous amounts of salt.  granted the meat was falling off the bone, but any meat cooked @ a low temp for 6hrs will do that!!  the salt---omg!  a waste of really top drawer ribs.  i gave the 3*s for the recipe, & for the adventure of going somewhere new, trying something utterly different...but if you are mulling should i shouldn't i---my advice is no!  stick with your usual tried & true bbq sauce or slow bake oven sauce.  you'll be glad you did.  my dh was very good, ate it, smiled, no mention of how much i'd spent or how long i'd futzed...simply said, 'not a repeat'.

Very tasty and tender. Make sure though the ribs are of even size. Unfortunately, my local store was out of ribs except for One pre-wrapped package. They weren't even in size. My next time I will be making them in foil as the "tip" suggested next time. So simple.

This is for sure going to be something I make again.  I did the foil no water method mentioned in the reviews.  I wish I took a picture before they got inhaled.  YUM!
