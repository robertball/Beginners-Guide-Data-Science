Very pretty appetizer. I serve this in larger squares as a summer meal. Very refreshing. I sometimes drizzle a little Italian dressing over it to soak into the bread base.

This was a big hit at my daughters christening party.  Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers!  It was also really easy to make and great for making ahead of time, since we were unable to do a lot of last minute prep due to the party being immediately after the christening.

This is one of my favorite summer recipes to make. I like to use reduced fat crescent roll dough and reduced fat cream cheese. This is really good with just about any vegetables you want to use on this pizza--we've tried just about every combination. Sometimes, I'll add a half cup or so of shredded cheese sprinkled on top.

I make this for every function that I have to bring a snack. They're pretty easy to make and are beautiful. I usually cut them up a bit smaller for more of a bite-sized appetizer.
