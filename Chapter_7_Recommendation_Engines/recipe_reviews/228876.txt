I used Boar's Head Ovengold turkey sliced fresh at the deli today, Trader Joe's sundried tomatoes, crusty Boule bread (the ciabatta didn't look great at the bakery), but there just wasn't much flavor to this sandwich.  Maybe swiss instead of provolone, I don't know??  Sorry, this was a disappointment, and it's doubtful that I'll try this again.
