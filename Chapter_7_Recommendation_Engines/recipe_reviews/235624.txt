11-05-2015 ~How can you not like this!?  Well, Hubs didn’t think much of it.  But what’s not to like, I asked him, because I thought in addition to serving its purpose as a respectable side dish to the chicken enchiladas I served it with, it was pretty tasty, nicely flavored.   I mean it had peppers and onions and a little tomato (and a dab of butter, just because).  Since I used chicken broth and not the unusual variety the recipe called for (I’ve never seen it), I added some Penzey’s taco seasoning and some garlic powder to compensate.  I’d rate it a decent four stars, but I had to know what it was he didn’t like. So I pressed the issue. The beans, he said.  Oh my. The beans. The rice, which he said was okay but then gave himself away by leaving half of it on his plate, was a fail…because of the beans.  Unbelievable.  Well, he’s wrong.

My local store didn't have the tortilla flavored broth so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes with chili's and 2 cups of vegie broth.  Turned out just fine. Will definitely make again. Good vegetarian dish.

Excellent !!!   Followed recipe, except did not have tomato paste.  Substitute small can diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Also used chicken stock in lieu of water. Yum

I used a rice cooker and mexican sauce.   It was ok, pretty spicy for me but my husband loved it.  Lots of prep x.  Certainly more than 2o min. more like an hour.  Happy Cooking.

Looked for non-spicy, non-acidic recipe for my family after struggling through a stomach bug that would also use up some green peppers and onions I had already in the fridge chopped up. I added cooked chicken breast to it to make it a main dish. I probably would have spiced it up a bit more if our stomachs could have handled that, but it was very good. Probably better as the original recipe of it being a side to a different main Mexican dish.
