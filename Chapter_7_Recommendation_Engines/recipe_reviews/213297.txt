My family loves this dish. I discovered this recipe on a can of Campbell's Cream of Chicken soup years ago, and it is a menu staple at our house. I usually substitute Stove Top stuffing, and I add more milk (not quite double) to have ample gravy. I would recommend doubling the recipe (maybe not 12 pieces of chicken!) if you want any leftovers!

I altered this a little.  I sprayed the pan with pam and put uncooked chicken tendars in first.  I mixed one can of cream of chicken with 1/3 cup of sour cream, a couple tablespoons of milk, a little parsley and black pepper, and poured over the chicken.  I topped it with the prepared stuffing mix and baked at 375 for 20 mins. covered and another 10 uncovered.  It was delicious!

This is such an old classic and great way to use up leftover stuffing!  You just can't go wrong with it.  Easy and tasty.  You may need to cook longer depending on the thickness of your chicken breasts. I always cut mine in half to make for nicer serving sizes.  Had to cook about 45-50 minutes total.

Very easy!  My 12 year old girls (one of which is fairly picky) loved it and said I should make it again the following night.  My fiance was a little unsure when I told him about it, but when he tasted it he loved it too.  There wasn't a crumb left!

I have made this recipe many times and it is very good. I do add more paprika, other than that follow the recipe as written.

Easy comfort food that my whole family enjoys! I cheated by using Stove Top but other than that, I followed the recipe to a T. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this last night with two minor changes: I used Campbell's Cream of Onion soup instead of Cream of Chicken - (I sub this in all the time for cream of mushroom/celery/chicken - not carried in all markets but I find it at Target and Walmart). I increased the milk from 1/3 cup up to 2/3 cup to make more sauce. I think you could easily go up to a cup. I cut the chicken breasts into "tenders" to ensure everything would be cooked fully in the time allotted. I only wish I'd have thought to season the chicken with salt and pepper beforehand but it was no big deal to season it after it was served. This was a delicious meal - my husband loved it! - I served it with mashed potatoes and roasted carrots. Great for a hearty Winter meal. We'll be eating the leftovers tonight!

Was surprised that I really liked this. I'm not much on canned soups and a lot of processed foods. Turns out that this was pretty tasty. Made real Mashed potatoes with gravy out of homemade chicken stock, corn and plopped out a can of Cranberry Jelly .. called it "Faux Thanksgiving".

I added 1 can of mushrooms, drained to the stuffing because I didn't have any celery at home.  It turned out fantastic!

Excellent recipe!  I'm making it right now.  I'm so excited to taste because I haven't made it all summer and then some, since it's baked.
