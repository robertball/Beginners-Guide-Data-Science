This was really good, but don't smother the salmon in the sauce like I did.  It was a little overbearing with so much!  And you could honestly use dried dill weed, instead of fresh, and be just fine!  Fresh dill is kind of awkward to cut, and if you leave too big of chunks in your sauce, it doesn't have the best feeling in your mouth (kind of scratchy).  But I made this for my boyfriend, and his sister, and they thought I was a magical chef.  Definitely try it out!  I also added some lemon pepper to the salmon while it cooked, and a little to the sauce as well.  I think it was a nice touch for the salmon

I also had to alter the recipe. I seasoned the salmon prior to cooking it, I peeled the cucumbers and I added some garlic to the cream sauce also. It tasted great.

This recipe was a good starting off point. Akari Hoshi said they needed to doctor the sauce, and I completely understand why. It was... flat. I made it according to the directions, tasted it, and added some garlic, salt, and pepper. I used dried dill weed by the way, and the dill flavor was fine. I got the sauce to taste pretty good, but when you add the salmon to the dish, it still fell flat. It wasn't bad by any means, but it still needed that "zoom-bang" factor to it. I will try adding a bit more garlic and some lemon as per other reviews next time possibly. This is not a recipe to toss out, rather than to build upon to make great.

This was very tasty! I will definitely make again, and again, and...... You get the picture. I did like one reviewer stated and not over do the sauce. I even put fresh dill on the rice.

I squeezed 3 fresh lemons over the salmon(1.5 lbs) 1 hour before cooking. Then I sprinkled season pepper on the salmon before cooking. The lemon flavor came through along with the pepper to make the sauce more tangy and flavorful. It was easy to prepare and all parties enjoyed it. I thought using different types of pickle relish rather than cucumbers would be interesting to try. Fresh dill seems to be better than dill weed dried.

Akari Hoshi, please tell us what you used to doctor the sauce. I added a little bottled garlic, maybe 1/2 a tsp.

I'm temporarily without a stove, so I microwaved the salmon according to the package directions.  Microwaved the sauce in a separate container (stirred it frequently).  Added garlic and the salmon juices to the sauce as I cooked it.  Added the dill, but was out of cucumber.  The sauce was smooth, creamy and delicious!  I have recommended it to a gluten intolerant friend.  I will make this dish again, either on the stove or in the microwave.
