These cookies are sooo awesome! They really do "meltaway" in you mouth! My mom loved them and so did my husband and sister( everyone who tasted them basically!)Very easy to make, and so cute and dainty small cookies. I was surprised of the reaction of my mom especially, because lately, she has gotten so used to my baked goods, that she has become more critical, and hard to please, so I am pleased to see that she really loved them! 
I only refrigerated them an hour, and they came out perfect!Thank you so much for sharing your recipe Mary!

I make this recipe quite often since my boyfriend is in love with the cookies. I've never had any problems at all, however, when they say no substitutes for butter they mean it. One time I only had margarine in the fridge and I figured how bad can it be? The cookies took forever to harden I had to put them in the freezer and the icing was oily and thin. Cookies = amazing with butter, but not so good with margarine. It's worth the trip to the grocery store for the butter for this recipe.

I took these to work and they were a big hit.They do melt in your mouth. I added a drop of lemon extract to the cookie dough.

Fabulous!!! I make these little meltaways every chance that I get. They have a very light taste to them with just enough lemon. They are such a crowd pleaser!

Very delicate and delicious! I have made these for work events, holiday parties and gifts and people always ask for the recipe. Chilling the dough over night definitely helps.

I agree with other reviewers who say these were inedible. At first you taste lemon and it is good, then they do melt away in your mouth, but not in a good way. It leaves a chalky corn starch taste in your mouth. I followed the recipe exactly and I do not care for them at all.

After reading the reviews I was a little worried about making these. They were either incredibly delicious or inedible. Well I ended up trying them out. The texture isn't great they are too crunchy and starchy not moist at all, and definately dont melt-away. The taste was way too buttery, I'm glad I decided to add extra lemon to the dough- if I didnt I'm not sure this cookie would have been palatable. Although I did not find anything wrong with the frosting, it was quick, easy, and delicious.

I loved these.  I upped the servings to 40 to use 1 cup of butter.  They were easy and fun to make, and they really do melt in your mouth.

Ok, this has got to be my worst experience making something from Allrecipes ever! I don't think I have ever had a recipe from this website turn out to be inedible, but this one definitely was! The cookies were so crumbly you could barely get them off the sheet, and they tasted like cornstarch with a bit of lemon juice thrown in. Absolutely horrible-- if I could give them 0 stars I would!! Threw the entire batch in the trash, which was frustrating since they used so much butter which isn't cheap!

Very delicate cookies!  I made my cookies a bit smaller, and we just couldn't stop eating them!  We really love the frosting.  I personally would like more lemon flavor, but I will be baking these cookies again really soon...

Awesome cookies, lemon is subtle, and they definitely do melt in your mouth.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe.

These cookies are very good and very addictive. I actually found this recipe a long time ago on another website. I am not a baker and not a very good one  but these are really easy to make.

Worst cookie ever. I'd give it a zero if I could. Completly inedible, in fact I choked a little on all that cornstarch. Please save yourself some money and time and do not try this recipe.

I am not usually one to leave a bad review, but these cookies tasted very strongly of cornstarch. So much so, in fact, that I checked the recipe to be sure I hadn't goofed up and put 1/2 a cup when it called for considerably less. Unfortunately, I found I did not goof up. I followed the directions to the letter, with no success. I am really wondering if there is a way to fix that? The frosting isn't bad. A little sugary, but I added a tiny bit more lemon juice, and a small amount more zest and that helped.

Very nice cookie :) They dissapeared from the table in minutes! I added some extra lemon zest to both the cookie and the icing with great results.

I thought these were pretty good, but not lemony as I had hoped.  I didn't have any problems with crumbly texture.  If you eat just the cookie w/o the frosting they do taste like the cornstarch, but with the frosting I didn't notice it.

These are heavenly!  I used sweet potato flour instead of cornstarch and lemon extract instead of lemon zest (personal preference) and it was so good.  Definitely melts away in your mouth.  Let me warn you: Do not make these when no one else is in the house-- you may end up eating them all yourself!

I have made this recipe twice for work events and the results have been spectacular.  They go so fast and everyone marvels at how light they are.  One co-worker called them little rays of sunshine. I refrigerate the dough overnight and I think it is easier to cut.

These are delicious and were a huge hit with my family, for the most part.  Those who didn't like them as much just don't care for a "biscuit-like cookie".  I did add a little more lemon juice to the cookie.  Baked for 10 minutes and they were perfect.  The frosting is also amazing!  I almost added milk, but thankfully tasted it first.  It doesn't need any modification.

I was a little worried when I first made these.  I tried some of the dough before baked and it was not palatable.  I baked it and it was still not all that good but when I put the icing on it thats what made it.  I ended up being really pleased with this recipe.  I did however end up making 2x the icing recipe.

Very yummy. And buttery. I usually skimp on butter, but my boyfriend made these and so followed the recipe as it was written. The butter does give them a melt away feeling. The lemon frosting is yummy. I thought that it looked like too much when it was in the bowl, but after icing the cookies, they turned out perfect when tasted. Didn't use food coloring in the frosting.
