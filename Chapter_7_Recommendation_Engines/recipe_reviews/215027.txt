This recipe is SOOOooo good!! Wow! Okay, I did make some changes... I used one gallon sized tea bag (I felt that three was a *little* excessive!), I also didn't boil the whole gallon of water (just a little and filled the pitcher up the rest of the way with cold) I also didn't have any lemonade powder, so I used the frozen stuff. Thanks so much for the recipe! I'll make it again for sure! :)

This recipe was pretty good, lots of people enjoyed it. I found that I needed to leave the tea bags in way longer, or else it doesn't taste like tea at all. We left them in overnight, and we used all three of them. We also added a little bit more sugar, it was quite tart. The raspberry flavour was really really good. Next time, we are going to try it with real lemons instead of powdered lemonade, I think it might improve the taste a little bit. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing

This was good, but the next time I make it I will only steep my tea bags for 3 minutes rather than five. I found that after 5 minutes, the resulting tea was a little bitter for my taste.  I used Splenda and Crystal Light lemonade powder to make this sugar-free for my diabetic hubby.

I made so many changes, that I'm not even sure it's the same recipe! 
Anyway, these changes where made for 7 servings (so I can make 2 liters, metric system)
7 regular tea bags, 1/2 cup of frozen raspberries (a few blueberries also found their way inside), 4 teaspoons honey (I hate overly sweet taste, and always order my ice tea unsweetened...) and no lemonade mix, just about a teaspoon of lemon juice. I brought the water to boil, cooked the everything together for 3 min (the raspberries were defrosted prior) and then let it sit for another 4. YUM YUM YUM!!!

This was the recipe group selection for this week. A very refreshing for a summer night. I noticed our raspberry package was only 6oz. so we didn't quite have a cup. We used two of the gallon sized bags and the juice of three real lemons since we don't drink the powdered stuff. We also tried it with a shot of vodka...think we found us a new summertime beverage.

I used two gallon size tea bags, and the juice from 3 fresh lemons instead of the powered lemonade mix.  Since I had extra fresh raspberries, I froze a few of  them inside the ice cubes.  Also froze some fresh lemon pieces inside some ice cubes.  I think it added to the presentation.  Definitely found a new, refreshing summertime drink.  Thanks so much for sharing.   Made  for this week's  Recipe Group.

Instead of making the tea as the recipe stated, I made Sun Tea (ten tea bags, full gallon sun tea pitcher). Near the end of the afternoon, I then added the raspberries (I used equal amounts frozen UNSWEETENED raspberries as fresh raspberries aren't quite in season yet), sugar and instant tea mix. This is one of the best ice tea recipes I have made in a long time. We all LOVED it. Great twist on sun/iced tea. This recipe's a keeper.

QUICK AND EASY!   A new favorite way to make iced tea.  Last summer I froze some wild raspberries, so when I saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it.   I am so glad I did.  Both Hubby and I give it 5 stars!

If you let the water cool from a boil before you add the tea bags it will help with the bitter taste one reader posted!
YUMMY! If you notice a lot of seeds when you pour you can also put cheese cloth over pitcher to strain them as you pour. My kids don't like the seeds.
