This was really good!!!  I mad a few changes though.  Instead of the Soy Sauce, I used 1/2 cup of Yoshida's Original and then didn't have to use the corn starch, it's already thicker.  Let it marinade for about an hour, and used mixed oriental veggies.  My husband and I love spicy but the kids like it just "tasty", this was good!  We added more chili peppers and it was great for us!  (Of course we also added more garlic, love that too!)  We had it over rice, good quick meal!

Easy and good, though not quite spicy enough for my taste.  I increased the red pepper and garlic, and added grated fresh ginger.  Instead of using vegetable oil, try using sesame oil instead. My family really liked this dish and requested I make it again.

Very nice recipe.  If you wish for sauce to be thicker, Add one full cup of broth to mix, drain off and add corn starch to thicken.  Re introduce to sauce pan before serving.

I read the reviews and added extra flavor (more soy, garlic, hot pepper flakes), and the taste was still just average.  Yes, it's a quick dish to prepare, but I'll stick with Sesame Beef or Awesome Korean Steak when I'm craving beef stir-fry.

I didn't have the water chestnuts, peanuts or broccoli, so I just used some carrots. I used beef base since I didn't have chicken base. Even without many of the ingredients, this was still very good. It wasn't that spicy and I even used some crushed dried Thai peppers (which are extremely hot) from our garden. After cooking the meat and tasting it (before adding the veggies) I added more dried peppers. That gave it some kick. I'd like to try it sometime with all the correct ingredients.

my family loved this and it was a fast, easy meal. I bought the meat already in strips and substituted mushrooms for the water chestnuts.  I also put another 1/4 c. of chicken broth in.  But the flavor of the sauce was great.

Love this recipe!  It is one of the best beef stir-fry recipes I have come across!  Of course I add my own medley of veggies and add extra hot pepper and a bit of sesame oil.

There is nothing Szechuan about this beef. This was more like very bland broccoli beef. 1 TBS of soy to marinade 1 lb. of beef!? REALLY?? After following recipe, i ended up having to add alot more soy and a bit of brown sugar to make it to my liking. This is one of my lowest ratings yet. Sorry but just way to bland if made as written.

It needs chili paste, peppercorns, and some hot, habanero peppers and a lot of scallions. The majority found this too bland and I have to agree.

mmmmm this was really really good, i followed the recipe exactly except i used red pepper flakes as i didnt have any crushed red pepper on hand and i did 1/2 tsp of that instead of 1/4, used only one onion and cashews instead of peanuts.  next time i will up the pepper to 3/4 tsp and see if that spices it up a lil bit more.. had a little kick to it but not much.  but was definitely very flavorful and really good.  i served it over steamed rice.  will be making this again for sure

I read through the reviews and noticed most people left negative ones, which is usually when I look for the next recipe. For some reason I tried this one anyway, following a little bit of the advice given. I added a little extra red peppers,soy, garlic powder rather than cloves (all out), added cayenne and some Chinese five spice powder. Stir fried the beef in sesame oil, then aaded one small onion and the broccoli and green bell pepper. Turned out amazing. Kind of mellow flavor when you first take a bite, but by the time you swallow you can taste the spice and the subtle heat. The veggies were delicious, and my kids asked that I add this to rotation.

This wasnt bad but not great. It could be better with a few changes. The only thing I changed this time was I subbed baby corn for the water chesnuts b/c we dont like them. Next time I may add a sliced green pepper and some extra soy sauce.

This was my first chance to use the new quality wok I got for my birthday. I marinated the beef overnight to make it real tender,did not use peanuts, but added snow peas, extra broccoli,baby corn and carrots. Family likes everything spicy so I added some hot sauce and a little garlic. Once more I recieved praise for an "allrecipe" dish.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I doubled the sauce like others recommended.  The only thing I did differently was marinate the meat for several hours with extra garlic.  I thought it was very tasty, and I don't know what the other people were thinking when they said it was blah tasting!!  Definate do over several times!!!!

This recipe is too blah! Increase the soy sauce and red peppers improved the taste.  I won't be making it again.

It gave me a good start for experimentation.  I used just a touch over 1 lb of meat and in the quantities above, it here wasn't enough to cover it all.  I also removed the meat, broccoli, etc and thickened the juice with more corn starch.  Served with fried rice.  Hubby liked it.

This is a great starter recipe! I did use more soy sauce, garlic, cornstarch, and chicken broth. I used peanut oil & sesame  oil to stirfry the beef with ground ginger sprinkled on the beef and veggies. It was fantastic, but I did add my own touch of seasonings as well. The kids demolished it, so it's a keeper!! :)

This was so easy to prepare and delicious.  I wish it were spicier but I guess it was fine since my kids ate it and asked for seconds!  Oh, and I also added thinly sliced carrots for color.

We just got done with dinner and I was SO unhappy I have to write this review.
  I followed the recipe, but added probably 1 tsp of hot pepper, based on other reviewers.
  I was so looking forward to a zippy tasty dinner, this wasn't it.
 It was very unfavorable.  It wasn't spicy at all.

  Too bad...

I didn't follow the recipe exactly because everyone said it was a little bland.  I increased the crushed red pepper and garlic by one 1 teaspoon and 2 cloves.  I had issues with the beef strips not getting cooked in the alotted time.  For some reason, that just didn't work for me even though I marinated it for 3 hours instead of the recommended 20 min.

It seemed to be missing something. I did add a dash of ground ginger to the beef while it was marinading and I had to add more hot pepper and soy. Sorry but I will probably not make this again.

I made this for the family, they all loved it andhave requested it again. I was suprised how easy it was to make a very authentic dish. The marinade really gets into the meat. I used Sirloin steak, approx. 4oz per person so it makes an very economical, great quality meal for 4 from 2 Sirloins. Thank you.

My family thought this was very good. The only changes I made were to add some shredded cabbage, some tamari, and a little sugar and I did add more red pepper than called for. I find most stir fry recipes too bland. Thanks Christine for finally giving me an easy and tasty stir fry recipe!

I marinated the beef for 6 hours, added extra red pepper and left out the peanuts because of allergies in my daughter.  Pretty good recipe, quick and easy.

Not spicy at all and little flavor, I suggest doubling the seasoning.  The beef was overcooked when cooked this way.  I recommend cooking the beef, putting it aside, cook the broccoli and onion, then add the beef back in.

I doubled up the chicken stock (which probably would've been better with beef) and added a lot extra soy sauce (used coconut aminos) it still needed maybe teriyaki sauce or oyster sauce or something.  Not my fave.

This is my new favorite recipe! I did make some changes, though. Some of the changes were to lower the carb count and some  were to add extra flavor based on previous reviews. I used 1/4 cup soy sauce, 3 tsp minced garlic, 6 green onions in place of regular onions and 1 tsp crushed red pepper. I also added some onion powder and garlic powder (I just sprinkled them on). I used xanthan gum to thicken in place of the corn starch and added it at the end instead of the beginning. I didn't use the water chestnuts or the peanuts. Next time I make it I will also add bean sprouts.

Made this recipe with only the ingredients I had in the house... So no broccoli and instead of water chestnuts I added walnuts.  This was delicious! I served over rice.

I used ground beef instead of sirloin steak.  It was good, but a little flavorless.  Maybe more soy sauce?

Tried this one last night, and it was the first recipe that I didn't fall in love with the first time out. It really felt like it was missing something, although I have not yet decided what. And it wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be - although that may just be because I am a native New Mexican and used to spicy food. I am gonna rate this a 3-Star (just for now) until I can figure out what it needs to improve it. However, it wasn't a total bust because I think it has a great foundation to be something wonderful!

I followed this exactly and after cooking the beef in the wok I tasted it. I thought it was too bland! So I added some chinese marinade that a friend had given us from china and it made it tasty. This recipe alone deserves 2 stars for it's lack of flavor. I highly recommend adding more to the meat/dish before serving.

I really hate giving bad reviews because someone out there thought it is a wonderful recipe and wanted to share it with the world. But this recipe is very very bland. I ended up adding bottled stir fry sauce to try and save it. Thanx for the recipe but I guess this dish just isn't for me.

I loved this, husband just said "good".  I think it's restaurant quality.  The only think I'd change is to add a little cornstarch at the time you add the broth, to thicken is slightly. Love it.

Delicious! I doubled the garlic and added two chopped stalks of celery. Yummy and easy weeknight dinner. Also marinated the beef for about 4 hours.

I only gave this three stars for now as I thought it was quite bland and not very 'szechuan-like'. I didn't find it even remotely spicy but I will try this again and see if maybe I can get better luck the second time around. It wasn't bad or anything, just bland.

Good but a little bland.  Needs a lot of spices and some additional vegetables (cabage, carrots, etc) to match restaurant-style Szechuan.  A good start though.

I like this a lot, and it was a hit with the whole family. I omitted the red pepper for the kids and then added sriracha to mine at the end, and used cashews rather than peanuts because they were all I had on hand. I will definitely make this again!

Bland -  you need to add more spice.  If you can find szechuan sauce - it would probably taste better.

I'd recommend using chuck steak instead of sirloin. It tastes the same and it's a cheaper cut.

Used 3 tablespoons of soy sauce for marinade. Doubled the red pepper flakes as we like spice. Substituted sesame oil in place of vegetable oil. Used bag of frozen oriental veggies. Served over rice. This dish was delicious and was even better the second night.

Left out the water chestnuts (don't really like them) and added a lot more crushed red pepper for a bit more zest.

This is good, not fabulous. So many reviewers mentioned blandness, so I was heavy handed with the pepper flakes, which was good. I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. My husband had seconds, so it certainly was not a bad dish.

Sauce Not very spicy. Will double the garlic and red pepper flakes. Sesame oil works. Worth repeating since it is simple.

There was not enough sauce - so I had to adjust it to make it work. It all had to be bumped up quite a bit. Re-think this recipe when you make it, otherwise it will be too dry.

Sorry but I couldn't give it a good review. There was absolutely no sauce, it didn't look anything like the picture, not colourful and saucy. I added ginger and brown sugar because the taste was pretty bland.

I made minor changes to this recipe: I boiled the broccoli first and then added it to the wok after the beef was cooked (that way, the broccoli was soft).  I cooked this for my family and they loved it!

It's not spicy. The measurements are not accurate and it was very bland,  so given what the recipe calls for, I cannot give this a good rating. I might try it again using different ingredients, but then it wouldn't be this recipe at that point.

I tried this twice and got it right on the second try! My kids love this.  The only thing I did differently was not include the peanuts because our allergies.  I also seasoned the beef with Chicago Style Steak seasoning.  I also increased the amount of each ingredient due to my son's appetite. He always wants seconds! They asked me to prepare this again tonight!  I think they're getting spoiled! LOL!!

Double the sauce! Otherwise, very plain.
Consider splitting into two pans, otherwise doesn't cook evenly, because it makes a lot.

This is chinese delicious! I used a bag of walmart brand broccoli stir-fry veggies which has broccoli, califlower, water chestnuts, mushrooms, sugar snap peas, corn, etc. I didn't have any onions, so I added onion powder. I also added some sesame oil for a more distinct flavor. A dash of franks red hot, and viola! The perfect meal. Served it over white rice and dinner was a hit.

This was ok. I thought it was kind of bland. I will add more red pepper flakes next time. I omited the peanuts and added some toasted sesame seeds instead.

The best thing about Chinese food - you can add whatever vegetables you like.  I used broccoli, cauliflower, green pepper, onions and sliced almonds.  I also double the sauce.  Very yummy!

Very good, but definitely needs more seasoning.  I doubled the sauce and added caribbean hot sauce (homemade) to kick up the spice.  The sirloin worked fine, but I plan to use a softer beef such as a roast next time.

Blah is the word. I wish I'd of read the others who said so as I would of spiced it up while cooking. The color of the meat is unappetizing.

This recipe is ok for a quick dinner. I think it needs a little more flavor and sauce for my families taste.

Not too spicey, in fact a good moderate level of "spiceiness".It seemed bland and lacked flavor. It wasn't bad,just okay. Next time I would try to "punch" up the flavor. It also needed more sauce.

I thought this was a little bland and it didn't have that Szechuan look or taste that you get from a restaurant. On the positive side, it was a good, quick dish and I'll probably make it again, with more seasonings.

my family enjoyed this dish, but i didn't think it was nearly spicy enough, and didn't have the color that it'd expect from szechuan beef.

I used frozen veggies in this recipe, because brocolli is out of season and very pricey, but my family loved it.
