I loved this.  The only changes i made was omit the celery and onion, as I'm not a fan, but everything else was great.  My boyfriend liked it, but not loved it as he isn't a big seafood fan, and suggested next time for me just to put in the squid and no other seafood.  I plan to make this a regular meal for me whenever my boyfriend is away.

Just made the polenta according to the recipe. Was quite nice.
Tried with veggies also. Nice and even better with crisped up polenta.
