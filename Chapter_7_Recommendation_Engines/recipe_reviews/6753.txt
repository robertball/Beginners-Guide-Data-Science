These muffins were wonderful!  They took NO extra time to bake because while the oatmeal was soaking I went ahead and measured all the other ingredients out, turned on the oven, and put liners in the muffin cups.  They were absolutely wonderful and yummy.  I will use this recipe many more times.  Everyone LOVES them!  Very moist and delicious!  I freeze them and keep them around! Usually I double the recipe, cut the oil in half, and use half whole wheat flour and half white flour, which really adds some flavor to the muffins.

These were very yummy! I omitted the nuts and added more chocolate chips. Warming them up to melt the chocolate chips makes it even better the next day. Mini-chocolate chips might have worked better.It also feels good to have the good-for-you oatmeal in there. Next time, I would use apple sauce instead of oil to make it healthier.

**** also added 1tsp vanilla!!! **** i think that helped a lot.

Hubby's staff has gotten quite spoiled by all the baked treats I send him to the office with on a regular basis. Tomorrow's treat was to be these muffins. I omitted the nuts (known nut allergy in the group) and substituted some butterscotch chips along with mini chocolate chips. I found these difficult to get out of the tins, as the topping wanted to adhere itself and then broke apart in places as I tried to release them. As for taste, if it wasn't for the chocolate and butterscotch chips there wouldn't be much flavor at all (maybe I should have added vanilla) and what flavor there was seemed to have an almost starchy/acrid taste (maybe too much baking powder and salt?). There was no way I would send these with hubs--if I'm not proud of what I make or want to eat it myself it's not good enough for anyone else. I hate to waste food or my time, but knowing hubs and I wouldn't eat them either, they went into the garbage.

I'm giving this 4 stars because of the changes I made.  I always try to make the recipe as written, but after reading the reviews I did make the following changes.  I used old fashioned oats.  I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  I added 1 t vanilla.  I used 1/2 cup ap flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup flaxseed.  I used 3 1/2 t baking powder and 3/4 t salt.  I used miniature chocolate chips.  They turned out soooo good.  They were very moist and I think the topping made the muffin even better.  My 3 year old yummed it right up.  Thanks for a great starter recipe.

i made these according to the directions, and soaked the oatmeal first, but the muffins still turned out very dry.  they had a good taste, but too dry a texture.  if i made again i would definitely use mini chocolate chips instead of regular size ones.

These muffins were really good!  I made some substitutions, because of food allergies:  I used white spelt flour, rice milk, and left out the pecans.  They were very moist, and easy to make.  The kids loved them!

These turned out great, even though I had no chocolate chips to add.  I added about 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  Love the topping too!

Super easy, and super fast, these yummy muffins are a treat.  I don't think that waiting 15 minutes makes it an 'extra effort' recipe at all. Gives me time to make my tea and sip it.

Great moist muffin base recipe.  I cannot have dairy so I was looking for an oil based muffin.  This was moist but not overly greasy.  I used unsweetened soymilk instead of milk, and increased the chocolate chips to 1 cup (dairy free Chocolate Dream brand).  I also substituted whole wheat pastry flour for all purpose flour.  Omitted pecans due to nut allergies. Came out excellent.  Do not overmix these muffins, so they stay light and moist.  Great idea to mix in chocolate chips to the wet ingredients to minimize dry to wet mixing at the end.  My three year old daughter, husband and parents wiped these out in 2 days time!

Great recipe! I added 2 T of flaxseed and 4 T of wheat germ to add some extra heartiness. I didn't have pecans but I had some ground up walnuts so I added those into the mix. (My kids don't like to bite into a whole nut but they don't mind the flavor so I grind them in a coffee grinder.) I didn't quite do the full oil and I used canola instead of vegetable. I didn't have any semi-sweet choco chips so I used one Hershey's milk chocolate bar and that was the perfect amount of sweetness. I didn't make the topping and I used old fashioned oats and they worked just great. These were great... thanks for sharing! I know I changed a lot and I hate reviewing a recipe when I change so much but I just wanted others to see what substitutions work, I hope you don't mind! :-)

These muffins were really delicious, but I'm only giving four stars because I did change the original recipe, based on other reviews.  I decreased the oil to 1/4 cup (next time I want to try applesauce), decreased the baking powder to 2 tsp, and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon (next time maybe 1 tsp), and 1 mashed banana. Also, no nuts and I put all the brown sugar in the batter, although I could have saved some for the top mixed with chocolate chips (I used mini chips).  Delicious!  Even my 7- and 3-year-old ate them! Thanks for a keeper recipe!

These muffins were very good.  I found them to be very moist and not overly sweet.  They were a bit crumbly but then most muffins are.  The only thing I did different was to omit the sugar and pecans on top.  I don't generally like muffins or cupcakes with loose things on top as it usually just makes a mess when you try to eat it.  Also I found that some of the muffins - the ones closer to the end of the batch - had more chocolate chips because they all sank to the bottom.  So one tip I would recommend is to keep stirring the batter while you're spooning or pouring it into the cups.  I also used liners in my muffin pan and sprayed them with cooking spray and they didn't stick at all.

Yummy.....this is a healthy, yet sweet snack! I've made these several times and they're always a hit in our household.  I cut the oil back to 1/4 cup and bake at 350 degrees instead of 400.  I have varied the recipe by adding 1 mashed banana, omitting the topping, and using walnuts rather than pecans.

Great muffins!  I was able to cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup packed (1/4 cup in batter and 1/4 cup on top), and it was sweet enough for my entire family.  The topping really adds such a great texture and flavor to the muffins, that I wouldn't ever think of omitting that step.  I've made this with regular chocolate chips and with mini chocolate chunks, both with excellent results.  It comes out moist and delicious everytime.  I think the person who complained that it was dry simply overcooked it or neglected to soak the oatmeal first.  I usually make extra and freeze the leftover muffins, which can be a quick snack or breakfast with just 45-60 seconds in the microwave!

I made these as written, but I did add some cinnamon (about 1/2 tsp to the batter) and some on top with my sugar as well.  Without that, the muffins might have been a bit bland, but they turned out great.  I loved the technique of softening the oatmeal in the milk.  The muffins were tender and got thumbs up from my boys!  Will make again!!

My husband liked these, but for me, they were lacking flavor. Definitely needs an addition of vanilla or almond extract, and perhaps a substitution of applesauce or butter for the oil. Increased chocolate chips. I like the idea of softening the oatmeal before adding the dry ingredients and will be trying this recipe again with a few personal tweeks.

I am really surprised at the overall rating on this one.  It's not one of the worst muffins I've ever had, but it's definitely not one of the best.  I increased the eggs to 2 since others said it crumbled badly - that did help some.  If it weren't for the chocolate chips, these would be rated one star - the base for these muffins is very bland and almost tasteless.  I had high hopes for this one with the oatmeal in it and was very disappointed.  No one in my family cared for them, and I won't be making them again unfortunately.  :o(  The Chocolate Chocolate Chip Muffins recipe on this site is much better.

I made these following the directions exactly and sad to say, only two of them got eaten, they had an odd taste only got worse as they got older. Also, I would NOT make these in muffin tins, half the muffin came off with them! definately not making these again.

I followed the recipe exact, only using mini chocolate chips instead of regular chocolate chips. When I baked these muffins, the batter spread over the top of the muffin tin and they really did not want to finish baking. Trying to get them out of the muffin tin was ridiculous, they stuck horribly. The kids ate them to be nice, my husband and I didn't even bother. Not a good recipe for us.

These muffins were great! Love the oatmeal texture. Made as directed except for pecans which I didn't have on hand. Made smaller muffins and they took about 16 minutes to cook for batches of 7. Make sure you are using quick cook oats!

I cut the pecans, added a 1/4 tsp of vanilla and almond extract, and topped with oats. Absolutely fabulous! So not healthy... (Note to one of the raters: the amount of baking powder is perfect - that's what makes them fluffy!)

These are really bland and hard to swallow, if it wasn't for the chocolate chips in it it would taste like baking powder (which I reduced, thankfully, 4tsp seemed like way to much), I even added vanilla cause it seemed to be missing something. I'm sorry but will not be making these again

These have become a regular breakfast favorite at our house.  We use whole wheat flour and substitute half the oil with applesauce, and they still taste great!  We also cook them at a slightly lower temperature, 375, which seems to work better in our oven.

I've been looking for a breakfast muffin for my husband and daughters when they are on the go. This was it! I am giving it 5 stars for the basic recipe (which I doubled), with the exception that I used mini chocolate chips and I screwed up and added ALL of the brown sugar. Oops! But I baked 6 mini muffins to see how the recipe tasted and baked. Great! So with the remaining batter, I added vanilla, 1 cup of raisins, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 pinch of nutmeg and an additional pinch of salt. Since I screwed up and added all of the brown sugar, I sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the tops, then baked. These are delicious either way.

I really enjoyed this muffin!  I changed it a little to add the flavor of butter.  I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup oil instead of all oil, and I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon as well.  Also, I microwaved the oatmeal/milk mixture for 30 seconds to help the milk soak in to the oatmeal.  Overall, I will probably make these muffins for my wife and me every weekend from now on!

I thought these were just ok.  I did use applesauce in place of the oil and I baked them in mini muffin pans.  I wish I would have read the all the reviews and decreased the baking powder.  I think I may try them again with less.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've just made this. I upped the chocolate chip to 1 cup and added 1 and 1/2 cups of shredded toasted coconut for flavour and used walnuts instead of pecan. I guess other reviewers are right, if it's not for the chocolate chip and nuts the batter has not much flavour, maybe because of the oats. perhaps adding more salt could help. nevertheless 4 star for the texture, a bit crumbly but really moist. I enjoyed it nevertheless :)

I've made these by the recipe a few times, just omitting the pecans sue to allergies, and I love them.  This time I wanted a little more flavour, so I added 1tsp cinnamon, 1/4tsp ginger, and 1/8tsp each nutmeg, cloves, and allspice.  Turned out amazing.  My only issue is that at least one of the muffins crumbles into several pieces when I try to remove them from the pan, I wish they held their shape a little better

Very easy to make and Easy to substitute ingredients- I used Spelt  flour instead of all purpose and added some flax and goji berry powder - my kids loved them

Just finished baking these muffins.  Doubled the recipe. 1/2 applesauce instead of oil and reduced baking powder by 1 tsp.  Used 1/2 whole wheat flour and used only 1 c of chocolate chips (plenty).  These muffins are so moist and delicious!  The only thing I will do differently next time is not to use paper liners as the muffins stick terribly.  Will be making often for school lunches. I would definetly recommend making these muffins!

My teen son had 2 of his pals over, and believe me, they know good from bad. They LOVED these! Ate 6 of the 12! I didn't have brown sugar, so substituted white, with some molasses, plus I added 1 tsp of vanilla. I think this added a lot of flavour, as I did not put the topping on them (no brown sugar) I also used non-salted butter instead of oil as butter always adds a wonderful taste to baked goods.  All in all, a very yummy, moist muffin that I will make again!

Excellent!  I hate when people change the recipe, but I did part by accident.  I went too quick and added all of the brown sugar to the mix instead of keeping some 

out.  They were still great.  I still added some to the top for fun :)  

We made 1/2 of them with white chocolate chips and 1/2 with milk chocolate chips.  My kids both voted the White Choc Chips Best.

Made these today with organic steel-cut oats and slightly soured milk, which required substituting 1 tsp. of baking soda for 1 tsp of baking powder. Very tasty muffins. Only problem is the semi-melted chocolate chips stuck to the baking papers. Maybe this is because I also substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil, but I think it was just the chocolate chips.

I thought these were really good!  I used regular oats (not quick cooking) because it was what I had.  I also substituted applesauce for the oil and almond milk for the regular milk, added vanilla and some cinnamon - very easy and relatively healthy!

I will give this recipe 3.5 stars. They were moist and fluffy but the muffin base was bland.I read the negative comments before making the recipe because I thought right away that the recipe had too much salt and baking powder. I cut baking powder and salt by half and added cinnamon. I had also sifted the dry ingredients. They rose up perfectly.

I chose to do 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil to cut the fat down and 1/2 whole wheat flour.

Still, good recipe and would be perfect with the addition of an extract. Will use the recipe again.

Cheers.

We really enjoyed this recipe however I made alot of changes. I used steel cut oats , whole wheat flour, honey instead of the sugar , and applesauce instead of the oil. I also added some cinnamon and vanilla. They were really moist, healthy, and very filling. I run a daycare and all the kids loved them!

They were easy to make, but not edible. I did not add the vanilla, but added more chocolate chips. Didn't matter, they tasted over-salted and under-sugared. Sad waste of time and ingredients.

Surprisingly good for how simple they are. Used walnuts instead of pecans. I didn't have the full 1 1/4 cups quick oats, so half of it was regular oats. I think this contributed to the texture, which was more like a bran muffin... not quite as soft and moist as a typical muffin, but that was OK by me. I added a tsp vanilla per other reviewers suggestions and I think I will try using some cinnamon in the topping next time too, to give it a little more kick. As is, it's probably a little plain, but there's so much room for variation.

I made these muffins and followed the directions exactly. My 3 year old took one bite, walked over to the garbage can and threw it out saying he didn't like it. I added 1tsp of vanilla, after reading the other reviews, and still thought the muffins were very bland. They need more sugar or something. I also used muffin cups for this recipe, and they were impossible to peel off without the whole muffin sticking to it.  I'll look for another recipe to try over this one.

I made a few changes and so that is why I rated only 4 stars. I added extra chocolate chips, a little extra brown sugar in the wet mix, 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract, applesauce instead of oil and skipped the nuts altogether (because I didn't have any). These were fantastic! The whole batch was gobbled up in a few hours by my family. I will definitely be making these again and very soon!

I just made this after a little hesitation due to the mixed reviews. These turned out great but I did modify them based on other reviews and to make them healthier. I used applesauce instead of oil, 1/2 cup of walnuts instead of the pecans, and only 1/2 cup of mini choco chips. I also added 2 tbsp ground flax seed, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup wheat germ. I got 24 mini muffins out of this recipe plus 7 regular size muffins. I just sprayed my mini muffin pan with Pam because I didn't have any liners for it and these came out just fine. I did use liners for the regular size muffins I made and they did really stick to it, next time I'll just stick with the Pam alone.

These baked up fine.  I didn't have problems with them being dry as others have had.  However, the flavor was not good.  The chocolate chips were the only part of the muffin that tasted good.  The rest of the flavors were too bitter.

I agree with others that these muffins came out too dry and crumbly. I should mention that I used raisins instead of chocolate chips and added 1 tsp vanilla as other suggested. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Don't think I'll make these again.

Really good recipe. I subbed the oil for apple sauce and the 1 cup of nuts for more chocolate chips. I also used the 1 tsp of vanilla and halfed the whole wheat flour with half white flour that was suggested by another viewer....sooooo good! I couldn't keep them around long enough to freeze any!

I doubled the recipe but got more than 24.  My hubby didn't like them but my kids did.  I thought they were okay, but I think the choc chips is what makes them that way.  The only change I made was I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour.  I don't think I'll make these again, there are other muffin recipes I like better.  Sorry.

Great muffins! I made changes based on previous reviews and got really good results. I only buy skim milk, which is not always the best for baking. So I added 1/4 cup of vanilla yogurt to 1 cup of skim milk to thicken it up a bit. I used 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup natural applesauce. I only used 2 tsp of baking powder and added 1 tsp of baking soda. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I usually like nuts (esp. pecans) but they didn't taste right in this recipe. Next time I will omit the pecans, or just use them for the topping (not in the actual muffin batter). I used medium-sized heart-shaped muffin tins and got 18 muffins! More than I expected. I baked them at 390 degrees for 20 minutes. Perfect! Thanks to all who wrote reviews for this recipe- such wonderful advice! Will make these again for sure.

I found this muffins to be extremely crumbly, they were so light and crumbly that they broke apart even after they have had sufficient time to cool.  Any ideas why this would be?  I also thought they had a bit of an after taste, could there be too much baking powder in the recipe?

These just came out of the oven, and they are fantastic!  I always read through the reviews, sorted by most helpful, and here are the changes that did.  I used half regular and half whole wheat flour, egg beaters instead of egg, used only 2 Tbsp oil, and used applesauce to make 1/2 cup, used miniature chocolate chips, added a splash of vanilla,and just used 2 TBSP pecans in the muffins, and 2 TBSP for the topping, that's just personal preference.  I try to substitute applesauce for oil in some baked goods, and this is by far the best results!

Yum, Yum, Yum!  These are wonderful muffins, excellent tast and texture.  I subbed 1/2 cup of wholewheat flour and used raisins instead of pecans.  I don't normally use veg oil in my baking and I only had a couple of spoonfuls of apple sauce left so I used that and added a pureed ripe banana.  The recipe states it will make 12 muffins and I managed 21. Plenty for the freezer now.

I used applesauce instead of oil for a moist muffin. Instead of chocolate chips i cut up chunks of cadbury dark chocolate and of course i mixed in SKOR toffee bits into the "streusal" topping. DELICIOUS!

definitely the best chocolate chip muffins i've ever made. i was surprised how moist this recipe turned out. i followed the recipe exactly, except i omitted the pecans and i used mini chocolate chips. i also followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1 tsp of vanilla. it was YUMMY! next time i might add a pinch of cinnamon, but other than that.. perfect :)

Very easy recipe and the muffins were great!  I like oatmeal/raisin better then oatmeal/chocolate but they were still a hit!

These were okay. They were quite dry, not nearly as moist as i expected them to be with all the wet ingredients. I Thought maybe that was my fault with the first batch. They came out a little too brown. But when i put in the second batch i cooked them for less time and they were STILL too dry. i did replace half the oil with yogurt, but that usually doesnt have that effect on muffins. I dont know. I would make them again but maybe try applesauce instead of yogurt.

Really delightful muffin, especially when just out of the oven and the chocolate is all melty gooey goodness. 4 because I added a couple of things - 3/4 cup dried shredded coconut, 1 tsp vanilla essence, 1 tsp allspice, 1 tsp cinnamon. Also just used rolled oats because i didn't have quick cooking oats, and buttermilk instead of milk, which made them rise really beautifully - turned out really well. The pecans on the top started to burn very slightly because of the high heat, but just watch them.

Good muffins! I did change the recipe a little bit, though. I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter, used 1/2 cup  melted butter instead of the oil, and used half and half instead of the milk. The muffins were very flavorful and moist, contrary to the reviews I read from those who made the recipe as is. My version is definitely not low fat, but boy is it yummy!

I just made these tonight and they turned out pretty good!  I made some adjustments though.  Like most reviewers I cut the amount of baking powder and oil. I used half the oil and added 1/4 cup of OJ (you could taste the hint of orange), some vanilla, and cinnamon.  

Also, my dad wanted raisins so I put 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/4 cup of choc. chips.  I'm allergic to nuts so I omitted those.  But I added some extra cinnamon to the brown sugar topping and it was great!

The only problem, they didn't rise much.  But they were still soft, moist and delicious.

Very good.  We skipped the pecans, and they were still really good.  It made more than the recipe stated- 12 regular sized muffins plus about a dozen mini muffins.

Very good, easy to do muffins recipe. I didn't find it dry at all, even after 3 days the muffins were made. May be not sweet enough for somebody.... just add a lil more sugar!

This recipe is really good.  Even my picky 8-year old loved them!  I adjusted the b. powder to 2t and substituted vanilla soy milk mixed with water for the milk(my youngest has a dairy allergy).  I also added 3/4 t of cinnamon. I only had white sugar so I mixed 3/4 c of the sugar right into the recipe.  Also, I omitted the nuts. The sweetened soy milk added some flavor and sweetness.  You probably could vary the flavors using flavored liquid coffee creamer mixed with water, too. But you might want to reduce the sugar to 1/2 c.  All in all a great recipe- very versatile and so good!

Excellent results with a few alterations. I also changed from 4 tsp to 2 tsp of baking powder and had perfect results. Changed to 1 cup all purpose and 1/4c whole wheat flour. I omitted the pecans, but added a dash of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. The muffins are moist, not too dense and offer similar but better results than the Quaker Oatmeal Muffin mix in the supermarkets.

I used two tsp of baking powder instead of 4, I cant see why you would 4 for muffins! And I added a tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg, for flavor. I think they would be rather bland with out it. The muffins are OK, definately not a favorite.

I was disappointed in these muffins after all the great reviews. They had absolutely no taste. I'm glad I used a lot of chocolate chips in them, because the muffin itself was incredibly bland. I even reread the recipe because I thought I may have missed something...like sugar, but I did use the 1/2 cup of brown sugar the recipe called for. I even added a streusel topping to the muffin. I will not be making these again.

I used half whole wheat flour and added 1/4 c. wheat germ. I cut back the brown sugar to 1/2 c. and the mini chocolate chips to 1/2 c. I also left out all of the oil. With these changes, the muffins are a bit healthier, yet they still taste great. Thanks, Kari, for a terrific muffin recipe.

I turned this recipe into "muffin mix" for Christmas by combining the dry ingredients, chocolate chips, and pecans in a bag with instructions to add the wet ingredients and bake.  I tested it first. The recipe works perfectly mixed that way, and you only need one bowl.  Just let the fully mixed batter sit while the oven preheats.  I also didn't notice that you were supposed to reserve part of the brown sugar and pecans for a topping, and I put it all in the mix.  Nonetheless, they tasted wonderful, and I will make them again.

Recipe looked healthy'ish but these muffins just crumble and/or fall apart.   I tried the recipe again (thinking maybe I messed up last time) but the result is the same.   A waste of good ingredients.

Similar to my own recipe.   Perhaps if you use 1-1/2 tsps. of baking powder and a 1/2 tsp. of baking soda you will have a more moist muffin.

Although I found these muffins moist and chocolatey, I didn't like the oil in place of butter as I thought the muffins tasted like oil and even smelled like oil as they baked even though I reduced the amount of oil by 1/2.  I left out the brown sugar topping and nuts, and other than the oily taste, they weren't missing those ingredients.  I replaced 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour and you would never know the difference.  Muffins were done after 18 minutes though....watch if you have a hot oven!

These are very delicious!  After reading the reviews, I was able to make the following adjustments:
 - I used regular oats.
 - I used 1/4 c. applesauce, 1/4 c. oil.  Came out very moist!
 - 1 T. baking powder and only 1/2 tsp. salt
 - Added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla
 - Sprinkled the tops of the muffins with nuts, a few oats, chocolate pieces and some cinnamon.  No sugar.
 - Next time, I will add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter.
 - I made 8 muffins. Baked 24 minutes at 375 degrees.  This was plenty.  Part of the problem in one of the other reviews could have been they were just over-baked.  Especially with the brown sugar on top.  Overall, a good recipe.  The pecans are a nice twist!  Blessings!

I have been trying to make more "homemade" recipes for my family. Instead of saving money with the recipe I ended up losing money. I tried this recipe three times with no success. No matter what I tried they were dry and stuck to the pan. Yes, I even oiled cup liners and could not get the paper off of the muffins. It's not fair to blame the recipe entirely since I am well aware I am not a great cook. (That is why I gave it two stars instead of one.) Guess for now I will stick to boxed muffin mixes.

I left out the nuts in the batter and increased the chocolate chips (used mini) to 1 1/2 cups. I did also add small swig of vanilla. I used the nut and sugar topping on half the muffins and left half without. They turned out great!

Excellent! Easy and delicious. Didn't change a thing...well except I mixed in all the ingredients instead of using the remains as topping. Used butter non-stick spray in the tins and the muffins came out perfectly.

Made these yesterday. I found them to be very moist and really yummy. I didn't have any problems with them tasting "off" or too starchy. Maybe some people just don't make muffins well. The 15 min wait time didn't bother me either. It may be a bit inconvenient if the muffins are all your are making, but if you're making them to go with something then the 15 min gives you time to keep preparing other things. I did omit the nuts and used a granola crumble on top instead. They tasted great!

This recipe is awesome! I make it healthier by adding raisins instead of chocolate chips; olive oil instead of vegetable; 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4; whole wheat instead of white flour. They are moist and healthy!!! YUM!

I tried these with part white flour and part wheat flour--not a good idea.  With the oatmeal it makes them too dry.  Otherwise, a good muffin recipe

Absolutly LOVE these!!! I've made them a few times. Once using applesauce instead of oil, this gives them a completely different flavor. They are best as is!!!

My family loved these muffins!  I added 1 tsp of vanilla, just for a little added flavor, otherwise followed the directions exactly.  Mine did not come out dry at all and did not fall apart.  Will definitely make them again!

These were quick, easy and tasted as good as they sounded! To make them healthier next time I plan to use apple sauce instead of oil, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and maybe add a banana or pumpkin!  Also, I thought that the quantity of baking soda and salt sounded like it was going to be too much. I think I'll use a little less of each next time.

Very disappointed with these muffins.  Followed the recipe exactly, and the muffins were extremely crumbly.  Had extreme difficulty removing them from muffin pan in one piece.  Will not use this recipe again.

The first time I made these, they came out great. The second time, they were very dry. I think the first time, I adapted the recipe and the second time, I followed the recipe exactly. Today I made these again and this is what I did: -Added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla -Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon -Left out the nuts, so I added more chips. Also, I used a combination of mini and regular chips.   They were delicious!! It made 18 muffins, which probably means my muffin tins were smaller. I cut the time down a bit to account for this. The full time would have dried them out, I think.

So good! These are always a hit and are awesome exactly as the recipe calls. However, I like to add a teaspoon or two of vanilla extract to the milk before I add the oatmeal, and I usually cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp or so.  Highly recommended.

I made these this morning with a couple of substitutions... no nuts (because I didn't have any), and added cinnamon and a bit of vanilla for flavor per another review.    I'm really bummed that they didn't turn out very good.  My daughter who eats practically ANYTHING will not eat these.    Problems:  Too dry (and, no, I did not over mix).  Other than the chocolate chips, they have no flavor despite my additions of cinnamon and vanilla.    I'm just not sure what would make them better other than some experimenting... maybe some mashed banana?  Anyway, I won't be making this recipe again.

Very tasty. Like everyone else, I modified the recipe.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of oil, 1 tsp baking powder instead of 4, added 1 tsp baking soda, and cut the salt in half.  I also added 2 tblsp ground flax seed and omitted the pecans.  I just threw all the ingredients together and baked.  I did not make a topping like the instructions say.  I will probably make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

After making these muffins, I came back to the site to see if I had misread the review/overall rating.  My family is like Mikey, we will eat just about anything, but we have to draw the line on these.  They were bitter, bland, dry and not worth the trouble.

Fairly bland with the exception of the chocolate chips in every bite. Not a bad "healthy" vehicle for delivering chocolate chips to my mouth, but could have more flavor.

These are ok... for some reason all I taste is the baking powder?  They are a bit dry too.  Perhaps it's something I did but I'll be trying something different next time.

This is my first negative review.  I will give it 3 stars due to the fact that I did not add the topping.  I seriously doubt that some nuts and brown sugar could save these dry, cardboard tasting muffins. We bake a lot and these were the worst of our creations to date......lack of taste, poor texture, nothing redeeming whatsoever.

I didn't love these. I made three different batches of muffins, using three different recipes from this site. This was my least favorite, by a lot. The muffins did not raise as much as I would have liked. There was an overwhelming "cereal" taste from the oatmeal (and I love oatmeal), and they were not sweet enough. Even the chocolate chips couldn't make these better. I won't be making these again.

these where amazing!! Loved how they had a crunchy exterior and a soft, warm interior. I also substituted the chocolate chips with raisins and they were still just as good! The rasins were nice and warm when  u bit into them. Looking forward to trying this recipe again!

I like this recipe because of the high proportion of heart-healthy/good carb. oatmeal and the low amount of oil (as opposed to margarine) (i reduced the oil by half the amount. I also reduced the regular flour by 1/4 cup because of the oil left out, added some shakes of cinnamon and some vanilla extract. I left out the nuts as my kids are not such big fans for them. These were very good and my kids were very excited to have these for breakfast!

Took these to a muffin exchange this weekend, and they are my husband's favorite of the dozen varieties I brought back.  I made a few changes: used applesauce instead of oil to make them more moist and healthier, left out the nuts in case anyone had allergies, added more choc. chips to replace the nuts, added vanilla, used 1/2 whole wheat flour, and left off the topping - didn't need it!  Thanks for the great recipe base!

After taking her first bite of these muffins, my 10 yr old daughter said..."Mom, these are the first muffins I ever loved!" They were excellent...pretty healthy/hearty with a touch of chocolate. I used mini chocolate chips and halved the amount since I don't like to have a sugar high at breakfast. I thought this was perfect.

Really good recipe. I substituted the oil with applesauce, added some cinnamon, and an extra 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. I omitted the nuts. We all loved them. Thanks!

This was the best chocolate chip muffin recipe that I have tried so far.  My 1 1/2 year old could not get enough.  I had made two adjustments.  I used old fasion oats instead of quick cooking.  I think that it made it a little heartier. I put all of the brown sugar in the recipe instead of on top.  It did not seem to make it too sweet by adding it all in the mixture.....A must try especially with kids.

These muffins were surprisingly delicious!  They reminded me of chocolate-chip oatmeal cookies, only in a cakey, muffin form!  I omitted the pecans and used a heaping cup of milk chocolate chips, and they came out perfect.  I'm sure the pecans would taste fantastic, I just didn't have any on hand.  These were much more of a dessert than a breakfast muffin (unless you start off your days particularly decadently!) - a warm and filling treat on a snowy winter day!

As for taste:  Very good!  I really like them.  I was looking for something a little more oatmeal-ly, however, so next time I would substitute at least 1/4 cup of the flour for an additional 1/4 cup of oatmeal.

There were some issues with preparation that created minor hassles.  The recipe is still worth using, and now that I've made it once I would alter it to avoid the problems I had:

Unless you have HUGE muffin tins or fill the tins completely full rather than half full, this makes more than 12 muffins.  I filled mine completely full, which resulted in messy clean-up, since the sugar/pecan topping overflowed and baked onto the muffin pan (the batter did not overflow, however, so the finished muffins looked good).  

Also, because I was worried about doneness with the tins so full, I tried to hold out until the upper end of the baking time, but had to give up with 2 minutes or so to go because to tops were already getting too brown/bordering on black in a few spots.  I pulled them out and tested with a toothpick at that point and they were cooked through, but if yours are not quite done yet browning too much, you could cover the whole pan with foil near the end of the baking time.

Also, for some reason these muffins stuck to the paper liners I used more than usual, and tended to fall apart when I tried to remove them.  To be on the safe side, I'd advise using the foil liners rather than paper ones (since I have found these to come off much more easily) if you are like me

I absolutely love this recipe!  I have made it as written, or omitted the topping, or substituted 1C bluberries, 1\2c almonds and 1t cinnamon for the chocolate chips and pecans.  Always turn out delicious!

Quite a gut-bomb, which is what I was looking for.  I added applesauce, hoping it would moisten them a bit, but it was still too dry for my taste.

Very tasty muffins.  I left out the nuts and added a little vanilla, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They did not rise quite as much as I was expecting, and I was left with smaller muffins than I was hoping for.  Next time I will fill the muffin pan more.

This recipe is great and very easy.  Since the oatmeal and milk have to set for 15 minutes, I use that time to finish some other kitchen duties, like empty the dishwasher, etc.  I eliminated the pecans when I made it as we just don't care for nuts in our muffins.  They are very filling, and often requested by my family.  It's a new family staple recipe now.

This was the best oatmeal chocolate chip muffin that I have ever made! I wanted to find a good recipe with good ratings for a quick snack, and this was exactly what I was looking for. It was easy to make and the muffins turned out moist and delicious! I put less brown sugar as I don't like eating stuff that are too sweet, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect! I will definitely make it again, thanks alot for the recipe!

I used 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 cup mini chocolate chips and 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips.  I omitted all the pecans since none of us are big nut fans.  They were decent muffins although a tad dry and crumbly.  If I was to make them again I might soak the oatmeal for longer.

This is a great recipe. I made a few alterations... less sugar, add a little maple syrup. I added raisins and cut the chocolate in half. I substituted walnuts for pecans and used coconut oil and some of my flour was whole wheat. The muffins didn't stick to the papers, had a great consistency and looked nice even though I didn't sprinkle anything on top. Even cool, these are great.

I'm giving this a five star rating because it took me only a few minutes to whip up a batch. The first batch turned out beautifully and as soon as the first batch came out of the oven, I immediately started on the second batch, just so I could share these with friends that I was meeting for morning coffee. Out of my excitement in seeing the first batch and making the second one, I forgot to sprinkle brown sugar on top of the second one before placing them in the oven. But, they turned out as wonderful as the first one!!

I will definately make these again.

Oh, I didn't have any pecans...so I didn't put any in the muffins. Wonderful, wonderful muffins!!!!

This is my first time to rate a recipe on this site...how exciting :)

anyway, i thought these muffins were fabulous!  the texture was perfect and the sweetness just right.  i did make the following adjustments:  i soaked the oats in 1 cup milk for about 20 hours, i added 1/4 cup of plain yogurt to that later.  used about 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, used a scoop of flaxseed, 1/4 cup sucanat in place of 1/4 cup of brown sugar, applesauce instead of oil, and used milk chocolate chips as that was all i had on  hand.  i did not have pecans.  these really were great and i look forward to seeing what my little ones think of them.

These are not beautiful muffins. They did not rise well so they look pretty small. However, I give them a big thumbs up for taste. A yummy breaskfast muffin. I made just a couple changes: I used vanilla half and half in place of the milk, carob chips in place of the chocolate, canola oil in place of the veggie oil, "EnerG Egg Replacer" in place of the egg, and added cin to the topping. 

These are a bit crumbly but are still 4 stars in my book.

I make a "healthy" batch of muffins almost weekly for my kids for breakfasts. These were easy, and delicious and the chocolate chips were a nice addition for the kids. They deserve a treat every so often. I used 3/4 cup cinnamon applesauce (Sarah's Applesauce recipe from here) in place of oil, I also let the oats soak a good 15 minutes (i ran out of flour and had to run to the store). I also used a about a 1/2 cup of wholewheat flour. I omit the sugar/nuts from the top because I felt they had enough sugar.

Very tasty! Extremely moist and delicious.. I made a few (read: many) modifications :D

I used about 1 cup of dried fruit instead of the chocolate chips - equal parts chopped apricots, dates and raisins. I also added some ground almonds to the crumble topping. About a quarter cup more brown sugar to the batter made them a bit sweeter, and better! (in my opinion).

Deeeelicious.

This was okay. I added some cinnamon and vanilla extract and omitted the pecans. The taste was good, but the muffins were just too dry. Both of my kids wouldn't eat them either, which surprised me because they had chocolate chips in them! I probably won't make them again.

Very easy and filling muffin, but much faster if you do not top with reserved pecan mix, just combine it all.

Good muffin.  I added a little extra brown sugar (2T?) in the muffin itself because I tend to like a little sweeter muffin.  It wasn't overly sweet.  A very good morning treat.

This actually worked! Muffins generally don't agree with me much. But this one is really really great...i doubled the recipe...used 1/2 cup oil and 1/4 melted marg. and i used walnuts instead of pecans...and i thought the salt was too much , best to cut it down to 1/2 teaspoon... but they were great!

We love those. Didn't have any walnuts on hand. Substituted apple sauce for the oil (great results), used 2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda instead of 4 tsp baking soda (yes, you can taste it a bit), and used rolled oats instead of quick cooking oats. Didn't use the topping but would for a special occasion. They are just as nice with apple sauce instead of oil IMO. A keeper!

Excellent muffin.  Beats box recipe by a mile.  Not too much sugar in it; I added two ripe bananas and used half whole wheat flour and only needed about 15 min. of cooking time.  This is so much better than I expected it to be!

Great recipe!  The muffins were light and tasty.  Just the right touch of sweetness.  I subbed OJ for the milk as another user suggested since my husband can't have dairy.  It gave the muffins a really nice and subtle orange flavor.  I was worried about the 4tspns of baking powder, but they turned out fine with all of it.  i also only added 1/4 cup of oil instead of 1/2 cup and i only put the first 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

edit: after a day or two, i think i could taste the baking powder.  next time i think i'll reduce the amount.

Delicious!  I didn't bother adding the extra brown sugar because I thought it would be too much.  I also nixed the pecans because I don't like them.  All in all--good!

I used applesauce insted of oil, no pecans, only 1/2 cup chocolate chips, and replaced 1/2 cup of the flower with whole wheat flour.  They are pretty good, but I am a huge fan of oatmeal and chocolate chips.

These muffins are just so yummy!  I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and substituted coconut for the pecans and didn't top them with brown sugar.  They tasted amazing!  I also used bigger muffin cups to make six instead of 12.

These were very good. I too used the small choc chips (and only used 1/2 cup - which was plenty). I also cut the oil to 1/4 cup - which was also fine. Skipped the pecans.

These muffins are extremely messy to eat (especially right out of the oven).  The chocolate just seems to get everywhere, but they taste amazing.  I doubled the recipe like suggested.  Used half whole wheat flour.  Also I only used half the amount of brown sugar.  Didn't use any oil (I cook with the turbocooker so I don't need oil).  Walnuts were used instead of pecans and I added a tsp of vanilla.  Next time I think that I'll just use brown sugar on top of the muffins and put the rest of the nuts into the batter.  This was a very delicious recipe but I don't recommend making the healthy substitutions that I made.  I have also found that these do not save well in the freezer (at least in my experience).

Great muffins. My kids love them. I've been looking for a good after school snacks and this recipe definitely makes the list. I cut the amount of oil in it to 1/4 cup and they were perfect. Thanks Kari for such a great recipe!

A very good recipe. Delious muffins! If you like chocolate this is the muffin for you, if not do not use the full 3/4 of a cup. The muffins have too much chocolate in them.

WOW! These are wonderful...dense, moist, delicious.  I used 1 tsp. of vanilla as suggested by other reviewers.  The only other thing I did differently was to add the flour mixture to the wet mixture instead of the other way around as stated in the recipe.  While the oats were soaking I mixed the dry ingred. and all the wet ingredients (except the oats/milk) in separate bowls.  Made mixing them up a snap, then right into the oven.  My oven runs hot so they only needed 17 minutes.  I will make these forever!

When I tasted the muffin, it was very bland. I added some cinnamon and some vanilla to add flavor and it made almost no difference. This recipe has good potential of you add the right flavors, but alone it does not taste very good.

I just added a bit of vanilla, and subbed half of the oil for butter, to get a bit of a buttery flavour. Great muffins, will make again.

these muffins were pretty good, all i did differently is add a bit more flour when mixing in the dry ingredients, because it looked pretty liquidy. I  will probably make them again,  and rated them four stars.

I used half extra virgin olive oil and half soybeans oil instead  of the vegetable oil. I also put all the brown sugar(dark) in the mix as against using some as topping. I used dark chocolate instead of the semi sweet chips. It came out really moist- which was really surprising.

Perfect morning muffins! I substituted coconut milk for standard due to severe lactose intolerance.  Added a tiny bit of vanilla extract and used espresso chocolate chips. .... Soaked the oatmeal for 20 minutes because wasnt sure how the coconut milk would permeate the rolled oats. Sprinkled a little decorating sugar on top.  It worked amazingly! I already ate two!

These turned out great! I substituted coconut milk, replaced 1 cup of the white flour with wheat flour , used mini chocolate chips, and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I also didn't add the brown sugar on top, since I was out of time. They disappeared almost instantly and my guests loved them.

Very easy to make and you can add almost anything you'd like to the recipe. I used milk chocolate chips and walnuts in mine. I also used real butter instead of oil. So versatile and easy to make, they were gone in a day

These are so good! I did take advice from some of the reviews and cut baking powder to 3 1/2tsp and salt to 3/4 tsp. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla and cinnamon. I used regular oats and it's a must that you soak them in the milk as instructed. I also used regular sized chocolate chips  as well. My oven is gas and only a year old so I baked mine at 400 for 20 minutes. These came out so moist! Chocolate chips throughout and great flavor!

Not the best recipe . Very moist, but not much flavor. Like other people said, you can taste the baking powder . But soaking the oatmeal really made the batter very moist and easy to mix. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla, but still very blend! I won’t use this recipe again. I have made better muffins then this before!

I made these last week and was really dissatisfied. They were super salty, not very sweet, and had a baking powdery taste. I think that was partially my fault because my salt was really humid and clumpy and I didn't measure the sugar properly (used 1/2 cup by accident). 
Made them again this week. I cut the salt in half, added vanilla extract and replaced 1/4 cup of the flour with cocoa powder (just cause I wanted double chocolate) they came out good but nothing incredible. 
If you dont like a really sweet muffin it's good, might try this again but will probably tweak it until I like the flavor. It's a good basic recipe and can probably be made into many different flavors.

I can honestly say these muffins lacked flavour and were very dry. Even making adjustments couldnt fix them.

Used applesauce in place of oil, and added cinnamon and vanilla. Omitted the salt and nuts, and used only 2 tsp baking powder. Cooked for 15 min at 400. Turned out great.

The flavour was okay, after reading the reviews I did 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and added one teaspoon of vanilla. However, it was still pretty bland. Also, the muffins stuck to the wrapper and fell apart really easily. I will keep looking for other muffin recipes, would not recommend this one.

I made these muffins quickly on a mid-week morning. I found myself without an egg - so made a flax egg. Also did 1/4 melted coconut oil and 2 tbsp of vegetable oil. They turned out perfect at 400 for 20 mins. 

This will be added to my bank of recipes!

My whole family loved these. Must admit that the amount of baking powder seemed quite high and so I reduced it by 1 tsp;  the muffin was still nice and light. Great recipe; thanks!

These are delicious, moist, and easy to make. I used mini chocolate chips as many others recommended.  The recipe came out to 17 muffins for me.  I plan to make them again.

I doubled this recipe and it was enough to make 24 muffins with a little batter left over.  I made it as written but added some vanilla and omitted the nuts so that my kids can take them to school.  They were done after about 26 minutes but my muffin cups were filled all the way.   They came out a little dry but still tasty.

Very fluffy but only tasted the oil. Definitely wouldn’t make them again.  I omitted the nuts and didn’t add the brown sugar on top but that shouldn't have made them flavourless.

This turned out perfectly and I am a troubled baker.  Followed the directions precisely.  I didn't need to change a thing.  Not dry at all. Perfectly moist inside. If I do anything different next time it would be to add vanilla.  My 6 year old LOVED it.

Absolutely delicious! I used Old Fashioned Oats and soaked for an additional 5 minutes. I would suggest carefully watching your oven temp; I checked my muffins at 15 minutes and needed to adjust down to 375 degrees and they were ready in 18 minutes.  So far these are my favorite muffins from Allrecipes! Will definitely make these again!

Amazing muffins!!! I removed the nuts and made it a cup of chocolate chips instead. So moist and delicious. DONT SKIP SOAKING THE OATS! It makes it super tender. I’ll never have another muffin again. This has corrupted me for life.

These muffins were very good. The only changes I made were to use walnuts instead of pecans because I didn't have any pecans, and to use mini chocolate chips instead of regular sized chips. I chopped the walnuts up very fine which seemed to make topping the muffins easier. I thought the muffins were quite sweet (due to the topping, I think), but that was okay with me!

Nice and easy! I added 1 tbsp of chia seeds and 3 tbsp of ground flax and they turned out really good! I added the chocolate chips last and only needed to bake for 18min

My new favourite muffin. Followed the recipe, except I used my homemade muesli mix(large flake oats, pepitas, flaked coconut, dried cherries, pecans & sliced almonds) instead of just oats. Turned out fantastic, especially warm from the oven with the melted chocolate chips. A keeper that I will try on my library coworkers soon! Oh yeah, one more change, I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup coconut oil for the oil as I usually do when making muffins.

I make these for my boy for school lunches! They are hearty and filling for the day.  I did omit the nuts (as to school policy), I did not add the brown sugar topping purely just to reduce calories  and added in 1 tsp of vanilla extract.

These didn't turn out so well for me.  I doubled the recipe, then added a sprinkle of dried cranberries to my half and omitted the nuts on the other half because my daughter doesn't care for them.  The taste is bland but they did bake rather well.

Our  adopted grandchildren (quintuplets) gave these muffins 5 stars.. They loved these even though I forgot to put the chopped pecans in the batter. I sprinkled some on top. Next time I'm going to use mini chocolate chips and put the pecans in the batter. I make them muffins each week to insure they eat something for breakfast before school.

This was my first time baking muffins ever (recently moved out of my parents). They actually turned out quite well. I didn't have vegetable oil, so followed other suggestions and substituted in apple sauce, added in vanilla extract and also left out the nuts. I baked for 20 minutes and they baked perfectly. Overall I would make it again, however they did end up a tad bit dry though not too bad.

These came out excellent - I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla, and omitted nuts (added extra chocolate chips).  I've made these three times in as many weeks, as requested by my 11 year old (who, by the way, claims she hates all things "oatmeal").  They do have a lumpy texture, but no one complained and they taste terrific.  I've made these a couple times now and use mini chocolate chips one time - I definitely preferred the regular size chips for some reason.

These are SO GOOD! I don't want to be one of those people that changes a recipe a lot and then reviews it, but I seriously just want to share with you what I did so that you can have something just as amazing as I had. As some others suggested, I used half apple sauce for the oil amount. I only did 3 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of baking soda, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla. Half whole wheat flour and half all purpose. So glad I did!!! My kids can't stop eating them!

I didn't have pecans and substituted walnuts. Didn't like the muffins with the walnuts, but I bet they would very good with pecans or without nuts. I sprinkled coarse turbinado sugar on top along with the brown sugar, which worked very well. They do fall apart easily as other reviewers have said.

You won't regret making these - do them exactly as described and they come out great.  Moist, sweet, flavorful.  I used cooking spray on the muffin tins, no paper cups, no prob.. popped right out.  If you don't have the exact ingredients but can get close, they'll still come out great.  On various occasions, I've used walnuts instead of pecans,  ran out of oil so used half melted butter / half oil, added 1 tsp cinnamon (or not),  1 tsp vanilla (or not).   They only get better.    So far my favorite includes the cinnamon & vanilla.   (did I say these are really good?)

I don't know where I went wrong. Maybe my oven, but these didn't bake well and I'm so disappointed. Was looking forward to eating these! I substituted regular flour for almond flour. I don't know if that have any affect on the outcome.

This was the most successful muffin recipe i have done  to date. The kids loved it. I used Bear Naked sea salted carmel apple granola instead of just plain oatmeal  this added a ton of flavor and I left the topping off. I also added another 1/4 cup of flour because the batter was a little loose over all moist and sweet

I made no changes to the recipe, and really liked that they weren't super sweet. I'll try adding the vanilla when I make them again, because they are a touch bland, but otherwise they were tasty and they are easy to make.

to much baking powder gives it a starchy acidic taste, should consider half the amount next time.  afraid that the muffin will not be fluffy by reducing the baking powder. so, i'll half the baking powder less the oats next time.

These were just ok. I added vanilla and extra chocolate chips, which I think saved the recipe. They did have an off-putting bitter taste from the crazy amount of baking powder. I knew better but decided to follow it anyway. I probably wouldn't make them again.
Also, 400 is way too high for muffins. 350 for 20 minutes and they baked perfectly.

I use this recipe often, along with all of Janice's recommendations ( 4/1/2008) except for the applesauce, which we never have on hand. It's probably as good or better that way as well. I love these as a breakfast or easy snack and so do my kids. :)

I made these with truvia brown sugar,  half the fat then added 1/4 cup applesauce, cut the chips to 1/2 cup, cut the nuts to 1/2 cup (i used walnuts)  and used almond milk instead of regular milk. Got the calorie count down to 225 per muffin. Really good and rose well.  I think some chopped dried cherries would be a great addition.

Great recipe! Moist muffins! I only used 1/2 c. pecans, used mini choc chips, and used regular oats (soaked 5 min longer) because that is all I had.  I substituted half applesauce for half of oil and added  a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  Make sure to bake at minimum time and use cupcake liners, then you don't have to worry about muffins sticking to pan.

Delicious! Made as written except for the tops:  I used only about 1/8 cup brown sugar, the 1/4 c seemed a lot  & I mixed pecan's and slivered almonds as I didn't have enough pecans.

I made these yesterday because my husband and I are broke. I had to leave out the nuts because I didn't have any, and I really love this recipe. It isn't overly sweet, but I can tell nuts will add a really great touch. Definitely will make again.

Pretty tasty muffins! 
I followed the recipe, the only thing I added was a teaspoon of vanilla because some reviews mentioned the muffin itself was kind of tasteless, I think the vanilla added a nice flavour.
Wasn't super crazy about the topping. Next time I will probably just add the extra sugar and pecans right into the batter.
Will definitely make these again!

A tasty recipe, and a great breakfast treat!
I added 4 oz of apple sauce to the batter, and topped it with a white sugar and cinnamon mixture instead of brown sugar.

For healthier version I just change my flour to 1/2 whole wheat. 1/2 soy flour.  Used the sugar free chocolate chip. Change the milk to organic unsweetened soymilk.  And truvia brown sugar.  It turned out really good. And im not a baker. I just want to make a dessert for me that doesn't have a lot of sugar.

I made it exactly as described except I used walnuts instead of pecans. I found the 1/4 cup extra brown sugar and half cup of nuts for the topping to be way more than needed. I also ended up with 16 muffins instead of 12 and they baked in 20 minutes. The taste is a bit on the bland side. Better when eaten warm from the oven and chocolate chips are melted. Not bad, but I don't think I'd make them again without some kind of modifications.

My family loved these cookies.  I reduced the brown sugar by 1/4 cup (used 1/2 cup, did not sprinkle sugar on top) and added 1/4 cup cocoa.

I LOVED these muffins something different to add to the breakfast rotation. I used Janices recipe (except for the apple sauce) because I have 7 picky sibilings. I am fifteen years old and the recipe was a sooo easy. I however made my own changes, I have a sugar- sensitive older sister and she cant have too much sugar, so I substitued the brown sugar for honey (which doesnt rise your glycemic level) and didn't sprinkle brown sugar on top and they were a success! so I give this recipe 5 stars!

Omg I loved these. 
I made a batch last night and when I got home from school today not one was left. 
These are a protein filled, great tasting, healthy muffin. 
I made a second batch tonight but made some changes. One of which I baked them with honey drizzled on the top. They are great. Ok no more ranting need to eat muffins.

I love this recipe! Used it for years now. I’ve made some modifications from time to time to change it up in terms of flavour. My latest I added yogurt( activity single serving cup- 100 G) chia seeds and blueberries instead of nuts and chocolate chips. Super yummy!

This recipe was great. Very easy to make. I used applesauce instead of oil and omitted the pecans altogether (for school approval). The extra chocolate chips gave it an added sweetness. The muffins were a tad bland and could probably benefit from done cinnamon and vanilla.  They were at hit with the kids though and that's a winner in my books!

I really loved the recipe but I think next time with some changes would be better. Mine turned out tasting a tiny bit bland and a little tiny bit salty. Next time I'm not going to add the salt but instead add some vanilla and cinnamon. Other than that I think next time these will turn out perfect! The consistency was fantastic.

This is a really good recipe! I had to make a couple changes though - I had gotten the oats and milk soaking and went to get the rest of the ingredients measured out and ready to go. Only to reach for the chocolate chips to discover I didn't have any. So I just tossed in a good handful of raisins, added about a half teaspoon of cinnamon and about a half teaspoon of vanilla instead. I think if I make them with raisins again I will add a bit more cinnamon and maybe another tablespoon or so of milk, I had forgotten the fact that raisins soak up some of the liquid lol I will for sure try this again - maybe next time with the chocolate chips :)

Soaking the oats in chocolate milk and adding 1 tsp vanilla added some extra yummy-ness. I used mini chocolate chips, left out the nuts (step kids won't eat them) and added more chocolate chips. I also left off the brown sugar topping as I felt it would be way too sweet. Family loved them!

I used this recipe today and changed it up some. I used have wheat flour and half all purpose flour, half oil and half applesauce, then added cinnamon and vanilla extract. I didn't have nuts so I added ground flaxseed to give them a nutty flavor. Since I was looking a more fall flavor I used white chocolate chip mixed with pumpkin spice chips. 
They are delicious! 
Thank you for the base recipe.

These muffins were delicious! We used whole wheat flour which made them look pretty dark and we were worried they were burnt, but they weren't at all. The consistency of the batter was definitely wetter than "moist", so mix until combined (don't overmix) would be a better way to put it.

The only thing I would change is the amount of baking powder. You can taste it in every bite, and I questioned the amount while mixing it in. I would definitely recommend using only 2-3 teaspoons.

I've made the recipe 3 times now- once each with chocolate chips, peaches, & strawberries.  We've loved them each time!  It makes a great base batter to add whatever you want.

After reading several of the reviews I decided to go ahead and try these...I didn't have nuts on hand so I used 1 cup dark chocolate chips...I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla since a couple reviewers seemed to think these muffins lacked flavor...I used whole oats since that's what I have on hand...I first measured them out and added the milk so they could soak...I didn't top the muffins since I had no nuts and only 1/2 cup brown sugar (will try next time)...I also used extra virgin organic coconut for the oil...They were not dry in any way...My verdict? The muffins were tasty but definitely could have benefited from the brown sugar/nut topping...

The muffins were very dense and heavy.  I followed the suggestions of adding vanilla and cinnamon and using 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce but there was still very little flavour and the muffins were so heavy I didn't receive any positive responses in our house.

Very good. I would add more brown sugar next time I think. I don't know if my pecans were bad, or if I didn't mix well, but I had some bitter bites. Might prefer butter to oil also. Maybe some apple sauce replacing part of the oil.

I liked these, baked really well.  I sprinkled cinnamon on top and I don't like the taste of the oil, so used butter instead.   

Follow the recipe and they'll turn out  - really easy.

These muffins were SO good!! I make them very frequently-sometimes every other weekend. They are very delicious. I do not put the pecans in because I prefer not to have pecans. They are delicious all the same!!

This is a great recipe. All I did was change out the oil to butter and add 1 tsp of vanilla. Really good flavour. My kids loved them and the oatmeal added a bit of crunch. We didn't do the brown sugar topping at all, but I don't think they need it. Just an afterthought, we made mini muffins and they didn't rise very much, but they are tasty all the same.

I just tried these muffins for the first time and wish I had read the reviews beforehand. They were easy to prepare but I taste baking powder and salt... If I make these again I will most definitely cut back on the baking powder and salt quantities.

These were oddly great! They had a little too much salt. Next time I'll add a little of regular sugar an vanilla.  Not quit sweet enough.

Made these yesterday and read reviews. The only thing I added was 2 tsp. vanilla and omitted the nuts. Mine were not dry because I pulled them out at 18 min. and let them sit for 5 before taking them out of the pan.  Everyone loved them. Thank you.

I made these muffins last night and I must say that I am quite pleased! I had to make them gluten free due to allergies, but the texture still turned out great. I will agree with some other users that they might need a little extra sugar or chocolate chips ( I added extra chocolate chips) and I will probably add cinnamon and vanilla next time. Other things, such as raisins or other dried fruit, would also be delicious in these. Makes a perfect afternoon snack!

Baking powder... I just put these in the oven but when I tasted the batter I can really taste the baking powder. Crossing my fingers theybturn out. 4 tsp of baking powder seems like a lot! Is that right? Anyone please let me know thanks

Excellent. Did follow other suggestions and added 2 tsp vanilla. Also added a luttke cinnamon and all spice to the batter. Also used the mini chips. These were delish. Be sure to spray your liners to prevent sticking!

These muffins are amazing! I didn't have regular instant oatmeal, so I used apples & cinnamon. Due to my oatmeal selection, I had to omit the chocolate. Instead, I grated an apple and used that. I read that another baker used applesauce in place of oil; I wasn't that adventurous, but I used half oil and half applesauce. I added a dash of cinnamon, and followed everything else to the "t". They came out great!

These are great for my son to take to school. Being a no nut school I don't add any nuts. This recipe also makes 4 dozen mini muffins. I do not add the extra brown sugar as it tends to want to burn easier.

These are good; not great.  I will have to try some modifications that others have suggested to add more flavour.  I did add a tsp of vanilla and even then they weren't as flavourful as the premixed store bought packages - which is what I am trying to get away from.

These muffins came out tender and delicious!
I made a few changes..one cup of the flour was whole wheat, a bit of the quick oats were replaced with oat bran, I used mini chips, and walnuts.
I used muffin cup liners.  The muffins rose beautifully.
Yum..definitely a keeper recipe!

I substituted applesauce for oil, 1:1, and they are great! I also subbed the pecans for raisins! Thank you for an easy recipe!

Good as is, perhaps a little dense, but still a good, filling muffin.  After trying the original recipe, I made it with white chocolate chips (instead of semi-sweet) and walnuts (instead of pecans), whole wheat flour (instead of all-purpose), and I added 3/4 cup of dried cranberries.  Really, really, really good.

Muffins are great!  No issues with being dry.  When trying a new recipe I always make it as it calls for.  They turned out to be very tasty. The second time I added Vanilla for fun.  Still Fab!  They make a great snack for school if you omit the nuts.

In spite of my hurry and failure to read the directions all the way through before starting, these turned out very tasty and were gobbled up by all my boys, with requests for third and fourth muffins.  They said it was like eating a chocolate chip cookie for breakfast.

I doubled the recipe and used a whole bag of chocolate chips (12oz) and added 2t. vanilla, but I also (accidentally) didn't divide the brown sugar and chopped pecans so all of it went into the batter instead of half on top.  I used about 1.5 cups of very finely chopped pecans, which seemed to go unnoticed with the texture of the oatmeal, which is a good thing in our house.  A double recipe (with my mistakes) made about 32 muffins.

I just made these this morning, and they were pretty good, different from other muffins ive made. I did get 16 muffins. i dont like to change a recipe when i try it for the first time, but i did replace all the oil with applesauce, because thats what ive always have done with muffins. also, i didnt have pecans, so i just add a few more chocolate chips. Oh and i added vanilla (i add that to all my baking too). The flavour was yummy, found it a bit on the chewy side,(i may have over stirred). But all in all i will be making these again. I would like to try adding some apple and cinnamon, instead of the chocolate next time.

I just made these muffins tonight, they are absolutely amazing.  When I shared the recipe with my boyfriend he thought it sounded a little weird, after one bite we've decided these muffins will be made many more times.  I wouldn't change a thing!

I accidentally assumed there was banana in this.  (It was what I googled when this recipe popped up.)I had my bananas mashed so subbed part of the milk and oil with banana.  Yummy.

This is really good and I use it as a "base" recipe. I use 1 cup of kefir in place of 1 cup of the milk. I use grape seed oil instead of vegetable oil. I also use whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose flour. Everything still works perfectly with this recipe. I consider a recipe great when it can handle substitutions and this one fit the bill. Also, I can go crazy with mix ins and everything still turns out wonderful (I like to add dried cranberries, raisins, and dried blueberries). I have also used canned crush pineapple as well (about 1/4 cup). Really good base that allows you to have a lot of fun with this recipe.

This recipe is pretty good. Although, do not put it 20 minutes. It will burn or at least lower heat once inserted in the oven. I love how they mix the milk with the oats first. Very Good!

I actually forgot to add the 1/2 cup oil and the muffins still turned out great!!!  Will try with the oil next time. I did increase the sugar to 1 cup, substituted white for brown and added 1 tsp vanilla. I only had old fashioned oats so I buzzed them in the blender a few times before soaking in the milk.

These are delicious!  I added vanilla as previous reviewers suggested and substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce.  These were terrific and I will make them again - soon!  Next time I am going to substitue all the oil with applesauce for a healthier version.  I had borrowed out my muffin pans and forgot so all I had was my mini-muffin pans.  I cut baking time to 12 minutes and they were great!  This recipe is a keeper!  :)

I added some cocoa, white sugar and unsweetened coconut, and the muffins turned out rich, moist and super chocolate-y, almost like macaroons.

Delicious!!!  My whole family loved them--even my picky 4 year old!!  I used cake flour (so added 1 tsp. baking soda).  I also added 2 tsp. real vanilla and used walnuts instead of pecans.  I only had old-fashioned oats, so I soaked them for 30 minutes instead of 15.  I did not add the sugar/nut topping.  They were done after 16 minutes in my oven, so watch the time.  Will definitely use this again.

I really really wanted to like these. As others have said the baking powder and the salt seemed really high so I cut them each in half and added some vanilla. The only other change was subbing 1/2 the oil for applesauce in an attempt to feel less guilty about giving my kids chocolate chips for breakfast. These still had a very metallic-y after taste which I can only assume was the baking powder. The kids didn't complain but there are many other recipes on here that don't require so much tweaking and stand well on their own.

The first time I made these I tried microwaving the oats and milk as one user suggested but then my chocolate chips melted.  The second time I ground my oatmeal in a food processor and it worked great!  These were delicious!

Love this recipe. Super easy & super fast. I changed to pecans to walnuts & the oil to apple sauce. Added 2 over ripe bananas & an extra 1/4 cup flour. I also put them in a mini muffin tin & reduced cook time to about 10 minutes. My hubby & I love them & so do my 2 & 3 year old. 
I would try added vanilla next time as some reviewers recommended. I think that would make them perfect.

I made a few adjustments [because of my own tastes - not because there's anything wrong with this recipe]. I used applesauce instead of oil, raisins instead of pecans and nearly doubled the chocolate chips [I love them, what can I say] and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of vanilla extract. I haven't eaten one yet [they're in the oven now] but I can tell you that they look and smell phenomenal!
Thanks for posting this recipe!

very good!  used mini chips and didn't put topping on them... used 3/4 cup brown sugar only in the mix.  Used extra mini chips.  Moist and hearty, not too sweet!  Kids liked them too!  I also used nut topping for the pecans.

These are great - only problem was that it came out too salty when followed to the letter. Salt can be decreased to the usual 1/4 teaspoon instead of 1 tsp as the recipe calls. otherwise, they're fantastic! my mom loves them, and they're healthy, especially when used with wheat flour. the pecans add a nice extra texture to the muffin. the oats cooked perfectly at 20 minutes.

I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews so I added a 2nd egg and vanilla. I was in a hurry and accidentily added all of the brown sugar to the batter instead of saving some for the top. Instead of baking as muffins I baked the recipe as two small loafs. It was wonderful. Everyone loved it even my picky neighbourhood kids. :)

These muffins were a healthy and delicious treat! I followed the recipe completely, but I omitted the pecans and added cranberry's instead. Also, I added 1tsp of vanilla for more flavor and then I took the lead from another reviewer and did 1/2 cup wheat flour with 1 1/4 cup all purpose flour. They turned out great!

A few changes I made: I used 1/3 a cup of sunflower seeds as I didn't have chopped pecans or anything else.  I have a feeling the pecans would be ideal, but the sunflower seeds aren't bad!  Also, I made it as a cake instead of muffins and just kept a close eye on it while it baked. This recipe is simple and it is delicious!

Easy recipe, nice results. I found allowing the batter to sit for a while produces fluffier muffins if that's what you like. My batter yielded 17 muffins, baked 20 mins, and added 1T vanilla. Four stars because I felt the batter cannot stand alone, it definitely needs the chips and sugar on top to make it tasty. Next time will try the suggestion of adding cinnamon.

I had high expectations for these muffins as per the reviews. I followed the recipe but did opt to change the oil to applesauce and put the first batch in the oven in a greased muffin dish. They came out but were too overcooked on the bottom and just right in the middle. I then tried the second batch in paper muffin cups and they stick to the paper. I don't think I will make them again.

I made these according to the recipe (except omitted the sugar topping), and though they were a little dry, they had great flavor (and personally, I enjoyed a the crumbliness).  I will make these again.

These are great muffins. I made a batch and took them to a family member for snacks and they loved them and wanted to recipe so I told them to come here and look. The next time I make these I will leave out about 1/4 cup of liquid because I found that they were a little moist for my liking but really yummy

These were easy and yummy.  I didn't have any quick-cooking oats, so used old fashioned and they still turned out great.  My guess is that they were more chewy because of the old fashioned oats.  I soaked the oats 15 minutes and followed the recipe except for the fact I added a splash of vanilla to the oatmeal/milk/egg/oil mixture (because I do this with all baked goods.)  I also left off the brown sugar topping to save some calories.  Delicious.  My kids loved them as well.

Excellent! Very moist and tasty. I used half ww flour, almond milk and used ground flax instead of eggs. I also took advice from others and added vanilla. I omitted the sugar/pecan topping and they were great!

These were delicious! I doubled the recipe, and decreaed the oil by about 1/3 a cup - turned out fine. I also added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract. Just the right amount of chocolate chips, and the oats give the best texture! I gave them to some people and they asked for more! The only thing I didn't do were the pecans. They would have been too much. These would be great with blueberries too if you like them.

**Modified recipe** - Used Vanilla almond milk instead of cows milk, cranberry applesauce instead of oil, used white chocolate chips & walnuts because I didn't have pecans. Muffins stuck to paper cups - suggest not using them - wasted 1/2 muffin. Good flavour - very moist however not my fave recipe, may keep looking for another one.

These are awesome!  Here's what I did:  I mixed the oatmeal and all the wet ingred plus brown sugar and tsp vanilla in a glass measuring cup, stirring to dissolve the sugar and mix the oil.  Then I put the the dry ones in a large mixing bowl, added tsp cinnamon.  I tossed the wet ingred in with the dry ones and mixed well.  Instead of the nuts I put in sweetened shredded coconut which I blended in with the chocolate chips.  Our family loves these!

These were very tasty, but I did follow some of the adjustments as suggested by other reviewers.  I intended to add chocolate chips, but didn't end up having any...someone must have snacked on them!  Instead, I added dried cranberries, as they're a favorite around here!  I also added applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil in the recipe.  These were moist and yummy!!  Such a good, basic recipe that you can make unique with whatever your family loves!

Good muffins but if you add the brown sugar/nuts to the top and bake it will burn the sugar!!  Add the toppings when there is about 3 mins left!!  Great recipe though...thanks!

I made these to take to my daughter's swim meet for snacks.  They went over very well with the team.  I would say they were great the day that I made them and the day after that, but after that, they did become a little dried out.  Right out of the oven, with the gooey chocolate chips, they were the best.

My family LOVES this recipe!  They are hardy, filling, moist, and yummy!  There's been a bunch of times that I forgot to separate the brown sugar and put the whole amount in the muffins and they still turned out good.  I also leave out the pecans when I don't have any on hand.

Made these with my 2.5 year old today.  We used applesauce instead of oil, didn't add pecans, didn't do a topping, and microwaved the oats and milk for 4 minutes on very low power instead of letting them soak for 15.  I also added a little vanilla extract and cinammon.  Turned out quite well.  Very filling and my daughter loves them.  Next time I might try cooking them at a slightly lower temperature.

YUMMY!   I made this recipe with butter instead, because Mama always told me to use butter!  I also used 1/2 buckwheat flour, added ground flax seeds, and used 1 tsp cream of tartar and 2 tsp baking soda.  These were SO good, and when covered with foil, did not go stale after 5 days.  I'm suprised they lasted that long.

followed the recipie as writen.  The bater is very loose, thought i messed them up, but they came out very good.  The topping is very tasty!!:)  the onlything i did not like was the oatmeal gave the muffins a funny texture, but over all the whole family loved them.  I will make them again.

The muffins were a big hit with my family. I substituted all purpose flour with whole wheat flour and doubled the quantity of chocolate chips. The muffins were very moist and a breeze to bake.

I added 1 TBSP vital wheat gluten, which made them very light.  Also used about 1/4 cup whole milk and then 1 cup water, just because I ran out of milk.  Substitued about 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for some of the white flour. Couldn't even tell these were made with oats.

These were YUM-O!!  I used old fashioned oats and soaked them in the milk overnight.  This made quite a bit more than 12 regular muffins.  I didn't follow the instructions and added all the brown sugar in the muffins and also added some vanilla.  These were nice and moist and suprisingly not too sweet.  I didn't have any pecans so we went nutless, but I'll definitely make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

These were amazing. If you know when to add, when to stir, when to soak, etc, these will turn out fantastic. If these muffins turned out poorly for you, one of your ingredients was likely lackluster or you did not make them correctly. If you're afraid it will be dry, add a little fat-free sour cream and they will be more moist than you even bargained for.

Yummy!  I did tweak them a bit, but I don't think it impacted the result: I used walnuts instead of pecans, added 1/2 cup of diced apple, 1 tbsp of flaxseeds, and used butter instead of the oil.  I'm on my fourth one already...

Okay, I ate THREE of these delicious muffins yesterday and had to stop myself from eating more! Only one so far today and plan to keep it that way. Anyway, READ the reviews first. I gave this recipe 4 stars because it definitely needed tweaking.  I added 1t of vanilla, 1/2 t or so of cin, MINI choc chips and I lowered the heat by 5 degrees and cooked 5 mins less that what the recipe called for. )just keep an eye on them - all oven are different) Also, when they were almost cool, I covered the pan in FOIL and that "locked in the freshness". One thing I will do different is use whole milk instead of 2% - that was all I had and I would maybe add a large jar (stage 3?) of baby food - banana or apple sauce. It definitely needs moisture, but I did a pretty good job with what I changed and how I wrapped them up before they cooled off. My son has been enjoying these for breakfast with a blueberry/banana/yogurt smoothie - mmm mmm! Thanks for the great recipe! SOOOOO good with COFFEE!

Nice- no nuts, extra oats. These were not too sweet, but still flavorful. Added some vanilla and cinnamon. Would make again.

Really nice muffin!  Not too sweet as it's written.  I omitted the pecans and didn't sprinkle the extra brown sugar on top, but besides that I followed the recipe exactly.  Made mini muffins for the kids and the baking time at 400 was 14 minutes.

Good, but the oatmeal comes off as mealy after the first 5-stuffed in my mouth. Could maybe have used a little less oatmeal for a better result.

I thought these muffins were great! I followed the recipe but used walnuts instead of pecans. They weren't too sweet or too hearty nor were they bland. Although not exceedingly moist, they were by no means dry and I was quite pleased that they made exactly the amount they were supposed to. I have removable silicone muffin cups which made them easy to remove, but if you don't I would use paper so they don't stick.

These muffins were delicious!  I used chopped walnuts instead of pecans.  I also did not put any brown sugar/nuts on top, instead just put it into the batter.  Turned out moist.  I will definitely make these again!

Great recipe! The inside was so moist while the outside was just slightly crispy. Very tasty! I did add a touch of vanilla even though it didn't call for it. I think it made it even tastier!

These were outstanding.  I made as directed, aside from a couple small changes: I had no nuts, so I added white chocolate chips instead.  I also used mini chocolate chips, which I usually do for muffins anyway; they mix far better than the regular sized ones, which tend to sink in the batter while cooking.  For a little extra boost I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon.  Delicious!  The outside has a nice crunch and the inside is moist and perfectly flavorful.  I will definitely be making these again!

Great muffin! Very moist and flavorful. I used whole wheat flour, omitted pecans (didn't have them on hand), added 1 and 1/2 tsp vanilla, added 1 tbsp butter and had to substitute vanilla soy milk since I was out of regular milk. I also had to add peanut butter chips since I didn't have a whole lot of chocolate ones left and it still turned out good, just probably not as good had they been just chocolate chipped. I will definitely make again!

This was GREAT!!! I made the batch exactly as it said and instead of 12 muffins, I got 16. I did add raisins to half of the batch. They came out better than I expected. This is recipe is great for part of your breakfast or a snack. This was very easy and moist.

I just made this and it is so wonderful!!! It was very moist and fluffy! I decreased the oil by 1/4 cup and also decreased the flour by 1/4 cup and used skim milk and added a toffee bits to it. So wonderful!!!!! I did not have any pecans so I omitted those. This was an excellent recipe. Thank you!!

Running back and forth to my laptop to check the recipe while my 4year old talked non-stop and my two year old banged my metal measuring cups together caused me to inadvertantly make these a high sugar low sodium recipe. :)  I accidentally added all the brown sugar to the mix and forgot the salt.   Somehow these came and fine!  Can't wait to make these with some peace and quiet!

My family loved these muffins.  They were really moist and tasty.  I did not use pecans, and did not do the crumb topping (have a 2 and 5 year old...less messy this way) and just mixed all the sugar into the mixture.  Will definitaly make again :)

this was tasty, but not quite 5 stars. I omit the nuts as my family isnt nut fans, and I added cinnamin and a caramel sprinkle to the tops. Glad I did as they gave it a nice flavor. Would make again as they were quick and easy and I always have all the ingredients in my house, but they were not spectacular. I only baked them for 18 minutes...and my oven doesnt seem to run hot or other recipes I dont usually need to adjust time.

I was iffy about this at first and thought it might be bland and heavy. They were so good! Filling but not heavy and very flavorful and plenty moist. I want to try them with fruit instead of chocolate chips next time!

Really good.  Substituted applesauce for the oil and added a tsp of vanilla.  Left out the pecans, put in 1 c. chocolate chips and a handful of craisins (the rest of the bag from our cabinet).  Delicious!

Great recipe. Substituted blackberries for the chocolate chips and used a mix of whole wheat and all-purpose flour. Quick and easy recipe that I'll be experimenting with some more.

These are the best muffins I have ever made, I think.  The pecans add so much, and the crumble on top is delicious!

excellent muffins! thanks!  The only problem I had is with the cooking time- 20 mins is too long for my oven- not necessarily a recipe problem. Even slightly burnt, they were great!

It's def. hearty muffin.  It's not very sweet which is nice.  I added vanilla to add some flavor to the batter of the muffin.  I also used walnuts instead of pecans because that is what I had on hand and it worked well.  I think next time I make this I will add almond extract rather than vanilla.

The incredible disappearing muffin. Fabulous. Used a tad less oil, added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and didn't put the pecans and sugar on top. Didn't really need it.

Great muffins! My husband and I really like chocolate chip muffins - we usually use a mix, but the oatmeal added a nice touch and was really easy. I definitely plan to make these again!

I've made these 3 times in the last 4 weeks they are so good.   I don't bother with the top coat and just add more chocolate to the muffins. If i think the batter is too thick I add a small amount of water and it seams to really help.

Very good muffins, although not warm out of the oven. Wait until they've cooled. I used 3/4 WW pastry flour with 1/2 c AP flour, and didn't add pecans to batter, only used in topping. I got 12 standard and 16 mini muffins. I really like these today, but can't seem to get my kids to eat them for some reason. Will probably make again, but just didn't think they were crazy incredible.

Excellent muffin!  My family absolutely loved them.  The description of "hearty breakfast muffin" is perfect.  My 25 year old daughter even commented, "This is a really good, hearty muffin!"  The only thing I changed was that I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet (just because that's what I had on hand).

Yum Yum Yum!  These were wonderful.  Few changes:  Used 1C AP Flour and 1/4C Whole Wheat Flour, 1/4C Oil and 1/2C Apple Sauce, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, AND DOUBLED the Chocolate Chips.  Mmmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm Good!

Overall I would say this is a neutral breakfast muffin. I had my roommate try them and she said that there was no distinct flavor. She said of my baking it's not her favorite. I did modify based on other people's reviews. I added 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt, dash of cinnamon, tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup cocoa because I only had about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I don't think the cocoa did anything for the flavor. The overall consistency was moist. I think the muffin lived up to its description as a "hearty breakfast muffin." I think next time I will either add 1 cup of mini-chocolate chips or raisins and honey. I've made oatmeal muffins before with honey which my friends really liked.

These were great! And a real "spring board" for changing up the taste if you would like... I doubled the recipe, but only used the 1/2 c of oil, added vanilla and cinnamon, and used half whole wheat flour and half white, also used walnuts instead of pecans (what was in the cupboard:)). They were fabulous. It also yielded 3 dozen muffins. I put no "topping" on half of them (less messy for the kids( and they were still great. For the ones with the topping, I crushed some walnuts and added brown sugar and cinnamon, then sprinkled on before baking. I think I will play with flavors next time...maybe shedd some carrots with walnuts, cinnamon and add nutmeg, and maybe another kind with some banana, walnuts and cinnamon... I really like the heartiness of them with the whole wheat in them for breakfast or snack for the kids. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is amazing!! I hopped in the shower real quick right after I put them in the oven and asked my fiance to keep an eye on them. By the time I got out of the shower, they were done, out of the oven, and 2 were already gone!!  These were my only small changes. I let the oatmeal and milk sit for 20-25 minutes, added a teaspoon of vanilla and cut the salt done to 3/4 a teaspoon. They baked for 20 minutes and turned out beautifully. As I type this my fiance is eating another one!! Time to go hide them!!

super delicious.  subbed almonds for the pecans- chocolate and almonds are a favorite flavor combo in my family, and applesauce for the oil.  also used old fashioned oats- those are all i buy and they can be interchanged with quick cooking oats in any recipe.  excellent results.  highly recommend this muffin! also, i noticed that a couple people complained that they didn't rise very well.  the problem is your baking powder.  it is expired.  toss it and buy a new can.

I must not have been paying close attention to the recipe when I made these, because I mixed all of the brown sugar and nuts into the batter and left none for topping. I also forgot to put an egg in.  So my muffins were eggless and had no topping, but they still tasted very good. The oatmeal makes them a hearty, filling, breakfast.

My kids love these!  I leave out the nuts (kids don't like them) and replace 1/4c white flour with 1/4c wheat flour, which adds some nutrients, gives it great texture and flavor and they still rise light and fluffy. Yummy!

Made a double batch of these for my son's preschool Valentine's Day party.  No nuts because of allergic kids, but the muffins were fine without them.  I used old fashioned oats and plain soy milk because that's what I had in the house and sprinkled some cinnamon into the batter as well.  The brown sugar on top was a nice touch.  These were a hit with adults and kids alike.  Delicious!

I made these for my Valentine this morning. He loved them with his coffee! I thought it was a bit too salty, so I might cut back to 3/4 of the salt next time. I omitted the pecans and they still tasted great. And I did a WW flour and plain flour combination that yielded a healthier tasting muffin. I didn't have applesauce, but if I did, I would have omitted some of the oil and used applesauce to cut down on fat. Overall- quick and easy recipe that I will make again!

Made according to directions, but omitted pecans.  Nice hearty muffins.  Next time I will add some cinnamon, which I think is what they need to get a 5 star rating in my book.

I made them three times. They are light, fluffy and yummy. I followed the recipe. I did not made any changes. I took some to my boss who is australian, she loved them and I have given some to my friends as a gift. They asked me for the recipe.
thank you for this recipe. It is my husband's favorite.
Will do them again and again.

These were very good, but they seemed to crumble, diffidently putting the 2nd batch (it made about 16 for me) into the paper holders helped, not only with the mess but the crumble

These muffins are really good. However, I followed what other people said about replacing the pecans with chocolate chips.  I'm a true chocoholic but with ALL those chocolate chips, it was a little too much.  next time I'll put in 1 cup choc. chips MAX! Other than that, these are really tasty, and I love the brown sugar on top.  I also substituted oil for Applesauce.  I really like this recipe and I'm gonna keep making it till i find a way that is PERFECT!  They are close though.

Yummy! I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil, added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I omitted the nuts and added a few more chocolate chips. These were moist and delicious and the crust was sort of chewy and wonderful. Good muffin!

This recipe was delicious. Because many other reviewers commented on how the recipe was bland, I decided to add 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. My muffins weren't crumbly like other reviews (which was probably due to not letting the oats sit in the milk long enough), but instead the muffins were nice and moist. I also used cake flour instead so the muffins were extra fluffy. My muffins didn't rise though, for some reason, but still the taste was good.

This recipe was awesome!I added about 3/4 cup of shredded raw coconut and 2 tsps of vanilla to the batter and then the brown sugar reserved for topping I mixed with more of the raw coconut. This turned out awesome, I will definately hold this one in my recipe box...Thanks!!!

These muffins taste great - but are a bit messy to eat because they are kind of crumbly.

very good and not too sweet. I shared with friends and they were a hit!  Just a little dry, that's why the four stars.

I don't usually like chocolate chip muffins, but I had a request for some from a lady at work.  I had to try one of course and was very pleasantly surprised. I ate a couple the next morning and just as good. I didn't quite follow the recipe exactly by accident.  I mixed the milk and oatmeal just like it said, but the other ingredients I just mixed all together at one time. Didn't seem to affect the taste/quality as far as I could tell. I think me saying "oatmeal" when unveiling the muffins turned a lot of people off.  When the muffins are all cooked, you can't even tell there is oatmeal in it.  So if you have picky eaters just "forget" to mention the presence of oatmeal! I only gave it 4 stars because I just don't like chocolate chip muffin- no offense to the recipe. :) Enjoy!

One of the yummiest muffins I've ever made.  Not too cupcakey, either!  The brown sugar and pecans made this delicious carmelized crust on top.  More of a muffin for grown ups than kids.

These were quite tasty and I liked their texture--I accidentally used 1 1/2 cups oats (and old-fashioned, not quick), so I cut down the flour to 1 cup. They are a little grainy, but in a nice "chewy" way! Incidentally, I always use King Arthur white whole wheat in my muffins to add some nutrition and it doesn't seem to affect them taste-wise. I also reduced the salt as others had suggested.

Excellent, they got eaten up!  I like to split my muffins in half and melt butter on em, but this wasn't happening as they DO fall apart easily.  Tasted great though.

Simple and fast and tasty. I omitted the nuts and used the same amount of wheat germ instead, which upped the fiber and still gave a bit of a nutty crunch and texture. I also skipped the topping. Next time, I would also reduce the salt slightly (as others have suggested) and perhaps use half choc chips and half raisins or dried cranberries.

Good muffins :) A little crumbly for my purpose though - I made them for an early flight but I think that by the time I get on the plane they're all going to be a million tiny pieces. Doesn't mean they don't still taste great though ;)

Perfect!  These came out light and tender.  It also made a ton.  I omitted the nuts as they were for my son's preschool class and a doubled recipe made 2 dozen regular and 2 dozen mini muffins.

Great base recipe if you make changes like others have suggested.  I used 1/4 c. applesauce & 1/4 c. oil, added 1 tsp. vanilla, cut the baking powder to 2 tsp, and omitted the nuts and topping all together.  They turned out wonderfully and were a big hit!

1) I would add a little more choc chips, we like them!! 2) Spray the pan good, anything that touch it burned! 3) Next time I will omit the brown sugar on top. My kids thought it was burned when only the top was darker becasue of the brown sugar. Overall, a wonderful muffin. We will make again!

These muffins are awesome for breakfast.  I cut the baking powder down to 2 tsp & used half oil, half applesauce.  I also used half sugar, half Splenda.  My kids really like these.  They are moist and chewy.

I wasn't thrilled with these, but my husband quite likes them.  I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 white flour, and added 1/4 cup ground flax seeds.  Muffins are very dense.  Topped these with some brown sugar before baking, but I don't think it's necessary - I would skip adding it next time.

These muffins are AWESOME!  They aren't as sweet as some muffins out there, but because they aren't so sweet I don't feel bad about eating them for breakfast!  Only thing I changed was I substituted applesauce for the oil (I always do that) and I added some vanilla extract.  Also, I only had regular old fashioned oats and so I ground them a little in the blender then soaked them.  Came out great!  This one is definitely a keeper!

These muffins were moist, sweet and had a great texture(thanks to the oatmeal I suppose). I don't know how some reviwers seemed to think they weren't sweet enough.

I reduced the vegetable oil to 100ml(instead of 120),just to make them healtier, and they weren't dry at all.

Thanks for sharing.

I love these muffins!  They came out moist and tasted so good, not to mention smelled heavenly while baking.  I did modify it a bit: I reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp after reading other reviews, I omitted pecans because I don't like them, and I didn't top the muffins with brown sugar.  And all I had on hand was packets of instant oatmeal, so I just used that, it's probably the same as quick cooking oats?  Definitely a keeper, thanks!

I was looking for a good muffin recipe with oats in it and this one was terrific!  I reduced the Baking Powder to 3tsp. and added a little Splenda to the mix for added sweetness without the calories.  Delicious! I will definitely make these again.

I just made this last night.  I did omit the pecans, because the kids do not like them.  They came out perfect.  And the taste is really good, not too sweet as I was expecting.  Wonderful recipe that is sure to become one of my family's favorites!

What an amazing recipe! ok, everyone was right about the baking powder, it must have been a mistake, but this is definately a family favorite. I added a dash of cinnamon, and the second time around i used juice instead of milk and it came out just fine (slightly more moist). Great recipe.

Very delicious! I didn't use pecans, and they were still great. In addition to the brown sugar, I sprinkled some chocolate chips on top of each cup. Turned out wonderful!!

I really liked these. Not overly sweet, but satisfying. This is quick & easy to get into the oven too. Next time I would add a teaspoon of (mexican) vanilla. I did follow someone's suggestion of just putting brown sugar on top. I also substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour for regular all purpose for added health benefit and it worked fine for us. I give it 4 stars as my kids ate them but didn't gobble them up. But I will make these again and instead of store bought mixes in the future! Thanks Kari for this one!

Lovely light breakfast muffin. I tweaked it a little by replacing the milk with orange juice as well as using apple sauce instad of the oil. I will definately be making these again.

These muffins were wonderful! I doubled the batter and it made many more than 2 dozen. The muffins were very soft and flavorful. Excellent recipe

Very good and easy to make!  The kids loved them.  These are definitely a keeper!  I left out the Pecans(the kids don't like them) and it still turned out wonderful.  I just sprinkled brown sugar on the tops instead of the brown sugar/pecan mixture.  Turned out delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing this yummy recipe!

Double the recipe if you're smart!  And freeze the leftovers in a freezer bag so you can take out as many as you want at a time.  Took them to a golf outing and got rave reviews!

These were very good and stayed nice and moist when I put them in Tupperware.  After a week I heated one and topped with a bit of peanut butter, and it couldnt' have tasted better.  Really very delicious.  The only change I made was to add more chocolate chips then called for b/c I am a huge chocolate fan.

This was a great muffin recipe. I used part spelt flour with the all purpose, and the flavor was hearty and delicious. This one I will make again.

A very good muffin!  I used mini chocolate chips instead.  Didn't put the topping on and they still tasted great!
