I can see how these will be absolutely fantastic when I chill them, however, ERMA these were so unbelievable just cooled!!!! I'm not a big macaroon person, but these little guys tasted like coconut haystack candies. Wonderful and thanks for a yummy cookie!

I made these for Easter. I put them in 12 sprayed muffin cups, to create a basket shape by pressing out the middle with a teaspoon. Just before they were done, I took them out of the oven, pressed in the middle again, and put them back in for a few minutes. I cooled them in the freezer before I took them out of the pan. Each basket held 2 chocolate foil-wrapped eggs. For decoration I put a few marshmallow 'chickens' on the plate. They look pretty good, and I'm wondering how to use this trick for something other than Easter. The taste was 5 star, and I'll make these as little cookies any time.

Great Cookie!  My husband loved it.  Word to the wise....lightly spray your cookie sheet with a cooking spray before dropping...it makes it much easier!  Thanks!

These were good, but almost too sweet. I used sweetened flaked coconut - next time I'll try unsweetened. The texture, presentation & ease of recipe was great though.

these are great! i baked them on parchment paper so they didn't stick. if you don't feel like melting the chocolate, they're just as good if you use mini chocolate chips and just fold them in.

I loved these!  I didn't have any walnuts and don't really like them so I left them out.  I threw the baking sheets in the freezer after they came out the oven and it helped the macaroons to keep their shape.

These are the greatest macaroons --nice & chewy.  I cooked them for just 10 minutes (v. 12) to keep them soft.  My family raved; everyone asked for recipe.  Keeping them in refrigerator prior to serving makes them even better.

These are fantastic! So simple but the result is delicious. As for the people complaining of a runny batter, I'm guessing the egg whites weren't whipped enough. After adding the sugar they should get glossy and white, but you still have to whip them more. When you pull your beater up and you see the whites standing up on their own, they're done.

Next time I'll use unsweetened coconut, 1 1/4 cups of choc chips (maybe even dark choc) and about 1/3 cup of sugar.  

I used a teaspoon to scoop and another teaspoon to drop onto pan so no mess.

To get your egg whites to peak, use a cold and super clean metal mixing bowl.  I put my bowl and beaters in the fridge to chill before using.  The bowl cannot have any oil reside on it otherwise it will affect the egg whites.

delicious! Used unsweetened coconut and chocolate, but ended up adding more sugar. Very forgiving recipe - mixed all the dry ingredients before realizing I shouldn't... Whoops... But we managed by beating the egg whites with extra sugar and salt.

This is the first Macaroon recipe I've ever tried and I was very pleased with the results. Since I had SWEETENED coconut, I used only 1/4 c of sugar as per a previous review, and I used only 1 c of semisweet chocolate chips. The macaroons baked up "tall", not flat which is what I was worried about esp after seeing the consistency in the mixing bowl. These macaroons came out perfect :) For half the batch, I sprinkled the tops with extra coconut before baking, which gave it that "finished" look. Next time, I will try omitting the chocolate altogether so the coconut flavour can really shine - hmm, maybe I use coconut extract instead of vanilla. We'll see :P

Cookies were too sweet and the texture was odd. Not a huge fan, and I don't think I'll make em' again.

These were wonderful!!!  I've been looking for a good chocolate macaroon that doesn't turn out like a rock!  These are chewy, just like a macaroon should be.  Thanks for sharing!!

If these are "best served cold" then they must be HEAVENLY...because mine just came out of the oven and I CAN'T STOP EATING them!  No need to change a thing, these are delicious!!!  I used the foil on my cookie sheet as suggested, buttered it and cleanup was a cinch!  These taste like a cross between a no bake oatmeal cookie and a macaroon...light  and chewy and chocolately with a lot of texture.

Awesome recipe! I left out the walnuts, my family is not a big fan of nuts, and instead I added a little bit more coconut, and they were really yummy! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I would have given these four and a half if I could, they are really good, nice and sweet and chewy but mine spread a lot which took away from the chewiness. I will definitely be making them again though.

So easy so delicious!!! Incredibly sweet - I should have used unsweetened coconut. Hershey chipits made the chocolate flavour amazing. I made them too big so came out like cookies but still delicious -a perfect gluten-free cookie alternative!

I've never made anything much like this, but they turned out great. They weren't all that great to look at (perhaps I could've taken some time to make them a bit more uniform in size and shape), but the taste was very nice. They are a bit delicate, though. I made the recipe exactly as written, and shared these at a meeting, and several people liked them. Worth recommending!

I love this recipe, I make them for Christmas as gifts. I have variations that include adding raisins, dried cranberries, toffee chips, or peanut butter chips. People love them, they are always the first to disappear from the goodie tray.

I didn't have parchment paper or a non-stick pan, but just oiling the pan before baking and waiting for these guys to completely cool before removing off the pan was fine. They came right off. Everyone loved these.

Wow!!! I toasted the walnuts which removed some of the bitterness. These were GREAT warm out of the oven, but did improve when chilled down. I don't know what size teaspoon was used to get 36 macaroons, I used a 1 ounce scoop and got about 15 2" cookies.

I am not a baker so my egg whites didn't peak like I wanted them to. They still turned out really yummy and soft and chocolatey.

An absolute favorite of friends and family, even the ones who "don't like coconut" or "don't like macaroons". They are definitely very sweet, but we seem to like that over here :)

I was hoping for a cookie that is like a store bought macaroon.  This cookie is more like a chocolate coconut meringue cookie.  Not what I was looking for.  Maybe if I added more coconut?  And I was confused by some of the pictures.  Some of them must have been taken before the cookie was baked.  It does have great taste, and I used parchment paper so didn't have any trouble with sticking.

I made these because 1) I had extra egg whites on hand and 2) my fiancé loves macaroons.  I am not a macaroon fan but these are amazing!  I suppose it's because I've only had store bought ones that I found to be fake tasting.  These are delicious.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use sweetened coconut or unsweetened, so I used about 1/2 and 1/2 and then put in about 1/2 the sugar too.  This is a definite keeper for me.

A new favorite receipe for me!! I loved, loved, loved these- made them friday and by friday night they were all gone!!! (mide you a forgot a tray in the oven and they were..... um.... a little crispy, so there was only 1/2 of the cookies to start with) but that still makes them a good cookie. They were rather easy to make and were delicious . Can't complain about that I just wish that sometimes I had an attention span that was better than a gold fish's.

Very easy, and tasty. I had to add some regular cocoa since I didn't have enough chocolate chips but still came out super. Not too sweet but enough to make any macaroon lover smile

Great recipe!  Certainly not the prettiest cookies in the world but they sure are tasty!  I used 4 oz unsweetened bakers chocolate instead of chocolate chips and 1/4 cup more sugar.  Turned out great!

I don't know what I did wrong, I followed the recipe exactly but they went flat like a pancake when cooked. They tasted good, although a little to sweet, but looked awful.

These are very interesting little cookies. I took advice from the other reviewers and put them in the freezer as soon as i took them out of the oven. I also put the left over raw mixture in the fridge as the cookies baked. This made dropping with a spoon very easy, not messy. My sister described them as "little Almond Joy cookies". Very tasty! If you are looking for variety in your cookies, definitely give this recipe a try!

I have to admit, I don't think I've made many recipes on here and followed them to a T, but I did this one.  This was sooo chewy and delicious!  Words of advice, don't omit the walnuts, bake for the recommended amount of time (otherwise they're too soft in the middle), and fluff fluff fluff those egg whites!!!!  I can't stress that enough!  Happy easter!

Excellent recipe! I reduced the recipe to make 12 macaroons instead of the original 36. Easy! Easy! Easy! I was a bit concerned because after 10 mins they were still gooey and seemed uncooked so i turned off the oven and let them sit another 2-3 minutes. I then transfered them to the fridge. They harden a bit which is good so they dont fall apart. Delicious! Much more chocolatey than coconuty...the coconut is really more for consistency. thanks for the recipe! They should be a hit at my seder tomorrow

MY HUSBAND & I LOVED THIS COOKIE!
HOWEVER,WITH THERE JUST BEING THE TWO OF US, I ONLY MADE 1/3 OF THE RECIPE. I WAS ALITTLE CONCERNED THAT IT WOULDN'T TURN OUT. BUT THEY WERE DELICIOUS. 
THANK YOU!!!!!

I made several macaroon recipes at the same time and these were by far the best.  I made them with pecans instead of walnuts.  

If you are making them for Passover, check the ingredients on your nuts since a lot of walnuts and pecans are preserved with corn oil, they are not kosher for passover so you might want to leave out the nuts.

I couldn't eat these because I'm allergic to egg whites but my husband loved them. Aren't macaroons supposed to look like little mounds though? Did I do something wrong? I know my oven wasn't too hot because I have an oven thermometer.  Doesn't really matter what they looked liked because they all got eaten.

I made this recipe for our girls annual cookie exchange at christmas.  I scaled it up to 15 dozen and omitted the walnuts(for people with allergies)increased the chocolate and coconut then stored them in the freezer until just prior to handing them out. They were very well loved by everybody. I will definately make these again next year

I make these for Passover and everyone raves about them.  They melt in your mouth.  I like to use almonds instead of coconut due to personal preference. I agree with another reviewer that spraying the cookie sheet before baking is helpful.  I also suggest letting them cool just a couple minutes on the sheet before removing them helps them keep their shape.

I dropped these on lightly greased waxed paper and didn't have any problems with them sticking. I first tried them cold from the fridge and they were horrible, I was ready to toss them out. The bitterness from the walnuts completely ruined them. (It may have been the walnuts I used) But I decided to see what happened if I brought them to room temperature before serving and they were fantastic, the bitterness had completely disappeared. So throughout the holidays, I stored them in the fridge and then took them out the night before serving. If I make them again I will omit the walnuts and add extra coconut.

Sweet, sweet, sweet! I made these in a pinch one late night when my husband and I were craving something sweet. A half gallon of milk and a tummy ache later, we could only eat 2 each. Much better cold. Next time, I'll probably play around with the sugar a bit. I get a toothache just thinking about them!

Don't be fooled by how these cookies look and feel.  They may seem really fragile  and light, but are wonderfully chewy and chocolatey.  I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts, and got good results.
The egg whites will require significant beating to form peaks, so use a stand mixer if you can.

I am glad I read the review that said to use unsweetened coconut and cut down on the sugar.  We did that, using 1/2 cup of sugar and they're delicious!  Will be making these again soon.

Excellent and easy cookie to make. I didn't melt mini chocolate chips but stirred in as last step. They tasted wonderful - like Almond Joys! Thanks for this recipe.

Simply delicious! I have in past made the NON cooked version, and THESE baked version are WAY better. They are chewy deliciousisness, goodies. Love them any way you can serve them. But my personal favorite is with Cool whip,.  A total hit with family and easy to make for a friend.

These were incredible! Way better than macaroons you'd buy at the store. My family and friends loved them and keep asking when I'm going to make them again. I froze half the batch and made them later; they turned out great too.

Excellent recipe! I used the trick someone else suggested of simply adding the chocolate chips (vs. melting them), and they turned out fabulous. I also had difficulty getting my egg whites to peak, but I just called it good when they had thickened considerably and they still turned out delish.  Once cooled on parchment paper, I had no trouble getting these off the pan, and they seemed to retain their shape great.

I made a couple changes and it was still great. I took the lazy way and used 2 whole eggs instead of 3 egg whites, and didn't whip to peaks, obviously. I also just added regular chocolate chips without melting, and almond slivers instead of walnuts. My family loved them, and I ate about 1/3 of them before I was done baking and cleaning up! Thanks for the recipe.

These are great and easy to make! Much richer than I expected but I love chocolate so I don't mind. Very different than any other macaroons i have had before.

Tried this cookie today and was great. I did not use the walnuts left them out. Everyone loved it, saying it tasted like a mounds candy bar! Will make again no doubt!

I think these are pretty close to ones my cousin usually makes.  The flavour was great (albeit very sweet, even with semisweet chocolate chips and unsweetened coconut).  I substituted large flake oats for the walnuts (some family members just don't like nuts).  Like others, I had a really hard time getting my egg whites and sugar to peak - any suggestions? I gave up and went with what I had, which was fine.  I ended up getting about 20 out of the recipe, and found that I had made my quite large as well....I will try and drop them much smaller next time.  The dropping process itself - so messy - they didn't really "drop" - not without a lot of assistance!

Really good.  I did not have walnuts, so I used almonds.  They still tasted great!

Not your typical macaroon.  Very chewy and not at all cake like.  I used milk chocolate because that was what I had, it made them too sweet.  Next time I will use semisweet.  I also put the cookie sheet in the refrigerator after baking, a must to help them keep their shape.

I had a hard time getting my egg whites to peak. Also, I wanted mine to taste like an Almond Joy, so I put them in a muffin pan and when they were done cooking topped with an almond M&M. They never really cooked through the center, only on the edges. Not my favorite sweet treat, but okay.

Ok so these are good but nothing spectacular. At first when everything was mixed it was easy to scoop them and put them on the cookie sheet. By the time the first batch was done in the oven the mixture had turned a little hard which made them harder to scoop up because they crumbled alot. I always thought chocolate macaroons where made with cocoa powder. Still good though.  UPDATE: I changed my rating to 3, :( after being in the fridge a few days they just become hard around the edges and hard chewy in the middle. They didn't get eaten, the kids didn't really like them, said they were too hard.

I accidentally used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet and sweetened coconut and just added less sugar.  Mine fell into flat cookies but they are still a new favorite.  Very yummy.

These cookies are great! I used sweetened coconut because that was all I had, but it made them too sweet.

Very chocolatey and delicious.  I did make some changes though.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, Dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet, and added an extra tsp of vanilla.  And as always, I bake on parchment paper which prevents sticking.  Thanks!

This was a HUGE hit at my seder.  I've already been asked to make more for an upcoming party.  They're like fudge, so you have to like rich chocolately cookies.
