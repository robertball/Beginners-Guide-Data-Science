I made this recipe for my family for dinner and they loved it! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used oregano instead of rosemary. I served with mixed vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli and carrots) and grilled steak. Delicious!

This was incredibly easy and incredibly delicious! I minced a couple cloves of garlic and minced a rib of celery for this one. I sauted the onion with the celery and garlic. For the rest of it I followed the directions. It was so filling and satisfying. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful and easy recipe!

Very good recipe. I think I would give it 4 stars though, but I feel to bad to ruin the 5 star streak. 
I used chicken broth instead of water and omitted the salt. Also added a handful of parmesan and a pinch of red pepper. Had to thin with a little extra milk at the end. 

The next day I added butternut squash puree just because I had it. yum.

YUMMY is all I have to say.  I can't keep left overs for this one.  I added 2 carrots chopped, oregano and garlic.  This was a great and quick recipe to have.

My wife just got done fixing this recipe, this has to be the some of the best potato soup I ever tasted, it was simple and great and what was nice is most will have all the ingredients on hand, my wife did and some garlic to the onions, will be making this over and over, I was suprised at the difference the rosemary and thyme made, try this, you will be adding it to your recipe box.

This soup was great but I had to add a little more liquid I found it real pasty.  I also added celery the second time I made it and it was even better!

Bravo! I too added celery, I just like it. The thyme is what made this good to me. I am proud of my potato soup but never thought of the thyme addition. Thanks.

Wow! This cooks up in a jiffy and tastes amazing. I ended up adding a little extra cheese since I am a sucker for the stuff. But Yes Highly recommended.

I love this recipe as written but I have also made it several other ways just for a change. I have added the celery, garlic and red pepper as other suggested. I have also done it with a couple tablespoons of sour cream and a handful of grated cheddar cheese. My hubby is very picky about soup and he asks for this quite often . THANK YOU !!

Very easy and made the kitchen smell really nice!  I had to add 1/2 cup extra water also - it was a little pasty and the rosemary was VERY strong.  I also added some sausage and that brought out a lot of flavor.  Will definitely use again!

My main alterations to this recipe were using three potatoes (skin on); using chicken stock to boil the potatoes instead of water, then adding the other ingredients to the stock and potatoes just before they were completely cooked; and using garlic powder. I added the other ingredients to the same saucepan while paying attention to the rate at which I added the flour. Everything mixed perfectly well. I did increase the amount of spices to the mix as well, but I should not have done so with the salt and pepper.

This was really yummy!  My husband (who is VERY picky) loved it!  I did add one clove of garlic, finely diced, about halfway through the onion and butter being sauteed.  Also, I added a little oregano when I added the flour and other spices.  It was a little thick, which my husband loved, but was a little too thick for me.  We added shredded cheese during seconds and that was great!  I've never reviewed anything before, but this deserved it!!

This is really good soup. I doubled the recipe and added three extra potatoes. Next time I will add even more potatoes and carrots and celery.  This is a great base.

Giving 4 stars because we made some modifications... Chopped and sauteed several slices of bacon (just because we had some that needed to be used) then removed from pot, added about 2 tbsp butter to the bacon fat and then cooked the onions in that. Added more potatoes and some shredded gruyere, used an immersion blender to make it a smoother soup. Incredibly delicious!

Tasty soup. We added basil to the mixture, and threw everything into the crock-pot on high for 5 hours. Suits our taste with less onion and diced more thoroughly. Topped with grated parm cheese and served with home made french bread.

Just made this and it is a great treat on a cold winter day.  Like some other reviewers, I cooked some chopped carrot and celery with the onion.  The only change I would make next time is to use more potatoes.  I also used slightly less flour than called for but next time will use the full amount.

Awesome recipe! I followed what was written except I omitted the Rosemary because I just don't care for it and I added a teaspoon of Celery Seed which turned out to be a great addition.  I also added a little garlic which I regret because it made it taste too Italian - like Alfredo sauce so I wouldn't do that again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent potato soup recipe.  Don't be afraid to be creative and add some celery, carrots or ham.  I tripled the recipe for Thanksgiving.  All my guests enjoyed it!

This is a wonderful basic potato soup. I tripled the recipe and cut the salt to 2 1/2 tsp. I only used 2 large onions and I also opted to leave out the Rosemary and Thyme. My entire family loved it, which is no small feat. Thaks for the recipe!

Awesome flavor. great soup. It was VERY thick...I was expecting a little bit more runny like the picture, but the overall outcome was a very delicious bowl of hearty potato soup.

Oh my gosh I love this soup! I had no other 'cream' other than milk and I didn't want a soup that included bacon because I didn't want it to rely on it for it's flavor. I didn't have onion either so used powder but added carrots and broccoli. Oh, and didn't add the rosemary due to reviews. My hubby and daughter loved it, my son did not. He's a picky toddler so I didn't expect much. What a great soup to add to or keep it plain. Thanks!

This is a very satisfying, great tasting soup. I've made it a few times now. Once as written, then with the addition of garlic and a pinch of celery seed for personal taste preference. I also finely chop the onion and let it saute for several minutes so they reduce nicely. This last time, I was short on milk so I use a can of evaporated milk I had in the pantry. Wonderful result! The soup was so creamy. I also sometimes add some grated cheddar and crumbled bacon on top, but you don't need it to enjoy this soup.

This was very quick and easy.  We did add a bit of carrot and used chicken stock, but I think the original recipe would have been just as good... Quite tasty and filling.

Jo, this is a winner! The first few times I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was a HUGE hit. That was over a year ago, ans since then I have tinkered with my version, adding chopped carrots and celery to cook with the potatoes, adding ham, beef  or cooked chicken and cooking the veggies in broth instead of water. Also, I have added a bit of garlic or garlic powder to the seasonings. My mom says it reminded her of her mother's potato soup, and she asks me to make it so often I added it to my recipe rotation. Wonderful!

This soup is a nice start, but it needs tweaking. First of all, there is no way this is five servings. More like three. I have standard sized soup bowls and was able to fill two almost full and two just less than half, which was perfect for two adults and two kids, but would not have been enough had I wanted to serve 4 or 5 adults. Secondly, I would cook the potatoes in chicken broth along with the onions for more depth of flavor in the soup base. I thought the rosemary and thyme (I used fresh) were perfect, though. I will make this again as, overall, we enjoyed it.  But with a few adjustments.

Great, creamy potato soup. I added a clove of garlic and then sprinkled cheese on top right before serving. Flavor was great, and it was so simple.

My husband loves making this soup!  He adds carrots, celery and ham sometimes.  And he cuts down the onion to half.  It's great, I take it to work with me for my co-workers and they love it too.

This is excellent!  The only changes I made was that I crumble 2 or 3 strips of bacon while it's simmering.  Then I sprinkle some shredded cheddar cheese on each bowl before serving.  Excellent!

This potato soup was delicious. Great flavor, great consistancy, and so easy. I loved that I could make this with ingredients that I always have in the house without making a special trip to the store. My husband, who doesn't usually like potato soups that well really liked this. The method was interesting too with the onions, butter, flour and the rest of the spices - loved it! I will make this soup often because it is a good one to make when you're out of time and can't get to the store. Thank you for this recipe, Jo.

It is great but the onion is not needed. Also, there aren't enough potatoes. My dad is adding 5 more...
Next time, I'll just throw the onion in whole.

I REALLY enjoyed the rosemary in this recipe.  I used fresh from the garden but I'm sure it would be similar with dried.  My husband was resisting trying it since he 'hates potato soup', but he eventually tried it and said it was perfect for a cold day.  Thank you for the recipe!

Good, hearty soup. Almost stew-like in consistency. Easy to make. I added a bit of garlic powder to give it some extra flavor. Will definitely be a repeat in our family.

This is a great recipe!  It tastes just like my fave soup at Sweet Tomatoes.  The soup rotates on and off the menu there, so I can never count on being able to get a bowl.  Now I can make it at home.    First, I doubled the recipe because I wanted leftovers.  I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth -great flavor.  I added 6 cloves of chopped garlic which I sauteed in the butter.  I left out the onion, but added 1 tsp onion powder.  (It's a weird hang-up of mine.)  I was tempted to leave out the salt, but after tasting decided it needed 1 tsp (double would have been 2 tsp.)  I used my potato masher and gave a course mash to the potatoes before adding to herbed white sauce.  I really like that this recipe uses dried herbs.  Fresh ones are very expensive at my grocery store.

Love this recipe as is, also love it as a base to be innovative.  I've prepared this just as it is written, I've replaced the rosemary with oregano, I've added bacon, added carrots and celery, definitely added garlic (family of garlic lovers!) replaced water with chicken broth and white wine, done almost everything to this recipe and it all turns out delicious!  It truly takes an incredible recipe to be so versatile and to inspire different flavors, thank you for sharing!

I liked this recipe. it was definitely tasty but the only thing i would change is the water measurements.  I added double the amount of water that was listed in the recipe and it was still pretty thick.  I also would add more salt and pepper for extra flavor.  Other than that, great recipe.

Amazing! An easy recipe that can't really be messed up. As a scatter brained new mom, I tend to forget ingredients, or get started thinking I have everything. I added some chopped ham leftover from Easter. My husband really loved this one! And the leftovers just keep getting better.

Delicious! And so easy! I made a few small changes, like substituting vegetable broth for the water and doubling that liquid and spices but that was just to suite personal taste. Definitely worth a try and so perfect for a chilly fall or winter night

This is some good soup! I even used 1% lowfat milk and it came out just fine.  I did double the herbs, but that's just because I am a "the more herbs/spices, the better" kind of girl.  There's a slight chill in the air today in MI, so this soup is just the ticket!

I followed the recipe to the letter.  It had way too much thyme in it.  So strong that it had a dirt taste.  I tried to add more milk and other seasonings to tame the flavor but to no avail.  If I try this again I will add a tiny sprinkle of thyme if any at all.

This was my first white sauce, the recipe was so easy that after the first time I made it from memory!  I added sausage once, that was really, really good! I am always looking for good ways to use the potato and this helped. thank you very much!

Very easy and the whole family loved it!  I just threw the onions in with the potatoes and elimanated the butter.  I also used soy milk instead of regular milk.  This is a great winter soup!

Made this for the first time tonight, very yummy and very easy to prepare. I made just as the recipe calls for tonight except I added garlic to the onions but next time (which will be soon) I will change it up a bit with trying chicken broth to cook the potatoes in, and adding cerlery or cerlery seed and maybe oregano instead of rosemary! It is a Keeper!

Very easy great tasting soup.  I didn't have enough onion, so I added 1 tsp of garlic powder and eliminated the rosemary.  I garnished with sour cream and cheddar...very yummy.

This soup was great and such a breeze to make. We used  chicken broth instead of water and also added a red bell pepper, parmesan and crumbled bacon. It seems like a perfect add-anything soup.

Taste is phenomenal. Followed the recipe, except added 1 more potato and about 3/4 cup of leftover heavy cream.  I also used original almond milk instead of milk. Tasted exactly like the real deal. The bowl could feed around 5 or 6 people. Some of the best and easiest soup I've even made. And I make a lot of soup.

Wow - this was great!  I was craving a cream soup and was out of chicken broth, which almost all the other recipes seem to require.  I was doubtful that this would have flavor without a broth and ended up being pleasantly surprised.  Took 20 minutes to make and tasted great - will definitely do this one again!

Kind of bland as is. I added diced ham, more of the called for spices, and celery salt. That brought it from a 2/3 star to a 4 (meaning I would make it again).

This soup was awesome, even my 9 year old loves it.  I too added oregano instead of rosemary, just for the fact that I did not have rosemary on hand and read that others tried it, but it was yummy!  So simple and easy to make.

Wonderful! I needed to finish the milk before it got bad, and decided to do a soup - oh so flavorful!  I added a little bit of Italian Seasoning, but this recipe is such a wonderful and easy base to work with.

I have to give this recipe five stars for making potato soup so easy and fun.  I took some advice from others and added celery.  I didn't like it cuz it was crunchy in the soup.  Perhaps I should have sauteed it longer. I have tried this twice.  Once with garlic instead of onion and dill and oregano instead of thyme and rosemary and was excellent. The second time I only had basil and dill and added onion/celery/garlic.  I will definitely omit the celery next time and probably try rosemary and thyme if I can.

I loved this soup. All i added was a little less than a 1/4 of a cup of parm. cheese. i thought it added  little more flavor, it definetly isn't necessary though. I most definetly will make it again.

This is a hit at our house. It has an excellent, unique flavor and is wonderfully inexpensive as well. Most potato soup needs bacon and/or cheese, but this stands on its own.

I've always been disappointed in the "flat" flavor when I've attempted potato soup in the past, but thyme and rosemary are a wonderful, savory combination that earns 5 stars for this recipe.  I had a lot of potatoes and some ham on hand, so I cooked up 5 lbs. of cubed potatoes, 1/2 pound of chopped baby carrots, and a pound of cubed ham in 4 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water.  (I think celery would be a good addition too but I forgot.) I put the seasonings in the broth so that the potatoes would absorb them from the get-go, increasing the amounts to 1 tsp. each of black pepper and rosemary, 2 tsp. of thyme.  (I left out the salt, assuming that the ham and broth would be salty enough.)  I made the white sauce without increasing the onion but did saute it with 2 cloves of garlic, and I used 2 cups of milk to stretch it a little farther. (I think I'll use 2 cans of evaporated milk in the future.) It made a nice big pot of soup that I will divide and freeze, but the first bowl was my lunch today with some cornbread on the side.  I'm lovin' it!

This soup is great!  Thank you for the recipe Jo.  I added garlic and celery (family tradition) and grated cheddar cheese.  I also boiled the potatoes in 1 cup water and 1 cup chicken broth.  The taste is so delightful and it is so quick to make.  Wonderful recipe!

Very tasty for a vegetarian/non meat potato soup! I also replaced the rosemary with oregano but only because I didn't have rosemary. You may need to add more milk as it thickens up too much. I also used red potatoes and left the skin on them.

Super creamy soup! My whole family and I enjoyed this soup even without the herbs in it. I would definitely cook this again. Thanks, for sharing! :)

Very good and easy to make. I had added some extra spices based on other ratings and I had maybe over done it a little, but not the fault of the recipe at all!

This soup is very tasty, I think it would taste better if you blended at the end to get rid of the potato chunks.  I like that this recipe is vegetarian as most on this site have pork in them.

I don't know why everybody raves so much over this soup. It was just OK. Maybe a little too much herbs. After the first bowl I added a cup of grated Parmesan   cheese, and though that improved the soups a great deal. Still, I do not think I would make this again.

I love making this soup. It's so filling and just gets better the longer it sits (FABULOUS LEFT OVERS). Went great with some herb rolls that I made. I do, however, leave out the rosemary. I like it, but I think it give this soup a funny taste.

Soooo good and very simple. I used chicken broth instead of water and added some celery and garlic to the onions. I am sure it would be amazing exactly as written!

This dish turned out great!!  My husband loved it!  I don't cook much cuz I am not very comfortable in the kitchen, but this was easy breezy!  The only thing I did different was add a little extra butter, used half the water and the other half I used chicken broth.  I also added bacon or sometimes I use turkey bacon.  The bacon is what my husband loved the most. This time I also added Orzo pasta by Barilla.  Its pretty good in it!!  I will definetly make this soup again and again!!!!

I made this soup for my mom the other day, and we both LOVED it! It was very thick, but very tasty. Since neither of us like rosemary too much, though, I cut the amount it called for in half. It was still herbed and delicious! Thanks for sharing!

Added a couple cloves of garlic when I sauteed the onions. Otherwise, left the recipe unchanged. It was awesome! Very creamy, thick and flavorful. Best part is the ingredients are typically on hand. A person could easily add chicken or bacon, if they wanted to, or even some kale, chard, or fresh spinach. But if not, it's perfect the way it is. This is destined to become a favorite.

This soup was delicious and easy.  It was a little thick for my taste, so I simply added more milk until it was the consistency I desired.  I also added a bit more salt.  I used only half an onion instead of a whole (red onion), which was perfect.  Next time, I'm going to try it with leeks, instead of onion.

I just made this, and it's tasty and unbelievingly simple. I also agree that the thyme and oregano seem like a better combination. If you like spice, like I do, add a little more pepper and it's not too bland. This seems like the basic simple soup and you can add bacon bits, broccoli, or cheese depending on personal preference. Seems like a great basic soup for experimenting topping flavors !

I think this soup was good but it did taste and had the consistancy of breakfast gravy. As a matter of fact I served with hot biscuits. Next time I will try the garlic and adding carrots.

Good soup.  Though I would replace the thyme and rosemary with minced garlic.  Then add a little mozzerella cheese when serving.  That's the potato soup flavor I'm used to.

This was very good,but next time i think i will add some more onion or garlic just something to add a little more flavor, i like a lot of spice to my soup...This would also make a  good gravy without the potatos and water.

This soup was just alright. I would definitely do half water/half veggie broth next time. It tasted like a white sauce basically with a few herbs in it. I added cheese, carrots, corn, celery and garlic powder to increase the flavour but still wasn't amazed by it. This was a very thick soup as well and my hubby came in and actually thought it was a sauce to go over pasta and so that's what we did in the end-had it over penne noodles?! All in all it was just an alright flavour, I would definitely add broc. next time as well.

This was really good! and easy to make.  I did add some diced celery and shredded carrots and increased the butter a little to accomodate this.  I think the rosemary and thyme are fantastic in this dish!  My picky 16 yr old daughter even liked this one! Thanks - it's keeper in my house.

I modified this recipe just a little bit to suit my tastes a little better, but I'm sure that the original recipe would have been great as well!  I used 8 small red potatoes since I didn't have medium ones on hand. I mashed half of the potatoes directly into the saucepan when they were done. The other half I tossed in at the end so we'd have potato pieces as well.  I added about 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and about 1/4 cup shredded cheddar chz as well.   Garnished with red pepper flakes.  Served with ham and cheddar sandwiche, which I toasted at 400 degrees on buttered Italian bread. It complimented the soup nicely! If you are going to do this, I suggest toasting the slices of bread on their own for about 3 minutes before adding the ham/cheese, and then for another 2-3 mins till browned.   I will definitely serve this at our upcoming party- you can make a lot for very little money!

This was so easy--we made it while camping!  I added chopped carrots and celery, as well as some cayenne pepper.  We just pre-cut all the ingredients and threw them in the pot accordingly that night.  Everyone was amazed how good it was and wanted 2nds.  (and 3rds if we had had any left!)

The addition of herbs makes this a really delicious potato soup.  I added a little finely chopped celery and some shredded carrot, and I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth.  Definitely a keeper.

This is the best potato soup I have made.  Loved the flavor.  I did follow some previous advice.  I added some chopped carrots and had some sweet bell peppers on hand, so threw those in too.  I also added garlic and a few slices of chopped bacon.  You could add almost any veggie to this one.  Corn would be good in there too.  It is a great base recipe to add onto.  The proportions were all good and the flavor spectacular!

This is a great recipe although I did choose to use heavy whipping cream instead of milk to thicken it up.  I also threw in some red pepper flakes, but otherwise used the directions as is!

I used sweet potatoes instead and used a mixer to make a cream soup. Totally delicious, pretty and  much more nutritious than regular potatoes.

The whole family loves this recipe! I leave out the spices while cooking it and let everyone add in the amount they'd like since we all prefer a different amount of flavor to our soup.

Delicious, though I made a few changes. Only used around 1/4 of an onion, added garlic, chives, carrots and cellery. I also used oregano instead of rosemary. Oh and I added 2 extra potatoes.  Served with corn bread. Will make this again and again.

I was looking for a recipe without ham or bacon and this one was really good.  I liked the "herb" taste with the rosemary and thyme.  I added a small amount of finely chopped carrot for color and nutrition, plus I added a small amount of cheddar, although I think it would have been just as good without it.  I would double the recipe since there was just one medium bowl for the 4 of us and no leftovers.  Very nice soup.

Excellent and very easy to make.  I double it and leave the skins on the potatoes.  I also usually add more water at the end to make it a bit thinner since it is very thick.  My husband is not a soup eater (unfortunately) but he LOVES this soup!

Great base for a soup! I customized it a bit. Like some of the reviewers I added celery, I also added 3 sausage patties and because of this I cut the butter to 2 tbs and less salt. I didn't have rosemary and thyme so added parsley instead. The sausage gave it a little kick to the soup. I also added a bit more liquid to make less "heavy".

Delicious.  I added carrot, celery, garlic, and about 1/2 tsp "Better than Bullion" vegetable base while sauteing.  We are vegan - which means no dairy, so I used Earth Balance instead of butter and Soy milk instead of milk.  I don't love soy milk, but I can't even tell that's what is in the soup.

Made this for lunch today and it was a huge hit with everyone.  I ran the potatoes through my blender before adding to soup and it was great and extrememly creamy.  Just what I wanted on a cold, foggy afternoon.

Very good!  I took this to a classroom of third graders and it was a hit!  I added bacon and used whole milk.  I also added a package of Grandmas Homemade frozen noodles to make it more filling.  The herbs really make this recipe stand out.

This is a very good soup, but since we like our soups chunky, I doubled the amount of potatoes and added some carrots.  Its just too liquidy without it.  This is a great soup on a winter's day.

I just whipped this up for lunch, and it is very good!  I have a couple of other favorite potato soup recipes, but I didn't have the ingredients I need on hand.  I always have the ingredients for this one!  I made it exactly as written, but I used skim milk.

I liked this sou- - very quick and easy to make.  I doubled the recipe and used half water, half veggie broth to cook the potatoes.  I also pureed 1/2 the potatoes in a blender before adding to the onion/milk mixture.  Topped off with some sharp cheddar - perfect for a rainy day!

This was delicious.. I doubled the recipe and used fresh rosemary which I thought was very good; I had some frozen home-made stock so I used it in place of the water.  I also had a lot of half & half to use up so I replaced the milk with it;  it was very rich and creamy!.. :)

Before this I have never made any kind of cream... This one was easy and so tasty hubby asked for seconds and our house was smeling great. I will make this soup again, it is great for this cold rainy days! I only made one addition, I diced some bacon and fried it a little bit and sprinkeld it over the soup at serving time just because.

Pretty good. It needed a lot of salt and I added bacon. I substituted oregano, but I think I would have stuck with the rosemary. Personal preference I guess. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good (with the changes I made)! I took the advice of others and added about 1/4 cup diced celery and 1 crushed garlic clove with the butter. I only had dried onions flakes so I used those instead. I also put a dash of paprika into it as well. I used chicken broth instead of the water, but ended up using about 1/2 cup water also in order to make the soup less thick. I also only had fat free 1/2 and 1/2 on hand, so I used that instead of the milk. Next time, I think that a couple slices of diced bacon would be delicious in this soup! I'll add it to the onion saute next time.

I am blown away at the perfect balance of flavor. I have never in my life tasted a better potatoe soup. I will be changing the standard salt with kosher, and adding this to our menu at our internet cafe. Thanks so much I am sure we will see the bottom of the soup well the first day.

Thick and creamy!  Just how I like it.  I easily converted it to dairy free by using smart balance butter and soy milk.  Tastes wonderful!

The flavor was ok but not rich enough for us; next time I will cook the potatoes in chicken broth, reduce the salt in the recipe and add crushed garlic.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I made a vegan version with soy margarine and soy milk.  I would suggest that with the soy milk you don't use flour.  It gets thick enough.  With the flour mine ended up more like potatoes with a cream sauce, but it was still delicious!

I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth, added 4-5 strips of bacon, used a lot of pepper, some thyme, oregano, and a little salt.  I sprinkled with parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.  My husband likes everything hot, so we dashed some Tapatio hot sauce in our bowls.  It was super yummy!

I made this for a friend after her baby was born, and she (and her very picky family) loved it.  I cut the onion (because my friend doesn't like onions), added three cloves garlic (chopped), added two sticks celery (chopped), used fresh thyme and rosemary, used chicken broth instead of water, and added an extra 1 1/2 cups of broth when putting the potatoes and milk base together. All in all, this made one of the best soups I've ever had!  We will definitely make it again.

SOOOOO yummy! I made this for my husband today because he has a cold. I followed it exactly and at the end I added some bacon and a dash of hot sauce (because it helps with the cold). It was absolutely wonderful. It was never clumpy! I will use this technique for many other soups, super simpe adn went off without a glitch!! Thanks so much

VERY GOOD!! I really like this recipe. And it was so easy and quick to make. I added some garlic to the onions and a little bit of red pepper flakes. I also topped it with some cheese. It's so filling. I ate one bowl and was stuffed! I can't wait to eat the left overs tomorrow. I will definately make this again. Perfect for those cold winter nights.

I changed a lot of things, sorry, to make this more flavorful, but still used the basic recipe as the base.  Instead of water, I cooked three peeled and chopped potatoes in organic beef broth. Cooked celery chopped along with the onion chopped fine in butter and bit of olive oil, salt, pepper, few red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp. poultry seasoning, 1/2 tsp. celery salt, 1/2 tsp onion salt and lastly added the cream and one large slice chopped of very sharp cheddar cheese melted into the soup.  Tasted for salt and pepper and it was a lot more flavorful, but I wouldn't have gotten there without the original great recipe.  Thanks for that.

This soup was AMAZING!!! I chopped up some celery and stirred that in with the onions. Carrots would be good in this too. I would have put some in except I didn't have any. :( I also added 1 t. of Basil. Very good.

Great Recipe! Will use again!

I made this tonight and got okay reviews from my family. I added minced garlic and chicken boullion as another reviewer suggested to the boiling water with the potatoes then mashed them when they were done cooking. I also added chopped fried bacon which gave it a great flavor. My husband didn't like the herbs and I thought it was too salty. If I make this again, I will not add the salt  because of the bouillon and the bacon. It was okay.

This was really good, but the 2nd time I made it I used chicken stock instead and it was fantastic.  With chicken stock, it's a 5 star recipe.

Caution on the rosemary -- I didn't have crushed rosemary, so I used rosemary leaves and tried to crush them myself (with limited success).  On her first bite, my daughter bit into one and kept complaining about the pine needles in the soup.  I thought she was over-reacting until I bit into one on my last bite.  It was a little overpowering.  I love highly seasoned food, so if I think it was a little strong, it was probably way to strong for others.  If I had used crushed rosemary, it probably would have been better.  I think I will change from rosemary to oregano next time around and see how that is.  The only change I made this time was to use spelt instead of white flour.  It is an excellent whole grain substitution for white flour when you are thickening sauces and gravies.  I also used shredded cheese as a garnish on top of each serving.UPDATE: This is now a staple meal in our home -- though to be 5-star, I add crumbled bacon, cheddar cheese & sub oregano for rosemary & chicken broth for water.

This was delicious! I'd had a potato soup before that a friend made and have been searching for something similar ever since. Nice and simple, and very filling. I put some bacon in as well, and served with bread.

It was great! Though, i did make some modifications. Since there was not alots of vegies in this soup, i decided to add a couple (carrots, celeri..) And the second modification was that i only had skim milk, so i added some cream in there. I served it with italian bread buns.

Super easy recipe.  I always dr it up just a little.  I add some cooked breakfast sausage.  It makes it that much better.  I usually use less onion then whats called for just because my husband isnt a big onion fan.  But a little onion goes a long way so it still has great flavor.  I have even used skim milk instead of regular milk and it still turns out great.

So wonderful in comparison to how easy and how few ingredients are involved! My husband said it was by far the best potato soup he's ever had.  I did add a spring of fresh rosemary and fresh thyme simply because I had them.  Wonderful, try it!

This was so incredibly easy to make and used only ingredients I had lying around anyway. And everyone loved it!  What I did (slightly differently): I only had rather small potatoes on hand, so I diced three of them; I added minced garlic to the onions (didn't really notice it consciously); and I added carrots to the potatoes (which I really liked for flavor, although they don't quite work visually, since the result is this very white soup with specks of green and then enormous lumps of orange?). Will definitely make again, but may omit the carrots, depending on the menu and occasion. Guests loved it too. Easy!!

This was okay.  Not fabulous, not bad, but nothing thrilling.  I had about 3.5 cups of cooking water, just to cover my diced potatoes (they were a little large), and I still had to add extra milk to thin it (coming to 2 cups total).  I also skipped the rosemary, and instead went with garlic.  We topped it with a little monterrey jack and some chives, and ate it as a meal with saltine crackers.   I typically make my own potato soup, but I was low on ingredients and time, so I searched until I found a recipe that fit what I had.  For what it was-- a basic, simple soup recipe-- it was not bad, but I think a little doctoring could add a lot of much-needed flavor! Oh, and after tasting the roux, I was really afraid that it was going to have the gravy flavor that other reviewers mentioned, but I'm happy to say that it did not!

Only 4 stars because I changed so much.  I boiled 4 baker potatoes cubed w/skins in 5c. chicken broth.  I sauteed 2 lg. red onions & 4 stalks of celery in 3/4c. butter, added 1/2c. flour, 2tsp of salt, thyme, & oregano, & 1/2 tsp. pepper.  I cooked the rue for a couple of minutes & then added 2c. half& half, & 1c. milk.  I let that simmer for 10 min.  Then I added the cooked potatoes & broth.  I ran the immersion blender through the soup for about 30 seconds, leaving some potato chunks.  I ended up adding about 1 tsp of seasoning salt and then let the soup simmer for about an hour.  My family though it was awesome.  This recipe yielded enough for a family of three to eat as a main course with a couple of servings leftover.

Tripled the potatoes, added 3 or 4 chopped carrots with the potatoes. Used Italian seasoning instead of thyme/rosemary. Boiled potatoes and carrots in more than 2 cups of water. I poured some of the water off before adding to the other ingredients, but probably was still a bit more than 2 cups (maybe 3 or 4?) I used an immersion blender at the end to puree the soup. So delicious!

I made this soup for my family and added 1 onion instead of two because I wanted to hide them from my son that hates onions. I also cooked it on low for 30 min. and it came out perfect. My son checked it for onions and couldn't find any- he loved it!

I used purple potatoes and shallots in place of white potatoes and an onion (had those in my CSA box this week). Made this vegan by using soy margarine and almond milk and added a small bag of frozen corn and chopped veggie bacon.   Very tasty, although a little thick for the first serving. Thinned out nicely with a little bit of water.  It took me a while to chop the potatoes and shallots so I would probably not make this for a weekday dinner again.  Taste was really lovely – the herbs were just pronounced enough (although I did have to add more salt and pepper to the roux). Looking forward to having it again for lunch tomorrow!

I followed the recipe just as it is.  The result was an EXCELLENT potato soup. The consistency was perfect and the flavor was phenomenal and it was very easy to make right.  I was shocked at the flavor it had considering there isn't a cup of salt in it.  I recommend doubling the recipe, at the least, if you like your soup in a good sized bowl (as a main dish). I got two good sized bowls using the recipe you see here (2 medium potatoes).

Very east and satisfying.  I did use up some left over chicken broth instead of water and omitted the salt.  My family enjoyed it very much.

Very quick and easy to make! We usually always have these ingredients on hand too! I would have cooked the potatoes longer and sort of mashed them but the flavor is pretty good, I think if you added heavy cream it would have a better flavor. I also like to add cheese for better flavor!

I made this last night for my husband and he loved it! I too, tweaked it to my own liking by sauteing a handful of sliced mushrooms with the onions and butter and adding a handful of chopped carrot to cook at the same time as the potatoes. After adding the sauted mixture to the potatoe and carrots I added about 1/4 cup of cream and some chopped spinach to it. I also added to oxo cubes of chicken broth and some garlic. Mmmmm....it was delicious! Try it!

I really loved this soup as a base. I like to add, onion, green peper, mushroom, basil, garlic, ground pepercorn and pasta. I also add what ever left over meat in the fridge like chicken or pork. So I've probably changed the soup into a completely new one, but I used this recipe  as the base, and it's easy enough to flavor it to suit your tastes exactly.

I tried potato soup for the first time and really liked it. I did not add any water and used parsley because I had it at hand, it came out very well. I also added some peas to the recipe, which was yum. I am gonna try many variations of this recipe.

Very yummy. I do agree with another that the flavor is along the lines of white gravy. Mine turned out pretty thick.

I really like this receipe. I changed a few minor details to my likings and it turned out great! I added a little more butter, potatoes, milk & flour. Used chicken broth instead of water. Used a couple of fresh thyme sprigs(remove stem before adding potatoes) left off the rosemary.

Fantastic!!!  What wonderful flavors.  I did add carrots and celery in with the potatoes.  I also cooked them in water with some chicken bouillon.  This was a fairly easy to make quick dinner.  We had a little garlic bread to go with it and were HAPPY.  Thanks for a great recipe that is a keeper.

I just made this soup this morning.  The kitchen smelled wonderful.  I would highly recommend this soup...I did add celery, garlic and carrots and cooked the potatoes in chicken broth.  So yummy on this freezing cold day.

Delicious and easy!  I didn't want it as buttery, so I only added half the butter.  As suggested, I sauted garlic with the onion.  I topped it off with some cheese.  Yummy!  Thanks a lot for a great recipe :)

Great tasting, quick and easy to make.  I followed others and cooked the potatoes in broth (vegetarian), used oregano in place of rosemary, and added celery (a stalk). I will make this many more times.

This recipe is very hearty and delicious! I added Mrs. Dash seasoning instead of rosemary and thyme. I also added hickory bacon salt and sausage to my potato soup that made the soup very tasty and giving it a hickory taste to it as well. Otherwise,with the exception of the few changes I made;I followed the recipe to the T and it  turned out great!

Great recipe! I cut back on the onion, just because I didn't have a whole onion.  Subbed a few onion flakes, used skim milk and Smart Balance spread instead of butter.  Only complaint would be that it is very thick, so added some extra water to make it a little more creamy.  2nd time I added diced red pepper, celery and carrots and it was delish!!!

My Husband and I love homemade soups and this is one is filling, flavorful. A definite comfort food perfect for this time of year. Add the celery as others have suggested, it adds just a bit more flavoring. Very delicious.

Great recipe! Like others suggested, I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth. Since I can't have dairy I used vegan butter and almond milk and thanks to the herbs, no one but me knew the difference. I'll definitely make this again.

Not the best of luck...too much onion. I felt like it was missing something. I have had much better. Very boring disappointing. On the flip side Patrick loved it and requests it often.

This is a very easy, very good potato soup recipe. I used stock instead of water, and omitted the salt. For a creamier soup, I would take out the flour and put half of it in the blender for a few seconds. Delicious!

Delicious! Everyone loved it, including my 5 year old! Yum! Some reviewers found it to be pasty, but I did not...it was a great consistancy...just like a chowder. I wonder if they forgot to add the water that the potatoes cook in. This was fabulous. Thank you!

Very yummy!  I love that it can be made with very little, its pretty healthy, and quick!  I added some carrot, a minced clove of garlic, and a dash of red pepper flakes, and like a few others, used chicken broth in place of the water.  I think the rosemary and thyme could be scaled back just a tad, but maybe that is just a personal preference.  I also think it tastes better with half milk and half cream/half-and-half.  With just milk, it lacks the creaminess.  But regardless, the outcome is a quick, easy, tasty soup - just what I was looking for!  Also, one time I tossed in about 2 cups of leek to make a potato-leek soup, and it turned out AMAZING!!  So not only is this delicious on its own, its also great as a base for potato-leek soup - very versatile and essentially foolproof!  Thanks for this recipe, its been added to our rotation.

The recipe as written is excellent! I cut the salt in half for my family as we tend to prefer less salt. I added canned corn too and it was great! Everyone loved it, including some friends that just popped by for a quick visit.

This was by far one of the best potato soup recipes I have ever had!  The rosemary gave it a wonderful flavor.  I did not have any thyme so I just used some celery seed and ground it up to put in.  I also had to multiply the recipe by six to feed my family and had almost no leftovers.  Also my wife hates potato soup but she loved this one, thanks.  Jo this was superb!

I had five pounds of potatoes I needed to use when I found this recipe.  I have been trying to find a recipe that matches the soup served at Backyard Burgers and wanted to see if this would work.  

This recipe is for two potatoes so I had to increase the recipe to work with about 8 or 9 of them.  Let me just say I am not used to cooking with lots of herbs and spices.  I doubled the amount of herbs but I think I should have used the original amounts in the recipe.  The taste was very strong and made my stomach hurt.  Next time I will use smaller amounts of the herbs. 

All in all, it is the first pot of potato soup I have ever made.  Next time I will try another recipe.  If anybody is familiar with Backyard Burgers or Silver Star Burgers and the potato soup they serve, please hit me up with a similar recipe.  

Thanks in advance!

This has become my go-to base for potato soup.  It's great as-is, but this is also the perfect starter recipe for the addition of cheese, bacon or veggies... however you like your potato soup!

This was a wonderful creamy soup. I do agree with some of the other reviws that there is too much rosemary, so i just put a small pinch into the dish. I will absolutly make this dish again! I also put more salt but, I love salt.Overall, EXCELLENT!

Really good, it's my husband's favorite potato soup. Only changes I made were to use chicken broth instead of water and I also doubled the broth/water and potatoes and it came out great. Thanks for the recipe!

has a nice flavor, especially of thyme. i used less butter and found that it was creamy enough. i probably would have blended all the ingredients together, if i owned a food processor. very yummy.

OMG! Fantastic! I added 1/2 cup chicken broth because I found that my potatoes boiled dry (I probably left them on too high) and then topped each bowl with a little bit of shredded old cheddar. Can't wait to make more. Next time I'm going try adding garlic. EASY EASY recipe. Thank you!

great recipe.  Directions were a little unclear. Definitely add the water that's with the potatoes to the soup.  Needed to cook onions longer, and add more garlic.

Delicious!  Perfect for cold fall nights.  I didn't have any thyme on hand so I substituted sage and I also added about a tsp. of cornstarch at the end to thicken it up.  Will definetely be making this one again!

Wonderful recipe! This is the third potato soup recipe I have tried and the first that tastes just right to me! I am living overseas and don't have access to a lot of ingredients but this one was simple enough that I could find everything. I did make 3 small changes though. I added a chicken boullion cube to the water while cooking the potatoes, substituted oregano for rosemary because it was easier to find, and added a little more water than called for to thin it a bit and make it last longer. Thank you for the great recipe! This will be one of my staple meals this winter when all I can find are potatoes and onions!

This was delicious and very easy! I doubled it and added a can of (drained) corn and it made a delicious potato/corn soup! My whole family (even my picky 24 yr old son) loved it..i used to make a potato soup that took a whole lot more time and didnt taste nearly as flavorful as this soup!

I just made this soup and the soup base was perfect.  I just found it to be really bland.  So, I looked up some other cream of potato soup recipies.  Just as I thought, all of the used chicken stock for the liquid.  I would probably cook my potatoes in broth next time to add a lot more flavor.  For this time I just added celery salt and garlic powder to season it a little more.  I will make this soup again with the chicken stock alteration I mentioned.  Also, I would omit salt until the end and season to taste.

Sorry to be the first to not give a 5-star review, but I didn't feel it was worth 5-stars...Pretty close, but not quite.  It was definitly a good recipe and I will make it again, but it can use improvements. We added Celery and Garlic to this soup as well as salt.  We also thought it was too thick--like paste.  Adding milk helped with that.

This was one of the best soup recipes I have ever made. I made a few small changes. I boiled the potatos in chicken broth and added zucchini and green beens to the pot. I added garlic to the pan with onion, then added chopped spinach to the soup when it was done. It was a bit too thick for me so I will add more broth next time. So, so good!!

All I can say is WOW!!!!!!!! I was looking for a six star, because this truly is one of the best recipes I have tried. I was looking for a quick and easy soup, but did not expect to find this. It tastes like something right out of a restaurant. Nothing missing from this recipe, absolutely delicious, and will definately become a winter staple in my household. I even used white pepper instead of black, which added a bit more of a quick, so for those that like to spice things up, this is an easy substitution.

This soup is delicious, creamy, flavorful and very easy to make.  This was my first time making homemade potatoe soup. My husband and I really enjoyed it and it was very filling.

It was delicious! I cooked it for my family and they all loved it. But I had a problem when I couldn't find any flour so I just used corn starch and it still tasted as good.
