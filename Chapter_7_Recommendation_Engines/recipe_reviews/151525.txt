This recipe is just "OK"...until I put onions and mushrooms with the sauce.  I also but a lot most spices in it.  Like  garlic, seasoned salt, and pepper.  And a added a little beer (make it thinner), and baked it at 350 for an hour.  It baked into the chicken and tasted great!

This was delicious! I grilled some split chicken breasts and it worked great to have some of the sauce in a small bowl to use for basting, then serve the rest without contamination from the raw chicken. I will definitely make this again!

I used chicken tenderloins instead of the chicken breast halves.  The flavor of the sauce was a bit strong for my taste, but my 13 year old son ate up 6 chicken tenderloins along with the rest of the rest of his dinner.
