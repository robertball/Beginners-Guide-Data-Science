This was actually AMAZING. I'm a baker and everyone always expects me to make these amazing from-scratch pies and cakes for potlucks. I took this to my 4th of July party, along with several homemade desserts and this one got eaten first. It was GONE in the blink of an eye. I made one change, which makes ALL the difference in presentation. Instead of stirring everything together, I layered into the crust: first the cream cheese mixture, then sliced strawberries, whipped cream - and repeated until everything was used up. Then I "frosted" the pie with whipped cream in a piping bag [to make it pretty]. I would give this 6 stars, if I could.

Really good! I went all out with the fruit~Strawberries, Kiwi, Blueberries and Raspberries. I also used a Nilla wafer pre-made pie crust. There was enough filling to make two. Thanks for an easy crowd pleaser!!

So easy and it's so good.  I used strawberries and blueberries and I omitted the crust.  I just chilled the mixture and topped with some more fresh fruit.  My husband loved it.

I made this pie but I put it in a chocolate grham cracker crust and shaved Dark chocolate Hershey's candy bar over the top. It was very good. Very light and tasty.

Yum! I used a store-bought oreo cookie crust, 3 cups fresh strawberries and 1 1/2 packages fresh rasperries. This has such a great light flavor, I just want to keep eating it! I chilled it for about 3 hours but the consistency was a little too soft for me..almost pudding-like. I stuck it in the freezer and I'll taste that tomorrow! The recipe made so much filling that I put about half in a zip-loc and put it in the freezer to use another time. I think it would be really good over pound cake or with shortbread cookies. This is a great-tasting light dessert that can be varied many ways. I'd love to try it with peaches and blueberries and maybe even with key lime juice. Will make this again..so easy on a hot summer day!

Wonderful recipe and perfect when it is too hot to cook!  I only had 6 ounces of cream cheese so I reduced the whipped topping to 6 ounces.  I used fresh strawberries and blueberries but didn't have as much as the recipe required, almost but not quite.  No worries since other reviews said it makes a lot of filling, which it does make a lot!  Anyway, we loved it!  Caught DH sneaking some in the middle of the night and then I had some for breakfast (don't tell!).  Making this again soon with in season fruits from the Farmer's Market!  Thanks Melanie for a terrific addition to our summers.

This was really delicious. I rated only 4 star because the first pie turned out all pink and soft. The second time I used the base as specfied and found a recipe to cook the strawberry topping pour over base and it was really wonderful. I used the additional berries and whip cream over each slice of pie.

this was awesome! i had to change a few things due to what i had on hand. i used frozen raspberries(i drained them really well after defrost) and fresh blueberries. i also put in a pre-made choc crust. i only got 1 slice!! hubby ate half of it the 1st night. mine set up perfect..just make sure you give it at least 4 hours in the fridge before you dive in! i had leftover filling, so i froze it for later. thanks melanie for a great, easy pie!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It came out kind of runny and did not have much flavor at all. I will not be making this again.

This was EXTREMELY easy and delicious. I used graham cracker crusts and strawberries. The filling was a little too much for one crust but a little small for two. I made two pies. Next time I will maybe double the recipe and buy 3 pie crusts in case it's too much for 2 pies.

I was attracted to the beautiful photo for this recipe and like the photographer, Lindy, I used a shortbread-like crust with a bit of sugar in it and made tart shells for this excellent filling. It is light, fresh, fruity and creamy--just perfect!

I used sliced strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, and bananas. I ended up with two 9" pies. I served them both at a church function, and I didn't take any home. Plus, I had people wanting the recipe. Super easy and super delish!

I was looking for a copy-cat recipe from a diner we used to frequent in my childhood. All I remember was that it was fresh strawberries and lots of fluffy 'white stuff.' I found this recipe and it's so close -- plus very very delicious!! I've been making it every year (5 years now I think) when the local strawberries are in season.

This is so good.  I made a graham cracker crumb pie shell for it since I didn't have a traditional one.  I am a sweets and dessert nut and this one is five stars for me due to ease of preparation, few ingredients and outstanding taste.  Yumm!

Overall, very creamy and delicious. I would cut the strawberries smaller next time rather than slices per se.  I would like more strawberry flavor, but maybe as it sits overnight it will infuse more.  It is a pretty sweet flavor so maybe it doesn't need as much sugar, but I would make it again. I used a quart size container, 16 oz of strawberries and it was a little shy of the 4 cups the recipe called for and I used a 9 inch deep dish pie pan...plenty of filling...  recommended!

Only change- I made a homemade Graham cracker shell instead of pie dough. My father in law loves this pie and he never eats sweets. I have also made it with raspberries and think it's the better berry- a little tart helps to cut through the sweetness. Very good!

Delicious!!!   I added blueberries and raspberries with the strawberries.  I only mixed a small amount in with the cream mixture and used the rest for the top to make it pretty.

This pie is amazing! I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese to cut back on the fat a bit and you can't even tell the difference. Also, I add blueberries and I'm thinking about adding peaches next. It tastes fabulous and takes less than 10 minutes to make. Just make sure you follow the recipe exact because if not the pie can be a bit runny and won't set as well. I have made it about 10 times and EVERYONE loves it!

This was incredibly easy and tasty. I used a ready-made graham cracker pie crust, strawberries and a few fresh blueberries from the backyard. Will definitely be making this again and again!

Used the Vanilla Wafer Crust recipe on this site.  Layered cream cheese/pow sugar, then strawberries, then whip topping.  Next time I'll mix strawberries with cream cheese mixture, then top with whip topping, to help it stay together better.  Delicious, looking forward to making it again this weekend!!!

Used a frozen pie crust and piled it in.  Made no changes, and the strawberries kind of mashed up when I folded them in.  Very eye appealing because the filling is sky-high.  Will use with other fruits or oreos next time.  So easy, beautiful, and refreshing!  Thanks!

i thought this was a great recipe. it was super easy and didn't require too many ingredients or time. i was low on cream cheese so i used some sour cream (about 3 oz) and it turned out fine. plus i used a graham cracker crust which was a nice crunchy contrast to the creaminess of the filling. next i will probably mash up the strawberries a little bit and top with chocolate shavings and use 1/8 c less sugar. a very light yet satisfying dessert!

Well, for some reason the pie did not gel for me and it was runny.  I may have done something wrong, but I followed the directions thoroughly.  I may try something a bit different next time, but I wouldn't say it was a 5 star recipe.

This pie was extremely easy to make and so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, used a ready to eat graham cracker crust, and I used strawberries as well as rasberries. This was my first time making this pie and I used it for a potluck at work where we were having a pie contest and I won!! Very simply recipe with great results. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent Pie.  Easy to make and much to my surprise it was not to sweet.  We thought it would be at first glance, but not the case.  Very good pie.  We added a few kiwi's on top with the strawberries just for looks.

5 stars because it was soooo easy and delicious. It doesn't look super elegant, though, so I wouldn't necessarily make it to impress people. I used a chocolate graham cracker crust, which went well with the strawberry flavor. I didn't have confectioner's sugar so I just used Splenda. I was worried about the result, but it still came out great.

Yummy.  Don't tell the mil but my husband likes this strawberry pie better than hers.  The filling made enough for two pies.
