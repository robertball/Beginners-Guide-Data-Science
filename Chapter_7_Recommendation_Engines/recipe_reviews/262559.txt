Although I used less garlic, this recipe is pretty great. I will definitely use less lemon next time, though. But the method is perfect and so darn easy. There is no beating homemade, warm hummus. Yum. Thank you for the recipe.

The only thing I did wrong was I forgot to save the water so I ended up using just plain filtered water and it still came out amazing cannot wait to make it again the correct way. I made it the correct way and it blew my expectations, now I did make one change the third time I made it and I encourage anyone who loves garlic to try this its sweeter and also makes the garlic more milder, I roasted my garlic first then added it and OMG just so good, was a hit with the family
