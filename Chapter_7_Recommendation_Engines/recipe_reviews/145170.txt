My family LOVED this!  We had all the ingredients except avocado and we used homemade flour tortillas. It was very juicy so it was kind of a messy meal.

Delicious, if a little tomato-y. My boyfriend put away three in no time and asked me to make it again sometime soon. :)

I enjoyed this recipe. Best! Is it's fast! Holland House will be disappointed, I used Red Wine Vinegar instead. I also used Itallian style tomatoes. I didn't have any cumin but thought it could use just a little more chilli powder for twang. Yummy Good!

I followed this recipe exactly so I'm not sure what happened, but the flavor just wasn't there for us.  Thank goodness I was able to find some taco seasoning in the pantry to give this some sort of flavor (though obviously not the flavor I was hoping for).  I also ended up adding alot more fresh lime juice and fresh cilantro for more flavor.  Next time I will leave enough time to try a fajita marinade recipe.
