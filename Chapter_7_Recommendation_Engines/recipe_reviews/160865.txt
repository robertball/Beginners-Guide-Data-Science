I was really enthused about trying this because with all these great ingredients I thought I'd end up with something exceptional.  Truthfully?...  It wasn't until after I had finished the steak, which hubs grilled, that I remembered  I had marinaded it!  In other words, it's not that the marinade tastes bad, I just couldn't taste it at all!

Very tasty - Used in slow cooker with Lamb and cabernet sauvignon. Substituted sage for coriander and added Fig vinegar. Can't wait to try this with other meats-Thank you!

tasty but i think it had too much going on which is funny because i usually like marinades with a ton of different things in them. also the wine i used was getting old, would want to work with this one again.

My family liked the marinade (4 stars) but loved the suace (5 stars) that the simmered down portion made. I used an inexpensive Burgandy and omitted the coriander to suit my crew's tastes. Will use again!

Excellent!!  I used this to marinate pork chops and it was fantastic!  I had some leftover FETZER cabernet sauvignon to find a recipe for and chose this. I used 1/4 tsp. garlic powder in place of the minced garlic and omitted the cumin and coriander (added parsley instead). While grilling we sprinkled a little sea salt and coarse ground pepper over the tops.  This marinade recipe is a keeper for us.  Thanks for sharing!

I used sherry and low-sodium soy sauce and thought the taste was lacking, especially in salt content. Next time I'll add some salt or use regular soy sauce and a better red wine. Will also let sit in marinade overnight instead of a couple hours.

Excellent marinade. I used the dry substances as a rub and added coffee grounds to the mix. I also omitted the oil.  This is similar to a marinade I use regularly, I think I'll make this one my regular. Thank for sharing.

A+ Adelle, this is one terrific marinade for steaks!  I halved the recipe for two strip steaks & marinated about 10 hours.  They were so flavorful and moist, terrific!  I made exactly as written using a pinot noir.  This is a definite do over.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with AR.

I did as another reviewer suggested and used the dry ingredients as a rub. I would increase the portions of the dry stuff if you are going to do it this way. I used garlic salt instead of onion salt and it was very tasty. I made the rest of the marinade as a reduction and it was overpowering.

Made some changes: Omitted the cumin, backed off on the worchestershire, and used olive instead of canola oil.  Marinated mushrooms in it.. .Perfect! Making it a second time it helps to use a stronger more flavorful red wine.

Not bad, although I'm not sure the reduction was really worth it--neither bf nor I were that impressed.  Still, the sauce itself was a good way of tenderizing a tough piece of steak.  I'm no expert with steak, but bf made some of  it into chunks and served with the sauce as beef tips, and it was pretty good.  thanks for the recipe.

Very very good. Def used olive oil instead of canola. And i also used a dry red italian marsala wine. WOW. so good. So much more flavor and richer than your normal cab. Did the sauce afterwards, and if you actually know how to make a good reduction, it will come out great :)))) very nice. Good job lady.

The ingredients sounded like they should work well together and produce a great marinade. They don't. There was really no flavor after soaking for 24+ hours. Really disappointed!

The marinade by itself is fantastic, however after marinading for a day and basting on multiple occasions, I did not taste the marinade in the beef after it was done.  Perhaps that's a good thing, but it's as if the beef did not absorb the marinade.  Perhaps I should also cook the marinade afterwords and drizzle it over next time.

This recipe was great! I followed the recipe exactly and used Malbec for the wine. We made it with a trimmed tri-tip that we roasted in the oven on a rack. The end result was delicious. I am making this again so I decided to rate. This time I'm using a cabernet. The marinade tastes so good it could probably be used as a salad dressing as well.

Ditch the lemon juice for more Worcestershire sauce!
Use olive oil instead of boring canola!
And don't worry about coriander if you don't have any.

Friends were complementing these fabulous steaks!

Good but needs something.  Of course I didn't have any Worchestershire so perhaps that is why it didn't come out a 5 star.  Also used regular yellow mustard (wet not dry) and came out ok.  Needs modification or follow directly.
