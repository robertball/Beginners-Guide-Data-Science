This pie is great just the way it is, but if anyone has read my reviews, you know I can't leave well enough alone, so...  I added a box of dry instant lemon pudding for more body, then took lemon sandwich cookies, put them through my food processor to fine crumbs (where DOES that filling go??) then took 1 1/2 (or more) cups of the crumbs with about 5 TLB (or more) melted butter and made my crust out of that.  Then took a couple spoonfuls cookie crumbs and sprinkled on top.  AWESOME!!  (And I don't even like lemon pie). To be even more different, take 4 oz. softened cream cheese mixed well with 1/2 confectioner's sugar and spread this in the bottom of your chilled crust before putting in the lemon mixture.

The women in my family have been whipping this up for years and it is STILL a favorite at get togethers. It's also SO easy and quick that we tend to make it just to cure a sweet tooth!

To make it virtually fat free is simple. Use fat free Eagle Brand milk and fat free cool whip! Don't worry about the taste of the fat free Eagle Brand--it's DELISH! The consistency is a little bit thinner than regular EB, but when the pie's chilled, you can't tell a bit of difference!

We always have trouble finding the 6 oz can of lemonade, too. So we use a 12 oz and just make ourselves "suffer" through two pies;)

The filling of this pie is so good that we've often joked of just whipping it up and eating it as a pudding. Hey, a few crumbled graham crackers and I think it'd be a hit!

I made this pie for a club meeting and doubled the recipe to get 2 pies.  I used pink lemonade and added a dash of red food coloring to enhance the color.  My guests absolutely raved about it. I used purchased graham cracker crusts and had lots of filling to mound up.  I did not freeze it as others suggested and the texture was wonderful.  Not runny at all. One thing I did was to mix the condensed milk and lemonade thoroughly before adding the whipped topping. I will definitely make it again and would like to try lime concentrate next time.

This is achingly sweet, but always popular. Instead of a graham cracker crust, I usually make it with a homemade one consisting of 60 Ritz crackers, crushed, 1/2 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup powdered sugar combined and sprinkled in the bottom of a 9-inch square pan. It isn't firm like a graham cracker crust, but the salty/sweet combination is good with the tart/sweet filling.

Yummy! I used rasberry lemonade concentrate, fat free cool whip and froze the pie instead of just chilling it. To make sure the pie doesn't get soupy, chill the condensed milk and make sure the concentrate is still frozen.

Also known as "Eagle Brand" pie when I was a kid, this one is so easy and foolproof.  I agree with other reviewers that it tastes the best and has a better consistency if it is kept in the freezer. Also, like others have mentioned, a gingersnap crust works great with this pie.  For those who think the concentrate makes it too sweet, add some fresh squeezed lemon juice to subtitute for some of the concentrate for a tangier lemon taste.  After slicing, serve with fresh strawberries and blueberries--great for 4th of July!

I've been making this recipe for a few years now and it is requested for all holidays and get-togethers.  I love it because it's SO quick and easy.  I use a shortbread crust most of the time.

I only gave this four stars because I found it a too sweet.  Since I prefer a little more tartness to my lemon pies, I made this again using unsweeted whipped cream instead of the sweetened whipped topping.  Just whip two cups whipping cream until it makes soft peaks and fold into the sweetened condensed milk lemonade mixture.

YUMMY for lemon pie!!  Perfect recipe and sooo easy! My hubby isn't big on lemon pie, but man, oh man, I can eat this whole thing by myself! LOL! Use low fat condensed milk, lite whipped topping, and a low fat pie crust to make it better for you.

I have made this many times and everyone who has had it LOVED it. I have never had trouble with it being runny. I think if you mix it to much will make it runny.Also if you set your cool whip out to long the pie more than likely will not set up well.

This is an all-time favorite of mine.  I use 2 graham cracker crusts, get a large & small tub of whipped cream, and grate lemon zest & squeeze the juice from the lemon into the mixture.  People always rave about this!

This was a great recipe.  My son was a little zealous and added a whole can of the concentrate, so I added a box of lemon pudding and lemon gelatin to return it to a normal consistency and froze the pies before serving.   Ended up with enough for two pies.  I also added a layer of blueberries and lemon curd to the bottom of one pie shell and a layer of cherry preserves to the bottom of the other pie shell.  We loved it!

This is a fantastic, easy & quick recipe.  I wanted something for get togethers that wouldn't take a lot of time to prepare.  This is something that you can take the ingredients with you and and make while you are there and it will be fresh.  I've made it at work and it didn't last long.

the measurements are off. You actually need 12oz of the cool whip to give it the desired firmness without having to freeze it overnight. I also made my own crust and added the zest of one lemon.

I just made this lemonade pie for the second time and ACCIDENTALLY used evaporated (non-sweetened) milk. This turned out to be a wonderful mistake, because I was then able to control the sweetness of this pie with adding honey until the desired sweetness. When I'd made this pie previously, the sweetness but just too much, although still delicious.

My sister & I made this pie for the 4th.  We thought the lemonade sounded to sweet, so we used  6 oz of juice instead.  We made one lime and one lemon.  They were wonderful!!  Love the tart sweetness!

Made it with Limeade and garnished with lime zest. Amazing!!! 
Made a double batch after buying a 12oz juice mix and had pie filling left over after over filling 2 9" graham crusts. I have to shame. I ate the left over filling with graham crackers like a dip... I'll be using this recipe for summers to come. 
For an all adult party, I'll use the limeade and some tequila and add garnish of sea salt. Delicious!

Pi day is tomorrow for all you math geeks!  This is what my daugther will be taking to share with her math class. I've made this recipe for years. I use the fat free cool whip and fat free eagle brand as well and it's still delicious. I also always make 2 since it's hard to find the smal lemonade. When I'm taking food to a family in the summer months, this is my go to dessert. I take one for the family and keep one for us! Kids and adults like it!

I gave this 4 stars, rather than 5, because the recipe should make it clear that this pie should be served frozen.  I served it thawed, but stored in the refrigerator, and it was a soupy mess.  My guests didn't finish their servings and neither did I. There were two slices left which I put back into the freezer.  My husband and I had them the next night and the texture and flavor was fabulous!

I love this pie.... When I found out how easy and YUMMY it is,  I decided to try this same basic recipe with other juice concentrates...  I have used the pink lemonade, apple juice, lime, and orange.

Easy to make...Even easier to devour!!!  Made for a BBQ and everyone asked for the recipe.  I was embarrassed to admit it was so easy:)  Only change I made?  A gingersnap crust.  I felt with the lemon-flavor it needed something a bit stronger-flavored than graham crackers.

This recipe is excellent! If you prefer key lime pie,It works well using limeade instead of lemonade.It also freezes well.

I took this pie to a party and no one believed it had only three ingredients (not counting the crust!) and took less than ten minutes to make. Incredibly lemony and smooth! Also, this pie has a great glossy finish, so it looked as good as it tasted.

Very easy, and yummy!  After reading other comments about the sweetness, added just over a teaspoon of lemon zest, gave it a nice zing.  Had about a cup of filling left over after filling the crust, layered it in parfait cups with fresh strawberries, blue berries and raspberries.....perfect Summer dessert!   Next time I'll make a double batch of filling just to serve with berries.

This was an awesome pie loved by all!  Thinking it might be too sweet after reading the other reviews, I did swap out the graham cracker crust for an easy baked crust of 1 cup flour, 2tbsp Splenda and 6 TBSP butter.  It was perfect!  Must be kept frozen, IMO.  I will be making this again soon!!!

This is one of my favorite summer dessert recipes.  Sometimes we make it at work, since there are only 4 ingredients.  It needs to chill for several hours in the freezer to firm up.  I recommend freezing it overnight if possible.

This was okay.  I did make it with crushed lemon cookies for the crust as another suggested and added lemon instant pudding to the filling but it still didn't seem lemony enough.  I'll make it again on a hot day but it's not one of our favorites.

This was ok.  It was too sweet for my taste.  I've heard from other friends who have made this but used the dry lemonade powder mix and they said it wasn't sickeningly sweet.  Will probably do that next time.

Oh, just delightful.  So EASY yet so good!  My hubby doesn't even really like lemonade and he gobbled this up.  I know there are other recipes out there with cream cheese but I think I like the really light texture of this pie without it.  Great dessert for summer picnics or weeknights with the family.  Thanks!

This was average for me.  I loved the simplicity of this recipe and the taste was okay but the pie didn't set up properly.  When I cut individual servings, the filling slowly traveled away from the crust.  I was expecting more of a firm slice of pie.

I really liked this dessert and so did DH, but others who tried it just thought it to be so so. Earlier in the day I sliced strawberries,added sugar and let them sit in the fridge and then topped each piece with a spoonful. I liked a berry with each bite but it was also good on its own. A great dessert on a hot day.

This was yummy!  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan (with homemade graham cracker crust) to serve a crowd.  I put it in the freezer and took it out just before serving... very light & refreshing after chili for dinner...

I've been making this pie for 30 yrs!!  You should use 1/2 of the 12oz frozen lemonade for pie and prepare the rest in a pitcher to drink. Just don't forget to add only 1/2 the water called for when making lemonade.  I've always used 12oz Cool Whip and never had a problem with it setting up.  In fact, if I worked too slow, it would start setting up before I was finished.  Can't seem to find 12oz Cool Whip anymore so I buy (2) 8oz and save leftovers.  I have always been able to get (2) 6oz graham cracker pies out of one of my batches of filling.  I also add a little red food color and lemon juice to taste because of the extra Cool Whip added and because I like it tart!!

I gave this 3 stars because it doesn't really seem like a "pie". The flavor reminds me a lot of a key lime pie, which I love. The consistency however is a bit strange.  I suppose for the ingredients used it set just how it should have. I ended up putting the rest in the freezer to try to firm it up a bit. Next time I'll try adding a pack of lemon flavor pudding... or maybe just sticking to key lime pie.

a kid pleaser, but nothing special.  great desserts disappear in two days at our house, and this one was around for almost a week.  i had just one piece and never went back for more.  it wasn't bad, just not worth the calories!  sort of like having lemon pudding on a graham cracker crust (not exactly, but along those lines).  won't make it again.  maybe i just don't like lemon icebox pie, but i love lemons, so i thought i'd enjoy this one more.

I made this for a work lunch using a ginger snap crust (crushed ginger snaps and one stick of melted butter) and doubled the rest of the ingredients for a 9x13 inch pan.  Everyone loved it and couldn't believe how easy it was!  This will be my summer dessert!

So easy! I make this pie all the time for church gatherings, using different frozen juice concentrates and adding fresh fruit on top... limeade/kiwi, pink lemonade/strawberries, orange/banana, etc.  With the variety of juice flavors available, you can easily make this one of your "signature" desserts.

I used fat free everything, but ran into a problem with the juice concentrate.  Instead of lemonade, I used fruit punch, and like many others I could only locate the 11 ounce can.  I used just half of it, but the pie still came out WAY too sweet.  I'd try it again but use MUCH less concentrate, because even with all the sweetness the potential for a fabulous dessert was obviuos.

This is a great summertime pie. I topped mine with sliced strawberries. It was wonderful. Next time, I'll do two layers strawberries and filling. I brushed melted butter on the pie crusts and baked for 8 minutes in a 350 degree oven. It came out very crispy.

This is an excellent recipe!  Two years ago I had lemonade pie down in Louisiana at a seafood restaurant.  I had never heard of it before, but loved it.  The restaurant wouldn't give me the recipe and I feared I would never have it again.  I was thrilled to find this receipe.  It is super easy and delicious.

Delicious!!!! One review mentioned adding cream cheese for a richer texture, so I beat the condensed milk and lemonade with 8 ounces of softened cream cheese, then proceeded as directed. One thing - maybe my crusts were oversized or something, because there wasn't enough filling for two pies, even with the cream cheese added. I made one pie plus a small ramekin of "crust less" pie. The hubs has already asked me to make the pie again!

My Granny was NOT a cook, but she was known for these pies. They are so simple and yummy! I have always made them exactly this way, but I ALWAYS divide the mixture between 2 regular 9" pie crusts. It always seems filled an ample amount and it keeps it from being TOO much sweetness in a slice. We love it. Thanks for sharing this recipe so I can keep it in my Allrecipes album!

This is a wonderful pie!!  I have been making it for years and since I have never been able to find a 6 oz. can of frozen lemonade concentrate I always just buy  a 12 oz. and make 2 pies when I make it.  I also use a low fat graham cracker crust, the fat free sweetened condensed milk and fat free cool whip to make it as light as I can.  My family has no clue, they just love it.  I do freeze it and keep it stored in the freezer so it is really cool and refreshing.

I love this pie.  I like to put extra lemon in it so it is lemony.

VERY SWEET but excellent and SUPER EASY! Doubling the wet ingredients makes three pies (so buy three pie shells)--plenty for gifting! :D Oh, and I used Raspberry Lemonade and Pineapple juice (for one of each and one half/half pie). The Raspberry Lemonade was phenomenal! Can't wait to experiment with other flavors. Will definitely make again... and again!

I found this to be light, refreshing and easy.  Great for a summer BBQ etc.  BUT  I made the mistake of wanting to make 32 tarts and thinking that since the original recipe served 8 that I wanted to multiply everything by 4.  Well I ended up with almost 100 tarts.  Otherwise wonderful.

The recipe was easy but did not have a good taste.  It tasted like you were eating a tub of cool whip with a lemony twist.  It also did not set up well unless you put it in the freezer.

This recipe is extremely easy and cheap to make! I personally thought it was a bit too sour and the lemon taste overpowered the graham cracker flavor - to where I couldn't taste it at all- but everyone else in the family LOVED it, so I guess I am just the wierd one! I actually had to double this recipe too, because I couldn't find 6 oz frozen lemonade. The sell mini graham cracker pie crust for individual little pies and I used those so we wouldn't have to deal with cutting slices - really cool!

Great taste like a fluffy lemon meringue pie, however couldn't stand the consistency. It's really a pudding not a pie, and will not harden even with hours of refrigeration! I will make it again but substitute creame cheese in place of one of the ingridents to make it more "pie-like". Enjoy.

My grandmother used to make this delicous pie, but she substituted limeade for the lemonade.  I also used the Lite Cool Whip instead.  It's perfect for a cool, summer dessert!  AND it's the easiest thing in the world to make!

This is absolutely the EASIEST pie to make and it is a WONDERFUL complement to any spring or summer dinner!  Just the right amount of delicious tart lemon to complement the sweetness of the filling.  My grandmother made this pie years ago and it still remains a family favorite!

It doesn't get any easier than this pie. I didn't change a thing, but had a little filling left over. I ate some of that...and it's a good thing I did because I didn't get one piece of the pie!

This is a fantastic pie. The only change I make is to use a crust made of crushed gingersnaps. Always a hit. Once when a friend and her family stayed with us, we were surprised to find that the second pie -- about a third of a pie -- was gone. My friend's husband had devoured it. "It was just one piece,"  he said. LOL!

I was looking for a copy of this recipe because I couldn't remember the proportions...but I had made it before with lemon juice (the bottled kind) instead of frozen juice mix. I don't know--I would think that the mix would make it too sweet...just a suggestion if you tried this and thought it was "too much." But this is such a great recipe (espeically for summertime) and it's so quick and easy! Enjoy!

I made two of these pies with orange juice concentrate. They were delicious and refreshing! I believe the recipe should say to chill in the freezer.

I have been making a variation of this pie for a long time.  My family prefers more tart than sweet, so I use 2 graham cracker crusts, 12 oz. frozen lime or lemonade, 12 oz. whipped topping and 1 can sweetened condensed milk.  I mix the juice and condensed milk thoroughly then fold in the whipped topping.  Divide into the 2 pie shells and freeze.  Popular pie for warn weather dessert.

This substance is very, very, very addictive! 

It's amazing. I don't even use a crust. I just serve it as a kind of pudding type thing with a dollop of whipped cream on top. They're adorable in the little mini graham cracker crust pie crusts though.

I am giving a 5 star based on the pie as I made it, which was with significant modifications.  I bought the 10-inch pre-made graham cracker crust.  I started with a softened package of cream cheese, and mixed with my paddle attachment with 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons of lemon extract.  I put 3/4 of that mixture in the bottom of the pie crust, and left the remaining 1/4 in the mixing bowl.  Then I added 1/2 cup of pure lemon juice with a can of sweetened condensed milk into the cream cheese mixture in the mixing bowl, and mixed until smooth.  I then folded in an 8oz tub of thawed cool whip (I used a generic store brand).  I then added that to the pie mix.  I topped with a little over half an 8 oz tub of cool whip, until the pie crust was filled.   I put the pie in the freezer overnight, and took it out about 15 minutes before serving.  The pie was amazing, and everyone loved it.  I left it outside thereafter, and it stayed firm (did not become a puddle).  I life in Miami and this was for a labor day barbeque, and the pie was fine being left outside on the table with the other food.   I had blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries on the side for people to garnish as they liked, but I had it without the berries.  It was very easy to make, delicious, and I can think of a million different flavors to make it in.  Definitely will be using again.

I grew up with this recipe and I am a grandmother of 2 teenagers, so it has been in the family for quite a while.  The only difference is that we only use 4 ounces of whipped topping, but then we usually like things more lemony than the recipes call for.  That is why I only give it 4 stars.  It is super good with 4 ounces of whipped topping!

The taste of this dessert took me back half a century! Looked in my mother's cookbook, and there it was.   We wanted enough for only four people (I don't need to eat all the leftover pie), so I used the no-bake graham cracker crust from Allrecipes.com (delicious) - and made eight single units of dessert in ramekins.  Froze the other four, and had it again a week later.  It froze well.

Very sweet and lemon-y...just what we were looking for.  I made the crust from lemon cookies instead of using graham cracker though.  Might try the graham cracker next time.  Also added a little food coloring to make it more yellow.

Yeah, don't know where you can find a 6oz. can of lemonade...so I just got the 12oz. and split it.  Make sure you use a good quality crust.  You can ruin this pie if you skimp on the crust quality..i.e., generic brand.  Very tasty, otherwise!  Like lemon ice cream!

My husband's grandmother is famous for her lemon pies.  I have never been able to make one my husband likes until now.  He loves this pie.  I did add sugar free dry lemon pudding for better consistency.  Then used a ritz cracker crust like his grandmother does.  He ate the whole pie and was asking for another!   This is a keeper!!

I made these in mini-graham cracker crusts because that's all I had. After first making them they were way too sweet and way too tart (almost inedible), but after letting them sit for 24 hours they were delicious. I followed the advise of a reviewer and put a cream cheese / sugar mixture on the bottom, but I thing they would be 5 stars regardless. Update: I had some mixture left over, so I froze it, and when I tried it alone it tasted vaguely like lime sherbert. I think next time I will just cut the pie step out altogether!

Absolutely wonderful pie...Make sure you don't use the WHOLE 12 ounce container like I did. You end up with lemonade soup pie...So the second time around, I made it right and it was a huge hit. The only adjustment I made was I used a homemade graham cracker crust. 8 big crackers (24 "squares") with roughly 1/2 a cup of butter (for a deep 9 inch pan)...In the oven at 350 for 8 minutes. The salted butter gives it a nice buttery flavor mixed with the fruity taste from the lemonade. Enjoy!

My mom has been making this pie for 30 years and I've been making it just about as long.  This is the original and best lemonade pie out there!  It couldn't be easier and if you want to make it look nice you can add very thin lemoon slices to the top outside edge for a garnish.

I've been making this for years, with a few changes.  I use pink lemonade, and add a little bit of pink food coloring.  The bright pink pie looks really cute.  Also, FREEZE IT, don't put it in the fridge.  When frozen, it tastes like a delicious, tart, ice cream pie.  Yummy!

A great summertime dessert! I accidentally added a whole large can of lemonade, don't do that. :) Unbelievably it still got eaten, it was like pudding though. VERY YUMMY!!

Delicious and easy.  I made it after work and it was so fast and turned out delicious.  I only had fat free condensed milk on hand and it turned out great.  Next time I might use fat free cool whip as well.  Very good.

We loved this pie!  I doubled the recipe to make two pies. We had none left. Thanks for a great tasting & EASY pie. I made the pies the day before & they froze nicely. :)

Our family calls this Lemon Icebox Pie.  We've made it for years.  It is so easy, refreshing and tasty!

Yummy! Crisp, refreshing and TART. Very nice end to a summer meal.  I made the recipe as stated. The pie doesn't get really firm, even after chilling over night. Recipe is a keeper.

I had been looking for this recipe because a friend of mine used to make this all the time. So easy and so good!  I always have a difficult time finding 6 oz frozen lemonade so I end up getting the bigger size (12 oz?). I always use all of it anyway, and I don't think it is too tart.
