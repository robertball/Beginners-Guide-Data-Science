My family really loved this recipe!! Even my 4,5,&,6 year olds liked it!! It was easy too. The flavors were a bit flat though. I don't know why because the taco packet, salsa, and cream soup are flavored. Prob would make again:), but would add cilantro, or maybe Swiss cheese! Mmmmmm

These were really good!  Mild enough as written that my 6 year old enjoyed them too.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for my husband and I last night and it was delicious! I changed the 1/2 cup salsa to 1/4 cup salsa + 1/4 cup hot taco sauce. I used black bean refried beans with roasted red jalapenos and a hot and spicy taco seasoning. I also used light sour cream instead of regular sour cream and it still came out perfect. Then on top of the cheese I added some chipotle seasoning. It gave it the perfect amount of spice and lots of flavor. It seems like this is a good recipe to play around with and add whatever you like. I will definitely make these again!

Great! I only made two changes--cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom soup, and less cheese on top. My picky eater (3.5 years old) didn't care for it, but my 5 and 1 year olds gobbled it up. My hubby loved it and had to resist after his third or so helping. :D Thank you for sharing!

We loved this! I subbed black beans for the refried beans (what I had in the pantry) and it was really good! I bet refried beans would be delicious as well! I've already made this recipe twice!

The burritos were super soggy and mushy. I did not enjoy this recipe at all. I only gave it a 2 because it was quick.

I wanted to make something simple with what I already had and this is the recipe I tried, it was easy to do and burritos turned out great, my husband and 3 teens all liked them, however I did add rice - only change I made.

This was great with the following changes:   To the ground beef add; 2 tsp of Cumin powder and Ancho Chili Powder along with the taco seasoning packet.   Chopped garlic is a must and I used about a Tbsp and a handful of fresh cilantro and a chopped bell pepper.   To the sauce;  I used one 7oz can of Salsa Ranchero plus approx  1/4 Cup of Picante.  Without these changes the recipe would have been bland.

I would have given this four stars but I omitted the soup. My family prefers it that way. In addition, if adding soup and baking it becomes an enchilada. All of the ingredients except for the soup is the way  I typically make a fast ground beef filling for burritos. Throw the tortillas over the gas flame for a few seconds each and serve with sour cream and salsa on the side.

This is very good. It made a lot more than 6 though, which is a  good thing. (Maybe my tortillas were smaller than 9")  I made about 9 burritos and still had a little bit of meat left over, so I put it on top of the burritos before adding the sauce and cheese. I did sub black beans for the refried beans. Add some coleslaw and you've got an easy-to-make weeknight dinner.

Yum!  Add salsa on top for extra spice and freshness.

This was so much better than I expected! I generally avoid using "cream of" soups. I was in a rush so I used cream of chicken (cream of mushroom isn't my favorite) and it worked out quite well. In the future, I'd probably make my own cream sauce with crema, beef stock, and some cumin, then thicken a bit with a roux. However, on the quick, cream of whatever works well. It had a lot of flavor and even the kids ate it-- and had seconds! (A minor miracle...). Would also be great using chicken or piccadillo.

I used corn tortillas and it was very tasty!!  Kiddos enjoyed it very much, as they had 2nd's & 3rd's.  This is a keeper and I'll definitely be making again.

Easy and good. They are great to freeze and better than store bought frozen burritos. Good for what they are!

I followed the receipe exactly and it turned out really good.  Was a little worried about the topping but it was great!  Will make this again.
