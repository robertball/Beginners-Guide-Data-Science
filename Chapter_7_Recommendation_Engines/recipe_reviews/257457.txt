I tweaked this recipe a bit, and the result was AMAZING!
Instead of lemon zest, I used a little True  Lemon (crystallized lemon), and WOW!!!  I added a couple of slices of hard boiled egg, a light sprinkling of sea salt.....mmmmmm!!!

This is truly delicious. I've always used lime on avocado toast. What a head slapper of a recipe. Thank you for sharing.

This ESHA rating is off.  An avocado is 21 g of fat per cup, bread is 72 cal per slice.

This was delicious. The zest adds a lot of flavor. I used a whole avocado (1/2 avocado per slice of toast) and topped each one with a fried egg for a very satisfying breakfast.

I love how lemony this recipe is. The zest and cayenne were nice and even though you don’t really taste the chia seeds they made a nice garnish.

Omg this was AMAZING. I literally just finished eating it and did not want to tarry in writing my review. This was my first time trying avocado toast and I must say I’m glad I chose this recipe to try! The flavors were a wowzer in my mouth; I followed the recipe exactly. On one of the slices I put a fried egg on top......yummy yummy yummy! It’s excellent both ways. Use a nice sized avocado so it will be enough for both slices. 5 stars!!

Very nice mix of flavors. We did not have chia seeds. Used ground pumpkin seeds. Our fresh lemon overpowered the other flavors, so we will try again with less lemon and more of the other ingredients. Definite plus to our breakfast options. Weill make it again

I'm an avocado toast addict and let me just say, the lemon zest adds a whole new dimension. A great recipe with many options. I used garlic salt, cilantro and toasted sesame seeds. Thank you princessofmontecito for sharing this recipe.

We enjoyed this healthy recipe. Note that you need to zest the lemon; I didn't see that until after I had juiced it. We have a Meyer lemon tree so this will be a great way to use them - would also be fantastic with fresh lime juice. If you wanted something more decadent, a fried egg or bacon would make delicious additions. We doubled the avocado portion of the recipe and would do that again next time.

I was surprised how good this was!
I had never tried Avocado Toast before so I looked up a recipe for it and this one sounded good.
 I didn’t have any cilantro so I substituted parsley (cilantro would have been better) 
Used fresh squeezed lemon juice and butter on the toast.
This would be good on a bagel too, I will definitely make it again!

Made this in the spur of the moment for a light Sunday night supper. I didn’t have the cilantro, but even so, it was fantastic. The lemon zest and juice made it taste extra fresh and bright.

The avocado spread was perfect, but next time I will double the recipe for two pieces of toast. I also added an over-easy egg, crumbled Nueske's bacon and finely chopped red onion on top of the avocado spread.

Good and gives it a nice twist. I didn’t expect to like the chia seeds on it, but it just gives it the slightest pop.

Followed the recipe exactly except quadrupled the quantity for my group.  Everyone loved it!  It has a nice texture and delicious flavor.  It was super easy as well.
I did not have chia seeds but as the contributor suggested, went with sesame seeds to top.
I served with bacon and cheese and some guests made a hearty sandwich.  
Thank you for the yummy recipe.

Toast the seeds in a dry pan over medium heat for about 3 min to release the aromatic oils and get rid of any humidity.  Don't burn them. Use saute (jumping) technique if possible.

Delicious!  Since discovering this recipe I've tried all kinds of variations.  They all worked well.  I especially  like it with green onions.  I actually go to bed thinking about having a delicious breakfast in the morning.
