This is an excellent recipe.  I unfortunately learned the hard way--the recipe calls for a LOT of couscous compared to how much sauce there is.  However, it's still pretty good this way.  Changes I made: Used more garlic, flounder instead of tilapia, diced fresh tomato, cayenne pepper (not too much) instead of red pepper, more red wine and less water.  In the future, I think I'll use even more garlic and cut out the ginger.  I like ginger, but I personally don't like it with these spices.  What I like about this is that the fish isn't the star of this dish--I think there's as much fish in here as vegetables; you could add more fish to this or cut it out completely and it would still taste good.  This seems like a good recipe to experiment with, change around, have fun with.

I made this last night with some substitutions for my wife and daughter. We all thought it was a great meal. My wife loved the spicy kick while my daughter thought it was too spicy.  She put some mild cheddar cheese on it to reduce the spiciness. It worked and she loved it. My wife put some "Red Hot Chile Lime Hot Sauce" on her serving. This added even more good flavor to the dish so I'd recommend that as well. 

Substitutions:
1) Marinated artichoke hearts with frozen artichoke hearts thawed in cold water. Chopped in food processor before adding to stew.
2)2 tbls of wine with 1/2 cup of wine as recommended by other reviewer. Great idea!
3)1 tsp of cumin with 1/2 tsp chili powder. We had no cumin but websites noted that chili powder has cumin as an ingredient and advised that we use half of the requested amount. 

Omitted:
1) Green Olives - Didn't have any available but would have been omitted anyway due to high sodium content.
2) Sumac Powder - This will be added to my grocery list so that I can experience how this powder actually impacts the dish.

If you have kids, I would recommend reducing the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp instead of the 1 1/2 requested or just omit. You would then be able to put the amount of flakes you desire on your own serving without having to worry about the spiciness.

Wonderful, tasty dish that's easy and quick to make.And it's great as leftovers! I followed others' recommendations and made just a few changes.  First, unless you can handle a whole lot of heat, I would strongly advise cutting the crushed red pepper down significantly.  I cut it from 1 1/2 tsp to 1/2 tsp, and it was still pretty intense so I now reduce to 1/4 tsp and leave crushed red pepper on the table for others to use if they'd like more heat.  Usually no one adds any.  Second, add more wine, if it's available.  Third, throw in a handful of golden raisins at the end. Fourth, reduce the couscous by half to keep a reasonable ratio of couscous to stew. Fifth, use veggie stock instead of water in both the couscous and the stew.  Sixth, for fish, I have had success with various flaky white fish: tilapia, perch, cod, haddock, and flounder.   I have no preference; I simply choose what is fresh and wild caught.

Wanted to make it again the next day.  Can't get tilapia in Japan so had to  substitute cod.  2 tbsp of wine?!  No point in opening a bottle for that so I probably put in a good 1/2 cup plus!  Made excellent lunch the next day, too.

I was surprised at how much I liked this.  I only added 1 t. of pepper flakes which made the heat tolerable.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I just used diced and they were fine.  Also, I had a bag of pollock in my freezer and it was really good, so I figured I saved myself about five dollars on this dish.  I would probably halve the amount of couscous next time.

I didn't have sumac and substituted the following: rice for the couscous and chicken broth for the water. It was a delightful dish and I'm sure, had I had the proper ingredients on hand, it would have been absolutely outstanding. It's a keeper!

This was fantastic. The taste is completely unique. It needs to be recipe of the day so more people can try it.   I didn't have ginger or sumac on hand, so I'm not sure what those add.  Personally, I would cut down on the lemon juice or not include it at all. Otherwise, excellent!

Excellent. As a Northwest native, I'm not overly fond of tilapia and other freshwater fish (though it does hold up beautifully to this tpe of cooking), but I bought a whole bunch of it on sale so I was looking for a recipe to use it in that might make it more appealing to me. This one works. I had a hard time finding sumac, so I gave up looking. I read on the internet that, while there is no really good sub for sumac, lemon pepper would be an acceptable exchange, with paprika for color, so that's what I did. I followed the rest of the stew instructions except I doubled the artichokes and used red bell pepper along with the green. When finished, the broth was delicious but a little too sharp for me, so I smoothed it out with some chicken broth. I made boxed garlic and olive oil couscous as the accompaniment. Thanks for the recipe - I'd also like to try it using cod or halibut. :)

This dish was quite tasty.  I agree that it is better if you use much less couscous when serving.

I didn't add white wine because we didn't have any in the house, but I did add a 1/2 cup of golden raisins as suggested by another reviewer.  This dish was so good that the aroma wafted its way to the condo upstairs and my neighbor knocked on our door to tell me that whatever I was making smelled fabulous.  I invited my neighbor to be the first to taste the fish stew, and the review was thumbs up.  I didn't hesitate letting my neighbor be the first to taste test this recipe because I knew that the combined ingredients would be fabulous together.   There are just enough leftovers for one lunch serving.  I'm looking forward to making this again.  It's a lovely stew for my fall and winter menu.

The whole family really liked this stew. I used cod; did not add any wine or lemon juice. It was fine over the couscous, but next time I think I'll just serve it with a good french bread.

I made this for Ramadan and like noticed by another review alcohol is forbidden in Islam so I substituted white grape juice.  It turned out fantastic!

My husband made this in Dec.  It was so good we are planning on serving it to guests.  He used Ono for the fish, and I found the sumac powder at Penzeys Spices.  Next time we will cut the red pepper flakes to 3/4 tea. and have them on the table if people want a hotter stew.  I like the idea of using more wine, which we will do next time.

Excellent Turkish fish stew.  I just returned from a Turkish holiday and wanted to continue with the delicious food.  We did not finish all the stew so the next day I added 12 cherry tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon ground pepper and 2 dozen cherrystone clams.   Cooked until the clams opened.   Served with crusted bread.  Ummm good.

Loved this recipe! I am not a big fish lover, but there are so many other flavors in this so it wasn't too "fishy."  Even my four-year-old ate it.  Thank you for sharing this!

thought this was absolutely delicious!  i omitted a couple of items (capers, olives, ginger) to suit my own personal taste - but still thought it was awesome.  also, insted of couscous, i served it over basmati rice.  will definitely be putting this into regular dinner rotation!

This is delicious and easy to make. I found sumac at a nearby mediterranean store. I followed the recipe except I substituted veg. broth for the water, and next time I will add more to make it more "soupy", I also used half of the cous cous. My husband and I both loved this.

Love this recipe. My husband gets happy when he sees me beginning to make this. I omitted sumac powder too, since I couldn't find it, and I also add more wine. I am a vegetarian, so I use t.v.p. instead of fish, and add extra water to hydrate it. This recipe is definitely a huge hit for my house!

The capers and the artichoke hearts are what made this not to my liking. Mainly the taste of the capers, though. I wasted so much time on this for a meal that was not to my liking. My dad thought it was ok, so did my mother, they said that but nobody was begging for more either. Also they thought it was too much heat with the red pepper flakes, but I didn't mind it. When you're dealing with fish and making stews and things out of it the balance of the taste has to be perfect, and I the funny thing is I actually thought the strong flavors balanced one another, I just didn't like them.

I made this fish stew a few weeks back and thought it was excellent.  I did not have  sumac powder so I added additional lemon juice.  I decided to make the recipe again this week, and instead of tilapia,  I used 1/3 pound of haddock, 1/2 pound of bay scallops, 1/2 pound of shrimp and 6 jonas crab claws.  The shrimp were deveined and frozen and I threw them in shells on for additional flavor and then peeled shells to the tail once cooked. This variation on the original recipe proved to be delicious..  Next time I will experiment with blue mussels.  I will me making this often...great recipe...thanks for sharing!

I used red bell pepper instead and added a teaspoon more of ginger. I also added three more tablespoons of wine and added about a tablespoon of curry powder. This was soooooo good!! I wish I could have leftovers but everyone ate everything! I'm going to have to make this again. This is going to be one of those recipes I'm going to crave!

This was so great!  Next time I will try a blend of black and green olives, as I think some kalamata olives would really add to this dish.  Yes, there was a lot of couscous but you can just use the suggested servings on your couscous container to make as much as you want.  We doubled the recipe of the stew but kept the couscous amount the same, and there was enough.  I will be making this for my family on Thanksgiving weekend since it was so easy to double and so delicious!

This was excellent! A keeper for sure.  I followed the instructions  but also took one of the reviewers advice: I omitted the green pepper (future I would just use red). I doubled the onion, swapped veggie boullion in 1 cup water vs just plain water. I used a little more white wine, same amount of lemon, basil, cumin, etc. I used garlic in place of ginger and cayenne pepper in place of red chili flakes. I used castelvatrano olives as I did not have any martini /green olives.  I used pollock wild caught fish.  I did not have couscous so I used Quinoa and it was awesome!

Wow this is a great fish stew recipe! I used rockfish instead, didn't add sumac (couldn't find it at local store) otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The artichoke and the capers add a great dimension. mmm

Fresh basil! And it's probably totally wrong of me, but I added some cream because I thought it was too acidy. Will be making this a lot!

Quick and easy 
Made it several times with some variations. 
For example added  chickpeas and removed the peppers.

Had to modify due to lack of all of the ingredients. Used a can of diced tomatoes with green peppers, didn't have the peppers. Used stuffed green olives. Ginger power instead of fresh ginger. No sumac power on hand and no red pepper flakes, like but cannot take spicy hot food. Added a cup of sundry tomatoes, had them on hand and wanted to get rid of them. Served over rice. With all the changes it was still something I would serve to guests. Will keep the recipe.

Incredibly delicious! Man, this recipe is a keeper! I couldn't find the sumac, so I used lemon pepper instead. Also watch the water. I had to add 2 tsps of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  Changes I made:  substituted curry for the cumin,  used leftover couscous from another meal, used flounder (what I had on hand).  I adapted it for use in my Instant Pot pressure cooker.  We liked the flavor combinations.

Exceeded my expectations! Left out the capers as a matter of personal preference. I added some pumpkin chunks which added just a hint of sweetness to compliment the sour. BF who doesn't like olives gave it two thumbs up! Definitely going into my regular rotation!

I made this last night for five very thankful Turkish friends, who ate like they were on the show Naked and Afraid.  Then they went back for seconds.  It was very good.  I did do a couple things different.  First I used whole Red Snapper and simmered the head and bones (some of the meat left on them) with the seasonings, garlic and some of the onion. Strained that. Then I followed the recipe (doubled).

Made this with a few tweaks, as I did not have capers or sumac on hand.  I substituted lemon pepper for the sumac and black pepper, and used swai for the fish.  This was absolutely delicious - flavorful, with quite a bit of heat.  I might just dial down the red pepper flakes next time, but the sweetness of the onions, peppers and tomatoes works nicely with the tartness of the artichokes and lemon, and the spice mixture adds warmth and richness.  Nice comfort food for a cool evening.  Super easy to put together, too.  I served this over rice, as we had no couscous on hand, and paired it with some warm naan.

Don't like it as spices so paired back on red pepper lakes. Also, added more olives and capers.

This is shockingly good.  I would never think of a fish stew but the husband liked it as did I. Will definitely make again. The calorie count isn't too bad either.

I followed the directions exactly except I left out the olives and capers because I don't like them, and it came out perfect. This is going into the weekly rotation!

I came home with a bunch of sumac from our trip to turkey and I found this recipe while looking for new things to do with it.  So glad I did!  I've made this using both tilapia and cod and served with cous cous if a lot less than what's called for.  I used 1/2 cup dry with 1 cup of chicken broth.  I've been trying to add more fish to our diet and this was a very different way to do it.

Great flavor and filling without being heavy. Two cups of couscous and I doubled the fish - perfect ratio. I had only frozen tilapia fillets - I would prefer something in a thicker cut next time to let the fish really come through. Upped to 1/4 cup of wine; my sumac had expired so I added about 1/2 tsp tumeric in it's place and added a bit extra cumin since I had the extra fish. Used diced tomatoes as noted, chicken consomme as water and omitted the ginger... I will definitely make this again.

I made this as a soup, so ate it as is, without the couscous. Absolutely Gorgeous. I skipped the capers, used some apple juice instead of the wine and threw in some shrimp and salmon as well to make a beautiful fish stew. Very forgiving recipe and easy to play around with, even if you're missing some of the ingredients. But follow the recipe to the letter and I assure you the end result will be delicious.

Very tasty and easy to make. Artichokes juice makes it too acidic though. Next time I would only take drained artichokes or would skip a lemon juice. I also added a teaspoon of sugar. Overall a great recipe.

So good and easy, too! Forgot to get white wine, and I'm sure it would have been better with it, but it was still delicious. Also didn't have any sumac powder, but never use it so not sure how the taste would have been different. Didn't add ginger based on other reviews - I think it would have competed with the capers and olives. Such a great tasty recipe!

This dish was superb. I didn't have any sumac so I googled substitutions. A little lemon pepper and paprika seemed to work. I used a cup of white wine and 5 cups of water.also some sodium free chicken boulion powder. I made this more of a soup base then it seems to be with the cous cous. I eyeballed some extra seasoning to make up for the extra liquid. I used frozen tilapia and mussels. I made these mods because I am on a low carb diet. All in all this is a great base recipe. I do think the recomended red pepper is too much. It was perfect for me but I added alot more water. Good luck making this your own. It worked great for me.
