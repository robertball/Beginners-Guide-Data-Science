We thoroughly enjoyed this meal.  I substituted skim milk and reduced fat crescent rolls to lower the calories, and it was still delicious.  Though, I will put only 8 ounces of skim milk next time instead of 12 ounces.  Also good with cream of mushroom soup.  Another tip: Bake the dumplings for at least 10 minutes before you pour the soup mixture into the pan, or else they come out too soggy.

This recipe was a wonderful surprise.  I'd been looking for something different to do with canned tuna and these dumplings were delightful.  My hubby was very impressed!  I added fresh brocolli between the dumplings before pouring the sauce over. I also sprinkled extra shredded cheese on top about 5 minutes before removing from the oven.

These are great! I would cook them without the soup first as someone else suggested so they don't get too soggy, but they're still good if you don't. Each person will get a little of the soup, so I serve this in bowls. Also, you could try these on canned round biscuits--just flatten and stretch each biscuit, put the filling in the middle, and fold over into a triangle.

I followed other people's suggestions and baked these separately from the soup as I don't like soggy bread, either.  I thought these were okay, but my husband really liked them.  I served the brocolli soup as a dip, but will use cream of mushroom soup the next time I make this because we both thought that the brocolli and tuna did not compliment each other well.  I'm also going to try this with salmon the next time I do it.  Thanks for an interesting recipe!

The "cook time" at the top needs to be changed - it's not 10 minutes, but besides that, this recipes was very good.  Even my picky 3 1/2 year old ate it without questions (that's a miracle). I was afraid to overstuff the rolls with the mixture, but next time I'm definitely going to add more of the mixture to the inside.  Great recipe.

Good use of tuna.  Next time I will cook the dumplings alone and serve soup as a side as to prevent the bread from getting soggy.  It's yummy and my kids liked it so it's a keeper!!

These are very good served with some rice to soak up extra sauce.  I don't put the pimento in and sometimes I change the soup to a different cream - they've been good every time.  My only problem is figuring out when they're cooked.  It's hard to tell what the dough is doing while it's in the soup mixture and I tend to end up with undercooked dumplings - they still taste good though.

First off:  BOTH KIDS ATE 'EM!  11 & 14!  I changed the recipe, but not too much.  I didn't make the sauce & used a 12oz can chunk light tuna & a "10 pack" of buttermilk biscuits.  They are surprising (suspiciously :D) similar to cresent rolls when flattened.  I oiled the pan a little & baked 'em about 25 minutes.  For the filling, I used the tuna, 3/4t salt, 1/2t pepper, a cup of cheddar & just one egg.  I let that sit a while in the refrig to plump up the cheese & help it hold its shape.  I made goodsize - inch or more - tuna "meatballs."  Placed them in the center & pulled up from the sides four times (imagine a square), gave them a pinch & a twist, then baked.  If I hadn't put the biscuits on the oiled pan then filled, they all would've stayed together; but oil got on the corners I was trying to seal so a couple openned.  The intact ones were cute!  I sprinkled sesame seeds over the top before baking, too.  The taste wasn't "wow," but it's a new way to serve tuna - that those kids will eat - at least mine - & that's saying something!  :)  Of course, I suppose most kids would eat anything wrapped in a biscuit or cresent roll.  Ha.

This is really good.  My aunt gave me a similar recipe using canned chicken and cream of chicken soup instead of tuna and cream of broccoli.  I like the mix of flavors and the leftovers were nice to come home to.

This was a nice change to the menu and a fun new thing to do with tuna. The sauce was VERY rich. I used a cream of celery soup instead of the broccoli. I think next time I will mix it with a half and half or just regular milk. I will cut the salt and pepper in half also and maybe add some chopped tomatoes to the mix. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

What a great recipe! I used less salt, reduced fat crescents, and cream of broccoli soup doctored up with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I decided to make 4 large dumplings by separating the rolls, slightly overlapping the two edges, pinching the seams then flattening them a bit with a rolling pin. I also chose to bake the dumplings without the sauce (which I served on the side with broccoli) and they took 15 minutes tops to bake! They tasted really good, were easy and I'm sure we'll have them frequently. Word of advice: make sure your tuna is VERY dry (I had to squeeze the liquid out with my hands!), last week when I tried to make this recipe, I had to trash it because the tuna wasn't drained enough. I'm really glad I tried again though!

This recipe was a hit, I was surprised that it was described as having a "sophisticated" taste!  I ended up with extra mixture and ran out of crescent rolls, so I spread the rest on a sheet of puff pastry and baked for 30 minutes, it was great too!

These were unexpectedly good, my 1year old loved them. I made potato soup and put dumplings in oven for a few minutes alone to make them crispier. Definitely making again!

Tasty! 
Made a few changes:
*used egg sub
*omitted salt
*omitted pimento and add in red pepper flakes
* ground peppercorn


I tested putting the soup mix on some rolls from the start of baking and then 1/2 way through on others. The ones where I put the soup on first the soup was thicker. Neither turned out soggy. I backed mine on a cookie sheet.


2nd time making this:
Baked in a 13x9 pan
I put the tuna mix in the middle of the big part of the triangle and then wrapped the tuna leaving it open at the top. They puffed really nice even with the soup around it.

I bought the bigger crescent rolls, and I had enough dough to fully wrape the tuna mixture. I substituted pimento with banana peppers to make it more spicy, and used Alfredo sauce instead of milk to evade the "soupy" texture. I spooned this thicker soup on too of the middle of each dumpling. Exquisite!

This was good but a little salty , i use cream of mushroom soup and fat free condensed milk. This was too sweet. I will use 1% next time. Didn't think they were too soggy.

These were Awesome.  I loved them and loved that they were easy to make.  The recipe didn't say what type of pan to put them in so I used a cookie sheet and worked well.  They were quick and easy to make.

We didn't really care for these.  The soup made them extra salty and they were too soggy.  I did bake them 10 minutes before adding the soup mixture but it didn't help.  Not a lot of flavor except salt came through.  I do have to admit that my 5 year old thought they were fabulous, so maybe it's more a kid meal.

After reading reviews, I baked the dumplings about 25 mins before adding the soup mixture then baked for another 15mins. I do like that the dumplings were golden brown and slightly crunchy.

This was good, but next time I'm doing Salmon instead of Tuna and then using clam chowder for the soup...then I hope it's a 5*!  
Thanks for a great starter recipe!!  After posting I did try salmon with clam chowder and I think I like the tuna better!! So I'm sticking with the main recipe and I will be making it again!

This was really, really good!  I used albacore tuna.  I, too, baked the dumplings without the sauce for 20 minutes, then poured the sauce over the dumplings and baked for 10 minutes more.  There was a lot of sauce for just eight dumplings, so next time I plan to double the number of dumplings.  This recipe is a keeper!  Easy and tasty!
Update:  I've made this several times and just tried it baking the dumplings for the entire time in the sauce.  The sauce got much thicker and the dumplings were not soggy at all.  I will continue to make it this way.

I made this recipe as it is written,  DH loved it, could not have been better . To those who don't like it because the bread was not crisp / to soggy etc, do not make a recipe with Dumplings in the title.

It was good but I think it was b/c there was so much dough in relation to tuna filling.  B/c the family raved about it I would do again but somehow make the dough part and sauce healthier.

This recipe is great as written, but really awesome if tweaked alittle!   I bake the filled crescents until crispy and then either pour the sauce over and bake for a bit more or just use it as a dipping sauce.  I also add a bit of sweet relish to the filling and some dried dill and onion powder to the sauce!  A terrific easy dinner - thanks for sharing!!!

This is a uniquely delicious recipe. I took the other reviews into account and baked just the dumplings for 15 min. before adding the sauce to avoid sogginess, and I added some extra cheddar on top after I poured the sauce over. I thought the sauce tasted great, but it was a little too heavy for me. I think next time I'll make the soup and have these dumplings on the side. Very good.

very tasty , the dough seemed a bit doughy , next time I think I'll add the soup mixture near the last few min of cooking or use as a dip . but overall it was very good

This was ok.  I did bake the dumplings for 20 min and then added the soup sauce although it came out rather runny.  If I try it again I will be using less milk.

WOW!  I was hesitente to try this.  I took others suggtions.  I cooked the dumplings separate for 20 minutes and then put the heated soup on top to continue to bake for 10 minutes.  Otherwise I did not change anything else.  This was great, try it.! Thank Holly.

I did not prepare these with the soup and milk because I was looking for something more like a tuna puff.  The other reviews didn't seem to have any difficulty but I wasn't clear on what to do with the crescents.  The recipe serving is 6 but my crescent package had 8, so I left it in a rectangle (2 joined crescents), added the filling, pulled all 4 corners in, pinched the seams, and twisted the top.  That gave us 4 dumplings.  It turned out great for us but I think I'd prefer it with chicken or with a tuna salad filling.

SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO DO WITH TUNA...TASTY, BUT MY DUMPLINGS STUCK SO I NEXT TIME I WOULD SPRAY THE PAN FIRST AND INCREASE THE COOKING TIME BY ABOUT 15 OR MORE MINUTES. OVERALL THIS ONE IS A KEEPER.

Tasty and kid-friendly at this house! A nice alternative to tuna casserole. I added some chopped celery to the filling, and some onion would also add more zing to the flavor.

Very rich but tasty.  Make sure crescent rolls are cooked long enough not to be doughy, but not so long that they're burned--keep a close eye while baking!

Didn't do the pour-over soup mixture, because 1: we didn't have the ingredients, and 2: my sweetheart is lactose intolerate, he couldn't eat it anyway.  But I did the tuna-wraps for the dumplings and we ate them as is.  They were deliscious! :)  Would make a great appetizer for parties!

I really liked it. I made some variations: I used condensed mushroom soup and about 1/2 can refilled with non-fat milk for the sauce. I also used canned chicken instead of the tuna for a friend that doesn't eat fish and she loved it! So quick and easy!

Followed recipe exactly. I have made this several times. Comfort food. Easy to make. Great sauce. The reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is that it really does need the sauce since the tuna in the rolls is rather boring/bland. I feel like I need to add something inside them but I don't know what yet. Will make again though!

I've made this many times and it's always a hit! Even my late mother, who became very picky about food (and often refused to eat) loved it.  I can never find pimentos, so I've sometimes just chopped red peppers very fine and I've also added onions and peppers to the broth.  It's super delish as it is, although the peppers and onions are delishious as well.  I've found the pepper can be a bit strong and can overpower the tuna and cheese, so you might want to cut down on the amount.  It's always amazing, though and I'm dying to make this for the first time for my new husband! I know he'll love it! :)

I did add a little extra zip with spices... And for my soup, cooked it seperatly and used clam chowder and poured it over right before serving... Over all, it was a pretty good recipe. :)

This is one of those great recipes that can easily be made when you don't have very many ingredients on hand. I didn't have any cream of broccoli or evaporated milk around, so I don't know how it is with the sauce, but it was extremely tasty without.
