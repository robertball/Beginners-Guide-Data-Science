I tried this recipe just as is. I found using condensed cream of mushroom soup made the dish bland. To add flavor I added sour cream, chopped green onions, and sliced green peppers.

I guess I'll be the first one to differ on my opinion of this recipe.  I discovered it 6 years ago on Allrecipes, and I've made it several times as a nice alternative to traditional tuna casserole.  This time I happened to have on hand some pre-cooked frozen baby carrots, so that is what I used in lieu of a package of frozen carrots.  I also like the use of canned sliced potatoes, I think they add something different to the dish.  I simply made one layer of each ingredient, no need to make multiple layers of each.  One suggestion I'd like to make, however, is to lightly season each layer as you go, or else you'll end up tasting all the salt, pepper and paprika on the top layer.

Did not care for this much! I'm going to go back to my original tuna casserole...the soup, peas,milk, noodles,tuna, pepper & mix them all up, dump it in a casserole dish, crush up some crackers & sprinkle on top toss it in the oven...this was too complicated for a tuna casserole & did NOT tase very good. Not that hard to screw up a tuna casserole.

I liked all of the vegetables, but it was way too soupy. If I make it again, I will eliminate the water (there's enough liquid w/the milk and frozen vegetables), and probably not pre-cook the noodles. Or, I'll use fresh vegetables instead.

I am not a big fan of tuna noodle casserole per se, but this one was very good! I will add it to my meal planning.

This was not a good casserole :( I think it may need cheese or something? BUTTER? I have been cooking with all recipes for a long time and this was BAD...

I agree with the other people who said that it was too liquidy.  It would have been alright without the water added because that just made it way too runny.  It was bland tasting too.  It was a ruined dinner, unfortunately.

I made this with fresh potatoes and carrots and added fried onions to the top. It turned out OK. Like someone else said, I should have added more seasoning between layers for additional flavor.

In the oven now. Looking forward to tasting it. All the ingredients are healthy. Didn't use extra water. Used canned salmon because had it on hand.
