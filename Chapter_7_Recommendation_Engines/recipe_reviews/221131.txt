I'm rating this 4 stars but don't get me wrong, it's very addictive, just be sure everyone in your group loves blue cheese. I prefer the original Frank's recipe which is on this site. If I were to make this one again, I would use either the blue cheese dressing or fresh blue cheese, but not both. I personally thought it was a bit overwhelming. I've done it before with Ranch and the result was amazing.

I found a way to make EVERYONE happy!  I made 1 1/2 recipes.  With half of the mix I used pepper jack cheese, blue cheese dressing and a scant 1/4C blue cheese crumbles.  With the other I used cheddar/jack cheese, ranch dressing and 1 tsp. of powdered ranch dressing mix.  Served them side by side with some blue cheese crumbles to spoon on top as they chose.  I did use low or reduced fat ingredients where I could but that's my personal take.
HINT:  Blue cheese can be pricey and extras spoil if you don't use it frequently.  I always buy the amount I need at the salad bar in my local grocery.  It's less expensive by the pound there and I don't end up with a lot of leftovers to worry about wasting.

I made this dip back on Super Bowl Sunday for a potluck party and got mixed reviews. I am one who does definitely prefer bleu cheese to ranch on my buffalo style wings, but it seems that not everyone has my good taste! The bleu cheese taste was a bit strong however, but that may be because of the dressing that I use which is Bob's Big BoyÂ® brand. It is a very rich dressing. I may temper it by halving the bleu cheese dressing and adding in some ranch next time. Not sure. Anyway, 5 stars because I loved it and I'm sure that it can be made a little less potent so as to please most everyone.

Made this for a family get-together and everyone raved about it.  It's very addicting.  Only thing I did different was to substitute ranch dressing for the blue cheese dressing (still used the blue cheese crumbles) and shred the chicken in a food processor rather than dicing it.  Will definitely make again.

Liked by most adults, despised by most teenagers! I brought some to an adult Superbowl party and served with celery and Chicken n Biscuit crackers and it was well received. Brought the same dish to a high school event and it was out and out rejected. Eew...blue cheese. Be aware of your audience folks. A bag of Doritos would have gone over better.

After Reading The Reviews, I Made The Recipe With A Couple Of Minor Changes. I Am Like Some Of The Other Reviewers And Don't Like Canned Chicken So I Boiled Then Shredded 3 chicken Breasts, Shredded Them In The Food processor. I Also Used 1/2 Cup Ranch Dressing And 1/2 Cup Bleu Cheese Dressing. I Substitued Texas Pete Buffalo Wing Sauce For Hot Sauce And Used 1 1/2 Cups.  Everyone Loved It. Will Definitely Make This Again.

I made this for a Super Bowl party--no substitutions. It was fantastic! Even my super picky boyfriend and friend who doesn't like blue cheese got seconds. People were asking if there were leftovers after the party! As always, Chef Jon's recipe is a winner!

I made this quick and easy recipe today for a birthday party and it was amazing! I used everything except for the crumbled blue cheese. It disappeared quickly with no leftovers to worry about... I will definitely be making it again!

I made this for the 2014 Super Bowl and it was pretty awesome. I made a couple of changes: 1) I used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese (we were feeding kiddos as well and you know how they can be). 2) I did use some blue cheese crumbles that I got from the salad bar 3)I also used some green onion throughout the dip and on top 4) I took the advice of a previous reviewer and did not put cheese on the top 4) Lastly, I adjusted the amount of dressing and buffalo sauce by tasting and my preferred texture/creaminess. All-in-all I thought it was pretty darn awesome. It's an easy recipe to adjust to your personal liking.

Huge hit!  I made it the night before and couldn't stop eating it cold straight out of the fridge.  I left out the cayenne, cut the hot sauce to 1/2 C, and used cheddar/jack because I'm a wimp.  It still had decent heat and SO much flavor.  VERY blue cheesy, so adjust according to your own blue cheese meter.  I happened to use bacon blue cheese dressing because I am unable to resist bacon anything, but it didn't seem to impart any flavor.  Now I'm looking for excuses to entertain.

Wow!  Chef John has done it again.  The best buffalo chicken dip ever.  The Old Bay, crumbled blue cheese, and Frank's hot sauce (of course!) makes the difference.  Thank you for a spectacular dip!

This dip turned out much spicier than I predicted. Some people really liked it, but it was a bit too hot for others. I followed the suggestions of others, and omitted the blue cheese crumbles (only used the blue cheese dressing). Next time, I will cut the amount of hot sauce in half.

Chef John is the man. This recipe is unbelievably easy to throw together and is always a huge hit. Everyone I've made this for has demanded the recipe so I've been spreading the good news for six months now. 

I think I was a little slapdash with the rotisserie chicken the first time around so my only suggestion is to really break the chicken up to make sure you pull out any similarly-colored tendons and small bones you may overlook. I had one or two in the first one so I'm extra careful now. Plus it's fun to rip apart a chicken like some kind of wildebeest. Great stress reliever.

I had a friend add diced jalapenos to the recipe to give it even more kick and said the brininess worked really well with the other ingredients. I'll definitely try that soon.

Wow!  "Not for the faint of heart", I told them at my New year's Day party!  but those who dared really loved it.  I adjusted the recipe and dropped the old bay seasoning, I was out of it.  I also put it in a casserole dish, cooked it for 45 mins and found it kept warmer longer on the buffet.  This was the second time I made it this season.  The office absolutely loved it and there was none left to take home that's why I made it again for New Year's.  Yummy!

Made this and took it to work, was gone in a flash. It is soooo good on celery. Just like buffalo wings minus the bones. Don't skimp on the bleu cheese, or add ranch dressing. This is perfect just the way it is. Thanks again Chef John.

My changes.  I cut up 2 stalks of celery and sauteed them in butter to give it some crunch.  I then added it to the rest.   Also I left the Old Bay (I didn't have any) and never noticed.  I also added more cheese.  I was trying to appeal to a wider crowd so I mixed 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to cool off the heat. I served it with Tostito's Scoops as well as a celery sticks.  Needless to say I went home w/ an empty dish and a lot of celery sticks.  I also cooked it in the 9x13 Pyrex dish.

Amazingly tasty dip - added a little dash of chipolte pepper to mine to give just a little extra kick and layer of flavor. Brought it to a dinner party and watched if fly from the bowl. Definitely a make again.

The first time I made this was on New Years Eve. I was pretty skeptical since I'm not big on blue cheese, but figured it would taste better than ranch of all things *blech*. A few people in my group shared their skepticism as well. Most either hate hot foods or just don't care for the taste of blue cheese either. Even so, I'm someone who likes to be adventurous, and the finished product in the video looked so amazing that I couldn't ignore this recipe any longer. The end result was perfect. In fact, every single person who shared their doubts about it (myself included) wound up coming back for seconds and then thirds. By New Years day the bowl was literally picked clean. I have made this again during the Super Bowl season, and will be making it in the near future. Highly addictive!

Brew club favorite...great and easy alternative to cold dip. Love it with celery when hot, and on crispy bread rounds when cold.

If I don't fix this for my beach crowd, I am in big trouble! I do 1/4 cup ranch dressing and 1/4 cup blue cheese dressing. I also add blue cheese  crumbles into the mixture as well as sprinkle on top of dish.

I had to scale this down to 3 servings because I only had about 6 oz of cream cheese.  The only problem with that is it left us wanting more!  So goooood!  Cooked it about 12 minutes in a little dish.  It probably could have cooked the entire time and browned more on top but I was afraid with there being such a little amount and it was fabulous so all is good.

This recipe is always a hit for parties! I make a few tweaks to it though. Instead of blue cheese crumbles, I buy chunky blue cheese dressing and up the measurement slightly. Also, I put two chicken breasts in the crock pot with a little buffalo sauce so that I can go run errands and shred it when I get back for the dip. I don't like too spicy, so I substitute the pepper jack sauce with franks buffalo wing sauce and omit the cayenne pepper.

This recipe was so quick and easy! I was able to throw it together with things I already had in the kitchen! I had to improvise on a few things but I've made this recipe several times a week for months since we first got it! Even my kids love it when I make it not to hot. Thank you so much! I can't imagine anyone who will not love this. I used ranch instead of blue cheese dressing because my husband and kids aren't a fan, but I did use blue cheese crumbles, they couldn't taste them!

Made this last weekend for a party and I'll definitely be making it again. I didn't have the blue cheese dressing or the blue cheese, so just used the 3-Cheese Ranch dressing I did have on hand and some shredded sharp old cheddar cheese. It was still very good, and I had many recipe requests. Just enough heat to warm you up on a cold November day without being too hot. Served with Pita chips, various crackers, Celery sticks and sugar snap peas. Very Yummy.

I make this yesterday to take to a superbowl get together and everybody, especially the men, looved it. They couldn't get enough of it. I followed the recipe except that I used ranch dressing instead and added more crumbled blue cheese than the recipe called for. It was sooo good! I wish I had left overs to pick on today.

I followed a reviewer's advice and ran the chicken through the food processor.  It made it easier to dip with tortilla chips.  I also omitted the crumbled blue cheese.  The dressing added enough flavor without overpowering the dip.  Delicious!!  This would be great with celery sticks for dipping.

I really enjoyed this and have made it several times now. I keep toying with the idea of adding more Old Bay because I can't taste it in the recipe but I think it's great as is.

I like things mildly spicy hot but not overly so, thus I reduced the hot pepper sauce to 1/2 cup, omitted the cayenne pepper, and substituted cheddar for the pepper Jack cheese. For me, this gave it just the right amount of heat without being overpowering. (I went to a party recently where Buffalo Chicken Dip was served, and it was so intensely hot that people were coughing & gulping something to drink after the first bite.) Being allergic to blue cheese, I subbed ranch for the blue cheese dressing and omitted the crumbled blue cheese.  Hubby loved it and I did also, so I will keep this recipe on file.

This recipe was a huge hit at a party over the weekend with friends. They all raved about it and wanted the recipe as well. The dish which it was served in was spotless. We served this with celery, carrots and Tostido chips. What a HIT!
Thank you to Chef John! It was sooooo simple.

Caution: this recipe showed up under "Gluten Free" appetizers when I searched for them BUT bleu cheese is NOT gluten free unless it says on the package that it is!! Real Bleu Cheese is made by tossing  flour into the aging cheese -- that's where the mold comes from to make the "bleu".

Absolutely wow!!  I was looking for a top recipe and saw your name. I knew it would be good.  I made a couple of substitutions due to personal preference. We hate blue cheese so I used ranch and extra shredded cheese instead on blue cheese crumbles.  We are doing low carb so we ate with celery.  Thanks!

Big, BIG hit at all our functions every time I make this.  I don't deviate from his recipe at all.  Sometimes if I don't have blue cheese I just omit it and maybe increase the dressing slightly and sometimes I add red pepper flakses!  Best recipe ever!

This is my favorite dish to make! It is so rich and sooo addictive! I used both ranch dressing and blue cheese dressing, 1/4 cup each and followed the rest of the recipe. If you want a smoky flavor use some chipotle chile pepper or sauce. It is really good!

I made this dip for a Cowboys tailgate this weekend, and it was a HUGE HIT!  I served it with reduced fat triscuits and celery sticks.  I used lowfat cream cheese also.  My friends and I thought it would be great stuffed into cherry tomatoes and in mushroom caps too!

I loved the dip I made! I did make some alterations to cater to my party guests, however, some of which donât like bleu cheese, much as I love it. I used buffalo sauce instead of the hot sauce, and Mooreâs Buffalo Ranch sauce instead of the bleu cheese dressing, that way it wasnât too ranch heavy and it got a little extra buffalo taste. In place of the bleu cheese crumbles I used Gorgonzola because it has a similar enough taste for me, and my guests didnât mind Gorgonzola as much. And the last alteration I made was that in addition to the pepper jack I sprinkled on top I also added freshly grated hot habenero cheddar. This recipe was absolutely delectable, I served it with celery and crostini. One day when Iâm not trying to please people though, Iâll make the original recipe for myself. My favorite part was the old bay. I live in Maryland and we put old bay on everything, so I thought it added that extra something special.

Chef John is just the best.  This dip is absolutely amazing.  I love the great blue cheese flavor with the dressing AND blue cheese crumbles.  The pepper jack cheese and buffalo sauce gives it a great amount of bite for my taste, although I did sprinkle just a little cayenne on the top, like he said.  Was not overwhelmingly spicy.  I also omitted the Old Bay seasoning because I didn't have any in the house.  Phenomenal with celery AND Club Crackers, and hot, warm, and cold, just as he said in the video.  This just about disappeared at a euchre party I brought it to.  YUM!  Keeper!

Same rules apply for crab dip if needed! I replaced the chicken with a can of crab claw meat and I'm pretty sure this is all I'm eating for the next week! Can't get enough! Don't even mind the necessary evils of grocery shopping and cleaning up afterwards.

I did not make any changes and I would make this again with a couple changes. The dip was cheesy and heavy, but very good! I would add more spice and chicken. Half the blue cheese dressing and only one and a half blocks of cream cheese.

Excellent dish! I made it for an office party. There were several Buffalo Chicken dips there but my dish  was the only empty one at the end of the party!

I loved it; everyone I made it for loved it.  I followed others' advice and substituted ranch dressing for bleu cheese, as I was concerned about the strong taste of bleu cheese and not everyone being such a huge fan as I am.  Glad that I did that.  It had a very rich, mellow flavor.  This will be a regular in my recipe box.

This was a big hit!! I did take the advice of many reviewers and did half bleu cheese and half ranch. For a crowd I think that's the safest way to go. I love bleu cheese and could have handled it stronger, but halving it for a crowd is a sure way to make it a hit for everyone.

I'm not a blue cheese fan so I substituted ranch for the blue cheese dressing and more pepper jack cheese for the blue cheese crumbles. Very good!

I made this for an office potluck and it was a hit!  The only thing I didn't do was add the crumbled blue cheese...I was afraid it would affect the color of the dish.  I used Marie's Blue Cheese dressing which gave it a great blue cheese flavor.  Rather than bake it, I melted everything in a saucepan on the stove and then served it in a crock pot with carrots, celery, and crackers on the side.  This was delish!  I've made the other version of this recipe on Allrecipes that uses Ranch instead of blue cheese. They are both great...it just depends on your taste preference.

I make this for office parties & don't have the kitchen at work to make the recipe there. Instead, I cook the chicken before hand & assemble the ingredients in a large pan at home. I pour it all into a crock pot to keep warm & take it to my eager coworkers.

Oh My!  Made this on a whim for a work snack day and it was a HUGE hit, and I'm here now to print off and share the recipe.  I did take some tips from previous reviewers, but I can't imagine you could go wrong if you made it exactly as posted.  I did increase the chicken to 4 cups, so then increased Frank's sauce to 1 cup.  Instead of blue cheese crumbles I added a stick of butter (which is part of the original Buffalo wing recipe).   I didn't have pepper jack, but plain jack worked great and I was pretty generous with my cayenne "sprinkle" to compensate.

I made this on Super Bowl Sunday...everyone raved!  Used homemade ranch dressing in place of the bleu cheese dressing.  Everything else in recipe was exact (even the Frank's Red Hot).  Next time I'm asked to bring an appetizer to a party, I'm bringing this dish!

Delicious! Hubby raved & gushed forever. Used feta cheese instead of blue cheese because I didn't have any on hand. The mild taste probably a better choice for the family anyway. Added black olives & celery. Super Bowl was even better because of this dip. Thanks Chef John.

A bit too rich for us.  I forgot to add the Old Bay Seasoning - maybe that made a difference?  Great idea but just too rich for our palate.

I made this for ME because "normal"
people don't like blue cheese and I wanted to try a new recipe for buffalo dip. It was fantastic! Even the people I had over devoured it. Of course I didn't say there was blue cheese in it until after the fact. Anyways, my hubby even said that this will be the new way we make buffalo dip! (Normally we use 2-4 cups of shredded cheese, a whole bottle of franks, 2 cream cheese - that's it)

I have made it a few times now and have found little variations in order to customize it based on your friends.  Personally I like to scale back the blue cheese dressing and use Frank's RedHot "Wings Buffalo" sauce.  Also if I feel like kicking it up a notch I will get a block of Cabot Habanero Cheddar and shred up some of that in there in place of the shredded pepper jack.

Chef John does it again by gently pushing the envelope while delivering food having wide appeal. This was a very popular appetizer and two batches went pretty quickly. Made minor changes: subbed (i) reduced fat cream cheese for regular, (ii) Creole Seasoning from this site for Old Bay, and (iii) jalapeÃ±o jack cheese (at Publix deli) for pepper jack. Added 2, fresh jalapeÃ±o peppers with most of the membrane and seeds removed to temper the heat. Served with crackers, flat bread, and celery sticks.

What an appetizer!! I had a party for 45 people, made this dish and it was the hit of the party I spite of all the other food that was served!  I did add a bit more of the Frank's Red Hot sauce than what the recipe called for but it is a amazing!

OMG!! This was so very good!  We took this to a birthday party and I had nothing left to take home except a clean plate :)   I have made this 2x now, and I find that a chunkier dice of the chicken is favored by most people.  First time I diced it quite finely and was not the texture I wanted.  Second time I chopped the chicken more coarsley and it was perfect.  Also, I used 1 package of neufchatel cheese and 1 package of full-fat cream cheese.  Was rich enough for my blood.  Also, use a good brand of blu cheese dressing (lighthouse or maries or anything in the refrigerated section) and not a product off the dry goods shelf.  This is not too spicy as is, so if you want it hotter add xtra cayenne.  I served this with waverly crackers, carrots, and celery sticks.  Also, this is great served hot, room temp (very convenient!) or even chilled.  Try this recipe, as always, Chef Johns recipes NEVER disappoint.

Another good recipe from Chef John! I mix blue cheese and ranch as my family's tastes are more towards ranch and add more cheese. Always a hit as is or with the extras!

I made this to take to our friends house for the Super Bowl yesterday.  It was a big hit!  The only thing I did different was cut back on the blue cheese dressing a bit.  Using a rotisserie chicken made this so easy to throw together.

AHHHHmazing!!! Made this for a work potluck and it was the first thing gone. The only thing I changed was I didn't add the blue cheese crumbles because I didn't have any. Will definitely be making this for Super Bowl Sunday. Super easy and quick to make too.

This is a really good dip! I made this for New Year's Eve and everyone really enjoyed it. It was nice because I roasted a chicken the night before and saved the leftovers (which ended up being the exact amount called for) and used them for the dip. It is a little on the spicy side, but not too spicy (I am usually not a fan of spicy foods at all and I really liked it). I'm making it again for a birthday party soon!

This was a great and easy recipe I used ranch dressing and cheddar cheese as that was what I had on hand.  I put the chicken in my food processor first before I mixed it... The ladies at book club loved it ~ Bridget

We doubled the chicken and pepperjack and added half a cup of ranch. It was excellent, and everyone loved it.

This recipe is astounding!  My favorite personal addition to this is some chopped celery or water chestnuts for a crunchy touch, Delish!  After all, hot wings usually come with a side of celery ;)  I love this dip with tortilla chips.

Loved this dip! I used homemade ranch instead of blue cheese dressing but still used the blue cheese crumbles! Just didnât want the blue cheese to be too over powering. But this will be a forever favorite going forward !

This dip was good, had a lot grease.  My husband even commented on it.  Not sure why, I made it just as the recipe said.  If it wasn't for the grease I would have given it 4 stars.  Good taste to it.

My husband loved it.  I thought the crumbled blue cheese was too strong since I'm not a big fan of blue cheese.  When I made it the 2nd time, I removed that ingredient and it was perfect for the both of us.  I also add a 1/4 cup of diced, fresh green onion...half mixed in the dip and the other half as garnish as soon as it comes out of the oven.

De-lish!  I have used other buffalo chicken dip recipes but this is our new favorite! After reading the reviews, I opted to use just a tad less hot sauce to appeal to more of our guests. Kept everything else as written. And it worked! Our guests gobbled it up!

Was a big hit at a 4th ok for July gathering. Very flavorful. I used premium canned chicken breast because it was all I had on hand. Worked well and made prep super easy. I cut the blue cheese with a few spoonfuls of ranch because of some of the other reviews, but probably won't next time. It wasn't that spicy or that blue chees-y (but I can eat blue cheese by the spoonfuls!). Everyone loved it so I have lots of recipe requests to fill this morning!  I also placed the mixture in a crock pot (r) on high for an hour and then then low for 30 minutes instead of baking. Transported to party in crock pot and kept on warm setting for the afternoon. Worked well. Will definitely make this again!

This dip was so good it was almost embarrassing. I have some other signature appetizers that everyone used to ask for until I made this for the first time. Itâs really simple & really good. Guess what donât tell people there is blue cheese in it and even my friends that donât like blue cheese liked it.

Absolutely addictive. So much so I make it only when sharing with others. Else wise I would eat the entire batch myself!  Iâm not a huge blue cheese fan, I substitute ranch dressing. And if you canât find a rotisserie chicken, substitute three large cans of canned white meat chicken... it still turns out really well.

I made it for Super Bowl and everyone loved it. 

  I think it's wrong when people change the recipe before trying it the first time.   But, I used ranch because my wife is not a big fan of blue cheese dressing.

Will probably make again with changes..Extra cream cheese, Sriacha sauce, (what I had) 1/4 cup (it's hot!), ghost cheddar (that's what I had) blue cheese, mayo and canned white chicken breast. Turned out great.

It was easy to make. My family loves it. I love it because itâs low carb. I used fresh chicken and slightly browned it. Let it cool then shredded it. It will be good for football games or just a crowd pleaser before a family reunion.

I was looking for a good Buffalo Chicken Dip for a Fourth Of July party. It turned out great and was a hit! Everyone was asking me for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly.  The blue cheese does give the dip a saltiness.  As far spiciness, some said it was spicy and others said it wasn't that spicy, but overall, everyone enjoyed!

I used a bit more ranch dressing and only one package of cream cheese and it was a perfect consistency! Everyone loved it.

Delicious dip. I did not have roaster chicken (sorry Chef John) so I used the canned chicken. I would imagine roaster chicken would even be better as I have made chicken salad from roaster chicken and it is fabulous. This turned out very good but I did not have enough Franks Red Hot and used some Louisiana Buffalo Chicken premade sauce. I only gave it 4 stars because my wife did not like the old bay spice in the dip. Next time I will make sure I have enough Franks Red Hot and  delete the old bay and I bet it is a 5 star recipe

Yes...a fantastic go to recipe for Buffalo Chicken Dip. I love Blue Cheese and followed the recipe exactly for a half serving keeping the same amount (3 cups)  of store bought rotisserie chicken. I like a meatier consistency.  I did put under the broiler for 2 minutes as suggested along with the addition of a sprinkle of real bacon bits on top.  Wonderful served with a  "Hint of Lime" Tostitos chips or Scoops. This recipe also makes a great enchilada filling.

My Review is based on changes I made after reading through the reviews and making some adjustments.  I used all the meat from a 2lb 5oz Roasted chicken which produced 4 Cups and used only 1 (8oz) Package of cream cheese.  And because we were bringing this to a party in Ranch Dressing Country (Texas), I omitted all of the Blue Cheese from the recipe but brought some on the side.  I really think the adjustments worked really well to address the "Too cheesy" comments, the Blue Cheese concerns and the too oily comments.  This was a big winner!

Very good! I did use a half rotisserie chicken that I shredded instead of cubed for personal preference. It did give it a very nice creamy texture. Will definitely make again!

Used ranch dressing instead of bleu cheese (also omitted bleu cheese crumbles- I donât love bleu cheese) and was amazing! Threw all ingredients in a crock pot and served as appetizer with Triscuit crackers.  So good!

I always get asked to make this for parties and I have a ton of people asking for the recipe. I put everything in a crock pot on low for about an hour or two before the party. I like it hotter so I use Franks Hot Buffalo sauce.

I love the addition of blue cheese crumbles and pepper Jack cheese.  I used a whole package of grilled chicken strips from Aldi (in freezer section) and it was 4 cups.  I did everything else according to recipe.  This is the third buffalo dip I've tried and this is the keeper.  Chef John is always the best!

The dip was a hit and I only made a couple of changes based on other recipes - I added a stalk of sautÃ©ed, diced celery for crunch and about a 1/2 cup of sour cream for tang. It was delicious with crackers, bread and vegetables!

This came out really good! I really liked the rotisserie chicken in the dip. I omitted the blue cheese crumbles (and kept the same amount of blue cheese dressing the recipe called for) and I think it had a good amount of blue cheese flavor (maybe still slightly strong). I also omitted the old bay because I didn't have any on hand and I'm not a fan of the stuff anyway. All in all, great recipe - I would make again!

This dip was a hit. I followed the directions except for the blue cheese & blue cheese dressing. After I mixed everything beside the blue cheese I halved the mix & added blue cheese & blue cheese dressing to one half. The other half I added ranch dressing too. I baked them in separate dishes & I topped them both with pepper jack cheese (the one with blue cheese I added some more crumbles to the top). The teens at the party enjoyed the ranch based dip & the adults devoured the blue cheese based dips.

This was good but nothing spectacular.  All I could taste was chicken, hot sauce, and cream cheese.  I feel like the bleu cheese crumbles, dressing and pepper jack cheese were completely wasted ingredients.

Very nice dip for Super Bowl! Reduced the hot sauce a bit and used Mexican Shredded Cheese along with a tad of fresh mozzarella shredded for texture. Also didn't use cayenne - my wife doesn't care for it. Served with some crackers for dipping and we loved it reduced to 4 serving size! Very Nice!??

I made several modifications. I shredded 4 boneless skinless breasts, used a block and a half of cream cheese, a packet of ranch seasoning and 3/4 cup hot sauce. There was no need for additional ranch dressing. Crushed ritz crackers on top. Delicious!

I haven't found a recipe from Chef John that my family and I haven't loved.  Considering my family & I aren't big fans of bleu cheese, I substituted the crumbled bleu cheese with pepper jack.  I also used 1/2 bleu cheese dressing/1/2 ranch dressing to get just a bit of the bleu cheese flavor without overpowering the non-bleu cheese fans.  It was a hit!  I put a small bowl of bleu cheese to the side for those who really love it to sprinkle on top.

This was not a huge hit.. I made it exactly to directions, and like other reviewers stated, was pretty good but you must really like bleu cheese to enjoy. Most of my bunch don't love it. I also tried the version with ranch as others suggested. It was even more poorly received, way too "tangy" with the other ingredients.. that was the response of my authentic buffalo chicken wing and ranch dressing loving adult son. Possibly toning down the ranch with something else might help.  Again, wasn't bad but wasn't a big hit.

My husband loves buffalo chicken wings, so I made this for him and company.  We liked it, but it might be better using more chicken and less cheese.

This is a recipe to keep.  I did stick to the recipe but only had Jack cheese not Pepper Jack, so I added another pinch of cayenne to help.   For those who talked about the chicken being to big for dip remember it says dice, not chop, so try those smaller pieces. The blue cheese was nice but I might even add a tad more next time.  Didn't taste it as much as other mentioned.  Oh, I forgot, I also used Texas Pete Buffalo Wing Sauce for my hot sauce. This wasn't as hot as I expected, actually a little bland so next time I'll make sure to have Pepper Jack and use straight hot sauce or just more buffalo sauce.

Excellent base recipe. I melted 2 tbsp. butter with about 8 ounces of Frank's Red Hot sauce, then added about 2 cups minced leftover roasted chicken  and simmered for a few minutes. Mixed together about 3/4 of a brick of cream cheese, about 1/2 cup of blue cheese dressing, and about 1/2 cup of finely shredded cheddar, then added the chicken mixture to it and baked for about 25 minutes. Served with Fritos Scoops and celery sticks. Absolutely delicious. Thank you!!!

Ive been making chicken wing dip for years and this by far is the best Ive ever had. The consistency was spot on. It wasn't greasy at all. Usually when I make it theres a pool of red grease at the top that needs to be patted dry with paper towel. This had no visible grease. I would recommend if you arent a huge fan of blue cheese that its best to emit the blue cheese crumbles and just use half a cup of the dressing. I however love it so this wasn't an issue for me. My girlfriend liked it but thought it was too much blue cheese.  Anyways from now this is gonna be my go to recipe for chicken wing dip.

i have made this 4 or 5 times now and the first time i left out the blue cheese crumbles as some suggested. The second time i added the blue cheese crumbles in and I much prefer the recipe exactly like it is posted. I did not use a cheap blue cheese dressing and i think it is perfect. My neighbors calls this "buffalo CRACK dip? because they are addicted to it and request it when we do cookouts. I do prefer the Franks Red hot Wing sauce in this dip. Thanks Chef John!!!

Love this dip! I did make a slight change in that I used ranch dressing in place of the bleu cheese. I still used the bleu cheese crumbles, but I didn't want the bleu cheese flavor to be overwhelming. Other than that I follow it exactly. Using a rotisserie chicken is less expensive than the canned and tastes so much better. A hit every time I make it. Thank you for the recipe!

Wow! I planned on making several changes because I thought it would be too rich.  Boy was I wrong.  Made it just the way the recipe read except for the Old Bay seasoning.  It was such a small amount.  I did add a small amount of Cajun seasoning since that is what I had.  My grown children were fighting over this.  I had to fight them off so their dad could have some when he got home.  It definitely was not too rich.  Just right for all of us.

As some have stated, I was worried about the bleu cheese over powering this, so I left off the crumbles. It came out perfect as is. I also tried an experiment, made one with ranch as well, and took them both to a superbowl party..The bleu cheese dish was gone in 30 minutes (there were roughly 25 people). The ranch was 3/4 gone by the end and I took it home!

This was very tasty and easy to make. I skipped the blue cheese crumbles like others recommended, but otherwise I followed the recipe. We ate it with toasted baguettes which was delicious. This is a definite keeper.

Wow!  Game changer.  We all ate too much...and I'm not sure how to prevent that in the future - this is sooooo good!  I made a few changes based on other reviewers' comments, and feel I perfected it the very first time!  

I used Ranch dressing instead of the Blue Cheese dressing (but still included the blue cheese crumbles).  Added 1/2 packet of dry ranch mix, too, for added flavor.  Used Pepper Jack in the chicken mixture per the recipe, but topped with Cheddar cheese instead.  AWESOME!  Served with Keebler Club crackers, Tostitos Scoops and celery.  The celery was the unanimous favorite, interestingly, though the scoops chips were divine, too.  Cannot wait to make this again!

It was amazing. I had to use fried chicken instead of rotisserie but other than that, I followed instructions. Had to use generic old bay seasoning. It was sooo yummy and my 11 year old and boyfriend loved it!

I will definitely be making this again.  Made it for Super Bowl party last night.  Family raved about it.  I did make a few changes.  I did not use the crumbled bleu cheese nor the blue cheese dressing.  My family does not care for bleu cheese so I substituted ranch.  One comment/question -- I could not figure out whether to use the Franks Hot Sauce or the Franks Buffalo Chicken Wing Sauce.  I wound up using the Buffalo Wing Sauce.  Has anybody else had this question?

Huge hit at our Super Bowl party! In fairness, it was an all-adult party, so didn't encounter any resistance from young folk to the bleu cheese. That said, I actually cut back a little on the bleu cheese, as not all at the party were lovers of that taste. I simply omitted the 1/2 cup of crumbled cheese, but included the bleu cheese dressing. The result was perfect, tangy, but not overpowering. 

Following one other reviewer's suggestion, I shredded the chicken in my food processor. This worked great, much faster than with a knife, and pretty evenly "diced." (The chicken was cold from the fridge, so I don't know whether it would work as well with warm chicken meat.)

Not much left over, will definitely make again!

Delicious  recipe. I substituted NeufchÃ¢tel cheese and low fat blue cheese dressing and low fat blue cheese to lower the overall fat content and it worked fine. My husband preferred less tang, so next time I will use ranch dressing or cut out the extra blue cheese.

This was delicious!  I used regular Monterey Jack and omitted the cayenne pepper and it was the perfect level of spice for our group.  What an amazing addition to the Super Bowl apps!  I served this amazing dip with tortilla chips and celery, and got so many compliments.  I will definitely make this again and again!

This dip is DEEEEEE-luscious. Made it to recipe, except switched out the pepper Jack cheese for Mexican type shredded cheese (as I couldn't find the former), and I only put a sprinkle of extra cheese on top, and used chili powder instead of cayenne; it's got better colour, and I had little people eating this dip too! I felt it was spicy enough without the extra cayenne on top. I will definitely be making this again!

FAST EASY  We really enjoyed this, the 2 of us, for super bowl.
Sorry to change recipe and review, but not a blue cheese fan.
I knew recipe would be good for us with different cheese and
thousand island dressing. VERY GOOD  Cayenne fan now on many things. Thanks Chef John. Made  3 small dishes. Froze 2. 
Make again

Love, love, love this dip!! Because I and many I know do not like the stuff, I omitted the blue cheese crumbles and dressing (subbed in ranch - yum!)  and cut back a bit on all the hot ingredients and it was perfect for us! Thanks Chef John for another super recipe!!

This is a great recipe and super popular at our party! If you want to watch your salt be careful using a rotisserie chicken . I am grilling chicken ready next time .. It got too salty for me esp if you use chips to dip! Also try carrots instead of chips!

This recipe makes for a fantastic Buffalo Chicken Dip. Definitely a crowd-pleaser! I normally have some Paleo-dieters in the group when I make this, as well as a couple who are lactose-intolerant to some degree, so I tend to use less cheese. But everyone always loves it, regardless. First, I use basically the entire rotisserie chicken. Might as well, right? I used to use the 2 packages of cream cheese, but tried it with 1.5 recently, and it was still perfectly delicious. I leave out the bleu cheese crumbles, depending on the price and how much I feel like searching for it in the abyss that is the cheese counter. Also, I leave out the extra pepper jack on top and the cayenne. This dish is great because you can alter quantities, leave things out, and add things in, and it's always a home run!

This turned out really great! I used Louisiana's Pure Crystal hot souce with a pinch of cayenne pepper in the dip and on top before baking. It was a hit at my New Years Eve party! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This dip made my Christmas Day a whole new experience. We had it as a horsdeveurs and it was a hit. It had a hot, spicy taste, and the chicken added some very nice texture. It was much spicier than expected, but I love spicy! I prefer this over the original Frank's recipe because it is a bit spicier. Thanks!

I love this recipe. I made some changes because my girlfriend doesn't like blue cheese. So substituted A cup of ranch dressing. I also used sharp white  Cheddar,  Fontina and pepper jack, a little over a cup total. I did use 2 8oz of cream cheese and used old bay seasoning plus cayenne pepper. I also used boneless 3 boneless chicken breasts. I boiled them in salt water for 1 hr. Then I shredded the chicken mixed everything in a sauce pan mixed it and then transferred it to my small croc pot. IT WAS THE FIRST DIP TO GO AT THE PARTY!!! AWESOME!!!!

I've made this was roasted chicken and canned chicken, and i can definitely say I prefer the roasted chicken, although it goes either way.  I added more pepper jack/cheddar blend for the cheese and chunky blue cheese in addition to the blue cheese crumbles.  I don't have any leftovers.

Everyone loves this dip!  I've made it multiple times and it always gets compliments. If you are not a blue cheese lover substitute ranch dressing for blue cheese (keep the crumbles) or do 1/4 c blue and 1/4 c ranch. If you don't have rotisserie chicken, cube some chicken breast and boil in water or broth. I do prefer the dark and white meats of the rotisserie chicken, though. If the top doesn't brown enough during cooking give it a quick pass under the broiler.

This was amazing.  Easy and delicious.  Used only 1/4 cup hot sauce and left out the blue cheese.  Everyone loved it.   I wonder if I can freeze leftovers

This is fantastic.  I've made it more than once and it's a hit every time.  The only thing I added was an additional sprinkle of blue cheese crumbles and cayenne pepper on the top before baking.

Awesome recipient!  Rarely does chef John disappoint. I notice that the age-old debate of blue cheese vs.ranch is alive and well in the reviews for this recipe.  If you're a blue cheese loyalist then you'll love the recipe as-is; no mods necessary.

Every time I make this dip, I get asked for the recipe.  It's always a hit at football parties, tailgating and bbqs.  I usually double the recipe and make two batches because it goes fast.

This was such a hit!  I used ranch dressing in stead of blue cheese. I also melted the cream cheese a little before putting all the ingredients together so I could mix it better.  I will definitely be making this again

Oh yummy!!!!  Keep this in your stash!  So easy!  Only change was I used half blue cheese and half ranch in the half cup dose.  No crumbled blue cheese.  Did 1 tsp of old bay!!  Perfect amount of spicy for sure!!
