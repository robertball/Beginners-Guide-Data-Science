We are a family of tea lovers.  We drink it with just about every meal and have to add sugar and lemon juice to each glass.  I loved the idea of using the concentrate but didn't have it on hand so I tried it with lemonade mix (Crystal Light) and it turned out perfectly. Thanks for the idea Sue-ellen.

I really liked this, my husband was so/so so I gave it four stars, I used half a can of lemonade concentrats to equal the 6 oz. called for, perhaps people misread and used the full 12 oz. resulting in an overly strong lemon taste.....

I love lemon flavor ice tea and this was great. I added more sugar (added 1 additional cup) because we were going to be outside and it is summer time and it is hot outside, plus I knew we were going to add ice to the tea mixture. But to us, adding the 1 additional cup did not make it too sweet it was just right.

EXCELLENT!! I have made this a number of times now...and it is always a hit!! I bring the recipe with!  I have used a bunch of different concentrates and they are all wonderful.  I make a double batch and use a raspberry lemonade and a fruit punch...very good!

I didn't have lemonade concentrate, so I used 1/2 cup lemon juice and an additional 3/4 cup of sugar. However, I found that the tea flavor wasn't quite strong enough for that much water. I think next time I'd use more tea bags and less lemon.

I used decaf orange pekoe tea bags as I am expecting and trying to cut down on caffeine and it turned out great.  I added 1 extra tea bag and decreased the concentrate by a bit for less sweet.

What a refreshing idea! The concentrate definitely beats squeezing lemons any day. I found that a whole can was a little to much though, a half a can of the lemonade concentrate works best for our taste. It's a keeper!!

I used Tazo Passion Tea instead of black tea and omitted the sugar.  It tasted just as great at the Starbucks version - herbal and refreshing!

I made this with "mint medley" tea and it's awesome!  Cool and refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness and lemon.  Make sure you're using just 6 oz. of lemonade concentrate.  This will be a staple in my fridge this summer, for sure.

This was delicious! I ordered sweet tea in a little country diner a few years back in Daytona Beach, and this was what they served. I fell in love with it and traveled 25 miles every Friday to buy a glass.  The restaurant closed and I have not been able to find any since! This was it! Thanks!

I doubled the tea bags and sugar and used raspberry lemonade concentrate.  It is good.  Does turn out just like Snapple.

This is a fantastic recipe, I've made this multiple times now and it's turned out great each time.  However, you might want to add more sugar to the mix since the recipe does not suggest enough. Using fresh lime juice might work better as well as I used concentrate the first time and it did not taste right.  Overall, a great recipe!

This recipe was too sweet and tasted like a Snapple Iced Tea! However, some people enjoy Snapple, so I give it 3 stars. I won't make it again.

I bought the lemonade concentrate without looking at the ounces--after I made it (everyone LOVED) I realized I was only supposed to have added 6 oz not the 12 0z---but then it was so good, that this might solve some of the problems for people needing to add more sugar

This was great!  I also bruised up a bunch of mint and threw it in there.  It was really refreshing with a heavy dinner of fried food.

This is a quick easy way to make a large batch of Arnold Palmer's.  We are big fans around here.  I think it would be better tasting with freshly made lemonade but this is a good shortcut.

What excellent iced tea! The lemon flavor is just perfect for a hot summer day. However, I did use a little less than the stipulated 1/2 cup of sugar and it still turned out great!

most tea directions state 1 bag for every 8oz of water. this recipe is several bags short (10) for a gallon of water. basically this is a tea-flavored LEMONADE. also, with only 1/2 cup of sugar for a whole gallon, that is barely enough sugar to even taste except the rest of the sweetness must come from the sugar in the lemonage concentrate, but the recipe doesnt state that.

Great concept. I am a southern girl and like my tea a wee bit stronger,lol.  First time around, I made it as is. It proved to be very light and refreshing tending to be more lemony.  Second time, I doubled up on the tea bags and the sugar...perfect balance of flavors.

Yummy!  No changes needed.  I accidently ripped one of the tea bags while stirring but, luckily found a tea strainer and all was well.  Pitcher was gone within the day- and there are only 2 of us at home!

This is a great way to make tea. This will be our standard way of making tea from now on. I can see using limeade and other flavors of concentrate as well.

A gal that worked in a southern restaurant said they sweeten the hot steeping tea and it only takes about  1/2 -1/3 the sugar rather than sweetening when the tea was cold. Makes sense I guess as the sugar would dissolve much better and faster too!
