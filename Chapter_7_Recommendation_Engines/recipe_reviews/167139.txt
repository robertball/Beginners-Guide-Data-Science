I used reduced fat cream cheese, sugar free CHEESECAKE instant pudding and "light" whipped topping. I also made my own homemade graham cracker crust. I think this is very good but next time I make this, I think I'd like to fold some additional strawberries and coconut into the pie instead of just topping the pie with it. My whole family enjoyed this pie. This was very simple, even with the homemade crust and toasting the coconut.

I made lots of changes but I wanted to rate this recipe b/c it helped me in my quest to duplicate the hawaiian pie from a famous breakfast stop!  First I don't use a graham cracker crust, instead I make my own flour pie crust. I also add a handful of chopped pecans to the cream cheese mixture along with 1 pkg dissolved unflavored gelatin (without the gelatin the pie does not set well and falls apart when serving). I pour the mixture into the baked and cooled crust and refrigerate it overnight.  The next day, I mix 1 lb. of strawberries with strawberry glaze and cover the entire pie with it. Right before serving I make fresh whipped cream by beating heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla and I pipe it on to the top of the entire pie.  Finally, I sprinkle it with a little toasted coconut and chopped pecans and ... fabulous! This usually costs me about $7 to make (I only make it when I can get the ingredients on sale) & the restaurant pie we usually buy costs $14 and we can't brag that it's homemade!

I loved it!  Not only simple, but the taste is so cool and refreshing.  I used shortbread pie crust, coconut pudding and also put the coconut in the pie mixture.  I used mandarin orange slices (from fruit cup) on top instead of strawberries.  Orange, coconut and pineapple seemed a better fit to me than strawberries.

Sooo yummy and not too sweet--we love it! Based on some of the other reviews, I made the following changes: used a 9" cake pan (deeper), made my own graham crust, used a six serving size pudding mix, and the whole tub of cool whip; I also put this in the freezer for about three hours and then transferred it to the fridge for the remaining few hours before serving. This set up and served very well. I think next time, though, I will just put the coconut (untoasted, maybe?) right into the pie mixture and use a little more pineapple. This pie was really easy to make and made for an excellent summer dessert.

It was yummy, especially with the changes I made.  I used coconut pudding mix, instead of vanilla.  I also cut the strawberries up and mixed them into the main pie.  I am not using Cool Whip due to the unhealthy ingredients - so I used fresh whipped cream.  Thus delicioso!

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I made my own graham cracker pie crust. Not to sweet but just right. The only change I would make is add more pineapple, there just wasn't enough.

So easy and delicious. It's a cool, light (in texture)dessert that is so different from the ordinary. **Some reviewers complained about the runny consistency, so I took one person's advice and placed it in the freezer for an hour and then transfered it to the refrigerator. It sliced perfectly, so I would do this again. If you love pineapple and coconut, you will LOVE this recipe.

Love this, so perfect for spring and summer, many changes can be made to make it for our individual taste as most recipes given do but does not reflect a bad recipe just how we are. Thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand, but I was very disappointed in it. I added about 1/2 cup coconut to the filling, along with some rum extract and coconut extract (using coconut pudding instead of vanilla, as other reveiwers suggested, is a good idea), but it STILL didn't taste like a pina colada. The pie was just OK. I won't be making it again.

I was looking for a desert I could feed to vegetarians who will not eat gelatin (animal parts boiled up for the cartlidge! sp??) which is in the instant pudding.  So I followed most of the recipe but used a cooked coconut pudding which I made with coconut milk and I added some coconut cream I had in.  I omitted the instant topping but added some whipping cream instead.  I was concerned about it not setting so added just a little pectin too.  I did not pour it into the crust until I cooled it and could see it thickening.  Had it not thickened I was going to heat it up and put a little cornstarch in.  Dressed with the toasted coconut and fruit it looked divine, and when I saw I had enough for two pies I halved it and made one for the adults with a little coconut rum.  Yummy.  Not too many instant puddings for vegetarians so mixed with different flavors this will become my stock desert for our friends.

This is an excellent recipe.  We found a canning recipe to use up our zucchini last year, in which when you're done it tastes almost like crushed pineapple.  We've used the zucchini pineapple in this recipe and in breads.  It's excellent.

This is a good, light tasting pie although not light on calories.  Could easily be made with less calories though.  The only problem I encountered was that it never set up like that pretty picture they have.  I would think without the milk it would set up much easier.  It fell apart as I was dishing it.  I think making your own crust might help that since the store bought are pretty crumbly.  Excellent flavor though and the strawberries and cool whip on top aren't needed unless you really want them :)

Oh my goodness this is good! I was looking for a quick and easy dessert to make the night before an event. I made this using low fat cream cheese and lite Cool Whip. The only tweaking I did was to add about 3/4 tsp of coconut extract to the mix, along with about 2 tbsp of untoasted coconut. Instead of using a graham crust, I used shortbread - personal preference. I let the pie set overnight in the fridge with no issues at all. The next morning, I put the remaining Cool Whip into a ziploc bag, snipped the corner, and piped it around the edge of the pie, as well as the center. I then lined quartered strawberries around the edge and some diced strawberries in the middle. Finally, I topped everything off with the toasted coconut.  Everyone raved about this pie, and it disappeared within 5 minutes!

I made a lower calorie version, using light cream cheese, non fat milk, a reduced fat crust, and pudding and Cool Whip sweetened with Splenda.  It was a hit!  My husband loved it.  Perfect for summer.

This dessert was absolutely delicious!  The only thing I did was add a bit (about a palmful) of toasted coconut to the mix before I put it in the refrigerator to add a little more texture.  Loved it!

I liked the pie but it definitely didn't firm up like it shows in the photo.  I think you really need to drain the pineapple before you put it in and maybe even put a little less whipped topping in

I substituted Splenda and sugar free pudding, liquid flavoring for the flaked coconut, mixed the strawberries in the filling.  Was very popular at work.

Easy and good! I didn't have strawberries, but folded in strawberry preserves and it disappeared quicky!

Make a strawberry glaze using  1/2 pint of quartered strawberries, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water and 3 TBSP cornstarch.  Add fresh strawberries, too, when done.
