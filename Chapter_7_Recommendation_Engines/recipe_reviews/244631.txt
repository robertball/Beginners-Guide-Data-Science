I cut the salt back to 1 teaspoon but otherwise followed the recipe. I found the measuring out from the plastic bag a tedious task so won't do that again, and the mixing with a spatula was a pain, too, so I pulled out my handmixer.  These are so very yummy!  My family just loves them!  I do have to admit that one family member who shall remain nameless asked me to make some without the chocolate chips!  So another batch will be on the way soon.  Mine looked exactly like what the description predicted:  very thin, crispy on the edges, and very buttery!  Thanks, Chef John--once again!

They turned out fluffy and cake-like. What am I doing wrong? I like the flatter and chewy cookie.

These are a very sweet / salty treat.  Mine did not spread like Chef John's, but I used a cookie scoop and did not flatten them at all.  10 minutes at 375 was perfect for a crisp edge and soft middle.  I did use unsalted butter and I am a salt lover but these had a very salty bite to them.  I would back down the Kosher salt to  3/4 to 1 tsp.  
The dough was a bit difficult to deal with chilled in the bowl.  (Very stiff) Next time I would scoop the dough, with a cookie scoop into balls first and then refrigerate.  Then bake the chilled balls.    Note: 2 cups chocolate chips equals a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips.

Great cookies—crispy, buttery, and toffee-like. For my taste, the salt amount was perfect (but some Kosher salt has larger crystals than others, so maybe that was an issue for the previous reviewer? For the record, I used Diamond Crystal). I usually make cookies in a mixer; I was surprised at how fast this was. My butter was super-soft, and I was pretty vigorous with my creaming of the butter and sugars. Next time I'm adding walnuts, because that's how I roll.

I used a gold williams-sonoma baking sheet without parchment paper.  I baked a batch that wasn't chilled and another that was and used the same scooper as shown in video.  Both turned out moderate thickness (not so thin as pictured) but spread evenly (no lump or cakey-ness as others described).  In my oven they took 2 minutes longer than instructed.  For me these were perfection:  crispy bottom and edges with chewy, gooey goodness on top.  Ghirardelli chocolate chips were amazing in these and the dough was delicious too.  Thrilled!  Thanks Chef John!

Amazing!! I used salted butter and only threw a small amount of regular table salt.  Maybe 1/4 tsp?  Followed the rest of the directions to a tee and they turned out perfect!  I decided to cut twix bites into quarters and use them instead of regular chocolate chips for a twist.

Mine were "puffy and cake-like" as another reviewer mentioned once they came from the oven, but rapidly flattened out to thin and crispy edges and chewy centers. I made them as-is and they're excellent. Another time, I would like to try adding a bit of cocoa  to them besides experimenting with different nuts. Thanks, Chef John.

What a great recipe!   However, I just have a few comments on my experiences with this recipe.  I did not have to refrigerate the dough.  The texture was just fine to roll into ping-pong ball sized balls. I slightly flattened the balls before baking.  As other reviews experienced, they did not flatten-out as suggested in the recipe.   Everyone's oven is different. I have a steam oven by Kitchen Aide.  My cookies only took 10 minutes to achieve a crunchy edge and a soft, chewy center.  My comments are definelty not negative toward the recipe itself.  The flavour is fantastic!  This is why Chef John receives 5 stars for this completely nummy cookie!

This cookie is so yummy.  Expect the sweet and salty combination.  I loved that they cooked flat with crispy edges!  I packed them as a treat in my kids lunches for a surprise :) We will be making these again!!!

I've tried a lot of different chocolate chip cookie recipes, and this is one of the best, if not my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. Refrigerating the dough really does make a difference. I tried both with and without refrigerating. Using the cold dough gives the cookies the perfect crispy and chewy texture, and the caramelized, brown butter-like flavor.

Great! However like Marianne I cut the salt back to a tsp and there is a way to make them without refrigerating the dough, simply bake for only 7 minuets instead of the  recipe time and vola! You have a cookie just as good, maybe better!

Much better that Toll House. The only chocolate chip cookie I make now. The only change is that I don't refrigerate before. Tried it the first time, comes out the same, and easier to handle. THANK YOU Chef John.

These are delicious!  I only noticed after I had started this recipe  the direction to refrigerate the dough for two hours in the fridge to have it become firm.  I didn't have the time so I put the dough, bagged in a single layer of mounds in a large freezer bag, and put it in the freezer for 30 minutes and it was firm.   I also cut back on the salt to just under one teaspoon and that was enough.   I used a small cookie scoop which made an easy job of putting out the cookie dough  from the large freezer bag onto the cookie sheet which I used parchment paper on for easy clean up.  The scoop holds one tablespoon and made uniform sized cookies for perfect baking.  I baked them for 11 minutes at the 375 F which was perfect for a golden brown cookie!  These cookies have a little outside crispiness once they're cooled and the next day they are crunchier and really scrumptious!

I did make some minor changes.  I used salted butter so I cut the salt back to 1/4 tsp.  I could still taste just the slightest bit of salt and it was perfect. 

I used my stand mixer and did not whisk the dry ingredients separately, just put them into the wet ingredients without combining first.  It really doesn't matter, I think it's just a "chef thing" to dirty another bowl LOL! 

I didn't refrigerate the dough, so my baking time was 10 minutes, not 12.  I've got an oven thermometer, so my oven is spot on -- they were perfect!  

I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips since that's what I had on hand.  I made my cookies a little smaller perhaps, a little smaller than golf balls, and spaced them 3" apart.  I got 42 cookies that way.  

Also, some people were disappointed that theirs were fluffy & cake-like & didn't flatten out.  Mine looked that way too, but were very crunchy anyway once cooled, not soft at all.   

I took some to some friends who participate in a charity group making hand-made bed pads for cancer patients out of clean used sheets.  There were only six or seven people there this morning and they devoured the dozen & a half cookies in no time!  Most were senior ladies who only ate one, and the empty bag ended up near the only gentleman in the group -- hmmm.  He pleaded not guilty. :)

Made these again...and again...and again. Seems everything shared by Chef John is an immediate family & friend favorite! These cook up exactly as described, and a batch of 32 cookies goes in a day or two! Don’t change a thing when making these. They are THE BEST chocolate chip you’ll eat.

These cookies came out absolutely delicious. However, after meticulously following the instructions, my Cookies did not come out large and flat but rather small and cake-like - the results I’ve gotten from other recipes. I tried the recipe again - ensuring my oven was thoroughly preheated, the dough was chilled thoroughly, that I used baking SODA and not powder. Everything checked, and double checked, and still the flat style eluded me. Perhaps a few more batches of practice will yield better results.

I thought I followed the recipe exactly, but my cookies came out the same shape they went in, they didn't spread out at all, and were hard... The same day I made the PB cookies, and they came out like the chocolate chip ones were supposed too... not sure what would cause this lack of spreading, too much flour maybe?  Always on the hunt for a chewy big chocolate cookies, and I can't seem to find it/make them properly... not sure what I'm doing wrong.

I made this on a whim and these came out exactly as described- but tasted more like sugar cookies than traditional chocolate chip. They're thin but  very soft in the middle (not cakey).  The only thing I'd change is lowering the amount of chocolate chips - maybe even halving it because the chocolate chip flavor is a bit overpowering.

Very simple and straight forward recipe. Good idea using parchment paper,  makes clean up much easier and the cookies slide right off the paper. I didn't transfer the dough to a plastic bag. I just put the cover on my mixing bowl and put it in the fridge. It worked fine and eliminated a messy step! These will definitely be my "go to " chocolate chip cookies! May try adding nuts next time.

Made these just as the recipe calls for, the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. My husband says they taste just like the ones his Aunt used to make.  I will never make any other CC recipe again.

I always learn something new with Chef John's videos. I've been baking for years, but his tips on chilling the dough & using parchment and a tablespoon-sized disher made the work and cleanup so much easier.  The cookies themselves are fabulous!

These just didn't hit the mark for us. Certainly buttery, perhaps a bit overly so. I refrigerated the dough as per the recipe and the first batch was puffed up and barely spread at all. Solved that by pressing the dough down before baking so the rest were crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the centers.  If there is a next time, I might be inclined to add a very few crystals of Kosher salt to the tops before baking.

My cookies didn't come out flat and chewy, but puffy and cake like instead. I was careful with ingredients (yes I used baking soda) but the only thing I can think of is not whipping the butter sugar mixture enough? I wish I had used a mixer because I just mixed until it was very smooth then my arm told me to quit. I also found the batter extremely hard after being refrigerated for 2 hours. Lastly, I have a convection oven which converts the temperature lower for recipes with traditional ovens. But at the time limit they didn't seem nearly done.  So...all this to say, the taste is there but the texture will take some practice and modifications.

This is the 2nd recipe that  I attempted to make via Chef John and both times, the results differ from the Chef, despite meticulously following the recipes.   Based on the reviews here, yes the cookies are yummy.  However, they did not come out thin and crispy.  The cookies are more soft and chewy.  Maybe Chef John can address this situation.

These came out so good!!! Just like how they tasted when my aunt made them growing up. Not too soft, not too crispy, just right. Goldilocks chocolate chip cookies.

Thanks so much!

Made this twice. Both times they've never flattened/thinned out like in the video or pictures which is pretty disappointing. The taste is great though and goes well with milk. I just wonder if there needs to be more clarifcation on this recipe since other people are having the same issue.

cookies were delish,  the texture was not quite like advertised. not sure what I did wrong. butter was salted. maybe used 1 teaspoon instead of 3/4 tsp. of salt, as I didn't have kosher. texture was crispy, not chewy and crispy on edges.  kept the dough chilled while I was baking. maybe cooked to long, 12 minutes. all in all, they were really good.

These are amazing!  I recommend watching the video first as I have been making cookies for over 20 years and didn’t know some of the pointers Chef John had.  These came out of the oven exactly like they should, crispy around the edges and gooey inside!

I made this exactly as written (except I refrigerated overnight) and they were excellent. I did not find them to salty or to sweet. I did make them in three batches and the warmer my dough got the more cake like and less flat the cookie got. I would definitely recommend keeping the dough cold right until it goes into the oven! I’ll definitely make these again.

followed everything except refrigerating the dough that long.   Only did for 20 minutes.   They didn't spread and are more cake like.   However they do taste delicious!

Glad I watched the video as the recipe did not specify that a mixer was not required.
Instead of chilling the dough in a baggie, I scooped the dough into approximately 1.5 Tbl mounds onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet before placing into the freezer; then, I baked the desired number of cookies as stated in the recipe. Crispy exterior, chewy interior... deliciously buttery!

Delicious!!! I accidentally forgot to put them in the fridge, but instead cooked them right away and they were a beautiful cookie!! And I didn't have any chocolate chips either, and they were great!!!
My family said that they taste almost like lemon cookies. But then again, I like lemon cookies!!!

Ok I have to say I was skeptical that a chocolate chip cookies would be better than Nestle Tollhouse but I was wrong.  Mine came out just as pictured.  Great combination of sweet and salty. My only deviation is I did NOT refrigerate the dough.
They get puffy and then just as they start to get evenly brown they start to sink and then I take out of oven.  11 minutes for my oven.

This was the first time that I had refrigerated the dough and it did wonders for the texture.  They were very chewy and were some of the best cookies I've ever made.  I used milk chocolate chips for my own preference and it turned out awesome.   I over-baked one batch, but they still tasted good and the recipe was pretty forgiving.  The recipe says 16 servings, but I doubled it and it made close to 6 dozen cookies.  I'm definitely going to use this recipe again!

This is my go to cookie recipe. I've made this recipe so many times, and I don't make any changes. I've refrigerated the cookies before, however, and didn't see a difference. So if you don't have time, don't worry about it. I also like warm fresh cookies. So whenever I make the dough, I form them into balls and place them on a plate in the freezer. Once, they've hardened and won't stick, I place them all in a freezer ziplock bag. This just makes sure that they don't all stick together. Whenever I want a cookie, I set the oven to 375 (like the recipe states) and put it in for about 12 minutes or until they're brown. Fresh cookies every time! Also, it's on my bucket list to cook with Chef John. I use all of his recipes!

Review 5/5/19 - I used half and half instead of milk and baked them on a Silpat, not parchment. They came out all puffy and not crispy. I even baked them an extra 10 minutes to try and crisp them up! No worky.

Chef John, could have these changes to your recipe caused this? (insert frowny emoji) ;-)

UPDATE 5/9/19 - It WAS the Silpat! I did it again but with parchment, also flattened them out per the suggestion of one subscriber. Success! Crispy! Don't use a Silpat!

My cookies were cakey so I started researching recipes and found this is the same recipe as Alton Brown except AB uses 2 ounces of milk not 2 TBSP other than that exact same recipe.....I tried adding more milk and they were slightly thinner.....finally after many batches I found that adding less flour got me the cookies I was looking for.....I used 1 3/4 cups flour and kept everything else the same including 2 ounces of milk vs 2 TBSP! 3 stars because the cookies were still good even if they were cakey :)

Myself and the family did not enjoy this recipe.  The use of kosher salt leaves the majority of the batter tasting bland, with the occasional unpleasant hit of large salt grains giving an overpowering salty taste in some bites.  Also leaves a greasy feel on the fingers.  Won't make again.

So wonderful!
I "veganized" the recipe and it's still amazing.  Here are my changes: 1 cup whole wheat flour + 1 1/4 cup all purpose flour; only used 1/2 cup of white sugar, and didn't pack my brown sugar; no egg - 3 T unsweetened apple sauce; 2 T plant milk (I used rice milk); vegan chocolate chips (Wegmans' brand or Trader Joe's are vegan, and cheaper than those in specialty stores with "vegan" designation).
Chilling dough is important. Cooking time was 12-14 minutes and they came out better on a metal cookie sheet with parchment than on my stone.

I think I must have done SOMETHING wrong. I followed the recipe to a T.  The cookies were greasy, spread out (yes, I cooled them) and very chewy to the point that they got stuck in your teeth.  No crispy edge or chewy middle.  I only had dark brown sugar, so could that explain all the issues????

Fantastic! I made exactly as written except when chilling the dough I didn't transfer to a bag, I just covered the pyrex mixing bowl with saran wrap. Wonderfully thin, crisp, chewy cookies.

This will be my go to Choco Chip recipe.  I made the dough before reading the comments where people mentioned these were more cake like than they expected.  First tray came out thick and cake-like which is what I did not want.  I wanted thinner and a bit caramelized like it says in the intro.  The trick is to flatten out the cookies a bit before baking.  they came out thinner and with that slightly crispy and slightly chewy consistency I was looking for. This is exactly the cookie I was looking for.

These were great! My bf is the baker and he praised them! I did not put the dough into a bag, but a plastic bowl with Saran Wrap. I chilled it for a few hours and followed the rest of the directions. The only thing I did differently was that I used half the amount of chocolate chips. Just a personal preference. Finally- my cookies did not “flatten”. I lightly pressed down when I put them on the pan and they came out cookie shaped.  I will make these again!

I absolutely loved this recipe, so easy peasy! I reduced my white sugar to half a cup instead of 1 full cup and still used half cup dark brown sugar, the sweetness was still there and delicious! Also added half cup chopped pecans.

When I made these cookies, I used a watermelon baller to form the cookies. They wouldn't come out nicely, so I gave up on that & ended up using it just for measurement. I baked them round, assuming they would spread out. They didn't. I pushed them down a bit, froze some, completely flattened some, put a few in the hot sun, I did everything I could think of. I changed the oven time, the temperature, anything! These cookies were not tender & bubbly. What may have caused this? (They tasted good, though a bit salty)

I made them three times. !!! My scooper must rbe smaller than Chef Johns because my cookies were smaller.
I’ll buy a larger scooper instead of using my melon baller.

Awesome recipe!! Husband absolutely loved  these chocolate chip cookies, he said they’re the best I’ve ever made! I didn’t change anything in the recipe except I had really small eggs so I used two instead of one. Perfectly crispy &  chewy yet moist and delicious. Thank you Chef John!

These came out really thick and tasted liked normal cookies not amazing like most of chef Johns recipes. (Got a lot of compliments when i bought these in tho)

On my second go i got European butter and they flattened better. from a little searching around it seems you need more butter to get them a bit flatter, so for my next batch im going to add half a stick (1/4 cup) to the mix and see how those turn out with normal butter

Chef John's recipes never let me down. These cookies turned out great! Next time I will reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon considering the baking soda. I also added toffee bits and walnuts just to be different.

I love Chef John.   But  I dont love chocolate chip cookies and never have.  I was a weird kid.

But  the main reasons I dont like traditional ones is they are too cakey.   Too heavy.  

So I was delighted to try this one since texture is everything to me in a cookie.   Followed directions and ended up with thinner cakey cookies.   Very disappointing.  Not at ALL like the pictures or his video. 

So I set the oven temp down to 340, rolled them into balls and then flattened them and got the texture better.   Still not perfect.   

I am wondering if I need a artisan-type butter that melts better than Land-O-Lakes does.  Kerrygold maybe.   Or the Amish butters. 

Just not impressed with the recipe as it stands.

Came out just as pictured. Added a bit less choc. chips, about 1 1/4 cups semi sweet chips and 1/4 cup bitter sweet. Used table salt as per bakeres note. Baked at 350. Only refrigerated half hour. .Used cookie scoop and they baked in 8 minutes. Thank you.

I love Chef John's recipes and these are no exception.  I did cut back on the salt to just 1/2 a tsp.  Do yourself a favor and  mix them up in the KitchenAid and stir the chocolate chips in at the end.

Holds good shape, thick to allow for a soft center and slightly crispy outside.  Yum!

I've had a hard time finding a chocolate chip cookie recipe that I love, but these are amazing!  I only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter  (and way less chocolate chips but that's only because I don't like a lot of them).  They still turned out crunchy and delicious.  Yum!

I made no changes and the texture of the cookie is a tea cake not a chocolate chip cookie. Definitely cannot bake without parchment. I monitored the cookies carefully but it is was difficult to determine golden brown for me without scorching  the bottom. I am an experienced baker and I do not suggest this recipe to toll house chocolate chip cookie lovers.

Chef John was one of my Culinary Instructor's at the California Culinary Academy about 15 years ago. He was one of the more memorable and effective instructors. Now as a Culinary Instructor myself at the high school level, I've had my own students use this recipe and all I hear is " Can we make chocolate chip cookies again?" 

Selfishly, I prefer crispy, chewy chocolate chip cookies which is why I had my students make it. They have their own preferences, of course, but it's not their classroom. ;) 

If you like your chocolate chip cookies this way, and follow the recipe precisely as it is written, you should be very satisfied with the results! Thanks Chef John!

Awesome tasting cookies!!!  I followed your recipe 'almost 'exactly . Mine look wonder and thin but as thin as yours. Couldn't see thru when held up to the light.  I didn't have  actual parchment paper. I had a paper made by Reynolds that is parchment on one side and foil on the other. Also , left dough in fridge overnight. Would one or both of these be the problem? Also ..when I watched video... it looked as though you added more than 2tbs of milk. ?
I love your recipes and your videos!!!! Thank you.??

This recipe was delicious!  I used salted butter and cut back on the table salt. Next time I will follow the instructions to use softened butter. I worked much harder than necessary creaming in the sugars. Also, I will bake them for the suggested 12 mins... I cooked them a minute longer and they were a bit over done. I will definitely make them again!!

I made these fabulous cookies and they were a big hit.  The only deviation from the recipe was I used 1/2 the amount of vanilla and the other 1/2 peppermint flavoring.  It gave them that smooth vanilla flavor but the peppermint was just the right amount to taste it without being overwhelming.  They might even be good with a bit of crushed candy cane in top for the holidays.

These were OK. Definitely too salty; plus they never were as thin and crunchy as I expected. Will try again with less salt and more milk for a thinner mixture to hopefully have a crunchy, delicate cookie.

These were really good. His butter looked slightly different than mine, I had Costco unsalted butter on hand and I softened it using my microwave's soften feature, and it worked out well.  Maybe I didn't have my egg at room temperature but he didn't say that so I used them straight from the fridge. Also, I used fat free milk and not almond milk. Mine didn't come out as flat as this recipe, but they still tasted and looked delicious, so I'm not complaining. Mine had to cook for 10 minutes and they turned out perfect - a full 12 mins and they were burning. 

I love Chef John's recipes because he explains everything and adds in the flavor of his humor :)

Perfect! If you are using salted butter, I would definitely cut back on the salt to 3/4 tsp. And if you are going to cook them right away without refrigerating them, you should cook them less than 10 min. I'd start checking at around 7-8min. But refrigerating them made a difference in the texture and taste. Thanks Chef John for another outstanding recipe!

The crisp of a rice krispie treat and the chewiness of a shmore.  

Changes:  Not much, didn't have saltless butter so I left the salt out and beat the butter longer.  Came out fluffy and oh so delicious!  Left out some sugar too, just a tad off the top.  I wasn't missing it at all during the taste testing.

Only used 1 and a 1/2 cups chocolate chips and they were perfect.  Great recipe.  My new favorite!
