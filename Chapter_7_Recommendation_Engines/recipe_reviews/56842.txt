I don't know what I did wrong but my dish was not bubbly while baking.  It was very dry and really a disappointment after shredding all those carrots.

Am I missing something in the instructions?  Do the carrots have to be pre-cooked?  Still very raw after 25 mins. and cooking longer didn't help.  Should the casserole be covered?  Followed the recipe as written, but my casserole was a failure.

This recipe is great! Got many favorable comments at church dinner. Very flexible. Can be prepared.cooked and finished-off later. Leftovers were even better. A little different in a good way. Try it.

This carrot casserole is wonderful.  It is both easy and tasty.  My family was not that fond of carrots but once they tasted this, it has become a new favorite (they still won't eat carrots any other way).  I plan on doubling it for an upcoming church supper and will have copies of the recipe available as I am sure they will love it as much as we do.

No one liked this.  Not enough cream cheese.  I used matchstick carrots, so at least I didn't go through all the work of shredding the carrots.

My husband could go forever without eating a vegetable. He does not like carrots. He really liked this. Thank you.

Too much cream cheese.  I could only eat a little bit of this.  I'd cut down on the cream cheese if I were to ever make it again.

This was okay, but not wonderful.  The taste was right on, but the carrots were not tender enough.  Were you supposed to boil or cook them in some way before hand?

must chill dough very well - and bake for the entire 10 mins.  my first batch was not chilled long enough and I only baked for 8 mins.  but after I adjusted, they were very good.
