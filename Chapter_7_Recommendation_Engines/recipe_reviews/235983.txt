I had these at a restaurant once and thought I had to try making them myself. Delicious! I did skip the soaking part though.Looking for something different?, this is a good alternative  to traditional nachos.

I will definitely be making these again!! OH Man are they good! I had some gorgeous, ripe avocados and left over skirt steak to eat up. I went looking for a recipe & this is the one I picked!! I cooked off some bacon added the steak, onions along with chopped Hatch chilies. I fried the potato planks in the bacon fat. Stacked everything up, drizzled ranch dressing over the whole shabang & topped it all off with slices of California avocados!! Dinner is DONE::)) THANK YOU DaDD
