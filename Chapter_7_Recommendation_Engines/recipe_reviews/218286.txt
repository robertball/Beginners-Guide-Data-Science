This was an awesome pasta.. But I changed the recipe some what. I bought the chorizo from the meat market down the street. I didn't grill it because chorizo has so much flavor I didn't want to loose it and you will with grilling, so I steamed/water boiled it in a pan. When I pulled the sausage out of the pan I kept all the grease in there and sauteed the onions, bell pepper and mushrooms in the grease.. I didn't use the extra 1 tablespoon butter. It was great! :) My husband really loved it too.

This is a great recipe! I made a few minor changes, which is easy to do with most "one dish" dinners. I sauteed the mushrooms in about one cup dry white wine and then added the already partially sauteed onions and peppers. I also added the garlic at this time. After the mushrooms were soft, I added the butter, parmesan, cream and Chorizo. To this I added a drained 12 ounce can of black beans. I tasted it and it brought tears to my eyes. Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome!!! The only thing I changed was sauteing the onion and garlic then adding the rest of the veggies followed by the cream and cheese. It was amazing!!!!

This was really good. My family and I really enjoyed it. I used Portuguese Chourico links and instead of grilling them I just sauteed them in a pan with the onion and pepper. I also left out the mushrooms because we are not mushroom eating people. Will certainly make this again. Thanks Jen.

Awesome!  The grocery store unfortunately didnt have chorizo so I bought hot Italian sausage and it was still fantastic.  Will definitely try and find chorizo for next time.  Thanks for this!

We absolutely LOVE this! We have a family of 8 and you can bulk this up just by adding extra noodles and sauce and there is still plenty of meat and veggies! I use bulk chorizo to spread it further than chunked links. And this recipe is so forgiving! I used an extra 1/2 box penne tonight so I added an extra 1/2 of the sauce recipe. Didn't have enough butter this time, but 1 cup was plenty. You can cook the sauce a little, a lot, have the veggies crunchy, soft, more butter, less butter, etc. and it still turns out wonderfully! Like I said, forgiving recipe! One of our faves and definitely worth a try if you're looking for something new.

The whole family loved this. My daughter asked for it again already, saying she's dreaming about it. My changes: halved the butter, used ground chorizo as I already had it; cooked onions and garlic together, then added chorizo, cooked, then added peppers. Left out mushrooms. I don't think my changes altered the overall flavor too much, at least I hope...if Jen reads this I think it's a great recipe. Thank you!

My family LOVED this dish.  I can't eat parm cheese so I just left it out.  We didn't miss it at all.  We didn't grill the sausage- I just took it out of the casing and browned it like hamburger meat.  I used portabella mushrooms so the sauce was a funny gray color.  Next time I will stick with the white mushrooms just for aesthetics.  Thank you Jen for a great meal!

This was great and very flavorful.  The chorizo in this is so yummy.  I made it very close to the recipe except a little less butter.  Other than that there is nothing I would change.  
My husband had three servings and my picky 8 year old son had seconds (except for the red peppers).
It may use a couple of pans but so worth the extra dish washing.

I have made this twice. This recipe is killer!  The only change I made was to ad a little Italian seasoning. One time I used chorizo as the recipe called for, the other time I used diced up chicken breast. Both were delicious. Coworkers told me that it was the best pasta dish they had eaten.

This recipe was great! I did take the casing off the sausage and used it ground instead, kept the pepper flakes out and I only used 1/2 c. of butter instead of 1 cup. It got a 9.5 from my husband and a 9 from our 9 year old son. Very flavorful. Will definitely make again!

This was the first time I had used (or even tasted) chorizo.  It was a great recipe to try it out!  I loved it!
I did change the recipe a little to my personal preference...3/4 cup of butter instead of a full cup, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 cup of milk, 1/8 tsp crushed red peppers.  I also used one chopped portobello mushroom instead of button mushrooms, which gave this dish great flavor!  
My boyfriend and I are in love with this recipe, and will be making it again!  It will now be a staple for us.
As amazing as I thought this was, the leftovers left something to be desired.  While my co-worker enjoyed it and said it was "restaurant-quality" :) 
I felt that the sauce had separated and was very very greasy tasting.  I enjoyed it much more when it was fresh.
I will scale back the recipe next time, as this made enough to feed a small army!

Followed recipe with only the following substitution; used 1 cup Lactose Free Milk in place of the heavy whipping cream. This dish is Delicious with a capital D! We loved it. You could also use Sweet Italian Sausage or any sauage for that matter. Very creamy and very yummy! It's in the Quick & Easy file. I'll make again soon on nights I need a quick, easy, filling and DELICIOUS dinner.

I pretty much followed the recipe minus the mushrooms. (BF doesn't like them)  Easy and delicious!  The only other thing I did differently was to add the red bell pepper strips to the onion and garlic after it was translucent and before adding the pepper flakes and actually making the sauce.  Oh, only used 1/2 cup butter too.

AWESOME! I couldn't find chorizo in links anywhere, so I ended up using the bulk, which I cooked up and drained REALLY well. I only used 1 stick of butter and I thought that was plenty, and used shell pasta because that's what the little guy requested, but followed the recipe otherwise. This had great flavor and a nice spicy kick to it, which we LOVED! I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Well the chorizo was not the kind called for in the recipe so I was not able to cook like the recipe called for. I follwed the rest of the recipe and the family loved it.

This was better than average.  Prep time seems off by some.  And the dishes take longer than the prep.  I had to use bulk chorizo too, which could've only made it better.  That "other" chorizo in the ingredients isn't that good.  As much as I wanted it to be 5 stars for the effort, it just wasn't.

I reduced the recipe to a portion for two. I used fresh chorizo as called for in the recipe. If you are using pre cooked or smoked chorizo it can be added with the peppers and onions at the end. Any type of pasta will work including linguine. Thanks for a really good recipe.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was a tasty treat. I didn't have any whipping cream so I used a mix of table cream and 3% milk but it was still lovely. Easy and delicious!

This was very good.  I subbed Linguica for chorizo.  I also subbed half and half for the heavy cream, used fresh mushrooms and green peppers (all I had).  I used a reviewers suggestion and sautéed sausage first rather than grill, removed sausage from pan and sautéed vegetables in pan drippings.  A keeper!

So good - plan to add chicken next time and a little more heat. I also used half-and-half instead of cream and 1/2 the margarine. Added onion and a little Cholula.

This a a really great recipe.  I used spicy chorizo that we got from our CSA share and used a stove-top grill pan as it is freezing here!   I cut back on the butter (using only 1 stick), and I added more cracked red pepper.   It was rich without being too greasy.  I think 1 cup of butter would be too much.  Also, I think whole or low fat milk would work fine instead of heavy cream, but I did use HC this time.  It was very yummy and there were lots of left overs.  If using spinach wait until the very end to add, or else it will be slimy.

Other than some heat, this was really bland. I substituted some squash instead of the red pepper due to it being in season.  This needs a lot of work before I try it again.

The sausage did not go with the rest of the ingredients. And 1 cup of butter seriously? So many things wrong with this recipe. I added the red pepper to the sauteed vegetables instead of the cream to flavor them. Good idea executed poorly in this recipe.

Great recipe that lends itself to a bit of chopping and changing. Used Philadelphia cooking cream instead of straight cream, added some chicken stock and a dash of cooking wine which just lifts everything. Didn't have any peppers so I just folded some spinach leaves in at the end. I forgot the cheese but was still yum. Thank you for a brilliant recipe.

This was loved by my whole family! I used bulk chorizo rather than link and did not have heavy cream but...did not miss it at all! I'm sure the cream would've added a lot to it; however, it already has a lot of butter and I did not want to have to run to the store for it. Wonderful flavor! I had to stop my 13 yr old daughter from going for 3rds!

Yummy and flavorful! I made a few modifications, broke the chorizo out of the casing and sauted the meat like you would ground beef, then satued the veggies in that fat that was left over and cut out about half the butter in the sauce to make it a little healthier. I used unsalted butter for the sauce so I also added a pinch of salt to the final product.

Picky husband had seconds and so did the kids! Changes- no mushrooms.  crumbled sweet italian sausage and crushed red pepper (what I had on hand). I used 2 tsp of the pepper in place of the 1/4c pepper flakes.

I have never reviewed a recipe before but I made this last night and it was solid. I'm not a mushroom guy and I had some jalapenos in my garden that were begging to be used so I substituted. Not because the recipe needed it, just because the jalapenos were calling. I sliced them long ways and thin and it added that flavor I love. I would definitely make this again. oh...and the picture had tortellini in it and I had some so I thought...why not? I used that instead of penne. I was happy with the result.

As it is written would have been too much butter. I only used one stick of butter. Also cooked mushrooms down in some dry white wine as suggested from another reviewer.  Came together great with these changes.

Excellent. I halved the recipe because it was only the two of us and there was still leftovers.  I did halve the butter as some had mentioned here, I also cooked the chorizo in the oven and used some of the drippings when sauteing the vegetables. I removed the casing on the chorizo and crumbled it as the casing was too tough. Will  make again for sure!

My husband and I were very impressed with this dish. He said it was one of the best things I ever made. I did change a few things. I used vegan chorizo from Trader Joe's because we like it and I omitted the red pepper. I think it would be great in the recipe I just didn't have one on hand. I have made this twice now and it's come out great both times.

I made a few changes, and this recipe was delicious!
I used Mexican Chorizo, removed casing, cooked it up and set it aside. Trying to reserve as much of the chorizo juice and oil in the pan as I could. Then I added the butter, garlic, and onion, sautéed until garlic was soft, and onion was transparent. I didn't have heavy cream, so I needed to improvise; I used about 4.5oz of cream cheese and a cup of milk, then that combine, then added that then the parmesan cheese. I kept the flame very low and constantly stirred to make sure the milk and cream cheese wasn't being over cooked. I omitted the pepper flakes because honestly, it just didn't need it, because the chorizo was so spicy. I also omitted the mushrooms, as I'm allergic. But I needed a vegetable in there besides the red pepper, so I added a heaping handful of fresh spinach with the chopped red pepper with the rest of the butter. Once pasta was ready I added that to the sauce pan, as well as the chorizo, and combined. I will definitely be making this again. It was very easy, quick, and delicious. Boyfriend loved it as well. :)

Excellent new pasta dish to add to my cooking arsenal! Hubby loved it!  I loved it! Only thing I did differently was cooked chorizo links on Cuisinart grill (just didn't want to grill in the cold & hubby was holding the baby--can't interrupt that!!). Not only is this a great dish but the sauce tastes similar to that used in a dish of one of our favorite restaurants...I think I can alter the sauce and make another dish at home!

Most often I follow the recipe the whole way through, which i did tonight but added the black beans for more protein.   Great flavor!  I would definitely like to make this again.   And yes,  it does make a lot for two plus kiddo.   Plan ahead if you don't like leftovers.

Changed to Vegan for dietary reasons and this is one of the best changed recipes I have made. 

Substituted with 
- Trader Joe's Chorizo 
- Almond milk based cream 
- dairy free vegan butter 
Absolutely amazing. Thank you for the inspiration.

Absolutely fantastic!! I removed the chorizo from the casing and cooked it like ground beef. I used the chorizo grease to make the base of the creamy sauce instead of a cup of butter. This is a restaurant-quality meal and very, very easy to make.

I made adjustments like not mushrooms bc my husband can't eat them. I only used 3 tablespoons of butter and some oil with the chopped onions and red peppers.  Sauté them a bit with salt and pepper and added the cream and when the chorizo was done I added it.  Salt and pepper to taste and it was perfect. As usual I cooked the chorizo with my cast iron frying pan seasoned with oil .  Came out great and my hubby was so happy especially with the red pepper flakes on his serving (I don't like hot)

Simply the best pasta recipe on Allrecipies for me so far.  It was difficult to wait to review after making it twice.  I prepared As-Is and it was outstanding!  Be sure to drain and soak up all the grease from the chorizo.  The next time I made it I modified it to be smoky and with more meat so it was amazing - better than any best restaurant.  I added smoked paprika and substituted smoked sea salt along with adding garlic shrimp and shredded grilled chicken.  Also added ¼ c cream cheese to sauce and used half & half instead of cream.  Topped it with chopped bacon and fresh ground black pepper.  Next time I’ll see how it turns out with half the butter and milk, the calories must be ridiculous.

This dish does take a few pots and pans to make but it is worth it.  I stuck right to the recipe, but next time I think I'll chop up the red bell pepper instead of slicing.  In order to get them cooked I sort of had to over cook the onions and mushrooms (for my taste).  I saw lots of people cut back on the butter, but the reason it has so much is to make the alfredo sauce(butter, parm, cream), so if you want that rich alfredo taste you sort of need the butter.  Anyway, that's just my two cents.  Oh yeah, for the chorizo, I used Hot and took it out of the casing and crumbled and browned it.  Also, don't forget the salt and pepper, like I did until I was eating it.  Enjoy!

fantastic! 2 cloves of garlic instead of 4 and 10% cream to cut a little fat were my only changes.Very filling.easily fed 4 with plenty left over.
