FANTASTIC! Made exactly as written except for halving the recipe for a 1# flat iron steak and marinating it all day long. So super moist, tender and just absolutely delicious! The whole family gobbled this up, and hubby's already asking when we can have it again...a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

So delicious!  Was a complete hit!  Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of a little less garlic and no sage only because I didn't have any and still turned out great!  Thanks for this recipe, will definitely be cooking this one again!

I made these for dinner and was very impressed with the results. I didn't have cilantro, so I snipped in some fresh chives. The only other difference in prep from the way the recipe was written is that I used a grill pan on the stove instead of an outdoor grill. The marinade makes it a restaurant-quality entree.

Made almost as directed. marinade seemed a little scant, so couldn't baste while cooking. What we liked about it was that no one flavor stood out, it was just a unique flavor. Will certainly make this again!

This was sooo delicious! One of the best steak marinades I've ever tasted. I rarely try recipes with only one review but I'm glad I did. The kids came back for seconds but it was only one steak left. We all hovered over the one piece while I sliced it four ways. I can't wait to make this again!
