This cookie did not taste good. It is not
a drop cookie, it is pancake batter. It is a waste of beer.
My dog didn't like them either.

I thought these cookies would be great for a company of men that love beer.  I brought them in after tasting them as a joke, and I don't think anyone got the joke.  Now of course they all think that I can't cook.  I will show them of course, but just for the record these are terriable!!! Very bland, strange texture...etc.
Of course my drunk roommate thought they were great, so maybe that is the trick I just don't know.

Fun to experiment with.

I agree with the reviews that the all purpose flour makes the dough too thin.

By happy accident, I'd substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour, since I'd run out of all purpose -- what a difference. I used a microbrew and folded in dried cranberries for more flavor (per another suggestion posted).

This is a savory cookie if the recipe is followed, not sweet. However, I've done a variation where I used the "sweeter" Guinness stout and folded in chocolate chips.

I think using the basic recipe, with 1 1/2 cups all purpose and 1/2 cup wheat flour, along with a beer and a folded confection or dried fruit could make this fun (pick a beer, like Cherry wheat and fold in dried cherries, maybe, etc). Also, for beer drinkers, this cookie is not too sweet (depending on what you add) and is a change from chips, pretzels, etc.

Doesn't look, like the basic all purpose flour, walnuts (and I'm guessing people pickd the macrobrew pilsner lagers as the beer) is all that great.

I made these with my brother's girlfriend, and we did alter the recipe, using 1/2 all-purpose and 1/2 whole wheat flour; we also used a little less beer and added craisins to the mix and pecans to the top of each cookie.  They were awesome, although more the consistency of muffins.  My brother's girlfriend remembered the alterations and made beer muffins later and reported that they turned out better than the cookies.  A suggestion for the beer to use: we used a Sam Adam's seasonal cranberry lambic ale.  I'd also suggest a cherry wheat or other types of wheat beers to give these cookie-muffins a more hearty flavor.

Based on the reviews for these, I didn't have very high hopes for these, but I was curious. I used 1 cup of Newcastle, and I added some raisins and a bit of oats to bulk them up a little. I also added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and a little vanilla, but I guess it wasn't enough to make a difference. These were really easy to make, and I like that they didn't have eggs, white sugar, or an outrageous amount of butter. They are sooooo good hot out of the oven!! I love the texture, its very soft and kind of spongy! I can tell the flavor will be a little bland when they cool, though. Next time I will add some chocolate chips (I think white choc would be great in these) or more raisins, and maybe some chopped walnuts or macadamias. Yum!

Well, I made a slight change in this recipe: I used root beer in place of beer, and only used one cup.  And it turned out pretty good.  The dough was more like a batter, but the cookies still turned out ok.  They were just soft cookies as opposed to the hard ones that people might have expected.  My family liked them anyway.  Thanks for sharing!

The amount of flour in this recipe needs to be adjusted to 3 1/2 cups, at the very least (I would recommend 4 cups flour).  The recipe, as is, does not yeild a usable dough at all... more like a thin, watery batter.

Cookies were soft and chewy, but thought they were missing something. Maybe the addition of raisins or diced apples would perk up the flavor.

Bf liked these.  I added craisins per another reviewer and meant to put in ww flour as well as wheat, but I forgot to do so.  I think they were still a bit bland--needs maybe some nutmeg and that ww flour?  And chocolate chips or white chocolate chips would make it sweeter.  This might even be a cookie that could do well with butterscotch chips, which can be almost sickeningly sweet.  Luckily, the recipe doesn't make too many cookies, so it's easy to experiment.  I didn't measure the beer; just put in enough until it was a moist cookie type dough.  Baked for 13 min in the oven and they were still soft.  They don't spread very much and are a not so sweet, cake like cookie.  Not too bad; may make again since we seem to be the house that ends up with all this beer from parties, and bf and I don't really drink it.  Thanks for the recipe!

you have got to be kidding!!  i did not add all of the beer and it was still to thin.  even adding more flour it was not cookie dough!  i did get it like cake batter and added the nuts in.  once i baked it i topped it with a cream cheese icing.  it was okay, but nothing i ever wish to try again.  maybe i should have had a beer or two first?

I don't really like beer...so they left an aftertaste.  However, my dad LOVED them (he likes beer and can't taste it).  I was thinking about sending the mixture without the beer out as gifts.

This recipe was awesome! I only made one change-- and that was to shorten the baking time, from 12-15 minutes to 8-10. I live at high altitude, though, and my oven is literally older than I am.  These cookies came out soft, tasty, and delicious! Pecans work very well as a substitute nut for those who don't like walnuts.

I added nutmeg and coarsely chopped dark chocolate and was glad I did.  The taste of these probably varies considerably depending on the beer you use.  I used Smithwick's.  I recommend letting the beer settle before you pour it in for accuracy (use a pyrex).  The dough tastes AWFUL but the cookies are good.  Don't be scared.  They are cake-like and soft when they're done.  Mine baked perfectly in 12 minutes.

These were pretty good.  I only used 3/4 cup of beer so that it would be more of a dough consistency.  I also added chocolate chips, which made them much tastier.

Bland.
If you spread icing or Nutella on top of the cookies, they are quite tasty.

These cookies were very good.  Make sure to use relatively cold butter - warm butter makes these cookies flat.  I'm confused by the other reviews - my friends love them.

These cookies are fantastic!! I made them with Sam Adams Winter Lager. I added just under 1 and 1/4 cups, just until the dough was moist. I also added some nutmeg, oats, and chocolate chips. The are fluffy, kind of like muffin tops. So good! I will definitely be making these again. Next time I'm going to try Guinness!

I only gave this recipe one star because half-of-a-star wasn't an option. I made these cookies for my dad for fathers day. What a HUGE mistake! I doubled the recipe to make him lots of cookies and the batter tasted AMAZING!!! If they could make the batter into like an ice cream the guys would go crazy for it.
So I made these. The cooking time was way off. It took almost more than double the time for them to bake, they didn't bake all the way through and when they were done they were extremely flat, had absolutely NO flavor of the beer I had selected and pretty much served the purpose of a paper weight. I have NEVER in my ten years of cooking had so much trouble with a recipe. I will NEVER try this again.

Seriously, the original recipe was a quarter cup of beer. That is why everybody’s cookies are like pancake batter. Please make the correction. Also, if you feel to add a little more beer at a time do so knowing that the batter still must be Doughy

I changed this recipe quite a bit and fooled around as I made it. Here's what i did and they came out pretty good.

1) The beer I used was a Goat peanut butter and chocolate porter. It's really disgusting just drinking it, but we saved it for something like this. Instead of the 1 1/4 c. I only used 2/3 a cup (which was all I had left of the porter. We kept trying to get other family members to drink it, but everyone agreed it was nasty).
2) I added 1/2 cup of Blackstrap Molasses to it along with the brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, 1 c. rolled oats, 1/2 c. of whole wheat flour, 1 tsp extra of the cinnamon, and pecans instead of walnuts.

With those changes, the cookies came out really dark, but they're quite delicious. The salt, however, we found to be absolutely necessary. Without it, the cookies don't really have any strong flavors. But the salt seriously brings out the flavors of the porter.

I read all the reviews and am now baking. I used:
1 cup bread flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 TBS of regular sugar
1 TBS cinnamon
3/4 Cup of butter (more than the recipe)
1/2 an egg
1 1/4 cup of Sierra Nevada Brown Ale
some dried cranberries
some chocolate chips

I mixed it up and then added a a bit more four to get to Toll House cookie texture. I then made Table Spoon size domes on a cookie sheet and started baking at 350ºF at sea level. I am now waiting......
..........at 10 minutes I took them out they grew a bit but did not spread and flatten out. After testing the first batch I cooked the next batch for about the same time 11 minutes. 

I think they turned out okay. A puffy, good, beer cookie.

A good starter recipe for sure, but needed a couple adjustments. Beer choice is probably the most important factor people are having trouble with- this works great with a dark heavy ale, but wont work that well with your average pilsner.

When I was making this, I added an extra half cup of flour and a cup of oats to help with the texture. Also, I substitued white chocolate chips for the walnuts, since I didnt have any on hand. It ended up being a very savory, fluffy cookie. I will make it again for sure!

This was an awesome recipe! My great grandma used to make cake batter cookies when I was little and these totally remind me of them! Great taste, and everyone I have made them for has loved them! I am looking forward to experimenting with different beers and seasonings! Thank you Tina for posting this!
