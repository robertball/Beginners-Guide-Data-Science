The video is very helpful to show how to trim up and butterfly a pork tenderloin.  I didn't use a full 2 tsp of salt in the stuffing, I also didn't have currants so I used chopped dried cherries.  Use a thermometer to test the internal temp - my tenderloin was seared stove top and then was done in 20 minutes in the oven.  One thing I really like about this recipe is that it can be completely assembled in advance and cooked later, which is great if you have making this for company.  (If you plan on doing that - take the meat out of the refrigerator about 45 minutes prior to searing & roasting.)  I served this with mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and apple cranberry sauce. **Note: there are usually two tenderloins in each cryovac package.  If preparing both tenderloins, one is most likely going to be smaller than the other.  Adjust cooking time and test the internal temperature of both roasts.   Pork is done at 145 - you can always pull one and let rest while the other one finishes.

I have made twice and it was a hit both times.  The first time, I adhered to Chef John’s recipe.  The second time, I substituted diced dried cranberries for the currants and added diced portobello mushrooms— wow!  Thanks to Chef John for the recipe.

Great recipe - thank you for the video for a first-timer! We used curly parsley instead of flat and if I use curly parsley again I might not use 1/2 of a bunch - it seemed like a lot putting it in and while the flavor was great, it overpowered in some bites.  My husband also added 3 sprigs of fresh Rosemary from our garden and it overpowered at times, too - 2, as in the recipe, would be perfect.  Used Panko breadcrumbs to make non-dairy - perhaps will add a little more nex time.  Really good and fairly easy, though!

This was really, really good.  Made it with no adjustments to the recipe.  Watch the video and by all means make the Dijon jus to go with this.  Another delicious and easy to prepare main course from Chef John.

Overall, very good and not labor intensive to make. However, it was too salty and a little too peppery for us. I'm one of those l love salt people too. Our pork tenderloin was 1.4 lb and the only adjustments made were: GF Italian Seasoned bread crumbs,  reduced the amt. of salt by 1/2, 1/4 cup dried parsley and 1 tsp dried rosemary (didn't have fresh on hand). Next time, I'll use 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. We liked the texture of the stuffing w/ the pork though. Watch the video and make the Dijon sauce! Tasting the sauce alone, I didn't like it. With the pork and mashed potatoes, delicious! Will try again with a few adjustments.

Flavors did not come together for me.  
Imagine a mouthful of garlic and parsley. Would not make it again.
The Dijon sauce was good

The pork and stuffing were very tasty, but way to salty. I reduced the salt and pepper in the recipe by half and it was still too salty. I found with fresh rosemary, garlic and parsley there is not much need for salt and pepper. I pounded the tenderloin to 1/2 inch, but it was impossible to roll up so I just folded it.  It looked very nice folded with the stuffing sticking out. I needed to cook it longer then the recipe suggested.  Definitely use a thermometer to test for done ness.

Well Chef John, we tried this recipe today and all went well right up to the first bite. Salt Salt and more Salt.
We will make it again without salt

I made the recipe as is and it turnout very good. The only things I will change the next time I make it is I will sauté the garlic before mixing it in for a richer flavor and add more currents. I’m not a fan of the raw garlic taste. Overall, it is a tasty, easy dish to make for a Sunday dinner.

Usually I make most recipes as written the first time,  and take notes to craft for my taste subsequently. The second time, I cut the salt in half.  Also, I found browning  only one side worked better.   Be sure to watch Chef John's video as he has a great technique for wrapping the twine.  They don't teach that in Culinary School.  Thank you Chef John.

This was delicious, but I will definitely decrease the salt next time --which is the only reason I rated it 4/5 stars.  I did not have fresh herbs, so I used 1 tsp of Penzey's Mural of Flavor.

The technique worked very well and I look forward to trying different stuffings.  I used an oven thermometer inserted lengthwise and cooked it to 140 degrees. At that point I removed the tenderloin and after a few minutes the thermometer peaked at 148 degrees.

FROM 4-star first try to 5-STAR —— Easy to make, impressive looking and fuss-free. I replaced the currants with dried chopped cranberries, and they were tasty. For some reason, my pork turned out a little tad dry. I would try to cover it up with foil, or add water to keep it more moist next time.  Very flavorful - even though I only used a sprinkle of salt instead of the 2tsp indicated. Thanks Chef John for your entertaining commentary as well.
—————
2nd time - EVEN BETTER WOW! ————-
We made this again recently, replacing the bread crumbs with minced pork+chopped kale+a little turkey bacon+ricotta cheese.  You don’t need the egg since you have the ricotta cheese to bind everything together. We also asked the butcher for tenderloin with a bit of fat. It turned out most and so delicious!

When I had a couple of tenderloins I didn't know what to do with, I immediately "asked Chef John" :-)   Delicious, my family just loved it.  Too much salt but exactly the right amount of pepper, didn't have currants but I had cranberries, didn't have parsley but I had spinach - the recipe is ridiculously forgiving :-)  Make the dijon sauce too.  So pretty!

Only ingredient I didn't have on hand was currants so I used baby Bella's with extra Rosemary. Stuffing and rolling the meat was a cinch, plus I used elastic string tube (from meat dept at grocery store or can get from a butcher) to hold my roast together. Sadly no photos being family were starvin marvins and devoured the roast and veggies. Taste and flavors were spot on. Will make this again and even consider to toss on the grill!

Tried it for first time--video was great support, helped me when prepping.  Had it for dinner tonight, everyone loved it. I personally don't like garlic too much, so next time I won't use 3 cloves.  I served it with mashed potatoes and fresh green peas. I made a merlot wine-reduced mushroom and shallot gravy and it was perfect accompaniment (I cheated and added  Heinz turkey gravy to thicken it, and it turned out very good!). I will definitely make this again, but for my household use less garlic.

Yummy and flexible. It was great. I had to use raisins instead of currents but that worked fine.
