Really good French Toast. I made some slight changes. I used 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon Rum Extract, only a dash of salt, brown sugar instead of white and also used wheat bread. Will make again!

Made it for Christmas morning. My boyfriend and I both thought it was “interesting”, it wasn’t bad, but probably won’t try this again. I think the rum extract was a little too much. Maybe cut it down to one teaspoon? I made it with wheat bread and it was fine

If it was only me sting this it would get 5 stars. My husband said it was a bit sweet and my son said it is not the regular. What do they know... I added whip cream to top it off and I loved every bite.

Easy and my family loved them. Didn't change anything to the recipe except just added a dash of salt instead of the amount it called for.

I loved this perfectly spiced french toast! My 19 month old liked it too.  I even  used ww bread and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp (1tsp would have ruined it) and brown sugar instead of white. Thanks for sharing your recipe
