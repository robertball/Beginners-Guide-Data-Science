Wow!  Just wow!  This is the best steak I've ever had - and I cooked it.  I actually made this for a family meal, and boy-o-boy did the family feel special.  Drying the stead prior to cooking did help in creating a beautiful crust.  The only thing I did wrong, was I did not use a low-sodium stock, so the bordelais was a bit too salty.

I was a bit worried, seeing all the meat that I was able to trim off the scraps that went into making the sauce.  As it turns out, we ate that too.  This recipe is amazing, the sauce is worth the effort (and the "wasted" meat).  I couldn't believe how tender the meat turned out.  I'll definitely be making this one again. Chef John can do no wrong!

I thought this turned out very good...I loved the sauce...It is very yummy...wish I had doubled it though.  Also, read the entire recipe before making it...It was written a little out of order if you ask me.

Hubs told me again later in the evening again how much he enjoyed this! That's an endorsement as far as I am concerned! I even pan fried the steaks which is a new experience for me since I love to grill (the videos are very helpful). I thought the "crust" on the steak was nice and the inside was perfectly done. As Chef John mentions, use sodium free or homemade broth, if possible, I used reduced sodium and thought it seemed a bit salty. I used half the pan sauce, added more red wine, reduced it in the saut√© pan, added the butter and it was delicious. I would definitely make this again! Thank you!

The sauce part of this recipe is magnificent! Make sure you take the time necessary to Carmelize.The one change I made was the wine. I used Madeira instead of red. If you like it a little on the sweet side, add just a pinch of sugar,

This was excellent! Even my 5 and 10 yr olds LOVED IT. Will be making this again. One bite and I knew it was worth the effort. I used mushrooms instead of the shallots and only cooked the sauce for 40 min. We even ate all the concentrated left over scraps from the sauce it was so good. I had cut out all the fat before cooking it. Followed the videos for this one and it was pretty easy. Thank you!

Made these for Easter dinner; followed instructions to a T" but used filet mignon! OMGEE What an absolutely awesome amazing steak!! Seared to perfection with a nice crust, finished them off in the cast iron skillet. Since they were filet mignons, didn't have scraps for Bordelaise but I topped themw/Bearnaise sauce and served with Broiled Lobster Tails, Baked Potato and Sauteed Garlic Asparagus (recipes on here). Husband RAVED all night! Fantastic...I may never grill or broil another steak again! Dry rub & refrigerate uncovered overnight was the difference! 10 Stars!!

Thanks Chef John for this fabulous recipe!!! My Husband said it tasted as if he was eating at a fancy restaurant!! The steaks were just cooked perfectly; I finished by putting them in the oven for 10 minutes to receive a medium to medium-well done steaks. I used cooking red wine and I didn't have anymore Chicken stock or broth so I 1 used chicken bouillon cube to 1 cup of water (which makes chicken stock) and just used 1/2 cup of cooking wine with 1/2 cup of chicken stock for the sauce.

This was DELICIOUS! My family (of 3) LOVED it. My 7 yr old loved it so much, he wants me to make this for his bday party coming up (not going to happen too many ppl). He enjoyed the sauce, as we all did. Only changes made were that we like our meet well done so I cooked it on both sides double time. Had no chicken broth so I used a chicken knorr cube (bouillon)  & water, Moscato instead of red wine, as well as white onions instead of shallots. EVERYTHING still came out FABULOUS & DELICOUS!!! Wonderful recipe & very versatile. Even with substitutions it was perfect! Will definitely do again! Thanks :)

A client of mine owns a grass fed farm and gave me a bunch of uncut meat for Christmas. I found this recipe looking for what to do with all the filet. I saved the fat from my filet, after I cut it into steaks, and used it plus a lil meat for the sauce (since a NYstrip has more fat)  but other than that I did everything the same. My family of 5 is super grateful for the meat and this awesome recipe that we will be having tomorrow as well!!

Made it with filets instead... Used ground sirloin instead of the NY strip scraps and it came out so good. Can't wait to see NY Strips on sale at the grocery store to make this again

My husband loved this steak, and he orders steak almost everytime we go out to dinner.  Two hours after dinner he came and said it was the best steak I ever made. Followed instructions exactly.  East to make with extraordinary results. A New York strip steak that cuts like butter.  Highly recommend this recipe.

This was the first steak I ever made myself and it is the best steak I've ever had. I ended up undercooking the steaks a little, but they were unbelievably tender and flavorful with the help of the sauce. I probably won't make this again for a long time since we aren't big steak people here, but when I find a good deal on New York strip steaks again this will be my go-to recipe.
