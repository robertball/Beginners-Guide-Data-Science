Didn't make this exact recipe but have been making a similar version for years. I layer tortilla chips in a glass baking dish and top w/ cubed cooked chicken. Then combine the cream of chx heaping tsp of garlic powder and chili powder drained Rotel tomatoes and chopped onion. Spread sauce over chicken and top w/ shredded sharp cheddar. Bake @ 350 for 40 minutes. Scoop out your serving and top with chopped tomato and lettuce. BIG HIT W/ EVERYONE!

This was awesome with a few tweaks. I cut the soup down to one can. Added the sour cream to the mixture. I seasoned my chicken with the chili powder and garlic. Left out the salt. I added chopped onions and green pepper to the chicken while I was sauteeing it. I added a can of mild green chilis to the mixture as well. I did not add the chili powder and garlic to the mix as it was well seasoned as it was. I added a cup of rice as well. After it was baked we added hot sauce to taste to each individual serving. Very good! Thank you!

This is a dish that is suffering from an identity crisis. I think it would be better suited as a dip or add some chicken broth and turn it into a soup. As a casserole it fails. Add the chili seasoning to taste otherwise it will be too spicy. Overall we liked the flavor BUT the tortillas added nothing. This is a pretty ugly dish and would never dream of making it again or serving it to anyone.

This was very good. Hubby thought it was a little dry. He suggested rinsing out the soup can with a little water and adding that to the mix. I think I'd put some sour cream in it OR more canned Tomato w/Chiles as we thought there should be more tomatoes. We did add some extra green chiles -- personal preference. Oh and some more cheese the power of cheeseeeeeeee. Will make again.

This was a good recipe!  My only suggestions would be to spray the pan with cooking spray so the tortillas don't stick and to use the low-fat versions of soup and sour cream!  Other than that, it had a good Mexican taste and it was really easy to make.  I'll end up making it again.

I served the corn chips on the side & mixed everything else together. Despite mixing only 1/2 a teaspoon of chili powder into the dish & omitting the extra chili powder from the topping I thought it was still pretty spicy. It may also have been because I used a can of RO TEL tomatoes & green chile peppers which are a little spicier.

I made a few revisions to ths recipe. I omitted the chili powder as hubby and I don't like alot of spice. I used onion powder and diced tomatoes with onion in it instead of the plain onion. I also added a can of refried beans to mixture. I also used tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas. I put a cup of Mexican shredded cheese in the mix and then melted some on the top when the casserole was almost done. This all came out excellent! Even my picky husband loved it!

Soooo great!  I was so impressed at how tasty this was and how incredibly fast and easy it was to make.  Didn't really alter it much, just added 3/4 more of a can of tomatoes w/ chiles and next time would probably sneak in another layer of corn tortillas.  This is definitely going to be one of our regular dishes!!  :)

After a crazy day at work I needed something quick easy and yummy. I made it in very fast and made some changes based on what I had. I added a can of chili beans used 1 chicken breast omitted mushroom soup used 1/4 c onion and used monterey jack cheese. It was the comfort food I needed and my husband really liked it. It's going to be something I keep items in the house for because it is a great weeknight meal. I should have sauteed the chicken with some peppers to lessen the baking time. Guacamole on top would give it some freshness too.

We didn t like this much at all. It had taste but it was the consistency. Too mushy with the soups. IF I make it again I will add Mexican style corn black beans and omit the soup.

I just made this and nobody liked it. Definetely too much sauce..... perhaps with just a quarter of what it has says would have been fine. I don't think I will even attempt this again. The taste was good but it's just not something I really enjoy eating.

I agree with the "better as a dip" comment. I added chopped bell peppers and crushed red pepper to the chicken. Layered ingredients on top of tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas. Served with sour cream pico de gallo and jalapeno slices.

I did change a few things. Added only half the chili powder. Had only one can diced tomatoes with chiles and one regular. Added three cans cream chicken and one can mild enchilada sauce. Simmer'd on the stove top ( oven quit working) for aprox 25 minutes. Poured over soft taco shells and also made egg noodles and spinach and chive noodles. Hubby and kids loved it! Will make this again.

Wonderful! The people who left out the chili powder must not be from the South! I'm from Texas & like spice. My kids (one of them is picky) went back for more!

This recipe is delicious. I also used layered tortilla chips instead of the tortillas and my whole family loved this. This will definitely be in our recipe box from now on.

Our family has made this for years and years an years! we dip the corn tortillas in the hot chicken broth before layering - more is better on this layer. you can use what you have in similar ingredients - truly a family comfort food. also we serve it a lot as a "dip" with tortilla chips and salsa for football Saturdays.

I made it! It's so good. Instead of soup on too, I mixed it with everything else. A little bit more chili powder but not a lot. Instead of onions (I'm picky) I used corn. I think next time I'll also add black beans

This is a very good and forgiving base recipe for Mexican casserole. It is saucy...but that is what rice and chips are for...right? I also make this using 1 can of soup tortilla chips (I use the slightly stale ones left from an open bag) salsa instead of rotel chopped green chilies taco seasoning I usually saute onions garlic & bell peppers to layer in for nutrition & color...don't reduce the sour cream!Serve with Mexican or plain rice. Even better the next day.
