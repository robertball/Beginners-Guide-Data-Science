I feel like sitting on porch swing talking in a southern accent (badly; I'm not good w/accents) when i sip this!  I subbed Srpite Zero for club soda and used Diet Peach Sweet Tea.  I wanted a big sippin' drink, so I used a bit more of each to fill my quart canning jar "glass".  It's a nice sipping drink that with 2+ shots, packs a bit of a punch.  CHEERS!

To make this without alcohol you can make a peach flavored black tea, use peach skins and mint to infuse the sugar syrup, make or find some peach or peach/mango juice to sub in for the ratios of alcohol!  It will be a truly muddled drink.  But even simply making a peach tea from
