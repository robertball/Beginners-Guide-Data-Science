Nice.  This blend of seasonings really appealed to me.  I loved this actually, but I did do things a little differently.  I didn’t make the whole batch, just eyeballed all the seasonings for a 1 cup recipe of rice using chicken broth (and butter) to cook it and eliminating the bouillon granules.  I kept all else the same. I’ll go back to this repeatedly, any time I need a rice side dish that is flavorful but does not compete with the main dish it’s meant to support.

Yummy.  I cut the number of servings down to 5 to get even measurements and used it to make one dinners-worth of rice (1 cup rice, 2 cups water).

I needed a side dish and ended up having all the ingredients for this recipe. I scaled it down to 4 servings. I didn't have the chicken bouillon granules chicken bouillon granules but had chicken bouillon cubes and used 2 cubes instead. My husband and daughter thought that this was a prepackaged rice and not from scratch, both were impressed. I will buy the chicken bouillon granules and make the full recipe for when I need a quick and easy side dish.

This is everything that I have been looking for in a great rice side dish it was delicious.  I cut the recipe in 4 just to try it and I still have probably enough mix for 2 or 3 batches.  I also used 2 cups of instant rice and 2 cups of water then added a couple Tbsp of butter after it cooked.  But the flavor of the mix was awesome.

came out a little TOO salty for my liking.  Ill make this again, but I suggest using LESS salt/bouillon.

My tough to please family liked this recipe.  My only changes were I  didn't have the chicken bouillon granules so I subbed in low salt chicken stock for the water and ended up adding more salt in the end to compensate and I added a healthy dash of turmeric for color which will also add a little more flavor.  Last, I lightly browned the rice in 2T butter before adding the chicken stock.  Nice color and flavor.  Will use again with the granules.

This was great. I didn't measure exactly how much of each ingredient I used, and I didn't have any almonds, but it made a nice baggie of seasoning that I was able to use on two separate meals. I boiled the seasonings with brown rice and made a nice pilaf. Delicious with fried pork chops!

I was looking for something to add to my rice for a little pizzaz.  This was really easy and good.  My only issue was that it seemed to need a little salt.  Maybe it's because I didn't use the bouillon granules (I cooked the rice in chicken stock instead).

I didn't have granules, I used 3 buillons cubes for the recipe.  I halved the rest of the seasonings because it seemed like a lot.  It was delicious; very flavorful.  My whole family loved it.

i cannot eat nuts, so made without, and had an abundance of old bouillon cubes, so just crushed them. this is my default rice recipe for everything from seafood to beef. i use about 1.5 T mix, and i add a couple T butter when cooking. i often just throw in a frozen bag of veg for an integrated side dish :)

Wasn't a big fan of this one.  It seemed bland.  When printed recipe, the footnote didn't print so I had to guess how much seasoning to use, but thankfully I guessed correctly based on the servings yielded. Definitely needs salt and pepper at least.

I love this seasoning mix. I use low sodium chicken bouillon and it turns out wonderful. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This was pretty good. It did add some flavor to the rice for something different.  I didn't have the almonds on hand so I am sure that would have added more flavor.

This really looked tasty, but to me, it ended up tasting like a ranch dressing packet stirred into rice.  It had a lot of flavor, but just not the flavor I was looking for at all.  Nobody in my family finished their helping.

This was alright; imparted a "nice" flavor to rice. I wouldn't rave about it, and my kids didn't notice enough to make a comment. We eat a lot of plain white rice, so I thought it would be nice to spice it up, and had hopes for this. I'll prb use up the mix, but won't make any more. Thanks anyways. :)
