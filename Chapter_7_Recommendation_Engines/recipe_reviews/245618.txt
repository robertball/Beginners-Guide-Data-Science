Very delicious. I added my bbq sauce and some sea salt to the pulled pork before frying. Turned out great.

These were great! The only thing I would change is to add a shake or two of a Memphis type rub on your pork before adding to the wrapper. It adds a ton of flavor. Also be sure to use a BBQ sauce you are familiar with and one you like. Excellent!
