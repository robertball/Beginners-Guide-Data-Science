For those of you who don't know, here are some cake baking tips.  First of all, flour matters.  Please buy cake flour.  Then, sift.  Don't scoop out a cup and pour into your bowl.  Sift your flour into the measuring cup, then level it off.  Yes, this takes extra time but it's a HUGE difference.  This will give your cake the dense texture you're looking for.  Please also cream the butter with the cake flour and the sugar, then pour in your milk/egg mixture.  Also, please make sure all your cold ingredients are room temperature (about 65F)that's milk, eggs and butter.

Fantastic :) yum yum. I was hesitant to make this cake as everyone said it was "cornmeal-y". What are people doing? It was the best yellow cake I've ever made. I used 4 eggs and sifted the flour and used whole milk instead of buttermilk and it turned out fantastic. Will def. make again.

I haven't tried the recipe, but in my trial and error with cake recipes I can tell where the "cornbread" reference comes from. Using all-purpose flour in a cake recipe, especially nearly 4 cups, can sometimes yield a heavier and more crumbly texture. Try substituting cake flour, but use only 3 cups, sifted. Eliminate the baking powder and add an extra 1/2 t. vanilla. Since you're reducing the cake flour, also reduce the buttermilk to 2 1/4 cups and sugar to 2 cups and see how this turns out.

This is a fabulous cake!  I've made it at least 6 dozen times, and it is easy to make, very moist and delicious.  I don't understand the reviewers who said it tastes like cornbread.  I've never experienced that with this recipe, so I can only assume they've done something wrong.  This recipe is a classic, and is one I depend on when I want something that will impress.

I guess It's my fault for being in a hurry and not reading the preamble but if you pay close attention to the directions the say "Grease A 9x13 Pan" not two!
A in my book means 1. Also it says "Pour Prepared Batter in prepared pan" not pans (plural) I admit I am real new to baking and probably should have guessed from the serving size and large amounts of ingredients that I should have used 2 pans but again I was in a hurry. Waiting to take out of the oven to see just how bad it'll be?

I made this cake for my family, and they absolutely loved it! I was also a little puzzled about the cornbread remarks. I wonder if it is because a lot of people are used to yellow cakes made from box cake mixes? So, what they're commenting on isn't so much the taste, as the texture? Yellow cakes made from scratch don't usually have the fluffy, soft texture that box mixes have.

This cake has a cornbread consistency because of the combination of baking soda and buttermilk. For those who want to try again (or are trying for the first time), use milk instead of buttermilk and all baking powder.

Yum, yum, yum! I am so glad I decided not to go with boxed mix - this recipe blows Betty Crocker out of the water! Tastes fresh and home made, very lush and so incredibly moist. I don't get the cornbread consistency at all - it's very crumbly, buttery and moist (again!) I increased the sugar to 3 1/2 cups to suit my sweet tooth and beat the batter considerably more than just to incorporate flour. I used juice of 1 lemon mixed with only 2 cups of milk instead of buttermilk and baked it considerably longer than stated. Served it with chocolate peanut butter frosting and got only raves. Thanks for the recipe - it's definitely my 'one' yellow cake recipe now!

Worked as advertised...a very good cake.  I substituted sour milk (a tablespoon of lemon juice mixed with each cup of milk) for buttermilk, and it still worked perfectly.

There are two kinds of cake textures, fluffy and light (like a box cake), or dense and heavy (like a pound cake). This cake is one that has a dense texture (if you follow the recipe exactly). I make a lot of cakes and in my experience I have found that cakes using buttermilk and baking SODA has a more dense texture,(cornbread texture, not cornbread taste) and cakes using whole or 2% milk and baking POWDER are more fluffier in texture. May I suggest when making a cake that you keep this in mind. It all comes down to YOU! and your preference of texture.

Excellent cake, however, when I made these as cupcakes they rose more than they should have. (not a pretty picture). The cake itself is lovely, light, fluffy and pleasantly sweet.  I halved the recipe, using 2 eggs rather than the scaled down 1-1/2. I would definitely make this again if it wasn't for the fact that I'm spooked now because of my unfortunate, over-risen outcome.

PLEASE READ.  I read the reviews carefully before deciding to make this cake.  Needless to say i was weirded out by all of the cornbread comments. But knowing that there was not any cornmeal in the ingredients, ignored those comments and carried on. SO, as one reviewer has already stated: THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CAKE. I was not looking for a light and fluffy cake.  I was looking for a moist dense cake and this was it.  NO CORNBREAD HERE.   I followed the directions precisely and was very pleased. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because it is not the best yellow cake ive ever had. I have baked a few cakes in my day and this recipe suited its purpose.  I poured the batter into 2-8" pans and i discarded the rest. i paired it with a chocolate butter cream frosting. SUCCESS

This cake is certainly moist and is plenty sweet. I don't understand the cornbread comments people have made. The flavor is good, but there are a few things wrong with the cake for me to give it a rave review. 

I made this twice now in tests for a wedding cake. Both times, I made it as instructed and still had the following problems:
- the cake was slow to bake (in all sizes I tried) and would get very dark on the outside before being done.
- it had a tendency to sink in in the middle, even if it was completely undisturbed while baking.
- it is not very sturdy, which is very important in a wedding cake. About half of the layers (in my tests, I made 4" and 6" layers, about 10 total) didn't come out of the pan cleanly.

It is a good tasting cake and is very fluffy and uses simple ingredients. It probably would be great for sheet cakes, served out of the pan, but wedding cake needs to be sturdy to withstand transport, the weight of the layers, fillings, frostings and potentially fondant. I think if I were to make the 5 tiered cake I'm looking for a recipe for, it wouldn't make it to the reception site.

If anyone is wondering, the recipe makes about 10 cups of batter.

I love this recipe after trying several. I reduced soda to just 2 tsp and increased powder by 1/2 tsp. It made for a less soda tasting cake. I also found that creaming is the most important in making cakes or cookies.

Use cake flour. I get very annoyed with people who rate recipes without first following them as written. I have made this numerous times using all purpose flour and got rave reviews. I made it last night and decided to try cake flour and it turned out that much better! The texture was a little lighter and tasted like it was purchased from a bakery. I used the quantity of flour listed plus 7 tablespoons extra (per the instructions on that cake flour box). If you only have all purpose flour, I would still highly recommend this recipe.

Made this recipe for my boyfriend, as he is a big fan of yellow cake. I was a little put off by the other reviews calling it cornbread. So I was a little worried how it would come out. But it came out GREAT and my boyfriend loved it! I tried to find cake flour but no grocery store in my area has it. So I followed the recipe exactly, and it was awesome! I used the Hershey perfectly chocolate recipe for the frosting. It went perfect.

I mostly wanted to post this review because I read many reviews before I made this cake, and I am another person frustrated with people reviewing a recipe that they have altered!  So after reading the reviews I concluded that the cornmeal taste was possibly due to under mixing.  Needless to say, my disaster is probably due to over mixing the recipe.  I ended up with inverted cupcakes and a cake that was completely brown and inverted before it was finished, and still didn't really set up like a cake.  A complete throw away disaster.  
I have learned my lesson - make it as the recipe is written!  
Having said that, the flavor of what I do have is still very good, and it is moist.  If I had not over mixed I would probably have a real crowd pleaser!
     Update:  I made this cake again, as directed this time and it turned out great!

i made this cake for the first time yesterday. i made it for a 13 y/o boys birthday party..i used all purpose flour...huge mistake..as the cake cooled, it shrank. i mixed it too long with my elecric mixer...if i had mixed it by hand after i added the eggs i am sure i would have had a different outcome...i am going to make it again with cake flour next time..and i am sure it will be wonderful!! using the all purpose flour, it was way too dense..however it was very moist and not in the least bit "corn bread like". cake flour for any and all cakes is the key!! while i was disapointed, everyone else liked it and that's the big thing. the recipe does make one cake and 12 cupcakes. i used the cupcakes to sample before the party for those that couldn't wait to taste the cake...i gave this 5 stars because it was MY error..for not putting the mixer down..if i had follwed the directions, all would have been well. i will write another review after i use cake flour. baking and cooking is all about trial and error!! nothing more, nothing less!!

I have made this cake 3 times. #1 was to the letter by the recipe and it came out like cornbread.  But then again I didn't sift the flour, and tasted kinda bland, like it needed salt. Made 2 9x13 cakes.   #2 was much better although I still didn't sift the flour in the traditional sense, but the batter was light and fluffy and the cake was fantastic.  Used a bundt pan and made 24 cupcakes from the rest.  #3 was used as a pineapple upside down cake in a 17x11x3 inch pan.  Be careful of the oven temperature and timing.  For this cake I turned down the temp from 350 to 325 and baked it for about 40 min.  Went to take it out and it was very jiggly in the middle.  Turned it back up to 350 for another 25 or so minutes, and this cake was great.  I think this cake took just over an hour to bake with the 17x11x3 pan.  Was an experiment.  I will make this cake until I get it right, so that means a lot of baking.....

First time I made a yellow cake from scratch & this was wonderful. I did substitute the buttermilk for 2 1/4 c 2% milk. This is a very moist cake. My husband says it reminds him of his grandmother's!

This is the best yellow cake I've ever made.  Not much more trouble than using a cake mix and tastes a whole lot better.  I used self rising flour and added just a pinch of salt and this was a lot easier and took away the possibility of being able to taste the baking powder in the cake.

I saw that this cake got 4 stars so I made it without reading the reviews. While it was in the oven I decided to read them. Anyways, I saw that a lot of them said that the cake tasted like corn bread so I became very nervous. But... after it came out of the oven, I tasted it and....it was... DELICIOUS. I cooked it exactly like in the recipe and it was so good. The only thing was that it had to be cooked for an hour not for 35-40 minuted.

Loved this cake I used "cake flour" and the other ingredients, please sift all together.  Make sure butter, milk and eggs are room temp.  This is my new go to cake recipe.

This recipe was fantastic. Very moist and delicious. I had to make some changes to make it wheat and dairy free but overall great recipe.  To make it wheat and dairy free I used Bobs Red Mill Gluten free All Purpose Flour instead of regular flour. I had to add 1.5 teaspoons of Xanthum Gum to the flour mixture (not really sure why but it says it on the flour package). To make the buttermilk I used a little less rice milk with 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Margarine instead of butter. I also used Sugar in the Raw instead of white sugar (just because I try to not use white sugar).  It turned out great! People loved it and no one realized it was wheat free!

Delightfully moist all purpose cake, great with ANY frosting or filling, probably even nice heated, drizzled with syrup and Ice cream. 
 I combined sour cream with milk instead of buttermilk(a great trick my southern mother in law taught me!)and it was divine, don't forget - make sure you use BUTTER not margerine!! This is a foolproof recipe.

This is one of the better yellow cake recipes out there; however, if you are used to the texture of a boxed cake mix and your cake will not all be consumed at one serving, you might want to try the following: use only 1/2 stick butter and 3/4 c canola oil; use 4 eggs instead of 3; use a finer sugar than usual (you can pulse it in a processor and keep on hand for cake baking); and triple sift the flour. Cakes made with oil are almost always more moist than those made with butter. For new 'scratch' bakers, try halving this recipe the first time out. Once you realize how good cakes from scratch are, it's doubtful you'll go back to mixes. I've gotten to where I can hardly stand it in the cake mix aisle, as I can literally smell all those preservatives! Good luck with your baking adventures. Just don't give up. Baking is more of a science than cooking. Ingredient ratios DO make a difference. :-)

I registered just so I could rate this recipe. I made it for my daughter's birthday cake and it was fantastic. I didn't have real butter so used half smart balance and half organic non-hydrogenated shortening. Had only the brownish organic sugar, which worked just fine. Mixer broke so I had to use my hand-held one - with all that and living at high altitude (I cut baking powder and soda both down to 2 tsp for altitude) it still came out really moist and wonderful. The original recipe, FYI, fills a Wilton 11x15 cake pan just perfectly. Was VERY well-received!

This recipe is great.  Thank you.  I was looking for a cake recipe that did not call for cake flour; something I could make with what many of us already have in our cupboards.  I used regular flour and sifted it three times.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used the 1TBLS + 3/4 tsp of vinegar to the 2 1/2C regular milk and let it sit for 10 minutes.  I brought all of my refrigerated ingredients to room temperature.  I made cupcakes for my son's birthday and they were great!  Very moist, good texture.  Tasted better than the box.  It is not as sweet and I actually like that because it's a good treat without tons of sugar for the kids.  If I were to make it again for adults, I would probably do as one baker suggested and add extra sugar.  But, this recipe is great.  Thanks again!

I have mixed feelings about this cake.  It is very, very moist. It gets a wonderful brown crust on the outside.  Inside however, lacks flavor - I just think it needs more sugar and vanilla.  The texture is moist but coarser than a box mix - just as a homemade cake should be. If you like a slightly sweet cake or you plan to use it in a recipe like pineapple upside down cake where the sugar sinks into it a bit this would be a great one to use.   With only icing on top the contrast between very sweet and very bland is too much.   

It also rises a lot or I have very powerful baking powder - so watch how much batter you put into your pans.   I had a pan that usually uses 2 cups of batter and it overflowed all over as did the cupcakes when filled slightly over 1/2 full.

I had been trying all kind of recipes for yellow cakes and the were either too dry or tasted like bread...but this cake was awesome,i sifted it 4 times,all my ingredients were room temperature and in addition to the butter I cream about 3 teaspoons of butter flavored Crisco and 4 eggs instead of 3.This was the best cake I've EVER made from scratch.I made caramel frosting and needless to say the cake is half eaten.

I made this cake last weekend and am about to do it again - it was great.  I scaled it to make 2 8inch (by 3inches) rounds and found there was still enough left over to make one 6inch round (by 3inches).    I torted the 8 inch rounds and had a 4 layer frosted cake (big hit with the kids), and took the 6 inch and soaked it with Kahlua and chocolate/cocoa powdered top (big hit with the adults).  I used cake flour instead of all purpose and Wilton's Cake Release instead of grease/flour combo for preparing the pan (I always use this and it's always perfect).  Also due to the depth of the cake used baking strips around the pans (the one's you wet and wrap around the pan to make it bake evenly).  If you use cake flour, make sure you convert the amount so you have enough (for every 1 cup of all-purpose flour, use 1 cup + 2 Tablespoons of cake flour).

This would have tasted great if I were attempting to make cornbread, but I was not.  I was making a cake for a family function and had to go to the store to get a box mix because I had nothing left to salvage this one.  Will not be making it again.

I liked the flavor of the cake.  I halved the recipe to make just one 9x13 cake; it came out very short.  I'll try it again... next time using the original recipe and see if it is taller that way!  Overall, really a good yellow cake flavor :-)

Very easy to make.  I had everything already in the house except for buttermilk.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I made one 9x13 and the rest were made into cupcakes.  Kind of dense.  Definitely does not taste like cornbread though.  Used this for my daughter's third birthday.  Had to bake the big cake for about 45 minutes.

Fabulous! My only complaint is that this is such a big recipe for me and my small family. But it will be perfect for bake sales and community events. I did just use whole milk instead of buttermilk because this was just a "I feel like making cupcakes at 9 pm" thing and we don't keep buttermilk regularly, and I also just used baking powder in place of the soda. And I made all cupcakes (got LOTS of cupcakes!) I honestly do NOT understand all the people who said it tasted like cornbread; it tastes like cake. If you got something that tastes like anything else or has the texture of anything else, you did something wrong. It's almost as good as my grandma's. ;)

FANTASTIC! I love this recipe, it's a perfect yellow cake. It makes enough for a 4 layer cake (8" round), one 14" round, or 4 dozen cupcakes, approximately. It makes for a mean strawberry shortcake!

I made this cake last night and this morning it is half gone!  We just loved it!  It is moist and has a wonderful flavor!  I scaled the recipe to make 12 servings and made just one 9x13 pan.  This cake will be a long time favorite for us!

I followed another reviewer's advice and creamed the butter in with the flour. I was apparently so pre-occupied with doing this that I completely forgot to add the sugar! Well, two 6 year olds loved it sans sugar. I frosted them with a homemade buttercream recipe from this site 'cept I subbed in Splenda. Later on, I realized I'd forgotten the sugar. So if you want a great sugar free recipe, omit the sugar ... but do frost.

I just wanted to thank you SO much for posting this recipe. This is the fluffiest, most delicious yellow cake recipe I have made! I have been searching for a good yellow cake recipe for EVER! I didn't have buttermilk so I added 1 tsp of vinegar for each cup of milk and it worked perfectly. I also sifted the dry ingredients several times to ensure fluffiness!

This was a fantastic cake. Very moist and NOT corn-mealy.  I was craving a yellow cake and didn't have a package on on hand.  I followed the recipe with 12 servings and it was perfect!! Good bye to packaged cakes!!  Highly recommend this recipe!!

These taste great, if you're looking for corn bread.  I have no idea why, but these cupcakes tasted just like corn bread.  They were tasty, but not what I was going for.

This cake batter is incredibly moist.  So moist, almost didn't hold up.  LOL.  Anyway, I made cupcakes and they came out great.  The only thing I would change is how much sugar is put in, especially if using frosting to decorate. Next time I will try just adding 2 cups of sugar and ommit the other half.  I will make this again.

This cake tasted flavorful, but when halving the recipie be sure to use a smaller size pan or the cake will come out tough. It is definitly not for a thin size cake.

I was looking for banana cake and altered this recipe just a bit. I cut the recipe in half, omitted the baking soda and added a box of instant banana pudding.  It only filled the 9x13 half way up but was to die for.  I topped it with the Fluffy Creamy Frosting (Chocolate).  I will definitely bake this again!

This cake will not be a disappointment.   
It is probably the best yellow cake recipe that I have ever used, very moist and tasty.  It  certainly will be saved in my kitchen to use over and over!

I have made this cake three times and have had rave reviews every time. The last time I made it with whole milk instead of buttermilk and I put a pkg. of strawberry gelatin in the batter and it was the most perfect strawberry cake. I am going to try key lime the next time. This is a fantastic recipe and it will be used over and over again. Thanks

These are in no way shape or form dry, dense or of a "cornbread" texture as some have put it. They are so extremely moist and have a wonderful flavor. I even added a half a package of instant vanilla pudding to the batter for extra moistness and they turned out wonderful. I love this recipe, I'm so glad I finally found one that works for me. Those who ended up with dry cakes must have over-baked by a long shot!

Like another reviewer, I didn't read the reviews until the cake was in the oven.  I was a bit worried after reading so many reviews that it tasted like cornbread.  My worries were over with the first bite.  It was very moist and delicious.  Keep in mind, it is a plain cake...that should be clear from the ingredients, but cornbread it is not.  This cake is great on its own, or as the perfect beginning to something special.  Oh yeah, I had my daughter holding the mixer and I got busy with something else, so she beat it for a while....which really made the batter nice and fluffy.  Thanks for the great staple recipe!

I made this cake recipe last week, and it turned out moist and delicious, just wonderful!  I had to halve the recipe, because I only wanted to make two 9" round layers.  I used 2 eggs and added a little *extra* vanilla (for some kick), and iced it with vanilla buttercream.  It was half gone in only a few days (I did have some help :)  This is now my favourite yellow cake recipe... Thanks, Isaiah!

I have to say this is one of the best yellow cakes I have tasted.  I have been baking for many years from easy recipes to complicated ones calling for many ingredients.  This yellow cake is a great basic standard to keep in your file.  The taste and texture reminds one of old childhood memories when everything was home made.  It truly is very moist.  The first time I made it, I didn't have enough butter in the house.  I substituted the same measurement of vegetable oil.  The results were terrific.  There is absolutely NO comparison to a box mix with their artificial taste.  This cake tastes of fresh ingredients.

This is a geat cake.  Very moist. I recently halved the recipe & made it into two 9 inch layers (used 2 eggs) and frosted with Carolines Chocolate Fudge Frosting.  I do not understand the bad reviews of it being like cornbread, but I have seen that comment on other yellow cake reviews also.  THe only thing I did different was to also beat the batter well after adding the eggs, and then after all the buttermilk was added, I beat the batter for a minute or so (more than the just incorporated as stated in the recipe).  I have made this many times- always great.

I'm not sure what the cornmeal reference is with this recipe. I made this last week as cupcakes, and they were the lightest, softest, most amazing yellow cupcakes I have ever made. Topped with a homemade butter cream frosting, these didn't last long in our house at all! I'm actually making this again tonight as a birthday cake for my daughter.

You can abuse this recipe. 

I changed the buttermilk to reconstituted milk powder and added the juice of half a lemon. 

Beat the mixture, not mix until combined. Cake science says mix cakes 5 minutes and muffins until blended, that could be the crumb problem. 

My daughter wanted half yellow and half chocolate cupcakes for school. I scooped 12 yellow then added 2 squares of melted baking chocolate to the remaining batter. I got 2 more dozen cupcakes for a total of 36. 

I love a recipe that makes more than 24 cupcakes and this is it.

Even after reading the mixed reviews, I decided that I would try these. I thought it was very odd that so many reviewers made a reference to corn bread. To disprove that theory, I worked diligently to follow every step precisely. I made sure my butter, eggs and buttermilk were at room temp. I creamed the butter and sugar until it was creamy and smooth. The oven was preheated and ready to go. I decided to make cupcakes. There was enough batter to make 30 (don't try to fill only 24 cups with this batter, because it does bubble, as some people have mentioned). My seven year old was the first to try out the finished product. He said "They're o.k., but no offense Mom, they taste like corn muffins"....  And he's right!! Somehow, some way, they mutated into a corn bread taste and similar consistency. They are certainly edible and even quite good. The reason I give them one star is because I really wanted a great moist cake, not cornbread (which I could have whipped up much easier and faster).

The best cake yellow cake ever, moist, easy to make and delicious.  I almost ate half of it without the frosting.  Will definitely use again. Batter makes 3 9" layers, when frosted makes a beautiful presentation.  Try Tyler Florence (Food Network) coconut butter cream frosting, if you want just vanilla, use only vanilla flavor, delicious!

No problems with this being like cornmeal, as some of the reviewers had said.  I did find it a bit too sweet, though.  If I use this recipe again I will decrease the sugar to about 2 cups.

Loved it!!!  It was sooo good.  The only thing is, I like my cakes thicker.  I guess I would only use 1 9" X 13" pan for a thicker cake.  That would be the only change I would make.  Thanks for the recipe!

While this cake was just marvelous, I would recommend a few changes. I used 4 eggs instead of 3, and whole milk instead of buttermilk. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful. Iced it with a chocolate frosting. People pounced on it, it didn't even last half a day!

I baked this cake the other day and it was gone by the end of the night. My son is very hard to please and he really enjoyed the cake and kept telling me how good it was tasted like a real cake.. whatever that means.. but I will bake this cake again. I did mixed the ingredients until the batter was smooth an extra 1o-15 mins....The icing I used was the cream cheese icing...

YUMMY!
I halved the recipe, used vanilla vodka instead of extract and didnt use any baking soda (I was out of both) But these really turned out great! I remember taking it out of the oven and it smelt like pancakes and tasted quite horrible, But after an overnight stay in the fridge and some buttercream icing these were so good my family ate them all in about half an hour!
Great recipie - Will definitely make it again (Im thinking about making a mini wedding cake for my parents anniversary this year-This so far is the best one Ive found!)

This Cake is GOOD.  I made it for a friend's birthday and used "Carmel Cream Frosting" on top.  At first when I halved the proportions to make less cake I thought there was something wrong, but it turned out awesome.

This was an excellent cake!  My neighbors loved it as well!  It was very moist, sweet, and I don't even think it needed frosting.  It tasted nothing at all like cornbread, because I followed the suggestions to make it not taste so by substituting milk for buttermilk, and baking powder for baking soda.  I used cake flour, and made sure to sift it well.  The only part that took a long time was creaming the butter and sugar together.  Also, I was disappointed because the cake fell in the middle.  It may be due to my old oven though.   Overall, this was a wonderful cake, and it was pretty easy to make as well!  Thanks Isaiah, for a phenomenal recipe!

Great for cupcakes. Fill them out 2/3 of the way up and bake them for 20 min. I will add almond flavor next time. They have the perfect amount of sweetness and they are so good with chocolate frosting.

I have quite a big dilemma! I just took it out of the oven, and it did not rise at all! Then I realized my mistake! I misread the recipe and put less baking powder then it is written here! Oh, what a big dilemma! I just don't know what to do know! I'm going to frost it with caramel frosting and hope for the best...

The batter seemed too thick so I added about about 2 tablespoons more buttermilk. I also make cupcakes with the batter. I set the servings for 16 and it yielded about 24 cupcakes.

There is another recipe just like this except that it calls for 2-1/2 teaspoons salt and 4 eggs instead of three.  The cake was delicious except it was too salty.  Next time I won't use any salt at all as there is enough with the baking poweder and soda.  Also, with two 9x13 pans it only took 25 minutes of baking time not the recommended 35-40 minutes.  Watch out for this because the layers are not that high and you'll have a dry cake if you bake it too long.  Otherwise, this cake is wonderfully light and delicious.  I've been searching for this cake recipe for years.  All my other butter cake recipes are going into the trash as they are either too dry or too dense.  I truly was amazed at how delicious and light this cake was.  Not sure what others did that had to throw away the cakes or it resembled cornmeal.  I've been baking for a long time and am not sure what they did to get these results.  This recipe is definitely a KEEPER!!

I make cakes for everyone's birthday in my family, and this is the recipe I always use. They all think it is the best cake ever!  I'm not sure why some people say it is like cornmeal, because mine always turns out wonderful!  I sometimes add a tsp of butter flavor, but it is terrific without it!  Great recipe that I've been using for several years now.

I was worried after I sifted all that flour and took care to have room temp. items and made sure to mix the flour with butter first, then liquids, I still ended up with an extremely watery batter. I shrugged my shoulders and ladled it into cupcake pan first, thinking I may as well finish it even if it turns out bad. The cupcakes didn't rise much, but they did rise some and they were delicious! I really don't understand the corn bread responses... It was moist and sweet with no corn taste.

This was excellent and easy!!  I used regular flour, sifted. I used regular milk 2 cups, not 2 1/2 and the butter, eggs and milk at room temperature.  No soda but rather 4 1/2 tsp baking powder.  It did not have a mealy texture at all, but rather a wedding cake texture.  Maybe it came out so good because I creamed the butter and sugar really well.  It's even good without frosting.

This cake was great! I was running low on white sugar so I put 1 cup of brown sugar and the rest white. It is light, airy and so yummy. I made 18 cupcakes and one 9 by 13 pan. The cupcakes only needed 25 minutes and the cake was perfect after 35 minutes. I will be making this cake again for sure!

Well, I accidently over cooked this cake, but it was still moist inside! I did notice a slightly corn bread like texture, but this could be because I let my nephew distract me and didn't hear the timer, so it was well done. But, like I said, still tasty and moist. It's not super sweet, which is great because I'm not a big sweets person.  I also like that it makes so much so you can do specialty cakes, which is what I needed to do.  Instead of two 9 x 13 pans, I did did one 9 x 9 pan and one 11 x 15 so I could chop it up and make my crazy cake for my nephew for his birthday.  I posted a picture of the results.  A great base recipe!!

Nice and moist; better texture than other yellow cakes I've tried.  Not five stars because I felt it needed a bit more flavor; next time I'll add more vanilla or a touch of something else. I picked this recipe because I needed to use up some sour milk (worked fine in place of the buttermilk, but maybe that's why I thought it was short on flavor) and was very pleased.  I always substitute a couple of Tbsp corn starch per cup of all purpose flour in cakes, so that may have made all the difference.

After trying a number of "yellow cake" recipes I think the best standard plain cake is pound cake. It works well with or without frosting & if you have a great recipe, it won't be dry & it will never taste like cornbread.

A lovely recipe, and certainly fulfils its description. The cake was very good and I comprehensively followed the instructions. The recipe does call for alot of butter, but was worth it for the moistness. I made cupcakes that were nice but the icing I made was bad. It is an okay recipe for yellow cake--not absolutely amazing-- still wonderful. I am an amateur baker so this is a good recipe to start out with.

This was a great recipe.  I was a little skeptical because all of the negative ratings yet tried it anyway (with a little deviation of course).  I didn't have buttermilk therefore I used 2 cups milk & 1/2 cup whipping cream to make it a little lighter in texture.  Great flavor, not too sweet & beautiful texture.  Will definitely use this again & again.

Delicious cake! Made it for my mother's birthday this evening, and everyone loved it. No one thought it tasted like cornbread either. I did use 2% milk instead of buttermilk, and added some more vanilla. Also, did a little less flour. Made 2 layers with a raspberry filling, and chocolate frosting. It was just great!

I should have read through all the reviews first because this tasted very much like cornbread.  Very heavy and crumbly.  Would not make again even with cake flour.

This was very nice and fluffy!  I didn't have buttermilk around, so I substituted it with 2% milk.  Despite this major change, it was very tasty!  I didn't even have an egg beater!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Delicious and easy.  I think it's as easy as putting together a boxed mix and since I live in an area where that's not easy or cheap to come by this is now my favorite.  The taste is great and it's moist.

This is a very good recipe.  For those who feel it has a cornbread texture, if you beat it longer in the mixing bowl the texture will become smoother.  I varied the recipe a little by using egg whites, low fat milk, and non-hydrogenated margarine instead of the butter or shortening for a heart healthy cake.

I wish I had read the reviews first. I tasted it and was very upset because it tasted like cornbread. Then I got on and saw some other people had the same problem. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out like cornbread. I will not make this one again.

This was good.  I do like my cake to be more dense (but that is not how everyone likes them).  I think I may know why the other reviewers mentioned corn bread in their reviews... the flavor reminded me of the "corn bread" they serve at Boston Market.

All in all, a good cake, but I will keep looking for a better recipe.

Well, I won't say it tasted horrible or anything, but it didn't taste like yellow cake to me.. More like a muffin or something (not cornbread, although I kind of understand where people got that from).  It IS very light and airy on the inside, kind of crisp on the outside.  All in all, I would definately not make it again.

I hate to say it, but this does taste a bit like cornbread. Not everyone will think that though so I suggest that if you're interested in making this, go for it!

I was very disappointed with this cake. After carefully reading the reviews I decided to make this for a birthday party/baby shower but was not pleased with the taste at all. It did tend to resemble a sweet cornbread. I consider myself a fairly decent baker and used cake flour, made sure my ingredients were all room temp, etc. I ended up doctoring up a boxed cake mix.

I bake and decorate cakes on the side and I LOVE this recipe.  It is deliciously tasty and moist and I have always gotten very good feedback when I have served it.  I used it for a wedding cake with rave reviews.  I use real butter with the recipe and make sure that the butter and sugar are whipped very, very good before proceeding with the recipe.  THANK YOU ISAIAH!!!

I did not think this cake tasted anything like cornbread. I followed the directions exactly and used chocolate icing. I made a 9x13 cake and 12 cupcakes. The cake was very moist and had a great flavor. My family enjoyed it very much. I will make this recipe again.

This cake was moist and delicious and didn't resemble cornbread one bit.  I didn't have buttermilk and used milk with a couple of tablespoons of vinigar.  After I poured the batter in the pan I realized that the recipe didn't call for salt, and the batter seemed like it needed it, but I didn't miss it in the finished cake.  It was great with chocolate frosting.

This cake was very moist, but just not sweet enough in my opinion. In any case the kids liked it with chocolate icing, but not my husband. Needless to say I had tons of leftovers. It is a good cake and like I said very moist, just not the one for my tastes.

This is going to be a good fall-back recipe for yellow cakes for me.  It was about as easy as batter gets, and it came out pretty well.  you may want to tweak the actual recipe... mine came out on the sweet side.

My go to cake! Not too sweet, have used for cake pops, fondant covered, fruit and of course frosted. Not being too sweet you are not overloaded when covering with other sweets. Sturdy enough to hold fondant (see pic) but holds its own flavor. I got the "cornmeal" comments also but yet those same people paid me to make this cake for their celebrations! When I made cake pops with melted chocolate I was told it tasted like ice cream. I make as directed, always use cake flour and still sift that a few times. Great foundation cake- sturdy for heavy coverings but delicate enough for a whipped cream topping. OMG try with cool whip, pineapple and vanilla pudding mixed as a frosting. It is out of this world. One last thing- I do parties for work and have never brought any leftovers.

This is the best cake batter for a person that decorates cakes... It is delicate and moist... I have added lemon or orange zest to the last flour mixture; to the last buttermilk addition I add lemon or orange,  butter and vanilla flavors...this cake is better made with buttermilk in this climate but have subbed with milk and vinegar for buttermilk; it's okay but not the very best product.... Good cake take time with the recipe... White Lilly flour is the most tender flour for cakes in the Southeast for cakes...

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday last night, and it was moist and delicious, just as promised!  I didn't have 2 9x13 pans so I baked it in an 11x15 for about 38 minutes.  This made for a thick, delicious cake.  I topped it with buttercream frosting.  Yum!  This will replace my yellow cake recipe.

I tried this for my cousin's 15th birthday. It tasted like cornbread with frosting. NOT A GOOD COMBINATION!

Awesome recipe!  I decided to use it for cupcakes instead and the cake is light, fluffy, and springs back nicely!  This will be my new favorite cupcake recipe!

I made the cake w/listed ingredients and it was a really moist and delicious cake.  I used all purpose flour and had no problem.  Made a layer cake and cupcakes.  Excellent recipe, it's a keeper.

I have to say is that this recipe is awesome. It rises to the rim of my pan and is very moist. You do not taste the buttermilk at all. Everyone loves it. This one is a keeper.

This was very easy to make and had a great texture not at all like cornbread like some reviews have stated. I used whole milk instead of buttermilk, came out moist and light. Only complaint was not that much flavor. Will make again with orange or lemon flavoring.

I loved the texture of these! I agree that it is important to mix until light and fluffy. I was able to make the 9X13 cake and also closer to 20 cupcakes. These were really light, moist and incredibly tender. I did add vanilla and almond but that is just my personal preference. This recipe is perfect as I cannot tolerate the soy additives in most cake mixes but i love the texture they yield and this recipe delivers. Trying to watch my sugar intake and a little sad I won't make sooner but it is my go to yellow cake recipe.

I thought it was a very good cake and very moist. I messed up the first time because I didnt pay attention to the required cake pan size. So I had a little overflow problem in the oven, lol. But regardless of that this is a good cake recipe to follow. Very easy and tastes even better the next day.

Disastrous!! It is actually  a moist cake and the taste is a ok. But baking it is the messiest experience I've ever had. 20 minutes into the baking time I smelled something burning. I looked in the oven and to my surprise the batter was boiling out of the pan. I continued to bake until the full 35 minute cooking time was up and still the cake wasn't fully cooked. I gave it another ten minutes until the cake was fully cooked. I sufficiently greased and floured the pans. Despite this the cake did not easily come out of the pan and partially collapsed. Really a mess! I followed the recipe closely since this was my first attempt.

Great flavor but definately not 24 servings. Also didn't rise much at all even using cake flour and was pretty dense. Made great cupcakes but a flat cake.

I also didn't read the reviews until after I started baking. I am glad I didn't read it beforehand. I probably wouldn't have made it due to the 'taste like cornbread' comments.  I made cupcakes with this recipe and my husband raved about it. He ate several right out of the oven without the frosting. I too thought it was delicious. I will definately be using this recipe again.  Thanks Isaiah!

Mine tasted like cornbread too!  But, I have an idea why.  For the butter, I was not sure if I should use salted or unsalted butter.  I ended up getting unsalted "to be on the safe side."  I wonder if that is what made the difference.  Does anyone else have an idea about that? The cake was moist enough, tasted good with homemade chocolate frosting.  It was fine.

It does taste like cornbread.  I thought it might be the power of suggestion, but my 9 and 7 year olds (after taking a few bites) said it tasted like cornbread.  Not in a bad way, but it does not taste like a yellow cake.  Maybe it is the combination of all the leavner (5 teaspoons total) and all purpose flour?  It does turn out moist though which is why I gave it 3 stars.

I had to try this for myself because the reviews were so mixed... The texture of this "moist" cake is right on the money. it was exactly what I was looking for... moist. The "Corn Bread" taste that others had mentioned was not was I was looking for but IS definitly what I tasted. BUMMER really. It has a wonderful texture.  My family was disappointed. They didn't even finish their piece. Sad really.

I thought that they tasted a little bit like cornbread, but I have to admit...they are good.  I made it all into cupcakes.  I didn't know how fill to fill them...so for future reference, only fill them with 1/2 cup of the batter.  You should come up with about 40 cupcakes...I believe.  They are delicious!

This cake keeps coming out like cornbread.  If it was cornbread, I'd give it a great review, but because it's supposed to be a cake, no way.  I tried this recipe several times, first with the ingredients exactly as they're written, then I tried it changing the amount of flour, adding extra vanilla, etc., it still came out as cornbread.

Out of all the yellow from scratch cake recipes I have tried this is the best I've come across. It is extremely moist and tastes delicious with chocolate icing! I have also served it with buttercream icing and got rave reviews. I make it as the recipe states and I don't think it tastes anything like cornbread.

I am very confused by the notes with this recipe.  The cake took considerably longer to cook than the recipe stated (almost 1 hour).  I made it in a 9 x 13. I thought it was my oven, but when I tested the oven it was fine.  It does have the consistency of corn bread, but certainly does not taste like it.  I whipped some cream and put coconut on it.  It was fabulous.  Was it suppposed to make the cake and the cupcakes?  If so, it did not.  Thanks for the recipe.

Ok, here's the deal. I am a huge snob about making things (especially desserts) from scratch. I am also pregnant and have been desperately craving Betty Crocker's Super Moist Yellow Cake with my grandmother's chocolate cream cheese frosting. I've tried every yellow cake recipe I can find to avoid being seen with a box cake, and this is one of the best, but my hormones have finally overpowered my snobbery. This recipe makes a moist, tasty cake...but Betty does it better!

I followed the recipe and got a LOT of batter. The cake was very fluffy and not dry at all. It did have a similar taste to sweet cornbread (to me) when it was hot out of the oven, but once it cooled the taste changed. It was easy

This deserves more than 4 stars. You should pick your cake recipe based on the type of cake that you want. If you want a moist yellow cake with rich flavor this is a great cake. It’s my go to cake for birthdays.

That cake was fabulous! I enjoyed the simplicity of using this recipe. I'm making it again this week to share with family. I didn't have to add a thing. It was so moist and delicious. My hat's off to the recipes provider.

I made it exactly according to the recipe but added raspberry and almond extracts instead of vanilla. Along with a little red food coloring to make it pink, it turned out beautifully!

I admittedly cannot give a fair review because I did not follow the recipe exactly - I used half and half instead of buttermilk because it was all I had. This aside - It still came out so good! I made cupcakes, baked at 350 for 20 minutes and they were so moist and yummy!

I made this cake today 9/26/15 and the only changes I made was to use self rising flour instead of plain. I didn't  add any baking powder or baking soda since it's already in the flour. THIS CAKE TURNED OUT SUPER MOIST and IS DELICIOUS. This is my yellow cake recipe from now on.

I am looking for a homemade yellow cake recipe that is moist and uses buttermilk. I just made this cake...as written...and I can see why some people are saying this cake reminds them of "cornbread." The texture is flaky and not as light as I would have liked it to be. I will try another recipe (Yellow Clooney Cake) which calls for cake flour and hope that one is better. I have found the best buttermilk "chocolate" cake (Black Magic Cake) and I am still searching for the best yellow buttermilk cake. I like to test different recipes, and my husband eats the experiments :)I will keep trying.....

It's in the oven! I halved the recipe for one cake and hope it works out well. The batter was light and airy and the batter curdled but I'm hoping it'll do well! I also added a teaspoon of maple syrup since I didn't have a lot of vanilla essence or enough for this recipe. I'm planning on icing this with a homemade caramel frosting recipe I came across but haven't tried it yet. Hoping for the best, wish me luck!

These cupcakes are wonderful.  The people that say they are like cornbread must not be mixing them enough.  I have a Kitchenaid, which I think makes a difference to start with but I decided to follow the steps of the reviewer Mind W who left a review on Jan 7, 2003.  She had a different way of making them and I followed her exactly and they are fluffy and incredibly light!  I would also say, use Baker's Sugar by C & H that is fine and I used unsalted butter too.  So much better than a box.

LOVED IT!  I made it with AP flour.  I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own by adding vinegar to whole milk.  I always brush my cakes with a sugar syrup before I decorate and did the same for this cake.  Got great feedback....everybody loved it.

The texture of the cake was very crumbly, and the flavor lacking. It reminded me more of a cornbread than a cake.

Moist yes, but I would agree that it does have a corn bread texture to it. Bland as well...needs a pinch of salt.

I made this cake (cupcakes) tonight and over cooked it- so I thought.  I was so bummed about the color and heaviness of the cake.  It started out well, the batter tasted amazing.  Thought the batter was a bit to thick and the cooked cake was not fluffy and light but almost as dense as a pound cake.  THey cooked to fast and overcooked. Next time I would prob cut back on the amount of flour and baking powder.  I really loved the buttermilk.  Gave the cake an interested taste.

My husband made these for my son's birthday.  They were the best cupcakes I have ever tasted!!!
UPDATE:  I made them this weekend for a tailgate party, but added coarsely crumbled oreos and folded them through before spooning them into cupcake liners.  I topped them off with a dolap of stabilized whipped cream frosting.
RESULT:  AAAAMMMAAAZZZIIINNNGGG!!!!!!!

This was a really good recipe, however it's a lot more like a sweet bread than a cake. The flavor and texture, as my husband put it, "is more like that of pumpkin bread, but with vanilla instead of pumpkin". We are still enjoying it...just leaving the icing out because the sweetness of the bread stands on its own. Despite this, I would recommend anyone give it a go..and I'll likely be using this recipe again...though I might add some poppy seeds in. :D

I was eager to make this cake for a birthday, but I was also scared because of the bad reviews it got.  I did not want to make "sweetened cornbread", but that is exactly what the cake tasted like.  (EEwww).  To make matters worse, I mad a chocolate buttercream frosting to go with it.  It seemed like I was eating cornbread with chocolate frosting. I know I didn't do anything wrong, I even used some of the tips written in other reviews.

If you like cornbread, this is the cake for you. I personally didn't like it all that much since I have such a sweet tooth and it wasn't very sweet at all. It just didn't satisify my dessert needs! But it was easy to make.

This cake did taste like sweetened cornmeal.  I was very unhappy with the results.  It was moist but had a bad flavor.

This cake is ok.  It is a recipe that works well if you're going to frost the cake with exquisite frosting.
I found this cake to be almost indistinguishable from a cake mix, in both texture and taste.  
And knowing what I know now, I would opt for a cake mix over this recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make, but the finished product tastes very much like sweetened cornbread. Maybe substituting milk for the buttermilk would help the taste?  I probably will not make it again.

I really did not enjoy this recipe!!  My family thought the cake tasted like sweetened cornbread!! My cupcakes only tasted a little better when I put chocolate frosting ON them!!  Also, the batter makes well over 12 cupcakes~!!~  I really did not enjoy this recipe.  Although it was an easy and quick recipe, I did not like the taste!! Maybe with a little alterations (for instance, using milk instead of buttermilk) the cake will taste better!! :( :( :(
