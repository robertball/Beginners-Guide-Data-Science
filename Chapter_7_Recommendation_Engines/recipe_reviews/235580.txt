This was good and very easy. It did stick to the paper liners which made it difficult to eat, so I would probably spray the cups with cooking spray next time.  Also, used fresh broccoli which worked well. Will make again

Great use of leftovers! It also works with Stove Top Stuffing Mix. Could have used a pinch of salt.

I didn’t have broccoli but I had left over corn. Was perfect! Didn’t put the cranberry on top, because I didn’t have any on hand. Like others next time I won’t using the liners. I may make it as a casserole one time. Perfect for leftovers!!

My 8 year old devoured three of these. They are the perfect thing to make with your leftover rotisserie chicken.
