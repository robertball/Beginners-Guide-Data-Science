Loved it!! Used a 13.5‚Äù cast iron skillet. Would recommend adding 1/2 cup chicken broth when putting in the over. Cook for 15, take out and stir and add smidge more broth. Cook for 15, remove. Once chicken is taken out, add a bit of broth in remaining mixture and pop back in oven. Our rice cooked perfectly.

This recipe was a flop. The rice never cooked. We ended up pulling the chicken out of the rice/bean mix and eating it alone. The chicken was moist, juicy and flavorful.  I think the problem was that the cast iron skillet was so full of food and with the chicken on top of everything all did not cook properly. I would like to try again and cook the chicken in a separate casserole dish from the rice and bean mixture. We also added mozzarella cheese on top of the chicken.

Really tasty but recommend a dutch oven. Way too much for a 12" skillet.
