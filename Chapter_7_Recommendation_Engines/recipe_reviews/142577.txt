Hubby and I both thought this recipe was delicious. However, I added a few things based on personal preference. I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before browning them. I also doubled the sauce ingredients because I wanted to serve my chops with rice. Doubling the sauce proved to be a good decision, as the pork chops had an ample amount of liquid to simmer in and turned out very tender. I also added a pinch of ginger and a dash of hot pepper sauce to the sauce. Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe. It will be placed in the permanent file tonight!

Added about a quarter cup of orange juice. Marinated these overnight.I omitted the oils since my pork chops had some fat on them and opted not to trim them. Also put pork chops in the slow cooker for about 4 hours and then sprinkled them with sesame seeds to replace the sesame oil.Chops were so tender you could cut them with your  fork.Served w/jasmine rice and green bean almondine which all went together quite nicely.I plan on making this often, perhaps trading between pork and chicken.Made a healthy flavorful meal.

I did not put any oil in since I wanted to cut out some of the unneccesary calories, and I cooked it with chicken breasts. I also used a bit more marmalade to keep it a bit thicker but the flavors were very nice together. I will definitely keep this sauce combination for future use.

I made this dish as a special date night dinner for my Hubby before we got married. It was wonderful. I am not generaly a pork fan but I loved these chops. I served with japanese style sesame green beans and it was perfect!! Now that we are married we usually enjoy this dish at least once a month.

I didn't change one thing on this recipe. It was fast, easy and delish. I will make this often. I may try pork steak also.

This was very good! I used chicken breasts instead of pork, and it was delish!

I didn't think this recipe had a whole lot of flavor. Maybe I am just not a pork chop kinda guy but just didn't appeal to me.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! My whole family loves this recipe. Would be great with chicken or salmon as well I think.
