It never ceases to amaze me how someone can change a recipe 10 ways to Sunday and then give a rating of 3 or 4 because it just wasn't right.  Wise up, people!  The first time you make the recipe follow it to the letter.  THEN rate it and change it to your liking.  This is an excellent recipe just as it stands.

My family loves spinach this way; on occasion I have added bacon. Try after sauteing the garlic, turning off the heat and putting the spinach in the pan, covered, and let sit for a few minutes and it wilts perfectly without being overcooked.  My kids ate it when they were small and I never had to doctor it or bribe them to eat their spinach; fresh spinach is the only way to go!

I have been making this at home for years, using olive oil instead of canola.  I finish by adding salt and fresh ground pepper to taste, and a splash of balsamic vinagar.  This is a tasty way to get our greens that even my husband loves.

Way to much oil and butter...I don't add the garlic, crushed or sliced, until some of the spinach has wilted down some so that the garlic doesn't burn...Also, add some fresh sliced mushrooms and lots of fresh cracked black pepper..be sure to use a very large frying pan so there is room to keep adding spinach as it starts to saute...Salt shouldn't be added until the very end...Sprinkle some parmesean cheese on top right before serving.

After living in China (but eating this at a Japanese teppanyaki restaurant) we make this frequently, only I just use the chopped garlic from a jar, and we always add soy sauce.  We add a tiny bit of water, put the lid on the wok and steam it for a few minutes.

As it stands I can only rate this 3 stars.  Personally it is too greasy so here are my changes.   Use only 1 tbls. each of butter and oil and add chicken broth to make up for quantities.  Also crush the garlic rather than slicing.  This is much more suited to my taste and also healthier.

Really great recipe.  I added some crumbled bacon and roasted garlic almond accents after it was cooked and the flavor was great.  My husband ate all of it the first night and requested it again the next evening.  Thanks for sharing.

I was afraid this dish was going to need some salt or additional flavor, but it was actually quite nice on its own. I also used jarred garlic and it worked just fine.

Gave this a 4.  I boiled the raw spinach in a pot first.  Saw that on a cooking show once.  That's the key...THEN you can saute it in whatever you desire.  Came out alright.  I used only 1 tbsp of oil (don't like mine too oily, added a dash of lemon juice, and minced garlic (yum!)  But boil the leaves first...trust me it's gonna save this recipe!

This is much lighter and milder than I expected. It can easily take on more flavors, but it's fine by itself.

Delicious! My husband who thought he didn't like spinach loves this. I've subsequently made a few changes: I use a little sesame oil (the dark is even better) along with the oil and butter, and it adds a nice flavor. Also, I add some pan-browned pine nuts and a little sprinkle of parmesan cheese when it's all done. This is so good we served it for Xmas dinner and everyone raved.

This is a pretty basic recipe-I've been making it for years! Here are some tips: DO NOT let the garlic burn-it will be bitter.(If you have the time-I usually don't- use roasted garlic for GREAT flavor!)For a healthy alternative, use Olive Oil instead of canola oil-natural is always! (Ever hear of a "canola plant"?? Of course not!!) 
I love to add cannellini beans to the garlic & oil before adding the spinach. You can also add small pasta (like ditalini). Sometime we use broccoli or/and cauliflower instead. We have variations once a week for our "meatless" meal!

I've done this in the past but used olive oil instead - Awesome.  I think I'm addicted to olive oil LOL This is a great way to serve spinach and like others a dab of soy is de-lish.

This was just like the spinach I had on a recent trip to China.  I will cut back on the garlic next time because everyone said they couldn't really taste it anyway!  Great recipe - thanks.

I didn't really like this.  It was okay, but I wouldn't make it again.  It needed something else.. maybe garlic or more spices?  Also, if you don't have the frozen spinich you can use fresh.  Just use 6 cups to one 10oz.box

This recipe goes over well with my husband, and he isn't a big vegetable eater.  I've made this many times and I usually add fresh tomatoes, any of the small versions. I quarter them and add them to pan when I add the spinach.  This gives it a little bit more flavor.  Also, I don't ever use the extra oil.  All I use is the butter, but even with that you have to be carefull because too much butter can ruin it.  It'll be very greasy.

It was excellent. I always read the reviews on recipes before I make them. I know I should make the recipe the way that it is  written for the first time, but I feel that is what the reviews are for. I did use the amount of butter they called for   but I  did not use the oil, and I did add parmesan cheese and tomatoes at the end of the cooking time.Will be making this one again.

This one just did not wow me or my family.  I made it exactly as in the recipe.  It came out kind of mushy.  We had to drain liquid out of it.  Sorry, but won't be making this one again.

Very good, I did cut back on the butter and oil and I also used EVOO in place of Canola.  Loved it.  Thank you for the recipe.

very good but i did have to make some additions because it was a little to bland...i added grated parmesean cheese and a dash of seasoned salt and pepper.

**The second time i made it i chopped up a cup worth of red onion and 2 sm. red roma tomatoes chopped (add the onion in w/ the garlic and the tomato in for the last minute.  Sprinkled a little cheese on top and it was delicious.

On a whim I decided to make this. I cut back on the oil and butter, added a bit less garlic, some chopped green onion, and used it for a filling in spinach enchiladas. It worked. My family loved it!

I found that this needed something more as many others did so I added half of one of those newfangled lemons which are a combination of a lemon and a mandarin orange. I also added a couple of turns of the sea salt grinder.

Good simple recipe, but too oily for me-at least for the light side dish I was looking for. I think the amount of butter and oil could be reduced by half and be plenty.

Great!  I usually read the reviews before I make a dish and followed a couple of changes.  I didn't use as much butter (the thought of that much better kinda repulsed me) and I added a splash of balsamic vinegar. Perfect!!!

I love this kind of recipe.  You can add bacon, onions, bean sprouts; just all kinds of good things.  You can also use canola oil, because it's good for you.

I like the concept but used half the oil and butter.  I minced my garlic, because that is how I "roll".  Thanks for a great quick new way to have spinach.

I didn't think this was particularly good - better than plain steamed spinach but not as good as I had hoped. I probably won't make this again and will stick to my favourite way to eat fried spinach - mixed with feta, bread crumbs and egg and formed into patties and fried in oil.

The way it is it is reluctently given the one star. It is GREASY, GREASY, GREASY! Perhaps cut the butter and oil to one quarter at least. Totally inedible as it is.

As a spinach lover I was disappointed. If I ever try it again I will add some balsalmic vinigar or even some lemon juice for flavor. We found it to be a wilted oily flavorless side dish and we couldn't eat it. I did follow the directions exactly.

I added real bacon bits, mushrooms, can of chopped olives and some Kikkoman soy sauce. Almost like “Joe’s Special” without the eggs. I thought it was very tasty. Just remember the two bags of spinach really shrink while cooking.……

This was good, but I would modify next time.  I used olive oil instead of canola this time and I only used half of the garlic.  Next time I will half the oil/butter and use 1/4 of the garlic.  It was just too much garlic for my taste.  My husband loved it though.

Excellent, except very oily.  I found that olive oil works better for me, in a lesser quantity... flavors it better and it's better for you anyway.  The garlic was wonderful, even added a bit more.  Have made several times.

FYI: I've had this dish from a wonderful Chinese restaurant by my house, but they don't use spinach; they use the leaves and stems of the peapod plant (I forget the Chinese name). You can buy these veggies at an Asian grocer. They are sturdier than spinach and don't cook down as much.

I halved this recipe since my husband and I were the only ones who would eat spinach!  I made it according to the recipe and it was way too much oil and butter.  Asked hubby how he made it and he said his version he doesn't use oil...his version is great tasting.  Next time I will try it with less butter and no oil.

I really liked this recipe. After the first try I added some cracked pepper, salt & parmesan. Then the next time I added cracked pepper, a couple dashes of soy sauce & parmesan cheese! I love it! Even  my 13 yr old son likes it.

I cut down the oil/butter based on the reviews by others. Also added chopped onions and parmesan cheese. It was a great hit with my husband. I thought it was great--and I usually do not like dishes with spinach as the main ingredient. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe just as it is written the very first time.  The second time, I didn't use the canola oil; I only used the butter.  and I added red pepper and onion salt.  It was GREAT!

This recipe is great because it is so easy, tastes great (and I am not a lover of cooked spinach), and compliments a variety of meals. I would, however, warn about the amount of garlic the recipe calls for. I usually like garlic; however 8 cloves is an enormous amount of garlic for this dish. I used half that and it had a pleasing garlic flavor (not over-powering)

For my first time cooking spinach, I thought this came out ok, just a little too oily for me. Kids and hubby ate it up and there were no leftovers. Next time, I think I'll cut down the oil a little and add a little lemon.

This was super easy and remarkably tasty for so few ingredients!  I used sesame oil instead of the canola oil and added a dash of soy for a little Asian flare.  Perfecto!

Very good side dish.  I did not use butter, only oil and I too added some soy sauce.  Have made this using other veggies besides spinach.  Thanks for sharing.

Based on other reviews, I totally skipped the oil and used the butter only. I sauteed onions along with the garlic and I seasoned it with red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. I do tend to think that the oil would make it way too greasy.

I make this often. I use olive oil, but only 3 tbsp. It's too greasy otherwise.  And just needs salt. It's fast and easy. Even the kids eat it.

I have made this multiple times over the years. It is too much oil/butter for our taste so I use either olive oil or butter/margarine instead of both.

Very good. I also add some red pepper flakes and top it off with feta cheese. Yum, yum. Even kiddos staying over to visit my daughter loved this and what kids like spinach. :) This is a keeper.

Followed the recipe. Sorry, It was oily and bland. Needs something else. Probably will try it again because we love spinach but will try to add some flavor. Perhaps instead of oil. Use a little bacon grease.

Tastes good if you add a little Parmesan cheese when you serve it.

Fantastic! I didn't change a thing. I cooked it a little bit longer just to burn off some of the water. I served it over rice and it was wonderful. This will be a repeat.

My family didn't like the butter very much. When I made this again I used only 2 tbsp of olive oil instead and no butter. My kids no longer like 'plain ole' spinach and actually request it with this way now.

I found that all the measurements for this are off resulting in something that is greasy and too garlicy (is that right, garlicy?) so if I try again, the oil, butter and garlic would be drasticly reduced.

Very easy and good recipe. I have made this as is and I have also made it with some adjustments to my tastes. I agree that cutting back on the oil and butter is a good idea or it can be a little greasy. I sometimes also add diced tomato and parmesan cheese and warm through. Good recipe that pleases the spinach lovers in my family. Thanks

Very yummy and very easy! Watch how much oil you use cause it's easy to overdo it and have greasy spinach.

I made this as directed, except using Olive Oil because I didn't have canola. Unfortunately, I didn't find it to be anything special.
My kids, who normally will eat frozen spinach from a box, called it "slimey" and "goopey" and didn't like it.
I thought it was OK, but have used better cooked spinach recipes before.

I changed the serving size and I found it too be a bit oily and garlicy(sp) My husband loves spinach more than and I and said it was great, so I will take his word at how it should have tasted. It didn't make me want spinach everyday or anything like that.

Hey...funny enough I eat this almost everyday and was surprised to see this here! I would add salted codfish to mine.
