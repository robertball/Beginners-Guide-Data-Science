I made this exact dish 01/01/06....but with King Crab Legs!  It is a good dish, but a fun dish. and I think that those who did not like it, did not (1) know how to serve it, (2) it is NOT a stew!  The name is misleading because there is no gravy to speak of, it is just boiled food in one pot, but very tasty.

It is just an "ole Fashion" crab .... shrimp, boil! with your entire meal in one pot!  I think this recipe had a few mistakes in it.  You should start with the corn on the cob (regardless if it is fresh or frozen) First,  because it takes longer to cook, actually I boiled my corn in a separate pot, and in my main pot I had the bay seasoning boiling.  Then I'd commence to add  the potatoes, and  then the sausage, and in the last 4 minutes I threw in the seafood, and my already cooked corn.

I actually live about 5 minutes from Frogmore, SC and I have to tell you that we all love this stew!! Easy to prepare and feeds many people. Our kids get excited when we serve the stew because they love peeling the shrimp. We also add onions to the stew with the potatoes to give it more flavor....

This recipe is awesome!  I first encountered this at a restaurant in northern Colorado several years ago and have been searching for the recipe ever since.  I have made this stew for parties several times and everyone loves it.  The modifications that I made to the recipe are as follows:  1 can of beer, 1 lemon quartered, lots of red pepper flakes and crab legs.  I always serve this on newspaper and no utensils or plates are allowed, fingers only.  A roll of paper towels is set on the table to use as napkins and it is served with several condiments, cocktail sauce, barbeque sauce and melted butter.  It’s a lot of fun!

One of the best meals I've made. I usually have modifications or suggestions to make, but really I wouldn't deviate from the recipe. I did cut it in half as I was only serving 4 of us. I LOVED the presentation and will do this over and over again. Served it with sour cream, cocktaill sauce and lots of paper towels. I sprinkled Old Bay over it and squeezed a lemon over it after I dumped it on the table, then left the Old Bay out for the guys as they like spicier foods. Beer is an essential side kick for this recipe. Don't hesitate to try this one!

An Update: Made this during a trip to Australia for our New Year's Eve dinner (very hot weather). Couldn't find Andouille sausage down under, so we used reg. spicy sausage, but thick cut it on the diagonal and sauted it ahead in olive oil. Worked great! One thought would be to add some liquid smoke to the saute next time to get that smokey flavor. Yum!

Nice! I cut this recipe as follows to serve four: 3 quarts of water; just under ¼ cup Old Bay; 1+ lb potatoes; 1 lb andouille-style chicken sausage; 4 ears of fresh corn; 1 lb jumbo shrimp. I cooked the corn in advance, in another pot. At the end, I turned off the heat, added the (already cooked/frozen) shrimp and just let it heat through for the last 5 minutes. I had no idea what to expect with so few ingredients – the results were amazing. I had my parents over for dinner & we all LOVED IT. In a nod to tradition, I used newspaper as a tablecloth (but we ate out of bowls and I ate with my fingers). A fun evening!

Shirley, Thanks for letting the rest of the world in on our little secret! I'm a native South Carolinian and have been makung this for special friends and special occasions for 30 years. I prefer to add two large onions and two bottles of beer at the beginning and have been known to throw in a few blue crabs. This is best served outdoors, along with plenty of napkins and adult beverages!

I'm definitely the minority on this one... But I didn't think there was much to this stew. Once drained, it pretty much tasted like I just threw together the potatoes, sausage, corn and shrimp. I didn't find the old bay seasoning to add much to the flavor and therefore didn't find this impressive. Sorry!

In upstate NY we had clam steams, same concept,corn, potatoes,sausage,chicken,clams steamed in baskets..Lived in southern PA and got introduced to Old Bay from MD over the border and same concept again... doesn't matter what you throw in the pot. add the Old Bay, throw in a beer or two, drain throw out in bowls, newspapers and it never fails.  the ones that rated at 1 star are very picky eaters or have no imagination. I am now in NC and have condo on beach and when I go there, first stop, fish shop.. and the pot is boiling.  Use your imagination, what you like, throw in the pot. It will come out good.

Everyone here in Charleston talks about Frogmore Stew and how wonderful it is. I tried it and my family loved it! I've tried this several times and have come up with a little revision. I also add 1 can of Lite Beer to the pot and a couple of Bay Leaves. I even add Crab Legs to the pot for an extra filling meal! The kids go crazy! Just throw down some newspaper and dump the pot on the center of the table (drain first of course). What a presentation!!

I made this for a big family dinner with my relatives from Maryland (who are self proclaimed seafood experts).  Everyone at the party had rave reviews and wanted the recipe.  I made it exactly as written and it makes a TON of food.  With 7 people we only managed to eat about a third of it and we had some guys here that can really put away the seafood. :) Thank you so much for this recipe.  It is wonderful and super easy to make!!  10 ********** Stars!!

We have been cooking this for years!  This is one dish all my picky boys eat.  We always use a bag of seasoning and a healthy dash of loose Old Bay seasoning as well.  You can't put too much seasoning.  We also add lemon juice and onions.  Crab legs or "crawl dads" can also be added.  There is a big problem with this recipe, though, and I was surprised no one else mentioned it.  Add the shrimp (large, uncooked, deveined, with shell) at the end as the recipe suggests, but you have to remove the pot from the heat before adding the shrimp.  Cover the pot after adding the shrimp and let the residual heat cook the shrimp.  It only takes a couple of minutes...even off the heat.  Boiling the shrimp for 5 min. would leave you with RUBBERY, TOUGH shrimp.  Using precooked shrimp is also a bad idea...unless you like tough shrimp!  Trust me...we've been there done that!  When cooking this, always remember...1. Never too much Old Bay, and 2. Don't overcook the shrimp!  The best sausage to use is Hillshire Farm pork smoked sausage!  YUMMY!  Nuthin's better than Southern cookin'.

Just a couple changes...You must add a can of beer to the water while boiling. Also, we add two lemons halfed and squeezed, 4 cloves of garlic and 2 onions quarterd while the water in boiling.  Serve with garlic bread...Amazing

This meal was our Christmas Eve dinner this year since my picky family doesn't like the normal ham or pork roast.  It was easy and delicious and so much fun.  Be sure to get yourself a huge stockpot so you have enough room for all the ingredients.  I used my big one but still ran out of room, and ended up steaming the shrimp separately. The Old Bay seasonings smelled so good.  When all was complete I drained it all then dumped the whole works onto newspaper on top of my decorated-for-christmas dining room table! Then we just dug in from the pile!  I served it with warm buttered crusty bread.   Everyone wants to do it again next year, but I think we'll do it again before then too!  Thanks

Too bad you can't give out 6 stars because this recipe certainly deserves it.  I did find that the potatoes needed more cooking time, so I simply pulled them out prior to adding my shrimp and cut them into 4 pieces to speed cooking time.

This is a favorite. Super easy & fast & everybody loves it. I add halfed lemons and onions to the pot for flavor, and will probably try a beer next time based on other reviews.

I was so excited to make this because the picture looks awesome and I like Southern cuisine.   I scaled it back to serve 6 and followed directions.  I cut each red potato into four sections and perhaps that was too small.  A lot of the potatoes turned to mush.  The presentation was still there, but not too many people went for this.  One person thought the Old Bay was too overpowering.  A couple of people even got nervous of the name, "frogmore."  Perhaps I should have said "shrimp boil?"  I'm really disappointed and won't make this again.  I can't afford to waste 2 lbs of shrimp.

I scaled this recipe down to 10 and it made enough for 4 adults with leftovers for about 2 more servings. Gauge your cooking time for the potatoes depending on their size.  Mine were tiny, so I only boiled them 5 min. before going to the next step and they were perfect.  5 minutes is a long time to boil shrimp. Stir the shrimp into pot, remove the pot from the heat, cover, and the shrimp will be cooked in around 3 minutes, depending on their size.  As soon as the shrimp turn pink and have a slight "c" shape, they're done.  Everyone enjoyed this.

I made this for a family gathering in the Keys.  This is simply amazing.  I used the turkey fryer.  I used 3 gallons of water, 2 beers, a cup of old bay, a whole lemon squeezed and then tossed in the pot, 2 large sweet onions quartered.  It could not have been easier to feed the whole crew (18).  I used 6 lbs of extra large easy peel shrimp, 4 lbs of kielbasa, 3 bags of green giant frozen extra sweet corn on the cob (the 1/2 ears), 4 lbs of quartered red skin potatoes.  Then I made a huge bowl of "Super Al's Cocktail Sauce" using the recipe from this website.  I loaded the pot as listed and used the same cooking times.  Everything turned out perfect.

Don't think of this as tradional stew; this is a Southern take on the traditional seafood bake.  I added 1 can of beer to the water, 2 cloves mashed garlic, a hardy pinch of kosher salt, and the juice of one lemon to the water.  I made the traditional sauce of melted butter with a shot of hot sauce to serve with the stew.  This dish is messing so serve outside, line the table with newspaper, and hand out plenty of napkins.

Try this..spinkle the Old Bay on the stew after draining and put lemon wedges on top.  That way you get extra flavor!

SO easy and SO good! We wanted to make about half so here are the changes I made: 3 qrts of water, 1/2 cup Old Bay, 2 tbsp minced garlic, a couple onion chunks for flavor, 2 lbs red potatoes (we still wanted a lot of potatoes), 1 lb turkey kielbasa, 8 mini ears of corn (it's March & we're in WV so we had to get the frozen, already quartered ears), 2 lbs of shrimp. I followed the timing pretty accurately but the potatoes were pretty well done after about 10 minutes so after that I added the sausage and the corn, cooked for about 5 minutes, then added the shrimp. I let it all simmer for about 10 minutes or so b/c we were waiting on the cornbread to finish. This was very filling, easy cleanup, and pretty inexpensive for as much as it makes! We had dinner for 4 (with 2nd helpings) and leftovers for my husband and I today.

I make Frogmore Stew all the time, it's a family/friend favorite in my house. I use smoked sausage instead of hot links and add 1 stick of butter. I also add more veggies like carrots and sometimes even brussel sprouts. When I drain it I save the broth to use in soups Adds lots of flavor to Cioppino, chicken noodle, and even chicken and dumplings. Oh and if you have a hard time finding Old Bay Seasoning you can use Pappy's Seasoning, Old Bay has a better taste but both work great!

This was delicious!  I halved the recipe but I used an entire can of Old Bay.  And instead of shrimp I used 2 lbs of King crab legs.

Awesome meal in one pot.  I live in Canada, therefore was not able to find Old Bay Seasoning so had to make my own.  I know that it isnt as good as the real thing but I just used: 2 Tbs Black Pepper Corns 2 Tbs Celery Seed 1/2 Tbs Sea Salt 12 Bay Leaves 1 Tsp Mace 2 Tsp Ground Cloves 1 Tsp Cayanne 2 Tsp Ground Cardamom 3 Tsp Paprika 2 Tsp Mustard Seed I put the spice mixture in a food processor and ground it down to a coarse mix, turned out great with the stew!  Looking forward to picking up some Old Bay next time I'm in the USA.

Perfect Frogmore Stew!  I lived in Charleston, SC for 7 years and fell in love with this dish...I had never made it before though, so when I saw this recipe I had to give it a try.  I was making dinner for my future in-laws and decided to try it out on them.  They LOVED it and have asked me to make it again.  I am a novice cook and it was absolutely perfect, so this recipe is simple and delicious.  It will be a standard in my home!

I am from the Charleston area and my family has been eating this stew since I was a child. We call it Low Country Boil. Its fun to cover the table with newspaper and go at it!  We never use spicy sausage, just kielbasa and flavor the water with chicken bouillon. The potatoes are the best part since they soak up all the flavor of the broth, so we usually throw in a few extra. So nice to see familiar recipes from home posted. I am in China now and really miss this dish!

I just fixed this recipe for our son's 20th birthday! I told him to stay out of the kitchen, I was making Frogmore Stew!  It is so easy to make and fun to eat! I threw in a crab boil bag as well as the Old Bay Seasoning to spice it up even more! We LOVE this as a meal...planning to fix on New Year's Eve!

We love this....Have made it for company several times,  and everyone loves it.  The presentation is fun,  I tell everyone to wear their old clothes, something comfortable.   We put all of the food out on newspapers,  and use paper plates.  Clean up is great,  silverware and the pot

OMG!  I cooked this last night for VDay for my sweetie and it was great!  I added a few smashed cloves of garlic and a couple of sweet onions and about half of a dried cayenne pepper.  It was fantastic!!!!  We had it again tonight and it was still yummy.  Will most certainly make again!

The town of St.Helena, SC use to be called Frogmore, SC.  The islanders use to make this dish. Therefore you have the name Frogmore Stew. If you really love this dish you should try the local festivals in the low country.

This was simple yet good. Next time I will use keilbasa instead of the sausage because it made it too spicy for our taste. Nice to have another recipe to use my Old Bay seasoning in. Thanks!

My friend's parents made this for us in highschool and everytime we get together we make it.  It's really a fun meal to make for a crowd and is really great to do at the beach!  One tip...eat it right off the table and if you don't have newspapers then use trashbags...it's better that way!

I used 1 lb of shrimp, 4 ears of corn, 2 lbs of potatoes, 1 lb of sausage, a tablespoon of Zatarain's liquid crab and shrimp boil, and a few shakes of Old Bay since I don't like Old Bay that much.  It came out terrific!  Loved trying something new.

Great tailgate food.  We use this at football games at least twice a season.  We usually use frozen ears of corn that have been cut into thirds to make it easier.  Try to use a pot that has a stariner basket to make it even easier.

this was delicious made exactly to the recipe. even my picky eaters loved it. When draining, I scooped everything out into a huge colander, stirred the broth to be sure the seasoning wasn't all on the bottom and then poured it over the top of the food in the colander, wasting as little spice as possible. Served with cornbread. YUM

2/27/11  Just made this for my family and what a huge success!   This is similar to what a local seafood restaurant serves but my family said mine is even better.  I did add a bottle of beer, two crab legs and half a onion that I had on hand. My daughter requested I make this for her birthday dinner.

I revised this by substituting white button mushrooms, whole, 2 lbs; instead of potaoes, also added 2 cans of whole clams, and added celery, baby carrots, parsley, and a red onion.  With this I was able to feed approx. 14 hungry folks, and boy was it soooo good:)

There are only two of us and my stockpot is only 12qts, so I just used what I had on hand: 1.5 lb shrimp, about 2 lbs potatoes, a pack of bratworst, and 3 ears corn.  I used about 3 quarts of water + 2 cans of beer and threw a vidalia onion cut in half in at the beginning. Since my bf doesn't like a lot of old bay, but we do like things spicy, I used 1 zatarain's crab boil bag and 1/4 cup old bay.  This may be too much spice for some, but it was perfect for us.  Since I was using raw sausage, I browned them on the outside, then cut into thirds and added with the potatoes.  Next time I will probably sub the little frozen corn on the cobs, since it was hard to cut through the corn cobs.

So good!  My fiance is allergic to shrimp so I split it into two pots before adding the shrimp to the second pot.  He said it was amazing with just the sausage as well.  I used half Italian sauage and half hot sausage instead.  Also used more Old Bay (we're displaced Marylanders and can't get enough).  Will make over and over- thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I also make a few revisions.  We always throw in a couple of onions, bay leaves, a few fennel seeds, ground mustard and sea salt to taste. We have also added clams, blue crabs or crab legs to the mixture as well.  Corn and potatoes are sooooooo flavorful - no butter needed!!!!

I made this for my inlaws and it was a huge hit. We were all stuffed to the gills with this wonderful meal. I changed the proportions a bit, using 8 ears of corn and 3 pounds of potatoes. I also didn't peel the potatoes. We will be making this fantastic meal again!

This recipe was awesome! We doubled it and added celery and onions first for more seasoning, along with some crushed red pepper. We had a frogmore stew boil as a end of summer party. It was a big hit! It smelled wonderful while we cooked it and everything tasted perfect together! Thinking of making it for dinner for the 4 of us if only we can find corn on the cob in Ohio in February.

My husband loves this. We have been having this for the last ten years. We call it a shrimp boil, but I like the name Frogmore Stew better! This is great for a large or small party and super easy!

This is a GREAT recipe! I'm a South Carolina girl myself. We made this at the beach 2 weeks ago with Shrimp right off the dock...it just doesn't get any better. You can do what you want with your veggies, but the potatoes NEED to cook longest or they'll be crunchy...ewww. Anyway...I followed the advice for which order to add things...except i waited 10 minutes for frozen corn instead of the recommended 5 and I used WAY more SHRIMP than the recipe calls for. It's pretty flexible, add or subtract any way you like. YUMMY! Make sure you serve with a roll of paper towels!

Excellent dish! This is perfect for leftovers. All week, we've been picking from it. We had the sausage for breakfast. We mashed the potatoes for dinner and added the corn to our salads. The shrimp was great as a snack with cocktail sauce. It was amazingly easy to make and helped me stretch my weekly menu with all of the leftovers!

Really goo and fun to eat! served it for my dad and 2 brothers, gave lots of compliments.
There was some changes: 1. cook the corn in separete boiling water and added to the rest at the last 5 minutes 2. Add 3 large onions cut in quarts, really a must! gives lost of flavor plus the onion itself is delicious.  I added at the begining of the cooking process.  3. used spicy spanish chorizo, wich gave a beatyfull flavor.

Excellent recipe!  Though I had to use my biggest stock pot - this recipe vanished in about 15 minutes or less.  Nothing left.  I have never received soooo many reviews from family and friends about a recipe.  This is a definite keeper.  I made it for Memorial Day and will definitely make it again for the Fourth of July (or anytime!)

This IS a great, easy to make meal which always pleases everyone served.  I also have been making this for over 20 years and also find it more convenient to use the little ears of frozen corn.  Like others say, spread the papers on the table and dive in!  I like the fact that you adjust the Old Bay and crushed pepper to suit your taste.  When I serve this, it is always with a loaf of french bread and butter on the side.

I first had this at a crawfish boil.  They used crawfish instead of shrimp -- so delicious.  The seasoning and the method for this stew are so versatile with whatever seafood you'd want to use.  Great recipe.

We enjoyed this and I'll keep it as a go-to choice  for a  casual company meal that's easy on the cook.  You can cut everything as the water comes to a boil.  I added onion, minced garlic and beer, as others have suggested, and would recommend those additions.  I might add zucchini another time.  I cut the potatoes a little small to save 5 minutes of cooking.  The smoked sausage I happened to have on hand had jalapenos in it, which we liked.

This is such an easy and delicious meal; Love it! I often do not have Old Bay- so I use a weak chicken stock rather than water and begin by boiling a cut up onion, green pepper, some celery, bay leaves, garlic and paprika in it- then continue on with step 2.

Couldn't have been easier.  I even grilled the sausage first, but am not sure it was necessary.  I used too much Old Bay, and it came out a bit salty, but that's my fault.  The flavor was fantastic, and with a touch of cayenne and spicy andouille sausage, there was a satisfying burn as well!!

Great recipe! My friend's grandmother fixes this every time we have a big get together. She would never give me the exact ingredients though - just vague numbers, lol. And living in SC - I had to know! We just cooked this and it turned out very well. The corn was a lil overcooked but nothing salt and butter won't fix ;) Will make many times in the future!

I have been wanting to try a recipe like this for years and decided now was the time, but boy was I disappointed! I followed the recipe only adding in some crab legs. I thought it lacked in flavor and was a big waste of food.

I made this recipe many years ago and it became an instant success. Our family has a tradition of letting our three children decide on a 'special' meal for their birthday. After my youngest daughter first ate this recipe when she was 13, it has been her birthday meal choice for the last 5 years in a row. It’s funny how many names this recipe has; I’ve heard it called Frogmore Stew, Charleston Stew, Beufort Stew, Low Country Boil and now OLD BAY Shrimp Fest. Whatever name you use, it’s still good eatin. The one thing I try to do when cooking this is to not let the shrimp overcook, as this tends to make the shrimp less appetizing by giving it a rubbery texture. The shrimp should remain a pinkish color. With shrimp being the most expensive ingredient in the recipe, why mess it up by letting them cook too long? Don’t be afraid to use other ingredients, I often use Crawfish, but a number of others can be used including clams, crabs and scallops. The recipe is very flexible. Try it, you’ll like it.

We love it - made it with either Old Bay seasoning or a bag of Zatarain's crab boil, and we argue over which is better but both are fabulous! I also started using low fat turkey kielbasa, tastes great and we don't miss the fat or calories. It's so much fun to just throw newspapers down and paper towels - no dishes, no silverware, just fingers! Last time we threw in a bunch of crawdads. Definitely a fun meal that we enjoy making often.

This was awesome! It's a huge meal. I used my leftovers to make cocktail sausages, shrimp cocktail, and potato salad. Boiling everything with Old Bay was really good, and not too spicy. I'll make this again, but I'll definitely invite over more people to eat it!

I halved this recipe for the two of us and have enough for another meal.  Will just add another ear of corn!  I will shell the shrimp first next time and it won't be quite so messy.  Absolutely delicious with all that Old Bay!!

This was great! I had friends over for dinner and everyone loved this. Easy to cook, tasted great, and hardly anything to clean up; esp. with paper plates and plastic forks! Great for an outside barbecue/ picnic type setting, just have plenty of napkins!

My family loved it.  I did make the changes as suggested by other reviewers.  Specifically adding: crab legs, 1 onion, lemon juice, beer, red pepper flakes, Bay leaf, Garlic cloves, Kosher salt (pinch), and chicken bouillon.  Lots of delicious flavor!  And lots of fun to eat. And they loved it served with hot sauce.

We all LOVE this!  Made it for my neice's rehearsal dinner/picnic and it was a big hit.  The seafood and sausage will disappear long before the potatoes and corn when other side dishes are offered, so if there are a few other potato/pasta/veggie offerings it would be best to cut the potatoes and corn by 1/3 to 1/2 to avoid lots of leftovers.  Also, this allows more space for some crab legs, which make a deicious addition. Note to self: use smoked beef sausage and replace part of the water with 2 beers.

Love, love, love this. My husband asks for it every summer. I use kielbasa because we like the flavor, cut the potatoes in half or quaters, depending on size. This way the potatoes go futher and get more of the seasoning in them. The last time I made it I also added king crab legs...awesome!! Love to make this for friends also. Something a little diff than burgers and dogs on the grill. Eat outside on deck..no mess in the house that way. Is just as good reheated too.

We make this about once a month during the summer months... or anytime we are missing the beach.  We use the crab boil in a bag instead of the Old Bay.  I also add 1 lemon quartered.

This is absolutely delicious and fun!  It's a really great summer entertaining dish to serve to friends and family.  I make a few changes.  I use a 1/2 cup of Old Bay per 8 quarts of water.  Any more Old Bay and it gets spicy and overpowering.  As I bring the water to a boil I also add 1 onion, quartered stem to root, some smashed garlic cloves, and 1 lemon, halved with the juice squeezed in and then the lemon halves tossed right in also.  I use turkey kielbasa instead of sausage.  I dish it up on a huge platter with lemon wedges, extra broth on the side, and crusty italian bread.  Wonderful!!!  Always a huge hit!

This was a fun and delicious meal. The paper towls are a must! A little expensive to make, but worth every penny. As others suggested, I added a bottle of beer, one small onion chopped and two cloves of diced garlic. For good health, I added about 1 tsp of ground Turmeric. Enjoy!

OK...I have lived in New Orleans for many years and basically this is a verison of a crawfish broil.. I WAS very good, I did add the corn first like many other readers suggested and I'm glad I did. Great Idea! Now...having had this dish before it was a little on the conservative side in terms of kick! I followed the recipe to the t, just to try it out BUT next time I think I may use zatarans fish broil mix OR louisiana crab broil mix..BUT other than that..Very tasty and SO QUICK! Love it! :)

Great recipe! It's your basic "Low Country Boil" but very tasty. I used a combination of smoked and spicy sausage since my husband and I have different tates but it all turned out really nice.

I made this stew for a party of eight at my home last night!  Everybody raved about it.  I was afraid at first about the cooking times, especially with the pototoes and corn, so I kept checking them for doneness after each step.  Turned out the timings listed were perfect though!  I used Chorizo as my sausage, which tasted fantastic.  I'll definitely make this again.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe!

Used to do this in Savanna Ga. And we called it a Brunswick boil no matter what the name is this is very good. I would use a little more shrimp and a little more Old bay and a few garlic pods.

I had never heard of Frogmore Stew until I ran into this recipes.  One of the best tasting dishes I ever had. I added about a half a head of peeled garlic and one bottle of beer. I served with warm crusty bread and even my kids were looking for leftovers the next day.

Has become our annual Christmas Eve meal!!  We add frozen mini corns and we quarter our red potatoes.  Instead of water, we use a case of cheap beer, and we throw in 4 cups (yes cups) of shelled garlic cloves.  Serve with toasted french bread and smear the oh-so-soft garlic on the bread like it was butter and then sop up the juice with the bread!!

My family & I truly enjoyed this meal!  The only changes I made was to not add any red pepper because my boys don't like spicy foods and I quartered the potatoes.  Don't cut the potatoes!  They about disappeared. My boys have asked for this to be a repeat meal... just cut back on the spice mom.  I guess I'll just use less Old Bay.  Great meal, Thanks Bunches!

This was really good.  I added some chuncks of onion with the corn and also added boneless chicken thigh.  For the sausage I used two, keilbasa and linguisa (portugese sausage) and a whole lemon cut into thick slices.  When I served i also served with honey mustard, bbq sauce and cocktail sauce for dipping.  Kids loved it.  Great for cook out party.  I will make this again and again.

This is the best recipe I have tried out thus far on allrecipes.com.  The seafood and sausage and potatoes and corn...fantastic dish!  It would cost a fortune to order this at our local restaurant...I believe it is $59 per person for this bucket feast.  I absolutely loved this recipe and it is very versatile...I added more crab and shrimp to this dish.  I also didn't have Old Bay, so I substituted it with 1/3 cup of a mix of seasonings I had on hand: garlic powder, black pepper, salt, taco seasoning, creole seasoning, chili powder, and also 1 bay leaf...came out fantastic.  I would recommend this to all seafood lovers.

Wonderful recipe! I made it for Fathers Day and we all loved it. I was a little worried about the corn becoming tough from all of the salty seasoning, but it came out just fine- not tough at all. The hot sausage turned out to be a little too spicy for some of us, so I plan to use regular smoked sausage next time, or maby a mixture of both. All in all this is a super easy and satisfying recipe for a gathering!

This is a good recipe I have always cooked it, but didn't know what it was called. Instead of old bay I use swampfire seasoning. I also add blue crabs to my recipe.

This is a great recipe! I first had it in beaufort SC, but I prefer it made with kielbasa instead of the hot sausage links.

My husband was very skeptical of this recipe.  He's not a man to try new things and kept avoiding it, by getting Taco Bell and the such, but I told him that I wanted to try it and I made it and he knows the rules, you have to try it before you say that you don't like it. (The rule was made for my son.) AND HE LOVED IT!  It is going to be a regular at my house now.  I cut the recipe by half though.  12 servings is just too much for my house.  Excellent!!!

My husband and I were invited to a friend's home for dinner one night. This was served. I could not remember the name. After reading a book about Myrtle Beach ~ Frogmore Stew was mentioned. I was so EXCITED to find this recipe. It is absolutely great. My boys loved it too! This is now going to be on the dinner menu in my home often. Thank you for sharing!

Great outdoor recipe.  By accident I found out that adding some of the seasoning to the unpeeled shrimp and letting it marinate for a few hours before cooking will give the shrimp much more flavor.

Great recipe.  I happened to have all the ingredients on hand and made it for a quick weekday supper.  The whole family loved it, and there were no leftovers.  The flavor of the sweet corn in the Old Bay Seasoning was terrific.

I had never heard of this until I moved to Charleston and a friend in Moncks Corner made it for me during a summer cookout. I would prefer more seasoning, but it's the easiest most unique yummy meals I have ever eaten! It is most certainly a dish that I am going to carry with us when my husband and I move on to our next base and share it with new friends!

Delicious...I made just a few changes based on other reviews and personal taste.  I added an onion, chopped celery, one clove of garlic, and 2 bay leaves to the boiling water.  I used a polish keilbasa, as my kids do not like spicy food.  Used half a beer while cooking.  The corn was the absolute best!  Will make again.

We make this on our deck in the summer using our turkey fryer equipment. Our proportions of ingredients are a little different based on what my family likes. We cook "heavy" on the shrimp and "light" on the sausage. We are also heavy on the red potatoes and cook less corn. I add quartered onions and big hunks of carrots to the pot first - along with the Old Bay and a few extra bay leaves - for additional flavor as well as for my one daughter that loves cooked carrots. When done I turn it all out into my large turkey roasting pan and just sit it in the center of the table and let everyone have at it. A little butter and cocktail sauce is all you need.

Yes, you can provide a side or bread with this but I usually don't as its a complete meal in itself. All you need with this is DESSERT!

The best things in life are the simple ones and this is simply delicious.  Really, it's hard to mess this up.  I like to brown my sausage in the pot just a bit first to render out the fat (don't pour the fat out).  Like somebody else mentioned it is tasty to cut up a lemon in it and toss in a couple of bay leaves but if you don't have them make it exactly like the recipe says, it's great.  I scale it down to feed the three of us.

I've made this recipe several times now and you just can't screw anything up! I love that I can add items and it only gets better. I do add less potatoes, and corn because I eat more shrimp and sausage. I just need to get a bigger pot now!

hubby made this last night and it was one of the best recipes we've gotten here. he cut the recipe in half since there was only three of us. also, he used kielbasa instead of the hot smoked sausage since our seven year old can't handle anything too spicy. it was soooooooo good! we will be adding this to our menu binder....it's a keeper!!

This was the most tasty colaboration of food my family has eaten. I thought it was crazy that the recipe called for unpeeled shrimp. Thinking it was an error I purchased unpeeled shrimp. Sitting at the table, picking up the pieces of corn made me realize that this meal wasn't a fork and knife dinner it was a fork, finger, family fun dinner!! Next time I will be using unpeeled shrimp.

I did a test run with this recipe on my husband, I added crab legs, lemon and used turkey sausage. The leftovers where gone the next day! I can't wait to make this for a crowd. Easy to make too.

Been cooking and eating this for years, although in this part of SC, we call it Rooster Stew.  I've always used Zatarin's Crab Boil bag, but be careful not to bust it!  And to save time, I omit the potatoes and serve mashed potatoes (with cajun seasoning and cheddar cheese) on the side.  This is a must for summer cookouts!

Wonderful, easy-to-fix meal!  Made it for Father's Day and everyone loved it!  Had a very busy weekend and had to host Father's Day at our house for 8 adults and 2 kids.  This was not only delicious, it was really easy to make, especially since I was short on time.  Will definitely make it again and again.  My only problem is I need a bigger stockpot!  Thanks for the recipe!
UPDATE: 6/17/12  This has become my annual Father's Day meal!  Last few years, had a bunch over (usually about 10-12), this year it was just me, my husband, my father-in-law and stepmom-in-law, so I scaled down a bit and again, it was AWESOME!!!  Just love this recipe!   I always serve it with cole slaw.  SOOOOO easy and soooo GOOD!!  Thank you again for this recipe!!

Good, SIMPLE recipe! Just the right amount of heat for any guy or gal. I HIGHLY recommend throwing in the corn at the same time as the potatoes as the cobs will just come out better and fully cooked. Otherwise this recipe's instructions are perfect and I will make this over and over.

I've made a lot of recipes from this site and this the THE BEST ONE YET!!!!  I'm from Maryland so I did add quite a bit more Old Bay and used kielbasa w/ red pepper (as suggested by Shirley, the submitter) instead of the sausage (it was in the freezer).  My kids **LOVED** the free-for-all concept of eating (I just dumped the food in the middle of the newspaper covered table).  For a super special treat, I didn't even put silverware or plates on the table.  After years of trying to instill manners in them, they were in their natural element tonight.  My 9, 7, and 5 year old cave-children.  Will DEFINITELY make this again.

Love Love Love this recipe! What I like most is that its soo versitile. You can add and remove and still have something wonderful. I am bad with measuring...most times I eyeball my seasoning or season to tate. I like to add more old bay than called for as well as a bag of crab boil. I also add crab legs and little neck clams to the mix. I serve it with a garlic hot sauce butter mixture for dipping.

I have this all the time when the weather is hot. I cook it in beer with garlic, onion, and whole peppercorns in addition to the Old Bay seasoning. I like to add crabs as well. After draining, I put everything in a huge serving platter in the center of a paper covered table and serve with a butter and hot sauce combination. Wash everything down with ice cold beer and serve fresh fruit for dessert. It doesn't get any better...

Made this recipe for a group of friends - it was delicious!  The kitchen smelled wonderful.  Added one bottle of Honey Brown beer to water and some frozen crab legs with the shrimp.  Next time, I would add a couple of bay leaves to the water, too.

This was a great recipe.  I cooked it on Mother's day when we had family over.  There was only a few potatoes left. I will make mashed potatoes out of them.  Wish there was more left over, I would be eating it for lunch today! My daughter (1 year) loved this too, it ain't too spicy for little ones!  Dig IN!!

My boyfriend made this for me for Valentines day... and boy was it DELICIOUS! I am a VERY picky eater, so he really needed to find the perfect recipe, and he really did. I was most impressed with how delicious the shrimp came out, but that's not to say that the rest wasn't just as scrumptious.

I'm from a little town outside of Savannah, Georgia.  This recipe is a traditional Savannah favorite. We call it "Low Country Boil". It was started a long time ago. When people would show up to church, there would be a big pot of water boiling outside. Everyone would bring a food (crab legs, potatoes, carrots, onions, etc.) to put into the pot. By the time church was over, the food was ready. This tradition has been modified into a recipe. Everyone seems to have their own twist on it. My family likes to add slices of onions and jalapenos.

Living in South Mississippi and having fresh seafood available I'm alway looking for good recipes and with this one, I found it!! We love plenty of seasoning in, what we call low-country dishes, so I thought I would have a difficult time finding a good shrimp-boil recipe. With trepidation, I tried this one and was just blown away!! We used an outside cooker (also do a fried turkey in it), invited lots of friends and had a ball!! The food was soooo good! Everybody enjoyed it and so we have done this dish several times! Amazing how many "friends" you have when they find out we're doing this dish!! Thanks for a really great recipe.

This recipe is the best.  And so easy!  I love it.  By the way, fresh corn on the cob only takes 10 min. to boil, frozen takes 7 min., so the order that you put these in the pot is absolutely correct. What I like the best is that you can change up the seasoning blend you use to give it different flavors.  This is a 5 star recipe!

My family loved this recipe.  I made it for a dinner party and there were no leftovers.  I'm not that fond of shrimp, but everything else still makes a meal.  

It's also easy to adapt the recipe for just 2 or 3 people.  I just cooked the amount of potatoes, corn, sausage and shrimp I knew by family would eat and cut the amount of Bay seasoning down to a little more than 1/8 of a cup.  For a real kick, substitute Emeril's Bayou Blast for some of the Bay Seasoning, sparingly if you don't like a lot of heat.

I'm from North Florida and this is a VERY COMMON dish at home. We often add whole eggs to the stew as well; some people even add gizzards. Most people refer to this dish as a "crab pot" or "crab boil".

This is great for my family - a little something for everyone (including the member on the no-carb South Beach diet and the family "picky eater" that everyone has!). Used kielbasa instead of hot sausage - perfect!

In just one word!  YUMMY...I added red crushed pepper flakes (alot) to really spice up the water and kick up the potatos a notch...other than that, nothing needs to be changed.  Love it, and so did my guest.  They found it amusing eating off old newspaper and picking up food with their hands.

I enjoyed this recipe very much. This summer I added a twist (or two). Right after I added the shrimp I added fresh asparagus and frozen artichoke hearts. Surprisingly, the kids gobbled it up!

This recipe was extremely easy to make and was  very good tasting.  I wasn't sure when I read the ingredients, but thought would give it a try if someone had been using it for 20 years!  Even the little kids ate it.  We enjoyed it very much.  The only thing I did different was brown the sausage before adding.  I'm not sure really why I thought I should, but for some reason I did.  I will make this again.  I cut the recipe in half and it still made a big pot full.  Thanks for a great new taste!

We really enjoyed this.  I scaled it down to four servings and added some crab legs and it was amazing and in fact, we each ate two servings.  Added some beer and some bay leaves as suggested, otherwise made exactly as directed and served with butter for dipping.  I also served with some wonderful crusty bread and we completely forgot about the bread until we were already stuffed to the gills--it is unnecessary!  Thanks for the great and unique (to the Pac NW at least) recipe.

I changed the receipt a little because of the ingredients that I had on hand.  I use corn off the cob from my garden.  I added onions and a tablespoon of butter.  I got rave reviews from a tough crowd to feed.

Great recipe! Delicious! As some others have said, adding beer while it is cooking improves the flavor.

Really great!
Added 1t crushed red pepper and wasn't too spicy.
Will probably add a few garlic cloves next time...maybe andouille sausage...maybe onions...maybe mushrooms.

We have been making this for years and have always included Cabbage, Carrots, and we used the crab boil in a bag I believe it is made by Zaterains.  It is really yummy.  We always fix up the potatoes as we would baked potatoes and Butter, season salt and garlic on the corn.  That isn't the healthiest but it sure is wonderful.

Really simple and flavourful.  I made the mistake of using frozen corn instead of corn on the cob, so the corn kind of got lost amid the larger chunks of goodness. Lesson learned.

In Georgia this is a "low country boil". A wonderful chance to invite friends for a hot and delicious pot of flavors. Add some onions and throw a few crab legs in to add to the fun.

This reminded me of our weekend crawfish boils only on a smaller scale. We thoroughly enjoyed it. The second time around though we used a shrimp/crawfish boil seasoning. It added just enough spice to it for extra enjoyment.

We made this for the 4th of July and it was a hit!  We added crab legs, lobster tails and mussels for personal taste preferences, but the concept is accommodating for any seafood.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was great. I added a LOT of cayenne pepper, we like spicy food and I also served it with some broth as more of a soup, not as much fun as eating it off newspaper but I liked the taste of the broth. I also added in green onions, red onions, and I cooked the corn and potatoes first, came out perfectly.

Totally Tasty! I cut down the recipe to serve my husband, me and our 5 year old boy. Everyone loved it! 5 year old thought sausage was too spicy - but we expected that - he gobbled up everything else - and thought it was an awesome dinner cuz he could use his hands!   Mu hubby and I also agreed it was very tasty - just like the shrimp boils my dad does on special occassions!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a real winner.  It's open to any ingredients you want to choose to explore or meet your own tastes.  I have also added eggs so that they boil the last 5-10 minutes.  The shells have pores and let in the spices.  You can also keep the stock-if it's not too spicy-and serve it all over rice in bowls.  Then offer a throw and comfy pillows for guests to relax and maybe even doze before heading home.  Yeaaahhh!!!

I made this for a Birthday BBQ! Instead of smoked sausage, I used Italian cause it was on sale and we had a lot of guests.  This came out fantastic, the only problem was because I used the sauage, I had to adjust the cooking time so the potoates got mushy..but that was cooks error, not the recipe!  We cooked this outside in the turkey fryer, cooking and cleanup was so easy! I will be using this recipe again!!

Very good. We also add Dungeness crab legs to to the mix to put it over the top. With the crab, this gets rave reviews from everyone that I have ever served it to. Excellent with Andouille sausage. YUM YUM YUM

I made this for a crowd a couple of years ago and my friends still talk about it. I also added 2 or 3 onions cut into wedges. It rivals a crab feast with steamed blue crabs - and that's saying something in Maryland!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I live in South Carolina wher ethis is a low-country favorite and I have been dying to try it at home. I did and it turned out great. I did add one can of beer in with the water at the begining and ALOT of Old Bay Seasoning... also one whole onion quatered in as well. I also did this with 1 pound of steamed mussels added in with the shrimp. DELICIOUS!!! So versatile and so good!!

I got married this past June and we had Frogmore Stew at our reception with parsley potatos in butter, as well as roasted chicken! It was amazing! All the guests were coming back for more, and it was totally a surprise as people around our town have the norm-mashed potatos, salad, a meat, and cake! Love love this recipe!!!

I cut the sizing down to 4 servings and it still made a lot of food! Great meal all in one pot! Next time I'll use larger shrimp, as the large sized ones shrank and were hard to find. We had with Vicki's Hush Puppies-from this site- and had an excellent down home meal! I'll use this one again! Would be great for large party!!

Wonderful! Quick! Easy clean up! Amazing! Will definitely make again. I added crab claws and used crab boil instead of Old Bay. My husband and children loved it.

Very good and fun way to have finger foods. I used 3 types of sauce: butter, cocktail sauce, and a sweet chili sauce with wasabi. So good I ate it at midnight.

Definitely 5 stars!!  I added the corn much earlier that the recipe said to because I think corn needs much longer to cook.  (I put it in about 10 minues into the boiling process).  I would also like to warn people not to overcook the shrimp!  It may cook much more quickly than 5 minutes, and if you aren't careful, you'll end up with tough rubbery shrimp.  Yuck!  We ate this the traditional way--poured out onto the table (usually covered with newspapers) served with butter and eaten with bare hands!  It had a great flavor and was lots of fun!  And the only dish to wash was the pot we boiled it in!

I rate this recipe 5 stars because i live in the southern coastal town of Beaufort SC and this is how this recipe should be done.  It is one of my Faves.  I have also had a cajun style with crawdads instead of shrimp and a few extra spices.

I waited for months to try this recipe and I wish I hadn't now! It is SO good, simple and fun. Husband was hesitant at first but I loved everything about eating with your hands only. Great leftovers too--sausage & shrimp were amazing as leftovers.

Wow.  Fast, easy and delicious. I took the advice of other readers and added one beer, a cup of unpeeled garlic cloves and quartered an onion.  We loved this meal (I reduced to serve 4) and I know it will become a regular one at our house.  Thanks!

I must say...reading the recipe I couldn't figure out why it would be so tasty since it was only boiled for like 30 minutes.  Despite the funny and confused looks on my husband and children's faces when I literally dumped it on the table, they went to town on this meal. My daughter gave it 5 stars and so do I. Everyone just loved it. The only change I made was a bottle of Fat tire beer, onion and I put two heads of peeled garlic in like another reviewer suggested. Excellent. This will definitely be a favorite of our family!

I'm from Charleston, SC, and this version of Frogmore Stew tastes exactly like the ones I ate in restaurants. I used frozen miniature corn on the cob. I added sliced onion. I never knew that this dish was so easy to prepare.

This is the same basic recipe we use for crawfish too - although with crawfish it is best to soak them in HOT salt water first for about 10 minutes!

I hate to be the one to say that this is overrated because I wanted this to be a five star due to how fun it was to make and looked good.  I thought it was ok, my BF thought it was not worth making again and my 12 yrs old said she loved the kilbasa I used.

Try it, you're gonna love it!  We really like the flavor of Old Bay and usually double the amount shown in the recipe.  After adding the shrimp set king crab legs on the top of everything (don't mix in or the meat will get mushy) and cook until hot.....that'll keep 'em coming back!

WONDERFUL!!!  The corn has a slight spicy flavor, potatoes were a little overdone, will remove them before the shrimp are added next time.  This is our favorite way to cook shrimp now!

We didn't have a big enough pot so we used 2 pots; one with zatarans and the other with Old Bay.  We used more than what was called for on the Old Bay and we liked this batch better.  Everyone loved this. Thanks

I was looking for something different to make for dinner and came upon this recipe. I tried it last night and not only was it totally delicious, it was fun to make! I can't believe so much flavor could come from this but it sure is good. I cut the recipe in half and added some carrots with the potatoes but otherwise did everything as the recipe says. I'm going to make this on our annual men's campout, it will disappear.

Very, very good!  I used Zatarain's crab boil because I don't much like Old Bay, and scaled down to 3 servings for my daughter and me.  I could've fed 3 lumberjacks with all the food this recipe produced!  I know it's a seafood recipe, but we liked the sausage, corn & potatoes so much, the next day all that was left was shrimp!  I used large, 36-40 count shrimp that didn't "disappear" among  all the other goodies in this dish! I love to try new recipes, and rarely cook anything twice...but this one will definitely be cooked again!

We had smoked some sausage in our smoker and I used this and it gave a nice smokey taste.  I only wish I could give this recipe 10 stars-thats how good it was.  No changes-it can't be improved upon!  Thanks for a great  recipe!

What a great party recipe.  20 of our friends shared the ingredients and we served the stew on newspapers at tables outside by the fire pit.  It was delicious and such a success.  French bread was served with the "stew".

Fantastic recipe! I substituted the andouille or smoked sausage with bratwurst and it certainly added it's own personality. Two thumbs WAY up for the incredible dish!

This was an excellent recipe and fairly foolproof!  I added onions with the potatoes as others suggested.  Seasoning was perfect.  Served it at the beach and, as is traditionally done, put newspapers on the table and dumped it in the middle for all to serve themselves.  Everyone loved it and it could not have been easier to prepare.  Perfect for beach and special occasions!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I love this!  I didn't have the Old Bay spice so I looked up knock off recipes and improvised.  I am obsessed with the spice so I also sprinkled it all over potatoes, corn, shrimp, and sausage after I laid everything out in the table.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a fantastic end of summer recipe for when the corn really starts pouring in.  It creates drama and fun when you serve it caveman style on newspaper, although I used inside out grocery store paper bags to avoid newsprint.  I served this at my Labor Day party and although we were all adults, be assured the serving style would be loved by kids.  

I prepared the recipe as described, plus one tip from another...I added a generous tablespoon of Red Pepper Flakes and I took the pot off the heat when I added the shrimp to avoid overcooking.  My shrimp were frozen and they were cooked in 2/3 minutes all the same.

My tips: We boiled the water using the "rocket launch pad" which is a the propane burner that we use for frying a turkey.  USE OUTSIDE AWAY from house, most important thing to know if you are a first timer.  

Pay close attention to the timing for each item.

DO NOT CUT the potatoes in half.  I cut half of the taters in half and they turned to mush but the whole ones were perfect at the time indicated.  If you do cut them in half, put them in later.

Cutting the corn in fourths is worth it, the pieces are manageable and match the size of the other ingredients.

Smoked sausage..was yummy but I have also made this dish with kielbasa.  The sausage/kielbasa tends to be very popular, so I would cut 1" pieces instead of 2" or throw in an extra rope.

And before you bring out the butter, cocktail sauce or whatever, TASTE IT FIRST...it's unbelievable -the Old Bay is enough!

I used this recipe to celebrate my brother-in-laws retirement at a beach house rental with the family. Sausage, shrimp, potatoes and corn were on Dave's most liked food list. This recipe not only satisfied his preference for our celebratory dinner but allowed me a simple one pot easy to serve dish. It was better than Great! Fun with food at the table (even Sammy our 2 1/2 yr old liked it) now a summer staple. Added a bottle of beer and a quartered onion cause neither ever hurts. Took others advice and added shrimp once off the heat. Thanks.

This was excellent. I made this for Father's Day because both my dad and husband love shrimp. Winner, Winner. So easy, and the shrimp came out just right, juicy and delicious. I made Tartar and Cocktail sauce and everyone loved the Tartar with their potatoes. I put the sausage in first , then the potatoes, then corn and at the last, turned the heat off and put in the shrimp, covered and let sit for 10 minutes. Drained and put it all on a huge platter. Excellent!!!

The kids always love this one!  I start with the potatoes and corn, then add the sausage for 5 minutes.  I turn off the stove, add the shrimp for a few minutes as they cook pretty quickly.  I serve it in bowl, crusty sourdough bread and old bay, sour cream and cocktail sauce on the side.  Use the bread to soak up the broth - so good!  Enjoy!

I've been making this for yrs. I lay out a ton of newspaper on table & just pour it all down middle of the table. Use your hands to eat! Or place toothpicks out for ppl. Along with some spray butter, salt & pepper. People are always impressed with presentation

This recipe is the perfect camping recipe; even when we do it at home, my kids love it.  Throwing it all out on the table is just kind of an added bonus.  They love all the food included, they're totally okay with the spicy version, and I'm totally okay with the ease of it.  Where we live, shrimp is not the cheapest thing but other than planning budgetwise, I make this whenever I can.

I had this in SC and it was delicious.  My friend just made it for a party but didn't add any seasoning, plain kielbasa (not hot) and no hot pepper.  Very bland.  I will try this recipe.

Great dinner that was really fun.  It was just like a crawfish boil but way easier to eat and more filling/satisfying to be peeling shrimp instead of crawfish.  We did follow someone's advice to cook corn seperately and started it when we did potatoes, so the corn came out really nice and spicy!  Definitely will be doing this again!

I used Tony Chachere's (forgive the spelling, I'm too lazy to check it right now). The corn kicked our butts. No kidding. Everything else was perfect, the corn however allmost killed all of us but a random few who claimed they didn't notice because they liked hot stuff. Next time I'll cook corn separately and then throw in at the last second.

We loved it as is. Will definitely have this again. No butter or oil so if you go with turkey sausage it is a great healthy dinner.

This stuff is great! Ive been eating it for a few years now. my husband talked me into having it at our wedding. Great idea. There was plenty for everyone, and since it was an outdoor wedding we did it country style-on old newspaper on top of picnic tables-crazy I know, But the best time ever!

We made this recipe and were thrilled with the results. Our family loved it, as we had eaten it before, we already knew we loved it but this recipe is the best...we added a few extras and didn't have a bite left, it was so good!

I used to waitress at a local Seafood restaurant and this was my favorite dish on the menu! This recipe tastes exactly like the restaurant version - I love it and I love how easy it is to prepare!  Thanks so much for sharing!

WOW! Made this tonight and just finished it! Wife and kids want this again tommorrow night.Went exactly by recipe,only added 1 bottle of beer.I was unable to find "Old Bay" at our local grocer,so I bought a small bag of "Zatarain Crab Boil" powder. Very easy and delicious.Next time will add crab legs etc.

This is very tasty! my potatoes didnt cook all the way through, so I had to put them back in the pot for an additional 30 min. Next time, i think im going to omit the sausage just to cut out some of the sodium content. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is Awesome! We used a turkey fryer to cook ours, not in oil of course, but with water, it allows much more room, and substituted the shrimp for crab legs. We love this recipe!

I love this recipe and serve it to my students each year. We drain it and serve it by dumping it all on the covered table and eating with our hands. I've known this as Buford Stew - the kids LOVE it, and it introduces some new foods to many of them.

Who needs the Crab Pot restaurant when you can make it at home so easily?  We enjoyed this as a New Year's Eve dinner with tremendous results.  Added fresh caught Lobster legs & tails to the mix.  Serve with crusty french bread, cold beer and lots of napkins.  EXCELLENT!

This recipe is easy, quick and fantastic for large groups. I added red pepper to up the spiciness and I think next time I will try the crab boil some other reviewers have mentioned. I also added 1 pound of muscles, two heads of garlic, and a large white onion to the mix.

This is great. When scaling for 3 servings, use the water/Old Bay conversion for 9 servings to have enough liquid to properly cover the goods

This is a louisiana regular, usually we use a stronger crawfish boil to season with. Although I must admit I have never heard of frogmore stew?!?  Although I did add ingredients that we would normally add, I thought the old bay seasoning actually had a good flavor.  I added a hint of zatarain's shrimp and crab boil(to make it much spicier), two halved lime(no lemons at home) and some lemon juice, salt, and halved onions.  I would say this was a pretty good recipe all on its own, even though I changed it to suit our tastes, most people would find the flavors just fine.

Being from Utah I don't each much southern food so I prefer a milder sausage.  I used a beef link sausage and it tasted great.  I loved this recipe.  Quick, easy, and so flavorful!

Easy recipe that tastes like it tooks hours!  Love it and would make it again.  I made it for only four people so I just didn't put as much shrimp and sausage.  I still used the same amount of seasoning and water. Did I say I loved it!

Made it this weekend, threw it out on a table outside and let my husband and 2.5 year old have at it.  I usually have to drag compliments out of my husband for meals I have prepared, but his immediate response to the FM stew was "put it in the rotation."

I first saw this being praised by Anthony Bourdain.
I made it last year, for a christmas party in my home. Very eclectic mix of people & this went down a storm. Living in Scotland I was unable to find Old Bay but looked up the ingredients & made my own...not sure if it tasted the same but what a dish. I like the idea of using newspapers & just fingers. I will adapt teh recipe for the 2nd Test between England & New Zealand this saturday & see how it goes down at breakfast time (kick off is 8.30am local time). Yummy

This was very good.  My wife loved it.  It wasn't quite as spicy as I thought it would be so I passed around Tobasco to let everyone adjust it to their own tastes.

A tradition on family beach trips for over 30 years. More of a method than a recipe but it's FUN! I use Zatarain's crab boil, garlic, lemon, onions, new potatoes, corn, shrimp, crab legs and sausage. Cocktail sauce (hot /horseradish), drawn butter & crusty baguettes. No dishes to clean up other than sauce & butter containers!

This was interesting, but good! I left out the shrimp, as I don't care for seafood, and with corn being out of season, I had to use frozen cobs. I also threw in some chopped onion. I'll make this again, thank you!

I tried this last night because I have never had it (I'm from the Pacific NW and I think this is mostly an East Coast dish) and it always looks delicious is those Pottery Barn and LL Bean catalogs ;).  I followed the recipe exactly, although I did scale down the portions, and found it to be very tasty.  My husband wasn't as impressed, but that's probably because it did not contain any cream of mushroom soup.  My only complaint is that the ingredients were pretty spendy (I spent about $25), once I had bought shrimp and sausage, but I guess if I had waited until things were on sale, that would have been lessened slightly.  Tasty recipe and something I have always wanted to try.  I may never make it again (because of the price and DH), but I definitely enjoyed it!  Everything was cooked perfectly and was very good.

This was delicious!! We had 3 families for our Labor day cookout and it was so fun. Everyone contributed a couple of ingredients making it kind of like a potluck. We did add some halved onions to the pot also. We also used regular smoked sausage & Kielbasa & added a few shakes of red pepper flakes. Ate it on the picnic table with newspaper and the kids thought that was sooo cool & fun. Can't wait to make again.

Quick, easy and delicious! Everyone loved it - I actually made it for some last minute houseguests on Easter Sunday. We live near the beach, so it was perfect for a casual outdoor Sunday dinner. We even covered the table with newspaper and everyone just dove in! It was the most simple and easy meal to prepare, cook and clean up after! I've got to make this when the kids come to visit - they're gonna love it!

Easy and good.  Especially for last minute company, since it takes minutes to prepare, and you can't mess it up.
Old Bay is found near the seafood counter at most grocery stores. French bread and drinks, and you have a meal.

This was surprisingly good for as easy as it should have been. (I found that my pot was too small when adding the corn, so I had to transfer everything to a larger pot.  After bringing everything up to boiling a second time, I managed to overcook the potatoes.)  I made this recipe for 2 people, and I need to re-do the proportions because 3 ears of corn was just too much, and we had 1/2 of it, along with about 25 per-cent of the shrimp, left over.  I used kielbasa sausage and added 1/2 Tbs. of crushed red pepper and a bay leaf to my 1-1/2 quarts of water.  I nuked, drained, and then blotted extra grease out of the sausage pieces before adding them to the stew. (I was hoping to serve some of the cooking liquid with the stew--such was not the case as the juice was SO hot that it had to be pitched.)  Also added 2 small home-grown leeks and a few tiny carrots to the stew.  Good recipe, but it needs some work to make 2 servings in the pot I had originally chosen!!  P.S. I guess we are southerners from the WEST--we used bowls instead of newspapers!!!

I haven't tried this one, but it's very similar to the Old Bay Shrimp Fest on this website - which everyone goes crazy over when I have it, nice all in one meal - all in one pot w/ your meat, potatoes and veggies.  I add king crab legs to the end.

I wanted to try somthing different and this was a big hit with my family.  I added a couple bay leaves and only cooked the shrimp 3 minutes as suggested by another reviewer.  My DH wants to have this again when we have company.  Even my 9 year old loved it. Thanks

Excellent recipe, just too much corn.  When I make again I will add less corn and more sausage and potatoes.  Family loved the newspapers and paper plates.  When I get the portions right I will serve to guests.

My husband and I enjoyed this easy recipe a lot. 
We peeled the shrimp, quartered the potatoes and used loose sausage that I pulled apart in small pieces before adding to the pot. I also added a bay leaf and some chopped white onion. The cooking times are spot on at a medium boil.
Definitely a keeper, especially if you like Old Bay as much as we do.

Just made this dish tonight.... and it was so delicious... I used kielbasa,  next time I'll try it with smoked sausage,  just to see which tastes better. It was a hit with everyone at the dinner table. Just follow the directions,  easy to make,  and easy to clean up.  5??'s

5 stars. I  had never heard of this dish until recently and im surprised by how amazing four ingredients and one seasoning could taste, my daughter does NOT like spicy food but she was crying for me to stay out of the food so she could eat and get her some drink

This was my first attempt at cooking. The end result turned out pretty good. I added cayenne pepper and went heavier on the old bay seasoning. I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great dish for those informal gatherings when the cook does not want to be trapped in the kitchen.  You can adjust the ingredients any way you want, increase or decrease the number of servings and just "throw it together".  Good ingredients do not need a "fancy" recipe to taste wonderful!

Made this for my first time, Delicious! Does anyone think that you could put this say in a large roaster oven and take with you to a family gathering and just let folks dish it out of the slow cooker keeping it warm? Also, if any is left, can you save your boiled water with seasonings put it back in the pot to re-heat for another meal?

I make this at our camp in California every summer and for my husbands birthday in the winter. My version includes both shrimp and crab. I also add lemons and onions for extra flavor. Yummy!

Oh. My. Goodness. I never rate recipes but feel I have to on this one. Amazing! I added a little more water, the recommended bottle of beer, and I used 2 lbs of peeled, uncooked shrimp because that's what was in the bag. When adding the shrimp, I just stirred them in until they were pink - 2 min at most. Everyone loved it and I can't wait to make it again.

This was so yum and actually really easy! I put the corn in five minutes before the sausage as suggested by a previous reviewer and at the end (after draining) put a large pat of butter, minced garlic in and sprinkled some old bay on top. I would like to know how to get some of the sauce to saturate better. Maybe don't drain as much? We will be doing this again!!

This is a great, easy dish.  My whole family enjoys it.  I often use frozen shrimp, and adjust seasoning based on who is eating.  We like it with cornbread.

I've always thought this sounded like a fun idea--yes--I know it's not a "stew". Sorta like knowing New Orleans BBQ shrimp is not "BBQ", lol! I sized this down to four servings, but used 1/4 cup of Old Bay, along with a quartered onion, several cloves of smashed garlic, and a bag of shrimp/crab boil. I even added a bottle of beer, per another recipe, for a total of 4 quarts liquid. I cook fresh shrimp all the time, since we can get wonderful wild Texas gulf shrimp easily, and we like to try recipes from different parts of the country. Maybe we're just accustomed to more assertive flavors, but I was expecting a lot more from this. I used red hot link sausages, which are pretty spicy as well. But the flavor was just not there. The potatoes were bland, corn was like it was boiled in plain water, and the shrimp were good, but just normal boiled shrimp. Next time I'll just boil shrimp in a couple of bags of crab boil and be done. Maybe a crowd of people and cold adult beverages are needed to put this recipe over the top.  Should've just drank the beer!

Very good. Agree with all others. If your looking at this recipe, it a MUST try and a KEEPER, you will agree. I did add King Crab legs and some crushed garlic and small ears of frozen sweet corn on cob. Very good. Empty pot after day 2!

This is a recipe close to our hearts.  We travel to Fripp Island SC every year for our family vacation and always go to The Steamer.  This is one of their signature dishes.  It is very good, even for people who don't think that they like seafood!  Great taste and pretty simple to make!

Excellent recipe!  Because of other reviewers saying the flavor was bland, I added an onion cut into wedges as well as some extra Old Bay and some salt.  I don't think it needed the extra salt, though, so I'll leave it out next time.  I do agree, though, that the corn needs to be added to the water first, then the other ingredients.  The kids loved getting to eat straight off the newspaper with their hands.  We will definitely be having this again.

Excellent.  Perfect and easy party food.  I cut down some on the Old Bay and added some Cajun spice, extra sausage and Shrimp.  Have lots of cold beer, friends and family and a breeze off the river and life is good.

This was really good.  It was a unique combination.  Very easy to make.  I added carrots along with the potatoes and onion with the corn.  Both of my boys (9 & 3) tried it and ate a variety of pieces.  Hubby said he'd like it again, so this is another keeper!

This was great.  Served it to 9 people and everyone loved it.  I added a lot of salt and also a small jar of liquid seasoning, 2 whole onions and garlic to water.  I'm glad I cooked it outside though as it's messy to handle.  Would make again.

Excellent!  Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great!  I will probably use a little less water next time - and might add a few extra items but I will be making this again!

I'm giving this a 5 because my daughter loved it, but my husband and I found it a bit bland, which I believe is our fault because we could not find Old Bay seasoning in our local store here in Canada.  I googled the recipe for Old Bay and came up with 1Tbsp celery seed, 1Tbsp peppercorns, 6 bay leaves, 1/2 tsp cardamom, 1/2 tsp mustard seed, 4 whole cloves, 1 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp mace which I ground together in the food processor.  I'm not sure how accurate the recipe is but I would love to get my hands on the real thing so if anyone knows where to by Old Bay in Western Canada please post.

excellent!~ I could only find regular kielbasa so I added the hot red pepper to the water as suggested! Served with the piilsbury french bread that you bake yourself with melted butter! Yum! Great for a crowd.

This was good, but I didn't know what to expect since we're from the meat & potato part of the country.  Next time I make this I won't use a strainer pot so the juices/flavors will mix better.

I made a few adjustments, I cook my sausage w oil and seasoning in a cast iron skillet before putting it in. This is a big flavor boost imo. Onions are great to quarter and throw in as well. Sub some chicken stock for part of the water. This is a fun meal especially dumping on newspaper and everyone sitting down and enjoying together w dirty fingers. Making it again tonight with New Years Eve crew.

Followed directions of recipe, including cook times and we loved it! We’re adding this to our menu for summer get-togethers and to our winter menu for a change of pace.
Just a few changes I made:
I used the larger red potatoes, removed the ‘eyes’, washed them and quartered them, leaving the skins on which helps keep them from becoming mushy. 
Used regular, non-spicy keibasa
Used medium sized shrimp.

Delicious!  This was a special dinner for a special night with our kids and it was a hit!  I do warn others to be careful with the Old Bay if your kids don’t like spices. The potatoes really soaked it up and they were spicy!

I made this for my brother's birthday party for 10 people. Everyone loved it. No one had eaten it before and was very impressed by it. From reviews I read, with the Old Bay, I added garlic, onion, chicken broth, a couple bay leaves, butter, and salt.

So good, made it in the instant pot.  Cooked the veggies, spice and sausage for 4 minutes, quick release.  Added the raw shrimp and stirred.  Raw, peeled shrimp cooked in no time and was tender perfect!  Surprised, didn't need butter or anything.  Definitely will make again.

I made this for a family Crab Boil and it was a hit!  I've made this recipe before and it was delicious.  So, I still followed the recipe to a tee.  It was easy to follow and it tasted amazing.  My three grandsons (6, 7, and 7) thoroughly enjoyed it and even rated it a 10! The other family members were equally impressed. Thanks so much for an easy recipe that was able to bring the whole family together on a rainy Saturday afternoon.

Instead of the Old Bay, I used a package of the Zatarain's seafood boil mix in a bag.  Otherwise I followed other suggestions of throwing in a quartered onion, a lemon, some garlic cloves, baby carrots and substituting beer for some of the water.  I adjusted the recipe for 6 servings which gave us a lot of corn and we would have preferred more sausage.  Flavor was good - quite a bit spicy!  Everything cooked up beautifully - cooked the potatoes for about 10 minutes, added corn and carrots for 5 minutes, then sausage for 5 and finally shrimp and removed from heat.  Very good but I will try with just the Old Bay  next time.

Made this out of a crave.  Had shrimp, needed sausage. I used russets cause that what I had. Frozen shrimp we're a bit small, next time I'll use large in shell. Great flavor though, hit the spot.

Everyone loved it.  I had to divide these proportion into 3 batches since I only had a 12 quart pot.  It was perfect though because as people showed up, there was always a fresh hot batch ready to be eaten.  Like others did, I added lemon, onions, garlic and beer (2 cans per 6oz water) to the water.  I also added mussels in 5 minutes after the corn, then added the shrimp.  It was mmmmm mmmmm delish.

I just made this tonight and it was amazing. The only thing I did differently was add two cans of Coors light, a large quartered & squeezed lemon, a half a stick of butter, and a pound and 1/2 of snow crab clusters. Get your sauces out for everyone to dip in, such as Louisiana Fish Fry products Remoulade dressing as well as their cocktail sauce to dip the shrimp, along with a mix of sour cream & one of those lipton onion dry mix packets mixed together,  just to dip the potatoes in. Freakin' YUM!

I didn't have shrimp in mine.  The seasoning just didn't go will with the smoked sausage.  Be sure to use a very large pot.

Very good!. Cooked the corn longer than the recipe calls for and it was still a little crunchy. Did not put sausage in this time. May add sausage another time! Added about 1/2 half of a yellow onion

This was RIDICULOUSLY good and easy. I overlooked the "large stock pot" notation both times I read the recipe through; luckily, seeing the six quarts of water ingredient, I halved the recipe.

The only subs I made were to cut things into one-inch lengths and subbed one pound of raw medium hot Italian sausage in addition to a pound of kielbasa because I had it on hand; I added a bit of cayenne to make up the anticipated difference in heat. I figured since the mixture would be boiling away for a while, I would throw it in with the potatoes step and since the whole thing is drained at the end, it gets rid of the grease. Win-win.

When it was time to add the shrimp, there was no room left in the pot, so I transferred some of the liquid into a sauce pan and did the shrimp separately. I then used a slotted spoon to move the shrimp into the large pot again (since there was room due to the reduction of the amount of fluid in the pot).

The only criticism, if you can call it that, is that I felt the shrimp added nothing to the recipe. Since that may have been because of the method I had to use, no deduction there.

My new, MUCH larger stock pot arrives today. I will be making this again and again and again. The next time, I am going to double the potatoes and eliminate the shrimp. In fact, there's a lot of room to experiment with different textures and flavors.

The most incredible surprise was the corn-on-the-cob. Unbelievable flavor; so much so, that I will add Old Bay to the water

This rocks! I've made similar recipes before that lacked flavor. I made some changes. I Halfed this recipie but still used 1/2 c Old Bay. I used regular smoked sausage, so for extra flavor I replaced 1/3 of water with beer (one 32 ounce can) added a lemon, lime, onion, celery and two large cloves of smashed garlic. I changed the order and added my corn before my sausage so it would not dry out. Next time I'll add a bit more sausage and shrimp! All I had left were the corn and potatoes.

We have been looking for a receipt for this and it knocked it out of the park.  Made on variance with  changing the timing on the ingredients to make the corn a little bit more cooked: 
Potato 10 min
Corn 5 min
Meat 10 min
Shrimp 5 min

Yummm!  I cut this recipe in half to feed six and have enough leftovers for two.  Essentially followed the recipe with some tweaks others have recommended - added a can of beer, some garlic and lemon juice to the water.  Cut all ingredients in half. Gave corn and potatoes a little extra cooking time -- added them first for 10 minutes before adding sausage for 10 minutes.  Added shrimp last and only cooked about three minutes til they changed color -- I agree not to overcook the shrimp!!!  Drained, squeezed some lemon and sprinkled some parsley on top and served with warm buttered French bread (and beer). Delicious!!!  I was concerned it might be too spicy, but it's not.

My family first encountered this 4 yrs ago, when my husband's cousins from SC were in charge of dinner; we are pretty late that night! Anyways, we've been making it every summer since then! I'm from MI and had never heard of it, but love seafood, once it was explained to me what it was. We follow the directions as written and it turns out perfect every time! Highly recommend using newspaper on your table & just dump out the contents of the pot after water has been drained, makes for an easy clean-up!

Easy and fun all-in-one seafood feast. Easy to scale down for 3-4 people or scale up for a crowd. One change was to add about one TBL lemon juice. Since I used regular smoked sausage I added about 1/2 TBL crushed red pepper. Served with cornbread and salad. Tastes just like the seafood boils I've enjoyed in SC.

This was delicious.  Made 'as is' with the addition of adding two lbs of fresh Italian sausage which I pre-cooked and sliced into 2" pieces and two quartered sweet onions which I added the same time as the potatoes.  This is an absolute crowd pleaser, serving 12 amply.  It's too bad I can't upload a picture, because it was a visual treat as well.    For the non-seafood eater in our house, I merely pulled out her portion before adding the shrimp.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is just SO easy, it's hard to say anything bad about it.  The Old Bay Seasoning doesn't season it as much as I thought it would, but overall this was a pretty good dish!

I will make this again.  It has become our annual Christmas dinner.  I added a few things.  We cut the shrimp to 2 lbs, added a pound of mussels and 2 pounds of King Crab legs and 4 small lobsters about 4 oz. each.  Delicious.    My grandchildren love it and it is easy to cook with lots of time for family.  Clean up is a breeze,  I use freezer paper on the table and when we are done, curl it up in a ball and toss it.  No silverware only thing to wash is the beverage glasses.  Great time.

The potatoes got a little soft. The corn was stiffer than we care for and we added it with the sausage to give it extra time. We prefer Louisiana brand seasoning over Old Bay. But the flavor was awesome and just enough kick.

I have made this recipe a few times but adjusted it slightly each time.  The changes I made include using Zatarain's crab boil  with a pinch of Old Bay instead of all Old Bay.  With the seasoning, I also threw in a few cloves of fresh crushed garlic. My kids are not fond of spicy sausage, so I used beer brats.  Everyone loves this dish!  Thanks for posting.

I made this for a Cousins party and it was a big hit! I added a can of beer,an onion, bay leaf  and clams.  I cooked it outside and we took turns adding the ingredients. Not only was the meal delicious, but lots of fun preparing it!

I was leery when I first tried this, I think bc of the name!  However, I was at my pregnant friends house in SC visiting and had to take over dinner when she didn't feel well.  IT WAS SO EASY to make and everyone loved it.  For those that say it was tasteless, I suggest shaking on extra old bay after draining everything.  Perfect meal, simple, one dirty dish, feeds a ton.  10 out of 10!

We've made this using shrimp, crawdads, scallops,, and sometimes combined ingredients and never had any leftover. It's become a family favorite when we have large gatherings. 
Makes it easy to feed a large group.

This was a huge hit, everybody loved it.  I did two batches so I could use less spice in one of them for the diners who are sensitive to spice.  Both of them turned out delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  Never tried mAking anything like this before and it was awesome!  Only thing i would do different is drizzle a little garlic butter over it right before we dig in like another reviewer suggested.  Yum!

I have been making this recipe for 25 years.  I don't usually add potatoes and I use Seafarers crab and shrimp boil - 2 bottles - to add a little kick.  My husband and father-in-law adore it.  I serve it with lots of crusty bread and iced tea (or beer).

Yep, this is pretty much what you get in the restaurants, except most of them add some snow crab legs.  Not sure where they're getting them, haven't seen snow crabs in the wild down here, yet.  Ate until we were full, and still had trouble stopping.

I'm always looking for easy meals the family will love and this was a hit! I added clams and mussels.
