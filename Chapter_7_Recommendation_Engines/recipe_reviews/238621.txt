This is so easy to put together and produces a restaurant quality entry.  If clams are unavailable mussels would be equally good.  I did make two minor changes, substituting red wine for white and I gave the garlic bread a pass and made rolls that would absorb some of the wonderful sauce.  Thanks for a very tasty dinner!

I'm generally one who makes modifications to a recipe from the get go.  However, besides some inaccurate measurements I did this one as is and WOW!  Our guests loved it, the flavors melded perfectly and despite my inclination to omit the fennel seeds I put them anyway and they added to the taste rather than over powering the dish as I had expected.  Note:  the recipe doesn't specify if the sausage is smoked or raw cased.  I went with the smoked and it was excellent.  Also served over pasta rather than with costinis and did garlic bread on the side.
