I loved this recipe! The cheesecake came out so amazing and delicious! I made it a couple times already and everyone else loved it too! The only thing I changed is that I actually peeled, cut up and boiled the sweet potatoes until they were nice and soft. Then I let them cool off for a while and added them to the mix. Thanks so much for the recipe!
