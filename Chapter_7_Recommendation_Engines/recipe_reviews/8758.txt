I can't rave about this recipe enough!  It was absolutely fabulous!  I only added about 1 1/2 pks of the spinach, and mixed the spinach, ricotta & chicken together for easy layering.  I used fresh (refrigerated), no-boil noodles and just let them cook in the sauce.  I did add about 1/2 cup white wine to the sauce and added a lot more garlic.  I did add almost twice the amount of ricotta and added a few extra cups of mozzerella.  (There's no such thing as too much cheese in my house:) My husband and friend who came over for dinner couldn't get enough!.  Definitely elegant and interesting enough to serve at a dinner party, but great for any family dinner as well.  I was just really pleased with this meal.

**Addendum 8/24/04--I just wanted to add that recently I began using fresh spinach in this recipe and it improved greatly.  I de-stemmed the spinach (about 1 lb bag) and then threw it in a pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Cooked it down until it was tender and bright green.  The frozen spinach is mostly stems, so substituting fresh spinach took care of that problem

my sister absolutely loves this dish! whenever she comes to visit from college, she begs me to make it. to kick up the flavor in the chicken, i marinate it overnight in a combination of roasted garlic (garlic drizzled w/ olive oil and put in the oven until it's soft and sweet), FRESH basil (nothing compares to the flavor) olive oil, and a splash of lemon juice. then i grill the chicken for additional flavor. it really makes it rustic. I add a layer of sauteed veggies (onion, garlic, fresh garlic, mushrooms, matchstick carrots, and zucchini). Mine ends up going: sauce, noodles, ricotta/spinich mixture, chicken, sauce, noodles, ricotta/spinich, veggies, sauce, noodles, ricotta/spinich, chicken, sauce, cheese. It is so good!

The only way I could describe this dish is havenly.  It is pretty rich though so I won't be making it often and I felt like I dirtied every pan I own.  I made a few adjustments and have a few more that I will try next time I make it.
For the sauce I added about two teaspoons of chopped garlic from a jar and thought it was perfect.  I didn't chop my onions fine enough though.  I recommend you chop them very fine.  I only had one 10 oz can of chicken broth so I made up the rest of the two cups of broth with white wine.  I used the amount of oregano and basil called for and thought that was perfect.  But the wine may have hidden some of the taste.  I added salt and pepper at the very end based on taste.  I am not sure how much I added.
The recipe is not clear if the noodles should be precooked, so I used no bake noodles.  
I baked the chicken in the oven with no spices.  The chicken itself didn't have much flavor, but you don't miss it with everything else going on.
I used a 16 oz package of spinach and was still a little too much in my opinion.  Next time I will use one 10 oz package.
I didn't pay attention to how the recipe said to layer, because it didn't make any sense to me.  I put a third of the sauce in the pan, a layer of noodles, half of the chicken, spinach, and ricotta.  Then another layer of noodles, 1/3 of the sauce, rest of the chicken, spinach and ricotta.  The final layer of noodles and sauce.  Then the mozzerella and parm. cheese.  
Because I made ahead of

This was wonderful.  I made the following modifications:  made 1/3 more sauce.  Used only 1 package of spinach, which I mixed into the ricotta.  I layered in the following way:  1/4 sauce, 3 noodles, 1/2 ricotta/spinach, 1/2 chicken, 1/4 of sauce, 1/3 of remaining mozz/parm, 3 noodles, rest of ricotta/spinach, rest of chicken, 1/4 of sauce, 1/3 of remaining mozz/parm, 3 noodles, rest of sauce, rest of mozz/parm, sprinkled with fresh parsley.

This was fabulous!  My husband enjoyed it so much he took leftovers for lunch the next day.  I did cook 1/2 lb of chopped bacon until crisp, remove and drain on some paper towel.  I then cooked 2 chopped raw chicken breast in the bacon grease until slightly brown and done and then drained on paper towels.  Giving the chicken a slight bacony flavour.  Then in layering I sprinkled the cooked bacon over the layer of spinach. It was great.  It combined one of my favourite combinations, a classic, chicken, bacon and spinach.  You must try adding the bacon.

DELICIOUS!! I used fat free ricotta cheese and couldn't even tell the difference.  I also cut back on the spinach because I thought one package was more then enough.  I was a little confused as to whether or not I should cook the noodles first.  I chose not to and they cooked perfectly in the cheese sauce!!  Great recipe.

I went on the fantastic reviews and made this dish for a group of 12 women without even testing it out first.  I was scared, but I have nothing to be scared of!  It was awesome!

I took the advice of others and added extra mozzerella on the top and used no-boil noodles.  It all worked out perfectly and every single woman at my party asked for the recipe.  I HIGHLY recommend this!

PS - My husaband like this recipe so much that he ate some for breakfast!

I found this recipe 5 years ago right after I got married and was in need of some good recipes. This was a HOME RUN! I have since added lots more garlic, more cheese and even created a spinach and mushroom layer that I also flavor with garlic. I get asked for this recipe whenever I make it. Most importantly...it has become a family favorite! I usually do most of the prep work far in advance so I just need to throw it all together and whip up the sauce.  Well worth the efforts every time!

This was okay and I will make it again but I think it needs some tweaking to make it really good.  Next time, I will use a straight bechamel, using all milk and no chicken broth. I will probably use just parmesan cheese and skip the mozzarella, too. I think part of the reason I found this recipe so bland was that there was no nutmeg in the white sauce - for me nutmeg is a must, both for the bechamel AND for the spinach! Besides all the issues I had with the sauce, I made a couple changes to the "structure" of the lasagna - first putting sauce in the pan, then noodles, chicken with sauce, noodles, spinach with ricotta (I substituted cottage cheese), noodles, then the chicken mixture again, noodles, then the spinach mixture again, more noodles, finishing with plain sauce topped with more parmesan cheese. I used no-boil soft lasagna noodles throughout. I like to make lasagna on "swim lesson night" because I can make it ahead and have it bake and set before we get home, and my daughter doesn't like tomato-based lasagna so I will definitely make chicken and spinach lasagna again, but next time I'll do it "my way"...

Wow!  This recipe is awesome!  My entire family raved--and they are fussy eaters!  Modifications:  I used chicken tenders and poached them, then shredded them (used about 3c.shredded chicken); strained poaching liquid and added 2 chicken bouillon cubes to 3c liquid (stay with me here) instead of the 2c canned broth, added about 1/2c more milk plus that extra cup broth BECAUSE I used no-boil lasagna noodles.  Sauce consistency was PERFECT!!!  I also covered pan with foil and baked about 45-50 minutes, and let it stand without foil outside oven about 10 minutes to "set up".  Yummmmmmm!

Wonderful recipe, especially for cheese lovers. After scoring through the reviews and baking it myself, I have the following suggestions: 1. If you are using no boil lasagna noodles, add 1/2 cup more milk to the sauce. 2. Saute one pound of mushrooms in some butter and then saute FRESH spinach in the same pot. The  mushrooms nicely accent the spinach layer and add some flare. 3. Use THREE cups of chicken. (I used Tyson ready to serve grilled slices that I chopped up with scissors). 4. Instead of just shredded mozzarella, use a six cheese Italian blend. Very filling and decadent meal. I cut this into 12 pieces and 1/12th was more than enough per person.

Easy. Delicious. Great as leftovers, if there's any left. Want to try a white chicken pizza with this white sauce and grilled chicken sometime.

Because I liked the ingredients in this recipe, I decided to give it a try, but modified it to make it easier to make.  This is what I did and it turned out great:  Instead of lasagna noodles, I used a lb. of rotini.  (I HATE cooking lasagna noodles, don't ask me why).  I cooked the pasta while the chicken was boiling.  I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and chopped them up when they were done boiling.  At the same time the pasta and chicken were cooking, I defrosted the spinach in the microwave and pressed all the moisture out of it.  I mixed the chicken, pasta, and spinach all together in the pasta pot after I drained off the pasta.  I seasoned it with the oregano, a little basil, salt, and pepper.  I made the cheese sauce as directed and added a little nutmeg to the sauce when it was done.  If you have one of those little choppers, I highly recommend using it to finely mince your onions and garlic.  Then, I added two eggs to the ricotta cheese along with a little bit of parmesan cheese, about 1/4 cup.  To assemble this recipe, I layered pasta mixture, ricotta, and cheese sauce in that order ending up with cheese sauce.  I then covered the top with mozzarella cheese and sprinkled on a bit of parmesan, popped it into the oven and baked it for 35 minutes.  This way is much easier for my kiddos to eat and I feel the ingredients blend together better this way.  It all fit very nicely in a 9x13 pan.  We will definately be making this again.  The taste was awesome!  The o

this was SO good (i'd give it 5 stars but i did make changes).
i did halve the spinach as suggested and i'm glad i did, that would have been WAY too much spinach (however, one should note that the typical frozen spinach packages that say they are 300grams/10oz do NOT equal out to be that much when all the water is squeezed out of them, at least not in my case. to get just 10oz i needed to use 3-300gram packages of spinach. i usually squeeze out all the water and weigh the spinach afterwards).
i also cut up and fried some chicken breast in olive oil with salt,pepper, garlic and onion powder to give the chicken flavor (i really wouldn't advise having just plain chicken in it).
i also cooked some mushrooms with the onion and garlic (added 2 extra cloves as well) and then added the chicken in as well. i have made this dish with no chicken as well and i actually prefer it better that way.
i also mixed the spinach with the ricotta cheese and added some pepper to it. (so the layering was sauce, noodles, spinach mixture, sauce, mozzarella cheese, noodles, spinach mixture, sauce, mozzarella cheese, noodles, sauce, parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese). 
it was really really good. even my partner liked it and she doesn't like spinach usually!. i didn't find it to be too thick at all and it heated up great later. 

make sure to drain your spinach very very well!

My family and I love this recipe. I make two 7 1/2 x 9 1/2 baking dishes. We eat one and freeze the other for the future. The only change I make to this dish is I use 1 pound boneless, skinless, chicken breast cut into bite size pieces. After I pan fry the chicken, I mix the chicken, spinach, ricotta cheese, 2 cups mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese together in a large bowl. It made everything a lot easier. I spread 1 cup sauce on bottom, layer with noodles, 2 cups chicken mixture, noodles, 1 cup sauce, 2 cups chicken mixture, noodles, last cup sauce. Sprinkle with parsley and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese on top.

This was so yummy!  My whole family loved it and it's really harty...will likely get 3 meals out of 1 pan! I made this mostly as stated, but after reading reviews of this being dry, bland and too cheesey/spinachy I made a couple small mods. (Bear with me, this is gonna be wordy, but it really seems to solve a lot of problems.)  I used 2 cups milk, only 1 pkg of spinach and only about 2 cups of cheese. I also did the layering just a little differently. After making the white sauce I divided it in 1/2. To one half I added the chicken and 1 cup of cheese (old Cheddar to give it a little more zip) and I used the other half to coat my pan and for the final layer of noodles. To the ricotta I added the spinach, salt and 1/2 cup parm. The layering went like this: Sauce (without chicken), noodles, ricotta/spinach mixture, noodles, sauce (with chicken), noodles, sauce (without chicken), topped with parm and mozza. The end result was moist, rich, perfectly seasoned and sinfully delicious! Can't wait till tomorrow to get my hands on those leftovers!

This recipe took me a good two hours to prepare. I kept saying I hope this recipe is worth the time. When it was finished and we finally got to sit down and eat it, I was strongly gratified at how GOOD it was. I was worried it was going to have too much spinach but it didn't. It was perfect. So very good, I wouldn't change a thing.

I tried this recipe today, it was really delicious, it came out perfect even though it's my first time to do a lasagna ;) I read alot of the reviews before I started cooking to see if there were interesting tips that I could try out :) OK, so this is how I did it, first  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, but I definitely went through all the fuss of de-stemming, steaming, chopping, then cooking it with little bit of better :) I also added white mushrooms, and for next time I will definitely use more of it, I cooked the mushrooms with the spinach then added the ricotta cheese on them, so it became the mushroom-spinach-ricotta mixture (and I considered it as a layer), also I took the advice of adding more garlic but not too much and also increasing the amount of the sauce mixture (by increasing the amount of chicken broth and milk but not too much), For the chicken layer, I choose to mix it with the cheesy sauce, so the chicken feels softer and juicier, plus I grilled the chicken instead of just cooking it, to give some twist in the taste, as some reviewers suggested, that's all the additions I did, This recipe is definitely a KEEPER, BTW: this is my first review on allrecipes, and it feels good to share your thoughts and experiences on cooking :)

Great recipe!  I just made it tonight and it was WONDERFUL!  I only changed it a little, I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta cheese, and I added a zucchini and mushrooms to the spinach layer.  I changed the cheese because I thought with all the cheeses in the recipe it would be too strong.    Also I divided the recipe into 4 mini-lasagna pans I bought at the dollar tree.  I cooked one of them and froze the others.  I am only cooking for 2 and I know if I made the entire dish it would be bad before we got around to eating the entire dish.

I cant for the life of me understand why members constantly change an original recipe to what suits their personal taste, and rate it low.

Sorry folks but you aren't helping others who want to know how the original recipe was. 
Isn't that what a review is? A review of the posted recipe?

If you like your version better than the original, than post your full recipe on the board so you can share it with others. 

You're not being honest and fair to the person who took the time to share a great recipe (with us), you tweak it to your personal preferences, and then rate it low because it didn't come out good. Doesn't make sense because you are rating your own recipe if you make changes and rate it as though its the original, when it is not.

I used whole wheat oven ready lasagna, low fat cheeses, wilted fresh spinach and refrigerated chicken shortcuts.  It was absolutely amazing.

On the advice of others, I increased the garlic and spices, and only used 1 bag of fresh spinach.  Used no-boil lasagna noodles and increased milk to 2 c.  After cooking time was up, I broiled for a minute to crisp and brown the top layer of cheese.  It needs to sit for 20 minutes before cutting.  This allows the cheeses to hold everything together.  This is a great dish to make for guests ... put it together early in the day and no last minute cooking!  Turned out great.

I decided to make this at the VERY last minute tonight and it was so easy and turned out GREAT! I was a little nervous about it being bland after reading some of the reviews, so I went heavier on the garlic (~2 cloves) and seasoned my chicken breast with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before cooking it in olive oil. (I also opted for only 1/4 cup butter and my sauce was PERFECT! Not runny at all.) My husband said to put it on the list, so I guess I'll be making this again! Thanks!

Excellent! Plenty of sauce so its not at all dry - even reheated. I used one box of spinach because I have picky eaters, and instead of using the spinach as a layer I mixed it in with the cream sauce. My husband and 3 year old LOVED it!

All I can say is....YUMMY!!!!!!!! We are eating this dish as I write this. It is SOOOO good! I have 8 kids, even the pickiest of them have just given this a 5 star. The only thing I did after looking at the reviews, I did precook the noodles, added mushrooms and 1 1/2 times the sauce everything else stayed the same. This would also be great to throw the sauce together with the meat, spices, any veggies you wish and serve over angel hair pasta........so YUMMY!!!!! thanks

Very good.  Didn't use as much spinach and spread the spinach onto every layer.  Other than that wouldn't change a thing about recipe.

Phew. Complex recipe! I did change a couple things only because I spent some time reading the reviews and taking what I thought would be beneficial. I used the whole box of lasagna noodles, used all chicken broth in the sauce excepting a half cup of white wine. I also doubled the garlic and minced my onions really fine. Fred Meyer/Krogers had an italian mix of cheese (parmesan, mozzerella and provolone) on sale for a buck each so I used two packages of that, to save a little time. I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta because....we'll.....we don't like ricotta AND I'm cheap. In the cottage cheese mixture, I added a little more basil and oregano. I only made two layers and the layers went sauce, noodles, cottage cheese/cheese mixture, spinach then chicken. It made it easier because all I had to do is divide everything in half. This really only took about an hour to cook and assemble which was a godsend because I have plans this afternoon so I could cook all the ingredients and assemble, then cover and let it set in the fridge so all I have to do is pop it in the oven until dinner. Thank you to all those before me who provided reviews, they were very helpful. NOTE: This was super rich. I couldn't even eat too much of it and my kids weren't keen on it at all. I am thankful to have tried it out, it was quite tasty but I probably won't make it again. It's just too heavy.

My husband and I made this last night and it is delicious.  I used oven ready lasagna, which worked great. I had to bake about 50 minutes, covered. Next time, I plan to add a can of chopped, marinated artichoke hearts to one of the layers.

I used 2 full pkgs of the spinach which I think was a little bit too much, Next time I will cut that down and use more chicken, other wise this was wonderful!!  Love that my house smelled like the Olive Garden too!

Fantastic!  My three year old picked this recipe after it came up in the "20 Best Recipes for Kids" category.  He helped with every step (so it's definitely easy!), and it came out fantastic!  We will definitely add this to our book of regular dinners, though next time I will add more basil and oregano.  Highly recommend!

It is very tasty and enjoyed it very much. A few things learned on the first try is that the layering instructions seem disproportionate, so I would layer more evenly next time. I would also mix the cheeses and flavor the chicken all together then place on the noodles.  I would like to crust a little more, so perhaps some bread crumbs on top too and lastly I definitely needed to let it sit- it was much too soupy when it came out of the oven. I love it though, so for me it is just working out some technical stuff. Great recipe thanks for sharing!

Just made this recipe this afternoon.  My bf loved it! I think the following changes may have helped, because without them I could see how some reviewers would call this recipe too bland.   Chicken Prep: Melted 1/4 cup of butter in a stock pot, added onions and garlic, let them cook until nearly translucent. Added 4 whole breast of chicken seasoned with salt, pepper, and onion powder, cooked on each side for about 2 mins per side then filled the stock pot with boiling water.  Once chicken was cooked through I poured out the water and chilled the chicken in the fridge.  After chilled I shredded instead of cubing the chicken. 2nd change, I added the entire cup of parmesan to the sauce and an extra 1/2 c of mozzarella.  Sauce was not soupy at all. 3rd change; I took an 8oz pkg of softened cream cheese, whipped it, added the spinach to the cream cheese, seasoned with salt, pepper, a pinch of nutmeg. Then I added the ricotta to the cream cheese and spinach mixture.  I layered per the directions and cooked for 35-37 mins.  It was a huge hit!  Don't know if this will be a regular on the house hold menu since there are SOOO many steps involved.

I made this for a dinner party and my guests loved it!  I did alter the recipe a bit, using 1 cup ricotta mixed with the mozerella and parmesan chz and distributing evenly throughout the layers. More garlic was called for including sauteing chicken in garlic and olive oil.  Broccoli replaced the spinach due to the recent spinach scare! I also added mushrooms which  is always a good idea unless you have a distaste for fungi.

This is the basis white lasagna I'v been looking for - similar to Stauffers.  I'd prefer the sauce a little thinner - will either add more broth or less flour.  Also, for vegetarian, will omit the chicken and maybe add some thinly sliced zucchini and carrots.  I loved the flavor.

I really liked the flavor of this recipe.  I was a tad worried when reading reviews that it would be bland.  But it turned out lovely.  A nice mellow taste, that wasn't overpowering.  I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and mixed the chicken, ricotta, and spinach together.  It made for easier spreading.  Also, by total accident, I used all chicken broth (4c.) and left out the milk.  After I realized I did this, I was concerned it wouldn't turn out right.  However, I didn't notice anything different at the end.  Lastly, I only used half the spinach.  Two boxes probably would have been fine, but the kids don't like it too much, so I didn't want to push my luck!
I ended up layering it like this:  1 c. sauce, 3 noodles, 1/3 of the chicken mixture, 1/4 c. mozzarella.  I did three layers like this and then topped it off with the extra sauce and the remaining mozzarella on top. 
It's important to let it set for about 10 minutes before serving, that way the sauce thickens up and everything melds together well.  Overall, this was an excellent recipe.  It would be great to serve at a dinner party for guests.

This was FANTASTIC! BF says best chicken lasagna ever. I upped the garlic because we love it, upped the basil a bit, used fresh sauteed spinach (used 3/4 lb., but 1 lb. would have been better)and added 1/2 cup white wine to the bechamel sauce. Wow. Thanks Lisa for an amazing recipe!

This was very good!  I did make a few changes.  I probably tripled the garlic in the sauce and I also added more parmesan.  I only used about 1/3 of the amount of butter called for, to try and make up for the extra calories from the extra cheese.  I mixed the spinach and ricotta together to make layering easier.  I also grated a carrot and added it for color, and extra veggies.  I made this when I was having friends over for dinner.  We all loved it!  I will definitely be making this again, but not too often since it's pretty high calorie, but delicious!

I have made white lasagna before without problems, however, this recipe doesn't cut it!!  I followed directions exactly.  It smelled wonderful while cooking but was too rich and down right unappetizing to eat.  I had company over and after one bite everyone had to laugh and said they couldn't eat it. Won't be making this one again!!

This was great, but of course, I tweaked the recipe. I only used half the amount of spinach, extra garlic, salted the sauce to taste before layering, heavy cream instead of milk, and fresh cut basil with the parsley on top! Absolutely delicious!

I love this recipe! It is my husband's favorite. My changes were to use no-boil lasagne noodles, add mushrooms to the spinach and sautee the spinach and mushroom mixture in white wine and garlic, and to use chicken tenderloins coated in parmesan cheese and then cooked for 20 minutes in a skillet with white wine and butter. I think the white wine really adds to the overall flavor of this dish.

This recipe was delicious and so easy!! The only thing I did differently was that I only used 1 package of spinach, which was a perfect amount. Also, for the next time, I think I will shred the chicken meat instead of cutting it into cubes, since it everything else was so smooth that it was weird to bite into a chunk of chicken. Also, the next time I make this, I think that I will leave the seasonings out of the sauce (I thought it was a bit too much) and season the ricotta instead with about half of the amount of seasonings. Another thing I wish I did: usually when I make any type of pasta stuffed with ricotta, I will add an egg to the cheese and beat it up well--I think it holds it all together much better. This recipe didn't say to do that, so I didn't...and the ricotta just seemed to be falling out all over the place. Other than a few modifications I will make, I thought this recipe was delicious!! I will definitely make it again.

This was awesome.  As much as it bugs me when people change a recipe then rate it, I have to confess I did double the sauce so I could avoid cooking the lasagne noodles (w/xtra sauce they cook up just fine in the oven!) and I had some dried wild mushrooms so I rehydrated them and chopped them up fine and added them to the sauce with a bit of the mushroom liquid.  Rave reviews from everyone but my finicky 15 year old!

A *very* tasty recipe but we had a few problems.  First, we used oven-ready lasagne noodles so we should have increased either the broth or milk to provide more moisture for cooking the noodles.  Because we didn't do this, the lasagne came out on the dry side.  (Some may prefer it this way, but I like my lasagne a bit on the "saucy" side.)  Next, we were in a rush so we didn't have time to properly thaw the spinach.  This resulted in "blobs" of spinach in some places, and no spinach in others.  Overall, though, we loved the results and, next time, will adjust the liquids and properly thaw the spinach for a better result.

UPDATE:  I made this a second time and it turned out just as tasty and not as dry as the first time.  Yummy!

OMG this was amazing!!!  LOVED it!  It was so good that I made it for a friend and she loved it too.  I added a bag of fresh broccoli in one layer.  And I used 1 bag of fresh spinach, instead of frozen.  Best idea was to freeze the leftovers in individual size portions in freezer bagies.  Stick it in the microwave for a few minutes and it is still sooo good!

Great recipe though time consuming but a few things I did to make it better: The sauce was really thick although I followed the recipe exactly, it didn't want to spread. I added additional stock to thin it out and it was perfect when done, not dry at all and held together well. You definitely need more than nine lasagna noodles, which is the reason I gave it only four stars. In order to fill the 9x13 pan, using 3 per layer there were gaps between the noodles. I ended up using 12 noodles which was inconvenient because I had only cooked nine. I used about three cups of chicken as two weren't enough for that big of a pan. I used fresh spinach instead of the frozen. I mixed the ricotta with an egg, parsley and parmesan which is how I do it for regular lasagna.

I used 3 cloves of garlic and skimped on the spinach and nowhere near the amount of ricotta.  Can't wait to try this creamy sauce on ravolli or angle hair pasta!

My whole family loved this - 2 & 4 year old kids and all!  They all cringed at the spinach - but still loved it.  I made a half batch, and It was gone so fast - even leftovers that we had, were gone the next day and it was just as good reheated!  
I did use chopped chicken that i already had leftover from a whole chicken I had roasted, this made the prep very fast!
Definite keeper!

This was very good.  I followed the recipe as is, but thought it needed something else, maybe more salt?  Will make again using some of the suggestions.

I've made something very similar before, and the one extra that I highly recommend is some diced prosciutto ham.  It is fantastic.  I also put in a dash of fresh ground nutmeg.

I tried creamy chicken lasagna (Caroline) that only my daughter likes.  Was trying for one we would all like.  Not it.  It's very bland (the other one was, too) & dry.  I won't throw something out unless I can't do anything with it.  I won't be making it again, but I did improve it by mixing it with marinara sauce.  (I cut it into small squares, mixed gently with sauce, topped with more cheese & called it an italian casserole.)  The sauce provided flavor & moisture.

While cooking it I could not stop eating the sauce!  I was kind of suprised though after eating it, it was not as cheesy as I thought it would be after making that big pot off sauce.  I think next time I will add mozzerala in the layers and on top to make it more oozy with cheese!

Excellent dish.  I made this and an American Lasagna at the last dinner party I had and they were equally loved, though more guests commented on this one and I had a few requests for the recipe.  It was almost like they were taken by surprise that they thought this was as fantastic as it is.  It's easy to make, I actually put it together the night before and baked it the following day.  Fantastic.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Make sure you squeeze all the excess water out of your spinach.  I will definitely make it again.

This is a great base recipe. Like others suggested I used a layer with spinach, and added artichokes to my ricotta. Best lasagna ever! 

I sauteed my chicken with olive oil, onion and garlic salt and added mrs. dash (the yellow cap)

I mix the ricotta with artichokes, and garlic powder (any brand that says "marinated" and comes in a jar works well) make sure you really separate the pieces of artichoke or you'll get large chunks in a bite. Save the juice that the artichoke is marinating in for use in the spinach mixture. 

I used half mozzarella and half italian blend of cheeses ( I think there's asiago, provolone, and romano in that) along with parmesean and I make about 1.5X the amount of cheese sauce required and add 1/3 of it to 16 oz. of frozen spinach that I've thawed out in a separate pot. I add about 1/3-1/2 cup of marinade from the artichokes and about a tsp or 2 of chicken base. (for making chicken broth) I also add Mrs. Dash+Garlic/Onion salt to this mixture as well.

This makes 5 layers including noodles, (I layer sauce, noodles, ricotta, chicken, spinach) and it's a bit of extra work but the taste is WORTH it!

This was a good, simple recipe although I did make a few changes to make a better fit in our house and based on past experiences with similar recipes. First I made 1 1/2 the amount of sauce and used more noodles, a full box. To the sauce in addition to the mozzarella I added about a cup of white wine and a good handful of shredded swiss cheese and fresh parmesan and a dash of nutmeg. I used way more garlic than called for. I shredded my chicken rather than dicing and mixed it into the ricotta mixture (ricotta, mozzarella, swiss, basil, oregano, garlic and pepper) to make one less thing to layer. Rather than using frozen spinach I used fresh broccoli cut into tiny florets that I blanched in the boiling pasta water for about 2 to 3 minuets till they JUST started to get tender, they will finish cooking when you bake the lasagne, before submerging in ice water to stop the cooking and preserve the bright green color. Next time I make this I will use the broccoli along with sauteed fresh spinach and sliced mushrooms. Zucchini would probably be good too. This is a great, easy and customizable recipe that will be added to my regular rotation.

I love this dish and my husband loves it even more.  He claims to hate spinach..so I lied and said it was parsley that he saw.  He ate it and absolutely loves it.  I don't cook with wine or salt and it was still GREAT.  Next time I make it I will add more chicken.  By the way I told the truth after he finished his 3rd plate.

Very good recipe. The only changes I made were soaking the noodles in hot tap water for about 30 minutes instead of boiling them and doubling the parmesan cheese(parmegano reggiano). I also used 1/2 cup heavy cream and one cup of milk. I accidently only used half the spinach and it was still plenty. I added an egg and some s/p garlic/onion powder to the ricotta and put the ricotta on two layers. I ended up using about 15 noodles in all and had to bake it a bit longer, a little over an hour. I let it sit for about an hour before cutting in to it and it came out beautiful. It all stayed together nicely and tasted delicious. Nice and creamy and oh so rich. One small piece will do it along side a salad with a tangy vinegrette. You need some acid to cut all the richness. Oh and I also used four garlic cloves and two onions. This recipe is definately a keeper!!

I cut down on the spinach by 3/4, added some fresh basil, and just a handful of cheddar to the sauce to give it a different flavor. I used ground chicken instead of chopped. Loved it.

These was delicious!!! I have made it twice already with excellent reviews from my family and in-laws. I added a splash of white wine to the sauce and extra garlic. I also sauteed some more garlic in oil and cooked cubed chicken seasoned w/some salt, pepper and onion powder. When the chicken was just about done cooking I added the spinach and sauteed for about a minute. This gave it a lot more flavor then just adding plain cooked chicken. I mixed the ricotta with an egg and some more seasonings (grated Parmesan, oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper). I then layered sauce, noodles, ricotta mix and chicken/spinach mix then more sauce and so on.... I will definitely be making this again!  Even my very picky 2 year old (who does not eat meat or spinach) ate it!! The next time I make this I will double the sauce and use the extra to make pizza! yum!!!

This was very good, the only reason it did not get 5 stars from me was due to the following modifications I made or would make:  Chop the onion finely; eliminate the oregano and add 1-2 tbs. of fresh basil, one beaten egg, 1 package of spinach and a couple of dashes of nutmeg to the ricotta; use skim milk and low fat mozzarella; use no-cook lasagna pasta; eliminate the parsely; cover lasaagna for first 35 min, uncover let cook until bubbly; place under broiler for a few minutes to brown lightly

Oh my..... this was SO good.... so rich but so delicious... I went with other reviewers and only used one bag of spinach, and mixed it with the ricotta.  Used a shredded Rotisserie chicken and kept everything else exactly the same.  Five stars all the way, but with the amount of cheese in this thing, I will only by making it once in a while!! : )

Turned out GREAT. This is the second time my husband made it. Only thing done differently is that after the chicken was cubed while he was preparing everything else he let the chicken soak in white wine. So good that my daughter even asked us to put it in her bottle for her.

This was super easy to make!  Since we like a touch of spice I added in 1/2 serrano with the onion. I also used fresh spinach & basil then mixed it in with the ricotta.  I garnished the top with sliced tomatoes & basil then covered with cheese & remaining sauce.  It is fantastic!  Thanks!

wow....this was excellent...although, i did make my fair share of subs....half parmesan for half of the ricotta (less ricotta-y)...some crushed red pepper, some italian flat leaf parsley, fresh basil instead dried, MUCH more farlic, italian seasoning, mushrooms....it was AWESOME.

This turned out very well for me.  I have never had chicken lasagna and hubby liked it as well.  I did add more garlic (we love the stuff) and added more cheese than the recipe called for.  (I also did a mixture of ricotta and cottage cheese...personal preference.)  Thanks for the post...definately will make again.

Labor-intensive, but very, very good. I only cooked my noodles until flexible (about 3 minutes - they cooked the rest of the way in the oven) and used a pound of fresh spinach instead of the 2 pkgs of frozen. Washed the spinach in a collander and poured the noodle water over it to wilt, which meant one less pot to wash. Yay! A little salty for my taste, but I don't usually cook with much salt. Will probably make again someday.

Edit: I've made this several times now and upped my star count to 5. I crave this!! Easy to double, freezes beautifully. This last time I added 4 oz sliced mushrooms to the spinach layer. Not necessary, but soooo good!

It's pretty rare that I follow the recipe very strictly. It's even more unusual that I love the result. I am happy to report that this recipe falls into both categories. Well... I did make one change. Since I didn't add any salt to the broth, chicken or spinach, I had to add more salt (I suppose 3 teaspoons, but I just added to taste).

I made it for a big family dinner and everyone loved it. Even me ;)

This lasagna is AMAZING with a few tweaks. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken - just enough chicken and lots of flavor! I used 1 bag of fresh spinach and sauteed it in olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper. It doesn't look like it would be enough, but we thought it was the perfect amount. For the sauce I added one green bell pepper and mushrooms.  I finely chopped the onion, pepper and mushrooms and sauteed them in olive oil with garlic salt. I used cottage cheese instead of the ricotta..personal preference. It ended up being full of flavor and so yummy! 

I did use regular lasagna and boiled it beforehand...and it still ended up taking over an hour to cook, just FYI!

I made this a few nights ago for my husband and a few friends. They LOVED it. My husband is requesting it to be made again, and soon. I found it to be a bit labor intensive, but it was well worth it. Just the right amount of everything to make this meal taste heavenly!

Good recipe! Mine made enough to overflow the pan...def don't be shy with the cheese on this one..more the better...I didn't use enought salt, because we don't use a lot of salt, but between the ricotta and the spinach, it is def needed in this dish. use plenty of garlic and onion, otherwise this will be bland. I will def make again and add my own tweaks. I am thinking this would be good over egg noodles instead of lasagne....

Prepared just as instructed and It wasn't bad but I think that if the spinach, sauce, cheese and chicken were evenly mixed and distributed between noodles it would taste better.

I made this a while ago and froze the leftovers. I've been reheating individual pieces for my lunch. This is really tasty - such a nice change from the traditional red lasagna. I'll definitely make this one again - even just to freeze for lunches!

This was a little bland.  If I make it again I will mix the sauce with the spinach for that layer.  Also increase garlic to at least 3 cloves.

Ok, so this one wasn't so simple here in Bolivia. They don't have Ricotta, so I made a Ricotta facsimile from Milk, salt, and lemon juice. All we have is fresh spinach, so I steamed it and then used as mentioned in the recipe. We really enjoyed this dish . . . I'd like to try this when I return to the US and use store bought ricotta. I think that will be the final touch. I used way more garlic than called for too. I'll play with the recipe a bit more next time too, but all in all a great recipe!

1st impression: It was so much to pile into a 13x9 casserole dish! I was going to follow the recipe exactly, but I simply could not fit any more cheese into it, so by the last step, I ommitted much of the cheese. 
I cooked down two bags of spinach (stems removed) in some olive oil, instead of frozen. That turned out well. 
It was really good, even with the reduced cheese at the end.

I thought I had rated this before, perhaps I have but  this is a good recipe. I make this once a month and it is a keeper at my house. A few tips I use for this are using oven ready lasagna noodles. making and chopping extra chicken when I am making something else with chicken during the month (you can always freeze and use when ready) . Also I freeze my white cheese so it breaks up when thawed without having to grate, It goes in the sauce anyway so why go to the bother of meticulously grating the cheese. I also buy frozen chopped spinach which I thaw and put in ice cube trays to refreeze in cubes and then a big zip lock freezer bag. I put spinach in just about everything. All you have to do is throw as many or little cubes as you need in your recipe... easy peasy. These short cuts make this dish pretty quick to make with results that look like you slaved all day. As for taste I always add a little half and half and a can of mushroom soup with a can of mushrooms and extra Basil. This is not to change the original recipe it's just personal preference after having made this as the original many times. This dish is supper tasty as well as attractive. Highly recommended!!!!!

I made this as the recipe directed but didn't really like it. The sauce was very rich and each bite was overflowing with spinach. Although the it is a creamy sauce, the lasagna itself isn't very creamy. I think this was because there was so much spinach and the chicken doesn't crumble into small pieces like ground meats do.

I tried this recipie tonight in preparation for a new recipie for  our New Years party.  Everyone ate it but no one was  nuts about it. I think it was a bit bland as compared to the tomatoe sauce lasagnas. I did follow the recipie exactly. In order for me to make a recipie again I like it to be to something  I can not wait to have again- I was dissapointed I did not like this as much as I thought I would. It had such high reviews.

Before I say anything, I think this was the prettiest lasagna I've ever seen.  This was a good recipe, a nice twist on regular lasagna, but I still prefer the meat and red sauce.  I halved the recipe and put in an 8x8 pan (cookin for 2), I ended up needing about 1/2 c more broth to thin out the sauce, used cottage cheese instead of ricotta (my toddler doesn't like the texture), and used fresh spinach cooked down with T oil.  I think it just needs a little zing of pepper or something to make it memorable.

Excellent recipe. I made the following changes: I don't boil the noodles because the sauce is moist enough to cook/soften them in the oven.. so skip the boil-the-noodles step and save yourself some time. Also in the interest of time.. I bought a rotisserie chicken already cooked, so it gave it a delicious roasted chicken flavor. I also used fresh spinach and fresh basil as well as fresh parsley on top. A sure winner!! Great job!!

I am a bad cook, and even I got tremendous praise for this dish!  One pan was able to feed 6 people, who all went back for 2nds with leftovers to spare.  I also did a vegetarian variation a couple weeks ago by using eggplant instead of chicken (salted and drained, of course), and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  For all you people who "don't like eggplant," get over it, because you're missing out on a fantastic vegetarian lasagna!

My family refused to eat this lasagna after the first bite. WAY too much cheese, WAY too rich. If I were to ever try it again, I'd cut the cheese in half & add lots of veggies to lighten it up.

I MADE THIS DISH FOR A POT LUCK AT WORK AND EVERYONE LOVED IT!. I ENDED UP USING NON BAKE NOODLES. I ADJUSTED THE RECIPE TO INCLUDE MORE CHEESE(GIVES IT THAT GOLDEN BROWN TOP), 1/2 AN ONION AND 1/2 THE SPINACH CALLED FOR. ALSO, SHREDDED CHICKEN BREAST WAS USED. PREP WAS LENGTHY, BUT OVERALL WELL WORTH IT!

I was really excited about this recipe but it did not live up to my expectations.  It was simple enough to put together but ended up being very bland and uninteresting.  I also though this dish needed a thinner sauce.  Not a single member of my family commented on it and no one  went back for seconds (very unusual in my family).  This was not a bad recipe, just plain and boring.  I doubt that I will make this again.

This recipe turned out great and I can't wait to make it for when company comes over.  It is simple (except for the dirty dishes) and the taste is unbelievable). I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the salt a bit. It was plenty (1/2 teas.)

I'm pretty sure my tastebuds are messed up - I personally wasn't crazy about this recipe but I can't imagine why! I love everything that's in this recipe and I had a taste of the sauce before I started the "layers" and thought it was tasty but the final product (to me) was only okay. However, my roommate really liked this and my boyfriend and daughter found this to be "good." I too used those no bake lasagna noodles and worked well.  However, even though this dinner was a moderate success with my family, I'm not sure if I'll make it again. I'd still say give it a whirl if your tired of your meat-sauce lasgna dinners.

This was very very good.  I subbed 1/2 cup dry white wine in the broth.  I used a 16 oz package of frozen spinach...plenty.  I think the basil was overpowering.  It would be better with just a teaspoon of italian seasoning.  Also, if you're going to put on the third layer of noodles you're going to need more than nine lasagna noodles, unless you use a small pan.  More like 12 noodles.  Overall, an excellent recipe.  Would be great with seafood and cajun seasoning instead of italian seasoning.

Wow! The compliments flowed on Christmas! 
  I was looking for a non-red meat lasagna recipe, for those in our family who do not eat red meat. (Made a traditional lasagna as well.)This one sounded appealing, as it is did not call for canned chicken soup. I used two large cans of white chicken, which totaled two cups  Added a little more basil and oregano than recommended, as we love out Italian very spicy.  
  Made this up two days ahead, placed in freezer. Took out of freezer Christmas morn, and into a 250 degree oven about 3 hours prior to dinner, as it had not thawed thoroughly. Turned up the heat to 375 one hour prior and in less than 30 mins, lasagna was ready, complete with oohs and aahs from entire family.

After dinner, I went back and re-read the recipe to see if I missed some key ingredient(s).  The bottom layer was too mushy and tasted quite "blah".  We love spinach and I had high hopes for this recipe, but I won't be making it again.  Way too many calories and too much effort for something so tasteless.

I am not big on posting all the switches I made to the recipe..but this was excellent!  I like a little spice in my lazagna and hot italian sausage goes very well with spinach..so, I added 1 cup of hot italian sausage ground and 1 cups of chicken.  My kiddos do not like ricotta cheese, so I made the filling with 2 eggs, 1-8oz box of cream cheese and 1 cups of shedded italian blend cheeses and 1/4 cup parmesean.  DELICIOUS!

I read several reviews and made the following adjustments: I used 10 whole wheat lasagna noodles. They don't get mushy. I made 1&1/2 X sauce, 2 cloves garlic, 1/3-1/2 fresh basil, added 2 eggs to ricotta seasoned with 1/2 teas each of salt & pepper, used a bit more chicken, 2 large bags of fresh spinach sauteed in about a tbls. of olive oil (1 small clove of minced garlic), and I cut down on the amount of mozzarella and parmesan when assembling, since I had more sauce (therefore, more cheese). I made this for company and everyone had seconds (one man, even thirds). I will definitely make this again.

I’m very careful about selecting recipes based on ingredients and reviews so this is my 1st unfavorable review which seems odd considering the number of comments and wonderful ingredients, but I understand now why so many rated this good after they had completely altered the recipe… as written doesn’t work. This dish is bland, a waste of time, and a waste of $.  I prepared according to directions plus seasoning the chicken as mentioned in the comments. 25 minutes prep time is completely unrealistic – it takes a lot longer to make this dish and it takes longer than 35 mins bake time to heat the dish in the middle.  There is absolutely no flavor and very little texture.  The ricotta cheese overpowers the chicken and spinach flavors.  Considering the amount of prep and time this took, I was expecting a fabulous dish and was extremely disappointed as was my family.

This was just OK. The spinach was very overwhelming. I made recipe as directed except I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta since we don't like it. I probably won't make this one again.

The recipe calls for too much flour and too little chicken. I recommend that users start with 1/3 cup of flour and add more, if necessary, after adding the mozzrella and Parmesan. Also, 2 frozen packages of chopped spinach is too much, creating a crepe paper-like layer. I would use fresh spinach next time.

I made this for a work potluck and everyone loved it, it was the first dish to be devoured. I took some suggestions from the other raters. I cut the spinach in half, added mushrooms and green peppers, I shredded the chicken and mixed it in with the sauce and I also sprinkled crumbled bacon on top.

I am so disappointed in this recipe.  I did make one slight mistake of adding all the mozzarella with the sauce instead of dividing it, but I don't think the flavor would have been much better anyway.  I knew this was going to taste bad as soon as all that basil and oregano were in my pot.... Just too much herbs, but without them, it would be flavorless.  I was extremely excited to make this and I followed it as written, but it didn't come out well.  And believe the other reviews when they say it was too much spinach! I hate to give this one star, but it really was not good.

I have made this twice already in 3 days.  1st round was for my mother-in-law.  My 15 month old daughter could not get enough of this!!! Round 2 was for my girlfriend that just had a baby.  She and her family absolutely loved it!!! I did use no boil noodles and a little more cheese then called for.  Absolutely recommend to anyone wanting to try something out of their normal routine.  Also on the cooked chicken, I poached chicken breast with vegtables (good time to clean out regrigerator) and seasonings of my liking, with ground ginger on top of the list of course.

I made this according to the recipe - using fresh sauteed and drained spinach.  It looked wonderful but we found this rather bland - not bad but not flavorful.   If I make it again I will add much more seasonings.

im a fairly inexperienced cook, and made this for my 5 year anniversary with my boyfriend. WOW. we couldnt stop raving! the cheese was just PERFECT! i made no changes to the recipe except for taking reviewer's advice and cooking the chicken in bacon, those extra bits of bacon were a treat! do make sure you prep this in advance, especially if you are slow like me.

Scrumptious. I did decrease the amount of sauce to 3/4 though and it was plenty, using 1/3 cup each of the butter and flour, 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and 1 cup 1% milk. Kept the same amount of cheeses.  But I used a 16 ounce bag of frozen spinach (on hand) and it was plenty for the recipe. Increased the chicken to 3 cups (to get rid of it.) I also layered the dish the same as for regular lasagna in equal layers to even out the flavors, spreading the chicken, ricotta and spinach evenly in 3 layers, rather than putting the ricotta, chicken and spinach in one layer each.

Very time consuming and the results were not what the reviews promised.   Will not make again.  Even with fresh spinach it was too goopy and had a fishy taste. Yes, it was a change from the regualar lasagna but not a change I would go out of my way for again.  You can't taste the chicken and the cheese is just everywhere, but not in a good way.  Sorry but I'm going to delete this one from my recipe box.

Very good! Next time I am going to use only one box of spinach because we have a couple of people that are not huge spinach fans.

Thanks for the recipe. I just made this last night and the only thing I changed was adding a touch of white wine to the sauce.  I did find that there was definitely room for more flavour!  Next time I will follow other suggestions and add bacon to the mix (and using the same frying pan for the chicken!).

I put a twist on this inspired by Papa Murphy's Chicken Garlic Pizza, omitted the spinach, and added diced tomatoes and green onions. Was delicious. Love the chicken/spinach combo as well. I love adding veggies I might have in my leftovers.

This was good but really rich.  You basically make a cheese sauce in place of marinara.  As some other reviewers stated, I only used about a 1/2 10 oz. package of spinach.  That seemed like plenty.  I can't imagine putting in two packages!  But then I'm not really a spinach person.  I think it would be better with fresh spinach.  All in all, pretty good and it made a ton for hubby and me.

Fabulous! This lasagna is delicious. My partner described it as 'the best dish I'd ever made' and devoured multiple servings of it.   I did follow the advice of other posters and added more cheese than the recipe called for. Specifically, I added an extra layer of mozzarella to the top of the lasagna and let it get all bubbly and gooey and delicious in the oven.  Also, DEFINITELY reduce the amount of spinach the recipe calls for. I put in less than half the spinach that was recommended, and it still bordered on too much.   Tips from other reviewers that I didn't follow, but probably would next time would include making a bit more sauce (the lasagna certainly wasn't dry, but the sauce was so delicious I want more!), and using fresh spinach rather than frozen (I prefer the taste and texture of fresh to frozen). Even without these modifications though, the lasagna was fantastic.  The quantity of basil and oregano called for in the recipe is perfect - it gives the lasagna a wonderful flavour without being overpowering.  I read some reviews that said this recipe was very time-consuming, but that's absolutely untrue. It took me less than 20 minutes to prepare! (not including baking time, of course)  Fantastic!

I'll give this a 5 for now. I love this dish! Instead of making the flour/broth mixture, I had some homemade cream of chicken soup that I made before, used that,just added mozz cheese and parm then did everything else in the recipe exactly, it was SO good and if this is good by making this one small change, imagine people how it is doing it exactly as written!

YUMMY!  This was great.  My  husband actually made this recipe for me because I was coming home late and he did a fabulous job.  He "accidentally" left out the spinach because he didn't know it was in the freezer, however the recipe was awesome without and had a great flavor.  I did ask him to add more ingredients for the sauce and it was perfect.  We used whole wheat noodles and used about 2 cups total less cheese.  It was great!  Thanks.

This recipe was awesome.

The only changes I made were that I added a little more garlic - about 3 cloves.

Also, I used a rotisserie chicken but would probably add a little more chicken than the 2 cups it called for.

Yummy!  I made this for dinner tonight and even one of the pickiest kids ate it.  I added the spinach (I used fresh spinach) in with the cheese mixture as per another reviewer, but I could have better spent the extra 5 minutes to layer it like the recipe said.  Otherwise the taste was great and everyone gobbled it up.  I also boiled the chicken in chicken broth and shredded it (it takes a lot more time but I think it gives it a nice texture) then cooked the lasagna noodles in the chicken broth.  Full of flavour! Will definitely make again!

This recipe was awesome. I made it for a dinner party of 8 people and it was just the right size. I did make a couple of adjustments however. I only used one box of frozen spinach instead of two and I mixed the ricotta and spinach together. Also I added one container of fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce when I added the onions and garlic to the pan. I also added 4 cloves of garlic instead of one. I sauteed the diced chicken breasts in olive oil, cajun seasoning, salt, pepper, and garlic powder to give it some flavor. Overall it was great- everyone at the dinner party asked me for the recipe. I will definitely make this one again. I think 2 boxes of spicach would have been way too much.

Excellent.  I added 1 tsp Dijon mustard and a pinch of cayenne to the sauce.  This added a nice little edge to the sauce.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of white wine for some of the broth.  Great.

I also successfully split this into two 8x8 pans.  I used 12 noodles but that was the only change.

Awesome recipe!!!  I used the "no boil" noodles and cut the mozza back to 2 cups so the sauce had enough water content for the noodles.  I also used half the spinach requirement.  To keep it lighter I used light ricotta.  I also doubled the spices and garlic.  Would definitely make it again. Cheers!

Very good, but rich.  I used cottage cheese (it's what I had on hand) I combined the spinach with the cottage cheese. That made it easy to spread. I also used half the spinach called for.

This was absolutely delicious! Very rich and easy to make. Like another reviewer, I do feel like I used a lot of pans; but that's what my dishwasher is for right? I made two changes: I substituted cream cheese for ricotta and used fresh instead of frozen spinach. I've never been a fan of ricotta so I just placed small cubes of cream cheese on each layer. Yummy! Next I will try adding mushrooms.

Normally I don't write reviews but I think this dish deserved an applause. I did make a few changes based on ingredients I had on hand and the amount of time I had to cook (the moms and or dads out there with children under 1 can relate with me). Changes: red onion instead of white, rotisserie chicken instead of breast (I can get the chicken already cooked from the grocery store and the left overs I used for soup!), substituted 1 cup of mozzarella with 1 cup of pepper jack cheese; to give the dish a little spice. I also added a bit of EasiSpice all purpose seasoning and thyme. All in all this dish  is a new favorite.

This SAUCE for this recipe is wonderful (hence, the 5 star rating); I use it often for various pasta preparations (for example, when I make Ravioli, Rigatoni, or Fettucine). I usually add just a dash of Nutmeg to it -- just to make it a tad more "interesting". For my Vegetable Lasagnas, I use "regular" Lasagna (not pre-cooked) noodles (remember to transfer them to a pot or bowl of cold water once you drain them -- they stick to one another if you don't), a 4-Italian Cheese blend, and I make 1/3rd more Sauce than this recipe calls for. I use fresh Spinach and I include sliced (with a vegetable peeler, then chopped into 3 parts) Carrots and sliced (ditto) Zucchini. Sometimes I also include Mushrooms, sometimes I don't; sometimes I include Chicken (and when I do, sometimes I use pre-cooked boneless thighs instead of breasts and sometimes I use leftovers from a whole roasted chicken), but sometimes I don't. I'm never particular about how I layer (except for the Sauce); I pretty much mix all of my "filling" ingredients together in one large bowl and then I proceed as follows:   (a) Sauce, Noodles, Filling, (b) Noodles, Filling, Sauce, (c) Noodles, Sauce, CHEESE. I let it sit for about 10 minutes (giving the ingredients a chance to "get used to one another"), and then I bake it, covered with aluminum foil, for 30-40 minutes at 350 F. After the 30-40 minutes, I remove the foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes. I let it "rest" for at least 20 minutes before attempting to slice.

Delicious!  I hosted dinner for 28 college athletes tonight and made this, a regular lasagna and stuffed shells.  It turned out fantastic!  I made it per the directions (just a clove more garlic cause I love garlic), and couldn't be happier. It was devoured and it was nice to have something different than just the basic lasagna.  It'll be a regular in our house.

This was a good recipe, but I made a few changes to lighten it up by reducing the butter and both cheeses.  I cut the recipe in half since there are only two of us and it was the perfect size.  I also used the no bake noodles, which I wouldn't recommend since here wasn't enough liquid to cook them through.  It was good, but I'm sure it would have been even better as written.

This is really good! I subbed cooked ravioli for the lasagna noodles and left out the spinach as we do not care for it. Really tasty and different. Great sauce mix and texture for slicing. Holds together well.

This recipe was very delicious.  It was a lot more work than I imagined when I first decided to make it, so I would've allowed for more time for the prep.  I will make it again, though.  Quite tasty.

This recipe is amazing! I did it with a twist; instead of using spinach, I used corn. And i broiled and shredded the chicken. I also used sliced mozz cheese and 3 cups of milk and 1 of the chicken broth it came out really good

Loved this recipe! I did tweak it a bit after reading the reviews. I used the oven ready lasagna noodles.   I added a splash of white wine, 3 cloves of chopped garlic and some grated nutmeg to the bechamel sauce. I also only used one package of spinach. It was plenty! I will definitely be making this again., I served it at a small dinner party and it was a big hit!

I have done this recipe many, many times.  It is always a hit @ Pot lucks & I get many requests to bring to showers, etc.   I follow this recipe to a tee.   
The only bone I have to pick w this recipe is the Prep time.  I DOESNOT take only 25 mins for prep.  ( The video  for this recipe takes 25 mins...lol).  It realistically times out to more like 1 hr for prep time.   
By the time you  boil the noodles, drain them & make your white cheese sauce & brown & cook your chicken & assemble the lasagna...its definetly a 1 hr prep time.  
So be prepared for that prep time.   Is it worth it?   YES....all the compliments are great!!

Fabulous! Very rich. Might cut down on the butter by half and replace some of the ricotta cheese with Greek yogurt next time, though. Delicious!

Loved this recipe, The only thing I changed, I used 500 g of chicken mince fried in a little oil and allowed to cool and two pkts of frozen spinach as I found that 2 cups of chicken and 1 pkt of frozen spinach wasn't enough to cover the lasagne. I had enough left over to freeze into portions for those days or nights when you don't fell like cooking and i serve it with a tossed green salad. It is so yummy and a must for all cooks to try.

Made the chicken in the oven in a covered glass dish with some water in the bottom and lots of Italian seasoning. I scored the chicken and put garlic in the scores - the chicken was fabulous! I ended up using 2 packages of spinach, but I think I will cut it back to one next time. I think I made pretty much the rest of the recipe as written. This is such a great recipe!

I liked it. But next time I will definitely add some more spices and herbs. The family loved it as is, but I was expecting more considering the reviews. Don't get me wrong it was good, just didn't have the WOW factor for me.

Made this for a family gathering of 10 people. It was a hit. I used 12 total noodles instead of 9 and I soaked them in hot tap water for 15 mins before layering them and throwing in the oven. I also mixed the spinach in the ricotta mixture (and added an egg to the mix). Very yummy!

I was excited to try this, as I'm not much of a red sauce lasagna fan, however, this wasn't quite as good as I was expecting. As written, I would've imagined a very bland outcome, so I decided beforehand to take the following liberties with this recipe in order to spruce up the flavor: I used my crockpot to cook the chicken (I used a 1lb pkg of boneless, skinless thighs) that I shredded and seasoned to taste. I also used a 10 oz bag of fresh baby spinach, de-stemmed and finely chopped (I wouldn't dream of using frozen or canned spinach, blech!) I used a 15 oz container of part-skim ricotta and added freshly ground pepper, salt, garlic/onion powders and basil. I didn't add an egg to the ricotta mixture, though I would in the future. I seasoned the sauce to taste as well, omitting the oregano (don't care for it) and doubling the basil. I combined the chicken, ricotta and spinach to make layering easier. I also chopped up a roma tomato and added some real bacon bits to the layers. I used oven-ready noodles and baked an hour to ensure it was fully cooked. I loosely covered my lasagna with foil all but the last 10 minutes and broiled the last two minutes to get a good, light browning on the top. I was expecting more sauce, however, that's a personal preference and an easy fix for next time with some tweaking. I do like the idea of a white sauce lasagna, so I'll attempt this one again.

The only thing I did differently was using ready to bake lasagna noodles instead of the regular noodles. Besides that I followed the recipe to the T and it was Superb! Made it for guests and two of them asked for the recipe!

Hands down, best lasagna I have ever had! Thanks for sharing!

Oh my!  This is fantastic!  I changed a few things based on personal taste.  I used uncooked lasagna noodles and they cooked perfectly in the sauce.  I added about 4 cloves of garlic and substitued Sargento's 6-cheese Italian blend for the mozzarella.  I used 1 9 oz bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I also used fresh basil instead of dried...the flavor is so much better.  I also eliminated the oregano...just my personal preference.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as far as the the quantities and layering and it turned out perfectly!  I never cook the noodles in advance for any lasagna recipe.  I personally think by precooking and then baking, the noodles end up being overcooked and a little on the mushy side.  Besides, by not cooking, it saves time as well!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe...it will go in with my favorites!

This is one of the first recipies I ever tried from this site & it is WONDERFUL!! I've made this on Christmas Eve, for my boyfriend's parents, parties, etc. and it's always a big hit. It's a great alternative for people with acid reflux or GERD whom traditional lasagna isn't an option. I didn't change a thing from this recipie, except I do omit the garlic and use garlic power instead. Thank you Lisa for this GREAT recipie!!!

RESTAURANT QUALITY!!! This was DELICIOUS!! I cut the recipe in half so I used an 8x8 instead.  Like another reviewer, I accidentally added all of the mozzarella to the sauce mixture but it turned out fine!  I did add a little extra chicken broth because I used no boil noodles.  I didn't measure the ricotta, I just spread it onto the noodles before setting them down! I used a lot less spinach...just eyeballed it.  But wow, both my hubby and I loved it!

I made this again and it turned out even better using the regular noodles!  I just boiled them first while cooking the chicken.  I added some extra mozzarella in between one of the layers.  YUM!  I've shared this recipe with friends who have loved it also!  I can't wait to make the sauce and use it in/on other things.

This is such a delicious filling meal.  I make this for my husband (who "hates" spinach, by the way) and me and it tastes awesome fresh or reheated.  After first trying this, I made a couple of minor adjustments. Basically, I added the cheese sauce to the chicken and spinach to use as one layer.  I also added mushrooms when cooking the onions, as we love mushrooms.  MMMMmmmm....I'm getting hungry just writing this review!!

I didn't add Spinach and I'm not sure if that's the reason it fell apart but my husband liked it.  It had an intersting taste.  I also added white wine to the sauce and I made the mistake of adding the cheese to the sauce.  I need to make this again and tweek it for a better rating.

There was nothing wrong with this!! I'm not always a huge fan of spinach, but this was great! Would add a little more garlic next time just for kicks, and season the chicken while cooking as well. Great recipe!

This was great!  I used fresh spinach, low fat ricotta, organic broth, vegi's and herbs and no boil lasagna noodles.  I also added mushrooms in with the onions and garlic.  Did not really add to or take away from anything.  My partner loved it as well.  Can't wait for left-overs tomorrow.

I made this more as a layered ziti dish, because I did not have lasagna noodles.  I thought the taste was good, but the white sauce got a bit thick and goopy.

wow, what a great dish! very tasty and much simpler to make than i expected.  I did reduce the mozzarella to 2 1/2 cups to reduce the richness (and calories) and honestly didn't miss it. I added double the basil and probably about 5 cloves of garlic (we love the stuff) and used a mix of spinach and steamed kale.  To make the layering easier i too mixed the greens, chicken and ricotta (oh and i used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese).  the changes  i made were minor and overall the recipe is great!

I thought it was ok...I actually prefer the red lasagna.  My boyfriend's father loved it!  The cheese sauce is delicious and I would like to try to make just the cheese sauce for other dishes.

I made this last night for a dinner party and I would just say it was ok. I personally thought it was pretty bland and time consuming. I will not be making this again.

This was great, looking forward to making it again. It made the perfect amount of sauce, which was very tasty and had a nice flavor. I used FF ricotta and reduced fat cheeses & butter. I used canned spinach because it was all I could find, and I will definitely not do that again. I'm not a huge spinach fan to begin with, but anything would be better than canned!

I tried this one, followed the recipe, and thought it was a solid "OK". Just like any other chicken lasagna recipe. Needs more flavor. Lacked the "WOW" effect I was looking for. Not worth the time & money. Leftovers sat in the fridge. Sorry it didn't work out

This is very good. I didn't add or omit any ingredients but I did adjust amounts here and there. I also marinated my chicken breasts in Zesty Italian dressing overnight, grilled them, and then sliced them. I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen spinach but will probably add less than that next time just to suit our tastes. Also, I will probably make it in a larger pan next time. It filled the 9x13 to the brim! I put a baking sheet on the rack under it in the oven. I will probably only make this a couple of times a year but, boy, will I look forward to those times!

This is delicious! Lot's of cheese, but worth it. I have made it twice. Making it with preshredded mozzarella (which is finer than freshly grated) worked better. Also, you may need a few extra lasagna strips depending on the size of your lasagna pan. This is our new favorite lasagna!

Delicious!  My only issue (user error, of  course) is that I made two 9x9 pans so I could freeze one for later, and all the measurements were off -- not enough noodles and too much of everything else.  I'll adjust the measurements and layers accordingly next time.  Will leave out the ricotta, too, just for personal preference -- plenty cheesy without it.  I also added sun-dried tomatoes.  Can't wait to eat the second pan now!

I followed advice and changed the cheese to Italian 5 cheese - doubled up on the spices and used no-cook noodles.  I also used fresh spinach and added mushrooms.  I found it not to be Exceptionally great, but it was a crowd pleaser and there wasn't any left.

I rarely review recipes, but this was so good, I had to say so. We absolutely LOVED this recipe. It was incredible when I made it last night for dinner and even yummier today as leftovers for lunch. I will most certainly be making it again. The only changes I made to it were to use turkey instead of chicken and fresh spinach, since that's what I had on hand.

The only thing I change is using cottage cheese instead of ricotta, it's cheaper, healthier and creamier.

I agree with some of the other reviewers - 2-10oz. packages of spinach was WAY too much.  Other than that, it was pretty good and I'll make it again - just with 1 package of spinach next time.

This is amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used 1 bag of FRESH chopped spinach and TWO large cloves of garlic (I love garlic). I'm guessing this will be better tomorrow, but I couldn't wait to eat it, it smells so good!

I used Paul Newman's Alfredo sauce and no-cook noodles to cut down on the prep time and it turned out delicious. At dinner I told my husband that I thought this was good and he responded, "it's very good." That makes it a keeper.

This part of the recipe is KILLER if you set it aside then use it to pour over fetucchini noodles and chicken. The best!   **Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the butter until tender, stirring frequently. Stir in the flour and salt, and simmer until bubbly. Mix in the broth and milk, and boil, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Stir in 2 cups mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Season with the basil, oregano, and ground black pepper. Remove from heat, and set aside.

Great Easy Recipe! Considered other reviewer's comments and made the following changes: Used 8x8 pan but did not decrease any of the ingredients, used 1 package of frozen spinach, did not use ricotta or cottage cheese, and used rotissere chicken from Publix. My boyfriend loved it and told me it was a "repeat" and did not want me to change 1 thing.

Definitely too much spinach when you go with two packages.  The sauce is very good and very rich, might try it on other pasta.  Otherwise just too much cheese (never thought I'd say that) and too little flavor.

I really liked this recipe! I think it could use a little twirking here and there. I used no-bake noodles. Extra mozzarella. and Parmesan cheese.   BUT next time ill add more chicken, less spinach and liquids (a bit runny), and more ricotta :)

Fantastically delicious. I had some chicken lying around and the rest was a breeze to put together. Don't worry if you don't *quite* have enough liquids for the sauce. I think if there is anything to change, i would scale back on the sauce. And as other reviewers have said, white wine works as a fine substitute for some chicken broth. Overall, great recipe, got rave reviews from those eating it and I will make it again.

I made this last night and it was very good.  It is a keeper!  I didn't have any spinach as I had used it the other night, and I had to substitute the type cheeses, I used provolone and parmesan, it was still yummy.  For thoses who thinks it is too bland, they need to know how to spice it up and give it their personal tweak!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I liked this, but I found it to be a little bland.  As my boyfriend described it, it was like macaroni and cheese with chicken.  We both expected a little more from this dish; I would add more garlic and herbs for flavor.  I also used one package of ground chicken instead of shredded chicken; after it was cooked I had about 2 1/3 cups, a little extra but I used it in the lasagna.  I got every dish in my kitchen dirty trying to make this, haha! I would make this again but it won't be something I regularly make; I'll probably use it as a substitute for regular lasagna maybe once every year or two, as my boyfriend suggested. A helpful suggestion I read was to mince the onions really fine; I did, and the texture was much nicer than if I had decided to "chop" the onions.  Also, I had to let the dish sit for around 20 minutes to thicken before serving.

This was a very delicious lasagna, which I knew it would be reading through the ingredients listed. I did change a few things: I cooked the chicken pieces in butter along with onion and garlic (more flavorful). I added chopped mushrooms to the separate onion and garlic saute (for the sauce). I used fresh basil when called for. I also used fresh, chopped spinach and mixed it in with the Ricotta cheese. I have to be very confident in a recipe when trying it out for the first time with company. This one did not disappoint.

Absolutely delicious! I was a little nervous in the beginning but that cheesy white sauce really pulls this together! I, like other reviewers, used more garlic, less spinach and mixed the spinach, chicken and ricotta cheese together before hand. I used 3/4 of the amount of spinach that the recipe called for but next time I think I will cut it down to half and only use (1) 10 ounce bag of spinach. Awesome recipe - Thanks for sharing!

This lasagna has an excellent flavor but the recipe was short on sauce.  I had to keep adding milk and broth to have enough.  The  ricotta was hard to spread.  I am making again with shrimp as a substitute and am going to process the ricotta with a very small amount  of the broth and milk to make spreading easier.  The recipe makes two 9x9 pans which I did..  Great for small familes.  Just freeze.

This was very delicious and very rich. Everyone LOVED it! I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, only 1 pkg of spinach as recommended by others, doubled the chicken and added mozz cheese on top. I used no cook noodles for the first time because I made 2 different lasagnas and wanted to save time. They were ok, but next time, I'll precook. Other than these changes, I followed the recipe and the sauce was very creamy and yummy!  Thanks Lisa!  This is a keeper!

WOW!  I didn't know I had it in me to make such an excellent sauce from scratch.  Everything about this recipe came out perfect: perfect presentation, perfect taste, and most importantly it was perfectly appreciated by everyone.  I almost substituted swiss chard instead of the spinach, but used fresh spinach, oregano, basil, and parsley.  I also threw in fresh mushrooms and wished I'd thrown in some red bell pepper, too.  Next time.  There will be MANY, MANY NEXT TIMES!

Very good! Taste the sauce when it is done cooking. This is where the flavor comes from. If it needs salt/garlic...etc, add it towards the end. I did not and it really needed some salt.

Fabulous! For those who said it's a lot of work, you can make essentially the same recipe with another type of pasta (I used penne) and just mix it all up. No need to use lasagna noodles and all that layering. The taste is just as wonderful.

My husband and I love this recipe!  We omited the spinach because we are babies about the way spinach tastes.  It helps if you have an extra hand in the kitchen when you make this, or have the ingredients measured before you start.  I can't wait to share it with others!

This is an excellent recipe I have been making for some time now.  I use no-cook noodles to save time.  To keep from drying out, I make extra sauce (add an extra tablespoon of flour or so and adjust broth/milk/cheese).  Also, I prefer to shred the chicken which gives this recipe really great texture. This is a definite keeper in our house.

I thought this was pretty good. I made one for my family and then the next day, made it for a friend who just had a baby, with a few improvements. First, I used the whole package of lasagna noodles to make 3 layers. Second, I disregarded the original assembly instructions and layered like this: sauce, noodles, ricotta, chicken, spinach, cheese...repeat. Also, the first attempt was a little dry in places, so I made a little more of the white sauce and mixed it in with the ricotta to add moisture. I also used one 16-oz package of frozen spinach for 2 lasagnas. Good recipe, will make again!

I always have frozen, roasted chicken my freezer.Great to defrost and toss in a salad-quesadilla, this lasagna. So mine came together quickly.  Could also use a roasted chicken from the deli to save time.  Excellent recipe.  Agree-needs more garlic.  I used three cloves.  I did one cup of milk and one half cup of 1/2 and 1/2.  Also, can definitely mix the washed and dried spinach with the chicken and add to the sauce.  Kind of eliminates the layering which isn't noticeable and saves time, too.  Great recipe, a sure keeper!

I have made this for several years now and we love it!  The only change I make is to use fresh baby spinach.  I also changed the layers around a little to our liking.  This recipes does take a long time to prepare, but the end result is worth it!  It reheats really well also.

Wow, that was time consuming!  It was excellent but it was a lot of steps and dirtied a lot of dishes.  Next time I'll try to figure out a way to cut a few corners.  Very good though.

Excellent!  I used 2 cups of homemade chix. broth, LOTS of garlic, Italian seasoning, and whole wheat flour.  I also used fresh spinach, only had 1 cup of ricotta cheese, and substituted 1 cup of the milk with heavy cream.  My family ate it up!  Thanks for sharing!

This lasagne is absolutely delicious. I also used 1/2 lb. crumbled bacon and added it to the ricotta cheese. I cooked the chicken in the bacon grease. My husband and brother could not believe how great is was. thanks

I've just started to cook, and this recipe was really easy for me!!  I did substitute roasted veggie broth for chicken broth and did not use chicken.  Instead for the chicken layer - I used a bag of thawed mixed veggies chopped up, broccoli, carrots and cauliflower!  I loved it!

I used half the spinach and would agree with others to mix the riccotta like you would in classic lasgna with mozzarella and parmesan and a little oregano and salt.  I cooked 2 chicken breast with a McCormick Hot Taco Seasoning packet in the Crockpot with about 1 cup of water while at work to be ready to come home to.  The seasoned chicken kicked it up for alot more flavor.  Would recommend using some kind of season for the chicken.

This was way too intense for my family's liking.  The sauce wasn't juicy it was very thick- too dry for lasagna.  After all the work and expense of making this I wanted to throw up.  Maybe try with cottage cheese instead of ricotta and who knows what else.  The sauce itself wasn't too bad.  Just thick and cheesy!!!!

My family loved this lasagna, made with several altertions.  I used one package of spinach and it was plenty.  Instead of basil and oregano, i used 1 tsp each of tarragon and rosemary(spices used in another recipe I found). I'm glad I did.  It was fabulous. Will definately make this again.

This is by far the best recipe I have had for white lasagna! It has become our new "favorite"!  Awesome flavor and very easy to double so you can have leftovers or for inviting a family over to share it with!  I can't say enough about it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very good recipe! I used twice as much garlic as called for and used 12 noodles instead of 9 and even that was a little skimpy. Make sure you season to taste!

I have made similar versions of this before and this one was very good. I actually skipped the spinach and I did a layer of pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes mixed in with the chicken. It gives a sweet and crunchy flavor. Thanks!

Great recipe...my husband and his mom were impressed. I will definitely be making this again. I did use cottage cheese instead, but I do that with all lasagna recipes because I just don't like ricotta. Excellent though!

I thought this was great!  I did read some of the other reviews and decided to only use one package of spinach.  I did use 4 cloves of garlic and it was not too strong.  I added the bacon in the sauce too, and cooked my chicken in the bacon grease.  Everything is better with bacon!!  I did make one pan without spinach and it definitely was missed.  I will make this recipe again soon.

This is a nice change from the typical lasagna.  My husband loved this and I thought it was ok.  I'm not a big fan of onions, I think next time I'll either omit the onions or cut them even smaller.  I added fresh sliced mushrooms, and used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I probably will be making this again.  Thanks Lisa for sharing!

Great recipe!  I added one extra clove of garlic -- I am sure it would have been fine with just one as the recipe suggests, but it was very good with two.

When I serve this I keep printed recipes on hand. I know someone will ask me for it. It uses homemade cheese sauce instead of canned soups. I try to avoid the MSG in these soups so it is more than 5 stars in my book.

This recipe is a keeper. I added fresh mushrooms, green and red pepper chopped, a can of cream of mushroom soup and eggs to the ricotta cheese. I also cooked lasagna noodles first! Very, very, good.....I'll definitely make this one again......

I made this for friends and everyone loved it. That was a month ago and they are still raving about it.
The only thing that I did differently was add more garlic. My 92 year old aunt who I freeze dinners for also enjoyed it. No one minded that it was a bit runny. Maybe it was the fresh spinach that I used.

This recipe was awesome!!!  I was worried because I used the no cook lasagna noodles - but it came out perfect. I covered it in foil, and removed it letting it cook 5 minutes with no cover.   I also mixed the chicken, spinach and ricotta together to make it easier to spread.  Even my picky teenager who dislikes everything asked for a second helping.  Definitely a keeper!!

For me, this wasn't that great. This COULD be turned into something really good to suit one's personal tastes. However, as is, it's really heavy. The sauce has way too much flour and there is too much cheese. The directions should actually advise one to cook the flour until it's golden brown, much like a rue. Otherwise, it tastes floury. Overall, this is pretty bland and rich (in a bad way).

This was a hit in our house!! I thought I'd end up doing something else for my  pasta hating daughter. But, we told her to  at least try it, Her first comment was "this is delicious". Few mins later she says "look, I ate it all, that's how yummy it was!" 

The inside still seemed a bit juicy after 40 mins so I covered it with foil and cooked it for 7 more mins. It was done at 40 mins, but my husband doesn't like juicy  so I decided to cook longer as I had the time

I made this the other day and it turned out great.  The changes I made to it:

I made the white sauce with milk only, so it was quite a bit thicker than the printed recipe's version.  I like lasagna to hold together when it's removed from the pan.

I added sauteed mushrooms along with the spinach to bump up the vegetables.

I used a store-bought rotisserie chicken and cut the breast met up into much smaller pieces than the printed recipe recommends.  I wanted every bite of the lasagna to have chicken.

I cut the entire recipe in half.  I'm a single guy and recipes meant for 6-8 people are way too large, even if I am freezing left-overs.

I added mushrooms to the chicken layer and added bacon to the spinach layer. I didn't have enough mozz so I used 1 1/2 cups of Sargento 6-cheese Italian and skipped the parm. Yum!

Love this recipe! I make it at least once a month. It's easily five stars as-is, though I admit to putting more mozzarella and parmesan in it than the recipe calls for.

Very good recipe. I added shredded carrots to the sauce, which came out very good. I feel like it lacks flavor, so next time I would add more spices, maybe paprika.

I am always searching new recipes to try, and this one did not disappoint!! I tweaked the recipe after reading the comments stating it was too runny. I only used a cup of chicken broth, however, I could have used a half cup. This was truly a very creamy, alternative to the plain ole marinara sauce lasagna. LOVE IT and WILL DEFINITELY FIX AGAIN!!!

Thanks for Sharing!

This is a delicious lasagna but it is really heavy so probably not something you want to make too often.
I made a few changes-
I seasoned the chicken with some garlic, paprika, salt, black pepper and all spice to give it some more flavour. 
I used no boil lasagna so I did take the suggestion to add an extra 1/2 cup of milk ( also added 1/2 cup of whipping cream)to the bechamel sauce and it was not too saucy at all! I also added 1/2 cup more parmesan and a little nutmeg for flavour. 
I sautéed onions, mushrooms and spinach with olive oil and garlic and added that together as a layer instead of the plain frozen spinach. It was very delicious!
I will definitely be making this many more times in the future.

Very good, my family loved it.  I used shredded chicken instead of cubed and fresh spinach instead of frozen.  A little labor intensive but I find that typical of lasagna.

Absolutely delicious! Huge hit with everyone. I am a cheese fanatic, and this definitely met my expectations! The only thing I did different was that I bought a cooked rotisserie chicken breast, used oven-ready lasagna, and added some more cheese. Came out great!

I halved the sauce and mixed the ricotta, spinach and chicken together and made manicotti. Also added an egg to filling. This made about nine in a 9 x 13 pan and it was so good!

DANG THIS RECIPE; This could cost me in extra pounds....What a wonderful recipe. I did some normal swap outs (whole wheat penne, cottage cheese, spinach, chicken thighs) and it was still crazy wonderful.  I froze half of it so that I would not eat it all and I will update if that creates a problem.  thanks for a great recipe..I think.
Sept 2015 update... I ate the last portion of the frozen lasagna and it was sssssstillll wooooonderful. I defrosted it in the mic. added some milk to thin it a bit and it heated up well.  Really a wonderful recipe.

I liked it, and yet my family kept giving suggestions to give it just a little more flavor (Italian sausage, green chili salsa, etc).  A little disappointed given the rating but thanks for sharing.

I love love love loooooove the sauce and flavor of it all but have to admit that it was a little too cheesy for my family... Also I incorporated zucchini, carrots into the 2nd layer.  I didn't use this recipe specifically but from a blog called TastyKitchen. I wanted to rate it on this site though since I use it more anyway...

Thank you for such a delish recipe!

This turned out delicious on my first attempt! I took a chance that it would be good and doubled most ingredients in the recipe to make 2 9×13 pans. I'm so happy I did! I boiled my chicken breast with bay leaves and bouillon cubes for flavor. Then made a separate chix broth with bouillon cubes bay leaves and the spices. I also sautéd my spinach with garlic & olive oil then removed and sauted the onions and garlic in more olive oil in the same pan. I also used more cheese and skim milk and added some fresh basil to my spinach which I mixed with the ricotta. I also added an egg to the ricotta mix which is what I do for standard lasagna.  I baked both trays covered in foil for 1hr then removed it and let them cook 15 min more. Then let it sit for 20min before cutting.
This was so tasty and satisfying. Great combination of flavors! I will absolutely make this again. Thank you Lisa!!

This is the best white lasagna I've ever made and I have tried many!  Easy and fantastic! I used oven ready noodles and increased my time by 15 mins and it was perfect.  I thawed two packages of spinach but only used one and half of the spinach. Everyone loved it, even my picky teenagers.

We loved this recipe !! The only thing I added was mushrooms,  and used fresh spinach.. I bought a rotisserie chicken, just to make it easier and I bought wheat lasagna noodles, then put it all together and  heated in the microwave.  This is on my top 10 recipes... Yummy!!!

This dish is hands down my favorite meal to make. I've also used the sauce to make mac and cheese too. Its super rich and Delicious! I use the kraft mixed italian cheese and don't use ricotta and just buy a roasted chicken at the grocery store. So good!

Yum yum! I added a couple tablespoons of pesto sauce while stir-frying my chicken in olive oil. I reduced the recipe by half and it was plenty for our family of four. Will definitely be making this again!

I thought this was very good for being not a huge fan of lasagna. I didn't use as much of the ricotta or the spinach as required. I did use an italian cheese blend instead of mozzarella.

Absolutely YUMMY! Even my pickiest eater loved it. Tweaked a little - more garlic, fresh spinach, chopped chicken in the food processor, nutmeg in the sauce, a little extra cheese. Making this for the next family function for sure!

Overall tasty but I think 20 oz of spinach might be a little too much. Also, the instructions on layering could be better... if it calls for the entire amount of the riccotta and chicken etc, might be good to have an "all" in front of those ingredients. I made the mistake of only adding 1/3 of riccotta and 1/3 of chicken... bummer, but oh well... live and learn!

I made this for dinner the other night.  After reading the reviews,  I also decided to omit 1 box of frozen spinach.  Glad I did.  If you do not LOVE spinach, and its just OK,  then 1 box is plenty.  We were very pleasantly surprised with the outcome!!  Very,  very YUMMY!!!  I highly recommend this recipe!

AMAAAZING LASAGNA!! This recipe gives the classic lasagna for its money. Creamy, thick, spinach and tons of chicken. Exactly what a lasagna should be. My family can never live without this.

(It's usually gone within a day!!)

This was amazing!!! I was so leary making a chicken based lasagna since we're hearty red meat lasagna lovers, but... this one blew us away!
I used Italian blend shredded cheese. One 500 gram container of Ricotta and half a 500 gram container of cottage cheese. Awesome!! Thank you for sharing this one!

I have made this recipe twice now and it is a HUGE hit.  I have 3 boys between 9 and 3 and they all love it.  I use broccoli instead of spinach but other than that I follow the recipe to a tee!!

Loved it, loved it, loved it. I probably added some extra garlic and basil or something but a fantastic change of pace.

I will never make  regular lasagna again! This was epic! I made a few changes. I sauteed the chicken with onions, olive oil and garlic. Also I added artichokes. Next time I will also add black olives. The flavor and texture of this lasagna is amazing. This will become a regular in my household.

We really like this!  Changes made were: I used no-boil noodles, so added an extra 3/4 c. of chicken broth and about an extra half cup of milk to accommodate the liquid for the noodles.  I used the leftover meat from a rotisserie chicken (so it was fairly well seasoned to begin with), and boosted the garlic to 4 cloves.  I added 2 eggs to the ricotta, as I always do with lasagne, and mixed in the thawed spinach, the mozzarella and the parmesan just to make the layering easier.  Next time I will definitely use fresh spinach and saute it first, but didn't have any on hand this time.  I followed the directions from the back of the lasagne noodle box for baking - 375 degrees, covered with foil, for about 55 minutes, followed by 5 minutes uncovered, and then 15 minutes stand time before cutting.  Very rich meal, so half of it is going in the freezer!  One other thing:  This OVERFILLS a 13 x 9 glass baking dish, so either find something deeper or be prepared with foil on the bottom of the oven!!!!!

This was really creamy and rich and turned out beautifully. Although my husband and I really enjoyed this, there was something missing for me. It was kind of blah. I feel like it needed something to punch it up. I wish I could figure out what it needed. For all the time and dishes I dirtied for the result, I may put this one on the back burner.

Made this the other night for the family. I followed what other reviewers said and used less spinach and it was so yummy! The sauce is soo good I can already picture it poured over some chicken breasts or as the base for a creamed spinach. Thanks for the great recipe!

Since my daughter can't eat tomatoes that often (citrus allergy), I have to come up with other ways to cook quick meals. I really wanted lasagna and this was perfect. It was very easy to make.  I bought rotisserie chicken from the grocery store instead of cooking it myself.  I also added eggplant.  Everything else I did as the directions required.

I use olive oil instead of butter, and add in a can of sliced baby bella mushrooms.  This is a nice alternative to traditional lasanga, perfect with a side salad!

It is in the oven and I am already salavating over it! I did mine different. Used all the same ingredients but I shredded my chicken, put a basil garlic marinara sauce on the bottom of the pan then rolled them into lasagna roll ups instead of the whole layering part!

This is very rich, but very good also.  My husband hates spinach so that was his gripe about this one.  (and I only used 1 package, 2 would have been an overkill).  I found that I needed more lasagna noodles than called for.  In a 9X13 pan, I could fit 4 noodles across and then tear one in half to cover the end, so maybe next time Ill just cook the whole box rather than running out of noodles again.

So, this recipe was a little difficult because everything cooked faster than I could keep up.  I also forgot to buy spinach at the grocery store so I left that out. (I added more chicken to make up for the lack of spinach).  It turned out to be very delicious and something that is also just as good as leftovers.  Definitely making this one again (probably with the spinach next time) :)

Very tasty.  I cut the recipe in half.  I cooked my chicken breasts  in a low cooker with banana peppers and onionsoup mix the day before and then shredded it.  I used fat-free ricotta and mozzarella cheese.  I also reduced the amount of spinach.  Will make again!

My 13 year old insists that he hates lasagna, but I was craving it - so I made this instead - it was perfect!  I cut the recipe in half since there were only 3 of us (I just broke the lasagna noodles in half prior to cooking and used an 8x8 square casserole dish). Other than that the only thing I changed was to only use 1/2 a package of the spinach.  I'm not a huge spinach fan and tend to find the flavor overwhelming.  I might use fresh spinach leaves if I made it again and that might make a difference too.  But that's just a personal preference - other than that - I followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit!

We followed the recipe as stated, and the noodles were gummy, the sauce was entirely too rich, and the spinach was slimy.

I made this for a group of about 10 hungry college students, and they all loved it! I doubled the recipe, but I used only 1 bag of spinach and much more garlic, and a lot less ricotta cause I was running short.  My baking pan was a bit deep so the sauce wasn't quite enough, but it still turned out really well! And you can definitely cut down on the cheese if you want to save on calories.

Good, but not great for some reason.  The boyfriend agreed.  I might try this again with a more traditional Alfredo sauce - Parmesan cheese, butter, parsley, heavy cream, and garlic; no milk, flour, or chicken broth.

This is really good! My rating is mostly for the sauce since I made that as per the recipe (just scaled back a bit). I didn't have lasagna noodles so I made it baked ziti-style with rotini. I cut way back on the mozzarella in the sauce to save on fat and sprinkled it on the top layer only, not in between. I would have preferred this with fresh spinach I think, or I just didn't drain the frozen stuff enough (what IS the trick to that??) because it got watery, especially the leftovers. And, in a space cadet moment, I forgot to put the chicken in. So this would be really good as a vegetarian meal! Thanks for sharing the recipe :)

Great taste, but I think next time I'll use 1/2 the mozzarella. It wasn't necessary to have THAT much cheese.

amazing.  not the easiest recipe to put together, but just follow the directions.  Also, it freezes nicely--we made it to take to a friends house, just thaw it completely before baking (and add a little time).  Also, i only used one box of the spinach and it was plenty.

Great lasagna! The only thing I will do differently next time is flavor up the chopped chicken, maybe grill it or something, or sautee it with onion and garlic.

Simple and delicious. I used more lasagna noodles and more garlic but this was a hit with my kids and myself. My husband is a red lasagna lover so he wasn't a fan but I will definitely be making this again and again.

Absolutely delish... I used a fresh store bought rotisserie chicken and fresh spinach (2 10 oz. bags) as we LOVE spinach and it was not too much for us.  I first sauteed with a little olive oil & garlic.   Followed the recipe exactly otherwise, including the layers.   It turned out moist & very pretty on our plates :)

I didn't like this. The only part that wasn't bland was the spinach but it was too overpowering for me. Took forever to prep and make. Nice concept but not for me. Cheese sauce could be tweaked some and served with fettuccine maybe but it seemed more like gravy to me.

Great little recipe. What rates a five star rating for me is the desire to cook it again and again.   But this has great flavor and is great for leftovers.

Very good, but a lot of work to make and a lot of calories  I only used one box of spinach.

My favorite lasagna ever. I use a lot more garlic than it calls for though. Also, I mix the spinach and ricotta together with an egg, it holds together very nicely and I prefer it that way. I despise regular lasagna.

This was pretty good, could be a 5 star with several changes though:
1. The chicken turned out overcooked. I recommend slightly under cooking it before baking, or shredding the chicken. I cooked the chicken in a pan with basil, garlic and oregano to avoid the bland tastes others posted about.
2. I thought that the spinach had a weird texture (prob shouldn't of used frozen). Next time I will put the spinach and artichokes *added due to preference* in a blender to puree, then add to the cheese sauce.
3. Since I had no ricotta or cottage cheese (of course), I used feta mixed with cream cheese and a tad of sour cream and YUM! Makes it a little more creamy than ricotta.
With these changes it is FABULOUS! I made mine ahead of time, then refrigerated a few hours while I went to class, turned out great. It also makes a ton and since there's just two of us in my house we had mass amounts of leftovers. So I dipped them in egg and breadcrumbs and fried til crispy, served with ranch and marinara and SO GOOD! Def recommend that :)

This was amazing.  It was a little time consuming but not difficult.  I managed to dirty an incredible amount of pots and pans but it was worth it!  I served this for company with a caprese salad and it got rave reviews, I'm planning to make it again when we have dinner guests in a few weeks.  The only change I made was to add additional fresh garlic because I am a garlic lover.

I have to admit that we skipped the spinach totally in this recipe. I figured if my family saw something green in the middle, they would refuse to eat it. That being said...SOMETHING needs to be added to this in order to cut the richness. I did happen to rough chop a red pepper to layer in...but it wasn't nearly enough. I found the recipe very bland...my husband thought it was decent enough. We may try this again, making sure to add another element of flavor somehow. Thanks for a variety on our lasagna recipes.

Great recipe! I made it for a big party, did a red lasagna too, bit the white got all the complements. I think next time I would shred the chicken, rather than cutting it in cubes. Can't wait to make it again!!

I made this using the exact recipe and it was good but after reading the reviews I feel like I could make it better by adding something with a little more flavor. I really liked the idea of marinated chicken or white wine. Next time I make it I think I will change it a little, but it was pretty good!

Pretty good.  For my taste, I'd use less than half the spinach.  Also, I'd omit or decrease the pepper in it too.  Overall it was good, just a lot of work for something that wasn't incredible.

I didn't have enough spinach, so I added some sauteed fresh mushrooms and peppers. I used preboiled lasagna. It came out a little bit on the dry side, so next time I'll use normal boiled lasagna and cook for less time (since everything you use is already cooked) and/or double the sauce.

Love this recipe! I used no-bake noodles and it turned out just fine. I added some Italian seasoning to the chicken for a little extra flavor, and used a one pound bad of fresh spinach, which I cooked down in a skillet with a little olive oil.

This was very good! We enjoyed it for several meals.
I made my own white sauce and used noodles that you are not suppose to pre boil. I am not completely sure I liked these new noodles but the dish was great and I will make it again.

This was SOOOOO yummy!  The sauce is incredible.  Instead of the chicken, I substituted chopped broccoli, carrots and yellow squash to use up some garden veggies.  My whole family loved it and I will definitely be making it again very soon!

I loved this dish!!! The sauce taste reminded me of my fav dish from Maggiano's Chicken Manicotti. My family couldn't stop eating it and wanted me to make more....I made some changes by adding real bacon bit on top for garnishment, and No Boil Lasagna noodles! (will next time use the boil noodles) 

Other than that this dish will be a repeat offender in my house :)

This was fantastic!  I added one egg and the spices to the ricotta to give it more flavor and used pre-cooked diced chicken breast.  With using no- boil noodles all I had to cook was the sauce which was pretty simple.  Everyone loved this recipe.  We ate the whole pan in one sitting!

This is pretty good, but it is very, very rich.  I followed the recipe to a "T" except for only using one box of spinach and no-boil noodles.  I actually had to sop up oil/butter that pooled on the top during baking.  It was also very salty...the day after the salt was not as noticable, but I would definitely omit the salt next time. Other than that, it was tasty!

Super Good! I changed a few things. I used fresh Spinach it is so much more tender and less chewy. I also used an Italian blend cheese instead of just Mozz.  And added mushrooms to onion and garlic saute.  OMG! Whole family devoured.

uhh, YUM.  This was so good, everyone in the family loved it.  Minor changes - I used homemade lasagna noodles, steamed fresh spinach, and I added pureed zucchini and broccoli.  Didn't have any ricotta so I used cottage cheese.  I mixed the spinach, zucchini and broccoli with the cottage cheese to make layering easier.  I chose not to cook my noodles ahead of time so I added 1/2 c of water to the sauce, but they didn't cook that great in the white sauce (I've had great success not cooking them ahead of time for traditional red sauce lasagna).  Next time I'll cook them ahead of time for sure!  Will be making this again.

I made this last minute for a Sunday lunch and it was AWESOME! We had company over and they loved it too. I didn't have spinach on hand, but will definitely make this again and try it with the Spinach. Very flavorful and looks great. I am pregnant and have not been able to handle tomato sauce, but I am not sure I want to after this dish!

This is one of my favorite lasagnas. I usually buy bone-in chicken and put it in the slow cooker, which yields both the chicken broth and the cooked chicken. I also use whole wheat lasagna noodles (there are so many flavors you can't taste the difference). Finally, I prefer using fresh spinach instead of frozen.

Really great recipe...no need for the salt if you use boulion cubes for the broth like I did. And I actually added in 4 cups of broth because the sauce seemed rather thick without it. I cooked some carrots in the broth with the diced chicken and sauted some mushrooms in with the garlic and onions, as well (used 2 tsp minced garlic.) I did not add the cheese in the sauce- I always just sprinkle in the cheese when layering. I also mixed the spinach and ricotta together into its own mixture and spread in between each layer. You do not need quite as much cheese as this recipe calls for...I probably used about 3 cups total...used a shredded italian blend rather than the mozerella and parmesan. Will definitely make this again.

Based on other reviewers, I decided to add a bit more salt as well as an extra clove of garlic.  I also sauted chicken and wilted fresh spinach in the leftover juices instead of using frozen.  I didn't add as much spinach as the original recipe called for.  Came out great, and very glad I decided to tweak it a bit to my taste or it would have been too bland.  Great, great recipe when adding personal touches.  My kids, my husband as well as myself enjoyed this different take on lasagna.

This was not a fav in our house.  We had tons of leftovers and no one ate them.  In my opinion this recipe called for way too much ricotta and way too much spinach.  I will not make this again.

This was good.  My kids loved it too.  It just took a long time to make.  I think it's more of a weekend dish. Next time I will cook the chicken and shread the cheese the night before.

I made this vegetarian style with 2 heads of broccoli and about a cup of sliced mushrooms. I also added an egg to the ricotta. My boyfriend and I really liked it and I will most likely make it again. I also used no boil lasagna noodles!

I was super excited to make this and eat it, I thought it was good. But then I had left overs and the appeal of it decreased A LOT! My husband loved it I had guest over for dinner that ate it but didn't want seconds. It was alot like a fettucine.

4 1/2 stars!  This was good.  Next time I'll leave out the spinach since the guys didn't like it.  I used a roti chicken and no cook lasagne noodles to cut down on prep time.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  It was a little runny when it first came out of the oven but after it set up it was perfect.  We are both planning on taking leftovers to work tomorrow.  The only thing I plan to change next time is to season the ricotta cheese a little but other then that it was perfect.  Thanks for another great recipe.

Cut butter by less than half.  Used minced onion and garlic powder.  Omit salt.  (Would think about using sauce with spinach over pasta noodles, as with ricotta it was really rich.)  To layer, made a mix of chx, ricotta, spinach, and 1/2 c parmesan, then did noodles, sauce, then chx/cheese mix.  Next time would maybe add white wine as other reviewers mentioned.  I used only 10 oz spinach--was enough.
ETA:  Made this with just the sauce for pasta and it was good.  A little thick, so I may add some extra milk at the end next time.

This recipe was fanatastic, although like other reviewers I would recommend chopping the onions very finely.  I also would let it sit for a bit before serving so it would set up some.  I just don't have the patience.

After reading all the rave reviews, I was highly disapointed.  This WASN't very good. It took a good amount of time to prepare and no one in my family thought it was worth the effort.  Using frozen thawed spinach left water in the bottom of the pan and didnt taste good, plus I thought it called for too much.  I will not make this again

I would have given it two stars but my husband liked it so I bumped it up to 3. I found it to be dry, even though I added extra sauce, and quite bland, even though I added extra garlic and some italian seasoning mix. With all the cheese and butter, I was really surprised at the dryness-I know I didnt overcook it!

this is a wonderful recipe!  i did make a couple of minor changes for time sake.  i mixed the ricotta cheese, spinach and added some chopped portobella mushrooms.  also, used the no-boil lasagna noodles (just added about a half cup more milk to the sauce mix so it didn't turn out dry) covered it with foil and baked it at 375 for 50 min covered and about 10 uncovered for the cheese to brown.  it was a HUGE hit with the hubby and kids!

My only complaint would be that there needs to be a little more sauce.  Also, I think it tasted better the next day leftover, so layering and letting it sit overnight before baking may be a good thing to do.

Personally, I found this recipe way too heavy and salty.  I would have prefered to skip the cheese sauce altogether and just used fresh seasoned ricotta and some shredded mozzarella.  The family, however, liked it a lot...so they will be eating the leftovers.

I thought this was pretty dry.  I made this just a couple of weeks ago. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used shredded zucchini instead of spinach, because I'm not big on cooked spinach.  You would think that with all of the moisture in the zucchini, this would have been a moister dish. (I even covered it with foil when I baked it to keep the moisture in).  I have a version of this that uses ziti and a white sauce with a lot more vegetables, so I will probably not be making this version again.

What an amazing recipe.  I'm a garlic lover, so I added an exrta couple cloves.  I also seasoned the chicken with a little garlic while cooking and used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  So good!  Will definitely be making it again!

This was great.  I used 15 noodles, 1/3 cup butter and 5 cloves of garlic.  We thought it could have used a little more seasoning.  The butter/cheese sauce is amazing!

Great, full flavor, despite its sort of bland color. Instead of the 1/2 cup of butter, I used a couple tablespoons of olive oil and two tablespoons of butter. That was plenty. My husband isn't a big spinach lover, but he really liked this casserole. I'll definitely make this again.

This was ok, but probably won't make it again. We thought it lacked in flavor.  The sauce was rich and looked delicious though.  Maybe I could try more herbs and spaces.

This was very good! I would recommend adding much more garlic to give it more flavor. I used 3 cloves and it still wasn't enough for me (granted I'm a huge garlic fan). I added a bit more cheese and substituted 1/2 the mozzarella cheese for munster to give it more of a kick and used broccoli instead of spinach. It was probably me being a beginner cook but I found that the prep time was closer to an hour rather than the 25 minutes stated here. I will def make this again with those changes.

I used the amount of spinach the recipe called for (fresh leaves from my garden, stems removed) and it was a touch too much spinach for our tastes. The sauce, however...it was heavenly!

I have made this several times now and it always gets rave reviews.  The only change I make is to layer it differently.  I use 2 cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast, shredded.  I then layer it as such until all is used:  sauce, noodles, ricotta, spinach and chicken.

Very good recipe. I tweaked it a little as suggested by other reviewers by adding a little more garlic to cheese mixture. I seasoned then slow baked my chicken covered in the oven so it fell off the bone and used the broth from it. Also, I sauted a little onion, garlic and chopped mushrooms together and mixed with the chicken for easier layering. I cut out most the ricotta to save on the richness. Came out great and got me thinking what a good pizza these ingredients would make.

I made a few changes.  I added 1/2 c asiago cheese to the ricotta (prob didnt need it).  Also, the most important change was to add the spinach to the cheese sauce.  The sauce was really thick, so I added a little extra milk.  The spinach in the sauce made it look better and was one less layer.  My layers were:  cheese & spinach sauce, noodles,  chicken, noodles, ricotta layer, 2 c mozzarella w 1/2 c parmesan, then noodles, sauce, more chicken, noodles, sauce, 1/2 c parmesan and parsley.  Alot of layers.  Kids liked it.

This was an absolutely delicious dish and easy to follow recipe.  I used no bake lasagna noodles and added extra garlic as was suggested by others.  Next time, I plan to use less salt and add extra spinach and try artichokes with the dish.  My family loved this lasagna and I will definitely add this recipe to my line-up!!!

I knew this would be fabulous, so I made it for my co-workers.  Everyone loved it.  My only gripe is (and I'm a pretty experienced cook, people) that it took me about 1.5 hours to get it in the oven! There's a lot of prep work, so if you get the time to do some of it ahead, I highly recommend it.  Also, I doubled the entire recipe for the large crowd and ended up tripling the spices.  It's delish!

No spinach, basil or oregano.  Added 2 two ounce cans of mild green chiles to the sauce.  Next time I'll add a little more heat with one ounce of canned hot jalapenos.

I made this recipe last week and my family loved it!!!! It didn't even make it through the night for leftovers. If you are looking for something different than your average lasagna dish, this is it. The only thing I would change is adding 1 more chicken and 1 more cup of ricotta cheese...we LOOOOOVE cheese. I also used hickory smoked mozzarella for a different taste. It worked. Other than that, everything was perfect. This is amust have recipe. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

This really is as wonderful as reviewed!! I actually thought the sauce was good enough to go directly onto pasta with grilled chicken and may just do so! I did omit the spinach as we do not care for it and it set up just as well without, something I was worried about. To be warned, it is most certainly rich but serving a salad on the side helps with that. Having made many cheese sauces I can say that this one is not nearly as fattening by using he broth and milk instead of cream, something I may consider trying with my other recipes, such as baked mac & cheese.

I made this with a few changes.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and used all mozzarella - no parmesan.  I liked it and my kids ate it, but next time I will cut down on the spinach.  Maybe mix it into the cottage cheese.  It was just such a stark green layer and I used a 16 oz bag instead of 2 10 oz packages.

To me this was *just* okay.  And, it was a lot of work for being just okay.  Nobody else at home liked it at all and everyone was relieved when I said I would just take the leftovers to work.  Bland and not worth the effort.

Made this tonight with a few changes due to what I had on hand. Used 12 noodles, shredded chicken that I had in the freezer from a rotiserie chicken, one package of frozen spinach, added sauted mushrooms and a bit of chopped garlic. Didn't change anything on the sauce and it had great flavor. Was not bland at all. Had guests and we all loved it. Was a bit of work but using the chicken I had made it faster. Thanks!

Very good! I served this for a group last night and everyone really like it. I followed the recommendations of reviewers; added white wine to the sauce, mixed the chicken/ricotta/spinach together, didnt add as much spinach as orignal recipe (only one pack), added more garlic, chopped onion super fine, added more cheese, etc. Many of you may hate me but I still thought it was kind of bland- still 4 star quality! BUT I warmed some marinara sauce in a pan and poured that over each slice before serving and I wouldnt do it any other way! Soo good with some added flavor!!

My husband and I loved this.  He doesn't ordinarily eat spinach, but it is disguised among the noodles and yummy other flavors.  I will be making this again!

Great recipe! Perfect if you need to feed 4 to 5 people. We liked it with hot sauce (tabasco or tapatio)

This tastes fabulous...will use more noodles, and a larger and deeper pan to bake it in.....might also try adding sauteed mushrooms....otherwise very good.

This was simply delicious. The sauce was so good, I put some of it on a piece of bread and ate it like that! I wanted to take a bath in it, it was THAT good. The only thing I might try and "doctor" a bit is the ricotta and chicken layer..it seemed a bit bland in comparison to the rest of the layers...but all in all...cheesy, gooey, deep-down-satisfying meal. I am making it again in a couple of days at my mother in law's house because I think it will impress!  On a side note, I prepared this in the morning, while both of my kids were sleeping or busy, giving me time to myself, and put it in the fridge until the evening...it made dinner time a snap and I was able to relax and enjoy my family while it was cooking. I will do that again for SURE!

Very easy and very worth it!  Everbody loved it even my 2 year old (we told her the spinach was green pasta - otherwise she wouldn't have) and my husband - who eats like a 2 yr old! :)  I'll be adding this to my list of foods I cook often!!! :)

I made this last night for my family.  I did not have butter or chicken and so I left them out.  What I did have was less calories and a happy meal.

Very good. Used half the butter, low fat cheese, and low fat ricotta to cut down on the naughtiness and it still came out great. Will definitely put this in the meal rotation.

Great recipe, I changed a couple of things, mainly the assembly of the sauce and cooking of the chicken.  I also don't rinse my noodles, instead I use a little bit of olive oil to keep them from sticking to each other. For the sauce, I partially cooked the cubed chicken with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then added onions and a half of a head of garlic(crushed), salt, pepper, basil, oregano to finish cooking.  Added the butter, melted, then added 1 1/2 C chicken stock and 1/2 c. white wine to simmer, added the 1 1/2 cups of milk to simmer, stirring often.  I mixed the flour into the mozzarella and parmesan (reggiano of course) , then added it to the simmering mixture on the stove by handfuls stirring constantly.  I assembled the whole concoction as directed, adding black olives with the ricotta cheese and scooping the chicken out of the sauce when needed.  And using fresh spinach (rinsed and wilted on the stove beforehand)  Put it over a cookiesheet for spillage then baked it as directed.   This was delicious!

Made this for New Year's Eve. Fantastic recipe! So excited to find a chicken lasagna that doesn't call for "cream of whatever". Used fresh spinach instead of frozen (bad childhood memories). Also, I had extra rotisserie chicken meat in the freezer, so I used that. Otherwise followed exactly. I didn't find it bland at all, and I'm a salt/pepper-aholic. Be sure to use plain chicken stock instead of low sodium and a good aged parm and blandness won't be a problem. TRY THIS RECIPE! Great for special events when calories aren't a big issue!

This was very good...I made it today, I used chicken breast which I baked earlier with a little salt, pepper, and a bit of lemon juice, it was very moist, and the broth it made was very good, so I used that broth for my sauce...I also used fresh spinach, which I threw in with my onions & garlic when they were almost done....hubby even threw in some chopped cilantro coz we didn't have fresh parsley...I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta coz that's all I had on hand, but I added an egg, parmesan cheese and a bit of the cilantro in....the sauce was soooo rich & creamy, very decadent, hubby loved it, in fact he was dipping a few pieces of chicken in the sauce as I was putting it together...I am SOOO glad  Ifound &  tried this recipe instead of some of the others on the site, it took a bit longer, but I didn't want an alfredo sauce w/either cream of chicken or mushroom soup...very rich & fattening, but very good, and worth all the effort...we served it w/a nice salad and garlic bread...will be making again for special occasions...

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!!!  I used oven-ready lasagna, added an egg and a little salt to the ricotta mixture, and used one 14 oz. pkg. spinach instead of 2 10 oz. pkgs.  I layered exactly as shown, but baked covered for 40 min., then uncovered for another 10 min.  Then let rest for about 10 min. before serving.  It came out perfect!!  The sauce was to die for!  I used skim milk and it was still plenty rich and creamy.  Will definitely make this one again!!

This was great.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta (personal preference), and made this for my boyfriend and his family.  Everyone loved it, even the 16 year old who hates everything. :)  This is definitely a "special occasion" dish, but a keeper!

The recipe was perfect as it was, which is usually rarely the case! The recipe was easy to follow and produced delicious results! I used pulled rotisserie chicken to make it even easier to make. Next time I might try substituting fresh spinach for the frozen kind as another reviewer suggested. Also, I will add more spices next time to make it more flavorful. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Yum! you don't have to boil the lasagna noodles, just leave them sitting in super hot water while you prepare everything else and by the time you need them, they are nice and tender :) I added a beaten egg, some mozzerella and parmesan cheese to the ricotta to give it more of a lasagna taste. i only added one package of spinach and felt like even that was a bit much. wasn't too fond of the spinach so maybe next time i'll add something like broccoli or maybe just the plain chicken. overall though, it was great. my only complaint is that i had a ton of dishes to wash afterwards :)

I am rating this recipe for the idea of a white cheese chicken lasagne.  I will admit that I did not follow the recipe, but took a couple of shortcuts.  First, I bought rotissierie chickens and used the chicken from those.  Second, I purchased Ragu alfredo sauce (3 jars) and used that rather than make my own white sauce.  And finally, I forgot to buy ricotta so I just used additional mozzerella and my family loved it.  I will use this as a regular rotation item in my menu.  Thanks for the recipe.  Oooohhh, one more thing, I did use two boxes of chopped spinach and thought it was perfect.

I make Chicken Alfredo all the time and I needed a little change. This was VERY good. I used a 5 oz pkg of fresh spinach, which I had sautéed in about 1/4 cup of water until wilted. I might use 10 oz next time even though I feel 5 was just fine for me. Cubed two skinless chicken breasts and sautéed in same pan I used for spinach with 2 TBPS butter, minced garlic, and 2 tsp Italian Seasoning. I didn't add the oregano and basil.. only Italian Seasoning.

Definitely rich & yummy! I made a half batch since it was just me & hubs. But, I agree that it's kinda time consuming & uses too many pans. I'll try to streamline it in the future: shredded rotisserie chicken, no boil noodles & pre-shredded cheese would cut down prep time a lot. I'd never skimp on the sauce, though. Soooooo good! The fresh spinach is a must too. I'm not usually a fan, but I couldn't even taste it.

I thought this was just ok.  I think the recipe called for way too much spinach.  One 10 oz. pkg would have been plenty.

Excellent -- delicious!  We felt like it needed a little more zip, so we added ground black pepper and a teaspoon or two of Mrs. Dash and garlic salt, along with the other seasonings.  I used no-bake lasagna noodles from Barilla and fresh baby spinach.  Had great results.  This one is a keeper!

Wonderful recipe.  Quite rich, so make for a treat.  I halved the recipe, served 5 well.  I used less butter, it's already rich enough with all the cheese - used 2 TB for this size.  Use 5 noodles if so, bake in an 8x8 pan.  I used more garlic, 2 TB pesto rather than the oregano basil and parsely, added more spinach and chicken, and added one egg to the ricotta.  Turned out amazing.  For those who like mushrooms they'd also be good added.  Also, I used ground chicken which worked very well.

This recipe is very good well worth all the preparation time it takes to make this.  I did some changes.  I put the chicken, spinach and ricotta cheese and assembled as sauce, noodles and this mixture then last layer mozzeralla cheese and parmesan cheese!! I made the night before!!  Just popped in the oven.  I would also add more cooking time.

Absolutely delicious. I was worried about it being too rich, but it wasn't. The spinach helps keep it grounded. I was also concerned that my sauce wasn't thick enough, but it was just fine and firmed up in the oven.

This lasagna is absolutely delicious! I followed some tips from other people who reviewed the recipe and cut the spinach down to one box and it was just the right amount for our taste. I sauteed the chicken in olive oil, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning to give it a little zing, and it was a good compliment to the dish. I also substituted the basil and oregano for italian seasoning, and the sauce tied in well with the chicken. I also added a beaten egg in with my ricotta to help it hold up better. The only thing I will do differently next time, is mix the spinach with the ricotta cheese to make it blend better. This recipe is definitely worth the work involved in preparing it, and is a good go-to dish when you need to impress company. :)

The Sauce was really good, but this recipe was a little confusing to me. I was not real clear when to add certain ingredients after the first layer. (Ricotta Spinach) Also the spinach needs to be sauted before adding. I don't care for cooked vegetables that are crunchy or chewy. I will not use canned chicken either. My wife loved it though and took a batch to her office. Film at 11

Everything tasted well.  One problem I had- I didn't add all of the spinach, chicken and ricotta at once. I thought the recipe called for layering that.  So after the last noodles were added, I had to go back and stuff the remaining ingredients.  So the only complaint I have is that there was too much spinach.  And since every bite seemed to be a bit spinachy for us all, I think I will go ahead and use 1 box next time.  I also added mushrooms- seemed to work out fine.  I got this idea from a white sauce spinach and mushroom enchillada.  Yum!

I cooked this for my family, and they loved it. I liked it too, and I normally run away screaming from anything that has green in it! For anybody looking to make this, I suggest getting grated/shredded packaged cheese...or else be prepared to be doing a LOT of grating and shredding!

I was a bit sceptical seeing how I've never made a chicken lasagna before and it was my turn to cook a Saturday night dinner for the family, but turns out there was nothing to worry about. 

I took some of the tips from the other reviews - use fresh spinach and cut the stems off and cook it in a pan with oil until bright green; blend the chicken, ricotta and spinach together for easier layering; and use no bake noodles and let them cook with the lasagna. 

My family loved it and it turned out so well they thought that I've cooked it many times before! Highly reccomend!

I was so excited about trying this recipe after I read all the reviews! It sounded amazing! I followed the recipe to a T except for 2 things...I add extra garlic and I only added the one package of Spinach. It really didn't have that much flavor it was kind of bland...all I could taste was the basil and oregano, way to much in my opinion the flavor was overpowering! Also after I added the cheese to the white sauce and removed it from the heat it got a really sandy and gritty texture to it, I stirred and stirred and it didn't help!  I don't know why everyone has given this such great reviews, I couldn't even eat all of my first helping. I deffinetly will not be makeing this again. I think if you cut back on the herbs it might be better.

OMG!!!!!OMG!!!!!OMG!!!! I have to give this recipe a 5 but I have to admit that I had to do a lot of reading to pull that off.  After reading that it turned out bland, Iknew I had to add extra seasoning to it.  I used italian seasoning instead of the individual seasonings called for in the recipe.  I also followed another persons suggestion to marinate the chicken in italian dressing before cooking.  I also added more italian seasoning to my chicken breast while cooking.  This made a major difference with flavor.  I  added a teaspoon of nutmeg, reduced the amount of spinach(which I also seasoned) added  1/2 cup more of milk and used 2cups mozzarella and 2 cups mild cheddar (what I had available) and crumbled 4 slices of turkey bacon.  Let me tell you, I am so proud of the way this recipe turned out, I could kiss myself!  The Hubby loved it and told me that it was better than the one he eats at his favorite italian rest. and I agree.

I didn't have any ricotta so i substituted cottage cheese and i used half the amount of spinach.
I found it very bland and boring.  Will not make again.
It sure sounded good.

This was very good.   The only change I made was adding a dash of nutmeg to the cheese sauce to make it more of an authentic white sauce flavor.  I didn't have just the basil or oregano so I used the italian blend, it's the same thing.  NOTE about the Chicken.  Canned chicken will drastically change the flavor.  If you like the taste of canned chicken you will love it all, if you don't like canned chicken you will taste it most definatley.  I boiled down fresh chicken, and chopped it very fine... It was perfect.  Also, for the riccota cheese, I add some 1/4 cup parm cheese to it and one egg to it.. mix it up and it is fluffier when baked  and much easier to spread. This was a definate do over recipe and I rateit as easy to prepare.  I am going to pre freeze a pan before baking next time for emergencies and quick fixes.

I made this for the second time last night and it was even better than the first time! Both my boyfriend and I loved it!!!! I used more chicken than called for, used a lot more garlic, and added an extra layer of noodles and therefore more cheese. This is a great recipe, the leftovers are even better than the first night! This is a great recipe to make at the beginning of the week so you can eat the leftovers for lunch during the week. This is a great recipe to serve to guests, as everyone who has tried it has said they LOVED it! However, I would plan for more time than they mentioned; the cook time is correct, but the prep time took me a lot longer. This could be due to the fact that I don't think they add cooking the chicken but plan for more time or else you might be eating dinner at 8pm like me. :) Anyway, this deserves all five stars!

I made this for company and they each had 4th helpings!  This was SO good!  Instead of boiling the lasagna noodles, I laid them in a 13x9 and poured boiling water on them to submerge them.  They cooked that way while I put everything else together.  I used chicken bouillon cubes mixed in hot water rather than chicken broth (didn't have any).  The layers were confusing as described, so I did the sauce layer on bottom, then noodles, ricotta, mozzarrella, chicken, spinach, sauce...then repeat.  I sprinkled spinach and parm & mozzarrella on the top of the dish to give it a more colorful look.  FABULOUS!  I will definitely make this again!!!

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly (except used the whole box of lasagna noodles). Agree with others that the sauce would be great ingredient for a white pizza.

WOW!  My family gave this 10/10!  The sauce is outstanding--it would taste good even on cardboard.  I used lowfat cottage cheese in place of the ricotta, and 1 cup of Italian-blend shredded cheese in the sauce, instead of 2 cups of mozzarella.  It was scrumptious.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first review I have left for a recipe, but I just had to let everyone know how wonderful this lasagna is.  It was alot easier to make than I thought and came out PERFECT!!  I followed the recipe to the T.  The only thing I changed was using fresh baby spinach instead of frozen.  My 3 and 5 year old kids loved it and are already asking me to make it again.  You have to try this it is wonderful.

This is my favorite lasagna.  It takes a bit of work, so I seem to make it only about once a year, usually for my son's birthday dinner.  I make it exactly how the recipe is and couldn't imagine changing a thing.  It is just perfect.

Oh my Gosh!  Fantastic!!  Even my husband who doesn't like white sauce or spinach ate seconds. Oh so yummy!  I only made some minor changes because of what I had on hand. 1. Added 3 extra cloves garlic 2. Used fresh basil & oregano from my garden 3. My husband hates ricotta so I used diced Colby/jack cheese 4. Cooked lightly covered with foil, sprayed with oil. Uncovered last 10 minutes THEN topped with last of fresh shredded parmasean cheese. Leftovers were great the next day too!I made a big batch and froze a couple of single servings for later. I defrosted and warmed. It was just as fantastic. Update:  Made this for friends, forgetting I had it and loved it in the past.  Everyone raved.  I changed it slightly due to other reviewers.  I added cooked bacon (some to the inside and some on top) I cut the spinach a bit.  It needs to be cooked way longer than it said to make it really yummy (which is why it's better the next day.)

my husband's first response when he saw dinner last night was "it has spinach in it!" but then once he tasted it, he rated it a 9 out of 10! absolutely delicious! rather than making the sauce, i used Bertolli Alfredo sauce (2 jars). next time i might add some seasonings to the sauce. i also used an italian blend of cheese in my layering and on top. roasted chicken made it much easier and was delicious! i omitted the parsley and used fresh spinach. the dish is even great the next day! next time rather than chopping my mushrooms, i will slice them. i will certainly be making this dish again!

I liked this dish a lot.  My wife, not being a white sauce fan, wasn't quite as happy with it.  I wanted the chicken to have some flavor, so I pounded some chicken breasts to a uniform thickness, sprinkled them with salt and pepper, drizzled them with olive oil, and grilled them just until cooked.  I used a pound and a half of chicken and thought that was too little.  Next time, I'll use almost 3 pounds of chicken for a 9x13 pan.  Lastly, I thought the sauce was an awful lot of work, thanks to how long I had to keep stirring before the broth and milk heated all the way up to boiling.  Next time, I'll preheat them most of the way in the microwave.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  Will make it again.  Poached the chicken in white wine the night before.  I used frozen leaf spinach vs the chopped spinach.  Followed other suggestions and added more garlic but otherwise followed the directions.

This was pretty good.  I had a problem with the white sauce.  Maybe I stirred in the cheese while it was too hot??  It got really grainy.  I was worried about it being fit to eat but added it anyway.  As it turned out, with the texture of the ricotta and spinach, you really couldn't tell.  I'll probably try this again, only experiment with the cheese sauce to get the right consistency.

This recipe is BASICALLY good, however, flour/milk do not exactly have much flavour even when combined with chicken broth was rather bland. Similiar to others comments, I suggest additions such as more fresh garlic, more oregano, some chiles (optional) pesto, sun-dried tomatoes and definitely mushrooms!!! I used brocolli rather than spinach and added some frozen peas to the mixture. A neighbour of mine ran out of milk..and used cream of chicken soup...great idea. 
Topping this with sliced tomatoes sprinkled with pepper really finishes this dish off......lots of room to do your own thing here!!!

Made this recipe for 8 (4 servings now, 4 to freeze) but not much was left unforunatley - I recommend buying a pre-roasted chicken from a fast food store (Red Rooster for example, not sure what they have in the USA - nothing too fatty) for extra flavour (and for working mums) and top with mozzerella and GRILL so you have a nice crunchy topping.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I made some changes, partly due to our personal preferences and partly to add more flavor.  With my changes, my family definitely gave this a 5.  I first sauteed the chopped chicken breast in a little olive oil and Montreal chicken seasoning.  Instead of chopped spinach, I used chopped broccoli since I had it.  I also added two chopped carrots that I precooked a bit in the microwave to soften them.  I did use the whole 2 cups of ricotta cheese, but next time I would use less.  It seemed to make a very heavy layer.  I kept the cheese sauce recipe exactly as it was.  It was quite rich, but very well received.  Definitely a recipe I would make again- when I have the time, because it was quite time consuming.

I made this for a friend of mine after she had her baby and she loved it.  She even froze it and ate it a week later and still loved it.  It didn't all quite fit in one casserole dish so I made a smaller casserole of it with the remaining and kept it for myself.  Very  good stuff!  I think this would be great for kids too.

Delicious!  This dish is extremely rich but oh so worth it.  I like to add mushrooms and a little more spinach but other than that, it's a perfect recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I was skeptical to serve this to my "steak & potatoes" man, but he LOVED it!  I did add mushrooms, but followed the rest of the recipe; however, I am really bad about not measuring... I used a lot more cheese than called for and had to thin the sauce with a little more milk.  It turned out wonderful! Thanks!  This one is a KEEPER!

Truly a beautiful dish and a nice change from the traditional red.  You can impress so many people this way.  I recommend using a good brand of broth to bring out a rich and surprising flavor in the spinach. I cooked it expecting great results and my company raved.  I even served it to my friend Matt who doesn't like anything... he likes bland foods.  Not to say that this is bland.  In fact, it's to say that this recipe impressed the unimpressionable.

I added Asiago cheese to this, added all the mixtures together and stuffed inside manicotti.  EXCELLENT!  Was more of a hit than the traditional lasagna.

After spending a fews days visiting with some friends I prepared this as a dinner suprise.....my hosts LOVED it!!!  

I am a vegetarian, so I substituted a corner of it with faux chicken for me (smile) Either way, I braised my chicken in a broth along with onions, garlic, celery, oregano, sage, salt, pepper and a touch of olive oil. Even if I didnt cook my chicken in that manner, I believe that my hosts would have still been more than pleased.  

Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

Made this for a family gathering, when my sister-in-law and I were trying to outdo the men with a better meal.  This was a GREAT choice!  Everyone loved it, and there was still enough for leftovers (only for a day, though; they went really quickly).  I will have to make this one again over and over, since it was great!  I accidentally used whole spinach instead of chopped, but that didn't affect it at all.

Everybody LOVED this dish!!  It was a bit time consuming to make, because I boiled and shredded the chicken by hand, and also used fresh spinach cooked in olive oil.  I also layered it the way a regular lasagna is layered, this was excellent!  (Round 2)  This time I added an extra clove of garlic, and cut up chicken breasts to saute in a skillet.  I used fresh baby spinach, sauted in a little olive oil in a skillet, then threw in some chopped mushrooms.  I only used one bag of spinach, should have used 2.  What starts out as one big bag, cooks down to only a handful.  Next time I think I will also cut down on the mozzarella.  The lasagna was really good, but the mozzarella cheesiness was a little much for us.  Overall a great dish. (Round 3) Ok. I got a request for this recipe for a group lunch, so I made it again.  I am giving this another star, because I really really liked it this time better than the other times I made it.  I threw the chicken breasts into my George Foreman grill, I used about 14 oz of chopped spinach (frozen, thawed), I added fresh mushrooms to the layers, and I think I did everything else as its written, except for adding some garlic. I also put it together the night before the lunch and it sat in the fridge overnight, maybe that's what did it?  I have no idea, but this lasagna turned out very very yummy.  Served with a crisp mixed salad.

This lasagna was excellent!  I added 2 more cloves of garlic. YUM. My dish was too big so I did 4 noodles per layer and added an extra cup of chicken.  Those who complained it was too runny: either they didn't let the sauce thicken up or they didn't drain the frozen spinach.  The texture was perfect for me.  My boyfriend was absolutely thrilled with it. On the second day, he took one bite of the left overs and called me at work just to tell me again how much he liked it!

Yummy!  Used 3 cups chicken (almost 1.5 pounds raw) instead of 2 (about 1 pound raw). Made it the day before, stored it in the refrigerator, and baked it the next day.

This is a good recipie.  It is very mild- good for picky kids who don't enjoy complex flavors.  The adults liked it but also felt it may be missing something.  Not sure what it may be though.

I used leftover turkey instead of chicken. The sauce tastes like an alfredo sauce so if you're in a hurry I think you could cheat. My husband wouldn't even try this but it was his loss b/c I sent some of this to others in the family and they wanted the recipe. This took about the same amount of time and effort as regular lasagna.

Very good lasagna.  It took a little time to prepare, but it was well worth it.  I made it for a family function and everyone liked it. I mixed about half of the spinach into the ricotta cheese to make it easier to spread.  I also used the no boil noodles which were much easier and came out perfect.

The prep time is definately more than 25 mins even when you use "no-cook" noodles. I would say it took me about 40 mins. and I'm pretty quick. This is the second time I made it and I actually cooked the chicken and cubed it, but the last time I just used chicken in a can and I think it was actually better.  I also used only one package of spinach and I really enjoyed it ... again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty.  I left the spinach out, added more garlic and a bit more chicken.  The whole family loved it.  Next time, I'll probably add a bit more of the mozz cheese, as well as the parm.

This was very good, I was worried about the kids not liking it because of the spinach, but they gobbled it right up. the only things I changed was, I added more garlic, and I used fresh spinach instead of the frozen, This takes some time to put together but very worth it.

Very good, and a nice change of pace from traditional lasagna.  My suggested modifications are to cut back a bit on the oregano and the salt and to increase the garlic. I substituted a bit of grated asiago cheese for some of the parmesan and it added a nice flavor.

I made this tonight for my in-laws and everyone raved and had seconds. I made a few alterations: I reduced some of the mozzarella and added a layer of provolone. I also added more garlic. Next time I would reduce the flour to 1/3 cup to make a slightly thinner sauce. And, I was thinking that some roasted red peppers would make a nice addition.

Good recipe.  I did blend the ricotta in with the sauce however.  Turned out great.

I am going to make next time and use small diced steamed broccolit in place of the spinach.

This is one heavy recipe but it is really good.  Don't make if you are dieting though.  I used brocoli instead of spinach because I have another similar recipe that calls for spinach and I was attempting to be diffrent.  Very good pasta meal!

This recipe was fantastic. I changed it just a little. I also boiled the noodles al dente first. I used 4 noodles per layer, and used canned chicken. I cut the spinach down to 1 10 oz box. I usually dont eat frozen spinach but this was great. Everyone loved it even the kids. Thanks lisa for sharing this recipe.

WONDERFUL! The cream sauce is just as good as the other reviewers said it was... way better than sauces made from canned soups! I decreased the flour to 1/3 cup and used only one package of spinach. I'm going to try a veggie lasagna omitting the chicken and adding broccoli and carrots to the spinach.

My husband does not like "cream of ..." based meals so he loved this white lasagna made without soups. It is really wonderful. Its very rich and great for cheese lovers. I have made it several times and never have any leftovers!!

My husband and I fixed this for dinner when we had his 18 year old nephew over recently. We all really enjoyed it, and his nephew had two HUGE portions! Really good, and a nice change from regular lasagna.

This recipe took a lot longer than I expected but I guess it was worth it.  It was very good and lasted for a few meals! I only used 1 box of spinach and didn't use all the cheese that was recommended.  I'll probably make it again but only when I have a lot of time.

This was a delicious dish.  Instead of the cubed chicken, I added shredded carrots and thinly sliced zucchini.  The sauce was too tasty!  I wasn't sure if the lasagna noodles should be cooked prior to baking, so I just used no-boiled noodles.  It worked out well!

I made this tonight to enjoy with friends and we all loved it! Thanks for the recipe Lisa! My only suggestion if you make it is to be sure that your lasagna noodles are fully covered with sauce; they'll burn if they aren't! Great recipe; Excellent chicken lasagne!

Excellent recipe!  I use one package of spinach and only put it on one side of this dish since my husband is the only one in the family that will eat "green stuff".  Our boys gobble this down, it is soooo good.  The leftovers are also awesome.  You will not be disappointed with this one-try it out tonight!  :)

Great, white lasagna. I used 3 skinless boneless chicken breast cubed small and browned with s/p. I love garlic so I put 6 cloves in. Will definitely make this again.

Super!  It was a great change in routine and my kids (13 and 16) loved it!  Prep time is far more than the original recipe states, but it's worth it....so 5 stars.

This is a very good dish. Loads of flavor and cheese. This was my first time making my own sauce and it came out great. The only problem I had was with the layering and chicken cubes. I would say shred the chicken and lightly salt & pepper it. The chicken and ricotta layer was a sort of jarring absence of flavor and weird texture the way it is set in the current recipe. Everything else was really good and now that I know to make sure the sauce is properly touching the chicken with every bite, it's much better.

This was a hit! Next time I would make more sauce, it was dry, but I did stretch everything out to make 2 lasagnas so I could freeze the extra so that was my fault. I mixed the spinach and ricotta together and next time I would mix the chicken into the sauce to make things easier.

This lasagna was fabulous.  Half of my dinner guests requested seconds.  Followed the recipe exactly,  only change I would make would be to use 1/2 the spinach (only 1 package).  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this!  It was not runny, perhaps because I squeezed all the water out of the spinach. I also let it sit a while before serving.  I boiled the chicken rather than pan frying it and then used the water as the chicken broth in the sauce.

Like others, I made a few changes to this recipe, so my rating isn't on the recipe as written. I added more chicken and didn't use as much spinach as called for. I agree with commenters who used fresh spinach—I would definitely do that next time. It's all a little bland. I might consider adding mushrooms, too.

This sauce was much better than pre-made Alfredo sauce which I've tried in white lasagna before.  Great recipe, a lot of dishes though.  ?? I did only half the spinach.  (Family doesn't love it)

This was very good, I did make changes, using fresh spinach, adding carrots and zucchini, and using fresh herbs, and extra chicken, it does use exactly 9 lasagna noodles. Big hit...definately adding to  rotation.

I doubled the cheese sauce and chicken and 3 more noodles and ricotta,  and took out oregano,  and put in 
Teaspoon of cinnamon.  Yes cinnamon.  It goes great with both spinach and chicken and warms up the recipe in amazing way.  Made it in a lassaya pan.

My teen daughter and her friend love to make this. Super easy for them and its delicious!

once again, I used minced onions instead of chopping one.  I had an issue with getting one lasagna noodle inside of my pot, so I had to break it in half. My sauce didn't look saucy enough for the filling. I only used two noodles, though the noodles came out hard. I would have to try this recipe later this season and redeem myself.

I generally like most things,  but this has way too much cheese, way to much spinach, not enough noodles or chicken. I way kind of disappointed, I may try it again with making adjustments.

Followed recipe exactly. The sauce was good but recipe didn't fit well in a 13x9 pan so it overflowed. I didn't like the way it was layered (all chicken, all spinach, all ricotta). It was pretty watery. I made for a group and didn't get rave reviews. Won't make again without modification.

Very good recipe. We added two layers of zucchini slices as well, and we mixed one egg and parsley in with the ricotta cheese. We layered the filling (pasta strips, ricotta cheese,  chicken slices, sauce, cheese, spinach, and zucchini, repeat). Other than that, we followed the recipe, and really enjoyed it!

It was really good.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  If you can get the Barilla lasagna noodles (Italian product), it works best.

Love this recipe as a jumping off point! I've made it several times and it is a huge hit with a few minor adjustments per personal taste- I always use fresh spinach and have never had an issue with it being watery. I also love to add sliced mushrooms and artichoke hearts in the layers. I have used both a whole chicken pulled apart and boneless skinless chicken breasts w Italian seasoning- just be sure to let the chicken cool if you aren't going to bake it right away. Fresh sliced moz on top really seals the deal. So good!

I have made this for each of my children to have when the new baby came home from the hospital.  It's unanimous - they love it!  Doesn't matter what kind of chicken you use - breast, roasted chicken from the deli, or even canned shredded chicken - all are delicious!  Now I need to make it for my husband and me!

This was so cheesy...in the best way possible! My family really liked this. Being Italian though I have a few minor changes that literally make this go from a work of art to a freaking masterpiece! Tips: 1. Cook an entire box of lasagna noodles. 2. One package of frozen spinach is more than enough 3. Take the ricotta and mix an egg in it with salt, pepper, AND the spinach. 4. Layer as follows: sauce, lasagna noodles, ricotta, sauce, and cheese - repeat: lasagna noodles, ricotta, sauce, and cheese. After all done layering, cover the lasagna with foil and cook for 40 minutes, then take the foil off and cook for another 10 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and brown. (The only other thing that would make this that much more is make it the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. ) Poof it's amazeballs!

My sauce turned out thick and gooey like a paste, had to add chicken broth to thin it enough to call "sauce".  Also, would definitely add more vegetables next time.  Not enough spinach, and would add color and variety if some carrots were thrown in there (too blah looking as is)  Will try again with mods as mentioned...

Excellent when you want something creamy and succulent. I added juice of half a lemon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the white sauce.   When white sauce was done I threw like 10 oz Spinach in there on low heat, and also threw the chicken in, then threw some lemon pepper seasoning in there. It became a thick chunky mixture when altogether. So I layered the baking dish with the pasta and chicken sauce and mozzarella, but then I made 1 cup more white sauce in the just used pan to drizzle over baking dish to make it more saucy. Topped with bits of Spinach and shredded parmesan and Let it bake for 35 min, then a 2 or 3 min broil to get a golden brown crust and voila. Angels sang when I had the first bite.

Excellent...will make again and add some more veggies [red peppers, carrot shreds, broccoli maybe?)...you could get away with less mozzarella and parmesean cheeses if cutting calories.  Great sauce by itself, I will use that part of the recipe for other pasta dishes or white sauce pizza...yum!

It was good, I made a few changes:
• used Monterey Jack instead of Parmesan because that's what I had on hand
• sauteed mushrooms and used fresh spinach
• extra extra extra garlic!
• I put an egg, salt and some parsley in my ricotta!
 
I added the mushroom and spinach to the white sauce and then threw the chicken in there, I wish I would have just added the chicken seperately because it was hard to see how evenly it was dispersed throughout the casserole dish.

Mine came out pretty tastey but fairly sloppy, wasn't the typical lasagna consistency. I had to scoop, not Slice... 

I may try adding some more salt, chicken and perhaps bacon or a breadcrumb topping to add some texture next time! 

Overall, good flavors-very creamy.

made this for the first time for a dinner party last night. it was an absolute hit. it was relatively easy to make, made it a few hours ahead of time and then put in fridge. only changes i made were to add more garlic to the onion and butter, add wine to the roux mix and more cheese to the layering of the lasagna.  mixed one package of spinach with the chicken and ricotta and then used that to layer.used  barilla no boil noodles which worked great. covered with foil for 40 minutes and then uncovered for 20 minutes to finish cooking. just a great meal. elegant and delicious!

I rate this 4.75 stars...adding more chicken would make this a 5 star recipe, in my opinion.  I made it as directed except, I used fresh spinach and cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese.  Made on Father's Day for my husband, father-in-law and his brother...all loved it.  I, too, thought the instructions for assembly were a bit confusing, but easy enough to get through it.  I will make it again.

Great recipe base!  Even my picky eaters gobbled this up.  I always doctor everything tho.  I lightly cooked some asparagus and mushrooms together to add to the ricotta cheese and spinach mix, which I doubled the amount of spinach.  I also added just a touch of white wine to the sauce mix.  Instead of chicken chunks, I used 2 pounds of ground chicken, there was a much more even spread.  I also used some of my fresh herbs from the garden, which isn't always an option.  Will definitely make this again, but with my own touch.

I have made white chicken lasagna using several different recipes. Unfortunately, I misplaced our favorite recipe and decided to try this one because of the rating, BIG MISTAKE,  The flavor was blah and the texture was goo (note; don't mix cheese in sauce).

I was excited to find this recipe after having tried a white lasagna for the first time at a party.  It wasn't quite as good (the one I had tried had been professionally made), but it came pretty close.  I did find it to be a bit bland on day #1, but the leftovers on day #2 were fabulous as there had been time for the flavours to blend together.  Next time I"ll add more seasoning.  Also, this would be just as great without the chicken, I imagine!

***UPDATE***  I made this without the chicken, as per my original review above.  Turned out just great.  Served with quinoa and spinach stuffed tomatoes, so we got our protein from the quinoa.  Just excellent, I won't bother with the chicken next time!

As is, the recipe is good.  A few adjustments made it great.  First, I hate Ricotta cheese.  I can't stand the texture of it.  I used Cottage cheese and added Asiago for extra flavor.  I wish when people write a recipe using fresh garlic, instead of saying "1 clove", since every clove is a different size, they'd say "a teaspoon or tablespoon".  I used about a heaping teaspoon, but wish I'd added more.  I also added some diced sun dried tomatoes to the sauce at the last minute.  I also sautéed about a cup of dice portabella mushrooms and mixed them with the spinach.  Oh, I took another reviews idea and only used milk instead of chicken broth.  It made the sauce thick but really good.

I made this and was disappointed.  I would eliminate the ricotta or use cottage cheese...the chicken/ricotta layer was dry.

My Family loved this recipe we tweeked it just a little. We used a rotisserie chicken and mixed it with our sauce. We also mixed our spinach and ricotta together as well. Made it easier to spread. This is a keeper!

This dish was wonderful! Was more generous on the cheeses and seasonings for a bolder flavor and increased the onion and garlic. Fresh spinach is much better. Also, increased the sauce by 1/3-1/2. Definitely a crowd pleaser.

Ok, so I've made this fantastic recipe twice now. Once as written, and it was great. The second time, yesterday, I added cremini mushrooms, shredded carrots, squash and zucchini.  I did make 1 and 1/2 times the sauce. I liked the second version better simply because I love vegetables. Everyone loved this, and it is even better the next day for lunch! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

Great taste! I subbed fresh spinach, 9 ounce bag, as I didn't have frozen. I just used it raw on the layer that called for spinach. Cooked the lasagna for an hour. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely make this recipe again!

I tried this recipe for a family birthday lunch and everyone loved it! It has more cheese in it than almost any recipe I've ever made, but the taste is wonderful. One family member can't eat any food items from the nightshade group - tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, goji berries or peppers - so this recipe was a welcome way to avoid the usual tomato- based lasagna. Allrecipes makes it easy to adjust the recipe ingredients to the number to be served. Thanks for a great recipe that's deserving of every 5-star rating it's gotten.

I got the impression this was an "alfredo-dish" from the picture, but it turned out more "gravy-like." Also, there was a little too much spinach.  Maybe use half next time.  My husband liked it though, he gives it 4 stars.

Wasn't a huge fan.  Part of that was because I messed it up since I found the layering directions confusing, but part of that was also because there was just way too much spinach.  It overpowered everything and just made it rather unpleasant.

I wish we could give half stars, I would give this recipe 3.5 stars as is. Something is off with the seasonings. Hubby declared it 'different' - I made homemade lasagna noodles for mine (the noodles were great) - used 3 cloves of garlic instead of one (we love garlic), sautéed 1 pound of fresh spinach and an extra splash of milk since my sauce got almost too thick to spread. I don't know if its the oregano that gave it a funky taste for us or the Basil. I'm normally a huge fan of Basil so I'm guessing it may have just been too much oregano. Might try it again when I have the time, but will definitely adjust the seasonings.

Love this recipe.  Have made it several times.  The only thing I did was to season the chicken breasts before cooking them.  It's important to make one layer of spinach and the next layer of chicken.  They will keep their individual tastes/flavors that way.  Don't follow advice of others and mix it all together (really).  A couple of times, I substituted broccoli cuts for the spinach and it was good.  A lot of work . . . but so well worth it.  ALSO - use the lasagna noodles that you cook.  So much better than the non-cook.

2nd try- I browned chicken and sausage together then used the oil to sauté fresh spinach, mushrooms and a touch more garlic. I omitted the salt and used Cajun seasoning.  This recipe was still a little bland but the salt level was much better. I think I will try 1/2 teaspoon more seasoning next time and possibly cottage cheese.  The grittiness of the Ricotta is somewhat off putting for me.   I also used oven ready noodles (excellent idea) and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes which gave no heat at all.  Next time I will use 1/2 tsp. 3.5 stars

1st try- Meh...  Use half spinach and salt.  Layer the way you choose.  Add a little crushed red pepper and it might be a little better.  Just ok but VERY labor intensive and takes way longer to prep than I would have guessed.  The worst part was reading the recipe directions.  Each step should be easily distinguishable and not crammed all in one paragraph.  Again, just OK.

The more cheese the better, extra ricotta makes it delicious. I also cooked the chicken with sour cream and lemon, not sure why, but I like it.

Great. My husband does not like lasagna with a red base so this is a good fit for him. He loved it, especially leftovers.

My husband, son (7 yrs) and I loved this lasagna! My son didn't mind eating the spinach in this dish which in fact he said it tasted GREAT!

I made a couple substitutions since I am gluten intolerant. I used lasagna noodles made of brown rice and 1 cup of gluten-free all purpose flour than the regular all purpose flour. It tasted fantastic! Thanks for this yummy recipe!

To be fair, I made this recipe as written, except using only 1 package of spinach, b/c I did not pay close enough attention to the fact that it calls for 2. When it came to assembling this, I mixed the ricotta, spinach and chicken together, to make it easier.  This recipe is extremely good. I did use fat free milk and part skim cheeses, and you couldn't tell. It is still divine and delicious. The only complaint we had was, we felt it could use more salt and more garlic, so the next time I make this, I will add a lot more fresh garlic and extra salt.  This was even better the next day.

For someone who doesn't really eat lasagna not have I ever made it, I thought this was pretty good! Like the others so read the reviews for tips before I started. Btw I precook end my noodles and 1/2ed the onions. I could ace used more bc I honestly couldn't taste them. But anyway, here's my suggestion; 1. Marinate the chicken (I used herb and garlic. Olive oil, pepper/salt, and garlic) 2. Used fresh cooked spinach that was chopped up 3. Use three cups if chicken What I will do next time; put cherry tomatoes on too, add sautéed mushrooms and white wine. I sided this w bacon wrapped asparagus, YUMMO!

I liked this. My family did not. Lots of left overs. Would recommend adding herbs to ricotta cheese. Its too bland on its own.  And the same for the chicken, add herbs.

I loved this recipe as is because I am a huge cheese-lover, but my husband only ate it for one night and then didn't touch the leftovers... which tells me he didn't enjoy it.  I think it would be better for a wider audience with less spinach (maybe 1/2 to 1 package instead of 2) and probably half as much cheese.

This was a great recipe although I would have liked a little more sauce. After refrigerating I found it got kind of dry and didn't tatse as good as it did when it was fresh. Next time I will make extra sauce to add for reheating

Absolutely delicious! Had another couple over for dinner and they were blown away! Sauce was super easy to make. Bake really well. I suggest a broil at the end to crisp up the cheese topping. Yum!!! Thanks for posting this!

I was rather disappointed in the recip. For one, the sauce was VERY thin even after letting it sit for awhile. Also, it was rather bland! There just wasn't much to it. I guess I was just expecting so much more. I wouldn't be opposed to making it again but I will definitely be adding my own flair to it next time!

Made this recipe twice first time with the chicken and the spinach second time with ground mild sausage! Was was way  better with the sausage! Also I used half a cup more of broth because once you bake this in the oven the sauce gets way to thick. Freezes beautifully!

Pretty yummy! Only gave four stars because the taste (though awesome!) wasn't quite worth the effort.  I hate recipes that call for constantly stirring milk until it boils.  That step alone takes 30-45 minutes, so the prep time is way off on this recipe.  I'd fix it again for company most likely. I used Tyson frozen chicken chunks.  Admittedly real chicken would have been better.

Wonderful. This had a ton of flavor. The only thing I did different was I added cottage cheese instead of ricotta because I always do that with my lasagna because its cheaper. Thank  you.

This is an incredible recipe. I have made twice now. The second time, I doubled the sauce (to make two 9x13 pans) and then realized (at the last minute) that I didn't have enough chicken broth. Because I didn't have enough sauce for the second 9x13 pan, I primarily used a pre-made red sauce (I love Classico brand). The result? It turned out fantastic. If you are short on time or ingredients, this recipe is delicious with a red sauce. P.S. I like adding a little bit of nutmeg to the white sauce...

This was a great recipe! Did tweek a bit. Added a pkg of fried, crumbled bacon (will add more next time) yum. only used one pkg of spinach (will use fresh next time as you couldn't taste it) and used more milk and chicken broth as it cooks pretty "contained" and we like it a little creamier. Many reviews stated they thought it was bland, so I used 2 cups mozz and 2 cups of 6 cheese Italian. Gave it a little extra zip. While I did cook chicken in the bacon grease...WOW...I also added some of the remnants of said grease to the sauce to add the bacon bits left in the bottom of the skillet. will def make again!!!

I only used 10 oz. of spinach cos my kids are appalled by anything green in their food, but I increased the chicken a bit.  Easy recipe to make.  I just mixed everything together and layered it with the noodles.  I would have added one more layer of noodles (4 more noodles).  The reason why I gave this only 4 stars is because there was a TON of cheese to this recipe.  I felt my arteries clogging as I ate this...and we are a cheese family.  So next time I will decrease the cheese by 2 cups then it should be more reasonable.
Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe, I have made this 3 times and it is always a big hit! The only change I make is to use just one package of frozen spinach not two.

Made as directed, but with half the spinach (as the 20 oz would have been too much and wouldn't have fit in the pan).  Also added about 1 tbsp more basil.  It was pretty bland.  I'll be making this again, but first seasoning the chicken and cooking it in butter...mmmm.

I LOVE this recipe and have made it for a casual, small dinner party and at our family vacation where 16 family members deemed it the best meal of the week! I tried it with both regular and no-boil lasagna and saw no difference, so that's the way I make it now. The way it is assembled, it comes out of the oven with a soft, golden topping and looks photo-ready! I also just made it with one pack of "Short-cuts" original chicken and you could not tell. Otherwise, I've followed the ingredients to a tee and I think this is a perfectly delicious recipe--thank you!

I've been using Allrecipes for a LONGGGGGG time and have never had the inclination to write a review about a recipe until I cam across this one. IT WAS AMAZING!!!! I took the time to read some of the reviews and here are the additions/substitutions that I made:

Used Fresh spinach and also added fresh finely chopped mushrooms. I sauteed the two together with a little butter and EVOO. Once those were done cooking, I added the Ricotta. I used a little more than the recipe calls for because there is no such thing as too much cheese!!!!

For the sauce mixture, I used 2 cups of milk, 2 cups of broth and more garlic than it called for. Use as much garlic as your taste buds can handle... I also followed a previous tip to finely chop your onions while you cook the sauce. I finely chopped them and it added flavor without being "too chunky" of an onion taste.

I used 2cups of 6 cheese italian mixture and 2 cups of mozzarella instead of 4 cups of mozzarella, and used more parmesan than it called for. Again, the more cheese the better!

ALSO - I used FF ricotta, low fat butter, low fat cheeses (when possible), reduced sodium chicken broth, FF milk - - - dont get me wrong, this recipe isn't "healthy" but I cut back wherever possible and it was still amazing. 

I also used Tyson ready made grilled chicken strips. Heated them over the stove, then chopped them up in to small bite sized pieces and also used no boil lasagna noodles Barilla brand. 

DELICIOUS & will continue to use this recipe!

With all the money and time spent I wouldn't make this again. My boyfriend liked it, I thought it was edible and my son did not care for it at all. I precooked the noodles, tripled the garlic, I cooked diced chicken breasts seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder, used fresh spinach that I cooked with garlic and butter, added nutmeg to the sauce and spinach and layered it differently. Sauce, noodles, spinach and ricotta mixed together, 1/2 cup mozz cheese. Then noodles, sauce, chicken, 1/2 cup mozz cheese. Then noodles, rest of the sauce, 1 cup mozz cheese, parm cheese and fresh parsley. I didn't like the chicken layer. The texture and blandness of the chicken just was unappealing to me. I loved the spinach and ricotta layer and think I might try using that as a filling for manicotti and using the sauce to cook it in!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and I loved it! I would not change a thing. I was a little nervous at first because I did not know how favorful it was going to be but it was right on the money. My mother in law had some and raved about it at work. This will become one of the meals I take to events and gatherings.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I'm a single mother of a two year old & I'm a preschool teacher. I pack my lunch almost everyday and I tried this recipe because it would freeze well!! However I used GROUND CHICKEN instead of cubed chicken! I also am a cheese lover so I added more of both cheeses! I mixed my ricotta, chicken & spinach and layered it as follows: sauce, noodles, ricotta & chicken mix, sauce, cheese, noodles, ricotta & chicken mix, noodles, sauce, cheese! It turned out GREAT!

Oh boy! This was so yummy. That white cream sauce was so delicous that it can be used on pasta alone! Next time I will make more of the sauce and cut back on the Mozzarella cheese. I want to add mushrooms and other veggies next time too. You definately need to try this!

This recipe was a huge hit with my family! I am not one that puts chicken in lasagna so I used sweet Italian sausage and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. It turned out so great!! I will defiantly be adding this to our menus.

Excellent recipe! My husband tried it and almost ate half of it. I changed couple of things to aim for a healthier version. I used 2% evaporated milk, uncooked whole pasta, more garlic, made my own chicken broth and low fat cheese. I mixed the cheese and spinach so it's more consistent. You will love it. It was delicious!

this is a fabulous recipe, as shown by it's thousands of high reviews and ratings.  i do think it needs more spinach (used fresh when i made it).  it's a very rich and heavy recipe, so a fresh salad is all you need to go with it.  this wouldn't be good to serve with appetizer's beforehand because i don't think you could possibly eat a whole lot combined with this lasagna!  but it overall was quite good and flavorful, although my kids wouldn't touch it :(

This was so good :) I made it ahead of time and used ready to bake lasagna noodles. I froze it for about a week and pulled it directly out of the freezer and baked with the foil on for about 2 hours and then uncovered it and baked for another 30 minutes. It was wonderful!

This was good not great, and I was so excited about it! I followed the recipe instead of modifying it, but I will try it again with a few modifications. My family ate it, but they weren't too thrilled about it. They said it needed more seasoning.

Absolutely loved this, even my brother who hates spinich couldn't get enough of it!  Though I did make some changes; instead of just doing one layer of chicken and one layer of spinich I mixed them together and did three layers of each; and instead of just using ricotta, I mixed it with cottage chesse, it changes the texture alittle bit.  Also next time I make it I think I'm going to cut the amount of spinich in half because at times it seemed like it overpowered the dish a little too much.

I followed this recipe to the T (except I added 3 cloves of garlic instead of just one, cuz that's how I roll), and it was fantastic.  I will definitely make this again.  I would like to try it with a little green bell pepper, though, to see how it would taste with that little twist in flavor.  Excellent recipe.

This was really good.  I've never tried lasagna that wasn't tomato based, and I would definitely recommend this.  I did cut the recipe in half because there was just 2 people.  I used 6 noodles and put them in a 9x9 dish.  Also, I don't care for the taste of ricotta so I subbed it for a mixture of cottage cheese and egg.

I loved it the day I made it.  I normally love left overs, but this was not very good left over.  Definitely will make it when I'm feeding a larger crowd.

This takes some time to prepare but it is very worth it! The flavor was incredibly smooth and flavorful! I loved the fact that the chicken was just the right amount and didn't overpower the lasagna. I will be making this again!

Very Very good! My husband could hardly wait for it to be done baking it smelled so good!!! I wasn't a fan of the frozen spinach. I think it would taste better with fresh spinach.  Also its very rich So I would plan on serving it with a light salad.

My family loved this recipe. I used fresh spinach (cooked in a skillet with couple TBS of olive oil) and didn't think to squeeze all the juice out of it, so my lasagna was runny and fell apart. Lesson learned.  But even though it was not very pretty to look at, it tasted REALLY good, and has been requested again by my crew!

This is my favorite lasagna ever. I make it for all my friends and family and they absolutely love it. I've shared the recipe with at least 10 people who agree that it's delicious. The only thing I do differently is add a little extra chicken broth and I onlu use half of the spinach called for - good if you're not a spinach fan!

This lasagna was very tasty!! Will be a keeper in my house!! The only thing I didn't like much,it was very runny, maybe because I didn't use enough Spinach. I used 11 ounce fresh spinach, because that is all I had. The taste though was awesome!!

This was very good and the sauce that you make is absolutely phenomenal!  I will def be using it as a base for my alfredo dishes.  Also, I didn't want to have to buy a clove of garlic so I just used garlic salt instead and it was perfect.

Good dish, but I am not a huge spinach fan so it didn't "hide" enough of that flavor for me.  I wanted to make this instead of traditional lasagna to be healthier, so I'll keep looking... UPDATE:  I have found what I was looking for, try "Chicken Lasagna Alfredo" from this site.  It's fantastic!

With an overall total rating of nearly 5 stars, my husband and I expected a bit more flavor.  It is definitely rich--maybe a bit too rich for my family, and it is just too bland for us.  We even used an extra garlic clove.  Maybe if we try it again, aside from using lower fat cheeses or something to reduce the richness, we will experiment with more, and different seasonings.  But I am not so sure we would make this again.  It made me miss regular lasagna in that the red sauce at least gives more flavor. (An I do like white pizza by the way).  My husband though maybe sausage would be good in it with the chicken.  Just a starchy, heavy dish without much flavor.

The best Lasagna I have ever had. I only used 16 oz of Spinach and I think I should have stuck to the recipe. I did mix the Ricotta, Spinach and Chicken together in a bowl for easy layering. My family loves, loves it!

Great recipe! I used fresh sauteed spinach and added diced mushrooms to them. I seasoned the ricotta and wished I had seasoned the chicken more. But I got rave reviews for everyone. One person said it tasted like something he would have ordered in a restaurant.

This is a great recipe when you don't want beef.  I did use whipping cream instead of the milk and broth and used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I also opted out of using the basil and oregano.  I put in fresh mushrooms and sometimes throw in some roasted tomatoes.  Family request this once a month.

This is a very good recipe.  I made this for a group of friends and I received HIGH praise & several requests for the recipe.  I made a couple of changes:  I used 3 cups of chicken and about 1 3/4 boxes of spinach.  I love spinach but I wasn't sure all my guests would want to be overwhelmed with it. I used 2% milk and the sauce was plenty thick and creamy.  I did chop the onions in small pieces.  I added a bit more Parmesan cheese on top - and used a combination of shaved and shredded.  I cooked my chicken in my crock pot and I didn't have a lot of dirty dishes, as some reviewers did.  Following the directions, layering this easy to make dish was a breeze.  We had leftovers tonight and it was, as I suspected, BETTER the 2nd night than the first.  We have an Italian dish at least once a weeka nd this recipe will definitely become a part of our regular rotation.  I'm eager to try some additonal veggie additions such as carrots or artichoke.  Yum.

This recipe was good, but HOLY CHEESE!  When I baked the lasagna, there was oil pooled around the sides of the pan.  I even cut back on the ricotta and cheese on top since I thought the amount had to be wrong.  I also think less cheese could have been used in the sauce as well.  Anyways, even with less it was still good.

This is a delicioius recipe! I used the no-boil noodles and they didn't work for me.  They were still very chewy, despite adding 1/2 cup extra chicken broth (eventhough the recipe didn't say to).  I normally use no-boil noodles in my regular lasagna, so I was surprised it didn't work here.  I will definitely make this again, but use the regular lasagna noodles.  Delicious!

I dirtied every pot in the house but it was totally worth it.  I used fresh spinach that I had on hand and it didn't cook down enough, should have stuck to the frozen that the recipe called for. Other than that it was awesome. And the next day the leftovers were even better. Definately going in my collection.

I didn't bring to boil after adding the milk and broth so the cheese sauce was pretty watery.  It still had great flavor and went very fast!  It was totally my fault, not the recipes!  Best of luck to everyone with this terrific recipe!

It was not bad but we thought it was a little bland. Next time I will try and use an Italian blend of cheeses in stead of just mozzarella. I have two step kids who are very picky and they actually asked for seconds. The other thing I thought was it was a little loose next time I will mix an egg and some spices into the Ricotta  before layering it into the lasagna.  I also used only one package of Spinach I thought it was plenty.  This was not a bad meal.

My family loved this recipe!  I used no-bake noodles, fresh spinach (just took off stems and threw it in) and about 50% more cheese.  Very good.  Will double the spinach next time.

Very good recipe. The sauce was excellent! Not sure if I will use the ricotta cheese next time, it didn't seem to have a purpose. I will also use a more flavored chicken like Rotiserie because my cubed chicken was bland. Overall this was a great recipe.

This dish is absolutely fantastic!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for - I didn't change one single incredient.  I used split chicken breasts and boiled them to make my own broth - this was a cheaper option than buying broth and boneless skinless chicken.  I also made a little more sauce than what recipe called for because I made a very large casserole dish of this recipe.  Melt in your mouth!

I just tried this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday and it was an absolute hit!!! He is not a beef lasagna fan, so he told me his mom used to make a chicken lasagna just for him. Mind you, this was the first time I cooked lagsagna (I usually buy the frozen kind), but I wanted to make something special for his birthday. I must say he loved it!!!  What makes the difference in the lasagna is the sauce; absolutely delcious!!! Thank you very much, I will definitely make this recipe often.

Made this yesterday for a potluck--everyone loved it and all wanted the recipe!    I did made extra so I would have some for hubby in case there were no leftovers--good thing I did!  They all but licked the pan.  Definite keeper. I don't understand why a couple of people said they didn't understand if noodles were to be pre-cooked--it's right there in step one.. Thanks for this great recipe.

This was my first lasagna ever!  My husband and I loved it, but it didn't go over quite as well with the kids as I had hoped.  It was worried when it came out of the oven that it was too runny/saucy, but it congealed as it rested.  Someone had written that it was too dry, which makes me wonder if they missed either the broth or the milk.  My husband detests ricotta, but I read a review where someone successfully substituted cottage cheese, so that is what I did.  I was worried about it being "weird", but it all melted down and you didn't even realize there was cottage cheese in it.  I used 1 package of spinach and it was plenty.  2 would have been too much.  Delish!

While not your traditional lasagna, this was pretty darn good.  I cooked the sauce and prepared the lasagna during lunch, and just let it sit in the fridge until dinner.  This recipe can easily be made ahead of time, then cooked.  I too used no-boil lasagna noodles and they turned out just fine.  I also added LOTS more garlic than the recipe called for as well as freshly grated nutmeg over the spinach.  (I used one bag of fresh baby spinach, too, not the frozen kind.)  Very filling, but very good.  Thanks for a delicious recipe, Lisa!

This is the best lasagna I've ever made. Sounds like loads of ingredients and lots of work but actually did not take as much effort as it sounds. Followed the recipe exactly for a dinner party and everybody loved it including kids

Good but not great. A LOT of cheese so very rich and high calories. I don't think I will make this again. I prefer lighter meals.

I made this last night. When I added the cheese to the sauce, it was almost "pasty/doughy" like. Next time I will just layer the cheese seperately, other than that, it was DELISH!

Very good. I made this recipe last night.  It was a little time consuming and I did take the suggestion and used fresh spinach.  I also added sun dried tomatoes on top of the chicken.  It was very good but I cooked the spinach down too much and not much was left.  I think that next time I make it, I will add the spinach and chicken to the sauce and might substitute cottage cheese for the ricotta.  Has anyone done that?  I am not real fond of ricotta cheese.  My husband really liked it.

This was amazing!! I will definitely make it again, but I will add more spices. I already added double the garlic and added some Italian seasoning, but think it needed just a little more.    Also, just a warning in terms of the prep time. The ingredients listed are already "prepared" (meaning it looks like chopping, shredding, and chicken cooking are not factored into the prep time) So just a heads up if you are in a time crunch!!

Made this for my 5th wedding anniversary. I was a little skeptical of the sauce at first, but boy was I wrong. Instead of the dried basil I added almost 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil because I love a lot of basil in my food. I also took the bacon suggestion and it really does add something. Incredibly easy to make. Most of the ingredients I have on hand usually. I will definitely be making this again!

This was awesome! I only used one box of spinach and no parm because sadly I had run out. My husband and I both loved it. I made it in two loaf pans so I can freeze one. Hope it reheats as well as it tasted tonight! thank you!!

Exceptional recipe! I have made this twice so far. First time I followed the recipe with only one small change - I used only one package of spinach and felt it was more than enough. It turned out great and the white cheese sauce was rich and yummy! Second time I made it I used a shortcut and bought jarred alfredo. Turned out quite good as well! Next time I want to add mushrooms. This recipe was added to our family favorites and I will be making it often. Thanks!

Super tasty!  If you want a shortcut you can use jarred alfredo.  I put my cooked chicken, baby bellas and diced onion in the sauce.  Also, my family isn't wild about spinach so we used sun dried tomato pesto mixed in with the ricotta cheese.  The nutty flavor was good but a layer of straight sundried would kick it up a notch.  I'll try that next time.

Outstanding- tastes very rich. My mother in law wanted the recipe immediately.  I made mine a day ahead and popped in the oven the next day. Used no cook lasagna noodles with no problem. I will try no fat ricotta next time, I think it will taste just as rich. Only used 1 box of spinach and it was plenty. Great make-ahead dish to serve company and a nice lasagna alternative. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my family and did not tell them at first there was spinach in it because they wouldn't have eaten it.  They loved it.  I took the recipe to work and several of my coworkers have made it and loved it.  It was a HUGE hit!  I also made it for a family at our church that was having some health issues.  They have went on and on about how awesome it was.  I will keep this in my favorites folder!

I used the no cook noodles and added 1/2 cup broth.  I also used 1 package of spinach and mixed with the Ricotta as suggested.  One thing I did that I didn't find others doing is:  added chopped celery, carrots and fresh red pepper.  I sauted w/ the garlic and onion.  I also used olive oil to saute.  A little healthier and wonderful flavor!

This was just okay to me, as well as hubby and kids. I agree with previous posters that the chicken could use some flavor of its own..sauteed in oo and garlic perhaps? I only used one pkg of spinach as it was all I had, I think more would have been...well, not to my liking . I also thought the amount of sauce was slim. Thanks for sharing, but nothing I'm dying to make again.

Great recipe although a bit time consuming. I was having a dinner party and this was a perfect dish. I added an additional layer of spinach. Used whole wheat noodles and used fresh spinach instead of frozen and it turned out great. Will definately make again.

This was so yummy! The only things I did different were substitute fresh spinach for frozen, and I used no-boil noodles so I didn't have to cook them first. My kids and husband loved it! I am making it for the second time tonight with cooked noodles to see which I like better. Thanks so much for this recipe!

The cooked chicken needs flavor of its own to bring to the dish.. some spices/herbs need to be added. It was kind of bland...but did taste better the next day.

This was really good. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and added chopped carrots (steamed first) and yellow squash (sauteed first) for some extra vegetables. I also used the "no boil" lasagna noodles and it turned out fine. I just made sure to bake it covered with them, even though the recipe doesn't say too. I also cooked the chicken in some onion and garlic to give it a bit more flavor. Yummy.

Delicious! My kids even liked it better than the traditional red sauce lasagna.  I only used 1/2 an onion and minced it so my kids couldn't see it.  I shredded the 2 cups of chicken but will use 4 cups next time.  And I only used one pkg of frozen chopped spinach.  Thank you for this recipe!

Wonderful! I didn't add the fresh parsley and I exchanged one container of spinach for artichoke hearts My husband said he would keep it that way instead of 2 boxes of spinach. I also used the oven ready noodles and increased the time to 50 minutes. I also just cut up frozen chicken breast (3).  I would highly recommend this to anyone! We were all well pleased. This is definitely a keeper...thank you so much for sharing!

I love white sauces but this wasn't the best for us.  Hubby said I could make again but he didn't want it on a regular basis.  I much prefer to make the chicken florentine receipe from this site.

This is literally the best thing I have ever made...no it's the best thing I have ever EATEN.  I ate it for basically every meal, and when I was done with the pan, I was really sad.  I made this weeks ago but I still think about it all the time.  I didn't make many changes, except subbed the onion for onion powder because I don't like onions.  I used no-bake noodles and I just can't express enough how TOTALLY AMAZING it is.

Simply perfect!  I even cut the mozzarella and parmesan in half and substituted feta for ricotta.    I suggest a ton more garlic. No fail recipe.

This tasted good, but like another poster mentioned, it used up a lot of pans.  I would make it again on a weekend night when I had time to do a bunch of dishes.

I thought that this was very bland (my boyfriend thought it was ok but not great)~ was quite disappointed because I'm not someone who has to have extra flavorful food. I was very excited to try it, I won't be making it again however.

I put this in shells because that's what I had in the cupboard.  Instead of using spinach, I chopped up some broccoli, carrots, & asparagus, maybe 2- 2 1/2 cups of vegetables total.  Sauteed the onion, garlic & vegetables in the butter & made the sauce in there.  Left out the ricotta because I didn't have any and halved the mozzarella because sauce didn't seem to need it. Used about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese with the parmesean cheese for topping.  This made 2 8x8 pans of shells, fulling probably about 30 shells.  Oh my gosh, heaven in every bite!!!!

I absolutely LOVED it! At first I was worried about it being bland but it was fine. I'm a garlic fan so I used a whole bulb instead of a clove and slowly cooked fresh spinach in butter as well. In the future I'll probably double the amount of chicken since 2 chicken breasts didn't seem like enough. I feel like the layering instructions were a bit misleading so mine accidentally ended up a bit different, but it's lasagna! So it all worked out in the end.

This was a bit rich for me (and that's tough to do). My family liked it but my husband recommends to use a bit of cheddar for a better flavor. I'll make again and try his recommendation.

Fantastic!  A new favorite.  Some changes: (1) I upped the garlic and added italian seasoning. (2) I layered by mixing the extra cheeses, spinach (fresh!) and chicken.  Sauce - Noodles - Cheese (1/2) - Sauce - Noodles - Cheese (1/2) - Sauce - Noodles - Sauce!

Great recipe, and a wonderful change from traditional lasagna. The only thing I would do differently next time is season the chicken. I only cooked it with a little seasoning and it just tasted bland within the lasagna. No one else noticed, but I am critical of the things that I make. However, the recipe was still great and 5 stars the way it is.

This was super delicious. What I did for ease of layering was to mix the shredded chicken and the spinach into the white sauce. I also added a egg, parsley and some Parmesan to the ricotta. Then I layered it like my lasagna: sauce, noodles, ricotta, moz cheese x 3. Delicious!   I made this again but didn't have enough ricotta, so I did 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese and couldn't tell the difference. Yum!

I had to make a few modifications to this recipe to get my family to eat it.  I subbed cottage cheese for ricotta (I always do this in my regular lasagna recipe) and chopped broccoli for spinach.  It was good, but would probably be better as written.  I must say, the cheese sauce is amazing!  I may use it in other recipes.

Excellent! I only had 2 cups of mozzarella but it worked out to be plenty. I only used one bag of spinach which seemed to be more then enough as well.  This is so good. i wasnt even looking for this recipe. I will make this again for sure. Thanks

I thought this was very good...much better the next day.  I did not make it lasagna style, but instead used pasta I had on hand (mini shells) and just mixed it all together before baking it.  I also omitted the spinach for my picky family and used leftover chicken from Crockpot Lemon Garlic Chicken on this website.  Great way to use what's in the pantry...thanks!

Excellent!  Only made a few minor swaps.  I used cottage cheese in place of the ricotta (not a fan) and I only used one-third to half the amount of spinach it called for.   I mixed the spinach with the cottage cheese and added an egg to that mixture.  And I mixed the cubed chicken with the cheese sauce then I layered it as you would a regular lasagna.  I also used low-fat cottage cheese and low-fat mozzarella to save on the calories and fat.  Next time I will use a whole grain lasagna noodle to make it more healthy as well.  Will definately be saving this one!

I was looking for this because I have a recipe calling for cottage cheese but wanted ricotta.  This came out so much more rich & delicious.  Used fresh spinach sauteed with mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great; the only reason I would give it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it took me forever to make. It was delicious though.  I only used 1 bag of spinach and mixed the spinach with the ricotta.

Certainly worth making! I added less spinach for lack of ingredients and it needed to be spread thin, but was still great.  Really wonderful change of pace from your normal everyday lasagna. Try it!

This recipe was great!  I did make a few changes, I used ground chicken instead of the cooked, cubed chicken.  and, i added sauteed mushrooms to the spinach layer.  Fabulous!

I absolutely loved this recipe--it was exactly what I was looking for. It was the first time in probably 10 years I had made lasagna from scratch, but the recipe was easy to follow and it turned out perfectly.  Next time I make it, to save some time, I'll skip all of step 2 and its ingredients, and use store-bought sauce instead. I was halfway through before I realized I was making alfredo sauce from scratch! It was delicious, but took quite awhile.   I also used someone's earlier suggestion and cooked fresh spinach instead of frozen.   All in all, great white lasagna recipe!

This was a nice twist on the same old lasagna.  I simmered the chicken breasts in chicken broth (with added herbs and spices) then reduced a little bit to provide the 2 cups worth for the sauce. I also used 2 small bags of fresh spinach.  I just sauteed until wilted with a couple cloves of garlic.  I also added an egg, some italian seasoning and dash of salt and sugar to the riocotta mixture.  Overall, very nice!

I think this would be much better if the recipe called for browned and drained Italian sausage rather than chicken, broccoli (in addition to the spinach), and if the white sauce had several cloves of roasted garlic blended into it.  The recipe as it stands was a bit bland, and the chicken was just kind of 'there'.  I used 2% milk and the sauce was super thick- I cannot imagine using whole milk. That said, I think the flour and butter could both be halved- saving a ton of carbs, calories, and fat.  I also ended up using only 2.5 cups of mozzarella altogether- using anymore would have just been gluttonous.

Made this for the first time a couple of nights ago, and was highly impressed! My husband and I both really enjoyed it, and I definitely plan on making it again. I do recommend using the no boil noodles if you want to dirty less pans. Also, I added fresh mushrooms to it, and was so happy I did! They added a nice taste to it all! I highly recommend trying this recipe!

YUMMO! This dish is awesome.  What a nice change from the regular red sauce lasagna.  I only made a few changes after reading other's reviews.  I shredded the chicken, used fresh spinach, added sliced sauteed mushrooms and split the milk with lt. cream.  My DH loved this dish and I will be adding to my rotation list.  Thanks for the recipe......

I really enjoyed this dish!  I didn't have any ricotta, so I left it out and I made a few tweaks to the spices just cause I know what my family likes.  Funny thing was my hubby said afterwards, "it could use a ricotta layer!"  so next time I'll be sure to have ricotta on hand.  I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe. Made a few changes but stayed relatively true to the recipe - doubled the garlic to 2 cloves and swapped cottage cheese for ricotta because that's what I had, and used MUCH LESS butter (maybe 1 Tbsp at most). Served it for my sister-in-law while she was visiting, and we all really enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. But i cut the ammount of spinach in half, and there was still a ton. I also added a little cream cheese. I decided not to cube the chicken but to shread it instead, the texture was much better that way!

Husband Liked and he is fairly picky with new recipes...I did 6 servings instead of 12 and decided to take some ideas into consideration....I bought fresh spinach and cooked it in olive oil, next time I will use butter though...and I cut up some mushrooms and sauted them too. I didn't use as much cheese as requested it had plenty...I went a little less on the parmesan and mozz....and I shredded the chicken which gave it great texture. I also used a zester for the onion as I don't really like big pieces for my toddler... it was a very good dish and I would make it again next time I will not skimp on the butter though.....it will add good flavor ! Oh and I used 1 whole garlic clove and probably could have used another :) Delish ! thank you !

This is INCREDIBLE.  So cheesy and rich and delicious.  I made little tweaks here and there to save time -- pre-made Italian chicken breasts that I shredded, dried parsley flakes, and a spice container of minced garlic -- and it was still fantastic.

This is a great recipe but be prepared to have to change it a bit - you need more noodles and more filling to keep it from being too saucy/runny.   The flavor is very good - I would add more chicken next time.  But it is a great change from all the red sauces out there!

This was good but I don't think it was worth all of the work.  I suppose if you did it in stages, it might have been easier.  I was boiling chicken, making the sauce, and cooking the noodles all at the same time.  It took a long time to get dinner on the table.  When I work that hard, I want oohs and aahs.  I didn't get any.  Just a few "this is good" responses.  I used a 10oz bag of fresh spinach.  I didn't change anything else.  I think it has way too much cheese.  I would probably cut back on the mozz and add a little more parmesian on the top.  Also, it barely fit into my 13x9 pan.  I had to keep smashing it down as I was putting the layers together.

Yummy, but I omitted the chicken and did things a bit differently.  I made the sauce and layered it on the bottom, then 3 noodles, then a mixture of a container of ricotta & 2 packages of thawed and squeezed frozen spinach.  Next, more noodles, sauce, and an entire defrosted bag of chopped broccoli mixed with the mozzarella and then topped it with chopped mushrooms.  Then just did another layer of noodles and sauce.  I thought it could have been a little more flavorful, but that's probably because I didn't highly season all the layers- something I will definitely do next time.

This was great.  I cut the ricotta cheese some and added 1/2 chopped green bell pepper to the onion.  Next time I'll add a whole bell pepper.  Very good recipe!

Very rich, but very yummy.  I also combined the chicken, ricotta, and spinach to save time.  Use fresh mozerrella if you have it!

This was disappointing.  It didn't have enough flavor.  I added crimini mushrooms with the chicken and used fresh blanched spinach and added a bit of thyme to the chicken mixture but it still didn't do it for me.  I made an extra pan for my kids (grown) but decided not share as I pride myself on tasty meals!  And this just wasn't up to par.

One of my favorite meals! I omitted the chicken so it's a dairy meal. I also substituted the spinach for broccoli and added some mushrooms so it becomes more like a vegetable lasagna. If you're a cheese lover, this is THE best meal! Great way to camauflage veggies in all that creamy goodness.

this was really really good. i think what might make it a bit more fancy is if it had artichoke hearts and maybe some roma tomoatoes on top.... mmmm.

seasoned chicken with mrs. dash garlic and herb, sauteed it in olive oil. i only used one pack of spinach, (accidentally used the other one) and it wasnt enough for us. we love spinach.

overall, delicious.

This was very good - the sauce was super!  A great alternative to regular lasagna. The only thing I would do differently next time is cut the amount of spinach in half...it was a little too much.

This recipe was not only wonderful, but it was fun to make. My husband jumped in and helped me with the layering. :) Here are my suggestions. 1 pkg of spinach was enough, but if you love spinach go for 2. Next time I make this I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces or even shred the chicken. The bit sized chunks I used seemed a little out of place in the dish. I chose to puree the onions instead of chopping and the sauce was smooth and delicious! I will also play with the layering a bit instead of following the recipe suggestions. I also think sauteed mushrooms would be amazing in this dish. This one is a keeper!

This was definitely a make again recipe for me!  My husband ate three large squares for dinner and brought another piece for lunch today.  I almost followed the recipe exact - except I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 heavy cream.  Although it's not very healthy, the heavy cream made for a thick, rich sauce.  I also doubled the recipe.

Bake this for Date Night and you'll be considered a domestic goddess!  I've made this many times with lots of variations: fresh spinach, low fat ricotta and mozzarella, extra chicken...it always turns out superb.  You can even use no-cook noodles, although I usually made extra sauce when I do otherwise it tends to be too dry.  This lasagna freezes beautifully so make two!

This was absolutely delicious! My husband and I loved it.  I didn't use as much cheese or spinach as the recipe suggested (probably about 1/2).  Left out the ricotta because I didn't have any on hand. I seasoned my chicken with some dry Italian dressing mix.  I just mixed the chicken and spinach together and layered noodles, chicken mixture, cheese, sauce, etc.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The white sauce in this recipe is absolutely wonderful!  I did not change a thing except instead of using chicken I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Too bad it's not really diet conscious.  But who are we kidding? Getting fat never tasted so good!

this recipe, while not fast, healthy or cheap is delicious and impressive.  And even better, it freezes amazingly well. I double the recipe and make one to eat and one for the potluck that I know I will not have time to cook for in the near future.    I just put one in my freezer tonite in anticipation of holiday potlucks at work!   Just pull it out and stick in the oven and I'm Martha Stewart!!

I have to admit, this was delicious.  However, I probably won't make it very often because unless you already happen to have cooked chicken on hand, it's pretty time consuming.  I used fresh spinach (frozen spinach tastes funny to me) that I cooked in a little olive oil.  It took about two hours just to get the entire thing prepared and into the oven!  I would definitely make this if I was having over guests that I would like to impress, though!

Very tasty dish.  Very smooth, not too garlicky.  The only changes I would recommend would be to thinly slice the cooked chicken (the cubes were a bit too 
"chunky" in the layers) and use reduced sodium broth and/or less salt.  It was a bit too salty for my taste.  My husband liked it as is though.

This was so good!  I made a few changes: I used an already cooked rotiserrie chicken I bought at the grocery store and de-boned and used the breast meat (this saved time & money because buying raw chicken was a lot more expensive!) I doubled the garlic and only used 1 bag of spinach.  I also used a blend of parmesan, romano and asiago cheese for the parmesan.  Next time I may only use 1/2 of the onion and add some mushrooms.

I made this dish for my baby shower and EVERYONE LOVED it!  My son, who is normally a very picky eater ate two pieces of it!  I have several friends and coworkers that are vegetarians and I thought if you substituted artichoke hearts and mushrooms for the chicken, this would be an excellent crowd pleaser for everyone!  I will definitely make this again!

I loved this recipe. I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about the prep time for. I was in a hurry to get dinner on the table. So I did make a few changes. I left out the ricotta cheese, my husband doesn't like it, I also used rotini noodles. I didn't have spinach so I skipped them. Although to late I thought to add broccoli. I will add it next time. I then just added mixed everything together in the pot I used to make the white sauce. ON top I added the last of the cheese and put the lid on the pot to let the cheese melt. From start to finnish it took me 45 minutes to make it. Maybe a food processor would help people to cut down on the prep time. I just toss the cheese in and grind it instead of grating it. Once everything is melted you can't tell the difference.I put the noodles on to cook at the same time the chicken was cooking and while that was cooking I made the white sauce. As soon as the sauce was done I checked and the noodles and chicken were done so I drained the noodles and cut up the chicken. It was really very quick and easy.

Pretty good "white" lasagna, although I prefer my recipe for rigatoni-broccoli bake with homemade alfredo sauce over this one....  As I do for all lasagna recipes that direct to cook the noodles beforehand, I soak mine in a large (i.e. 9x13 inch pan, or, better yet, a roasting pan) full of VERY hot tap water for about 20-30 minutes while I'm preparing the sauce.  Turns out great every time.  Instead of using cubed chicken breasts, I substituted a lemon-herb rotisserie chicken, deboned it and shredded the white meat (I saved the dark meat for another use).  Did everything else as directed.  My lasagna seemed "wet", but after cooling for 15 minutes, it thickened up.  I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  I invited my bf, parents and another couple over for the festivities.  Problem was, my mom "had" to eat b/c she was starving, so my lasagna didn't have a chance to set.  The second helping was fine (not too saucy).  The homemade white sauce is just divine.  Thanks for sharing such a great, easy to prepare ahead of time, "special-occasion worthy" recipe!  I am now known as the lasagna queen. : )

This was great!  I will definately make again, the entire family (teenagers included) enjoyed this meal.  I didn't change anything.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I didn't like it reheated the next day.  It was yummy..

This was AWESOME! I added sauteed mushrooms, bacon and used fresh spinach. Also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta as that's what was in the fridge. The bacon gave it a wonderful flavour. I added the mushrooms to the first chicken layer, then added the fresh spinach and bacon (whole slices - next time will use crumbles as it was hard to cut through the bacon to serve) to the next chicken layer. Didn't add the extra salt, with all the cheese and the bacon it didn't need it! I cheated and bought a whole cooked chicken at the deli and chopped it up. Thanks for a great recipe! I am in love with that sauce!

For me this was way too rich and creamy. If you are used to that then this is the recipe for you but for my family, we could not even eat the left overs.

It was very tasty. i changed it a bit. i mixed the spinich with the ricotta and bacon. and layered it. i also made a cheese sauce and poured on top before baking it. it was a dish i would do once in a while, as it taked a lot of preperation.

I was a little nerveous to prepare this for a dinner party because I had never tried it!  It came out great!  My guests loved it and all wanted the recipe! It reminded me of an Alfredo Lasagna.  Very rich and creamy! I did a few things differently than the recipe stated. I used about 4 garlic cloves instead of 1, I used oven ready lasagna noodles and I used 1 package of spinach rather than 2.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is fantastic! I made a white lasagna before and it was awful, but this was amazing! I was so excited when the sauce thickened up perfectly, and then added the cheese - YUMMY YUM! It looked awesome. I added a dash of nutmeg, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I would love this sauce on a pizza, simply delicious.

I assembled the lasagna the day before a party, then popped it in the oven for 45 minutes to cook the next day.  I only made a few changes, using 3 garlic cloves, cottage cheese, 1/2 a rotisserie chicken and fresh spinach.  The end result was a little runny, but overall very good.

I had to change my review to give it the five stars it more than deserves.  Originally, I gave it a reluctant four (Really deserves 100 stars) due to the kids and husband being less than enthusiastic about it. But, for lunch the next day (I went on strike), DH warmed some up, saying "It's So Much Better Today!!"  Over the next few days, I almost fell over when I saw the empty tupperware.  HE HAS NEVER WILLINGLY EATEN UP LEFTOVERS - EVER IN HIS LIFE.   I did short the chicken broth, as one reviewer suggested, and made up the rest with white wine.  Instead of individual spices, I just added Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle (garlic, basil, oregano and thyme), and finally:  FRESH spinach (I can't stand canned or frozen), ripped into small (kid-friendlier - if that's possible for Spinach) pieces.  Oh, and used PART-SKIM ricotta and mozzarella cheeses.

This was pretty good. It's very rich with all the cheese. I followed the recipe as shown but did add 2 more cloves of garlic as suggested by others and I used a 16 oz bag of spinach instead of the 20 oz in the recipe.  There was plenty of sauce. I didn't increase anything.  Will make it again.

Very delicious and rich. I used cooked broccoli instead of spinach. I also used leftover chicken which was a bad choice. The chicken tasted funny so we just ate the  top 2 layers.

Wow! This is fantastic! My kids (11 & 4) gobbled it up and my husband raved. I used rotisserie chicken which has so much flavor and is very convenient. using a great quality, flavorful stock makes a big difference. There is one thing I will change when I make it again and the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. I will add an egg to the ricotta as it was dry. I used fresh baby spinach (not cooked) and it was great (easier too). This is a keeper!

I think this recipe would be great if it was rolled up in lasagna noodles and then pour the sauce over the top. It was enjoyed by my husband and his co-workers. It was a great recipe for a large crowd.

This was a lot of work and, though it was good, I didn't find it worth all the effort. I took Navy Mom's recommendation regarding layering and used less spinach and replaced the ricotta cheese with cottage cheese.

This recipe turned out excellent, I will definitely be making it again.  My husband thought it was missing something but he is a fan of standard red sauce lasagna and I am not.  Very rich and creamy, great flavor.  I used ground turkey instead of chicken and fresh spinach instead of frozen, everything else I did the same.  This is a keeper!

This dish is absolutely delicious. The only thing I did differently, however, was after adding half the mozzerella and parmesan to the flour mixture I also added the chicken & spinach and mixed it all up. I then lined the pan with the lasagna noodles and spread the ricotta on top, then put 1/3 of the cheesy, spinachy, chicken mixture on top. I did this for two more layers and then added the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan to the top of the lasagna...it came out perfect!!

This was lasagna was amazing! My whole family really loves it. I've been using Foster Farms Savory Servings Roasted Garlic Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast. I bake the chicken breast in the oven then shred the chicken. It gives the dish a lot of flavor!

Great recipe, 5 stars because my husband and kids loved it. A little bland next time I will play with extra seasonings. Also mine was a little dry to me so I think I'll make and extra half batch of sauce and add it to the ricotta. I will also layer in a more traditional way as the chicken ricotta layer was dry and the spinach/sauce layer was wet. The consistency would be better if it was uniform. I used a Rotisserie chicken which was wonderful.

Great flavor! Half the spinach as suggested. Rotisserie chicken made it simple.  Mine turned out a bit watery. Let stand for 10 minutes, obviously takes a bit longer than that.

This is an awesome recipe!  Everytime I make it, I get tons of compliments and many people think it tastes like something they would order in a great Italian restaurant.  I usually follow this recipe pretty closely but use about 1/2 the spinach and I like to use a rotisserie chicken.  Yum!

My family and I loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to use the oven-ready lasagne noodles as I didn't have any of the others on hand.  It still turned out well.  Just have to watch how much sauce you have for the top layer of noodles since I barely had enough to cover them, but all I did was push them back down into the sauce when the top ones "bowed up" at bit toward the end of cooking.  My husband really liked the oven-ready as they were al dente in texture.  The flavors in this was very good and as others have said....this tasted even better the next day!!  We will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

WONDERFUL!!!!!!  Although, this is not a dish to try and mix together while dinner guests have arrived!  Make it the night before or hours before company comes over because the kitchen becomes a mess! My husband and I had it for a couple of meals and I swear each time it tasted better!  This is a keeper!

Be necessity, I had to change a few things. I used shells (didn't have lasagna noodles) and did not have spinach or ricotta, but this turned out GREAT. I can't wait to make it again "correctly"!

I gave this 4 stars because the sauce was runny after I took it out of the oven. It was really tasty ,but my husband did not enjoy it as he said it seemed like it was not cooked enough. The rest of us enjoyed it and the next day, the sauce had set nicely in the fridge, of course, after cooling, and when I reheated it, it was just fine, thick and no longer a "runny texture.Will make this again with less milk and broth.

Very good.  I used broccoli instead of spinach.  I also used 12 noodles and almost doubled the broth and milk.  I also added a small container of cottage cheese.  The sauce was soupy when I took the lasagna out of the oven.  It may have been the changes I made but the sauce was thick when I assembled the lasagna.  This reminded me of chicken/broccoli alfredo.  Tasted almost the same.

I stumbled across this recipe while looking for something "different" for dinner.  I had never made a lasagna like this, but it was wonderful!  Everyone enjoyed it.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Had my students prepare and serve to a school board meeting. As it was the end of the year we grated and mixed all the left over cheeses from other projects including montery jack, sharp cheddar, parmesan and mozerella. Got great reviews. Thanks for submitting.

I thought this was a great recipe!  Everyone in the family loved it.  I did change a few things.  Instead of spinach, I used broccoli and carrots and sauted them in with the onions and garlic.  I might think about adding sauce to have extra for anyone that would want to add it.  Great recipe!

This lasagna is very good, but not fabulous enough to get five stars.  The flavor was nice, but needed a little more "oomph".  I actually didn't like the chicken in it and thought it would be better with mushrooms instead.  Some reviewers have said it has too much spinach, but I thought it could use more (but I love spinach).  It definitely has a lot of potential!

While this was good, I didn't find it great. The sauce was wonderful, and it was a nice change from the regular tomato sauce lasagna. I did what some other readers suggested and used half the spinach, mixed with the ricotta, and I agree the whole 20 ounces would have been too much. Though I seasoned the cooked chicken breast I used with cajun seasoning and even some extra cayenne pepper, I thought the dish needed an extra "something". The whole thing was rather sloppy, too, with layers spreading all over the place: I'm glad I didn't serve this to company. All in all a great idea, and a nice change of pace, but I doubt I'd make it again.

Very creamy, but this needs SALT. And that's coming from someone who never cooks with salt. It was a little bland for all the effort it took to cook it. The ricotta was very bland, next time I'll use my regular lasagna recipe for ricotta (spices, mozz. cheese, and egg) and see if that spiced things up.

I loved it!! I added 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1, 4 large chicken breasts cubed, (which ended up to be a lot more chicken than 2 cups), and a few more noodles to make it fit the pan better. Our company also loved it and asked for the recipe. I will be making this again!!!

This recipe was awesome!! I cooked it as a meal for my mom, dad, brother, sister-in-law, and fiancee as a first meal and welcome to my new home.  I only had a little bit left and my brother took it home for later.  It's kind of time consuming but worth it in the end.  I modified the recipe a little, I only used one package of spinach and added fresh mushrooms in the place of the other package of spinach.  It turned out great.

Didn't like this very much. Bland even though I added additional seasonings. I reduced the recipe in half and the measurements and directions were off greatly so I had to wing it.

I used one package of spinach with this, which was plenty, and I used non-fat ricotta to try to cut down on at least some of the fat, and it still tasted good.  I screwed up the layering, and it ended up coming out kinda sloppy and messy but tasted great, picky boyfriend loved it.  I will try making this again and hopefully layer it right next time!!

This is a heck of a lot of work but boy is it good!!  I fudged up on the layering a bit, but it didn't seem to affect things at all.  Oh yeah, I also added an extra clove of garlic!  But other than the garlic, I didn't change a thing.  The lasagne tastes awesome.  When I'm cooking on the weekend I'll definately keep this one in mind!!

Pretty good! Messy--but I think worth it. I cooked my chicken with lots of garlic and just a little bit of lemon to help bring out the flavor. I also added two splashes of white wine to the sauce while I was cooking it and used only one package of spinach like some other reviewers here. Next time I think I will use a bit less ricotta cheese because it seemed to be a little overpowering (at least in our dish!), and maybe will try adding some bacon to the chicken like others here have recommended. Thanks for the recipe!

Deeeeeeelicious!!!! As rich as this recipes is, it is definitely a nice treat. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I only substituted Italian Blend seasonings in place of the oregano and basil and used 1 (10 oz.) package of spinach (which was plenty..imo). This lasagna tasted almost exactly like a dish that we enjoy at our favorite upscale restaurant. It is a little time consuming, but it is definitely worth it. I will be making it the next time I have company because the dish itself (not to mention the fantastic smell) is an eye pleaser. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Everyone loved this, made it when we had the grandparents over. Omitted some of the spices, due to personal preference.  Made the cheesy white sauce minus onion, terrific!

this was good and all gone in one sitting, but in my opinion it is too cheesy.  A bit too rich. I will make it again but cut down on the mozzarella.  I used one reader's suggestion to make it partly vegeterian and it was a great idea!

My boyfriend really loved this but there was way too much spinach for me.  I like spinach a lot and I still had to remove about 3/4 of it from each serving I had.  Great leftovers, again if you like a lot of spinach. Will probably make again with a few adjustments.

I loved this lasagna.  I have tried many lasagna's with white sauce and this has the most taste to it due to the fresh chicken broth.  I used fresh spinach sauteed in olive oil and added more mozerella instead of the parmasean cheese.  I also used 3 cloves of garlic and 1/2 tsp of cayenne to the broth.  Delicious!!!

I was a little disappointed with this recipee. The sauce was nice and thick while preparing it, but came out of the oven like water.  The only thing I did differently is that I substituted ricotta cheese with cottage cheese.   I made sure to thaw and drain the spinach well.  Leftovers were better, the sauce had seemed to thicken in fridge.

This lasagna recipe is probably the best thing I have ever eaten.  I was absolutely perfect and not that difficult to make.  I made it for my father on Father's Day and his reply was, "Honey, you've turned out to be a great cook."

My husband and I really enjoyed this...it's amazingly rich! We even shared the leftovers with my parents, who both also liked it very much. It was a bit runny at first, but I may not have drained the spinach as well as I could have. Makes great leftovers the next day though.
Note- made it again and added drained corn and carrots along with the spinach, in that layer, and hubby liked it much better.

I liked it, didn't love it. It was kind of like a spinach dip with pasta, and I only used half the spinach recommended. Definately not worth dirtying all the dishes I used.

This was a good recipe, but I am still searching for a lasagna recipe that knocks my socks off.  After reading the other reviews I tried to add some extra seasoning to the recipe by adding 3/4 cup bacon bits to the chicken layer.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic instead of one and only half the spinach.  I found the lasagna to be better tasting the second time I reheated it.

I didn't get to try this until the next day, tasted great.  I used an italian 4 cheese blend of mozzarella, mild cheddar, provolone and asagio. Also tried the bacon recommendation listed before and replaced 1/2 of the chicken broth with white wine.  Will definitely make again.

A tip for lasagna with no bake noodles:  do NOT place them directly to the edges, and you dont have to overlap!!  Pasta absorbs water and grows in size when it cooks.  I made this recipe and the "sauce" was equivalent to about 2 pounds of melted cheese!  The ladagna was too dry.  I know it was my fault for thinking that the sauce was enough, but I would try this one again with my own alfredo sauce or one from this site.  Here's a tip:  Make the sauce according to these directions for layering, then POUR a thinner alfredo around the edges.

This was terrific!  It took a while longer for me to prepare than was said, however.  Also, next time I will cook the chicken in the crock pot and shred it.  I also will make extra sauce to pour over the top.  Otherwise it was a big hit at our house!

I thought the chicken needed a little more flavoring.  I added some garlic powder, italian Seasoning and some Cajun Seasoning to the chicken as I cooked it.  It made all the difference!! I used Fresh Parsley since I had it on hand And I also substituted 1/2 c. White wine for Chicken Broth as some of the others had mentioned.  Everyone went back for seconds.  Overall it recieved two "4" and one "5".  The 5 was recieved because it had "All the cheese I love!!!"

Delicious! However, instead of the sauce, I made a homemade alfredo sauce instead as I didn't have enough cheese. Will try recipe as is next time.

I made lasagna before but it did not turn out as nearly as good.  The directions were so easy to follow and the white sauce was delicious.  It smelled soooo good.  The only bad thing was that it was for another family and I didn't get to eat any!

I left out the spinach and added 2 layers of chicken that I flattened, seasoned, browned, and cut in lengths. I had to add pepper and Italian seasoning to the sauce cause there really was no flavor at all. The sauce was a bit too thick because of the amount of flour, but it was pretty good recipe. Not too bad.

Loved this dish! Both hubby and I enjoyed it. The only change was I used ground chicken.  It was what I had on hand. Excellent choice. I added a few Italian spices while sauteing the chicken. 
My husband suggested some crumbs on top next time for added texture.  He's been listening to that food channel a lot. LOL

I have tried this recipe twice. The first time, I followed it exactly as is and it turned out to be a good meal. I would have rated it a 3/5 Stars. My family ate it and said that it was “okay” but, not a show stopper. The complaints were that there was way too much spinach and the chicken was a bit bland, too chunky and there wasn’t enough of it. I allowed it to cool for a bit before serving but, it still fell apart when it was dished out so the presentation wasn’t visually appealing. The second time that I made it I made a few adjustments that helped to boost the rating to 4/5 Stars. This time, I only used 1 package of spinach, a much better ratio according to my audience. I also marinated the chicken overnight in 1/4 c olive oil, 1 T minced garlic, 1/2 t coarse salt, 1/2 t ground pepper, 1/4 t oregano, 1/4 t basil, and 1 T fresh parsley. I grilled the chicken and then shredded it this time instead of cubing it like the recipe suggested. It seemed to blend in better this way and you didn’t end up biting into any big chunks of chicken. I added 1 beaten egg, 1/2 t salt and 1 t fresh parsley to the ricotta mixture. This seemed to help hold everything together nicely and made the presentation more appealing without a noticeable difference to the flavor of the dish. To summarize, I will make this recipe again with the alterations but, it didn’t go over well enough in my family to make it into our permanent rotation.

I don’t necessarily agree that this was bland, but I do think that perhaps something key was missing from the dish. That said, it was tasty! Nice and cheesy. And a lot of work. I didn’t make very many changes but I did up the garlic to 1.5 teaspoons (1 tsp equals 1 clove). I didn’t use parsley on top but had so much spinach left over that I ended up sprinkling some on top in place of the parsley. I used chicken thighs cooked in olive oil. If I were to make this again, I might add some additional depth of flavor by adding mushrooms and/or perhaps even some spice with a sprinkling of hot pepper flakes.

This was absolutely delicious!  My daughter wanted me to meet some of her friends so I invited them over to dinner and made this.  They all loved it...even the ones who "hate spinach".  I made it as written but I think the next time I make this, I will saute the chicken in garlic infused olive oil and use fresh spinach instead of frozen.

Smells amazing, I tasted the cheese sauce before I assembled and it has TONS of flavor! It does take a lot of dishes to prep the ingredients, and I halved the recipe so it was a lot of extra thinking and math for the ingredients that were divided. Would definitely make again, just need to plan ahead to have ample prep time.

I made a larger/huge lasagna by adjusting this recipe. Increased the sauce by 50%.Used 12 lasagna noodles, a large container ricotta, and used much more mozzarella & parm. (I may try 15 noodles next time, 5 on three layers.) I increased garlic to 3 cloves & used all fresh herbs. I cooked up 16oz baby spinach and a large container mushrooms in two separate pans. I also cooked three large chicken breasts sprinkled with all seasoning in a pan too. I mixed the spinach, mushrooms & ricotta together. I layered sauce, then noodles, ricotta, chicken, sauce, mozzarella & parm twice and then a little sauce on top sprinkled with parm & fresh parsley. I also broiled the top after baking to brown.

I used canned white chicken and didn't have any basil on hand. I also misread the instructions and ended up not using all of the ricotta cheese. Despite those changes, it was a very tasty dish and one that my husband really likes.

Delicious! Second time making it and worked out both times. Seems to take longer than posted, but probably because I cook my chicken at the same time. Took about an hour to make and then 35 minutes of cooking. I always use far less ricotta than mentioned, maybe about half a cup (since there is only one layer of it).

Being this is the second time I am making this I switched it up with using one bag of fresh spinach and some fresh sliced mushrooms. I sautéed the spinach and the mushrooms together and added the spinach to the ricotta cheese as other reviewer suggested. Was way better the second time! Also used fresh basil and parsley and omitted the salt. Parmesan cheese has plenty of salt! Yummy ;)

I used fresh grated Parmesan cheese and put an italian seasoning on the chicken ; let bake for 50- 60 minutes. I also mixed the chicken & spinach together and had 2 layers of mixed instead of 1 layer of chicken and 1 layer of spinach, much better this way.

I made this as lasagna roll ups instead of a traditional lasagna.  Adjusted the quantities since I only made 8 rolls: 4 with spinach and 4 without (due to picky husband) and I also used ground chicken instead of the cubed chicken.  Came out really good, but probably next time I will put the broiler on during the last minutes (for presentation purposes)

I used no boil noodles, but wouldn't recommend it, especially for the top layer of noodles because they didn't get soft enough and I had to poke holes and add at least 3/4 cup of broth the get it softer. I used a lot more basil, oregano, pepper and salt to get more flavor. I tasted the sauce until I loved it. The layering instructions were vague at first, but I ended up with sauce, noodles, all of the ricotta, I added roasted red pepper, all of the chicken, noodles, sauce, fresh chopped spinach (about 8 oz), cheeses, noodles, remaining sauce, dried parsley and cheese. I tented the lasagna until the end to brown. Served with a salad and garlic bread. I would make this again. It was flavorful to my liking and wasn't overly cheesy.

This is rich & creamy. It thickens as it sits. Not like in the video. I added mushrooms to the spinach layer. I Made this for a church event and everyone loved it. I brought home an empty dish.

It was amazing! I did add a bit of seasoning to the chicken (garlic and onion powder and a bit of seasoned salt) and garlic and onion powder to the sauce mix. I followed one of the other reviews and added carrots and zucchini. With those additions it was AMAZING!!

Best lasagna I've ever made. I mixed the chicken, spinach, and ricotta together to make the layering easier, and next time I'll ease up on the cheese as I felt like it was too much.

I was looking for a white chicken lasagna recipe and chose this one based on the homemade roux base and fresh chicken.  It was a good recipe and cheesy however too bland and would require adding some basic seasonings to the sauteed chicken in the pan (crushed black pepper/salt at the very least).  

Also, I did add crushed red pepper flakes, fresh parsley, and crushed black pepper to the roux .  As well as substituted fresh baby spinach over frozen spinach.  

My dinner guests enjoyed the white cheese chicken lasagna and two pieces were left that were up for grabs as leftovers!  Thank you for always providing a solid foundation and good recipes for us!

This recipe turned out great.  I made as directed except I cut the spinach down to only one package, which ended up being perfect for our family’s tastes.  I will definitely add this to my regular rotation.

The flavor got better over ort of a chicken & dumplings taste. Layers do separate. I’d make it again.

Great recipe! The only thing I changed was adding more garlic and using less spinach. I wish I would have swapped the frozen spinach for fresh but there's always next time! I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was really labor intensive!!!  I was glad I had all \Saturday to play with this.  I was also disappointed with the flavor, it was rather flavorless.  It was good, but a little too much work for too little reward.

Since I had never tried this one before, I followed the recipe precisely. It was great. Everyone cleaned their plates and asked for more. I think when I do this again, I will go with more of a carbonara flavor profile by adding some bacon into the cheesy sauce. This one is a winner. I'll do it again and again.

my family rated this as just okay. The sauce could have been a little thinner for our taste.  I only used one box of spinach and 3 medium boiled chicken breasts. ingredients went together easily and it looked beautiful when cooked.i also used the no bake noodles.

Overall, it was a decent meal.  I only used 1 pkg spinach which was plenty.   Unfortunately, I think we should have left the spinach completely out of it and it would have been much better.

I absolutely loved this lasagna recipe! I’m not big on tomato sauce so the white cheese sauce  was right up my alley! The taste was great. I followed the recipe as listed and only added a can of diced tomatoes, a can of sliced mushrooms and fresh spinach instead of frozen. Turned out great! I will definitely make it again soon! Yummy.

I followed the recipe to a T except I used Kettle & Fire chicken mushroom bone broth instead of chicken stock.  The white sauce for this recipe is TO DIE FOR and the lasagne was delicious, even my very picky teenage daughter loved it.   The only change I would make is, to use fresh spinach and sauté it with some olive or avocado oil, onion & garlic.  The frozen spinach has a nice texture in the recipe but in my opinion is a bit bland.  This is a keeper and if you’re looking for an impressive dish to bring to a potluck this is it!

Great dish. Brought it to a Italian Heritage night dinner meeting, got rave reviews.
I substituted skinless,boneless chicken thighs sprayed with olive oil,  and seasoned with salt,  pepper,  and garlic powder and baked in the oven at 325 for 25 minutes. Cubed the chicken thighs after cooking. I also substituted rigatoni macaroni for lasagna, lots easier to serve.

If I could give this 6 or 7 stars, I would.  WOW!!!!!  It's a flavor explosion in your mouth!  The only thing I would do differently next time is salt the layer of spinach instead of the sauce.  MY COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEF!

This was good but not specially.  I made it for a large family dinner and though feedback was fairly positive, no one asked for seconds so there were leftovers in spite of 9 at the table.  Considering how time consuming and expensive this recipe is, I will not make it again.

I agree with other reviews that it requires less spinach. I mixed sauce,  spinach and chicken and layered lasagna noodles, sauce mixture and cheese. Next time I will layer as suggested. Excellent recipe.

Extremely decadent and delicious for a winter evening. This is classic comfort food. I used oven-ready gluten free noodles and it worked well, however, the top layer of noodles overcooked a bit.

Yeah, I didn't get it.  I mean it sounds like it should be amazing but I found it pretty boring.  I even tried using the recommendation of fresh baby spinach and to make it even better, sautéed it with some chopped bacon and added it bits and all.  The only thing I can think I should have done was taken EVERY suggestion and implemented it.  It just was super bland.  Cheesy but bland.

Very good! I reduced the total cheese by 2 cups and still seemed like too much cheese. I also used more of the oregano and basil. I think I'll try again with less cheese and include some artichokes!

I used fresh spinach (2 lbs.) as it has so much more flavor than frozen.  I cooked the spinach down ahead of time then followed the recipe as directed.  This was a rich and comforting dinner on a snowy night--I'll make it again.

It was delicious tasting but a disaster as lasagne.  Way to runny sauce, stayed soupy. I used fresh spinach and it cooked up great but couldn't get it to firm up. I'll probably try it one more time because the sauce was tasty.

The recipe should add to refrigerate the casserole overnight before cooking. All of these flavors are very mild and need that time to blend. Before cooking, I also added mushrooms that I had sauteed in wine and butter and a little cream cheese to give it some kick.

I made a healthier version—I omitted the butter and one of the cheeses, added mushrooms and used fresh instead of frozen spinach... It was so delicious and the whole family loved it!
I will make it again, soon!

I have to say, my family wasn't loving this.  It was missing something and tasted very bland even after I used fresh basil. Maybe it needs more salt.  Not sure. I wanted to love it but I don't.

Amazingly good.   Family loved it.  I made it almost as written with very minor changes that won't  have changed the taste all that much.  I used fresh spinach cooked with a little olive oil and pesto, and instead of ricotta cheese, I used cottage cheese in its place, which made it a little more juicy, the way we like  our lasagna.  YUM!

I forgot the ricotta, but added a quarter of a chopped red pepper and some cremini mushrooms sautéed in garlic. I used chopped fresh spinach. Tasty! It was pretty goopy so I baked it for an additional 10 minutes.

Awesome recipe!! I only changed the way I cooked the chicken! I added coconut oil into a frying pan cut chicken breasts into 1/2 inch strips fried on high till no longer pink added salt and pepper, garlic and kicked chicken spice from McCormack’s!! The rest was pretty much following the recipe, possibly a little more Parmesan and mozzarella cheese!! 5stars

Being on a gluten-free diet makes it difficult to have pasta in my diet. But when I found gluten-free, oven-ready lasagna I thought I had found a solution. I made a lasagna with a recipe on the pasta box and it was pretty good. Then this white lasagna came in my AllRecipies.com Email and I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, the white sauce was not moist enough to cook the lasagna and it came out hard and chewy. In addition, the sauce was rather bland, even with all that cheese. I grated my own mozzarella and parmesana so those were fresh, I love ricotta and was looking forward to having lasagna with real ricotta. After all that anticipation, I was really disappointed.

I’ve had this recipe for years and it is always a hit. You do NOT have to boil the noodles first, nor do you need to use no-boil noodles if you hate that step. There is enough sauce that the noodles will cook in it and get al dente, not overdone.

I followed the recipe and it was okay to me, my picky 9 year old loved it. I didn't add salt to the recipe because I seasoned the chicken prior to cooking. I also used a 120z bag of frozen chopped spinach. I will make this again, but I will make minor adjustments to improve the taste for my family.

This is in response to kjs261.  Recipe calls for 2 cups cubed chicken meat and 2 10 oz. packages of frozen spinach thawed and drained.  Didn't try this yet but i know i would love it.  Will give proper review when i make it.   Made this today.  i chose to use only 2 layers of lasagna noodles and because i eat a ton of chicken, i omitted it.  i don't eat spinach often so this was a great recipe to include it.  Cheese makes everything delish.  enjoyed it much.  only 4 stars because i didn't follow recipe to a T.

This is definitely one to make again. I did add more cheese than it called for, and I didn't use spinach. I used a mix of vegetables that I knew my family would like.  Mushrooms, etc.  I also used the fresh pasta sheets, which I like better and as a plus it saves washing a pot!  I would definitely recommend!

I made this last night with leftover  chicken from Costco.  I added a raw egg to the drained spinach and another to the ricotta cheese.
I did not use as much cheese.   I used fresh parmesan on the top and placed the dish under the broiler to crisp up the top.It was firm and easy to cut and serve.  I would make again.  Would be terrific as comfort food for a large crowd.  Lots leftover.

Needs a bit of tweaking. The cheese sauce ends up super thick following the directions as is.

I don't know why people rate this recipe low because of the sauce being thick - it says right in the title "White CHEESE Chicken Lasagna", of course the sauce will be thick! I was looking for a  homemade white lasagna recipe similar to the Stauffer's my family first liked and this is perfect. I have two eaters that don't love red sauce so I typically make a regular lasagna and this one, too. I have left out the chicken to make it vegetarian as well. I usually make it exactly like the recipe and the family loves it!

This is tasty.  It's a lot of trouble, as lasagna usually is, but it is worth it occasionally.

I am used to buying Stouffer's white cheese chicken lasagna but decided to recreate it myself.  I chose this recipe and made it last night.  It was good.  I will make a couple of changes next time.  I will use fresh chopped spinach instead of frozen one.  I will also add a few seasoning to the chicken and cheese mixture before putting it in the oven. n  Other than those small changes, everything else was good.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us.

Yum! I changed up the layering a little so each layer had chicken and sauce, and I added mushrooms (my 6yo's fav), but otherwise kept as is. I'm trying to find more ways to get my 6yo to eat chicken other than covered in ketchup, and she had 3 plates of this dish so I call it a win! Will make again.

This was so delicious! My family love it and asked if I could make it again! I followed the recipe on everything except I didn't use chicken, I used kale. I also added chopped broccoli and carrots to the onion and garlic. This was just what I wanted my veggie lasagna to taste like!

Excellent recipe. It came out way better than I thought it would. My only change would be to shred the chicken instead of cube.

Gluten-Free adapted and delicious! I use Tinkyada rice pasta and Pamela's GF flour mix to substitute any recipe with excellent results. **Slightly under cook the Tinkyada lasagna noodles, drain, and fill pot with cool water until ready to assemble. They are easier to handle with less breaking.** I combine the chicken/ricotta/cheese sauce together like CARDOZOS suggested for easier layering. I also use fresh, RAW spinach  -- NO cooking it ahead of time. It always turns out excellent, but I suggest greasing your pan very well. I've made this several times with little tweaks  (like sauteing mushrooms with the onion) Delicious every time!!

I tried this recipe today. I used a rotisserie chicken I shredded, added only Parmesan cheese to sauce, added ricotta cheese with spinach to the layers as well as the mozzarella. Last layer was just the sauce, mozzarella and cheese...This turned out delicious!

Perfect recipe for bringing to lunch for the week.  Easy to make & bake.  Clean-Up is a bit of a chore, but overall not as hard as some of the recipes that I've tried, but the fact that it's both filling and tasty is enough to forget the chore.

The flavor is subtle, but I don't think it is too bland.  One thing I did was use the same pan I browned the chicken in to make the sauce with the browned bits and added another clove of garlic.  I also used a 16 oz. package of frozen spinach and that was enough.

Followed the recipe to the letter, didn't change a thing. (That's the only way I review recipes anymore. Makes zero sense to make a dozen alterations and then review my own unique recipe. That helps no one.)

I honestly preferred the bites without a chicken chunk in it. Think I will use half the amount of chicken next time, dice them smaller, or use none at all and just serve chicken breast on the side. Honestly though, I had cooked, diced, and refrigerated the chicken breast over 24 hours prior because I had originally planned to use it for something different, and I think that made a difference in how the chicken tasted in the lasagna. I think the chicken needs to be used super fresh, right away after cooking, unrefrigerated. I also prefer cottage cheese to ricotta in my lasagna. Will go back to that next time as well.

Excellent! Will double the sauce next time. Used 2 cups milk, 1 cup broth, more garlic too. Not as good the next day like usual lasagna. Can't wait to make it again!

I felt this dish was fairly bland. I made it exactly as the recipe directed, but it needs something more to amp up the flavor. I don’t think I’ll make it again.

Very good. I followed another's advice and used fresh spinach, sautéed until wilted, and mixed in with my ricotta. I also had some asiago cheese to use up so a half cup of that went into the sauce. Overall the dish was delicious, if a bit heavy.

This was really good!
I didn't have enough mozzarella, so I used some cheddar. Definitely the best choice.
Might add some bacon next time and season the chicken before  hand. 
rich but light and it was a hit with my family!

For as much time and effort this recipe takes, I don't think it was worth it. It turned out to taste very bland. It didn't taste bad, it just didn't have much flavor. I even seasoned the chicken well.

This was really good.  I saute my chicken breast in butter and seasoning.  I then deglazed the pan with white wine and scraped up all the bits.  I used that liquid as part of my broth.  I will for sure make this again.

Reduced butter to 6 Tablespoons and used a little bit less mozzarella cheese than called for.  I could only find a 16 ounce package of spinach and it was just the right amount.  I also used fresh basil and oregano and more than called for.   The whole family enjoyed it. This is a winner and I will definitely make it again.

I really liked the flavor. I made it with my gluten free noodles and it came out great. I think I will cut the chicken up a little smaller next time. I used some of my own favorite seasoning in it  to bring the flavor out a little more. Such as Beau Mont and Herbamare.

This is a dish I make for guests and my gentleman.

I found a couple ways to make this less messy and labor intensive
1. I use no boil lasagna noodles
2. I make 1 1/2 times the Alfredo sauce for the absorption in the pasta, it prevents the dish drying out using the no boil pasta.
3. I'm not a fan of picking spinach out of my teeth when entertaining. I layer it with smaller cut broccoli flowerets, thicker cut sliced fresh mushrooms and loads of chicken.

Use whatever you like in the sauce. Follow your personal tastes in cheeses, garlic, etc.

So awesome!  Will definitely make again.  Only problem I had is understanding that ALL the ricotta and ALL the chicken goes in at one time. We layered it and it still came out superb!

I will make it again.  Changes were minor.  Added mushrooms to the onion and garlic.  Used 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 italian cheese.  Used cottage cheese instead of the ricotta.

My family  loved it.  I let it sit for 10 minutes so it firmed up allot . 
Reminds me of a comfort food like Mac and Cheese.   I do agree that it is cheesy.   Yes I will make it again.

There was just something of on this recipe.  We followed suggestions of reviews which are all appreciated .  not exactly sure what, but for two lasagna lovers, it was difficult to make ourselves eat it as leftovers.

I absolutely loved it. I didn't add the chicken broth, and I combined the ricotta with the chicken for easy layering.  I will definitely make again. Thank you.

i made this as written, but it seemed bland.  I could not fit it all in the pan and I didn't use all the broccoli.  The sauce was so sticky and stringy that it was hard to get out of the pan into the baking dish.  If I make this again I will revise it after reading some of the reviews.  The layers came apart when I tried to serve it and did the same thing the second meal. It was ok, but I don't know if it was worth the cost, the mess and the clean up after.

This was delicious!  Not for the dairy intolerant though.  And with the prep time, I wouldn't make it after work as a weeknight meal.  Having said that though, it really was delish!

I made some modifications based on other reviewers....
--First, I used a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach sautéed in olive oil with salt and pepper instead of frozen spinach.
--Second, I used oven ready lasagna noodles.
--Third, I added 1 tsp nutmeg to the sauce because spinach and bechemel sauce needs nutmeg.
--Fourth, I added a layer of sautéed vegetables.  Specifically, I added 1 c. Shredded carrots, 1 c. Chopped zucchini, and 8 oz sliced mushrooms.  I sautéed in olive oil with salt and pepper.
--Lastly, I used rotisserie chicken. 

My husband loved it!  When I asked him what would he change he said, "why would you change anything.  It's perfect!"  Quite the endorsement!

I used heavy whipping cream instead of the milk and omitted the salt. I also used fresh spinach, peas and carrots for some extra color and flavor. Next time, I would also probably add mushrooms, and maybe some spicy chicken.  Otherwise, it was very good.  Good lasagna for summertime, not very heavy.

This was amazing! I made one small change by replacing the spinach with broccoli...not a fan of spinach! Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious. This came together pretty easily and it freezes really well, which is important for those of us cooking for one or two people.

I made the dish following the recipe, and it turned out great. I had a side dish of steamed green beans. I froze most of it. Word to the wise: If you freeze pasta, then let it thaw for at least several hours before placing it in the microwave. That way, it still turns out pretty good.

Excellent!  Halved recipe. Baked in 8x9 casserole dish. Needed to be covered for first 30 minutes. I used no-cook lasagne noodles. I would use regular lasagne noodle and pre-cook them next time. Or dice chicken very fine, mix all ingredients, and stuff large shells with mixture. Cover with white sauce.

It seemed like a dish with this much cheese just HAD to be good... but unfortunately nobody in the family liked it very much.  It wasn't really very flavorful... just cheesy.

I love this recipe! I did everything according to the recipe, except two minor details. I used fresh spinach and I mixed the ricotta cheese and chicken together before spreading it. I'm not a ricotta fan, so it seemed to mask it a little for me. Such an amazing recipe!!!!

I followed this recipe and written and my family loved it.  The only thing I'll do differently is add more chicken.  Delicious!!

Made this with frozen broccoli instead of the spinach and tri coloured tortellini in place of the lasagna noodles.  family said it's a keeper.

I loved this! I used ziti because I was out of lasagna noodles. I thought the spices were a little heavy, i don't know if that's because i forgot the spinach and used rounded teaspoons though. Either way, it was delicious!

While the flavor is amazing, it's just too rich.  I always substitute butter with coconut solid oil and milk with coconut milk for all dishes and casseroles I make. The difference is unbelievable.  Basically you don't feel like you're faking to keel over st the end of consumption.  I can't even imagine it being worse with the bitter and the milk. Recipes like this are responsibility for heart disease and our obesity epidemic in this country.  Also I'm too old to be eating something this over saturated.  With that said, I am still glad I made it cause indefinitely will revamp.  I will reduce the mozzarella cheese to the sauce and half that.  I will make the layer with the spinach with mushrooms and replace the third mozzarella layer to zucchini yellow and green squash and perhaps add some carrots or broccoli.  I would also add more chicken as the chicken tasted great in that sauce.

I really liked this one, lots of flavor! I used Montreal Steak Spicy for my seasoning. We served one over a bed of romaine with the cooked marinade as dressing. One we served with rice, very easy to serve it different within the same meal.

2 nights after fixing it, everything came together and melded and it was amazing.    As written it is probably a 4.0, but it is a good stepping stone to something even better.  I followed step 1 as written, leave cooked noodles covered in cold water until ready for them.  I followed step 2 as written, but put 20 oz of fresh, chopped spinach in to wilt with onions after they had softened, added 1-2 cups of fresh portabella mushrooms, 1 tablespoon minced garlic (jar) then continued with remaining step 2.  I think you can probably do it either way - combine spinach with onions or layer separately.

For step 3 I have never been a big Ricotta fan.  By itself it is pretty bland.  For this recipe I combined 2 cups Ricotta with one cup cottage cheese and 1 cup of feta cheese.  After the flavors melded it gave more depth to the cheese layer flavor.  I used 4 cups cubed rotisserie chicken with skin and drippings and added McCormick's  Montreal Chicken Seasoning to give the chicken more kick.  Naturally I also doubled the herbs.   I layered as per the recipe and used a 9 x 13" aluminum foil dish, BUT one with 4 inch sides instead of the usual low sided glass casseroles.   That was the only way to get the recipe into one pan and it worked GREAT!!  It was good from the very 1st night - but was amazing by the 3rd night.  The chicken had great flavor and punch, and the cheese was sophisticated and sublime.   I may never go back to Italian lasagna again!  Try chicken sausage next time instea

Delicious sauce!  I used fresh baby spinach "steamed" in the microwave, and sautéed some chopped mushrooms and finely diced carrots with the onions.  This recipe is a keeper!

I used this recipe as a jumping off point for my own version of chicken lasagna.  I think it came out fantastic with my modifications.  First of all, I used six oven-ready lasagna noodles and made the dish in two layers instead of three.  I made the white sauce with 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup flour, tons of garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper, basil, 1.5 cups of milk, 1/2 cup white wine, and 1.5 cups of broth.  Once it bubbled and thickened I stirred in 1/3 cup of grated parmesan, 2 cups shredded chicken, and one box of chopped frozen spinach (that I cooked ahead and squeezed all the excess water out of).  I set this mixture aside. I did not add ANY of the mozzarella to the white sauce. Then, I mixed 2.5 cups of ricotta with 2 beaten eggs, 1/2 cup of grated parmesan, salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder (the addition of eggs makes the ricotta bind a bit better and makes it bake fluffier in the dish).  I sprayed a 9X13 pan with cooking spray and laid three oven-ready noodles across the bottom,  I then layered half my ricotta mixture, one third of the shredded mozzarella, and then half of the milk/chicken/spinach mix.  I repeated this layer one more time and then used the final third of the cheese on top.  I baked it covered for 30 minutes and then uncovered for 25 more (at 375 degrees).  The final lasagna was luscious and loaded with flavor!  I think changing the layer construction, using less spinach, more garlic, eggs, and wine in place of some of the broth greatly improves

It was okay. It definitely needed something because it didn't seem like it had much flavour. I put some chipotle hot sauce on it and it instantly tasted better, but it was still pretty whatever. I can see why kids would like it though, as far as I'm concerned, kids have always liked plain/bland food, so if I had kids, sure I would make it for them, but personally I wouldn't make it for myself.

I really enjoyed this recipe, a nice changeup from traditional lasagna. My kids picked at the spinach but seemed to enjoy it anyway. Next time I'll probably leave the spinach off half for them.

This was very good and pretty easy. I really liked that it called for making a cheese sauce rather than just sprinkling the cheese because it covered better that way. I used parboiled noodles and fresh spinach (1/2 a bag-- probably could have used more.) Also added some artichoke hearts and sliced sweet peppers that we needed to use up. Leftovers reheated very well for a tasty lunch the next day.

This is a definite keeper (had 5 different foodie friends try it) with the modifications I made. FRESH spinach & mushrooms for starters. Also had to completely improvise on how I cooked my chicken, as this recipe gives no info on that, other than how much. I went super simple, as to keep the flavor a true to the recipe. A little olive oil in my pan and salt and peppered four chicken breasts only! Also, took them out after they were still slightly pink (not fully cooked) as to not dry out my meat, knowing they'd keep cooking through as they rested. And once in sauce, they'd finish completely! Great plan, the chicken was moist and delicious!

Loved this recipe. I did not have ricotta cheese, so I used cottage cheese, and added it right to sauce mixture. I also added 1 egg and 1 can cream of chicken soup. Used provolone cheese because I was out of mozzarella.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  It took about one hour to prep everything and another half hour to assemble the layers, but definitely worth the effort.  The next time I have company I will definitely be serving this dish.  Note:  I made sure I squeezed all the moisture out of the spinach by hand after I defrosted and drained both boxes of spinach to make sure the sauce didn't get watered down.

LOVED IT! I used whole grain lasagna and there was no difference.  I used a full 8oz bag of fresh spinach. I like Cardozos' idea of  mixing the spinach, ricotta and chicken. It was time consuming with the layers.

Had a nice flavour.  I listened to other reviewers & used no bake lasagna noodle.  I would not use them again.  Seem to get lost in the dish & made it mushy. I should've listened to someone else about the layering.  The directions on the layering didn't seem right.  Next time I will layer like my regular lasagna recipe.   I would make again

I made 1/2 recipe. Very tasty and savory. A change from the red lasagna. Still had moisture in the bottom.

I didn't care for this dish. It was so, so heavy and sat in my stomach like a brick, and there was just no depth of flavour due to the exorbitant amounts of cheese flavouring this dish and little else. Also, the amount of ricotta called for gave parts of this dish an unpleasant gritty texture. Really disappointed, especially given the expense and effort involved; won't make again.

This recipe has become a family holiday favorite!  I make it just as the recipe is written, but I use cottage cheese rather than ricotta cheese.  It is a rather "steppy" recipe, but worth all of the work!

Great recipe, next time I'd use broccoli/cauliflower instead of spinach.
 It would also be excellent to substitute seafood for the chicken and make a seafood lasagna.

It was too bland for my tastes. I will make again, but check the seasoning more before I put it all together. Other than that, it's a good basic recipe!

Wish I would have covered it with foil for half the cooking time because it was borderline dry. 

Other than that, delicious! I doubled the garlic and used pressure cooked chicken that I shredded instead of cubed chicken. I will absolutely make this again, and next time I'll add grated carrot too!

Cut small pieces. Super rich but oh so delish! I would pay close attention because in the recipe ALL the chicken & ricotta goes on the first layer and ALL the spinach goes in the second layer. Two pkg's of spinach is too much. Use 1 1/2. I split the ricotta in two layers. Only because it is dry.

Loved it but a lot of work putting it together!!! Browned the chicken and then seasoned with the spices to add more flavor to the chicken. Also added mushrooms and broccoli , will definitely make it again.

Really yummy. I used raw spinach and wilted it with the chicken and some minced garlic before adding the ricotta to that mix.
Sauce was made as written.  Will definitely make it again.

This lasagna is DELICIOUS. My husband went nuts over it. I thought the instructions for layering seemed a little odd, but went with it, and am very happy with how it turned out! I do think however that you could layer this lasagna pretty much any way you want and it'd still turn out delish....

I thought it was a little dry at 40 min. wasn't quite done. I would increase or maybe make the sauce a little looser and have extra when it's completely done. I also substituted coconut milk.

It turned out dry as a bone.  I used no-bake noodles and for the frozen spinach, I used fresh. When it came out of the oven, it had a beautiful crust but there was no bubbling. I will probably cook this again because I am stubborn.

I used fresh spinach and added fresh mushrooms both of which I sautéed in butter. I took another reviewers advice and used Tyson grilled and ready frozen diced chicken and I used fat free mozzarella cheese and reduced fat ricotta and Parmesan. I don't know, maybe it was the changes but it just seemed like it was lacking something.  I probably won't be making it again anytime soon, at least not that version of it.

Perfection for me!  I am newly allergic to tomatoes and have been missing a hearty lasagna!  This fit the bill and more.  My 4 yr old who is also allergic to tomatoes ate two servings and said, "Mama, this is amazing, we can EAT IT!"  It's a keeper, as is.  My two oldest, 15 and 13, prepared most of it as well, so not terribly hard for advanced beginner cooks.

Delicious! Everyone raved! Made it exactly as written. Next time, I think I'll add roasted red peppers to the layers. Used a rotisserie chicken for ease and dried parsley instead of fresh. Will make again and again!

This was so yummy! It has lotsa flavour. 

I used 400g of fresh spinach, 4 cloves of garlic, 18 noodles, 2 lb chicken, and sprinkled the spinach and ricotta layer with generous amount of garlic salt and Italian seasoning. 

I split the lasagna into two batches 10x8x3 and froze one. To cook: thaw for 2 days. Bake 350 covered for 60 minutes and uncovered 450 for 10.

It takes some time to whip up the cheese sauce and layer but well worth it! There is never any left and is truly one of my favorite dishes!

I must agree -- this recipe is quite good. It's also quite rich, so bear that in mind!The only things I'd change:

I'd double the spinach and shred the chicken so it's more apt to soak up the cream sauce.

Excellent excellent excellent!!! This recipe restored my faith in making lasagna. I first tried when I was 20 years old and sadly didnt know I was supposed to cook the noodles first lol! what i it was my first apt and I was determined leaving home did not have to mean fast food.  Anyway. 20 years later I decided to try again with this recipie and it came out great. My coworker raved about it. This was a great recipie to try again. Thanks to the submitter for my restored confidence.

This recipe was a hit! I took some of the others advice and only used half the spinach. I also shredded my chicken instead of cutting it into cubes (just my personal preference).  Other than that I kept everything else just as the recipe called for. I will be making this again!

This was sooooo good! I didn't stray too far from the original recipe. I subbed what I had on hand like fresh spinach instead of frozen and a combination of heavy cream and milk instead of  just all milk. I used less cheese than what was called for in the sauce and added some Monterey  Jack cheese in the layering process. I had enough to make two dishes and froze one for a later date.  Will definitely be making this recipe again and will be sure to make when we have company. This recipe is a definite keeper. Thank you!

I decided to make the recipe pretty much the way it was written.  The only 2 changes I made were 4 cloves of garlic and I mixed the ricotta and chicken together.  It was delicious!
I work and make dinner pretty much every week night.  On Wednesdays my father and father-in-law come for dinner.  This was a huge hit!  Just a tip to make the prep easier, I used precut white onion (need to be chopped a little finer) and rotisserie chicken.  Just saves a little time.

Yummy, and forgiving. Didn't have ricotta, used Velveeta. Used sharp cheddar for half the mozzarella. Used half the spinach and substituted parsley for basil.  Still great.

I followed all directions, except only added 1 package of spinach. I felt 2 would be too much. Will definitely make again since my family loved it,including my picky 13 yr old! My husband raved and said he felt like he was out at restaurant! Only other suggestion or modification I would make ,would be adding just a little more garlic and pepper!

I liked the recipe but I made changes as I went along.  I used one more head of garlic, used one more cup of chicken, which I seasoned,  and used  only one package of spinach.  I would have given it five stars, except it definitely needed more garlic than what I used.  So as is I imagine it would be too bland.

I would have to try this again because I accidentally left out one layer of ricotta.  The way I made it (with 1 missing ricotta layer) it was kid of heavy and over cheesey.  It also needed a little more flavor, maybe garlic salt.  I made it for a holiday party as an alternative to a meat lasagna and it went over well with my guests, but I wasn't sold.

I boiled 3 chicken breasts in chicken broth before shredding it to give it extra flavor. Then, I boiled the spinach in the the leftover broth ( making sure it was very well drained before using). Since my family loves garlic (can't stress this enough), I added a an extra clove to saute and a teaspoon of garlic powder to the sauce. I also made an herb bread from this site to go with it. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing my house smelled! This recipe was a huge hit! Definitely going in the recipe box.

I'm by no means a health-nut, nor a super experienced cook but I can hold my own in the 'general' realm....just a regular guy, so keep that in mind.  I made per the instructions, and the very bland, dry cubed chicken breast was THE ingredient that totally down-turned this recipe.  Otherwise, it has a superb flavor.  Next time I will boil up my usual skinless chicken quarters with onion and garlic salt, de-bone and make from there.  The breast totally ruined this for me - ZERO flavor there.  But, I will try this again with my chicken because in my experience I think this COULD be good....really.

I have a larger lasagna pan (this would not fit in a 9x13 pan) and use 12 noodles soaked in boiling water for 30 minutes and layered lengthwise and crosswise alternately in the pan.  One package of frozen leaf spinach, thawed, drained and cut up with kitchen shears, is perfect.  It is a time-consuming dish but worth the effort.  Served with a salad and bread,  my family loved it - even the little kids ate it and asked for seconds.  Leftovers are just as good.  It is a keeper for me.

Used more garlic, added nutmeg to the sauce & as suggested mixed the spinach, chicken & ricotta/cottage cheese together before layering. I also used no cook lasagne & it worked just fine.

Tasty.  I cut cheese amounts down, but then added 2 cups ricotta + 1egg  mixed into the spinach layer.  I made the chicken broth with carrot, celery, more basil/oregano and added 1/2 cup pumpkin (takes on flavor of anything you cook it in) to the broth.  Added a splash of wine.   Used a lasagna pan - so made mine 4 layers high.  Yum.

Wow, this was so good!  I only made a few, small changes.  I used Gouda cheese as well as mozzarella.  I added more garlic because we love garlic.  I also used fresh spinach and a rotisserie chicken from Costco, which saved lots of time.  I will make this again and again, a winner in our house!

We found this very bland.  I may try it again using some of the tweaks suggested in the reviews - bechamel, nutmeg, heavier on the parmesean, lighter on the mozzarella, etc.  But as-is, we didn’t bother saving for leftovers.

I thought the recipe was worded a little odd in the assembly... But it all turned out. I doubled the recipe. It took 1.5 hours to cook. Everyone liked it.

Its cooking now and only time will tell but while prepping I noticed the sauce is very thick, I had just enough.  I used less cheese because of the thickness but I think it's the flour content that's driving the thickness.  I followed to a tee aside from using fresh spinach, and hope its tasty.  My cooked chicken was rotisserie from market.  Prep is alot but sure hope it tastes as good as it smells.

This was a 1st attempt for me; but as usual I deviated from the recipe by doing things differently and adding extras.  First, when making the sauce, I added garlic herb marinade; next, I added freshly sliced mushrooms and leftover Thanksgiving turkey to make the dish more hearty; lastly, I added two beaten eggs and sour cream to the cheese and spinach mixture for added creaminess.    Overall the recipe was a success and very tasty.

I made recipie as is except used fresh spinach and added extra garlic. For the effort lasagna takes I'd suggest sticking with the original. This is good, but a bit bland.

This turned out quite nicely! I especially loved the cream sauce. It was different. 

Admittedly I misunderstood the directions and didn't cook the chicken before baking in the lasagna. I got worried but it was too late to turn back. So I turned down the temp slightly and made sure I cooked to an internal temp of art least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. It turned out great and was cooked through and moist! 

Will definitely do again and next time possibly add bacon.

Loved this recipe! I halved this recipe but, would use more than 1 cup chicken next time. I also shredded the chicken instead of cubing it. I also added zucchini, mushrooms, julienned carrots.

With the exception of using fresh spinach, (instead of frozen), I made the recipe as written. Ultimately, the spinach was the highlight of the dish for me. As a cheese lover, I liked the flavor, but realized there can be too much of a good thing. In this case, way too much.

I made it per the recipe. I used no cook noodles which was a mistake. My 7 year old daughter was turned off by the spinach. If I used regular noodles I would have given it a three 1/2 stars. I thought it was bland. More garlic was needed.

I made this for a wedding shower along with a traditional lasagna and this one was gone in an instant! Everyone loved it, I'll be adding it to my list of "entertaining" meals for sure.  It was easy to make, I prepped it the day before and kept it in the fridge and then just tossed it in the oven prior to everyone's arrival.

This was a good departure from standard red sauce lasagna. I baked a chicken breast and used that for the chicken requirement. The white sauce was very good, but made so much. I reserved some of it and used in a tuna casserole the next day.

Fantastic!! I used more chicken then the recipe called for and I didn't layer it exactly as the directions called for. Overall it still came out great!! In the future I think I might use more chicken broth and milk for the sauce mixture, very Rich!!

Awesome! I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen and aged cheddar instead of parmesan. It was a hit!

I made this recipe today.  I must say it is very good.  I added bacon to my recipe and cooked my chicken in the grease for flavor.  I also add chicken bullion cubes and nutmeg to my sauce for flavor.

Can you say OMG!  I followed recipe exactly and it is perfect.  The only thing I would add is to let it sit so the cheeses head toward room temp.  I cut into it right away and it kinda fell apart (I was starving!!) but still absolutely delicious.  I came back for another piece 2  hours later (bottom of pan was still hot)  and it was perfect temp and held together really nicely!  This is an amazing recipe.  Thanks!

I thought this was good, but I made a few changes and will again. I don't like frozen spinach so I used a package of spinach. I will probably wilt it next time in a little bit of chicken broth next time to save room in the casserole pan. I used the recommended amount ricotta, but felt like that was a little too much.  I think a slightly thinner sauce by using more broth would have been perfect. I also recommend adding mushrooms to the spinach layer. I used the leftover baby portobellos we had and it was delicious in this recipe.

I made this last night, and Wow, was it good. My lasagna pan is larger than a 9x13 so made 1 1/2 all the ingredients. Also, I hate cooking noodle and trying to layer everything, so I added 1/2 cup more chicken broth and 1/4 more milk and just used the noodles uncooked. I cooked it for 75 minutes and it came out great. I would definitely make this again.

My husband & I made this together & both give it 5 stars. Full of flavor & easy to make. I thought the spinach would be overpowering but it was not. We followed all except we only had chicken flavored flour so we used that instead of all-purpose. My husband salt & peppered the chicken when baking so I did not add any later. I will make this again & again!

Wow, this is so rich and creamy and delicious.  I used turkey because that is what I had.  I also added a bit of roasted garlic and it was fantastic!  The pan weighed liked 10 pounds :)  Yum!

My 13 year old daughter loved it! This is a really good recipe, however as a experienced home cook, I used seasoned chicken breast and thighs. This made a huge difference and brought extra flavor to the recipe. The layering instructions where confusing, so I layered based upon the same technique for the traditional lasagna.

This lasagna was amazing. My family loved it and my husband says I must make it again. I used Ali gradients but as another user suggested, to make it easier I used a large bowl and mixed my chicken, ricotta cheese, spinach, and added cream cheese (just because my husband loves cream cheese in any cheese based recipes) so I didn't have to layer it. I also mixed my milk with heavy whipping cream to thicken up the sauce since I was afraid the chicken broth would leave it too thin. It was amazing and I'msure if I followed the exact recipe I would still feel the same as my changes were just for personal touches but didn't really modify the original recipe much. I will definitely make this again. It tastes so much better when it's eaten as leftovers.

This was very good!  Directions were alittle confusing but tasted great.  I did cut the butter in half, and honestly didn't miss it, but the rest made it to the recipe.  Great way to use up left over rotisserie chicken :)  Will make again.

Although very rich, I felt this dish lacked flavor.  With so much cheese, it seemed like it would be a home run, but it was just okay.  In all fairness, I generally prefer tomato sauce in lasagna.

This was Ok. None of us in this family was overly impressed. I felt that it did take awhile longer then 25 minutes to prep and . And was just ver bland once it was completed. I think seasoning the chicken or even using a store bought cooked chicken would have helped. It looked and smelled good though :)

I am giving this 2 stars as there were a couple of people in my house that loved this recipe, the rest asked why I didn't just make my lasagna. I wasn't impressed at all. I followed it exact, something I rarely do and probably shouldn't have this time. I found it to be too bland, and adding the cheese into the sauce was a horrible choice in my opinion,but the sauce itself needed a lot of help in the flavor department, perhaps some sauteed bell peppers would have helped there as well as fresh herbs.  I found it lacking texturally as well, the mouth feel completely turned me off, I couldn't distinguish the layers I expect in a lasagna. Maybe with more veggies in the layers to give it some bite and some variety in flavor would improve it greatly, but over all just found this to be a disappointment and will not be making it again.

This was a good recipe, but would have been a little mild for my family. I added a can of Rotel tomatoes and some red pepper flakes. With that addition, we thought it was delicious! Oh, another thing - I didn't have lasagna noodles, so used 8 oz. of thin spaghetti and mixed it all together instead of layering. Saved a little time and tasted just the same!

Pretty good white lasagna base. I would skip the chicken in the future - it doesn't add anything to the dish. Also the chicken broth taste is too strong - use veggie stock instead.

This dish would also support other veggies really well (cooked broccoli, yellow squash, tomatoes, zucchini). Or make red sauce and meatballs on the side.

OMG... This thing weighs about 100 pounds, and it is GLORIOUS! I've never had anyone not like it, and it's so rich it lasts for days! I add more garlic, but that's because, well... I love garlic! Simple, but very special. Make it for someone you want to impress!

I made a few adjustments to this recipe...but hosted a dinner party (informal)with both kids and adults and it was a huge hit!  I made this in a 10*15 casserole dish....1.5x recipe.  I used 5 huge garlic cloves crushed (fresh)...I sautéed 2 1 lb boxes of baby spinach (stems removed)- I also tried to squeeze the spinach after cooling to remove excess water.  I used fresh basil and oregano.  I used part skim ricotta, mozzarella.  I used freshly grated Romano cheese instead of Parmesan.  Also, I used Seasoned Rotisserie Chicken (from Costco)...but from anywhere would work.  I found I needed to cook this for an hour, perhaps because it was larger in size and no cook lasagna noodles.  Will definitely make again!

Made this last night.  I used the no boil noodles, 1 box of spinach 2 cups mozzarella cheese, 1 container of reduced fat ricotta cheese and added 1 egg.  AWESOME recipe.  There were zero left overs for the picture.  Hubby wants to know when we are having this again.

I made this last night, with pene pasta instead of lasagna noodles. I literally just tossed it all in a pan and cooked it. IT WAS AMAZING! Seriously one of the best meals I have ever made.

Several years ago at a conference, I was served the most divine white sauce chicken lasagna and have been looking for it's match ever since.  I think that this recipe could serve as the base for my dream lasagna.  First made just as instructed, my family liked this but thought it was more like a chicken casserole than a lasagna and ended up spooning generous dallops of pesto over our servings to liven the dish up.  So, second time around I added 1cup of pesto in with the ricotta mix.  It was near perfect with the addition of pesto.  My son and I still spooned a bit more over our servings and the man did not, all agreed that the recipe was greatly improved with the abundance of basil, pine nuts and olive oil from the adding the fresh pesto.  This dish is deliciously rich as written, we thought it just lacked the flavor to match and think the pesto corrects the balance to near perfection.  Those painfully aware of fats could reduce butter in the sauce to counter some of the oil in the pesto.  We will make again with the changes to suit our taste and am thankful to have found this great base recipe!

a few minor errors on my part but for the most part it was pretty good. the important thing was that my family of picky eaters liked it. i added mushrooms, spinach and tomato sauce to my lasagna which only enhanced the flavor. next time i will need to add more cheese and salt.

Delicious and seasoned well, this is almost like an alfredo lasagna, so it's pretty rich. Not a diet recipe, for sure, but so so good as a treat!

While this was good, It really needed something else to make the flavor pop. I may try this again with some pesto and sun dried tomatoes, but as the recipe stands as it is, I probably wouldn't make it again.

This was absolutely fantastic. My husband and children asked if we could have leftovers the next night. That never happens! I stayed true to the original recipe except for omitting one box of spinach simply because I only had one box in my freezer. I can't rave enough. This will enter my regular dinner rotation, for sure!

I've made this recipe exactly as stated, as well as with some tweaks....it is amazing no matter how I cook it.  For a lower carb and wheat free version, I have even used coconut flour and zucchini instead of white flour and lasagna noodles.  It was even awesome like that.  Anything with a whole stick of butter and 5 cups of cheese is going to taste good!!!

Very dry. The sauce was too thick. I would add more milk or broth next time. This could be because I used the no- cook noodles.

This was absolutely fantastic. I also did the no boil noodles and it turned out well. I've never made a lasagna before as I'm not a huge fan of red sauce, so this was perfect. My boyfriend had two large helpings and was in love. When I make again, I think I will use fresh spinach. I dumped even more cheese in than the recipe called for and it was super gooey. Overall, awesome recipe.

Very good for those who like cheese, spinach, and lasagna noodles.  The flavors melded well.  I froze half the casserole and thawed it out for a meal at another time. It came out fine.

I made this recipe to the tee, except I used no boil noodles. I would take the extra time and boil the noodles! Thought it was a little dry, but it may have been the no boil noodles. Also, would chop the spinach next time, too stringy!

I will say the only reason i didn't give it five stars was my son had trouble eating it because of the spinach (picky eater, can detect veggies in anything!) but it also may have been my fault the flavor was different than it shoulda been because i used taco blend cheese instead of mozzarella. (I know, duh!!! right?) but my other son and daughter ate it just fine and i thought it was pretty good. also, note to self, when lasagna noodles say no-boil…. don't boil them anyway! my noodles fell all apart. my fault! anyways, pretty good recipe, but for texture issues i might puree the spinach next time so that my whole family will eat it.

This meal is absolutely marvelous. I made it for my son's birthday and his favorite dish is Lasagna, but because of arthritis we are staying away from tomato sauce. There is absolutely NO NEED to make any changes to the recipe [except that I did add one additional garlic clove because my son REALLY likes a lot of seasoning, but even he said nothing else was needed!] The layering worked out just fine! Just follow the recipe.

Made this for our family and we really enjoyed it.  I mostly followed the recipe, the only thing differing was that I overly seasoned the chicken tenders I sauteed to put in the lasagna to make it more flavorful.  While we enjoyed this version, next time I will not use the frozen spinach.  While it would be good to use to speed up the recipe, I think next time I would sautee fresh baby spinach with garlic and olive oil.  I also think substituting broccoli and mushrooms would be great too!  Really, you can use this as a base and add any vegetable combination you might like!  Thank you for a great recipe Lisa!  This will definitely become a regular for a different lasagna!

This recipe was yummy!!  But it took me over two hours to make and as another rater said, I used so many dishes to make this recipe.  Make sure you use the no-boil noodles.  It really does save time and mess.  I also used fresh spinach which was very tasty. I sauteed it in some of the butter along with mushrooms and basil. I would recommend only using one bag of spinach.  When layered with the mushrooms, it's plenty.  I also used cottage cheese for the ricotta. When the recipe states to layer 1/3 noodles, the ricotta, and the chicken, it means ALL the chicken, and ALL the ricotta.  I misunderstood and only put 1/3 of each only to find out I had to throw it in somewhere else.  I will make this again with my changes which should make the whole meal prep much faster.

This was so good, just finished dinner and having a very hard time resisting the urge for another piece!  I added more vegetables - mushrooms and peppers, cherry tomatoes on top for colour. Also added a whole bulb of roasted garlic to the sauce.

This was great!  A couple of notes though....one package of spinach is plenty.  Also, I only used 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese instead of 1/2, which was plenty to cover the layer.  Also, I cooked chicken breasts on the charcoal grill and cubed that for the meat.  I think I will add a little Italian seasoning next time, but very good recipe!

The lasagna was fantastic.

The recipe needs a little tweaking though.

For example, you need 12 noodles for a 9x13 pan. Any less and you have 1 inch gaps between them.

Second, the layering directions could be a little more clear: ...Layer with 1/3 of the noodles, ALL OF the ricotta, and ALL OF the chicken. Arrange 1/3 of the noodles over the chicken, and layer with 1/3 of the sauce mixture, ALL OF THE spinach...
(Reason being, people who KNOW how to make lasagna don't need much of a step-by-step.)

A 'medium' saucepan is insufficient to properly stir the ingredients. In reality, to have enough room to maneuver, you need a very large saucepan.

Other than that, this recipe is solid, and the result is awesome (if you figured all the above out beforehand).

It was great! I used a bag and a half of fresh spinach. I would suggest adding a 1/4 - 1/2 tsp salt as well as Italian sausage to give it a deeper savory flavor.

This is amazing!! Made just as directed, and would not change a thing. I have one question, does anyone know if this will freeze well? It makes so much, and I would love to freeze the leftovers for later on.

This was seriously a restaurant quality meal. I was a little nervous but EVERYONE loved it! Even went back for thirds! This is going in my keeper box. I followed the directions exactly with the only change being that I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1. It was perfect!

Best lasagna ever. I used lean turkey meat instead of chicken. I had to make the chicken broth. Turned out delicious. OMG the cheese mixture is very rich in flavor.

Delicious! Hubby had seconds and we'll definitely make again.  Read the reviews and: used fresh spinach and added mushrooms, added 1/2 cup white wine to sauce, seasoned the chicken and added extra cheese, and used no boil noodles.  A lot of prep but also good amount of leftovers and well worth it! Might try adding other veggies as suggested next time.

One word for this:  AWESOME!  We had some smoked chicken breasts that I needed to use and this was the perfect recipe for them!  Everyone loved it and I followed it as written, except I added extra garlic when I sautéed the onions and garlic in butter.  So rich and yummy!  Will definitely be making this again, for company next time, because it is that good!

When making this I decided to cut out some calories.  I used low calorie cheeses also used 4 tablespoons olive oil in place of the 6 tablespoons of butter. I used shredded chicken breast that I slow cooked with garlic, basil and oregano.  I only used 1 pack of spinach.  I wish that I had more sauce as my lasagna was pretty dry. I will make again but with using my traditional alfredo sauce recipe but will try the low calorie cheese again. Oh also used 5 cloves of garlic but will use even more next time.

Wow!  I decided to give this a try and was really impressed. It's a definite keeper. The changes I made was to use ground chicken instead of cubed chicken since I already had some in the freezer. I seasoned the chicken with Italian herbs and it gave the meat a really nice flavor. I also used less ricotta cheese than the recipe called for since I'm not a huge fan of ricotta. I also added some diced mini Bella  mushrooms and diced red bell pepper that were sautéed.  Lastly, I used fresh spinach instead of frozen because I already had some in the fridge.  Fantastic!

This is a very nice white sauce.  Made this lasagna for my family and they really liked it; will be making it for guests this weekend.   I tweaked it by stirring 2 lightly beaten eggs into the ricotta. The eggs make the ricotta more spreadable.  Used 1/2 Lb fresh spinach, parboiled & well drained, instead of frozen spinach. The fresh spinach is so much tastier than frozen and no more work.  Lastly, I used ground chicken which I sautéed with 1 cup cooked onion and a little fresh garlic; we love ground chicken and it is great for casseroles.   Think I will add a little white wine to the sauce for another flavor dimension next time.

Very bland, although it was edible with some salt. Even then, we all felt sickeningly full, even after eating only a reasonable size serving. We will have to get through all the leftovers somehow. Will not make again... waste of time and money.

Excellent! I only made it with one package of spinach and wish I'd done two  but that's my own fault- so I have no complaints! My kids loved it and asked for more. I may use a little less butter next time.

We loved this lasagna! My husband does not care for white sauce so I didn't think he would like this at all. Surprise! He had two helpings! In considering his tastes (he's a meat and potato man) I increased the amount of chicken to 3 cups and reduced the spinach to one 10 oz package. And since I love basil, I doubled the amount to 2 tsp. Yummy, yummy. It's a keeper.

It's going in the oven and I can't wait!!  The sauce is wonderfully garlicky.  I had some leftover grilled vegetables I wanted to use and had some chicken on hand I could cook and was looking for a good white sauce to make a lasagna, I probably added about 5 small garlic cloves.

Used two bags of fresh spinach and and de-stemmed it,   cooked it down with olive oil. Made the cheese sauce with whole milk only, didn't use chicken broth. Turned out delicious.

This had amazing flavor. DO NOT use oven ready noodles follow the recipe and get the ones you have to cook. I thought I could get away with the oven ready ones the noodles were still hard. I still ate it because it was to delicious to waste. lol

This was a hit with everyone, and especially for my friend who cannot eat tomatoes and therefore doesn't get to enjoy lasagna.   The only changes I made were to use fresh spinach and, rather than make one in a 9x13 pan, I divided the recipe into three loaf pans, freezing two for later.  Will most certainly be making this again.  :)

This lasagna was delicious! Loved the sauce! Next time I'll use the right baking pan size. I only wanted to make this for 8 servings, so I had too much room left in my baking dish, which caused the top noodles to slide off to the sides a bit. I will definitely make this again. =)

I took the advice of the reviewer that suggested starting with a bacon (I just used 3 slices).  I used a small portion of the bacon grease for all of my skillet work:  to cook the chicken, to wilt the fresh spinach instead of using frozen, and even to sautee the onions/garlic (I used a little less butter than called for).  I crumbled the bacon over the cubed chicken layer in the lasagna.  Because it was just a few slices, it did not give the lasagna any distinguishable bacon flavors, but it did make the dish a little more flavorful overall.  Big hit!

This is AMAZING. I'm eating it right now. I made just a few tiny changes: used 8 oz of fresh spinach from the bag, vs. 20 (!!!) oz of frozen, and also used fat free ricotta cheese. I covered it to bake for 30 minutes, and then baked it another 15 or so uncovered because the darn noodles on top didn't want to cook (I used no boil). I will DEFINITELY make again!!!! maybe next time use a tad less salt. If I remember correctly, I didn't even use quite the called-for amount of salt as it was, so next time I'll probably use 1/2 teaspoon. :) Amazing recipe!!!!!!

A little time consuming to make, but worth the effort.  4 out of 6 family members loved it, thats a pretty good percentage at my house.  My super picky 2 and 4 year olds wouldnt touch it, but the 10 and 11 yr olds did.  The only change I made was to add mushrooms to the spinach layer.  I will definitely make this again.

DELISH!  My only real adjustment was adding about a half cup of white wine to the sauce.  I actually used uncooked whole wheat lasagna noodles and it came out just fine.  (We like our lasagna a little on the dry side... not soupy at all.)

This was good but the spinach seemed to over power the chicken. We liked the other flavors in the recipe. I used rotisserie chicken from the grocery store deli and 1 box of frozen spinach. My husband couldn't believe that I had added chicken. I will try it again with these modifications - use 1/2 box of spinach or fresh spinach and 2 cups of chicken.

This recipe was okay. Not that special. I absolutely love spinach but I felt that the spinach in this recipe just did not go with the taste of the chicken and the sauce mixture. Overall it just wasn't worth all the time spent making it.

Everyone thought this recipe was great!! For extra flavor I took out the ricotta cheese and substituted with cooked and mashed butternut squash (like you would find in a raviolli filling).  Great flavor with less fat!

I made it exactly as the recipe says to and it was very bland... It needs more seasonings. Clean up was huge too and next time DEFINITELY use NO BOIL noodles.

This was very good and my boyfriend and i enjoyed it very much. To make it a little more healthier, i substituted the ricotta with some cottage cheese and i used 1% milk. It still turned out awesome. will definitely make this again.

I love this lasagna and I got compliments for it. I didn't have spinach so I used mushrooms, and leftover breast from a roasted chicken. The sauce is delicious. I added More garlic, used fresh grated Parmesan, and did not have oregano, but it was still really good.  I didn't follow the layering as I did ricotta, chicken and mushroom, then sauce. I can't wait to try it with spinach.

Pretty darn easy and turned out amazing. I added about 9 mushrooms, diced, to the sauce since I was omitting the chicken. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and will say it's one of my favorite things I've ever made.

I thought it was a decent recipe and got a couple compliments on it; however, I and others thought it needed more flavor. It wasn't tasty enough for me, which didn't match it's rich texture. I even added bacon to it and it still lacked enough salt. Overall, it was good, but will not make it again.

Pretty good. I halved the recipe and put it in a 8x8 but made no other changes. My hubby liked it, I thought it was just OK, and both of my picky eaters (preschoolers) ate a little bit, which I didn't think they would because they normally don't like spinach. I personally prefer a standard tomato-based lasagna but I'm giving it 4 stars based on my hubby's and kids' opinions.

Very good.  Made one change-added some turkey Italian sausage-one link.  I cut the recipe in half also.  It's a great recipe and can be modified easily so that it could be changed everytime it's made.

Excellent!  For the kid-friendly version, use garlic powder and onion powder instead of garlic and onion, and leave off the spinach.  It was a hit!

It helps to cover for 50 mins, then remove foil to brown a bit.  I used recipe for chicken breast w/herb basting sauce for the chicken( I used 1 1/2 lb boneless breasts.   I did not use all the marinade on the chicken.  I saved 3T and mixed w/ricotta in the lasagne recipe.   Good is beyond words for this.   Remember to let the dish sit 10-15 min after you remove from the oven.   Like the others, I used 1 box chopped (very well drained spinach)

I doubled the garlic and halved the spinach based on other reviews and I still thought it was sort of bland. Doubt I'll make it again. Something that takes this much time and effort should taste better.

When I prepared this fantastic dish, I shared it with my co-worker because I was so impressed. I followed the recipe exactly. I consider this a dish that is easy enough to prepare for a weeknight, but it tastes like a special occasion meal. I highly recommend trying this dish.

I love it and have shared this recipe with many friends and family who also loved it!  Only modification I made is that I added mushrooms because they blend so well with spinach and white cheese dishes.  It does require a lot of ingredients but well worth it in the end, the leftovers even taste amazing!

Just seemed to be missing something. Other than using fresh spinach & mushrooms & increasing the garlic, I did not change a thing. With the left overs the next day I added some Ragu sun dried tomato & sweet basil(as that's what I had on hand) over the top & it made ALL the difference in the world. Beautiful flavors ..... :)

I was looking for a chicken Lasagna with a white sauce recipe. I read a lot of the reviews and took some of their advice on some tweaking that made it better. It turned out absolutely wonderful. I added nutmeg and 4 cloves of garlic to the sauce and substituted a 1/2 cup of white wine for the broth. I also used fresh spinach that I saluted with olive oil to make it tender. I had friends over for dinner that night and 3 of them begged for the recipe! Yummmm

Good flavor, but grossly rich. Believe me, I love decadent food, but after a few bites, we couldn't eat any more.... it was just too rich.

I made this dish for my husband's birthday this year. He had to work so I needed something I could build and bake later. I only used 15oz of spinach and I am very glad I did. I also wish I would of shredded the chicken instead of cubing it. This is a very heavy, cheesy dish and I felt it was not as good reheated like regular lasagna typically is. Not sure if I would make it again but that is merely based off of personal preference.

Great flavor! Although, the sauce tasted really good, we thought it was too much. Thats basically what you are eating is cheesy sauce lasagna.  Glad I cut down the ricotta, otherwise, it would've been way too thick. Used 10oz fresh spinach like others said. We also used ground mild italian sausages with leftover bacon and made our own lasagna noodles.

This is fine although sort of bland. If there's a next time to make it, I'll add spinach, salt, and more spices.

Anytime a recipe comes along that my 9 year old daughter likes I praise the allrecipes gods.  My daughter only loves potatoe products and chicken nuggets.  She loved this recipe and even though she initially tried to pick around the spinach, I got her to eat that too without any problems.  The recipe was easy to follow, I got boneless, skinless chicken thighs and use my scissors to cut it into squares.  I could not blend the flour, butter, onions and get it to bubble without pouring in the broth it will burn.  Use a whisk.  I also used non boil noodles and it all turned out awesome.  I also added an egg to the ricotta and seasoned it lightly with SeasonAll.  The whole process took about 2 1/2 hours but well worth it.

The family really enjoyed this one, as did I!  I added 1 extra clove of garlic (garlic flavor was pretty strong but we like it that way), heaping teaspoons of basil and parsely, and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of oregano.  I also had a little more than 2 cups of cooked chicken and some extra cheese (we used parmesan, ricotta, and a four cheese italian blend instead of plain mozzerella).  YUM!  It came out cheesy and delicious.      It probably would have been great without all the extras also!

Couldn't be more delicious! This was my first lasgana and it came out great. There were hardly any leftovers at all. It was surprisingly easy to make. I did cook my chicken in italian seasoning before adding it in but that was the only change I made.

I made this for a casual gathering with adults/kids.  This was loved by all.  Even my veggie-hating kids all ate it up without complaint...and even had seconds!  I made mine with olive oil instead of butter and I'd imagine it's a little lighter.  Definitely will not be my last time making this dish!

THIS. IS. AMAZING!!!  The only 2 things I did differently were:  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta (personal preference) and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Everything else was the same.  You MUST try this recipe...it is FABULOUS!  Thank you Lisa for this wonderful recipe!

This is really good.  I added a can of hot Rotel tomatoes, 2 tsps. cumin, 1 tblspn chopped cilantro and 1 tspn garlic powder.  I used all the cheese and added extra for the top.  I sprinkled the enchiladas with sliced black olives and pour a can of green enchiladas sauce.  I baked it for 45 minutes at 350.  It was sooooooooo good!  Very cheesy and delicious.

Made this for the first time for a party of six. It was wonderful! At the end of dinner and seconds all around, there were only two small pieces left. Rave reviews for this recipe. I served it with a caprese salad. It was even more terrific reheated the next day. Will definitely make again. I used fresh spinach and spiced my chicken breasts with garlic and seasoning before cooking them. The flavor really added something to the dish. 5 star recipe in my book.

This recipe was amazing!  My family loved it and I'm making it for a pot luck get together in a few weeks.  My kitchen was a disaster when I was done making it and there was a lot of cleanup but well worth it.

Yum-o! After reading the reviews, I decided to make this for our wine tasting last night. New recipes make me nervous, but this was awesome-and GONE quickly! I left out the spinach because I forgot to defrost it, but think I will add it in next time to see if it tastes any different.

Not too thrilled with this... in theory it sounds like something I'd love, but after making it (followed the recipe exactly) I found it to be "just ok". Not as good as I expected, based on all of the great reviews. Not worth all of the effort, ingredients and dirty dishes. Took me quite a while to make, I was a little disappointed.

My husband and I both liked this dish.  My kids were not a fan due to the strong onion taste.  I used 3/4 of a decent sized onion and was even kinda strong for me.  I forgot to add the spinach even though I specifically purchased it.  With some amendments, I will try this recipe again

I made this in advance, froze it and cooked it a week later.  It took a bit longer to cook, but my 7 bridge ladies could not get enough of it.  I would give it a 5 star rating and my only hint would be to add a bit more chicken flavor to the chicken broth.  I certainly will mark this recipe a "keeper" and will use it many more times.

This recipe is amazing! Perfect variety on a classic dish, and it wasn't complicated at all! I too used no-boil noodles and it turned out perfectly! My family and friends loved it.

This is an amazing "date night" meal!!!  I made this for my boyfriend the first time I had him over.  Once done the kitchen is trashed and there are no more clean pots left, but it is worth the effort.  I added bacon and yellow squash and a splash of white wine.

Not really what we like for lasagna but it wasn't bad.  However I did use the white sauce recipe to make a  spinach pizza and that was fantastic!  I will keep the white sauce recipe as a favorite!  Thanks!

I've made this twice now. The first time with spinach but the family didn't love it. The second time I skipped the spinach and the family liked it much more. Even more delicious the second day!

This was an excellent recipe. I added some red pepper for color and sliced mushrooms. I followed everything else and it turned out wonderfully. I shared with family and friends and they loved it too. I froze the leftovers in individual pieces. I let thaw in the fridge and just reheated in the microwave. Just as good the second time around.

So easy, so yummy!! My 3 year old ate it up, spinach and all and didn't think twice about it! I didn't think the sauce would be so tasty, boy was I wrong. It is so flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly as written, didn't make one change at all. This is definitely worth making again and again.

Amazing! I did make a few changes though.  Instead of 2 packages of frozen spinach, I used one bag of FRESH spinach.  I also used 3 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of milk to make sure I had enough of the white sauce.  Used 3 cups of chicken instead of 2.  I prepared everything one evening after work, put it in the fridge, and baked it the next day. It was HUGE hit! Everyone loved it..

I really liked it.  I didn't have an onion, so I used dried minced onion instead.  I also added mushrooms because I did have those on hand.  I only used one package of spinach and it was very tasty.

I am going to have to agree with some other reviews and say that as written, this recipe was a bit disappointing.  I really like the idea of a white lasagna, but I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out bland.  Perhaps less than 2 packets of frozen spinach as other reviewers suggested would help.  Also- maybe a more flavorful cheese in the sauce (ie. sharp white cheddar?)  With some tweaks, I feel like this could be a great recipe- as written it is just okay.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written for my birthday cookout. I did use the fresh bag of spinach with stems removed, cooked in 1 Tbs. olive oil quickly. I also never use Ricotta Cheese. I used Cottage Cheese in it's place. Added fresh parmesan cheese and tons of garlic and more chicken then called for. It was a HUGE hit!  I froze it and it turned out fine.  Just took longer too cook then expected. Was well worth the wait.  No leftovers!

Sauce was excellant! However, 2 boxes of frozen spinach almost ruined the whole dish! One would have been more than enough! Other than that, good recipe.

This was a fabulous meal! I made a huge dish and it was gone the next day. I made some extra noodles, just in case, and I needed them. I too used 1 package of spinach but I think 2 would have been fine. I did add a jar of mushrooms and that was yummy! I really loved this recipe! My Dad can't wait for me to make again!

This came out wonderful.  I found it rather bland, but the men gobbled it up.  Next time I will try with a layer of pepperoni or add some chili flakes to give it a little bite. Thanks for the recipe

I love lasagna old-style, but this recipe made me forget all about hamburger and tomato sauce.  It was so good, that I had to take some over to my parent's house so they could enjoy some too!  Even better as a left-over.

Followed the directions exactly with only one substitution; instead of frozen spinach I used fresh spinach.  I just washed it and put it right in the lasagna before baking (without pre-cooking/steaming).  It tastes good but very, very rich. . . I ate it right out of the pan, it will be interesting to see how it tastes tomorrow.  I don't think I would make this again, it's just too rich.

I made this with servings for 6.  I don't think the ingredients all translated correctly b/c the directions were not accurate,but all in all, it turned out great.  I would recommend making a little extra cheese sauce by adding more broth and milk.  I ended up needing more and had to pour milk around the edges to keep the layers saturated.  I also increased the fresh garlic and used fresh basil because I had some one hand.  I also grated a sprinkle of fresh nutmeg in the cheese sauce and it gave it a nice touch. Loved all the flavors!  Served with soft, garlic bread.  Reheats nicely.

To save some time, I rolled the filling in lasagna noodles and baked for 15 minutes.  Excellent!  Everyone wanted the recipe.

I had this at a company in-service day and it was so good, so I wanted to try to make it myself. It was very good, but next time I think I will make it with cooked shredded chicken instead. The canned chicken was a little salty for our taste.

This recipe was good but it had way too much spinach. Did not taste good at all leftover. Next time I will only use one package of spinach.

In my opinion, this casserole was very bland.  It sounded so tasty when reading the description.  I even added more garlic and spices than it called for, but still bland.  I would not make this lasagna again.

Wow!!!! I modified a bit as I am not ever one to follow a recipe to the "t" (unless baking of course), but the overall experience was extraordinary. I did not use as much milk as called for, I only used one package of spinach, and I used only one cup of mozzarella cheese (none in the alfredo sauce), but it was PHENOMENAL!!!! Will DEF be saving and will recommend to everyone.

This was good but I would make a few changes.  I would use rotisserre chicken and I would cut the spinach in half.  I added more ricotta and mixed the spinach.  also cook lasagna noodles for 4 minutes.

Wow, this was very good. I'm not a big red sauce lasagne eater, so I tend to never cook lasagne at all. When I saw this recipe, I became intrigued. I used the non-boiling noodles with this and i didn't know if it would work and it was fabulous. I also bought a 16 oz. package of frozen spinach and it was plenty. My family loved it!

This was very good!  The only thing I changed was the layering, I spread the chicken through 2 layers and also the spinach.  I also boiled 3 chicken breasts and then pulled the meat off the bone.  I used the broth to cook the noodles in.  Overall, entire family loved this....lot of work but definitely will put this one in the recipe box!

Delicious!  I used 5 cups of fresh spinach and cooked it down until bright green.  When it says add the ricotta cheese and chicken use it ALL.  Don't use 1/3 or you will end up with leftovers.  Everyone raved about it.  Definitely a keeper! Yummy!!

Oh my gosh, this was really delicious!  We liked this way more than traditional lasagna.  I followed the recipe as written but used a little less parmesan and added more garlic.  Also used the Oven Ready lasagna noodles (Great Value brand from Walmart) and that worked, too.  A little work on the prep, but now we have a great leftover meal for this week.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe. Only things I changed were seasoning the chicken and grilling it myself with some garlic, salt and pepper. I also seasons the ricotta with garlic-salt before putting it in the lasagna. This got rave reviews at my potluck. I will definitely make it again.

awesome recipe! I halved this recipe and made it in a 9x9. I used 5 cloves of garlic and a little over a cup of ricotta. I also sauteed my raw chicken in a little evoo and the onion. The sauce was spectacular. There really isn't much you could/should change in this recipe to make it better. Definitely on the 'keeper' list.

This was good.  I cut the recipe in half and thought 1 cup of ricotta was too much, and less spinach would have been better.  Like others I added extra garlic. I also added sauteed mushrooms and mixed everything together as one sauce.  In doing this I needed to add a little extra broth to thin it out a little.  I also made the lasagna in advance (minus the topping), so I baked it for 50 minutes.  I added some mozzarella, parmesan and parsley on top the last 20 minutes.  I'm only giving this 4 stars because I think it's a lot of work, yet it's not great.

Rich and time consuming but worth it. I combined the chicken sauce and spinach to create one layer. Would definitely make this again, but a little much for a weeknight meal.

I am giving this four stars because both my Husband and I thought it was pretty good but not great. I did do what a lot of the other reviewers did. I added more garlic to the recipe and put the spinach in the ricotta mixture. I also added less spinach but I am not sure how much because I eye balled it.

I do not get how this got 4.5 rating.  Its ok but nothing spectacular.  Other reviewers are exaggerating.  My family of 4 ate it but we'd rather choose the traditional beef lasagna.

Fabulous recipe!!! I come from a family of food allergies so, I used rice milk instead of regular, and used gluten free lasagna noodles and gluten free all purpose flour. My family loved it!!!

I used oven ready noodles and mixed the spinach in.  Definitely very rich, but also very good.  I won't make this regularly b/c of the richness, but it will be a special treat, and I'm so glad I found the recipe! Thank you!

Great recipe.  I used fresh spinach and fresh baby bella mushrooms for my veggie layer - and lots more garlic.  I can't believe how much my kids loved it.

The sauce was great. The ricotta filling was, well, it was the reason some people believe they don't like ricotta. I wish I had seasoned it. This isn't the worst thing I've ever had, and the sauce itself is tasty, but it would need significant tweaking to be worth the calorie and fat count. This is the sort of meal you eat, knowing that you can't eat dessert for a week to make up for it, but sure that it'll be worth it, but in this case, for us, not so much. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my husband last night and he LOVED it.  He is an extremely picky eater (who doesn't like spinach) so I wasn't sure how this dish was going to go over but he liked it more than anything I've tried in years.  I took the advice of others and used half of the spinach it called for and that was more than enough.  I also sauteed the chicken with a clove of garlic and added another half a clove to the white sauce.  I will definitely be adding this to the list of my family's favorite dishes.

This was soooo good! This sauce has a great flavor! I decided to use the no cook noodles, so I added a little extra milk to the sauce. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! This would make a great vegetarian dish if you omit the chicken and add bag of the california mix vegetables. I think I will try that next time. This ones a keeper!!

I knew this recipe would be good but it was even better than what I imagined it'd be.  I added sauteed mushrooms, used 3 garlic cloves and only used one package of spinach (which was mixed in with the ricotta).  The next time I think I may add 1/4 cup of white wine to the cheese sauce mixture.  Serve with toasted garlic bread and the meal is perfect!

I followed the recipe exactly with no additions or variations and it was just ok. Maybe it just needed a some more spices. I would try it again but will try to add a little more flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I am making this recipe for a second time tonight after we loved it the first time.  The only real changes I made were instead of baking or boiling the chicken, etc. I pan seared mine with some complimentary seasonings since so many people had stated that the chicken was a little bland.  We were DELIGHTED with the end result and am making it for company tonight along with some homemade french bread, caesar salad for dessert, and homemade cannolis!!!!  Thanks for sharing!

Very flavorful and rich but not too rich! My 2 and 5 year old cleaned their plates! This is a big deal in our house. I love the change of red to white sauce and the use of chicken and spinach! Could use a little more moisture in the ricotta/chicken layer, I used fat free ricotta which may be why is was dry. I might try adding an egg to the ricotta so it sticks to the lasagna noodles better. That layer slipped off from the other layers, not a big deal...it still tasted delicious! I also used whole wheat noodles and fresh spinach that I steamed.

Definitely rich! I added sauted fresh spinch instead of frozen and I used the no-boil noodles (though they did not cover the whole 9x13 pan) and fat free ricotta (though it was difficult to spread). My fiance and I very much enjoyed it and will enjoy it again tonight for leftovers! Not something I will make too often because it was labor-intensive, but it was worth the work!

Fantastic!  I usually don't serve a dish that I've never made to company, but this was a HIT with kids and adults alike!  I only used 10 oz of spinach and mixed it in with the ricotta.  I used the layering technique of another poster and decreased the mozzarella that you sprinkle on the layers to a cup.  Will not make it too often just because it is so rich, but very good.

Boring....didn't taste like much to me.  I have a great recipe for a rich and meaty lasagna and I guess the chicken just doesn't do it for me. Tasted good with hot sauce thought.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it as stated except I doubled the garlic (and I probably could have added more) and substituted fresh parsley for the basil (since that's what I had on hand). This came out really good. I love spinach and thought that the amount of spinach was good. I might reduce the spinach next time, but only if I add other veggies to the mix (zucchini, squash, carrots, etc.). I also mixed the riccota with the chicken and spinach before layering.

It was good, I guess I didn't drain the spinage enough because my lasagna came out really watery! Next time I may boil it instead of letting it defrost on it's own and then strain it that way.  I seem to always have good luck with that.

My family really enjoyed this dish, it was a lot of work but I enlisted the assistance of my husband and it wasn't too bad.  We did make sure the chicken was well seasoned and used low fat cheeses, next time I will use whole wheat noodles.  We also added extra spinach.  I can see this being a very versitle dish, I want to try it with shrimp and asparagus next.  Our toddlers cleaned thier plates.  Served it with Mama D's Italian Bread and salad with Creamy Italian Dressing II; both from this site.

I so loved this lasagna, and so did my somewhat picky husband, who loves lasagna but can be iffy with new dishes.  I used rotisserie chicken, which made it so easy.  Everything else I followed exactly, though I might have thrown another garlic clove in there. I love how well the lasagna sets up nice and firm but not dry. Also, I love using chicken stock with the milk to make the cheese sauce -- brilliant!  Can't wait to make again.

Kind of bland for my taste.  Too cheesy.  The filling mixture needed something extra.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using cream cheese mixed with 2 eggs instead of the ricotta. Next time I'm going to add corn and red and yellow pepers and add another layer of lasagna noodles so I can spread the sauce and ricotta around and add an extra cup of mozerella to the extra layer also I'd like to add a tbsp lemon to the sauce. Overall this was a really tasty recipe this will be a regular at our house from now on!

Good, a nice change from red sauce lasagna. My family said the ricotta was really bland tasting, so if I make this again, I'll take the herbs that go in the sauce and mix them into the ricotta instead. I also omitted the last layer of noodles, very good without them.

This is sooo good! We usually double the sauce and only use one package of spinach! and we part way cook mushrooms and add them in! The more the better!! We also add a lot more garlic! This is our new favorite lasagna! Everyone we have served this too can't stop raving on how GREAT it is!

I feel like Marie Calendar, having made this dish.  I didn't have lasagna noodles so I just layered in a pound of cooked spiral noodles.  A 13x9 pan was barely big enough.

I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to rave about this like most of the other reviewers did. I followed the recipe exactly...and still didn't think it was amazing.  I thought it was good...but I don't think it's good enough to be worth the hour and a half I spent in the kitchen making it...I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be making this again.

This lasagna was delicious.  I prepared it with "no boil" lasagna noodles and it came out great.  I also used fresh spinach (I don't care for frozen) and it worked perfectly.  Leftovers were even better the next day too.

I made this tonight for dinner, and I have to say it was awesome!!  I'm not a huge fan of regular lasagna, but this was really good! Added extra garlic and extra cheese on top. Family loved it! Will definitely make this again! Thank you for the awesome recipe! =)

Very good.  Instead of butter, I used olive oil and sauteed mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, onions and garlic then added the other ingredients for the sauce.  Also used just a little chicken but will make again without the chicken for more vegetarian style. Used cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese.

Made for a friends birthday. It was all eaten and even the kids cleaned their plates. The only thing I would change is to add an egg to the ricotta cheese. Other than that, this recipe is superb! Thank you!

This recipe makes an excellent lasagna.  I altered two things just to speed things up. And although I wouldn't do them again, I'll mention them so that others don't make the same mistakes or at least know what to expect.  First, I used already cooked and cubed chicken breast.  If you do this, keep in mind that is a lot of added salt.  Second, if using the no-cook noodles you might want to make your sauce a little thinner is you want a saucier casserole.  Based on another review, I sauteed 2 bags of fresh spinach in  place of frozen and added fresh mushrooms.  I will definitely make this again but I'll cook my own chicken and use regular noodles.

LOVED! THIS! RECIPE!  I can't wait to make it again.  I'm glad I made enough to have leftovers for work.  Because I'm trying to lower the salt in my diet, I left out the parmesan cheese and the salt.  I also used no-bake noodles to save time.  Everything else was left the same and turned out perfect.  Thanks for the keeper.

Amazing!  I cooked my chicken, cubed, in the slow cooker with a mixture of Smart Balance and a packet of Italian Dressing mix for 5 hours.  Then I added it to the Ricotta cheese and spinach mixture.   I also added more garlic.  The whole family loved it!

This was so awesome. Seriously perhaps one of the best things I ever ate. LOL. I made a few minor changes. First marinated the chicken in EVOO, garlic paste, salt & pepper for a few hrs. I then cooked the chicken on the george forman grill and shredded once cooled. I also steamed fresh broccoli and spinach seasoned with salt,pepper and butter. I made about 1/3 more sauce it was so good. The hubbie said he likes this better than the original beef lasagna which is his fav. will be making again thanks for great recipe. it is time consuming but worth it. mmmummgood.blogspot.com

Made this tonight with no-boil lasagna noodles, ground turkey, and grated zucchini instead of so much spinach.  Turned out awesome!  The cheesy alfredo type sauce was awesome---may make that again by itself and toss it on pizza crust.  Highly recommend this one!

This was a fun dish to make.  Wow, it's rich.  I added extra veggies (sauteed carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower), and I'm glad I did, because it helped cut down on the richness a little bit.  I used whole wheat lasagna noodles and ground turkey.  My family loved this lasagna; they were extremely excited about it.  I thought it was very good, but not worthy of a 5-star rating.

This is a wonderful recipe I followed it to a tee and it turned out rich and wonderful. The only I thing I will do next time is buy a chicken already cooked and that will cut down on the prep time for me. This is awesome.

Great recipe! I added a extra level of lasagna noodles so it made 4 layers. My kids had thirds and argued who was going to take it the next day for lunch. Thanks for the great recipe...

Best lasagna ever! However, it is time consuming and not as healthy as I would have hoped for...

UPDATE: I now make this gluten free with gluten free Tinkyada lasagna noodles, and I use Pamela's gluten free all purpose flour and it works great, tastes the same!

Ehhhh, this is pretty boring and blah.   I dressed it up some.  I was worried about everyones "bland" comments so I added a bit more salt and some hot peppers to the sauce.  I also cut way back on the cheese and used broccoli instead of spinach.    While it didn't require a ton of work, it really wasn't worth the effort.  It came out correctly and tasted just okay, it just wasn't as fabulous as I thought it would be based off the reviews.  I've made better pasta dishes that required less ingredients and time.  I won't be making again.  My husband didn't have to choke it down but neither of us was impressed.

Very tasty dish! I followed the recipe very closely, and added chopped carrots with the spinach layer. Chopped broccoli would be good in place of the spinach. The ricotta would benefit from a whisked egg, parmesan, and spices mixed in; it was a bit dry on day two. Overall a good flavor if you have the time to make it from scratch.

I used oven-ready noodles, cottage cheese in place of ricotta, broccoli in place of the spinach, and left out the parsley. Rave reviews from the whole family.

Very good! I didn't have enough lasagna noodles so I used spaghetti instead. I made 1lb of pasta and this was too much, but I can imagine using only 9 noodles would make this very soupy. Either way, the flavors were wonderful and my entire family ate it up!

OMG!! I am 100% in love with this recipe!!  The ONLY thing that I changed was used fresh spinach that I wilted in a little EVOO instead of frozen spinach.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!   To anyone that is considering this, give it a shot...I promise you will not be disappointed!! :)

Good, but don't over do it on the spinach.  I rounded up to the next whole bag (trying not to "waste"), and it overpowered the taste of the other ingredients.  Follow the recipe.

LOVE this simple recipe. To make it even easier, I cooked 2 chicken breasts in a skillet with chicken broth (add a little flavor to the chicken) and used that broth for the cream sauce. After I poured off the broth, I shredded the chicken and added 1 pkg of frozen spinach to the chicken (it was a lot of spinach!) and let it heat gently in the pan with the chicken. I did add a can of diced tomatoes, for color more than anything.  I recommend more garlic - I used 4 cloves in the cream sauce and tossed in 2 more with the spinach/chicken mixture.  This recipe is easy and definitely a winner. Very easy to understand. The directions are very clear and produce fabulous results. Don't hesitate about trying this one!!  Possible changes: Omit ricotta if you don't like it. Add the mozzarella here instead of mixing it into the sauce. Add portabello mushrooms or roasted red pepper. Myhusband said add pepperoni. I wouldn't advise it ;-)

This was very good. A different twist to regular lasagna. I added more cheese to it and I omitted the spinach. I didn't have any...but it really didn't need it. It was a dinner hit!!!

This was really good.  Lasagna can be time consuming, so to help cut that down I boiled chicken breast the day before so ready to shred during assembly.  I did as someone suggested combine chicken, spinach and ricotta.  I used the no-cook noodles.  This ia a beautiful completed dish, cuts well if you let it sit.  I was worried as sauce was very thin, but it sets up nicely.

This was amazing! I was worried my family wouldn't like it. I had to play with the recipie a little because I adjusted it to a family of four instead of 12 and it wasn't enough. So I just played with hit until I had enough to feed everyone! The whole dish of lasagna was gone and that never happens in my house!

This was awesome. I did modify the recipe though and left out the chicken making it a vegetable lasagna. I added mushrooms, peas, and like another viewer suggested only used one bag of frozen spinach. It was plenty! This dish was fab and will definitely make it again! My husband LOVED it!!!  and I also think I will use the white cheese sauce to use on white chicken pizza. Delish!

This was so flavorful!! It smelled great, too. The only change I had to make was instead of the dried basil I used the italian seasoning that you would add to spaghetti b/c it had basil as one of the main ingredients.

Read through the reviews and made some of the suggested changes (paprika, garlic) and this came out delicious!!!   Next time I make this I will omit the chicken and make a vegetable lasagna in the cheese sauce.  Great recipe!!!

This was pretty darn tasty. I made it in an 8x8 pan because I was just trying to use up some leftover ricotta and lasagna noodles. I left out the spinach because I didn't have any used Italian seasoning instead of the basil and oregano.  The sauce was delicious!  I loved how cheesy it was. The finished prouduct was a little soupy and didn't hold together that well. Maybe the leftovers will thicken up. I used plain baked chicken breasts but I think next time I would season them somehow for more flavor.

This the best ever! The others had mushroom soup which does not compare to this sauce! Gave it to a friend and now it is one of her favorites. Thank you Lisa Humpf! Anyone I fix it for says it is wonderful.

This was a great alternative to a traditional lasagna.  I'm not to fond of red sauces so I was looking for something different to make with the lasagna noodles I had.  This definitely fit the bill.  I substituted broccoli for spinach and left out the parsley, only as a matter of taste preference.  It was a little too watery inside but that might have been because of the broccoli.  I'd make this again.

This was very delicious!  Very rich, I sauteed chicken breast in garlic, diced onion and butter before I cubed it.  There was no need to double up the sauce there was plenty almost too much.  This dish is great for company and can be made ahead of time!

This was a great alternative to our usual lasagna. However, because of fat content I doubt that it will be made more than once a year.

Out of this world. The white sauce from scratch is amazing. Only thing was I used no-boil noodles and it came out too aldente but the next day when reheating leftovers it had absorbed enough moisture so it wasn't a problem but if making it for family and friends, take the extra time to use boil noodles. Also I baked my chicken in 350 oven for a half hour before i cut it up. Juicy and delicious!

Just made this dish and must say it was pretty good. My husband enjoyed it although next time I'll try to tweak it just a bit to fit our own taste. I did a very low fat version on this...using fat free mozarella, ricotta with skim milk, 2 percent milk and I can't believe its not butter. Still very filling and very good.

For me this was way way too heavy and kind of bland.  I didn't like the overall flavour.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I was a little disappointed.  Was worth the try though.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is VERY rich...It was also very "saucy"...I felt it could have benefited from more "filling" like the addition of maybe mushrooms or by increasing the number of lasagna noodles from 9 to 12.

THIS LASAGNA WAS GREAT! The only drawback is I would like to make the sauce mixture a little thicker next time so its not so messy. I used "Homemade Noodles" to make the lasagna noodles. Also, I used about 2 fresh basil leaves, about 10 small fresh oregano leaves, and doubled the fresh parsley. I didn't have frozen spinach so I blanched about 24 oz of fresh spinach and drained it VERY well. Served with "Grilled Asparagus".

I also took the reviews as evidence & made this for a meeting at my home without having tasted it.  It was fantastic!  Everyone thought it was great.  I followed the suggestion of using fresh spinach as well.  It will be added to our favorite lasagne recipe.  Thanks.

This was soupy when it came out of the oven, and I was wishing it held together better. The taste was rich and tasty. I thought it was really improved later -- 30-40mins, and even better the next day when reheated. When I cut a slice to reheat the next day, there was no issue with it staying together and the flavor was great. Also, I had a hard time spreading the ricotta. Next time I might mix with egg like someone else suggested.

Delicious!  I tasted the sauce prior to layering the lasagna and knew this was going to be fantastic!  I doubled the garlic, used shredded chicken (cooked with black pepper and garlic powder) and only used one box of spinach (I think two would have been too much).  This is very rich and makes alot so we now have enough leftover for another meal.  Served with garlic bread.  Bonus: It would be really easy to make this into a vegetarian meal.  The chicken is good but I don't think it adds much - the flavor is in the sauce!

This recipes had great flavor but turned out really soupy.  This happened last time I made lasagna too so I think I will use evorpated milk or half and half next time to thicken the sauce up.

Awesome recipe.  My son-in-law told my daughter "best food I've ever had at your mom's".  I too cut down on the cheese by 2 cups.  I mixed the frozen spinach (1 pkg)with cottage cheese, 1 egg, 1/4 parmasean, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp olive oil.  After the sauce was made I halved it and put the chicken in one of the halves as per another suggestion.  I layered as follows: sauce without chicken noodles Cottage cheese/spinach mixture noodles sauce with chicken noodles sauce without chicken topped with mozza

Excellent recipe. Came out perfect just the way the recipe is written. The only thing that we did different was slice the chicken into thin slices instead of cubing it. Served at 200 person catering event and got rave reviews.

This was just ok.  Which could def. be my fault because I used the no boil noodles and it took forever to cook!  I will try it again with the traditional noodles and see if that helps!

I made this for my husband's birthday and he absolutely loved it. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I really changed was the cheese... I added more for us cheese lovers. This lasagna goes perfectly with garlic bread! Yum! I will have to make this again soon.

This recipe was delicious and great for company.  I made it the night before, stuck it in the fridge and it was good to go.  I did cook it about 15 min. longer than suggested.  Even my nonspinach loving relatives agreed it was a tasty treat!

My family also LOVED this!  While they're appreciative of most things, not many receive the request that I make it again- This one did!  Definitely a keeper.  :)

Unfortunately none of us cared for this-it wasn't bad but it wasn't very exciting either. I think it may be our personal taste-we just prefer a spicier tomato based sauce.

This is a very labor intensive recipe so make sure you have alot of time to prepare, but it is well worth it in my opinion.  The only change I make is to use fresh baby spinach.  My casserole dish is overflowing in the end and I have to keep pushing it down.  This is also a rich and heavy recipe, so if you are looking for something light this is not the recipes for you.  I have made this for several years now and my family loves it.  Do not omit the garlic & onions they are what give the sauce most of the wonderful flavor.  Thanks for sharing this one!  It's a keeper!

Oh my gosh this was delicious!  My husband said to watch out cuz he planned to eat the whole thing that night!  The only changes I made was that I grilled the onions with the butter first.  I also didn't have ricotta cheese so I used cottage cheese instead and it turned out perfect too.  Definitely going to be on our monthly dinner list!

Really Yummy!  I followed other users advice and used 1/2 the spinach.  Definitely glad I did.  I also used fat free ricotta and low fat mozzarella.  A nice change of pace, but not an absolute favorite.

yum, fabulous! I substituted swiss chard for spinach and left over turkey for the chicken and will definitely be using this again, next Thanksgiving, if not before! The instructions for layering are a bit confusing, but after reading them through 3x, I figured out that you're only 1/3'ing the sauce and noodles - you make 2 layers one with chicken and ricotta, the second of spinach and mozzarella. Bun Appetit!

My husband can't eat a lot of tomato due to an allergy, so this was a great lasagna alternative. I might use a little less cheese next time, the amount was a little overwhelming, but very delicious!

Delicious!  I increased the garlic to 4 cloves and only used 1 package of frozen spinach; otherwise, I followed the recipe.  I have made this several times and it's a hit every time.

This is the third year I've made this lasagna ahead of time (along with Linda's Lasagna) and froze it for Easter. IT IS YUMMY! I do double up on the spices and use a deep dish so I do four layers - also make extra sauce. 
Thanks for a great recipe!

Love Love Love this recipe.  It is a bit labor intensive but soooo worth it!  I followed other recommendations:  Used 1/2 bag fresh spinach (stems trimmed; chopped; not cooked); added crumbled bacon; added diced zucchini; used oven ready lasagna noodles; made 1 1/2 times the sauce.  I made this the first time for my son's birthday 2 weeks ago and it was a big hit with everyone.

I used precooked lasagna noodles (15) perfect in 9x13 pan. For the cooked chicken I poached 1 whole breast in 2cups of water to which I added oregano, diced garlic, basil -- for 30 minutes  cooled and the cut up --used the liquid for broth

Family members said this recipe is a keeper.  Recipe was made as given, and the only thing different was to add a bit of water to thin the sauce during assembly. Had I not enjoyed the process so much, and been quicker off the mark, the sauce wouldn't have sat and thickened.  No harm done, it turned out beautifully, and I took a bow.

This was a very good recipe, although I did tweek it alot. I made only 2 servings, but i used 3 layers of noodles, a cottage cheese and ricotta cheese mixture where it calls for ricotta only. I used little spinach, just because i am not a huge fan of it cooked in foods. and on top of each layer, I put a lil pasta sauce. I feel without the sauce addition, it may have been to dry and thick. All in all, a good recipe tho!

Awesome recipe! The only thing I would do differently next time is mix the spinach in with the ricotta. The spinach and mozz cheese had a weird texture.

It was just ok to me.  It was too much of the same flavors, and it was a lot of work to make! If I make it again, I will add more chicken.  I would also cut the amount of spinach in half, and use less ricotta than it calls for.

This dish was excellent and easy to make. I omitted to spinach, given the fact I am allergic. I used penne pasta instead because I didn't have any lasagna pasta at home. My whole family loved it and wanted seconds! This one is a keeper.

This recipe was great, I made it for my family and they loved it.  The leftovers that were left, were gone the next day.  The only thing I changed was the ricotta cheese.  My family doesn't like it so I left it out and it came out fine.  I will definitely make this again

Wow. This is outstanding.  I also had a little bit of trouble following the directions and thought they were a little tedious. Plus, staring with cooking the chicken, making the sauce and assembling the lasagna DID take a long time. It took me a good hour and a half. In the end, it was all worth it.  I stayed pretty true to the ingredients, but I used half of the amount of spinach and I used a "pizza cheese" blend instead of the plain mozzarella. The blend had smoked mozzarella, and it seems to have helped ramp up the flavor a little.  I will definitely make this again.

My family enjoyed this dish. To save time, I seasoned and baked the chicken for this recipe and for dinner the next night while I prepared the rest of the ingredients (sauce, etc.). I used oven-ready noodles, too.

It wasnt' nearly as rich as it SOUNDED like it would be, which I consider a good thing.  It was very good and though there may be a few things I would tweak for added flavor, it was definitely a good meal.  I WILL eat these leftovers. :D

I have made this recipe several times and everyone loves it. One modification I have made is to use 1/2 of the spinach mixture so it's not as overpowering. I add the spinach to the cheese sauce and layer it inbetween alternating lasagna layers. :)

The sauce was really tasty but no one was overly excited over the assembled lasagna except my 2 year old.  Maybe chopped fresh spinach would be better.  I'd use the sauce again, but not the lasagna.

I made this for the first time for our office party, with no idea how it would turn out.  I only modified the recipe by adding an egg to the ricotta, and everyone asked for the recipe.  It was delicious!  I made a second version with broccoli in lieu of the spinach and it was equally liked.

We really enjoyed this, but I only used one box of spinach and that was plenty to me!  I made it with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I prepped it and stored it in the freezer in one of the oven-safe disposable plastic dishes with a lid.  I thawed it and baked it later. Next time, I would up the sauce a little, because I was barely able to cover the top layer.

Very creamy and decadent...definitely not an everyday meal! Only used 1 box of spinach per reviewers suggestions, and that was perfect. I beat an egg in the ricotta ad did my own layering method: sauce, noodles, ricotta, spinach, chicken, sauce, noodles, ricotta, spinach, chicken, sauce, noodles, sauce.

This was delicious.  I made this as written, except that I mixed my cooked chicken right into the sauce to keep it from drying out.  The next time I make this though, I will definitely cut the spinach down to one box, two seemed a little much.  Thanks for posting this; we all enjoyed it.

Wonderful! I marinated boneless chicken breasts in a cajun marinade then grilled and sliced. I also divided the spinach, using a 1/2 pkg mixed into the ricotta. The rest of the spinach was sauteed with chopped onions, shredded carrots and mushrooms. This mixture became another layer. Delicious!

This was really a very good recipe.  I did only use half of the spinach, I added more garlic and I combined the ricotta, spinach and chicken.  That was kind of a no brainer.  I did have that feeling that the chicken was very blah.  But on the bright side I really felt like maybe cooking the chicken with some seasoning would take care of that.  I think next timie I will cook it in some Italian dressing seasoning.  Overall a really yummy recipe!

This, to me, is a 4 star recipe because it needed a little help.  The taste is pretty good.  Like a few others, I shredded the chicken.  Definitely don't use plain chicken.  Also, the spinach layer is too spinachy.  I suggest mixing the spinach with the ricotta or something.  I had a feeling the ricotta would be too plain, so I mixed in an egg and some s&p and parsley.  I just wish I had followed my instinct with the spinach!  I used the 2 C Mozzarella in the sauce, and didn't use the other 2 C.  The parm & ricotta was enough for the other layers.  Pretty tasty, it will probably be better in the morning.  OH, and I used NO bake lasagna noodles.  That probably saved a lot with the prep time.  It didn't seem to take too long.  I cooked it for 40 mins covered, and then 10 mins uncovered at 425.

My family loves this!  Especially my super picky husband.  I only use half the spinach and put it in the food processor to sneak it in on him.  I put it in the sauce.  It's terrific.  MAke sure to use plenty of garlic.

This was toooooo cheesy so I changed it by subbing cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese instead of 3 cups of mozzarella cheese for the sauce. I also used ground chicken instead of cubed chicken.VERY VERY YUMMY

I was very hopeful about this recipe, but it just didn't do it for me. Not sure why. Was mediocre at best. The sauce would probably be great to make a white pizza though.

WONDERFUL! I messed up making the sauce by adding too much flour which dried up the sauce, but I think next time I will double the sauce anyway! I used 3 cloves of garlic, and used about 3/4 of the spinach. I think next time I will try adding tomatoes and mushrooms, and maybe some turkey sausage to give it a little kick!

My kids loved this - I made a few adjustments - which was cook in a frying pan the spinach with some garlic and olive oil, before I added it to the lasagna - I also added some cottage cheese to the cheese sauce mix. Really good - thanks so much!

Very tasty, although I was expecting something a little creamier.  My husband really liked it.  It was a lot better the next day as a leftover, perfect for a quick yummy lunch.  I only used half of the spinach it called for, and I shredded the chicken, which I will do again.

My family loves when i cook this dish!!! I cook up a pack of mushrooms and add them on top of the spinach layer...and I also only used about 1 1/2 boxes of spinach. Leftovers are the best, if we even have any!!

This was great, the sauce is AWESOME>>> It would be good on bowtie noodles or in manicotti! Just thin it out with more broth for a pasta sauce on bowties. I used wheat lasagna noodles to make a little more healthy and used skim milk mozarella.

This was not as rich as I was afraid it would be. It was a great meal for the whole family and I'll definately use it again.

Great recipe.  I really enjoyed it, however the sauce was a bit bland.  I added about six cloves of garlic, but it didn't add a whole lot of depth.  Great overall, though.

I had leftover chicken so I decided to try this recipe. I followed it as written. I used Barilla rolled flat lasagne noodles & didn't boil them. Each layer of four fit perfectly in the 9 x 13 pan. At first it looked like there was way too much in the pan. I thought for sure that the ingredients were going to overflow. But,  it baked down to being even with the top of the pan. The lasagne smelled so delicious as it baked. When I took it out of the oven, I commented that "It looked like it was from a restaurant". My grown children must have smelled it outside because they happened to drop by just as it finished baking (45 min.). They said that the finished product ""looked like something from the Olive Garden". After tasting it, they said that it "tasted like something from Olive Garden". Almost everyone had seconds. I'm just glad that there is enough left for my lunch today. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

The first time I made this I didn't think the chicken added any flavor to the dish, or thought maybe I had done something wrong.  I tried it again last night (all veggie) including more garlic, some white wine, shallots, etc and it just didn't have enough flavor for the amount of time it took to put together.  By all means this shouldn't stop anyone else from trying it, it just wasn't a dish that suits our taste buds.  Still, thanks for posting it!  :)

This was excellent! I used 3 cloves of garlic and about 3 cups of chicken. There was a little too much spinach for my preference and I think next time I will use even more chicken. But other than that it was great and I will definitely make this again!

This is an amazingly delicious lasagna!  I added some chopped broccoli and mushrooms and the amount of mozzarella in half. I think it would even be good vegetarian.

My family was skeptical about a lasagna that had chicken and no red sauce, but there wasn't a morsel left!  Even THE pickiest teenager in the world ate it, and leftovers (unheard of!)

My girlfriends and I made this for our dinner and a movie night, and what a great success. We followed the recipe and it was so yummy. My husband just loved it. We didn't change a thing. We did precook our noodles a bit and we goofed up and added a little more parmasan cheese than was required. Also we barbequed the chicken with just a little salt and pepper for flavour. What a great dish.

This was pretty good. The only change I made was to use fresh spinach instead of frozen and I didn't layer exactly the way the directions said. One of the spices tasted a bit off, but I made it last night and there is none left! It was a nice change. I served it with fresh bread and asparagus.

This was good, but I feel like the prep time was pretty excessive for the final product.  Perhaps it is because I cut down on the cheese and other fatty ingredients for health reasons(?).  I do want to say that the sauce was really good!  It would be great on its own on pasta.

This was a good dish, definitely worth making again. I served with with a green salad and french bread, and my family enjoyed it. It was not unlike a lasagna alfredo dish that I've tried previously. Next time, I would recommend using only one 10 oz spinach, as two just wasn't necessary. Unless, of course, the spinach is meant to give the recipe additional structure. Other than that, I did make some slight modifications, such as layering some of the spinach at the bottom on top of the chicken, and adding the rest to the sauce mixture before layering.

I made this recipe the way MelindaD suggested in her review as I was looking for more of a casserole than lasagne.  Tastewise it is very good.  I didn't read the layering directions as well as I should have and ended up mixing it all together and topping with additional mozzarella.  I think next time I will try it as the lasagne since this way it was not very saucy.  My only complaint was I seemed to use almost every dish in my kitchen to make it!  Will review again when I make it the original way, thanks for the yummy recipe!

We REALLY enjoyed this recipe! I will definitely make it again... my teenagers actually didn't mind getting their spinach through this recipe! I will add a little more seasoning next time (maybe a little more onion/garlic or extra spices) and at my husband and kids request, maybe a tiny bit less spinach, but all in all a GREAT recipe!

Very, very tasty lasagna.  This is an excellent alternative to the tomato-based lasagna.  I used rotisserie chicken and it added a nice flavor.  We loved it!

This was good.  I didn't use Ricotta cheese, just Mozzarella, and less spinach.  I have to agree it was definately better the second time around.

Yum! Not quite sure what was missing that would've made this 5 stars.. but it just wasn't for us. We'll make this again though.. it's great when you want something a bit different.

I halved the recipe because we are only two. I used about 5 ounces spinach and it was fine, it worked out very well! I used oven ready noodles as well to simplify the preparation. I found I would've liked more sauce so I might make a little more sauce next time. I also did the substitution of some of the broth for white wine as others suggested and it worked out well.

I made this last night and it was amazing! It is extremely rich and very cheesy.

I am so lucky I found this recipe. I'm not the greatest cook, but I felt like one last night.

Just so you learn from my experience: Make sure to defrost the spinach before you get to work on this. I had to run it under hot water because I forgot to take it out earlier. Also, I'm sure pre-packaged chicken chunks would make this recipe even easier.

I wish I could give it more stars!

This recipe was not worth all the time and effort it took to prepare this dish.  My family personally felt it did not have much flavor to it.  I was extremely dissapointed and will not be making this again. Although my 10 year old daughter absolutely loved it, so maybe for her I will give it another try.

oh WOW!! this tasted like it came from a restaurant! and it took forever, too!
it was probably the most labor intensive dish i've made in a long time. but the sauce was absolutely awesome!!
i followed the advice about cooking the chicken in bacon grease and sprinkling the bacon over the spinach. i think that gave it something i would've missed otherwise! i also don't care for spinach, so i only used 1 package - plenty! i'm giving this 5 stars as is because the changes made it worth 10!

I was originally going to give it 4 stars since it wasn't quite the "WOW" recipe I expected, but after I took some leftovers to work for some coworkers I knew I had to give it 5 stars. They were drooling over it and demanded the recipe. My husband, who despises spinach, ate it willingly and even voluntarily took leftovers for lunch the next day. Only "changes" I really made were to use the shredded meat off a whole broiler chicken, only one package of spinach instead of 2, whole wheat lasagna instead of the standard lasagna, and cottage cheese instead of ricotta. Next time I make this, I will take the advice of other reviewers and mix the chicken, spinach, and sauce together instead of keeping them separate.

This recipe was very rich, but very yummy. I took other's advice and used broccolli florets instead of spinch. I also used fresh basil instead of the dried, and added flat leaf parsley to the sauce and top to add some more flavour. Will definitly make this again!

I followed the recipe, but used 2 cups of canned chicken, and this was lacking so much. I did love the white sauce - and am making pizzaz with it this monring. I will also freeze some of this white sauce for further meals, this is truly a remarkable sauce.

I loved this recipe, and can't wait to try the leftovers. I just tweaked a few things as suggested by your reviews, and it was wonderful. I marinated my chicken breasts in Italian dressing before baking them in the oven. I also added a few more cloves of garlic and used leeks instead of onions because I'm not a huge onion fan. I only used one package of spinach and mixed it with the ricotta. I also layered it a bit different: I did sauce, noodles, ricotta/spinach, chicken, cheese, sauce, then another layer of the same, and topped that with the remaining sauce and cheese!! Definitely 5 stars from me.

We loved it! Even the kids and even with the spinach! I used fresh spinach and I think it made the sauce slightly thinner. Would definitely try with frozen spinach next time so I can squeeze all the water out. But we still totally enjoyed it!

This was really good...even better the next day.  I added some fresh chopped basil, lots more garlic and a splash of white wine to mine....I still feel like this was missing some key ingredient that would bring it to a "WOW!".  It has great potential though, so experiment with it.  Enjoy!

I would give this recipe 4 stars but my husband said 3 so maybe 3.5.  It was pretty good but my family(kids) were not so impressed.  I only used one package of frozen spinach which was way more than enough.  I also added three cloves of garlic instead of one to the sauce and an egg and spices to the ricotta cheese. In order to save on time I made a half recipe of extra sauce and used no boil noodles. I think it would have been outstanding with fresh spinach like some previous reviewers stated.  My husband requested that I make it next time with shrimp and broccoli insted of chicken and spinach.

The only thing I did to change this was omit the spinach because no one in the house eats it.  It was delicious.  We are going to throw in some carrots and zucchini next time for a different twist.  You have got to try this!!  By the way, it doesn't take alot of dishes to do this recipe.

This is an extremely rich recipe. For my Hispanic family it lacked a little salt. For a family of picky hate veggie kids the spinich wasn't a big hit. For me I think I would have added a little salt and a little garlic to the spinich to give it more flavor. Will make again but not any time too soon. Very rich.

I loved this!  It tastes like something you would get from a nice Italian restaurant. Very delicious. It does make quite a bit. My husband, myself and two kids all ate and there was a ton left!

This was delicious. I took the other cooks' advice and used way less spinach. I also used salt, pepper and garlic salt when I cooked the chicken on top of the stove. Finally, I used less ricotta then the recipe called for because it was so heavy. I will definitely make again.

Great white lasagna! The white sauce is terrific - I used 2 gloves of garlic. I took the advice of others and cut the spinach in half, but it could've used more spinach so in the future I think I will use the amount called for. I also think the chicken could be increased (3 cups?). Spices were perfect. Definitely adding this recipe to my dinner rotation!

I have made this several times. This is my recipe I take to people after they have had a baby. It's always a hit! I do add red peppers and portabella mushrooms with the spinach, just to add a little flavor and color. And sometimes I grill my chicken just to give it a little kick!

I followed the recommendations to forgo the layering and simply mix it all together and it was wonderful and easy.  My husband prefers less spinach, even after following some of the advice to reduce the amount.  Otherwise, it was a delicious recipe.

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I only used one box of spinach because I bought one box of brocolli by mistake.  This was fine though.  Spinach was plenty with one box.  We LOVED the flavor.  My inlaws and parents came over the following day and loved also.  I'll make this again and again!

I made this for dinner last night - and while I would have rated it three stars, my DH liked it more than I did (as did my toddler), so it gets 4 stars. I changed a few things though, here's what I did. I used 3 large cloves of garlic, 1-10oz box of frozen chopped spinach and only 1/2 tsp each of dried basil and oregano (I think if I'd added the whole amount....the herbs would have been overwhelming). The end result was good, but I found it pretty rich. Given that my son and DH liked it so much, I will likely make it again, but if it were just me...I probably wouldn't.

When a house full of picky eaters give this a thumbs up, it has to be good. I have 2 teenagers that NEVER have second helpings of anything and they both went back for more. Enough said.

I guess I was really expecting something spectacular and it WAS good but not great. It was easy to make, I used only one box of spinach also and I thought that was plenty. Everyone liked it but I will probably not make it again.

this is actually a common recipe in Argentina (where my parents are from) a country full of Italians- I LOVE this recipe! I love pasta and especially pasta made with creamy sauces. Thanks for reminding me!! Made it just now- the portions of the ingredients are perfect in this particular recipe.

Very good and rich. I made this exactly as directed and I wouldn't change a thing. Many reviews thought they would reduce the spinach to 1 box, but I thought 2 boxes were fine.

Excellent recipe!  I used bacon grease to fry my chicken in; I then sprinkled the cooked bacon bits over the spinach. Total time for me was around 3 HOURS and not the 1 hour 15 minutes as noted in the recipe (I'm a beginner cook). My family enjoyed this meal immensely!

Never tasted a white lasagna, but I bet this one is the best!  Its so good.  It is a lot of prep, but well worth it.  I always manage to miss putting broccoli or spinach because of all of the other preparing I'm doing.  Made this for my family for Thanksgiving and they LOVED it.  Thanks for making me look like a superstar!

It was really good and a nice change from traditional lasagna. I cut down on the cheese a little bit and used cottage cheese instead of ricotta to make it a little healthier. 2 boxes of spinach was too much. There wasn't room for it and it wasn't necessary.

This recipe was excellent. The only thing that I did different was to use no boil noodles and I added an egg and some seasoning to the ricotta cheese. I will definitely be making this again.

Wow! This was absolutely delicious! Made this for a dinner party and my guests insisted on taking what was left with them. Added extra garlic as other reviewers suggested and made 50% more sauce. Will definitely be making again and again. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This recipe is great for many reasons. The first of which is that you can omit the spinach if people don't like it and it is still amazing. The second reason is that you can make this in advance, keep in the fridge and pop in the oven before your company arrives. The third reason is that it is oh so cheese and just perfectly seasoned. Enjoy!

I normally dont eat lasagna or spinach but this recipe is really good.  A friend of mine made it and only used a sprinkling of spinach instead of what the recipe suggested.  I did the same and it turned out great.

I used half the spinach, substituting baby spinach leaves, twice the garlic and a bit more milk as my sauce was very thick.
I didn't think it reheated well, the herby taste became overpowering. Five stars for flavour- it was mouthgasmic. Loses a star for poor leftovers and cost of ingredients- I only use freerange chicken and baby spinach ain't cheap!

This was a lot of mess but so well worth it!  I would recommend making 2 and freezing one. Update 2 years later: one of our faves in the routine!  Highly recommend!

This recipes makes a ton of lasagna, and it was really well recieved by everyone. The only set back is that it does take a while to create. I am a slow cook to begin with and this took me way too long (compared to regular lasagna)to complete. I probably will make this again, but I will be searching for short cuts along the way.

I used this recipe to make a vegetarian lasagna.  Instead of using chicken, I added some sautéed carrot shreds and more spinach.  I also omitted the parsley and added more cheese.  I was a hit with my mother and sister who are vegetarians.  They wanted the recipe to make for their vegetarian friends.   Excellent recipe!!!!

Awesome recipe!!!!! I had my family over for supper and they thought it was  excellent.  I did however make a couple of changes, I used brocolli instead of spinach, seasoned the chicken with granulated garlic, salt and pepper.  This recipe will be used for many years to come.   Thank you

Fantastic! A great change of pace from the traditional variety!  I used fresh basil right out of my herb garden and we also added some freshly grated romano cheese. It was great. Definitely a new favorite!

This lasagna was a hit.  I did change the recipe a bit. I kept the sauce the same but instead of spinach and chicken breast I used portabello mushrooms and boneless skinless chicken thighs  which I sauteed in garlic and then simmered in chicken broth.  I then hand shredded the chicken this made the chicken so soft and tender.  I def added more garlic and seasonings.  Overall this was a huge hit everyone loved it.

I added finely chopped broccoli in place of the spinach.  WONDERFUL!  The leftovers weren't quite as good, the sauce absorbs into the noodles...but they were still eaten all the same.  Very rich and cheesy, but well worth it!  This will be made again and again at my house!

Our family loved it!! Mom, Dad, 2 yr old, 5 yr old all loved it.  
The 9 yr old didnt want to eat the spinach....duh.  Next time I'll go easy on the onions... for some reason kids don't like to find onions in their food no matter how small.
Great family recipe!

I made this last night, serving one half for dinner and freezing the other half. It’s not spectacular, but it does have a very mild, soothing flavor that we both enjoyed. I followed the recipe exactly, and I will definitely make this again. I agree with the other reviewer that it needs more garlic.

This was surprisingly good. My hesitant husband had two helpings.  I followed recipe, except I didn't have enought spinach on hand, so I added a bag of frozen mixed veggies (carrots, asparagus, broccoli, red peppers, cauliflour) that I thawed, drained and chopped.  I thought it needed more garlic.  I'd recommend letting it sit after removing from oven before cutting it to let the sauce thicken.  It was kind of sloppy when I served it too hot.  I'll make this again.

I used mushrooms and broccoli (I sautéed the mushrooms and steamed the broccoli before adding to the lasagna) instead of spinach. I also didn’t boil the noodles. I had to bake it longer for the noodles to be done, but it worked fine. I thought it was time consuming to make and a little dry (might be why I had to bake it longer for the noodles to be done). It was a heavy meal for us and the sauce was very rich. Not sure that I’ll make it again, but it was okay.

Amazingly good.  If you boil your chicken right before, don't forget to save 2 cups of the chicken broth.  I used fresh spinach after microwaving on high for 1 and 1/2 minutes.  Used 2 cloves garlic and 1/3 an onion.  Skipped the fresh parsely...and it all turned out delicious.  The parents fawned over it.

This recipie is one that is used for special dinners just because everyone thinks it is so great. Although, it is a bit more time consuming than I am used to, it is definitely worth it!!  My family will sometimes go on strike until I make this!

This wasn't complicated, but it took a bit to get it all organized and ready to cook.  (I'm a mom with two small kids and it took longer then I normally like to spend on the preparation.)  But, it was tasty.  A bit too creamy/cheesy.  Too rich as some others have said.  My kids love pasta and they wouldn't really eat this.  And my husband didn't care for it much as well.  (my dinner guests said it was good but they may have just been trying to be polite! haha)  I probably won't make it again...But it did have a good flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe a lot. I switched out ground chicken for chicken breast because it's what I happened to have on hand, but I don't think it adversely affected the flavor at all.  I halved the recipe, but I thought that half an onion was too much. I found the sauce to be very thick and somewhat difficult to work with, but the taste more than compensated.  It was amazing! I thought everything about the recipe was great, ESPECIALLY the sauce, which was rich and quite flavorful (I didn't find it bland at all, and it wasn't *too* rich, just right).  I think it's a great variation to typical lasagna.  I only gave it 4 stars because my husband liked the recipe, but said he'd still prefer red sauce lasagna.  Oh and I put the lasagna under the broiler for the last 2 or 3 mins and it made the top all bubbly and golden - awesome!

This recipe was really good.  I don't know why some of the other reviews said that it was bland, because it really has a great flavor.  I made it for guests and they all devoured it.  Even my picky husband had a big serving of the leftovers the next day.  Trust me, if he goes for leftovers, it's a big success!  The reason I am only giving it 4 stars, is because it did come out pretty greasy on top, which I had to mop up with a paper towel before presenting it to my guests.  Now, part of that could have been my fault because I made it the night before and refrigerated it before baking, and the cooling down process could have caused the grease to separate while baking, but other than that, it was teriffic and I will DEFINITELY be making this again.

This was great - somewhat rich, so we had smaller portions, and then have lots of left overs! I did make some slight modifications, and it was still great: 1 bunch of fresh spinach, chopped; no-cook lasagna noodles; 2 carrots, 1 zucchini and a few mushrooms, all julienned. I used only 1 cup of mozzarella on the layers (I did use the 2 cups in the sauce). It was wonderful - will definately make this again.

This was really good.  First recipe in a long time that my husband said was a keeper.  I did only use 1 box of spinich as suggested by other reviewers.  Next time I will add some broccoli or asparagus as well and maybe cut back on the cheese a little bit.

This was a little too rich for me. Not sure what it was that I should change...but just seemed way too rich to be able to eat much of it. Tasted good but next time I will try to reduce some of the richness. Also, only used 1/2 spinach like others suggested and used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.

I made this dish for my boyfriend and our 3 roommates last night.  Now these are people who eat fast food constantly and never enjoyed homecooked meals until I moved in.  I love cooking and saw this as an alternative to a red tomato sauce lasagna.  My boyfriend loves lasagna, but isn't fond of tomatos.  This dish went over SO well.  Everyone had two pieces and it took all I had to snatch the last piece up to bring to my boyfriend's dad for his lunch.  I'm so glad I found this dish. 5 stars all the way across.  This is now a household favorite!

Very good! I only used 1, 10 oz package of spinach and it was plenty for my taste. My whole family loved it.

This was wonderful! I added a bit more milk for two reasons.  Mainly because I was using oven ready noodles and wanted to make sure it was not to dry and plus I wanted to make sure I had plenty of sauce.  It would be hard to go back and make more where it could be easy to just not use it all.  I can see how adaptable the recipe could be too!  We have family who are vegetarians and I plan to leave out the chicken and maybe use some heated frozen veggies (like a broccoli, carrots, cauliflower blend).  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I made a few changes like starting with a layer of lasagna noodles like you normally would with lasagna. I also used one package of spinach as 2 would have been way oo much. Next time I will try fresh spinach or maybe broccoli. I will use cottage cheese because I don't care for Ricotta (not sure why I didn't use cottage cheese this time. Over all, it was a great recipe and I will definitely be making it again!! Thanks!!

This recipe is delicious!  I made it for my boyfriend when we first started dating (to look like I was a gourmet cook). He loved it and raved about it to his roommate.  It is quite time consuming and very rich, but I wouldn't change a thing about the entire recipe.  Thanks Lisa!

This recipe is very, very good! I used the advice of some of the other reviewers and added more garlic and cut it down to one package of spinach, and it turned out wonderful. It takes quite a bit of time and effort to make, but it is well worth it in the end. Thanks for the great recipe Lisa!

This is really good!... very rich.  Definitely use good chicken... I sauteed two chicken breasts in kosher salt and pepper until done, then sliced into small pieces... yummy.  Oh, and I added sliced mushrooms... that was good too.

Great recipe! It was a little more work than I am used to but it was actually fun! I made it last week for my boyfriend and he is still raving about it. I only used one package of spinach but that's just to my liking. We are still eating leftovers and it still tastes great. Thanks Lisa!

This recipe is a nice change from the usual lasagna.  Our preschool kids didn't really care for this but the adults liked it alot.  I had my husband grill up some chicken breasts and I then shredded them up.  The spices we used to season the chicken plus the smoky flavor from grilling really gave the chicken alot of flavor.  I used a bit more garlic than called for and used only 16 oz of spinach which was plenty.  I also added some cajun seasoning to the white sauce for added flavor since it seemed a bit bland when I first tasted it.  I think next time I will try adding the bacon someone mentioned.

UPDATE:  Added fresh basil and bacon to the lasagna and it was wonderful.  Definately a really nice twist to the recipe.

This was delicious and unique!  I made the recipe exactly as stated.  The reason I give it 4 stars is because I found it to be runny on the bottom but dry on the top.  It also did not heat up very well as leftovers.  I probably won't be making it again for a while but will keep it in mind

This dish was ok but needs a little something to add a bit more flavour.  I doubled up on the garlic as per someones suggestion but maybe seasoning the chicken may help.  Still a good dish and I will try again.

I thought it was okay, but would be excellent with my homemade alfredo sauce instead! The flavor was just too plain for me.

This was pretty good, but I suggest on using different spices because the spice overwhelmed the sauce and that's what turned it off for some of my guest.  Also, if you use no boil lasagna, you will need to boil them because I didn't boil it the first time and the noodles did not cook at all because it wasn't able to absorb the sauce (yes, I threw away the first batch and had to make a new one).

This was so good.  I didn't add spinich this time, since I didn't have it, but I will definetly add it next time.  I added an extra clove of garlic, but pretty much kept everything the same.  Just added a little mozzarella to the top so that it could brown.  I will definetly make this again.

I used the sauce for this recipe but made a fully veggie lasagna.  I left out the spinach.  I used steamed broccoli and cauliflower as well as sauted thin slices of squash and carrot.  It got rave reviews.

Great recipe. Instead of 2 cups of chicken broth, I used 1 and added a 16oz jar of sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce. There was none left. Instant hit, which I will use again!

My husband loved this. I thought it was okay, thus the compromised 4-star rating. I didn't think the chicken added any flavor to this dish. Next time I may skip the chicken and add other veggies. Knowing how unhealthy this meal is with two pounds of cheese and a stick of butter also ruined it for me I think. I would have rather not known!

1st recipe I made, and it turned out great.  I had extra noodles & extra ingredience, so I made 1 reg batch, & 1 1/2 batch and froze it. I didn't use as much spinach in the 1st one, and it was great.  Used alot in the 2nd one, and it was not that great.  I would not try to make a 2nd and freeze it... it didn't turn out.  However, the 1st one was off the charts good!

This turned out pretty good in the end, but I had an awful time with the white sauce.  That is because I didn't exactly follow the directions given, so take it from me, follow the recipe.  I will make it again, as it turned out good in the end.

This turned out really runny for me.  I did make a couple of changes but I don't think what I did should have changed the consistency.  I added broccoli instead of spinach.  And cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  Maybe tomorrow it will be better.  Oregano flavor too powerful for me also. Husband only had one helping so that's a sign of a thumbs down for me.  Would not make again.  Good concept though.

This dish is perfect!  I've made it with 1 or 2 boxes of spinach - still awesome!  The sauce is rich and flavorful, and it's a perfect base recipe to substitute mushrooms, sausage, or even tiny shrimp or crab if you are not into chicken.  Thanks so much for this one!!!!

This was only "ok".  It seemed to be missing something flavor wise, and was just too rich.  Not quite worth the time (and dirty dishes) it took to make it.

This was just ok. The color was grayish-green and it was a little bland. I probably won't use this recipe again.

We thought this was a great twist on Lasagna ... We had company over and they also thought it was really good ... even asked if it was a family recipe.  Try it, you wont be sorry.

Holy cheese!  I was worried that the amount of cheese in this dish would be overkill, but it was excellent!  I used 4 cloves of garlic just because we really like garlic.  Mmmmmmm!
