The flavor was great. I used fresh rubarb and followed all of the instructions, but after the 45 min baking time my pie was nowhere near done so I baked it until the crust was golden approx 30 minutes more. The consistency was too thin. Next time I think I may try either doubling the flour or using tapioca to thicken the custard.

I made this pie over the weekend and thought it was very good.  I used light cream instead of half and half beacuse that is what I had on hand.  I would make this again, however, I might try it as a one crust pie instead of two, it seemed like too much crust masking this lovely custardy filling.

I have to agree with the others.  I also needed to bake mine longer than what the recipe said.  I also found the filling to be extremely runny.  The flavor was great but it was too soupy.  Maybe adding tapioca would help to thicken the filling.

This pie is very tasty, however I too had to bake it for 25 longer than called for, and agree that it is very runny.  Would definately use more thickening, either flour or tapioca.  Maybe because of the wet spring, the rhubarb is more juicy.  Would definately make again!

This is a rockin' rhubarb pie!  I baked it at 300 for 35 mins, since I made my own crust.  Then I did 350 for 10.  I will make this again.

Rhubarb and custard is a great idea, but mine, too, ended up more like rhubarb and cream sauce. Tasty, but not the best presentation. Old Betty Crocker cookbooks have good fruit & custard pie recipes, if  you want further guidance.

I baked the pie 400 degrees for 5 min and 50 minutes at 350 but still the custard did not set.   Not sure how to remedy this.  But it was very tasty - just runny.
