This is really, really good.  But I have one suggestion that will improve it a great deal.  I never cook white rice, so I can't speak knowledgeably about it.  But, if you use BROWN rice, try soaking the rice in water for about 20 minutes before cooking  (be sure to drain it), then cook the rice in plain water with just a little oil or butter and NO salt (or chicken broth with NO SALT CONTENT).  The rice will cook faster and turn out MUCH softer and plumper with presoaking and without the salt.  To get that chicken broth flavor, you can add chicken bouillon after the rice is cooked.  Brown rice cooked in a salty liquid just doesn't ever get really done.

Use Crimini mushrooms (Baby Portabello's) and beef broth...Double up on the amount of mushrooms...Vegetable broth can also be used....Top w/ grated parmesean cheese just before serving and sprinkled with some snipped chives.

Excellent! Just pay attention to the rice/lquid ratio. 1 to 1 for minute rice or 1 to 2 for long cooking rice.

This is a yummy recipe.. turns out great everytime... i use my rice cooker to cook this and i find that the broth - rice ratio should be 1:1, especially if using white rice (i use basmati). I have cooked this several times when i have had unexpected guests and it turns out great...

Let's just put it this way...I served this to accompany some beautiful veal chops and I could have eaten the whole darn pan...of this rice.  (I didn't, but that's because I restrained myself) Rather than sauteing the green onion, I used red...and added the parsley and some chopped green onion just before serving - and most likely more butter.  I'd love to try this with dried porcini mushrooms, using the soaking liquid from the mushrooms to cook the rice. It's a simple name for a simple rice side dish but it should not be underestimated.

Thanks for the inspiration for tonites dinner. I just finished making the best mushroom rice ever and hubby said the greens i made to go with it were not even needed.  I started off by using about 2 tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of oil and I sauteed about 20 small button mushrooms maybe more thinly sliced, 5 cloves of garlic thinly sliced, 2 spring onion and 1 medium onion cut in half and thinly sliced, few sprigs of thyme because I love it, a teaspoon or so of dried oregano a teaspoon or more of salt and a few dash of worchestishire sauce for about 15 min until the mushrooms were really soft and dark brown. I then added the rice and cooked the rice in the mushrooms for about 10 min max stiring a lot to avoid it sticking over medium heat. Then I added beef stock to get the added brown colour and taste. YUMMY! I let the liquid come to a boil then i put on the lid and put the heat on low and then once the rice was still firm but all the water was absorbed i took the lid off and took the pot off the heat so that the rice wouldnt over cook while it cooled down a bit. So excited for left overs tomorrow, i wanted to lick the pot when it was done it was good.

This rice was really good - I served it for company and it was real easy to make and much better than plain rice. If you use long-grain rice, it is only 1 cup rice to 2 cups broth.

WE LOVED IT!  After the first review, I was kinda leary, but it worked out great for me.  I had a box of Rice A Roni on hand (just in case) and it was put back into the pantry.  My 15 month old soveled it in!  I used Minute Rice & cut the cook time down kinda like you would with Minute Rice & it did not turn out dry at all.  Thank you Jennifer!

Be careful when using long-grain rice! I used 1 cup of rice, which is a normal 4 servings for us, but needed 2 cups of broth.  With that adjustment, it turned out fine. Nice side dish.

What is not to love about this recipe, it has MUSHROOMS in it! :D  I used Olive Oil though in place of butter to saute the mushrooms/onions....served it as a side to the San Diego Grilled Chicken...

This is a really easy side dish to make and it can be paired with something like London Broil which is what we had this evening.  I didn't have all of the ingredients (no onion or fresh parsley) so I used minced onion and dry parsley instead and it turned out wonderfully.  I cut the mushrooms into a larger size than coarsely chopped and it was a huge hit at dinner.  I did a 1:2 ratio with white long grain rice to 2 cups broth.

If you saute rice in butter/oil with garlic, ginger and onion before adding the liquid, it will not be bland. Add salt as well. I made this today and it was good. After reading some of the reviews I tweaked it a little. I always saute rice in oil, butter or ghee ( clarified butter) with onion, garlic and ginger before adding liquid. This time I wanted to stay somewhat true to the recipe so I didn't add ginger. I put couple drops of sesame oil. Only because the bottle was on the counter. I did add 1/2 cup of carrot and 1/4 cup of peas for color. It was very good. My picky daughter ate it as well. Next time I'll add chicken and a fragrant rice. Like jasmine or basmati rice.

I modified the recipe in the following way and my husband and I really liked it.  Plus, it's super easy to make.  
Alterations to recipe:  2 cups diced mushrooms,
1 cup cooked chicken - diced,
1 tsp dried rosemary,
1 Tbsp sherry,
no parsley.
Everything else from original recipe as written.

I made this with olive oil instead of butter, and jasmine rice. Needed more salt than what I added but that was my fault, also used low sodium free range chicken broth from Trader Joe's. Yummy & fairly quick weeknight side dish.

This was really good. I cooked in beef broth with a mushroom bullion cube. Also froze a portion for later use and it tasted great two weeks later. Will be making this more often.

This is a good base recipe that you can add on whatever you would want to make for your more liking.  I did adjust some other stuff to make it more like my preference; added yellow onion (chopped) instead of green onion, and added a small amount of cumin and caraway for additional flavor.  Very nice side dish :)

Felt like I am missing something after all these good reviews. Personally, we didn't find it flavorful. If there is a next time, I would double the mushrooms, garlic, onion and parsley.

This was very good.  I used yellow onion instead of green and then sauted the onion, mushroom and garlic.  I added the chicken broth then put the mixture into my rice cooker with the rice. This worked great as my rice cooker has a steamer basket that I can steam veggies over the rice in.  I made some chicken seasoned with greek seasoning to serve on the side, but it just got mixed into the rice.  Thanks for a great recipe

It was good, but I'm used to just white rice. I think it was because I cooked it with vegetable broth instead of chicken stock to make it vegetarian. It was different. It might be 4-5 star if cooked as the recipe says.

I took NixieChick's advice about brown rice and soaking for 20 mins before using to cut down on cooking time. This was so yum! Even leftover it is fantastic. I will take the time to make rice this way because the effort is worth it and we get the brown rice in!

Very yummy, flavorful rice--nice change of pace to your average white rice!  I think the only thing I would do differently would be to add in green onions along with the other veggies instead of just white onion; it would add another interesting flavor as well as some color.

What a delicious, quick, simple, healthy recipe! And I'm not even a mushroom fan. I think the key to making this recipe is using a high quality chicken broth. The only thing I had trouble with was getting the rice soft (i used brown). I'm thinking next time I will cook in in my rice cooker first. I did make several adjustments but I believe the original recipe would be just fine as is :) here is what I changed: I made homemade chicken broth with a couple chicken breasts, carrots, half an onion, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper. I boiled that until the chicken was just done. The. I removed the chicken and cut into bite  sized pieces. I added a couple stalks of diced celery and the other half of the onion from the chicken broth with the mushrooms. I also doubled the amount of garlic. I ended up cooking for almost 2 hours waiting for the rice to soften. I added more broth several times and stirred the chicken in towards the end. Easy meal!

I really liked this! Out of necessity, I had to make a few minor substitutions, but not enough to substantially change the recipe. I didn't have the green onion, fresh mushrooms, and parsley on hand, so I used about 1/4 of a regular onion chopped up, chopped about a half a can of well-drained mushroom pieces, and 1/4 tsp dried parsley. (It was an impromptu dish and it was all I had, what's a working mom to do?). Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely be making this again.

This was very good. However, I prefer using the sweet onion in this dish rather than green. I like the savory combination of mushroom and onion. That's just me.

This was really tasty.  I used basmati white rice since I always have this in the house, and I used regular onion instead of green onion.  I left out the parsley, and added 3/4 of a cup of parmesan cheese and 1/4of a cup of 1/2 and 1/2.  So in the end the consistancy was risotto-ish. The kids loved it.  We will make this again.

Made this with brown rice instead of white rice and the rice was slightly undercooked.  I can tell that had the rice been cooked to perfection the flavoring would have made this one a real winner.  Everyone enjoyed and will definitely do again.

Mmmmm...I used a lot more mushrooms (portabellas), a bit more garlic...then I always do. I didn't have chicken broth but used a 10oz. can of beef consommé. Very tasty, a nice change from regular rice, and was nice and easy...will make this again.

This was really good.. I ended up using an 8 oz container of sliced mushrooms and that was the perfect amount.   Also, for timing reasons I used minute rice and a can of broth plus a little more water for the liquid portion, but next time I definitely want to use regular long grain rice.

This rice tastes fantastic. I changed only a few things because I was out of them at the time. Instead of green onion, I used a very small amount of purple onion. Instead of parsley, I used a garlic and herb spice mix. It came out wonderfully. I know my family is going to love it.

Loved it! Few changes. I used half a yellow onion (didn't have the green on hand,) also had 1 1/2 c. vegetable stock, with a Not Chick'n (Vegan) bouillon cube. Added half a cup of water and doubled the rice to 2 c. Also used fresh parsley. I mixed liquid on the stove, then added the mixture with the rice into the rice cooker. Will be making again, and again!

I love the recipe but had to increase the heat to cook down the fluid at the end of 20 minutes.  I will decrease the amount of broth next time to see if I get the results others have in the past.  I think people probably should stick with white rice only with the fluid measurement in the recipe.

I really liked this dish... I will say that the rice didn't cook completely. It was time for the stove to go off before fully cooked.. i tried to let it sit a little longer but it got a little too sticky.. 

I also didn't have any chicken broth in the house so I used Beef broth.. really good

I used all of the mushrooms and a lot of onions..

I LOVE THIS DISH

Easy and quick side dish. I used more mushrooms and more garlic. Also since I had bacon fat leftover from breakfast, I used that to saute the vegetables. Long grain rice topped it off. 1 cup rice to 2 cups beef stock for long grain. Make your own beef stock by dissolving 2 beef bouillion cubes in 2 cups water. 22 mins made my rice fluffy.

Awesome.... made it last night for a dinner with friends.  All enjoyed it very much and I was asked for the recipe today.   I subbed in red onion for the green, and I also used brown rice (soaking it first and adding liquid and cooking time).... it was fantastic, in the end.   I'll do this again, and again!

I'd give this 5 stars but my boyfriend said 3 so 4 it is.  I used crimini mushrooms.  I sauteed them alone for a few minutes in the butter before adding the garlic and green onion. At the end I topped the rice with grated parmesan cheese.

This is a super easy and delicious recipe. I didn't have chicken broth, so I just used water and added some salt & pepper as well. I had more mushrooms than called for and I think I pretty much used more of everything, but it just made it more flavorful. This can be a great side dish or main meal. Thanks Jen!

Very easy and delicious!  When it was done it was watery, so I left the lid off and when I came back to it the rice absorbed all the water and the rice was perfect.  I eye-balled the amount of sliced cremini mushrooms, and it turned out great! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I made a mistake but will be trying this again.

I cooked my rice in water before looking up the recipe.  OUch, not much flavor.  I am going to simmer in Beef Broth , and hope it turns out "all right."
  Can't wait to try again though, it looks delicious.  :)

just okay.  I like the general idea and would use something like this again.  I used crimini mushrooms which I didn't care for and made the rice like usual with a 1:1 ratio.  this rice might need more water tha that to make it creamier.  thanks.

Made this tonight to go with my Magic Fry Talapia and OMG, it was PERFECT!  Only change I made was to use shallot instead of green onion and I doubled it to feed a crowd.  I am a bad rice maker, but this turned out just perfect.  Would give it 10 stars if I could, thank you!

I made this as a side dish for a Valentine's Day dinner. I was easy to make.  I did add one additional green onion for extra flavor and color. Tasted great. Even my six year old loved it.

Absolutely loved it! I doubled the garlic because of personal preferance and I did use 1 cup of chicken broth instead of two. Instant Rice instead of uncooked. Boyfriend & his 11yr old son had seconds :-D They said they'd like more mushrooms next time though.

This is really, really good :) I added lots and lots of mushroom and half an onion. We served it with spicy chicken pieces and couldn't think of a better combination. Thanks for this recipe, I made a large batch the second time and added a couple of portions to the freezer, can't wait to have it again!

I used brown rice and homemade roasted veggie stock in place of the chicken broth.  It took about 5 cups of broth for my brown rice to cook through.  The end result was a deliciously creamy (almost risotto-like) rice.

This is an awesome recipe, Had it the other day sans wine, so sad all gone... tonight again, substituted fresh spinach for parsley, and olive oil for butter, and added grated carrots and diced celery.  Such a great base recipe to play with!

After reading reviews and hearing the complaints about this being a bit bland, I tried to spice it up a bit.  However, it still turned out pretty bland for our tastes.  I may use the idea in the future, but will add some more seasonings to spice it up and make it a bit more interesting!  Used the leftovers to make veggie fried rice, which was good!

This was very good - I made a couple of changes. I used olive oil instead of butter to saute the mushrooms. I used onions instead of green onions. At the end, i added both freshly chopped parsley and basil. It was very tasty.

We really liked this.  I had some chopped, dried portabella and shiitake mushrooms that I rehydrated then used the broth as part of the cooking liquid, which really amped up the earthy, mushroom flavor.  Not a big fan of onions so I skipped the green onions but that's just personal preference.  The garlic that I used had a nice, big bite.  This is a great, basic side dish that went well with the pork tenderloin my husband grilled.

Holy cow! That was a good recipe! I didn't have any green onions, do I added about a small teaspoon of onion powder while frying the mushrooms. And at the end I added Mrs Dash seasoning instead of salt and pepper. Made this as a side for some English style battered fish.

Had this tonight with the steamed spinach (in a microwave) recipe from this site and a chipotle chile chicken recipe I have.  I used 5 minute white rice.  I sauteed the mushrooms, white onions (not green), and garlic until pretty much done in vegetable spray (not butter).  I added my vegetable broth (not chicken) to the same pan with mushroom mixture while coming to a boil.  Then let the rice sit for 5 minutes in broth off the stove.  Please watch your rice, if it sits too long, it will become mushy.  This was delicious.  Light and flavorful.  We all enjoyed it.  Would make again and again.

Loved it!  I've fallen in love with baby bella mushrooms recently, so I used 4 of those and 2 button mushrooms.  I also used brown rice, which takes more chicken broth.  My kids loved it too!

After tasting my first attempt I removed some of the rice as I ended up with alot and not much veggies in comparison. I wanted a more flavorful dish so I quickly cut up more onions (3) and garlic (2 more). I also added more mushrooms.  I sauteed these in a little more butter till soft and added it to the existing rice.   I used Basmati Rice as it is far superior. What a knock out! With these changes the enhanced flavor I realized I could easily add sauteed chicken or shrimp for a main dish! The taste is "delish"!  I served this rice with Allrecipes "Famous Butter Chicken" and corn on the cob.  The flavors blended beautifully!

I am so hung up on this recipe!  It did not come out all that flavorful but it should have!  Needs more butter, garlic and onion.  Maybe my chicken stock was too bland?

I couldn't find any other measurement for the mushrooms so I used 4 oz.  Next time I'd use the same amount but try baby bellas.  Also, I toasted the rice in the pan for about 5 - 7 minutes after the veggies were soft before adding the chicken broth.  This all made it a 5 out of 5.  My family is already asking me to make this again.

This is a nice, easy weekday side. This was much better than the usual boring sides. I will regularly substitute this for those boxed rice mixes, in the future. Also, it is totally okay to substitute on the type of onion, and spices for this recipes. I used soup base + water to make the broth. Thanks for the quick side :)

This is a nice tasting, easy to make recipe for flavored rice.

Prep time for me was only a few minutes to cut the veggies up and prep the rice. I used Jasmine rice that I bought from an Asian market. Because I'm used to washing/rinsing my rice before I cook it, I noticed that this extra process reduced the need for the amount of chicken stock called for in this recipe. I only used 1 cup stock to 1 cup rice. 

If you rinse the rice and use 2 cups stock, the dish will end up mushy.

I did this using regular white rice and after 30 min of simmering I added another 1/3 cup of broth and put it back on for another 20 min.  So after a total of 50 min simmering, it still wasn't done.  The flavours were nice but texture was way off.

I used brown basmati rice, and it turned out pretty well.  We had a lot to do that evening, and this was nice, simple and quick (we weren't that hungry, so this was our main dish).

It was a little skimpy on the ingredients, though.  I used close to twice the mushrooms (shitake and cremini).  If I had it to do over again, I would throw in at least 3 cloves of garlic (disclaimer: I'm Indian) and at least 4 green onions.  I forgot the parsley, but I'm not a big fan of that anyway.

Make sure you use fresh pepper.

On the whole, it was good--I would make it again.

This was fairly easy and pretty tasty.  I did add more mushrooms than called for, but it still wasn't quite enough (odd as this sounds, there was still too much rice in the rice:mushroom ratio for our tastes).  I think next time I'll add more mushrooms and cut back on the rice a bit.

It was good and easy. However, it came out a bit mushy in terms of texture, and it definitely needed some more flavour. Maybe using less liquids and adding more spice would help.

Very good a lot of flavor, I did use instant rice and let it crisp up on the bottom, gave it a nutty flavor. Served it with Fantastic lemon butter fillets it was a nice contrast with the cod.

I usually only make rice when we have something saucy to go with it.  After making this I have changed my ways. Its a wonderful side dish and very easy to make.  I would add more garlic as other reviewers have said to give it a bit more flavor. I didn't use green onion either because its not something i keep on hand.

After the mushrooms have cooked for awhile,add the rice and saute for a few minutes before adding the broth - gives it a slightly nutty flavor and improves the texture.

Very fast and easy.  Tasted Great.  I used jar of mushrooms and minced garlic out of jar because I didnt have fresh.  My kids liked it and they never like flavored rice when I buy it in the box.  It is a really great side dish with baked chicken.

We loved this recipe! I used canned mushrooms because that's all I had and used chicken bullion instead of broth. If I'm giving it 5 stars with those changes, I can't wait to try it with fresh mushrooms and real chicken broth.

I hate to say it, but this didn't turn out like I would have liked.  Should use 2-3 times all the fun ingredients and less rice or more water since it turned out a little dry and boring.  It has potential though which is why it gets the 3 stars.  I made it will brown rice (non instant)

Nice little rice dish. I went back for seconds. I made one change, I used a small white onion instead of green onion. Otherwise great as written!

I used brown rice which needed to cook longer.  Near the end of the cooking time I placed fresh green beans on top and just let them steam.  DELICIOUS!!

I made a lot of changes to this recipe based on the reviews I read. I used dried mushrooms so I used 1 cup of the water for cooking. I also added corn to the pot just for some colour. I sautéed onion garlic and mushroom

I really enjoyed this. I've followed the recipe exactly and thought it was a good substitute for plain white rice as a side dish. This last time I had 3 small Chinese food containers filled with leftover white rice from dinner the other day, about 2 1/2 cups cooked, and wanted to do something with it besides make rice pudding so I decided to try this. It turned out great. I sautéed the mushrooms in butter first, then added in the cooked rice, added about a cup of chicken broth and simmered for about 10 mins with the lid on. Turned out great :)

Great recipe. I made this last night as a side dish for pork tenderloin. I used 8 Baby Bella mushrooms and brown rice rather than white, which gave it a nice "meaty" texture.  Brown rice requires more liquid and a little longer cooking time than white rice.  I used about 3 1/4 c. chicken broth to the 1 c. rice and cooked for a total of about 30-35 minutes. I also increased the  green onion to about 2 1/2.  I think measured seasonings are important with rice to avoid blandness. I used 1/2 t. salt and 1/4 t. pepper.  Rice cooks better if you cook it in a no-stick sauce pan with a glass lid and do not stir or remove the lid during the entire cooking time to keep the heat and steam in. A little of the rice on the bottom of my pan stuck and caramelized but I scraped it up and stirred this in at the end which  added color and some crunchy little flavorful bits.  Yum! I could see stirring in some toasted, chopped pecans as a nice addition as well. I also added in about 2 T butter at the end to add some creaminess.  It was delicious!

I sauteed some regular yellow onion with the mushrooms and garlic and when the rice was done I stirred in the green onions and the parsley. I used about 1 3/4 cups of broth instead of 2 cups and it worked very well for me. Yes, u can add more mushrooms if you really want them to stand out as I felt they got a little lost in the rice. It looks like a lot initially but once the rice cooks it doesn't look like much anymore. So, adjust accordingly. My husband liked this rice very much. It was a nice change for us. I served it with steamed carrots on the side and Modenese Pork Chops from this site.

We all loved it. I only strayed from the recipe by using more mushrooms. The add-in possibilities are endless. Next time I might try adding pine nuts...or not. It's delicious the way it is. Thanks for posting!

Agreed! This rice is delicious and so easy to make. I've made is 3 times in 3 weeks. One time it turned out dry but that was because the lid wasn't sitting right when I left it simmering. So you want to made sure it's covered!

My husband and I liked this rice a lot. This is what I called, "clean out the pantry rice" because I was trying to use up things that we already had at the house instead of having to go to the store. It worked perfect for that. The rice didn't have a lot of flavor to it, but instead was a more subtle flavor. Normally I would serve this as a side dish, but since I didn't want to shop for ingredients to make dinner we had this for the main dish. I added some shredded chicken that we had leftover from the other night which made this a little more filling, but I don't think that changed the overall flavor much. Thank you for the recipe!

Easy and excellent.  I made this with a bumper crop of porcini mushrooms that grow wild on our property.  I sauted them slightly first...then completed the recipe as directed.  I lovely side dish for a Sunday roast chicken.

This was a good dish - a nice change from the usual white rice.  I didn’t have any fresh parsley so I used dried and that was the only change I made.   I think if I had used brown rice I would have liked it a little better.

I love mushrooms and since I had 12 baby bella mushrooms on hand, this recipe worked in my favor. I did not use any green onions since I had none on hand but I did use chopped fresh chives. I also added a little minced shallots. I put a Tablespoon of butter with 1 T of evoo on a pot. I heated it, added the shallots, fresh chopped garlic and stirred with the sliced mushrooms. I added a mixture of long grain white rice and brown rice with 2 cups of beef broth. I chose beef broth instead of chicken to give the mushrooms and rice more of an earthy deeper flavor. The cooking time was approximate and this was the perfect amount since I was cooking for two people. Not only did this recipe turn out great tasting, this complimented the, "Alaskan Salmon Bake with Pecan Coating," and "Quick and Easy sauteed Spinach," all from this website. This mushroom will be made again an again with other types of meals. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

As written I found this pretty bland. However, I added fresh ground pepper, sauteed onions, more garlic, grated Parmesan cheese, and some mushroom powder. After adding all the seasonings we really enjoyed it.

best homemade rice I've ever had. I do think next time I will add a little bit more chicken stock but that's my only complaint.

It was a little bland, but everyone enjoyed it.  I did triple the mushrooms, 8oz baby bella, 8 oz white, 8 oz restaurant mix.  Next time I will add more garlic too.

This rice looked and tasted so fancy and was so easy to make! I doubled mushrooms and garlic  and used basmati rice, the rice was perfect in 20 min. I will try to add some asparagus and maybe red pepper next time!

This is a great, basic rice recipe.  I use 2-3x the amount of mushrooms and base the amount of chicken stock on the type of rice I'm using.  Add pepper while cooking the mushrooms, but wait to add the salt until the rice is done cooking.

Best rice we've ever made! Reminded us of our favourite risotto at a fine Italian restaurant. After reading reviews, I made some minor changes: 
Increased garlic to 2 cloves (can use 1 teaspoon from a jar). For a stronger flavour, I added 1/4 cup chopped yellow onion instead of green onion. I sauteed the onion with mushrooms & added the garlic, in the last 3 minutes, to prevent the garlic from burning. I used Uncle Ben's long grain converted rice & beef broth instead of chicken broth. After sauteing the mushrooms, onion & garlic, I added the rice & sauteed it for 3 more minutes, before adding the broth, for a better flavour/texture. I also added 1/2 teaspoon salt & 1/4 teaspoon fresh cracked pepper, with the broth. Thank you Jen!

I'm the author of this recipe and I'm so glad that so many folks have enjoyed it!  What became a 'what can I toss in to dress up the rice' improvisation has become a 'signature dish' of mine and is always a crowd pleaser.  Remember to go with YOUR tastes--more mushroom, more garlic, more onion, veggie broth, chicken bullion, whatever you have and make it your own!  This is excellent with chopped chooked chicken for a quick week night meal or VERY excellent as a bed for shish kebab.  It's a huge hit with my vegan friends served with grilled asparagus and squash!  Happy cooking!

My switcheroos: I used Crimini shrooms cut chunky so they wouldn't cook down to nothing, added the garlic at the end of sauteing to prevent browning, used regular onion instead of green onion, and only partially sauteed the onion/shroom mix since they would continue to cook in the broth. I followed Nixichick's advice about soaking my brown rice prior to cooking, but I still used chicken broth.  This was a nice change from plain rice, and went well with the Grilled Fish Steaks we had. Will move to the Keeper file.

I LOVE this dish! It was easy to prepare and is very versatile. I could eat this alone for a meal. I served it with oven fried chicken also from this site. My husband rave about both. I didn't have any green onions so I used 1/2 of a regular yellow onion instead. I also just "eyeballed" the spices. I don't know if it's due to this cooking in a skillet or not but I didn't have gummy textured rice like I have been cursed with lately. That pleased me to no end. Kudos to the author!

I only had Minute Rice so I used that and cooked for a shorter period.  Also added celery to onions and mushrooms and sprinkled toasted almonds over all at the very last.  Delicious!!!

I used oyster mushrooms in this one and also added some yellow bellpeppers to it, which gave it a hint of sweetness from the bellpepper.  It was good.

It doesnt specify what kind of rice to use and I opted to use long grain rice instead of the japanese rice.  I think it's better since if the japanese rice was used, it would come out sticky and a bit less flavorful.  Dont get me wrong, I LOVE japanese rice but the long grain rice matches better.

We've been making this recipe for YEARS! A former neighbor turned my mother on to this recipe and it has now become a must-make for my sister and I. The only thing different we do is that we use beef broth and a little more butter, which is delish also, but the chicken broth probably gives it a more subtle taste. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Jennifer! I hope others give it try! I think they too will add to their "must make" collection!

My guests and I enjoyed this a lot. I did change the recipe slightly. I sauteed the mushrooms, onion and garlic and in a SEPARATE pot I cooked the rice in the chicken broth. Then I added the mushroom mixture to the rice before serving and garnished with some more green onions. I served it with Scott Hibbs Amazing Whisky Grilled Baby Back Ribs, the BEST rib recipe on this site! However, the rice has a nice mild flavor that would make it a great side dish for almost anything.

This was a pretty good recipe, I made it with garlic chicken.  I didn't use the green onions because I'm not a huge fan.  Overall it was good, will probably make it again, not fantastic.

Great way to 'jazz' up white rice, which we have at least once a week with our grilled chicken.  I thought it should be a 1 to 2 ratio with the rice to liquid, so I only cooked 1 cup long grain rice in the 2 cups broth.  Added a little extra garlic and some red pepper flakes while sauteing the veggies.  Will add this one to my keeper file!

This was an excellent choice for something relatively quick and different from what I normally make, and it was delicious. Since I decided to make it on a whim, I didn't have every ingredient on hand. I substituted Spanish onions for the green onions, and used dry chopped parsley. It still came out wonderfully. I also added some pulled chicken breast and made it a meal. I'll definitely be making this again.

I thought this recipe was simple to make and very tasty. I had to substitute 1/4 cup minced yellow onions for the green onions, but I think that was a minor deviation. When I make it again - which I definitely will! - I will double the amount of mushrooms, but that's a personal preference.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this last night with the Chicken Oreganato from this site and I must say that this is one of the few times that my rice actually came out right. I used a sweet onion and a celery heart in it. No other changes were made. It was very good!

Need to watch your rice/water measurement. Most rices are 1-1/2 times the water to rice.

Yummy!! Make sure that you use only long grain or extra long grain rice for this recipe. Using a short grain or glutinous rice will yield a sticky mass that is not ideal for this type of mushroom pilaf.

The recipe was perfect as it is but next time, I will triple the mushrooms. The results of this dish depends on 2 factors: 1. The quality of the ingredients. I used premium long grain rice and brand name chicken broth. 2. Proper cooking of rice. DO NOT OPEN THE LID AT ALL DURING THE COOKING PROCESS!!! The ratio for rice to liquid for long grain rice on stove top is 1:2. I used a 14 ounce can of chicken broth and 1 cup of rice. I did not add the extra 2 ounces of liquid because there was enough moisture in the mushrooms to make up for that. It came out delicious!! I served this with Amy's Garlic Chicken (from this site) and sauteed spinach. This recipe makes a nice side dish to any roast meat or fish. Not only is it delicious, but easy to prepare and dairy free. Thank you!!

i made this once as written but doubled the mushrooms. this time, I used brown rice and water instead of broth and white rice. I put in maybe 2.5 cups of water, then added adobo (oregano, garlic powder, and chicken bullion) spice after cooking. I think it took longer than 20 minutes. Added a couple of handfuls of baby spinach in the last 2 minutes, and it's nice and creamy!

This recipe was great! As a fairly new mushroom-eater this was an easy way to introduce mushrooms into my diet. I used to hate them but I am gradually becoming a fan, and this recipe helped! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and brown rice instead of white. I also skipped the parsley but added some rosemary and basil. Served on the side of maple salmon from AR and it turned out to be a delicious meal!

I put all the ingredients into a rice cooker, and it turned out delicious, the rice was cooked perfectly as well as the mushrooms and onions as well. This mushroom rice dish went perfectly with the Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs. Perfect combination!!!!!

I thought this was very good. In fact, it was just what I was looking for, to serve with Chicken Piccata, so I did not want a strong or bold flavor. I did saute the rice for a few minutes before adding the broth, and I used shallots instead of green onions. We liked it alot, and will have leftovers for lunch tomorrow, combined with the leftover zucchini and carrots.

Great recipe! I actually didn't have mushrooms the first time I made these, but it still was very tasty. It's a great way to jazz up plain white rice to go with basic meals.

I wasn't impressed by this recipe. It tastes like my usual white rice, but with add-ins. The use of chicken broth instead of water keeps the rice moist, and not sticky. Perhaps using a shallot or regular onion would make a difference, because the one green onion didn't come through in the taste at all. May try this again sometime.

Loved it! I used more mushrooms, garlic and onions than called for and it had great flavor. I also used olive oil and a little light butter to replace the regular butter. This beats ANY boxed rice mix and it's easy too! Thanks for posting. :)

I cooked this with brown rice (adding chicken boullion after the rice was already cooked since brown rice doesn't cook well in salty liquids).  The rice was a bit mushy, but the flavor was good.  Next time, I will add a lot more mushrooms and will probably use more flavorful mushrooms to enhance the taste.

I used brown rice so I increased the chicken broth to two and a half cups. I also added a couple more tbsp. of butter and used organic chicken broth. I really liked this as did my oldest son, but my husband and youngest son did not. Too bad....we get the leftovers.

We really liked this rice.  It makes a great side dish.  It's flavors are subtle and don't overpower the main course.  We find it's a good complement to roasted chicken.

Easy to make and flavorful. Next time, at stage where the rice is to be cooked, I'll move everything into my rice cooker for ease. Another review says that for rice cookers, the broth/rice ratio should be 1:1. Keep mushroom in large pieces so as to vary the texture. Add sunflower seeds or almond slices for a little crunch

Pretty good recipe.  I'd use it again.  I used brown rice and found that I needed to use 3 cups of broth.  Two cups and the alloted time of 20 min didn't work for me. I had to simmer for about 30 min.  Even then, all the liquid was gone but the rice wasn't done.  So I added another cup of broth, brought it back to a boil for about 3 minutes and then simmered it until all liquid was gonee and it worked. Very tasty!

Not a great mushroom-rice recipe. I followed the instructions and used cremini mushrooms and jasmine rice ...and the smell was weird and so was the taste. I was disappointed and won't be making this one again.

This was pretty good. I found I had to cook a bit longer for the rice to cook 100% through, however I doubt it was the recipe's fault (probably mine.) I'll make again, maybe throwing some dill in next time.

This is pretty good.  I doubled the recipe and used 4 cups of chicken broth (2 boullion cubes to 4 cups of water).  Next time I might use 3 boullion cubes to make it a bit more flavorful.  It needed more salt which I added.  But maybe I should have added more.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and WOW! It was absolutely amazing. Very easy and clear instructions and it came out perfect.

There wasn't a lick left everyone liked it so much. I think I might even make it again tonight!

WOW!!!  This rice was so good! I was trying to get away from "white rice" again for dinner so I found this today and I love mushrooms so I went to the store and bought the stuff. I had dinner ready when dh got home from work but I had to rush out and didn't even tell him what I made. When I got back home the first thing he said was "That rice was excellent".Almost half the pan was gone and he was the only one eating. Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely delicious!  This rice dish is easy to prepare, oh-so-fragrant, and an excellent accompaniment to a wide variety of foods.  It is also easy to change the ingredient amounts according to the number of servings you need.  My husband likes mushroom flavor, but not biting into big mushroom pieces.  I used a Zyliss food chopper (using a knife to chop works fine, too) to turn the mushrooms into tiny bits before cooking.  This is my favorite rice dish, for everyday suppers and for entertaining guests.  Try it!

I used brown rice so I cooked it a little longer and I also used low sodium beef broth instead of the chiken broth because I was serving it with filet mignon.  Excellent recipe!!

Yum! This was fantastic.  I rarely actually follow a recipe exactly, but I pretty much did this time and I'm so glad because this turned out great.  I had to use bouillon instead of chicken broth because I can never find it. (I live in France.)  I prefer shallots to onions so I used those and a bit more garlic for personal taste.  THANKS A TON FOR A GREAT RECIPE!

Overall, this was a good recipes - nothing too original, but tasty.  I used minute-brown rice; next time I will definitely use regular-cook rice.  I added my own spice choices to it.  It was tasty though!

oh my god, i LOVE this recipe. i use boullion for the stock (boohoo, i would have preferred real chicken stock), left out the parsley, & substituted white onion for green. & it turned out fabulous! i love that this doesn't have the nastiness of creamed soups (even though the salt & msg in the boullion leaves a little more to be desired..) & it was so good! i know this will be a staple in my diet in the future! i used white rice & it did come out a little hard.. maybe i will add a teeny bit more of water next time.

Great recipe. Just as another member stated, you have to use it as a base and make adjustments suitable to your taste. I love garlic and green peppers. so, I used 6 cloves of garlic crushed and chopped two stems of green onion. I used Smart Balance butter instead og regular butter. After combining the onions, garlic and mushrooms, I added 1/4 cup of white cooking wine letting it boil down to half its liquid content. I poured in the chik broth and rice. I had no parsley but my taste buds were too happy to miss it.

Very good. Used oil instead of butter, 2 cloves garlic and a vidalia onion replacing the green. 1 1/2 cup chicken broth worked best with a long grained rice I used. Would make this again.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe!  I usually have to make a double batch because he eats so much of it.  The only thing I do different is add more garlic than the recipe calls for.  I also add garlic salt instead of regular salt.

I can't believe this recipe doesn't have five stars.  I made it for a dinner party and it got absolutely rave reviews, even from one person who doesn't really care for rice.  Since I love garlic I used two cloves, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I've already made it twice, and I just printed out the recipe five days ago (and have passed it on by request).

Made it as indicated in the recipe except for the chicken broth.  I stay away from meat and meat products during Lent, so I used water instead.  We salt our food at the table, and after a sprinkling of salt it was perfect.

This was very yummy indeed! I had some leftover brown rice that I put in to the pan w/the liquid from the mushrooms. It allowed the rice to soften up a bit and added more flavor to the rice. Thanks for this easy side dish recipe :)

I added a little bit of soy sauce and balsamic vinegar when cooking mushrooms. The rice was so much better than cooking it in the rice cooker. Very good recipe, thank you!

I didn’t have onion so I used onion powder. It reminded me of a mushroom risotto I got from Trader Joe’s. It was pretty good. Would work well as a side dish

Great recipe. I altered slightly and made in the Instant-Pot (equal parts rice & broth, 4-minutes of pressure cook time, and the 10-min natural release). Yummy and comes out perfect every time!

This is one of my family’s favorite rice. And my daughter doesn’t like mushrooms! But since they are hidden she is fine with it. She still remembers when I made it for her 12th b-day as a side dish for the Chicken Cordon Blue I. Great recipe! You cannot go wrong with it.

Delicious. I'll make it again. No changes needed for the recipe! It's so easy to make and quick.

I actually used brown rice and basmati because it was all I had but it was still delicious. Also I used vegetable instant stock mix instead of the broth.

This was very easy and tasty.I added an extra clove of garlic and used chicken stock instead of chicken broth. I also topped it with the sliced greens for the green onions before serving. I will be making this again.

Loved the rich flavor of mushrooms, however I put a whole lot more shrooms in there than the recipe called for.  If you are a garlic fan, don't hold back on that either.  My wife inhaled it!

Followed this recipe very closely with minor variations and it was an AMAZING, flavor-packed side dish!  Variations: Jasmine rice, garlic paste and brought chicken broth to a boil before adding rice (quick stir, cover with lid, and reduced heat to a simmer for 20-25 minutes).

I used  8 oz. mushrooms, beef broth, and this is the first time I've ever cooked a green onion, but it came out really good. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried. I cooked this dish in a large skillet. I used about 4-5 green onions (scallions). Next time I'm going to try using a leek. Mushrooms and leeks are among my favorites. Will be excellent!

Delicious! I increased the rice to 1 1/2 cup (jasmine) and the chicken stock to 2 1/4 for more portions. I also used yellow onion for the green and added 2 tablespoons of Marsala and the rice in during the sauté part. I chopped up pan seared chicken thighs and added in when rice was cooked. I'll make this a one pot meal next time by cooking the chicken first and then sautéing the rest in the bit of oil that's left. A keeper for sure and fun to play around with. Thanks!

My only suggestion is to bake it. I mix all of the stuff together and I bake it at 350 for about 30 minutes. It adds a good flavor to it.

This was a great side wish to go with some beef I grilled. The only change I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric to get that yellow rice color. I've made fried rice with similar ingredients but flavors in cooking rice this way definitely get infused in dish.

It's quick, easy and light and I've made it several times already.   I did cook Success packaged rice as the mushrooms were cooking and added it when they were done. I've also added peas tto the recipe.  It's delicious, either way.  Now one of my favorites

Definitely double the mushrooms (or even triple!). 
Delicious recipe! Brown rice and vegetable broth were substituted without issue.

Definitely pay attention to the rice/broth ratio. The rice is almost bland in my opinion, but with a little extra spices it's much better.

This was a great side dish I made with a roasted pork loin. My wife and daughters loved it! It is very flavorful and creamy, so much so, that my wife thought I used a stick of butter in the recipe! The only change I made is that I used an 8 ounce container of sliced baby bellas and rough chopped them. It was just as good the next day

I will be making this again.  I made it with half the garlic and accidentally cooked the parsley with the garlic and green onion.  It still turned out wonderful.  I would double the mushrooms and add onion next time.   I ate it with chicken.  Very good together!

Very tasty.  I used more mushrooms than called for and drizzled a tiny bit of truffle oil over it before serving.  Will definitely make it again.

Turned out great even though I burned it a little. Used Basmanti rice and it turned out real nice! Just used canned mushrooms and diced em up. Then used chives.

Delicious, quick and easy side dish.  So good it ended up being my main meal. Tried the first bowl with topped parmesan like one of the reviewers suggested, another as written without variation and the last with peas mixed in as I always like peas with rice. All 3 ways were excellent.

Fantastic!!! Hubby loved it!!! Made a couple of changes...
1. Used purple onion (what I had on hand) and sautéed it with the mushrooms and garlic.
2. Added the white rice and slightly browned it before adding the chicken broth. 
3. Added a bay leaf, used dried parsley flakes and let it all simmer until almost all juice was gone. Stirred and removed from heat. Let sit with lid on for about 10 minutes and it was perfect. Will be making this again!!

Very tasty variation on a rice dish. I used mushrooms, garlic, yellow onion and green pepper, all chopped, as the veggies. Added cilantro instead of parsley at the end.

I pretty much used it as a base. If you like just the flavor of the mushrooms it would be great but otherwise a bit bland. I added a pinch of red ground pepper. I do that with most things. Just before the rice was done I added 1/2 chopped red bell pepper and about 1 1/2 cups chopped fresh broccoli. I added about 2-3 Tablespoons of sour cream and a little more water to keep it from sticking. I put the lid back on and let the vegetables steam until crisp tender. While the rice was cooking I grilled a chicken breast cut in thirds flat and rubbed with Montreal Chicken Seasoning. I cut the cooked chicken into thin strips and added it to the rice dish just before serving. Served with a green salad. Some might like cheese on it but it really didn't need it. Everyone liked it even my daughter who normally picks out the broccoli.

This was really good and so easy to make. The only adjustment I made to the recipe was that I used 2 green onions and omitted the parsley. Both my husband and I really enjoyed it and I can see this dish making regular appearances on our dinner table. Next time I prepare this, I think I will add a splash or 2 of marsala wine to the mushrooms as they cook.

This recipe is a keeper I halved the recipe but otherwise I followed it to a t . I made it as a side dish for  two and still  had some leftover the only thing I will do differently next time is  add more mushrooms or use  portabella caps instead.

I made one small change and that was to use Better Than Bouillon (Chicken) and water vs. the chicken stock. That made it a little overpowered with chicken flavor, but that was my error. The smell in the house was fantastic as it cooked! Thanks for sharing. I will make again but just use real chicken stock the next time.

This was THE BEST rice. Cooked it as per the recipe and added celery. Used Basmatti rice, sautéed the mushrooms etc in a wok and finished it in the wok. It was perfect. Could add left over pork, chicken etc. for a meal.

I tried using different types of mushroom and it turns out great although I recommend if you were to use some type of mushroom you need to make the mushroom all mushy first so it'll be easier to mix with the rice :)

Not bad...love the individual ingredients. I like this dish better with an increased amount of mixed shrooms (used Shitake, Portobella, Cremini and Oyster). I used shallots, green onion and white onion plus doubling the garlic. I used Long Grain Brown rice. I'm not convinced on the sauteeing of rice before cooking it...can't recommend or discourage doing this. I did do it, adding it to my aromatics prior to using the chicken broth...at least this first time.

I thought with a few tweaks I would like this recipe more.  So here is what I did and it turned out great!!  I sautéed portobella mushrooms, garlic, salt, pepper, and regular onion (instead of green onion) with butter.  in a pot I put my rice, water, parsley and 3 beef bouillon cubes ( instead of using chicken broth, I added 3 beef bouillon cubes. I felt like beef flavor would go better with portobella mushrooms) I also used jasmine rice (it's my favorite!) it seriously turned out amazing. I will definitely make again with these same changes.  :)

I always cook the rice first (use brown) then add to the mushrooms, etc. and add the broth to cook down. Makes it more like risotto. Use EVOO instead of butter for healthier version.  Made this a number of times.  Excellent!

This has made its way into regular rotation at my house. Everyone loves it. It's good as is but better, in my opinion, by doubling the mushrooms and garlic. Excellent as a jumping off point for as many different variations as you can think of.

I made this last night to serve with crispy spicy chicken thighs.  However I used at least twice the veggies and included a celery rib.  I sauteed them in half evoo and half butter (1 TB each) then added my pre-cooked brown rice along with a cup of water and half chicken and half mushroom base (1/2 tsp each.) (I like to cook up raw brown rice by the 1-2 lbs bag and freeze it in 2 - 2.5 cup portions.)  Anyway, it got nice and risotto like; I finished by adding a generous TB of butter.  When having leftovers for lunch today, I decided it needed about a third cup of grated Parm .... that did it.  Excellent!!  Even DH liked it...both times and there is enough left for one more meal.  Thank you!!

This was good. It was easy and the recipe didn't need much tweaking at all. I only added additional broth since I was waiting for other food to finish. However, the flavor was a bit underwhelming. I think next time I will add more garlic or use a more mushroomy mushroom.

This didn't do it for us.  I added chicken to the finished rice and all in all it was a very bland dish.  I feel like it needed a sauce or more flavors added while cooking.  I've made very tasty rice dishes, but this one didn't compare.

I took the advice of other reviewers and sauteed the rice with the onion, mushrooms and garlic for 2 min. I added pine nuts as well, it gave it a nice flavour. Thanks for the great recipe, I love mushrooms!

Really not impressed with this recipe.  It came out more of a gummy mess.  I was looking for more of a creamy risotto type mushroom rice.  This wasn't it for us.

Very flavorful. I left out the onion and parsley but otherwise made it as written. A great alternative to a prepackaged boxed rice sidedish. I kept the 2:1 liquid to rice ratio as that's how I prepare my basmati rice.

This is a good recipe. I added alot more parsley and 1 more green onion because it was bland. Even though I added those it was still a bit bland but it turned out nice. I enjoyed eating it but I'm not sure if I will try to make it again, thank you though.

This rice was good but slightly bland. I did cook my rice with chicken broth my rice cooker to make things easier and I used baby portabella mushrooms. Next time I think I'll add more garlic and herbs to add some more flavor but overall this is a good base recipe.

I really enjoyed this but my husband wasn't quite so enthusiastic which is why it gets a 4. I used button mushrooms which I halved. I added the rice and let it cook with the mushrooms for about 2 minutes before adding the stock. One of the few rice recipes I've made where I haven't had to add extra liquid. Thanks for sharing your recipe Jan.

It was very good, but I did make some adjustments. It turned out a bit soupy, so I used less broth the next time and it was fine. I did add significant amounts more garlic, green onion, and mushrooms, just for personal preference. It was very enjoyable, but still a little bland for my tastes. Looking to try new spices next time I make the dish.

This was pretty good. I like how once you got it going, you didn't have really do anything to it. Gives you some time to prepare everything else. I made as written this time, but next time I will add more mushrooms and some parmesan cheese for extra flavour.

Only four stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly--after reading previous reviews I added four cloves of freshly pressed garlic and three green onions for extra flavor.  Also, I seem to be unable to cook rice stovetop, so I made my rice with the broth in the rice cooker separately.  I sauteed the mushrooms in a little olive oil and added the green onions and garlic near the end for extra flavor and then cut in the rice.  Due to personal preference I omitted the parsley all together.  It's AMAZING!

This was good don't get me wrong, but it didn't have a whole lot of flavor as I was expecting. It tasted like plain white rice with a tad more flavor than usual from the chicken broth. It was still good & was a nice way to use up some mushrooms I had in the fridge. I made Chinese green beans from this site & mixed them in with the rice & the sauce was a great way to liven up the rice!!!

I think the original would have been too bland for us. I used 4 garlic cloves, and added a small chopped onion. Also I used cilantro instead of parsley, so it would go with our main dish better. With the adjustments it was super yum :)

Nice subtle flavor.  We liked this a lot!  I did increase the butter to 1 T. for a little more flavor, but other than that I followed the recipe.  Next time I won't add the parsley until after cooking the rice, so it will maintain its nice bright color.

I made this today for the first time and made some modifications to the recipe.    first off i doubled the recipe. I used 4 cups of water, 2 chicken bullion cubes.  I didn't have green onion so I used a medium onion.  in addition I added 1/2 red pepper 2 pieces of bacon and 4 cloves of garlic.  I sauteed all of the vegetables together in the bacon grease.  Turned out very tasty albeit less healthy.

We made this rice and it was very delicious and creamy. We substituted dried parsley for fresh (we didn't have any on hand) and used portabello mushrooms. We loved it. It went great with filet mignon and steamed brocolli.

I was a little skeptical on the the cooking method for this rice because I have never add anything but broth before cooking my rice. Well it turned out great! I used a white onion finely diced as that is what I had on hand, sauteed it with mushrooms and it came out perfect!

I made this a lower calorie/lower fat dish by using "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter," the variety with only 5 calories per tablespoon (or thereabouts). It is a spectacular side dish. I didn't have fresh parsly, so I used dried with good success. I served it with grilled chicken (Cornell Chicken Marinade) from this website. As others have noted, minute rice requires a 1/1 ratio of chicken broth to rice.

Really easy and good.  Followed recipe exactly.  Served with Zesty Tilapia with Mushrooms from allrecipes.  The two went together very well.

This was good - a simple, tasty dish. I used pre-soaked brown rice, so I added an extra 1/2 cup of water. I didn't have a green onion, but a regular one worked fine.

Before I made this mushroom rice, I wasn't expecting it to be very flavorful as the ingredients seemed pretty basic. I was so wrong! I made this rice with cremini mushrooms and the rice was packed with rich earthy flavors. I served it along side garlic lime chicken and it was a hit. The only change I made was substitute fresh parsley for the dried version. A great side dish!

This recipe was really good.  I didn't have green onion so I subbed a red onion finely diced.  Worked great.  Will definitely make again.

This rice was good, but I think it would have been even BETTER if I had some of the ingredients (i.e. parsley and green onion). I also used a chicken bullion instead of broth since it´s not available here. I am sure it would have been 5 stars if I used what the recipe called for. My bf just complained and said I should give it 5 **´´s !!! hahaha

Love this rice. Made it with both white rice and brown rice on different occasions. With brown rice, I just follow the water/rice/cooking time proportions on the package. I've used regular onions as well--whatever I have on hand. I've also added cooked chicken to make this a meal. Delicious, versatile, and quick. Thank you!!

I have never been able to make rice but this recipe is easy and sooooo tasty!  I made it for a small dinner party and got rave reviews! Now I am making it on Sunday as one of the side dishes for my Easter ham.  My husband devours it!

This was delicious and exactly what I was looking for. I used dehaydrated minced onion and beef broth instead of chicken but it came out perfect and we both really enjoyed it. Definitely will make again.

This is a really delicious rice recipe. I made it using whole grain brown rice an used the 20 min presoak advice given by a previous reviewer, however I kept everything else the same. I served it topped with the Tex Mex Talapia also found on this site. All the flavors were wonderful together! Thanks for the recipe, definately a keeper!

this is a fav. dish of mine, that my mom used to make...slightly different. Here is my version:
2 cups instant white rice
1 pack fresh mushrooms-sliced
celery-chopped
1 onion-chopped
garlic to taste
1 can chicken broth
1/4 cup butter
salt & pepper to taste
Combine into covered casserole dish, bake at 350, for about an hour, or untill veggies are tender. 
I found this recipe to be very easy, because I can throw it all in the oven beside my meat and dinner is done. But, Im sure either variation is great!

I'm giving this 3 star only because my family didn't care for it at all. My hubby is a big rice eater and he loves mushrooms so I thought this would be a hit but he gave it a 2 out of 5 stars. Personally I loved it had a awesome smell, tasted great,and was easy to make. I followed the recipe to the "t" and it turned out beautifully just not our taste but I will recommend it to others. Thanks.

I live in a hotel during the week for work so my kitchenette is not always well stocked, needless to say I used a small onion and crushed red peppers instead of green onions and parsley, and this was great.  I will definitely make this again. Thanks.

I liked it.  I have to restrict sodium, phosphorus, and potassium.  Which means that my diet is very limited.  I like rice, but I was never a big fan.  Now, I'm learning to like it.  This isn't potatoes, but it is good.

Me and my roommate both like mushrooms, so we just added some more.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh, too.  Still turned out good.  This dish is simple and good.  I will definitely make it again.

I triple the amount of mushrooms and taking some of the other reviewers' advice, cut down the ratio of chicken broth and rice to 1:1. Turns out really well. The only thing is, the bottom layer of rice is burnt and I had to throw it away, probably because of the type of pan I use, should use a better pot next time to prevent the rice from burning. Will definately make it again.

Nice twist to a basic rice dish!  I used sliced canned mushrooms because that's what I had on hand and I used 1/2 a diced onion instead of the green onion.  I like green onions except that sometimes they can be a bit mushy after being cooked for a long time.  I also used brown rice versus white, because my family is so used to it that they prefer the brown rice now.  I sauted the onions in the butter until soft added the chicken broth, brought it to a boil then added the rice and mushrooms.  Cooked on low for 40 minutes then sI stirred in salt, pepper and fresh chopped parsley.  Nice flavor and you don't even need any gravy!

The only problem I had making this recipe was that about 1/3 of it burned before the cooking time was up.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, unless it had something to do with the fact that I only had the boil-in-the-bag 10-minute rice.  I used that and followed the directions exactly, but close to the end of the cooking time I heard it start to pop and smelled it starting to burn.  (It could just be my tricky gas stove).  What didn't burn was really good though!  I'm definitely going to try it again.

I will definitely be making this again.  My husband loved it, and it's pretty simple and cheap to make. I made this with Rempel Family Meatloaf, and they were meant for each other.

This was good.  The parsley gave it a nice flavor.

This is a quick, easy side dish that would go well with anything.  It's also a great base recipe; you can add almost anything to this and it would be great!

I made this for 60 people as a side dish at our church's annual Sweetheart dinner. It was good, but not excellent. I wish I had played with it more. Needs more seasonings. Good one to play with. Will keep trying.

This rice dish was wonderful. I doubled everything since I was having a large crowd.  I used Minute Rice and since the box called for equal parts rice and liquid, I did increase the rice by 1 more cup (still not equal to the liquid but was afraid it would be too soupy).  I left the lid off the pot and cooked it until the liquid was all absorbed and it was sooooo good!  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was tasty.  We used beef broth because that is what we had.  We will try the chicken broth next time.

Thanks!

This was really great! I used brown rice so cooking time was approx 30-35mins rather than 20. I also used more mushrooms, as well as 2 spring onions rather than one onion, upped the parsely and used vegetable stock rather than chicken broth. I topped it with a little grated parmesan and served with stuffed and crumbed chicken and mashed potatoes with mushroom sauce. This was one of the nicest rice dishes I have ever tried, healthy too and it will definitely become a regular in our house. Thanks :)

Great recipe, husband and children enjoyed it, I used water instead of chicken broth, and my husband would have preferred chicken broth but otherwise it was a hit. My 5 year old daughter loved it.
