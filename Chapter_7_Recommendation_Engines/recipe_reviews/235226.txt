I used a homemade taco seasoning and a ginormous red pepper instead of green. Because I used Roma tomatoes, I cut up more than one. This lasted maybe 15 minutes out of the oven--the boys inhaled it. I didn't even get to try it. Apparently, it was delicious.

Easy, ingredients all on hand, AND very good! I really wanted to add a jalapeno, thought about garlic, my imagination seemed to be working for a change.  In the end, I like to make the real recipe as is so the only "change" was making my own Taco Seasoning and I had no tomatoes so I opened a can of stewed tomatoes and used that.  I sprinkled a few green onion pieces on top after it came out of the oven for a little color pop. TERRIFIC! I wouldn't change anything, a nice kick without burning. I served with Fritos. Thank you shae! photo by Lucky Noodles, #MyAllrecipes #AllrecipesFaceless

Awesome for parties and special events.  I decided to swap one cup of sour cream with one cup of cream cheese and I added shredded lettuce on top before serving.

Easy to make and accepts modifications if needed. I forgot to get green onions, put the green pepper and white onion in with the meat so that I didn't lose the onion taste.  I bought tomatoes but when I went to use them, mushy.  Chose to swap them out for salsa which ended up a great addition actually!  Highly recommend.  Served with scoops and fritos.

I made this but left out the green pepper and doubled it for a party; it came out awesome.  Highly recommend this recipe!
