DELICIOUS! Made exactly as written and would not change a thing. I formed these earlier in the day and put them in the fridge, just to let all the flavors mingle. I also added some onion along w/ the lettuce and tomato. Great flavor...Will be making these again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were ok, but a little on the sweet side for me. I did use deer instead of beef, due to a food allergy in my household. While the had a good flavor,  they just didn't have the wow factor we were expecting.

These were pretty good, but I was expecting more.  I'll make again, but it won't be a regular.

Excellent! I used ground pork instead. It makes sweeter burgers, so I suggest a pepperjack cheese, or some fresh jalapeno for a balancing kick.

These were good. My son wouldn't eat it, and my daughter loved it. Has a nice flavor to them, think that's what threw my son off. I would make them again. Next time I will have a few plain ones.

Amazing! Exchange bourbon for Sherry whiskey (1oz for two parties) added 2 tablespoons of diced sweet apples, laid on top of spinach and a coconut oil toasted sour dough slice :)

I made this recipe with 2lbs of meat and so adjusted the seasonings to match. My husband and were excited with the first bite but soon our bites slowed... We had to add more and more ketchup! What we think happened is that the Worcestershire sauce was just too much. It became overwhelming. I will definitely be trying this recipe again, using less Worcestershire sauce by a lot (for 2lbs it called for 2tblsp and 2tsp). I'll start there. I think it'll make a big difference! Looking forward to a refined recipe and will update this when I've got it figured out!
