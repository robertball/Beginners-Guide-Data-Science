Made as written except that I used chicken breast tenders out of personal preference. I fried 2 pounds and 2 eggs were enough for what I had. This was a good recipe but I think it would be even better if you doubled the amount of seasoning for your flour. 5 cups is a lot of flour for the seasoning to get lost in. Overall great recipe and one I would make again.
