I'm sorry to rate the recipe so poorly, but as written it is WAY too salty. I followed the recipe to the letter....with the exception of only putting in 1/2 as much salt....and it was still not edible. 
 Corned beef is very salty on it's own. I am assuming that the recipe is based on non-corned beef and wasn't adjusted.

TO ANYONE MAKING THIS DISH.....taste first at the end of cooking before adding ANY salt.

You must either WASH the corned beef and rinse, rinse, rinse, or use brisket!! The original used brisket, but i personally  preferred the mistake so that's what i wrote. If you choose to use the corned beef, cut out the salt from the recipe..

Cut the salt down by half (at least!!!) and this is the perfect curry recipe for non-corned beef. I used round steak. It's probably great with chicken or just veggies too.

Very good dish. I didn't have coriander and I only put in 1\4th the salt. I added more vegies too.

I liked it. My boyfriend so-so. It is really a stew with curry flavour- nice comfort food. We added lots of veggies: eggplant, mushrooms, zuchini,cauliflower and lots of garlic. Added curry powder as we did not have cardomon. Taste better warmed up the following day

The husband made this, so I'm not sure if it's the recipe or he's just terrible at cooking. The corned beef was underdone and tough (it should be boiled / simmer 40 minutes per pound by itself before adding other ingredients). There was a spice that was too overpowering and grainy on the tongue (turmeric, maybe?). Lastly, corned beef is already densely salted, so it doesn't need more salt added. This recipe adds two teaspoons! So the meal was grainy with crunchy meat and salty enough to taste like the ocean.
