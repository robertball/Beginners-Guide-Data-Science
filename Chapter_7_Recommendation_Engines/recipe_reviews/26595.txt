Chateaubriand is a classic french dish. This is not it. Do not be misled, while you may or may not like the recipe it is not Chateaubriand. If you would like to try the real thing, you won't be disappointed. While the recipe may vary, the basics of this dish are a pan seared centercut tenderloin cut into filets after cooking served with a Tarragon Bernaise sauce. Anything else is not Chateaubriand.

AWESOME. I followed the instructions exactly and the fillet tasted like the last one I had at Taste Of Texas restaurant! It is so simple, yet so delicious.  If you love a good steak dinner, you must try this. I've shared this with everyone I know and am getting rave reviews. Another reviewer suggested making a sauce - so I did and served it on the side.  I just added a couple of tablespoons of Merlot wine to the steak pan, scraped up the crusty fon and let it reduce a little.  Outstanding. Rayna you are very gracious for sharing this with your All Recipes friends.

Well, I have mixed feelings as far as this recipe goes. Yes what was left of it tasted great, but I'm just not sure that it was worth the second degree burns...
there should be a couple warnings added to the recipe like 1) use ONLY THIN steak. 2) never cover it. 3) don't cut the meat to check for level of rarity. 4) most importantly, don't do all these things at once
THE MEAT WILL EXPLODE IF THESE WARNINGS ARE NOT FOLLOWED CAUSING EXTREME BURNS!!! (other than that, it tasted ok)

This is a 5 star PLUS recipe!  I've made this dish twice, and each time it was superb.  My husband -- who is my biggest fan and most constructive critic -- commented both times that it was the best steak "we've" ever made, cooked to absolute perfection! 

While the fillets are "standing," I add about 2 tablespoons red wine or brandy to the butter and drippings remaining in the skillet.  If you deglaze the pan with this, it makes a lovely sauce to drizzle atop the sliced fillets.

As a vegetarian I do not cook meat, however I wanted to prepare my fiancee a special meal of surf and turf.  I found this recipe and tried it based on the 5-star rating.  Plus, it was easy too!  My fiancee can be extremely picky about how his meat is cooked so I was nervous.    I cooked the filet exactly as instructed (5 minutes on each side gave a med-med/rare) and can say this is fool proof!  My fiancee absolutely loved the recipe, and ate every morsel with delight.  Highly reccommend!

Fast simple way to make tenderloin steaks.  I usually wrap mine in bacon before cooking.  Becareful not to over cook the meat.  Even though my husband prefers meat well done he will eat these at medium.  Anything more and your steaks start to dry out.

Delicious! Restaurant Quality! To make it a bit more like the famous steak house (R.M.'s) we use more butter.

This recipe blew me away! I didn't think making such slight changes to cooking method would make that big a difference, but it did! I followed the instructions to a "T", and enjoyed a perfectly cooked, steakhouse quality meal. Thanks for sharing your expertise, Rayna!

The absolute best. Loved it so much we are having it again tonight. Served with roasted red potatoes laced with bay leaves and herbes de provence (a recipe in this month's Bon Appetit).

I give this high ratings for a Filet Mignon recipe. (Technically, Chateaubriand is the center 20 oz. or so of a beef tenderloin served typically with a Bearnaise sauce.) None the less this is a tasty, easy recipe.

I followed the instructions exactly, up to the cooking time per side.  At 6 minutes a side, the meat was still cool in the middle and I just couldn't palate it (literally).  A little more cooking, a little more resting and I must say, it was exquisite!  Thank you so much for this simple, elegant recipe.

Using Olive oil (instead of Veg oil) and Penzey's Mignonette pepper (instead of fresh ground).  Less butter.  Bacon wrapped filets.  I absolutely adored this, though the kids were a bit less than thrilled.  So juicy and flavorful!  When you can't grill - this is the way to go.

Ok, after all the reviews, I thought this would be awesome.  It tasted like butter and completely ruined a filet I had.  I will go back to only grilling steak.

Absolutely awesome!  This is top-dollar restaurant material.  The crispy texture is perfect for the yummy, tender center.  And I LOVE the fresh ground pepper taste!  Perfect on it's own, though would be good with a sauce, I'm sure.  Thanks, Rayna!

Yummy! We enjoyed this method of cooking our steak. Its so flavorful, and the crispy crusty outer portion was wonderful. We enjoyed this with the ultimate twice baked potatoes and the spinach salad from this site. Thanks Rayna.

Very nice recipe. I used a whole chateaubriand cut of beef then sliced it at the table. This is a simple recipe rendering a nice steak without being overwhelmed by other flavours, allowing the natural beef flavour to stand out. Thank you for the recipe.

I followed the recipe and really enjoyed this steak.  It smoked up my house but I still will do this again when it is too cold to grill.  Thanks

This was a good basic recipe but I added salt to the meat as it was cooking.  I also added red wine to the butter, then added the meat to the mixture for about 30 sec.  Absolutely delicious!

I don't know if this is the right place. But, I liked the way you used to show the movie about making things. I liked the way you saved things, it was more simple. For some reason I can't get the movie to play this new way.

You can get hung up on the name of this recipe and whether or not it was authentic Chateaubriand, but bottom line.....it was superb!   Used top sirloin filets and it tasted like a restaurant steak.  My husband usually grills our steaks but this was a delicious alternative!

Great way to make a delicious steak when it's too cold outside to BBQ. Our Rib Eye and New York steaks were only 1" thick, so I monitored the cooking time a little by using my instant read thermometer and stopped at 130 degrees. Perfect!

this is an excellent way to cook a piece of beef tenderloin but as another has said, Chateaubriand it is not.

AMAZING!  The most important ingredient is choosing the best cut of meat! Pan seared in a cast iron skillet, is the authentic prep for this wonderful cut of meat.

Very simple and a great alternative to cooking steak on the grill. It can be used with just about any type of steak. Just adjust the cooking time according.

Tried this recipe using a thick (1") 1lb delmonico steak, cooking 4 minutes per side for medium.  A nice technique if you can't get outside to grill.  We like a lot of flavor, so next time I might add herbs or other seasonings.

I can't believe how easy this was!  We let it go a couple more minutes (2 minutes per side) Since it wasn't room temperature and since we like our meat with just a touch a pink... thanks for the great recipe!
