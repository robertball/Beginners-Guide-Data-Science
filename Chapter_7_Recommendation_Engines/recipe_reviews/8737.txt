This recipe had way too much salt.  I didn't use any and found that the soy sauce made it salty enough.  Seemed to lack much flavour except for the soya sauce.

I radically changed this recipe to avoid the salt. I usually make about 40 lbs at a time though!!(around 150-170 wings) Also,I added the fresh ground ginger root for a bit of a snap.This feeds around 80-100 people given that we also do lobster tails,scallops in bacon and many different salads. Anyway,for 3 lbs...

In a bowl,combine:

1Tbsp salt
3 Tbsps sugar
1/2 tsp ground ginger (or more,to taste)
1 tsp fresh ground ginger root
6 Tbsps HOT water (to dissolve)
6 Tbsps good soy sauce (check Asian markets for the good stuff!!) Kikkoman works
2 Tbsps Tanguerey gin.

Stir until salt and sugar are dissolved.
 place around 16 wings in a 1 gallon ziplock bag.Pour in the marinade. before closing,remove all air possible!!

Marinate a minumum of 24 hours,the longer the better,turning every few hours.(I do a minumum of 36)

Deep fry (sorry grease haters,but it's WAY faster) at 375% for 5-6 minutes,or until deep golden brown

Turn out onto paper towels,dab off grease and keep warm in a 200% oven until ready to serve

Wonderful flavor. I followed the tips and only did a bit of salt and baked for a lower fat version. Came out great!

i also agree with other reviews that this recipe was way too salty. i think maybe next time instead of marinating it for 24hours i will marinate for 24 minutes.

I agree with the other reviews, way to salty!  I will try again cutting the salt to about 1 tablespoon.

I also added about 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice which gave it alittle more flavor than just soy.

So yummy. I baked mine in the oven on cooling racks set on cookie sheets. They still came out nice and crispy, but much lower in fat I'm sure :)

I was dissapointed.  I usually bake my wings...it's much less messy and isn't as fatty.  I thought these would be the wings from the Kowloon restauraunt in Saugas, MA.  This recipe didn't come close.  It was just okay.

I didn't have the gin, used chinese cooking wine instead. Left out most of the salt, 1tbsp only. Next time I leave out all the salt. I added 1tsp. onion powder and 0.5tsp garlic powder. All chinese food has ginger, garlic and onion. I only had 4 hrs to marinade. Worked out great, a bit salty. I'd make it again for sure. My whole family gobbled them up. Took about 5 or 6 minutes to cook in the hot oil.

I followed this recipe just as it is written and I don't think I could alter it to make it any better. However I did use a generic brand and small party piece wings, I will use a better quality of chicken  next time and shop for good size wings. A very good and easy recipe that this cook is sure to use again.

Like many others mentioned, there is too much salt. The wings ended up tasting like salt, followed by soy-sauce.

I started making the marinade but i didn't have any whiskey on had. I tasted the marinade and didn't like the flavor at all. I ended adding some more ingredients,baked it, and dosed it in BBQ sauce. Everyone seem to like...they didn't love it.

Made these wings for a restaurant project I had to do with my foods class. They turned out well but a bit salty. I used 1.5 tablespoons of salt and that was well enough for the pack of wings I had with them. Definitely a recipe to make if you like a wing which is not too hot. In the end I was very satisfied with the recipe and it was an easy make.

Great recipe! However my husband is diabetic, so I substitued the white sugaer for Stevia and omitted the salt, because soy sauce itself is salty. Even my 5year old grandson said they were "Delicious" He wanted to know where I brought them from:)

This was okay, but I feel I’ve had better.. Also, I went for the tips and took the salt out since there was the soy sauce already. Not sure if this is something I would make again since it didn’t impress me that much..

These were really good, but I boiled down the marinade and put some more on top before baking them (400 for 45 minutes) and I think that made them extra salty.  My fault.  I grew up on Kowloons wings, and I love them (OMG Saugus Wings!).  I think next time I will make them without the salt, double the ginger, throw a handful of garlic in, and maybe use brown sugar instead of white.  I know this changes the whole recipe, but hey, the heart wants what it wants.
