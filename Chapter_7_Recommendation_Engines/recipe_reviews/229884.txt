Loved this tasty recipe!  I had two colored peppers to use up, so I halved the ground beef and rice.  I did use more than half of the spices called for, and had no tomato sauce, so I just used tomato salsa from the fridge.  Also diced and added the tops of the peppers to the mix. The two step method of preparing the peppers was a bit time consuming, but the softness and texture was perfect, I'll use this method for other recipes. I packed the peppers with filling, and easily had enough stuffing left for one more, I suspect with the full recipe, as written, you will get enough stuffing for at least five, if not six peppers.  A hit with hubs, I'll make this again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR, Michelle!

Being married to a Puerto Rican, I made some changes based on what his mom usually adds to her meals. I used diced potatoes instead of rice (which I LOVE by the way), added Saz√≥n and Adobo. It turned out really well.
