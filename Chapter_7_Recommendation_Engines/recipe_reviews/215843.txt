I made this dish tonight and it was really good! I did however use fresh spinach because I think it tastes better than the frozen. I added more mozzarella, and the  only problem I found was the sauce was too wet. Next time I think I will use 1/2 the amount of vegetable broth.

Love this!  I use no-boil lasgagne noodles (tends to be a lighter dish as the pasta is thinner), a package of fresh spinach and a jar of artichokes in water, not marinated, and it's terrific. The herb and garlice feta is found by Athenos. I make a large pan, bake it all, but then freeze a few slices for me to reheat a week or two later for a hot lunch.  Have made this for several groups  functions with rave reviews. YUM!

I used rice noodles as my husband cannot have wheat. I used blue cheese instead of feta, and it worked out great! I ended up using a whole cup more of mozarella, so it was really naughty! Also used fresh baby spinach leaves-- I hate squeezing out frozen spinach!

I made this lasagna for my Husband, Parents and my Sister who is a vegetarian. They all loved it. I was surprised with how fresh tasting it was. Since it doesn't have ricotta cheese, like most lasagnas it was very light and didn't feel heavy at all. My Husband who is a meat LOVER really liked it and didn't mind that it didn't have any meat. Everyone had seconds :)  **I used this NO CHICKEN, chicken broth that I had instead of the vegetable broth.

Great lasagna!! I love that it doesn't have ricotta  cheese which tends to be too heavy for me. I added some zucchini and yellow squash, and threw some sun-dried tomatoes & parm on top with the feta, super yummy!! This was my first lasagna, it was easy, and I was very proud!

Excellent recipe. Only one change was made, we used Grandma's homemade spaghetti sauce instead of jarred version.  Delicious!

This is delicious! I make this when we have guests for dinner and everybody loves it, even our kids! I read some of the other reviews and also use less broth. I started making two, one with ground beef added. I brown a pound of it and when it's almost done, add a jar of the sauce and a bit of the broth.Then add the spinach mix to that and continue with the original instructions.

This is okay, but definitely not the best lasagna.  Even if you are looking for a meatless lasagna, I've had better luck just using a regular recipe and taking out the meat and adding vetables.

First time making lasagna and it was great!  I used the Rosemary seasoning instead of fresh and fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Only thing though is that it didn't make as much sauce as I had hoped, so ended up with less layers.  In all, great recipe and will be a fixture at my house.

This was my first time making lasagna, and this was an easy and great recipe! I added cooked chicken to half of it for my husband, but kept my half vegetarian. Next time I'd like to try adding more veggies, like mushrooms or eggplant. Delicious!

IF made as directed it's a GREAT Lasagna regardless of if you even like vegetables, because the ingredients blend in very well. As a veggie lover I added 1 lb. White Cap Mushrooms and 2 "medium" (very small seeds and no mushy pulp), and 2 Jars of Pasta Sauce (READ THE LABEL!). No HFCS! 
The way I look at it is IF I'm going through all this shopping and cooking I should make 2 in square 9 x 9 Corning Wear with glass lid. I give my 1st One to a family that needs it and share the 2nd with my elderly parents (78,79).
BEST RECIPE ON THIS WEBSITE!!!

Great Flavor - tangier than your ordinary lasagna.  I don't like lasagna that is watery after cooking - and this one really absorbed all the juices.  The feta on top is a nice touch.

Excellent, delicious recipe. I thought that there was a lot of liquid in the recipe so I decided to use uncooked regular noodles, it worked out very well as they absorbed all that water. I think I added about 10 minutes of extra oven time. A word of caution: check the sodium content of everything you put in this, some canned artichokes are very high in salt and if you use chicken boullion this can be too salty along with the sodium in the sauce.

Use this site a lot and have never commented on a dish.  This was amazing!!!I have had a taste for lasagna but wanted to keep it on the healthy side- perfect! I added some muchrooms, zucchini, and summer squash. I used the thinner oven ready noodles and only added 1/2 the can of broth- and wow.  I can't wait for leftovers!!!

This was really good. My husband was skeptical, but he said we should definitely make it again. I followed to recipe exactly except I used plain feta because it was a quarter of the price.

This was outstanding and I have saved it to cook regularly. Healthy and tasty. My husband loved it and 2 of my 3 kids and myself! I did not find the need for feta so I omitted. Also I did not pre cook the lasagna noodles - no need to. This beats all other lasagnas especially for some of us that don't eat meat lasagna. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a HUGE hit in my house!!! I had no Vegtable broth, couldnt even find in the store, so I used chicken broth.  Also used plain feta instead of the Garlic Herb Feta.  DEFINTIELY a keeper!!
