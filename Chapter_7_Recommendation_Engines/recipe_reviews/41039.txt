These are excellent !  I added 1 tsp. garlic powder to the filling and increased the cumin by about 1/2 tsp.  Better than any of the frozen brands we have purchased.  The only thing I would add, if you don't use the 3/4 cup of beer in the batter, have that on hand plus another six pack to wash these down.  YUM !  Thanks
