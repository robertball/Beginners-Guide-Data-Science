After a little tweaking to suit the family's taste, it was outstanding.. The dressing is the key!! I left out the ham for my vegetarian daughter and added chopped celery, green and yellow peppers and black olives. To the dressing, I just added more mayo, used balsamic vinegar instead red wine vinegar and added about a teaspoon of sugar. This will always be made for my family get togethers!! Pasta and veggies could be changed, but the dressing is what really makes it scrumptious!!

Really very good and my kids loved it. I used bow ties and colby jack cheese. I also had to sub red wine vinegar as I was out of cider. I will be making this again!

That was really yummy--I scaled this recipe for 25 people and it easily served as a sidedish at a picnic for over 40. The only changes I made were to add a little bit of sugar to the dressing, eliminate the ham (for the vegetarians), and add some yellow, red, and green bell peppers and whole balck olives. Everyone loved this salad; it was a nice change from the usual oil and vinegar pasta salad that we usually do, and it was not heavy like the supermarket mayo-based pasta salads. Great recipe! :)

This recipe's a keeper. I'm vegetarian so substituted smoked tofu for the ham, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. By the way, for those wondering just how much broccoli is in two cups: it's about one head. I would also recommend steaming the carrots until tender-crisp. Very tasty!

I'M DYING over here! This is soooo delicious! I had some veggies and cooked pasta that I didn't want to waste, so I found this recipe and made it (with a few changes because I was working out of my pantry), and I can't stop eating it! I think I could really just sit here and eat the whole bowl, and it makes a TON!

MMMMMmmmmmm Good! I halved the recipe, but used about 3 cups of pasta (I don't like really thick sauce). It is wonderful, especially the next day once everything is chilled and blended.

Very good salad!  I don't much care for a mustard-based dressing, so left that and the dill out.  I also added a dash of sugar to sweeten the dressing a bit.  All in all, this was a delicious pasta salad fit to be a meal by itself or as a wonderful addition to lunch, dinner or as a potluck dish.

It is so good to find a good basic salad dressing recipe that was not just ordinary mayo. I loved this. I chopped up some hard salami from the deli as I didn't have ham, but I think I prefer the stronger taste that blended really well with the mustard based dressing. Very very good!! I did blanch the veggies a bit - just because my family likes that.

Great! The dressing does make the salad. I made it for a party so I left the ham out and added a chopped red pepper instead. I can see how the ham would be good in it though. Will definitely make it again!

YUM! The dill in this sauce REALLY makes the salad - so different, so summery! I subbed a high-quality balsamic, and also added the tsp of sugar. I didn't have any carrots so I threw in some chopped fresh green pepper and chopped fresh white mushrooms. I made this for a large gettogether and after seeing it only filled up my serving bowl half-way, I would have doubled everything. I'd say this is a good portion for a dinner party or large family, but if you are wanting to bring it to a potluck or large event then I would make double. I will DEFINITELY be making this one again!!!!

The dressing is perfect just as it is although I do add a bit of the pasta water to thin it down some.  I've made the salad a number of times using different veggie combinations as well as different meats, always ending with a wonderful warm weather meal that appeals to everyone.

This was a good basic pasta salad recipe.  I made this for my child's school picnic so I omitted the ham and used a shredded Mexican cheese blend as I didn't have any cubed on hand.  You can pretty much add any veggies you want.  I also used edamame and corn instead of peas and broccoli.  The dressing has a nice tang to it.  Next time I might add a little sugar to it as well.

I left out the ham, and it still turned out great! My seester almost ate the entire bowl! She gave it 5 stars, but I didn't adore it as much as her, nor did my boyfriend. It was great, but just not Wow. I will make it again and again for my seeeester.

Delicious pasta salad recipe. Love the loads of veggies in it. We left the cheese out, because the dressing was creamy enough by itself. Also used deli shaved ham.

I made this pasta salad tonight and everyone loved it.  I left out the ham b/c we do not eat it and I didn't have any peas so I added green peppers.  I used low fat may and fresh dill from our garden.  I thought it tasted like the cool veggie pizza without the dough.  I will definately make this recipe again!

Everyone loved this salad. I did not steam brocoli, just cut it in smaller bitesize pieces.Used the washed and ready shredded carrots. Perfect blend dressing. Second time I made this I didn't measure.Turned out just as good
