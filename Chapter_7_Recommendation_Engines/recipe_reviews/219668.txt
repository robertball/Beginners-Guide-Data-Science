Not sure which I liked better.....the cheesy, saucy potatoes or the presentation of it!  I added more onions, green peppers and hot Italian sausage to make my main course.  Very good.

The video for this recipe is very helpful in seeing the color of the cooked potatoes and the thickness of the sliced mozzarella. I fried the potaoes in 2 batches because 3 lbs. of sliced potatoes crowded my large skillet. I also layered my potatoes, mozz and sauce according to the way iy was done in the video, which was different from the written directions. I used my own sauce because I already had some in my fridge. This recipe is basically a potato parmesan! I loved it! And I loved hearing the story behind the recipe! Thanks for sharing, Dogwood2 =)

Love!  I put too much salt in...my own fault.  12 year old didn't wait for the rest of dinner, just took a plate full and ran!

Excellent! Since it's a meatless dish I browned up some Italian sausages to serve on the side. We will be making this again and again.  We also use the leftovers for breakfast the next day and add a fried egg to it. Awesome!

Delish. I loved the story behind it too and if I were to make any change I would probably prefer to layer the potato's, cheeses and sauce in a casserole dish and finish it off in the oven.

It is delicious. The potatoes have a marvelous flavor and I like the tomato and cheese combined with them. It would be a good dish to bring to a potluck, although I might transfer it to a baking dish and put it into the oven to melt the cheese. You can't very well bring a skillet to a potluck.
