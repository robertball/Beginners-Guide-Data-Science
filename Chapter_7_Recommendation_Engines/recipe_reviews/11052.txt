I had to make these a couple of times to really get them right.  They really do melt in your mouth.  One little trick I do is to use butter flavored shortening.

I was so thrilled when I finally found this receipe.  It's very similar to the same cookie that I remember having on my first day of kindergarten.  The recipe does make quite a few cookies.  I would recommend scaling the recipe down. This a short bread cookie so it isn't very sweet.

these are deliciously airy not too sweet little treats. I rated them four stars because the dough is a bit challenging to work with. you absolutley MUST allow the dough to chill or you will have a heck of a time cutting it. And be sure to slice the dough no more than half an inch thick or they wont have that light airy texture you want.

This dough is best if you cover it and keep it in the fridge for a while. Roll it into balls, then cool them, then throw straight into the oven. If you try and bake immediately after mixing, the dough spreads way too much. Try adding some kind of peppermint flavor. I usually chop up whatever candy I have lying around. White chocolate peppermint bark is the best, but I've used andes mints or york peppermint patties. Its fun to flavor it with extract then dye half the dough red, and make swirly cookies.

Very good taste and husband also likes. Delicate flavor and texture. Dough was hard to work with: too much quantity for my stand mixer and even though I chilled it overnight it was hard to handle. Next time I will make 1/2 batch.

*I wanted to try this recipe as Christmas cookies for friends who have dairy allergies.  I did omit the nuts as well.* I read the other reviews before making so I made a couple of revisions.  First, I added about 1/2 c. brown sugar, packed.  Then I reduced the vanilla to 2 tsp. and added 2 tsp. almond extract.  I also reduced the salt to 2 tsp, could have left out more.  Since the batter was still sticky even after refrigerating, I just floured my hands and made balls then flattened with the floured bottom of a cup to about 3/8 inch.  (I didn't bake the whole batch so I rolled the rest of the dough into balls, refrigerated them on a cookie sheet and then stored in a sealed container.)  I then baked the cookies for 8 minutes and that was enough.  They turned out great!  They left a little indent in the middle which, when they cool, will be filled with icing, although they really don't need it!  Delicious!  UPDATE--For a trial run, I served these at my 4 yr-old's bday party.  They were a hit!  The 13 yr-old w/allergies LOVED them and begged to take some home.  She was thrilled to find a cookie she could eat that wasn't plain shortbread.

These are pretty good. I had no trouble mixing the dough, but I do not have a mixer and used my hands as if I were kneading pizza dough. Then I formed the dough into logs--like premade dough from the store--stuck in the fridge for 30 min and sliced. Do NOT cut thick slices! Tried that, threw them out. My one complaint is that they didn't seem "done" by the texture. Kinda odd, but they do taste good and are great for someone who is allergic to eggs and milk, like my son!

When I made this recipe there is something wrong with it as after I added flour and confectioners sugar then the shortening....it was crumbly as there was not enough moisture for consistency.  I added more shortening and some milk.  Myabe there is something missing in it.

It was very hard to keep the dough from crumbling. We only got a few sliced. The kids gave up right away.
