I made this dish to serve at a candle party I was having.  It was very good.  One of my guests asked if she could take a bowl of meat balls home!!  I would only suggest that you make sure you get your meat balls good and brown, even to the point of being crusty on the outside, because when they marinate and then cook they will get soft.  Some of mine began falling apart as I stired while cooking, I think because they were not browned long enough.  I also cut the amount of whiskey in half ~ I've never tried it with the full amount of whiskey, so I'm not saying that the full amount is bad.  The recipe suggests cooking for at least a half hour, but I suggest you cook them much longer than that.  At the 30 minute point we didn't like them at all, and my husband and I considered throwing them out, but after they cooked for a couple of hours they really became quite good.  I will certainly make this recipe again!!

I haven't served the finished product yet but I have comments about the recipe itself.  First, one small onion is too much.  1/2 of a very small onion would work better.  Second, double the marinade or it won't even cover the balls as you marinate them.  Third, medium heat is too high.  Cook on low or you'll burn them.  Finally, you might want to add some oil to the pan before you begin frying.  It will prevent the balls from falling apart when you need to turn them.

This appetizer is so yummy.  Make plenty because they disappear so quickly.  When serving them, if you put small pieces of French bread in a dish next to them, your guests will also enjoy dipping the bread in the delicious sauce.

I used frozen meatballs and these were great,  so easy!!  I cooked them in the crock pot on low for 7 hours, and they were perfect. I did use low sodium soy sauce, I think that really helped with the saltiness everyone else was commenting on.

The other reviewers were right.  There is too much onion, & the balls won't stick together.  Maybe adding an egg to the mixture would help it stick.  Cook lower than medium or they fall apart.  I added about a tsp of sugar to cut the salt, & served over unseasoned rice to compensate.

I hate to give a bad reveiw, but I followed this recipe exactly, and the meatballs did not turn out well.  They fell apart when marinating (I think it's because there was too much onion) and the taste was VERY salty.

OK but not what we were hoping.  Basically it's just meatballs.

The aroma and flavor of the meatballs is great, but it was way too salty for both myself and my wife. I think next time I will cut the soy sauce by 3/4, and substitute some Worcestershire sauce and a bit more water to make up the difference.

had an adult party, everyone loved them.  Made egg noodles and mushroom sauce with the left overs and they were fantastic.  I bought the premade meatballs and put them in the crockpot.

No flavour and it doesn't seem to bear any resemblence to the real thing.

This was pretty good. I had problems keeping all the onion in the meatballs, though. I also made them a little bigger and we had it as a main course, not appetizer. All in all it was okay. I might make it again if DH's not home - I forgot the only way he likes his meatballs is in sauce on top of spaghetti.

My husband and I both found this dish to be on the salty side. Since he loves salt, I couldn't believe he said it was too salty. We spent most of the meal trying to figure out how to cut the saltiness in half. Other than that, we had no complaints and would make it again.

I wanted to give this five stars, but WAY TOO SALTY. I kept wondering if it would be a problem, but I decided to follow the recipe. I wish I hadn't. Try to cut the saltiness with some brown sugar. I have run across some similar recipes that all use brown sugar. I will comment again after tweaking it.

I thought the plain meatballs were good.  I cooked them on med. heat and they held their shape pretty well.  
But the sauce stuff was too salty for me, and I even used lite soy sauce.  I think they would be good over plain rice or something like that.

Very good, they definately need to sit in the sauce for a while though.  I'm going to make them a day in advance this time and that should do the trick.

Not bad, a little too salty suggest using less soy sauce then recommended
