I originally made this sauce according to the recipe, but after finishing the sauce, decided it needed more tomato and less sardine flavor.  I ended up adding a can of fire roasted tomatoes and a can of tomato paste and it helped dilute the fishy flavor.  I'm glad that I didn't omit the sardines, because they do add something to the sauce, they just needed to be diluted a bit.

I think 1/3 cup bread crumbs is too much.  You only need enough to thicken the mixture to taste.

I added a smashed clove of garlic to the cooked onions.

Nice easy recipe -I'll definitely make this again.

The recipe does not indicate when to add the pepper flakes, so I added them with the tomato.

This was nice. This is very similar to "Pasta con le sarde", and it is one of my family's favourite dishes. We liked it but I think we would have loved it if there were some garlic saut√©ed with the onion. I also added some olive "condite" to give it a bit more. Thank you fozziesmom for your recipe.

Delicious!  I did add a clove of garlic, minced. My Great-Grandmother taught Me that one never, ever should rinse pasta, so I didn't. Mimi was never wrong in the kitchen.

This was simple but delicious.  I added minced garlic.  Some garlic bread rounded out this very satisfying meal.

Nice taste but way too dry. Next time I'll skip the breadcrumbs entirely and maybe add a bit of Italian seasoning to compensate. I used ramen noodles instead of spaghetti. Per other suggestions, I may add more tomato as well.
