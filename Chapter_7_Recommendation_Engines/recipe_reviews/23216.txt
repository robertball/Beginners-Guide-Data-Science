I found out that you have to be aware of what type of pork chop your using with this recipe!   As in thickness, otherwise you need to reduce the oven time. Otherwise it's agreat ,quick meal!

This was ok.  Kind of bland, but it gets 3 stars for being a quick meal.  I will try to tinker with this again to see if I can get some more flavor. Thanks for the post.

We like pork chops and we like Oxtail soup, however this was just okay. It needs more something I am just not sure what. I used homemade oxtail soup and seasoned the chops very well I thought and still it was bland. I am thinking maybe turning the soup to gravy once it has cooked, and more spicing for sure.
