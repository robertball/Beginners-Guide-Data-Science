This was as good as others said it was. The only  problem is that I found it to be a little more runny than I would have liked, even after simmering for a few hours. I remied this by adding 1/8 cup or so of flour. Next time I'll cut down on the water. Also, after I browned the ground beef and added the ingredients, I put it in the crock pot to simmer for several hours.

I didn't have any French onion soup, so I substituted a package of dry onion soup mix.  It was really good.  It tastes like Manwich only better because it's home-made!

This was very easy, and since it was a LOT of beef and I didn't want to halve it and waste the soups, I did as another reviewer suggested and froze the leftovers for a quick dinner later.  I absolutely loved this.  These smelled wonderful, and tasted like the sloppy joes I used to eat at the school cafeteria as a kid that I loved soooooo much.  My husband thought they were a little too sweet (I disagree) which is why this gets only 4 stars instead of 5s.  Kids are sure to love this as well.  I did also add about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.

This was super easy and mighty tasty. The only thing I will do differently next time is NOT use the Lipton onion soup mix that others recommended (instead of the canned) and follow the recipe EXACTLY. Not sure where the taste buds are of the instant soup fans or why I deviated when I had the canned variety in the pantry, but do yourself a favor and follow this AS WRITTEN for an "out of the park" easy meal.

This was a great recipe.  I omitted the extra water, and used an undrained 10oz can of diced tomatoes instead. Also, I didn't have canned onion soup, so I made up 1/2 a pack of onion soup mix, using half the correct amount of water, so it would be concentrated. Myself and the kids loved it, husband thought is was way too sweet, thus the 4 stars. I took a picture and submitted it, so that's what it looks like with the tomatoes.

This is GREAT!!  Only thing I did different was also added a dry packet of french onion soup mix (both cans of soup as instructed AND the packet).  and barely used any water so it thickened perfecty!  you can always add a little water as it simmers if it needs.     It gets even better the next day - flavors really soak in overnight.   GREAT MEAL!!!  it freezes well too

This was a great recipe!  I too, thought it was a little to runny so instead of simmering it for 30 minutes, I set the burner on high and was able to boil off the excess liquid in a few minutes.  It turned out to have a really good consistency.  Easy to prepare and very tasty. We will be doing this again.

Super easy and fast. The dominant flavor here was the french onion soup, but overall this was a good dish and it was sloppy joes without any chopping, measuring, and prep. I'd add a squirt of barbecue sauce to this the next time for added flavor and maybe make the onion not so dominant. We enjoyed this, thanks!

Like another reviewer I used the powdered onion soup mix instead of canned.  I also ommited the brown sugar, and put in a dash of hot sauce instead.   Turned out great, my husband liked it better than Manwich.

This was a huge hit with our family of 6. The kids loved and came back for more - with their friends that were staying the night too.
I made this in advance during a freezer cooking weekend. Froze great and tasted wonderful. It made the dinner with all of a sudden guests so easy!

This is an awesome recipe. I put it in the crock pot and the consistency was perfect. MY husband won't eat BBQ sauce so it's hard to find a good recipe without it. MY husband loved it!!! When he likes something it deserves a perfect score.

I used this recipe just for a little guidance. I'll give it the 5 star for that reason. I used 3 1/2 pounds of chuck roast  that I cooked in a pressure cooker with 2 cups of water and 3 teaspoons of beef bullion, chopped onion and bell pepper for almost an hour and a half. Shredded it and put it in a slow cooker with the liquid from the pot, a can of tomato soup, envelope of onion soup, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt,(spices added to taste) and a bit of bottled bbq sauce for just a little added flavor. This was served on homemade hoagie rolls from a recipe for hamburger and hot dog buns from this site. There wasn't much left after 7 adults got through with this dish! I think I'll try it again with hamburger next time, I would be a bit faster to do, but I didn't want the roast to spoil so I used that instead. Sorry for the long read!!

So yeah I had to take out just a little water, but that's not going to cause me to take a star off.  The recipe is very simple, and it tastes really great. I've made this three times already, and I think that the longer you let it simmer, the better it tastes. You could even replace the hamburger with ground chicken or ground turkey for a healthier meal.  I'm definately thinking of having this again sometime soon.

This is another one of those recipes I have been making for years. If you are looking for a good sloppy joe recipe thats sweet and doesn't have that tomato taste like manwich does, then this is for you! I make it as is, no need to change it at all! It makes quite a bit, so I freeze half of it and make 2 meals out of it.

This was delicious. I have been making bbq's the same way for many years but wanted to try something different. The family loved it. I did decrease the brown sugar to a wee bit more than 1/4 cup & thought it was still too sweet so I added my usual squirt of mustard to balance it out. I also decrease the water to only a 3tbsp or less. I also add a green pepper & onion to the browning hamburger. Will for sure be making again.

Served on a warm hamburger bun with a piece of melted American cheese.  Based on previous reviews, I only added about 1/2 the called for water and it turned out perfectly.  I liked it so much, I even ate spoonfuls without the bun. This will go in our permanent rotation!

This is REALLY tasty.  I made it in the slo-cooker.  Tip:  Reduce the liquid.  I wound up straining the liquid out --- served this at a shower --- went over BIG!  Thanks Nancy!

This was very good. It was a little sweet for me, I would do about 1/3 cup brown sugar but my husband liked the sweetness. I will not be using store bought again.

Entire family loved it.  I enjoyed the different taste the French onion soup added.  Since it was just the 3 of us I halved everything but the soups - and didn't add the extra water.  I thought it would be too runny but the extra simmered away.  Thanks for a dinner success.

We use this recipe (X6) for our annual Cub Scout Spring Campout. The boys, and parents wolf them down as fast as we dish them out. Thanks for the super recipe!

This is a really great recipe.  It is better the next day.  We ended up throwing some of it out because it was more than we could eat.  Now that I know that, I can freeze some of it for an easy meal another day!

I have been making this recipe for a few years.  Most people tend to like the slightly sweet taste even with the hard to notice onions (I know a lot of onion haters).  Simple, quick and easy.  This is great the way it is  but sometimes to my serving I add corn, hot sauce and a slice of cheese.

Perfect as written. I simmer longer to reduce.  This is a regular in our rotation. (Update: I make this frequently in the crockpot after the burger is browned. It makes enough to freeze for another meal later.)

I am a firefighter and I always say that if I can please these guys it has to be good.  This Bar-b-Q was very good.  The guys thought so also.  I did add a little corn starch to thicken it a little.  I went by the the ingredients but added garlic powder, pepper, diced up some onion.  Toasted the buns that it went on and added some american cheese to the buns.  Served with Sweet potatoe fries.   It was a HIT! And easy.

Far too sweet for my tastes, I ended up adding 1/4 C vinegar, garlic powder, and onion powder to get more tangyness... and then they were good!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The ingredients seemed a little weird, but well worth it. I did use a pkg of dried onion soup instead of the French onion soup as suggested and because that is what I had and reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 cup. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so simple.  I only made half the amount, and it turned out fine.  I let it simmer for about 45 minutes and it was pretty thick.  I also didn't add water since I only used half the can's of the soup.

This is real tasty, but I added about 1 t. mustard and worcestershire and made about half the recipe. Also left off most of the water. If anyone thinks it's too liquidy, simply simmer uncovered until excess liquid boils away.  I might use a little less brown sugar next time.  This is a matter of individual tastes.

I really liked this recipe - great tasting!!  But it is watery... use less water when making this recipe.  I used cornstarch to thicken it up and that helped.  It was thicker the next day and I was able to freeze some and have enjoyed it again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

5 out of 6 in my house ate it and wanted seconds. I served this over mashed potatoes versus in a bun. Was a nice all in one comfort food.  Out of MY preference I would cut back a bit on the brown sugar. Will be making it again

We thought these were okay but we discovered that we like our sloppy joes to have a bit more "zing".  I followed the recipe exactly but mine were very soupy--I ended up adding some oatmeal to soak up some of the liquid.

This is a great recipe.  Very unique taste where you can't find anywhere else.  My picky daughter asks me to make this a lot.  I would recommend using lean ground beef.  Everyone loved these and came back for more!  Thanks for sharing.

Quick and easy!  My picky 8 year old ate 3! Great for those hot days when you don't want to steam up the kitchen.

Wonderful!  My kids loved this; this is especially amazing considering my 3 year old hardly eats meat - and she loved it!!

I made this recipe for a church group of 20 teenagers....the ultimate compliment was when they all went back for seconds!  It was fast, easy and delicious.  I will be making it for my own family again!   Donna Young

This is a great recipe! My whole family loved it, even my finicky 6 year old daughter. I will be making this again.
