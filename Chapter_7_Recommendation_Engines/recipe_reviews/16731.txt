This was a big hit at my house!! I would serve this meal for family and friends. Here are some changes I made based upon other reviews I read and my own taste. 1) Instead of boiling chicken, I bought an herb-roasted chicken from the grocery store. I saut√©ed the onions and peppers alone and added about 2 tsp. of taco powder at the end.  After shredding the hot chicken, I added it to that pan. 2) I put some refried beans in each enchilada. 3) For a beautiful look, I sprinkled the top with sliced black olives. 4) I used about 2 cans of enchilada sauce. Very important! Spray the bottom of the pan and pour some sauce on it before adding the rolled enchiladas. 5) I used flour instead of corn tortillas.  I moistened each tortilla with the enchilada sauce before putting it together. (Pour some sauce in a deep bowl and wipe the tortilla on both sides.) This helped keep the enchilada moist and tasty. This is beautiful! Let stand about 5 minutes before serving.

The cottage cheese/sour cream mixture was so yummy.  I made the chicken in the crockpot-three frozen chicken breasts with a chopped onion, 1/2 a beer with a sprinkle of cumin, oregano, cinnamon, black pepper and a couple of cloves of garlic, gave it a stir and cooked it on low for five hours and then shredded it, sooo easy and tasty.  Thanks for the fab recipe!

These are absolutely amazing!  When I made them for my husband, he raved about them to everyone!  We recently started the BODY FOR LIFE program, so I just changed a few things to make this a protein-packed, low-fat meal - using fat free sour cream, low-fat cottage cheese, pam instead of oil, and low-fat mexican style mix shredded cheese.  I also layer everything like lasagna rather than rolling enchiladas to cut prep time in half!

I really enjoyed this. Very good recipe.
The enchiladas turned out moist
and quite flavorful. I had a few substitutions
due to time constraints: plain nonfat yogurt
for the sour cream, ground turkey for the
skinless chicken, added my own Mexican seasonings
such as oregano, chili powder, and cumin to cut down
on sodium. Cheddar cheese with some cotija cheese was added in with the cottage cheese mixture for enhanced flavor. Also, I thinly sliced some  black olives and green onions and added to the top of the enchiladas the last ten minutes of cooking. Served with beans and brown rice
with  fresh tomatillo salsa on the side. Thank you
for sharing this recipe. I will share it with my friends and 
have fun playing with it.   ** Spread about 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the casserole dish before preparing the enchiladas. Helps keep them
moist while baking. The important thing to remember is
to use a good amount of enchilada sauce to avoid the
enchiladas from drying out. That took me a long time
to figure out.   COOKGIRL

Was a little afraid to try this, but since everyone else said it was so great, I thought I would give it a try. GLAD I DID!!! Me and my husband LOVED it. Suggestion....Since its just the two of us, I divided the receipe in half and made up two smaller trays of it. I have some of those ovenware plastic baking trays, so I served one tray for dinner, and froze the other. Now I have a wonderful dinner in the freezer and can just throw it in the oven when I want a delicious dinner, but no time to cook!

My husband & I also made "Mrs. Espy's Enchilada Sauce", also on this site.  We served this to 4 of our friends and everyone LOVED the dish.  The only real change we made was to add a whole lot more enchilada sauce (it was just one big messy dish, but mmmmmm was it good!!).  Our friends were surprised to learn they were eating cottage cheese.  It is important to shred the chicken (not just cut it up) if you've never made enchiladas before.  We cannot wait to make this again; a definite family keeper!

This was simple and delicious too!  I didn't want the hassle of rolling the tortillas, so I just quartered the tortillas and put half on the bottom, then half after the chicken layer.  They were fabulous and I'll definitely make them again!

Amazing! I changed a little here it goes. The night before, I boiled chicken in low sodium chk broth, while cooking I chopped onions, garlic and jalapeno and saved all together in a plastic bag with the chicken. The next day I came home at lunch to assemble them. I heated olive oil in skillet while I shredded the chicken then put it in the skillet with chopped veggies and added chili powder, cumin, a couple dashes of cayenne pepper and a dash of seasoning salt. I used fat free cottage cheese and light sour cream. I heated 6 flour tortillas in microwave, then assembled and topped with green enchilada sauce a bit of shredded cheese and black olive slices. Put them in the fridge and the boyfriend popped them in the oven for 30 minutes when he got home. When I got home from an evening meeting, I had a wonderful hot meal. These were to die for! So gooey but less fat. I will make these again for sure! Will use more jalapeno next time and omit the shredded cheese on top as it wasn't necessary.

Mmmm! These were delicious. I added some of the broth that I cooked the chicken in with the taco seasoning. I also added chopped cilantro to the cottage cheese mixture & omitted the salt & pepper. Finally, I sprinkled chopped black olives on top. Thanks for a great recipe!

LOVE!  Only thing I changed, omitted the peppers, used fresh cilantro over the top.  This is wonderful, easy and tastes like it came from a restaurant.  Fantastic recipe!

These are delicious! I used green chili sauce instead of red and cheddar instead of Monterey Jack since that's what I had on hand, yummy! I managed to get more than 12 out of this recipe, more like 18 if I rolled them tight enough in the pan. The cottage cheese really does make this dish, I absolutely loved the flavor and I will be making these again very soon!

Very good, but watch the salt level. I have made these a lot, but now I adjust the salt level by only adding 1/2 tsp salt to the cottage cheese mixture and by substituting the enchilada sauce with part medium salsa simmered with one 14.5 ounce can of unsalted, petite diced tomatoes.  We like it with the extra sauce and by adding the unsalted tomatoes, we control the salt level.  I also have reduced the taco seasoning mix by buying a bulk size jar and just adding 2 tsp. instead of a big packet. Sometimes I roll the enchiladas, but it is quicker to just layer this like lasagna: cut 9 corn tortillas in quarters and layer 12 tortilla quarters on top of a little sauce in the bottom of the oiled pan, chicken, cheese mixture, sauce, shredded cheese; repeat layers again; then top with 12 tortilla quarters and a little sauce, cheese, and fresh cilantro for garnish. I also use reduced fat sour cream and cottage cheese. Be sure to bake these uncovered so they don't get soggy.

Absolutely the best enchiladas I've ever had! I was curious about the cottage cheese but you couldn't even tell it was in there. I made some adjustments so that the recipie is quicker to make. Simply cook the meat mixture as stated; after that's done combine the rest of the ingredients with the meat mixture (reserve the enchilada sauce and 1 cup of cheese for topping). Then distribute the mixture into the tortillas. Top with enchilada sauce and cheese. It's that easy! I've also added a can of refried beans or mexican rice to the meat mixture to make it go further. Delicious!

We all enjoyed this recipe. The cottage cheese adds a nice flavor to this. Please dont use taco seasoning packets to get a mexican flavor. Just saute a small onion, 2 cloves garlic and your protein (grnd beef, chkn, etc). Add 2 Tbl of Cumin, Oregano, 1 small can of tomato sauce and little water.  Simmer just like it was a packet of seasoning. You will dig it.

I cut this recipe in half, trying to use up some leftover ricotta cheese.  I ended up with about 8 enchiladas, using a 6" corn tortilla.  I could have used 2 cans of enchilada sauce. Even with the ricotta substituted for the cottage cheese, this was just alright.  The enchiladas were very soggy, so maybe it would have been better had I let the enchiladas bake 10-15 min before adding the sauce.

What can I say, these were excellent!!  I'm usually a skeptic when it comes to chicken enchiladas in red sauce, not to mention the addition of the cottage cheese was a bit unusual...but I tried the recipe exactlly AS-IS with no changes and IT WAS DEFINATELY ONE OF THE BEST ENCHILADAS i'VE HAD!!!  Thank you so much for the recipe, you have a house FULL of fans in this keeper!!!

This was a great enchilada recipe.  I did change it up a bit and used a sour cream sauce instead of using a red sauce. To make the sour cream sauce I used 1 can of healthy request cream of chicken soup (no MSG that way), sour cream to taste, salsa verde and about 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  To save time I also layered the tortillas instead of rolling them (tortillas, chicken mixture, cheese mixture, cream sauce, a little shredded cheese.  I then layered more tortillas for the top, cream sauce and then shredded cheese)  This has become one of my favorite enchilada recipes.

Awesome enchiladas! I've tried many enchilada recipes and this is the best one yet. I'll definitely be making this many more times! The cottage cheese created a creamy filling while the chile peppers gave the dish an authentic spicy appeal. I made some changes: I used shredded canned chicken, reduced cottage cheese to one cup, reduced taco seasoning to a third of the packet, omitted extra salt/pepper, and added some onion and garlic seasoning. Delicious!

It is great and flavorful dish, however, a bit salty to my taste. So next time I will add more cottage cheese and I will not put salt in the cheese mixture.

This is delicious!  Instead of the packaged taco mix, I seasoned the chicken breasts with 2 t. chili powder, 1 t. paprika, 1 crushed beef boullion cube, 1/4 t. sugar, 1/4 t. cayenne pepper, 1/4 t. garlic powder, and several turns of the pepper mill.  I then added 3/4 cup of water and 1 T. of flour to thicken the mixture.  These spices don't give the traditional (bland) taste, but give it a nice soft kick.  Thanks, Crystal, my family loved the enchiladas.

My family enjoyed this recipe very much! I followed the previous suggestions: 1)Buying a roasted chicken & using that meat (2 chicken breasts not enough meat in my house!)2)Blended the cottage cheese and sour cream but added a little bit of canned chiles (about 1 tbsp) to give it a little flavor. You can also use the "cotija" cheese instead of cottage to add more authentic flavor (I did and it was great too) 3)I do agree with another reviewer that it needs a lot more sauce, so I used 2 (10z) cans. 4) Brush the tortillas with the sauce and then put the filling in..and brush the sauce OVER every spot and THEN pour the rest of the sauce over it!Delicious!!

Cottage cheese made me a little nervous, but couldn't even tell in the final product.  Had a lot more flavor than an ordinary enchilada.  I used flour tortillas and quite a bit more sauce.

Wish I could give this recipe ten stars! I used low fat cottage cheese and it still made the enchiladas taste incredibly rich! I typically don't even like cottage cheese, but it is perfect in this recipe. I used three chicken breasts and this recipe ended up making eleven generously filled enchiladas. I changed nothing else other than adding garlic powder to the cheese mixture, using flour tortillas instead of corn and using one 20 ounce can of enchilada sauce since that seemed to be a pretty popular change in most of the reviews (add some to the bottom of the pan after spraying with non-stick cooking spray before placing the enchiladas in the pan to keep them from drying out) Note: Make sure to shred your own cheese instead of buying the pre-packaged shredded kind. It makes a huge difference in flavor and is worth the extra effort :o) I was told by two guests that these enchiladas were better than any restaurant! Try them, you won't be disappointed!!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because I really love the use of cottage cheese as enchilada filling, but I honestly only used this recipe as a guide. I followed other reviewer's suggestions: I used more enchilada sauce (2 cups), spread the sauce in the bottom of the pan, and layered like lasagna. I didn't use a seasoning packet, but my own blend of chili powder, oregano and cumin. I also added fresh cilantro to the cottage cheese mixture (Wow! The cilantro was very prominent in the flavors, a must) And, since I was layering, I mixed the cheese into the cottage cheese mixture. I dipped my tortillas in sauce before layering them. Since it looked like it might be a little dry when I was done, I covered it with foil for the first 20 minutes, then when I took off the cover, I added the cheese and green onions. Yummy!

I have made this 3 times, it turned out great 2 of those times & meh once.  This is the kind of recipe that you can vary to your tastes.  I chopped leftover chicken, added it to a saute of red pepper & onion, the cottage cheese, cumin, garlic, sri-racha sauce.  Rolled in flour tortillas, & topped w/ the 10 Minute Enchilada Sauce found on this site (which is awesome~), and shredded colby.  Bake a good long time to melt the cottage cheese properly & a good dose of red sauce soften the tortillas really nicely.

Very good flavor, but very messy to serve.  I think next time I make it, I'll make it more as a mexican lasagna type dish by layering.  I'd also use more meat.  I didn't think the recipe called for enough.

This was FABULOUS!  I made this for my brother and sister-in-law for our monthly game night and dinner...RAVE REVIEWS!  I did cut down on the fat by using non-fat cottage cheese and non-fat sour cream.  You couldn't even tell the difference.  I also used a lower sodium taco seasoning mix and made my own enchilada sauce.  This has become a favorite with my hubby and my kids...tastes even better warmed up the next day!

My husband and I love this dish! I have even given it out! We liked it with the HOT taco seasoning mix. We also used the entire tubs of cottage cheese and sour cream closest to the recipes increments, which came out a little more than what the recipe called for. We also used flour tortillas instead of corn, since we couldn't find the corn tortillas, and its still great! An extra can of green chiles works too, but not a necessity since this dinner delite is great by the recipes original direction!

I made this for an impromptu get-together with some friends.  Everyone enjoyed it immensely and thought it was better than restaurant enchiladas.  The only change I made was to use chicken tenders instead of breasts, because that‚Äôs all I had.  I also topped the enchiladas with black olives and chopped green onions for a nicer presentation.  I‚Äôll definitely make this again!

My family enjoyed this. My dad gave these a 6. They are very flavorful and have a slight spice (if you are sensitive to spicy food). I followed the recipe exactly but did not put any meat mixture on top. I also prepared these before hand and baked later in the day, I didn't have to adjust the baking time at all, they came out great.  Like others said they are messy, I suggest letting them sit 5 or more minutes before serving.

I've done this recipe dozens of times with multiple variations.  It's the best basic enchilada recipe I've ever found to modify to everyone's taste.  I don't quite understand the negative reviews that say it wasn't good at all, or that it was only good when people added their own variations.  Every home made recipe should be tailor made for your taste.  Substitute anything with whatever you like.  That's what cooking is all about.  If it was completely uniformly perfect for everyone, it would come as a pre-made product that you'd buy in a store and would be sold out because everyone ate it ALL THE TIME.  It would be as popular as water.  I've never gone wrong with any variation of this recipe, and the creamy cottage cheese and sour cream balances well with the spiciness of this dish, but you have to balance this with what you like.  I use rotisserie chicken from costco, and make two big casseroles or more.  One with dark meat, and one with white, and I change what I want with what I have or what I have a taste for.  Enchiladas are generally totally customized.  If you don't like half the ingredients, you probably won't like the recipe.  Cooking from scratch is common sense folks!  I occasionally follow a recipe verbatim, but I always modify it every time after.  Don't knock it till you try it, then try it the way you know you will like it.  If you still don't like it, stop eating food.  And please post your non-food recipes here so we can all stop eating food.

My stores doesn't sell enchilada sauce, so I made my own.  I suggest you put a layer of sauce on the bottom of your pan before starting to add your enchiladas to prevent them from sticking to the pan.  I also recommend spreading some refried beans on each tortilla.  Delicious!

A super recipe that is a crowd pleaser! I use leftover roasted chicken chopped really fine and even though it isn't an "authentic" recipe what with using cottage cheese, it makes for a divine dinner! Leftovers freeze well and make a great dinner on those nights you don't have lots of time to cook too!

I was really excited about this - we love enchiladas and we love cottage cheese.  I cooked three chicken breasts in my crockpot with about 1 -1 1/2 c. chicken stock, 1 pkg taco seasoning and 1 can Ro-tel chiles and tomatoes.  It smelled heavenly while cooking.  I followed the the next steps of the recipe exactly - other than I made my own enchilada sauce from the crockpot liquids.  I also dipped each tortilla in the sauce before making it into the enchilada.  For the first time EVER, my family did not rave about my enchiladas!  My son did not even finish his plate and he eats everything.  These came out so dry - even though I made extra sauce and poured it over my already sauce moistened corn tortillas.  My cottage cheese mixture seemed to dry into little curds that we didn't care for at all.  With all the work involved in this dish - I seriously doubt I'll be making it again.  My regular chicken enchilada recipe has people scraping the pan clean, and I think I'll stick with that.

This is excellent!  I used hot enchilada sauce and about 1/4 onion.  Also, I split this recipe into 2 8x8 pans, one of which I placed in the freezer.  This was delicious both fresh and frozen.  If frozen, thaw out in refrigerator, then bake at 350 for 35 minutes.  Excellent!  I served this with Spanish Rice II on this site which is also delicious.

Here is the most important thing about this recipe that I think everyone should understand....it contains cottage cheese.  Baking cottage cheese in an enchilada will not change it's curdled texture, therefore anyone that does not like the texture of cottage cheese will most likely not find these very appealing.  Overall, the taste of these enchiladas were good and what I expected, but I found that the addition of the cottage cheese really did not do much to 'add' to the tried and true regular chicken enchilada recipe, and it was not the coveted mystery ingredient I have been searching for.

I have been making this exact recipe for over 30 yrs and it still great! The only thing I add differently now is , the sauce.  I use to use the red sauce...but using the green Ortega enchilada sauce instead of their red is SO gREAT!   and I use Olives too.Try it.

These were wonderful. I think maybe next time I will try with flour tortillas though because when serving, it was more like enchilada casserole. It's a lot of work for them not to come out as enchiladas. But they were still fantastic. I made a pan of chicken and a pan of beef left over from the night before's french dip sandwiches. So good. Wrapped individual servings in saran wrap and put in freezer for quick meals. I also used homemade red sauce from this site, so good and much better than store bought and still pretty easy. I also used fat free sour cream and 1% milk cottage cheese. I also used four chicken breasts, no way would two have been enough. Three probably would have done it but it was nice to have more meat for the top of the enchiladas. Thanks for the great recipe! My boyfriend decided these will be a regular at our house. Now if I can only find some terrific original side to go along...

I have made many 5 star recipes that I thought were very undeserving, however this one was excellent! I did make my own enchilada sauce, but the rest of the recipe stayed the same. It was absolutely terrific! Everyone in my family enjoyed it and we can't wait to have it again. It was very good reheated the next day as well! Thank you for a new edition to my recipe file!

This recipe was awesome.  My husband absolutely loved it and has asked me to make it over and over again.  He loves taking it to work the next day.  I would have never tried the cottage cheese, but I am so glad that I did.  Just as hint to others...please remember to grease your pan if you want them to come out nice and pretty and not just one lumpy mess.  Either way, they taste the same.  Awesome!!  *****

This was great!  My whole family loved it!!!  I also mixed the chicken mixture and the cheese mixture together to save time.  Instead of putting all of the leftover cheese and chicken mixture on top of the enchiladas, I saved it to make nachos a few nights later!  They were awesome!  This recipe is a keeper!

I used flour tortillas and more enchilada sauce.  I left out the peppers (didn't have any) and used low fat Monterey Jack cheese.  I also blended the cottage cheese first because I don't like the curds.  This was very good! My boyfriend loved these.  It was a lot better as leftovers, and the cottage cheese taste was masked with more enchilada sauce when serving.

Yeah!! Another 5 star dish for the file! I LOVED this, family thought it Rocked too! I started by chopping up some Hatch chilies and adding it to the cottage cheese mixture, put 1 tbls of dried onion and just a few chili flakes along with a few sprinkles of chicken bouillon. I roasted the chicken thighs and seasoned them with the taco seasoning, shredding them after they fell off the bones. I like my red sauce a bit thicker so I cooked it down along with a couple bay leaves tossed in to add even more flavor. Toasted the corn tortillas on the stove and let em go swimming in the sauce then rolled them up. DD thought Mom had lost her marbles when I told her there was cottage cheese in the enchiladas, she Quickly changed her tune, she and her BFF devored them! I topped them with shredded pepper jack cheese. I plan on giving these to hubby for breakfast and topping them with fried eggs. (Fried eggs on enchiladas is a Great way to eat them since it gives another nice sauce to the dish). FANTASTIC! Thank you Annabell, I will keep this one close by!

Yummy! I really liked these! We used chicken thighs because the mister accidentally bought those instead of breasts. But it didn't make too much of a difference.
I didn't add much of the green chiles as I am a huge wimp when it comes to anything spicy :(
I used a 15oz can of enchilada sauce but will use a 20oz next time I make it. I put a little bit of sauce on the bottom but will put more the next time. Even after greasing the pan the enchiladas stuck a bit. I also covered every inch of the tortillas (we used flour tortillas) with the enchilada sauce because I didn't want them to be hard after baking.
I think I will also add some cilantro next time.

Outstanding.  Made this for a group of firemen and was told that it was the best they ever had!  I made a couple of changes/additions.  Added some red pepper to the onion, one chipolte pepper and used flour tortillas.  Definitely a recipe you can play with!!!!

I really enjoyed this dish!  I made it tonight for our weekly dinner club & it was a hit!  I doubled the enchilada sauce, putting a can in the bottom of the pan before adding the rest, & doubled the cheese.  I also used an entire rotisserie chicken (I shredded it) & just added it to the onion & chilies after cooking them.  Altogether good & much faster than I thought it would be to prepare!  Thanks!

This recipe was so easy to throw together.  As I was making I thought there has got to be more to this, it's too easy!!   The 3 kids I fed from ages 2-5 years old LOVED it and had seconds!!  Plus, my hubby gobbled it up too!! Instead of boiling the chicken, I cut into bite size pieces and cooked in oil on the stovetop.  This is a definite KEEPER!!!

My husband raved and raved over these.  They were exceptional.  The only changes I made were to dip the tortillas in the enchilada sauce before filling them to ensure they wouldn't dry out during cooking.  I also added some minced garlic to the cottage cheese mixture.  Next time I wouldn't add salt to the cottage cheese.  There is plenty of sodium elsewhere in the dish and it all blends together when you dish it up anyway.

EXCELLENT. I made the Red Enchilada Sauce from this site, adding cilantro and for the filling, I used Bill Echols taco seasoning. I didn't do the seperate steps, I just mixed the meat in with the cheese mixture. (I'm a mother with two very busy kids, I don't have time for several steps.)  I only had flour tortillas so I used that. With that said, the only problem I had with this dish was that the tortillas were soggy. My bad. I will try this again with corn tortillas and then I think it will be perfect. This did make twelve enchiladas using the half cup measuring cup to measure out the filling. This is my new enchilada recipe. My husband even liked this and before, he HATED when I made enchiladas. He couldn't even tell it was made with cottage cheese, which he HATES! I put one over on him! *giggle* Thank you!

This was very good. After frying the tortillas I dip them in the enchilada sauce   then followed the recipe but i did sautee the onions and chilles before adding ground beef and taco seasoning. Next time I will use less salt because I did have to add more cottage cheese to the mix because it was way too salty (maybe I shouldn't of tasted it) :)  I use about 20 oz of enchilada sauce since i dip the tortillas and also top with the rest. This is good as a chicken or beef dish.

We couldn't find corn tortillas the night we were ready to try these, so substituted whole wheat tortillas.  Same with the enchilada sauce, so used salsa.  I know it wasn't as the recipe called for, but it turned out amazing!!  I can't imagine what it would have been like if we had the two key ingredients.  I look forward to finding out.  Highly recommended.

This was a good recipe. My husband gave it a 5 and my picky 4 year old ate more than she usually does, but I felt it was lacking something maybe more of the cheese mixture? I don't know but I'll try some differen't things. Will make this again. Thanks

This was awesome.  My husband and I thought they were really good!  At first I thought the cottage cheese sounded sort of weird, but it turned out to be a great addition to enchiladas! Yummy!  It made a lot too.  It made enough to fill both a 9x13 and 8x8 pan.  I froze the 8x8 pan.  I also used 2 10oz cans of enchilada sauce and poured some sauce in the bottom of the pan before laying the enchiladas in the pan.

Followed recipe, a little too salty for me. Next time would use half the taco mix and no salt in the cheese mixture. Not sure how the chicken is supposed to brown with the green chili sauce, too moist to brown, does not seem nescessary to brown it.And the instructions for mixing the taco mix was confusing. They tasted better the next day warmed over.

These were pretty good.  My husband and his friend were fairly impressed, I thought they were good but not fantastic.  A couple of changes, instead of chopped green chiles I used canned japapenos, and instead of enchilada sauce I used salsa.  Lowfat sour cream, cottage cheese, and cheese- to make it a bit healthier.  Chicken mixture was great.

three words: DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS!  These were great.  I made them when we had family over.  None of us like cottage cheese... but you can't taste it.  My husband can't stand sour cream but he loved them also! The flavor is great!  And it was easy to make.  The only thing I did different was add cumin and chili powder to the seasoning.  Also, I didn't realize the recipe said to have the chicken already boiled and shredded until I was about to start making dinner.  So I just sauteed the chicken in the oil until it was cooked through.  Then I shredded it and put it back in the pan to cook in the seasoning.  I will 100% definitely make this one again and again and again!  It would be good for potluck main dishes!  Such a nice change from the same old dinners every week!

I know it's cliche' to say I was worried about the cottae cheese in this recipe, but boy was I wrong! My husband unlike myself grew up around authentic mexican food and he said these are the best he's ever had. I know the corn tortillas are difficult to work with, but for the taste you gotta try it. Thank you Crystal, this is my new one and only Enchilada recipe. Oh, make your red sauce from scratch, there are plenty on this site to try!

Absolutly the best Chicken Enchiladas I have ever tasted!!!
I have made this recipe 3 times now and felt I had to leave a review because I am soo pleased to have added this to our menu at home!! The first time I made this I prepared it all at once and it did take a lot of time. The second and third times I made it, I followed the tip of slow cooking the chicken in a crock pot with in Chicken Broth, I start it in the morning before I leave for work usually the chicken breast are frozen, I cover them with the chicken broth and set it on low, by the time I get home that night they are fully cooked and the rest of the steps are a breeze and I can have them on the table by 6:00 to everyone's delight!!
Even our hard to please picky daughter raves about these!!
Thank You So Much Crystal!!!

This was simply spectacular, and oh-so-easy to make.  Instead of separating the meat and cheese mixtures, I just tossed the whole thing together.  And using another recommendation, the leftover enchilada stuffing I used for nachos.  Yummy!  Be generous with the enchilada sauce.

Made this a couple times and it's so delicious, my husband and I can't stop eating these tortillas (make extra, leftovers even better).  I doubled the chicken and used 10" flour tortillas but I never have enough chicken mixture left to spoon on top but that's OK, just got more chicken inside the tortillas.  It's a bit of work but so worth it.  Last time I made it, I did not have enough sour cream, but tasted great w/just cottage cheese.  Thank you Crystal for sharing.

Like many others was sooo skeptical about trying this recipe but so glad I did! The seasoned chicken and cottage cheese combo made a delicious filling for enchiladas. I made this with flour tortillas, making sure to put a thin layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom of the 9x13 pan and dipped the tortillas in enchilada sauce before filling and rolling them up. Would definitely make again!

This was great!!  We made a few changes.  Instead of boiling the chicken, we pan fried it with onion and seasoning, using a tiny amount of oil.  We also used yogurt as some other reviewers instead of sourcream.  We made our own enchilada sauce using a recipe we found on here (made a bit of a mess of it actually, but that wasn't THIS recipes fault!!!). Overall, quick to make, tasty and different.  We had it with mixed green salad from our polygon tunnel.  Yum!

I have never made rolled enchiladas before (I usually make mine "stacked" - less labor intensive). So I tried these tonight & as I have a bariatric surgery patient in the house, I blended all the filling ingredients together (meat and cheese mixture) into a sort of paste.  They came out great & went down real easy.  Oh yeah & added a clove of fresh garlic to the filling mixture, too (yum).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Big hit!  I used three chicken breasts instead of two.  I also used the packaged enchilada sauce instead of jars.  I didn't use monterey jack cheese because I didn't have any.  I used cheddar and mozzarella instead.  So good!

Very good enchiladas.  Used two cans of enchilada sauce, flour tortillas instead of corn and a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  Next time will make a few changes: will use corn tortillas (flour ended up a bit soggy by day 2); will cut down on amount of taco seasoning in the chicken, will place cottage cheese / sour cream mixture in food processor (didn't give a very nice appearance); and will use spicy enchilada sauce (just a preference).  May also try making these with the verde enchilada sauce.  Very versatile recipe and very good!

Pretty good, just kind of a lot of work--but not terrible.  I had some cottage cheese to use up, so this was a great way to use it.  I used 1 lb of frozen veggie crumbles instead of the chicken, and it worked great.  I also added some sliced black olives, too.  Used extra enchilada sauce, but that's just our personal preference.  

I also used half corn/half flour tortillas since they are easier to work with, and that was nice, as well.

This is a great recipe! It does sound weird but it is really good. We don't eat much meat so we used 1 large can of black beans (drained) instead of chicken and it tasted wonderful! I cut the cottage cheese and shredded cheese in half (1 cup each vs. two cups each) and I felt it was a good cheese mixture to bean mixture ratio. I also used fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream but still used 1/2 cup (Since I used the canned beans I didn‚Äôt add the salt FYI)

Tasty! Made my own enchilada sauce from Campbell's tomato soup + spices + splenda + broth (def. more than 10 oz). People who don't regularly like cottage cheese ate these up! Used low fat cottage cheese and low fat sour cream. Sauteed bell peppers and onions with shredded rotisserie chicken breast. Otherwise followed recipe.

I have been looking for a chicken enchilada recipe that was better than the betty crocker one that I used to use. This is it! I made a few changes and found them to be amazing! Even my little boy who hates spicy loved these!! When I put the chicken in the Crock to cook, i added a good amount of Foster's beer as well as sliced jalapenos, the chopped onion, cumin, 3 cloves of garlic whole and about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. i cooked this about 2 1/2 hrs on high, drained it and shredded the chicken. When it came to filling the tortillas,( i used white corn tortillas) i mixed the shredded chicken, cheeses, sour cream, chopped chilies and taco season together in a large bowl. I filled the tortillas and put them into a greased baking dish that had either enchilada sauce or salsa (i did each bc the salsa was less spicy for the kids) i added a bit of extra cheese on top of the filling instead of so much IN the filling. bake as usual. they came out so amazing! I preferred the salsa lined pan as opposed to the sauce lined pan. the salsa had a sweeter more familiar flavor that i go back to often. OH! i also covered mine with foil to ensure that they would stay moist while cooking and next time i will probably use flour tortillas as they are softer and easier to roll.

This was awesome ! Followed the recipe, kind of...used homemade taco seasoning and homemade enchilada sauce. Made the meat mixture and cheese mixture,per directions. Instead of rolling them, I cut the tortillas up, mixed everything together and and put in a 9 x 13 greased baking dish. Baked at 350 for 35 mins. Worked great ! Thanks for sharing this recipe !!!

The individual parts were delicious. I could gobble up the sour cream/cottage cheese mixture, and I used Ms. Espy's enchilada sauce from this site.  The chicken mixture was also good and assembly was simple.  Somehow it just didn't work when it all came together.  The taste just wasn't there for us.

I LOVE this recipe! I did put my own change with the corn tortillas: I lightly sprayed both sides of the corn tortilla with olive oil and placed them on a cookie sheet to heat for 4-6 minutes in the oven, until they became soft. They were very pliable and easy to roll. This also added a really nice texture to the corn tortillas, very-very tasty! EXCELLENT RECIPE!

Two words. Awe...some! The cottage cheese is total knock out over other cheeses I have tried with other recipes. Excellent flavor and texture. We make it all the time. You will love it. Try using a rotisserie chicken for the meat. Its easy and has a great flavor.

Very yummy! I've never made enchiladas with cottage cheese but my husband and I really enjoyed it. He couldn't find any green chile peppers so I used red peppers instead.

This was fantastic!! I did it as a layered casserole instead of enchiladas to save time.  Enchilada sauce covering the bottom of the 9x13 (don't forget to spray the pan).  Six corn tortillas over the sauce. Layer of the cottage cheese mix, layer of the meat/veggie mix  and repeat.  Then cover with the cheese and bake.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to use more enchilada sauce.

I thought the cottage cheese was a little strange.  Little white chunks floating around.  Mind came out rather mushy and it was more like a casserole.  Overall, it tasted pretty good.

Absolutely delicious!  Used low fat mexican shredded cheese, low fat cottage cheese and low fat sour cream.  Omitted onion and chile peppers.  Wonderful!  My hubby and daughter never even guessed there was cottage cheese in there until they were done and I told them!  Will be a regular meal!

READ TO THIS PLEASE!!! I loved this recipe, flavor-wise! The cottage cheese mixture added a nice creamy texture to the enchiladas. However, if you plan on making these, some changes need to be made because as the recipe stands, they will definitely be too mushy, too soggy, too wet. I am not sure why this happened but i plan on making these again, making minor alterations until I figure out what exactly went wrong and when I do, I will definitely post it here so that you can benefit from my experience. I believe the problem may be to much cheese, both cottage and jack as well as too much sauce. Another error in the recipe is the cooking time. I cooked for 30 minutes without checking early and it had already started burning.  I did make a few changes which should have helped prevent the soggy factor, such as frying corn tortillas in oil first, but it didn't help. Also I added more seasoning and spices because as-is this is quite bland for an enchilada dish. To sum up, I am not gonna give up on this recipe because I think it has great potential!! I just need to figure out the ratios of ingredients as well as figure out which additional seasonings/spices would compliment this dish best. I look forward to coming back to rate this again with what I have found to work best in this recipe. Until then, thanks and happy cooking!!! :)

Followed the recipe exactly except I used the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe submitted by Sal, instead of canned sauce.  I made the meat mixture and the sauce a day ahead and threw it all together next day. I served it with Mexican Rice II.  It tasted like a supreme Mexican restaurant meal.  Be sure and heat each tortilla 10-15 seconds on each side in ungreased skillet then fill and roll.

"Authentic" or not, these were delicious!  I was a bit hesistant to try (cottage cheese in enchiladas???) but am so glad I did.  Everyone, including my 2 year old, enjoyed this.  I highly, highly recommend another reviewer's suggestion to cook the chicken in the crockpot.  I'll post again because I swear these might not have been as delicious without this recommendation:  put frozen chicken breasts in crockpot, add diced onion, 1/2 a beer, sprinkle of cumin, oregano, black pepper, garlic cloves and cook on low 5 hours.  The chicken was so moist and flavorful.

SO GOOD, MY TEN YEAR OLD EVEN LOVED THEM! (AND SHE DOESN'T LIKE ENCHILADAS). Made exactly as the recipe states, they tasted very "authentic" versus the canned soup versions I have made in the past.  I froze half and cooked half.  The frozen ones were just as good, if not better, three weeks later.  Oh yes, be sure to use the 19 oz enchilada sauce, and pour it on!

This was very tasty, but oh so messy.  I did dip the corn tortillas in extra enchilada sauce as I put them together to make sure they didn't get too crispy during baking.  I made this for friends and they enjoyed it as well.

Great! The most authentic tasting chicken enchiladas outside of a Mexican Restaurant. I reduced the amount of cottage cheese to 1 1/2 cups and would double the amount of Red Enchilada sauce. I also mixed the chicken mixture and the cottage cheese mixture together before putting in the tortillas, that way they blend together better and you get a little of everything in every bite. Great recipe!

This recipe helped me re-invent some left-overs!  I used left-over pot roast in place of the chicken...it was fabulous.  I can't wait to try this as-written, with chicken.  I was also short on time so I layered the items like a lasagna...and it worked out fine.

WOW! I don't care much about Mexican food, but my fiance loves it. So I figured, "ok, let's do an average recipe, and get - as usual - mixed results" (him liking it and me thinking it was just ok). SO WRONG! This recipe is FANTASTIC! Flavourful, delicious, wonderfully balanced. The cottage cheese is a great idea, with the sour cream and salt tasted a lot like feta cheese, but with less fat and calories! I used parmesan cheese on top and, as a couldn't bear to use a canned salsa, made the Red enchilada sauce from this site. A little time consuming, but totally worth it! Now, sign me up for more of this, please!

Tis was really good, but I made a casserole instead on the enchaladas, by layering the tortillas after heating them, and putting a fair amount of ingredients on each layer.  I also added cooked and drained spinach to the mixture, added lots of onion and garlic.  It was a big hit with my husband and 4-yr old.

Wow, this recipe was so delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty closely with a few exceptions based on other reviews.  1) I bought a 19 oz. can of enchilada sauce and put a layer in the bottom under the enchiladas.  2)  I used flour tortillas.  3)  I put a small layer of refried beans on the tortilla before adding meat mixture.  4)  I sprinkled sliced green onions and olives on top of the enchiladas before covering it with cheese.  My boyfriend said they were delicious and to give them 5 stars, better than our favorite Mexican restaurant.  I will definately be making these again and to save time I'll put the chicken in the slow cooker in the morning with a can of cheddar cheese soup and tomato soup.

This has a very authentic taste. You can use boiled chicken breasts or a rotisserie chicken or leftovers. Shredding the chicken is important for the texture. The other thing you should be careful of is not to overfill...better to just buy extra tortillas and make more. I prefer green enchilada sauce to red. One thing that I'd like to share which will keep these firm, is when you take your cottage cheese out of the fridge. Take a minute and throw it in a colander or strainer so you are left without its liquid. After living in the Southwestern U.S. for many years, I can honestly say these rock!

Love it!! I am from New Mexico so I also make traditional enchiladas.  But these are so diffrent yet soo good! My kids and husband love them, and guests can't get enough. I use chile powder and cumin instead of the taco seasoning, and I make my own enchilada sauce. But I've also tried it exactly as the reipie states, and I was still great.

Made again this time w/o the onions and green chilies (picky 9 year old) and still Yummy as ever!

Thanks!

I made these enchiladas for my parents last week.  They were very good, very tasty and very filling.  Mum gave them a 5, I gave them a 5, Dad gave them a 4.  I made a few changes for our tastes and what ingredients are available in Melbourne at the moment.
I used low fat cottage cheese and sour cream to cut back on the fat.
I was unable to buy canned chillies or fresh so I used dried chilli powder by Masterfoods and pre-chopped chilli in a squeezable tube by Gourmet Garden.
I was also unable to buy Monterey Jack cheese so I substituted with shredded Coon cheese with Mexican spices.
I couldn't fit all 10 enchiladas into the pan I was using so I made it into a sort of casserole by pouring all of the left over chicken, red sauce and cottage cheese mix over the top and then sprinkling with the remaining cheese.
I only needed 15 minutes cooking time in my fan forced oven before the edges started to go black.
I made my own red sauce from the 'Red Enchilada Sauce' recipe on this website - it was perfect, just the right amount of heat for the family (we don't like things too spicy).  I recommend the recipe to others who like to vary the flavours a bit.
I found that the combination of low fat cottage cheese and sour cream caused a bit of extra moisture which made it a bit soupy when served up.  I think next time I will drain the cottage cheese to help with that.
I would definitely make this again.

WOW this was a suprising dish! I will definently make this one again. This is so far my favorite chicken enchilada recipe and I have had tons of them. I actually prefere these over enchiladas at local restraunts.

These were really good. Living in California, we have sampled lots of enchiladas, and this  recipe was better than I've had at most Mexican restaurants. Definitely my favorite of those I've made at home, and they didn't take much extra time to prepare. The only thing I did differently, is use a 19 oz. can of sauce -- they may have been a bit dry with the 10 oz. size. I beat my son to the leftovers this morning and took them to work for lunch. YUMMY!!

These are excellent, but because I need more spice and zing, I mixed the enchilada sauce with a can of Progresso cheesy enchilada soup.  It added so much more texture and flavor...a delectable meal! The family went gaga over it...my sister begs me everyday to make them now.

This recipe is a keeper and will be my standard enchilada recipe from now on.  My husband esp loved it.  I did cut down on the fat by useing skim milk cottage cheese and lite sour cream  I did not use the enchilada sauce at the end.  The cheese sauce was a little soupie so I was concerned if I added the enchilada sauce it would not be good.  That turned out to be very true and I was sooooo glad I didn't all that sauce would have ended up boiling the enchiladas in the oven and It would not have been good.  After saying all of that I should tell you that I made a little extra cheese sauce. But they were very good!!!!!!

I love the use of cottage cheese in this recipe - my husband won't normally even look at cottage cheese, but he agreed to try it in this recipe....and he liked it!  I added some salsa to the enchilada sauce to add a kick to the sauce - I think next time I will use extra sauce since some of the tortillas got a bit dried around the edges.  Overall, a great recipe.

This recipe was pretty good, but not my favorite.  I'll stick with my usual chicken enchilada recipe, but I'll use this one if I'm in the mood for something different.  I liked it better without the enchilada sauce, and next time I would drain the cottage cheese as it made them a little too runny.

Wow!  I never thought to use cottage cheese! My friends and I had a "girl's weekend getaway", and women who in their normal lives daintily pick at food looked like they were forming a rugby scrum around these enchiladas! I made one substitution: cotija (Mexican) cheese for the Monterrey Jack.  THANK YOU for a great recipe!

These enchiladas are fabulous!  It took me a lot longer than 30 minutes to prepare, though.  I heat the enchilada sauce in a saucepan and dip the tortillas in it, one-by-one, to soften them up before filling and rolling (rather than frying them).  I will make these again and again!

This recipe was fabulous and super-easy. To make your own enchilada sauce: 1 can diced tomatoes (with jalapeno), 2 cloves chopped fresh garlic, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 small bunch cilantro. Blend all ingredients in blender until smooth. SOOO much better than canned enchilada sauce!

I too was skeptical when I tried this recipe.  It does require a lot of prep time, so I suggest making it the day before.  It was worth it though, the flavor was wonderful.  I also added a little medium salsa to the meat mixture for an extra kick.  The only thing was the tortillas were very soggy, so I'll probably use less sauce next time.  Also I had a lot of cheese mixture left over and chose not to put it on top of the prepared enchiladas, maybe I will next time.  Overall, very good meal, even my husband who's not a big fan of Mexican loved it!!

I made these enchiladas last night...they were great!!  I had never made enchiladas before but we all thought that they were better than any restaurant enchiladas we had ever had!!  I did follow the tip to mix the meat and cheese mixtures together before putting them in the tortillas, it was one less step and I didn't see where it would have made a difference.  We will DEFINATELY have these again!!  Next time I think I'll invite company!!

I make this recipe with a couple slight modifications: I use flour tortillas instead of corn and I decrease the cottage cheese by half a cup.  I serve it with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced black olives and sour cream with sides of refried beans and Spanish rice.  My family LOVES these - I make them regularly - and everyone I make them for asks for the recipe.

Thank goodness I made plain, chicken and cheese, enchiladas at the same time I made these.  My family hated these.  I really think taco seasoning and cottage cheese with chicken is not a good combination.

thought these were very tasty and the cottage cheese gave it a nice texture.  However, they were so runny and messy that it ended up more like a layered casserole.  I would still recommend it though!

I was short on time so I used hamburger instead and also used flour tortillas (out of preference).  It was GREAT!  Use low fat cheese too...can't tell the difference.  This has been by far the quickest receipe for enchiladas!

Excellent recipe! I substituted 4 cups of leftover shredded pork from a roast the night before and it tasted fabulous! Also, I baked the enchiladas on a bed of spanish rice mixed with mexican corn (gandules next time!)and the rice kept the enchiladas from getting soggy. Plus the rice absorbed the extra sauce and made a great side dish! Thanks Crystal!

Yes, they took a bit of time but were well worth it - not like any other Mexican dish I've made before - a unique flavor with the cottage cheese.  I prepared in the morning and cooked for dinner.  Very good - thank you!

I'm a vegetarian who modified this recipe. It was SO good! I eat cheese (obviously) so I only omitted the chicken. I reduced the taco seasoning to half (because of the lack of chicken), & just threw everything in a bowl & mixed, made into enchiladas, topped with sauce & cheese & it was amazing! Even my carnivorous husband liked them! Thank you! :)

This was very good!  even though I used healthier choices (Whole grain tortillas,low fat sour cream, cottage & Monterey Jack cheeses. Im not a fan of canned enchilada sauces (too salty & perservative-y. So, I made the Ten Minute one from this site. Even with cooking chicken & fresh sauce, it was on the table in 1 hour 20 min. Of course,that time would be shortened with pre-cooked chicken & sauce. I made 4, not 2, medium size chicken breasts and yielded (7)nice size enchiladas. (a 9 x13 pan full)I topped with chopped lettuce, tomato, & sour cream. And ,served with a corn & black bean salad/salsa. Excellent hearty meal that I will make again & often.

This is an excellent enchilada recipe! The cheese mix is superb, the mix on ingredients is great as it stands.

I always add my own spin on things, and this was no exception. I put in one small bunch cilantro and added it during the taco seasoning addition/cook. I also did pepper jack inside each enchilada, and used a 12 oz. block of Monterey for the shredded cheese that went over each layer of enchiladas (I did two 8" x 8" baking pans so the in-laws could have some) and covered the bottom layer with sauce and cheese, and the top as well.

Where I really went off track was in adding some hominy. I fried it to get some color and texture, scraped the burnt pieces from the cast iron pan and mixed them in (awesome!) and added it to the taco seasoning cook also. The mix settled nicely as I heated the tortillas and then I plopped on a pile to each of TWENTY (instead of 12, since there was more filling... could have used twenty four) 6" tortillas. Each layer of five was covered with sauce and cheese, two layers per pan.

This recipe is golden! Thanks for sharing!!!

I just made these yesterday, and I am already ready for another batch!
These were SO GOOD!! The cottage cheese is much cheaper than ricotta, even though I like both. I made a double-batch of Mrs. Espy's Enchilada Sauce from this site (instead of canned). I used a big glass pan, and put a layer of sauce on the bottom (IMPORTANT TO KEEP THEM MOIST), filled it with enchiladas, and poured the remaining sauce on the top, topped it with a little more cheese and it was GREAT! Everyone in the family loved them, and requested this be put in the regular meal rotation! I ended up doing a couple things differently, due to what I had on hand.I used one chicken breast cubed and a tube of ground chicken.(Ground chicken works GREAT!) I also did not add the taco seasoning because the sauce was plenty spicy for our family. I baked it a little longer, because I had the pan crammed pretty full. (Note that exact measurements when filling your shells is NOT important - you might have different sizes in shells. I microwaved the shells, not fried. No need. Just make them rollable. So, you'll probably get slightly differing quantities of actual enchiladas.) Not sure if it is possible, but these tasted even better today than yesterday! The sauce made all the shells super soft, and it was like a mexican lasagna! Ha! Seriously, if you are on the fence about enchiladas with cottage cheese, don't be. You can't taste it separately at all - just loads of creamy goodness! THANK YOU for a really great recipe!

Move over "Angela's Awesome Enchiladas"...these were pretty darn good, and a little healthier! Using the crockpot makes quick work of this recipe. For recipes which call for shredded chicken, I find that you just can't beat boneless, skinless thighs for the flavor factor. I add 1/2 c chicken broth while the thighs are simmering. Then I add the taco seasoning near the end of cooking, as well as the sauteed onions and diced jalapenos. I used 2% cottage cheese and spiced up the mixture with some garlic/onion powders as well as cilantro and an eyeballed amount of the enchilada sauce. Next time, I'll use another can of sauce, as I like to pour a decent amount into the bottom of my baking dish, as well as smother the top of the assembled enchiladas. Using homemade tortillas and shredded cheddar cheese made these a yummy Saturday night dinner for the hubby and 4 year-old daughter.

I used 2% cottage cheese, omitted the onion by personal preference, and doubled the enchilada sauce.  Otherwise I made as directed.  These were really tasty and very filling.

I just made cheese enchiladas and poured leftover chili on top. I used little bits of several cheeses (cleaned out the cheese drawer) instead of the jack. The filling was tasty but a bit too reminiscent of lasagna filling.

I changed up a few things to my personal taste, but the cottage cheese & sour cream mixture really made this a total hit. I sauteed the chicken w/a tiny bit of oil.I used a well drained can of rotel tomatoes in place of the green chiles & onions. I put half a package of low sodium taco seasoning in the cottage cheese mixture. I also added adobo seasoning to the chicken b4 I sauteed it. I softened the corn tortillas in oil drained & blotted them w/paper towels. Then I dipped the tortillas in the ehchilada sauce. Then I filled them w/the cheese mixture & chicken. Finally I put the drained rotel on top followed by some cottage cheese mixture, drained rotel and then monterey cheese. Bliss just plain bliss.

Was looking to use up some cottage cheese, which we rarely eat, and this was great for that purpose. Good flavor but kind of one dimensional. If I had done my usual ritual with enchiladas, which includes fresh cilantro on the inside and fresh green onions on the outside, this would have been perfect! Definately needs a fresh/ acidic side to break it up, but the enchiladas are yummy. Strange concept with the cottage cheese, but definately works!

This is the second time I have made this recipe. This time I made it in layers instead of rolled like enchiladas. Much easier. I added 1 cup of black beans to the chicken mix and only a 4.5 ounce can of chopped chiles not 7 ounce. Bottom layer 6 torilla shells, chicken layer, cottage cheese mix, cheese mix, 6 tortilla shells, the enchilada sauce. WONDERFUL served with corn and spanish rice.

Excellent lower calorie/fat enchilada dinner.  I did do some substitutions but what caught my eye was the use of cottage cheese in an enchilada. I followed the recipe up until the addition of sour cream.  I used low fat plain yogurt in place of the sour cream.  I did use the cottage cheese but used low fat cottage cheese.  I had bought 8 inch tortillas and was able to use six of those in an 11x13 pan.  I omitted the salt completely and added about 1/2 cup of black beans to the chicken while it was cooking up with the onion.  Also used whole grain tortillas.  I would have followed the recipe exactly and think it would have turned out great but I am always trying to tweak a recipe to lose a calorie here and there.

Very tasty!  Next time, I might just layer the items rather than making rolled enchiladas (ex. layer meat then cottage cheese then cheese then meat then cottage cheese then cheese then enchilada sauce)

As a Mexican woman accustomed to authentic Mexican cooking, these were not what I would consider "authentic".  However, if you are not serving to a Latino crowd, these are very good in and of themselves.  Authentic enchiladas would NEVER feature taco seasoning mix (a major taste put off for me in Americanized Mexican foods).  Also, authentic Mex food rarely features sour cream and/or cottage cheese.  These were much too creamy for authentic.  As I was looking for an authentic recipe, I'll keep looking, however, these were good if I were looking for creamy goodness!

These were good although I think I like some other enchilada recipes from this site better.  The enchilada sauce I bought at ALDI was pretty spicy.  Only used half the amt of green chiles called for.
2nd time: used full amt of green chiles, plus added rotel tomatoes and jalapenos to half. well received by one kid. used torn corn tortillas on top and bottom and put all other ingedients together in  middle like a casserole with other half of tortillas then sauce and cheese on top. Good that way, easier, too.

We loved it. Used rotisserie chicken. It was easy fairly quick and delicious. My kind of meal. I buy two rotisserie chickens at our Sam's Club each time I go for $4.99. Debone them when I get home date the package and freeze in 2 cup portions so I always have chicken ready to put into a recipe. Makes this meal a snap. I will be making this a lot. Thanks Annabell for sharing this recipe.

Wonderful dish! So easy to fix too. Very mild, not spicy at all and hubs was impressed with this one. I made "The best red enchilada sauce" from here (and it was) and used Taco seasoning I (half the recipe). I only used 1/4 c onion ( all I had) and half of a 4 oz can of hatch peppers and it was already plenty peppery for me. This just barely made 10 enchiladas  so the next time I would use 1 more piece of chicken and made a few more. This was a great dish and I can't believe I waited so long to try it. It's been in my recipe box for years... Don't wait like I did, DO try this now.

I have been making these for the past 6 months and just love how many variations you can do with these.  I always use Costco chicken and sometimes I add black olives, or black beans to the meat mixture, I also add 1/2 c cilantro to the cottage cheese mixture and 1/2 c of salsa to the chicken mixture for more flavor.  This is one of my favorite recipes from this site.

Great enchiladas!  I used no fat cottage cheese and sour cream and drastically lowered the fat content without ruining the taste, which was delicious. I added a few olives that I had open, used cheddar (didn't have Jack).  I layered instead of rolling, much quicker til dinner time!

Restaurant style good!  The only think I did different was cook the chicken in the crock pot.  I added 2 cups of water and 2 chicken bullion cubes and cooked on low for 4.5 hours.  The chicken shredded came out so tender and shredded easily.  For an extra kick I topped with some cholula sauce.  Delish!

Made it just the like the recipe.  I thought it was my taste with first bite but none of my family would eat it.  Loved the other recipe from Allrecipes I made.  Will not make this one again.

Excellent.  I was apprehensive because I've always made enchiladas with a creamy sauce (light sour cream & light cream of something soup).  These were healthier and so muich better.  The only thing I did differently was add some chopped peppers & grated zucchini to the onions to make it healthy for the kids.  Was a for sure hit all the way around!

What a mess.  I followed exactly as directed and it was so sloppy, maybe I messed up somehow.  The only good thing for me was the meat mixture.  I tried before assembling the enchiladas, and would use it for chicken tacos.

This is one of my family favorites. Here are some things I do differently. 1. I add some chopped green and red peppers to the onions. 2.  Then I use shredded rotisserie chicken. 3. I use flour tortillas. 4. I coat each side of the tortillas in the enchilada sauce before assembling it. 5. I use two cans of enchilada sauce.

These were good. I don't like cottage cheese, but it was good in these. It wasn't distinguishable from other flavors or textures, though it's true it does not melt. I used AR's "Taco Seasoning I" and AR's "Red Enchilada Sauce" in place of the packaged ingredients. I also used flour tortillas, but wished I'd had corn tortillas because I like those a lot better. Overall these were good, and I think the sour cream/cottage cheese mixture is something I'll incorporate into other recipes -- I just have a preference for green enchiladas, and I think that if this recipe had called for green sauce I'd have loved it more. Husband loved them :=) Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome! I gave the recipe  to my aunt and she made her second batch with Alaska smoked salmon she caught herself. She said it turned out delicious. This recipe is amazing, especially if you're a beginner at making Mexican food. Thanks for the recipe.

The whole family loved this, which is not common around our house. Only changes: used green bell peppers instead of chiles, made homemade taco seasoning (from AllRecipes), and left out the salt. Be sure so spread a thin layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan before putting the food in. These were amazing... can't wait to eat the leftovers!

these were excellent and healthy alternative than the regular enchiladas with cream cheese inside.  I used cottage cheese and greek yogurt instead, blend it up in the food processor and the kids couldn't tell the difference! (they're used to eating it with cream cheese and sour cream in it)

Very good - and I pretty much followed as written (though I mixed the sour cream/cottage cheese mixture together with the chicken mixture).  I also covered the pan in the oven since I don't like the tortillas to dry out too much if they stick out of the sauce.  I like to serve this over shredded lettuce - adds a nice touch of green.  This was a little too spicy for my 7 year old, but the rest of us loved it!

Excellent! I added a can of sliced black olives on top before cooking. I served it with curtado (Salvadorean vinegared cabbage salad) to add some tangy crunchiness.  Next time I won't bother rolling the enchiladas, since while they stayed pliant enough to form nice tubes as I was putting them in the pan, the serving process after they were cooked completely undid them. Layering it like a casserole will be quicker and produce similar results.

Great flavor, quick/easy to make. I did make just a few changes though.  To save time, I used a store bought rotisserie chicken(I love those things!) And I just combined the meat mixture,cheese mixture, and shredded cheese together before spreading it in FLOUR tortillas.  Prefer those to corn.  Only other thing I did differently was to use green chile enchilada sauce that I stirred 1/2 cup sour cream into for topping.  I probably also used more cheese, I love cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I really liked this recipe.  I cooked the chicken with the taco seasoning and taco sauce in the Crock-Pot all day so shredding it was a breeze!  I also subbed Ro-Tel tomatoes for the chiles, because I thought I had some in the pantry and I thought wrong.  I got lazy (plus LOST was coming on!) so I just laid everything out, lasagna-style.  Great flavor and the leftovers were tasty the next day.  Next time I definitely want to make individual enchiladas...and there will be a next time!

This was delicious!  When my husband came home from work, it was ready to eat, and he ate almost half the pan.  (He was hungry)  I used cheddar cheese instead of the Monterey Jack, as that was what I had on hand, and 2 cans enchilada sauce.  I thought it might be too hot, but it seemed to mellow slightly after cooking.  Still had a little kick, though.  Took some to my husband's 90-year-old parents, so didn't want it to be too hot.  Had asparagus and corn to go with it, but hubby only wanted these enchiladas, so guess they were a hit with him.  Will definitely make again.

Wow!! This recipe was great. My husband and I both loved the addition of cottage cheese. I used Anna Marie's recipe for enchilada sauce (minus the chocolate) and it all came out so good. I think you could even leave out the sour cream completely and it'd still be delicious. Thanks for the good recipe annabell!

These enchiladas were pretty good. I liked the sour cream and cottage cheese mixture a lot. I did think that they had to much taco taste in them. I think if I make them again ill take the taco seasoning out and maybe substitute something with it.  Or I'll just use less of it. I think it could be a four or 5 without it. As is I would rate it overall a 3. I would rate the cheese mixture a 5 though. The person I made it for didn't care for it. I think he would have like it a lot better without the taco seasoning.

I give this recipe a 'D' for DELICIOUS!  I can't rate it high enough!!!  My family thought this was the best dish I've ever made...  I was happy to get the reaction I did and will be making it now in my household for years to come.  I did alter a bit after reading some reviews.   I grilled my chicken breasts - they were basted with olive oil, garlic salt and sage.  The outdoor flavor was noticed in the dish... I sauteed my onions in olive oil, with minced garlic on low.  Put in the green chiles and added cumin, oregano, the taco seasoning (for chicken) - and sliced the chicken breasts (not shredded or pulled or cubed) extremely thin.  Sauteed it all together on low heat.  ADDED Cilantro (which I didn't see anyone adding or commenting on this main ingredient that is in MOST mexican dishes!  HELLO!)... The cilantro and cumin blend beautifully!  Did as reviews suggested - sprayed non stick spray on bottom of 9x13 glass pan, then poured small amount of enchilada sauce prior to placing the rolled enchilada's in pan.  THAT IS KEY!!!!  I used corn tortillas.  Brought out the true flavor mixed with all the spices.  I layered in each - first the cottage cheese/sour cream mixture, then a little shredded cheese, sliced chicken concoction, ADDED black olives and more fresh cilantro.  folded left to right and placed upside down in pan.  My corn tortillas did NOT break at all... I was lucky.  I was able to place 5 on each side perfectly in the 9x13 pan - so 10 total.  The extra meat I spre

I loved this! The cottage cheese sour cream mixture adds a nice creaminess to the dish and really you could almost completely eliminate the other cheese if you wanted, making it a very lowfat dish. I used green enchilada sauce and just warmed the cooked chicken in it until it was shreddable. I did roll it into tortillas, but they pretty much fell apart. Next time I would make as a casserole - layer pieces of tortillas with the other ingredients. It really was yummy, and quite easy to put together.

With a few changes, this was fast, easy and 5 stars!  1. I used a rotisserie chicken and shredded the breasts. 2. Used fat free sour cream & 2% small curd cottage cheese.  3. Added a few chopped jalapenos from a can & scallions into the chix mix on the stove. 4. mixed cheese mixture & chix mixture together before spooning into warmed 6" flour tortillas (like another reviewer suggested, small pan on medium & warm tortillas 15-20 sec. on each side).  5. Sprinkled with shredded cheese, rolled tortillas.  I didn't want to use all of the leftover chix mixture on top so I spread only a little down the center (plenty leftover for another day).  Topped with 1 can of red enchilada sauce then sprinkled the rest of the shredded cheese.  Each serving was plated over some lettuce, topped with a dollop of sour cream, guacamole, sprinkled with scallions & fresh parsley.  Perfect! Thank you Annabell for a great recipe!

We loved this recipe.  We too added two cans of enchilada sauce and placed some of the sauce on the bottome of the pan.  The toppings could be endless.  This is a keeper!  PS  I used low fat cream cheese and low fat cottage cheese.  Thanks!

Wonderful recipe. The cottage cheese/sour cream really makes it interesting and tasty! I added a can of corn and a can of black beans (both drained and rinsed) to the chicken mixture. I poured just enough enchilada sauce to coat the bottom of the glass dish and then laid 6 corn tortillas open, the chicken mixture, the cheese mixture, 3/4 cup enchilada sauce, shredded cheese to cover and then repeated the layer. Everyone loves this meal!

I had to come back and review this again because it is soooo good. This is a staple meal in our house. We have trouble finding corn tortillas where we live so I always use the flour tortillas and they are excellent. Sometimes enchilada sauce is also hard to find. I tried to substitute strained salsa and it turned out runny. If in Ontario-try 'No Frills' for the enchilada sauce. If you see this recipe-it is a must try!

OMG! I have NEVER really been a fan of cottage cheese, the very sight of watching my mother eat it when I was a child still makes me kinda sick to my stomach! HOWEVER‚Ä¶. After seeing how many rave reviews this recipe has gotten, I thought I‚Äôd give it a spin‚Ä¶..and boy am I ever glad I did! Here‚Äôs a few things I changed: I used flour tortillas (I‚Äôve just always like them better) After I boiled my chicken, I stuck it in a zip-lock freezer bag and marinated it with a mixture of the taco seasoning (only used about half the recipe called for, the chopped Chile peppers, and a delicious TEQUILLA LIME Salsa that I recently discovered made by Pace.  I used MUENSTER Cheese instead of Monterey Jack. I stuck a divided slice inside each one, then covered the top when I was all done. Any previous experiences I‚Äôve had making chicken enchiladas always came out a little dry inside. The cottage cheese & sour cream mixture seems to have solved this problem, I also added a little of the salsa inside each one.  I will most certainly remember THIS one! ;^)

Absolutely fantastic! We *LOVED* these enchiladas! I made only minor changes to accomodate our tastes... added a clove of chopped garlic when the chicken and green chiles were simmering, used flour tortillas instead of corn, and used green enchilada sauce instead. This was just delicious, next time I will try it with the red enchilada sauce (though I really am addicted to green right now). I ate mine with sour cream on top, my fiancee ate his with some Frank's Red Hot. Thank you for this recipe, it was perfect!

This was just ok. I am SO glad I did not add the extra salt, but I am blaming my brand of enchilada sauce for making my tortillas soggy. This certainly has kick.

What a keeper! Instead of wrapping each corn tortilla with meat and cheese I made more of an enchilada lasagna. I used a casserole dish laid out corn tortillas, meat, and then cheese then layered it again. Then topped it all off with another layer of corn tortillas, cheese, and then the enchilada sauce. If you didn't want to use enchilada sauce you could use salsa on top. This time I put both, but next time I might just try the salsa.  By making it more of a layered dish it was much easier to put together and serve.

I used a rotisserie chicken for the meat, and also used an extra can of enchilada sauce. It doesn't matter if your tortillas (I used corn) don't stay in place or rip because when it's all done baking it's more like a casserole anyhow. Cut in squares when cooled & serve. I've made this two or three times now & it will be my staple chix enchilada recipe.

Maybe it was because I forgot to buy the enchilada sauce and made my own on the fly, but I thought the enchilada left something to be desired. it was really really good but was missing something. I'll buy sauce and make even more cheese sauce next time.

this was alright.  i really thought that it needed some more flavor.  It was a little runny from the cottage cheese.  but overall it was something different but i will probably just stick with my regular chicken enchilada recipe.

Me and my family really enjoyed this recipe.  First time I had ever made enchiladas. Very simple and quick, I was pressed for time so used a can of chicken.  Used a half a pack of taco mix, then used the rest for the "10 Minute Enchilda Sauce" that's on this site.  Excellent!

Used small soft tortillas.  Boiled and chopped chicken.  Place soft tortillas on bottom of 9 x13 lasagna pan. Added chicken mixture then cheese mixture followed by shredded cheese with jalepenos.  
Another layer of tortillas and repeat.  Finished with a sprinkling of shredded cheese and then enchilada sauce. Used what I had in the house.
Very good will make again.

We really like these.  The only change tha I make is to use nonfat plain yogurt in place of the sour cream.  I imagine it gives it a bit more zing, but since I haven't made it with sour cream I am not sure.  We love the flavor, texture and ease of this meal.  Our 3 kids love it too.

Pretty good recipe.  We liked it alot.  We served these on a bed of lettuce.  I did use ground beef just because the family probably prefers it, and we also spread a layer of refried beans on the tortillas.  I dipped the tortillas in the enchilada sauce as other members suggested and it was a great touch!!  I am chuckling as I think of this recipe because my husband will not eat anything with cottage cheese or sour cream, but after mixing these with the hand blender it looked just like ricotta cheese.  He loves lasagna, so that's what I say is in this recipe!!!  He won't be able to tell.  HeHe.

Excellent! The BEST chicken enchiladas I have ever ate. That includes all restuarant ones. The only modification I made was to process the cottage cheese with the sour cream in my food processor so there weren't any curds. My husband who hates cottage cheese and sour cream didn't even know that is what it was! (I didn't tell him either...hehe). Definately our new favorite!

This tasted very good.  Next time I think I'll make this as a "layered dish" instead of rolling up each tortilla---Not quite as pretty in the pan, but it looks the same on the plate.  I also used two cans of Costco canned chicken and a larger can (19 oz.) of enchilada sauce.  The kids really liked it.

I thought the cottage cheese was kind of a weird ingredient, and I was right.  These tasted more like lasagna than enchiladas.  These are not bad tasting, they just don't taste at all like enchiladas.

As if this recipe needs any more reviews.  I changed it up slightly.  I used my Crock Pot Turkey Breast recipe from this site. Used two cups of turkey meat that I chopped up fine with my Pampered Chef chopper.  I mixed all of the other ingredients except onions together stuffed the tortillas and topped with sauce and cheese.

These enchiladas were fabulous!!  To change it up a bit combine 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with the 1 can of red enchilada sauce.  Makes it really creamy!!  Definitely a keeper!!

These were great.  Made lots.  I used both flour and corn tortillas. They both tasted good, but the corn really broke apart. I think I would make a casserole ( as suggested earlier) if I used the corn again.  Will definitely make these again.

My husband absolutely loved these enchiladas!  I did it the speedy way and used 2 cans of Costco/Kirkland  white meat chicken breast and only one small can 4.5 oz of chopped green chillies. The rest of the recipe, I followed to the letter except for adding a can of sliced black olives over the top. So easy to make too. My 5 year old ate every bit and told me, "I like these mom!" I followed another reviewers advice and let the dish set for 5 minutes before serving...not so messy that way. We're eating the left-overs tomorrow for dinner...YUMMY :) When I have more time, I use chicken pulled from a rotisserie hen. Makes this recipe even more delicious!

YUM! These were quite good. Next time though I would cut back a tad on the cottage cheese but it was a nice change from the creamy sour cream chicken enchiladas I usually make. Very good!

So yummy!  I used cooking spray instead of oil and used low-fat sour cream, cottage cheese, and cheese, and it was still awesome.

These are fabulous....and its fun to tell people afterwards that they were made with cottage cheese. Nobody ever believes me! Have been using this recipe for quite some time - and any variations work! Try chicken/turkey/beef, green saucs, different cheeses, etc. Thanks for the recipe!

It is a hit! Not only does the whole family love it but it makes so many that we freeze it and it makes a great lunch to heat up!

This is sooo yummy! I am mad at my self for adding it almost a year ago and trying this week. I made 3 pans and froze two. Why make a large mess for just one meal! My husband loved them as well as my kids and best friend. I will make these again and again. Allright here are the changes I made. I heated the tortillas in a damp towel in the microwave and then dipped them in the enchilada sauce before rolling and filling. I also was worried about enough sauce so I added a can of tom. sauce and 1 cup of pace salsa. It gave me plenty of sauce. Great recipe

Super easy, did take longer than the 30 minutes to prep though.  I did make some changes.  I used mild Salsa Verde in place of the red sauce and it was great and I dipped each tortilla in the salsa verde before adding the filling. I also served it with shredded lettuce and a dollop of sour cream - awesome!

Wow! So good and really not that hard to make!  I varied the recipe slightly, using mozzaralla cheese and sauteed fresh green peppers instead of canned chile peppers.  I served them up with corn meal muffins and it made for a very tasty and filling meal.

I love this recipe! My family has made it 3 times... each time making it a little different and each time it is delicious!  My favorite variations include mozzarella cheese, flour tortillas, adding some queso fresco, adding cumin and garlic in place of taco seasoning.

This dish was excellent and a big hit with my family. The only change I made was rather than grease the dish I poured some enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan before adding the enchiladas.  I also increased the amount of sauce I topped them with.

WOW! These are good. I took a chance because of all the good reviews on this one. Cottage cheese in enchiladas?!  I am so glad that I did. These are excellent! I stirred 1 1/2 cups of grated cheese into the sour cream, cottage mix to cut down on a step. I also used a cooked whole chicken, de-boned and shredded. I used two cans of enchilada sauce,but,I did not increase any other ingredients. I dip my tortillas in the sauce before I fill them to keep them soft and they won't crack. This made 25 enchiladas. So good!! Thank you for this one!

Fantastic! I did one thing differnt to save time. I put the chicken, the can green chili's, and some enchilada sauce in the crock pot. After it had cooked I cut the chicken in chunks and let it cook some more then I shredded it easily.

I was a little skeptical about the cottage cheese part, but it was delicious!  I fed my neighbor also, and he thought it was awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Go ahead try it, you'll like it.

Great!  This is one of our favorites!  To cut down on the prep time, I mix everything except tortillas and 1 c shredded cheese.  I tear up 6 tortillas and layer on bottom of the pan, cover with 1/2 mixture (then repeat) and top with 1c shredded cheese.  I add cilantro and cayenne to the meat mixture to give it additional kick.

These were very good. I would make a few changes though just because I am no longer carnivorous. First, this made 12 enchiladas. Since its just me and my husband, I froze half of this precooked- as another reviewer suggested. My husband loved his b/c of the chicken. I just used the cheese mixture and the cottage cheese was a little overwhelming without an addition to it. Next time I may simply double the amount of onion/green chilies or add spinach or something just to add more substance to my enchiladas to compliment the cheese. These turn out messy as most Mexican food does but were really very good and had a good kick to them. (I added a bit of the seasoning straight to the cheese mixture also). Thanks and I will make these again!

Geat tasting enchiladas!  I served these for my guests last night and they were asking for the recipe.  I did follow the advice by mixing 1 cup of the shredded cheese with the meat mixture and cottage/sour cream mixture.  It saved a lot of work.  For some reason, I had to use 20 corn tortillas and 2 cans of enchiladas sauce, but it still tastes wonderful.

I've made this recipe twice and my family loves it.The only thing I do different is I don't add the chiles, I only use 1/2 pack of taco seasoning, and I mix the cheeses in the pain with the chicken before filling the tortillas.This gives the enchiladas a milder taste.

these were nice for a change, i did assemble them a little different, i made the chicken mixture and the cheese mixture and mixed them together and then put the whole mixture into the tortillas,i also didn't use red enchilada sauce i used elpato's jalepeno sauce and that added an excellent flavor- mmmmmm----- mine made 8 enchiladas because i put so much of the extra chicken-cheese mixture on the top of the 'chiladas---- mmmmmmmmmmm try it it's a nice change from the norm'

The enchiladas were tasty; the cottage cheese and sour cream made a great mixture.  However, it was very messy and created a big clean up.  These were good to make one time but I would not make them again.

This was excellent!!!  I put the chicken in the crockpot in the morning with a little broth and cooked them on low all day.  They shredded beautifully.  I also used lowfat cheeses and sour cream and it cut the calories and fat by more than half.  WONDERFUL recipe, great change of pace!!!

Everyone in my family loves this recipe.  We have it at least once a month.  Sometimes I cut a couple of jalape√±os in with the meat mixture to give it a little extra kick.

This recipe is great just as written, and I highly recommend it.  I've ended up making tweaks over time just to make it faster and adjust it to my family's preferences.  I use the meat from 1/2 of a cooked rotisserie chicken.    I use a packet of Lawry's chicken taco seasoning mix.  I  saute the onion in a little butter until its soft, then throw in the diced chilies, the chicken, and the packet of dry seasoning mix.  (I skip adding the water etc.  on the seasoning package directions).  After mixing thoroughly, I add the cottage cheese and some mixed Monterey jack and cheddar (maybe 1 1/2 cups?).  I mix it all together and roll about 1/2 c.+  of the chicken mixture up in white corn tortillas.  I use either Hatch or El Paso enchilada sauce (2 cans).  I've also made this with green enchilada sauce.  This dish always gets raves!

.....looks great, but I wanted to add a caution in using Aluminum Foil.  The red chili burns holes in the foil.  When I use it, I put down foil, and a layer of parchment.   I cover them in the same way for storage.
Also pass the tortillas through hot oil instead of heating them .... Traditional..  otherwise the tortilla maintains
the raw taste.   (From this 78  year old Mexican/Indian grandmother)

omfg good! having lived and cooked in South Texas for the last 30 years, I thought I knew it all, lol! No, there is nothing "authentic" about this recipe ( at least not here in Corpus Christi!). Who cares? This recipe is fantastic! my changes: i made my own enchilada sauce ( although when i don't have time for that i like one can of enchilada sauce + one can of wolf's  chili with no beans--- my hispanic sister-in-laws taught me that trick).  The enchilada sauce recipe is  "10 minute enchilada sauce" from this website.  Also, I used ground turkey that was already seasoned  for tacos.   I probably used double the amount of sauce.  not sure if the recipe  specified this or not, but my method is to heat 6 corn tortillas in  the microwave for 1 minute. this softens them up so they are easier to roll up.  i pour about 1/4 a cup of sauce all over a 9*13 pan, and make most of them with onions that have been sauteed, and  can usually fit 6 or so on the side of the pan, in groups of 2- that have no onion - for my son.  that way i can tell his apart, lol!  Then i dip each tortilla in the sauce and lay it in the pan, ready to fill.  I have all my stuff lined up in bowls- cheese mixture, meat, cooked onions + ,minced jalapeno peppers-- my little factory! Another tip, if you don't have time for all that, cut your corn tortillas into 4ths and layer everything like you would for lasagna! **Lastly, as I had no sour cream, I had a large container of Dean's sour cream and onion dip. I mixed tha

This is a very good recipe.  I agree with other reviewers that it needs more than 7 oz. of enchilada sauce;  I used about 16 oz. out of a 28 oz. can.  Next time I'll make my own sauce, now that I know how much I need.  I also followed the advice of others that said the recipe doesn't need additional salt.  I used 1/8 t. of pepper, and probably will used 1/4 t. next time.  I did pressure cook my chicken breasts in homemade turkey broth, and it was flavorful and easy to shred.  The only thing I did different was exchange nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream because I always have yogurt on hand.  Can't wait to make this again.  Thank you for a wonderful, easy recipe.

Wow this is a great recipe. I used flour tortillas and did what other reviewers said and coated the tortillas in sauce first. I also used two cans of enchiladas sauce, as I like mine with a lot of sauce. The last thing I did was mix the cheese mixture in with the meat mixture. They were so tasty. These were not to spicy for my youngest child and had great flavor for everyone else. We topped ours with sour cream and salsa. This recipe made a lot so I recommend freezing one pan unless you need to feed 8 people at a time. These are very filling ESP since I made decried beans and Spanish rice. These are going in my dinner rotation.

We enjoyed these very much.  The only change I made was using a can of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese because I had opened it by mistake for another recipe and needed to use it up.  I simply mixed it in with the chicken instead of using shredded.

Use the corn tortillas.  I had some of each and the corn were really good.  I pretty much followed the recipe other than a few flour tortillas i had.  Bad idea.  I did use verde sauce since there were green chilies and a large can of it because i pour it in the pan I use to heat the tortillas and coat them.  

Olives, beans and flour tortillas make this an entirely different experience.  Just try the recipe once.  And add the chilies to the onions and chicken last so they will brown.  or drain the can of chilies.  or both.

This was a very tasty recipe, especially on the second day. I slow-cooked the chicken in beer, onions, pepper, cumin and garlic as another reviewer suggested.  I also only added the taco seasoning to only half of the enchiladas for comparison. I actually originally cringed at the thought of adding the taco seasoning; I thought the chicken and green chili pepper combination was very good on its own and didn't want to ruin it. After all was said and done, my suspicions were correct. I had a strong preference for the enchiladas without the extra seasoning; they just tasted so much more authentic.(..as my tongue would define authenticity.) I would suggest trying both variations. I will definitely be making these enchiladas again.

Made it as per the recipe first couple of times, and it is perfect. but now I'm on a diet lol! Sooo I left the cheese on the half of enchiladas my kids were going to eat, used low fat for both the cottage cheese and sour cream, added veggies on hand (Bok choy, mushrooms and red peppers) subbed the the enchilada sauce(didn't have any) for salsa. Used a low sodium taco mix, and added an extra chicken breast to stretch it out for lunches the next day. Turned out just as good as the original, and was only 235 calories per taco wrap! Yay!

WOW.  This turned out great.  I made my own enchilada sauce using the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce.  I also made the Best Spanish Rice.  The whole meal was outstanding and easy to make.  I was dubious because of the cottage cheese, but it worked.  I don't think it would have worked without the chicken.

Make sure u fry corn tortillas slightly BEFORE u try stuffing or rolling them into enchiladas - you'll never be able to work with them otherwise, they'll just break all over the place! Just pan-fry them on the stove for a few seconds on each side with a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil first, then they'll be nice and pliable for you to work with!

I have made this several times, and it is amazing! I didn't have any chili peppers, so I used frozen "fajita mix", green and red peppers and onions.  Instead of boiling the chicken, I put the breasts in a crock pot on low overnight with a cup of chicken broth.  Excellent!

I've made this at least a half dozen times since I first started trying it out. I don't make any changes to the recipe other than trying to use 'light' products whenever possible. The first time I made this, I had my Mexican friend over and she said they tasted just as good as her mom's! She couldn't believe it was made with cottage cheese! That first casserole dish full of enchiladas got completely devoured by 3-4 women in one night! There were no leftovers. I was amazed! It also was my go-to recipe the for one of the first times I cooked for my boyfriend, and he liked it so much he even requested I make it for one of our special occasion dinners. I've made it for a potluck, and it got all kinds of compliments. Seriously, this recipe is fantastic and easy!

good, but it didn't need the tsp of salt.  the taco seasoning is salty enough.  we made this tonight & the oversalting ruined the recipe.  it's a shame because i'm sure we would have loved it otherwise...

This is exactly what I was looking for: a high fiber, meatless, easy to make, enchilada recipe with ingredients I have on-hand.  Instead of the recipe sauce, I used a bottled green salsa which I cooked down to thicken.  I didn't have any canned refried beans, so used the boxed dried beans reconstituted (1 C beans in 1 C boiling water). I actually prefer corn tortillas, but used the high-fiber flour ones and was thrilled that they seemed as good as corn in this recipe.  I cooked at 375 degrees until lightly browned in my toaster oven.  Since others liked the recipe sauce, I will try it another time, but using the bottled sauce made this the easiest enchilada recipe ever.

Great recipe!  I decided not to use onions or the taco seasoning mix and it turned out just fine.  I just seasoned the meat with a little salt and sugar for taste.

I would have never dreamed to make enchiladas with cottage cheese!  These were so creamy and just downright delicious.  My husband hates cottage cheese, so I didn't tell him that it was in it..and he never noticed.

These are phenomenal.  My husband is not a huge fan of cottage cheese, so I now I make these without the cheese mixture.  So easy and it makes enough for two dinners for us, so I freeze one for an easy dinner later.  Great!

This recipe really surprised me. Even my husband (who is from Texas and thinks those of us in the North can't cook Mexican or Tex Mex) thought it was delicious. Only caution is that it was best fresh, as with most things. My kids complained that the tortillas were a bit chewy as leftovers.

This was surprisingly yummy. I had my doubts about the cottage cheese, but it was great. The chicken mixture by itself is great mixed with mexican rice. I like to add more (almost double) enchilada sauce to this recipe. I like the way the corn tortillas mixed with the sauce remind me of tamales, one of my favorite mexican foods.

Wonderful! Been wanting to make these for a long time, finally did tonight for dinner. Followed another reviewer and slow cooked 3 chicken breasts with 1/2 a beer, cumin, garlic, pepper and cinnamon. Then followed the recipe as written. Wow, it was so good. The cottage chesse mixture melts into this rich creamy filling that is amazing. Wow. I'm so proud of this dish and will make again.

This tasted ok but looked kind of gross.  I layered the corn tortillas like a lasagna because they were falling apart.  I think I will use flour tortillas if I make it again.  I did like all the cheeziness from the cottage cheese (I used 1%) and the shredded cheese (again used reduced fat) though.

This is a wonderful recipe. It was so tasty, and wonderful. I loved it. I will say it was a labor intensive recipe for me, prep took along time for me. But it was so worth it. The Hubs and boy loved it, and so did I.

Very good. I made them exactly as written except I used flour tortillas because my family doesn't like the corn ones. I give it 4 stars only because I don't think it called for enough cheese. I'd double it next time.

Double enchildada sauce, feel free to mix filling ingredients together (chicken and cheeses), much easier to assemble and tastes great.  Was a hit at church pot luck, I used mild green chili enchilada sauce.

Made these for Cinco De Mayo dinner for my family. Everyone loved them... and then loved the leftovers as well. Takes a bit of prep - but you really trim fat/calories by using the cottage cheese. Combining w/just a bit of sour cream gives it that succulent creamy flavor. This dish is very versatile as well if you would like to make it vegetarian... just saute bell peppers/onions - add some black beans and you have an awesome meal!  Thanks so much!

This is very good!  The sour cream and cottage cheese really add alot.  Used flour tortillas (our preference) Instead of canned red sauce I made a green sauce from this site.  This will be the only enchilada recipe I use.

I've prepared this dish numerous times for family and friends.  It always has been a hit.  I use roasted chicken and saute the onion separately, mixing the onion mixture with the chicken later to save time.  For variety, I have used verde sauce rather than red sauce.  A great recipe.

I rate this on the flavor, not how they turned out for me. I followed another poster's suggestion and layered the ingredients in a pan with flour tortillas. It turned out a gooey mess that tasted wonderful, but looked bad. I used homemade enchilada sauce(Mrs. Espys from this site) and think I used too much sauce. I also didn't have enough cottage cheese, so I added some refried beans I had on hand. That added texture and taste and I would do that again. The chicken I used was leftover Sweet and Spicey Picante chicken from this site. It already had salsa in it, so I just shredded it, added the taco seasoning and water and stirred it together.  My husband said it was really good. A do over will happen and I will make the actual rolled enchiladas using corn tortillas. The cottage cheese was a great ingredient as it allowed less actual shredded cheese and still gave that rich flavor.

This is absolutely going on my quick dinners list!  I had some left over rotisserie chicken left over from Costco, so I shredded some of that up to use.  Quick, easy and delicious.  My bf gobbled this up before I could have seconds. =(

These are VERY VERY good!  I made this with refried beans, and the Mexican rice III and it was a great dinner all around.  The only thing I will change, is next time I will add about a 1/4 of another can of enchilada sauce.  I like very saucy enchiladas though.  and a tip with boiling the chicken..I boil mine in Chicken broth with some pepper, cumin and turmeric.  I then reserve the chicken broth and use it for the mexican rice :)

These were VERY good!!! Where I live, they don't have canned enchilada sauce, so I ended up making my own (I used a non-tomato based enchilada sauce recipe from this site. the recipe is by Anna Marie). My sauce ended up a little thick, but it was delicious and worked VERY well with these enchiladas! I will definitely be making these again! Yum!

Absolutely delicious dish!!  However, I did prepare the chicken a little differently than the actual recipe.  Instead, using my slow cooker, I added the chicken breasts (whole), about 1 c chicken broth,  and a generous sprinkle of cumin, garlic powder, and a pinch of chili powder.  I then cooked it on LOW for  6 hours.  When the chicken was done, I shredded it and put the meat aside, (reserving all of the leftover broth), while I browned the onions and chile peppers.  Once the peppers and onions were ready, I mixed them together with all of the reserved broth from my slow cooker, the shredded chicken, and an entire taco seasoning packet.  I also used whole wheat tortillas instead of the corn and slapped some refried beans on the bottom of each tortilla.  The cottage cheese made this dish SO creamy and yummy, it's a wonderful addition.  Lastly, I followed another reviewers advice of really covering the enchiladas in the sauce to keep them moist.  Both Hubby and I loved these :~)

This was the first time I have ever made enchiladas.  My seven year old daughter and I made them and a friend said they were better than any restraurant enchiladas.   WOW!!!!

I'm rating this a five for two reasons:  it's great and it's the easiest enchilada recipe I've ever made!  Used low fat sour cream and cottage cheese.  I would suggest shelling out for high quality tortillas.  The corn ones I used fell apart very easily.  I ended up keeping them flat and covering them with another tortilla.  Worked pretty well.

Mmmm... very good!  We really liked this.  I grilled the chicken with the taco seasoning mix on my GF grill and just added some onion powder to the cottage cheese mixture.  I think I'll use about a half cup less of the cottage cheese next time, since it was a touch soupy.  I sprinkled chopped black olives over top before baking, which added to the appearance and taste.

For years now I have been making the "Chicken Enchiladas I" recipe from this website, my husband and I both LOVE it! So, I thought I would try something new with this recipe.. Well I learned the old saying "Don't mess with perfection" is true! I will not be making this dish again, I will stick with our regular recipe. I followed this recipe exactly except for using flour tortillas instead of corn, and found it to be bland compared to our usual recipe. We did not like the enchilada sauce, and prefer taco sauce instead. The enchilada sauce mixed with the cottage cheese just did not look appealing and kinda smelled bad. Will not be making this recipe again, but if you decide to I would make one major recommendation.. Use 16oz of Taco sauce instead of 10oz of enchilada sauce, I think this would help this dish alot.

this was really, really good.  I went all the way and used homemade taco seasoning, homemade enchilada sauce and homemade tortillas.  Insanely good.  My only complaint is that I did NOT like the smell of it being reheated, so I wouldn't eat it (but my husband gobbled it up).  But that's just my own weirdness coming out.  ;)

Great!  Can't tell it cottage cheese (even fooled my bf who hates the texture) It was a hit.  And I froze half for a later date and just defrosted and reheated and they were excellent as well.

Turned out yummy, only change I would make would be make it a greater chicken to cheese ratio.  It will help thicken the enchiladas and make them less mushy :)

My partner had a hankering for enchiladas, but I had never made them before.  I decided on this recipe and girl was it a hit!  Two snaps and an around the world  hehe.  The enchilada sauce I used was a little too sweet for us, so watch the sugar content on the can.

I loved this recipe--the cottage cheese gives a great creamy texture to the filling.  To save time, I used a whole deli chicken which I pulled all the meat off of.  Deli chickens are already seasoned & salted, so I used a little less taco seasoning.  I also used flour tortillas since I always have them on hand.  Have made this several times and my husband and guests love it.  Makes great left overs too!

This was an easy, great recipe and we made it exactly as noted.  Next time we will use hot seasoning mix for a little more kick.  We served with lettuce and tomato on top and it was restaurant quality.  Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty tasty‚Äîeverybody said it was delicious‚Äîbut I was a bit disappointed and I don't think I'll make it again. Seemed to me to have too much cottage cheese and perhaps not enough sour cream. Also, the enchiladas basically fell apart in the oven, so I wasn't able to serve individual enchiladas like we get in the restaurant; instead the dish turned into more of a casserole. Perhaps I did something wrong but I think I followed the recipe to the letter, yet in the end, there seemed to be too much moisture in the dish. I think it was the moisture that must have caused the enchiladas to fall apart. If I did make it again, I might put the enchiladas in the oven without any topping at all initially, then add the remaining chicken, cheese mixture, cheddar and enchilada sauce during the last 5-10 minutes.

Great base to start with. You can add/ommit to your liking. I had leftover red sauce so i added some taco powder and medium salsa and used that for the pan and to pour over enchiladas. I used low fat sour cream and cottage cheese and no shredded cheese (dieting). No oil needed. If you're dieting and craving Mexican this does the trick!

My first ever attempt at enchiladas and these were awesome!!  I halved the recipe since I was only cooking for 2, but still used an entire chicken breast which worked perfect.  I didn't have taco seasoning on hand, so I used "taco seasoning I" recipe on this site which was superb (and spicy!).  These were about as spicy as I could handle and I loved them!  I did add some sliced black olives.  Mine were also slightly runny as I removed them from the pan onto plates, but that was probably my own fault somehow.  It did not take away from the taste at all though!

We loved this recipe and will make this again. Only change I made was to add black olive to the chicken mix, and black olive slices to the top. Delicous  recipe, give it a try!

THESE WERE AMAZING! I had to triple the recipe because I ended up inviting my parents over to eat. I only changed one thing; I used a can of corn with red peppers instead of chiles. My two year old ate more than I did! This will definitely be on our regular menu now.

I didn't follow the recipe to a "t," but it was excellent.  I used only sour cream (a large container of it) instead of sour cream & cottage cheese and it was still tasty!  Also, I mixed my own spices (cumin, pepper, oregeno...) instead of the taco seasoning.  I might recommend more chicken.

These enchiladas were wonderful!  I assembled the night before and baked when I got home the next night.  I shredded two cooked rotisserie breasts, doubled the sauce, used green (instead of red) enchilada sauce, and fresh serranos (instead of green chilies) and the were delicious!  I was able to make two trays--a 13x9 and a 9x9 and each tortilla was stuffed full!  Fast, easy and delish!

Wow were these good. My husband asked me to make these again after he took the first bite! I had to use flour tortillas as they were out of corn at the store. Also I added a small amount of Cilantro and Cumin. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Did not find this soggy at all as some other reviewers did.

This recipe is really good. I would definitely add more spice, as in jalapenos or something like that. My coworkers loved it though! the cottage cheese was so yummy! I'm not even a huge fan of cottage cheese.     I used a roasted chicken and flour tortillas dipped in the sauce to keep them moist. really easy to make!

Pretty quick, and very good.  Has just enough spice, but not too hot.  I love that you get some extra healthy protein from the cottage cheese.

My 2 teenagers thought this was great.  My husband, thought it was the best enchiladas he's ever had! Now that's saying A LOT! The directions are weird. Step-by-step they didn't make any sense. I improvised and did what I thought they meant. I probably would add some cilantro and sliced olives next time.

this was my first attempt at enchiladas and it wasn't complicated at all ;) i think next time i'm going to use bigger corn shells if i can find them and make extra meat mix. i only had enough for 10 shells and no extra on the top which sounded good to me.. otherwise, easy and tasty ;)

Made my husband (and his whole dealership) crazy over these! YUMMY! I put frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot with the chopped onion, fresh jalepeno, green chilis, fresh garlic, a few TBSP of tomato sauce. Shred after five hours and then use the taco seasoning in a separate pan. Followed the rest of the instructions pretty much completely. Love them!

I would never have thought this would work, but oh my it does.  I added a sprinkle of cheese in each tortilla along with the ricotta and it made a delightfully, creamy filling. I used a homemade enchilada sauce, and the secret there is to add a tsp or two of dutch cocoa powder, yum yum.  Delicious.

Not what I would call authentic, but they were so good I didn't care!  Rated the recipe 4 stars as written, but 5 with changes that I made.  I added black beans and corn to the meat mixture and used enchilada sauce and salsa instead of taco seasoning.  I'm excited to try it again with verde sauce!

Tasty-good alternative to the heavy cheese in a standard enchilada.  I added a can of black beans to the chicken and used low fat cottage cheese and sour cream.  Also flour tortillas becasue that's what I had.  For sauce I use Emril's recipe as a steandard.

Delicious!  I made this for company and everyone went back for seconds.  I spread some enchilada sauce on the bottom and swirled each warm tortilla around in it before putting the goodies in, which kept the dish moist.  Wonderful and easy recipe!

Yum! What a great way to use cottage cheese that was bought in bulk and there's no way for one person to finish it =) I followed pretty close to the recipe and had great results. (Prepared chicken in skillet, cooked covered, slowly...seasoned w/ salt, pepper, and cumin. Then used whole wheat tortillas.) Will have to report back on how well they freeze. I froze most of it for a later date...***UPDATE: reheated it is amazing. I made some freezer meals for my BF and he couldn't stop raving about this one. Made again tonight. I don't brown the meat with the onions/chiles or it becomes to easy for it to dry out. This is a HUGE hit with us. Enjoy!

This dish was good, not great. I really like flavor of the chicken mixture, but the cottage cheese in these enchiladas was weird to me. I would make this again but I wouldn't add any cottage, that's just my preference. Also, I wouldn't recommend 30 minutes in the oven, it turned a little dry.

This recipe has great flavor, and my entire family loved it. The only issue I had with it was the texture--it was so mushy the first time I made it that it just fell apart. Still, the taste was delicious. The second time I made it I fried the tortillas in hot oil before rolling, and it made a slight difference in texture. Nevertheless, this is some really great tasting mush! ;)

These were the best Enchiladas I have ever eaten! I followed the recipe exactly & they turned out perfect. Everyone asked for seconds, even my picky eater! Thank you for posting this recipe. We are making it a regular around here!
*We make this frequently still but now we just layer everything (except the shells)in a baking dish & bake until hot & melted. Then we warm flour tortillas & spoon the filling in, & pour a little extra enchilada sauce over the top. It's sooo much easier that way & taste the same.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Like a previous reviewer, I did not roll the enchiladas, but I layered the ingredients in a 9x13 pan, like a lasagna. I combined the meat and chees mixtures. I used flour tortillas and I did not add the salt. I would like to try rolling them, but this is so much easier and still tastes great.

I followed the suggestions in the first couple of comments, but i also added 4 oz of cream cheese to the cheese mixture.  They were rich and delicious.  Way better than the other recipes I've tried for enchiladas!

These were excellent.  To save time, I did not roll the enchiladas.  I added a small amount of enchilada sauce to the bottom of a 9x13 pyrex dish.  Layered beginning with 6 tortillas...cottage cheese mixture...chicken/onion mixture...2 cups of cheese and 6 more tortillas.  Covered with sauce and more cheese.  Very easy and the whole family loved them!

Loved this recipe!  I will definitely make this again!  I just sprinkled the chicken with a small amount of taco seasoning.  The enchilada sauce, chilies and onions gave everything enough flavor.

OK, these were awesome!  My husband LOVES them!  He doesn't want me to go back to my old chicken enchilada recipe.  I might try experimenting with it a little in the future.  My four kids (ages 3 to 9) all ate it up too.  I didn't make it too spicy though so that they would eat it!

This had good flavor. I threw it in the crock-pot as other reviewers had mentioned. This made it really easy. It was a little  runny and messy, but it had good flavor.

This was a very good recipe.  I only made one small change.  I cooked the chicken in olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Love it love it love it.  I was skeptical when it came out of the oven.  And then I was shocked that I made it.. it tasted THAT good.  Make it tonight.  I don't even like cottage cheese--AT ALL.  And I loved this.  Will make again, for the inlaws!

Yikes, I had planned to make this thinking I had needed ingredients but I didn't - I went ahead and improvised and it was awesome!...I used huge wheat flour tortillas I already had bought, and still warmed them in oven, used the cottage cheese and pepper, spooned some already bought container of BBQ meat on the tortilla, then cottage cheese with pepper (didn't have sour cream) then (didn't have any shredded cheese) so layered each tortilla with BBQ meat, then cottage cheese then 2 slcies of provolone cheese, and rolled very simply as it was THICK and ONLY 2 made the size of the dish I was using (which was what I wanted anyway!) then I topped with 2 more slices on each tortilla top of each of the 2 tortillas and a last lump of the BBQ chicken on top, then baked it at 350 degrees for the suggested 30 minutes and it was ABSOLUTELY awesome!  Not to take away from original recipe,but just didn't have the same ingredients as THE original recipe, so wanted to share an alternative using what ingredients you DO have close to the original recipe...surely the original recipe is as good and will try it THAT way when I find I have the CORRECT ingredients!

I would have given this 5 stars but I changed a few things in this recipe. Instead of canned sauce I used Mrs Espys Enchilada Sauce, Rotisserie Chicken, and I put chedder cheese on top. This came out wonderful! My husband said these are the best enchiladas he EVER had. I thought they were too. I have found the perfect recipe for enchiladas. I won't have to look anymore! YUMMY!

These were fabulous.  We had four adults and a toddler, and everyone enjoyed these.  I made 6 of the enchiladas with shredded chicken as the recipe states, and then 6 of the enchiladas were filled with spinach filling.  I just sauteed the garlic and onions in the oil, added the chilies and taco seasoning, and then split all of this between two bowls -- one containing thawed/drained frozen spinach, and one containing shredded chicken.  I also just mixed the shredded cheese, cottage cheese and sour cream right in with the chicken and spinach to save time when filling.  I thought this was a very easy and filling recipe.

I made this for my family and everyone loved it. Very good flavor my mom asked for the recipe before she left. Easy to make I did use flour tortilas instead of corn. Will be making this again.  I have even used this recipe with ground chuck instead of chicken and it was wonderful!!!

Don't hate me 'cuz "technically" I changed the recipe!  I REALLY wanted to give it FIVE! 
     I made the Enchilada Sauce (another recipe on this site - it's a mole type of sauce with chocolate in it and no tomatoes), used three fresh green chilis and half an orange bell pepper in place of the canned chilis, and only had flour tortillas on hand.
     Oh my GOODNESS this was SO DELICIOUS!  My BF came home from work the next day and heated up the leftovers for himself straightaway!  The only meal he ever does that for is my lasagna...

i am speechless. i made this recipe based on all the rave reviews it received...this was the WORST recipe i have ever made for my family, and that is saying a lot, since i've been through some pretty awful recipes in my day.  i would never, ever make this again.  SALTY!  holy.  i would have been better off eating the salt shaker directly.

i live in canada, so perhaps our sauces and seasoning mixes are different?  i don't know.  this was just horrendous.

they were better than restaurant enchiladas which can be kind of mushy- i topped it with chopped green onion and sliced black olives for a nice look and then served with sour cream mixed with chopped cilantro--with the cottage cheese mix you can use less grated cheddar and so healthier too

This was an amazing recipe!!  A huge hit with my roommate and I was very surprised how easy and downright yummy it was!  Perfect comfort food for a chilly evening. Even better the next day for breakfast!  The only thing I did differently was omit the salt from the cheese mixture as I find the cheese, chicken and taco seasoning packets plenty salty in combination, and I used flour tortillas rather than corn.  I will definitly make this recipe again!

Five Stars for being pretty easy to make, healthy, and delicious. I used the red enchilada sauce recipe from this site. These can be made with whole wheat wraps and low fat cottage cheese and sour cream. It filled three very large tortillas. I would make these again. Thanks.

I was hesitant because my husband can't stand cottage cheese but it turned out delicious and he never noticed (and I never told!).  I accidentally grabbed the large flour tortillas so the recipe made 4 HUGE enchiladas.  Next time I'll grab the smaller ones.  

Great recipe though!  Thanks!

These were EXCELLENT!! I doubled the recipe so as to feed our 6 kids and the 2 friends they invited over for dinner.  I used Mrs Espy's Enchilada Sauces, also from this site. I used flour tortillas instead of corn (easier to handle) and painted each tortilla with sauce before adding the chicken/cheese mixture.  I served this with rice, black beans, guacamole and sour cream.  The sauce was a bit spicy for the kids but the guacamole and sour cream toned it down for them.  My husband said not to change a thing with this recipe. I will definately make this again and again and again!!!

Very tasty recipe! I have never cooked with cottage cheese before; was surprised that it tasted that good! My 5 year old son came running into the kitchen to find out what that yummy smell was and could not wait to try them! The only thing I changed was that I made it casserole style (layered) in a 9x13 pan and used a little more enchilada sauce!  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  Made exactly as recipe states except I used flour tortillas as I couldn't get corn tortillas here.  Made a large amount, but they were so good that I didn't mind eating them for 2 dinners and a lunch!  Nice creamy texture with just the right amount of zing!

This is a great mexican dish. Everyone goes for seconds...I always bump up spices a notch or two, and added mushrooms. Make sure you have pelnty of red sauce, nice to have a little to pour over after they cook. Thanks for this one!

Amazingly delicious!!  So incredibly light and fluffy and tasty! Here are my comments on how I would change it next time. First of all, I put some garlic and onion powder in with the water when boiling the chicken breast for a little kick. Next, as a tip, when I added the taco seasoning and the water (package called for 3/4 cups water) the chicken absorbed it up right away therefor leaving nothing to "boil" as the package says.  So I just mixed it all up and let it simmer for a few minutes instad of bringing it to a boil like the package said (since there was nothing left to boil!). Maybe I should have been using a chicken taco seasoning package, I bought a regular meat seasoning packet. Next, I would mix the sour cream/cottage cheese mix WITH the meat and onions before putting into tortillas. I found after they baked that it separated as I cut into my enchilada on my plate...cottage cheese fell to one side and meat stayed to the other. Not that big of a deal, you can just scoop them back up together, but the idea of seeing baked cottage cheese just sitting on my plate was a bit gross. I am going to try to mix the two together next time. Also, I was able to fill 16 small corn tortillas with meat and they all fit into a 9x13 pan - just in case you need a count or want to ration the meat correctly. Also, I discovered too late that if you microwave the tortillas long enough to where they are piping hot they won't "crack" and rip when you roll them up!  One last thing I

Thank you it's a great recipe. I found that the cottage cheese mix was too much for my taste so I will 1/2 it next time.  Instead of canned red enchilada sauce I used the red enchilada sauce recipe on this site because it is awesome homemade.

This was good, and my husband really enjoyed it, which is a plus!  I made my own taco seasoning from cumin (1 Tbsp), oregano (2 tsp) and chili powder (2 Tbsp) to save on sodium.  Also used flour tortillas and just layered everything in a casserole since everyone said they fall apart anyway.  And they do!  I used a 19oz can of red sauce but I think next time I'll use green.  I just don't like red as much!  Very nice and different meal!

I made this for dinner last night.  I'm usually hesitant to try a recipe on friends that I've never made before--but I received an over-abundance of cottage cheese yesterday, knew my friends (eight in all!) were coming over, and thought, what the heck? So, I made it, and everyone raved over the enchiladas--definitely a "make-again" recipe!

Wonderful! We've made these a number of times, several times for dinner parties and they are always a huge hit. The chicken mixture is delicious. As the recipe is, it ends up being on the spicy side which we love, but you might try it with "medium" enchilada sauce to cool it down a bit. Either way, it's a really great dish, and we've never had left overs.

Oh my gosh is this good! I did use a pre-cooked whole chicken instead and I also added an extra can of enchilada sauce. I layered mine to cut down on time. Drench the tortillas in sauce instead of oil to cut down on fat and I used low fat cottage cheese and low fat sour cream. Taste Great

I absolutely love this recipe.  I get so many compliments every time I make these enchiladas.  I do cheat and use canned chicken instead of fresh, but nobody can tell and it cuts the prep time down to almost nothing.

we loved these! I added a can of black beans to the chicken mixture and layered the ingredients like a lasagna (less time than rolling). We used fat free cottgae cheese, S.C, and 75% less fat cheese. Thanks for this recipe!

Very good, but a few problems.  First, that teaspoon of salt is way too much, especially considering that the taco seasoning is very salty already.  Second, saute the onions before you add the green chilis (which are wet) and the chicken.  Also, I like to bake the chicken then shred it instead of boiling it.  When you do, the liquid is great to add as needed.

Okay...so I made this because I had leftover cottage cheese and sour cream from making Tuna Noodle Casserole.  At first I was skeptical..when it came out of the oven the sauce tasted nothing like the enchilada sauce that I get in the restaurant, and it was REALLY salty. But once it set this was actually pretty good....it reminded me a lot of whatever I'd get in a restaurant.  I think I used whole wheat tortillas and low fat cheese to make it more healthy. Next tiem I am DEFINITELY going to make my own sauce though and maybe taco seasoning because the saltiness was overkill for me.

I did a few changes to the original recipe.  I didn't add onions or peppers to the chicken; substituted 1 cup of cottage cheese with cream cheese (found the texture more creamy); added 2 tsp. lime juice to the cottage cheese mix; I added chopped green onion to the cottage cheese mix; I also added shredded tex-mex cheese to the cottage cheese mix to save time.  Try making the red enchilada sauce on this site instead of using sauce in the can. Excellent idea to add the sauce to bottom of pan. Yummy!

Even though I kinda messed up when preparing these, they still turned out fantastic. It was a nice refreshing change to find a chicken enchilada recipe that had red sauce in it and didn't call for cream of chicken soup, as most of them do.

My mess up? I mixed the monterey jack & cottage cheese. The recipe calls for mixing the cottage cheese and sour cream. Oh well, my mistake. So, I made the best of it and ended up with a cottage cheese/sour cream/monterey jack mixture. This actually ended up making more enchiladas because of my mistake. That's ok, the leftovers were great too.

Because I accidentally put the monterey jack in the mix, I needed another cheese for on top. We topped it with cheddar cheese and sliced olives and everyone loved it.

It's hard to believe that you can't tell there is cottage cheese in the mix, but it's true. Everyone loved this one. Will definitely make again.

This was great!  I made a few modifications.  When I boiled the chicken, I added a cube of chicken boullion to the water.  I used 10 soft taco size tortillas instead of corn.  To simplify filling the tortillas, I fixed the chicken mixture, and stirred in the cottage cheese(after I pureed it in the food processor), sour cream, and half of the jack cheese.  I did not heat the tortillas.  I poured the enchilada sauce on top of the filled tortillas, and then topped with the remaining jack cheese.  Before putting it in the oven, I sprayed a piece of foil with oil spray and covered the enchiladas.  I cooked them for about 40 minutes (I removed the foil for the last 10 min), and let them sit about 10 before serving.  To serve, I topped them with diced onions and cilantro.  I served this with the Mexican Rice II (submitted by Sylvia Eccles) that I altered to suit our taste (see my review).  It was a great meal and perfect for company.

I'm particular when it comes to enchiladas but since I was curious about this recipe, thought I'd give it a try and it turned out pretty good. As with any other enchilada recipe I make, I fried the tortillas in hot oil for a few seconds to soften them (do this and they will be much more flexible and will not tear) and dipped each on in the sauce before filling. I liked the cottage cheese and next time will process it, as someone else mentioned, to get the curds out.

This was really good! I made it last night after much contemplation about the cottage cheese possibly being weird but it was a hit! My picky 10 yr old son and my husband both ate it up! I liked it too and it will be in my recipe box from now on. I followed the recipe for the most part except I only used 1 cup of the cottage cheese not 2 and I blended the Sour Cream and Cottage cheese together in the food processor to make it nice n smooth, then mixed everything all together and put it in the tortillas. I STUFF mine and it was the perfect amount. If you don't stuff yours you will probably have some left over for the top. Also 20 minutes in my electric oven was just perfect to make it all Hot n Bubbly. Try this! you won't notice the cottage cheese and it is really good!

I've made this a few times and it's still my favorite chicken enchilada recipe. I boiled my costco frozen chicken breasts for about 12 minutes and they were so juicy in the enchiladas--perfect (since I usually overcook and turn them to rubber). :)

In an attempt to clear what was in fridge, I subbed Ricotta for Cottage cheese, Ortega hot taco sauce for enchilada sauce, flour for corn tortillas, added some minced garlic, had the most amazing enchiladas I've ever tasted...TRY THEM!

FANTASTIC!! I made a few minor changes prompted by the suggestions of others. I used flour tortillas, added black olives, and subbed ricotta cheese. My husband was in love with this dish, the praise was unrelenting, I loved it. Will definitely make it again, and again. Thank you.

I actually would give this four stars, I enjoyed it.  But I was the only one in my family who did.  I followed the recipe, and decided that next time I might leave off the enchilada sauce (or use much less) because there is already so much flavor in the recipe.  But I probably won't make it again since I'm the only one who liked it. :-(

Excellent idea, very few adjustments made, i.e. garlic, used green chili powder,instead of red and next time will go with ricotta rather than cottage cheese and cut the sour cream, not a big fan only reason.  GOOD!

This was so good. I made this dish one morning. Covered it and put it in the fridge, then popped it in the oven for dinner. Everyone loved it.( Young kids too ! ) I used spinach flour tortillas, and green sauce. I didn't put the extra meat on top either. It seemed like to much. Next time I'll use some garlic too. And I want to try the corn tortillas. But, It was fabulous as it is. Not  one drop left !  Thank You !

yummy!  What a good idea, I've done sour cream enchiladas before, but these are just as good/better and so much more healthy!  I changed the recipe quite a bit because of what I had on hand, olives instead of green chiles, mix of corn and flour tortillas, homemade taco seasoning, layered tortillas instead of rolling into enchiladas... will probably try again and follow recipe.

This was pretty good. I was a little apprehensive about using cottage cheese (not a big fan). It tasted better the next day. I would make it again but perhaps experiment using another cheese that melts better.

My husband absolutely loved this dish! Only thing I did differently was I used flour rather than corn tortillas, as we don't like the corn. He said I can make that dish as often as I like!! :):)

This was a very good dish. Next time I will add more chicken. I was afraid to put in the cottage cheese thinking my family would gross out so, I put the cottage cheese in food processor and blended so it looked like ricotta cheese.

These are very tasty however they fell apart a bit once it was time to plate them. The prepared chicken filling alone would be excellent in tacos! Make the extra prep work worth your time and double the recipe - these freeze very well and are a quick after work dinner solution. Photo available on my profile page.

This recipe was good.  We followed the instructions except making half the filling with veggie chicken.  Even though we are not cottage cheese fans we still liked this.  However, we liked some of the other enchilada recipes that we have tried on this site better and will use those in the future.

Good, but I will deffinately make my own enchilada sauce next time. The canned just doesn't compare. Everything else about it was good. I didn't use the taco seasoning packet, I seasoned it myself and I also used a whole broiler chicken shredded.

Not as impressive as the reviews have stated.  I followed the recipe exactly - to try it out, and although my long suffering hubby fought well with the chillies (which I enjoy), even the taste iteself was certainly not as authentic as good mexican homes and restaurants I have sampled. 
 Not a bad idea to use cottage cheese, it was simply not what we expected or what we were looking for so I will continue hunting.  
If I change the recipe too much to my own liking it won't Be THIS recipe!

Wonderful! I made this with the 10-minute Enchilada sauce. I used refried beans, too, but I would use black beans next time, if I had them. My 2 and 4 year olds loved it, too (without sauce). Thanks for the recipe!

This was good - but not to die for!  I prefer other recipes on this site for Chicken enchiladas.  I did however like the addition of the cottage cheese and I am going to try adding that to a different recipe for chicken enhiladas on this site.  I think the difference for me was the enchilada sauce - I think I prefer the soup mixtures that you will find in other recipes here. The meat filling was yummy!  I will use THAT and a different soupy sauce with cheese grated on top.

These were very good...my husband loved them.  I doubled the enchilada sauce, added chopped cilantro to the cheese mixture and used a store bought roasted chicken to save time from cooking the chicken breasts.  My tortillas cracked when I rolled them up and put them in the pan and then fell apart when I was trying to remove them after cooking...I believe I read somewhere if you wet them in the enchilada sauce before rolling them they won't crack...I'll try that next time.

These are good, but I wasnt totally blown away.  My husband liked them and he was raised on Mexican food (not very good Mexican food, but still).  I halved the cheese mixture but made the full amount of meat mixture, and I still thought it could have used another chicken breast. Super easy to make and the results are good.

My husband and I really enjoyed these enchiladas.  Like some others suggested, I made the red enchilada sauce from this site instead of using the prepared kind at the grocery store and it turned out great.  The only thing I didn't take into account was the fact the recipe makes more than what I would have used in the 10oz can so next time I will have to cut back on the red sauce. I thought the cottage cheese/sour cream mixture was great INSIDE the enchiladas but I felt it was a bit much with the left over on top as well.  I'll just get rid of any extra next time around.  Other than that, I thought the recipe was perfect.  I served the enchilladas on a bed of shredded iceburg lettuce and my husband wound up scooping all the stuff left behind in the baking dish with tortilla chips!  I tasted it and thought the meat and cheese mixtures, along with the enchilada sauce would make a fantastic dip :)

I've been searching for a "perfect" chicken enchilada recipe for a long time and this comes really close!  I really liked that it didn't use cream of chicken soup, but did use enchilada sauce. Was even a hit for my toddlers.  I also cooked it for about 40 minutes so the cheese on top would be crispy. Great topped with shredded lettuce and salsa.Yummy!

Another winner. I stuffed them even more generously and used Mission's flour-corn tortilla blend. Corn taste with flour flexibility - no tortilla warming. Made enough for dinner tonight plus one meal to freeze.

We are very picky about our mexican food choices, but this one was AWESOME! My hub told me to triple star it! We switched the red enchilada sauce with salsa verde and cooked the chicken in that as well (instead of the taco seasoning) which we liked better. We also used flour tortillas which had a better taste with the "green enchilada" route we went in.

These were good but not great.  Filling was a bit too bland for our taste.  I have had much better results with other recipes and don't plan on making these again. I did like the cottage cheese addition though and may adapt other recipes using it instead.   But please whatever you do, never use canned sauce!  It is soooooooo easy to make homemade sauce and it has a much bolder richer flavor than canned.  Homemade sauce is too easy to make yourself with ten times the results!!!!

This recipe was extremley good and tasty.  I worked hard on them and was very dissapointed that they fell apart during cooking.  I will definately try flour tortillas next time instead of the corn tortillas.  Beware if you do not like hot stuff because this one will come out hot.  Great taste though.

This is very good but needs a little extra chicken for my taste.  A mexican friend says to try it with salsa verde instead of red enchilada sauce.

Definitely a man pleaser. I even completely forgot to add the taco seasoning, and it was uber-tasty. 
I didn't think that the prep was too much, but there definitely could have been more enchilada sauce for my taste. (Perhaps 1.5 cans?)

Excellent.  Was a bit wary about using the cottage cheese but these were a big hit.

These were the best enchiladas I've ever made!  I used Mrs. Espys Enchilada sauce from this site and YUMMY!  The only change I made was that I didn't use the chilis, I don't like them.

I made this for dinner tonight. We really liked the flavor, but the enchiladas came out very soft. I used fatfree cottage cheese, lowfat sour cream, and white corn tortilas. I did use less monterey jack cheese because we don't like too much cheese. I used about 1 1/2 cups instead of 2.

When I tried to serve the enchiladas, they fell apart and I noticed there was liquid at the bottom of the pan. I cooked the chicken mix until totally dry, so I can only assume the liquid was from the cottage cheese. I make another similar enchilada recipe (without cottage cheese) and always use white corn tortillas with no problem, so I think it's the cottage cheese. Next time, I am going to try putting the cottage cheese in a cheesecloth and squeeze the liquid out before using. I think that will help keep the enchiladas firmer. 

Overall, we did like the flavor -- not heavy or overly rich at all. I will make these again but will drain the cottage cheese and maybe try yellow corn tortillas.

I've been making this for years. These are now my enchiladas. To make thing super quick and easy:
1. Use a store bought cooked whole chicken and shred.
2. Put shredded chicken in skillet and saute with onion, chiles, taco seasoning, and 1/2 small can of diced jalapenos.
3. Add the Cheese Mixture
4. Layer as followed: Enchilada Sauce, Tortillas, Chicken Mix, Shredded Jack Cheese, Tortillas, and repeat if necessary and top with Enchilada Sauce and Jack Cheese. Bake as directed.
Easy and Delicious. 10 stars.

These were very tasty.  They fell apart easily after they were cooked so they didn't have a great presentation.  I have a lot of filling left over and I used 10 6" tortillas, so I may halve the filling recipe next time.

This gets three stars for ease and edibility.  However, the flavor is heavy yet lacking.  If your looking for an outstanding enchilada you've got to try Gerry's chicken enchiladas.  (this site) More work involved, but much much tastier!

This is a great dinner!  I was intrigued by the inclusion of cottage cheese....but just had a feeling that it would be tasty and was absolutely right.  Not one morsel left.  Could of used a little less shredded cheese on it...but that is just me!  No complaints.

I really enjoyed this dish and was quite surprised how the cottage and cream cheese flavors blended so well.  My only complaint is mine ended up looking like a big sloppy mess, but it still tasted wonderful :o).  I used corn tortillas as called for since I can't imagine using flour in an enchilada dish.  Maybe I will cut down the amount of the cheese mixture for the topping next time.  I used Anna Marie's Enchilada sauce (most excellent!) versus canned.  For the cooked chicken, I boiled chicken breasts in some broth with several fresh springs of cilantro.

Fabulous recipe! Absolutely wonderful!  My husband couldn't get enough of these.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but used flour fajita size tortillas and added a can of chopped olives to the meat mixture.  These will become a regular around our house!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome...I however thought we had cottage cheese in the fridge when I was making this but it wasn't there. So I did not make the name sake I guess. I pored a little enchilada sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking and to keep them rolled. The filling tastes great. Since we did not have the cottage cheese I spread a little sour cream in each enchilada, filled with meat and cheese. I poured on the rest of the enchilada suace on top and then spread the remainder of sour cream and topped with cheese. It came out perfect. My family loved it. Will make again.

These are awesome enchiladas!  I was hesitant because the cottage cheese sounded very strange, but to my surprise they were wonderful.  I used light cottage cheese & sour cream and flour tortillas instead of corn.  I dipped the tortillas instead of pouring the sauce on after.  These are definitely a keeper!  Thanks Crystal!

This recipe was fantastic! I had way too much of the cheese mixture left-over at the end but that's alright. It was even better tasting the second day. The flavors are terrific together and even my picky 6 year old asked for seconds. I made it with Spanish rice and cornbread. This will definitely become a staple meal in my house. Thanks for the great recipe Crystal!

Everyone I've made this for has asked for the recipe, without fail.  My grandmother, the picky 11 year old next door and many other people. A real keeper.

Loved this recipe!  Since I wasn't too successful in my attempt to roll enchiladas, I just layered the tortillas like a regular lasagna, but it still came out yummy.

Love them!!!  I don't use the enchilada sauce (never could find it in the store), and these are just wonderful.  We just top with salsa and sourcream and devour!

We only used 1 teaspoon chili powder and it was still too spicy for my husband. I have to admit it had a slight kick, but still a nice flavor. Maybe I did something wrong but I thought they turned out looking like a goopy mess. I made these for another family and they said they were wonderful. She kept raving and raving so I don't think she was just being nice. Personally, I will keep looking for the perfect enchilada recipe because this just wasn't it for us.

I made this for your company's Halloween potluck, and I had several people ask me for the recipe. Very tasty, I used a spicier cheese rather than the Monterey Jack,and green sauce instead of the red.

These were melt in your mouth good. Easy to make, and worth the effort involved.  I will make these again.  I didnt have red enchilada sauce so I used the green sauce instead, and they were so good.

My husband loved this! Instead of using the taco seasoning I just bought a bigger can of enchilada sauce and mixed part in with the chicken, then poured the rest on top of the finished enchiladas.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of monterey jack because I had it on hand.  It was great!

This recipe is good.  I followed the recipe exactly I thought but then realized I had used ricotta cheese instead or cottage cheese and it still turned out great.  I will make this again and this time, with the cottage cheese.

Loved this recipe.  Although I did make some changes.  I used fajita seasoning.  I did not add green chilies. I used Mozzarella cheese and flour tortillas.  I can honestly say that these are the BEST chicken enchilidas I have ever made.  The red enchilida sauce I used came from this website.  It was great with it.

I was skeptical about the cottage cheese but it turned out great, even w/o the peppers. I also just mixed the whole thing in the pan, which made it easier to fill the tortillas.  I will be making this often.

This was great!  My family doesn't like corn tortillas so I used flour.  They were a little soft, you just need to be careful removing from the baking dish.  This is a definite keeper!

We really liked this recipe; it was great for two people to make and most of the ingredients were on hand.  The cottage cheese was good with it, and it was not difficult to put together at all, despite what the description said - much easier, actually than other enchiladas I made in the past.  Warming the tortillas for 20 seconds in the micro worked well.

This is an awesome recipe.  I only used 1/2 of the green chile peppers and that was enough.  Also for the people that said the tortillas were too soft, I think they used flour because mine were perfect.

I dipped the corn tortillas in the enchilada sauce before putting in the filling, and then spread the remainder on top.  I also topped the enchiladas with green onions and sliced olives.  They tasted great!

This is such a great recipe.  I make it with low fat sour cream and low fat cottage cheese and it still tastes like it comes straight out of a mexican restaurant.  I cut the chilis in half so that my kids would eat it and it was still great.

I am surprised that my family liked them so much.  I didn‚Äôt read the recipe as carefully as I should have so I made some changes inadvertently.  I used only have the liquid in the taco seasoning for the chicken (I used chicken thighs I had pressure cooked, and the liquid was the stock from the cooking).  I ended up just mixing the cheese and chicken together and then adding that all at once to the tortilla and rolling.  The recipe made a lot, my family of four got three full meals out of it.  My husband said he would have liked more sauce, so next time I would use two cans, or make my own.

These are wonderful!! I added some left over chopped green and red bell peppers and only used about half the taco seasoning. For the amount of chicken I used 1 large chicken breast and it made 12 enchiladas. Used two cans of red enchilada sauce.

My family likes this recipe a lot.  A family member has a severe gluten allergy.  I made it gluten-free by using my own homemade enchilada sauce, omitting the taco seasoning, used Daisy brand sour cream and cottage cheese, La Preferida gluten free diced chilis, and I shredded a block of colby cheese.  I spread a thin layer of the enchilada sauce on the outside of the  tortilla before filling it.  This keeps the tortilla moist, with no hard spots from baking.  It can be a little messy, but the kids like to help.  :)

These are AMAZING!!! I put the green Chile‚Äôs in with the cheese and added 1tsp of ground cumin to the mix. Used sharp cheddar instead of Monterey Jack. The enchiladas turned out creamy and tasteful. Yum.

I'm watching my diet right now so I used 2 percent greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I made sure not to overcook the chicken when boiling because when you fold it into the onion and chili mixture you can cook a bit more. I also did not stuff and fold each tortilla...I do it the lazy way and layer the tortillas and place the filling and then repeat...  Only placed a bit of cheese on the top and broiled the enchiladas after baking for 25 mins. It was VERY good!

It was pretty good, but I would skip adding salt to the cheese mixture because the family felt it was overall a bit too salty.  I also had to make twice the enchilada sauce.  Tip - dip your tortillas in the sauce before filling.

These were a lot of work.   Used cheddar in place of
Monterey Jack cheese.  Otherwise followed recipe.
Mine came out drier than I would have liked.

I used rotisserie chicken which made this recipe nice & easy. I also poured a thin layer of sauce into the the bottom of the dish to prevent sticking and add more flavor to the bottom of the enchiladas. Swapped the cheddar cheese for Mexican 4 cheese blend. All great tweaks!

Great meal! I followed the directions except for the chopped green chilis, it didn't way drained or not drained, so I didn't drain them. This turned out absolutely wonderful and will make a great left over dinner in a couple of days!

Made some minor adjustments based on what I had. Also baked without sauce before continued baking with sauce as we aren't fond of over-soggy soft shells. I really liked the cottage cheese twist, wife thought it was awesome too! Will definitely add to our meal rotation.

I made how it said with what I had on hand. I had green enchilada sauce instead of red, mild cheddar, and I used no flavor Greek yogurt instead of sour cream (because I didn‚Äôt want to go to the store). I added black olives and corn. It was delicious! Little kick of heat but amazing over all.

It turned out amazing!  I used FF SC and FF CC, along with Taco Bell seasoning.  It was a bit of prep, but well worth it.  Tons of chicken and cheese left over to top them, and gave my son some chicken too.  I'll definitely be making these again!

Family really liked this.  I did make some changes to make it  go further.  I made my own enchilada sauce with chocolate added. I then layered the corn tortillas with the sauce, the cottage cheese and Mexican cheese in a 9x13 casserole dish, baked at 350* until bubbling.  Excellent dish!! I normally do not change someone's  recipe until I have made it as written, (if I need to add or subtract something) but....I needed to increase the amount at the last minute and needed to change it to fit.  Thanks for such a great recipe Annabell !!!

I loved this recipe ! I made it in the 'layers' formula  for a large crowd and it turned out great ! I recommend double on the corn tortillas for extra firmness ! One you could easily mix/mash up with corn, black beans, rice layer. I made as per recipe and it was great

Very good! I used rotisserie chicken to make it even easier.

Ooops turned out great! - 2 changes:  I roasted the chicken-(salt, pepper, drizzle of oil), and, because I didn't want to run to store again to buy tortillas I made it as a layered casserole using a bag of thick corn tortilla chips instead. We all decided it was better than flour tortillas and a LOT faster. The cottage cheese gives this 'body' and makes it seem lighter...(Great enchilada sauce makes all the difference and homemade is easy - I tried Texas Enchilada Sauce on this site and it was very good).

The only thing I did different than listed recipe was use faux beef crumbles instead of chicken and it turned out delicious! Since hubby and I are vegetarians we typically only get to have cheese enchiladas at restaurants, so this recipe was a real treat and huge hit in our house! Definitely will be making again.

It tasted fine, but it really needed rice in it, I think. Something heavier, as it felt kinda empty.

This was my first attempt making Enchiladas and the recipe was very easy to follow. I made the recipe as presented with no changes. Living alone a ate a healthy portion the first night and froze the rest for future dinners. Absolutely loved it and will make it again.

This dish is delicious! I'm giving it four stars as the prep time is longer than 30 minutes. I actually cooked the chicken the day before as I like to use bone-in chicken breasts with skins as they have more flavor. Then I shred the chicken and have that chore out of the way for the next day when it's time to put everything together.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion by dipping each tortilla in the enchilada sauce, so I ended up using two whole cans of the sauce. The recipe rendered 14 tortillas, so I took one full pan and packaged each enchilada separately for the freezer. It makes it easy on those week nights when you can pull one or two out of the freezer. Also, I like this recipe with both corn and flour tortillas.

I made this for dinner Friday for my husband and myself. I have tried lasagna with cottage cheese instead of ricotta, but I've never tried it with Mexican food. The only changes I made were chicken thighs instead of breast, and homemade taco seasoning mix instead of store-bought. Because just the two of us were eating, I divided the meat and cheese mixtures and we had the remainder on Saturday night. We both absolutely loved it!

This was very tasty. However, there is cottage cheese and there is cottage cheese. Mine was too creamy.  A drier cottage cheese would be better.  This was soupy and I didn't even use all the cottage cheese,

Wow. So delicious!  Although my husband wondered if the cheese was curtled when it first came out of the oven. When I told him it was cottage cheese,  he wasn't so sure at first,  but after he had a bite he was in Heaven! We later invited his friend over to eat some enchiladas too. The friend loved it!  Fantastic recipe.

Loved this!  My husband exclaimed that it was better than restaurant enchiladas.  I did make a few changes but only a few.
-I used canned chicken and shredded it as it cooked 
-less than 1/2 cup of onion
-added garlic paste to onions as I saut√©ed them(before adding the chicken)
-I used uncooked small flour tortillas in place of the corn tortillas..
-Used more than recommended enchilada sauce(I spread a thin layer of sauce on bottom of pan which helped keep the tortillas moist)

First time ever making enchiladas! These were fabulous and hubby loved them too. Didn't use taco mix because of salt so used cumin, New Mexico chili powder, oregano and garlic. I drained the cottage cheese as someone else suggested and used burrito size flour tortillas. Also sauced the bottom of the pan and smeared refried beans on the tortillas before adding chicken/cheese mixture. Because I used 1 pound of shredded rotisserie chicken I got 8 large enchiladas and I also made a 9 x 9 pan layered like a lasagna which I froze. These were so good and not rich at all!  Also used Mrs. Espy's Enchilada Sauce from this site. Will put this in the rotation.

I've made this twice with great success both times. It's easy, forgiving, and oh so delicious. 

Because we're lazy, we used a pre-seasoned shredded chicken the first time and pre-cooked fajita chicken strips, cut, the second time around. Shredded is better, but this recipe is pretty forgiving! At my boyfriend's insistence, we used an authentic Mexican sour cream both times. It's very good, but I don't know if it adds more personally. (The boyfriend would disagree.) The second time, we used large curd cottage cheese. I would stick with the smaller one if available, but large was fine. Finally, we doubled the recipe.

We stuffed ourselves silly the first time around, but you get full quick! The second time was for my boyfriend's parents, who both inhaled theirs and kept praising it, so looks like it was a complete success!!

These were delicious.  I pureed the cottage cheese in the food processor to make it smooth before putting it in the enchiladas - I'm not a fan of the texture of cottage cheese but like the taste.  Could have used more enchilada sauce and more cheese (but I like mine that way).

I must admit this is the BEST enchilada recipe on this site (and I've tried many, many variations)! I did take the advice of another and used rotisserie chicken from my grocer's deli. Honestly, this was fantastic because I had enough left for chicken salad and the price was the same as if I bought chicken and boiled/shredded myself.

It's ok.  Don't expect it to taste like authentic Mexican food. It reminds me of the Mexican chicken casserole in the 1980s/1990s where people layered chicken with Doritos.

Making this again for dinner tonight because it was just so dang GOOD the first time. I used a combination of Monterrey Jack, Cheddar, and Mozzarella because that's what I had on hand and it tasted great. I also added more enchilada sauce and another chicken breast. Definitely recommend this recipe!

I love enchiladas, but cooking chicken three times (boiling, saut√©ing, baking) is overkill. No wonder they have to be enveloped in various moist ingredients and then (judging by the photos) be paved over with cheese!

Good alternative to the norm. I would suggest if you use flour tortillas, put em in a pan on the oven to draw out some of the moisture... otherwise they can get gummy

I'd give it more stars if I could! I can't believe how good this was. I even used flour tortillas instead of corn. This would be great for guests. I missed the part where it said to use the remaining mixture on top and I ended up with overflowing enchiladas, which was not at all a bad thing!

I prepared these exactly from the recipe with the exception of using additional enchilada sauce because I like the flavor. I did not enjoy the cottage cheese filling with the meat and shredded cheese, and would omit this and just add the shredded cheese and chicken if I prepared this again.

This was a huge hit with my family!!!!  I left out the peppers because I wasn't sure if it would make the dish spicy. My children (although they are teenagers) will not eat anything hot. I added black beans.....I put them in while sauteing the onions. Other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great!! It was very easy. My son asked for it again tomorrow. Thanks for sharing!

This is an exceptional dish. Wonderful flavor. I never would have thought about using cottage cheese in a Mexican dish.
If you're using chicken breasts from Costco, which are much larger that the typical ones you get in the supermarket, I found I needed to increase the amount of green chilies, onion, and enchilada sauce.
My only complaint is with the prep time on the recipe. If you buy already chopped onions, already shredded cheese, already cooked and pulled chicken, then just maybe you can do prep in about 30-minutes. But if you're cooking fresh, like I typically do, expect prep to take 1-1.5 hours.

Much better than I expected. The cheese mixture, chicken and cheese inside. All melded together , like how a quiche combines. Was incredible! It made 9. I used 1 pound chicken breast. When boiling I season water,, onion slices, salt pepper, a pat of butter  and I put a few dried mild chilis in for flavor. I have been  sharing with EVERYONE!!!! This will become a staple. My Mexican friend loved it. ( I used La Preferrida brand sauce: 1 can mild one hot mixedt together)

I cooked the chicken in a electric Pressure cooker using a cup of chicken broth and a half cup of salsa, This infused the chicken with the flavor of the salsa and made it very tasty, tender and moist. I used the Taco seasoning made from a recipe I found on AllRecipes. Did not have corn Tortillas used Flour Tortillas instead. I can of red Enchilada sauce is not enough used 2 cans. Also used shredded Mexican 4 Cheese blend. These were best Chicken Enchiladas we have ever had, KEEPER ALERT !

Very easy recipe to make. I used a whole garlic seasoned chicken from the Deli and shredded it. I added probably twice the shredded cheese. It was a hit. Everyone liked it.

I made this, for the most part, true to the directions but made my own enchilada sauce (Easy Enchilada Sauce from allrecipes) since I didn't have the canned and also just used a package of chicken tenders, boiled and shredded. I cut down on the chili powder slightly to lessen the heat.  It was delicious and tasted authentic. It had a nice appearance too.

Great recipe! It would be great as written. I used a big can (28 oz I believe) of enchilada sauce, and added some chopped bell peppers and garlic to the meat mixture just because I had a few things to use up. These turned out so great and made a lot, which I love because I can take them to work for lunch. Excellent recipe! I'll definitely make these again and again!

I didn't have any peppers in it, Campbell's soups for easy cooking - Mexican Style Tomato instead of enchilada sauce, and I used and I used half flour/half corn tortillas. For my first time to ever make enchiladas this was a great recipe!

Very good :) I only used one can of chilis since my family is a bit on the weenie side when it comes to heat. I mixed the shredded cheese in with the cottage cheese/sour cream mix.  I also just used rotisserie chicken to speed things along as well as flour instead of corn tortillas. Will definitely make again :)

I've been making this recipe for years now.  It's a family favorite and a go-to for taking to new moms or other families  I'm cooking for.   Everyone loves it. 
I use half a shredded rotisserie to make it quicker sometimes

Made a few substitutions (no green chilis in stock) but husband and friends liked the finished dish.  Will make it again with more of own variations.

Good flavor!  Used 2 drained 10 oz. cans of chicken.  Followed the recipe with a few exceptions:  I only used 1/2 package of taco mix.  Added some chopped cilantro to the cottage cheese mix, only a light sprinkling of salt and pepper. and 1 c. of the shredded cheese.  Also sliced up a 1/2 can of olives.  Part for the cottage mix and part to go on top before putting in the oven.  I used Colby-Jack since that's what I had.  After the meat mixture cooled, added to the cottage mix.  Mixing everything into one big bowl made assembly easy and clean-up too.  I briefly fried the corn tortillas because I feel it helps to make a less mushy enchilada.  Substituted Red Chili Colorado sauce for the enchilada sauce because that's what I prefer and stirred in an undiluted 10.75 oz. can of cream of chicken soup into the sauce to lighten up the spiciness.  My sister-in-law does that to make it kid friendly and I prefer it too.  Still plenty spicy and per others recommendations needed extra sauce anyway.  Used a 1/4 c. measure of filling for each tortilla; easier to assemble and all the same size.   Baked in the same 12 inch skillet used to saute the meat mixture.  Had enough leftover filling for about 6 more enchiladas to make later.  Topped with rest of olives and cheese plus additional 1/2 c. shredded cheese.  Prior to serving topped with chopped raw onion and green onion.  My new enchilada recipe--not too wet, not too dry. Might try 1 c. cottage cheese next time to see if any difference.

Very good!  Used flour tortillas and Trader Joe's enchilada sauce.  Used three chicken breasts and had enough for two dishes.  The kids liked it and the husband had seconds and thirds!  Will definitely make again!

They were ok, I'm really not sure how I feel about the cottage cheese, I think I would use less next time and more shredded cheese.

I made this tonight for my daughter and son in law. they loved it.
they dont usually eat corn tortillas but the sauce and cheese make it wonderful. Next time if i use corn tortillas I will do as another reader, and layer it. It turns in a big mess anyway.  served it with the easy spanish rice. Delicias

I made it vegetarian. Like many others I was not sure cottage cheese would be good in enchiladas., but our local Mexican restaurant just raised their prices so high that I just had to try and make our favorite meal.  WOW these were terrific!  The only thing I did differently was that I used grilled corn instead of the meat.  Now my daughter wants this every day!

This was to die for. My inlaws think I'm a star. My family raves. So easy.
The only changes I made: poached, skinless, boneless chicken thighs in chicken broth for 30 minutes. I used a small (6oz?) can of diced chilis, drained.  The third time I made, I added steamed spinach and mushrooms for extra flavor layers. Top with fresh avocado. Maybe next time add a minced poblano chili, instead of canned... FLAT OUT YUM!

This recipe tasted AWESOME.. the whole fam liked it..and trust me, they are a hard crowd to please. My one son does not like cottage cheese, but he had two helpings, and my husband didn't even know about the sour cream which he claims to hate. The only thing that I changed was I used a smaller can of green chiles because I cant eat real spicy foods..Im glad I used the small because it was pretty spicy..if I had used the large can I wouldn't have been able to eat it. Thanks for sharing!!!

We enjoyed this dish and it was pretty easy to make. I used ground turkey because that's what I had on hand, but I think it might be a little better with the chicken as the recipe suggests or ground beef.

This was delicious and it has become an instant family favorite!  I made it as written.  I worried that there would not be enough sauce, but it was actually perfect!Used corn tortillas and it made 10 enchiladas.  I had a good bit of the cheese mixture left, and I did not top the enchiladas with it.  Covered the top with shredded Monterey Jack cheese. Delicious!

I made it almost exactly as written except I didn't understand the meat part when it said to make as per pkg instruction.( I can't imagine adding 3/4 cup of water as the taco seasoning packet says.) I just added the taco packet  (no water) to the chicken and peppers/onions. It was perfect.  I tend to load up on meat and cheese so I only used a 7x11 pan and made 6 big enchiladas . Fabulous recipe! Will def make again.

I made two batches, one with red sauce and one with green enchilada sauce. The cottage cheese keeps the enchiladas from tasting dried out. Tried using  some Quesera cheese on top. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum, this was delicious. It really wasn't that time consuming, as suggested, as I just used about 2 1/2 cups of leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I like how these were soft and sort of crispy instead of oily like the tortillas they dip in oil first at restaurants. I just briefly microwaved a pack of tortillas to make these. 12 does fill a 13x9 disposable pan which I used. I just sprayed it with a little PAM spray. I realized I forgot to buy the green chili peppers in a can. So, I subbed 1 cup of Herdez salsa verde which I did have. I sauteed the onions in a spoon of oil until slightly soft, then stirred in the chicken, salsa verde, low-sodium taco seasoning, and added about 2 pinches each of garlic and onion powder and a dash of black pepper. Then just stirred the chicken until heated well. For the cheese mixture I used Kraft reduced fat sour cream and 4% fat Kraft large curd cottage cheese and cut the salt amount in half. I only had colby jack cheese cubes so I chopped them and used that. I had a little bit of  meat, cottage cheese mixture, and colby jack left which I put on top as suggested. The small can of sauce, on the top, also worked fine. I almost forgot putting it in the oven. It baked for about 48 minutes, uncovered, and it was perfect. ty

This is amazing as is but I accidentally mixed the enchilada sauce into the chicken mixture and improvised. Instead of rolling all of the enchilada I did individual servings in bowls, layering tortilla, chicken mixture, cottage cheese, shredded cheese a few times and they came out perfect! No oven time, baking dish to wash or time spent rolling the enchiladas. Saved probably 20-30 minutes and came out just as good! :)

This is my family's all time fav enchilada recipe!  My baby daughter is having her 21st birthday party this Sat. & she requested this for dinner.  The only thing I change is to make it easier for me.  I use a rotisserie chicken & I mix the chicken & cheese mixture together  before assembling enchiladas.  I've found when making enchiladas with corn torts, the best way to stop cracking is to cook briefly in hot oil & then dip in enchilada sauce.  Then fill & roll.  Thank you for this great recipe!

Used this as the basis for my variation and it was a big hit!  Loved the idea of using cottage cheese since I had some I wanted to use....mixed about a cup of cottage cheese with about 1/2 cup sour cream, about 1/3 cup diced green onions and one jalapeno, diced...placed about 1/4 c. mixture on a corn tortilla, then added about 1/3 c. pulled pork and topped with about 2 tbsp. grated cheddar cheese...rolled it up and placed it in a pan that had been oiled and coated with enchilada sauce.  Made 6 to fill the pan and poured the remaining sauce over the enchiladas then sprinkled about 1/2 c. cheddar over middle of pan and baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  Drizzled some leftover jalapeno queso sauce over the top and served with refried beans....mmmmm, mmmm, good.

Only four stars because I modified it. Five star recipe. I only used half of the cottage cheese required because I only had half of the sour cream. It was still too much cottage cheese.
It is a spicy dish! Must be the green chilies. However, I served it with cilantro/lime rice and shredded lettuce. The combination was wonderful! A keeper for me.

Made this exactly as the recipe was written, except I boiled my chicken and shredded it instead of cooking it in a pan. Once it was shredded then I added it to the pan with the browned onions and green chiles and continued with the recipe. I wish these had a little bit more cheese inside of the enchilada, but still a pretty good recipe. I needed 1 1/2 cans of enchilada sauce to cover the enchiladas, so next time I will add 1/2 can of enchilada sauce to the chicken, onion mixture. Not bad though.

used 1 bag (maybe 1 and 1/2) of pre cooked chicken and mixed flour and corn tortillas, if we halved the recipe for just our family we definitely wouldn't need more than 1 bag.  Used 2 cans of enchilada sauce for whole recipe

This recipe is a keeper! I did not boil chicken. I chopped the chicken into bite sized pieces and browned on the skillet with olive oil, 2 cloves of minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Then I seasoned with taco seasoning and added water and green chilies. So yummy!

One of the best things I've eaten in awhile! Skipped a lot of the fuss due to a lack of ingredients, and it was still awesome! Made homemade enchilada sauce, and layered ingredients like a lasagna instead of rolling up. Just layered the following in a pie plate: sauce, flour tortilla (medium/fajita size), half of the cottage cheese/sourcream mixture, plain shredded chicken, repeat, top with another tortilla and more sauce. Only put shredded cheese on top. Baked for about 20 minutes. Even with that simplified version, it was AWESOME!

I used 3c precooked chicken, 4oz can chiles, a pound of (fullfat) cottage cheese (which is about 2c), 1T taco seasoning - along with the listed amounts of half cup onion & sour cream, but reduced salt to 1/2t as suggested in reviews.  Even with half t, the cottage cheese mixture (I combined almost all the shredded with the cottage) was still salty; but not in the enchiladas after baking.  I used about two spoonfuls of the chicken & the cheese mixture in each.  A little rice or beans or even more of that would've been good; or fewer enchiladas.  I only had reheated leftovers, but it was pretty good.  I'll probably make again sometime, different than usual.  Oh, I'd add more onion & two cans of chiles.  I don't see even adding the additional can would make this spicy - even mildly spicy - so if you're going for any heat, you'll have to add it elsewhere.

A little bland. I expected more flavor. Add more spice to kick it up a notch without making it hot.

This was a very good enchilada recipe, and it was easy to make.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to at least double the red sauce as one can is no where near enough.

Here's my easy variation on this recipe:
1)  cook boneless, skinless chicken in the crockpot. 2) layer cottage cheese, refried beans and chicken into tortillas. 3) spread a thin layer of sweet Creek enchilada sauce in bottom of pan. 4)  please filled enchiladas into pan 5) top with additional chicken, cheddar cheese, and rest of enchilada sauce. 6) bake covered in tinfoil. Enjoy!

I think I will stick with chimichangas.  I did not like how the tortillas turned out so soggy in the end.  Maybe I did something wrong, what a big mess!  If I tried again I might bake them without sauce then add it after.

I stumbled onto the way this becomes a killer five star recipe.  The store was out of enchilada sauce, so I searched this site for a recipe.  The "Ten Minute" recipe for sauce sounded perfect.  The enchilada recipe coupled with home made sauce that literally is done in ten minutes is possibly the best enchilada recipe ever.  The standout flavor of homemade sauce adds an element that is ridiculously good.

Made this for a catering job which was a huge risk because I never made them before. I used flour tortillas and did as others suggested and baked them 15 mins before adding sauce and cheese.  I wiped the tortillas in sauce to make them easier to use, did not heat them. I did my chicken with the sauce in the slow cooker so no shredding required as the slow cooker does that for you.  Topped with some green onion.  Fantastic!

I made these for my family who like enchiladas a lot more than I do, they were quite a bit of work but that's probably because I made my own enchilada sauce and taco seasoning mix (from a recipe on this site).  The changes I made were I used dried chipotle powder as I didn't have any chillis on hand, used low carb tortillas instead of corn ones for the same reason (although corn tortillas would have tasted better).  I also got way more than 6 servings out of it.

Fantastic! We used corn tortillas (personal preference) and to save time, a rotisserie chicken.  This recipe was all we hoped it would be! Creamy, cheesy yum! Thank you for submitting this great dish.

Delicious! Really good flavors and textures, especially love the cottage cheese. I topped it with a dollop of sour cream and some Mexican rice - so good!

This is a good recipe. I like cottage cheese so wasn't really worried about that being one of the ingredients in this recipe.Was worried kids wouldn't like this at all,but almost all of my kiddos tried it and liked it.Was alittle soupy,but had a great taste.

This is awesome! The only change I made was to boil the chicken in Mexican tortilla chicken soup broth. Will definitely make again!

This turned out yummy. The cheese mixture is great! I added some chili powder in addition to the salt and pepper it called for. I also cooked my chicken in a skillet with salt and pepper and then shredded it instead of using boiled chicken. And yes, be sure to have extra enchilada sauce on hand in case the tortillas suck up all the sauce!!

My family only had one complaint about these enchiladas--there weren't enough for leftovers! I will not use an enchilada recipe that calls for canned soup or flour tortillas. Of the three I have tried that don't call for those (two from this site and one from another), this was the easiest and at least as good as the others, if not better. I'm not rating on authenticity, just good taste and somewhat quick to make. My corn tortillas were actually too filled to roll, so I just folded them up like a taco and lined them up in the pan. It was easy. I used Dry Taco Seasoning I by Bill Echols, Red Enchilada Sauce by Sara, and served with Guacamole by Bob Cody--a complete Allrecipes meal. I made a few without the chicken in the filling for myself and they were delicious, too. Great recipe! Thank you. P.S. I could eat the enchilada sauce like soup, it is so good!

A lot of the reviews I read were spot on.  To make it easier and better next time I think I'll use a rotisserie chicken, I think it would be easier than boiling it.  I would also user more of the enchilada sauce.  These were not dry however the one little can of sauce was instantly soaked up by the corn tortillas.  Other than this, it was a

My sister just called me and asked me for the recipe that I made for them three years ago...this was the recipe! My brother in law said he had never had such wonderful homemade chicken enchiladas, and he needed me to come over and make them again! Score :) Made them just as the directions indicated and apparently they were memorable ;)So now I will print out this recipe for my sister haha

Wonderful! A huge recipe though...we ate this for three meals in a row before it was all gone. I didn't think it was necessary to use both enchilada sauce and taxi seasoning, so I simply added some tomato sauce to my meat mixture instead of the seasoning and water. So delicious...and by using corn tortillas, this is a gluten-free recipe as well.

My BF made this for me tonight and it was amazing!  I've never enjoyed enchiladas until I tried these.  We are also trying to eat healthy, so made lots of less-bad-for-you substitutions which worked out great in our opinion.  We used fat free cottage cheese, light sour cream, 2% Mexican cheese blend, and eight low-carb 6-inch tortillas.  We poured enough enchilada sauce to cover the bottom of 9x13 inch pan, then rolled up hefty amounts of chicken and cheese mixture in each tortilla, seam side down.  Covered all the tortillas with a lotta enchilada sauce to make sure it was moist, and topped with the whole bag of Mexican blend cheese and sliced black olives.  A very filling meal with plenty of leftovers!  Maybe we'll have those with some chopped green onion on top :)
Thank you for a great, healthy, satisfying recipe!

This was a huge hit! The cottage cheese and sour cream mixture is delightful. I would recommend omitting the salt as it quite salty and double the sauce. I might try to bake for 15 minutes then adding the additional sauce next time for a less soggy dish. Overall, great!

I used cream cheese instead of cottage cheese because that's what I had in the fridge. I mixed the cream cheese with the chicken mixture and it turned out SOOOO good. These are the best i've made so far. I also didn't have taco seasoning, so I seasoned my chicken with Johnny's seasoning salt, garlic salt and cumin. yum.

I just made this recipe last night. My boyfriend and I both loved it. The only thing that I did differently was use a roasted chicken that I bought from the grocery store to save some time, and I used a four cheese blend. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Great comfort food. Leftovers for several days were as good as day one. Used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Labor intensive, so budget plenty of prep time.

Made this recipe using nonfat plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, low fat cottage cheese, and green enchilada sauce instead of red.  The tortillas fell apart for me which may have just been the type, but otherwise it tasted great and was pretty easy after all the prep.  I like baked meals because you can just throw them in the oven, forget, and come back to a fresh hot meal ready to eat.

This was waaayyyyy good! I looked forward to my leftovers the next day for sure! Used flour tortillas (didn't have corn) and used a drained can of Rotel (didn't have a can of green chiles).  Forgot the taco seasoning until the end so I just sprinkled it on top before adding the sauce and it still came out divine! Also made this at 3am (I work nights) and threw it in the oven the next day for lunch. So easy and so good!! I love recipes i can prep ahead of time. Will definitely make again!

I thought the flavor was good, and the cottage cheese ups the protein if you're short on chicken. In CA, we eat a lot of enchiladas so it takes something really special to be a 5* to my way of thinking. I used half flour and half corn tortillas to compare, but feel that the recipe is correct using corn to make traditional enchiladas. On the advice of so many, I doubled the enchilada sauce and was sorry because the tortillas became overly soggy; the corn ones fell apart, but still tasted good, and the flour ones became doughy and unpleasant. I use homemade taco mix, so I can't comment on the saltiness if using packaged. I feel this recipe is a nice 4 star as it stands.

This was so very tasty! I added 2 TBSP of cumin along with low sodium taco seasoning to shredded chicken. I only used 1 cup of 2% Mexican Cheese on the top of the enchilada sauce just to lighten it a bit. I used low fat cottage cheese and low fat sour cream and low carb tortillas -- My whole family loved it!

I'm keeping this at 3 stars because I made a lot of changes to it, but I do have to say after I messed with the recipe the product was delicious! First off, I like my chicken to be very flavorful, so I found a recipe on here for taco seasoning and doubled it, ended up using about 1.5 oz rather than the 1 oz. taco seasoning packet. You likely have all of the ingredients for taco seasoning in your cupboard already. Secondly, I wanted this to be really healthy so I substitute 0% greek yogurt for the sour cream, can't taste a difference IMHO. Third I'm way too lazy to roll enchiladas, and so I always layer this like lasagne in a 9x13 dish - tortillas, meat mixture, cheese mixture, enchilada sauce etc, be sure to put some enchilada sauce on the bottom and cheese on top. 

Finally if you feel like you want to add some vegetables to make this more of a meal, add black beans and corn in with the meat mixture, it's really great that way.

Totally delicious- I added black olives to the meat mixture. I also used light cottage cheese and sour creem. Very simple and healthier than the average enchilada recipe.

Very easy and tasty. I used canned chicken breasts from COSTCO and followed another reviewers suggestion of putting a bit of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and moistening the tortilla with the enchilada sauce before filling. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Would probably be terrific without these tweaks.

My family members aren't big on Mexican food, but I decided to try this recipe anyway since I'm a huge fan. The enchiladas turned out great and they were, surprisingly, a huge hit in the household!

Easy to make, great taste. Used gardein 7 grain vegetarian chicken, half the cheese and all of mrs. Etsy's enchilada sauce (2x the amount the recipe calls for). Everyone loved it! Thanks for the recipe :)

Made this tonight and it was a Winner! I used Las Palmas enchilada red sauce and a roasted chicken from Costco. Two teenagers (male and a female) BIG hit! We got 8 servings, probably because I used more than the equivalent of 2 chicken breasts. Left overs - yum!

I'm not an experienced cook, but this recipe turned out so good! After reading a few reviews, I tweaked it a little. Instead of using canned enchilada sauce I followed Mrs Espy's Enchilada Sauce (also found on this site). It turned out way better than I expected! Another tip, add about 2 cups of shredded monterey jack cheese to the cottage cheese and sour cream filling. It gives it an extra boost! Enjoy!!!!

Also, when the taco seasoning mix pack says to add water, use chicken broth! It adds such an amazing flavor and moustire to the chicken!!!

We love this recipe! We always substitute plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream and it works well. We also have substituted crock pot pork for the chicken which is a nice variation. My husband especially loves and requests this recipe!

This recipe is no good.  While the filling is yummy when you leave out the taco seasoning and do some tweaking with garlic, the enchilada sauce throws everything off.  The combination simply does not work.  You'll notice other reviewers on here have also found this to be true.

Ehhhh, I had high hopes for this. Maybe my brand of enchilada sauce was no good?I like cottage cheese but it just didn't do it for me.  No one in my family of 4 just loved it.  I even made a second to freeze because I was sure it was going to be great.  I'm from Texas and to me nothing compares to Tex-Mex.  This was lacking in flavor and richness.  The cottage cheese/sour cream mixture didn't float my boat.  Eadible but I won't make it again.

I only used the recipe for the cottage cheese stuffing, I used my own jalapeno shredded chicken recipe for the rest. And I used a green enchilada sauce instead of red.

I loved the cottage cheese & sour cream mix, it was very yummy and complimented the chicken.

Excellent recipe that I plan to make again! The ratio of cheese to meat was perfect for me and the flavors melded together to create this mouthwatering, crave worthy meal. In step 1, I sauteed the onions until soft, then added the chicken and chilis and continued with the taco seasoning directions. I was afraid that browning the chicken would make it too dry. When I make it again, I wouldn't need to change a thing, although it went so well with the refried beans I had on the side, I'd consider incorporating refried beans into the enchiladas. Although rolling the enchiladas was easy and not too time consuming, I may layer the ingredients to save a little time on a busy night too.

My family thought it was great!  Even my son and a neighborhood friend liked them. They had a very good flavor to them.  I really doubled the recipe to about 5 chicken breasts and doubled everything but the sauce on the top and the shredded cheese.  I bit soupy so I will cut down on the sour cream and cottage cheese a bit.  Didn't need to double the shredded cheese, I put half in and half on top, you didn't miss the extra. I also combined the cheese mixture with the chicken mixture as recommended by another user. Thought it worked great like that. I actually made 12 in a casserole and had leftovers to layer like lasagna in a smaller
round casserole to have tomorrow.  That was really easy. have to see which way we like better.  But as for taste, the family gave it 5

Made these following the original recipe.  The only thing I do different is to mix the chicken , cheese mixture and shredded cheese together just before I fill the tortillas.  Absolutely yummy!!  When I make it for work, eveyone raves about it and it's gone in the blink of an eye!

I had never eaten enchiladas before and was looking for an easy recipe that I could make at home, and I found it here. I did make a couple of changes, I added some refried beans to the enchiladas, used jalapenos instead of chile peppers in the meat mix and used green enchilada sauce instead of red. I will definitely be making this again! Maybe as soon as next week. (We had tons of leftovers which were delicious the next day for lunch).

5 thumbs up!! I'm picky about my enchilada recipes, and this one was delicious. Perfect blend of chicken and cottage cheese, not too runny or too dry. Really loved the use of red sauce instead of lesser healthy sour cream slathered on top. Was sad when my husband took the leftovers to work!

I made a cassarole instead of Enchiladas but the taste was good. I liked the tang of the sour cream and I didn't even notice the cottage cheese, in a bad way, but it was certainly cheesy rich.

These were REALLY good!  I usually prefer beef to chicken, but these didn't make me miss beef.  I used 3 breast instead of 2 and boiled them with the addition of a onion, jalapeno, & garlic clove to flavor.  I used Mexican spices (chili powder, paprika, and cumin) instead of taco seasoning because that's what I had on hand.  The cottage cheese was great...you don't feel like your eating cottage cheese at all.  I definitely recommend these.

These were very good. Everything blended well together and there were no leftovers, much my disappointment the next day. :) Thank you for sharing. Awesome!

Okay, I made this exactly as stated and I have to say I was very DISAPPOINTED!  The reviews were all very good, but this dish was just okay.  I have a similar recipe(no cottage cheese)  that takes just as much prep and is so much better than this one!!!!  I'll stick with that one.

Awesome recipe!! I made this tonight for dinner. We bought a rotisserie chicken from the super market to save time. It seriously took 6-7 minutes to prep! I took other reviewer advice and put enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan as well as a tiny bit inside to keep them from getting dry/sticking. What a great meal!

Loved this!  The cottage cheese added a whole new dimension to the enchiladas, will definitely make this again.  Did change the recipe a little.  I used canned chicken and cooked with onion, garlic, taco seas, and fresh cilantro.  I also used flour tortillas and fried them before making the enchiladas.

I made these without the red sauce as I really dislike it, and put some green salsa into the sour cream and cottage cheese mixture... literally the best meal I've ever made. Fantastic.

Absolutely amazing!! I cooked this for my mom and my brother who are both VERY picky when it comes to anything different, and they absolutely loved it! I only changed a couple things. I boiled the chicken in water, with black peppercorns, a few chipotles in adobo, salt, garlic, onion, and some corianer seeds. I didn't have any green chilis, so I used a couple chipotles in adobo sauce. I also made the red enchilada sauce from another recipe on this site, and the whole thing turned out wonderfully. Pair it with some Mexican rice, and you've got an amazing meal.

Made this for my Fiancee and he could not stop saying "yum" during the whole meal.  I think the only thing I would do different is assemble it the night before I cook it as the next day it was even more delicious which we didnt think was possible. I served with sour cream and some sweet pineapple along side as a great compliment!!

These were good but needed a little something. I used the taco seasoning recipe from this site. Maybe a more chicken to cheese ratio would work better next time. Also, I used flour tortillas. Will use corn next time.

I absolutely loved these!!!!  Next time, I'll scaled back a bit on the taco seasoning and leave out the salt.  The salt from the cheese and sauce is plenty along with the taco seasoning.  Yummmmmmo!

Very yummy I loved the fact that you add the sour cream and cottage cheese to the chicken for a filling. It was delicious. Only thing I sometimes do differently is prepare the chicken with green bell pepper rather than green jalapenos.

Although these were good, They were a tad on the dry side. I don't think the cottage cheese made any flavorful addition to this dish, or make them have a "lighter texture" If I were to make them again, I would double the sauce, and leave out the cottage cheese.

Came out great!  I did a few changes: I personally prefer flour tortillas, even in enchiladas.  Added corn for a southwest flair.  Mixed the top sauce with sour cream for a more creamy texture.  They were a hit!

This was my first time making enchiladas so I was not sure what to expect.  I followed the directions exactly except I added one more can of enchilada sauce as others had recommended.  It turned out absolutely fabulous!  It was just a tiny bit spicy, but even my 3 year old applauded me for a great dinner!

I have never eaten or made enchiladas before and I chose this recipe because it was lower in fat.  These are certainly spicy!!  Too spicy for my son and just about too spicey for me and hubby.  But that is just personal taste.  Overall very good recipe and I will be making these again...just with less heat :)

I like spicy recipes, but this recipe came out almost too spicy.  I thnk it was the 7 oz can of chopped roasted chili peppers.  I'll try the smaller can next time and try tinkering a little more with the recipe.  I did like the addition of cottage cheese/sr. cream.

This was delicious! Next time I will double the meat filling, as I did not have nearly enough to stuff the flour tortillas. Also, I added black beans because we LOVE them!! I only used one can of green chile peppers and that was enough for me. My hubby likes spicy food so he added red pepper flakes. On a side note- he never eats cottage cheese OR will look at it! I had to keep him out of the kitchen as I made this so he did not see it. After he ate two enchiladas, I told him the "secret" ingredient! You would never know it is in there.

The cottage cheese sour cream mixture was ver good.  I cooked the chicken in the crockpot with taco seasoning, peppers, onion, and chicken broth.

I made a lowfat, carb friendly version using lowfat cottage cheese, low fat sour cream, half the shredded cheese (I could have used lowfat cheese instead) and low carb tortillas. I put frozen chicken breast in the slow cooker with an onion for 4 hours. My husband loved it and can't wait until I make it again.

This was really good!  I was a little skeptical of the cottage cheese in it, but you would never know that it was there!  Everyone enjoyed it, even the kids.  The only change I made was I used flour enchiladas.  They were a little bigger.  6 of them filled the 9x13 pan nicely.

These are awesome!  I was intially skeptical because I do not like cottage cheese because of the texture-but the texture is different in this receipe. When I have made it from groups it has been gobbled right up-definitely a keeper!

This was SO GOOD!  I never ever would have thought of putting cottage cheese in enchiladas!  But it was fantastic!  They were easy to make, and I will definitely be making them again soon!

WONDERFUL!!  Everyone loved them, however I had two hungry boys so I stuffed 7 tortillas instead of 12. I think I would use more chicken if I did 12.  I wasn't sure which enchilada sauce to buy but I got Rosarita brand and it was great.  So easy to make..definitely save this one!

AWESOME!!!! The only thing I do differently is that I use flour tortillas.  It tastes better that way and the corn just fall apart when I try to roll them...  I get so many compliments on this recipe and EVERYONE asks for it!  A standard in our rotation.

I liked these a lot.  I didn't care for th can of red enchilada sauce I got, so I mixed it with a half of a jar of salsa and I think it turned out great.

This was good.  I love enchiladas and I love cottage cheese.  I added an extra can of enchilada sauce to the bottom of the baking dish.  Also, only needs 1/2 the can of green chiles.  I omitted the taco seasoning.  If I did it again I would like to let it rest for a while to see if the flavors would be better also, I wouldn't take the time to roll them.  I would just stack it like lasagna.

I found these to be lacking in flavor, mainly because I think the success of this dish is in your choice of enchilada sauce.  I chose green because I was out of red sauce. Should have looked up a  homemade sauce.  It needed red sauce.  The chicken mixture was good, but I'm still trying to figure out the purpose of the cottage cheese, I would have rather had more chicken mixture with a little bit of grated monteray jack spinkled on top, I think it wouldn't have changed the taste one bit.

This turned out very spicy and I used mild of everything.  I will consider making it again but leaving out the chopped chilis.  I only used a 4 oz can and our mouths were still on fire!  Suggestion to make things easier - I did not warm the tortillas and just layered everything vs rolling.  The consistency was perfect.

This was a wonderful dish- I made it for 3 growing boys in their 20's and they loved it. They can be a little gooey. I used green enchilada sauce instead of red.

This is a great recipe!  I changed a couple of things-I used 3/4 cp green onions instead of yellow onion.  I used ground turkey 1.5 lbs, I can of black beans, one garlic glove.  I used reduced fax mexican cheese mix from Trader Joe's and layered the corn tortillas instead of rolling them.  I also. I love the idea of putting cottage cheese in the enchiladas-thank you!!

This recipe has quickly become a staple in our home!!!  My husband even loves it, and he isn't crazy about Mexican food.  I was leary about the cottage cheese, but you would never know its in there.  These enchiladas are better than many that I've gotten in Mexican restaurants.  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and added sauce to the bottom of the dish.    Whenever I make this recipe, I make an extra pan to give to my sister who is in college.  She shares it with her roommates and they all rave about it!    Thank you for this fantastic recipe!!!

These turned out great for me.  I didn't have any sour cream or enchilada sauce, so the tops of the tortillas got a little crispier than they probably should have, but we loved it.  I used 6 8-inch tortillas and that fit a 9x13 pan.  We will be making these again!

These were great.  I was a little weary at first because enchiladas with cottage cheese sounds weird but don't be fooled!  My son asked if I was making red or white enchiladas tonight and I thought about it and said....hmmm kinda both.  That's what these reminded me of is a combination of the red and the white enchiladas.  Very yummy.  Any extra filling I spread over the top of the enchiladas when finished.  The only thing I will do differently is invite company over or freeze half next time.  This made a very large portion even for my family of 6.

Love this - and my family loves it too!  Very close to authentic Mexican enchiladas, the cottage cheese just adds to it.  Be careful with the green chiles if you don't like hot stuff - the canned are less hot if you want to try that!

This was great!  I made this for some friends.  I made two substitutions.  I used the fiesta cheese blend because that was on hand and the green chile enchilada sauce instead of the red sauce.

This recipe was very good.  I layered the ingredients like a lasagne as another person had sugessted.  I used more cheese and added some salsa between the layers. I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.

This is a quick and easy recipe that yields a lot of food. They weren't quite the enchiladas I was hoping for, but still good. I will likely make these again, but next time I'll add another can of enchilada sauce.

I'm in Texas so my family is pretty picky when it comes to these enchiladas.  I made the recipe as is the first time and it was pretty good(4 stars).  Second time around I added chili powder, cumin and cayenne to the chicken + jalapeno and it was a 5 star for us(of course we like spicy!

I really liked the flavor of these enchiladas.  My whold family enjoyed them. I used a whole rotisserie chicken shredded up and green chili verde sauce. My family prefers it with chicken to the red. The only thing I would change which was my choice, I warmed the shells in the microwave to save time rather than softening them in oil. They fell apart when we served them. This is a keeper.

A-mazing. My husband doesn't like cottage cheese, but loved these. I didn't use taco seasoning and seasoned the meat mixture myself.

Good enchiladas, but not the best I've ever had.  It actually might have been the fault of the enchilada sauce.  i don't think I'll use the La Victoria brand again.

These were mediocre. My fiance & I ate 1 helping, but did not have 2nds & are not saving leftovers. The idea of using cottage cheese intrigued me, so for that reason (and the fact that I've never had enchiladas prep. this way) I'm glad I gave this a try. My fiance, a confirmed cottage cheese hater, didn't even detect it (haha!)!!! I pretty much followed annabell's direct. to the ltr., but did find it necessary to make a few ch.: a) I placed 2 (frozen) chx. breasts & a lg. carton of chx. broth in my sc @ noon; 4 hrs. later, I removed & shredded them & proceeded as direct., b) rather than mix. the meat & cheese sep., I comb. them 2gether, c) I drained my cottage cheese (I was afraid my enchiladas would be runny otherwise; in retrospect, this made no diff.), d) I added 1/4 c. chopped cilantro & 4 sm. (minced) garlic cloves (garlic sauteed w/ chx.) to my meat/cheese mix. & e) I greased my baking dish AND spread a little sauce on the bottom of it to prevent sticking. I warmed my tortillas in the micro. for 45 sec. to soften (this eliminated the need to dip in sauce/broth). I made my own sauce - Terry Ann Christensen's recipe for enchilada-style burritos, - the burritos! B/c I 1/2'd this recipe, I had leftover seasoning. Not wanting any waste, I add. it to my bag of cheese to make taco seasoned cheese! Served w/ rice & chips, this was an 'OK' meal. Tx. annabell :)

My family including my 6 year old loved these.  I cook my chicken in a crock pot with one can of chicken broth and water to cover, salt and pepper, then shred after cooked. So easy and worked perfectly as the chicken in this recipe.

I took the easy way again and used diced Perdue shortcuts chicken (I love the ease of this stuff). I mixed with the sauted  onions and chili peppers as the recipe stated. I would say NOT to add salt to the cottage cheese mixture because anything made with taco seasoning is always going to be extra salty. I used flour tortillas in error but they were fine also.  I only managed to get 6 large enchiladas with this amount of stuffing.  Will make again.

Gotta love leftovers!  I was able to make 20 enchiladas - as compared to 12 following this recipe. I thought the flavor of the chicken was good, but would have liked more zest in the cheese portion of the filling.  I will add a richer cheese next time I make it.

Easy to make and delicious.  The only change I would make is to either add a second can of enchilada sauce or a can of diced tomatos.  Only one 10 oz can of sauce dosn't cover all the enchiladas.  I have also tried this with left over taco meat & it turned out well!

I used canned chicken because I was running low on time. It turned out great. The corn tortillas make a huge difference, very good.  I think I will try with ground beef next time.

fussy husband liked this. i used some shortcuts on prep and clean up time to make this work day friendly. mostly saved time by taking a long sheet of aluminum foil, layed it flat on the table to butter it (butter thoroughly) then line the pan with it (saves scrubbing your dish). for the chicken I used great value chicken strips, the breaded precooked kind, actually the breading held the taco flavor Very well. fried it in smart balance butter along  with green peppers. (just thaw in microwave and 'fork' it.) also saved time by simply stirring the shredded cheese into the cottage cheese to spoon in all together. we love salsa, so i put one spoon of salsa in each little roll. (note: hot taco seasoning with 'medium' salsa IS a bit Too hot.) he really liked this, so next time when I make it I will adjust the ratio a bit to have more sour cream in these. (also, I used both fat free cottage cheese and light sour cream, he loved it.) also i used the powdered mix enchilada sauce, which was bland, but i added taco seasoning to the bland sauce before mixing everything else. it all came together well, and fairly quickly.....

These were absolutely delicious.  I used the verde sauce.  I will be tripling the recipe for our MExican Food themed Father's Day celebration this weekend.  Thanks for the great recipe, and the tip of sauce in the bottom of the pan.

My whole Family loved these, I even have 1 child who does not like cottage cheese and he liked these. They are easy to make. I used the green enchilada sauce instead of red (I didn't know if the red was spicy) and they were excellent.

My favorite *no fuss* enchilada recipe - fairly healthy too.  I always double and bring to friends who've had babies, friends that are sick, etc.  It's too easy not to double the recipe and share.  We love this!

This recipe is really amazing!  I wouldn't change a thing about except to say that it just barely could feed 6...more like 4.  After making it the first time I doubled the entire recipe so that we could have leftovers!!  Super yummy...my husband was quite impressed.  I leave the onions out though because I don't like onions.  Also, I accidentally bought the green enchilada sauce the last time I made this and it was good as well...maybe even better than the red sauce, but both are good.

These are awesome!  I use flour tortillas - personal preference.  I've also used chicken from the whole chicken instead of breasts - that is handy when you've got it on hand.  I've even used ground beef seasoned with taco seasoning and they turned out nice.  Freeze well.  This is a "casserole" I have taken to lots of friends with new babies.

These were yummy!  I substituted ground turkey for the chicken. I chopped orange bell peppers instead of green chiles and added a quarter can of zesty diced tomatoes to the meat mixture as the ground turkey tends to be dry.  I'm not a fan of cottage cheese and was leery of this dish but was very pleased with the result and the creamy texture it lent. Definitely coat the bottom of the pan with the enchilada sauce and be sure to brush onto each roll so as not to dry out. I sprinkled the tops with fresh cilantro for added color and flavor and served with a side of spanish rice. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

Tastes great but a little runny the first day.  It is even better the next day when all the liquid has been absorbed.

My 17 yr old son, who is NOT a picky eater and often cooks for the family was very skeptical about this recipe because of the cottage cheese which he told me SEVERAL times he HATES....but he LOVED this dish.  My husband also really liked it even though for 18 yrs he has sworn to not like anything remotely like this.  This is a winner for us and not only will we make it often, I have already sent it to everyone I know and highly recommended they try it.

This is my favorite recipe I have ever found.  I do make some changes as follows.  I buy 1 precooked chicken from my grocery deli and take all the meat off the bones.  I saute mushrooms and greenpeppers then dump the chicken in the sauteed vegetables and add some taco seasoning.  Just enough to flavor and meat and veg and stir.  No need to cook the chicken its already cooked.  To assemble.  I take the tortilla, add the chicken veg mix, top with a layer of cottage cheese/sour cream mix, then top the cottage cheese with some monterey jack cheese then close the tortilla. The tortilla will have 3 layers inside. I make a double batch of mrs espys enchilada sauce from this site and put a little bit on the outside fold of the tortilla to act as glue and line up the enchiladas in a pan that has some enchilada sauce on the bottom. After all tortillas are rolled i cover with some more enchilada sauce so that all the tortillas are wet (not swimming) then top with some more monterey jack cheese.  This works with either flour or corn tortillas.  Bake covered with foil for 15 minutes then bake for 20 minutes more uncovered or until the cheese is bubbly.  You can add more sauce if you notice the tortillas are drying while cooking. Thank you so much for this recipe idea.

Our family and friends love this recipe. I use 1.5 cups of cottage cheese rather than 2. Makes for a less soupy enchilada. I use green enchilada sauce rather than red. I highly recommend using corn tortillas, much better than flour and is more traditional. I also use low or non fat dairy products and no one can tell the difference. Have been making this for many years now. Always good for a crowd too! We also love the leftovers a bit better the next day too.

Very good! I was apprehensive about the idea of cottage cheese as well, but it turned out great. I also skipped out on the onions and used a lot less seasoning on the chicken, because I like my chicken to taste like chicken.

A husband fave!  I probably used almost 2 cans of the enchilada sauce - and added the sliced black olives after it cooked, like another reviewer suggested.  Really good!  It'll become a "regular".

I use chunk canned chicken breasts and just break them up with a fork. I then follow the recipe but do add cheese and meat mixture and use flour tortillas.  Delicious!

My husband loves, loves, loves these enchiladas and he is a very picky eater.  I have been looking for the perfect recipe and this is it.  At first I didn't think I would like it because it said it came with sour cream and cottage cheese and real Mexican enchildas aren't made this way but let me tell you these are better than the authentic Mexican enchiladas.  The first time I made them they feel apart I think it was because of all the sauce, so what I did the second time around was bake them without the sauce for about 10 min took them out of the overn and then added the remaing chicken, cheese, cheese mixture and sauce and baked them for another 15 min and they came out perfect.

I made two versions for dinner party of mixed company - kids and adults.  The kids need way less onions and the adult version could have had more spices.  I would suggest maybe some jalepano and chili powder.  We added a side of black beans and rice.  A big hit around and there was hardly any leftoevers.

DELICIOUS but messy looking once I served them. Once you pile the sauce, cheese, and extra chicken on top it looks more like a casserole than actual enchildadas. Some were skeptical about the cottage cheese but it really was good!

Really, really good! I used fat free cottage cheese and fat free sour cream. The prep time took me so long (I forgot to buy red enchilada sauce & had to make it) that I didn't serve any sides with this. Yummy, yummy. Will make again for sure.

I made these for a large group. They were good, but the taco seasoning taste was a little heavy. Also, based on the other reviews of a "gooey mess", I used a little less cottage cheese than the recipe called for.

WOW-WOW-WOW - I am a California girl who regularly enjoys our traditional mexican cuisine here. I was most reluctant about this one but was intrigued because of the reviews and I was so incredibly surprised. This recipe will go into my permanent recipe box.  We loved it.  I'll be preparing this next month for my bunco group at my house.  My teenage daughters loved it too.  It really is more like a mexican lasagne and is easier served as a casserole.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't change anything.  I have been sneaking  bites from the refrigerator.  It's even good cold.  We thought the leftovers would be great rolled up in a flour tortilla with scrambled eggs and a bit of hot refried beans for breakfast.

These were really good.  I was very skeptical with the cottage cheese, but my family wolfed them down... even the baby!

HUGE hit in my home! Easy to make, can even do ahead of time & bake later.  You can't really taste the cottage cheese but I think that's what's giving these enchiladas the extra great taste!  Highly recommend!

This was really great! I was a little worried when I mixed the cottage cheese and the sour cream because it didn't look so great, but they were delicious, a great success. The only thing that I changed was that I cooked the chicken in the crock pot in chicken broth, because it seems more tender, and I used salsa instead of enchilada sauce (personal preference). Will definately make these again.

These were so yummy, a nice twist on traditional enchiladas. The combination of the cottage cheese, sour cream and taco seasoning was delicious! I think this would be great with beef too.  I cut the recipe in half because I wanted to test it, however I still ended up with enough meat & filling to make enchiladas for a 13x9 pan. One thing I think it needed was a little more sauce, maybe a 14oz can. For my taste 10oz wasn't quite enough. But overall these were great and I will make them again!

Very good. I used left-over rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. To reduce the sodium, I chose to omit the taco seasoning mix, and only use a small amount of El Pato tomato sauce (left-over from making "Mrs Espy's Enchilada Sauce", instead of canned) to season the chicken. I also reduced the amount of cheese. Made into a layered enchilada casserole, instead of rolling, and topped all with sliced black olives and green onions.

This is a 5-star recipe if you do one thing: WARM THE TORTILLAS BEFORE ADDING THE FILLING! if you don't, the tortillas will just split and you will have a huge, unsightly mess. put a skillet over low heat and warm a tortilla on each side for about 15 seconds, then wrap them. It makes all the difference.

These are awesome!  I've made them several times now.  I've made them using the recipe as is, or with hamburger meat instead of chicken.  Both ways are great.  Mozzerella cheese works fine, too, if you don't have Monterey Jack.  You can also make these go quite a bit farther if you just keep filling tortillas until you run out of filling (instead of just pouring the remainder of the filling over the top).  Great recipe!!

It was the first time we had ever eaten Enchiladas ever and they were tasty!  I added sauce to the bottom of the pan like one reviewer did and I thought they were too soupy, and I also, used flour tortilla's because I'm not crazy about soft corn ones and they were also a bit gluey.  Next time I will make it just as the original recipe calls for!

It was good. I used all of the cheese mixture and it was too much. I would also add more enchilada sauce next time.

This was so good and easy to make. I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store to save time. When I got home I realized the taco mix didn't make it home with me, so since I had a 16 oz. jar of enchilada sauce, I mixed 6 oz. of it into the chicken mixture. It was so good (and easy) that I'll do it that way next time. I mixed all of the filling ingredients together, again to save time. Since I used some of the extra sauce I had intended to use for the top as other reviewers suggested, I stirred a little sour cream into it to stretch it a bit. I topped the whole thing with sliced olives and fresh cilantro when it came out of the oven just as a matter of taste preference. This is my new forever chicken enchilada recipe.

Don't let the cottage cheese fool you! Sounds a little strange but it is perfect for enchiladas.  The cottage cheese melts down and gives the enchiladas a great flavor and smooth texture.  Great recipe!

WOW! These were absolutely amazing! I divided the recipe between two square cake pans and froze one. I can hardly wait to take that one out of the freezer and enjoy it soon! Thanks for a great recipe, this will be a regular dish at my house.

Everyone really seemed to like these. I realized after I started that I only had flour tortillas. I used them but they did seem to fall apart. Don't know if the corn would work better...will try that next time.~~~UPDATE~~~I tried this agan and used corn tortillas this time. I actually liked them better with the flour ones!! The corn ones were way too small to roll well and they kept busting apart ((even after warming them)) I will use this recipe again but using the flour tortillas!!

These were very tasty!  I loved the creamy part that the cottage cheese added.  I did take the advice of add 1/2 cup sauce to bottom of pan, I also used flour tortillas.  My whole family LOVED these and has requested I make these again.  I think next time I will try making layered instead of rolled and see how that goes!**UPDATE** didn't layer them but tried green chile enchilada sauce-LOVED IT...that change allowed the green chile flavor to come out...SUPER-Changed to 5 Stars

This is a great recipe with a few changes. I used leftover rotissiere chicken instead of chicken breasts. Because rotissiere chicken tends to be a little salty I was afraid to add the taco seasoning. I added a tsp of cumin to the cottage cheese/sour cream mixture instead. I used green enchilada sauce since we had that on hand (and I really prefer green sauce). I served it with charro beans and it was fabulous. The filling stayed moist and had lots of flavor. Definitely will make this again.

These are really good. I left out the green chiles, (can't eat them), and substituted cheddar for montery jack, (couldn't find any at the store), and flour tortillas for the corn tortillas, (don't like them).  I will definitely  make these again!

This recipe was great. My husband cringed when he saw he cottage cheese, but he loved them. I added fresh chopped plum tomatoes, black olives, and scallions to the top before I baked them. I thought it added a good touch.

Delish! The only thing I did differently was that I stacked it like a casserole instead of taking the time to roll the tortillas and I used shredded cheddar b/c it was all I had....we loved it!

this was really yummy and good.  i didn't have any chicken on hand so i used ground turkey, and it turned out great.  i didn't have any chopped green chilies, but i did have a can of rotelle, so i used about 1/2 the can in the meat mixture.  that gave it a nice flavor of chilies with the added tomatoes also.  i will definitely make these again... next time with chicken, i believe, but it would be good with any meat.

I have made this several times and everyone loves it!  I add 1 10 oz package of chopped spinach to add a little more veggies.  I also think that they taste MUCH better if you use the "regular" taco mix than the chicken taco mix.

Yum!  I used 2 cans of enchilada sauce. 1 mild and one hot so my husband and I could have a happy medium.  Delicious!  I also substituted taco seasoning for what I had, pinch of chili powder with a little minced garlic.

I've been on a search for a great Enchilada recipe and I think I'm going to stick with this.  I really like that cottage cheese accounts for what could have been high-calorie creaminess.  I used fat free cottage cheese and sour cream and also added a little less taco seasoning and green chiles.  Superb.  Thanks!

These were really really good.  I made it with 12" flour tortillas.  I dipped the tortillas in red enchilada sauce. Used cheddar, that's what I always use, because I always have it.  I think that's about all the changes I made, it was excellent!

I cook for the elderly and they loved this recipe.  I used the Enchilada Sauce recipe posted by Anna Marie instead of canned and it was fabulous.  I also skipped the taco seasoning and green chile peppers and used a little sauce instead.  Flour tortillas also worked great.

Also recc. pureeing cottage with sour cream.  Excellent and did not turn out mushy at all.  I used canned sauce, was in a hurry and had that on hand to use up.  Thanks for recipe.

Fairly good.  I made some modifications...   used chili seasoning when I realized I didnt have taco seasoning, added spinach and fat free refried beans.  I used 2 cans of red enchilada sauce.  I will likely make this again but follow the spicing directions more closely and make the enchilada sauce that other AR reviewers semed to prefer.

This tasted really good, but I had to drain water out of the pan a couple of times after cooking. I wasn't sure if the cottage cheese seperated producing extra liguid or what, but I didn't want my tortillas to get too soggy. That was the only problem I had with the recipe. 

Amazingly even my 6 year old who complains "it's too spicy!" if I put black pepper in her food ate it (though I did douse hers thoroughly with sour cream which she loves.) I changed only 2 things. 1. I cooked some frozen sweet corn in the microwave and mixed it with the shredded chicken because I wanted  corn flavor in the enchiladas and 2. I only had whole wheat flour tortillas not corn tortillas.

OMG, I loved these! I'm a big fan of buying a roast chicken from the deli and using the meat for various chicken dishes, so that's what I did here. I sauteed chopped onion and the green chiles, then added the shredded chicken meat and half a packet of taco seasoning and simmered it with a 1/4 cup of water. I used flour tortillas and a mix of Jack and Cheddar cheese. I haven't yet perfected making my own enchilada sauce, but I think the Las Palmas canned brand is pretty good. These come out very good!

I thought these were very good enchiladas.  I put a little refried beans in flour tortillas along with the chiken mixture and cheese.  I made homemade enchilada sauce and poured a thin layer along the bottom of the dish before laying the enchiladas in the pan.  Very good!

These were great. My husband and I loved them, however the children weren't that impressed (and they are adventurous eaters). It makes a bunch, we even had enough to freeze a batch for another time. I think next time I will make less cottage cheese mixture.

I made this into a layered dish for the sake of ease. Don't understand how this gets such high ratings. We didn't really like the cottage cheese in this. It wasn't a nice gooey cheese enchilada becaue the cottage cheese doesn't melt. To anyone wanting to try this, I would suggest increasing the regular cheese more.

These enchiladas were great although the chicken was a little skimpy - next time (and there will be one), I double the chicken.  I made a few changes which turned out great:  reduced-fat cottage cheese and sour cream, flour tortillas (but use the small one, the large ones are too difficult to handle), and add pinto beans to the stuffing.  Yumm...

These were pretty tasty. I normally don't like enchiladas, but decided to make them for my husband, who does. The cottage cheese mixture made a world of difference in the taste of these. I follow the recipe pretty much to the point, expect I did my own seasoning on the chicken. I did use flour tortilla's because that's all I had, and I doubled the amount of cheese because my husband likes a lot of cheese. Next time though I think I'll season the cottage cheese mixture with more that just S&P, maybe some garlic powder, and I think adding some fresh diced jalape√±os to the chicken mixture would bump up the heat and flavor in a needed way. I think I also might try these with seasoned ground beef next time. All in all, totally worth making again.

Warning: I made some changes! We loved the cottage cheese/sour cream mixture!  I used fage greek non fat yogurt instead of the sour cream.  Then I simplified this by just using taco seasoning with the cooked chicken and adding in some salsa. Cook on the stove like taco meat.  I combined this recipe with another recipe...stuffing cooked manicotti shells instead of the tortillas. Top with cheese and left over chicken mixture and bake as directed.  I credit this recipe for the cottage cheese mixture idea :)

I tried this recipe but with a vegetarian twist. I used a meatless taco filling by Freida's vegetarian products. It looked and tasted like ground beef. The cottage cheese in the enchiladas was so good. This is a favorite recipe of mine now. Thanks for sharing!

THIS TASTES REALLY GOOD, IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE HOTTER, NOTHING SOME HOT SAUCE DIDN'T FIX. THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS IS YOU CAN'T SEE THE SEPERATE ENCHILADAS, ALL THE SAUCE COVERS THEM UP AND YOU END UP CUTTING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEM AND IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG HEAP OD TOMATOES AND CHICKEN. GREAT TASTE, WISHED IT LOOKED A LITTLE PRETTIER!

The enchiladas pretty much feel apart once it was cooked.  Mayeb flour tortillas would have been better.  I also would have added about half of the taco seasoing packet to the chicken mixture.  I did use precooked chicken for the store which cut down some of the cooking time and tasted just as good.

These were delicious! The only thing I did differently than the recipe stated was to use more sauce and dip each tortilla in sauce before I stuffed it. Also, one chicken breast was plenty for us. I think I'll try putting some refried beans in next time. This was delicious AND so simple!

These were the best enchiladas I've ever tasted! So easy to make, too. I cut the prep time way down by cooking the chicken breasts in a crock pot with a can of chicken broth-done and ready to shred when I got home from work. What started out as a way to 'get rid of' some cottage cheese is going to be a regular in my house!

This was not a hit at our house. We both thought the flavor was unappealing. This may have been because of the brand of enchilada sauce we picked but the enchiladas were pretty bleh. We ended up just scrapping out the inside meat and using it on tortilla chips with sour cream.

These are wonderful!  The best enchilada recipe I have tried, and enchiladas are my favorite food so I have tried many.  I used some leftover Christmas turkey and 8 8 inch whole wheat flour tortillas with two (425ml) jars of mild enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese. Wrapped tightly, the enchiladas fit perfectly in my 9x13 pan so that was a huge bonus!  Next time I will try making this vegetarian.  Thank you so much for a wonderful easy recipe that I will treasure forever :-)

This is very good.  My whole family likes it and looks forward when they see it on the menu. It fills up my 3 bottomless pits. This is a keeper for me.
I would not have thought cottage cheese in enchiladas but its good.

The name sounds like a weird combination but I decided to give these a try with a couple of modifications.  I blended the cottage cheese to make it smooth rather than lumpy.  I also made a small pan of enchiladas with verde sauce, just to try.  Both were pretty yummy!

Very very good. It was really spicy though, but nothing that can't be adjusted next time around. Thanks for the recipe I will make this often.

Great recipe! I used precooked chicken cuts, fat free cottage cheese, fat free sour cream, and reduced fat mexican cheese. It was amazing!  I think this would be just as good with ground beef. Thanks!

This is my 2nd time reviewing this recipe, and it is so good.  Did as others suggested and made the Chicken in the crock pot.  I also changed it up a bit by layering everything(2 layers) instead of rolling the tortillas, and it made a wonderful enchilada casserole.  So good and easy, by far one of our favorites.  This is an excellent recipe.  My family loved eating this, it also make's great leftover's.   First time I did this recipe I used Hamburger, so this recipe is pretty easy to swap around.  Enjoy

I love this recipe. There are only two of us so I make it in two casserole dishes and freeze one for use another time. The frozen one turns out more like an enchilada casserole but is still delicious!

This is fantastic!  I've made it several times now.  I haven't deviated too much from the original, there's no need!  I did try it with ground beef once, and it was just as good as the chicken.  Excellent recipe, thank you!

I made a few changes to make it more healthy and based on what I had on hand and we LOVED this!!  
I used Fat Free cottage cheese and sour cream.  I also used the low fat flour tortillas, reduced the amount of cheese and extra lean ground turkey instead of chicken. Leftovers were even fantastic!!  Will definitely be making this again!!

These were great!  I thought the cottage cheese might be weird, but I love cottage cheese and I wanted to give it a try. Once it was cooked, the cc was almost unnoticable. I followed the recipe exactly except I used a dry enchilada sauce mix.  Next time I will do the same, I just won't put all of it on the enchiladas. I really enjoyed these but the whole time I was eating I kept thinking "something is missing". I never did figure out what the "something" was! I will try again!

They were o.k.  Used enchiladas sauce recipe with these, and found it too much.  Too saucy and too spicey.

I thought this was quite delicious. This was a great way to use leftover roasted chicken. Unfortunately my husband saw the cottage cheese and refused to let me put it into his tortilla, but I'll sneak it in front of him in the future. Will definitely make again.

If you like cottage cheese, these are excellent.  I think next time I will use a little less of the cottage cheese actually - the flavor was a little strong.  I also sprayed cooking spray and put enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan, and I also used flour tortillas out of personal preference.

Only so-so.  The cottage cheese was a little lumpy for my taste - that particular texture really killed the dish for me.  Husband said it was better as a leftover.

This was a great recipe... I was looking for a quick put together recipe for a last minute potluck.. i was to bring a main dish!! I had nothing here but left-over chicken I knew I had some left over tortillas and a can of enchilada sauce in the cuppord.. so I used this recipe.. I had onions, tomatoes, and garlic on hand.. so I sauted those with the chicken and a little E. Sauce..  I then did the cheese mixture and added all together in the tortillas toped with E.Sauce and cheese and into the oven they went!! OOH THANK YOU!! you saved my night!! Perfect easy recipe for dinner or a potluck!!

Loved the flavor of these.  I used flour tortillas because that's what I prefer.  I think next time I will use less cottage cheese so I don't need to spread it on top of the enchiladas, as I think it makes it look more like lasanga.  The taste is great!

I'd give this 3.5 if I could.  I thought these tasted good but I didn't like the presentation.  Leftovers even turned pinkish in color.  Definitely would not serve these to guests.  I doubt I'll make them again because my husband and 3-year old weren't even that impressed with the flavor.

Very good, but they tasted like -well- taco sauce. I'll lighten up on it next time.

This was really good!  You can't really taste the cottage cheese, and it gave it great texture.  I had some of the cottage cheese/sour cream mixture leftover, so I made a couple enchiladas with just that for filling, and they were good too.  Great recipe for cottage cheese lovers!

This tasted good, but for the prep time that goes into it, I will more than likely fall back on a simple chicken enchilada rather than making this one again.  The taste wasn't much different from the basic enchiladas I usually make.  If you have the time, give this recipe a try, but if you are used to making quick enchiladas, this is probably not the recipe for you.

Not special but a good recipe for a family meal.  A bit spicy for little ones but nice for adults.  We used a soy "chicken" substitute and found it worked well.  Will attempt with tofu another time.

This was very good.  The enchilada sauce I used was horrible, but the filling was so good it made them edible.  This is definitely my new enchilada recipe.

Used ground beef and a mix of mexican cheeses instead of chicken and monterrey jack - this dish was beyond fabulous.  My husband devoured this!!!  Will definitely be serving this to company in the near future.

Ate these all week long. Was very easy to make -- although I lost patience with rolling the corn tortillas and instead just layered tortillas, then chicken, then shredded cheese, then cottage cheese, then tortillas, sauce, and more shredded cheese. Served with chipotle/lime rice. Could have been meatier -- I used 3 small frozen breasts instead of 2 fresh.

YUMMY!!!  This recipe can even be enjoyed by the cottage cheese haters.  My boyfriend hates cottage cheese and he gave this recipe a 5 star.  I used Pepper Jack cheese to spice it up a bit.  I also made half with corn tortillas and half with flour.  The flour tortillas stay together and the corn just break apart.  They both taste great.  Definately a Keeper!

My husband and I decided that we prefer this cheesy chicken enchilada recipe over any other. The sour cream and cottage cheese combo balances out the spicy chicken perfectly. I used the hot taco seasoning to give it an extra kick! It was great!

Very good! I decided to have a mexican fiesta for my mom's birthday and this was the main course. Before boiling the chicken I seasoned  with salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder (let it sit for about 1/2 hour in fridge) and boil in chicken stock. Also, I used a little less cottage cheese based on others reviews but I think if I did use the recommended amt. I would of been fine too, the cottage cheese was not weird AT ALL! Finally I used green enchilada sauce since I didn't see red and I think red is for beef anyway. Me and my boyfriend are looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch today!

This is a great recipe.  My family prefers green enchilada sauce so I switched to that and also changed the taco seasoning to some garlic & onion seasonings.  The cottage cheese is a nice complimentary filler.

I'm from San Diego so I KNOW good Mexican food.  These are the best I've had.  Now that we live in Oregon and I've found this recipe, I make the best enchiladas in town.  I've made them for family from SD twice and got rave reviews both times.  I use a roasted chicken from the store to save some time.  I also recommend making your own Taco Seasoning from this site.  You won't have to worry about leftovers not being eaten!  This is now my "go to" meal when we have company.

I was pretty skeptical about this recipe but knew so many reviewers could not be wrong. It turned out great, nobody could even tell that there was cottage cheese! I followed the recipe to the letter except for subbing in low fat sour cream in and canned chicken breast. Will definitely be making again!

Excellent!  I'm always looking for a new Mexican recipe, and this a keeper.  The only change I made was to combine the cheese and meat mixture, reserving 1 Cup of the cheese to sprinkle on top.

I love this recipe. My husband likes cheese enchiladas and I like chicken enchiladas. This recipe is perfect for us both! I have tried leaving out the chicken for a plain cheese enchilada and it was ok. Enjoy!

Wonderful recipe! Easy to cook and great as left over lunch!  Not as heavy as normal cheese enchiladas but carries the same great taste.

As written these would be a little too soupy for me. They came out great using only about 1 cup cottage cheese and not pouring anything on top but some red sauce and a little cheese. I also lightly fried each tortilla so they wouldn't be soggy.

I have never made or ate enchiladas before but this was an amazing recipe!  I think boiling the chicken took longer than preparing the entire dish. ;)

Thank you for a great recipe!  
I will be making it again.

Definitely one of my favorite recipes.  Very easy to make, with room for your own twist.  I add black olives and omit the green chilies and red enchilada sauces sometimes.

This was so good! The enchiladas melted in my mouth. I took the advice of another review and added rotel instead of chiles and did not regret it! This was so good and will become a regular in my house!

Make this recipe even better: Use green sauce instead of red(red is for beef), no taco mix (too salty, and red), use flour tortillas(better tasting), and finally just mix all ingredients into a bowl instead of two different bowls(much easier), and voila great enchiladas

These were great!  I used non fat cottage cheese and sour cream to cut back on the fat.  I also chose to layer the tortillas instead of rolling them to save some time.  Worked great!

Loved this recipe! I added some black olives on top and did not drain the green chilis because I wanted that added flavor in the meat mixture. I did not use all of the the cheese mixture, so next time I will not make as much, probably half of what the recipe says to use. I will make this again and again!

I used canned chicken so there wouldn't be as much work to do.  It was excellent.  I halved the recipe and still came up with 9 enchiladas.  My husband loved it as well.  He ate 4.

I used 4 chicken thighs in place of the chicken breast (its what I had) and it was delicious!  The only thing I will try next time is to reserve some of the stock from boiling the chicken and use that in the meat mixture once I've added the seasoning instead of plain water. My husband doesn't like cottage cheese, but said he wouldn't have known the enchiladas had it if I hadn't told him.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe! My family loved it and it made for really good lunches the next day. 
I used flour instead of corn tortillas and used rotelle instead of the green chile peppers to calm it down a bit. I also sprinkled black olives over the top.

These were awesome and so easy!  I would definitely increase the amount of chicken used.  My family thought there was too much cheese in relation to the amount of chicken.  I also dipped the tortillas in the sauce as others have mentioned.  Will make again.

This was a great idea.  I actually made my own enchilada sauce.  I also sauteed the onions to cut down on the harshness.  Very good!  I will make again.

I had an enchilada last time at my favorite Mexican restaurant and I thought these enchiladas were much better than the ones at the restaurant.  Next time I would cut down on the cottage cheese.

YUM :) 

I left out the taco spice, it was tasty enough just with the chillis.  Only used a bit of the enchilada sauce too, looked a bit strange to me!  The sourcream/cheese mix really compliments the heat of the chicken - delicious mix!

This is awesome. A couple of changes that I made - boiled the chicken in chicken broth, and then used that broth with the taco seasoning instead of water. I also used green sauce instead of red sauce. I will definitely make this again.

I ommitted the green chile peppers because my hubby can't tolerate lots of hot spices, and substitued turkey for the chicken.  This was great!!  We will use this recipe often for turkey leftovers.  I also had more of the cheese mixture left and made up a few with just cheese - delicious!

Even people who don't normally like enchiladas like these.  I double the green chiles because I like more "pep".  The recipe is good made with turkey vs. chicken or cheddar & mozzarella mix vs. monteray jack.  I like to use what I have on hand.

i used the red enchilada sauce on this site, and upped the fat ante by replacing chicken with spicy italian sausage that tasted so good but went str8 to my thighs. husband raved and gobbled it down despite the fact that he just had wings and beer b4 coming home. yums.

These were good.  They were not as great as I was expecting and that may be my mistake.  I accidentally used 1.5oz of taco seasoning as that is how much was in my pack and I just dumped it all in, not thinking.  Also I only used a 4oz can of green chilies as that is what I had in my pantry.

Everyone who's had this loves it, even though I've made some minor changes so that it fits with my higher protein, controlled carbohydrate plan. I use high fiber/high protein whole wheat tortillas, which really cuts the carbs, and lower fat or fat-free version of cottage cheese and sour cream to cut the calories. No one can tell cuz they're still so great!

Oh so good!  The changes I made to the enchiladas were minimal.  I did add cilantro because we love it.  I also added adobo seasoning, not taco seasoning.  I also made a green chili cream sauce instead of red sauce and topped with cheese.  Really delicious.

Fantastic, so creamy so yummy.  I precook lots of chicken breasts and freeze them, so whipping these up is fast if you've already got chicken cooked.  No changes, just perfect!

Really delicious tasting!!  Not heavy like some of those soup-based recipes.  I used homemade red enchilada sauce from this site.  I might try flour tortillas next time as the corn tortillas were a bit mushy after baking.  This is definitely a keeper for me!

The cottage cheese part on this recipe is very good. The dish was very good, only I made it with the green chile and added a can of mushroom soup into the chile(no water added) and boy, it was great. I'm sure its great with the red sauce, but like i said, the cottage cheese mixture was awesome. So i gave it 4stars only because I didn't try it with the red sauce, but i'm sure it's good that way too. Definitely will make again.

These really are as good as everyone's saying. Very easy to make, and great flavor whether you use flour or corn tortillas. Made them twice this week already. (And, I even used chicken breast from a pouch.)

If there was a 6 star rating this would have it! I didn't have the best of luck with the corn torts and might try flour next time but this was an excellent recipe.  I've gotten where I only try 5 star recipes and after this one my family thinks I am turning into one of the best cooks ever!

Almost gave up on this because I just couldn't work with the corn tortillas.  But after the third one falling apart, I went to the store and got whole wheat flour ones instead.  Glad I did.  It turned out to be excellent!

Very good recipe!  I used onion powder instead of onions, paprika instead of chile peppers, and I only had Italian blend shredded cheese.  They were still awesome.  I also used flour tortillas because I like them better.  I made the sauce, "Red Enchilada Sauce" from this website.  very good.

Made it for cinco de mayo and what a hit!!! Everyone loved it and I was so happy. These are by far the easiest and best tasting enchiladas. Love the cottage cheese addition it adds alot to the flavor and texture. I did use a bit more shredded cheese, cause we like things cheesy around here. :)

This is a really tasty dish.

I found it easy to simmer the chicken breast halves in a pot of water the night before, and then just toss them into a ziplock baggie and put them in the fridge.  Then when you're ready to cook dinner, the food processor makes quick work of shredding them.

This makes a lot of food - you can fit it into a 9x13 casserole dish, but you'll probably end up stacking a few of them.

Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was delicious.  Also makes great leftovers.  I used 1-1/2 cups cottage cheese and that was plenty.  I recommend using Penzey's chicken taco seasoning - you can get it at www.penzeys.com. Cook and season chicken according to Penzey's instructions, then add other ingredients.

This was great, I made it with green enchalada sauce instead of red and really liked it (without onions, my husband and I don't care for them). We eat mexican food often and will definately make this again.

The flavors in this recipe were really good.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn and they still turned out a bit mushy.  I think next time - I'll try starting them without the sauce, and then add the sauce closer to the end of baking time.  Is definitely worth trying again, thanks!

These were really good.  My husband was wary about the cottage cheese, but we both ended up liking it alot.  The only reason why I didn't give it five stars were because I have fairly high standards and something has to be spectacular before I'll do that :)  However, these were definitely good and I will be making them again.

These are really good, easy enchiladas to make at home. My husband liked them a lot. It's a pretty heavy meal, so if you have light eaters make less. Don't fear the cottage cheese--it's good. I also left out the sauce as I don't care for it and the dish wasn't dry. I served it with Mexican Rice (by ginger) from this site.

These were great.  I used all low fat ingredients, my family really enjoyed them. We will make these again.

This is a wonderful enchiladas recipe.  I cook mine in a pampered chef baking pan, so I always put a layer of salsa on the bottom of the pan to ensure that the enchiladas wont stick.  This would probably be a good idea with any pan.  The salsa adds to the flavor of the dish. I make this at least twice a month. We love it.

Spicy food that's fun to serve when friends are around! I found corn tortillas in bowl shape so everybody could put in as much meat and cheese as they like! I used red paprika instead of chile peppers, and since I didn't have sour cream we just sprinkled the cheese over it, and it was still deilicious!!

My whole family loved this recipe.  I'm not a big fan of super spicy food, so I went lighter on the chiles.  I also used flour tortillas rather than corn and it was great!

I made this recipes for friends - wonderful!!!  Other reviewers might want to try flour tortillas - they hold up better when baked in a sauce.  I did use an additional half-can of enchilada sauce, and they turned out great.

Thank you Crystal for submitting this recipe the enchiladas they were really good!!!!  But I did agree with another reviewer about the sauce, not the submitters fault, I used a canned variety.  Somehow the wonderful flavor and texture of the enchiladas did not go with the red sauce, which is odd for me to say because I do not like the cream sauces.  But there is a little hole in the wall mexican restaurant near me that seems to have red sauce that has melted cheese put in and it reduced the harshness of the spices in tomatoe.  Perhaps I will try that.  Great recipe!!!

Amazing taste.  The cottage cheese adds a bit of texture, taste. Much like sour cream without all the guilt. Many have asked for this recipe.

This was very GOOD! I boiled my chicken in Chicken Broth, which makes it really moist, and used a taco seasoning mix, but it was chipotle flavored. YUM. I also added one big jalapeno for some extra kick. SO GOOD! I will be making this again for sure! Dont forget to add sour cream on top of the finished product.

Very good and easy to make. Just wish I had a good recipe to make homemade enchilada sauce b/c most of the canned versions have unnecessary preservatives.

Excellent flavor though not quite hot enough for our taste.  Only problem was that our tortillas cooked to mush but that may have been a result of the brand that I used.  Will try again adding maybe some jalapenos and using a different brand of corn tortillas.  Definitely worth another try.

Absolutely a hit anytime I make it, whether it's for family, a potluck, or a friend who has just had a baby.  Here are my adjustments:

-rotisserie chicken (about 1-2 lbs which equals 1-2 cups of cooked chicken)
-plain nonfat greek yogurt instead of sour cream.
-whatever cheese I have, sometimes cheddar, monterrey jack, or mexican blend.  
-the tex-mex enchilada sauce
-add garlic when I am making the meat mixture.  

This makes quite a bit and too much for my family to usually eat in a 9x13, so quite often, I will stretch it into 2 8x8 pans and freeze one for later.  Also, instead of rolling the tortillas, I do this as more of a casserole and have never had any complaints.

These are AWESOME!!  My fiance and I loved them!  They are sooooo easy and soooo delicious.  I actually cooked a pork loin in a slow cooker all day and then shredded it, which cut the prep time down even further.

These were really good and were liked by all seven of my children and my cheese-sensitive, gall-bladder-less husband.  I used leftover thigh and leg-meat chicken from a previous meal and augmented with boneless breast.  I think I was a little short on the sour cream, but by the grace of God, the recipe worked perfectly.  I will definately make this recipe again!

I was skeptical when I was making these, but this has turned out to be one of my favorite recipes! Instead of buying canned enchilada sauce, I used a sauce recipe from here. Sometimes, I'll use shredded pork marinaded in mojo creole in place of the chicken. Thanks for sharing!

This to me was just o.k. I think it would of been better if I used one of the home made recipes. I think next time I will. Thanks!

Very good!  I didn't have corn tortillas on hand so I used flour and they were just as good.  Also used fat free cottage cheese and sour cream and it tasted great because of all the seasonings.  Served it with mexican rice, corn, salsa and chips.

This is a great recipe.  It makes a lot.  I often cook it for Monday Night football when I know there will be a crowd.  I double it for all of them.  They all love it.

This might be the best mexican dish I've had in a long while. The only problem I had with it was that the corn tortillas fell apart during cooking. It may be my fault, though, because I made it ahead and had to cook it longer as it was chilled. Thanks for the keeper!

Delicious! I halved this recipe, but other than that i followed the recipe to the T. The only "downside" to this was that the enchiladas turned out amorphous (basically they came apart). No matter though...really good stuff, excellent comfort-food! So great, I'm thinking of having them for *breakfast* tomorrow!!

This was okay, but my regular enchilada recipe is better.  I'm a cottage cheese lover, but putting it in this recipe didn't do anything for me.  My husband and I love Mexican food too, but weren't impressed with this at all.

I didn't have the green chile but was excellent. 5 stars from boyfriend too. I couldn't tell it was cottage cheese, really. Was like lots of sour cream or a lasagna. Very messy!

Very good!  I was lazy and short on time, so stacked this dish like a Mexican lasagna.  I used green enchilada sauce instead of the red (had some to use up)but otherwise followed the ingredients pretty closely.  Turned out great.  Will try again making the 'whole' enchiladas next time!

The first time I tried this recipie was about two years ago.  I love it so much that we bring it to all our potlucks and school functions.  The one and only thing I change is instead of using taco seasoning, I mix together New Mexico chili powder, garlic salt and cumin.  I love this recipie!!!

Good tasting and the cottage cheese made them different. I used flour tortillas and put the cheese on the top the last 10-15 minutes of baking. I also served these with shredded lettuce.

Seriously, these were SO good, there were NO leftovers!  Amazing recipe!!!  I used a fresh green chili pepper instead of canned (two would work better), and I'd recommend more shredded cheese, a 3rd chicken breast and a slightly bigger can of enchilada sauce to make sure that they are all covered up.  

I think this one will be a family favorite for a long time!

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I was a little hesitant trying these because of the cottage cheese but let me tell you....it works! I poached the chicken in chicken broth and then shredded it and added a little cayene...chili powder and cumin and did not use the taco seasoning at all. I mixed all of the ingredients together instead of layering into garden vegetable flour tortillas as I do not like corn and it worked perfectly. Added a little additional sour cream and some fresh chopped cilantro to the top. I took the leftover one for lunch today and can hardly wait. This one is a keeper. Thank you!

This recipe is a keeper!  I have been looking for a good enchilada recipe.  Well I stop looking last night!   My husband hates cottage cheese when he saw what I was putting into the recipe.  he almost pooh-poohed it.  I told him lets just try it.  Well my glad I did and so is 
he!

This was great! I grilled the chicken until just done, then shredded it in the food processor. I had a spicy batch of "Taco seasoning 1" from this site, which I blended with the onion/chile/chicken. Microwaving the tortillas a few at a time works very well. I mixed a cup of cheese (per previous reviewers) with the sour cream and c/c which did save time; but in the future I will leave out the sour cream as we couldn't tell it was there, and we prefer it as a topping. I also used Darigold's Cottage Cheese with Chives as it was on sale today (perhaps because it's 4% fat was why we couldn't taste the sour cream). All in all, it was wonderful.

Oh my goodness, these are FABULOUS!  The best allrecipe I've tried so far.  I had to make a couple of small changes, based on what was available in my kitchen.  I subbed half a jalapeno (seeded and diced) for 3oz of the green chilies and high fiber flour tortillas instead of corn.  I followed previous recommendations and combined the meat and cheese mixtures.  Delicious.  Next time I'll try using low-fat dairy products.

These were pretty good.I think that I might omit the sour cream from the cheese mixture next time as I served these with sour cream and the taste for us was a little overpowering.My kids even ate these--definitely a good sign!!!

I loved these, but my parents said they were four to four and a half.  Their reasoning was that they wanted to save the highest rating for something really super, which is what I thought these were.  I dunno, but they said they'd definitely eat them again!  Oh, and I used Mrs. Espy's sauce too, it was superb!  I didn't add the salt or garlic powder because my parents don't like things super salty or garlicky.  They loved them and said that it was just the right amount of spiciness and saltiness.  (I'm only 17 by the way, just so you don't think that I'm aiming only to please my parents so I can stay!;)) Thanks for the recipe!

this was a great recipe. followed the recipe exactly and it turned out deliciously. More like a casserole, though, because it was basically impossible to distinguish where each enchilada was, it all sort of melded together. I used 6" white corn tortillas so maybe their softer texture had something to do with it. I thought it was great, though.

Quite good!  I like a sauce on top, but this was still good.  I think next time I will use some extra enchilada sauce cooked with sour cream to cover the top.  Really excellent the next day, and pretty quick.  Thanks!

I thought these enchiladas were great, and I got rave reviews from my guests.  Very simple to make, and the lighter texture was an added bonus!

We thought these were great!  I used the "hot" taco seasoning packet, layered it like lasagne in a 9x13 pan, & added sliced black olives to each layer.  If it's availabale in your area, use Hatch brand roasted tomato enchilada sauce.  It's outstanding.  I had no problem with anything being "messy" or with any excess liquid as noted in some other reviews.  They were even better - and hotter! - the next day.

I loved these!  I brought them to my cousin's for dinner the next night and they were just as good reheated.  I added chopped tomatoes just because I had them in the fridge.

I had a hard time getting the corn tortillas to stay wraped, they kind of cracked and fell apart.  Other than that, the taste was great!  I think I would have used a little more chicken and a little less sour cream... maybe next time I will soak the tortillas in the enchilada sauce first.

This recipe was great. The cottage cheese added such texture and flavor. These are not spicy so you can serve them mild or add some jalepenos for an added kick. I used green enchilada sauce and doubled the amount. I also used low fat cheese and it turned out wonderful. These will be made more often! Great for leftovers!

I'm a college student, trying to learn to cook before I have an apartment this fall.  I had this recipe at a friend's house and decided to try it out on my own family.  We've already had it two times in two weeks!  They say it's the best thing I've ever made.

I thought this recipe was pretty good (not great), but the rest of my family (husband 5 yr old & 2 yr old) told me to not bother making it again. I used all mild ingredients and they still thought it was too spicy. Whimps!

This recipe was fabulous!! I followed it to a tee, except that I added a little more cheese.. My husband (were newlyweds) had never really eaten any Mexican food before he met me.. I have already made him "my classics" over and over and was looking for something different.. He loved this sooo much...I have already given this recipe to all my friends to tell them to try it they wont be sorry!!!

These enchiladas were fantastic!  My husband said if I keep using recipes from allrecipes.com he is going to get fat! I substituted a cheaper cut of chicken (thighs and legs) and it was delicious.  I can't wait to make this one for company.

So Yummy!  These enchiladas were creamy and delicious.  I will make them again, but probably use 3 chicken breasts as I ran out of chicken with 2 enchiladas left.  I also mixed the shredded cheese into the cottage/sour cream mixture to make the assembly faster...worked great.

These were GREAT!  A bit mushy, but it may have been the type of tortillas I used (white corn, I think).  I followed the recipe exactly and the flavors were perfect.

I thought I'd cut out some fat and use white corn tortillas; they got soggy and what I ended up with could only be described as Enchilada Stew. Funny thing is, it was amazing! Even better the next day and I bought yellow corn tortillas today so I can make them right. The only change I made was to use a smaller can of chiles. Couldn't have tasted better, even though it looked weird. Can't wait to try this again.

My husband and I both loved this dish.  I recommend using 6 corn tortillas for this recipe instead of 12.  I forgot to put the jack cheese in the tortillas, so I poured the left over cottage cheese mixture over the tortillas and sprinkled all the jack cheese on top. Scrumptious!!!

This recipe offers an excellent blend of incredible ingredients and flavors.  Boiling the chicken made it tender and easy to shred...perfect recipe for a cold night! This  will certainly become a regular "delight" in my home. Thanks.

I give this 5 stars foe taste and four for convenience.  I live in Texas and cook a lot of Mexican food.  These enchiladas taste great!  I used canned premium chunk chicken..about 15 oz.  I spread a small amount of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the dish instead of greasing it.  They were awesome.  I think I will try a sour cream tomatillo sauce with them next.  Thanks!

These were the best enchiladas i have had.  My two and a half year old loved them also.  She ate a bunch.  My husband loved them and he loves Mexican food.  He said they were better than any of the ones at restaurants we eat at.  YUM YUM Im making these on to bring to family occasions also.

Amazing!  I used another shredded chicken recipe with tomatillos and then used verde sauce on half and red on the other.  I even got my boyfriend to eat cottage cheese with a smile.  This is a new favorite.

This recipe has become a family favorite. Even my picky 10 year old son loves it! I used flour tortillas and have also left out the onions at times. Try this one... it's wonderful!

I wouldn't say these were the best enchiladas I've had, but they were definitely tasty. Mine got a little mushy, but they were good enough to make again!

I made this with flour tortillas and skipped the green chilles and we loved it.  I wouldn't have know there was cottage cheese in them if I hadn't put it there myself.  It was too spicy for our little children but tasted delightfully Mexican to my Mexican-food loving husband.  We'll make this again for sure.
