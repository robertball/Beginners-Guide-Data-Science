I chose this recipe because it uses twice as much eggnog as all the others!  I didn't really read the whole thing until I started making it and that is when I realized there are NO spices in this recipe...NO flavor!!  So, as I often do, I modified it....I added 1 tsp of cinn and 1 tsp of nutmeg...also 1 tsp vanilla...and I used only 2 3/4 cups of flour.  I haven't iced any of them yet since I just took them out of the oven...but they are great!  Sorry to the person who posted this recipe...I just thought that without spices they would be too bland!!

A great fluffy cookie that's not too sweet!  My Father in Law loves these cookies!  I make them every year for him.  I like to add a little rum or rum extract just to the icing, and then sprinkle the tops with a pinch of nutmeg.  It just adds that little bit of authentic eggnog flavour, and makes them a bit prettier for my Holiday platters!

This is the first time I ever threw out a batter after making one batch.  It tasted 
like flour and that was about it.  The texture was poor and the taste was really bad.
The kids and I hated them.  I think the recipe must be off in the amount of 
flour used.  Denise

love the recipie, but not very eggnoggy?! Added some cinnemon, nutmeg, and vanilla as someone else suggested and only used 2 1/3 cup of flour! Cookies came out fluffy and pretty. Piped eggnog frosting over back and forth and red and green sprinkles very cute!

I liked this recipe, but it didn't have enough eggnog flavor in it, so I added about a teaspoon of nutmeg to it, and also sprinkled some on the frosting.  My daughter and friends really liked it.  They seem to get more flavor as they sat over night.

These were okay.I was trying to find a way to get rid of the egg nog I had in the fridge, but now that I got rid of it I wish I had some more to make more cookies. These cookies were great. I recommend this recipe for everyone.  It's quick, easy, and good.

A very nice, mild flavor. I added a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and lightly dusted them with nutmeg. I enjoyed the cake like texture. I would definitely add these to my Christmas cookie favorites.

After I made these for a cookie exchange, my husband asked me to make "Santa" an entire batch for Christmas.  He absolutely loves these cookies.  Since the cookie isn't terribly sweet, go ahead and make the icing thick and spread it on the entire cookie, then sprinkle with the nutmeg.  They turn out very pretty, taste just like eggnog, and are perfect for the holidays.

I Loved these cookies. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon & 1 tsp vanilla.  I liked them without the icing but the Hubby liked them both ways.  I thought they tasted like eggnog. Yummy!!

My 4 year old took one bite of this cookie and gave it back.  He loved the cookie dough though.  I think the problem is not enough sugar and other spices.  The dough is sweet but once baked it's very bland.

I followed all the suggestions here regarding adding spices, used about 2 1/2 cups of flour, as well, added a teaspoon of rum extract, but I just didn't like the consistency of this cookie, and still didn't find it had enough taste.  Sorry, but I wouldn't make this again.

Soft and delicious. I did add 1 tsp vanilla to the sugar mixture after the eggnog and 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon to the flour mixture. I also sprinkled a touch of nutmeg on the iced cookies.

Overall these cookies were great.  Kids and husband really enjoyed based on number eaten. :) I added 1 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  The amount of flour for me was great, I may have even added a bit more...but then I live in the NW US in a higher altitude.  Also increased coooking time to 10-12 minutes and added a dash of nutmeg to the icing.

I made these cookies last year for Christmas. I added the same spices as the person who wrote the previous post/review. They were a hit! I will be making them again this year.

Cookies were yummy.  Added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg to mine and was using vanilla eggnog.  Mine needed a little more flour but use your judgement there.  The frosting was too sweet so I added about 4 tbsp cream cheese.

The rating is based on this altered version, which is a little disingenious; sorry.  I followed one of the reviewer's suggestion and added 1 t of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I didn't add the vanilla.  It's a very flavorful recipe this way and produces very cakey cookies.  One thing though is that when I reduced the flour to 2.75c, I found the batter very wet...I guess that should have been obvious.  I froze it for about 15 min and that seemed to help a little.  Regardless, the cookies came out nicely risen.  My second batch though was flat, b/c I tried to fit more cookies on the sheet.  I think the glaze will not only add that extra oomph, but will also hide some irregularities of the second batch.  Nice.

i had to add a lot of spices to give it flavor.  i used pumpkin spice eggnog, add 3/4 tsp nutmeg, sprinkled pupkin pie spice and all spice, 1 tsp vanilla.  i also add spices to the frosting, i don't like the overly sweet taste of powder sugar so i added all spice, cloves, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie spice.  it's an okay recipe.....not a favorite but i will probably make again.

Just like the eggnog pancakes on this site there were ok.  Just not a super strong eggnog taste that I was hoping for!  I even made a second batch with additional spices and they still weren't anything over the top yummy!

Just took the eggnog cookies out of the oven.  I ended up just spreading the whole thing in a pan, because I was too lazy to make them into cookies.  Personally, although I love making new recipes, I wouldn't make these again (although I'm still gonna eat it, lol).  The batter tasted soooo good, but the finished product is really bland.  If you decide to make these, I would definitely add some cinnamon and maybe raisens, or some type of spice to the mix, to give it flavor.  It's REALLY moist and I'll bet the kids will love it (doesn't taste like eggnog AT ALL), but definitely needs something added.  Good luck!

Excellent christmas cookies.  Followed the advice of others and added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla extract.  Delicious!  So soft and were thick/puffy - unlike another recipe I tried off of Pintrest (paper thin).  Will definitely be adding this to my yearly christmas cookie list.

These cookies are really easy and yummy!!  I used all organic ingredients.  But instead of using all butter I used 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup coconut oil and 1/4 cup sour cream.  The cookies remain soft, freeze well and we really enjoy w/our morning coffee.

I used butter instead of margarine, and just a splash more of the eggnog to make the frosting spread easier. When people at work say they've eaten five - you know it's a success!

I made this recipe as-is.  When the cookies first came out of the oven and cooled enough to eat, they were the perfect cakey texture, but tasted a little like biscuits.  Although the biscuit flavor subsided and the eggnog became more detectable as they cooled a little, they're always going to be a pretty plain cookie as they are.  I frosted them with Sugar Cookie Frosting from this site by Kathy Brandt, substituting eggnog for milk, then sprinkled them with red and green sugars.  They were phenomenal that way - my favorite cookie on the platter.

They were pretty good. I made them for the cookie exchange at work. Everyone thought it they were pretty good. I think I am going to experiment and try adding some rum!

Surprizingly easy to make, had to add additional time to bake time 12 minutes instead of 10 called for in recipe (this could be due to oven inconsistency. Non the less they came out great. Taste as good as they looked. I would recommend these for your holiday baking

After reading reviews, I added the nutmeg, cinnamon & vanilla using the 3 1/4 cups of flour.  We love Oberweiss eggnog so that was a no brainer. I baked on parchment paper too.  They are awesome.

I thought these cookies were very good! But like the others I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla. For the icing I added egg whites (so the icing would harden) and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I didn;t get much eggnog flavor in the icing so I would probably omit it next time. I also added a dash of nutmeg on top.

I liked this recipe. It had a good eggnog flavor, but for anyone not expecting it, it is a very "cake like" cookie. Or at least it was for me. Very soft. My family enjoyed it, but it isn't a traditional cookie.

bland, no eggnog flavor at all...I should of guessed without vanilla to boost it. I didn't make the frosting as the cookie should hold it's own.

These cookies were delicious. The only thing I added was about a teaspoon of cinnamon. Other than that... perfection!
