This was realy tasty! I tenderized the meat, and instead of a rub, I put the naked beefe on the grill, sprinkled salt, then paprika, then garlic powder, and basted it with peppercorn A1, then turn and repeat. this gave it a spicy kick. i served it with veggies and cheeze sauce, but i should have done cheese bread instead.
