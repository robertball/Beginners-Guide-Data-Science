Loved this! The flavors were spot on, and it smelled wonderful while cooking. The only thing different was to add a bit more of each seasoning, only because the head of cauliflower was huge. I'll be making this again and again. This is a great substitute for me because I eat low-carb/keto.

Excellent healthy dish!  I have made it several times and sometimes add shredded chicken, chopped walnuts and green onion.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

We are not a big veggie-eating family, and I've been trying to change that. I used a bag of frozen TJ's organic cauliflower rice, heated it up to defrost it, and then followed this recipe, only adding extra garlic and cayenne pepper (and using ground ginger instead of fresh.) We loved it, and I've been told that I should make it again and again! Thanks for the recipe!!

Loved this recipe .... Im not a big fan of Cauliflower so the added seasoning was perfect.  I did add a little veggie broth when simmering w/lid as I felt the butter was not enough but otherwise this was perfect!

Loved it!  The only change I made was using less cauliflower, about 3 cups.  It cooked down and made 2 big servings that I served with chicken.  Wish I'd made more! My husband usually refuses to eat cauliflower but said he'd like me to make it again.

Wanted to introduce cauliflower rice to my daughter’s family. Would bump up seasonings next time but it was great. Wasn’t sure the no added liquid would work but it did. Added a bag of frozen peas and would use cilantro/lime next time which we didn’t have.  I love the variability and the tastiness.

This was delicious! We will use two head of cauliflower next time because everyone wanted seconds!  I didn't have garam masala, so we used chole masala.

So easy and so tasty!  Did not have lime or cilantro and it didn’t matter.

What an easy and quick recipe.  I buy the frozen cauliflower rice from Costco - a multi-pack of 1 pound bags.  Used one 1-pound bag for this recipe.   I was a little generous with the spices and added extra garlic.  Served it with saag paneer.   Thanks!!

Delicious flavors!  Great way to serve up cauliflower - especially to someone who doesn't really like cauliflower...

This was delicious. I have had cauliflower rice before and was sadly disappointed. This recipe has changed my mind on it. Even my daughter loved it. I did add a bit of liquid to it but it all depends on what texture you like your 'rice' to be. Super yummy!

Fantastic low car dish to go a long with chicken tikka masala or some other low carb main indian dish.
