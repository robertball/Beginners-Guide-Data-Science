This turned out pretty good. I did make 3 minor changes. First, since I used the hard store-bought cookies I just crumbled them and added without the baking step. Second I chopped the apples into bite-sized pieces instead of slicing them. Third I did cook the egg/cream mixture because I have young children. They all liked it - the cinnamon wasn't overpowering.

This is the best ice cream I have ever had! I chopped my apples instead of leaving them in slices. I also added an extra tsp of cinnamon to the apples by sheer accident, it turned out to be fine. I left out the walnuts as most of my family isn't really fans. Its yummy with out the nuts. For the caramel topping try making the Praline Sundae topping from this site (which is out of this world). I love the chopped bits of oatmeal cookie throughout(the hard store brand cookie works great. Awesome recipe I will be making this all summer!

I love this recipe.  I did, as suggested, leave the nuts out and I diced the apples into small pieces.  I also used only 2 tsp. of cinn.  I entered this recipe in an apple dessert contest and won 1st place.  Thank you, the ice cream is delicious!

I really enjoy competing in the Ice Cream Crank Off at our County Fair. I have not particapated in several years and have always done well. Competed in State Fair Crank off and place 3rd. This recipe won me Grandchampion and tasters choice award at the county fair level and am taking it to state. I even left the carmel sauce out, time ran out to add it I  had so many people ask for the recipe. The one thing I did different was I mixed the cookie crumbs with the butter and baked the 5 mins and when they came out of the oven I then patted them down. This recipe is truly a GRAND-PRIZE winner.

This tasted just like apple pie ala mode!!  It was delicious!  My changes were substituting vanilla wafers for the oatmeal cookies and omitting the nuts & caramel sauce.

This was really good with a FEW minor changes.  I followed the 'chopped not sliced' advice of another reviewer, which made it really quick and easy, and since I think nuts are icky I left them out.  I served the oatmeal cookies on the side.  BUT...wouldn't this ice cream be yummy between 2 oatmeal cookies as an ice cream sandwich?  Just an idea...

Fabulous in all ways, wouldn't change a thing. I did cook the creams and egg because of the raw egg issue. If you do this, make sure the cooked mixture cools almost to room temp before putting it into the ice cream maker.

I served this as a Memorial Day dessert, and it was absolutely delicious and loved by all.  I scaled down the recipe to 6 servings, and the mixture fit perfectly in my 1-quart ice cream maker.  One small problem- I didn't let the apples cool completely before adding to the ice cream mixture, so I think the majority of the apples sunk to the bottom of my storage container (my fault).  One guest said that it tasted just like a Ben and Jerry's ice cream that she had long ago.  Someone else suggested that the ice cream would be perfect with the fried apples served over the top rather than inside the ice cream.  All in all, it's a fantastic recipe.  Don't be afraid of the steps required to make it- it is well worth all the effort!!

This was simply delicious.  I won't be going to Cold Stone for this treat anymore!  I made three very minor changes...I added a pinch of nutmeg when frying the apples. I chopped the nuts up very fine, mixed them with the crushed cookies before I put them in the oven. The last thing is I took the advice of others and diced the apples instead for slicing them.  Will most definately make again!

A first-rate ice cream recipe. I used 3 cups of 2 % milk, 1 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup of skim milk - the consistency of the ice cream was very acceptable. I chopped the apples, and added 1/2 cup of caramel ice cream topping. Keeps for ages and is delicious.

I did not have the cream so used whole milk and skim so got ice milk. I also used canned pie apples which if i do a second time will use 2 cans. Was very good as an Ice milk kind.

Very good. I diced the apples finely, and am glad I did. Had I sliced them as the recipe states, the large frozen pieces would have been an icy distraction. Cutting them finely allowed them to be more evenly dispersed throughout, and the spices contributed a definite apple pie flavor. I did not use the walnuts because of allergy issues. The use of the oatmeal cookie "crumble" was innovative and added a lovely flavor and crunch. All in all, a nice novelty ice cream change of pace, but not something I'd rush to make again.

I used a different recipe for the ice cream base, and used ideas from this recipe to create my own version. I didn't like how this one was cinnamon, just wanted plain vanilla w/ crust and filling swirled into it. Great idea for oatmeal cookies as crust!

The thought of eating raw eggs kind of grosses me out, so I left them out, and I used pecans instead of walnuts; I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  It's up there with my all-time favorite ice creams ever!

This ice cream is amazing!  I did make a few changes: I cut the recipe in half to fit my ice cream maker.  I chopped the apple into bite sized pieces and omitted the walnuts.  I also used the "Easy Caramel Sauce" recipe from this site.  My husband was blown away!

Great recipe but I made a few changes due to time. I bought store made apple oatmeal crisp cookies and canned no sugar apple pie filling.  I used the whipping cream and half and half to the recipe but used egg beaters instead of real eggs.  I dumped all liquids and sugar into maker and let it run for about 30 minutes until consistency was paddling like. Then I added 4 cookies crumbled, and 1/2 can of pie filling.  I turned on the ice cream maker for another 20 minutes to creamy firm. I asked the family to top with  sugar free caramel to taste.  Everyone enjoyed. Makes about 6 servings.

I tried the recipe and really enjoyed it.  I chopped the apples was the only change.  I had to adjust the amounts for my 6qt. freezer but the taste was wonderful.  It was a hit.  have made it several times since.  thanks for sharing

I cooked the ice cream mixture because of the eggs (I used the "Ice Cream Base Recipe" on this site), but I neglected to let it cool enough before adding it to the ice cream maker, so it didn't freeze up very well. Will remedy that next time. Because of that, I didn't add the caramel sauce to the ice cream and just served it on top.

I made this recipe with minor changes.....VERY GOOD!!! The only thing I was curious about is the recipe calls for eggs but doesn't have you cook anything. Is this okay to eat with the uncooked eggs?
