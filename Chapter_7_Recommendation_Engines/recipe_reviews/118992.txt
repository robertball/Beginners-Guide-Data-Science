This is a delicious recipe - if you tweak it a bit!  I originally made it exactly as it was but it had too much butter and I didn't like the sweet taste.  So, I used 2 cans of tomatoes, 16oz of chicken broth, 1 cup heavy cream, 6 tablespoons butter and added basil and pepper to taste.  Came out fabulous.  I make it atleast once a week so I have it on hand for a quick lunch or an addition to dinner!!

This is so good!  I used half and half instead of cream and 3 T of butter after reading the other reviews, still delicious.  Great recipe and so easy.  UPDATE:  If I don't have half and half I use milk and it's still awesome!

I was completely stunned at how stupid easy and stupid good this turned out to be. I figured only 1 tsp. of sugar wouldn't be enough to cut the acidity of the tomato, so i put a total of 3 tsp. in for good measure, and it turned out perfect!! I ate this with a plain ol' grilled cheese sandwich and it was ridiculously tasty. I tried this with the dried basil since my store was out of fresh, and it was STILL awesome!

This is a very good base recipe but I found it to be too bland so these are the changes I made: Add garlic powder, salt, and pepper to taste.  Mince a medium sized onion and saute it for a few minutes before adding to the tomatoes and broth mixture.  Double the amount of basil.

My husband and I both thought this was fantastic, and honestly better than our favorite soup joint. I wasn't a huge fan of all the fat though, so I used less than half of the butter it called for, and part half-and-half w/ part milk instead of heavy cream. It had great taste and was still creamy, but much healthier. For my own taste, I added salt, pepper, a little extra sugar, and sauteed onions and garlic. I think the additions and substitutions made it a five - added a lot of flavor.

Deliciously rich and flavorful.  Because I used my own crushed tomatoes put up from my garden, there was no need to use any sugar.  I also used homemade chicken broth. Creamy and fresh tasting, we just loved this, and hubs even helped himself to a rare second helping!  With all these good fresh ingredients, what's not to like?

Who knew such a simple recipe could be sooo good?  Yum.  I cut the butter by 2 TB (6 TB instead of 8) and used 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c cream instead of all cream.  This was fabulous.  Tastes like the tomato basil bisque from a bistro we love.  I'm pretty sure my husband had 3 bowls of it.  Definitely try it!

Quick and very simple. I did not use the full amount of cream asked for, just enough to make it creamy.....maybe a quarter cup or so? Great with a toasted sandwich when you're feeling a little down on a Saturday afternoon. The kids had seconds they liked it so much.

A few people mentioned that the soup curdled.  This can certainly happen with cream/milk based acidic soups.  I found the best solution to the curdling problem is to substitute canned evaporated milk for the  fresh milk or cream called for in the recipe.    I loved this recipe.  There was a lot of flavor for very little work.  I know I will make it again during the long and cold Minnesota winter  ahead.  Thanks Sarah.

There's nothing like homemade tomato soup and this was no exception. I started off knowing I didn't want a creamy soup - just a plain tomato basil soup so I started out knowing I wasn't going to be putting the butter or cream in... I did add 1 Tbsp. of minced garlic, 1 tsp. of vinegar, 2 tsp. of sugar, along with some salt & pepper. This was done in no time and it was delicious - perfect with grilled cheese!

AMAZING!  This is just like my favorite soup at a restaurant.  I will never again pay for this soup, I can make it at home!!!  I doubled the basil, used vegetable broth, and milk instead of cream.  I also halved the amount of butter.  Delicious!

My family LOVES this recipe!  Even those who would not eat tomato soup.  I have made this three times already and they are so excited when they find out I'm making it.  I did add pepper and fresh basil is a must!  Serve with crusty French bread.

It was very good, I just didn't like the fresh basil -only because I don't think i chopped it up small enough. Next time I will put it in the blender with a a little bit of the tomatoes to get it ground up very well and then put it all together.

An excellent soup as it is, and perfect for adding your own touch to it.  I made this last night for dinner, leaving the recipe as is (was also cooking for someone who prefers food on the "bland" side).  It turned out just fine, but today I decided to tweak it a little and have some soup for lunch.  I sauteed some red onion, garlic... then I decided I would add some of my dad's homemade blackberry wine.  I thought it turned out absolutely delicious. I would make this again.

I thought this was delicious.  I read other reviews and added about 3 Tbsp of sugar to cut the tartness and used dried basil since I didn't have fresh.  We also made Pillsbury bread sticks with Parmesan cheese and that was perfect to dip in the soup.

This sounds like a great recipe, can't wait to try it, but I will use diced canned tomatoes to supplement frozen peeled & seeded tomatoes from my garden. & puree the soup. The recipe says 'whipping cream' & you should always use 'it' in any soup or sauce recipe calling for cream, because it never separates or curdles. Lighter creams will. Carnation milk is a substitute, but will slightly alter the taste.

My daughter loves tomato soup and grilled cheese.  We have a local place that has pepper jack tomato soup.  So i added one cup of shredded pepper jack cheese and used milk instead cream.  Yummy yummy a new favorite in our house.

I use to eat Campbell's tomato soup not anymore! I love this one. I made as is the first time and LOVED it. Some say they cut back on the butter/margarine. The second time I made it I used 1/4 cup which is half a stick and still tasted great!

Great Soup!  I followed both the recipe and suggestions of other reviewers. I used Carnation Evaporated milk instead of cream; added minced garlic (4 cloves); used SmartBalance butter blend ; I completely left out any sugar;I also added one can of tomato paste; oregeno and black pepper; I also used a container of Progresso Chicken Stock ( 320z) and about a TBS of chicken boulion granuals instead of the can of chicken broth. Served with bread(Italian/Herb).  Made a Perfect Lunch on this cold/windy day!

I had never had homemade tomato soup before, and this was pretty good.  My mom, who loves tomato soup, said this was amazing.  You can easily cut back the amount of butter if you are watching calories.

This soup is just amazing.  I cut the buttter down to 3Tbs. I have made this so many times, with and without the sugar. I have found that if you are icluding a diabetic anytime, you have to compensate for them. This is a houshold favorite! Thanks Sara!!

Usually the reviews are spot-on on this site, but I'm surprised this recipe got such rave reviews.  I made it exactly as specified and ended up with a bland, chunky, watery mess of a soup.  

I was able to save it with SIGNIFICANT alterations:  doubled the basil, added oregano, red pepper flakes, lots of salt and pepper, and 1/2 cup freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese.

Also, it is crucial that you put this sauce in a food processor / blender to get the right consistency of a smooth, creamy soup.

The above gave it a lot more flavor, a thicker consistency, and the blender step is crucial for if you don't want chunks of tomato and pieces of basil leaves in the soup.  Blending it evens out the flavor and texture.

Turned out great- but people should know that this is just a base recipe- you have to do a lot to get it to be a great soup.

This worked with tweaking- I added a finely chopped onion that I saute with the margerine right off the bat, and then I follow the directions as stated except that I also add red pepper flakes for some spice and I use a lot more brown sugar. I continually get asked for the recipe, and it is SO quick and easy to throw together (and double).

I would love to give this 4 1/2 stars. It was a wonderful base recipe, and I recommend it. My only issue was how thin it was, despite the heavy cream AND butter.

This recipe is easy and fast.  I used an immersion blender, which the recipe did not specify, but the photo looks like a pureed soup, not chunky.  I used canned diced tomato and added a bit of some fresh tomatoes, just since I had them.  I also added 1 large clove of garlic and 1 small onion, sauteed in a bit of olive oil.  I substituted 1 cup of 2% milk for the whipping cream and cut butter down to 1/4 cup, just to cut the fat in the recipe, still VERY VERY good.  Next time I will add more basil, just because we really LOVE basil.

I have made this recipe and used Italian Tomatoe instead of regular ones. I usually add a bit of garlic and basil. When serving I serve with shredded cheese. Very good - especially with grilled cheese sandwiches

YUMMY!  I can't believe how easy it is and yet it yields amazing results.  I added orzo pasta to mine to make it a bit more hardier.  Other than that, followed it completely.

Wow, this one is good!  I have made the Nordy's Cafe one for a few years, but this one tastes just  about as good and is half the work!  I reduced the butter by half and substituted half n half for the cream.  ***The recipe as is:  209 cal. /14.6 g fat per serving If you substitute half n half for the heavy whipping cream and reduce the butter to 1/4 cup it is: 160 cal / 8 g fat.

Gave it a 4 star because I tweeked it to give it a lower fat content as I'm trying to lose weight. I didn't have whipping cream so I just used 1% milk. I used vine tomatoes and roasted it with some garlic cloves before following the rest of the directions. I used 3t of margarine instead of 1/2 cup and made a roux first. Some days, easy and comforting food is all it takes to turn a frown upside down.

Wow! This basil tomato soup has simple and fresh ingredients but the results are just wonderful! I had to scale this back to suit two people tonight. I used fresh roma tomatoes which I blanched in hot water for 30 seconds. I set them aside to cool awhile and then removed the skin and crushed them with my hands. I added 1 cup of chicken broth and a handful of fresh basil, minced. I omitted the sugar and cut the butter in half to 1/4 cup. I also added a half pint of heavy whipping cream. I brought the soup up to a  boil and added the chicken broth and basil. I lowered it to a simmer then stirred in the cream and butter. This is a deliciously fresh and creamy soup! I did not need to add sugar, salt or any seasonings. It was good just as is. I loved it! I served this lovely soup with, "Tomato Bacon Grilled Cheese," and "Grilled SPAM, Tomato, Cheddar Cheese, and Sweet Onion Sandwiches," all from this website.

Delicious! My modifications: Used 6 medium-sized tomatoes, chopped and crushed (instead of canned). Didn't have fresh basil; used 1T dried. No sugar. Added 1 6oz can tomato paste. 1 cup of milk (didn't have cream); reduced the butter to 1/4 cup. Seasoned with just a tiny pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper.

We made this to go with some tomato/mozzarella panini and we found the end result to be good - but very rich.  I would suggest replacing some of the cream with milk.  I followed the lead of some other reviewers by sauteeing onion with garlic before adding the tomato puree.

With a few additions, this soup reminds me of the Tomato Basil soup at Nordstrom's cafe.  I cut the recipe in half to see if this was to my liking before I made a full batch. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and I found that it was a bit bland for my taste. My alterations were that I doubled the sugar, added a couple of pinches of salt, some fresh cracked pepper, extra basil, and a sprinkle of parm atop. My 18 year old son who has an opinion about everything said it was good which means it earned its 5 star rating.  Will make a full batch moving forward.

Very simple and very easy to make .. My family and I started a tradition 3 years ago we call Meatless Monday .. so in honor of this I used vegetable broth instead of the chicken.  and as with the other reviews I cut down on the amount of butter and used half whipping cream and milk.  Will definitely make again

Great recipe.  I used fresh vine tomatoes to replace one of the cans of tomatoes; added dried oregano, dried basil along with the fresh basil, fresh diced garlic, and garlic powder.  I just used 3 Tbsp. of butter, but added a bit more chicken broth.  The end result was delicious!  I never liked tomato soup until now!

absolutely AMAZING! i made exactly according to recipe and was delicious but very fatty.  I plan on making it again with half and half instead of just cream an will cut the butter in half.  I also used fresh sweet basil from my garden which was delicious but i thought 18 leaves of it was a bit much (maybe i just have large basil) so i plan on using only about 12 next time...will also be adding some drained diced tomatoes and a sauteed medium onion next time because i like chunky soup.  Great recipe overall!!

UPDATE***I realized after reviewing this recipe that I made an error when following the directions.  I only used ONE 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  When I realized my error, I tried the recipe again with the corrected ingredients (and my own modifications) and it was INEDIBLE! It tasted like pasta sauce.  Don't get me wrong...I love pasta! But not as a soup.  Only use one 28 oz can and it is delicious (it will also look exactly like the picture).  Also, make sure to wait to add the cream until the mixture has stopped bubbling and cooled a little.  The first time I made this, I added the cream right after reducing the heat and the soup was so hot that it cooked the cream, making the soup very gritty (but still tasty..that's how good this soup is!)  This soup is definitely worth a try! I make it on an almost weekly basis (doubling the recipe) and freeze it in individual bowls for a quick lunch on the run.

Delicious!  This is tea room quality!  I made it for my husband last night.  He was licking his bowl clean.  I know it's a good meal when he tilts the bowl or plate up to his mouth to scrape the remnants in.  I changed the whipping cream to heavy cream and pureed my tomatoes, but I otherwise stuck to the recipe given.  I don't like chunky soup, and the diced tomatoes were still too big for my taste, so I pureed them in a food processor to make them more of a sauce.  That's just how I like it.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

Great recipe!! I came across it because I was looking for soups that were not chunky because I just got braces and right now it hurts to eat anything solid. I did do a few changes b/c of what others wrote. I used fat free milk instead of the cream, and I did not have fresh basil so I used dry, and I added garlic powder (which made it smell so good and also made it taste really good). Thanks for posting this recipe!! Will continue to make it even after I get used to the braces! :)

Very good soup, the only thing I would suggest is, after cooking is done, put in a blender in small amounts, I liked the creamy texture much better than the lumpy texture it was before blending.. Also, Don't be afraid to add more fresh basil to your taste....

Delicious and so easy. The grocery store didn't have fresh basil and my plant in the backyard is done for this year, so I used about 2 tsp of dried basil and it was fine. I also cut the butter by about half and it was still rich and creamy. Served for a light supper with broiled honeycrisp apple and cheddar open faced sanwiches on olive bread. So good! Thanks!

Super easy and tasty. I used silken tofu instead of the whipping cream to cut down on the fat and add more protein. The soup was made for a friend with stage 4 cancer who is no longer able to eat solid food. The tofu gives her more protein and nutrients to keep her strength up.

This was a good base tomato soup recipe. But it was definately lacking some flavor. Sort of tasted like I was eating the canned tomato's with a little cream added. Have some leftover will use for lunch and add some other ingredients until we like it.

I made this once & it was good -- nothing hugely special, but good on a cold day with a grilled cheese sandwich.  I used one 28oz. can of pureed tomatoes, and one 28oz. can of diced tomatoes (which I crushed).  Substituted half & half for heavy cream and reduced butter to 4 Tablespoons, didn't miss it -- still very rich!  I added garlic powder, onion powder, & pepper to taste!

I really like the simplicity of this soup. I used tomatoes from the garden, which I blended smooth. I also used half the cream and about a third of the butter, and I simplified the prep by tossing the basil and cream in the blender before adding it to the simmering tomatoes. This was a bit tangy, probably because of the reduced cream and butter, but it really allowed the tomatoes to shine through. It was also a bit thin because of the fresh tomatoes, but that's OK. Next time, I'll add more basil.

This soup tasted really bitter and acidic, I ended up adding 3 tbsps of brown sugar to balance it out. I used only 2 tbsps butter and a can of fat free evaporated milk for the cream. I also added garlic, onion powder and pepper. Really though it just tasted like canned tomatoes and I bought expensive Italian canned tomatoes since they were to be the star of this recipe, my son did like it with lots of parmesan cheese on top.

Way too much cream in this soup! I'd cut it by half at least or use milk. I didn't add the basil because I wanted more tomato flavor to come through, but the cream really dulls the tomato flavor.

Too bland for me. After one taste I added garlic salt and pepper. Then it was pretty good. Thought it needed more basil. I would have liked a creamier texture. I would definitely add salt, pepper and jalapenos if I made it again.

Easy to make!  I halved the recipe, used 3 TBSP of butter, used 1% milk, added a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and added minced onions and garlic.  I fried the onions and garlic in the butter on low for about 5 minutes before adding them, the milk and the rest of the butter to the soup.  The soup was amazing and restaurant quality.

This was a great recipe.  I made a lowfat version though, using evaporated milk instead of whipping cream and 1/2 the amount of margarine.  I also, like other reviewers, used fresh tomatoes, added salt, pepper, onions, and garlic.  Wonderful soup with some crusty bread!

I used to hate tomato soup but I decided to try this one on a whim. I'm a tomato soup convert now! Great recipe. I added crushed red pepper but that's because I like everything spicy.

Im not normally one to stray to far away from the recipe, I like to try it first, then tweak it.  However, I had no clue as to wear to start to make tomatoe soup.  This one was given the best reviews, and I tweek it according to that.  I sauteed onion and garlic first in a little olive oil and spray.  Then added the tomatoes and the broth like it says.  Added the sugar and fresh basil.  I however only used about 1tbs of butter and I used 1% condensed milk.  It would've been way to fatty for me because Im Weight Watchers.  But I got a huge batch of soup and just sampled it and its really a beautiful soup.  I can only imagine how wonderful it is with full fat.  At my own preference I used a blender to blend it up and make it less chunky.  But still beautiful, just gonna make the grill cheese to go with it.  Thank you very much for sharing this recipe, giving a base to a beginner soup maker :)

I made it exactly as is (since I don't like taking a recipe and completely re-doing it and then rating!) and it was wonderful. I will for sure make it again!

Super simple. I used less butter as other recommended. Extra sugar for personal taste. Next time I might add pesto. Hope it freezes well.

I made this for myself and my hubby and he LOVED it!!! I thought it was good, but a little acidic, so next time I will add a bit more sugar and/or butter to cut that down. Other than that, it was super easy and quick to make! I only had one can of crushed tomatoes, so I added a can of tomato sauce and it was still great! thanks for the recipe

All I had was diced tomatoes, so I pureed them in the Vitamix, used fresh chicken broth, and I also added more sugar (turbinado) to cut the acidity of the tomato puree. Turned out wonderfully!

Omg deelish!  I cut the butter in half and used what I had on hand (vegetable broth instead of chicken, dried basil instead of fresh) and it was terrific!  I've already made it twice, a definite keeper!  Gracias! :)

This soup was so good and so easy!  I did make some adjustments.  To start, I sauteed some garlic in olive oil in my dutch oven before adding the crushed tomatoes.  I increased the sugar to one and half tsp, instead of just one tsp.  I used 3/4 cup of whipping cream and only two tbls of butter.  Also added salt and pepper to taste.  My husband and I ate grilled cheese with this soup and it was the ultimate comfort supper!!!

I read the recipe and immediatly new i wanted to substitute the heavy cream for light cream or half and half and use half the amount of margerine for a healthier approach.  I also added salt and pepper to taste.  I served it with parm. cheese for those who wanted too add a splash more of flavor and it was a big hit.

I hate changing a recipe before trying it, but I always read the reviews so after doing that I opted for the half & half instead of cream & reducing the butter (I used real) to 6 Tbs. I added black pepper & some garlic powder as well. When it was done I ended up putting the rest of the butter in, as it helps the strong tomato flavor become more subtle & helps bring out the flavor of the basil. My husband and I really enjoyed it & it's so easy to make! If you enjoy the basil tomato soups in restaurants you've got to make this. It's a keeper & so easy!

I love this soup!  I made some alterations but they were not necessary to make this soup delicious.  I've made it several times and experimented with it to make it healthier.  Basically, this is a great base recipe and you can alter it to fit your needs.  Recently I've made it with 1/4 cup cream and 3/4 cup skim milk to cut out some calories, and it was great!  I also only use 3 tbsp of butter.  I add sauteed garlic and chopped onions if I have them.  The fresh basil is great, but I've used the dried basil too and it's also good!

This recipe turned out awesome.  My husband and I liked the chunkiness of the soup with the crushed tomatoes.  I used half the butter due to other reviews, might even reduce it a bit more next time.  I split the recipe in 2 before adding the basil and then added basil to one and dill to the other half.  Both were delicious.

This was really easy to make and very good! Not exactly like my favorite restaurant one, but way better than canned tomato! :-) I didn't have the cream so used skim milk so it wasn't very creamy...and didn't have the crushed tomatoes so I "made" some with the canned diced and stewed I had (reminder to use the blender next time...not the food processor!) I think the little bit of celery and onion in the canned tomatoes gave it an interesting flavor too. definitely a keeper!

This was good but I'd like to play around with it a bit to suit my tastes. Doubled the sugar but still would have liked a slightly sweeter soup. Don't skip out on the fresh basil - the flavor is amazing! I also used half and half and less butter than the recipe called for and it was still good. I'd make this again since it's so easy & better than boring canned soup!

This was an excellent soup, although I made some modifications.  I used tomato puree instead of crushed tomatoes, 2 cups of homemade chicken broth instead of canned, 6 oz. container of low fat plain yogurt instead of whipping cream, and left the butter out entirely.  Delicious and healthy too!

FANTASTIC. I was scared to put 18 basil leaves into this soup but the basil makes it. The more basil the better. Absolutely fabulous. Added a bit of sugar to contrast the tangyness of the tomatoes.
UPDATE - I've made this a few times and recently there was a lack of fresh basil in Memphis. I couldn't very well make this without basil so I grabbed the best freeze-dried basil I could find in the spice isle and had to use the entire bottle (I would guesstimate that 1 teaspoon of finely chopped dried basil = 1 fresh basil leaf). Again, I was scared about this so I stopped to taste every few spoonfulls but did not regret using the entire bottle.

DELICOUS!!  I just made this last night for my boyfriend and we both loved it!  I did modify the recipe a little as followed: Added 1/2 of a small onion chopped, 2 cloves of garlic minced & chopped 1 whole roasted red pepper (jarred).  I sautéed the onion & garlic in butter for 5 minutes & dumped it in a blender along with the roasted pepper & crushed tomatoes for a minute before transferring to the pot.  Lastly, I didn't have fresh basil, so I used Crushed tomatoes w/basil & added additional dried basil.  Mmmm, I can’t wait to have some leftovers for lunch.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very good and easy.  I made it 5 star by browning some garlic and diced onions in 2 tbls of butter first, and adding 3/4 cup of shredded carrot to that before adding all of it to the soup.  Delicious!

This is a good soup, but a little unhealthy as is. The brand of crushed tomatos is really important, also, because they carry the flavor of the soup. The first time I made this, I used Cento and either Tuttorosso or Sclafani, and it was delicious! The next time, I used Bionature, and it was much blander, and not as chunky and rich. I also used 4 tbs of butter, and thought this was more than enough. Half and half, milk, or even ricotta work well as a substitute for the heavy cream.

Very good. I made this with the following modifications which yielded a very robust and savory flavor: I sauteed one small chopped onion in a tablespoon of butter for a few minutes before adding the other ingredients. I also added some chopped fresh parsley in addition to the basil, 2 teaspoons of garlic salt, a pinch of red pepper flakes, sea salt and black pepper to taste, and let it cook with a stalk of celery in the pot, which I threw away when it was done. I will definitely make this again, but next time will use a little less butter.

I made this soup for about 200 people as part of a take home lunch. We sent it home in to go cups to drink with warm fresh bread.  I made it in roasters just about an hour before we started serving and was WONDERFUL!!!  Many of the attendees asked for the recipe later.  I make it at home often.  Thanks : )

Delicious soup!!! For a lower fat, lower calorie alternative, substitute fat-free half and half for the heavy cream. Add 1 tsp. of salt to compensate.

It is almost perfect. I just could not give it 5 stars because it calls for way to much butter. I actually had oil sitting on the top after it sat. Next time I make it, I'm using about half the butter. But over all, it is super easy and very tasty.

This soup is very easy and very awesome!  I followed the advice of others and made a few changes because I like a lot of flavor.  I added sauteed garlic and onion, doubled the sugar and basil, and added some salt, pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasonings.

I tweaked this recipe quite a bit using previous reviews and my own additions, but I still wanted to rate it and give it a 5 because it was a great starting point for making my own tomato soup instead of the can. I used the previous review suggestions of cutting back on the cream and butter. Those were both great ideas. Anymore of either of those would have been too much. I also took the idea of sauteeing onions and garlic in the pan before adding the tomatoes and broth further, adding celery and carrots for a mire poix. I hit it with the immersion blender at the end. My husband and I both really loved it.

Perfect complement with grilled cheese sandwiches. I found the flavor a little bland as well, so like another reviewer, I added more basil leaves, salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. It's so easy to make, I'll definitely be making this again!

I made this as directed, and my husband and I both hated it. Way too salty. I am not sure what went wrong, but I would not recommend taking the time to make this. Might as well eat soup from a can.

I was looking for something quick and easy to make on our honeymoon. This was perfect! I didn't change anything except for the servings we wanted it to yield.  It was delicious served with grilled cheese. Perfect for a cold, winter's day. It's going into my personal cookbook!

used 4 fresh tomatoes (going bad in the fridge!) and halved the rest of the ingredients -- used whole milk instead of cream.  also added a heap of minced garlic, some minced onion and black pepper.  pureed it in my blender.  i hate tomato soup from a can, but fresh is soooo yummy AND this was easy :)     UPDATE:  still great!  added lowfat sour cream to my bowl and was perfect -- and my 15-month-old couldnt get enough either!

This was good.  It seemed to be missing something (maybe it was the tomatoes we used).  We doubled the sugar and added some onion powder and it seemed to help.  I don't think it needs quite as much butter as it calls for.  I'll probably half the butter next time.

Really quick and easy!  At first I left out the sugar, as some reviewers commented that they didn't like the sweet flavor it gave the soup.  I don't like my tomato soup with a sweet flavor either, but I tasted it and found it was too acidic.  The small amount of sugar called for in the recipe didn't make it sweet to me, but it did take the edge off the acidic flavor.  I thought it was wonderful - served with a grilled cheese sandwich on sourdough bread - mmmmmm!

I think it has potential, but need to tweak it. I felt like I was eating a can of crushed tomatoes. I need it to have a more blended mellow flavor.

I made this recipe because of the rave reviews it received, as well as because it was a request from a client/friend. I too tweaked it a bit, thank you so much for the wonderful recipe! I added half a white onion chopped and sauteed in olive oil with kosher salt and black pepper, I added that to the soup and let it simmer, I didn't add butter, I figured that the olive oil from the sautee would be good enough. I also didn't use heavy cream, I added about 3/4 cup of whole milk instead. Everybody is trying to lose weight ugh, oh well, it still came out absolutely wonderful. Rave reviews from my clientelle.

This was my first time ever making homemade tomato soup, and I was super pleased with the results! I made this exactly as written, except for cutting back a bit on the butter. I served this with grilled cheese sandwiches (classic combo) for dipping. The whole family enjoyed this one! Will be making this again! thanks for sharing. :)

This soup is awesome!  I did also tweak things a bit.  Like others suggested I sauteed 1 large garlic clove in the butter and used my hand held blender to make a smooth soup.  Also to make sure that the soup doesn't curdle I added about a 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  It doesn't change the taste of the soup but if you add cold milk to hot tomatoes it may curdle.  That was the only change I made other then adding some salt and pepper.  You can't go wrong with this very easy recipe.

This is excellent as is, but I've also made it differently with great success as well. I tend not to add a full can of broth as that makes the soup a lot thinner than I prefer. I also use dried basil rather than fresh as that's a lot easier and I haven't noticed a significant difference in taste. I substitute half and half--regular not fat free--for whipping cream and use about half the butter. I also start this recipe by melting the butter, putting in several tablespoons of minced garlic and browning it, adding a couple tablespoons of flour to thicken the soup, and then adding in the rest of the ingredients. I also like spicy things and this recipe is quite good with a significant amount of crushed red pepper. In short, you can change this recipe a little or a lot, and it always turns out well and is super quick and a crowd pleaser. Most people will say, "I don't like tomato soup, but..." It's a good but.

Easy, delicious soup for summertime.  I'm a vegetarian so I used veggie broth rather than chicken broth and I didn't have whipping cream so I used milk instead.  other than that I kept to the recipe and served this soup with a side salad and some warm french bread, which made for a really lovely lunch.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made half the portion, and found it nice but not what I was hoping for. I was dreaming of a rich, creamy soup (as in the photo) but either the acidity of the tomatoes or the freshness of my 1/2&1/2 was against me and I had a sort of dotted look.  To fight this I added a large dollop of sour cream and a tablespoon of sugar.  It was delicious and I'm going to build my next dinner menu around it. Next time I'll try to start with sour cream as the base dairy (rather than 1/2&1/2) and then add cream on top...

I wasn't too impressed right after making this, but it definitely is better after chilling for several hours.  I followed others' advice- added s&p, doubled the sugar, subbed half and half for heavy cream, and immersion blended.  I will make this again.

Such an easy and delicious soup!  I can even make 1/2 a recipe for just my husband and I, and I have some leftover for lunch the next day.  Next time I make it I think I will also try some fresh tomato in it instead of just canned tomatoes

I made this recipe (served with a grilled cheese sandwich) for a group of men golfers for the lunch special and it got RAVE reviews! I doubled the recipe using the 32 oz carton of broth instead of cans, and added the sauteed onions and garlic that some others had suggested.  I didn't have enough fresh basil, so I also added a couple of tablespoons of dried basil leaves, and used 1/2 &1/2 instead of cream.  The 'boys' absolutely loved it. I've never been much of a fan of tomato soup, but I have to say, I absolutely loved it too! I will definitely use this recipe again.

Yummy soup!  I doubled the recipe, and added 1 more cup (3 altogether) of cream, a couple extra basil (chopped) leaves; 1 more Tbsp of sugar, a huge sauté shallot (butter, salt and pepper) and finely chopped garlic w/olive oil.  

These additions make the soup 5 star...also, I used all the butter in recipe...the richer the better :)

Absolutely delicious! I used half fresh tomatoes chopped, which gave the soup more texture. I also added some salt and freshly ground pepper. I will definitely be making this again.

Yummy. I did omit cream and used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and cut the butter by half also. Still very good.

Best Tomato Soup ever!  To Mediterranean-ize, just switch the butter for olive oil, and chicken broth for vegetable broth.  Wonderful!

If you are cutting the recipe in half be careful not to put the whole can of chicken broth in!
I had to Dr it up a bit with extra sugar & milk,  but still very good.  Also, I only used 1 teaspoon of dried basil & was plenty for me.  Will make it again & re-review it.  :-)

This soup is very simple but fabulous! My sister, who normally won't eat vegetables, loves this soup.  I never have fresh basil on hand, but dried worked wonderfully, too.  It's much cheaper! I can never bring myself to put in the full amount of butter (watching my weight) so I just put in 2 T or so.  Wonderful recipe!

This was very good!  I used milk to cut the fat and half of the butter and it was delicious.  I also sometimes add parmeasan with the milk and allow it to melt as well....delish!

I made this soup last nite and it was really good. I added some sauteed onions, finely chopped and also sauteed some garlic. I used milk instead of cream and added 3-4 tbsp of sugar. I also didn't have fresh basil so I used dry, about 2 tbsp. I also cut the butter way down. I think I only used about 2 tbsp. And at the very end I added about 1/2 cup of  crumbled feta. It was a very good soup that even got a thumbs up from one of my toughest critics, my husband.

Really good but needs a little something more to cut the acidity.  Maybe a little honey or slightly more suger?

This is a good base recipe but it is very bland. After reading other reviews I only put in 6 tbsp of butter. To give it more personality I added 2 tsp crushed red pepper and 1 clove garlic. I used 6 tsp dried basil instead of fresh leaves and I added 2 tsp sugar instead of 1. Then I added salt and fresh ground pepper to taste. I also ran the whole thing through a food processor for a little while on low and that distributed the chunks/thickened it up nicely. Yum! I'll probably throw in some chopped up onion or something next time as well.

All I had was diced tomatoes, so I pureed them in the Vitamix, used fresh chicken broth, and I also added more sugar (turbinado) to cut the acidity of the tomato puree. Turned out wonderfully!

Amazing soup! I added 1/2 a chopped onion and 1 clove garlic for extra flavor, and halved the amount of butter. Delicious, restaurant quality tomato soup.

This soup is fantastic. The first time I made it I followed he directions to a tea, and it was a bit too salty but everyone that ate it loved it. I then made it again for a family holiday party. I ended up cooking it up in th crock pot and just letting it continue to heat up instead of making it on the stove. I also did not add any whipping cream and only put about 2tbsp of butter in - this is also for a doubled recipe. I added 4 garlic cloves, a teensy bit of milk, and a chopped onion and it was fantatic. Everyone that tried it LOVED it. Great soup to make originally how the recipe sates or to make your own variations!

Comes out pretty good.  Upped sugar to 1T dropped 1T of butter and used Fat Free half & half instead of whipping cream.  I think running the whole mixture through a blender is a good idea.  I also think 2T of sugar wouldn't hurt.  In addition I added some red pepper, black pepper, sea salt, & some Italian seasoning.

Always a hit...Very simple, quick and delicious. I used vegetable broth for my vegetarian son and evaporated low fat milk to lighten it up.. I'm having it now with a grilled cheese sandwich, it's raining and I couldn't be happier

The tomatoes were too acidic, so instead of 1 tspn of sugar i ended up using 5 tspns. I added salt, fresh ground pepper, dried basil, italian seasoning, garlic powder. It was very good.
UPDATE:  I had a lot of friends who were sick this Christmas, so instead of cookies I gave them a quart of this soup in a canning jar; after all, it does have the Christmas colors of red and green in it! Merry Christmas!

I use dried basil rather than fresh- just because it's cheaper and I always have it on hand. (Put it in early rather than later.)  Also, I only use about half as much butter as the recipe calls for.  LOVE it. Tasty topped with cheese! :)

This recipe is okay. It should be blended a little. It was lacking something just not sure what. Maybe cheese or crunch. I may try again but will make changes.

Very good.  I increased sugar to 2 Tb and substituted half and half for the heavy cream.   Also added a dollop of light sour cream before serving.  Very easy and quick to make.

Excellent!  I am very picky about tomato soup and and this went beyond my expectations. I customized it a little, I went with the 3 tbls. Of butter I added rosemary chives and garlic and sauteed onions.well done!

Delicious recipe! However, I changed a few things about it. My Mom is an avid canner and I've watched and helped her make and can tomato soup ever since I was little. Well now I am in the military, moved away and married. So I bought about 14 roma tomatoes, quartered and pitted them (since I'm not a fan of store canned foods), placed them in my Bullet blender until smooth and poured them in my pot and cooked the rest of the recipe as directed, except that I used a previous suggestion for 6 Tbsp of butter. Absolutely Loved it and my husband loved it even more. Tasted just like the Applebees tomato soup! Great fresh flavor!

I used vegetable broth, only 5 tablespoons of butter (plenty of flavor) and half and half instead of (heavy) whipping cream. I used basil from my garden, added salt and pepper. Overall, a nice tomato soup. However, the cream crurdled a little (I did temper it before adding to the soup.) I will make this again, but will try to figure out the curdling thing.

Used 3lbs of ripe fresh tomatoes and 2 cups of homemade chicken broth.  Didn't have fresh basil, so I used about 1/8 cup of dried basil.  We enjoyed it and will make it again.

this was a good soup, however only giving it 3 starts because i think i tweaked it too much from original to be a fair rating.  i added more fresh basil than called for also added real butter while it was simmering.  added crushed red pepper flakes to jack it up a little...  in the end, it was very good, took it to work and got lots of compliments but in the end, it was a completely different soup.  will use it as a base and run with it from there...

OH, MY GOSH!!!  This soup is out of this world!  I'm not even a big tomato soup fan, but this is so delicious.  It freezes well, so when it's a cold day, and you want some warm soup, just thaw it out and eat it up!  YUM!!!

Very easy...made it the night before and put it in a crockpot for a luncheon the next day.  Everyone raved about it!  Followed the advice of others and cut the butter and used half and half instead of cream.  Wonderful homemade soup!

This was delicious. I added 4 tsp of dried basil leaves and then pureed the soup when it was done to give it a creamy consistency. I think it would be just as good with milk and served with a crunchy bread. Mmm.

So easy and delicious!  I didn't have whipping cream so I used skim milk and I cut back on the butter by half. I also made it smooth by using a stick blender.  Came out smooth and creamy.  Will deifinitley make this again!

My mom and I have been making this soup for years. We like to add equal parts tomato juice and chicken broth for more flavor. Love it! Also, I don't think the sugar is needed. The longer you simmer the crushed tomatoes, tomato juice and broth, the better!

This was a delicious, easy, basic soup that would make a great base for "additions".  My 10 year old who is not fond of tomato soup said, "It's not good- but it IS the best I have ever had."  Then he ate two bowls.  We thought of adding things like pepperoni, mushrooms, peppers, and mozzarella for a pizza type soup.  Also thought it would be delicious with Italian sausage or Spinach.  However, it is tasty as is and we will be making this again and again.  PS, I was out of butter and switched to veggie broth as I needed the dish to be vegetarian for this meal.  It turned out just fine.

I used half regular tomatoes and half stewed tomatoes with onion, celery, and green peppers (Del Monte brand) I did slice these up which took and extra minute or two but it was worth it. As it was cooking I mashed the tomatoes with a spatula with holes in it...kinda got rid off the big chunks. I used dry basil leaves since I didn't have any fresh. I used half the butter called for and used a 50/50 mix of 1% milk and cream. Salt and peppered to taste, a little minced garlic and dash of paprika. Then added a touch of cornstarch to thicken the soup just a bit. Wonderfully delicious and super easy. Perfect with a toasty grilled cheese!

I think with this recipe if you like a lot of basil, then by all means double the amount.  If you want mostly tomato with a slight hint of basil, keep it the same.  It's very versatile!  (I am a double-basil kinda gal!)  I used fat free half & half and dropped the butter to 6 T (to cut calories) and it was still great!  I loved how quick and easy this was.   Also that it has texture due to the crushed tomatoes.  If your soup turns out bitter, it's because of the quality of the canned tomatoes - not the recipe.  But also, that's what the sugar is for.  I added fresh grated parmesan to the top of my bowls.

This was a hard one to review.  I gave it 4 stars, quite good and easy, my wife(who doesn't like tomato soup) gave it 5+ and wants more, my son(who loves tomato soup)  had one bowl and asked me not to make it again.  Next time I think I'll drain the tomato's and use less chicken broth to help thicken it a bit.  On the + side, it was much better the next day.

I hosted Christmas this year and wanted a 'light' lunch to serve and decided this soup would work with a grilled cheese.  It was a hit!  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I did use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whipping cream and half the butter called for to reduce the fat and added cayenne pepper to kick it up a bit.  VERY easy.

Very easy and simple to make. Taste was very good (has a bit of a sweet/sour taste). The amount it makes according to the recipe is very little, so I would next time just double the ingredients.

this turned out pretty well! i changed some things until it tasted right to me. i didnt have canned crushed tomatoes so i used canned stewed tomatoes, and chopped them up before i boiled them with the chicken broth. I also used dried basil since i didnt have fresh. After the butter melted, the soup was kind of thin and tasted a little too bland. so added a little salt, and about a tablespoon of tomato paste. I let it boil for about 10 more minutes on medium heat to thicken it up. Some of the melted butter was floating to the top and almost looked like olive oil, so used a spoon to take some out (im watching my diet, and my idea of tomato soup doesn't look so good with a layer of butter on top!!) i ended up taking out about 2 tablespoons of butter (so if you dont like too much butter like me, dont waste the butter and only put in like 6 tablespoons instead of a whole stick) After this it tasted delicious! i made it with grilled cheese mmmmm

While enjoying a bowl this soup for lunch, left over from last night, I thought I should review it.  It is delicious!  And so easy, too.  I made it pretty much as written, adding only a few red pepper flakes.  I did add some salt & pepper, but I used no salt added tomatoes and low salt chicken broth.  That way, I can add only the amount of salt I want!  We topped the soup with garlic & butter croutons and had it with grilled cheese sandwiches!  Wonderful comfort food for a snowy evening.

wasn't for me.  Too heavy- could taste the cream too much.  I prefer a "veggie" soup and save the creamy for dessert.

Great Base to start for a super simple delicious soup! I only used 2 cans (14.5 oz) of diced tomatoes and kept all of the rest of the measurements the same.  Once the tomatoes were simmered, I used an immersion blender for a smoother soup.  I turned it Vegan by using unsweetened almond milk, vegable broth and omitting the butter. I did add salt and pepper to taste.  Low cal and no additives!

This was a hit!  I reduced the butter to 3 Tablespoons as others had recommended and added a bit of onion powder and garlic powder.  The fresh basil was wonderful without being overpowering.

I definitely had to tweak this one a lot. Maybe it is due to my personal taste, but the soup needed more depth of flavor. I added things like garlic and and different seasonings to take up a notch. Since the recipe is so simple, I will keep this on in my recipe box.

Perfect addition to my soup recipe collection!  I loved that this recipe required pantry staples and came together very quickly.  With the addition of 1 clove garlic and 1 shallot, sauteed in a little butter prior to adding the tomatoes and broth, this easily rivals any tomato bisque I have had in a restaurant.  I also substituted diced canned tomatoes and ran my immersion blender through prior to adding the cream.  Thanks for a great recipe, Sarah!

This is, hands down, the best tomato soup recipe I've ever made. I usually tweak every recipe, but not this one. It needs no tweaking. And it's simple and quick. Add a grilled cheese sandwich and it doesn't get any better when I'm looking for a quick dinner on a cold evening.

This was a fast and easy recipe. I added a bit more sugar to sweeten up a bit. Very good with cheddar cheese on top.

This was excellent. I modified a bit by sautéing some diced onions and garlic and then dropped in some fresh garlic. I added 3 teaspoons of sugar instead of one and used half and half instead of cream. Salt, pepper, and a dash of cayenne spiced it up and I puréed it in the blender when it was finished simmering to give it a somewhat creamier texture. This is my official go-to for tomato soup!

We don't add butter, add less cream, and add the tomato-basil flavored balsamic vinegarette as others have done and it's AWESOME!

I thought this soup came out very well, rich and creamy and thick. I prefer recipes that use crushed tomatoes to the ones that use tomato juice, always. It's worth the effort and cost to use fresh basil in tomato soup! Thanks for sharing :)

This soup is delicious!  I used 1/4 cup unsalted butter, and 1 1/4 cups half and half instead of the heavy cream.  I served the soup in mugs with additional chopped fresh basil as a garnish, with buttered garlic toast on the side.  YUM!!  This is going into the personal recipe file.

Easy & Yummy!  I did make 2 changes to the original recipe to make it healthier.  I used a cup of skim milk instead of the whipping cream & 3 tbs of can't believe it's not butter.  Once done, I used the immersion blender for a minute.  It was very tasty, super easy to make & and all for under 100 calories a serving!!!!!

My husband loved it!  I don't even like tomato soups, but the teachers at school loved it also, so now this is my new pot-luck favorite.  I modified the servings to feed 20, then added everything plus pepper.  I just kept tasting till it seemed not sweet, not too spicy, and very creamy.

I got home later than expected one night and had to fix something quick. Had bought fresh basil for another meal, but so glad to have it on hand!!! This was tasty and healthy and fast!!! Used diced tomatoes that were on hand.  Used immersion blender to make it less chunky.  Topped with fresh grated parmesan reggiano, served with baguette sliced and green salad.  This is a keeper for us!!! 
always have ingredients even if I don't have fresh basil, I have dried, and can put this together in no time and it tastes FRESH - gonna share this with my gardening buddies too that work with me to trade garden overflow!!!

Really easy and quick. Used parsley instead of basil and milk instead if cream. Also used a bit of cumin which really made it come together! I would recommend just play around till you like it!

This recipe is amazing! Quick, easy, and delicious. My husband and I had it with grilled cheese sandwiches. I did not change the recipe much...just added some onion and garlic and instead of doing 2 cans of crushed tomatoes I did one can of crushed and one can of pureed tomatoes.

I love this recipe.  I typically simmer it a lot longer than recommended before adding the cream and butter.  I add about a tablespoon of white wine and puree.  Delicious!

Excellent! I just happened to pick up crushed tomatoes tonight, then found this recipe. Luckily, I had most of the other ingredients as well. So easy and that gives it extra points in my book. I used half & half and only used 1/2 the butter. A keeper for sure!

This was pretty good but I made changes because I was scared it would be bland. I put a small yellow onion, 6 cloves of garlic and the basil in my food processor to get it fine. I let this simmer with the butter, then added the rest of the ingredients. I added 1tbs of red pepper flakes, some pepper and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. I came out great, just wish I had an immersion blender for a smoother texture. I served with eggplant mozzarella sandwiches on French bread. I would make again for sure!

Great soup! while the tomatos and chicken broth were boiling i sauteed half an onion with a tsp of garlic, tbs of butter, and fresh black pepper to taste then added it to the soup. To the soup itself i added minced garlic, pepper, a little salt, and I only used 2 tbs of butter. also added extra basil. it was delicious and so easy! I made it 2 days in a row!

This soup was DELICIOUS!  I added a little more cream because I like it to be really creamy, and also some tomato chunks because my boyfriend likes them, but I'm sure the recipe would've been just as good as written. :)

I recently have had to eliminate wheat/gluten from my diet.  I was dismayed to find my favorite classic brand of tomato soup is now off limits, and I feared I'd never taste this delicious comfort food again.  So I tried this recipe, and holy smokes, is it out of this world!!  (Dare I say tastier than my forbidden old favorite from a can??)  Delicious indeed, and I am so comforted that I can safely have the taste of tomato soup again.  With a grilled cheese on gluten-free bread, my tastebuds were happy and my craving was finally satisfied.  (I made a few minor changes, but not enough to warrant this an invalid review: Sauteed a little garlic and onion in the pot with 2 Tbsp butter first, then added the tomatoes and broth as directed.  Used 1 c. whole milk (instead of cream) and only 2 Tbsp butter for the final step.  I probably added extra basil, too, but that's just because I'm a basil nut and the leaves were big. :-)  Was extra tasty with a dollop of sour cream I found in the fridge!  Thank you so much for this recipe!  It is a KEEPER!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very acidic & sour. I used a high quality can of crushed tomatoes and even tried adding the extra sugar as others suggested. On the plus side, the consistency was just like the tomato soup at my favorite restaurant...very creamy and perfect color.

Excellent - made changes based on what I had on hand.  Used canned tomatoes with their juice and tomato puree. Used dried basil - add that just before serving.  Used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream.  Made this many times and it's always a hit!

My family loved this. I made a few changes based on what I had in the pantry. I used cans of (still added the fresh basil) diced basil garlic oregano tomatoes, beef broth, and half and half. I also made a roux with the butter since my soup was on the thin side. Then blended it with an immersion blender to smooth it out since the kids don't like chunks. I also added some stellini pasta to the kids soup, tiny stars floating in tomato soup..who can resist!

Love the simplicity of this soup but find the cream to heavy so I use Quark (a soft German cheese) it adds that richness without the calories and adds a nice original taste that no one can pinpoint unless you tell them.

I couldn't find crushed tomatoes in Malaysia so I bought diced tomatoes instead.  I also just used 3/4 cup of whipping cream and 1/4 cup of butter.  I also sauteed garlic and onions and added to the soup.  Absolutely delish and i am happy i bought the diced tomatoes which added some texture.  I'll probably add some Tabasco sauce in future to give it a little heat.

It was really good, but a bit too creamy for my taste. Next time I will hold off a little. It was very easy and yummy. I will be making this again.

It isn't often anything so simple is so very good.....but it was!  Used dried basil and 1 tsp. onion powder.  I've been a fan of cream of tomato soup forever (even using canned Campbells) but this is way better.

Great soup!  I just made this recipie and know it will be an instant hit with the kids.    I used dried basil and it still tuned out great.  I paired it with grilled cheese sandwiches...instant comfort food!!

Delicious! It's tangy, rich and creamy. This is one of my husband's favorite soups from La Madeleine's. Now that I know how easy it is to prepare, I make it quite often. The only thing I do differently is to add a couple tablespoons of cooking sherry towards the end, and I add some sea salt to taste. Then I use my immersion blender, right in the pot, to bring it all together for a smoother soup. Serve it with your favorite grilled cheese sandwich. Yummy!

Let me say, this soup is good. When I search on here for a recipe to make, I make my decision by reading the reviews and comments of other members. I look for their reactions and whether they stuck to the original recipe or not.
After scouring all over the net for a Tomato Basil Soup recipe, I chose this one based on the simplicity and quickness the recipe had to offer. 
I followed the recipe to the T, with the exception that I added slightly more sugar. The end result, a very good soup, but to me, seemed to be missing something. I dont have much experience with Tomato Soups, so I cant pinpoint what its missing. 
I recommend this recipe to all mothers, to make this soup for your kids, as they would love it with some saltine crackers. I know when my son gets home from school, he'll love this. 
My opinion, this recipe is between a 3 and 4 stars-its good, but average.

This soup turned out SO good! Thick, creamy, and super satisfying - especially paired with grilled cheese. Took little time to prepare and made a big enough batch for some fabulous leftovers. Even though I did not have fresh basil on hand, dried was fine. This recipe is a new favorite!

This was wonderful, even though I did not have crushed tomatoes, fresh basil or whipping cream, I used tomato sauce, jarred pesto and whole milk, it was wonderful.....can't wait to make it using fresh basil from my garden and jarred/canned tomatoes from last summer! (I also added about 3 tablespoons of crumbled feta, but it really did not need it)

Delicious! I didn't change a thing except used heavy whipping cream. This recipe is very easy and tasty. The only thing is, because of not using fresh tomatoes, I did find a little bit of tomato skin. I tried another recipe in the past that was just as delicious and didn't have any skin but it was sooooooo much more work and twice the ingredients. If you have time, peel and dice your own tomatoes. If not, this is a great quick recipe! Also, I strongly agree with other reviewers that fresh basil makes a HUGE difference :o)

This is very good.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used crushed tomatoes with basil and added a bit of extra dry basil to the mix.  Much better than the canned soup we were using, and less expensive, too!

This recipe is very tasty.  The only changes I made were to add the basil right away and then cook it longer than 10 minutes so it can really add flavor to the soup.  I also added a little oregano and salt for extra flavor.

This soup was superb! I didn't have any fresh basil on hand so I used Litehouse freeze dried (from the produce section) and it was fabulous! This is definitely a keeper in our house.

Rates a 3 as is -- good, but I wouldn't have made this again. My son and I both thought something was lacking--definitely garlic and perhaps sauteed onion as another reviewer stated. I threw everything into a Blendtec, pulsing the basil lightly at the end. For those who remarked that reducing the butter and cream was healthy -- I'm sorry but you are in error. Your body needs good fats. Please go to westonaprice.org to read info.

This soup is heavenly. I added a little bit of pizza sauce because I felt it was no "tomatoee" enough. I also added salt and pepeper and used dried basil and excluded the butter. The whipping cream really makes it divine. This is my favorite recipe for tomato basil soup and I love it so much I am eating it now!:) But make sure to add salt and pepper!!!

perfect as is! My husband said it was better than Campbells. :) The fresh basil really gave a fresh summery taste even in the middle of winter. We're eating it again tonight!

This is a good starter recipe for tomato soup, but it is quite bland as written.  Even doctoring it up with vegetable seasoning, dried oregano, and other spices didn't seem to help.  The only thing that saved it was garnishing the soup with the fresh basil and parmesan cheese.  Next time I make this soup, I will be adding sauteed onions and garlic as well as more spices (perhaps even some hot sauce).  To make it vegetarian, I used almond milk (original flavor) and Smart Balance and the consistency was fine. Also I used Pomi brand tomatoes as well (as the cans can contain BPA).  Give it a try but make sure to make additions!  Important tip--when using basil to apply just before serving as it will turn black when having this soup for leftovers.

This recipe is a good start, but I modified it quite a bit. I used half-and-half instead of cream, and instead of 1/2 cup butter I used 2 T butter and 2 T olive oil (1/4 cup butter/oil total). Since it's winter right now and fresh basil is expensive, I used about 1 t dried basil. I also added another t of sugar to cut down the acidity. For me, cutting the fat by that much was not detrimental to the deliciousness of the soup! I think it would be way too greasy with 1/2 cup butter and heavy cream, and I'm not even a health nut.

I thought this recipe was great! I made this last night for the first time. I made a few additions to suit our tastes- I added salt and pepper, a little onion powder, and a little dried basil in addition to the fresh basil. Instead of cream I used 1/2 cup half and half and half cup low fat milk. Like the other reviews said, I reduced the butter to about 5 or 6 T. Tonight we had this for leftovers and I made it even better and heartier for dinner by adding white rice (about 2 or 3 cups, cooked rice) making it a tomato rice soup and garnishing with grated cheese. OMG the rice and the cheese made it soooo good. I was just trying to change it up so it didn't feel like leftovers but from now on I am always going to make this a tomato rice soup!

I made this with my home grown frozen tomatoes. I added more chicken broth and cream and found it delightful. I also used it as a base for my black-eyed pea stew on New Years. I added ham and spinach and a variety of veggies and mushrooms. It made a very tasty stew.

Very easy, and very delicious.  Perhaps one of the best 2-3 soups I've ever had.  However we use 2/3 the butter and about 3/2 of the sugar.

This ia a great, basic recipe that you can tweak to suit your taste.  I've made it MANY, MANY times since discovering it.  I've used dried basil, fresh basil, milk, more sugar, diced tomatoes w/o salt,  etc.  I'm still working on my favorite version, but I've enjoyed every one I've tried!  I highly recommend running the whole thing thru a blender, though, so it won't be so thin/chunky.  I've shared this soup with my parents on many occasions so far, too!  Thanks for sharing, and for helping me enjoy soup thru the cold weather.

this soup has a nice flavor and takes minutes to make. I also substitued for the heavy cream as other reviewers suggested. The one problem I had with this soup is that it is really chunky.  I think if I blended it before cooking the result would be much better.. and less like I was eating a can of crushed tomatoes!

I used half the amount of butter.  My store was out of fresh basil, so I used the kind in the tube.  I added 3 tablespoons, and it was so much easier than cutting up fresh basil I think I will use the basil in the tube permanently, at least in the winter.  Really delicious, not too rich.  And so incredibly easy to make.

Did not care much for this recipe.  I prefer lots more flavors.  My favorite tomato soup would have garlic, onions, salt, pepper, oregano and a bay  leaf along with  lots of fresh basil like this recipe has.

My milk also curdled.  Maybe because I used milk instead of whipping cream?  Also used diced tomatoes instead of crushed, then put it all in blender.

Pretty good!! Will make again. I added some chopped garlic and used low sodium broth. Next time I will puree the soup with a stick blender because I like it smooth. Also added a little pepper and used crushed tomatos with basil alreday added. Garnish with crispy croutons and a little extra basil.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe. I don't change anything. For us it is perfect. We used to go to a bistro that served this with bread sticks and salad. Now we have our bistro meal here in our own kitchen. My friend and I are going to get together for lunch. Guess what we are having!?!

This soup was fantastic, although i did make a few changes..   I kept the amount of sugar, whipping cream and butter the same because I intended to stay as true to the recipe as I could.  I did not find it too buttery, but maybe a bit to sweet (I would suggest adding carefully and checking until its just enough to counter the acidity.. I know it lists one tsp, but nonetheless).  I added basic salt & pepper, oregano and parsley as well as some fresh crushed garlic.  I felt it was a little plain without that.  I also added about a 1/2c mozzarella and topped with croutons.  My roommate hates tomato soup and she ate two bowls of it.  It wasn't super-tomatoey but very creamy. Five stars b/c although it was sweet, it made someone like tomato soup.  Plus, I can be a little sweet-sensitive. I will make again!

I am not a fan of completely smooth/pureed soups so in addition to the crushed tomatoes, I sauteed some diced white onions along with adding a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes with basil instead of the fresh basil. I thought it was super easy to make and very tasty. This will be in the rotation of winter soups.

I had this for breakfast, it was so good!! I tweaked mine a little too, as I'm not very good at following recipes exactly. I cut back on the butter  (I actually liked it better before I added the butter and will prolly leave it out next time). I added a little garlic powder, salt and pepper and garnished with some of the cream, cracked pepper and basil leaves. Amazing, super easy and soul satisfying!!

Good, fresh-tasting soup.  It needs more sugar to cut the acidity.

My daughter and I have been searching for a recipe that resembles a favorite tomato basil soup at our local pizza joint.  This is it!!!!  I did add 4 sauteed garlic cloves which made the dish.  So...so....so.....good.

I really really enjoy this recipe. It is so simple and really excellent.  I used my own chicken base that I have on hand at home all the time.  recipe for that is: 600 grams of chicken 8 cups water 1/4 tsp of each: garlic powder, onion salt, celery salt, poultry seasoning, and pepper 1 1/2 tsp sea salt  The poultry seasoning is a home made mix as well: 1 T. of each: onion powder, garlic powder,  2 T. of each: dried sage leaves, dried thyme and dried parsley  Excellent!

This was very good on a fall evening. I was away all day so I made this in the crock-pot. I added the cream when I got home. I made grilled ham & cheese on tomato & sweet pepper sticks on the George Foreman grill. Will make this again!

I love this recipe!  I did change a few things however after reading the previous reviews.  I only used 2 tbsp of butter, I added an additional tsp of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes.  I also added 3 tsp of salt, pepper and garlic powder at the end for additional taste.  I would recommend that if you want to keep the soup creamy make sure to use the whipping cream because if you eliminate butter the way I did, you're going to want the additional fat from the whipping cream to keep it creamy.

Tasty with the following additions: 2 tsp Kosher salt, thicken with 1/2c. flour. I didn't have basil so I used fresh mint instead and it was delicious.

I used half and half instead and less butter.  Also got the not so great idea to use some culinary broth I needed to use up, chicken broth spiced with white wine, thyme and rosemary.  The wine part didn't really work for me but that is my mis-step.  I used immersion blender on tomatoes then again after adding half and half, helped to make it creamy even thou I reduced fats. Will try again with veggie broth.

i used my garden tomatoes (skins and all) and garden basil. it is very very good. i used my immersion blender to blender it up in the pot since i don't like chunks in it. i gave 4 stars because i felt the chicken broth cut the flavor too much. so i added more tomatoes and more basil and it was much better- next time i'll use half the amount of chicken broth. didn't need any sugar. i used half the amount of butter, and used half and half and skim milk mixed instead of whipping cream cuz i have to watch calories!

I love this recipe.  I did change it a bit though.....I used diced tomatoes, half the butter, 'half and half' instead of cream, I also used dry basil instead of fresh and added 1 tsp garlic.  Then after it was all cooked, I zapped it in the blender for a couple seconds.  Perfect consistancy for me...yummy little tomatoe pieces. :D

I'm sorry to not give this a higher rating but I did not like the flavor of the chicken broth in this recipe and could not get over that flavor after my bowl was done.  However, I did love the simpleness of the recipe.  I will try it again with either vegetable broth or tomato juice and probably add a very small amount of garlic, perhaps a small amount of oregano and pinch of salt as well.

I followed the suggestions and used less butter and substituted half and half for the whipping cream, next time I will probably use the cream since I kept adding more half and half, and it seemed to separate a little.  But, I still ate four servings :)

Delicious, easy, quick. I use 1/2 of the butter listed in the recipe and none of the sugar (the tomatoes are sweet enough). Great for entertaining guests.

Oh my...I had a pregnancy craving for tomato soup that I needed to fulfill.  Not typically a fan for tomato soups, this recipe was EXCELLENT.  I kept the recipe as is, except didn't measure the butter, so I think I added bit less than advised.  I will be making this staple recipe for a long time.

I'm not typically a big fan of tomato soup, but my bf loves it with grilled cheese so I decided to give it a try. I actually LOVED this soup. The only difference I made was to use dried basil instead of fresh. It was so quick and easy, there is no reason why anyone should be eating it out of the can when they can have this!

I didn't do the recipe exactly as written since I added a bit more sugar and subbed milk instead of cream and did less butter (as others suggested)... I'm not a cook, I rely on recipes... and I've never had tomato soup.  I didn't like this one... it tasted a bit like I was eating pasta sauce.  But this could just be me and my taste buds.

This soup was delicious but like another reviewer, I thought the butter was overkill. Probably a few tablespoons would have been sufficient. I didn't have whipping cream on hand so I used whole milk instead.

We love this soup.  We tend to double it (except the butter) and add more sugar.  We also use 1/2 and 1/2 or whole milk.  It makes a huge batch but we have a big family and it freezes well.  The kids call it "fancy tomato soup".  I'm sure using a recipe with fresh tomatoes would be even more delicious but you can't beat this for simplicity and very good taste.

Excellent soup. I couldn't find fresh basil so I used the tube stuff from the store and it was still great. I also like my soup a little thicker, so I made a rue and added that at the end, but that did not alter the taste. I also think it needed a bit more sugar and did not need all the butter the recipe calls for, but I made it that way and it is excellent!! Husband even says it is great, which doesn't happen often with soups. Will make again for sure!

This is an excellent recipe! Of course, I modified it slightly. My husband and I used canned tomatoes added about a cup of chicken stock, reduced the cream by half, and left out the butter. We also put the soup in the blender before adding the cream. Sooooo good!!!

Great taste!  Followed others suggestions of adding garlic powder and onion powder.  And to decrease fat content I used half and half. The only problem I had was some of the half and half started to curdle. We loved it anyways.

I was so excited to make this recipe! Based on the recipe and all the great reviews how could it go wrong? Like others I made this with half the butter, and half and half instead of whipping cream. But it did not turn out nice and creamy like the picture looks. It was also not thick like I hoped. But I figured it would still taste good. It did not. So I added more butter and more cream. Still didn’t like it. So I added more sugar, salt, pepper, garlic powder until I could at least make a meal out of it. Now what to do with the rest of the huge pot I just made? With all that fat and not that great taste, I am throwing it away. If you do make this I suggest you make it exactly as the recipe states. I give this two stars instead of one because I didn’t follow the recipe exactly.

I've added left over spaghetti sauce or diced tomatos - I've never had this soup come out wrong, no matter how much I "play" with it.

I loved the complex flavors and the way they came together. My only complaint is that the soup is very rich. I know it has cream and butter but it was more rich than I would have expected. Maybe I will cut down on the butter next time. Overall, still an excellent soup.

This is a great quick soup. I found that mine was a little watery, like it didn't blend well - I'm thinking I should have drained the tomatoes first. Overall great taste though. I traded one can of plain tomatoes for the some with jalapenos to add a little hot spice, oh and added some celery seed!

I was really excited to make this recipe after I saw all the excellent reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly - and was very disappointed.  Both of my kids disliked it also.  I didn't find it very flavorful but it's not that it was just bland - it just didn't have a flavor we enjoyed.

Excellent!  This tastes just like the soup I crave from the deli- I can make it at home now!  I made substitutions to use what was on hand- diced tomatoes that I hit with the stick blender to crush, dried basil (about 1 1/2 tsp.) and half & half instead of cream.  Without substitutions, I can only imagine how good it is.  The recipe said 9 servings, but I got 6 coffee mug servings.  Topped with feta and served w/ egg salad on toast.

I'm not sure about this soup.  I really wanted to like it, but once I finished making it, it mostly tasted like tomato paste.  However, I used dried basil instead of fresh, half-and-half instead of whipping cream, and 3 tbsp. of butter based on previous reviews-- maybe my changes messed it up.  Either way, I had to add two more teaspoons of sugar, ample amount of salt and pepper, garlic powder, and more basil to get it to be palatable at all.  Still not crazy about it.  I think I'll look for another recipe, but thanks for posting this one!

This was so savored by my friend for whom I made this recently. She told me over and over it was better than La Madeline's famous Tomato Basil Soup!  A compliment indeed! I added the whole "bunch" of basil leaves that I bought in a container. A bit more than 18 leaves. Just yummy! Topped with freshly grated parm.  Going to make again today for another friend!

I couldn't wait to taste this. Acidy and needed about 1 tsp of salt and 2 tablespoons of sugar. I would have put more cream in if I had it. I put some half and half in it. Four stars after the changes.

I usually read reviews before making a recipe and for some odd reason didn't on this one.  I sure wish I would have!  The acidity is so strong it needs more sugar definitely.  It mainly taste sour.  I really wanted to love this, but it was just ok...

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but used it as a guideline. I used one can crushed tomatoes, eight ounces of vegetable broth, 1/3 cup half and half, one tablespoon sugar, three tablespoons butter, and eight chopped basil leaves. It was very tasty - the only thing I'd do differently next time would be to blend the crushed tomatoes first, for a smoother texture, and make more - I only ended up with two and a half servings.

This is a pretty good recipe. I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and reduced the amount of butter a bit. I also blended the tomatoes to make it more bisque-like. As is, the recipe is good. Adding some parmesan cheese to the soup (about 1/3 cup) makes it great! I'll definitely keep this recipe around. It's great reheated and is quick and easy.

This is an awesome recipe.  We have an Italian restaurant near our home with the best tomato basil soup...bar none.  You have almost duplicated it. To make it more like the restaurant, I put the finished product in the blender...oh so good.    Thanks, I will use this recipe often.  Diana

yummy!I changed it a bit because the texture of crushed tomatoes is not for me. 2 (29 ounce) can pureed tomatoes  1 (14 ounce) can vegtable broth  fresh basil leaves, minced, to taste (i use basil paste, again because of the texture.) 1 cup organic heavy whipping cream (organic tastes so much better. and i add milk if i want to change the thickness) 1/2 stick butter fresh crushed garlic, to taste 1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce Salt and pepper to taste Garnish with grated Parm and basil leaves.

After making this soup as the recipe called for, I thought it was a bit acidic, and bland.  I added salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and more sugar,& only 4tsp of butter, it was better after the added ingredients. However, to be honet I would only rate it a 3 as is!

This soup was fabulous!!  It was very quick and delicious.  I had to use what I had on hand, and I wanted to make a little bit more than the recipe made.  Here's what mine looked like:  3 cans of crushed tomatoes, 1 &1/2 cans chicken broth, 1 stick butter, 2 cups heavy cream, 2 T dried basil...YUM!!!  Made a salad and grilled italian subs on ciabbata  bread - we were eating good in no time!

I've been looking for a fantastic homemade tomato soup recipe that's easy for a long time now, so I was THRILLED to come across this one. Thanks Sarah!! It's absolutely simple and delicious. I used fat free half-and-half instead of the whipping cream and doubled the amount of sugar and it came out perfect. Very creamy, very good.

HEALTHIER VERSION:  omit all butter and use half & half and/or milk instead of cream.  It still tastes great!  (I also saute onion and garlic in EVOO before adding tomato)  This is SO good with grilled cheese sandwiches!  Great recipe!

Very tasty, easy to make soup!  I don't like tomato soup that much, but thought I would give this a try with grilled cheese on a cold night.  I was quite pleased!  The only change I made was to use 10 Basil leaves, instead of 18, because some folks in my household aren't tomato-basil fans...  But this was a hit with all!

I made this as directed. My only problem was I didn't like the basil that settled to the bottom. I plan to make it again and add dried basil and some parmesan.

SO good! I too decided to cut the butter in half, and then I used half&half and milk instead of whipping cream to make it healthier for myself. Still perfectly delicious, especially when you add 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder. Num! I'll definitely make this again.

A wonderful full bodied soup that was a great starter to the meal. Substituted vegetable broth for the vegetarian in the group.

Can use diced tomatoes if no crushed on hand by using a potato masher or even a fork. I made a half recipe (it makes plenty)and used 2 T butter, milk, and 2 t dried basil. The basil was very strong, but still good. This is a really good soup. I prefer mine thicker, but the cream probably would have helped that. Can add cornstarch to thicken a bit if desired. Next time I'll think about blending the diced tomatoes first to get the soup a little less chunky. A good tomato soup. Way better than the cans.

Really good but, as others suggest, add MORE basil! I used 1/2 the butter and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream.

This soup is fantastic!! I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving and there was so much soup! I did make one change, which was only to puree the soup after cooking for a smoother, creamier texture. It was delicious! My three year old son also enjoyed it over spaghetti noodles. Fabulous!

It was great... If you like a thick Tomato Basil soup (like me), I would put in 3/4ths of the amount of chicken broth it says to put in. Also, when cooking the soup, mash up the tomatoes a bit so that it provides for a common texture instead of big clumps of diced tomatoes. Sugar can be added, but it is also fine without. It is my favorite soup to cook :D

I used the crushed tomatos as directed but it made the soup's texture so gritty. That is all I could taste was gritty tomato, it did not turn creamy. I think it may have turned out ok if I had used tomato sauce instead of the crushed tomatos. I may give it another go trying it that way.

Really good.  Halved the recipe to make just about 4 servings.  Also used a little more than half the butter and less cream than the recipe called for.  Very easy.  Definitely make again.

I made this recipe vegan by using unsweetened soy milk and earth balance margerine.  I also pureed in for a smoother consistancy.  It was really good and easy because everything was in my pantry.  I will deffinatly make this again.

this was so easy to make and tasted like this gourmet soup i usually pick up from the store. I didn't have fresh basil so i used dried and added more sugar to taste to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes. Highly recommended

So yummy and simple. I love tomato soup and this really hit the spot. I tweeked the original recipe a little. I reduced the butter by 3T, added 2t of sugar, and 4 pinches of salt (Sorry, I didn't measure this I was just adding to taste). I really love this recipe.

This soup is wonderful!  My husband and I loved it!  It's better than any tomato basil soup we have tried at bistros. I have also made it with beef broth (homeade from boiled beef soup bones) and it was extra rich and flavorful.  It was great served with grilled cheese on sourdough.  Will definitely make this again.

This was very delicious! I made it with diced tomatoes and milk, rather than cream, since that is what I had on hand. I also increased the sugar and reduced the butter. I can imagine it would be sinfully delicious with the heavy cream. Thanks for a great EASY recipe!

Very tasty. thanks for the recipe.  I used canned italian plum tomatoes & blended first.  also used 1/2 the butter, which was plenty & used ff 1/2 & 1/2 to cut calories.  tasted great & probably even better tomorrow for lunch.

Pretty good, but just doesn't quite hit the mark. It might be that the canned tomatoes give it a bite that fresh ones wouldn't...

I am still in search of that perfect recipe for this soup that will match the one at the restaraunt I go to all the time.

Love this recipe - and it makes enough for a week of lunches after a good dinner with crusty bread!  I did saute some onions and garlic before adding the tomatoes and broth, but I add onion and garlic to almost everything.  Followed another recommendation and got the crushed tomatoes with basil and added some dried basil instead of fresh (I killed my basil plant in a recent move).   I also used light cream to cut a little bit of fat, but I don't think it compromised the taste.

Very good...although, I made a few changes.  I used 4 tablespoons butter and I will use even less, perhaps none, next time. I also used half-n-half instead of heavy cream.  I had a large can of crushed tomatoes and two 14.5 oz cans of diced, which worked great, as we liked it a little chunky.  I will add real parmesan cheese next time to mimic the soup at a favorite restaurant and perhaps a few small pieces of bacon. Soup tasted even better the second day!

This is a great base tomato soup recipe! I've made it exactly as written and it turned out great. But this is so easily modified and upscaled to suit your tastes  as well! My changes: I use 16oz of no salt added beef broth instead of chicken (personal preference); I reduce the butter by half and up the cream by half a cup; and I'm not a fan of basil so use Herbes de Provence instead and s&p of course!! My last little secret ingredient? Tomato paste to add a little thickening and Umami. Creamy and the perfect compliment to a grilled cheese! This soup also freezes very well.

I did puree the tomatoes after simmering using an immersion blender. at first I thought I would try to strain the remaining seeds but too many tomatoes were left in the strainer. I also used fresh tomatoes which I had peeled and seeded (romas). Also added half teaspoon of salt to half the recipe; if making a full recipe I would add 1 teaspoon.

This was exactly what I was looking for:  quick, easy and delicious.  I added some salt, pepper and a sprinkle of garlic powder and topped it with some grated extra aged Beemster.  Definitely blending it is a must or the consistency won't be right.  That only took about a minute with my immersion blender, so I'm definitely not complaining.  It was fantastic.

I've made this recipe as written and then again with 1/2 and 1/2.  By far, the whipping cream makes the recipe much more rich and creamy.  But the tomato/basil flavor is fantastic regardless.

This soup is amazing made just as the recipe says. I don't add anything else but might put some spices and grated cheese on the table for others to add if they want. My way of making the soup smooth and creamy is to use an immersion blender after adding the basil and sugar. I hate all the clean up after usng a blender, so my immersion blender is my friend.  As others have said, wait until the soup has cooled a little before adding cream. This recipe is so good that I'm making it next week on a ladies retreat.

My go-to tomato soup recipe. I also use just over half the butter that the recipe calls for but it's still rich and delicious. We often serve with grilled cheese (obviously) but it's good on its own too! This is on regular rotation in my home.

The taste and the simplicity of this soup gives it a five star rating. It is creamy and the small amount of sugar removes the acidity. I've used half and half, whipping cream and milk, it is just as tasty.

I sautéed some mushrooms and garlic in butter.  I also used  Mrs. Dash to spice it up and added a bag of three cheese blend at the end.  Very good!

Doesn't need any changes to earn 5 stars, though I do always cut it down to a couple tablespoons of butter. If I'm in the mood, I'll add onions, garlic, red pepper flakes, etc. The fact that it's great EITHER as it stands or as a base for experimentation makes it twice as good!

Great soup, though perhaps a bit too rich for us. I used canned tomatoes already seasoned with basil and that worked fine. Next time might use half and half or milk instead of the heavy cream.

Yum!  Mine turned out great even though I made some changes.  Made this with 2 cans crushed tomatoes (didn't want to blend anything), 16 oz chicken stock, 1 cup vanilla almond milk (didn't have anything else), and 3 tablespoons  butter.  Omitted the sugar since I thought the almond milk was a bit sweet.  Added 1 TBSP dried basil, and ground pepper to taste.  Omitted the salt too.  It was perfect.  I'm sure it's even better as written above but I didn't want the extra calories from all the butter and heavy cream.  Next time I'll try it with no butter at all.  Super delish.  :-)

Love this recipe with a grilled cheese sandwich.   I used half-n-half instead of whipping cream and it was still very rich.  Delicious!

This is SO much better than any canned soup!  My kids did not care for it but I loved the fresh taste.  This makes A LOT.  I think this would be great to take to a pot luck or anything that feeds many :)  I will be making this for the teachers at my kids' school (the kids may not love it but I know the teachers will!)

Made this soup exactly as written, but next time I make it, I will add a little more sugar, was a little to acidy for my taste.  Was great with grilled cheese sandwiches.

Phenomenal.  I used a ton of fresh tomatoes from the garden and just boiled them down, fishing out most of the skins as they cooked.  Veggie broth cubes, heavy cream, basil, salt, sugar and pepper.  SO good.

A great recipe but after a few changes - I added salt, and pepper to taste, minced a small sized onion and saute it for a few minutes before adding to the tomatoes and broth mixture, added half a Jalepeno pepper diced - no seeds (go for a whole if you want an extra kick). Instead of all this butter, I sautéed half cup orzo in half table spoon butter until lightly brown then added it to this mix. Gives it little bit more texture and flavor but make sure to mix often so it doesn't get stuck in the bottom. I also cut the cream portion in half and instead whisk in half a cup of flour. The kids and hubby love this!! I always get compliments on it from guests too :))

This was easy and delicious! I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand: I started by sauteing some minced garlic in olive oil, used 2 cans of no-salt-added diced tomatoes, and vegetable broth instead of chicken. I also used a can of low fat evaporated milk after blending the other ingredients. I finished with some shredded asiago cheese and served slices of sourdough bread. Awesome recipe!

Very good- I omitted the sugar and butter and added salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. I cut down on the whipping cream as well, and added to taste. My picky five year old drank it straight from the bowl.

Very delicious soup! Only minor tweaks: I added two cloves of minced garlic to it, 6tbsp of european creamery butter to it, and about 1/3 cup of grated parmesan cheese while it was bubbling! It turned out amazing! Serve with grilled cheese.

This soup is delicious! I substituted Silk soymilk creamer and Earth Balance buttery spread for the heavy cream and butter for a delicious vegan version. I also added salt and 1 extra tsp sugar. It's definitely a 5 for me.

GREAT SOUP.  But I must admit I did step outside of the recipe ever-so-slightly.  I sauteed some onion in the butter until nice and soft (mainly because I just love to start a recipe with sauteed onions)... then added the tomatoes, broth, and sugar.  (I actually used stewed tomatoes because they have more flavor.)  Instead of using just whipping cream, I used just a little cream and mostly mascarpone cheese (only because I like more of a thick bisque-like consistency... this makes it creamy without thinning it out).  It was delicious, and I completely forgot to add the basil!  I look forward to trying it again and remembering the star ingredient.

Delicious and EASY soup! The only changes I make are minimal--and that would be only putting 1 tsp of butter in instead of 1/2 cup. Just my preference though! Highly recommend!

Fast, easy, and tasty. Reminds me of the canned tomato soup I get at Central Market.

I used fresh, pureed tomatoes instead of canned...and it was wonderful with grilled cheese sandwiches.  Very quick and easy to make.

This soup is very good; with a little more tweaking I think I can make it as soon as the local restaurant.  I would never believe that a soup that tasted this good is so easy!  Will probably be a weekly or biweekly make for me!

pretty good. I use sugar sparingly and sometimes leave out the basil. I've used roasted tomatoes, too, and it turns out nice.

Amazing soup everybody always loves it. I use less better and add cheese to it so it makes it less greasy. I also add Italian seasoning to it to give it extra flavoring. Such an amazing fast recipe!

Used suggestion to add garlic powder, salt and pepper.  But also added 1/8 c. gin and used can of stewed tomatoes with organo and basil.  When ready put in blender.   Also, used slightly more sugar, butter and cream.  Delicious.

My daughter wanted me to make tomato basil soup, so found this recipe so highly rated.  My daughter said it tasted like spaghetti sauce :(
Glad I only made a half batch.

Wow, delicious! Since I only had 1 can of tomatoes with green chilies on hand I used that instead--adds a nice heat to the already wonderful soup.  To counteract some of the heat I doubled the dairy (used fat-free evaporated milk instead of cream) and a few squirts of lime juice.  Also, before adding milk and butter I used the immersion blender since I wanted a completely creamy soup.

This soup was a tasty, creamy soup. I did add in some minced garlic, onion powder, and black pepper to bump up the taste. I love making a big batch for a Saturday lunch and eating it all throughout the weekend!

I gave it only a four because it is fairly plain as written. I spiced it up by adding onion, spinach, garlic and beef. I also used one can of crushed tomatoes with basil already in it. I did as suggested by other reviews and used half whipping cream and half milk but I ended up not using any butter. I made 48 servings with this recipe and it turned out wonderfully. Will absolutely save this for future use.

Delicious base! I took the advice of several different reviewers.... minced and sauteed 3/4 of a large vidalia onion and 4 cloves of garlic (with a bit of salt and veg oil for 5 min or so... after bite is gone but onion is still crunchy) and added it after the chicken broth/tomatoes started to boil. I also used fat free half and half and 6T of butter instead of 8.  Served with parmesan cheese and garlic bread. It was awesome! I'll definitely make again!

I have made this several times and it has become a great family favourite.  I've found that doubling or even tripling the basil just makes it better.  I used and immersion blender and got a wonderfully smooth and creamy result.  It is a matter of individual taste whether you prefer the greater texture of the unblended soup, or the creamy, blended version.  I added one tsp of brown sugar which seemed to add a little depth of flavour.

this is very good soup with additional tweaking. I used 4 large fresh ripe tomatoes, light cream instead of whipping cream, water and chichen stock since didn't have chicken broth, added a pinch of salt, pepper and garlic.  I recommend you add until you get it to your liking.

For my first try, used less butter, dried basil, and lowfat milk, added some salt, and pepper, and then used my immersion blender to smooth out the tomatoes.  Was very tasty and easy to make, will be making this a lot for quick tasty meals. Home reviewer said it tasted better than the kind everyone loves from the can, and almost as easy to make!

lovely soup. will probably make it again tomorrow. i did follow other's advice to saute a chopped onion and 4 crushed garlic cloves. To make it a little light i replaced the cream and the butter with 1 1/2 cups milk. came out great! different than the tomato soup we usually make, but still so good in a different way.

I love thiis soup! made it the way it says to but used half & half. For those who used half & half or milk, is there a way to add it in so it mixes in well to the soup? if that makes any sense?

I made this for a ladies tea Bunco and it was a huge hit.  Delicious and very easy to make.  I did follow the suggestions and added half the butter and minced garlic and onion powder.  I paired it with homemade pimento cheese sandwiches.

Super yummy and easy to make. I added some garlic powder and salt.  At the beginning it was too sweet.  Next time I would like to try it by making my own crushed tomatoes and not using canned ones and using milk instead for a healthier soup.

If you are looking for a basic, easy, tasty recipe, look no further! Tastes delicious, even though I had to use milk (no cream at home) and dried basil (once again, no fresh). I can imagine how fun this recipe will be to play with! Adding garlic? Onions? Rice? This recipe will grow on you! I believe it is very easy to adjust levels of fats by eliminating some of the butter, using low fat milk and low fat chicken broth. Also lowering the sodium would be as easy as using low-sodium chicken broth and tomatoes. I definitely will make this again and use my immersion blender to make it even creamier!

Wow!!! Completely idiot proof recipe. I did add four cloves of garlic and one full onion. Added pepper flakes for depth and heat. Only used half the butter. Amazing. Not even sure if I'm even going to have any left for our actual dinner as hubby and I can't stop 'testing' to see if this recipe was any good lol.

First attempt to make tomato soup and it was a success! I did add sauteed onion, garlic and another teaspoon or two of sugar because it was a little bitter. Maybe because I used tomato puree instead of crushed tomatoes. KEEPER!! 
p.s. I also used light cream & half the butter.

This dish was absolutely fantastic! I used a little less butter than was asked and added sugar little by little until the bitterness of the tomatoes was balanced out. I also incorporated some ground pepper into the recipe and served it with grilled cheese sandwiches. My husband and I devoured it!

It was good, but not as good as I thought it was going to be.  If I were to make it again I may use tomato puree instead of the crushed tomatoes.  The crushed still has bits of skin and seed in the soup that make it a strange texture.  It also wasn't as soupy as I would like.  I didn't use the heavy cream.. maybe that effected the outcome.  May make again.

So simple to make and very delicious.  For extra flavor I minced 2 shallots and sauteed them with 1 tbs tomato paste in the 1/2 cup of butter with a pinch of allspice.  Then added the tomatoes and chicken broth...etc.  I also used a hand blender at the end to make the soup smooth.  Great recipe.  Much better than canned and super simple.

I don't always have fresh basil, so I substitue 3 tablespoons of prepared pesto. I don't add butter or margarine because of the oil in the pesto.

Decent recipe although I personally agree with those who said the final product was a bit bland.  This was after I modified by adding onion and 4 cloves garlic (saute in olive oil).  Would I make it again?  I would probably resort to another recipe before coming back to this recipe.  Didn't receive any praise from the wife or daughter on this  recipe's taste.

It had never occurred to me, before this, to make tomato soup from scratch, but after trying this I will never eat it from a can again!  Delicious winter recipe.  

My 5-star review was based on the following modifications:
- I sauteed 1/4 of a white onion and 6 cloves of garlic in 1/4 of a cup of butter.  I then ommitted the butter from the last step.  
- I halfed the cream and still found it plenty rich.

I served this sandwich with grilled cheese, bacon and tomato sandwiches.  My husband was very pleased.  I will make this again, for sure.

This is my first review on the site, I have to say how much I loved this soup! I added a bit of garlic powder and only 2 Tbsp of butter, it was delicious and hearty! I had it the next day over some tortellini which was also FABULOUS!  Yumm-o!

Totally amazing! Everyone loves this recipe. I revised a bit: browning garlic and chopped onion first and then adding the other ingredients. I increased the basil and reduced the butter & sour cream. Season to taste and this is fantastic.. Thanks for a great recipe.

I actually tend to steer from original recipes (actually I almost always tweak them!) but I left this one alone and it came out great.  I only added a little bit of pepper, since I made it for my sick husband and wanted to clear his sinuses!  He loved it too.  It had great texture, nice and chunky.  Went great with a nice buttery grilled cheese.  Definitely not for a health or weight conscious person, but makes a nice treat!

I loved this soup it was so yummy. I try to always make the original recipe first, but I did go ahead and added the garlic. Next time I will do garlic and onion also probably add a carrot to help with the acidity in the soup. my boyfriend had to add more sugar so he could eat it. Next time though I will not do all of the butter or whipping cream I'll half or do less. I'm excited to make it again. serve well with grilled cheese:-)

I really enjoyed this soup. Who wouldn't with all that cream and butter :)  I added a can of pinto beans, and instead of regular crushed tomatoes I used one can of diced toatoes with green chilies. It was excellent!

I added 4 cloves of garlic and one small onion and sauteed them in the butter before adding the chicken broth. I also added a small can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano for a little extra texture and flavor. Yummy!

Delicious and simple!  Most often I have all the ingredients on hand to whip this up whenever the mood strikes.  I ended up using one can of sauce, and one can of chunky style tomatoes,  we loved the consistency when finished.  The sugar you might increase depeding on the acidity of the tomatoes you're using, I more than doubled the amount in the recipe.  Used half and half instead of whipping cream, but I'm sure that would be most delicious!  My son and I (the tomato soup eaters in our house) devoured it!  Leftovers for lunch - I'm a lucky girl ;)

I don't know what happened to my soup but made it exactly as the recipe stated and it did not turn out well. I really wanted it to turn out as it was the first time I made it, but it was totally bland, no flavor.

Excellent soup. I would agree that adding in some more spices will give it a better flavor. I added in some garlic powder to taste.

I made this according to the recipe and it was a little too bitter for me. It might have been better if I had added more sugar. I'm not a huge fan of tomato soup in the first place so maybe that was my problem. My husband really liked it and it was definitely easy to make.

This soup is a hit and so easy.  I use fat free half and half to cut down the fat but leave the butter the same.  I also add shredded cheddar when the soup is hot.  I have a co-worker who raves about this soup

This was great! Thanks for the recipe. I only gave it 4 instead of 5 because I had to tweak the recipe, but I will make this again. My adjustment was 1 Cup of milk instead of cream because that's all I had (still came out great that way!) and 16oz of chicken broth. I only added 1 tsp sugar and 4T of butter and that was plenty. I agreed that the recipe didn't call for nearly enough spices. I added a lot of salt, some pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder in addition to the basil (I used dried). It was so good, my kids (9 and 7) loved it.

I made this the other night for my husband and myself and it was yummy! After reading other reviews, I tweaked it a bit.  I used 3 teaspoons of sugar, 6 tablespoons of butter and only 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil leaves.  It turned out great, but maybe a tad too "rich".  I think next time I'll cut back a bit on the butter and use whole milk instead of cream.  This one is a keeper!

Very tasty.  I used 1-2 cloves of garlic, chopped onion, milk instead of cream, 2 Tbsp butter, salt and pepper.  Served with grilled cheese.  My husband loved the soup even though he never liked tomato soup in the past. When using milk, be careful not to let it boil after milked is added, or it will curdle.

We sprinkled some onion powder and garlic powder on top when adding the basil. Also put fresh grated parmesan on top when serving and had it with thick grilled cheese. My husband ate it for three days straight!

Very good, very easy.  Makes approx. 12 cups.  Next time would have saltines or oyster crackers on hand.  Used stew tomatoes that I broke up a bit, may want to use something smaller in the future.

very tasty.... I used 3 T butter & 1 T sugar as suggested, also adjusted the cream to 3/4 C cream (what I had in the fridge) with 1/4 C fat free half and half.  also saute'd onions and garlic as others suggested and added it while simmering -2nd time I made...couldn't find fresh basil -so I used approx 1 1/2 t dried - also used 1/2 heavy whipping cream and 1/2 half fat free half and half...still good!

super easy & delicious.  reduced butter as recommended by other reviewers.  I sauted a small onion with the butter, then added the tomatoes, broth, and spices.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so I used diced tomatoes and then ran the mixture through the blender right before adding the cream/milk.

I rate it 5 stars for its ease of preparation as much as its taste.  Also, any "vegetable" dish that has my teenage son and his friends asking for more is an automatic FIVE!

Pretty bland actually. I added plenty of seasoning, half cup of processed roasted red pepper, sauteed garlic and half an onion, throw it in and blend the whole recipe at the end because its too chunky. Turned out well after all that!

I made this a few days ago. It was really good. I sauteed onion, garlic & sliced mushrooms in olive oil to give it more flavor. I used petite diced tomatoes and half and half. The only thing I will do different next time is use the whipping cream as suggested to give it more of a creamy mix. I served pepperjack grill cheese with it. It was great!

I loved it.  I didn't have heavy cream so used whole evaporated milk.  Also, used fresh basil.  This was awesome!  I served it with grated parmesan cheese on top.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recipe today and it rocks! Just like La Madeleine Country French cafe. Serve it with fresh baked crusty french bread...and real butter. Yes, I said it real butter! Oh yeah! :)  Will make again and recommend to friends.

I did as others stated and reduced the butter to 2TBS, and added some sauteed 1 garlic clove and 1/4 onion minced.  It was awesome - no leftovers at all!!

Best tomato soup I've had. I decreased the amount of butter as others said and it was still delicious. Next time I will try subbing the cream for milk and see what I think.

I also cut down on the butter and doubled the basil. The orginal lacked flavor. I garnished the soup with some shredded parmesan cheese and a few crutons... yummy! Even my two year old loves it!

I used a tablespoon of crused garlic, and a splash of malasses to increase the sugar content. I also substituted cream for 2% milk and a couple of pinches of flour to thicken the soup. Lastly, i added diced muhrooms. Initally the soup was bland and taste like pizza sauce, but with a bit of monkeying around, it did become pretty decent. The original recipe is only a starting point. Make sure to take a lot of taste tests along the way.

5 stars all around.  I used what I had in my pantry.  I pureed a can of tomatos and used dried basil.  I also added a bit of garlic powder and onion powder (I would have chopped the real thing and sauteed it but my husband prefers smooth tomato soup).  I halved the recipe since it was dinner for 2, and I used 1T butter.  I'll make it many, many times this Fall and Winter.  It was perfect with grilled cheese!

The recipe as-is works pretty well. I prefer a sweeter tomato soup so I upped the sugar to a tablespoon, and I think next time I'll blend/process the tomatoes so they aren't as chunky. Overall though, delicious! And it makes plenty for leftovers! Oh and I added cayenne pepper after the fact for some kick.

I am never eating condensed/canned tomato soup again.  This soup is FANTASTIC.  I read the reviews before I made it and the consensus about butter amount is right: I cut it back considerably (and added a bit more sugar, to taste) and it was PERFECT.  I garnished my bowl with a sprinkling of shredded Asiago cheese, and served it with a side of a grilled swiss on roasted garlic sourdough sandwich.  NIRVANA!

Didn't add any butter at the end. Sauteed onions and garlic first and added to the soup when basil and sugar were added. Used 3/4 a cup of half and half and 1/4 cup skim milk.

My daughter came home ranting and raving about the schools tomato soup. She begged me to make some. I personally have not so fond memories of being forced to eat tomato soup til I literally could not hold my food down. So I thought to make her happy, I would attempt. I ate it but she mentioned it wasn't as good as the schools. That is surprising because I don't recall school cafeteria food being good at all. She wasn't impressed nor myself. Appreciate you sharing, but not for my family.

I did use honey instead of sugar and cooked some garlic and onion in the butter before adding the tomatos.  Pureed in the food processor before adding the cream.  Nice, creamy tomato soup but still could use some tweaking to boost the flavor.

So very good and so very easy.... I did use 2 cans of diced tomatoes and it was a little to chunky so I put most of it in the blender to smooth it out. Fantastic and simple!

Yummy! This is an excellent soup. I used fresh tomatoes and fresh basil from my garden. No need for sugar when you use fresh tomatoes. I was inspired by Lindsay's advice and used 3/4 c. half and half and 1/4 c. milk instead of the heavy cream. I also only used 3 T. butter and added more fresh basil and a few shakes of dried. Delicious!

This recipe is a great start to a teriffic tomato basil soup. I used 1/2 the butter and added some extra garlic salt and a bit of pepper for personal taste.  I love that it made extra and was perfect with gilled cheese for a simple, homestyle meal.

I tried this two ways. I tried it the 'healthier' way by using milk in place of whipping cream and cut back the butter to 4 tbsp. It tasted like stewed tomatoes to me so I ended up adding the whipping cream and more butter. Not quite as healthy but tasted MUCH better. I also used my hand wand for a nicer, creamier texture.

This is sooo easy and sooo delicious. Fresh basil makes the dish. I double or triple the recipe and freeze in portions for a quick meal with a grilled cheese or by itself. I have made it sometimes with canned and fresh combined. always tastes great.

I love this soup!  It's so delicious with some chunks of tomatoes.  I ate it for 4 meals.  My daughter's not a tomato fan, but my hubby and son loved it too.    Great recipe!  I'll definitely make more!!

I thought this was pretty good. Not the best recipe for tomato basil soup I've made.  My husband didn't like it at all. Both my husband and I prefer another recipe here on AR. Thanks for sharing though!

I didn't have basil leaves, but I had heard that about 1/8 tsp dry can replace a leaf if added early, so I tried that, though admittedly I didn't add the full 9/8 for my half-recipe. I used half-and-half instead of whipping cream, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was a little bland, but a little garlic helped. It was good, but not really a one-dish meal maker, and if I'm going to eat it with grilled cheese anyway, I felt like it wasn't worth all the trouble, when I could just add basil to Campbell's.

Yum! Instead of adding the butter at the end, I sauteed fresh garlic in it at the beginning, before adding anything else. I halved the recipe, but only used 2 tablespoons of butter and it was just right. Really, really great soup. Thanks! :)

I made this with dried basil, milk rather than whipping cream, and less margarine than the recipe calls for and everyone who had it still thinks it's great.  I bet it's even better if you actually follow the recipe.  This is really simple to make, too.

What happened? Followed recipe with the exception of using half & half per other reviews. The soup turned out so bitter/sour that it is inedible. Used a good quality commercial brand of crushed tomatoes. Tried additional sugar.

Ok recipe but too bland for us. If I make it again, I would use petite diced tomatoes rather than crushed.  I like the chunkier tomato soups.

My favorite soup! I am not a great cook by any means and yet I haven't managed to ruin this soup yet, it always comes out great. I am mildly lactose intolerant so I use soy milk and it still comes out great.

Very good! I doubled the recipe and froze half. I used more basil than called for, replaced the heavy whipping cream with 3 parts half and half and 1 part milk, reduced the butter by half and slightly decreased the sugar. I also sauteed about a quarter to a half of yellow onion with 2 crushed cloves of garlic and added that to the tomatoes and broth before simmering.

This was very delish!  I did as others suggested and tripled the amount of sugar.  I haven't been able to eat tomato soup since developing a wheat allergy and this is mindful of Campbell's which I love.  Thank you for the recipe!

The soup came out pretty well.  My only comment is that it was pretty bitter so I had to add more than just 1 teaspoon of sugar.  Otherwise delicious!

Although I love tomato soup. This recipe was not my favorite. I liked the taste but I could not stand the texture of the crushed tomatoes. I couldnt get past the chunks and the tomato skin. Will continue my search for a better recipe.

This soup was quick and delicious.  Perfect on a snowy day like today.  I used dried basil and lite whipping cream.  I toasted bread with butter and olive oil, perfect with the soup.

OMG.. I saw some of this premade in the store and I wanted some.. looked this recipe up on my phone right there in the store and came home and made this recipe.  It is so much better than what I probably would have bought premade.. Now I just need some crusty croutons on top and it will be exactly like the soup offered at Applebees!!!!  A++++  Thanks!!!

My entire family loved, loved, loved this soup and I'm planning to make it again today! We all agreed that it tastes a lot like the sauce for Indian butter chicken and I'm planning to tweak it with some Indian spices and serve it with basmati rice and curried veggies. These are the changes I made: 1 minced onion sauteed in HALF of the butter in the recipe, added 3 minced garlic cloves, salt and pepper.  I also added about 4 tsps of sugar instead of the 1 and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream.  Mmmmmm, perfect as we head into fall/winter!! Oh, my husband and youngest son sprinkled some grated cheddar on top of theirs and raved about it.

Excellent. I made this at 3am whilst studying. Simple, tasty and great on a cold night.   I didn't have any basil and I halved the butter. Also had it with grilled cheese sandwiches.

Used fresh tomatoes, half and half, and just 1/4 cup butter.  Very flavorful, but cream separated when added.  Cream was fresh; a little research points to the acidity of the tomatoes as the reason.  I'm not sure how to remedy it, but I'll try making a roux next time and adding the tomato mixture to the cream/butter to see if that makes a difference.  That said, the soup tasted much better than it looked!  Served with grilled cheese on sourdough...yummy!

This was a great base recipe but in my opinion needed the following alterations:   no more than 5 Tbsp butter; 1/4 onion (minced, sautéed before adding tomatoes); 2 Garlic cloves, minced; 1 Tbsp Ground black pepper; 1/3 cup Shredded parmesan cheese.  I seasoned to taste with oregano, basil and black pepper. The next time I make this I will use far less butter, and will make a roux from the butter (and add flour) then add the heavy cream to that before incorporating it into the tomato mixture. For me the soup was a little thin and very heavy, but I will use this as a base with the alterations mentioned.

I made this recipe exactly as posted. I can't believe some people think there is too much cream/butter. Using two giant cans of crushed tomatoes for the tomato base requires a lot of fat to cut the acidity. In fact, I find the canned tomatoes so acidic that even the cream/butter amount recommended was not quite enough. Instead of adding more, I would probably cut down on the canned tomatoes and add some fresh ones as a substitute. I found this still to be quite acidic and a bit too "tangy" for my taste. I am still giving it a 4 - we did enjoy the soup, but I think I would make some changes next time.

Yummy soup!  The only thing I change is to saute some fresh onion and garlic in olive oil, thicken it with left over mashed potatoes and throw the whole thing in a blender (don't forget to let the soup cool first, or you'll end up with hot tomato soup on the kitchen ceiling!).  Sometimes I use canned tomatoes with green chilies.  And, like other reviewers I use half the amount of heavy cream and butter.

This tomato soup is amazing. When it called for that much butter i was hesitant at first but it tasted great.  Next time id probably add a can of diced tomato also for a little texture, but as far as traditional tomato soup goes, this is an awesome recipe.

This was nice but a little tomato saucy - perhaps because of the 2 cans of crushed tomatoes.  Might be better with a fresher source of tomatoes but for the speed and ease of the recipe this was very good.

Very good soup made as the recipe states or would be a good base recipe to play around with. I made this with golden tomatoes canned from last years garden and it turned out delicious.

this is SO good! here are the changes I made: I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian, half & half rather than cream, and splenda rather than sugar. delicious! I like to make a huge pot and freeze containers so I always have it on hand.

Very good but also very intense. Sauteed a small onion and 3 cloves of garlic and then added to the soup pre-cream & butter.  Also added 1/3 box of cooked ditalani pasta.  Very quick & easy to make and will make again soon. Used light butter this time and heavy cream - will try light cream next time.

I used the recipe as stated except substituting half and half instead of full cream and using freeze dried basil. I, by the way, adore tomato basil creamy soup. However, I wasn't super impressed with this recipe. It wasn't awful but a tad bland. This could possibly be because I used dried basil instead of fresh but I had to spice it up with salt, garlic and cayenne and I still wasn't blown away. I now have  huge pot of left-over soup in my fridge, I hoping it will grow on me!

This is so easy but SO good!  I first tried it with basil from my spice rack because I did not have fresh basil but had all other ingredients.  I then tried it again with fresh basil and there is no comparison.  Fresh basil is a must!

I followed some others advice to cut down on the fat by using half and half and only 6T of butter....my advice: stick to the recipe! It came out like spaghetti sauce. I think it would have been much better had I used full fat cream. It was also way too acidic. I added more sugar but it didn't seem to help. I'll try this again, this time sticking to the recipe. I'll use the stuff I made to put on some pasta!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly. I used store brand crushed tomatoes and low sodium chicken broth.  This soup will definitely be a staple in my house!

This is so easy and so delicious!  Great for a cold winter night.  Like other reviewers, I halved the butter and used half and half instead of the cream.  Came out perfect.  My husband requests it regularly now.  Thanks so much!

Delicious!  I adapted it slightly for two servings.  Into the blender I threw a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes, 1/4 cup skim milk with a splash of cream, 1/4 cup broth, pinch salt, pinch sugar, pepper and couple pinches dried basil and then simmered.  I served this with cheese toast points and felt like I was in a high end restaurant.  Mmmm!

I wanted to love this recipe, I really did.  It might have been the brand of crushed tomatoes I used, because the soup was way too acidic for me.  I don't usually like tomato dishes that call for sugar, but in this case I should have listened to the reviewers who added additional sugar.

Wonderful soup! I used crushed tomatoes with basil already added to simplify, soooo good. Also subed 1/2 whipping cream 1/2 milk to reduce fat. Will make over and over again.

I really did like this recipe.  I did modify it though for reasons of health and convience.  First, I used beef broth instead of chicken.  I also had many small tomatoes from my garden that I finely chopped in addition to a can of toms.  I added garlic, 1/2 stick of butter, onion powder and dried onion and I used 1% milk vs whipping cream.  I have to say it turned out well and with a fraction of the fat and calories.

Quick, easy and delicious.  
I substituted milk for the cream, used Smart Balance rather than butter, about a TSP of dried basil rather than fresh, and added a clove of fresh garlic and it was still fantastic.

This recipe was very easy to make in under 30 minutes and tasted very good.  I did have to add a bit more sugar to take the acidity out (around 3 TBSP) and probably could have used a bit more basil.  I put garlic croutons and shredded parmesan in my bowl and it was fabulous.  The next time I may try it with one can of crushed and one can of diced tomatoes to make it a little thicker.  All in all a very good recipe.

I really liked this recipe! It was super quick and easy. Just what I needed for a day when I had nothing prepared and we needed something fast! It took me only about ten minutes to prepare from start to finish. I followed other suggestions to add only a few TBs of butter. I also added an additional two cups of milk because I prefer my soup a bit thinner, just a personal preference.

I love tomato soup and have tried several recipes.  This was my favorite so far.  I think that having both the chicken broth and cream was the "secret".  Yummy!

WOW this makes a lot! I didn't like it as written but made lots of subs and make it quite often now. I only use 1 can of tomato's and 1/2 the butter. Then I add milk to my taste. Really turns out great. Giving a 3 rating for as is and my version a 5. Thanks for a starting point!

I have made this recipe several times, and it has been a hit every time.  I do decrease the butter by about half, but that is my only change!  

Due to health issues, my Father-In-Law has been a VERY finicky eater.  Some meals he refuses everything, including foods he ate the day before!!  But, the three times I made this soup he not only ate the whole bowl, but demanded seconds  EVERY TIME. (unheard of from him!)  

Super Easy, Super Yummy!

Cut back on the butter like some others had suggested.  Was looking for a really good tom and basil soup.  Didn't like this at all-too tart for me, prefer a sweeter tomato soup.  However, my husband loved it!!  Very easy recipe though.

So easy and very yummy. Did make some changes however to suit our tastes. Used less sugar, added salt and pepper, more broth (it was a little too tomatoey for us as is) and less butter as per the other recommendation. Overall, a great easy and flavourful soup using ingredients that are often on hand. Thanks.

Only used about 2/3 the amount of butter or so per the other reviews. Seemed perfect to me. Left no trace of grease floating on the top that way. Seems to be better the second day. Not quite as good as some of my favorite versions but very good and very tasty. May half the recipe and make often.

Very Good Soup! My grocery store offers petite diced canned tomatoes with basin & oregano already mixed in so I used that IPO chopping fresh basil.  For a little bit heartier of a soup - fry and crumble some bacon and stir in.  Very hearty - very good, goes great with a fresh homemade loaf of bread.  Thanks!!
