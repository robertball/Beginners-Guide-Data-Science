We tried it.  The pork belly didn't absorb any flavor.  I ended up draining the juice into a pan and reducing it.  Then I tossed the meat so there was at least a little flavor there. 
We won't make it again.

Absolutely delicious. Used half plum vinegar and added some spicy barbecue sauce, cayenne, paprika, and a while onion.
