The cooking til tender, actually took me 80 minutes!  That is 80 minutes of stirring and standing at the stove.! Even though I cut my veggies up (except the onion that I started with) in between stirring , that is still a long time! But I was determined to make healthier *brown* rice risotto. I also had to use over 12 cups of liquid instead of the 10 the recipe called for. I changed  1 cup of that to white wine to add  more flavor .  And ,7 cups was broth and the remaining water.  The result was a delicious veggie risotto that I *might* make  again if I pull up a chair and call my favorite chatty friend.. haha...

This is a lovely idea. Short grain brown rice is not easy to find, but it's worth it. I didn't use any water, but otherwise used all the ingredients in the recipe. It took both more time to cook and more liquid than stated in the recipe, about another quart of stock. Used only veggie stock. Although delicious, it is not risotto, but I would likely make it again. Thanks!

This recipe took a very long time to make but was pretty good. The smell is FANTASTIC, the first few bites were delicious, but the more I ate it, the more I got tired of the taste. I paired it with ritz crackers and a tarty drink & it balanced the flavor out. It is more suited as a side. Also, this is waaay more than six servings. I think I served myself two and it was less that 1/6 of the entire recipe.

Although I made a lot of changes, I still give this recipe the props for getting me to a delicious brown rice risotto! 

First, I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because that's what I had on-hand. Second, I only used the onion from this recipe, and added mushrooms a few minutes after saut√©ing the onion and garlic (used mushrooms because I was pairing this with chicken marsala). The mushroom flavor really stood out at the end - it was delicious!

Will definitely be making this again, maybe next time with more veggies!

Made this with eggplant parm the other night for some friends who absolutely hate vegetables, not only did it draw high praise, but everyone had seconds! Yum, yum, yum!

It was delicious.  My first time making risotto and I was very pleased with it.  Will continue to make it from now on.

I cooked this for an hour and the rice was still very hard and the vegetables were mush. I did the recipe to the letter.  Had to trash it. Will not try again.

For me, this was labor intensive. That phrase "...stirring constantly" is not to be taken lightly. I wish I steamed the vegetables first but brown rice just takes a loooooong time to cook. Once I ran out of broth, I used some cheap white wine. It was fine in the end but not stellar.
