I thought this was good. I love mushrooms. Just curious as to why someone who says they do not like mushrooms would make mushroom soup? And then rate this?

This was delicious! My husband said it was "awesome," which is rare. A helpful tip - use a bag of packaged coleslaw to cut down on prep time with the carrot and cabbage!

this soup is so yummy and gets spicier as you eat it.  we made it with no noodles, added vegetable stock, left some smaller mushrooms whole, left out the cabbage, and added bean sprouts.  we also used left over chicken that had been cooked in barbeque sauce

Having just purchased a beautiful assortment of mushrooms, I wanted to make mushroom soup and found this recipe.  I usually have to majorly doctor up recipes for taste, but this one is good.  The soup is so versitle, so my changes were minor--Used shrimp instead of chicken and added hot sauce. Also used more broth.  I am living in China at the moment and this is as good as I've eaten in any restaurant.

Good tasting recipe but needed a little more broth and a few drops of Vietnamese hot sauce.

I like everything about this recipe except the mushrooms - I admit that I am not much of a mushroom fan, but three cups are WAY too much imo. Also, I used mostly shittakes, and I have decided that their taste is too strong for me. I wish I'd made a trip to the Japanese grocers and got enoki 'shrooms - I really like their delicate flavor and crunchy texture. I probably won't make this again, but thanks anyway.

I didn't have the chicken on-hand, so I made mine vegetarian with veggie broth and added white onion, articoke, celery. I also used rice noodles instead of the recommended. I would say this is a great, fresh-tasting Asian soup that I would make again.

This was good right after making but was outstanding as leftovers, same as most any soup. I used sherry instead of mirin and added some enoki mushrooms as well. Used Korean soy sauce with kelp extract (much lower sodium than regular low sodium, 285 vs 575).  As leftovers I added "Pot Stickers, Traditional" instead of udon and chicken.

Very good and certainly a quick dinner.  I used a bag of shredded cabbage for cole slaw and omitted the chicken.  It was still hearty and we didn't miss the chicken

This soup was very good.  I made it like it was written, no changes.  Like a lot of others mentioned there wasn't a lot of broth, I would definitely double everything but leave the veggies and chicken the same.  The soup tasted wonderful and I will definitely make it again.

It was good but didn't stay very well in the fridge after a couple days it felt...slimy? Immediately after I made it, though, it was delicious. Maybe I need to freeze next time.

Loved it!

My Daughter and I made this "on the fly" after returning from an authentic sushi establishment hours before. Inspired, yet still hungry for more, we decided to look up a simple soup to satiate our needs. Perfect! Quick, easy and versatile. While we didn't have all the ingredients in our pantry, the base recipe was great.

I definitely recommend the "low sodium" recommendations. i.e., soy sauce, chicken broth. You can always add salt, you can't take it away. We used low sodium soy sauce, broth, canned portabello mushrooms, ginger powder, minced garlic and finely diced shallot,& shredded carrot. We skipped the cabbage, spinach and replaced spring onion with shallot, because we didn't have it. We Salt and peppered to taste. 

We were fortunate to have Mirin and Udon noodles. I highly recommend. It really DOES make an authentic difference. We recommend the Udon noodles because of cooking time and texture. The Mirin because of it's subtle sweetness. The shallot worked just as well for flavor, but I can see how the green onion does make it aesthetically pleasing. 

Either way, it was a very light, crisp, comforting, pleasing and satisfying result. Preparation was easy. Great recipe with innumerable applications. In this case, simple was perfect. Thank you!

This was a fantastic!  I followed this exactly except I did not find mirin or Udon noodles.  I used another type of asian rice noodle instead.  I also recomend a squeeze of a lime wedge into your bowl! (not the entire pot)  I learned that from a local vietnamese place, it's a must!  My 10 year old daughter said it tasted just like the  soup we have at our favorite Japanese Habatci grill.  My husand who is very nit picky, agreed with her!

The 3 cups of cabbage and 1 cub of carrots made this soup very sweet.  Even with extra soy, it was not savory enough for me to enjoy.  One thing is that it is very healthy, so I'll finish this, and will not make it again.

I made this recipe vegetarian with vegetable broth. I also made one with chicken broth for my carnivorous husband...he liked mine better! It was good and easy to prepare one serving.

Was pretty good. I used asian cabbage, extra garlic, rice noodles, hot sauce, and graham masala spice. This was very tasty.

I came across this recipe while searching for a soup with spinach in it.  I happened to have the other ingredients, so I'm glad I tried it.  I used dried shiitake mushrooms (soaked them first in hot water), and pre-shredded cabbage.  I bought the mirin along time ago, but this was the first time I used it. The taste was impressive. Nothing like I imagined it might taste. This recipe is a keeper.

I always get soup from the chinese restaurant and none have been as flavorful as this one.  I added more broth because once I added all the veggies there didn't seem to be enough.  The soup was better the following day however the noodles were overcooked so next time I'll keep the noodles separate so if I have some leftover the following day I can add the noodles after I heat the soup up so they aren't mushy. Very good- I used exotic mushrooms! Delicious!

I varied this a little, but kept the essential flavor.  I used 3 c water and 2 bouillion cubes, only 2 T soy sauce because I did not have the low sodium kind, and then I omitted the udon noodles and chicken.  I added a little zucchini for extra veggies.  It has a good flavor, provided you love mushrooms!

Subbed thai rice noodles and there wasn't enough broth so ended up diluting flavors adding boiled water to it just to cook the noodles.  Maybe better sticking with udon noodles.

This was a very nice soup.  Easy adjustment for low carbers...just leave the noodles out.   I didn't add the spinach at the end because there were plenty of the other ingredients.  Very filling and guilt free.. But you absolutely need more broth or water.

Finally a REALLY healthy soup! The first time I made it, it was a little sweet from the Mirin.  I left out the mirin this time.  Used organic vegetable broth this time, too. Also, added enoki, portabello, shitake and oyster mushrooms.
Instead of cabbage, we used baby bok choy. Fresh udon noodles from the refrigerated section of the asian store.  Added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and it was perfect! I hope "all recipes.com" gets more of these health-conscious recipes.

We loved this soup.  It probably deserves 4.5 stars.  I used enoki mushroom and udon noodles from the asian market.  It was more of a stew than a soup.  It made a lot and we had it for 2 dinners and several lunches and I froze the leftovers.

OMG i actualy loved this soup! its so great, i admit i used a little bit more soya sauce (ive got V salty taste) but this is SO going to become a regular in my house. Also u can easily turn it Vegetarian by using tofu and vege stock instead of the chicken and chicken stock.

Great base recipe.  Absolutely delicious.  Definitely needs more broth (almost double). l cut down on the veggies a little, And added some bok choy instead of so much cabbage.  Wifey loved it as is, and I liked it with a little Sriracha.??

Made it vegetarian without chicken, but surprisingly flavorful and super easy. This is definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed making this recipe. I used both fresh and dried mushrooms, and added a little more ginger and garlic than the recipe suggested. It's all to taste, I don't think you can mess this recipe up. After reading some reviews I used the 2 cups of broth I rehydrated the dried mushrooms in and added to the 4 cups of chicken broth. It was great without adding any type of noodles, very hearty, healthy and satisfying. I will definately make it again and try new combinations or shrimp rather than chicken and add noodles and perhaps some fresh herbs. A+

Thank you - very nice recipe.  I left out the noodles for a low carb eater, left out the chicken because we had meat in a main dish.  Still very good.  I used rice wine vinegar in place of mirin, about 2 T.  Also sauteed the cabbage a little, added mushrooms and lightly sauteed those too.  Followed the recipe after that.  Delicious and filling.  I can see ways to adapt this for different meals and ingredients.

Great soup, added more broth and replaced white cabbage with purple cabbage, Had great flavor and appeals to the eye with all the different colors. I will be making this again.

This is definately one of my favorite recipes.  It's a good soup for when you're sick.  It's so quick to make yet there is so much to this soup.  You can also get creative with your choice of mushrooms.  I agree; however, that it needs more broth.  I doubled the broth.  I also enjoy it topped off with some sriracha.

I have been making this exact recipe for years . ! found the recipe in some  magazine . The first time I made it , it was so good I cut it out and laminated it.  I can barely read it now , so I just printed a fresh copy from you. Thank you very much! The only thing I changed is I use Bok- Choy it adds a delicious flavor to the original recipe . Give it five and a haft if you can !

I skipped the broth and used the liquor from the dried shiitake mushrooms that I reconstituted, adding more water to make up the 4 cups.  Also, I used the flavor packets that the udon noodles came with.  So good.

We prefer it with shrimp instead of chicken. I added a one pound bag of thawed frozen shrimp the last five minutes, and then stirred in a teaspoon of sriracha just before serving for just a hint of spiciness.

Loved this!  Didn't add the cabbage, but had everything else.  I was looking for some comfort food (had a cold) so I added more garlic, and used a package of fresh udon noodles.  It was delicious  - Wouldn't change a thing!

Very good soup! I made as directed with extra broth as suggested by previous reviewer. I also substituted sherry for mirin as someone else suggested since I didn't have mirin on hand. I added a little cilantro and some chili oil I had on hand to spice it up. Turned out great!

It was just really bland.  I used a wide variety of mushrooms and every single ingredient it called for.  It didn't really have any flavor beyond chicken broth and soy sauce.  I ate it with no issues, but I won't be going out of my way to make it again.

A lovely soup. I substituted coleslaw for the cabbage and carrots and saved myself a little time. As others have said about the "most helpful" negative review, why make a mushroom soup if you don't enjoy mushrooms and then rate the recipe based on your dislike of mushrooms? Obviously, if you don't like mushrooms, this soup wouldn't be a very good choice for you, considering the fact it is a mushroom soup.

This is a great meal and reheats well.  I used a whole chicken from the deli to make it easy.  Also, I am on weight watchers so I used pasta zero for the pasta making the chicken the only item with points! I used napa cabbage as white cabbage and found a mix of oyster and button mushrooms the best.  A regular recipe for u.

This was a quick, simple and delicious soup!  I did add another cup of broth.  My family all liked it a lot.  I will definitely make this again.  It is even good for someone that isn't overly fond of mushrooms (like my daughter) as the mushroom flavour is not overwhelming.

I cut out the chicken breast to make this vegan and instead of the chicken broth, I used water and Edward & Sons Not Beef bouillon. I also used more veggies to make this a heartier meal. Came out perfect and delicious. This is now going to be a regular at my home.

I made this with twice as much chicken and udon noodles and it turned out fine, although I needed to add extra water to keep the right proportions. I used 1 8-oz. package of regular mushrooms, half a package of frozen spinach, about one carrot and a bunch of green onions to make the amount suggested, although these could have been doubled as well. In addition to the fact that all the measurements were in cups, which I found a bit confusing, the directions could be clearer - one needs to cook both the chicken and the noodles first to make it work with the cooking time allotted (and not get salmonella). ;)

Definitely needed more than 4 cups chicken stock, ended up adding almost 4 cups of water.  Also, I used mushroom soy sauce instead and added some dumplings.  It was great!

So this did not turn out nearly as good as I expected- the base of the soup was completely lacking. As per other reviews, I added more broth and actually used a combination of chicken broth and reconstituted shitake mushroom broth. I ended up adding 2 T of sesame oil and 1/4 cup of sherry and 1 tsp of sugar, which made a HUGE difference..along with a little extra garlic and ginger. I think possibly making a ginger syrup would work better as this could add the sweetness and depth while also bringing forth the ginger flavor. After all is said and done, it's a DECENT soup, but leaves much room for improvement!

Good soup,I made is as stated but used turkey meat instead...changed the flavor some but it was still good. Be sure to add the noodles very close to the end... if you let the soup simmer with them in, it gets thick and milky looking... it still tasted good but the texture was off.  Also next time I'll sautee the ginger, garlic and mushrooms in butter or oil first then add the other ingredients.  The mushrooms' flavor didn't come out as strong as I'd have liked, hopefully sauteeing them will help.

I followed the instructions exactly, (leaving out only the chicken and spinach) and it was a very disappointing soup. I ate one bowl and threw out the rest. What a waste.

My husband especially loved the flavor of this soup.  The mushrooms make the broth very rich.  I drizzled a little sesame oil on the top of each serving, which added a nice layer of flavor.    Make your own chicken broth if you have time -- less salty, more flavorful.

Gave this a 5 because it is far better than any restaurant chinese soup I've tried. Used rice sticks for the noodles and did have to add extra chicken broth. Added a little finely chopped red and yellow bell peppers simply to brighten it up. Wonderful flavor. See my photo.

This soup was really good and hearty! I added more broth and I also added about a tablespoon or two of sri racha hot sauce (the one with the rooster on the label), this extra spice gave it the kick it needed. Delicious!

This is really good.  I scaled the recipe down to serve 3, and I wound up doubling the liquid it called for.  I also doubled the amount of garlic and it still wasn't enough for me so I'll add more next time.  This was just wonderful to use the mushroom assortment I got at the store today.  I, too, was perplexed as to the mushroom-hating reviewer.

I omitted the chicken and used tofu instead. Also left out the soy sauce but it still has good flavor (just add a little extra garlic and ginger)

Outstanding!  I modified it to account for what I had on hand.  Swiss chard instead of cabbage, crimini mushrooms, and no chicken.  I also added a splash of chili oil and a splash of sesame oil.

This was delicious.  The changes I made were as follows:

1 extra Tbl of mirin
2 extra tsp of chicken boullion
1 extra clove of garlic
1 extra Tbl soy sauce
Also used 3 cups of pre-soaked mixes dried Costco mushrooms and frozen instead of fresh spinach.

I used all of the original ingredients, but used shrimp instead of chicken.  I, also, used a dash of MSG.  I loved this recipe.  It was easy, tasty, and healthy.

This had a really good flavor but I did not like the texture that the pasta added to it (I had no udon noodles and use regular pasta) I would say if you are going to make this go the extra mile and get all the right (original) ingredients.

Yummy, and super easy.  I didn't have any cabbage or spinach, so I substituted broccoli and rainbow card.  It was really good!  The broth is very good, I will be making this healthy and easy recipe again!!

This was really good, but it was a touch heavy on the ginger for my taste--and I love ginger. I used vegetable broth and omitted the chicken. I loved the combo of veggies--but there were a lot, so I used 6 cups of broth and adjusted the seasonings accordingly. I also added wakame (seaweed), and I tossed in a cup of bean sprouts at the end. Really an enjoyable soup--next time, I'll use even more mushrooms.
