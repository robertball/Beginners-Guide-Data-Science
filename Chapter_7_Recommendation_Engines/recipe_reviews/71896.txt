This is a very easy, but not so much authentic way to make this wonderful dessert. Instead of cooking the rice in water use the coconut milk and add sugar to taste. This will make the rice have the "sticky" consistency and the more beautiful appearance. The flavor using this method is much more creamy and rich while still being light.

Very yummy!  This is my favorite desert that I order in Thai restaraunts.  This recipe has the same flavor, but it doesn't look the same or have the same consistency as you would get in a restaraunt.  But who cares!  It tastes wonderful!  I made the rice with my rice cooker and made it exactly as written, except I used Jasmine rice because it's all I had on hand.  Next time I will use less sugar - that much sugar really made the rice a bit "watery".  I've seen recipes for this dish that are more difficult - steaming sticky rice and boiling the coconut milk with sugar and salt to thicken it.  But I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because of how easy it was to make.

I really like this recipe. Very easy to make. I used my rice cooker. I put 3/4c. of rice and 1/2c. of sugar. Letit cook all together. This is a really light desert! Great for summer time.

Delicious, just like the sweet sticky rice I've had in Thai restaurants. Very easy to make.

I LOVED this recipe! I did use brown sugar because I ran out of white. I served it as dessert after salmon burgers, and it was the talk of the table.

I mixed the sugar in with the water, and also substituted some of the water with coconut milk.  Unfortunately the mixture came out too watery.  I've made great coconut rice with a similar recipe, so I must be doing something wrong somewhere.

This is a good easy way to do this desert. I love this no matter how it's cooked and I'm a chocolate person--you should try this!

Okay, but it just didn't live up to the sweet rice I've had in restuarants.  Will keep looking for other recipes.

People went insane, myself included, over this recipe! I wanted something that "felt like the very first time" I had Mango Sticky Rice and Thai food.  This delivers! Thanks! Side note, MAKE SURE you get CREAM of coconut, it is different.  I say this because I almost bought coconut milk and the man at my Asian American supermarket explained that they were different.
