Very good, though I had to make my own salsa (can of diced tomatoes,  three or four mini peppers, 1 jalape√±o, half onion processed in a food processor). I added Emeril's essence. I also doubled all the seasonings. Glad to use the turkey since I'm on a special diet for the gut at present.

I made it exactly as written and we loved it. Originally thought it looked like it was going to be dry, but once the grated  cheese was added and melted a bit, it was perfect.

These were super simple and turned out great. Be sure to use a salsa you are familiar with and like. My go to is Pace picante and it worked perfectly in this. This recipe is a keeper.
