THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER!!!!! I have spread the word on this one.  Very easy to make.  I added a can of white chicken breast and a 1/4 tsp. of chili powder.  My 7 year old grandson thought it was the best thing he ever tasted.  Way to get them to eat their vegetables.  My husband wants me to make it again real soon.  I agree the slotted spoon helped alot, but the extra sauce over the top made is tasty and soft.  I just hope people can find it in the recipe search.  My friend thought eggplant might be good to try instead of zucchini. (It's a thought)

Let's just say I was dancing while I ate these... like I couldn't even stay seated. I couldn't even keep my feet still. I was like, "What kind of evil dark magic is this that makes my feet dance and my taste buds happy?!?!?!"

I used a little less tomato and used all the mixture to fill the tortillas, I then covered them with Salsa and cheese - thou not quite as much as the recipe called for.  It tasted fantastic and I will definitely make this again. 
The leftovers were great for lunch the next day as well.

So glad we made this! We used reduced fat cheese and also, instead of adding calories by making 10 minimally filled tortillas, we made 4 stuffed tortillas. Same amount of calories from the veggies (which is obviously minimal anyway) but far fewer calories by going from 10 tortillas to 4. Voila.

These turned out SO good! I did need to add seasonings for our tastes, but this is a great recipe base. I added fresh garlic, plenty of cumin, chili powder, and a little oregano. I totally forgot to save some filling for the tops, so I poured a little green enchilada sauce over top to keep it moist. Great way to use up some of that zucchini my garden is producing so rapidly. I'm looking forward to having leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Yum. Thanks!

These were very good. I added some garlic and some shredded rotisserie chicken. I made some with flour tortillas and some with corn tortillas. I also forgot to add the cheese to the inside so I just put it on top. I used a Mexican blend cheese and only used about a cup worth. Nice easy healthy meal. Thanks.

Everyone loved these! My 6yr old did say a word the entire time she was eating hers. I made 2 slight changes. I added 1 clove minced fresh garlic and served them on/in whole wheat tortillas instead of flour tortillas. Great way to use up tomatoes and zucchini from the garden. Thanks!

We really loved these and my husband was surprised how much he liked them, considering no meat involved. There was a lot of liquid in the pan from my juicy tomatoes, so I drained the vegetables in a colander to avoid soggy tortillas. I also used some minced garlic and Italian seasoning in my vegetable mixture. You could easily add in some chicken, shrimp or even black beans. I served with Quick black beans and rice on this site. I'm glad I tried this recipe.

These were pretty standard. I suppose this much cheese will make anything good.

This is a very good recipe. I made it exactly as written but I was out of tortillas, so I just served it as a sauteed vegetable side dish. Everyone liked it. My DH wants me to try it again and cut the veggies smaller and add some eggs and make some breakfast tacos which I will try soon. Either way this was very good. Thanks for the post.

Very yummy!  I added a chopped jalapeño to the mixture and a half teaspoon of cumin and used corn tortillas instead of flour. It was delicious!  Will make again

This recipe is great for using up summer squash and tomatoes. I added a generous sprinkle of cumin, dash of oregano and 1/4 tsp mild chili powder to the sautéing onions. Also, drain the cooked veggies in a large colander and reduce the collected liquid a little to make a nice sauce to pour over the top of the filled tortillas before adding cheese and baking (I put all the filling inside the tortillas and just put the reduced liquid and cheese on top.) About 4-5 oz of a shredded cheddar and jack combo was plenty of cheese for me.

Love this, the first time i made it I was so skeptical of it tasting good and turning out, but with no seasoning other than salt and pepper and its amazing. you must use a slatted spoon though to prepare the dish the veggies sweat too much liquid

Was a winner among vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Spooning the veggies into the tortillas with a slotted spoon helped keep extra liquid out. One and a half pounds of cheese is overkill though. I used only 1/3 pound, sprinkled some inside the tortillas and then the rest on top and there was plenty to go around. Made it quite a bit healthier too. Quick and easy, tasty and delicious, even as leftovers!

Wow! These are amazing! I read the recipe and thought, "but what about the sauce?" I kept worrying that these would be gross. But, the tomato breaks down and makes a beautifully light sauce that compliments all the flavors. We added a little garlic, but that's it. This is a real keeper for sure!!

After reading other reviews I made a few minor changes and absolutely loved this recipe.  First I only made 1/2 the recipe.  I cut down on the tomatoes a little, added some salsa, cumin, and seasoning salt.  After cooking I also topped w/ a little light sour cream. I am always looking to cut fat so I used an 8 oz pkg of the reduced fat mexican cheese mixture and it was plenty in both amount and flavor. As other said, use a slotted spoon.

Loved it! This recipe is just plain delicious.  I cooked up a bit of chicken and red and green peppers and added to the vegetables listed.  Like others, added some spices, garlic salt, cumin, and cut back on the amount of cheese.  Thanks, Barbie!

I liked the filling on this, but overall they just seemed kind of dry and in need of a sauce. I did lighten them up some. I used half butter and half oil for sauteeing. I used 2 cups of pepper jack, probably 1/3 of the suggested amount, and corn tortillas. I really liked  the filling. I left out the mushrooms, so I doubled the zucchini. I didnt have a fresh tomato, so I used a can of drained low sodium petite diced tomatoes. I would make the filling on its own with a sprinkle of cheese as a side dish. As a burrito, though, it just needed something more besides the cheese.

Cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8 x 8 pan.  Followed directions, except did not add mushrooms (we don't care for them).  Very nice and easy way to use up those garden zucchini and tomatoes.  We loved it.  Thanks for posting a great hit in this house, Barbie.

This was really amazing!  My husband loved it.  Only change I made was to use fresh salsa instead of the onion and tomatoes to add a little extra flavor.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

I loved these. I didn't have the suggested cheese so I used Colby jack (lots of it) and I added some cooked chicken that I had in the fridge. I didn't have any mushrooms but I did have red and yellow peppers. It was a nice addition. I will make this again.

I mixed some canned pinto beans, chopped sweet potato, and a little salsa into the veggie mixture and served them topped with the cheese and some sour cream, and even my 2-year-old loved this! This recipe is easy, versatile, and really tasty.

Fantastic! My wife loved it. Definitely a keeper. Using a collander or slotted spoon before filling tortillas will ensure that they are not runny.

Edit to add: I didn't use all of the cheese. I eyeballed it and used the amount that I thought I would like, which is less than the recipe stated. Original Post: Hearty and filling. I bought sliced mushrooms that were pretty big, and I don't have a food processor, so I decided to leave those as is and put them on top the zucchilattas. I wanted the filling to be finer. I sauteed the mushrooms in butter, but did not pre-cook the other vegetables as the recipe is written. I warmed the tortillas on the stove over a flame. I filled the inside of the tortillas with raw, chopped zucchini and onion, which was in pretty small pieces, and diced tomato pieces that were a little larger, plus the cheese. I also added one clove of garlic to the mixture. On top of the rolled tortillas, I put the mushroom and cheese mixture and one 10-oz. can of medium green chile enchilada sauce. I used four 12" tortillas and overfilled them instead of 10 smaller tortillas. The tortillas almost tasted like thin crust pizza dough, the mushrooms were perfectly meaty, the zucchini gave it the right amount of crunch, and the garlic added a little kick, but not an overwhelming amount.

The family gobbled them up. Super easy to make.  My very picky child, who at the time didn't like zucchini, ate these with gusto and asked for seconds.  Super easy. We made it according to directions, as  I am not a big enchilada sauce fan, I made a second batch using mild salsa instead. Both were fantastic.

Made it twice in a month!  So easy and delicious.  The first time I made it I didn't have enough tomatoes and felt like it wasn't saucy enough so I added some tomato juice for thickness and some cumin for flavor- my three year old loved it, my hubby loved it.  Second time, the grandparents were coming over so I doubled the recipe and used eggplant (G-ma has problems with oxolates) and less tomato than called for again, adding a little TJ again... Can't go wrong!  I'll definitely be trying other versions!

Really good and easy! I followed Pfeffa's suggestions on adding spices and draining the liquid, and will definitely make them again.  I might even try using canned, diced tomatoes when good tomatoes aren't available.

I thought I was going to love these, because of the reviews and because I love veggies, but they were not that great to me.  I would have given it less stars, but my husband liked it, so this is our average rating. Ha.  

I really didn't feel they had that much flavor and I tasted too much tortilla.  plus the tortillas got soggy.

Very good, and excellent way to get your veggies in!  I substituted an orange bell pepper for the mushrooms since I don't like them, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Very good leftover too!

I made this tonight for my hubby, 11 and 7 year old. I halved the recipe and we ate the whole thing. I made with low carb tort. and it was AMAZING!! Very healthy and full of veggies. My kids liked to just fill the tort. with the veggie mixture and just eat that way. I would recommend to anyone!!!

I made this recipe for me and my non-vegetarian boyfriend and we both loved it.  I topped it with salsa and cheese rather than more zucchini mixture.  I also added some cumin to the mixture for more flavor.

This was just ok as is. I'd use some of the other suggestions such as trying Cheddar/Monterey Jack Cheese combination, or Mexican Cheese and maybe even leave the tomato out & pour salsa over the top. If the changes add some zip to it then I'd rate it higher.

A good and easy vegetarian meal.  I skipped the tomatoes, filled the tortillas with all of the mushroom/zucchini mixture and part of the cheese, then emptied a jar of salsa over the top.  I sprinkled some more cheese on top.  However, an 8 oz  bag of shredded Mexican blend cheese was plenty.

As a meatless meal, this recipe is excellant! It's very easy to put together.  I like to use the extra large flour tortillas which make it easier to get a good amount of the veg. mixture in without it falling out.  I also used a cheddar & monteray jack combination for the topping which gives a good cheese flavor.  This recipe is going to be a regular in this household...

This recipe was a huge hit with the whole family.  Makes a lot so you'd better have a huge frying pan!  Leftovers were great for bagged lunches.  I notice the description of the recipe says "drowned in melted cheddar cheese" but the recipe itself calls for Monterey Jack.  I wonder which cheese the recipe called for originally.  I used Monterey Jack but I imagine cheddar would be good too.  I love how the ingredients for this recipe are so common.  It's very easy to make.  Thank you!

This was very delicious, especially with some slight modifications. My wife doesn't like tomato, so I left them out and topped it with 10 oz of enchilada sauce before baking. I also used 1 lb of cheese instead of 1.5 and it still seems like quite a bit (not that I'm complaining, but it could likely be cut down to .75 pounds and still be tasty).

These are really great and a good use of your garden!  I seasoned with cumin and chili powder. There were 8 tortillas in a package so I just made them bigger. I also put the mixture in a colander over a bowl. I used the juice in  bottom of the pan a and little over the top.  Backed 25 minutes for a crispy top.


I always use a spiralizer to cut zucchini, then chop it to size. Much quicker

This was a fantastic starter recipe. I added 2 fresh jalapenos to the veggies. It is "Mexican" so you have to spice it up. We used cayenne,  paprika,  fresh garlic,  tyme, rosemary and slap yo mama Cajun in the veggies, salt and pepper. we also topped with queso cheese, shredded lettuce,  tomatoes, green onions, sour cream and hot sauce. We loved it! oh yeah, we fried more mushrooms and garlic up and put that on top too. DELICIOUS!

I felt that this recipe was not specific enough for an amateur cook such as myself. However, it turned out great. I made one change: I added a very small amount of Mexican spices (chile powder, cumin etc.) to give it more flavor. Biggest drawback was the time to slice a whole pound of mushrooms. Next time I'll get the sliced ones. Also used smaller corn tortillas instead of flour. Again, more Mexican flavor.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I am a flexitarian.  I eat very little meat and this recipe was very simple but good.  The only difference is I added fresh peppers and used a dash or two of seasoning salt.   I did not measure out the mushrooms (approx. 1 cup is what I had) but will add more next time to give it just a tad more substance.  Enjoyed the simplicity of making this recipe and the flavors coming together at the completion of the meal.

Very good recipe. I took the suggestions of others by adding more spices (chili powder, oregano, garlic powder, cumin), and generously filled five large, extra soft tortillas. I added a can of chicken breast to my husband's portion and used reduced-fat cheese.  This made more than enough for a meal, plus leftovers. Delicious!

These were phenomenal.  It made so much food that I wound up having a second pan to freeze for later. Since my veggies gave off so much liquid, I used a slotted spoon to scoop them into the tortillas, and then used the "juice" as a sauce on top instead of more veggies. I cannot WAIT to get my hands on those leftovers!!

I made this last night & my family loved it. I used about half of the amount of tomatos and added garlic power & oregano seasonings. As I was building the enchilada, I added black beans & used mexican/taco cheese. I will definitely make this again!

I liked these. They were good and tasty and I would make them again but I wasn't blown away by them. They tasted pretty much like veggie burritos. It was a nice simple recipe that helped me use up some extra zucchini. I agree with the one poster who said that anything smothered in cheese will taste good!

I would have given 4 stars but I deducted a star because the recipe needed a bit of tweaking. I thought they would be too bland as is so I added: garlic, 1 tsp. each of basil and smoked paprika. I also added a bit of balsamic vinegar to the veggies when they were cooking. The recipe says sliced zucchini but I think you really want cubed otherwise I think it'd be too hard to roll the tortilla shells. I  cut down on the cheese considerably -- used maybe 1/3 of what was called for and they still tasted plenty cheesy. I added some of the cheese to the veggies since they were a bit watery and it helped bind the veggies together more. I didn't really see the point of warming the tortillas in the oven first since they'll get warm in the oven anyway so I'll skip that next time, especially since if you aren't watching carefully, the shells get hard and then they're too hard to roll. I ran out of veggies to be able to put much on the top so next time I'll have use some more veggies or have some fresh tomato for on top. I might add some beans next time. And some coriander would be good too.

It was probably just the wrong mix of vegetables for me, but I did not care for this recipe.

This was so delicious, the only thing I added was some garlic powder because I was was out of the cloves! I layered mine instead of rolling because I made homemade tortillas and they were a little small to roll! This one is definitely going on the rotation!

I absolutely love this recipe! To give it more of a Mexican kick, I add a teaspoon of cumin, paprika, chilli powder, and garlic powder. It has become a favourite in our household!

I really just paid attention to the cooking times in this recipe. I threw in the veggies that I wanted and used the kind of cheese I had in the fridge...  It's rare that I ever follow a recipe word for word anymore. My husband loved it!!!! I will be making this again!!!

Great recepie but I would suggest adding a bit of lime juice, and pinch of cayenne pepper and I use the monteray jack with Jalapeno in it.  I also top it with some salsa and sour creme.

Just a few small changes to give is a bit more kick.  Overall I have always been really happy with this one and the family loves it!

I wanted to use up some tomatoes and zucchini from our garden so I searched Allrecipes!  These where very tasty and easy to make.  My husband was concerned that the leftovers would be too soft, but they weren't - they were good!  We will make again.

Made it as-is the first time. Next time, I added black beans, cumin and leftover butternut squash. Could use just about any leftover veggie.

Added green mild enchilada sauce and shredded chicken, just a little strip down the middle of each tortilla.  This was awesome!!!  All kids ate but two (one slept through it and another decided to be a whiny 5 yo go figure).  Will make this A LOT with all the squash I'm getting from the garden!

Going to make these tonight but I can tell that the recipe needs some herbs/spices to make it truly "enchilada-esque" So, I'll be adding chili powder, garlic (real garlic), cumin and oregano. Can't wait!

I love this and definitely will make it again.  The only alteration I made was to add 1 jalapeño pepper to the vegetable mixture.  Dish was savory and delicious with just a hint of heat.  Fed a huge lunch crowd and still had enough to eat later for dinner! Incredibly easy way to immediately use up extra zucchini.

I made this dish last night.  It was terrific.  Other reviewers were concerned about having enough sauce.  I had some sauce but I did add some red enchilada sauce before baking and it was more than enough.  
As an added spice, I did add some Mexican oregano!

Loved them! Next time I will use less cheese and add something like beans to the mixture and a cream of mushroom soup to add a little sauce. Overall, very easy and tasty. I appreciate how quick it is too!

INCREDIBLE. This was soooo good and pretty easy! I had a TON of zucchini to use up. I didnt change anything, but man this made a lot.. we will have leftovers for days. I will totally make this again, but will scale down the recipe and add more seasoning. I like it spicy.

This recipe was an awesome family eat.  We love to make recipes together, and my boyfriend and I knew that this would be a winner just from the yummy ingredients!  Definitely flavorful, and quick, plus I didn't feel fat after I ate it, and my kids ate every last bite!  They are 5 and 6 y/o little girls!

Cheers!!

Absolutely delicious. Cut the recipe in half for a smaller crowd and it was perfect.  The only thing I did differently is that I drained the sauteed vegetables in a colander before I filled the tortillas so that it wouldn't be too runny. Even my husband who is a "meat" eater loved this recipe.  Will definitely makes this many more times.
