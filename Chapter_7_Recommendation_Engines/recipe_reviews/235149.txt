The taste was good, but it did not cook in 20 minutes.  The barley was hard as a rock.  I had to cook it longer, and add another 2 cups of broth.  It probably could have used a third cup, but I didn't mind the heartiness.  I usually cook barley for 45 min to an hour in soup.

Very simple, and delicious! I added corn and peas into the mix, and added some white pepper and Marcum Soul Seasoning for a slight degree of flavorful heat!
It's a keeper

Super quick, easy, & delicious. You can easily modify too, if you want to add different vegetables or add some herbs or whatever.

Very tasty soup but as another reviewer said, barley takes  up to  an hour to cook.  If you want this soup ready in 20 minutes, you would need to use quick cooking barley or soak your barley ahead of time.  I added some coriander powder and dried cilantro leaves otherwise per recipe.  Very hearty soup for a cold day!  Will make again using fresh cilantro.  Thank you for the recipe.
