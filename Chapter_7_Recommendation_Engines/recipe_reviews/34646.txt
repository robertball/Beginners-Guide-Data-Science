This was so good and so easy to make.  I made a couple changes.  I didn't have any shallots so I cut up some onion and added a little garlic.  I used chicken stock instead of fish stock.  Fish stock sounded nasty and I've never even seen it sold before.  I used salmon filets that I did not cut up.  I'm not sure why some people commented it didn't look very nice.  We thought it looked fine and tasted even better!

This was fabulous! It was so good that I made it Friday night for a small  dinner party and again on Sunday for Grandparents Day. All guests just about licked their plates!  The only changes I made was using chicken stock, skinning the salmon, and cutting it into individual portions rather than cutting it into chunks.  I also toasted some pine nuts and sprinkled on the finished dish.

This was delicious!  I also used chicken broth instead of fish stock and added 3 cloves of chopped garlic to saute with the shallot.  Served with the asparagus with gorgonzola from this site by Jen and steamed squash.  We enjoyed this recipe completely and will be making it again!

Great rice, good salmon. I followed the recipe closely, except for adding a little extra pesto and using chicken stock in place of fish stock as that's what I had. I was worried the rice would be total mush, and it was very soft, but I can't say it was bad - it reminded me of risotto and the flavor was phenomenal, I was suprised that such simple ingredients would produce such great taste. The salmon didn't have nearly as much flavor from the pesto as I thought it would - it basically tasted like... salmon without any added flavors; can't say it's bad, just not what I expected; basically if you have great tasting piece of fish, why mask the taste? Overall, I'll definitely make this again, though I might reduce the liquid by 1/2 of a cup and cooking time by 10 minutes. Also, even though my pesto was salty when I tasted it, the salmon needed more salt, so I'd salt the fish prior to cooking. Overall, definitely a good easy dish to prepare that doesn't require a lot of special ingredients.

I love this method for cooking salmon!  I did feel though that it was lacking a little flavor.  I think the rice is just a bit bland and maybe could use a little something.  I subbed chicken broth for the fish broth and also sprinkled a little parmesan on top when almost finished cooking as another reviewer suggested.  I also recommend skinning the salmon.  It was good but not great.  Maybe next time I'll try rice with a seasoning packet in place of the plain white rice.

This was unbelievably, melt-in-your-mouth, bursting full of flavor delicious! I did vary it up a bit - I added quartered cherry tomatoes, chopped mushrooms, and garlic in with the shallots. Used chicken stock as well. My husband raved about the meal. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

this turned out really well and it was tasty but as some other reviewers mentioned, it was lacking flavour, meaning it did not have any kick or pizzaz to it.  I will definately make this again and add some seasoning to the rice.

wonderful wonderful!  Still good even the next day so that was a nice surprise because usually fish just doesn't reheat well.  I did garlic and shallots and used more pesto than the recipe called for to flavor the rice more.  My husband and his buddy loved it.  Will make it again for sure.

I'm sorry to rate this recipe so low, but it was terribly bland. I followed the recipe, even using fish stock, with the exception of using onion and garlic in placed of shallot, which is similar in flavor. I tried lemon juice, parmesan, cayenne and garlic salt in the end, but this recipe was still not tasty. Perhaps with a chicken bouillon cube added to the rice, it would boost it a bit. However, I likely won't try this recipe again.

Love this recipe! So easy and the salmon was cooked perfectly after 28 minutes. I agree with others to not dice or cube the salmon, just keep them in filets and also substitute the fish stock with chicken broth. Next time, I'd add only 2 c. chicken broth vs. 2 1/2 because there was a lot of liquid for the rice. Also, added a 1 clove of garlic. The rice was delicious and had a perfect amount of wine. To accompany it, I made the broccoli & cashews as a side dish and to also give the plate some color. I got 4 thumbs up from everyone! Will def make this again, especially because it was so easy and great tasting!

This is a tasty but mild recipe.  Very good if planning other activities for the evening. Used brown rice and skinless salmon filets.  Very easy if you don't have to make the pesto.

I loved how easy this was to prepare.  You don't have to sit right next to the stove after the salmon is added.  I did think the pesto was a little strong with the Salmon.

delicious. fast and easy.   As most reviewers, I too modified the recipe a little. Vegetable stock instead of fish stock..( i need a little time to learn to make stocks,and plan menus out ahead instead of buy and try)   Walla Walla sweet onions instead of shallots. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I left the pan somewhat unattended that last 20-25 minutes and ended with scorched bottom. Not a problem, it scraped clean and every morsel was eaten and enjoyed. Definately going into my recipe box. Both my wife and picky eating young adult daughter enjoyed it too.

This recipe is very delicious and also a great way to use up left-over rice - the stock and wine make it perfectly moisty again. I used a can of pink salmon instead of fresh salmon and it was just as delicious! My boyfriend couldn't hold back eating some of the salmon-pesto mix even before the rice was ready! Because I didn't have any fish stock I used chicken broth instead which turned out very tasty. I will definitely make this one again! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My husband and I love pesto, so this was a great recipe.  The pesto got absorbed into the salmon, and it was so delicious! I served it over some rice.  It was superb!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent flavor in my opinion.  I substituted chicken broth for fish broth and white wine.  It was a little on the "wet" side.  Next time I'll use a little less liquid.  We used silver salmon we caught last summer and the entire family really enjoyed it!

Easy! This recipe was very easy...I didn't have white wine so I used extra dry Vermouth. I cut the recipe in 1/2 for two people with left overs. I left my fillet as one big piece and sprinkled Parm over the top before serving. Try it, it's a great weeknight meal.

This was delicious.  Everyone loves it.  I  have made it 5-6 times already.  I cut the wine in half and used scallions instead of shallots.  This is by far the BEST recipe I have used on this site so far. I love many of the recipes but this is Number 1 right now.

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by this. The pesto flavor goes extremely well with the salmon, and I loved that this is a one pot meal. The wine was a bit strong for us, so next time I'll probably just use chicken stock. Or if I can actually find it I'll use fish stock.

I followed the other reviews and substituted fish stock for chicken and added plenty of fresh garlic and was very happy with the outcome.  Made only last week and plan to make again soon.  Very delicious and a nice change from typical grilled salmon. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! My husband and I loved this meal! I didn't cut the fish into chunks, but left them whole on top of the rice, smothered in pesto, and the fish cooked beautifully! This is an easy dish that satifies.

I made this using Basa fillets instead of salmon.  I didn't have shallots so used onion & garlic.  I had fish stock cubes.  I brushed the pesto onto both sides of the fillets with a silicon brush. We all really enjoyed it and my guests raved about it & asked me for the recipe.  It was very easy and I'll make again.  Served with asparagus.

The pic shows tomatoes, so I added them, and did not measure the amount of pesto, just used enough to cover everything. I did not have shallots, so I left that part out.  It was really good, but then I'm used to eating foods that do not have a lot of flavor, so that when I do, I can taste everything.  I'd definitely make this again.  This is a good one.  Btw, I used my cast iron dutch oven.  Not sure if that would make a difference or not.

INCREDIBLE!!!  I used cod (it's all i had in the freezer), and vermouth for the wine (again, it's what i had, but i prefer vermouth to wine when cooking fish anyway).  My rice was brown and took about an hour to cook.  It was SO very very good.  This dish made the house smell wonderful too (BONUS!! :D)

The rice is so good, all infused with the flavor of the wine and the salmon/pesto.  I don't like my food very salty at all, though, so next time I think I will add only 1/4 cup of pesto (or maybe my pesto was saltier than normal?).  Also, I'd keep my salmon fillet in one piece, not cubed.  Other than that, this was super easy and convenient and yummy!

I used low sodium chicken stock instead of fish stock and added grated parmesan to replace some of the salt that was lost. I liked the flavors of the dish but it looked a little bland on the plate.

I thought this recipe was "ok". I would have given it 3 stars if my husband didn't like it so much. The pesto gives it a surprising amount of flavor and it tastes fine made with brown rice. Pretty simple to make. But not an attractive dish you'd serve to dinner guests though!

This is a great recipe, I omitted the wine and used chicken stock instead of fish.  My mistake was to use brown rice, it takes an age to cook but it was worth it in the end.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner and my parents loved it! I cut the fish amount by half and was still very satisfied with how it turned out. I found that the seafood broth gave the rice a good flavor that wasn't as fishy tasting as I'd thought it would be. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This turned out quite good. The Baked pesto flavor was delicious.
