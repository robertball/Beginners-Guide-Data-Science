I'd give this 20 stars if I could! My parents are from Italy and polenta was a staple when we were growing up. Adding chicken broth instead of the traditional water gives it a WONDERFUL flavor. I've also made it using cream instead of milk (yum!), and I've just sprinkled a little cheese on top instead of mixing a whole cup of it in. It's also good with sauteed mushrooms on top. A very good basic recipe -  thanks Jaquita!!!

This is an excellent basic polenta recipe. Polenta has a history aa a staple in the Northern Italian diet - especially in the Asiago area - the home of my maternal grandparents. The terms "polentone" - meaning "full of polenta" and "mangiapolenta" meaning "eat polenta" are used by Southern Italians in reference to those of Northern Italy. The following recipe modifications will bring polenta to an even more elevated level: Bring 4 cups of milk with 0.5 cup of whipping cream to a boil without scalding. Reduce the mixture to a simmer. Slowly add 1 cup of  Quaker cornmeal. With a wooden spoon, stir the mixture.In the old days, the stirring was alloted to the man of the house - the thickening cornmeal can become quite resistant to stirring. Lumps will have a tendency to form. I have found that an electric hand blender will obviate these problems and will result in a smooth, lumpless (homogeneous), creamy polenta. I continue the process for 30 to 45 minutes. I then add 4 TBS of butter to the hot polenta and continue with the blender for another 5 minutes. I then add 0.5 cup of grated pecorino romano cheese. I continue with the blender for another 5 minutes. The finished polenta is then poured onto a large buttered platter. After the polenta has hardened, it is cut - like a pie -  into sections and served with a variety of toppings. Left-over polenta can be served for breakfast: powder the slices with flour, fry in butter, and serve with maple syrup.

Great recipe, and EASY! I used homemade chicken stock, and fresh parmesan cheese, and the flavour was outstanding. To modify for regular polenta, omit the tomato sauce and chill after baking to set.

Fantastic! Ibaked it in tartlet molds and popped them out of the molds after baking so it had nice fluted edges.

Wow!  This was very good and very easy to make. My entire family loved it.  I used skim milk and low-sodium chicken broth.  I poured some of the hot polenta onto a plate to eat right away and baked the rest.  It was great the next day too, heated in the microwave.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved the taste and how quick and easy this was.  The polenta had a cream of wheat-type texture when I poured it into the pan.  It was a little runny when I first took it out of the oven but if you let it sit several minutes before cutting, it thickens up.

P.S.  Muir Glen's Fire Roasted Tomato pasta sauce is our family's favorite. I highly recommend it if you don't have time to make your own.  Actually, it's better than my own.

UPDATE:  The second time I made this I decreased the milk and stock by 1/2 cup each.  This turned out much better.  The polenta was firm and could be cut into pieces (the longer it sits outside the oven, the firmer it gets).  The parmesan flavor stood out a tad more too.  I just can't get enough of this....YUM!  The leftovers are just as good if not better.

Loved this! Used heavy cream instead of milk and jazzed up the spaghetti sauce with some fresh garlic and chopped fresh basil.

I've eaten polenta since I was a little girl and it was always just cornmeal cooked in water with maybe a little salt.  This recipe intrigued me so I gave it a shot.  I used 1 cup cream as I had it on hand and needed to use it up and didn't have milk.  I used 3 C. chicken broth and only 1/2 C. shredded Asiago cheese.  It was so yummy I wanted to eat it just like that and I don't usually like polenta plain.  I didn't bake it because my grandmother who came from Italy (never did learn to speak English) would make polenta, pour it onto a dinner plate and smooth it out, make a little ridge around it like a pizza crush might have, and spread homemade spaghetti sauce in the middle up to the ridge with a sprinkling of Parmesan Cheese and serve it with lots of Italian Sausage cut into 2" lenghts cooked in the sauce.  Heaven.  This polenta would be great with just about anything over it - I plan to try roasted veggies with it.  Thanks - this recipe is a keeper!

GREAT polenta!  I used the sauce recipe from "Swordfish a la Siciliana" from this site to put over panfried sturgeon as well as the polenta.  It's always an interesting evening meal when DH visits our favorite fishmonger!  I skipped the baking step of this recipe and just served the polenta soft.  This is a very easy recipe in that it thickens up nicely and has great flavor without an hour's worth of stirring!  mmmmm.... comfort food!  Thanks for a great recipe!

First off, this came out AMAZING!  I followed the directions in making the polenta.  After I baked it, I left it in the fridge overnight to cool.  The next day, I heated up some Olive Oil in a heavy bottomed skillet.  I fried the Polenta, and browned all sides. (This polenta fries wonderfully!)  Topped with my own sauce, and handmade garlic bread.  OmNomNoms!  My family gobbled it up.  What a great dish!

Added 1 C. shredded cheddar cheese instead of Parm. Will use less tomato sauce next time. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow night. Hope it will be less runny.

Good recipe, easy to follow. I added minced garlic during the boiling stage. Used real grated parm. I baked in a loaf pan without the sauce and served with a baked chicken breast that had tomato sauce which we used over the polenta at serving time. 
Will try again, might try grilling or frying the slices next time. This had more of a bread texture, but it was good!

I had never made polenta before, but this was an easy and very tasty dish.  I stirred some Italian seasoning and garlic powder into the polenta with the Parmesan, along with salt and pepper.  It set up well and tasted good with a jarred sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese.  Thanks!

This has become one of our "go-to" recipes for a quick dinner.  We make it with plain rice milk, vegetable stock, and skip the Parmesan cheese to make it dairy free.  Served with steamed green beans and a tossed salad on the side, it's the perfect weeknight dinner.  My children and husband request this meal often.  :-)

Yummm! So easy, soo good. 

My only changes: I replaced 1/2 of the milk w/ half & half, added some fresh basil to my spaghetti sauce, and sprinkled a little mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce at the end. 

On the other hand, this was so delicious, it would have still been amazing w/out anything added. You could even use less parmesan cheese and it would still be great. 

Next time I'll add some sauteed mushrooms and spinach to the sauce. Thanks for a great, easy recipe! :)

This was my first time having polenta and I was very impressed. Here are a few modifications I made: added garlic powder & some white pepper to the polenta as it cooked. I also ended up baking it for more like 25mins for a firmer texture. I will be making this again!

Very good with home made spaghetti sauce.  It took longer to bake than suggested, but my sauce was in the fridge from the night before.

Tasted Great!!  I added pepperoni to the Sauce to make it more of a lunch type meal.  Also baked it about 20 minutes, took awhile to get the sauce bubbly.

Made this for the first time today (a lot of Polenta for one person) it turned out perfect. Could eat it the way it is, as it was thick enough when it came out of the oven but I will have a lot of it to reheat . I did make a couple of changes because I didn't think it would be too tasty as. I chopped VERY finely 3 garlic cloves,and added about 2 tsp. of a dry seasoning I brought back from Italy called spaghettata.(If you ever see this in your country grab a bag. Oh my  did that ever improve the flavour. Can't wait to share it with my Italian neighbour. Didn't use the tomato sauce (I only want that on spaghetti) If anything I'd use a mushroom sauce or Celery sauce?  I will use "this"  batch of polenta with lamb stew over it.
Thanks for sharing.

Well, this is very easy.  I never buy polenta (I really haven't ever seen it in a grocery store) so I make my own using grown cornmeal. It works out but it's probably better with polenta.  Anyway, I did put this under the broiler when I was almost done baking it.  I lost track of time and left it in a couple of minutes too long and singed the cheese.  Not the recipes falt, totally my error.  Anyway, the taste was still good and it is something that I will probably play around with in the future.

I made this with "World's Best Pasta Sauce!" I layered this like lasagna: polenta, mozzarella, sauce, polenta, mozzarella, sauce, and topped it off with a final layer of polenta. I cooked it the next night for about 30 minutes (uncovered) since it had been in the fridge. It was very good!

I made this for my roommates and they loved it!  I used skim milk, reduced-sodium chicken broth, and only 1/3 cup of cheese or so, and it was still delicious!  The tomato sauce on top also gave it great flavor (I used Classico Tomato & Basil).

Well this got mixed reviews at my house but keep in mind none of us had ever tried polenta before.  My daughter and I ate the leftovers the following day which in our opinion were better than the night before, definitely more firm.  I'm sure we'll be making this again when we want something a little different from the ordinary as a side dish.  Thanks for sharing it.

This is a delicious, easy side or main dish! The broth and milk make it extra creamy without making it too rich.   Tastes just like Grandma Mauro's polenta!  YUM!

I had never made polenta before and I don't believe mine turned out the way it should have.  It seems in the photo, Jacquita cut hers into slices.  Mine was runny like ricotta.  I gave it four stars because it tasted ok.  I added parmesan and fresh basil on top.

Very tasty polenta. I didn't have yellow corn flour so I used white and it turned out well. I used vegetable broth so that all members of the family could enjoy it. I thought that the spaghetti sauce was too much and overpowering the amount of polenta. i might try to make a fresh tomato sauce for this next time. Thanks for this recipe.

Love this recipe!  I make the polenta in ths stove, and then divide into 5 or 6 small plastic take along containers.  I pour tomato sauce and sprinkle cheese on each one- then stick in the fridge.

We take them to work and re-heat in the microwave.  They keep well (freeze even) and the cheese melts and tomato sauce cooks in the microwave. 

Great time saver!

A TBS or two of pesto stirred into the polenta is also delicious, and you can get by with less cheese for lower calories!

The recipe looked delicious, but I always have to put my own twist to it and make it a casserole. I wanted it vegetarian, so instead of chicken stock I used enchilada sauce with more milk to make up the difference. Then instead of 
spaghetti sauce I used two cans of black bean juice with salsa and lime juice. After it cooks,then mixed in the cans of black beans and some queso cheese. Topped with sharp cheddar. When done add sour cream on top with homemade salsa. Yum! :) Thanks for the beginnings of my great concoction!

Great recipe. I cooked the polenta in some chicken broth, and topped the whole thing with oven roasted veggies (Zucchini, eggplant and peppers) and it was absolutely delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this polenta ahead of time and let it set up in the fridge. Then cut into single servings, topped with leftover sauce and baked in pretty little dishes. Really nice, rich and creamy polenta. My family had nerver had it before and they loved it. No need to try another recipe, I'll just doctor this basic one to fit any need.

I hate when people do this, but well... here's my super simple version. Premade Polenta from refridgerated section slice and bake 350 for 15min. In skillet: 1 can petite diced tomatoes with sweet onion and 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1 TBSP of sugar, 1 tsp Kosher salt, reduce and spoon over polenta.

This recipe is so delicious and extremely easy.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Polenta is a very budget friendly meal to make.  I added grilled zucchini and red peppers to the top once it came out and it was great.  Great recipe once again Jacquita!

Delicious, and very easy to make. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, as I am vegetarian, and it turned out fantastic. I halved the recipe and put it in a loaf pan, as I am the only polenta lover in our family, and this was great, as the leftover can be reheated in the microwave for a quick meal. Thanks very much for the great recipe!

This was fantastic.  I switched out the Parmesan for Pepper Jack cheese, and covered the polenta with a black bean salsa to bake.  I served it with Cuban pork, and we LOVED it!!

the polenta came out very nice, however the  tomato sauce seemed a bit acidic to the delicate flavor of the polenta. I think next time I will omit the sauce and serve plain.

This was SO good.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and for the Parmesan cheese I grated the good stuff myself and I think it made a difference.  The sauce you use on top really impacts the flavor, so choose or make a good one.  I will definitely be making this again!

I didn't make the entire recipe; I only used the polenta recipe itself. It's a great recipe. I think next time I'll cut down on the parmesan cheese because it was pretty strong. I served this with pollo guisado instead of rice and it was a big hit.

Made it with soymilk, turned out great.  I also added onions and fresh rosemary before cooling.

I was told that one of the diners had given up on polenta after her first time tasting it, but was entirely convinced to give it another chance.

Made this tonight & my husband who is usually a very picky eater loved it! I added a pound of cooked ground beef and 1 diced cooked onion with a dash of garlic to the jarred spaghetti sauce to spice it up. The polenta was rich, creamy and tasty! Loved it!

I have been making this for years now, thank you Jaquita!  We never had it before your recipe, now it is a standard carb on our plates.  Most recently we have had it with venison osso bucco and both are tremendous together! I first made it to go with chicken saltimbocca.

it was good, we served this three times in our cafeteria at the high school, it was well received, we modified the recipe because we found that there were a lot of comments on the saltiness the first time around.  but otherwise it was amazing.

I cut the recipe in half ( 1 c milk, 1c chicken broth etc) and it turned out great. I put it in a Pyrex pie dish and baked it without the sauce as I'm serving it in a different way. Couldn't have been easier!

Delicious!  Very easy to make, and this was actually my first time making polenta.  I probably could have cooked it longer on the stove top, but despite it being just a little "runny" it was delicious.  I added two chopped green onions while cooking the corn meal on the stove and a little salt and pepper.  Should have cut the recipe in half for the two of us, but we'll enjoy it again today.  This is a repeat for us.  Thanks!

This may have been the easiest, hassle-free dinner I've thrown together. Not only that, but it delivered exactly what I was hoping for taste and texture-wise. Following the advice of another reviewer, I only used 3 cups of liquid total (1 1/2 c chicken broth and 1 1/2 c of a combo of heavy cream and 2% milk). Before the broth/milk mixture came to a rolling boil, I whisked in some spices to taste:  black pepper, a little onion & garlic powders, a dash of nutmeg, and some dried basil. With the addition of the 1 c parmesan cheese, the polenta was already thick, and honestly, I could've dug in at that moment. However, I poured the polenta into an 8x8" square glass baking dish, topped with an eyeballed amount of a hearty basil marinara sauce, then sprinkled some extra parmesan cheese and the remainder of a bag of an Italian blend shredded cheese I wanted to to use up, as well as a final sprinkling of basil. Baked for 12 minutes, and let it sit out for  5 minutes after removing it from the oven....perfect firm, yet creamy texture and taste! Served with a simple green tossed salad, this will be a regular in our Meatless Monday rotation for sure! Even paired with some Italian sausage and peppers, this polenta would be an excellent side dish as well. Bravo!

This was really good - I've never made polenta before and it was a nice change from pasta.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that mine came out really runny.  Maybe I did something wrong.  Otherwise, the taste more than made up for the messy presentation.  Thank you!

I'm vegan so I made this with soy milk and vegetable stock but made the polenta and put it in a baking dish and cooled it and then cut the polenta into triangle slices and alined three slices and then poured the tomato sauce over and sprinkled soy cheese over the top made a delicious polenta dish :)

We used 1.5 cups of milk and chicken stock, and let it sit for a few minutes after baking, and it was nice and thick.  Also from previous reviews, added a clove of minced garlic to the spaghetti sauce, which added a nice kick.

This is my first time having polenta - I am still trying to decide if I like this or not... the taste isn't bad, but I might have some issues with the texture. Update: This is definitely better the next day - the texture is better too!

Too much sauce. If I made it again, I would use about 1/2 cup to 1 cup of sauce. It was overpowering.

Delicious!  I didn't actually follow this recipe, but used it as a template for my own.  I'm allergic to dairy so I made a simple polenta with water, salt, and cornmeal in my crockpot.  Then I poured it into a baking dish and topped it with some homemade meat sauce that was leftover from a lasagna.  I baked it until bubbly and it was dee-licious!  I served this alongside pan-seared chicken breasts and broccoli.

Delicious! Soooooo easy!! I used 1.5 cups of each liquid, which gave a firmer texture. Served with chicken and sauted onions, but for me, I prefer minus the meat. Topped with Famiglia del Grosso sauce ... THE BEST!

This is not true polenta, but only a tasty corn mush. True polenta is much more work to get right. True polenta is extended cooking until the corn starch becomes geletanized. Calling this polenta is a disservice.

This is amazingly flavorful, yet easy and quick.  The chicken broth and milk definitely make the dish.   I made my own sauce with a little italian sausage, and that went well with the flavor in the polenta.    I was amazed at the liquid to cornmeal ratio, thinking it would come out runny.  But I trusted the reicpe and the dish came out perfect.  Thank you for such a wonderful main dish for the 'gluten-challenged'.

I made the polenta as directed, but I also bake Italian sausage. After the polenta was baked, I put my homemade sauce over it then sliced my meat and put atop. BEAUTIFUL!!!!

Mine came out perfect.It firmed up a bit more overnight (leftovers). Only thing that could make it better for me would be some cheese in the middle. Will add to regular rotation. Thanks.

Very easy and excellent recipe.  Followed direction exactly, but may not have cooked it enough.  I'll need to experiment but my oven needed another 5 to completely firm the polenta.  Really enjoyed it and can see this becoming a staple in our house. My only addition was a little black pepper to the polenta itself.

I am making this recipe tonight for the second time. I made no changes...used freshly grated Parmesan, 2% milk, and lite Ragu tomato/basil sauce. When it came out of the oven, it was almost the consistency of grits...a tad thicker. The flavor was so good, and the texture creamy. It firmed as it cooled, and I ate it for leftovers right from the frig and it was wonderful. I used local organic, stone ground, yellow corn meal. This is going to be a staple from now on!

OMG! This is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten,and definitely a easy quick meal to make. The total time was about an hour including making my sauce from scratch.  The only change I made(due to being short on parm cheese) was add about a 1/4 of shredded mexican cheese, and about a tsp of garlic powder.  Other than that, left everything the same.  Thank you for sharing your amazing recipe!

This is great.  I needed a plain polenta to use with another recipe, so I omitted the spaghetti sauce.  The flavor is wonderful, this will be my standard polenta from now on!  I'll plan on making it a day ahead and refrigerating so I can cut firm slices in the future.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. We had never tried poltenta and my son was skeptical, but we all ended up liking it. I served it with the Italian spaghetti sauce with meatballs (submitted by Jeremy) and it was the perfect side dish.

I really liked this, but it's getting 4 stars because my husband tried it, then made the "yuck" face, and choked down one bite...  then didn't eat any more.  I might make it again if I am cooking for other people besides just us, but this will not be a regular dish in our house.

I didnt exactly use this recipe, so it is not fair for me to rate it anything other than a 5. I made polenta from a different recipe, then i found this one, so i added the tomato sauce on top and baked the polenta. The only problem i had was that i think another type of cheese would have made it more savory. (maybe half parmesan, half cheddar or another cheese). If i make this again, i will try it with other cheeses. That aside, the simple addition of tomato sauce is a great idea! gave alot of flavor to the polenta. Thanks for the recipe!

I never tried polenta before so I can't really compare it to anything. That being said, I thought it was quite good. I used this recipe for the polenta but omitted the parmesan and put the polenta in the fridge to set. I then used the polenta for the recipe "Polenta with Roasted Vegetables." Worked quite well!

This was quite good!  It makes some really creamy polenta, and I used meat spagetti sauce on top.  Very yummy!  It makes quite a lot too.

Enjoyed this recipe very much, even though I forgot to stir the parmesan into the polenta! I sprinkled it on the top instead. Oh well. I used a vegie parmesan topping and skim milk. Very yummy and a delightful change-of-pace entree. Thanks so much for sharing it Jacquita!

All I can say is delicious! I wouldn't change anything to this recipe. Made as is, with the exception of my parm. cheese had some herbs in it (what I had on hand). Otherwise, I used the same ingredients and technique. From what I have read, the longer you let it sit after baking, it will firm up. Also, I think most polenta recipes use water/salt instead of chicken broth. But, hey this recipe tasted great! Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe so much!!!! I added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to it at the boiling stage and baked for 25 minutes. It's so easy and tasty. We always eat it with pineapple chicken sausage.

loved it, made as directed but didn't put the sauce on top, also only had a 6X8 pan so I let it cooked longer to firm it up.

covered it with a meat/pork rage I made yesterday and some extra parm.  was great!

must say I am intrigued by people that used heavy cream, may try that next time

I made this and it was fantastic!! It was my first time making polenta and I didn't know if I would like it very much. I followed the recipe exactly and used my own homemade sauce to top it off. Tasty!

this was easy & delicious! I just sprinkled some cheese on top of the polenta before baking, then put it in the fridge to cool & set.  Put chicken cacciatore on top, delicious!

So EASY and so GOOD!  I serve this (without tomato sauce) with Braised Beef Short Ribs or Braised Lambshanks.  The gravy from the meat is perfect over the polenta and they go together so well.

A truly outstanding base recipe.  Used 1 cup half and half, 3 cups stock, and added a tablespoon of butter.  Stirred in the cheese at the end.  I didn't bake this--left off the sauce and just served with a spoon out of the pot once it was cooked.  Great with caramelized onions and Italian sausage on top!

The base of this - the polenta - was great. I cut the cheese by almost half and it was still really cheesy and creamy, but you should really use a homemade sauce for the top. The canned stuff tastes like it came from a can on top of this. At the very least, stir canned sauce into some sauteed onion and add some herbs first. I added some grated parmesan to the top to make it look nicer.

Delicious!  Added 1 pat of butter, 3 cloves of garlic, and some pepper.  Baked it without the sauce and served it with lamb chops.  My husband and I both had second helpings.  Wonderful texture, very easy to make, and a nice change from potatoes.

This is a fantastic basic polenta recipe.  I use vegetable stock to keep it vegetarian, but otherwise do everything else according to the instructions.  I use this recipe everytime I make polenta- it's good as is, or jazzed up with mushrooms and extra cheeses.  Yummy!!

My polenta has never turned out so well! Thank you for a great recipe.  I used home made sauce with eggplant in it, and it was fabulous.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

This was easy to make. I used the Easy Polenta from this site. Put it in the bottom of a 3 qt casserole dish, placed the vegetable mixture, then cheese on the top. I used garlic instead of garlic powder. We all enjoyed it. Will make again.

This was a very easy recipe - I followed it exactly, and it turned out really well!  I am new to polenta (I had only used it to make some little pancake things for my daughter), so I wanted to try something easy with it that would be familiar enough for my slightly picky husband to like :o)  This seemed to fit the bill, and I really liked it.  My husband was so-so as well as my daughter, but I am craving it again!  My polenta did turn out really creamy, like some other people said, not very solid.  We just mixed everything together and ate "polenta spaghetti sauce soup".  The next day, though, I ate leftovers, and the time in the fridge had firmed the remaining polenta a little more.  It tasted great that way, too.  I would suggest anyone to try it!

Great recipe.  WAY better than the logs.  For my version I cooled overnight in the fridge, then cut into squares, placed on an oiled cookie sheet, broiled for about 6-7 minutes on the first side, flipped over and added a dollop of ricotta and a slice of fresh mozz on each, then broiled for another 6-7 minutes until cheese was melty and browned in spots.  Topped with a mushroom ragout and shredded asiago.  AMAZING!

Absolutely incredible.  The only thing that you can do to improve upon this polenta is serve a poached egg over it.  The combination is out of this world.

First time I've made or eaten polenta!  So easy...and yummy!  Served it the first night topped with ossobuco & the leftover plain polenta was pan-fried & served with chicken breasts & tomato sauce a couple of nights later.  Both times the family wolfed it down.  Great recipe - thanks!

I'VE MADE POLENTA THE OLD ITALIAN WAY, STIRRING FOREVER, BUT THIS WAS WONDERFUL, AND MUCH BETTER TASTING WITH THE CHICKEN STOCK (I USED THE NEW SWANSONS STOCK , NOT BROTH, AND MILK.  YOU DO NEED TO STIR THE FULL TIME SO IT ISN'T RUNNY.  AND I ADDED SHREDDED MOZZARELLA ON TOP, BEFORE THE SAUCE.   EASY PEASY AND MY ITALIAN HUBBY LOVED IT. THANKS!

I LOVE this stuff!  I was out of milk so I used a can of evaporated milk and added water to make 2 cups.  I will probably use a little less cheese next time just to cut the fat a little.  I had to come write this just to stop myself from eating it.  My 5 1/2 year old son likes it enough that he will be having it in a thermous for lunch at school tomorrow.  I love leftovers!

Very good but next time I'll cut back on the parmesan. A bit too cheesy for me. Still, I won't have to buy polenta at the grocer anymore.

I had no idea polenta was so easy to make. I'll never buy the prepared polenta again. This was very creamy. I used skim milk and low sodium broth, because that's all I had and it was delicious. I used my own sauce on top.

I made the polenta according to the recipe but I used my own homemade tomato garlic meat sauce.  My husband loved it so much that he said that I can make this dish many times.  The traditional polenta is made with water, but the milk gives it nice creamy texture.  I also added a tablespoon of butter to the polenta when I was stiring it.  This is great reheated the next day in the microwave or in the oven.

This was good.  I was expecting the polenta to be a bit firmer, but the taste was still excellent.  I mixed a can of diced tomatoes with green chillies in with the pasta sauce, so it had a little kick.  Had to boil the polenta longer than 5 minutes...more like 15.

This recipe was great!  Very tasty.  The only thing I did differently is substitute some of the Parmesan cheese with sharp cheddar.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Absolutely delicious.  I did have to stir the polenta longer than 5 minutes to thicken, but the flavor is outstanding.

Thanks for submitting a great recipe!  I've been gently introducing my family to vegetarian cuisine and this dish was perfect.

I love this recipe!  I have made it over and over again.  My roommates can't wait for it to get out of the oven every time I make it.  It's even better the next day when the polent has a chance to firm up.  Just YUM!

This tasted great!  I had my first try of polenta at school and loved it!  This was a good recipe, I'll agree it's a bit runny... but I didn't mind it much.  Taste great with grilled zucchini, squash and bell peppers on the side!
