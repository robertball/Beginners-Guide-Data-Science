After reading the other review, I decided to use boneless skinless chicken. I used fresh thyme and lemon but felt the sauce was too diluded.  I even tried to add a little creme fraiche to give it some extra flavor and body but that didn't help.

This was a good recipe. My only modification is to remove some of the chicken juices throughout the cooking process. Otherwise use just have a boiled chicken. This is true for all crock pot whole chickens.

I was rather disappointed with this -- much too wet and the flavors were diluted.

I added lots of extra veggies to this and served it over rice.  It was awesome for dinner and again for lunch the next day.

There is no way that picture is this recipe! Look at the grill marks on the chicken. It don't come out of the crock pot looking like that

I always use more garlic than any recipe calls for! Use chicken broth for liquid along w/wine. Place some garlic under skin too. Very tasty!

Absolutely delicious! I used a flavoured oil to fry it up before cooking - Herbes de Provence - it was amazing! And I cut the cooking time by about 45 mins. It came out in bits! It was still wonderfully juicy and flavourful, but I had to lift it out of the slow cooker in pieces with a slotted ladle and I couldn't slice it - it fell apart. I'd cook it for no more than 4 hrs next time. Will definitely make it again.

While this did have lots of flavor mine never browned... however I am not sure that is the fault per-say of the recipe or my own as I only had boneless-skinless chicken breast to use... however I did have to cut the cooking time down to just 90 minutes, and add a 1/2 cup of water or there would not have been any moisture left in the chicken at all crock pot went near dry with only 1/2 cup of lemon juice for the 4 large chicken breast, I had check to see how it was doing (without removing lid at first) at half way through cooking timer (45 minutes) when I had to add more liquid, at 90 minutes chicken had internal temp of 165 degrees so was fully cooked, looked like it had been boiled... ended up removing it from crock pot and putting it the broiler for a while to brown....on some per request of person eating it I also add some Parmesan cheese to top of breast.. before placing in broiler. ... browned nicely in about 5-8 minutes.. and service with previously frozen Brussel Sprouts... everyone seemed to enjoy there share... I love the citrus/thyme flavoring... very nice...had mine with out the cheese.... going to try some today for lunch (left over) with the Parmesan that had been added.... gave only 4 start rating because after reading other's review I am almost certain that the use of boneless didn't or would not have effected the coloring of the chicken in the long run.
