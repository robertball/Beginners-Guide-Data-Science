This was one of the best pies I have ever tasted. It was so good, and easy to make, I made two more after the first. The only problem I ran into was that I needed to bump the serving size up to 12 to get real full pies.

Sorry to have to give this such a low rating...It is a GREAT pie but without MOLASSES, it is NOT a SHOO FLY PIE, and I have eaten many versions...I made this recipe and enjoyed it, but then changed the white sugar to Black Strap Molasses and it was fantastic...The cornmeal helps to firm the pie a bit...

I don't know if there was a typed error on this recipe or not, but I followed it exactly and the inside of the pie was liquid. It was a syrup, it tasted good, but a pie is not supposed to be half liquid, it's not a pie then.

Maybe not as good as the one with molasses; but pretty darn good!
Very few ingredients, quick prep, short bake time, and a nice sweet treat.
