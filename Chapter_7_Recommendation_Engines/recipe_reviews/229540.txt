I wasn’t terribly sold on this recipe just as is, but I knew with a bit of tweaking it could work for me.  First, I know I would have loved the pan seared crust on the fish but frankly, I was too lazy to take that extra step, I didn’t want the grease spatter on my cook top, and frankly, I didn’t want the fried fish smell in the kitchen!  Second, I Iiked the idea of the Dijon mustard, but not on its own.  I knew I liked fish baked with a slather of mayonnaise, so I made a mixture of mayonnaise, an all-purpose seasoning mix for fish and chicken, and the mustard.  That proved to be delicious by the way!  Finally, I expected this would need some color, so I gave the filets a good sprinkle of paprika before popping them into the oven for about 15 minutes. We really enjoyed it, and what I appreciated the most about it was that the mayo/Dijon topping was subtle but still added a certain “something” to the dish.

I hate it when people review a recipe without following it to the letter first, and yet this is what I am doing. I admit it, I cheated...so here it goes...based on reviews I tweaked it. I don't feel too bad about his as it was submitted by a company and not a "real person" I Seasoned the fish with a generic seasoning for pork or fish. Was going to use Lemon pepper but found out too late I was out! Perhaps this was a blessing in disguise? Mixed up some mayo with the country style Dijon Mustard and baked it without searing it first. Yes, I put dried parsley on the top. My only side was an Asparagus Cashew Rice Pilaf also from this site. The results were a 5* restaurant quality meal. No need for any tarter sauce or lemon juice or anything else. It stands on its own. I have made several fish dishes from this site but THIS ONE...OMG!! Easy to make, easy to bake, did not require any special ingredients that are not normally in the pantry or fridge. I can't stop raving about how good this was. Needless to say I will make this again. It just pushed my favorite standby fish recipe which I have been using for the past couple of years to the wayside!!

Really good.  Seasoned the fish with a lemon pepper seasoning blend before putting in the pan to brown.  The fish wanted to stick, even in a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet and didn't really 'brown', however, when the pieces looked partially cooked on the bottom, we spread them with the mustard, sprinkled on some dried parsley and put them in the oven.  Great flavor, with a little crispiness on the bottom.  Would definitely make again.

Really easy and such a great result, do not overdo the dijon, lovely with scalloped potatoes, mashed or even rice. Try it you are sure to make this more than once..just do not tell guests how easy it is. Btw I just seasoned, added the mustard then baked for eight mins at 400. Add just a little maple syrup which moves it over the top.

Fast and easy to prepare; absolutely delicious (not having to flip the cod in the sautee pan is a BIG plus).

This is a fantastic recipe!  I used a different mustard because I couldn't find the brand listed but it turned out great!  The fish was so moist and full of flavor...the mustard topping made it tangy and flavorful.  Thanks for sharing!

So easy! I'd never heard of this brand of mustard but I bought some and now use it on everything. Made this with swai since that's what I had, and oven-baked. Terrific!

This was just ok for my taste buds. It was very tender and moist, but I guess I wasn't too crazy about the mustard taste.

I was intrigued by this so I decided to give it a try.  I skipped the fry part, just seasoned my fillets, added the mustard (I did use a champagne Dijon since I wasn't able to find the brand) and baked @ 350F for  about 18 minutes.  It far outweighed my expectations.

In lieu of the mustard requested, I used the recipe for spicy Chinese restaurant mustard (1/4 cup ground mustard + 3 tbsp of cold water) and added 1 tbsp of honey to mellow it out. It was AWESOME,

This was really good.  I seasoned the fish with Old Bay and mixed 2 tsp Dijon with 2 tsp mayo.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  Hubby really liked it and he is not a fish lover. I will definitely make this again.

I tried to follow and use the majority of reviews as a guide. I used rather thick pieces, which I do recommend.  I do not own a 'suitable for oven' pan, so I did 'sear' the bottom in a skillet...but, having never done this before, it didn't crisp much at all and I was left with a splattery mess on my stainless.  Don't do this. Don't sear unless you totally know what you are doing.  I did put it in a 380 oven for 30 mins. (20 mins covered, 10 un.)  I would recommend 20 mins covered only.  I also used recommendation and sprinkled with Old Bay and salt and pepper...too much.  Nix Old Bay. Perhaps pepper, but salt wasn't necessary (and we like salt.)  Then I put on a good helping of Dijon. Then I poured about 1/4-1/2 cup of white wine in dish, so as to wet the bottom, then covered and baked 380 for 20. (let sit covered for a few) I did whip up a sauce of Dijon, drippings and cream cheese melted in saucepan.  That was fine with it, but you can try a different recipe for Dijon sauce. We'll do it again.

Delicious! Simple to make. The mustard added flavor to an otherwise mild tasting fish. I added a few capers before putting it in the oven.
