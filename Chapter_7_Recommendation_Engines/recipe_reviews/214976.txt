Perfect recipe! We loved this...I made them into bacon cheeseburgers and had to make a judgement call and use gorgonzola rather than roquefort because that's all I could find. We'll make these from now on...absolutely delicious and 5 forks up from all around my picnic table! Thanks for a superb recipe!

these turned out well for us.  only downside is stuffed burgers tend to make larger portions.
