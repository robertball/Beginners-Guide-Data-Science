I rated this 4 stars because I couldn't make the actual recipe - my local grocery store did not sell the puff pastry! GREAT LOOKING DESSERT!  Here are the changes I made . . . 1. I used phyllo dough (mini shells) for the crusts. They were already cooked so all I had to do was let them thaw - which only takes 10 minutes. I did, however, opt to crisp them in the oven following the package instructions. 2. You probably need to make twice the amount of filling, even if using the puff pastry!  I did and it filled 15 mini phyllo shells with about 1/2 c left over.  3. I piped the filling into the shells - this is way better than using a spoon! 4. Decorated with fruit and drizzled with chocolate. Yum!!!

The 3 grocery stores around me didn't have mini puff cups so I used phylo cups like other reviewers suggested. I piped my cream cheese mixture into the cups, and instead of of topping with fruit, I drizzled a raspberry glaze on it. Puree a 10oz bag of frozen raspberries that has been thawed. Run the puree through a strainer to get all the seeds out. Mix in 2 tbsp white sugar, and 2 tbsp orange liqueur (I used cointreau). I placed the creamcheese cups on a white serving dish and drizzled the red raspberry puree on the entire thing. Leave it in the fridge for an hour or two and let all the smells and flavors come together. I tried it after I first drizzled and it tasted sooo bland. But after an hour it was such a rich, cream cheesy, raspberry-y flavor. Everyone at the party LOVED them, they disappeared in Â½ hr. Great recipe idea!

As per Jessica's recommendation, I used phyllo dough minishells, crisped in the oven and then cooled.  They present SO beautifully -- people went crazy for them.  Actually, people are more likely to enjoy one (or more :) ) mini bites where they would say 'no, I shouldn't' to a slice of a big hummer cheesecake.  Fantastic!!  Thanks for a big keeper.

Made these for my daughter's bridal shower.  What a hit. I used the mini phyllo dough shells (ready to go right out of the freezer).  I put the cheesecake mixture into a sandwich bag and clipped one corner off and piped it into the shells.  Then I put a single fresh raspberry and then melted dark chocolate in a sandwich bag, cut a very small tip off one corner and drizzled the chocolate over.  Very easy, very elegant.  A keeper for sure.  Thanks for sharing.  The sandwich bag trick is a BIG mess and time saver.

These tasty treats were simple and delicious. You can use either Mini Puff Pastry Shells or Phyllo Cups.

This was so easy and so tasty.  I used the phylo cups to.  Took them for a wedding reception and they were gone in minutes.  Was a great red, white and blue celebrations with a small slice of strawberry and a blueberry drizzled with chocolate! Jan :)

I made these for a holiday party and everyone loved them! They were really yummy topped with fresh blackberiies. I did have to double the filling recipe though, because the first batch wasn't enough to fill all of the shells. This is a keeper for sure!

Made these for my husbands birthday today, cheesecake is his favorite but trying to cut down a little on calories so thought these might satisfy without breaking the bank, so to speak. Since these are small, once they're gone, they're gone. I used 8 oz. low fat cream cheese and 1/2 cup of low fat Cool Whip and also doubled other ingredients. I also added about a tablespoon of orange liqueur  per another review...came out great, husband loves...I posted a pic, used the phyllo mini shells since I had on hand. I did taste the filling before adding the liqueur and was maybe just a little bland, and maybe that was because of the low fat ingredients, but that's why the 4 stars...will make again.

Okay...WOW!  These were great.  Like other reviewers, I used Phillo shells...very easy.  Pop in the overn for 5 min to crisp, then fill and refridgerate.  I diced strawberried and blackberries and topped each filling with each then drizzled with melted choc chips (melted in micro)...ridiculously fantastic.  Used 2 boxs of the shells and doubled the recipe filling and it was the perfect amount...making again this week, cuz they went FAST and very easy to make  :)

I did use the mini puff pastry shells and I thought it was pretty good. Drizzling chocolate on top is a good idea. I topped them with strawberries, or blackberries, or raspberries.

I really enjoyed these and have made them twice.  I always finish it with a white/dark chocolate drizzle.  This is a recipe to try and can be tweeked to fit anyone's taste.

YUM! I give these a 4 stars because I haven't yet used the Pepperidge Farm brand pastry shells yet, I used Tenderflake brand and they worked well too. I would personally double this recipe because it produces very little. I added a dash of extra confectioners sugar and found it was the perfect balance of the sour cream cheese and sweet fruits. I used canned peaches as a topping since they came with a little bit of syrup on their own. Great!! Would definitely recommend this recipe.

Made for a baby shower. I couldn't find the mini shells so I used the regular size. They were delicious and gone in minutes!

I gave this 3 stars because it's impossible to yield 24 servings with the quantitiesnstated. I doubled the recipe, put less than 2 tablespoons in each phyllo cup, and still didn't get 24. ...plus I had a very hard time finding these phyllo cups!

I made these exactly as written except used mini phyllo cups.  I did have to double the recipe to fill about 25 cups.  Drizzled them in melted chocolate.  They were a little bland.  If I ever make them again, I'll use plain sugar instead of confectioners sugar, to give it that more crystalized, sugary texture.  And maybe a topping other than chocolate would give it more flavor, or adding something to the mix.  For Christmas I can see these being great with some peppermint extract and crushed peppermints on top, for example.  Another reviewer suggested Amaretto and a bit more Cool Whip, that sounds amazing!

I think for how easy they are and how nice they look, they're great for an impressive and quick dessert.  Flavor-wise, though, it's just a very basic, bland cheesecake.  Use this as a base recipe to create something fantastic.

I just took this to a cookie swap and everyone loved it! It was so easy to make as well. I bought the mini pastry shells in the frozen  section of the grocers. Thanks for sharing
