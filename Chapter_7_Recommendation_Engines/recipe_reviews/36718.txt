This is a variation of a recipe I've used for years and it is a BIG hit. It works for fast weekday meals but can be "gussied" up for guests. I use sherry instead of vermouth and sometimes add chicken broth to get more sauce and then add a little diluted flour& water to make it a more gravy like sauce (the sauce is really incredible). I serve with rice pilaf and maybe steamed asparagas.

GSIACOBONE - You could try using chicken broth or white wine in place of the vermouth.  In most recipes, lemon juice, white wine and capers seem to compliment each other (in my opinion).  Let us know how it turns out.  Best of luck! Josie

to me, the original recipe was way too tart and had too little sauce.  We really enjoyed this recipe with the following changes: pounded chicken breasts thin, cooked 4 min on each side, replaced vermouth with 3/4 cup dry, white wine, 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, 3 teaspoons capers, no parsley, 1 can quartered artichoke hearts, drained, 1 cup chicken broth thickened with 1 tlbsp (or so) cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup water.

I made this for company and at the last minute I decided I needed more sauce, so I added a cup or so of half and half cream, brought it to a boil and let it thicken naturally.  It was delicious and I got rave reviews.  Of course it was more fattening than the regular way, so I will do it this way only for special occasions.  Good recipe.

This is my favorite chicken recipe.  If you like lemon and the sour taste of capers, then this is the recipe for you.  I like to add button mushrooms as well.

Delicious!  I only cooked 2 chicken breasts but used the same amount of ingredients as listed for the sauce.  I also added some flour and a little bit of milk to the sauce, and cooked the chicken in it for a few minutes.  It was so good, my boyfried actually picked up the plate and started licking the rest of the sauce off of it.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe, and it was really easy to make (and healthy too!).  I followed the recipe, except for cutting the chicken into bite-sized pieces.  I have a 2-month old daughter and finally found a delicious recipe which I could have ready from start-to-finish without her waking up!  We will definitely be having this on a regular basis, thanks!

Great Great Great!  Very Tangy which I love - I customized by adding 1 whole tomato to the pan when I added the chicken which becomes like a fresh tomato sauce with the capers - YUM!  I have already made 3 times and still craving more!

This was good with a few adjustments that others did.  I doubled the sauce and thickened it with flour and water and also added a little butter which made it more like a picata sauce.  Next time I'll reduce the amount of lemon.  Overall, very good.

I and my husband thought this was a wonderful meal! We ate it on top of angelhair pasta, making it an east to make, and filling dish. My only suggestion is to double the sauce at the end. It tasted good, but we both wanted a bit more sauce.

Way too lemony for me, and I am a lemon lover.  My husband did like this, however, so I will probably attempt this again, cutting the lemon by at least half.  I did like the freshness of the sauce and think if I tweak this a bit I could really love it.  I may use a little cornstarch to thicken just a bit and will possibly use a little chicken stock next time.  Thanks!

This was outstanding!  We didn't have any dry vermouth so we used the sweet vermouth we had.  Also, if serving over pasta, definitely double the sauce.
VERY quick and easy to make, and DEE-LISH!
Presents very well too (company was impressed).

I made this for dinner last night, we are only two so I had to tweak the recipe a little.  It was quite tasty, but I found the sauce very thin.  Perhaps a little cornstarch next time would help.  But very fast weeknight supper, always a plus!

Zesty = Lemons.  I added a little more lemon and dry vermot and the sauce seems to be dominated by lemon.  I think I may have messed up the sauce.  Tasted fine in the end.

I took the advice of some other reviewers and doubled the sauce, added a little chicken broth to tone down the lemon flavor, and 1 Tbsp cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. Turned out pretty good overall, even my picky husband ate it.

This is a great recipe.  I agree that the sauce is very zesty and may be too much for some, but we love it.  I like to pound down the chicken a bit for a uniform thickness, plus it looks like more on the plate when you're trying to cut calories.  I serve this with couscous and steamed brocolli.  Will make many more times!

This dish had a very shocking flavor. Way too much lemon juice. If I make this again I will cut the lemon juice down to 1 tblspn.

I have yet to try this recipe, but was wondering what could be used in place of vermouth since I don't have it handy and don't feel like buying a whole bottle for one recipe. thanks!!!

My Girlfriend and I liked this recipe.  Super quick and Super easy.

Didn't have vermouth , but cooking sherry seemed just fine.

My mom used to make a version of this recipe with chicken stock instead of lemon and I think I like this version with lemon better.  Chicken stock was always too salty.

BEWARE...if you dont really like lemon or tanginess....dont make this recipe!! (or maybe cut down the lemon juice???) I thought it was pretty tastey though. I will definitely make it again, merely for the fact that I love capers.  Well, and because this recipe is somewhat lowfat, flavorful, and easy to make.

Very fast, very easy and very, very tasty.  Pair with broccoli and an acorn squash with a little brown sugar and butter melted in the middle.  I got raves from my dear husband, who usually does the cooking.

I used frozen breaded chichen cutlets that were on hand. Thawed and added the mixed seasoning to them (kept the leftover for next time),no vermoth..hence used dry sherry.  Followed the recipe otherwise,  I loved it but my husband said to cut the lemon at least by half next time, maybe only use 1/4 for him. With this adjustment he gives it a 5 star and that really something from him.  Thanks so mush for this recipe!

I liked this, my husband loved it! I didn't have fresh parsley so used dried. I will make again - I think I would have liked it better if I'd cooked at a slightly lower temp ; below medium heat - my chicken had scorch marks on it. Overall I think it's a good recipe.

This recipe is a HIT!!  I add chicken broth when making sauce, thicken it slightly with a slurry of cold water & flour.  I also cut each chicken breast in about 3 even pieces, place in gallon size bag and pound meat to thinner pieces.  -not real thin.  I never have any left when I make for family as they want to always bring some home with them.
