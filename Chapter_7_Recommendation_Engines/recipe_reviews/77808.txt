Although I used white chocolate instead of frosting, I am still rating this. I used 6 oz of a good quality white chocolate. Painted it on the rod with a silicone brush. I then rolled the rods in sprinkles and edible sparkles. The sparkles didn't add that much to the overall look so I won't bother with them next time. They look great, are easy to make and the kids I served them to loved them. I got 29 wands using this method.

I don't get it. The frosting is soft gooey and messy.  Is there a way to stiffen the frosting after toppings?

Easy and fun. I made these as a Halloween treat for a coworker's kids. I'm going to try them again some time with melted white chocolate instead of frosting. Thanks for the recipe - cute idea!

I do something similar, but I use the candy melts because there are lots of colors and you can layer them. There is so much more you can do with those rather than just icing or chocolate.

This works really well with melted white chocolate chips too.  It is a nice not too sweet treat for Halloween and it's a very simple and quick way for the kids to participate.

I've made these for years at Christmas time, instead using melted chocolate & white chocolate chips, also coating with crushed peppermint, cashews & sprinkles. I am excited about the frosting idea!

What an easy and fun project to do with your children! My daughter and I made a whole batch for a party tomorrow. In additon to vanilla frosting we also used chocolate. I do believe they'll be the hit of the party!

Such a fun idea.  I used white chocolate chips because I've never known of frosting to harden to the point that I thought these should to keep them from being sticky.  I used a brush to apply the melted chips to the pretzel.  Then I sprinkled different colored sugars, sprinkles, nonpareils, etc. onto the pretzel.  I sprinkled it over a paper plate and then poured the excess that fell onto the plate back into the container.  Next time I think I'll try almond bark instead of white chocolate chips....I just like the taste better.

Like many others I used white chocolate instead of frosting.  It firms up better.  We used ours for a bake sale.  We rolled them in chopped up M&M's, chopped peanuts, Nerd's candies, and crunched up peppermint candies.  They are always a hit.

Tim on Mar 09 gave this a 1 star rating.  The vanilla frosting will not get hard unless you put it in the fridge..I make these rods at Christmas all the time and I use white chocolate bark, melt it and roll the pretzel rods in it, then i have all my sprinkles or chopped nuts in different bowls to roll the chocolate covbered rods in. I cool them on wax paper, and then I can put them in clear plastic bags for gift giving..They are very pretty and easy to make.I gave it 5 stars because it is a very good recipe, if you make them correctly'

We didn't use frosting. We melted chocolate, added a bit of shortening, and used all sorts of sprinkles. We also melted peanut butter chips and butterscotch chips, white chocolate and dark chocolate. We drizzled one over the other to create flavor combinations. Gave them away for the holidays. Lots of fun :)

I make these for most of our holidays.  Just change out the color of the sprinkles to go with the particular holiday.  HOWEVER, I do not think icing would harden enough.  I have always used melted white chocolate or regular chocolate.  Then roll them in the sprinkles before the chocolate hardens and the sprinkles will adhere with no problem.  Kids love them and they are so simple to make.

Try using the fat pretzels and dip in chocolate (white and/or milk) and then sprinkle candies or colored sugar. With the white chocolate you can add good coloring for Halloween or Christmas.

Did these with white chocolate bark, which we melted in a medium non-stick skillet.  This allowed us to hold the end of the pretzel and twirl it around in the melted bark to cover down to our fingers.  Then sprinkled with colored sugars over a paper napkin.  In the end, twirled them into the "rainbow" mix of sprinkles that had accumulated on the napkin.  Also did some with decorator candy sprinkles.  Great idea.  Got 55 out of half the 20 ounce pkg of vanilla bark.  So cute and tasty too.

I made this for my daughter's "vampire" birthday party. The kids loved it!!! I loved it!!! I felt it best to twist the pretzel rod outwards in the icing can. Its not so gloppy that way, and it coats a lot more evenly. DONT MICROWAVE THE ICING TO SOFTEN IT!!! Its fine straight from the can...

These were a hit at school today! I would recomend making your own frosting (buttercream) Omit any margarine and only use butter. Makes them hold up better, then put in freezer until right before use. The kids loved these though!! They had two.

Okay, I think these are incredibly easy and quick. If you make a lot, it will take a long time, obviously, but just a plateful was finished in about 20-3 mins.   I think I used smaller pretzels--I used the pretzel sticks, and looking again at this recipe, it calls for pretzel rods.  Either way, though it works.  I did use vanilla frosting and regular sprinkles.  I agree with reviewers who've stated it's easiest to roll the pretzels on the side of the can.  I just used a knife to spread some frosting on the side, then just rolled the pretzel until I got the amount of frosting I wanted.  Then I dipped in the sprinkles--If you dump the sprinkles into a mound, then dip and roll the frosting covered pretzels in the sprinkles, it works really well.  I can see why others used melted chocolate or almond bark, but as a way of using up some extra frosting, this is fun.  I made some with a friend while decorating cupcakes, and she ate all of them almost as soon as I'd made them!  I made them today as a fun food contribution to a child's birthday party.  thanks for the recipe!

Used chocolate. Still hard to get a layer that didn't fall off heavy with sprinkles. Tastey, but hard to find the pretzel sticks in Canada.

I used Wilton's candy melts (no idea how frosting would harden enough not to make these a sticky mess) and they turned out super cute and very tasty.  I brought them to a Halloween party and got a ton of compliments.  Thanks for the cute idea!

These were so easy and fun and tasty too!  I used candy melts - melted them in decorator bags which worked like a charm for easy coating of the pretzels.  I also attached candy stars that I made with candy melts and star molds.  Stars stuck to the candy melts and stayed attached!  Big hit at the preschool Halloween Party and fun to make too!  Thanks for the great idea!!

The kids sure loved these!  My grocer didnt have much in the way of sprinkles, so they weren't all that festive but the kids didn't care at all.  I did use almond bark instead of icing.  I ended up putting it on with a spatula.  Then by sheer accident, I rolled one onto a glob of stuff that was on the spatula, it was a sort of curved spatula.  It was just enough curve that I could really roll my sticks.  So it took me a bit to get my grove on but then they were a snap.  Thanks for sharing!

Used almond bark in lieu of vanilla frosting. Firms up better after sitting where frosting does not.  Less of a mess when presenting, fun to make too.

great idea! I did almond bark instead just cause I think it tastes better and it stiffens so they will be easy to store. If I wanted to do a party for kids where I let them decorate them, then I would do the frosting.

Frosting and white chocolate are pretty gooey and messy, but doing these with almond bark works fantastic. Just put in the fridge or freezer on wax paper. Fantastic coated with crushed Heath bar, Butterfinger and peppermints.

Love this recipe.. . Make it with my nieces and nephews regularly. Although in England we use bread sticks as no pretzel rods here! We use chocolate too not frosting! They last much longer and probably less messy!

Why didn't I think of this?  They're perfect for every holiday.  Kids and adults love them.  They're festive and fun.  A little time consuming, but worth it for the cute addition they bring to any gathering.

Fun and easy although a bit on the messy side with the youngin's "help". I melted chocolate chips in the microwave (watch the time - chocolate burns!) and used a pastry brush to make sure there wasn't too much glopped on.  Sprinkling the sparkles with a spoon over the warm chocolate was easier than rolling the wand in a pile of candy bits.  Lay them on wax paper and tuck them in the freezer for a few minutes to harden the chocolate and quicker than you can say Abbracadabbra! You've got a sweet treat.

By using candy coating the sprinkles set nicely and were a big hit with the kids. I would think you would have to use a good crusting icing otherwise. Hope this helps others having problems w/soft store bought icing.

Tried it. Liked it. So versatile too. I wanted to pile lots of goodies on my sticks so the frosting is better than almond bark as a good mortar. I got fruity cheerios, mini reese's, twizzler strings and lots of sprinkles to stick then drizzled the white almond bark for a finishing touch and flavor. The treat was well received.  Used pretzel dipping sticks in addition to rods for smaller hands and tummies.

This is a great recipe. I've made these before, but never thought of them as 'magic wands'. I made them for my kids to share at school for Halloween and have made them for birthday parties. They are a big hit with kids! Its very versatile, as you can cover them with any sprinkles or sugar crystals or crushed candy, coconut, chocolate chips, etc. Super easy to make too!

I thought this was a really cute idea.  I had no luck with the frosting, so I used melted white chocolate chips.  The frosting never hardened and was just messy.  They turned out wonderful with the white chocolate and were a big hit at our party.

This was wonderful! I used melted chocolate like many other people did. I only gave it 4 stars because it was extremely difficult to cover the pretzel sticks in chocolate. I stuck them in the freezer to cool quickly, and it worked perfectly.

I made these for a halloween party at daycare.  The kids loved them.  I used store bought vanilla frosting.  I sprinkled with colored sugar crystals, stood them up in a glass and refrigerated a few minutes before wrapping individually in plastic wrap.  Worked like a charm!

Tim wants to know how to stiffen the frosting.  I use melted candy melts from the party store instead of frosting.  It gets very stiff after dipping the pretzel.  It works great!  Heat it to melt them, then dip and immediatly roll into sprinkles, nits or whatever.  Don't let even one drop of water come in contact with your melted candy melt though!

Super cute idea! I only made a few of them since they were just for me...I guess I'm still a kid at heart! I used a pink vanilla frosting with the sprinkles included and some tiny nonpareil candy sprinkles. They were good except they were a tad too sweet for me since I don't really like canned frosting too much.

Definitely use almond bark or white chocolate chips for the "wands" instead of frosting.  I tried both...the bark is just less messy.  Really great idea!!  Kids and adults loved them.  Thanks for sharing!

Instead of frosting I used white chocolate. I melted chocolate in a glass bowl in the microwave. Used a butter knife to spread on rods applied sprinkles then set aside on wax paper for a few minutes to harden. Delicious! Extremely easy so let my 8 year old do everything but  microwave step.

These were soooo easy, I just made them with autumn sprinkles for a harvest party and didn't even use a bowl. I broke the rods in 1/2 since they were so long and dipped and twirled right in the can of frosting, put sprinkles on a paper plate, rolled them in it and set them out on wax paper and everyone ate them up, kids and adults! Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe.

As another suggested, I melted white chocolate in microwave and used silicone brush to apply to pretzel sticks 3/4 of the way down the stick.  Rolled in halloween sprinkles.  Bought halloween cello snack bags with twist ties at dollar store.  Perfect for halloweeners and my grandchildren! Simple but impressive looking!

Using Almond Bark works better for me than the icing.  It's not as soft. ( although the icing is GOOD too.) Pop the Almond Bark in the microve at 15 minute intervals until it is melted enough to  coat the pretzels, roll in your choice of sprinkles or colored sugar.

Great Idea!  Very easy and fun for the kids.  I've never taken the time to melt chocolate, so when I saw this recipe I knew I would try it.  I swirlled the rods in the icing and the kids rolled them in sprinkles.  These will become a family favorite to make!

We had our kids group makes these for their "cooking" dessert.  They had a blast making them, and it was great for us because it was cheap and EASY!  Thanks for a fun idea :)

These are so cute and very festive. I made them for halloween, but I think they would be a hit at any childrens party/activity.

I could not find the long pretzel rods at the store so had to buy smaller "twist" rods.  Still worked and just made short "magic wands", but Yummy Ones!!!

So simple and yummy!  I put several different toppings on them based on what I had in my cabinet.  Some had sprinkles, some had mini chocolate chips, others had nuts or colored sugar.  It would be fun to try different flavor frostings.  My 8 y.o. and I don't like hard pretzels, but I can tell you that these are a great mix of salty and sweet.
