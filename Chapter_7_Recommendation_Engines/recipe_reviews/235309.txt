Tip: keep stirring the pot until it gets to 300â€¢. Very important! Next, I do not recommend doubling recipe. Just make two separate batches. When I did double it came out like soft taffy.

Sooo good! If you dont have a candy thermometer, you can fill a glass with cold water and drizzle a sample of the candy into it. If it hardens immediately, its ready to come off the heat :)

This was an expensive disaster. Not sure where I went wrong. It turned out very lumpy and crystallized. The candy portion reminded me of the maple candies that are made in Vermont. Not what you want for brittle. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't thrown it directly in the garbage after it cooled it off. Broken into small pieces and mixed into some softened vanilla ice cream, it may have been salvageable, even good. I've had lots of success making brittle in the microwave (never failed). I'll continue to use that method in the future.

Edit: Ok, I've done a little sleuthing on the contributor's page and see she has another recipe for maple pecan brittle that's almost identical with the exception of one critical ingredient, the maple syrup. That recipe clearly calls for "original maple syrup, the thick gooey stuff." I'm thinking that this would be something like maple flavored Karo syrup, not 100% pure maple syrup. I can't help but wonder if using pure maple syrup was the cause of this recipe failing. Proceed with caution if you're thinking about trying this recipe!

This was absolutely delicious! Definitely my new favorite brittle, and I don't know why there aren't more rave reviews about it. I halved the recipe and used butter instead of margarine (because that's what I had, and because that's what I've used in peanut brittle in the past) and it came out perfectly. I used the ice cold water / hard string that cracks method to test when to add the butter and baking soda. Perhaps I could have used a bit less butter, but overall I love this, will have to keep myself from eating it all in one sitting. The flavor of the pecans is really brought out by cooking them, and there is just a delightful hint of maple.

I have made peanut brittle for many years and decided to try this recipe for a change,  I was skeptical about adding water but decided to follow the recipe. Mistake. Next time I would omit the water as this didn't harden the same as my peanut brittle does and I ended up with something more like taffy. Will try this with walnuts as well.

I didn't make this recipe, but I have a question... If anyone can help...
I make an amazing peanut brittle. JS.
I've tried several times just subbing pecans for peanuts, and it just never comes out the same.. It comes out kinda chewy..
Is there a moisture difference or something between the peanuts and pecans? I don't know why it comes out so different.

I make this recipe several times and it's always a hit.
I did  stir constantly after adding the nuts at around 250 deg. and the recipe calls for 2 tsp. baking powder.....I use 2 1/2 tsp. of baking powder.  Oh, when the temp. gets to 3oo deg. make sure you have your margarine and baking soda ready,  it has to be added right away.

Had a problem. It tastes OK but it seems almost burned. It began to smell burned at about 250 degrees. Was I heating too rapidly or is there some other possible reason.......
