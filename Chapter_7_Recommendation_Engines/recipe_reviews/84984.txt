Delicious!  So quick and easy.  I used cod - instead of using butter spray I sauteed in vegetable oil with a little butter added for flavor.  Just rinsed the fish so that the lemon pepper and garlic would "stick".  I made this again with tilapia - it was good but I think I liked the cod better.

Delicious. But you definitely need to serve this with rice to help tone down the very flavorful sauce. My husband didn't think he would like it, but after eating his plate clean, he declared that he was pleasantly surprised.

My entire family thought this was a four star.  I did not have butter flavored cooking spray and proably will never own such a thing, so I left that out. We eat salmon every week and this was a nice change of pace.

Embarrassingly easy, this dish produced a moist fish with a good, salty zingy flavor, but nothing mind-blowing.  Perhaps a trifle too simple to be outstanding.

This recipe surprised me! I loved the flavor and the fish came out very moist.  Next time I will serve this with some bok choy or other type of cabbage and some white rice!

I'm giving this a 5 because my teenage son loved it too, which is rare. I replaced the oil AND cooking spray with real butter, not too much though. As suggested I added raw shrimp and truthfully I liked it better with the shrimp than the fish but still, nice combination. I'll make this again thank you!

This was just ok. My boyfriend liked it better then me. The oyster sauce amount should be cut down, 2 tablespoons of oyster sauce had 30% of the daily value of sodium which made it very salty.

We loved this recipe! It was quick, easy and tasted wonderful. My husband appreciated how easy it was to make.  We also did not use the butter flavored spray.

This was delicious! I didn't use the spray or any oil. I combined the oyster sauce, & garlic powder only in a bowl and spread it over the fish and baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 min. The entire family loved it!!

I'm usually a very good cook, but I tried this, and it just wasn't good.  Neither my fiancee nor I enjoyed it.  Sorry!

Super fast and easy.  Made it with a wild rice mix and it was a hit with the whole family.

I served it with white rice. I used frozen cod from Walmart. Very simple and easy to do. After adding the oyster sauce I allowed the fish to break apart into medium sizes pieces. Perfect balance with the white rice.
