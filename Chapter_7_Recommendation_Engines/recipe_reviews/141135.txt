I gave this as gifts this year in little canning jars. Everyone wanted the recipe. Just a tip - it tastes better after at least a day in the fridge. Add sugar to taste..I probably cut out about a 3rd of it, and increased the peppers because I like it hot!

I make this and spoon it over cream cheese. Let it set in the refrigerator over night so it blends some with the block of cream cheese (make sure and poke holes in the block of cream cheese. Serve with crackers. I won 1st place on a radio station Thanksgiving contest for this salsa dip recipe.

I've made this recipe, but decreased the sugar to 1/2, 1 lime & 2 jalepenos. Soooo yummy. The best thing you can do though, is dump the salsa over a cube of cream cheese. It's so pretty too. Serve with tortillas chips and/or crackers.

This is a great recipe!  The color, texture and flavor of sweet & spicy is perfect.  I adjust the peppers for my kids, but I like it with a little more kick than they do.  p.s. the longer it sits the more hot it becomes and it saves in the fridge for 7-9 days.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge success with the whole family.  I spread cream cheese on a platter and spread the salsa over the top of the cream cheese with whole berries for garnish--a great balance of flavors and pretty, too.  This will be a regular for future holidays.

WOW! What a wonderful way to have fresh cranberries!  Love all the fresh ingredients. As a bonus it's simple and easy to make. My family loved it so much the only thing we served it with was a fork!

This is better than the low-calorie recipe I lost and was looking for! I substitued 1/2 cup Splenda for the sugar and added a splash of orange juice.  I have made this recipe before with dried cilantro (2TBLS) and it turns out okay - fresh is definitely better, though!

MD Anderson suggests this for healthy living to their cancer patients.  It's fantastic!  My mother lost the recipe and said that this one is close enough.  Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and she uses orange zest as in addition to the other stuff.  We leave off the jalapenos for a more mild salsa...but personally...I like the jalapenos!  Pour over cream cheese for sure!  However, I could just eat this with a spoon!  :) UPDATE:::  My mom found her recipe!  ADD GINGER!!  2 Tablespoons of fresh ginger and 4 green onions.  Hers only calls for 1/4 cup of the cilantro.  ENJOY!

Wow, interesting and different and... really good!  I wasn't sure about this at first, it had a strange bitter taste.  But I'm glad I followed the suggestion of making it ahead of time (made it in the AM), put holes in the cream cheese, and put it in the fridge to let the flavors blend.  Much better with some time.  My guests loved it!  Also started with 1/2 the sugar and added more to taste.

I am so thrilled to have found this recipe.  I tried it once at a party where it was served over cream cheese and with crackers and I loved it.  I asked the hostess how she made it and low-and-behold I'd already forgotten by the end of the day.  So I did a search and this is it!  In another recipe I found, they used honey instead of sugar and also chopped up dried apricots to add to this but it isn't necessary.  This is tangy with a little bit of spice.  Thanks for posting!

Very, very good! I made this to spoon over some smoked chicken enchiladas, and it gave a perfect finish to the dish. I did use poblano instead of a jalepeno. Rather than dump everything in a food processor, I processed the cranberries a cup at a time in a mini-chopper until the texture was right. Finely hand chopped the green onions, cilantro and pepper and stirred all of it up in a bowl with the rest of the ingredients. Refrigerated overnight and it was wonderful. I may try to cut back a bit on the sugar or substitute honey the next time, but it's just about perfect the way it is.

Yummy!  This recipe is wonderful without any changes, and I froze half of it since I doubled the recipe.  With the other half I did some playing around with by adding fresh ginger and halved raspberries.  I blended the base cranberry salsa with cream cheese (added 1/4 c. at a time to get the flavor/consistency I wanted.)  Then I topped it with the jazzed up version.  It was sublime!  Lots of requests for the recipe after family Christmas (from picky eaters, no less).

My 6 year old son is a very picky eater but he loves this salsa. It's a great combination. I did decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup and thought it was still too sweet though. Next time I will reduce it to 1/4 cup.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the hit of the party!  My husband's family can be very picky and several new recipes that I've made for holidays have fallen flat.  This one definitely did not!  I used Splenda instead of sugar and it tasted great.  I doubled the amount of cranberries, jalapeno and used a big bunch of cilantro and green onions. Instead of doubling the limes, I used 3 total limes and the juice and zest of a small orange.  Several people asked for the recipe and I'm sure this will be a staple at all future family get-togethers.

I actually would give this recipe 10 stars, if it weren't for the fact it calls for SO much sugar.  I double the recipe and only use 1/4 cup of sugar and it is PERFECT.  I make this for family and work all the time and everyone loves it.  It's my new favorite food and I keep in the fridge at all times!

I have made this for a few years on Thanksgiving and IT IS SO EASY TO MAKE! Every year I get the same comments:  "that is the best salsa I have ever had," "if you make more of that I want to buy some," "how did you do that?" "that is awesome!" and then it quickly disappears.  IT IS SO EASY! It is tempting to keep it a secret because IT IS SO EASY and people think I am so awesome, but I always share the recipe and then all of a sudden they seem disappointed that it wasn't some kind of magic that made it so good.  I make this because IT IS SO EASY! Your guests will not be disappointed and IT IS SO EASY!  DID I MENTION IT'S EASY TO MAKE? The only difference with mine is I used bhut jolokia pepper instead of a jalapeno (a very small one and it was probably a solid medium in heat level rather than mild), a little warm for some so last year I made two batches with one more mild.

This recipe is great! I use to buy Cranberry Salsa from the Elegant Farmer no need anymore. I made it the night before to serve the next day for Christmas Eve. I did add a half of green pepper and half red pepper and used half a large red onion instead of using green onions those were my only changes.  It came out FANTASTIC! I served it with tortilla chips. I am going to make it again for New Years Eve!

I liked it alot but, found it to be more of a relish (which is fine) than salsa.  It was much better two days later.  I deceided to try it on a turkey hot dog (in the roll), and  It was fabulous!  I would not hesitate serving it with any turkey dish that's for sure.  Thanks for something different : )

The "fresh market" I went to didn't have fresh or frozen cranberries so I used 2 14oz cans of whole cranberry sauce- I had to  make it for a party the next day and didn't have time to store hop. I wasn't sure how it would turn out but it is super-tasty. I just didn't need to add the sugar.

This is a HUGE hit with everyone!  The only change I make is to leave out the cilantro (some family members are not a fan of it) and it is DELICIOUS!  Showed  the recipe to a friend who doesn't like spicy and was afraid of the jalapeño, but once she tried it, she couldn't get enough!  Perfect blend with cream cheese and crackers.

Amazing salsa!  It's a big hit any time I bring it somewhere.  I add an extra jalapeno pepper to give it some more kick.  It's very sweet, so the extra pepper doesn't make it too hot.  It's a wonderful alternative to the traditional Thanksgiving cranberry sauce. Also good as a meat marinade.

Wonderful recipe that friends and family have enjoyed this year and last at Christmas.  If you buy bags of cranberries now, you can keep them up to 1 year in the freezer.  I made this recipe in July, too.  It's great served over a block of cream cheese (just let it get to room temperature so it's easy to dip).  3/4 cup of sugar was too sweet, so I cut it to 1/2 cup and added a little Splenda if necessary. And I preferred the green onions diced. Instead of 2 limes, I used a little lime juice I had on hand Yummy!  Thanks for sharing.

This was served at a Christmas party I attended with chips--no cream cheese--and was the hit of the party.  I came home and found the recipe here, and this is what all my friends are getting in their Christams stocking! I do love it served over cream cheese, helped with the heat.  Also used splenda instead  of sugar, talk about healthy!

I love cranberries, so I buy a few extra bags during winter when they're in the stores and freeze them. This looked interesting and different, so I decided to try it. It was a little too sweet, and although it definitely had a good flavor, it was overwhelming. The jalapeno, cranberries, onions and sugar are all strong flavors and it needs something to mellow it a bit. I think I am going to try another reviewer's idea to mix some of it with cream cheese. There is a lot of possibility here, and I love that it is an unusual use of cranberries.

So good and so easy!  I used frozen cranberries, so mine was a little cold, but it worked well with tortilla chips and as a side with chicken soft tacos.  It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory flavors.

This was a huge hit at a family gathering. I did use less sugar, added the cilantro to taste, used 1-2 Tbsp of red onion and added more jalapeno. Served it over softened cream cheese using pita crackers with sea salt. I made it the day before so the flavors could meld. I was told by all, that I have to bring this to every gathering. It was delicious and the family gobbled it up in a flash :)

Made this with the Turkey Mercedes this year, and this salsa is a good compliment. Can't wait to use with a turkey sandwich. We will use less cilantro because it was to much even using 1/3 bunch.

I thought this was excellent! The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was because it only called for one jalapeno. I couldn't even taste it. The second time I made it, because the first batch got gone so quickly, I put two in. Still couldn't taste it. Next time I'll go for three. I'm wondering what it would taste like with habineros in it. I'll bet it'd be awesome! Great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I so wanted to like this! Especially since I love all the ingredients individually. but this ended up just tasting like cranberry sauce with onions in it. Cream cheese makes it better, but only just. Such a waste of good cranberries (and they're nearly impossible to find in Australia!) Not sure if I did something wrong - I followed the recipe quite closely, but maybe based on the amount of good reviews I went awry on the measurements.  Either way I won't be making this again!

Delicious salsa! I added 4 jalapenos and decreased the sugar to about 1/4 cup and let it sit overnight before serving and it was so yummy! Thank you for posting this recipe!

Wow, this is the first time I'm giving a review, and I just had to write in about this one!  A great twist on traditional cranberry sauce (BORING!)  Just make sure you add sugar to taste. I ended up using a scant half-cup.

I don't have a good processor so I cut everything by hand. Cranberries were a bit annoying to chop but I'm very happy with how it turned out.

I have never liked cranberrie sauce...  untill I tried this recipe. I buy all the crandberries during the holidays and freeze them so I can enjoy the tasty sauce all year long. I make enough to give to my neighbors, friends and family for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

YUMMY!

A friend served this and I was amazed at how fresh and amazing it tasted. As soon as I got home, I was on the hunt to find the recipe and stumbled across this one. Glad I did! Changed up the recipe just a bit by adding a half of red onion and 2 jalapenos instead of one for a bit of a kick. This recipe is so easy to make and a great gift to give out to friends and family.

Oh my gosh, this is suprisingly delicious. I also spread out cream cheese and poured this on top. I used key lime juice instead of fresh limes, and it was still fantastic. This is going to be a holiday favorite.

I put the cranberrys in the food processor to chop them up. I wish I would have processed them a little longer so that the berry's were a little more even (if they aren't more fine when you eat it you get a big hit of the tart cranberry).  Overall we really enjoyed this one and will make again. I served with tortilla chips.

I wanted to try something diffferent with cranberries for Thanksgiving. Although I was hesitant to try this recipe since I am not a big fan of cilantro. However, when made the day before it is to be served you can't even taste the cilantro as the ingredients meld together. This recipe is not only good when served with the amin course, it is also delicious when placed on top of cream cheese and served with crackers as an appetitizer.

I do this one, but I add half an orange chopped up and 2 tablespoons of honey instead of the sugar.  It's great with the turkey!

I ran into trouble finding cranberries, fresh or frozen, so I substituted mango and it tasted pretty good. I prefer the cranberries, but the mango worked in a pinch.

Really great! I was skeptical about this recipe, but trusted all of the five-star reviews and made it for my family's Thanksgiving dinner. It was fabulous! Great with chips or as a condiment on leftover turkey sandwiches (mmmmmmm!).

I have never had as many requests for a recipe as this one! I made it exactly as is and it was a hit! I might even add an extra jalapeño next time but it was great regardless.  I made it with fresh cranberries for a Thanksgiving appetizer so I prepared everything on Tuesday and let it all sit and meld, Wednesday poked holes in a block of cream cheese and poured it over, and served it on Thursday with multigrain crackers. it was a serious favorite.

I used my leftover thanksgiving cranberry sauce(about 1 cup) so I didn't add any sugar. I also added an extra jalapeño, and a tad more lime juice. This was perfect over shredded turkey!

Good flavor... even one jalapeno made it quite spicy! I followed the recipe and made several batches. I ran out of sugar and used Truvia baking sugar instead of real sugar and it was not noticeable. Can't wait to pour this over cream cheese and scoop it up!
Thanks for the unique recipe.

This raw cranberry salsa was a HUGE hit at our holiday feast - we always smoke a turkey, and season up a standing rib for roasting in the oven. This cranberry salsa stood up wonderfully to the strong smokey/seasoned flavorings of the meats.  It is just spicy enough, and has just the right amount of sweet.  It lasts well (a week in the 'fridge), and is extremely easy to prepare!

Wow! Thank you...this recipe was a HIT at my party. I literally had to promise everyone I would send them the recipe. I did follow the suggestions and cut the sugar to 1/2cup and poured the salsa over cream cheese and served with multigrain chips. I only had an hour for the salsa to chill in the refrigerator vs. over night and it was still incredible!

I made this today to see if I wanted to make a large batch for our day after Christmas party, and I was very Surprised how good it was. I did cut the sugar to just a little over 1/4 cup. And added 1 Habanero chili pepper instead of Jalepeno.
My husband who is very picky loved it. Great over cream cheese!

Very versatile how it is, great over chicken or turkey but as a salsa holy cow it's sweet and no spice! I recommend putting in 1.5 limes, juiced of course and a little lime zest. Add an extra jalapeño and CUT THE SUGAR to about 1/3 cup than add more as you go to your desired taste.

Made this as the recipe calls and it was wonderful.  I did not have a full bunch of cilantro, but enough to give it a great flavor.  Think I might use two jalapenos the next time.  My daughter almost cried when I told her she could take the remainder home with her!!  Like most others, I put it over a block of cream cheese.  Has already been requested for xmas.

First off, I will definitely make this again. However I will tweak it next time. I think half the cilantro might help (I'm not a big fan of cilantro though) and adding some orange zest or juice might help. There was something a little off about this. It was good but I think it can be improved. Maybe a bit of agave nectar for sweetness?

Almost everyone who's tried this has asked me for the recipe -- even the one who loathes onions! It's delicous and I agree with a couple of other reviews, it does taste better the day or two after you make it (but that's the case with just about any salsa). Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this with more 3 limes and 1/2 cup sugar. great, sour with a slight burn.  it went over great at party. tried it on Brie and cream cheese, it was a waste of brie as the taste overpowered it, cream cheese worked as well. My wife liked it best on corn chips

LOVED this idea....however, I prepared the traditional cranberry sauce per the fresh cranberry pkg recipe AND added this to that base.  Made a huge difference, wasn't as "crunchy"as  what you get with just doing the recipe.  MOST excellent sauce when serving Turkey quesadillas as your leftover "sammie"!!  A little twist to the boring turkey sammies!  OH, eliminate sugar from this recipe if you are doing what I did....it will be too sweet if you don't

I agree that it is best to reduce lime juice and increase jalapeño. I added the full amount of sugar but will cut back next time a bit. Great recipe!

Outstanding recipe.  Only change was to halve the sugar as suggested by others.  Letting it sit a day or two helps the favors blend.  Unlike regular salsa/pico, this doesn't get too juicy when sitting an extra day.

This Recipe is fantastic.  If you use your salsa with cream cheese, reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup.

Make ahead of time it is much better the next day, it was a hit! I only used about 1/4 - 1/3 of a bunch of cilantro and added sugar to taste. A great holiday salsa!

This is a big hit at holiday gatherings.  You have to experiment with size of some ingredients.  How big are the limes?  How much is a "bunch" of cilantro?  I followed he recipe and the cilantro flavor was a little strong.  Jalapeño got lost.  But people loved it anyway.  Any good cook will experiment with the amount of ingredients in a recipe like this--to taste.

Amazing. Tried it with the family over Thanksgiving - it was a hit! They wouldn't even wait til dinner to try it. Used nacho chips to dip it in. I personally thought the onions were too strong  so when I doubled the batch, I didn't use more onions.  Several people asked for the recipe.

This salsa was great!  It is really easy to make.  I would be careful of the amount of cilantro, don't over do it.  I used a roast green chili to add some heat.

I made this for Thanksgiving, but made it with half a cup of sugar and a few dashes of red pepper flakes and it is delish! I will let it sit in the refrigerator overnight, and try it with the cream cheese. Simply wonderful!!

I didn't love it.  I used around 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also added a touch of cumin based on another recipe.  However, some people at the party couldn't get enough and wanted to recipe.  I would give it 3 stars but gave it 4 for them.

This was a huge hit with my family and coworkers. Many people asked for the receipe and all got the same response I did when they made it for the holidays.  This will be incorporated into our holiday staples. Served it with lime totilla chips, which really enhanced it.  I'm going to try it over chicken next.

I will definately make this salsa again with some "tweaks".  I will use less sugar (probably only 1/4 Cup) and two jalepenos.  The recipe as directed made the salsa a bit too sweet.  I like a little more zip! Very good though and my guests loved it!

I served this over a block of cream cheese with butter cracker this Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. I only added enough sugar to cut the tartness of the cranberries, about 1/2 cup. I also added an extra jalapeno for a little more heat.

Great flavor!  I added in 1-2 tbsp of pomegranate molasses at the end to kick up the acid / add a deeper sweetness.  Great complement to Thanksgiving flavors.

Tasty, easy to make and very popular!  If you have people who don't like cilantro, try using diced red onion to expand the flavor profile.  Highly recommend refrigerating overnight, if possible, to let the flavors fully blend.

I love this recipe! A friend made it for a get together a few years ago and I’ve been making it every since for the holidays. I do decrease the sugar to only 1/2 cup and I don’t seed the jalapeño, we like it spicy!

This is a winner.  It is essential for this recipe that you make it the day before using it, so the flavors can develop.  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  I also used the whole jalapeno, which is probably too hot for most people. I had this recipe in the past and lost it.  I am so happy to have found it again as it is soooo good!

Really good, really easy. Decreased sugar to 1/2 cup as preference. Add more or less sugar to your own taste. Used a 1/3 bunch of cilantro as I am not a big cilantro fan. Used fresh cranberries, served over a cream cheese block with holes poked in it for Thanksgiving appetizer.

Made it using half the amount of sugar and half the amount of cilantro, and it was a BIG hit at our Thanksgiving dinner!! Folks  were enthused about its freshness and "zip," without being overly sweet, and all thought it would take the next day's turkey sandwiches to a whole new level!  A nice fresh alternative to our   usual (cooked) sweet and tangy citrus, pecan and cranberry sauce.

I made this as a Thanksgiving appetizer. I followed other users advice and made it in advance, set it on some cream cheese, and let it sit in the fridge for the day. The funny thing about this dish is that it shouldn't be a fall/Thanksgiving dish!

The fact that it IS a salsa really comes through and frankly I'd rather have this on a taco than on a cracker, baguette slice, or turkey meat any day! I'm glad to have the leftovers for my family's weekly taco night! Yum!

This recipe was so good and I normally don't like cranberries! The only substitutes I did was use 2 Tbsp of Monkfruit sweetener instead of sugar and used 2 jalapenos. I kept the seeds in and it was HOT and sweet! It had no aftertaste from the Monkfuit and I didn't feel guilty eating it! YUMMY!!

What a simple and quick recipe. The salsa is great!! Since we like it more spicy, I added another jalapeño with some seeds. Also, I put extra lime juice. I think it would be just as good with just a little less sugar. Great recipe!

Colorful and festive! Fresh (even using cranberries that I placed in the freezer) and tasty, too!  I used about 1/3 of the sugar and more salt than called for in! This is a keeper!

I made this for a pre Christmas family dinner but it just might become my standard for salsa. This salsa is sweet- tart- spicy- and very good tasting. I’m not a fan of cream cheese but it definitely made the dish better in this instance. MORE PLEASE was the only request made about this salsa.

Delicious! Since my husband detests cilantro, I subbed this with flat-leaf parsley.  I also reduced the sugar to less than 1/2 a cup,  and only used 1 lime.  Will be making this again!

This a family favorite for  both Thanksgiving and Christmas. The only changes are adding a small can of crushed pineapple, and reduce the sugar a bit.  I spread cream cheese over a large serving plate and spread the cranberry salsa over the top. So yummy served with crackers!

First time making this recipe, it was delicious! I put it over a block of softened cream cheese with crackers. Everyone loved the blend of flavors! For us it was just spicy enough but you could add more jalapeños to make it spicy. The key is making it the day before. Definitely making this again!!!

Loved this. For me, I would cut back on the jalapeño a bit because ours from the garden was spicy. Really great over cream cheese. I may try reducing the sugar slightly in the future as well.

I was excited to bring this to our annual camping trip.  There were about 21 of us, all adults, so I thought it'd be a fun & different type of snack.  Most of the people are open to trying new things.   This recipe bombed, no one liked it for more than one mouthful.  It was over powered with cilantro taste, which surprised me since I used what it called for.  Not sure what it needs to be better, but I guess I won't waste my time trying to figure it out.   I'd say if you don't like cilantro, don't add as much as called for.  No other ideas of how to make better.  Maybe add a can of crushed pineapple?

This recipe is a total find! Here are my changes: I processed each ingredient separately to control consistency of each ingredient. Per reviews I only used 1/3 cup of sugar, used 2 pickled jalapeños (seeded) and a little of the jalapeño juice. My son said "it is amazing" ~ Thanks for posting!

Modifications needed, but highly recommend this...

We have made this recipe for last 10+ years. I found it in the comments of a lifestyle blog. Here is the revised recipe: 1 pkg whole fresh cranberry, 1 small bunch cilantro (you can use thin stems), 1 small bunch green onion (whites & greens minced), 1 lime zest & juice, 1 or 2 jalapeno (seeded), 2 tablespoon minced ginger, 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. We use food processor only for the cranberry and mince everything else by hand.

Other tips:  Ginger is the magic ingredient. Sugar - start with 1/3 cup sugar; 3/4 cup sugar will make this too sweet! ( I use 1/2 cup sugar in a double batch). It's better on tortilla chips than with cream cheese. Make it at least 4 hours prior, but preferably night before.

I'm a cranberry lover and this recipe sparked my interest.  Although I like it hot my wife does not so I skipped the jalapenos.  Made a day ahead of time and and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  I served this on a turkey tacos and it was outstanding!  Also goes well on chips or crackers and I think would be wonderful mixed with Greek yogurt.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I used 2 jalapeno peppers and was glad I did that. I did make it 1 day ahead but I'd actually recommend 2 days to really allow the flavors to mix together.

This recipe was incredible!!! Watch the size of the jalepeno, 1.5” length should be perfect, so it’s not too hot.
The salsa would be fantastic over grilled pork loin chops.
Cranberry season is short, so stock up, and freeze cranberries for future use!

I got a ton of complements on this salsa.  And, since I don't have a food processor, I had to use my little Cuisinart chopper, which worked well when I chopped the cranberries separately and then mixed everything together. 

It was really delicious!

I made this for my crochet group last night!  As suggested, I served it over cream cheese.  The only change I made to the recipe was a little less sugar.  It was devoured!  They all begged for the recipe.  This one is a no-brainer!  I will be making it again soon!

This is a keeper.  I cut the sugar in half as suggested by others.  Followed the directions exactly aside from that.   Fantastic - everyone loves it.

This was a great salsa. What a wonderful combo of ingredients. It was so easy too. I would definitely make it a day ahead for the full flavor. Will make a wonderful addition to any chicken or turkey meal . One jalapeno pepper was just right for me.

I had so many cranberries left over from thanksgiving, and this was the perfect solution.  The first batch went over so well, I had enough cranberries to make a second!  I really recommend letting the salsa sit overnight, it will be so much spicier! Very tangy spicy salsa.

This recipe was too sweet and still very tangy. Too tangy for me to eat more than a few small bites. No one in my house was a fan of this. We won't be making it again.

Not bad added more peppers for spice.  Tried to cut out some of the sugar that was a bad idea.  Use the sugar for sure.  

I like this with Blue Chips, looks very pretty.
