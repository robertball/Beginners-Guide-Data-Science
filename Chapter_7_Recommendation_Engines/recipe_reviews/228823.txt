I think it's a great starter recipe! I did not have any broccoli and I used a different cut of meat. Since the last reviewer said it needed a little something I added a tsp of ginger and a bit of salt and pepper to the meat in the beginning. Then I replaced the broccoli with green bell peppers. It was a hit! Even the baby loved it :)

Hubby and I both liked this. It's very easy to make and is ready in no time.  I used flank steak instead of sirloin and I didn't have any green onions, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  We both though it needed a bit of something, so after the first few bites we added some crushed chilis for a bit of heat.  There are so many different ways you could make this by using different veggies and seasonings. I liked the addition of the sesame seeds. I'll make this one again!

Embellish this if you like with  rice wine (as I did) or rice wine vinegar, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce or ginger.  Or vary the vegetables (I used celery, onion, Chinese cabbage, zucchini, red bell pepper, mushrooms and fresh bean sprouts).  Or serve with rice, lo mein noodles, or just on its own for a healthy, low carb meal (as I did) - but still very nice prepared just as is.

It was O.K. but I ended up adding lots of salt and pepper as well as teriyaki sauce because there wasn't very much taste to it. Also I added other vegetables like zucchini, water chestnuts and more onions. Overall very easy!

my family loved this recipe with the following changes. (1) I added roasted garlic infused olive oil instead of vegetable oil and (2) I did have seeds so I used sesame seed oil. I mixed both oils for the amount needed.  (3) I added more fresh garlic.  (4) I used leeks instead of green onions, since that is all I had. (5) I lightly seasoned the meat with garlic salt and lemon pepper.  Be careful not to use too much garlic salt since you need to add soy sauce.  The meal was wonderful with white steamed rice.  Very simple and easy to make.

Great and easy recipe, would suggest raising the portion quantity as the portions are quite small and adding more salt and seasoning as the recipe is quite bland as is

Followed as written, but doubled to feed my hungry family of five and everybody enjoyed it, even my picky 3 year old.  Will definitely make this again, thanks for sharing!

This recipe was super easy and the beef loin I used maintained excellent flavor and consistency. I would say that instead of moving the beef over the to the side of the pan, I would try to keep the beef on top of the vegetables while they are cooking so that it doesn't overcook. I had to cook the vegetables a bit longer as I used summer squash and bok choy. Yum!

Made this using left over london broil that had been marinated in McCormick Grill-mates Chipotle Pepper marinade.  Added water chesnuts and mushrooms to the recipe and served over white rice with la-choy chinese noodles on top.  Came out very tasty but a little dry, could use a sauce.

This recipe was good as written but great with a few modifications! First of all, season the beef! I used McCormick Grill Mates roasted garlic and herb! I also added some fresh ginger, and minced onions for extra flavor. Also two tablespoons of soy sauce for me just didn't do it.  I say continuing adding it to taste. After these changes, the flavor of the stir fry was wonderful! I will be making this again and again!!

Quick and easy! This is a good recipe that you can play around with based on your preferences and what you have on hand and it still works. I've made it a few times. I've substituted a different cut of meat and add it near the end when the veggies are partially cooked (my wok isn't really big enough to just keep the meat at the side after). I also add the green onion at the very end and just cook for about 30 seconds. I also added a few drops of sesame oil because I didn't have any sesame seeds.

I added a little bit of cracked pepper and seasoned with salt and some Thai sweat sauce as garnish ... Ideally I think if u cook the beef with some soy sauce drizzle to start with , would flavor the beef better

This is a great recipe. I did not follow it to a T but followed the basic guidelines. Use vegetables that go well in stir frys and feel free to mix it up a bit with different meat, sauces and vegetables. Very quick and simple. Happy Cooking!

Since my family isn't big on broccoli or carrots, we substituted in baby corn, water chestnuts, baby portobellos, asparagus and yellow onion for the green. With all the extra vegis we doubled the meat to 2 lbs. This is really a great 'base' recipe that allows you to cater to everyone! We'll definitely be making this again.

Did increase ingredients as at last minute invited neighbors in for supper. Did add sugar snap beans. Added rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, ginger and sesame oil to Bragg's Liquid Aminos ( as I don't use soy sauce. Better for you and the taste is similar)
I wish it made more sauce. 
It was easy and tasty. Will make again.

This was good. I used a defrosted bag of frozen stir fry veggies, and substituted Bragg's Liquid Aminos for the soy sauce. Served over brown rice with Sriracha on top. Yummy, and diet-friendly.

This was the best. Just looked up beef and broccoli recipe and this recipe came up. Had everything for it. Quick and easy and QUICK again! Didn't use almonds and used teriyaki instead and over rice. Teenagers actually ate and liked their veggies and great recipe to add any veggie you have in the stir fry.

Good recipe - will make again. Cleaning and chopping the vegetables in advance saves a ton of time. Otherwise, the prep for this meal takes longer than the time noted in the recipe.

Made it true to the recipe except that I only used half of a red bell pepper because it was what I had. The dish didn't suffer at all for it and the spiciness was just right for me. Served over rice and was the best quick meal that I made this week. Will definitely save this one to use again!

I added this recipe to my favorites list not even a month ago and I have made this, using different variations every time, at least 5 times. my family loves this recipe and I've paired it with rice or noodles and it always pleases. I usually use beef stew meat and switch up the vegetables. the last time I made this I cooked with onions, broccoli and served with noodles. I love adding sesame seeds to it because I think it gives it an extra taste and I put extra soy sauce because it never seems to be enough sauce for me. I would definitely recommend this recipe for anybody that's pressed for time and wants to make a quick easy meal that the whole family will enjoy.

I used top sirloin which was a bit tough. But the flavors were great. I added red pepper flakes and black bean sauce to heat it up. Will try to find a more tender cut or slice it thinner next time.

Yummy! I seasoned the meat with some McCormicks steak seasoning, seared it in garlic-infused olive oil, and while it finished cooking I tossed in some chopped onion until soft. I dumped that into a bowl and put broccoli, red bell pepper and zucchini in the pan with a little more garlic olive oil and a splash of coconut aminos (soy allergy). When the veggies were done, I put the meat back in the pan, added another splash of coconut aminos, stirred it up and served it over rice. SO good! Can’t wait to try it with other veggies!

Quick and easy to make  on any night. I made some tweaks  for my alterations: I swapped the beef for chicken, use regular sesame seeds untoasted, use 4  sliced baby carrots instead of one carrot, and use brown rice instead of cauliflower rice. Since I didn't have any green onions, I passed on it.  I would make it again and add some water chestnuts to it.

I was a little underwhelmed by this recipe. I added a bunch of pepper, but it was still pretty bland. Could use some kick!

Really easy to make. I didnt have any broccoli (ewwww broccoli) so I used an orange capsicum instead. I threw in some pepper and some spices to mix it up a bit. Had it with rice. 

Easy! Yum!

Will make again!  I had no green onion so I substituted with yellow onion. I also added celery and used a bit of ginger while cooking the beef as recommended by a previous review.  Very flavorful and quick meal, especially if the veggies are chopped earlier in the day!

Pretty good base. Saw some reviews stating it was a little bland, so added oyster sauce, soy sauce, sambal sauce and ginger. Very savory! Didn't have broccoli but it was good with just red bell pepper and carrots. Perfect over a cup (or two--it's that savory) of rice. Will make again for sure!

I just made this. It turned out great! I  made this for 6 people, but there were only 4 of us. We ate it all, lol.

I had peppers, napa cabbage, carrots and onions; they worked well. I used sliced ribeye. 

I added some red pepper flakes to it, for a little spicy bite. 

I'm going to try it again with chicken and asparagus. 

The homemade teriyaki sauce is very good. I boosted the ginger because I'm fond of that flavor.  About twice as much as the recipe called for.

This recipe is great! Super simple and easy. I added garlic and used stir fry sauce in addition to the soy sauce and it was awesome! Also used sesame oil in place of vegetable oil for a more authentic taste, but would be good either way!

A good, easy recipe. I followed the instructions to the letter as I often do when trying a new dish.
My wife and I both loved it!
Will definitely make it again but will probably add some mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. Also will use Tamari Sauce instead of Soy Sauce.
My only complaint would be that it would in no way feed six people (I think that is what it said).
And to those who say it is bland, maybe so but put a jar of Chilli Paste or Spicy Mustard on the table and let everyone season it as they please. I just used a little more Soy Sauce and it was great!

I agree - it needs a little "something". I also used ginger. Used  thinly sliced green peppers; Vidalia onions;  and shaved carrots for vegetables.  Sesame seeds are a great texture enhancement.  Served with packaged Spanish rice, with same pepper/onion/carrot mixed in. Turned out fine!

Quick and easy recipe! I added yellow onion in place of green onions and I thought it was a nice addition. I also added a little crushed red pepper flakes.   It certainly wasn't bland, but it wouldn't hurt to add a little flavor.

I used tenderloin which was delicious .  It comes out less saucy than what you get at a restaurant.  I added rice wine at the end with the soy sauce.  It still tasted good.

I did like this, and so did my husband, but there was not as much flavor as we like.   I think the next time I make it I will add some ginger.  Will comment again after I try it.
It was very simple to make, which I greatly appreciated!

Fast and easy and great tasting. I decided to eye ball the soy and opted to allow guest to add more if they wanted. Omitted the sesame seeds since I did not have them.

Would recommend steaming the broccoli and the carrots before adding them to the stir-fry. Otherwise, other ingredients may become overcooked or burnt.

I added fresh sliced mushrooms and quartered lengthwise the smallest of the baby carrots. This made for more colorful stir fry. Add the carrots at the beginning of cooking the veggies and the mushrooms last. I love stir fries as they come together very quickly.

I cooked in large pan, not having a wok. It was fresh and simple to make. I recommend using 1/2 bell pepper - one was too much. And maybe more carrots. Any combo of veggies that suit you would work. I added extra soy sauce at the end for more volume.

So simple, I wasn’t expecting much, but it was delicious! I was looking for a recipe to use up some broccoli, and didn’t want a casserole. Used pork instead of beef, but otherwise followed the recipe. Served over rice and there were no leftovers!

Hard to rate this.  Wife and son didn’t like it, daughter and I had seconds.  I took several reviewers advice and added pinches of salt, pepper, a few red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp dried ginger.  I still found it bland but others found soy dominated.  Hard to win sometimes.

i used left over cubed chicken vs beef and it was simply delicious! Even better was that I was able to whip it up in 15 minutes. Thanks for sharing!

I made this several times. There are many ways of cooking this. I marinate the beef instead with garlic ginger paste, brown sugar, soy sauce. And add peanut to finish.

My family loved it! Used a little teriyaki sauce with the soy sauce, doubled the veggies and garlic.

I followed the recipe as a base, but used NY steak instead of sirloin, sesame oil instead of vegetable and added generous portions of salt, pepper and crushed red pepper flakes to the beef. I also used rice vinegar to add some flavor.

This was a bit dry. Next time a little rice vinegar or hoisin sauce to create a little sauce. Altogether not bad, and was particularly quick and easy.

Just not enough flavor.  Even adding fresh ginger, extra garlic and some additional soy just didn't do the trick.  I may try to keep working with it ...

Since this recipe was quite bland according to previous reviews, I decided to sauté the beef in red onion slices, minced garlic, and chopped ginger first. After that, I put the veggies and chives in, stir-fried them with the beef and added oyster sauce, soy sauce, and toasted sesame seeds. Also, I seasoned the raw beef with salt, pepper, and dried basil to give it an instant oomph. 

Overall, it tasted great!

This was good, but it needed something else. It was a little dry. It was also my first stir fry so I am not exactly sure how I would liven it up.

I substituted spinach for broccoli, and regular onion for green onions. Also added garlic and onion powder. Used Kroger pre-cut stir fry meat. Ended up quite delicious! Next time I'll add some  red pepper flakes to it to give it some spice

I served with rice-a-roni stir fried rice and it was yummy. The first time I followed exactly minus broccoli because I didn’t have any. Second time I included the broccoli but increased the amount of meat to go farther. I’m not a beef eater but this was good and passed with the men in my household.

The flavors for this are there, and actually really good, however two whole carrots is way way to much. It smelled of nothing but carrots, and being pregnant the smell was to strong.

I will def make this again! Such an easy recipe and all that you need to eat in one full swoop! Maybe a little rice but you don't even need that! I used the sirloin in a package that is already cut from Wegman's and it was unbelievably easy and tasty! I did add some ginger to it...very very good!

Marinade the steak before cooking would make it less tuff.  No carrots or green onion it spoils the whole beef broccoli receipe

Plus I used teriyaki instead of soy for extra taste.  Just soy will not cut it.  Plus I used sesame oil instead of veggie.  You need the extra flavour but the receipe is quick and easy to do.

The recipe was incredibly simple, but it does need a little extra flavor and adding some teriyaki sauce like someone else suggested was perfect.

This is a fantastic recipe! I used this as a base recipe for beef stir fry (sorry, but I did make some alterations for my taste). I used sirloin tip sliced thin and across the grain, onions, minced garlic, fresh ginger, yellow bell pepper and broccoli. I seasoned the beef with garlic salt and then cooked the beef first, in small batches and set aside. Then I used sesame oil to cook the veggies. Added meat back to the skillet and added soy sauce and oyster sauce to taste (about 1/8 cup of each). Served with white jasmine rice. This came out great! I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch. I'm really glad I tried this and will be making it again.

For a quick recipe this is as good as it is going to get.... relatively few ingredients, easy preparation, and healthy veggie component.  If you have more time I would suggest marnating the beef with garlic, ginger, and some soy sauce, and sesame oil. Then you'll have a 5 star recipe.

I used London Broil and added water chestnuts. I always use frozen broccoli for stirfries because fresh doesn't get done to the degree I like it with a short cooking time. I doubled the amount of soy sauce and added about a half teaspoon ground ginger. Everyone liked it, from those who like mild dishes to thise who like spicy. We ate it with noodles. I'm making it again this week!

It was an okay dish but certainly needed some more flavor and moisture.  I went with hoisin sauce/salt/pepper.  The steak I chose was a little tough, but can't fault the recipe for that.

There was not enough sauce. I over-cooked it a little to cook the broccoli.  It would be better with veggies that cook fast.

Soooooo tasty. I added some stir fry teriyaki sauce but outside of that i did exactly as instructed.   The beef was tender, the vegetables were cooked perfectly and, most importantly, my wife was impressed. I'm making it again this weekend. Definitely on my list of favs!

I am not a huge fan of Asian foods but my husband is. I tried to find a recipe that we would both love. This recipe is awesome! I used low sodium soy and EVOO instead of veggie oil. This is actually the second time I have made it in two weeks! Instead of rice I used cauliflower. It was delicious!!!!

This is a super fast recipe to make, although there is alot of chopping veggies but that's fun. My only complaint was that it tasted a little bland. Could be because I'm using gluten free soy sauce I'm not sure. Overall it's an easy, healthy meal.

Turned out great but I upgraded the meat to flank steak and just seared it for a few seconds after the veggies were cooked so that it didn't get overcooked.  Also used more soy sauce.

The recipe is great I followed to the tee. I saw a lot of complains about the bland taste of the meat. (People hate this addition stuff, but..) I did sprinkle a little garlic salt and Lawry's salt to the beef during the first step. The beef had a lot of flavor.

Great recipe!

Really nice recipe! I also read that it needed something so I made a stir-fry sauce of corn starch, sugar, ginger and garlic, soy  sauce, rice wine vinegar, broth and water. Instead of sesame seeds which I didn't have, used sesame oil to begin with. It was enjoyed by all! Left over sauce will be used again.

I added chicken and beef with broccoli and green and red peppers and onions. I seasoned each meat separately and let marinate in a bag for a few minutes.  I seasoned peppers. Seasoninga were smoked paprika, salt, pepper, goya, sazon and garlic powder. After mixing all ingredients in pa  after following recipes to.cook meats first and separate i put in some gravy master to give flavor and some res pepper flakes with some chicken broth.
Mmmm good!!! I have a home daycare.so kids enjoyed over pasta and others rice and some just ate as is

I love this, because it is the easiest starting point for any stir fry. I have made this several times, but tonight I made just a veggie stir fry using this recipe and just doctored it by adding a bit of butter, sriracha, more pepper and soy sauce to bring those meaty flavors back in that would normally come from the meat juices. Combined with some chicken fried rice, this is thebomb.com

Delicious! I didn't use fresh green onion, so I added a chopped purple onion!  Then for seasonings, we added twice the mince garlic and didn't have sesame seeds. We used a teaspoon of ginger, fine black pepper, and cayenne, sprinkled some freeze dry green onion and dried red pepper. Then we served over rice with a little siracha!

Made it tonight and enjoyed it. I did add a little bit of cornstarch, as it seemed a tad runny without, and some freshly cracked pepper. Will be making again!

Very good, quick, weeknight meal.  I substituted bottled, low-sodium teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce.  (If I had more time I would have made the sauce from scratch --- good recipe on this site.) I added more veggies than the recipe called for, because, why not?  The more the better!  I served it over brown rice. My soccer-playing daughter inhaled it and gave it the thumbs up before running out the door for practice.  (She said cashews would have been good.  I agree).

I loved the recipe exactly the way it was written! I feel it was important to use strips of sirloin steak so the beef ended up tender. I've  used round steak before in stir fry and it ended up too tough.

Good and very adaptable as to what you can add in the way of veggies, also chicken or pork can be used. I serve this over rice cooked in chicken or beef broth, sesame oil and soy sauce.

Doubled the recipe and used one red and one yellow bell pepper. Marinated the beef in teriyaki sauce for 1 1/2 hours before cooking. Still a little bland. Adding salt, pepper and more teriyaki sauce made it better. Next time I will probably try adding some other flavors to the mix, possibly fresh ginger and hoisin sauce. All in all, a good meal, just lacking flavor.

This is my quick "go to" meal when I need something fast and yummy.  I use thin flank steak and it works out just fine . 
Ive made several times, sometimes with carrots, other times without (depends if my kids eat up all the carrots before I have a chance to cook it). Each time tastes just as good as the last time.  Also, I use pre-cut frozen broccoli to cut down on prep time.

I loved it, however I like most are saying the quantities needed to be adjusted. I served ours over rice and I guess we were looking for the sauce similar to that found in beef with broccoli sauce. So more sauce and seasonings = perfect dish!

It was good although it was very salty! I would suggest using low sodium soya sauce and don't add any salt.

I made this with beef sirloin steak. I found the meat to be a little tough. The next time I made it I use chicken breast cut into slices and it was delicious.

Cooked For Parents & Siblings... They Loved It! Instead Of Beef I Used Chicken. Took Longer To Cook But Had A Better Taste Than The Beef. Put An Extra Amount Of Soy Sauce &  Some Teriyaki Sauce. Served With Pan Fried Shrimp Dumplings, Eggrolls, & Spring Rolls. Perfect....

The only thing I changed was to add more broccoli and I only did that to use up the whole broccoli. Oh, I did also cook it for  a longer time because I ended up with too many ingredients for my medium frying pan so I split it between two pans and cooked a little longer. I absolutely loved this recipe!! I thought it came out perfect. Everything was perfectly cooked.. Not overcooked. Everything was seasoned perfectly.  I usually have trouble cooking beef without overcooking it but with this recipe it came out perfectly delicious and tender.  I look forward to making this one again!  My favorite thing besides the amazing taste.. Was how quick and simple it was! So important!

It turned out awesome!! I added some extra soy sauce, a little ponzu and some sesame oil right at the end. I also seasoned the meat with some salt and pepper. I think it could have used some more broccoli, but it still turned out great!!

Wanted something quick and easy using leftover grilled  steak and mushrooms, and this was perfect. Sprinkled a teaspoon of Ginger over sliced meat prior to browning with the sliced onion. Added broccoli and baby carrots, until firm. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, add the soy sauce and sesame seeds, and continue cooking for a couple minutes. Served with fried rice. Wonderful! Hubby loved it!

As already said, this is a great starter recipe and very adaptable.  I sauteed the minced garlic in the oil first to flavor the oil before cooking anything.... as I was taught by a Chinese cook.  I used round steak and a different mix of veggies, too.  I especially liked the addition of the sesame seeds.

First time I made it it was good, but sort of plain. Also was not a huge fan of the soy sauce, so the second time I changed it up a bit.
1. Veggies. I don't really like broccoli so I use sugar snap peas instead. Didn't have red pepper so I used green. Not as pretty but worked.
2. I put the garlic in with the oil before the meat, so that the meat would be infused with garlic and give it a bit more flavor
3. I changed out the soy sauce with A1 steak sauce. I make another meat recipes with potatoes on the campfire with A1, so I thought I would try it and it came out great.
The original recipe was great and I will make it again like that, but this was my kick

I used the soy, some ground ginger, a little vegetable oil, a little sesame oil and some rice wine vinegar to marinate the meat. I didn't add more soy during the cooking process because I was afraid it would be too salty, but I could have because the soy didn't overpower at all. I do recommend using only fresh vegetables as indicated in the recipe. It doesn't take that much more time, and frozen vegetables just don't have the same texture. The meat-to-veggie ratio is a bit meat-heavy, so feel free to double or even triple the amount of vegetables. Great basic recipe that I'll use again and again.

Very, very easy to make and very tasty.

Personally, it was a little heavy on the protein. Next time I make this I'm going to add more vegetables.

Instead of carrots I decided to add yellow and green bell peppers which added more colour to the dish, in addition to the red peppers in the original recipe

Loved it. My only issue was it was a tad dry - but that could have been because I left it on a bit too long.  Will definitely be made again.

I really liked the taste and how quick and easy it was to make.  I did find myself adding Soy Sauce to it once it was complete to add more moisture and flavor.  I think my error was in dishing it out of the pan and a lot of the liquid was left in the bottom.  Next time I will(not be lazy)and put it into a bowl and make sure all the liquid goes on top as opposed to the bottom.

Loved that this was simple and delicious and easily customizable.  We used the basic recipe and added stir-fry noodles in the last few minutes of cooking.

I used pork cutlets, as that's what I had on hand. Substituted mushrooms for broccoli.

I followed the recipe to a tee. However, I allowed my vegetables to cook way longer than the recipe called for, because I like my veggies on the softer side. I also added salt and pepper to taste while cooking and extra soy sauce once my food was plated. It was quick, easy, and delicious!

Quick healthy-ish meal that looks and tastes like a fancy one.
Great for students (like me) because we can switch out or add any veggies or meat that we have in the fridge, we really just need Soya sauce, garlic, and sesame seeds. I used chicken instead of beef and a simple frying pan, worked well for me.
Very hard to mess up (I'm not a very good cook).
Serving size is accurate for a normal human being and didn't leave me with days of leftovers, I like that.
Thanks for the recipe! :)

Delicious.  Used one of the suggestions for Thai Chili Sauce.  No broccoli, so used asparagus, and zucchini.  Only other slight addition - red onion and garlic.  So quick and easy!!

Tried this recipe, but only changed most of the ingredients (don't you hate when someone does that?)  Used wok oil, garlic, white onion, celery, bell peppers, beef with some soy sauce, and tried some Thai chili dipping sauce, which you can add either to the wok or as served.  Very happy with the results, 5 stars for the slightly modified recipe :)
