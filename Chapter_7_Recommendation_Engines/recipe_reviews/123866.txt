Try using 16 oz. of pasta instead of 8 oz.  I have been making this recipe for about 10 years now and thought it was an original from a friend who used to own a local restaurant.  This recipe is to the "T" the same as mine - curious as to where this particular recipe came from.

One of my favorite pasta salads.  The only thing I do differently is I like to use spiral (rotell) pasta instead of tube pasta.

Did not use the onion which is a personal preference.  Added basil and a little bit more vinegar and salt as I thought it was a little sweet.  I also added cherry tomatoes from our garden. Would probably cut the sugar in half next time but we really enjoyed!

I love this salad and make it all the time, the only thing I do different is use 3/4 cup of oil and 16 oz of pasta and put everything except the pasta in the blender and blend smooth, then pour this over the pasta but it must sit overnight or it will be runny. YUM!

Excellent! Finally a good pasta salad without mayo and Italian dressing.  Next day servings are good and the cukes haven't turned into mush. The next time I make this I will add cherry tomatoes.

This was very tasty, but we kept eating the cucumbers and leaving the noodles. I think next time I will 1/2 the dressing, eliminate the noodles, and use 2 more cucumbers.

good base salad!  I used 16 oz pasta cooked. NO water in the dressing- I used some olive oil instead, about 1/4 cup. Used dill instead of parsel, and put the vinegar, spices/herbs, sugar in a cup and used an immersion blender to mix it up as I drizzled in the oil.  I used scallion instead of onion, and added some freshly grated carrot for color and some thinly sliced celery for additional crunch.  really good, and the MUCH MUCH MUCH needed break from mayo based and italian dressing based pasta salads.

Delicious! I used a cup of vinegar instead of 3/4 cup and added another cucumber dill and used 16 oz of pasta. I also threw in a spoonfull of mayo.
When the tomatoes are ready in the garden I will add some of those too! This is so refreshing! Will be making this again!

The recipe was too sweet for my family. 1.5 cups of sugar is too much. It was also very runny. I would use less water.  I used 16 oz pasta as another reviewer suggested, and there was still way too much sauce. I seeded and diced my cukes, so I added 2 more. With a little tweaking, this could be a much better recipe.  As written, I can only give it 2 stars.

I made this for an outdoor graduation party; it was a hit.  This is a very simple recipe to prepare.  I used one seedless cuke instead of two medium.  The pasta salad held up well in the hot weather.  I will be making this one again, very easy and delicious!

This is one of my favorite salads......I've been asked for the recipe everytime I've served it to someone new.  I like fresh parsley or dill better and vary the pasta to whatever I have on hand.  It is cool, refreshing and delicious!!!

This salad had really good flavor, but I didn't like the addition of the water to the sauce - it diluted it too much. Next time I make it I'll use a previous reviewer's suggestion to substitute oil instead.
