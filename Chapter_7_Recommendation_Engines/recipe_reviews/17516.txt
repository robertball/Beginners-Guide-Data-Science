Make this exactly as written and I promise you, you won't be disappointed. Use ALL the apples called for, bake about 65 minutes, and cover it the last 10 minutes or so with foil if it starts to get too brown. Those who say this has no flavor must not be using enough apples, which would surely change the taste and texture of this "cake." Just to dress it up, I drizzled it with a simple powdered sugar glaze. This is one darn good apple cake, densely apple-y and incredibly good. Sent it to the office with hubby and he reported his staff were all in apple heaven!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I subsituted a little.  I used a yellow cake mix but used a cream cheese instant pudding.  I also used apple pie filling instead of just apples and also subsituted brown sugar instead of regular sugar and used pecans instead of walnuts.  Great warmned up with a scoop of vanilla icecream!

Definitely a good cake. The amount of apples called for in the recipe is excessive, though. It needs only about 4 apples, and that would be plenty. However, it is very time-consuming to prepare, it takes a long time to bake and then has to sit for half an hour before being ready to be removed from the pan. A time-killer of a recipe, and for this reason I wouldn't make ir again.

I made this recipe with 4 sliced peaches instead of  apples. I also baked it for about 45 min. in a 13x9 pan instead of a bundt pan. Delicious!

Great recipe.  I use light sour cream and 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce (2 with 1 tablespoon oil) instead of 1/2 of vegetable oil.

The family really enjoyed this one.  I made the following changes:  I coarsely diced 4 granny smith apples, and mixed them, along with 1 1/2 tsp apple pie spice in with the batter.  I also diced (more finely) 1 1/2 macintosh apples and mixed them in with the nut/sugar mixture.  I substituted 1/2 c brown sugar for the white sugar, and I added 1 tsp of apple pie spice with the cinnamon.  Also, I only had sugar-free pudding mix, but it turned out fine.  This is a very moist coffee cake.  It filled the bundt pan pretty full, but it didn't rise as much as a regular cake, so it didn't overflow.  I did worry that the batter was so thick, but it wasn't TOO dense.  I can't imagine putting ALL of the apples in with the filling layer.  As it was, the cake kind of falls apart at the center layer when you go to cut it.  With all of the apples in the center, you'd have nothing holding it together at all.

I would call this an apple cake, not a coffee cake. I was concerned about how thick the batter was found it difficult to layer.  Next time I will chop the apples into smaller pieces, coat them in the sugar/cinnamon, and mix them in the batter.

Very tasty for a cake that starts with a mix, and easy to make. To avoid the problem of slices falling apart, I made mine in a 9x13 pan.  All ingredients are the same (although I chopped the apples, and mixed them with the sugar/cinnamon/ nut mixture), just spread about 2/3 of the batter in the greased pan, top with the apples (pressing down), then drop spoonfuls of the remaining batter all over the apples and spread as best you can.  Bake till the knife comes out clean, and you WILL need to cover it with foil to keep it from burning.

Very easy to make!  I did cut back on the number of apples, but next time I think I'll add the full amount.  Very well received by friends and family.  Definitely a make-again recipe!

This cake was fantastic - I had a housefull of guests and needed something I could make in advance.  I even used apples off the tree in my own backyard.  Everyone LOVED it - it's quite easy to make.  We had it for breakfast one day, and then later that night with ice cream.

Delicious...And it does NOT taste like it came from a box..though, for the life of me, why would it matter if it did, you can never go wrong with a boxed cake in my opinion, have had cakes made from scratch that tasted like cardboard and were dense.  Anyhow, moving on..this cake, is wonderful..Upon reading many reviews, I decided to chop the apples, rather than slice..and it DOES  not say to put all apples in the center, it says to put half on the first layer, then the rest at the end.  When I did it this way, many from the first layer floated toward the top, the ones at the end floated to the middle..I found they were very nicely dispersed when I sliced..Drizzled with a nice glaze..perfect!

Those of you who said it came out mushy, only use three larger apples rather than six apples. I used three and I just want to say WOW!!!! Also, you dont want to just slice them, you want to chop them in to small cube like pieces. it spreads the flavor out more. This cake was fabulous. I baked it for 60 minutes, no more no less and it was perfect. Some people said it wasn't like coffee cake, but mine turned out tasting just like one. That is why it is important to add the apples to the whole mixture instead of layering and just top with the cinnamon/nut mixture on top. I highly recommend this cake. It was easy and deeeelish!

My co-workers LOVED this!  I replaced the nuts with oatmeal (we have a nut allergy) and used canned apples (not pie filling) to save some time.  It was fantastic, even made a few of the guys swear, and one kissed my hand!

I have made this recipe several times and always get compliments.  The recipe has been requested and shared with co-workers and friends. It becomes even more moist if served a day later.  I highly recommend.

Fabulous! And, as the title states - EASY! You'd never know that the base was a cake mix. I used a french vanilla cake mix and french vanilla pudding mix along with a generous splash of vanilla extract to be sure the cake mix flavor wouldn't come through. And while it did seem like a lot of apples - I'm glad I did use them all because it really made a difference. I tossed the apples in the cinnamon sugar mix along with the walnuts. This came out moist, nicely spiced and chock full of delicious apples. I opted to do a vanilla glaze over top to make it pretty and let it set in the fridge overnight. This was perfect to take over to my mother-in-law's house and was a big hit especially when you cut into it and there is a wonderful thick layer of apples sandwiched in between fluffy vanilla cake. Perfect with a cup of tea or coffee!

This was a very easy recipe to make.  It was too 'cake' like for me (duh, made out of cake mix...lol), but my hubby, the apple coffeecake lover loved it!  I made it on Thursday night, and by Saturday night it was history.  Even the plate was licked clean.  Next time I might add some nuts and chop the apples a little smaller.  USE THE FULL AMOUNT OF APPLES!  IT makes all the difference!

Excellent! Such a delicious and super moist cake. I added apple pie spice and also followed previous advice and mixed the apples with the cinnamon/sugar. I layered batter, apples, batter, apples and it was delicious. My mother couldn't believe it started with a box! I will absolutely make again and again!

I don't usually select recipes that require pre packaged cake mixes but am very happy I chose this one. I made exactly as the recipe indicated. It had the perfect amount of apples and the cinnamon and sugar blend was just right. It was enjoyed by all. I will certainly make it again.

This was great! These were the changesI made to it.  I added 3 eggs and 1/4 cup egg beaters . I also added 6 oz vanilla yogurt and 4 oz applesauce and 1/4 oil  (in place of the sour cream and oil). This was the best apple cake I ever had. I will be making this for Thanksgiving.

This cake had a great flavor.  I read the reviews before I made it, and used chopped apples instead of sliced. I was out of sour cream and had to use a vinegar and cream substitute, and the batter had a more bitter flavor than I would have liked so I added about a teaspoon of vanilla.  Next time, I will mix the apples, sugar, and cinnamon, then add to the batter, and maybe even try it in a 9X13" pan.  It stuck just a little to my bundt pan.  We really loved the flavor though.  I will definately make this easy recipe again!

Wow - this was great! Very easy, moist but not soggy. I used three average-sized Granny Smith apples. There was plenty of apple filling and if I added any more, I think the batter would have run over the sides when it baked. Does not need any kind of glaze - just sprinkle with powdered sugar for a pretty presentation.

I made this for a work function (not mine, the hubby's...that work stuff is for the birds :-)  And it looked sensational.  I used granny smith apples, and they were fairly large, so by the time I sliced up 4 it looked like more than enough, so 4 is what I used.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly minus the pudding mix, as the cake mix was "double pudding" and I heeded the warnings about soggy cake.  I did manage to sneak a taste where it wouldn't be noticed, and it was excellent, tangy, soft, and moist.  The perfect companion for a good cup of coffee!

Not my favorite apple cake. I have a much better recipe from scratch I have been making for years. I made this for a sunday night dinner, I needed something fast and easy. It got mixed reviews - mostly that this cake tasted like a donut shop cake. My husband took the left overs to work and they went wild and could'nt stop eating. I'm not sure what to make of this cake. I found it far too sweet for my taste. I added skor/heath bar pieces (not with chocolate) to the top and it looked wonderful, melted beautifully.  Not a bad cake in a pinch I suppose, but I definately prefer scratch.

Yummmmmm!!!!  Easy, and smells like heaven as it bakes.  I used 4 Golden Delicious apples, and pecans instead of walnuts.  I will make this often!

This is an excellent recipe. My only problem with making this was the yellow cake box mix and the instant pudding mix. The recipe calls for a yellow cake box mix that weighs 18.25 ounces. However, these mixes now weigh 15.25 ounces and you can notice the missing 3 ounces when finishing the recipe. Next time, I will use a yellow cake from scratch recipe (30 minute yellow cake recipe looks good) and a vanilla pudding recipe (there is a recipe for vanilla pudding that has the same basic ingredients as an instant mix).  Finally, I found that our bundt pan was missing when ready to pour the batter. I substituted a 9 x 14 pyrex dish and the coffee cake came out fine. I will definitely make this again.

I just made this cake this weekend and it was absolutely delicious.  As I didn't have yellow cake mix on hand I used a white one.  I also only had low fat sour cream on hand and used it.  I used 6 large spy apples.  I baked it for 78 minutes.  Cake is moist and really yummy.  Thanks for the reccipe.

I have made this twice in the past two weeks due to an overflow of apples from the yard this year!  The first time I made it for my husband to bring for breakfast on a guys camping trip.  When he came home he told me that it never made it to breakfast, they enjoyed it after dinner!  They all loved it!  I made it yesterday and topped with a thin, caramel frosting and we enjoyed it for dessert.  I substituted the oil with homemade applesauce and I made two layers of apples!  I am sure I will make this again!

The cake was so simple and easy to make. At first I thought the 1 cup of walnuts and 3/4 cup sugar would be too much but it was perfect. It turned out great the first time when I followed the recipe but the second time around  I poured half the batter into the pan and then layered  a thinly sliced granny smith apple and covered it with rest of the batter. I also added some more butter to the topping. Absolutely yummy!!

I made this last night for work today... it is very moist and flavorful - it went quickly (great with coffee).  I added a little pumpkin pie spice to the walnut mixture for some extra flavor. While this cake was very good, I personally prefer apples through out the entire cake vs. in layers.

This was WONDERFUL! It was so simple my 6 year old daughter was able to make the whole cake practically by herself! She used an apple wedge slicer to slice the apples and then I cut the wedges in half to make them the perfect thickness. What a big hit when she presented Grandpa with this delicious cake that she made!!!! Even the crumbs were eaten!

This is excellent.  Made my first one and shared it with family and friends.  It is very moist and extremely delicious!  A great cake to take to church socials, reunions, etc. I will definitely make this one over and over.  Wonderful for those cold Winter mornings.

Very good and easy to make.  Recipe directions mention walnuts, but they are not listed in contents.  For additional flavor, I then poured the butter sauce recipe from "apple cake and butter sauce" over the coffee cake slices--YUM!

It came out great. The only thing I changed was to cut the apples into small pieces & include in the batter so it’s easier to cut & eat. It’s a real keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

Awesome cake. My family really enjoyed this cake. I didn't think it was going to amount to much because the batter was quite stiff and hard to spread into the pan. I also only used three large apples because that's all I had. Although it was very good I would use the recommended amount of apples next time. Great for snack of breakfast with a cup of coffee.

I made this in a 9x13 and used a spice cake instead of yellow.  Because of that I didn't make the topping (I was using Fuji apples and it didn't need more sugar either).  The apples from my tree were big--I mean, REALLY big--so I just used two big ones and a little one.  I chopped them up, as others suggested, and mixed them into the batter.  I almost had more apples than batter!  I used the rest of the ingredients as stated and it turned out WONDERFUL!  I did have to cover it with foil to keep it from browning too much on top.  The cake is denser than cake mix cakes usually are which I really liked.  It is not quite as dense as a regular coffee cake, in my opinion.  But still yummy!  It is just the right amount of sweet.  If you are not using tart apples I can't imagine adding more sugar to this than what the cake mix and pudding already have.

Wonderful! My favorite fall dessert! This is what I changed:

1.Added about a teaspoon to the batter

2.Toasted Pecans

3.Used about 1/4-1/2 cup of condensed milk after about 45-50 minutes of baking so the apples didn't get too brown

Used 7 fuji apples since I'm a big fan of them.  Also, I just sprinkled the walnuts on top so they could be removed by those who do not like nuts.

I made this recipe twice in one day. I tried some of the modifications suggested on the first one: using applesauce in place of eggs/oil, using 3 apples, coating the apples with the mixture and stirring them into the batter - it didn't turn out well at all. I was very disappointed. On the second attempt, I made it closer to the recipe, with just a few minor changes: I used only 2 large apples and spread it in a big rectangular baking dish. I layered the apple mix which worked a lot  better than stirring it into the batter, but I did still coat the apples with the cinnamon sugar mix. I still had to bake it for almost 90 min. and it turned out perfect, moist and very delicious. I did add a glaze topping once it cooled, which made it even better. I brought it to an outing and everyone loved it. I'm glad I gave it a second chance. It's definitely worth making again.

YUMMY IN YOUR TUMMY! YES I'M SHOUTING! This was soooo good & easy! More time peeling & cutting than making the recipe. I finely chopped 1 of the apples & stirred it into the batter. I did use someones suggestion and stirred sugar and nuts into the fruit just before assembling batter and apples. If you sugar too soon; the fruit will weep and make a lot of liquid. This was moist and dense. I wanted to serve it as a dessert so I made whip cream and served it with some sliced apples as presentation. My coffee crew just loved it & I will be printing several recipes requests this afternoon!

I read other reviews and decided to use less apples.  I like to use measurements as some apples are bigger or smaller especially if you've picked them yourself!!!  I used 2 cups of apples and for myself, I found that to be the right amount. Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I thought the cake was delicious.

Absolutely amazing! Adding to my regular rotation! I made twice...first time followed recipe exactly substituting butter cake mix for yellow. Second time I ommitted walnuts and mixed apples with cin/sugar before layering all in the center. Reason for 4 stars is that both times the cakes were structurally a mess. 2nd time was much better. Made sure not to overmix batter as pudding starts to set which leaves space in the cake as apples start to cook down,  Overall amazingly simple and out of this world flavor. Will continue to play with until I get the structure just right!

A nice dessert that everyone must have enjoyed as there is none left. I followed the directions as written, using granny smith apples. Good apple cinnamon taste. It does fall apart in the middle where the apples are when sliced. No one seemed to mind though!

Success! Everyone at the office wanted more. I made this loaf style: it made two loaves. I followed the directions exactly as written. I did have to cover the top with foil to prevent burning. But that's because I used loaf pans. The name said it all. Will make again.

This cake came out beautiful...I didn't alter the recipe too much other than adding cinnamon into the cake batter.  I also used a bundt pan and drizzled a cream cheese glaze.  I then made a caramel apple and placed it in the middle and sprinkled everything with a little more cinnamon....It not ONLY looked great but tasted wonderful too!

The coffee cake is delicious and it was very easy to make.  The cake was very moist and my co workers loved it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very good cake...apple pie = cake style. I agree with reviewer "MWINTEROD" who stated this cake needs a longer baking time as mine too was a little soggy in places but great just the same. Looked great, smelled great while baking and everyone in my family thought it tasted pretty darn good. It was even better the next day (and equally good warmed in the mircowave for a few sec and then a small scoop of vanilla ice cream!). Thanks for posting!

Great-tasting "doctored" cake.  I agree with another reviewer who said this would be good any time of the day.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.  Glad you shared your recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  Took it to church & it was devoured.  I substituted brown sugar for the white and the next time I make it, I'll start with the 1/2 of the apple mixture then 1/2 cake mixture so that no one loses their apples from the bottom.

This is a fabulous cake!!!!!!!!!!!! Believe me I am a picky person and expect wonderfulness LOL. I had a caramel cake mix and caramel pudding so I used that. I substituted melted butter for the oil and brown sugar for the white and pecans for the walnuts. I made a caramel drizzle by melting 1.4 cup butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar and a tsp. of sour cream, brought to a boil, let thicken a bit. Drizzled it over the cooled cake. Hubby said this was the best yet!

Easy and tasty! I made it in a 9 x 13 pan to make it more like a snacking cake.  Added a tablespoon of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the batter for a little extra cinnamon flavor.  It came out great!

Made this as directed except for using pecans because that's what I had on hand.  This is a delicious and moist cake!  Mine needed the full 70 minutes and came out perfect.  My husband gave this an easy 10 which is saying a lot because he doesn't just hand out 10's!

Everyone at work absolutely loved it. I substitute applesauce for the oil. I didn't have walnuts though. I did add simple icing to the top and made it in a regular cake pan. Kept the skin on the apples because it is more fiber and less work.

Pretty tasty cake. The apples made the inside a bit soggy, even after I baked it for 15 min. longer than the recipe states, so I'd suggest cutting down just a bit.

How wonderful!  I took this to work for a morning meeting (without even trying it first).  So, at the 11th hour, I made changes -- but minor.  I used 4 golden and 2 granny smith apples.  Used a 9x13 pan and mixed the spices and apples.  Used the vegetable oil as directed, but a healthier version would have been applesauce, so go ahead and try it.  Spreading the cake batter was a bit difficult, but don't stress . . . a few drops of liquid will help that.  I baked a bit longer and put foil over the top during the last few minutes.  I used the full 70 minutes.  Didn't do a glaze topping, but it was so sweet (but in a good, morning coffee way!), I could have cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Next time I will.  Your co-workers will very much appreciate you!

I shouldn't be giving THIS recipe a rating because what I ended up with wasn't even the same cake.  But I am giving Carol's recipe 5 stars for the inspiration. I had to make something for a family get together and I had two cake mixes in the pantry.  Duncan Hines Spice cake and Banana cake mixes but I didn't want to take just a plain cake with me - So, I used Carol's recipe as a jumping off point and adapted it based on what I had in the house.   Banana cake mix instead of yellow, 4 bananas instead of apples, whole milk ricotta instead of  sour cream, and since ricotta is so much thicker than sour cream I also added 1/4 cup of coconut rum. It baked for 90 minutes and it came out golden and moist - I glazed it with another 1/4 cup coconut rum and 1/4 cup powdered sugar. It came out moist, Delicious and OMG decadent! Thanks for the inspiratioin Carol!

i just took this cake out of the oven and it is delicious! i followed the recipe pretty much "as written" with only a few changes because of the country in which i live: since one can't get sour cream here, i substituted low-fat, plain yogurt that i had drained a little beforehand...probably doing that cut out A LOT of fat grams too! also, since i didn't have a bundt pan, i baked it in a 9x13.  since italians like their cakes a little on the "dry side", i baked it for about 1.5 hours at 350 and it didn't burn. (my oven is tiny and LAME!) like another reviewer suggested, i finely chopped the apples and i did use all 6 (of various sizes) with no problems.  other than those few changes i thought it was a GREAT recipe! ***the one thing i would recommend is to have all your ingredients ready BEFORE you start mixing the batter. i waited too long (chopping the apples) and had a lot of difficulty spreading the batter in the pan. the pudding makes it very thick.***

I even burnt this cake and it was STILL DELISH! It was the easiest thing I could ever make. EVERYONE loved it! I just made it this past Saturday and it took minutes. The hardest part was cutting the apples into thin slices. I increased the amount of cinnamon and walnuts. I think it needed a bit more. I cooked it less than 60 minutes... only because my oven is garbage and it started to burn it!! (it's electric and very old) I HIGHLY recommend this recipe! It's a yummy harvest recipe!!! Great for Thanksgiving and Fall!!

This recipe is the best coffee cake recipe i have ever had!!  It is extremely easy to make.  I changed a couple things though.  I used extra brown sugar and cinnamon and coated the apples in it before adding it to the bundt pan/mix.  I also dripped honey onto the cake when it came out of the oven along with a glaze made up of confectioners sugar, vanilla and water.  This coffee cake was incredible and i will definitely make again and again!

Great recipe, everyone enjoyed it. Only change I made was to ude 4 apples unstead of 6, would have been to much for us. I placed apple slices around top of cake, had a beautiful pressentation, served with hot vanilla custard.

This cake TASTED delicious, but was an absolute mess to get out of the pan.  I think I used too many apples.  I know several people have commented that they used 6 apples with no problem, but is that 6 huge apples or 6 teeny-weeney apples?  An actual cup measurement of the quantity would improve this recipe a bit.  Thanks though - the surviving chunks of cake tasted awesome.  I will try again (just with fewer apples!)  :)

AMAZING AND EASY. Make exactly as recipe directs and use ALL the apples. I added 2 glazes.I drizzled a vanilla glaze made with 10-x, melted butter a bit of cream and vanilla over the cake then I drizzled caramel ice cream topping over that..WONDERFUL
MY CAKE DID NOT fall apart in the middle and I baked it about 65 minutes

Moist, taste and easy to make, but more of an apple cake than a coffee cake. I made mine topped with pecans.

A very moist, tasty cake.  I did use 6 Granny Smith apples, and I found it was perfect.  When I checked on the cake after 60 minutes, it was still very soft, so I baked an additional 10 minutes, only to find out later that the cake had started to burn.  I managed to scrape the very top off, and it tasted fine.  Next time I want to try it warm with the ice cream, but last night I just served it at room temperature.  Glad I tried it though.

This is the yummiest coffee cake I've ever tasted. Everyone in my family keeps asking me to make more of this and I've already given this recipe to several people I know. I did use less apples (about 4.5 cups of apples) and I used pecans. This is well worth the time to make.

This is very moist and good, I do not care for walnuts so I did not use them.  I made a vanilla glaze frosting to put on it instead and it was delicious.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I did follow everything in the recipe as stated except I put in more cinnamon and nuts.  I used pecans because those are my families favorites.   There were no leftovers from this cake so I will be make it again especially during apple season.

I made this twice. The first time I made it exactly as written and it was amazing. The second time, I chopped the apples and tossed them with the cinnamon mix and folded them into the batter. I made sure to fold loosely, not mix in thoroughly. I prefer the second method because it makes a slice that is easier to cut without falling apart and has a pretty swirl design. Either way is delicious though!

Ok. I think mixing the apple into the cake mix would have worked better than layering. I only used 5 apples, and this still seemed too much. Very time and labor intensive, considering the base was a cake mix. A recipe that starts from scratch would have produced a much tastier cake.

the cake was super moist yet the apples still had a nice crunch. It would say this is more of a cake rather than a coffee cake. Great dessert to serve with whipped topping.

I made this cake this morning. Since a cake mix was used, am I’m gluten free, I use a gluten free cake mix. The mix was too dense, so I added 3/4C of sugar free applesauce. Followed the recipe exactly. It took 1 1/2 hours  plus to bake (105 minutes)  it was perfect! Not too sweet. I did drizzle it with a glaze and add a few orange sprinkles for ‘presentation ‘! It was delicious. My son said next time  to add a Carmel drizzle. This was time consuming, but worth it.

This is a very moist and flavorful cake.  I made it using the Haralson apples I had frozen last year.  Instead of using vegetable or canola oil I used melted coconut oil.  If I make this again, I will use a 9x13 pan instead of a Bundt pan because when I tried to remove it from the pan just the bottom came out and I had to pry the top part out of the pan.  It's possible I didn't use enough shortening, although the pan itself is non-stick.  While it's not picture perfect, it still tastes great!

I would add another layer with more toasted pecans which is what I used.  My cake did not fall apart and came out of pan fine.  You can see where the layer is, its somewhat oozes out.

Oh wow!  This is amazing!  My entire family absolutely loved it.  I made the recipe exactly as written except used a 15.25 ounce box of cake mix as this is what I had on hand.  And I chopped the apples instead of slicing them.  I put in a 10 cup bundt pan and cooked for 70 minutes.  The apples sunk a little in some spots but no biggie.  Still came out fabulous!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks a million for the recipe!

This is excellent! So very simple and tasty. I used a French Vanilla cake mix because that's what I had on hand and I also did not add the instant pudding because I thought the French Vanilla cake would be what this cake needed. The rest of the ingredients I followed the recipe. This cake is yummy!! Just the right amount of apples for a nice flavor! You won't be disappointed! Thank you for the recipe!

Used a lemon cake mix and instant coconut pudding mix.  Nice taste and consistency.  Used six apples.  Next time Iwould slice the apples  slices in half and put some of the dough as the last layer

I made it with all the correct amount of ingredients but chopped the apples as suggested and mixed them into the batter. Nice cake especially in the fall when we have lots of apples.

Oh, boy! This cake is delish. I left out the walnuts and added a glaze. First bundt cake I've made and I have to say I'm thoroughly pleased with the results. It really didn't need the glaze, it's sugar level is on point without it, so next time I probably won't add it. Thanks for the recipe,  i will definitely make this gem again!

I have this recipe minus the apples and I use this as my favorite cinnamon crumb coffee cake.  My recipe without the apples uses 2/3 cup sugar, but the rest is identical.  Mine bakes for 45 minutes because it does not need to cook the apples. Thanks for sharing so I can save in Allrecipes!

Had to share what I changed in case others are in my situation! I used a Pillsbury Classic Yellow (only 15.25 oz) and sugar free/fat free jello vanilla instant pudding mix (1 oz). I used Greek nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream. It was a very thick batter. I only used 2 large gala apples (I definitely could've added more). I only used half the sugar (sweet apples). I cooked in a ceramic bundt pan on convection in my Breville Smart Oven and it was perfect at 65 minutes (I covered the top with foil the last 20 minutes to keep from burning). This came out so well even with my modifications! Thank you!

I only used 4 apples (2 cubed per layer). Used a 9x13 and the only problem with this is that it doesn't spread easily so you really to make sure you have it split evenly for each layer. It's stick and gooey  so when you place the first layer in the pan, spoon it in then press it out to the edges when you layer the apples. I also, used not quite a 1/2 cup of white sugar and added brown plus more walnuts. I baked it the full 60 min as 40-50 the middle was pretty mushy. Turned out lovely and delicious !!

Made this for a dinner party. I had a bunch of apples that I needed to use. Read a lot of reviews and decided to grate the apples instead and mixed them with nuts & sugar. Followed directions and made the layers. I used pecans instead of walnuts.When I combined the apples with sugar mixture it got a little watery ( threw away watery part) so I sprinkled sugar and a few more pecans on top before baking. I sifted confectionery sugar on top after it cooled to make it look nice. Cover w foil after 60min. Baked another 10min . Apples baked into cake for a moist delicious dessert. Served w vanilla ice cream. Was a big hit! FYI used organic raw sugar. Don't be concerned that batter is so thick apples cooking in make this an awesome cake!

Made in a 9 x 13 pan and overcooked at 65 mins, had to scrape a layer of brown off the bottom. But still good and worth keeping, probably should start checking it at 45 mins. I chopped the apples and mixed with cinnamon nut mixture, added a little apple pie spice to both apple mix and batter. Put 2/3 batter, then apple mix then dolloped the rest of the batter on top. It was very good but a bit sweet. I would try cutting down the sugar with the apples a bit next time.

May just replace my MILs apple cake recipe.  :D  Delicious with the minor changes suggested from other reviewers:  1) Instead of 1/2 c. white sugar, I used 1/4 c. white and 1/4 c. brown; 2) Instead of 1/2 c. oil, I used 1/4 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. oil; 3) add powdered sugar glaze.   For the apples, I used 7 (smaller) apples from my tree which was 4 cups of coarsely chopped apples and that worked well.  I tossed the apples in the sugar/nut mixture and folded all of them into the batter.  This seemed to give an even distribution of apples through the cake.  The cake was baked through after 60 minutes and I did not need foil to prevent the cake from burning.

Last minute, had to make a Mother's Day dessert to go with coffee to take to my mom's. Well this recipe did NOT disappoint. I was super lazy and bought apple pie filling - I layered the slices of apple as the recipe says. I just took my tongs and picked out the apple slices from the can. Believe it or not it turned out fabulous! Super moist and so delicious. A crowd pleaser!

Just made this today and like many who have reviewed it, I chopped the apples and mixed them with the cinnamon and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I folded some of the apples into the batter and did thinner layers of apples throughout the cake batter ( batter, apple, batter, apple).  I also pressed the apple into the batter a bit. Maybe because of my newer gas oven, I didn't have to bake for the full 60 mins suggested.   A toothpick came out clean at approximately 45 mins. I sprinkled powered sugar and caramel sauce on the top for additional flavor and looks.  We haven't tried it yet, but if the smell is any indication,  my apple loving partner will adore it!

Awesome for breakfast or a snack with coffee or tea. This recipe really does not need six apples. Four or five will do. The cinnamon and crunchy apples makes this recipe spectacular!

SO moist and delicious!  Absolutely yummy and will definitely make it again.  It asks for a lot of apples - use them all!!!  It's super good and very very moist.  It's usually gone in 2 days at my house with requests to make it again.  It's just so good.

Texture waas not good & the cake split in half (where the apples were)  after cooling it for 35 minutes.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was that I sliced up "4 Big Apples" instead of "6 Regular Size Apples".   If I would've used 6 Big Apples, it would've fallen apart worse.   I always cook & love to do it, but I will not make this cake again.  --- PSC

I'm writing just to say what finally worked for me to keep this from sticking to pan & cracking. Let pan cool on a rack for ONLY 10-15 minutes. Then as precaution, I also went around edges & middle (Bundt pan). No cracks or sticking! Because I changed this, the rating doesn't accurately depict the original recipe. I used cream cheese instead of sour cream, cheesecake instant pudding instead of vanilla, used 4 c. of apple chunks & stirred them in & added 1 t. vanilla.

If you are looking for an easy recipe that is sure to impress your  guests..this is the one! I thought as I was making it that the batter was too gooey but it comes up perfect! Secret is to use granny smith apples for the tart/sweet effect. The sugar/cinnamon blend makes it really sweet and the apples compliment it well. The cake turns out exactly how it looks in the photo too, no joke! Like I said, this one is the cake to make if you looking for a delicious dessert that's easy to make (takes time peeling and slicing the apples, that's it) and looks as good as it tastes! As it cools place wax paper on the top and leave it over night. It falls out of the pan the next morning.

Goofed up and used five(5) eggs,3 sm. and 2 XL.,(4)apples,cooked 70 min, at 360 degrees.3 t of cinnamon. Banana cream pudding(4 1/2 oz).
Techniquely, I used approx 1/8 less oil and added 1/4 c. of applesauce. Would have used more but ran out of apple suace .  Finished with real nice crusted cake. Frosted with 4T. milk and 1 and 1/4  cup of powder sugar and 1/2 tsp of vanilla.   Wow ,very good. Stayed together good.

Very good!  On the sweet side, so only good for special occasions!  Very pretty, good for company.  I used Duncan Hines Butter flavor cake mix once, and pineapple cake mix another time.  Both were delicious!

I followed this recipe as instructed and it was moist, the apples were soft, and when I took half of it to my moms she begged for the recipe and made her own just this weekend with the same delicious results.  Next time I will cut the apples a little thicker because the texture was good but could have been better on those.

Loved this! Made a lemon glaze to put on top and it added another layer of flavor. Very moist and yummy, and easy to make!

I agree with some of the other reviews, this took a long time to bake.  I don't know if it's because I baked mine at 325 (I used a dark tube pan).  I changed a couple of things...I used a vanilla cake mix and sugar-free vanilla instant pudding.  I used 5 large Gala apples.  I read they are sweeter than Granny Smiths so I sliced them and mixed them with 1 TBL of  lemon juice and half a cup of white sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I layered the apples as directed and poured the juice from the apples on the top layer.  I had no problem getting the cake out of the pan and it didn't break when I flipped it over.  The true test will be when I cut the cake.  It smells so good, I can't wait to eat it!

The only change I made to this was to use 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  My husband does not really eat sweets but he LOVED this.  The batter did look a little too thick, but it turned out great.  For those saying that this won't hold together if you use all the apples called for, I did not experience that problem at all.  This is a fantastic recipe and I will definitely be making it again!

This is the best apple cake...ever!  I took this to a brunch for seniors at our church and everyone loved it...especially the seniors!  They all asked for the recipe.  No changes, just drizzled it lightly with a glaze.  Making it again for one of our desserts for Thanksgiving.

This was more like a bread pudding . . . perhaps I should have baked it longer, but the way I served it, it was more the consistency of a bread pudding.  I agree that it's an apple cake, more than a coffee cake.  The taste was pretty good, but not my preference.

This cake was very moist! Loved the flavor! I only used 2 granny smith apples and baked it for only 40 mins. I omitted the walnuts (because I did not have any) and used a lemon cake mix instead. I also used a vanilla and chocolate chip instant pudding mix (since that was all I had left). I would love to make this again with a different pudding mix and see how that would taste.

I easily could have used four or five apples, and the apples I used weren't big. I used Pink Ladies, they are delicious. Substituted pecans. Nice cake, easy, but tedious. Should have used mandolin slicer for apples.

Really delicious!  My only "warning" is that it took much longer to bake than what the recipe said(1/2 hr. longer)  Perhaps i need to check my oven temp, although i haven't had problems with other dishes, so hmmmmm....

This was a fun cake to make.  It tastes delicious!  I would recommend mixing apple pie filling with the sliced apples and let them sit for a bit before building the cake.  It seems like it's alot of apples, but it's not.  To the topping I drizzled caramel on top as well.  Don't over cook otherwise it will really dry out the cake.  Makes a great seasonal dessert!

I made this following the recipe exactly, and it is pretty good, but not a "Wow"ser.  It just tastes like a very moist cake with a couple layers of apples, cinnamon and sugar.  I'm not sure if I would make this again, there are so many other better coffee cake recipes.

I made this cake as directed and it baked up beautifully. However, when I sliced it, it fell apart in the middle where the layer of apples are. I did a little repair work and took it to work anyway, my co-workers raved! I will defintely make again with a little less apples this time.

5 stars for taste, but it was close to getting 4 stars for being very difficult to get out of the bundt pan. I buttered and flowered, but still it broke in the middle. Thankfully it tasted so good, no one cared that it was a little off kilter. With a bit of glaze on top it was hard for anyone to notice but me.

i used lactose-free sour cream. the batter was so thick, i had to add a little water just to get it into the pan! and the amount of sliced apples seemed way, way, too much, so i sliced up only a few apples and added all of the nut mixture to this layer in the middle of the cake. nevertheless, it was a huge hit at rosh hashunah. i will probably make it next year, too.

Everybody loved this cake, and I liked it alot, but it needs to cook way longer than the recipe says. My cake was pretty soggy in parts, but most people loved it and thought it was supposed to be that way. I may have screwed up by using a mix with pudding already in it and then adding more pudding - next time I will use regular mix or justr not add the pudding! I will make this again - my husband has eaten half of it in two days, so he's not complaining!

I made this cake for an Easter Brunch and everyone liked it.  The only problem I had was that I didn't use up all the 6 apples that was requested in the recipe.  I think I only used 2 or 3 so I'll have to make some thing else with my leftovers.  Otherwise, it was quick and easy!!!

This is my husbands all time favorite!  I have made about 10 of these in the span of 3 months, he just can't get enough!  Quick, easy and delicious!!
