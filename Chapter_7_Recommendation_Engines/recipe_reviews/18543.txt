Easy and delicious! Much better that the bottled stuff and comes together great in a pinch! I used Hellman's light mayo and opted out of using the green bell pepper as I didn't think it belonged. I added a splash of Worcestershire and a pinch of sugar. Just what I needed for "Big Cheeseburger Pizza" from this site.

This is fantastic! I left out the green pepper because I didn't have any, but this came out really good.  I'll never buy thousand island dressing again!

Couldn't see green bell pepper in this, so I substituted chopped onion and used sweet pickle relish.  It sat in the fridge overnight, and the flavors really did improve.  Thousand Island dressing is not one that we typically use on salads, but every now and then, we do like it.  I love being able to mix up just enough to use for one or two meals rather than buying a whole bottle and then having it sit in the fridge for six months.  We used this on reuben sandwiches, and it was REALLY good.  Used Duke's Real Mayonnaise, the South's best  :-)   One comment about the recipe description.  I used Heinz chili sauce, so there was nothing spicy about this.  Definitely a keeper.

We both enjoyed this twist, this variation, of Thousand Island Dressing.  The green pepper and pimento were interesting and unusual additions that contributed great flavor, texture and color.  Right after I prepared it I felt it was too mayonnaise-y so I added the same measure again of chili sauce, therefore doubling it.  After a few hours in the fridge the flavor had developed and melded and it was much improved. Hubs said he would have liked this either way - as written or as I ultimately served it, with double the chili sauce.  We had wedge salads with our entrees tonight and, while I enjoyed the traditional blue cheese dressing on mine, Hubs preferred this dressing on his. Fantastic complement to the Classic Wedge!

This is a great recipe!  You'll never buy that bottled stuff again.  I didn't add green peppers or pimentoes - didn't have them.  I did add more chile sauce and used sweet relish that I had made.  I may add some finely minced onions next time.  My Rueben sandwiches certainly tasted better with this on them!  YUM!

made this on the fly for a dinner guest . didnt have time to chill it long only about 20 minutes. this is crazy good and i dont eat thousand island on salads. i think this would be excellent on cheeseburgers as a burger sauce. i also like it doesnt use ketchup i just cant get my brain around ketchup on salad even if it is mixed with mayo. great recipe thank you!

Very tasty dressing, easier then some other recipes and if made with light mayo not especially unhealthy as well. Not too sweet as I often find Thousand Island, but I did use dill pickles instead of sweet. Instead of pimentos I used finely diced red bell pepper which has similar flavor and more economical.  I added onion and a splash of worcestershire. I thinned it with a bit of milk, just my preference. Loved it and will be a regular dressing for me.

I only needed a small amount of Thousand Island Dressing to use on 'Reuben Pizza' from AR.  This was perfect.  I cut the recipe back to get the amount I needed.  I had a small portion of poblano pepper left, so I used that in place of the minced green pepper. The dressing is nice and creamy, but loaded with flavor.  I wouldn't hesitate to use this recipe again.

I love the green peppers and Pimento together. This is an excellent recipe.
