Great Recipe! I made this for 40 people, and it was a hit! The only thing I did differently was use 1/2 chicken broth, 1/2 water to cut down on the salt a bit.

This was very yummy, especially with the addition of a chopped jalapeno!  Making the Quinoa I substituted olive oil for butter, used water and 1 tsp kosher salt. I needed to make ahead so I used a different technique; cooked quinoa and refrigerated overnight in a separate bowl by itself; then chopped all the vegetables except cilantro, added a chopped jalapeno, used fresh cooked corn off the cobb, mixed in a bowl set aside. Then made a dressing with the lime juice, vinegar, olive oil and adobo seasoning (I made my own seasoning; does not contain salt or MSG); tossed with vegetable mix; tossed in the drained and rinsed beans and marinated mixture over night. The next morning; chopped the cilantro; gently folded with the vegetables; then folded in the quinoa; put back in refridgerator. Just before serving gently folded in the feta cheese and garnished with whole cilantro leaves. Did not use any extra salt; except when cooking quinoa. The cheese is very salty, no need to add extra. The day after my party I added left over cut up grilled chicken to the left over salad. Even my meat and potatoes husband LOVED it!

I made using Kashi pilaf and didn't use chicken broth and I thought this was great.  Making it for lunch.  I didn't have adobo so looked up recipe for it and made it from scratch.

This is a keeper and will go into my regular rotation.  BEWARE - start with less lime and then adjust the dressing a little at a time.  I did use olive oil instead of butter and diced red and yellow peppers.   Some people were a little leary of this salad but those that tried it, loved it.

Loved this salad! I didn't have adobo, so I made my own (garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, cayenne). I didn't have a tomato on hand, but it was great w/out it!

So easy and tasty. I used red quinoa which makes the presentation very beautiful. I omitted the cheese, but added in a fresh jalapeno to my sautee mix. Finally, I made a wrap with the quinoa salad- a warm whole wheat tortilla with some pepper jack cheese and avocado. A great lunch!

My husband requested this salad as a side to go with mesquite grilled chicken and zucchini. Obviously, it made quite an impression  on him, which is a compliment to the author of this recipe! I have only made it one time months ago but HE remembered it. Made per the recipe, FANTASTIC!

Originally, I was searching for a vegetarian dish with quinoa. Although this recipe including chicken broth, I made it without and thought the quinoa still turned out well.  Next time, I would definitely add another tomato.

Great recipe! 

I used the whole amount of lime juice and did not have adobo seasoning, so I added cumin, garlic powder and paprika- very good! I will absolutely make this one again.

This recipe is amazing and you must try.  I also used adobo recipe on site ....always good to know whats in your stuff!  Quinoa is a complete amino acid and gluten free food and this recipe really brings out the best in it.  I added feta to each serving and some fresh avocado and another squeeze of lime.  So refreshing and YUM>  It makes a lot.  PS  I used frozen organic corn as I am a corn snob!

Love this.  I didn't have green pepper or cilantro on hand so left them out.  Followed the recipe other than that.  Great flavor.  Was looking for something I could take in my lunch.  This will be a favorite.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Great salad, light and summery.  Love quinoa, my only complaint is I thought it was too limey.  next time I will cut back on the lime juice and maybe add some cumin!

Ok....this could have been a 5++++ for me.....but....I. was so overwhelmed by the adobo seasoning.  I have never used it before so had no idea what to expect.  Instinct told me to use half of the amount ....but i used the full tablspn and it was too salty.  Especially with the feta.  Next time I will omit completely.  This a great and fresh salad and I loved it aside from the too saltiness. I added some cumin, a can of mexicorn, cherry tomatoes, and an amazing avacado. Love the freshness off the cilantro and lime. Will most definitely make again but omit the adobo. Thanks!

Loved it! I added no salt though it still seemed a tiny bit salty.   Next time I will use maybe half or at least   less adobo seasoning.

Exactly what I was looking for! All of my favorite flavors. I also added edamame and avacado. I made my own adobo from a recipe on this sight and the finished product was not too salty. just right. (I didn't use chicken broth, but water instead and rinsed the beans thoroughly..that helped reduce the salt)
Thanks!!

Delicious!  I can't eat cheese, so I left out the feta and it was still wonderful.  I took to a potluck and everyone wanted the recipe.

Very yummy & healthy!  We didn't have adobo or feta on hand but will try that next time.  I didn't use all of the lime juice that it called for, I added it last to taste.  We love quinoa and will definitely be making this easy recipe again.

All I could taste was the lime, and I only used 2/3 of what the recipe called for.  I didn't see one reviewer's note about using a third if using bottled lime juice until the deed was done.  Aside from that, the quinoa grain is so small that I thought it didn't stay nice and separated ... Kind of mushy.  Maybe I'd like better within couscous instead.  Probably wont try it again.

I loved this- with some changes....I added a dash of balsamic vinegar and garlic powder to the quinoa as it cooked. I used  a red pepper, orange pepper, red onion as my veggies. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and omitted the olive oil. I combined all of the ingredients (except feta cheese) with the balsamic vinegar/lime juice and let it sit overnight. Just before I served the salad I added the feta cheese and two ripe avocados (I chose to leave out the cilantro). Added the juice of one more lime, another dash of balsamic and it was good to go. It was excellent! I think letting the salad sit for awhile (overnight) is important for the flavor. I will definitely make it again!

Holy Moly this is good!  I also added some chunks of avocado just because I love it!  It had so much flavor I just couldn't stop eating it!  My husband loved it too.  I served it with adobo seasoned, pan seared chicken breasts.  YUM!  Thanks for introducing me to one of my new favorite foods!

As a self-proclaimed quinoa salad addict, I can say this salad is absolutely delicious! I made up a batch of Traci's gAdobo Seasoning and had to sub dried cilantro and canned fire-roasted tomatoes, so I can only imagine how much better this salad would've tasted with all fresh ingredients.  I diced up a fresh avocado, squeezed extra lime, and I was in heaven! DH thought it was "meh" and DD ate her portion without a fuss.  I am looking forward to leftovers, as well as making this again!

I didn't include about half of the ingredients, but it was still absolutely delicious! I used quinoa, chicken broth, black beans, red onion, bell peppers, cilantro, 1 lime & 1/2 lemon, salt & red pepper flakes to top it off. I made a meal that will last me at-least a few days. :D 

Thank you so much for the recipe! :*

My Family LOVED this dish! I used 1/2 cup regular quinoa & 1/2 cup red quinoa and cooked it with vegetable broth and substituted vegan butter. (We have a vegan in our family.) I added 2 minced jalapenos, cut the lime juice down to 5 Tbsp, added 1 1/4 tsp Cumin, added 1/4 minced yellow and orange peppers, substituted grape tomatoes cut in half, & and omitted adobo seasoning.  I served it with 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese on side (for our vegan family member).  I did mix the dressing separately and then added to veggies/beans/quinoa.  When I went to get some the next day, it was all gone!

I made the recipe as written - using the adobo seasoning recipe on this site.  Everyone loved it.  I had to make a second batch because my son ate all the left overs before anyone else could have some.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

This wonderful recipe has been a hit absolutely everywhere I've served it.  I even introduced my family in Texas to quinoa using this recipe... they'd never heard of it before this!  Served hot or cold it's been enjoyed by every adult who's tasted it.  :)

I loved the flavor of this recipe! The feta was a fun addition, too. However, I'm only rating the recipe with four stars because of the instructions. It is necessary to COVER the quinoa while cooking. Besides that, I enjoyed the recipe.

I didn't give this a 5 because it is much too salty. I used 1 c. broth and 1 c. water. I would also recommend using 1/2 - 1 teaspoon Adobo - or omit it altogether. The feta contains enough salt to flavor the whole salad. I would also cut back on the lime. With the vinegar, it's a bit overpowering. I LOVE the flavors of this salad though. Just a little tweaking is necessary.

Delicious!!! I didn't even have adoba seasoning and it still turned out fantastic...just like the black bean and quinoa salad they make at Whole Foods but better. I used orange pepper instead of green. Can't wait to make this again.

Quinoa is actually a seed, when the tail is sprouted instead of cooked out, it can be almost a completely raw salad. But cooked is great too, being that it is a seed and not a grain, most people have no allergic reaction to it and it's gluten free!

Really enjoyed this salad. I made it with low sodium chicken stock and I used the adobo seasoning recipe from this site. When I made the seasoning I didn't add the salt in that recipe as I like to watch my sodium intake and let others adjust to their liking. I only had white wine vinegar as well so used that but all other instructions were kept. Will definitely make again.

Spectacular summer salad! Very fresh and healthful. I doubled the recipe and it worked well, except I did not double the lime juice. I could not find adobo seasoning, however, I used some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and fine chopped 2 TBSP. Fresh corn works very well and I also rinsed the black beans. I can't wait to share with friends this weekend during girl's weekend! Bringing chips to dip.

Awesome summer or potluck dish that takes a bit of time to put together but gets many compliments.  I left out feta cheese and still everyone loved it... tastes just like taco salad but with no meat (even meat lovers gave high praise). Would highly recommend =)

Yummy!  I agree with the other reviews - half water and half chicken stock.  Also, I would crumble the feta very, very small.

I brought this to a pool party and got a lot of compliments. Since it's not mayo based, it was a safer salad to bring on a hot day.   Made the recipe as directed using low sodium chicken broth and adobo seasoning from scratch.

Didn't like it at all. It was way too salty. I bought the Goya Adobo All Purpose Seasoning and added 1 tbsp as suggested in the recipe, and it completely ruined the dish. It added no flavor to the dish, just salt. Next time I make a salad like this, I'll just use a little bit of chipotle.

was a big hit, used water instead of chicken broth, chick peas instead of corn, parsley instead of cilantro, also looked up Adobo seasoning and made from scratch. Had no lime or feta cheese - still delicious!!

Absolutely amazing! Made the recipe exactly besides leaving out the feta cheese since I'm pregnant. Made the abodo from scratch from the recipe on this site. Diced up jalepino to add to the bowl.

Absolutely love this salad and could eat it everyday! It tastes extremely fresh and I love the addition of the feta. Only suggestions would be to add 1/2 a fresh jalapeno if you want some heat. 5 star recipe!

Very yummy side dish. I reduced the amount of lime juice by half and added yellow and orange peppers instead of green bell pepper. It was a hit at a family get together.

This is phenomenal!!  I used tri-color quinoa since that's what I had, but everything else remained as written.  This is fresh, healthy, and a great way to get lots of vegetables with a great punch of flavor.  We ate this as a main dish and will have it often.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum!  I just had this for lunch and it was excellent.  I followed the recipe except left out the butter to reduce fat and left out the corn because I was out of it and didn't want to run to the store.  I have saved this recipe and will be making it again.  Thank you Texas7127 for sharing your wonderful recipe.

Only 4 stars because I used this as a jumping off point. I had a box of Near East Quinoa blend roasted red pepper & basil that I wanted to use up and this inspired me. Didn't use as much oil in the dressing or the broth/butter in prep of quinoa and used mozzarella cheese in place of the feta. Also made own adobo seasoning. Ate as a side dish scooped with tortilla chips. I loved it and so did my husband. Thanks!

This recipe is excellent!  I made it to bring for lunches during the week and added diced avocado and turkey to the top of it in order to make it a main dish.  It lasted in the refrigerator for the whole week and I looked forward to eating it, which says a lot since I also love eating out for lunch.  Adding the avocado and turkey breast is not necessary - the recipe is great without it.  It tastes fresh and is packed with flavor.  The recipe will be regularly made in my household and has already been passed along to inquiring co-workers!

FANTASTIC!  I followed the recipe for the most part, except I omitted the bell pepper.  The adobo seasoning (I made my own) really adds flavor.  I dont see the point in toasting the quinoa so I just cooked it the "regular" way.  I used lemon juice instead of lime juice because that is what I had. I served it warm/room temp.

this is amazing!  I will be making this often.  I made this exactly as written...the only thing i will do differently next time is use 1C chicken broth and 1 C water...no need to add additional salt.  There was plenty of salt between the broth & Adobo seasoning.

If you use bottled lime juice, cut the amount down to about a third of what is called for (I cut it to a quarter cup and it is still quite sour).  Also, use another reviewer's suggestion of cooking the quinoa in half stock/half water - mine got quite salty after cooking in the chicken broth.

This is so healthy and good! Used hominy instead of corn . Didn't add feta and don't miss it. Will make it again & again.!

This was my first time trying quinoa. I found the whole prep process easy. I took into consideration previous reviews and made sure that I used low sodium chicken broth. Since I didn't have adobe seasoning, I made my own and found that that might be where the extra salty taste some reviewers complained of, came from. When cooking the quinoa, I added some minced garlic and some of the onions, for extra flavor, and added the remainder of the onions raw with the salad ingredients. This is a very versatile recipe -- one that we will often.

Made this tonight for the first time.  My hubby loved it and I thought it was a great way to use summer veggies. I didn't use chicken broth just water.  I also made my own adobe seasoning.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very tasty, but way too salty. Next time I'm going to make my own adobo seasoning instead of using Goya's. That way I can control the amount of salt.

Really yummy.  I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth to keep it vegetarian and made my own adobo seasoning to control the salt content.  Will add another tomato.

This salad is absolutely wonderful. I made mine veg friendly by cooking the quinoa in veg broth. I also added avocado which was awesome. The salad kept for days after and got better with time. A must try!

This was very flavorful, thanks to the adobo. I used olive oil, veg broth, and about half the lime juice. I omitted the feta and it was fine without, though I'd have subbed cotija if I could have found it. I also served it topped with green hot sauce for an extra kick.

Wow! This was even better than I thought it'd be. The only thing I did differently was added some sliced avocado. I couldn't find adobo seasoning, so I looked it up on Allrecipes and sprinkled its ingredients over the top. Delicious!

Have made this multiple times!!  Absolutely LOVE it!  You can add jalapeno to taste, and avocado to make it more festive!  We omit the cheese and never even know it's gone!  This is a MUST to have in the fridge as a snack or a quick meal!  YUM!

I don't often leave reviews,  but this has become a favorite of my daughter and myself.   the only change is that I use Trader Joe's Chile Lime Seasoning Blend in place of the adobo seasoning. This is great for meal prepping a it lasts a few days in the fridge.

This is a great salad, and I made only a few changes. I cooked four fresh corn on the cob as it is corn season now in Ontario, and I added all the kernels off the cobs. I also added about 1tbsp extra adobo seasoning, which I made myself. Here is the recipe I used for adobo seasoning:
READY IN: 10mins
YIELD: 7 Tablespoons	UNITS: US
INGREDIENTS Nutrition
2 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon chili powder

I also added avocado and closer to 1/2 cup cilantro. I would definitely make this again with the changes I made! Also, I've found adobo seasoning is great for other things too, like southwestern omelets!

My co-worker made this and it was delicious!  I made it and it tasted different...way too much lime nice!  You need to use real lime don't sub with Lime juice in bottle makes it really sour. She also suggested using Rotel instead of the tomato part. So good!  I will try again and use a real lime instead. Great salad!  Thanks

This is a great summer dish to bring to potlucks and BBQ. Being dairy (I don't add feta) and wheat free is a great bonus. It keeps for a several days in the fridge so I make a double batch every time and eat it during the week as a main dish or side.  I am mostly reviewing this so I can remember my changes the next time I make it: 1/4 cup (4 TBSP) lime juice, green onions, cherry tomatoes, canned chicken (to make it more of a main dish), homemade Adobo  seasoning (I think it really needs this seasoning), cooked the quinoa in a pressure cooker with chicken broth not water.

This was good. Made it as listed with the exception of adding some sliced olives since I like olives in most Mexican dishes. Thought the feta was almost to much and might try a different cheese next time. Did not have adobo seasoning so made some from another recipe on this site and it was a double win because the made up seasoning was also a big win that I will use again.

I loved this recipe.  I used green onions instead of red, and didn't add lime juice.  The first time I made it I used tomatoes, but left them out the next time because they didn't keep well for leftovers.

I  made 1.5 times as much, increasing  liquid accordingly. I used chicken broth instead of water. I also increased all other ingredients by 50 % except the beans, instead I added a can of corn.  Salad was amazingly colourful and delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I had to skip the onions, but adore this. Main meal for me. I also add more cilantro as I'm a fan.  (More corn and tomatoes too)

I'm a recent covert to quinoa, and this recipe is one of the best I've ever made. I used 1c of quinoa but pretty much eyeballed the other ingredients. Kept the amount of dressing the same though (PEREFCT!) Didn't have Adobo seasoning so I added a wee pinch of ground Chipotle powder. This was so good. Even my 3y/o and 4y/o asked for seconds. Thanks so much!

Brought this to a picnic as a side dish and everyone loved it!!  I will make this on a regular basis from now on.  It was very easy to make and easy enough to tweak to your personal liking.  I hate cilantro so left it out, certainly no one missed it.

This was delicious! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a jalapeno pepper, I think next time I'll use two.  I didn't have abodo sauce, but I did have some chipotle hot sauce. I added three tablespoons of that to the recipe because I like things spicy. It was delicious.  I also cooked the quinoa in beef broth because I didn't have chicken broth.  Furthermore, I used green onion instead of red onion because that's what I had laying around.  I also added two cloves of minced garlic. Finally, to make it more colorful, I used red bell pepper instead of green.  It's not exactly to the recipe, but really close and definitely a repeat.  This may become a staple in my recipe book.  This was my main course tonight and it filled me up perfectly. Not to mention I have plenty of leftovers for the rest of the week for my roomie and I.

This has become one of my go to recipes that we eat frequently.  It is so delicious and anyone I've ever made it for loves it, even my kids.  I don't put the corn, salt/pepper or the adobo seasoning in it and it still tastes amazing.  I served it as a side dish with ham and green beans for Christmas for a healthy twist and it was a hit.

I just tried Quinoa this week for the 1st time at a restaurant...enjoyed it so much that I thought I should find some recipes to try at home...This was the first one I found and I made it today....I "forgot" to make the quinoa in the chicken broth and it still came out DELICIOUS!! I wouldn't change anything else about the recipe.
Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this for a work potluck and it went over very well.  I love this dish.  Fresh tasting and yummy.  I added a jalapeno, used veggie broth for so it was truely meatless and used Ricotta Salada cheese in lieu of Feta.  Whole Foods carry this cheese and it was very good.  Highly Recommend this dish!

A great salad!  I made some changes.  First, as a vegetarian, I substituted the chicken broth with vegetable broth instead.  I also added 1/2 cup sweet red bell pepper (diced).  I cut the lime juice down to 1/4 cup.  Whenever possible, I use heirloom tomatoes (my favorites so far have been hillbilly and cherokee purple). Sometimes I use red quinoa or rainbow quinoa for visual effect.  I often stuff it in pita bread for a filling on-the-go lunch.

Made this for a tailgate side dish.  Everyone liked it, easy to prepare, omitted the cilantro and feta cheese, and used veg. stock for my vegetarian peeps.  A nice light side dish for summertime.
