Recipe flavor delicious. Two issues: preparation of topping is a little time-consuming; and, time for cooking wasn't accurate.  I first attempted to broil it with the aluminum foil over the fish (didn't make sense but recipe called for this) and after 3 minutes the fish was still raw.  I ended up broiling the fish without any foil, for the specified times, and it worked fine. Had to extend the broiling time for the last portion with the topping. Overall a good recipe I'll use again.

This recipe is AH-MAZING! My family loved it and I've served it up for friends too! My husband even liked it which is saying a lot. I usually serve it with garlic parmesan cous cous instead of rice.

Pretty dang tasty.  I toasted the almonds just to give them a stronger flavor and then processed everything in the food processor.  That made the preparations pretty simple.  5 min under a "normal" temp broil, flipped and topped them for 5 more min.  Came out great.

Love this, tasted like a hybrid of pan fried and broiled. I'm lazy and used minced garlic and put the whole mixture in the microwave. It was perfect. I think next time I'll put on the half the mixture (minus bed crumbs) on the fish when I broil it to get all those flavors there.

My husband, a true meat and potatoes man, does not care too much for fish. But he loved this dish so much he ate not only his usual portion but then devoured the rest (I had made extra for lunch the next day). So for me to find a fish recipe he liked that much is short of amazing!

I really liked this recipe a lot. It is very rich tasting. My only minor gripe is that the top of the spread browned before the whole mix became a crust. I would just suggest spreading fairly thin to get that crusty texture.

Ooh my gosh! Fabulous! I substituted a few things due to what I had on hand;mayonnaise for butter, and almond flour for the slivered almonds, omitted the bread crumbs, added a little poultry seasoning and olive oil. The Old Bay Seasoning is delicious. The whole family oohed and awed, with my seven year old telling me to open my own restaurant! Thanks!

Loved this, my two year old never eats fish and he ate two servings ( his size). Not to mention my husband enjoyed it as well. I served it with mushroom ravioli.

This is an awesome recipe paired with any mild fish.  I used it on Dover Sole tonight.  All I could think of was "Wow, add some crab meat and it would make a very tasty stuffing as well." I'm fairly new to low carb so I used panko instead of bread crumbs because from what I could tell they are slightly less carbs than the bread.  I also used real butter.   Will definitely use this recipe a lot.  Thanks.

I left out the mayo and used minced garlic and cajun fish seasoning. It was tasty but the crust didn't get crusty. I was afraid to leave it in too long since it was browning. I will definitely try it again though. I really liked the crunch of the almonds.

I didn't cover with foil to cook. 

I only had ground almonds, so that's what I used and I stretched it to nine fillets. 

Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again. It was as good as any fish I've ever eaten in seafood houses. I will double the recipe next time I have to make this many fillets because the crust is the star!

This is a favorite in our house by everyone from 6 year to teenagers to adults! I am asked to make this on a monthly bases. Making the topping is the hardest part of this dish but is still quite simple. I would follow the recipe the first time and then add spices to taste. We personally love garlic and Parmesan so I go a little heavier on these. Also the cooking time is a bit longer than stated once the topping is on (in my oven at least). Other than that enjoy!!

Probably the best crust, ever.  I really had no idea fish could taste this awesome.  I made it exactly as described, adding one minute of bottom broil, as my pan was pretty crowded.  Soooo good.

My boyfriend LOVED this recipe.  He said it was restaurant quality.  I agree with whoever talked about the tinfoil.  After the first 3 minutes I thought the fish looked pretty raw, but following the directions exactly, it came out perfectly cooked.  I am not exactly sure how long I left it under the broiler in the end, after the topping was applied.  I just waited until it browned enough to suit me.  The fish was flaky, tender, and delicious.  Kudos

I made this and my family loved it, even my 18 month old grandson! 
I did not use any butter or butter substitute, just the Mayo. 
I used my new Toaster Oven/ Air Fryer and the topping got a little overdone but it was still delicious.

Not good enough to make more than once. Not sure why it didn't turn out - based on the ingredients, it should have been delicious.

Not something I would recommend for someone looking for a true almond crust. I would just do an egg wash  and almond crumbs. Im not big on using mayo as a wash, plus it makes unnecessary calories.

Very good recipe... I didn't use the aluminum foil to cover the fish.  Just put the fish directly under the broiler for 5 min each side.  Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely fabulous! I really hate fish, but I'm trying to learn to like it, and this recipe was really great! I even cheated a bit with the ingredients, and it was still delicious. Changes were: garlic salt (lazy me), no celery salt or onion powder (didn't have it), and I didn't use any olive oil - just sprayed the tin foil to keep it from sticking. Truly a great recipe - it was simple to put together, and it was done cooking in less than 10 min. Perfect!
