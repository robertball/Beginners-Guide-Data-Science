This was super tasty and simple! I would recommend cranking the oven up a notch to 400.

This was terrific!  So easy and so delicious.  Must admit I did add some sliced Kalamata olives and some pine nuts.

Tip for halving grape tomatoes.  Take 2  plastic tops from supermarket  plastic  take-outs, put tomatoes on inverted cover, cover with second cover.  Run long knife through gap in covers, tomatoes cut in half, no problem.

I made as recipe stated but heated to 400 degrees as noted by another reviewer. The fresh minced garlic was still bitter.

It was very good.  My husband especially enjoyed It with his steak.  I will definitely make it again!
