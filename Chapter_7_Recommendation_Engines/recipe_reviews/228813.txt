Wonderful flavors and colors! We added yellow squash and used a little blackening spice after brushing the kabobs with olive oil. We also used precooked shrimp which cuts the cooking time in half.

It was great ,the only thing I changed was ,I put the shrimp on a separate kabobs ,because they cook faster than the veggies then put them all together. Work great

Like it. However the onion overpowers the rest of the kabob. Suggest using a sweet onion and cut them smaller so they get cooked. Also green pepper would add to the kabob.
