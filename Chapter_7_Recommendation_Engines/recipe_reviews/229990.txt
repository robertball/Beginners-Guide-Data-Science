I make a pumpkin cheesecake every year for Thanksgiving, at my husband's request.  I couldn't find my previous recipe, so I went for this one.  It was by far the easiest and tastiest!  :)

The photo that accompanies this recipe is mine!  (The one with leaves in cinnamon, in case it changes.)

I added a tablespoon of cornstarch (put in after the eggs) just b/c I always do with cheesecakes.  The cheesecake rose up so much out of the pan that I had to let it cool for quite a while before putting on the SC topping, then baked it for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  I let it cool in the oven with the door open for two hours, then popped it in the fridge.  No cracks!  

Also, I tossed in some ground walnuts into the crust, as well as substituting about 2 Tablespoons of pure Maple Syrup for half of the white sugar in the crust.

I serve my pumpkin cheesecakes with home made cinnamon whipped cream, ad it's a hit every year!!  (I always make extra b/c it goes with almost every other Thanksgiving dessert, too!) 

I've made sure to print off this recipe and put it in a special spot in my recipe box for next year!!

I made this for thanksgiving, it was devoured. My husband who does not like  cheesecake loved it. Instead of the heavy cream I used a cup of Greek yogurt and only 1c. Of sugar made it really light.

I decreased the amount of sugar used in the recipe in this way: 

I made the crust with  4T maple syrup instead of sugar. 
I also mixed only 3/4 c. sugar  with the cream cheese (for which I substituted 2 c. of my homemade soft cheese). 
I added only 1/8 c. sugar  into the sour cream topping.

The recipe was super easy. I can't wait to try it tonight! I will update the star rating after we do.

I baked the crust for 8mim before pouring the mixture in. I’m high altitude so I had to bake it for 2hrs before it set, after that I put the sour cream topping and baked for an additional 8 min to set the sour cream topping.  It’s delicious l, I’ve been asked to bring it to several holiday parties yearly. It’s not too much filling, you just have to have the right size spring form pan. It all fit in my pan perfectly.

I made this for my family this year. the taste was wonderful, however, after cooking it for 2 hours it was still not completely cooked so it turned out super soft. next time I will bake the crust before putting in the filling cause it turned mushy and fell apart. I would also use less pumpkin, which is very watery, so could have made it runnier. the cake did rise above the pan while baking but never spilled over. once cooked it did drop enough to put the topping on which I loved. 

overall a great tasting cheesecake, but some tweaking is needed.

Very good, yield was excessive, filled the springform pan, and had enough batter for 4 ramekins, and that was minus 2 oz of pumpkin which is sold in 15 or 30 oz cans lol

I'm sorry, but we really didn't care for this.  It took forever to set up while baking, and just spreading on the sour cream mixture, with no additional baking resulted in... well, a topping the texture of sour cream; runny.  Also, there seemed to be too much pumpkin in proportion to the other filling ingredients.

I used the right size pan but it rose so much that I won’t be able to add the sour cream topping? I’m not sure what happened.

This cheesecake got rave reviews at Thanksgiving. I used finely chopped pecans and graham crackers in the crust and topped it with cinnamon and pecans.The only note is that the batter makes two full cheesecakes, not one, and I cooked them about 20 minutes longer than the recipe indicated.

My Daughter tasted it first and said WOW did you really make this yourself :)) She was taking hers home with her after Thanksgiving and after that first taste of the piece she was taking she decided to take 2 pieces and the 2nd piece was a lot bigger than the first. I said yes I did...it turned out wonderful and looked beautiful. I only got 2 little pieces and my Husband ate the rest :)) I caught him up in the middle of the night eating a piece :))

Turned out yummy!  Made way more filling than necessary so I made some in cupcake tins. Should’ve cooked slightly longer because the middle wasn’t fully cooked. Still turned out delicious!

I had no problem with this recipe setting up in the 90 minute cooking time.  I followed the directions and am pleased with the results.  I may skip the sour cream topping next time but will have to taste the completed cheesecake before making that decision since it's for Thanksgiving and I have to wait another couple of days!  What I've tasted so far has been delicious though.

This cheesecake is in the oven right now. I don't know if you left some cheese mixture out of the pan to bake it, but mine went right to the top of a 10 inch pan. So...no sour cream topping for us. I'll probably use a leaf as a stencil and dust with pie spice. I can't see how you had room for the sour cream.

I loved this recipe. The sour cream topping sets it apart from other pumpkin cheesecakes, and raises it to the manna from heaven category.
