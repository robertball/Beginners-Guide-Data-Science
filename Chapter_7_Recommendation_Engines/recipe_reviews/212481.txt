This is the BEST EVER! I followed the recipe exactly, and found it to be different in cooking time- mine took about an hour, and it didn't fit in a 1.5 qt. dish, but it took a 2.5 qt dish! Other than those two differences, the taste was exactly what is promised!

This is our family's favorite stuffing - I double the bread and use 2 pounds of mild pork sausage for a big turkey.  We never have enough leftovers!

I made this for my husband's Thanksgiving dinner at work.  It was very good and my husband said this is the best stuffing he has ever had.  He also received a lot of compliments from his co-workers.  We will definately repeat this recipe on Thanksgiving!

Yummy!  I am pretty partial to our traditional stuffing, but I tried this one since it had cornbread and so does my traditional...I don't know if this will replace mine ( our family doesn't do change well), but it was AWESOME!   I absolutely loved it and it was very easy to throw together!  Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving and was delicious. I chose to make this recipe over other sausage stuffings since it called for egg and chicken stock. I feel this helped the stuffing stay moist since I did not stuff it in the turkey. I made it the night before and turned out just as if I made it that day. Everyone we had over for Thanksgiving has asked for the recipe. I will definitely make this again!

I tried making a cornbread stuffing years ago and failed miserably so I was hesitant to try this one. But I have to say it turned out to be the best stuffing I ever made. The spicy sausage mellowed nicely, so it was still spicy, but not overly hot. I did add an apple though simply because I like apples in my stuffing.  I will be making this again next year, that's how much I liked it.

I made the recipe exactly as it states.  We had 19 for dinner.  There were no prisoners.  By far the best stuffing ever......Note:  I wasn't sure about the hot sausage.  It isn't hot at all.  It blends beautifully.

This was a delicious stuffing recipe. I used chorizo for the sausage and actually stuffed boneless leg of lamb with it. The cornbread and spicey chorizo went great with the delicate taste of the lamb

I made this stuffing for the first time when I had a friend come over for Christmas dinner. He couldn't stop raving about how delicious it was. Now we are married, and he is always asking for this once the weather turns cold.

What a nice change to traditional stuffing.  Followed the recipe exactly and my dinner guests raved!  Even my father who was quite skeptical about having a different stuffing at Thanksgiving, went back for more helpings.  Will definitely be making this recipe next year.

This is a great recipe. I followed someone else's idea and used the 6 oz Shawnee Mills cornbread. It worked out perfect. Thanks!

It was good but I forgot the eggs so it looked soupy and I put it in the oven with the turkey and dried it out too much. All my fault and with the eggs, this would have been perfect. Still very very tasty.

Made the recipe as-is and it was fabulous!  The sweetness of the cornbread offsets the spiciness of the sausage perfectly!  Will definitely make this one again!

This was probably the best stuffing recipe I have tried to date.  It needed a bit longer than the time stated to be done, but no big deal there.  My daughter couldn't get enough of it.  It was her favorite food this thanksgiving!

**** edit for my previous review.
The only changes we make are skipping the white bread and using 2 packages of cornbread AND instead of chicken broth, I use the liquid/broth from the turkey. So basically when our turkey is 30 mins from being done, i scope out some of the broth from it and use that for the stuffing. It tastes amazing because of the added flavours and and herbs from the turkey itself.

If you want cornbread in your stuffing, this is a great, easy recipe. Sat in a crock pot for 3 hours on warm and did not get dry.

My family lo es this stuffing, I've made it the past 5 Thanksgivings and every time I think to myself, "why don't I make this more often".  It's really good and easy to make!!  my only recommendation is to really allow the breads to dry out, if not it will be more soggy.

I made this twice over this Thanksgiving and it was a big hit both times! I made small changes...a  package of Pepperidge Farm seasoned bread cubes instead of 10 slices of bread and 4 cups of broth. It fit perfectly in a 9x13 dish. Cooking time just as the recipe states. The second time I used turkey sausage and it was just as good. This is my new stuffing recipe!!

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving.  I wasn't sure how it would go over (breaking from the tradition of bread stuffing and all), but it was a hit!  Nobody complained, many liked it, and several said it was the best stuffing they've had!  I look forward to making it again, perhaps with some customization to suit our tastes.  Thank you!

This is by far the best stuffing. We have replaced our stuffing that has always been cooked by my mom by this and everyone LOVES it. I don't use spicy sausage, I use half regular and half sage sausage and it turns out awesome.
*Update last Thansgiving we had over 20 people and 3 different stuffings. This stuffing was the one everyone loved, of course I doubled the recipe. Now everyone makes sure that I am making this every Thanksgiving.

My cook time was different, 325 for an hour, but the bottom was a little overdone. Favors are GREAT! Agree with hot sausage comments, even my spicy-sensitive 82 year old Grandmother liked it. Also, it made approximately 5 quarts- 9 x13 & smaller 6" rectangular pan, 2 quart size. I'll definitely try it again, was great leftover too!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner, nobody cared for it.  Seemed on the dry side but the real problem was that the flavors did not blend.  It was like you could taste corn bread in one bite, sausage in the next but all of the flavors didn't come together.  Maybe if it had been made the day ahead so all of the flavors have a chance to mix.  But to serve as soon as it was done as written this was incredibly disappointing.

This was my first attempt at stuffing ever, and I was very happy with how this turned out. I did cook for the 30 minutes, took off the foil, cooked add'l 10 minutes, then stirred and cooked add'l 10 minutes. It was very flavorful.
