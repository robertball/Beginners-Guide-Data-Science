Wow!! This is the best meatloaf I have ever had!  I did have to make a few substitutions because of things I had in my pantry...I used balsamic vinegar (didn't have any regular), V8 juice for the tomato juice and tomato paste instead of ketchup.  My husband raved about the wonderful taste and texture....we will definitely be enjoying this recipe again and again and again......

I have made this 5 times in 2 months and it never gets old.  This is probably the best meatloaf recipe I have ever had.  The only tweak I added was 1 1/2 cups of chopped red/orange/yellow/green peppers.  I suggest you try it original before experimenting, you will NOT be disapointed.

I had been searching high and low for a meatloaf that would blow my mind and this was it!  It was amazing!  It just melts in your mouth!  Best meat loaf I ever had.  My girlfriend and I made it for my grandmother and it was the best she'd ever had!

The flavor is nice but it is far too moist, I even used tomato sauce instead of juice and it was still too wet.  Fell completely apart instead of being able to cut into slices.  Also had too much filler.  Next time I will keep the tomato sauce, skip the water and cut bread crumbs in half.  I would suggest making a loaf and cooking in a lasagna pan so that the grease can drain away.

Update:  I originally rated a 3 as it was too moist.  I think the problem was that I used storebought breadcrumbs.  Have to change it to 5, which is how it came out with modifications due to not using homemade breadcrumbs. (half the breadcrumbs, sauce instead of juice, and no water)  The topping is amazing, even if you use a different recipe, you must try the topping!

Excellent recipe! I actually was looking for a good "base" recipe for use w/ ground venison & this fit that bill nicely! The "trigger" ingredient was the liquid smoke. I also added 1/4 cup more onions, a clove of crushed garlic & 1 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce as per other reviews. I substituted diced tomatoes for the juice, as that's all I had on hand (it was fine).
Due to the use of venison, I added 2+ Tbs of bacon grease & an additional egg. (The kids all used ketchup on it, because they always do, but we adults did not.) I like a "brown-gravy" based meatloaf vs. tomatoe based, which is why I gave it 4 of 5 stars. The rest of the family gave it 5 stars. Thanks for the recipe, Carolyn!!

This recipe is excellent! My Mom's meatloaf wasn't this good. I added chopped green pepper and
some crushed red pepper for even more flavor.

I baked this the day before we actually ate it. I added some minced garlic and a tsp. of Mrs.Dash 'original blend'. It could have used 'a little something' for more flavor (I would have put in some chopped celery if I'd had it.) Also, maybe next time I'll use 2 eggs, as it didn't hold together well once I reheated it. I will use this recipe again.

Made this meatloaf yesterday.  Was  weary about adding the cornmeal to it, I did and I'm glad I did. I have to say this was the best meatloaf I've had in a long time.  The only thing different that I did was to add a very strips of bacon over the top of the sauce/meatloaf, cause my guy likes bacon so much, it was really good. Made with real mashed potatoes and corn on th cob.  Awesome! Passing this recipe to my friends to try.  Thanks for sharing with us.

Love the firm texture of this meatloaf.  It makes great sandwiches! The family did find the overall flavor of the meatloaf a little bland. I think a little more spices (garlic, maybe cumin, or even some italian seasoning would go far) will make this a real winner in my home.

This truly is wonderful. I made it just like the recipe except I used V8 juice instead of tomato juice. Taste and texture was perfect. It was even better the next day as leftovers. Yummy!! Some people complained about it falling apart and I am wondering if it depends on what kind of ground beef you use. I used 96%, so maybe you may have more trouble if you use the more greasy cheap stuf?? Just a thought since I had no trouble at all. I will make this many times,I am sure

Great recipe! Thanks for sharing! I made it for a crowd and it was way too moist and fell apart but after the leftovers got cold it held together great. I used part of the leftovers in chili and part of them I simmered in a little water, added BBQ sauce, & mustard and had Sloppy Joes! Everyone in the crowd said the meatloaf had a great flavor and one person asked for the recipe. I will make it again and try to figure out why it was so moist. Could have been the hamburger.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and I have to say It is so GOOD! I added everything but liquid smoke flavoring because I couldn't find it in the store, but other than that, it is a great dish and I will be making this again.

Interesting all the comments about this being the best meatloaf people have had, or not as bland as most of them.  I thought the opposite - it was just meatloaf and there are plenty of other recipes out there that I have liked better and thought had more flavor.  It's not that it was bad, definitely not.  I have just had better.  And the only changes I made were using some onion powder since I don't like pieces of cooked onion, and I had no BBQ sauce so used chili sauce.  I didn't have any of the soggy or mushy problems some did, but I made mini loaves which may have helped, dunno.  (Although it wasn't "firm" either.)  I don't think the liquid smoke did anything for it.  The only thing I've probably never put in meatloaf before is the cornmeal, but there's so little of that -- perhaps it's just the combination of ingredients rather than anything in particular, and like some have said, maybe just too much filler that killed the taste or something

this has to be one of the worst meatloaves i have ever made.  even worse than the ones with too much breading.  I knew i was in trouble when i mixed up the filler before adding the meat and had more filler than meat.  the flavor was also really bland.  i haven't been more disapointed in a recipe in a long time

the only meatloaf we make, the only thing we do different is something that happened on accident. We double the sauce and mix half into the meat before we cook it. So good.

This meatloaf was DELICIOUS. I followed the recipe for the meatloaf itself to a 'T' but I added a glaze of ketchup, A1 and a bit of sugar to the top at the 45 minute mark. It may be just because I'm used to ketchup with meatloaf as that's how I ate it when I was a kid. Anyway, it was PACKED with flavor and I couldn't imagine needing the ranch dressing. Thankfully for me there are leftovers so I can have some more today. :) I would definitely recommend this simple, fantastic recipe.

Excellent, I've made this about 4 times now and the only change I find it needs is to add 2 extra tablespoons of ketchup to the topping.  Gives it that appealing bright red color, and a much richer taste.

I don't have a clue what the big "to-do" is about this meatloaf! I knew I should have stuck to my own recipe..I always think I need to make a different one..WRONG! I was not impressed at all and all of the wasted ingredients! Live and learn..seems to be my motto lately!

This was the worst meatloaf "soup" I have ever made! It was so wet we could not eat it. I checked over everything I did and added and it was to the letter. I am just sorry there is no place for negitive stars.

I will have to make this over because, after changing the serving size smaller since there is only a few of us eating, the amount of water and tomato juice it called for totally turned it into a muddy substance that never thickened. So we ordered pizza.

This is a wonderful recipe! This is going in the "keeper file". With some Yukon gold mashed potatoes and some green beans on the side, it was comfort food at its best.

This meatloaf was amazing!!! I was a bit nervous when reading the reviews about how it was too wet but they must have done something wrong.  I followed all directions except a few.  I didn't have tomatoe juice so instead I used half of an 8oz can of tomatoe sauce.  I added green peppers.   A few drops of wocshire scauce dash of garlic powder and dash of ginger powder.  I did not use the liquid smoke because I couldn't find it in the store.  This is a keeper =D

WOW! I was looking for a new way to prepare meatloaf. My meatloaf recipe has been in the family for a long time and everyone loves it, but I was looking for a change that would at least be in the same league as mine. This was it. My family was very hesitant on trying this out, but it was thoroughly enjoyed by all. I doubled the recipe and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours to perfection. I was concerned that the topping might not hold up for the extended cooking time, but it did great. This meatloaf was moist and very tasty. By mistake I "over-doubled" the topping. I tossed out the extra before we ate and I was sorry that I didn't keep it. YUM! It was soooo good. Other than doubling it and cooking it longer, I didn't change a thing so I could accurately rate it. My only slight disappointment was the left-overs. Usually left-over meatloaf is to die for, but this one was far better fresh out of the oven for some reason. It was still very good, just not as good as the first night. Thank you for the terrific recipe. I will be making this again and again.
Update: I have made this numerous times with great results every time. I don't get why a few peolpe claim to get "soupy" or "mushy" results. Maybe the way they shape it so it isn't cooking through properly?? Oven issues??? Mix up when measuring?? Maybe they're covering it up with foil when the recipe does not say to?? I don't get it, but this is the best meatloaf and well worth all the ingredients!

Definitely the best i've had too. My last attempt was more like a brick, using another recipe. This one is moist and flavorful. The only things i added are a dash of mixed herbs & 1 envelope onion soup mix coz i just love onions.

My husband was not happy to hear I was making meatloaf.  But once I made it... he was in love!!  Made a few changes after reading the reviews.  Omitted tomato sauce and water.  Placed 1/2 cup of tomatoe paste and added enough water to make total volume of 3/4 cup.  Used fresh bread to make my bread crumbs.  Everyone must try this recipe!!!

The only thing I'll do differently next time is double the amount of sauce for the top.  My husband devoured this and the leftovers didn't las 24 hours.

This was good, but not spectacular. I read a lot of reviews. Some complained that it was too runny, so instead of tomato juice I used tomato paste mixed with a bit of water. Others said it was bland so I added 1 tsp. each of black pepper and garlic powder. Lastly, I made 1.5 time the glaze. Those changes all helped, but the final product was still tasty but not incredible.

My family loved this (especially me) and I usually am not a big fan of meatloaf. I did not have tomato juice so i substituted tomato sauce. I also punched holes on the top before adding topping so that flavor of topping gets into the meat. I also cooked this on a large cookie sheet rather than a loaf pan so that the meat would cook more evenly throughout. Thanks for the fabulous recipe.

Was great for dinner and even better for lunch the next day!  Just make sure you double the glaze; there was just enough there to tease you.  A def do again, but this time I'll double everything so there's more for leftovers!

In my opinion this recipe had way too much breading, there was no meaty flavor. The barbecue sauce and smoke flavoring made it a bit different, and the glaze was ok, but all in all it wasn't a keeper. From all the good ratings and reviews I was expecting a great meatloaf, but was very dissappointed. My family thought it was mediocre. Lots of better meatloaf recipes are available.

Recipe was great (although I omitted the corn meal-only because I personally don't care for it). Before placing meatloaf in the loaf pan I patted it into a rectangle and put shredded cheese down the middle, rolled it up and patted it into the pan and baked as stated. Nice surprise inside!

The flavor was fantastic but I found the meatloaf to be a little too moist, almost wet. I think next time I'll try tomato paste instead of juice, or maybe just omit the water. I used bacon on top instead of the glaze, because meatloaf without bacon is just un-American :) Overall great recipe, try it, you'll love it!

I always thought MY mom's meatloaf was the best. Don't know your mom, but she has created the perfect meatloaf. Very delicious! Cooked it for my family, when we sat down to eat I received an important phone call, when I came back to the table all the meatloaf was gone! I only got one bite! Will have to try it again soon so that I may enjoy it this time!

Yum!  Everyone loved this meatloaf.  I omitted the liquid smoke and it still came out great. Will definitely make again.

Absolute best meatloaf I've ever made...and I've made quite a few.  Didn't have to adjust the recipe at all, except for the tomato juice (didn't have any, so I used 1/2 tomato sauce mixed with 1/2 water).  Turned out perfect!

Substituted lean ground turkey instead of hamburger. Then followed the recipe as written.It was excellent. If you were looking for a low fat meal.

I have been looking for a good moist meatloaf recipe and made this for the first time tonight.  There are alot of ingredients but well worth the time.  It was very tasty.  I forgot the cornmeal and used regular cooking oats as that is what I had on hand and  it was still very good. The sauce on top made it smell sooo good while cooking.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing this!

Wow!! I'm 48 years old and have never really liked meatloaf. I tried this because of all the great reviews and I wasn't disappointed. My husband, son and I loved it. I also found that it fell apart when I cut it, but I think if I let it cool for a few minutes I think it will hold together better. Anyway, it really doesn't matter: just make it, get it on your plate and eat it!

No one really liked this meatloaf. It was very mushy. The consistency was awful. The flavor wasn't bad but I won't make this again.

This meatloaf comes out very mushy; almost like a mash. The taste is good, but the consistency is off. I won't be making it again. There is too many ingredients that distort the real flavor of meatloaf.

Probably a 4.5 star recipe flavorwise, but it just crumbled coming out of the loaf pan.  Will try this again, but I'll compensate for how moist it was.

This was quite good and it was enjoyed.  However, it was a little sweet for my taste.  But the rest of the family loved it.

I substituted turkey for the ground meat as well as V8 juice, and took the suggestion of poking holes into loaf before pouring sauce on top.  Halfway into starting the recipe, I realized that I did not have the cornmeal, so just crossed my fingers and added more breadcrumbs.  The meatloaf was moist but held together well.  Defnitely a keeper for my recipe book.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe and the flavor was good but needed a little bit more, it was too heavy on the breadcrumbs. Instead of tomato juice I may next time try V8 spicy juice, a dash more of liquid smoke and use a mixture of beef and pork. I may cut the bread crumbs down to 1/2 cup and increase the meat to a pound and a half.

I added 1/4 of a green pepper and left out the smoke flavor because I like one and not the other. As far as rateing my finished product, it was pretty good but I'm still looking for the perfect recipe for me...

This was very good. I didn't vary it except that I put a bunch of seasonings on the meat before doing anything else. The meat was not quite as flavorful as I hoped, maybe add some more ketchup or bbq sauce to the meat mixture next time.

Fantastic flavor, I did made some changes, like adding 1/2 a pound of ground veal an a 1/4 pound of ground pork.  I also cooked it cover for and hour and uncover for 40 minutes.  It was extremely moist but not so much that it felt apart. I also added one garlic.

Um, I loved this loaf. It tasted so delicious and thank goodness, because I had taken the risk of making it last year for Christmas dinner with friends.  Thankfully, they all and I mean all 10 of them loved it.  We're still talking about it. Thanks a million for the recipe!

One of the best meatloafs we've had in a while.  Modified the recipe slightly.  Used half ground pork and half ground beef, V8 instead of regular tomato juice, 3/4 cup of bread crumbs, but half were panko.  Also didn't have liquid smoke so I threw in worcestershire instead.  And I didn't bother with the separate sauce on top.  Very moist and tasty!  Thanks

I really enjoyed this. I sauteed the onions (adding a clove of minced garlic at the end), reduced the bread crumbs to 1/2 c. and used balsamic vinegar. It was very satisfying and flavorful. Thank you Carolyn!

I just made this meatloaf again last night per my Husbands request! I told him I was making meatloaf and he said, "make the one you made last time". It is wonderful and pretty easy to make too. I was out of tomato sauce though so I subbed condensed tomato soup, tasted just as good.

The favor from adding the "untraditional" ingredients made it tasty, but I found the consistency a bit "soggy" compared with traditional meatloaf.  I would make again, but probably with some tweaks.

This meatloaf was very good.  I had to make some changes, for ingredients I didn't have.  I used tomato sauce instead of juice.  I used cracker meal instead of corn meal.  It still turned out great.  My family didn't even use ketchup when they ate it, which is a first!!

Very nice... I usually don't use so many breadcrumbs but this holds together well and comes out of pan better.  Good flavor too.

I've made this recipe many times and it is my go to meatloaf recipe. Recently I experimented with it and added one can of condensed tomato soup to the recipe and found that it made the meatloaf more moist and it still retained it's "loaf" consistency, and as well, it enhanced the flavor. I also added just a dash of cayenne pepper which only gave it a little more depth but did not set your mouth on fire. Very tasty, thank you for this very nice recipe.

I've made this several times with excellent outcomes. Last night I made it again and wanted to reduce the cost (as I didn't have most of the ingredient in my kitchen). As I never use cornmeal for any other of my recipes I left it out. Instead of tomato juice I used a small can of tomato paste (save me a dollar). I used Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce, flavored breadcrumbs, and doubled the sauce recipe. The meatloaf came out moist but not mushy, absolutely perfect texture

Followed recipe as listed.  This meatloaf is the best.  I am new to cooking.  It is not too often I get a 2 thumbs up from my husband.  With this recipe that is just what I got.  I would not change a thing.  Thanks for sharing Carolyn.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever made. My husband really liked it. I followed the recipe, but omitted the cornmeal and the liquid smoke. I didn't have either in the house. I used 1 lb of meatloaf meat (pork, veal and beef) and 1 lb of beef for a total of 2 lbs of meat. It was not too soft as some have commented. The texture was perfect and very moist. I will definately make this again!

Just made this today.  I used 1 lb of ground turkey, 3/4 c of fresh bread crumbs, 1/8 c of oats and corn meal.  The rest remained the same. The BBQ sauce and the liquid smoke was a nice touch.  After reading that the posters thought it was very moist and hard to get out of pan--I lined the loaf pan w/ sprayed foil which made lifting it out of the pan very easy.  My husband likes brown gravy w/ his meatloaf so I served it w/ one of those envelop gravy packets.  We really liked it and being turkey--it was healthier.

This was a really good recipe, but my husband and I ultimately decided we like the one I normally like more.  The flavor was nice though, and if I didn't already have a good meatloaf recipe this would be a 5 star.

I didn't have liquid smoke, which I'm sure would have made a huge difference, but this was delicious as it was.  I love a good meatloaf, and this is a great base with the combination of bread crumbs, corn meal, and oat meal.

loved it, I had to substitute grape nuts ceral for the corn meal.  It sounds strange, but it was a successful.  Everyone loved the topping. It had  the right amount smoke, sweet and zip. I will be making this again.

I was so excited about this recipe because of all the rave reviews, so I followed the recipe exactly and was mildly disappointed. It was alright but nothing spectacular. My children gobbled it right up. My boyfriend ate it but wasn't overly impressed. I'll be looking for another meatloaf recipe. Thanks anyway!

I made this dish for my family as a casual wine and dine dinner, and it was perfect. All the ingredients make the meat loaf tender and full of juices. The best by far that i've tried.

Very tasty and moist.  I did part beef and part ground pork so it ended up being probably closer to 2 lbs so I had to cook it longer. Fantastic taste - loved the topping!  Thanks!

Personally, I did not care for this meatloaf. The cornmeal gave it a wierd texture, and it was too salty for my taste. My children, however really liked it. I will not make this again...I've had much better meatloaf recipes.

Very nice flavor, tasted great, but it crumbled (a lot) even after I let it stand before serving. Too "bready". I didn't have tomato juice, left it out. With a little tweaking this can be an awesome recipe. A really great base to get started overall. I'll probably make this one again, doubling the glaze, cutting back on the bread, or adding another 1/3 lb of meat, omitting the tomato juice, and using a casserole dish and shaping a loaf as cook time needed to be longer with the loaf pan.

I didn't like it, but the rest of the family did,so it gets 3 stars.  I think the topping was too sweet and the meat was mushy, really mushy. It needed something, so next time I will add more seasonings.  My 5 year old said the topping was too *spicy*

This was an OK meat loaf but was a little bland.  May try again with more onion, a little garlic powder and some Worchestershire sauce to "up" the flavor.

This was really good.  I added a clove of minced garlic and used ketchup in place of the tomato juice in the meatloaf because this was what I had.  I didn't use the sauce for the top (no time) and I was very happy with the results.  I'll make it again for sure.

WOW!  This is my first review on all recipes.com and I've tried a few meals on here...but this one really turned out fabulous.  I did omit the liquid smoke flavoring and doubled the amt of onion because my family are huge fans.  I'm having guests over today and I'm making it AGAIN for tonight! 
*JUST A FAIR WARNING... THERE WILL BE NO LEFTOVERS!!  :)

This was a wonderful meatloaf - so moist. My husband, our 2-year-old and I really enjoyed.  (Our 7 and 4-year-old kids weren't as impressed, but what do they know).  I think I will try reducing the water and adding more sauce next time, though.  Thanks for sharing this us.

Fantastic recipe! Wonderful with a side of pork and beans, and makes a great sandwich the next day.

I never liked my family's meatloaf...so i have had to venture out on my own and find one i could tolerate to even cook. THis is FABULOUS!!! I added a touch more BARBQ sauce and didnt have the smoke flavoring and it still was a knock out- MUST TRY and this is My Keeper. If this helps at all...i dont care for the ketchup-y versions. This is more tangy and smokey.

Every accolade is true.  Having eaten meatloaf for 65 years I thought I already knew how to make the best.  But this truly is the very best I have ever tasted.  I made 2 changes; I used 2/3 beef and 1/3 pork, and did not use as much water as called fr.  Absolutely marvelojus.

This is the absolute best meatloaf I have ever had. It has a lot of flavor unlike most other meatloaf. My family loves it, even the kids.

This was an excellent recipe.  The liquid smoke adds a nice flavor.  I think I'll use less water next time.  It fell apart when we tried to slice it but was still very tender and tasty!

First let me say...I HATE MEATLOAF--or so I thought!!  I made this because my husband had been craving it.  After it was done, I decided I'd taste it so I could show him why I NEVER make the "gross" stuff.  Oh My!!  It was SO delicious!!  I gave some to my 11 month old, and he devoured every bit of his as well as some of mine!!  I even voluntarily ate it the next day for lunch in a sandwich--hard to decide which way was better!! (and I am someone who hates eating leftovers!)  

The only thing I did different was use V-8 instead of tomato sauce.  The glaze for the top with all the ketchup and stuff we didn't like very much--but it wipes away!!  Otherwise, it had such a great taste!!  If you think you hate meatloaf--or just haven't had good meatloaf, you have to give this one a try!!  It's delicious!! =D

This has been the best meatloaf recipe
that I have tried.  The consistency
of this meatloaf is just right..not too
firm and not too soft.  The flavor is
delicious, hot or cold.   Thanks for
sharing this recipe, it's a keeper for
my family!!

Made this for a funeral dinner.  I cooked them in a muffin pan so they could easily be served.  I also took the advise of another reviewer and used half of the bread crumbs, used tomato sauce instead of juice and eliminated the water.  EVERYONE loved it.  Thank you

This is the only meatloaf recipe I use now! The only change I make is replacing the tomato juice for a small can of tomato sauce. This makes it less wet and hold together better. The liquid smoke gives it  great flavor and the sweet and tangy sauce on top is perfect. I serve it with mashed potatoes and corn.

I've used this as a working meatloaf recipe for years.
I usually add more veggies; namely chopped red/green peppers and garlic. I tweak the seasoning to comply with my dietary goals, and usually increase the topping.
It is always moist and flavorful.

I did not have the liquid smoke and my sweetie says liquid smoke gives him terrible heartburn so it is just as well. With all that said, this recipe is the best I have ever had. He said it is the second best he has ever had-next to the one he grew up on. :) Of course....

I have been looking for a moist meatloaf recipe for years.....I found it in this recipe! The only change I made was to omit the liquid smoke. I felt it was unnecessary to add this ingredient.
I cooked it in a loaf pan with a riser inside to lift the meat off the bottom to allow the grease to separate from the meatloaf. I also used 96% hamberger meat therefore again less fat.
You won't be disappointed. This is a keeper!

I read all the reviews and was so excited about this meatloaf.  I was SO dissapointed.  It needed far less of the bread ingredients I thought.  I didn't even finish 1 piece and boyfriend ate 2 but asked me not to make it again.

I made this recipe without the sauce on top and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and very moist.  Next time I may try it with the sauce.  My husband loved it and ate about half the loaf and my stepson wanted it for lunch the next day (which says a lot)!
