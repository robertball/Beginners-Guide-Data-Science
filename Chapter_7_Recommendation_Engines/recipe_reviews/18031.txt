This recipe is nearly identical to my italian mother and grandmother's recipe.  We use a full 32 oz container of ricotta, mixed with two eggs and italian seasonings, and only 12 oz of mozzarella.  We also layer - starting with sauce in the bottom of the pan, then pasta, then ricotta/egg mixture, then mozzarella, repeat.  Top with parmesan or romano cheese.

Oh, and it's better the next day.  Definitely a make-ahead possibility.

Good, comfort food. Agree w/other reviewers to reduce ricotta cheese to 15 oz.  Also modified slighly so casserole's layers are a bit more distinct, vs all mixed together, per the following: Don't cook ziti the full time. Instead, only cook 1/2 the required time. The ziti will finish cooking in the oven. In the meantime, first beat the egg, then mix egg w/the ricotta & 1/3 of the amt. of the cheeses. Add 1/3 cup fresh minced parsley & 1/8 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp salt to ricotta mixture. Drain half cooked ziti,then combine w/ricotta. Fill casserole dish by beginning w/a layer of sauce, then a layer of ziti/ricotta, some sauce, then some cheese, repeat, ending w/a bit of cheese on top.  I have also combined a bit of extra parmesan w/3/4 cup breadcrumbs, then placed this as the final layer.  It adds a bit of nice texture to the final casserole.  Rather than make a very saucy casserole, I serve extra sauce on the side, for those who want more.

This is an excellent recipe.  I am hooked to the baked ziti at a local Italian restaraunt, but this is even better.  If you love baked ziti, this is the best.  Some people have suggested using sour cream, but you have to have ricotta cheese to make baked ziti!!!  Some people have also said that there is too much cheese.  But baked ziti is part cheese!!!  You have to like cheese to enjoy it.  Try this recipe it is amazing!!!

This was very easy and good. The entire family enjoyed it. I added 1 pound of browned ground beef and followed others suggestions of layering: sauce, pasta, ricotta/egg/mozzerella mixture and repeat topping with sauce and parmesan cheese. I had cooked Baked Ziti I from this site, but everyone liked this one better. Thanks Nancy for the recipe and thank you reviewers for your suggestions. PS: I fixed this again without layering. It tasted the same, just isn't as "pretty". I did have to use a BIG bowl to mix the ingredients in, I mean BIG:-)

VERY TASTY.  I WOULD DO LESS RICOTTA, ADD BROWNED HAMBURGER WITH GARLIC.  I WOULD NOT MIX THE SPAGHETTI SAUCE WITH THE RICOTTA MIXTURE.  I DOUBLED THE MOZZERELLA.  I WOULD DO A LAYERING OF THE RICOTTA/ZITI MIXTURE AND THEN SPAGHETTI SAUCE, AND TOP WITH SAUCE AND MOZZERELLA.  TASTED GREAT, SERVED WITH GARLIC BREAD.

I LOVE this recipe!  It makes wonderful leftovers too.  I make this on Sunday nights and have leftovers for lunch all week!  I've made this dish for years with a few adjustments, because it does have too much cheese.   I only use 15 ounces of ricotta.  Instead of mixing 1 pound of mozzarella with the noodles, I only mix about 2 handfuls.  Just enough to see it melt, but not overpowering.  Then I sprinkle the remaining mozzarella on top of the spaghetti sauce before putting it in the oven.  This way I can monitor how much cheese I've got.  Try these adjustments and I bet you'll give this 5 stars!  (By the way, you can always add meat, mushrooms, etc.)

This was amazing!  I added 1/2 lb. ground italian sausage which I cooked with some garlic.  I used the 15 oz. size ricotta and mixed it into the cooked pasta along with about half the cheese and egg but not the spaghetti sauce.  Instead I layered the ingredients like this:  a layer of sauce in the bottom of a lasagna pan, a layer of the pasta/cheese mixture, more sauce, italian sausage, mozzarella, repeat.  I made the dish ahead and kept in the fridge till ready to cook.  I seasoned both the pasta mixture and the top of the dish with some italian herb seasoning.  It was beautiful and a great addition to a dinner buffet.

This is good made just as the recipe lays out.  I can see the versitility of this to adapt to make it a meat recipe, but you could just add some vegetables, too.  To those that talk about layering.  Just make lasagna, willya?  The beauty of baked ziti is you just mix it and cook.

I'd have to give this a five for taste, but a three for texture. The layered method has more texture where this is all stirred together in a big mish-mash. Next  time I will keep the ricotta/egg mixture and the sauce separate as I put the pasta in the pan.

Very versatile recipe.  For those who think it's too bland, use a different kind of spaghetti sauce (I love the Bertolli brand basil) or add some spices of your own.  Super easy to add ground beef, grilled chicken, etc.

I've made this before, and it's a really great meal.  Add some cooked chicken breast to it (or sausage) and it's even better.

I've made this several different ways now and found the following changes make the best results:  1) Slightly less than 16 oz of noodles - more like 14 or 15 oz.  2) Only 15 oz ricotta.  3) 28 oz crushed tomatoes + 15 oz tomato sauce with italian spices, onion powder and garlic powder for flavor.  Otherwise follow as directed.  Turns out so delicious and being so quick and easy it's sure to be a keeper!

A very tasty and easy recipe.  I agree with the others who suggest only using 15oz of ricotta.  This is a great recipe for a beginner cook - it's pretty much foolproof, and I loved how pretty it looked coming out of the oven.  I mixed all the ziti with the cheese mixture and would rather not layer, because in my opinion mixing it all together keeps the pasta from drying out in the oven.  It was even better the second day!  From now on I will make this a day ahead.

This was really really good. Like many others, I didn't mix the spaghetti sauce with the cheeses. I halved the recipe, used whole wheat rotini (it was an "I haven't been to the grocery store in a while" kind of dish) drained and rinsed cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and I just had to throw some ground beef in there. I mixed the pasta, the ricotta, a couple of large handfuls of mozzarella and the egg in one bowl, the spaghetti sauce and ground beef in another and then layered them like lasagna, with the leftover mozzarella on top. It came out very cheesy (which we LOVE) so I got raves from everyone. My husband kept talking about it, even eight hours later. Definitely a keeper for us!

This is what I did because I didn't have exact amounts of some ingredients: I used Barilla pasta (my favorite pasta so far,) 15oz ricotta, about 25oz Rao's marinara sauce (it's the best jar sauce in the world, worth the extra money,) 8oz mozzarella with 6oz Trader Joe's shredded 3 cheese blend (mozzarella, monterey jack, and cheddar), and Trader Joe's Parmesan Romano grated cheese.  I cooked the ziti for 6-ish minutes (half the time), mixed it into the ricotta/egg/sauce/half of the shredded cheese, placed it in the greased pan, and added the remaining sauce and shredded cheese.  Topped it with the parm/romano and cooked for 30 min at 375 degrees.  

So, I used less cheese all around, and it was still super cheesy.  And the amount of sauce was perfect (you could always add more heated sauce if it's not enough.  The pasta was perfectly cooked - just on the other side of al dente - but that could also be because Barilla is great.  I made it without meat, but my husband requested some spicy italian sausage to add to leftovers when we eat it again.  It's perfect because I could leave it meatless for my daughter and add the meat to my husband's dish. 

Perfect ziti - better than the $20 ziti from my husband's favorite take out place.

The Sicilian grandmother who taught me my basic Italian recipes just called this her "macaroni", and said it to always serve it with more "gravy" (marinara sauce - she used Ragu, unless it was a Sunday dinner)on the side, in case someone thought it was too dry.  I love this, and make it often.  Good for you for sharing this tradition!

Sauce from a jar ??? Never ! We used Nonna's red gravy instead. We also used a 15 oz container of ricotta - it was great. My one year old and three year old went nuts for it. I added red pepper flakes at the end to my dish. This is a keeper.

This was a good recipe.  I followed it exactly except for - I used 32 oz. ricotta...mixed it with 2 eggs and added some Italian seasoning.  Very good!  I did not do the layering and it was great.

I needed to bring this to an office potluck lunch. The night before, I mixed the ricotta, mozzarella, sauce, eggs, and seasoning in a bowl and put it in the refrigerator. The next morning, I preheated the oven while I boiled the ziti. Then I threw it all together in the baking pan, and it cooked while I took my shower! I was out the door on time and everyone LOVED it! I doubled the recipe, using 2 pounds of ziti, 3 pounds of ricotta, and lots of pre-shredded mozzarella. Creamy and delicious! And the easiest!

Delicious!  Just like our favorite Italian restaurant's baked ziti.
Only changes I made were adding some basil and reserving some mozzerella for the top.  I baked it covered for 25 minutes, then uncovered for the last ten.  Served it with garlic bread, yummy!  Husband licked his plate clean :)

This was great!  I had 10 people over for dinner so I doubled the recipe, but only used 2lbs of ricotta cheese. I also usee 3 jars of sauce for the ziti and for guests to put on top and that worked out perfect.  I would also suggest to add some italian seasoning and salt.  I served it with "best brushetta" on toasted slices of bread that I spread butter on, crab and artichoke dip, and "chocolate trifle" for desert!   It all came out wonderful (as my guests put it :-))

Very yummy and easy to make.  I served it at my play rehearsal, and everyone just gobbled it up!  I would recommend using a bit less ricotta cheese. Also, to give the tomato sauce an extra kick, use about half a jar of sweet basil sauce and add a can of diced tomatoes and a jar of Traditional Pizza Bake sauce.

I made this last night and it was a huge hit with my picky eaters! I only made a couple changes, I added ground Italian sausage to my sauce, and did layering with sauce and mozzarella, sprinkled some Italian bread crumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese on top, then right before pulling it out of the oven I turned it to broil for a minute to get the cheese a little crunchy on top. DELICIOUS!!! This will definitely be added to the rotation!

I followed others' suggestions and made a few changes:  I used only 15 oz. ricotta, added 2 heaping T. sour cream, I used 1 1/2 lbs. mozz cheese, added 1 lb. seasoned ground beef, and I didn't mix the sauce in with the cheeses and pasta, I layered the ingredients, like a lasagna.  DELICIOUS!!  After changes:  5 stars!!!  Definitely a keeper.

This was delicious! I used rotini because that's what I had on hand. I added some garlic and fresh basil to the mixture too, just because I do that with all my pasta. I also used up about a half pound of cooked and crumbled Italian sausage. This was a recipe for me to use up some foods.  I read reviews about it being too dry so I baked mine with foil and than 15 min at the end without foil. It was not dry, very moist, cheesy and flavorful! I am definitely making this again.

a good basic recipe. add spices if your sauce is plain-ish. i cut back on the mozzarella by 1/4 and could probably have cut back on the ricotta too. i used fat-free ricotta and it was great. next time i'll add garlic powder. ETA: i made this tonight with 15 oz fat-free ricotta instead of 24, and it was still fine. slightly less creamy but i don't think anyone would notice.

This is exactly how I make my baked ziti, except that I put some garlic powder, salt, pepper, parsley and parmesan cheese in with the rest of the ricotta mixture. Also, I top mine with a little extra mozzarella along with the sauce and parm. This is very hearty, filling and ALWAYS a crowd pleaser! It really couldn't be simplier. :)

This turned out delicious. A little shot of non stick spray and putting the sauce down first, pretty much guarantees zero mess. I think as listed it might be a tad dry because I used a 45 oz jar of Ragu, (seasoned up with 1 med. onion, garlic powder, and italian seasoning, and  1lb ground beef) and the texture was perfect, not dry, not overly saucy. I also cut back on the ricotta and used a 15oz cup.  The quality of this will depend heavily on the quality of your sauce.  Definately a great starter recipe, but could use some tweaks and a bit more seasoning.  Don't overcook your pasta, it will finish up in the oven, by keeping it undercooked slightly, it will allow the pasta to soak in more of the sauce while it bakes. Great Recipe and perfect to feed a crowd!

Very tasty and easy, (though it's just what you expect - not particularly interesting or unusual).  For me, the 5 stars instead of 4 stars is because even my kids ate it, and that's unusual.  My 4 yr old commented 5 times on how delicious it was, and my 2 yr old ate it, too.  The only change I made was to layer it with more sauce - basically I put a layer of sauce and a little of the mozzarella in bewtween two layers of the ziti mixture.  Overall I probably used an extra 1/2 jar of sauce.  Also, I used real freshly grated parm on top (not the green can).

Very good but only gave it 4 stars because the recipe calls for way too much ricotta, and this comes from someone who LOVES ricotta. I didn't change anything  except adding some sausage to make it a balanced and more filling meal. Oh, I did add a little pesto to the ricotta because I needed to use it up. Don't know if it made any difference, but the ziti was very good. Will def make again, just less ricotta.

this was by far the best ziti i've ever made, or had for that matter.  i think the proportion of cheeses is perfect.  i didn't measure the spaghetti sauce, just stirred in enough that it looked right, keeping in mind it would dry out a little as it cooked.  i think that's it is a good idea to splurge on some good quality fresh parmesan cheese on top, the shaker cheese just wouldn't do this recipe justice.  yum!

This recipe turned out really delicious!  Here are some things I would change...Save about a cup of mozzerella cheese for the top.  I put all the cheese I had into the filling, and there was not any to go on top.  I just prefer melty, brown, yummy cheese that looks and tastes fantastic.  All I got from this recipe on the top was a sprinkle of Parmesan and some hard sauce
There was also a little bit too much filling (ricotta, cheese, sauce) and not enough pasta to balance it out.  Next time I make this, I will definitely cut down the ricotta and the red sauce that goes in the dish.
So besides those changes, it was great!  I don't like it when ziti is layered, so I loved how you got a forkful of everything in one bite with this recipe.  I am going to be using this recipe for my sister's bat mitzvah!

As suggested I cut the ricotta cheese in half and doubled the sauce. Also "layered" the ingredients. Used sweet Italian sausage patties (1 lb).  We will make it again as everyone liked it and it certainly couldn't have been easier.  Only other thing I'll do is to mix the sauce with the ziti first as the family said it didn't go into the holes!!  Thanks for an easy dinner...

Loved, loved, loved this recipe. My kids kept asking for more servings. It was fast and easy. I couldn't figure out what to make for dinner for the kids and they were starving. We happened to have pasta and ricotta cheese in the house so I followed the original recipe with the remaining ingredients. The best Ziti we ever ate, and it is the best recipe so far! To make it a little healthy, I made a quick salad with romaine, cucumbers, plum tomatoes and carrot sticks.

Easy and great basic directions. I double to have leftovers, add more sauce, more cheese, basil to the ricotta/egg mixture, and top with turkey pepperoni slices. I use a spaghetti sauce that is a meat sauce, or I saute some turkey to add in. I cook a little longer since I make a bigger batch. Everybody loves... thank you!

Baked Ziti is supposed to be cheesy.  This dish was awesome.  I modified by using 15 oz. of ricotta 2 heaping tablespoons of sour cream.  I made my own sauce of 2- 28 ounce cans of crushed tomatoes, 1 C. of Chianti, basil, onion, garlic, ground beef, and Italian Sausage. 
I liked the macaroni and cheese aspect with the "gravy" on top.  Will make (and share) again.

This is a fantastic basic Ziti recipe. I sometimes throw in more sauce or use more parmesan cheese depending on what I have on hand. Garlic powder is also a must. If I am in the mood I will even chop up some fresh spinach and mix it with the ricotta and egg...thinking I'm making it healthier..ha! The one thing I do not do is mix everything together but in layers (layer of noodles, cheese, sauce, etc). I sprinkle some parsley and basil on top of the cheese to make it look pretty.

This was yummy, but I did add some extra stuff (salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, basil, oregano) to the ricotta. I used 16 oz of ricotta only and it was fine, less mozzarella too, but probably more parm than called for. Also made my own sauce and layered it like many reviewers said; I'm not sure that made any difference at all since my layers didn't stay together when serving anyway. A nice base recipe that I'm sure would be fine as is, but was great with extra seasoning.

this is a good base recipe.  I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't follow it completely.  I browned a lb. of ground beef with onions and garlic, and mixed it with 2 jars of sauce.  (I'm really glad I used 2 jars--it would have been much too dry if I didn't!)  Also, I think 24 oz. of ricotta is too much.  15 oz. is all it needs.  I seasoned the ricotta with salt, oregano, basil and parsley, and wish I added more because it still was a bit bland.  I followed some others' advice and layered rather than mixed... a little sauce on the bottom, 1/2 ziti and 1/2 sauce mixed, ricotta, remaining ziti and sauce, and topped it with fresh shredded mozz.   Be sure to under cook the ziti, because it cooks more in the oven.  And cover the dish with foil for 20-30 min, then cook uncovered for another 10 min.  Yum!

Although I liked it, my family thought that the cheese mixture was overpowering.  When I do this again, I will either cut the ricotta/mozzerella or add more sauce and noodles to compensate. But it was tasty.

This is a good base recipe for baked ziti. I'm glad I decided to use the entire 32 ounce container of ricotta cheese, because I don't think it would have been cheesy enough just using the 24 ounces. Therefore, I used 2 eggs instead of one. I also added about an extra cup of sauce, which really made this nice & cheesy and not dry at all. I had some leftover mushrooms & a cubanelle pepper I chopped & sauteed before adding in this also, which was really good. I also added some Italian seasoning to the cheese mixture. I would make this again, this recipe is very versatile for adding other ingredients of your choice. Thanks :)

Really good recipe.  I doubled this for a party I was having and made it the night before.  I used rigatoni and only boiled it for 1/2 the time...it cooked the rest of the way when I heated in the oven.  I also layered the bake...sauce, pasta, ricotta mixture, and some extra mozzarella and repeated.  I put in the fridge the night before, and took out 30 mins to take the chill off.  I baked it for 40 minutes and it came out hot and bubbily....adults and kids both enjoyed!

Delicious!  Easy recipe to follow and very few ingredients which is great for a cooking novice like me.  I made just a few changes...added a can of drained/diced tomatoes for extra flavor and texture, used just a bit more sauce, and saved some of the mozzarella to sprinkle on top with the parmesan cheese.  I thought the 24 ounces of ricotta cheese was just right.  I cooked the pasta 8 minutes and it baked very well.  I made this the day before, kept it in the fridge overnight and it tasted great baked the next day.  As others said it tastes just as wonderful reheated.  This is a great main dish for vegetarians!

Quick & easy receipe.  I prepared the night before, and baked the next day and it tasted pretty good.  Good receipe to have around when you're in the mood for baked pasta but don't have time or desire for anything complicated.

Though this recipe is perfect the way it is,
you can also brown a pound of ground beef with a 
chopped onion, and mix it with the sauce, instead
of having simply marinara sauce. Therefore,
the ziti mixture is the same as listed 
in the original recipe EXCEPT WITHOUT sauce
and top it with the mixture of ground beef
and the 32 oz. of sauce. Just as delicious,
and it brings some thickness to the dish!

Very good and easily customized recipe. I used less ricotta, added garlic and fresh ground pepper. Next time I will try adding spinach, it needs a splash of color/more nutrients.

This is a really great simple basic recipe for Baked Ziti, personally I would reduce the Ricotta Cheese to 15 ounces but it's all based on preference. Also I had a ton of spices to my Ricotta blend, I put ground black paper, italian seasoning, dash of nutmeg, and sweet basil, but again it all depends on your spice preference!

Amazing ziti! The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because I put in less ricotta cheese, probably around 20 ounces, and I thought that was plenty. Also, I would have used a little more sauce. Personally, I love onions so I added some into the mix, along with a little garlic. I served this with meatballs on the side, and my family loved it. My mom even said it topped her lasagna! Definitely making it again.

This was a very good recipe! I took advice from others and used 15 oz of ricotta and layered it. I also think more sauce was needed. I made 56 oz home make sauce and I had a little left over. Thank you... I have my perfect ziti recipe!

This had the flavor of lasagna without all the work. I added some ground beef, because I had it, and mixed it with the pasta and sauce. I put that on the bottom, then added the ricotta mixed with parmesan, then finished it off with a layer of mozzerella. My husband really enjoyed it.

The ricotta cheese was wonderful! My mom thought it was too cheesy (too much mozz?) but I thought it was perfect. We made our own homemade tomato sauce.

This was an okay recipe. Now that I have made it I know the next time to 1. be sure to add seasoning to it, 2. use only 12 oz of ricotta cheese, and 3. 13oz of spag. sauce is plenty.  After these changes, I'm sure I will enjoy this dish more.

I had a leftover cottage cheese mixture from a Stuffed Shells I recipe I also found on allrecipes.com and used that as a layer instead of the ricotta cheese mixture (too fattening). I also added hamburger to make it a more hearty meal for my boyfriend, but I think I'll try it without meat next time, to make it even less fattening. Here is the mixture from the Stuffed Shells I recipe (***keep in mind I used leftovers, so you may want to 1/2 the ingredients***): Mix together 4 cups cottage cheese, 12 oz. mozzarella cheese, 1/2 c. Parmesan cheese, 2 eggs (lightly beaten), and a pinch of garlic powder. Rub a teaspoon dried oregano and a teaspoon dried parsley in the palms of your hands to pulverize them, and stir into the cheese mixture.

My son and I made this tonight. It was very easy and very good. I used low fat ricotta for health reason. I followed the advice of a few reviewers and used 16oz of ricotta instead of 24. My son is very picky, but he loved this recipe. Also, I used a wonderful marinara sauce I discovered in a VA Whole Foods - Cucina39.

You can't ask for more in a recipe...it's quick, it's easy, it feeds a crowd and it's delicious! I did use flavored sauce...I think it was Bertoli Basil and Garlic or something. I prepared this the day before a party and all I had to do the next day was pop it in the oven - so easy! Everyone said it was delicious.

I never thought I would say this, but, there was too much cheese....I prefer pasta with a lot of sauce and the cheese just overpowered it...definitely need to add some spices (ie. garlic) or it will be bland...if I make it again I would cut about cheese by 1/4 and double the sauce...I also might take the other suggestions and layer it

A few other reviewers said that the pasta in this should be cooked short of al dente. Personally I think this is bad advice! I cooked my pasta just a couple minutes short of what the package directed and even after baking for 30 minutes, the pasta was chewy. 

Aside from that, I really loved this recipe. I added some crumbled italian sausage to the mix as well as some italian seasoning. I also added a layer of mozzeralla to the top before baking so it was nice an bubbly when it came out. 

Next time I will mix in some diced tomatoes and fresh mushrooms.

The recipie was easy to make, made a lot of leftovers.  However, I felt that the flavor was quite bland.  If I make this again I will definitely add some garlic and some Italian seasoning!

Absolutely delicious. I made the Baked Ziti IV many times before this and will never go back. This is much simpler and much more delicious. It's also great with some ground beef and onions (brown about a pound of beef with 1/4 to a 1/2 of an onion, drain. Then add the sauce to it--I used about 45 oz. instead of 32 to compensate for the sauce--and simmer about 10 minutes. Follow the rest of the recipe as before.)
This recipe is great as leftovers, too.

I just made this without the meat, and I didn't like it quite as much. Almost TOO cheesy (that's why I gave it only 4 stars).

A fabulous baked ziti recipe! I cooked 6 Italian sausages in the oven for an hour then chopped them up and added them into the sauce mixture. The pan was nearly overflowing because this recipe made so much food. Yum! :)

This was pretty good. I couldn't find ziti pasta so I used penne. I will probably add a bit more sauce next time. Also, a medium bowl is too small to mix all the ingredients in. You definitely need a large bowl. It wasn't heated as throughly as I think it should have been after 30 minutes, I put it back in the over for about 10 minutes.

While definitely cheesy and creamy (I didn't even add a whole pound of mozz cheese and it was still cheesy), I think it needed some other ingredients, like a meat or vegetable to make it a complete meal.  I added some chopped chicken breast and mushrooms, which was nice.  Must use a flavorful sauce.  I also used whole wheat pasta which added some more flavor.

Tasty.  All 3 of my boys (9,7,5) and my husband enjoyed it.  Don't make it if you don't love ricotta though.  Very cheesy & gooey.  Yum!

Very good.  I halved the recipe for the two of us and only used half a 15 oz tub of ricotta because that's what I had on hand.  I also used a chunky mushroom sauce which was a nice touch.  Will definitely be making this again.

This wasn't really so great. Too bland for me and my son says it had too much Ricotta. I'd add more sauce, less ricotta and some spices if I were to make it again. Thanks for sharing though!!

Excellent recipe!  It's so easy to make and tastes wonderful.  It's especially excellent with some french bread topped with butter/garlic powder/mozzarella cheese broiled to melt the cheese!  My only suggestion would be to use more spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese than the recipe calls for.  I would suggest buying 2 (26 oz) jars of sauce for 7 servings and 2 pounds of mozzarella (for pasta and bread).  Add some additional mozzarella to the top of the ziti bake a few minutes before removing from the oven.  Enjoy!

This is very cheesy!  I messed up and bought a 15oz. container of ricotta instead of the 24oz. and it still was very moist and good.  I added some spices to the mix (red pepper flakes, basil, oregano, garlic and minced onion flakes) and added less mozzarella than called for, and it was very, VERY good. Great Recipe!

Yummy!!! This was my first attempt at making baked ziti and I was very pleased! I cut the recipie in half because I was cooking for two. I did add more than half the amount of pasta and it came out perfect. Served with a side of meatballs and mozz bread.

I made 4 trays of this recipe for our annual Christmas Eve open house. Rather than using tomato sauce from a jar I substituted my own. There was nothing left. This is a wonderful recipe because it does not dry out, as some types of baked ziti do. I've already been asked if I'm making it for next year. Delicious!

I enjoyed this recipe but decided to someone else recommendations of 2/3 c. of sour cream, a can of tomatoes and 15oz. of Ricotta.  This made the recipes even better.  I mistakenly used 26oz jar of spaghetti sauce and the 32oz jar, I feel, would have been a lot better.

Needed some additional flavor, kinda bland.  I made this again but I added 1/2 tspn oregano, 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, 1/2 tspn black pepper, 1 tspn garlic powder and 1/2 tspn salt.  I also added another 8oz of sauce since kids like it extra saucy.  For an extra kick I threw in some red pepper flakes (to taste) and voila! Perfection! Even the kids licked up their plates!! Having it sit about 5-10 min after cooking makes a huge difference.

One word to describe this recipe...DELICIOUS! I did the same as a lot of other people did and added only 15oz riccotta and layered it. I aways had it mixed all together as a kid so next time I will try it that way and see if there is a difference. I did add ground hamburger with Italian Seasoning also. This is super easy and I will be making it again, and again, and again!

my picky kids loved this!!!  I did make a few changes however.. but it still turned out great, here is what I did: I mixed the ricotta, 1 8oz package of itallian shredded cheese, 2 eggs,  1 tble spoon of dried parsley, 1 heaping tsp of minced garlic, salt, pepper, 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese and 3/4 jar of ragu spaghetti sauce (24 oz jar) mixed all that together.. then added half cooked rotini pasta. I mixed all that together. I then put some ragu in bottom of pan, (large one) and started adding spoonfulls of pasta/cheese mixture then added a layer of ragu, more pasta mixture, added a thin layer of ragu. then topped it off with the other 8 oz package of motz cheese.. cooked it covered with foil, for a half hour, uncovered and cooked 10 min more.  served with garlic bread, and it was excellent!!  will def make again!

Loved this recipe! Super simple. I also only did 15 oz. of ricotta and I halfed the mozeralla in the mix and put the other half on top.

Very good and very easy. I cooked six cloves of garlic, chopped, in olive oil and then added the jar pasta sauce to that. Then I added oregano to the sauce and cooked it for a while to meld the flavors and mellow out the garlic. Other than that, I followed the recipe.

I made this last year for a holiday party and it was gone in a flash!  Guests were raving over it!  I make my own spaghetti sauce from a recipe I've had for years, and I've been requested to make this again this year!  Thank you!

I love this recipe, I make it all the time. I always add some extra seasoning and garlic, but this is a great meal and makes really good leftovers too. Almost better the second day :)

Need to add a little salt, garlic, and Italian seasoning to the cheese mixture.  Also, extra sauce needed for reheating because pasta absorbs a lot of it.  Kids LOVED it!

Used Rigatoni instead and it worked well. Added a layer of ground beef cooked with a few cloves of chopped garlic and 4 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar AND a full layer of fresh basil. Didn't bother to measure the cheeses but extended a partial container of ricotta with some cottage cheese. Worked very well. 

Wow! Definitely a recipe to keep on my list.

Meh, ok... not the best... definitely not good the next day, the cheese gets all hard & crusty. Wouldn't use provolone.... should always be mozzarella and ricotta.

Tried this dish tonight at small group and everyone loved it.  Just tweeked it a little to make it mine.  The difference was I added pork sausage and ommitted the ricotta cheese.  In the mixture I added Parmeasan cheese mixed with Romano cheese....Yummy!

very easy and quick recipe! I found it very cheesy, and heavy. I suggest less ricotta cheese. There also wasnt much flavour, and i had added italian seasoning. I would add pepper flakes for some taste. otherwise very filling.

Great recipe and easy. I do a lot of cooking and this was the first time I made Baked Ziti. The family loved it. I used a 32 oz container of Ricotta and a little more than 32 oz of sauce. Topped it off with a half cup of Parmesan. The leftovers were great the next day. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this tonight based on the fabulous reviews.  I thought it was ok, but lacking in taste...very bland.  Looking back, it makes sense, as there are no ingredients that really have a lot of taste--pasta is a pretty neutral taste, ricotta is lovely but not strong, mozzarella is the same, parmesan is strong but there's not much of it, and spaghetti sauce, unless enhanced with great spices (and garlic!), especially jarred sauce, is kind of bland.  It's fine, not a bad recipe, but tastes just kind of like some pasta with spaghetti sauce and cheese, nothing special.  Onward and upward to really find a drop-dead great, flavorful, unforgettable baked ziti recipe!!

This was OK.  We made this for dinner last night. I think it definitely needed more sauce and less ricotta cheese. Next time, follow some of the other reviewers and use 15 oz of Ricotta and maybe increase the mozzarella cheese for a more melted cheese effect.  It also lacked some flavor. Make sure you either choose a very flavorful sauce or add some Italian seasonings to the sauce.

Very good. Similar to baked ziti recipes I've made before. Added some Italian seasoning and snipped kale to ricotta and put it together in layers.

Never made ziti before, so I am not an expert on it. However, this recipe is delicious!! I added some Italian seasoning, garlic, salt and pepper to the ricotta-mozza mixture to perk it up a bit. Just a marvelous cold evening treat. I made half the recipe and it fit in an 8 inch square pan perfectly. Thanks for posting this, Buchko!

I followed the recipe except for the following: I sauteed half a large onion with abt. 3/4 lb. lean ground beef, (which I drained), and added them, along with 1/2 tsp each of oregano, parsley, basil, and black pepper to the ricotta mixture.  I always use fresh mozzarella and shredded parmesan.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this dish.

This was excellent, but a word of warning...it makes enough to feed about 15 people!!  I did use 32 oz of ricotta, because most reviewers said 15 oz. was not enough.  32 oz. is probably too much.  Next time I'll try less.

My favorite new comfort food. Easy to make, easy on the tummy, so yummy, and even better the next day.  I used 30 ounces of whole milk ricotta because they came in 15 ounce containers.  I couldn't find a 32 ounce jar of spag. sauce, but it equates to 1 1/2 cups mixed with the pasta and 2 cups on top.

Yum! My whole family loved this recipe. I added Italian sausage and Italian seasonings. My family doesn't like ricotta cheese so I used 24 oz. of cottage cheese instead. It's what my Mom always used and what we like. I wanted easy, so mixed it together except for a little spaghetti sauce on top, then mozzarella and parmesian top of that to make it look nice. The cheese is just right! Thanks.

I listed to the previous reviewers, and also cut down the ricotta to 15 oz, but next time I think I will cut it to 12.  I also used homemade tomato sauce which I think made a pretty big difference, if you have the time for it (I put a jalapeno in mine to give it an extra kick!). I also put some parsley, salt and pepper in the cheese mix as a reviewer had indicated, which was delicious.  All in all, this recipe is fabulous, and went over very well with the mouths I had to feed! Will definitely make this one again! Two thumbs up so long as you don't use as much ricotta as they suggest!

I referred to this recipe for ingredient amounts (instead of pestering my grandma) when I decided to remind myself of home w/ a classic. I used my own homemade marinara, hand-shredded fresh mozzarella, & it was THE BOMB! Flavor explosions on my tastebuds! & that was just the 1st nite... the leftovers were no joke!

Oh. My. Goodness. This was such a good meal! Modifications: I browned hot Italian sausage while the water was heating up for the pasta, and then followed other readers' suggestions by layering the sauce/pasta/egg-ricotta-mozzarella/sausage in the pan (topping with sauce and more cheese. The only downside: CALORIES. Adding the sausage really kicked up the amount of calories and fat in the dish (but MAN was it amazing!).

This was the best baked ziti I have ever had!  It outdoes the restaurant version hands down!  I halved the recipe and baked in an 11x7 dish.  I used part-skim ricotta and added 4 oz fresh mushrooms and about 4 oz of andouille sausage.  This would have still been phenomenal without my additions!  The cheesiness of it with the ricotta & mozzarella is a cheese-lovers dream!!

This is so easy and good. I will definitely keep this in regular rotation.  I stuck to the recipe pretty much. I just used homemade sauce instead of jarred sauce.

My husband has been eating the leftovers from this all week, and he still tells me how good it is every time he eats it. I guess I'll be keeping this recipe! The only change I made was to add a can of diced tomatoes.

I've made this twice now, and definitely followed the advice of other reviewers. I use 15 oz ricotta, 8 oz mozzerella, and 2 24-ish oz jars of spaghetti sauce. Last time I made it I also used rigatoni instead of ziti since the rigatoni had ridges instead of being smooth, to adhere to the cheese. Also I layer it, by mixing the pasta, egg, ricotta, and mozzerella all together, then add a little seasoning (basil is good), then also add just a bit of sauce, to keep the ricotta from being bland and dry. Then in the pan I start with one jar of sauce, then the pasta mixture, then top with the other jar of sauce, then just a handful or so of Italian cheese or whatever I have around. Bake for 30 minutes. I also made a little extra sauce for dipping/topping with a jar of tomato sauce that I warmed up, seasoned, and weakened with a bit of water some olive oil. Helped with the dry bits of the pasta. The recipe was a great base, but doing it my way has made it simply delicious! I think I will try it with meatballs or ground beef sometime.

Exactly the recipe I was looking for. I wanted to find a recipe like the ones in the NYC pizzerias and here it is. I don't like a lot of sauce so this fits the bill. I used Francesco Rinaldi Sweet and Tasty spagetti sauce and it added that extra kick. Delicious.

This was great--super easy too! I would cut back a little on the ricotta--15oz would be just fine. You could also add some meat, which I intend to try. But by biggest advice is to NOT mix the entire package of mozzerella into it--instead hold some back to sprinkle over the top, because it really makes it look and taste even better.

I loved how easy this recipe was! I followed others suggestions and didn't cook the pasta as long.  I also only added 15 oz of ricotta cheese.  I am going to be adding this one to my favorite recipes list!

My new favorite comfort food!!!I did add a lb of ground sausage, and used pasta sauce with spinach in it but otherwise followed recipe. We had it for supper 3 days in a row and my husband brought leftovers to work each day. Quick and easy to make as well.

It's nice to find a baked ziti recipe that is veggie rather than loaded with meat.
On that note, I thought this recipe was delicious!  I scaled it down to 2 servings, which fit and baked perfectly in a 9x9" pan, although after tasting it wished I had made more for left overs later in the week.  I also added sautéed onion and garlic and chose to top with some more mozzarella rather than parmesan.
Baking it for 30 minutes worked fine for me, but to make it a little crispier next time, think I'll leave it in for about 35-40 min.  The recipe says to let it stand before serving, but I ate it right after it was done baking and had no complaints.

This is probably one of my favorite ziti recipes.  I like to add a layer of sliced provolone to the top because you can never have too much cheese.

Good stuff! We added a bunch of garlic, fresh chopped parsley, more pepper and some Roma tomatoes (blanched and cooked down a little with EVOO and more garlic), and it was great. Four picky kids ate it, so it has to be pretty tasty. Thanks!

This was good.  I couldn't find ziti, so I used a pasta called "tubini" it looks almost the same as ziti.  Penne would probably work, too.  
I used low fat (2%) cottage cheese in place of the ricotta.  I thought the cheese/sauce ratio was just fine, my son wanted more sauce.  
This was easy to make and (substituting cottage cheese for the ricotta) I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

Delish!  My whole family enjoyed this - including my seven year old who does not like pasta!  I used a Vodka Marinara sauce with it.  I used lowfat mozzarella and lowfat cottage cheese - both worked well.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and baked it covered for 20 min, uncovered for 10.  We'll definitely make this again!

This is very easy, which I like, but the taste needs a little something, maybe more Italian spices, or some Italian sausage.  Will make again, but add something and delete some of the ricotta...too much for my liking.

I made the baked ziti tonight and it turned out awesome!The recipe called for jarred sauce, but I ued my own homemade sauce. I made it this afternoon while my one year old was napping, then put it in the refrigerator until I was ready to bake it. It is a great meal to serve when you are having people over because you can put it together ahead of time and then pop it in the oven.

This dish is like lasagna without all the work. I use the mafalda pasta (little mini lasagna noodles).  My family likes a lot of sauce so I use 2 jars. I put one jar in the pasta mixture and then pour about 3/4 jar over the dish before baking. I save the remaining 1/4 jar for adding to the leftovers (this dish makes quite a bit).  I am only giving 4 stars because I have modified it a bit.

Great dish! It needs double the sauce. I added more sauce to cheese mixture and more sauce on top.  I also added 1/2 lb. ground beef to it and the dish was great, my picky 4 yr old gobbled it up.  It makes a huge amount and it seems to be a good dish to serve when having company.

I made 4 separate batches of Baked Ziti II for an engagement party as a side dish for Salmon with Dill.  Only comments are that it required 40 minutes to bake and as a side dish it serves 15.

Raving reviews from the entire family!  I made the following changes:  I only added 15 oz. ricotta, plus about 2/3 cup sour cream AND I added
a can of diced tomatoes.  This recipe easily makes 8 or more generous servings.  Invite company for dinner or have leftovers.  Delicious!

This was a wonderful recipe. Even my kids ate it!  I did add more sauce and some basil, Italian seasoning and a bit of garlic, just for some extra flavoring.  It was a great meal and I will definitely serve it again!

So good and easy!  This is a good recipe for when you forget to plan ahead for dinner! Who doesn't love cheese?  I added browned ground sirlion, might try turkey sausage next time.  This will be a fun recipe to experiment with.

Great taste - a little too cheesy for my liking - I'd probably cut down on the ricotta.  My family loved it!

Very good and cheesy. I added less Ricotta cheese and added some Italian seasoning. I layered the mixture with the pasta in the pan. I also added an extra egg. Overall the family enjoyed it. We have plenty left for leftovers!

I made this for an event at school.  I used home made meat sauce, home made ricotta cheese and doubled the recipe.  I added an 8 oz brick of cream cheese to the ricotta because it makes for an extra creamy texture. Shredding your own mozzarella is best as the pre-shredded is coated not to clump together in the bag and does not melt nearly as well as fresh mozzarella.  Taste is much fresher too. I topped with more mozzarella and a sprinkling of fresh basil and parsley I Chiffonade cut. Nice basic recipe you can play around with. Am thinking I will add some zucchini, onions, spinach, eggplant....next time I make this.

Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing. I made this pretty much as stated but, being Italian, I eye balled the ingredients to my taste. Baked it in the oven until the sauce bubbled.  Looked and presented great, tasted even better. Quick and easy to prepare for a no fuss weekday meal.

This was delicious.  I also scaled back the ricotta a bit.  I wish I had thought to put some ground italian sausage in it as well!  It makes a large amount...enough for several meals of leftovers for me and my man.

This was wonderful.  Made it pretty much the way it was written other than adding a few garlic cloves.  My husband loved it and said he didn't miss the meat at all.  We had it warmed up the next day for lunch and it was just as good.  Thank you!!

I made this for company and everyone really enjoyed it. In fact, my company gladly took home the leftovers! I did make some changes since I needed it to stretch. I browned 1 lb of ground beef with minced garlic and added it to the cheese mixture. Also, since I'm not a huge fan of ricotta, I only used 1-15 oz container and as per another reviewer's suggestion, I threw in 2 Tbsp parsley and some pepper. I also ended up using 2-24 oz jars of sauce because it seemed kind of dry when I mixed it; it was a perfect amount of sauce.

This was a crowd pleaser.  I did use 32 oz of ricotta, two eggs and added some cooked chopped spinach.  Mixed the parm into that mixture.  Needed some salt and pepper.  I layered the ricotta mixture in between two pasta layers that I had mixed with the sauce and since I had some meatballs frozen with the sauce, I sliced those and put those in there.  My guests really loved it and it made enough for a small army!

This was a good recipe as a base recipe for ziti but I personally needed something more from my baked ziti. I tried it a again with some chunky garden veggie spaghetti sauce and some frozen spinach, thawed and drained, and it definitely bumped it up while sneaking more veggies into the meal.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe for ziti. I used half the mozzarella called for simply because that's all I had on hand. I personally prefer it all mixed together (instead of layered like other reviewers said) because I'm not a huge fan of getting straight up sauce in my mouth (it makes me gag!). So, the fact that it's all mixed together works so much better for my own personal tastes! Visually I would think the layers look nicer because they it's not all pink :)

I made this dish last night and it was a huge hit with my husband and son! I read the reviews and ended up making a few changes. I added cubed cooked chicken, used 15 oz of ricotta, two eggs and since I only had a 24 oz jar of spaghetti sauce, I added a 8 oz can of tomato sauce. Plus, I always add extra spice to spaghetti sauce, so I put in some garlic & onion powder, salt & pepper, and italian seasoning. I forgot to time the rotini pasta, so it wasn't all the way al dente and I didn't rinse it. Because I mixed everything together (except the cheese, which I put half pasta, half cheese and repeated the layers), I was a little worried that there might not be enough sauce and I might have some crispy pasta on top. However, I had nothing to worry about; it turned out absolutely perfect! It wasn't a 'pretty' dish, but very filling and tasted great! We will probably use sausage and mushrooms next time instead of chicken. The possibilities are endless! Thanks for a great recipe!

The recipe was easy to follow and the product was fantastic.  I did add a considerable amount of fresh herbs (i.e. basil, rosemary, etc.) to the ricotta mixture which helped to further develop the flavor.  This will definitely be made again.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed.  It was terrific!  Leftovers - not so hot... alittle dry.  Solution?  Eat it all the first time!

Meh - this was ok. I guess I didn't enjoy as much as everyone else. Don't get me wrong, it was just fine. I thought that the amount of ricotta in this dish was a bit much. It was extremely creamy, but perhaps could be reduced.

Wonderful dish! I eyeballed the ricotta and probably added 20oz and needed 2 large jars of garlic spaghetti sauce.  It was wonderful and over-flowing!! Lots and lots of pasta!

The ricotta dries it out a bit. So make sure to mix lots of sauce and cheese.

We thought this was unoffensive, but  just a little bland, like it was missing something. Maybe a better spaghetti sauce was needed (we used Newman's Own Marinara). If I were to make it again, I would add fresh garlic and some italian seasoning.

I would give this 3.5 stars.  The method was easy which was nice and it tasted as good or better than any other baked ziti I have made but I think I am just not a fan of baked ziti.  In this recipe as well as any other I've tried, the ziti gets too soft and mushy for my taste.  Next time I'm going to try this without the ricotta which I have decided might be what bothers me the most about baked ziti, I just don't like the texture of the ricotta mixed with tomato sauce and mushy ziti.

I also cut the ricotta back to 1/2.  I also thought it seemed a little dry, but didn't have any more sauce (other than reserved for topping) so I added a can of tomato sauce and some Italian seasoning.  I'm glad I did because it really would have been dry.  I also was a little concerned about the nutritional info given too... It claims to have over 72 carbs per serving.   Even with a whole 16 oz box of pasta, divided into 8 servings (according to box) plus the few carbs for the sauce and cheese, I only came up with about 49 carbs per serving.  Thats a difference of 23 carbs -and for some- an extra unit of insulin.  I am new here so maybe I am not reading the nutritional info correctly?   Either way... it's a make again dish.

SO DELICIOUS! I use 30-32oz Ricotta cheese (we're fans) and sometimes put browned ground beef in--but it doesn't need it. So good for company--I always get "wows".

This recipe was just okay, and is not a traditional baked ziti.  It tasted like "easy lasagna."  In order to taste like a true ziti it needs less ricotta cheese (I agree with other posters that 15 oz might be a good amount) and also needs provolone.

I love the ease of this recipes.  Baked Ziti is my husbands favorite and he gobbled this one up.  I made two small changes, I used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce it was a little dry for us and added some crushed red pepper to give it a little extra zing.  Making it for guest this weekend.  A new favorite.

This was O.K., but there was definitely something missing. Maybe the sausage? My fiance made this upon my request and we will try it again with sausage and a little more herbs and maybe some sambal olek. If you like bland food or have a picky eater at your house it is probably worth the effort.

This was good, but it didn't taste like any ziti I'd had before. The kids said it tasted like lasagna (not to me) and ate it two nights in a row.

Excellent recipe.  Since other reviewers said it was a bit bland, I added a little garlic powder, oregano and dried basil to the mix.  Since I was making a large batch for a party, I ended up using three different kinds of jarred sauce (Francesco Rinaldi Garden Combo, original and tomato/garlic/onion flavors).  The results were perfect.  A little extra mozzarella on top too made it really good.  YUMMY!!!

I put either ground beef or ground turkey in it. I do not mix the sauce in. I do mix the ricotta cheese, Parmesan and the egg together then I layer the ingredients. My family loves this but living in the hot south I do not make this much in the summer...too hot to run the oven.

Okay, I have to admit I cheated. To save time, I combined all the ingredients in a skillet over medium heat instead of baking. But it turned out amazing! And I'm sure that baking would be just as good (just more time-consuming). I usually chop and saute half a medium-sized onion, and add it to the mixture, as well as a bit of pesto and a few sprinkles of garlic and roasted red peppers, for extra zing. Thanks, Buchko!

Pretty good Ziti. I would make it again. I added some hamburger and some italian sausage. I have decided to stick to the recipe and make without the meat next time. You definitely need more sauce thatn is suggested in the recipe.

This was phenomenal! My mom makes an amazing Baked Ziti and even she said mine blew hers out of the water! I used a Spinach Florentine sauce and added some spices (cilantro, little bit of sea salt) No major changes and it didn't need it. Will definitely make again!

This is pretty much the recipe I normally use but in my version I use homemade tomato sauce and also add a mix of browned ground beed & italian sausage to the mix which adds a depth of flavor.

This turned out great!  I used about half of the ricotta that it called for and it still turned out great, actually perfectly that way.  My 6 year old loved it, again I think that is because I was cautious on the ricotta, too much and I think it would have failed for a child.

My friends and I often halve this recipe and make it in the dorms because it is so simple and yet tasty!  The new version we use is 8 oz pasta, 20 oz mozzarella / italian mix cheese, 1 egg, and 16 oz spaghetti sauce.  It works really well.  You can go with more cheese or less depending on what you want.  It is definitely not an exact science!

I really enjoyed this and it was really simple to make.  I just mixed all of the ingredients in a bowl and then mixed it with the noodles.  I added some oregano to the mix for extra flavor.  I would have given it 5 stars except it was a little bland and could have possible used a little salt.

So incredibly plain. I added ground meat to make it more hearty and it tasted like hamburger helper. My 2-year old nephew liked it though.

Wonderful! I layered it as many recommended but next time will mix together as the recipe says. I also used a sauce with Italian sausage and added some Italian seasonings. Used penne pasta instead of ziti and used cottage cheese instead of ricotta (ricotta is much better tasting)Husband loved it!

This is my first review and i'm glad it was on this recipe! I always read a bunch of the reviews before deciding on a recipe, and i took a few pointers from other members such as: mixed up 2 eggs and used an entire 32oz container of part-skin ricotta cheese. In that mixture i added a package of 'italian-style' shredded cheese as well as a a good handful of shredded mozzarella. Since i am in LOVE with fresh basil, i chopped up a little bunch of basil and also added a few sprinkles of garlic salt and parsley to taste. Once the ziti was cooked (i meant to cook to al dente, but i got caught up in mixing my cheese mixture and they ended up fully-cooked. I thought i was going to end up with a mush at the end, but it still turned out perfect!). I used a tomato basil sauce and put half the jar on the bottom, then half the noodles, then spooned out the cheese mixture evenly on top of the ziti. Next was a light sprinkle of mozz cheese. I repeated the previous steps starting with the sauce, and ending with cheese, and then some grated parmesan on top. Baked at 375 COVERED wth foil for 30 min, and ended it by putting unde the broiler on low until the cheese on top was lightly browned. This was DIVINE!!! It also can serve about 8 people, at least. I think the garlic salt/parsley/fresh basil additions really helped keep it too cheesy-bland. My husband took some the next day for lunch and he NEVER eats leftovers!! Thanks to all the other reviewers and also the member who added this great re

My husband and I both completely enjoyed this dish. I added some diced zucchini and garlic from the garden as well as some crushed red peppers and italian seasoning.  I can't wait for lunch tomorrow.  This is a keeper.

Four stars as-is. It was good and very simple to make, but there are a few things I will tweak if I decide to make it again. First, I would add more sauce and reduce the ricotta to 20oz at most, probably closer to 16oz. I would also save some of the mozzarella to put on top of the pasta before baking. Some Italian seasoning wouldn't hurt, either.

Oh my, this is delicious! I halved the recipe for the two of us (there were still plenty of leftovers) and used slightly less than half the riccotta cheese. I also put a layer of mozzerella on the top. It tasted even better reheated! This one wll go in my permanent recipe file! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was simple to make and tasted delicious!  The only thing I changed was I added a pound of ground beef and I used 8oz of shredded mozzarella and 8oz of an italian blend.  Came out perfect and we had leftover for a week!

I loved this recipe when I initially made it.  I followed the directions exactly, and with some garlic bread and salad, had a wonderful, easy and delicious pasta dish.  It's so simple, but so good that I love making it for guests.    Now that I've been using this recipe for a while, I've made a couple of adjustments to the recipe:  Instead of using a marinara sauce, I use a tomato and basil tomato sauce.  Full Circle makes one that I absolutely love.  Also, instead of just shredded mozarella, I use the 5 Italian cheese mixes on the market.    Just wonderful!  I highly recommend this recipe.

As an inexperienced cook, I found this recipe super easy to make and it was DELICIOUS!! I used four cheese spaghetti sauce so it was extra-cheesy. I didn't follow the instructions fully though, I kind of just mixed everything together and put it in a casserole dish, and smothered the top with mozzarella and marble cheese, baking uncovered.. I was worried it would be dried out, but it wasn't. Also, ziti pasta was totally impossible to find, so I used rigatoni and it still tasted great. I think you could probably use any pasta and have it taste great! It's a deliciously cheesy dish and very easy to make, and keeps well overnight... Highly recommended!

This recipe is SO EASY to make!  I made two batches so I could freeze one for later.  It hardly took me any time at all to add the doubled amount - I would definitely recommend this for a freezable recipe!  I wanted to add some vegetables, so I added a layer of zucchini and squash to the mix.  Also, I didn't bother with the layering as some recommended. I figured it would taste the same mixed up (as one reviewer pointed out that it did - just not as pretty) plus I was making a double batch... might as well make my life easy!  :). This recipe is great for making additions to, but is also great as is.

I only used 15 oz of mozzarella, and I didn't use an entire 32 oz jar of sauce...I think it was 2 10 oz jars.  I liked the suggestion of bread crumbs.  This recipe is good-I would have used the 24 oz of ricotta, but my boyfriend thought the 15 was too much!!  And I used Ragu sauce, which tends to be blander (stay away from Ragu!)

This recipe was great, but I added a few things.. 1 lb of ground beef 1/2 ground sausage 32 oz of Ricotta cheese instead of 24 oz. 2 eggs instead of 1 1 large onion, finely chopped Used (1) 26 oz jar of roasted garlic and onion spaghetti sauce, (1) jar of garden vegetable spaghetti sauce.  Fry ground beef, sausage and onion until well browned. Reserve two large spoons of spaghetti sauce, one of each type of sauce. Add spaghetti sauce and simmer low for 30 minutes.  Mix eggs and ricotta, then add beef mixture, ziti and cheese.  Use reserve spaghetti sauce and cover bottom of 13" x 9" pan.  Add ziti mixture to pan.  Bake for 30 mins and let sit for 15 minutes.

Yum! I followed the recipe mostly, but instead of getting the two separate cheeses, I used two bags of Italian cheese mix (a combination of shredded Italian cheeses). Everything else was the same. This was delish and so easy!

This recipe was super easy to put together and came out fantastic!  My Italian husband even said it was good (he usually says things are 'fine').

I made some of the revisions that the other reviewers suggested...
1. Reduced ricotta to 15oz
2. Added slightly more sauce (I couldn't find one jar that had the required amount, so I got one big and one smaller one).
3. Baked it covered in foil.

Tasty, but a bit too much goo for me.  I don't think this is the classic baked ziti that I was expecting.  The ricotta made it sloppy.  I also would have liked baked mozz on top instead of parm.  But my boyfriend liked it because there were no crispy parts like you'd get with a top layer of mozz.  At least this wasn't dry like some pasta dishes.

After some tweaking this is 5 star recipe.  I cut the recipe in half and added 1 pound ground turkey and 1/2 of a green pepper (finely chopped).  I added some basil and italian seasoning to the ricotta mixture.  Baked for 20 minutes and let it sit for about 10 minutes after it was pulled from the oven.  Even half the recipe was enough for 2 of us with plenty of leftovers.

Play with the seasonings according to individual taste.  Next time I will add some more chopped veggies (sneak them in when I can--maybe spinach, onions, or mushrooms).  A great base with endless possibilities!

This was good with a few changes. I brown 1 lb ground beef and drain and cool. I only use 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. I use 2 or 3 eggs depending on how big they are. After I drain the ziti I combine with the meat and cheese mixture. I start with some sauce then the mixture and top with remaining sauce. I even add more cheese before I bake it. Spary some foil with Pam and cover before baking. I get requests for this often when we have a family gathering.

This is good stuff. I was concerned about  it being bland as others had said but I used Ragu chunky sauce with peppers and mushrooms in it along with some fresh garlic, basil, and black pepper. This made the difference, it was yummy. I also mixed all the sauce together with all the ingredients and then topped it off with more mozzarella cheese on top. I definately make this often.

As the recipe is written, I would rate it 4 stars--it is easy (my boyfriend, who doesn't cook, said the hardest part was boiling the pasta), tastes better the next day, and is affordable for the amount of food you get (my boyfriend and I ate it for lunch for a week). I think it would be rather bland on its own, so I changed it by adding some Italian Seasoning and I used Garlic Herb chunky spaghetti sauce instead of regular spaghetti sauce, and the extra spices make it 5 stars.

This gets points for simplicity and small number of ingredients. But it was a little bland- it could definitely use garlic and seasonings. Try experimenting with it to fit your tastes.

Awesome.  Loved by all.  Easy and super quick to make.  Be sure to add either hamburg or sausage for a well rounded dish.

This dish was absolutely amazing!  I made it for my son's christening party and everyone raved about it.  I made the followung revisions: I used whole wheat pasta, fat free cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and substituted one can of diced tomatoes for a can of sauce.  It was to die for, and like everyone said, it is truly better the next day.  Thanks for this recipe -- I will definitely be using the one over and over again!!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I did add quite a few spices to the ricotta mixture to liven it up.  Otherwise, I think it would have been pretty bland in my opinion.  Will probably make again.  The recipe does make a large amount.

We loved this baked ziti! I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta (mostly to appease my kids) and it turned out great. Per a previous reviewer, I only cooked the pasta for half of the time that the box/recipe stated, and the pasta turned out great. That was a great idea and will do that from now on with pasta dishes. It made a lot, but we love leftovers. Thanks, Nancy, for this great recipe!

This turned out great.  I didn't mix the sauce with the noodles, just the ricotta and half the mozzarella. Then I put some sauce on the bottom of the pan, a layer of noodle mix, some mozz. Then more sauce, more noodles,mozz.,  more sauce. Topped with the parmesan. It was so moist. My family liked it better than Nana's!  I also used much more than one jar of sauce. I just made a big pot with 2 jars and added hot italian sausage and meatballs. Scooped out what I needed for the recipe and set the rest out on the table.

This was a big hit and easy to make.  It was a great way to feed 6+ people in a pinch.  I only used 15oz of ricotta and about 2 1/2 cups of mozzarella.  It turned out delicious.

OH MY GOODNESS, this was SO good. It is definitely one of my faves. It's SO cheesy and delicious... my boyfriend even loved it (and he doesn't eat anything!) I did add like 3/4 lb of hamburger into the sauce for a little extra umph, but either way I think this was awesome. It makes a huge casserole dish-full though, so i had to freeze a lot of it, but i look forward to warming it up in the next few weeks!

Overall this is a very good basic recipe, but I too feel it needed some extra zip so added hot pepper flakes (to taste) or hot pepper sauce plus sliced black olives.  Hope this helps someone else out there.

It is very good, but it isn't quite cheesy enough. You could use way more riccota in it.

Recipe was easy.  I added some ground and cooked italian sausage.  I think I'd prefer a little less ricotta.  They were out of the 32 oz jar of sauce so I used 24.  I think that 32oz would be better.  I'll definitely try it again with a few modifications.

A bit bland. Needs some spices or something to jazz it up. Overall it was quick and easy and made enough for several meals. I cut back a bit on the cheeses because it seemed like a lot.

This recipe is so good. I've been using it for two years now. I add zuchini, mushroom and spinach sauteed with a little garlic, basil and oregano. I've also experimented with different tomato sauces and just about anything works. This one's definitely a keeper.

Several months ago I used this recipe for the first time. I followed the recipe exactly except that I accidentally didn't use enough sauce (only put about 10oz on top), but it turned out perfect. My husband and I loved it that way so we tried it out on my parents. They loved it too and told me not to change anything. We love cheese so a stronger cheese flavor works well for us. I honestly haven't tried using the full 32oz of sauce, but I'm sure it would taste great that way too. Great recipe, Nancy. Easy to prepare and very tasty.

All I heard from my husband was "this is good, is there more?" between bites. That's a rave review at my house.  
Since it is just he and I I halved the recipie and made some modifications.  I used half of a 15oz container of riccotta and added a full can of diced tomatoes. I also added a generous shake of basil and a bit of garlic.  Next time I will use Italian spiced tomatoes, drain them very well (ours was a bit "juicer" than I like) and maybe add some red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Thanks for a great and very easy recipe!

I only used 16 oz of ricotta cheese and still thought it was a bit much (my boyfriend said it was just right) but I really liked this recipe! Personally, the more cheese the better but I used mozzarella, Mexican 4 cheese, and mild cheddar. I had chopped up chicken breast and sweet Italian sausage for the meat. I think I’ll be using this recipe again soon! Thanks for sharing!

After sitting in my inbox for months we finally tried this out last night. It was absolutely delicious.  I did make two changes, I used 15 oz of ricotta because that's the size the store sold and I used a 26 oz jar of spaghetti sauce be cause that's the largest my store sold. Everything else was done by the book and it was incredible, thank you for such a great recipe. This will definitely me made again.

This was really delicious! I followed the advice of some of the raters and did a layering method of sauce, ziti, ricotta/egg mixture, shredded cheese, then repeat. Then put cheese slices on top. It turns out SOOOOOO WELLLLLL if you do it this way!!!! I have tried another version of this with sour cream instead of ricotta cheese and my family and I like this version better. Ricotta cheese makes it creamier and just holds it together. It tastes much better! Thanks for the recipe!!

I like this as a base recipe; I add peppers, onions, mushrooms and a pound of ground beef. Sometimes I also add sausage, it always turns out yummy! I like to get some vegetables I’m without the kids seeing.

This is the best simple baked ziti recipe. The whole thing can cost as low as $7 for a 9x13" pan's worth. I must say that I don't mix the sauce with the cheese. I just mix the noodles in with the cheese mixture and layer with sauce/noddles and cheese/sauce/mozzarella. I also mix in some salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and parsley flakes into the cheese mixture for extra flavor. Another great variation is using vodka sauce! It makes it super rich and brings out the flavor of the cheese.

If you like it cheesy this is for you - I used 1lb cooked rotini,  1 15oz  whole milk ricotta, 8oz  of mozzarella  mixed in and 2oz more sprinkled on top after using enough red sauce to cover the top

I added a pound of ground beef and only used 15 ounces of ricotta cheese. I also baked it for 45 minutes and the top got really crunchy.

I'm not sure what to think of this recipe - and perhaps I shouldn't review it until we have tried it as a leftover. I followed the recipe as written, but family members felt it was a little heavy on the cheese. I think I'll put this recipe on a back burner, and try some other recipes for baked ziti.

It's a great recipe. I have two suggestions (no changes to the recipe). 

One: If you're going through the work of preparing this dish, you really should make your own pasta sauce.

Two: Use whole milk cheeses. If you're already eating this cheesy dish, you're not eating healthy, so don't pretend and just enjoy it. ^_^

What a tasty and simple vegetarian treat! I added some minced garlic, black pepper, parsley, and Italian seasonings to the ricotta mixture and it was a sheer delight. It also keeps very well for delicious leftovers.

The kids say it's better than lasagna (and it's much easier).  I added a bag of chopped broccoli to add nutrition and therefore added a little extra pasta sauce.  Fat free cottage cheese worked fine in the place of the ricotta.

Good basic recipe that is fine on its own but allows for personal modifications. As other reviews have commented, go easy on the ricotta; 1-15oz container proves to be plenty.

I love this recipe, but I have altered it after making it once.  I found that there's too much ricotta in it for me so I cut it down to about 18-20oz of it.  Otherwise I think it's delicious.

This was very very easy to make.  I did it just as the recipe called for but I sauteed some mushrooms in red wine and added them to each dish.
I think next time I make this I will add some sort of protein and some sauteed vegetables.

Yum!

Cooked ground turkey, bell pepper, and onion.  Mixed in a big bowl with other ingredients.  Put some in 9x13 and then put 8x8 in the freezer for another night.  Used a bigger container of Ragu and mixed Italian seasoning in.  Put some extra mozzerella and parmesan on top.  Was very good, easy, can be made hours ahead.  Great!

This is a good basic dish.  I added one lb of ground beef, mixed with one regular size can of spaghetti sauce. I halved the pasta and used a 15 oz. tub of ricotta and 8 oz mozzarella.  We all agreed there was too much ricotta and not enough sauce.  It does make a lot, so I will add a can of sauce (no meat) to the remainder and I think it will be very good.

DELICIOUS.  I only had Rigatoni and it is soooo good.  I am not a pasta/spaghetti fan, but I am now.  My husband has already requested it again.

Very good, but definitely agree that 24 oz of ricotta is way too much.

Delicious and super easy!  I even forgot the egg and it still came out great.  Next time I will double the recipe and put half in the freezer for a quick meal that I can pop in the oven!

Turned out very good.  I followed others suggestions of reducing the amount of ricotta.  I also decided to add about a tbsp of itallian seasoning and 3 "hot" itallian sausages. It gave a nice flavor.  I also topped it with a bit of breadcrumbs to give a crispy coating on top.

Good stuff!  Pretty quick to throw together and easy to make ahead of time.  I made my own sauce and added some ground beef, and I substituted sour cream for half the ricotta because I didn't have enough ricotta on hand.  Turned out great!

Googled your site on my phone while shopping at COSTCO.  It was fast easy and delicious.  Your servings tool is fantastic for making sure we had the right number of ingredients for 14. 

FabChef 5 Stars.

Thank you so much for sharing this! Love how the cheese is all stringy with each bite! A little bland, I would reccommend adding more italian seasoning. I used a Bertolli sauce.

This is a family favorite. It's really good with a mixed Italian cheese and extra sauce. This recipe makes a ton for us. We always have leftover night with this one.

I added in some green peppers and basil in the sauce before mixing it with the pasta and cheese. Next time I think I will also add some onion and mushrooms! This is a great starter recipe!

It was pretty easy to make but way too much cheese and not enough sauce.  I am waiting for hubby to get home to eat so if it tastes really wonderful I will upgrade to 4. :)I did also add hamburger, onion and garlic.  We just ate I am upgrading to 4.  Thanks for the recipe.

The recipe itself was just what i was looking for.... the serving section mislead me though! it would have been perfect had I printed two copies out (one the original and one with the new ingredient list)! Although a warped by-product of what the recipe SHOULD have been.... it still turned out tasty!

This was great! The only thing I changed was that I used a 15 ounce container of ricotta because that is all I had. I think that was enough too, so I'll keep on using that much. Thanks for sharing!

Next time I'll use a sauce that's not so sweet. And I didn't have the ricotta which would definitely add to the recipe. Makes a lot though which is great for a college kid, so hello lunch and dinner for the next four days!

I think it might be better with sound ground beef or turkey. Less cheese, more sauce next time.

This was very good, quick, easy to prepare.  I made it by the recipe.  My carnivore husband said "where's the meat!"  Oh well, I will be happy to add some roast beast for him next time!

This was great. For how easy it is to make, you can't beat it! All I added was some garlic salt, a tad ground black pepper and some basil because I had it all on hand. I'm sure it's just as good without. Thanks for posting! It was definitely a crowd pleaser!

I made this dish in hopes to find a new recipe that I can feed the kids.  I have been experimenting lately because I have three picky little ones.  I was nervous when I was preparing this due to the comments from the kids as they came in and out of the kitchen to see what I was making.  However, this was a huge hit! I used ground turkey just because that is what we always use instead of beef.  I was a little unsure of using the sour cream but I did anyway.  I may leave it out next time.  This dish was great!  A miracle in my house when all three kids said, "eww" but after trying it they all went back for more.  My oldest two, (9 and 12 yrs old) actually begged me to let them take some to school today in their lunch.  I hope they enjoyed it!

Excellent way to use up some ricotta that was about to expire. I used 15oz of ricotta like the other reviewers and it was just right. I also used radiatore instead of ziti and it made it look more unique. This was about as easy to make as instant mac and cheese but tastes like my favorite Italian restaurant's lasagne. Your choice of spaghetti sauce makes all the difference, though.

Easy and delicious. This is one of my saved recipes that I make weekly. Freezes well, keeps well in the fridge for leftovers. Warm and cheesy when we eat it right out of the oven. Doesn't matter if I add more or less of an ingredient, still turns out fine. I love Baked Ziti.

I've made this recipe twice now.  I agree that this recipe can be bland.  This time, though, I found Sargento's Italian Pasta Blend of cheese instead of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses.  It's a mix of mozzarella, parmesan and aged provolone cheeses and several herbs and spices.  Definitely made it more flavorful.  I also added 2 tablespoons of Lawry's seasoned salt to the cheese mixture.  It was a hit at the New Years party I went to last night!

Not bad, but bland. If I make this again I will add some canned tomatoes and chopped olives. This  isn't a recipe I would go out of my way to make.

Very good ziti recipe! I added some very lean ground beef in with the sauce. I also took the advice of other reviewers and layered it (thin layer of sauce, cheese/pasta mix, sauce, and repeat). Good comfort food!

My family really liked this and it was very easy to make. I found it a lilttle on the dry side and also found that the 15 minute resting time cooled it off too much. Will make adjustments and make again. Thanks!

Super easy and yummy Ziti! I use 32oz of ricotta and split the sauce between Classico Roasted Garlic and Classico Italian Sausage. Keeps it fast and easy but makes it more flavorful.

This is my "go to" baked ziti recipe.  I love this recipe and the only change I make is that I make my own tomato sauce (I don't use jarred sauce, almost ever :).  This is a super good Italian ziti!

Delicious!!! I used more sauce than recipe calls for (I made homemade sauce and it equaled about 1.5 jars of sauce).  I used 1/2 the ricotta.  I also put some mozzarella cheese on top and then grated parmesan cheese over it.  Good sauce gives it all the flavor it needs! EDIT/UPDATE:  I made this again and layered it as the first few reviewers suggested (rather than mixing it together) and it was WAY better!  Also, I baked it covered for 25 minutes to prevent drying out then 10 more minutes uncovered.

I fell in love with baked ziti at little hole in the wall place that recently closed down. Everywhere else I have tried rivals Stouffers...yuck. I love this recipe! Its creamy and flavorful. Instead of regular spaghetti sauce I used marinara sauce and added italian seasoning.

This is definately a keeper.  It definately turns out better when I use good quality pasta sauce.  I also reduce the ricotta to 15 oz as other reviewers did and it tasted great.  The kids love this dish and ask for it at least once a week.

Extremely easy to make and so very tasty.  I guesstimated the amount sauce and cheese but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Lasts for days in the fridge too.

this was really tasty. i modified the recipe a bit -added beef and frozen veggies to the pasta sauce, mixed the ricotta and egg with mozarella and cheddar and skipped the parmesan. my husband said it was a nice twist on a lasagna dish. thanks for sharing the recipe, ill definitely be making again

Really good but it got a little dry on me.  I had to triple the recipe for a crowd, so maybe I made a mistake somewhere...I may try adding a smidge of half and half or milk next time.

This was great! I added green pepper, onions, mushroom and hamburger. I also used cottage cheese. Mixed all ingredients together and reserved some mozerella cheese for the top. This a keeper!

Delicious Delicious Delicious! My boyfriend can't stop raving about this pasta dish! I thought I had Ziti, but I didn't so I ended up using cork screw pasta and it still turned out tasting great! I added a dash of garlic salt and some basil to the mix and used a marinara sauce.

I added more ricotta since they didn't have smaller containers at the store. Wish I didn't add so much. So next time I make it less ricotta and more mozzarella! I also added ground turkey which I would def do again.

THIS RECIPE IS JUST A PLATFORM FOR SO MUCH MORE! I ADDED SAUTEED ONIONS & COOKED GROUND TURKEY TO THE RECIPE AND IT WAS GREAT! I ALSO RECOMMEND USING MORE SAUCE AND THE REDUCED FAT RICOTTA CHEESE AND SKIM-MILK MOZERELLA WAS JUST FINE...DIDN'T MISS THE CALORIES OR FAT AT ALL!

This was so good!  I used the advice of others and used less ricotta.  I mixed it all together and didn't layer.  Made it ahead and refrigerated it - cooked the pasta at less time than needed so it would finish cooking later on.  This is a keeper!  As I say - it's print-worthy (I print the ones I plan to use regularly and put in a binder).

Very good recipe! it didnt fit in my 9x13 dish though, i had to make two.. one in a 8x8 and one in a 9x13. i used half a pound of mozarella cheese, 16 ounces ricotta, 1 egg, salt and pepper. mixed that with the pasta. used part skim ricotta and mozarrella. I added 1 pound ground beef to the sauce and sauteed onion. the only reason i give it a 4 is because of the amount it makes, i had to make more sauce for the 8x8 dish. Served with garlic bread. (unsalted butter mixed with garlic powder and salt) topped with shredded mozarella and a bit of oregano, while the ziti was setting i put it in the oven.

This is a good meal to feed to kids and picky eaters, but if I made it again it would need some serious spicing up (garlic, onions, etc).  However, my kids loved it, and it was an extremely easy, and filling meal.

This recipe was simple and comforting, but on the bland side. I halved the amount of ricotta (just one 12 oz container of part skim), and it was just enough. I agree with some of the reviewers in that it was too dry. Next time, I intend to use an extra jar of spaghetti sauce. Don't forget to add salt and pepper to the cheese and sauce mixture!! Low fat or fat free cheese work fine for this recipe.

I slightly altered the recipe by adding a few extra ingredients... I  cooked as directed, but did a layer of the pasta mixture then added a thin layer of diced meatballs and then layered the meat with rest of the pasta. Then I chopped up a roasted red pepper and put that on top then added the cheese, so every bite has a little meat and some peppers... YUMMMMMM is all I can say! Also, I leave aside a little of the mozzarella to put on top with the parmesan cheese...

It was good, but I have to agree with the reviewer who said "boring".  I found it to be a little dry, perhaps my fault. The kids and husband enjoyed it.  I layered the dish adding provolone in the middle and also added mozzerella on top.  I personally prefered the other Ziti recipe with the sour cream, but I would make this again for the family, but would definitely have to add extras (meat, spice) to make it my own.  Good base recipe!

Delicious! Finally, a dish that EVERYONE at the table loved, with every single child cleaning their plate! I added cooked ground beef, and decreased the ricotta to 15 oz., but followed the rest of the recipe as written, and it's a definite keeper. Thank you!!!

This was a great base recipe! Next time I might use a little less ricotta. Changes I made: instead of straight mozzarella I used an 8 oz bag of shredded mozzarella and an 8 oz bag of Italian cheese blend.  only put a few shakes of Parmesan cheese in the mixture, as the Italian cheese blend I used had shredded Parmesan included. I reserved about 1/2 Cup of the shredded cheese to sprinkle on top. I also mixed some parsley, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and some ground pepper into the ricotta / egg / shredded cheese / Parmesan cheese blend. It took about 30 minutes covered with foil and about another 10 with foil off before it was all bubbly and delicious. Yum!

The kids loved this!!! I used cottage cheese instead of riccotta cheese (that's what I had in the fridge...) I baked it for about 40 minutes, then I sprinkled the top with mozzerella cheese and put it back in the oven for about 1 minute - until the cheese was nice and melted. This ensures a soft "stringy" cheese on the top! (I used twirly pasta - b/c that's what I had in the pantry...

I used Rotelle Pasta instead of the Ziti, but followed the rest of the recipe. I fed a table of 8 people, and everyone LOVED the meal! It was served with garlic bread and a salad. There were leftovers for lunch the next day, and everyone was full! Will definitly be making this dish again!

We thought this was very good.  My 9-year-old loved it.  I added 1/2 t of garlic powder and 1t of Italian seasoning.  I also browned a pound of green pepper and onion sausage and added it in.  I was short about 5 oz of sauce but thought there was still plenty.  I did reserve a good 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of the mozzarella and put it on top for the last 15 minutes.  I then gave it a quick blast under the broiler to brown the cheese.  Oh, and I forgot the parm so I added that on later.  We'll definitely make it again.  There is no such thing as "too cheesy" in this house!

I made this recipe as an additional "fill-in" dish for a picnic.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  Like some of the reviews, I did not add as much ricotta.  One of the quickest dishes I ever made. Will make it again.

This recipe is fantastic. My boyfriend could eat pasta everyday of the week and he LOVED it! I too only used 15oz of ricotta cheese and a little extra sauce and I added some garlic powder. I also saved some of the mozzarella and sprinkled it on the top about 5 mins before it was done baking. This is an awesome, ziti recipe that I would recommend for a great EASY dinner!!!

Had extra sauce, so I put a little in the bottom of the baking dish.  I would have liked more sauce in the cheese mixture.  I made it to take to someone's house so I put in fridge for several hours before baking. This worked well but was barely warm when we ate it.  Because of the refridgeration, I should have cooked it longer or brought to room temperature before baking.

I would like to give 4 1/2 stars. 

This recipe made a ton of food for just the two of us. I probably should have scaled it down but instead I froze half of it before baking for another meal. 

This meal is extremely rich. Ladies, Feed everyone a salad with this meal. Use the Lebanese Lemon Salad Dressing recipe from this site. It is by far the best we have ever tasted and it gets better every time. 

This dish needs some kind of spice for me to balance the creaminess of the cheeses. My husband thinks it's great as it is though. This is after I added fresh garlic, salt and pepper. Kudos to the author!

I am giving this three stars because the recipe as it stands is a little bland.  I added ground turkey and italian seasoning.  I also used a garden style pasta sauce because that is what I had on hand.  Turned out really good.

I used this ziti recipe to make ziti for the first time.  I actually used my own sauce being that I don't use jar sauce and the next time I would use less ricotta as I felt it had too much.  Other than that my husband and daughter loved it and there was SO MUCH left over.

It was good.  I had to cook it for 45 mins in the oven.  Also, I added some Italian spices to the sauce and cheese mixture for a bit more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe. I will make it again.

I'd never made ziti before this recipe and it turned out very well. It was so yummy I took some to work and was complimented on it!! One thing I especially liked about this dish was the fact that it's still very good when reheated. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this as our Sunday Supper last week, and found it to be a little dry.  I also added two Spicy Italian Sausage links (browned in a pan, and sliced diagonaly) to bulk up the protein. 

Overall pretty good, may make some additional changes if we make this again.

Other than halving the recipe, I made no changes and it turned out great - cheesy and saucy and delicious.  My finicky 6 year old loved it too.

This came out delicious!! I read a few reviews and changed it up a little bit. I used 2 16 ounce containers of ricotta and 2 eggs. i had left over homemade marinara sauce in the freezer that i had made with hot italian sausage and used that instead of jarred sauce. it came out really good and the leftovers were even better!

Delicious and easy.  I browned 2 lbs. ground meat with diced onion, bell pepper, salt & pepper and Italian spices, a bit of water and simmered until the water evaporated and meat was tender.  Then I poured two 28 oz. cans of sauce over the meat and let that simmer while I prepared the rest of the recipe as stated.  It was delicious, and I had lots of extra sauce to serve on the side.  The recipe was moist enough without the extra sauce on the side, but extra sauce is always delicious, and made the leftovers more appealing.

Fresh and easy, this recipe is delicious,I only had a little bit of riccota so i substituted it with low fat cottage cheeze and it was still delicious. I would recommend putting some seasoned pan chicken on top sliced up.

I made this once following the recipe, and once following the suggestions made by PMCKAY1717.  It was better PMCKAY1717's way (parsley with the ricotta, layering, not cooking the ziti all of the way).

Thought it could have used just a little more flavor. It was definitely better the next day. I think it had time to soak up the taste.  I used an arrabata sauce the second time I made it and it gave it that little extra kick it needed!  Delicious!

I made this recipe just as it is listed except I only had the smaller container of ricotta.  It seemed like enough, so I wasn't too concerned.  The ziti looked good, but it tasted very bland.  As I am the queen of adding extra seasoning, even my pre-emptive measures could not save this only average dish.  We still have a hug pan of leftovers in the fridge.  I would add some veggies to this--mushrooms, black olives, etc.--and definetly more sauce if I were to make it again.  I wish I could have figured out what went wrong, because I like the easiness of this dish.  Adding an egg really helps it all stay together.  I guess I'll keep searching for the perfect ziti!

Good, but needs a can of diced tomatoes or two to help cut the cheesy sauce.  I also ended up with so much sauce stuff that I cooked an extra 6 oz or so of pasta to add.

Good basic recipe to build upon, I usually add a bit of basil and oregano to the cheese mixture to give it a bit more zing, and using a good pasta sauce and quality ricotta is key to the taste also.

I rated this a 4 because it is a good basic recipe.  I made it as is, except I boiled the pasta for half the time, figuring it would cook the rest of the way in the oven. I hate overcooked pasta!  This worked out perfectly.   It tastes good & is cheap and easy. it feeds a lot of people.  It fed a party of 11 people & some people had seconds.  Plus I had enough leftovers for 1 person the next day for lunch.

I will make this again, but next time, I will add more spaghetti sauce.  It seemed dry and I like it a little more saucy. I will also add more spices, although I'm not sure which ones. It was relatively bland, even for me & I am always made fun of because I like things bland!  I will also probably add 1/2 lb of ground turkey too

My family and I enjoyed the amount of ricotta cheese in this recipe.  It really made the dish creamy.  Next time, I would add garlic or garlic powder to the dish, though.  I found the dish to be a bit bland.  In all, my eight year old picky daughter loved this, my husband loved this, and it made enough for leftovers.

Made this with the "Veggie Calzones" from this website for some friends for dinner.  Both were a hit!  The only change I made was to use my own sauce rather than one from a jar.  It was quick & easy and stayed well as my friends were late!  Will definitely make again.

As a woman who is a self-proclaimed "microwave queen", I found this recipe not only to be extremely easy, but delicious!  My husband could not stop eating it!  (I had to "scold" him, telling him, "Stop eating it or there won't be any left-overs!"  :oP)

I used rigatoni as I couldn't find ziti pasta and I followed other reviews and added diced italian stewed tomatoes and 1/2 lb. ground beef cooked in italian seasoning.  I also substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta - so I deviated quit a bit from the original recipe, but it turned out fantastic!  I almost couldn't believe I made something that tasted that good!!

I liked this recipe because it was super easy and tasty.  The only thing I would do different next time would be to add some browned meat and/or sausage. But, even w/out meat, this was a great simple recipe I will make again!

Great basic recipe with which you can add your own flavor. I added sour cream, fresh ground pepper, oregano and red pepper flakes. Extremely delicious and will have leftovers. I didn't use as much ricotta as the recipe called for, I used 15 oz. container.

This recipe was great.  Based on everyone's reviews I made a few changes: used extra sauce, added ground turkey, oregano, onion, and garlic.  I also saved half of the mozerella to put right on top with about 1/4 c parmesan.  Seemed to be a pretty good hit.

Not as dry as regular baked ziti. I make my own meat sauce to use which adds more seasoning, and use extra. Good recipe!!

For SEAFOOD loving father-in-law, added a pound each of imitation CRAB meat and cooked/peeled salad SHRIMP that were frozen. Following others' review, used extra spaghetti sauce and 2 baking pans. Mixed everything together, then topped with more shredded mozzarella cheese instead of Parmesan cheese (didn't realize I'd ran out.) I've been making it that way eversince, and it's great for company, and we always look forward to left-over for lunches! Thank you, Nancy, for sharing! :-)

Simple and always a crowd pleaser!  I contantly get requests for the recipe.  The only change I make is that I mix most of the sauce with the ricotta and only use a little on top with extra cheese.

As is, the recipe is four stars, but easily becomes five star when homemade meat sauce is used (traditional Italian).

Well, I made this according to what I had in the house and that was 32 oz of ricotta and 8 oz of fresh mozzarella.  I had 1 large jar of tomato sauce (around 34oz) and a pound of gemilli pasta.  It was very creamy and could have used just a smidgen more tomato sauce.  needless to say it can be a versatile recipe.  Kids loved it!!  Thanks!

This was the first ziti I ever made and it was great. It definitely rivals any I have tried before and I have never cooked a dish in my life. You maye want to go a little extra on sauce...I also made homemade sauce instead of canned. I will definitely make this again with confidence..

Really creamy texture and great taste.  This was well received for a family party.  Served 6 and had plenty of leftovers.  I added small precooked meatballs to the casserole, and served it with steamed brocolli, crisp romaine salad, and garlic bread.  No one had room for dessert!

So fast and delicious I'm wondering if I will ever take the time to make lasagna again! Use as much cheese as desired.  I used just 1-2 cups.  Next time I might add some zucchini and mushrooms.

It had way to much ricotta cheese it it for me, and I didn't even use as much as it called for. I didn't use as much mozzarella as it called for either and wish I would have used more. I also wish I would have added more sauce.

Yum! Very easy to make.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta once and that was delicious too.  We love mushrooms so I even tossed some of those in.  Definitely will make this again and again.

This was very good. I did add italian seasoning, minced garlic, and I used prepared chunky spaghetti sauce. I also used 15 oz of ricotta and halved the amount of mozarella cheese. It was still very moist and cheesy!

This was a nice, easy recipe! I had leftover sauce that I made from the other night so I used that.  I was 1/2 cup short and I did think I needed more sauce so next time I will definitley use the full amount.  I also used 15oz ricotta as suggested and added the 2/3 cup sour cream. this is a keeper!

I have used this recipe about 10 times since I found it and that was about 2 months ago.  It is so quick and easy.  Now I am the official ziti person of the family.  Everyone loves it and it tastes like I spent hours on it!

This recipe was very good; even my 3 kids liked it.  I also substituted in the 2/3c sour cream which I had never used in a baked ziti before.  I really enjoyed it.  I would definitely make this again.

This dish goes a long way.  I used more mozerella instead of the parm cheese and Original Fransesco Rinaldi Traditional sauce.  Children of all ages have enjoyed it.

I added fresh basil and cooked sweet italian sausage cut into small circles to the cheese mixture, also some garlic powder, salt and pepper. I decreased some of the ricotta and saved about a 1/4 of the mozarella, shredded it and added it to the top before baking.

Finally a recipe that knows to use ricotta cheese!  Excellent authentic Italian flavor (if you make 
your own sauce, instead of using jarred) and very easy.  Tastes just like Mom's.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  There are only my husband and myself in the house, so it was a bit much.  I have scaled it down for the next time, but it was very quick and easy and used ingredients that you have at home.  I did use Cottage Cheese rather than Ricotta Cheese because that was what I have available, and it was okay.

I liked this recipe as it looked so easy. I decided however to follow the suggestions of one of  the reviews to separate the pasta from the ricotta mix, sprinkle the mozzarella as another layer and add an extra egg and Italian seasoning to the ricotta. It was still very easy and quick. Everyone agreed it was delicious!  I’ll make it again!

I used small curd cottage cheese because I didn't have ricotta, Threw that in the Kitchaid w/ the egg,  Italian Seasoning, 
Granulated Onion and a 6 Pepper blend.  Layered it as other reviews suggested.  Baked w/ foil covering, until the last 8 mimnutes,  Turned out great !!

My mistake was to use 32 oz of ricotta because we love ricotta. But that was way too much. Next time I will use 24. I didn't bother mixing all the ingredients in a separate bowl. After draining the ziti, I added all the ingredients in the pot and stirred. Next time, I will not boil the ziti the whole 12 minutes as suggested in the box because it will cook in the oven. I did cover it with aluminum foil for the first 20 minutes and then uncovered for 15 minutes. Next time I will use a little bit of salt and pepper in the ziti mix. I had extra spaghetti sauce in a bowl for anyone who wanted extra sauce. Good recipe.

My crew of 6 like it well enough for a second try. I did however add ground turkey to it(the hubby has health issues with beef) and two eggs. And for the next time I make it,  it was requested  I add a can of diced tomatoes and use less Ricotta cheese.... a little too dry.

I LOVED IT! The flavor was very good! I did make a few small changes. I added browned lean beef, I also semi layered it, and I only used 15oz of ricotta cheese or it would have been too saucy. I also used Prego with beef sauce as my sauce. I also used extra shredded mozzarella cheese so I had enough for the top! The kids said it rocked! That was a great complement, I will make it again. It would also be great as a pot luck!

I made mine with meatsauce and it turned out divine. My husband and his friend gobbled it up and fantasized about the leftovers they would eat for lunch the next day. I will go forth only using this baked ziti recipe.

Great basic recipe. Didn’t add or take anything out of the recipe either. I kept the same amounts listed in the recipe. The only thing I changed was I didn’t grease the pan. I added some of the sauce on the bottom of the pan  to lightly coat my Pyrex dish. Also I didn’t mix in all the mozzarella cheese. I took a handful out and spread it over the top. Super easy and super fast. Thanks for the recipe.

I always make this for my kids, they love it! I usually put a 2lb pack of ground beef in it and extra cheese! Most recently I made it with smoked gouda and mmmmmmmm so good! It's always a hit with my friends and family! GREAT EASY RECIPE!

Made this twice. Easy and quick recipe!
1st time it was so amazing, I used 100% whole milk ricotta and mozz cheese. 
The 2nd time I couldn't find the 100% shredded cheese so I used part skim...it did not melt well, very stringy.

Great recipe! Easy to put together or make in advance. The only difference is I layer mine and added provolone cheese because we love it extra cheesy.

CUT THE CHEESE. delicious and very easy. however,  we love cheese and there is wayyyy too much mozzarella! we all left globs of mozz on our plates. perhaps too much ricotta as well. Ill make it again with half the mozzarella and slightly less ricotta.

I absolutely love this recipe!  Not only is it easy to make but the price is right for the yumminess we get in the end!  When I first started putting this together I thought it would be too cheesy for my husband who isn't a cheese person but he ended up liking it.  The amount is great for us as well as I love leftovers!  This will feed my family of 5 (2 adults, 2 kids and 1 baby) for two to three days!

Ok. But have had better. Add Italian sausage and cut up meatballs might just do the trick. Also would add a 4 Italian cheese mix instead of just parmesan

this was so good. Next time I might add chopped up pepperoni or hot sausage dice up chunky and a little crisped in a warm skillet. As is was so filling and a salad on the side was perfect.

I’ve made this several times just as described (or double for a big crowd) and it always gets rave reviews. I use Victoria marinara sauce which adds delicious flavor. A lot of the reviews say to layer it but as someone else said, that’s lasagna. The only adjustment I make is mixing in all of the sauce & Parmesan cheese rather than topping it with them. Excellent recipe!

It was good entire family liked it- however  it was a little dry, not enough sauce. Ialso didn’t have enough ricotta so I substituted cottage cheese for what I was missing. Overall good meal I’d make again, with more sauce!

We try to have one meatless day a week. I'm always looking for good recipes. This one fills the bill. It tastes wonferful. It is filling, and we all loved it! You can cut it in half. I used a half box of penne pasta, 1 lb.of cheese, substituted cottage cheese and used half the amount, 1 egg and 1( 26 oz) jar of spaghetti sauce. I baked it in a 9 by 9 pan. Yum@

My absolute fave baked ziti recipe. I've made it as is, added ground beef and garlic, mushrooms and onions... such an adaptable recipe! My family are all big dairy lovers so unlike other reviewers we don't think it's too cheesy at all!  And as a must mom I love mixing it all together and dumping it in the pan to bake. ??

I made two pans - one with meat and one without. Both were very good. I did 16 oz of ricotta cheese based on the reviews but think it might have been better with more. I won't ever cook it any other way now though! Great recipe!

Good basic recipe. I made it for pot luck poker night. I added ground beef to it cause that’s how my family rolls. Next time I’m going to add a little more sauce but over all I think this was a great recipe! Will for sure make again.

This was great; however, I did not layer instead I added all the ingredients together after I cooked them.  I didn't want it to be dry so I added a little more sauce to it.  This is definitely a keeper and I will make this again.

This is a very good foundational recipe that is easy to build on. Warning, if you’re used to cooking with lots of seasoning like I am then you’re going to want to add to this. I added 1/2tsp black pepper, 1/4tsp oregano, ~4 minced garlic cloves and some red pepper flakes. I also used 1 zucchini and 1 summer squash. I offset the extra volume by using only 15oz of ricotta (essentially a small container at the grocery store). With the pound of mozzarella and parmigiana on top, it was still plenty cheesy and delicious!

This was excellent!  Very fattening so won't be making it very often, lol.  Like other reviewers, I only used 15oz Ricotta which was plenty. All other ingredients were kept the same. The only other thing I did differently was covered it with foil for 30 minutes, then added the parmesan last, cooking it another 10 minutes.  Only because I didn't want the top to get too black and hard. Worked out great. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This dish was a hit at my house!  I only had 1/2 pound of mozzarella so I added 1/2 pound of cheddar cheese and it still came out great!  This meal is surprisingly light and fluffy and so easy to eat.  Loved it!

I made this tonight for supper. I didn't have ricotta cheese or sour cream so I used what I had. Philadelphia Cream Cheese with mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese. I had fresh basil that I added in with my Italian seasoning to my meat sauce That I made. Everything turned out beautifully and my husband loved it. I covered with foil while baking it in the oven as well. YUMMY! Rating this a 4

I added 1 lb of homemade chicken/pork sausage that my son likes(he cannot tolerate fennel).  He loved this dish.  Try boiling the pasta only 5 minutes in water, drain, then add it to the sauce.  Pasta will absorb sauce and the dish will be even more fantastic.  We all loved it!!

This is a delicious and easy recipe.  I'm rating it a 4 only because I added sautéed onions, red peppers, celery and garlic.  I also added an extra egg based on another review, the full n32 oz of ricotta and some Italian seasoning.  Added mozzarella to the top because we LOVE cheese.  Very minor changes - the only reason it is a 4.  This is a keeper for us!

This ziti turned out amazing! I ended up using a 32 oz of ricotta cheese, 2 eggs, and layered it as another reviewer suggested and it was delicious. My boyfriend and I killed it. Very cheesy and yummy.

I always make a double batch of homemade spaghetti sauce so this is a perfect way to use the leftovers. I absolutely loved this and so did my family. I think it helps to use a homemade spaghetti sauce recipe but the premade stuff will do in a pinch. Always make sure to use fresh cheese, the pre-shredded stuff has a coating on it that doesn't melt well. I don't have a scale at home so I estimated on the 1 lb. of mozzarella cheese. I will make this again and again!

I used cottage cheese instead of  ricotta cheese. Its not as strong in taste as RC. I ended up mixing it together instead of layering it, only because I needed to use 2 pans because it made so much. This was sooooo good. My picky son n law, really liked it too. He ate it 2 days in a row, as did hubby. I used 2 lbs of ground beef.  And I used shredded mozzarella and Italian cheese mixture already mixed,  from  a grocery store.  I am saving this recipe. I would make again.

This was so good - whole family loved it. My tweaks...I layered ziti, sauce and cheese/egg mixture instead of mixing it all together.  I added 1/2 lb. of both ground beef and sausage to the sauce. The meat really soaked up the sauce so I added 1/2 c milk to the cheese mixture to avoid the dish being dry and it worked perfectly. Only used 16 oz. container of ricotta.  I also cut back on the shredded mozzarella & layered 1/2 lb. thinly sliced Havarti. Barely hot in middle so needed extra 15 min. bake time. Y U M !!

Turned out great even though I winged it with measurements since I only had a 15oz container of Ricotta. I used egg whites and added turkey sausage crumble for a healthy protein boost. The hubby went back for thirds, so I'd have to say this one deserves 5 stars! Will be making it again for sure!

The best vegetarian baked ziti! It is a perfect dish when your vegetarian friends are over for dinner and pairs amazingly with caesar salad. I used half the ricotta to account for calories and texture (less "squishy"). I definitely recommend freshly grated parm and mozz. It held up better when baked and topped off as far as texture goes.

Creamy and rich Italian comfort food. Put a couple sprigs of basil on top. Also layered it a bit more for uniformity.

I really liked this recipe but I made a few changes.  I only used 16 oz. of ricotta and 3/4 of a bag of the mozzarella.  It was perfect for me but not enough sauce for my one daughter.  I thought my changes made it the perfect dish for me!

My family loves this meal.  Sometimes I only have 1/2 pound of mozzarella cheese so, I put a 32 oz container of ricotta cheese. I especially enjoy it since it's not asking for any kind of ground meat. It's nice to take a break from meat sometimes. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

It tastes good. Something about the orange coloring turns my family off. I need more red tomato sauce colored or cheese color is ok. But the combination is not pretty and then they won't eat it.  I also think I overcooked it so too mushy, my fault though. Stuff happens :)

I followed NRAGNO's suggestions and I really enjoyed this easy meal.  I made the sausage on the side since I have some family members who don't like meat.  What a great way of pleasing everyone without a lot of extra fuss.  I would say that if you are used to having chopped meat or sausage in your ziti, this might be bland.  However, for a meatless dish, it was excellent.  I will make it again.

Easy and very tasty meal.  One of my kids new favorites.
I used about 20 ounces of mozzarella cheese instead of 16 and layered cheese with one layer in middle and one on top.

I thought this was great! I added a pound of ground hot sausage. My husband loved it too. I mixed it all together and I thought worked just fine - I don't see any need to layer.

My family was obsessed with this. Instead of mixing everything together, I layered pasta sauce, pasta, ricotta egg and cheese mixture and repeated 3 layers each. I also added asiago to the ricotta mixture, added a beautiful sharp flavour!

This dish really was delicious and easy.  We had to cut it in half because there are just the two of us and we have a full freezer already.  I used a whole egg cause splitting eggs is like splitting hairs, no fun.  I had a 15 oz container of ricotta so that was it instead of 12, didn't hurt.  Did I mention how easy it was?  Served with sweet Italian sausage it was three big meals and yes it was easy.

So simple and so delicious!!  I made this using small curd cottage cheese as the hubby doesn't like ricotta, and it turned out great!  Added a few extra shakes of granulated garlic and Italian seasoning and we really enjoyed it.  Definitely will make again---maybe next time I'll add some vegetarian crumbles to the pasta sauce, some sliced zucchini, or some mushrooms...maybe some spinach---this is a great canvas just as it is or for a few extras!  Thank you!!

I altered this a bit as well... I put a layer of marinara on bottom of pan, them mixed cooked penne with ricotta, mozza, egg and a little parmesan, put that as the next layer, then more marinara on top. I topped it with mozza, parmesan and bread crumbs and baked about 5 extra minutes as you have to be sure to get the middle layer nice and hot. My boyfriend asked me to put this in the regular rotation! P.S. It makes alot so be prepared for leftovers....

I made this ziti exactly as instructed. I used the 3 cheese prego spaghetti sauce and it turned out amazing!! I don't even really care for ricotta cheese but this pasta dish is spot on! I will warn you it filled my large casserole dish to the top but oh so worth it. It would be perfect for a pot luck or just any night in place of bland spaghetti. I also think this would freeze well if you don't have big eaters in the house like I do.

This was the first dinner my 11 year old daughter made! . It came out great. It was a very easy recipe to follow and prepare. It definitely makes a lot of food. It says it serves 7 but I'd say more like 10 people. This is  a great meal to bring for a pot luck because of the quantity it makes and easy prep. She followed the recipe as shown if I made I would prob reduce the ricotta cheese.

Made exactly as directed, we loved this recipe. Much less mess in the kitchen than layered lasagna and tastes wonderful. The second time I made it, we added chicken and spinach. Perfect. The third time I threw in a bunch of veggies I had in the fridge just going to waste. Perfect again. My new go-to recipe for mixing and matching and adding all kinds of ingredients, or enjoying just as is. Thanks for the recipe. :)

This is delicious! I haven't used jarred sauce in over 25 yrs, I make my own. With that in mind, I made my own sauce and I did add some lean ground beef to it, I also always grate my own cheeses...however I followed the recipe exactly. It was superb as written.... :)

I never add eggs as I have to cut down on the cholesterol and nobody has ever noticed.     I do add more mozzarella and less ricotta .     what difference does it make that everything is all mixed up instead of layered?  NONE!!

It was a fine beginning, but needs so much more. I begin with first sauteing a pound of sliced Italian sausage in a pot over medium heat. Remove the cooked sausage and then saute sliced onion in its grease for 5 minutes, then add some spinach (little or lots, to your preference) and about 5 cloves of chopped garlic. Cook until spinach has wilted, about 1 minute. Add this mixture and the sausage to the cooked ziti and cheese combination with a generous shake of Italian spices. Mix and put in casserole dish and top with Italian bread crumbs and cover with aluminum foil. When it's 5 minutes from being done, remove the foil to brown the bread crumbs a bit. Serve with a Greek salad, a crusty baguette, and a glass of your favorite wine and you'll never waste money on an Italian restaurant again.

I liked it alright. As suggested by other reviewers, I also used only 15oz of ricotta. It was my first time trying ziti, so there's a chance that maybe I'm just not a huge ziti fan. But to me, it tasted a little dryish. I think it needed some more spaghetti sauce to make it a bit more flavorful, but again that's just my personal opinion. One thing I would add is that the top didn't look like the picture. Perhaps they meant to put shredded Parmesan in the recipe rather than grated ? I plan to use shredded in the future :) happy cooking!

Exactly how I like ziti! Creamy & cheesy, not dense & heavy. This one's a keeper.

Love this recipe!  I add ground Italian sausage or hamburger with garlic and red pepper to appease my husband who needs meat, I add an extra egg when I do make with meat. Tonight I ended up making it with cottage cheese instead of ricotta as I was out of it unfortunately.  Still turned out delish with cottage cheese :-)

Hubby said this was 3 star. I would give it 4 - I liked it. It made a lot! filled the entire 9x13 to the brim. I added 1 lb. ground Italian turkey "sausage" and reduced the ricotta to 15 oz.

Excellent just as written or if you want to dress it up you can add minced garlic, minced onion, parsley, oregano and basil. Add Italian sausage, salad and crusty garlic bread and you have a feast.

I only rated this 3 stars because I had to modify the recipe.  I used 1/2 of the ricotta and mixed it with about 1 cup of sour cream.  The ricotta is too much for me, and the sour cream modifies the taste a bit.  I used more sauce like other reviewers did and less mozzarella than the recipe calls for.  Great recipe with modifications!  Also, covered this to cook to prevent drying out.

This was very good.  I added a bit of chopped basil from my garden.  I used 32 oz of ricotta cheese because that's what I had on hand.   I also used a bit more pasta.   This made enough for me to split it in half so I could freeze some.  I found it hard to mix everything in a large bowl. It was very full!  This was very good.

I prefer the layers, too. Also, I like to add ground beef to the sauce, for extra protein. With a simple green or caesar salad, this is a full filling and delicious meal.

2/2017 Use a good, high quality sauce and this dish will be great! I cooked ground turkey and added the sauce and pasta (combination of whole wheat pasta and white flour pasta) to it. Then I layered the ricotta/egg in between two layers of pasta/meat sauce. I put a thin layer of plain sauce on top, followed by parmesan cheese. We all loved this!

Best ziti recipe I've found. I make several at a time and keep them in the freezer. A friend brought me one of these when I was on bed-rest with baby #4. Kids raved about it. Glad I asked for the recipe!

I used Alfredo sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. And I didnt use ricotta bc my husband cant stand ricotta. So instead I used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of mushrooms. And I used Sharp cheddar, montery jack cheddar, and pizza cheese. My husband and I loved it! great recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Second time I tweaked to what the fam likes ...
I didn't use jar sauce ..I used 2 cans of crushed tomatos instead .
I also only used 16 oz. of mozzarella cheese . Also used a half pound of hamburg 
Love this recipe.

I made this recipe just about what was written except I used cheddar jack cheese instead of mozz. Added diced tomatoes with garlic, onion, and hamburg.  My husband and son said it was good and not to change anything.  Maybe next time I am going to try using some Italian sausage.

I made this tonight and it turned out fabulous.  I use my own homemade sauce instead of jarred, and I added in some pepperonis I had in the fridge.  I cut them into small pieces and added them in with the cheese/sauce mixture.  It added a nice kick to the dish!

My family LOVED this...for 3 days!  This is exactly how we like our ziti.  I like to make meatballs on the side so this is perfect.  I did also reduce the ricotta to 15oz because in previous attempts with other recipes, DH always said it was good if it had a little less ricotta.  And reducing to 15oz was perfect.  This will be my new go-to ziti!  Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly as listed. We absolutely loved it. I am a fan of baked ziti and must say this is the best tasting baked ziti I've ever had. You definitely have to love cheese but that's the whole point of baked ziti! Can't wait to make it again!

Good, quick, basic recipe.  I used 16 oz of ricotta and that worked well.  I also added Italian sausage which gave it great flavor.  My dad loved it and went back for seconds and even took some for his lunch the next day.  Loved it and well definitely make it again.

I used a little more ricotta than the recipe called for, and i absolutely loved it. i made this for the first time just a few weeks ago, and i had to make it again. the only thing i changed was, i put half of the pasta / sauce mixture in, then i put a layer of provolone, then added the rest of the pasta. it was delicious. the more cheese the better!

I made this an hour ago, and I am so pleased with how it turned out! Very rich, even though I used fat free ricotta.

Okay, full disclosure: I didn't really follow this recipe's measurements, just the cooking instructions. So I used about 3/4 package of pasta, 14 oz of ricotta, and about half a cup of mozzarella. And I made my own sauce.

BUT I would have never thought to use an egg, and yet it made a world of difference from my previous baked pasta attempts! Yay!

I thought this tasted good but my husband loved it. I used "Homemade Fresh Cheese" for the ricotta cheese and "Brian's Favorite Sauce" for the spaghetti sauce. It made much more than 1 pan. I was able to make 1 full pan and 1 full loaf pan.

I made it according to the recipe except used low fat ricotta.  I loved the taste, but the results were not creamy.  The texture was more granular, perhaps because of the low fat Ricotta.  Very quick and easy to make, a great weekday, no-meat dish.  Plenty of leftovers.  I think it will taste better tomorrow.

I was not sure how I'd feel about the final product as I usually substitute cottage cheese for ricotta in lasagna but I went ahead and bought the big container and made it according to the recipe and it was surprisingly great with the sauce mixed in!  I did not add all the mozzarella because my bowl wasn't big enough but I did add some garlic powder to the cheese/ziti mixture.  Then I layered the mozzarella on top of it in the pan.  I mixed ground turkey and veggies with the leftover sauce from one jar but I had to buy two jars anyway since I couldn't find a 32 oz one (all the ones I saw were 25 or 45).  Since my meat/veg sauce was overflowing in the pan, I ended up having to add the extra 1/2 jar of sauce as a layer on top of the meat sauce.  I also added an extra layar of mozzarella with the parm on top.  I'm surprised at how much I liked it and it is definitely better the next day.  Just make sure to use at least 32 oz of sauce rather than just one normal 26 oz jar!  Very good and besides the need for a large mixing bowl, very easy to make.

My husband pretty much followed the recipe as provided, with a few differences (only reason I didn't give it 5 stars)  He added some seasoning (salt, pepper, fresh oregano, italian seasoning, garlic powder), and didn't put quite as much tomato sauce on the top (I think next time I would, though).  We also used pennette instead of ziti, since that's what we had.  An excellent non-meat recipe!

My entire family loved this!  Made it as directed, and chose to use a local favorite for the sauce - LaRosa's original spaghetti sauce.  Kids wanted it in their school lunches, so I warmed it up and loaded-up their little thermos jars, and boy were they happy!

Made this the other night.  Very delicious.  I took the advice of other reveiwers and only used 15oz of Ricotto cheese and next time will use the full amount for this recipe.  I did use 15oz of ricotto cheese, mixed with one can of drained spinach, and added italian seasoning.  My husband complained that this was too much spinach, however, I think it was just that it was not enough ricotto cheese. I did also layer, sauce, pasta, ricotto mixture, mazzerella, sauce, repeat once more and top with remaining bag of mazzerella and parmesean.

Used less ricotta, only because I bought the wrong amount but seemed to be plenty!  Also, I used my own sauce instead of store bought.  Everyone enjoyed!  Will make this again soon!

I followed this recipe except I added some powdered garlic to the cheese mixture for flavor.  I am not a big fan of very "saucy" ziti so the amount of sauce was perfect for me.  I will cut back on the ricotta cheese next time though. It was a little bit too much for my personal taste. But the recipe was great and we will make it again.  Nice serving size for a dinner party!

I altered the recipe quite a bit.  I used one cup of shredded, low fat mozzarella cheese, one-eighth a cup of cream to the spaghetti sauce, one-quarter cup asiago cheese, one medium onion diced, and a 14 oz can of artichokes.  I made it for 6 people and every body loved it and asked for the recipe!

This was great! I added italian sausage which meant there wasn't quite enough sauce after it was all done, but I just heated up some more and then poured it over the ziti on my plate and it was very good. My daughter loved it without the extra sauce and the leftovers heated up nicely. I also added some marinated fresh mozzerella cheese balls that I had in the fridge and needed to use and it was a nice touch. This recipe was easy and fairly quick to make! Thanks!

This recipe is good but I will definetely make some adjustment next time to better suit our taste.  It came out too cheesy for us and not too acceptable for my hubby who needs to be on low fat.  I will follow some of the other reviews before I will make the next time, other than that it is still very good.

I made this as listed and didn't look at others suggestions before I cooked.  It was a little to dry for us.  I would add more sauce next time.  Otherwise it was bland but not bad.  Cheesy.

This was edible but had a couple problems.  One was that it was pretty boring.  The other was that it had too much ricotta and not enough mozarella.  I'll look for a better recipe.

I made it almost exactly to the directions and added sweet italian sausage.  I didn't add sauce to the cheese mixture - just dumped it over the top of the pasta and it was a hit.  Will do again.

I attempted this recipe for the first time and now everyone thinks I am an awesome cook. I only used 15oz of ricotta which I think even then I could have used less. Also, someone suggested to hold out some of the mozz cheese and then when adding your layer of sauce, add the remaining mozz cheese then. Still this is a great dish.

I agree with the others who reviewed this recipe about only adding one container of ricotta cheese.  I also recommend Rao's Marinara Sauce if you are going to use jarred sauce.  It is a bit pricey, running about 7-8 dollars a jar, but well worth it.  Also, I had to bake this dish about 45 minutes in order for it to be cooked completely.

An amazing dish!  As I've noticed recommended I added the spinach and the chicken and I also reduced the ricotta and mozzarella. Simply fantastic, even my 5 and 2 year old could get enough of it.

Really good.  Only used 15 oz of ricotta cheese and used more sauce than it called for.  Started with sauce, then mixture (only put 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese in) and then topped with sauce and then parm and then the rest of the mozzarella.  Broiled for the last 4 minutes on low.

Easy to make and everyone loves it!  I try it with different sauces to change it up.  I usually always add some browned italian sausage for a full meal.  You don't have to add all the cheese and it's still just as good.  Freezes well!

Very good. Nice to have a meal without meat once in a while. My only change was I added a teaspoon of Italian Seasoning. Be Aware! You need a very large bowl to mix this in. A medium bowl won't work.

This was good.  I agree with some of the reviews to reduce the ricotta cheese.  I will be making this again with the slightly altered recipe.  I think I might add some meat to it as well.

Wow, everyone loved this one! After reading some other reviews complaining about too much cheese, I reduced to 15 oz. I now wish I hadn't because although it was still VERY cheesy, it was dry aroud the edges.

Wow! This was very good. I admit, I did add browned ground beef (I cook for carnivores), some mushrooms and some garlic, but this was a fabulous meal. Definitely not too much cheese, either! It made a ton, too - I had to use an extra pan. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I followed the recipe as written and it was on the dry side, and also a little bland. If I do make this again, I'll add more sauce and definitely some spices.

This came out very satisfying for me with some modifications.

I added 1.5 lbs of ground turkey and 1 lb of chicken apple chardonnay sausage from Trader Joes, which I browned in olive oil and made my own meat sauce. I suggest even if you use a canned sauce, adjust the seasoning until it has enough kick

I cut the ricotta in half as suggested and also doubled the mozzarella. I did a layer of sauce, then ziti mixture, then more sauce, then mozarella and parmesan.

I only baked for 20 mins.

Made this last night and it was very good.  I ended up browning 1 lb sausage, as well as sauteeing some mushrooms with garlic.  Added those into the mixture with ziti, ricotta, and mozz.  Put the mixture into a pan lined w/ sauce and dumped more sauce on top. Covered with mozz and then foil and baked for 30-35 minutes.  I took the foil off for an additional 10 minutes to brown the top and it was awesome.  Keep in mind that if you add extras in like I did, make sure to add extra sauce as it soaks up quickly!

Good recipe.  We added 2 lbs of regular mild breakfast sausage, which I browned before adding to the ziti/sauce mixture.  Also used about 1/2 as much more sauce as the recipe called for.  We all liked it.

It was good... I followed the recipe exactly. I would have to say I have had better. I will make again but will make some changes to the sauce and the amount of cheese. A little too cheesey for my liking.

We loved this. I made it exactly to the recipe with the exception that I undercooked the ziti by a couple of minutes and added some Emeril's Essence seasoning. I also served it with additional sauce on the side for those who wished it (most partook). This is will be a keeper, not only in my household but in a larger meal ministry for whom this was a test run. Thanks!

loved this recipe.  I made it for a teacher appreciation luncheon at my daughter's school.  There was none left.  Everyone loved it.  I will be making this for my family get together since I have two vegetarians and there is no meat in this dish.  Meat really won't be missed.

It was good, but I probably won't make it again.  I was expecting it to be more gooey.  For our personal tastes, I think it had too much ricotta cheese in it that made the texture all wrong.  I also think it needed a little more sauce and some spicing up.

This was a hit! Made a lot of very delicious food - cheesey and filling, quick and easy! I used a little less ricotta (they only had 16 oz in the store) and added a little more mozzarella on top with the parmesan and it was perfect. Good as leftovers with a little spaghetti sauce on top and great for dinner with some garlic bread and a nice green salad. Yum!

Very good, and very easy.   Could improve with a bit more spice/taste.  May be due to canned sauce.  I made with garlic cheddar chicken from the sight for a really filling meal.

Awesome! Nice and cheesy, easy, cheap, delicous! What's not to love?? It was too much to fit in one pan though, and be sure to use a large mixing bowl to combine all the ingredients!

This recipe was very easy to prepare and used usual ingredients that are easily available at the local grocery.  I was very pleased with the taste.  The next time I make it I will add additional spices due to the spaghetti sauce I used did not have much spice to it.  Great recipe.  I will use it again!

This is a very simple ziti recipe that was a big hit at my daughter's birthday party.  I've had lots of ziti dishes and this is as good as any (at least when it comes to meatless varieties).  Simple and good.

This recipe came out very good.  I cut down the ricotta to a 15oz container and it was plenty.  I also used a little bit more sauce than the recipe called for because I didn't want it to come out dry.  Lots of leftovers too.  Will make again for a quick weeknight meal.

Really quick and easy ... both my boyfriend and I loved this dish ... if he goes back for seconds I know I have a winner (and he actually went for a small 3rd portion) ... next time I might try to add some Italian sausage to make it more lasagna like ... definitely a keeper!

This was very tasty.  I followed the advice of others and cut cooking time on ziti in half and used extra  spaghetti sauce.  This will definately make rotation on our family menu. Thanks for sharing!

Made this for a group watching the football game.  It was a hit with all that tried it.  Even tasted great next day rewarmed.  This would also be fantastic with hamburg or sausage in it, but is perfect just as is.

I thought this turned out quite nicely. I followed the recipie almost exactly except that I only added half of the mozzerella to the ricotta mixture then used the rest on the top of the sauce. I also added some italian seasoning and garlic powder to the ricotta mixture.  Next time I make this I will use my own marinara sauce because I think it is more flavorful than jarred marinara.

A lot easier than lasagne, but the same great taste, minus the meat.  I added some Italian seasoning, red & green bell pepper flakes, and Parmesan to the cheese mixture.  I reserved some of the mozzarella and topped the pasta with it, then sprinked some pizza seasoning for a finishing touch.

Very good - added hamburg, hot sausage, some garlic and onions; didn't adjust the ricotta at all. Total comfort food and really easy to make.

Fabulous! The only thing I did different was added ground beef, onion and used cottage cheese instead or the ricotta because we don't like the texture of ricotta. Will make this instead of lasagna when in a time crunch.

This was great. Easy to make, cheap, and great reviews.  I added leftover baked chicken.  Will be making it again.

Yummy!  This was a nice, easy, recipe, and I agree with a previous review - Do not make this unless you love cheese.  I reduced the sauce by about a cup and put some mozzerella on top.  It was so good, even the kids ate it!

We really liked this recipe. Next time we'll probably cut it in half, because for 2 people this made way too much food! Great for an informal dinner party.

AAA-mazing! So easy, so delicious! Only change i made was to add seasoned ground beef with chopped onions into the sauce, mixed all together, and put it into a casserole. Topped off everything with mozzarella and provolone. Served with baby greens and my own garlic bread. Just the recipe I was looking for! Thanks for the post!

As written, this recipe needs work. But,  when you add a little more sauce and a type of meat, it's great! This does make a ton!

I made this for a dinner party of only 4 and it was almost devoured right away.  It turned out amazing and was so easy to prepare.  I will make this again.  It was loved by all.  True Italian taste.

We loved this! It was delicious! In my family there is no such thing as "too much cheese" I even added a little extra Mozzarella cheese on top and they all gobbled it up. I am actually making it tonight for the second time! Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome! I made my own sauce, lots of flavor there, so the adding a lot of cheese (lowfat and fat free) did not take from the flavor. Very Easy, failry quick, lots of leftovers, and my husband LOVES it! (I used fat free cottage cheese instead of ricotta)

Very good.  I quadrupled the recipe for a birthday party and I got many compliments.  I only put in 3/4 of the ricotta cheese and only 1/2 of the motzarella, but I still liked it a lot.

I should have listened to other reviewers and used less ricotta and more sauce and added some more seasonings.  I will make this again but with those changes.

I used the recommended cheese and I thought it was way too much. It was rather plain with too much cheese flavor and not enough sauce flavor.  For leftovers I added more marinara sauce and it was fantastic.  I will definitely take every one elses advice and use less cheese next time.

This is a great baked ziti recipe. However, I made the following changes:
I mixed two 24 oz. jars of spaghetti sauce, a half a can of pizza sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, and some italian seasoning to make the tomato sauce.  Instead of only adding 1 1/2 cups of spaghetti sauce in the ziti, I used 3 full cups. I only used 16 oz. of ricotta instead of the recommended 24.   I also used part skim ricotta cheese and 2% mozzarella cheese. 

This recipe was fantastic. Using the part skim ricotta and low fat mozarella makes it an easy, delicious, and relatively healthy meal.

Easy and delicious. I made the recipe without any changes. However,I'm sure that if you were in the mood for adding ground beef, ground turkey, or italian sausage the recipe would turn out great as well.

Delish!  My children said that they liked this better than lasagne.  Since it takes a whole lot less time to make than lasagne, it is also a winner with me.  I did add minced garlic, a pound of browned ground round and some italian seasoning.  We will definitely be having this regularly.

This is a good recipe for a basic vegetarian ziti.  It's not bursting with flavor, but it has a nice mild flavor and is just fine with some bread and salad.  I used 2 26 oz. jars of sauce and thought it had the right amount of moisture.  This makes a ton of ziti, so next time I will half it for my family of 4.  Maybe it freezes?
