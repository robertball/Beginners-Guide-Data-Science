I am the author of this and I boiled mine in batches of 5 for about 3 minutes/batch. I brought a large pot of water to a boil and then turned it down to low so that the raviolis didn't burst from the rolling water. I'd love to know how they come out baked so if you try this please share the results!

Love this recipe, I did bake mine at 350 for 15 to 20 min. I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta because my husband is allergic to it and mixed it with 8 oz cream cheese I also made my own ravioli dough very good

I give this recipe a 4 only because I honestly believe it needs more hamburger in it... as much as I love cheese ravioli, I do love to bite into meat also.  I did as others did and added 8 oz. of cream cheese to give it a bit of sweetness.   I made homemade spaghetti sauce to put over it.  I baked mine and next time will boil them as I didn't really care for the crispiness of the edges.

I have rated this once before and this still gets five stars.  But, having done this once again.  And having followed the recipe I ran into the same problem the second time.  I followed recipe to the tee.  I  used Nasoya All Natural Won Ton Wrappers 12 oz for my wrappers!  As the recipe is stated, I used exactly 3 ea 12 oz packages of the wrappers.  So, plan accordingly. I had to make an extra trip to the store mid-way though.  They are still excellant and I will continue to make them.  Back to the store tomorrow for more wrappers as tomorrow will be making them with spinach. I take a few days a month for cooking for freezer storage so I can be a lazy cook when I want too.

These tasted very good and were easy to make, although a little time consuming.  I used 1/2 lowfat cheese and 1/2 regular.  I boiled mine for 5 minutes.

This was "The Best" ravioli that our family has ever had!  It does take a little bit of time to put together, but was worth the time.  We made the recipe as written, I wouldn't change a thing.  We made the dough in my food processor and it turned out wonderful.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone that wants to try ravioli, my boys are meat eaters and if I were to make cheese ravioli, they would be asking for the meat sauce, with the beef in the ravioli, they were satisfied.  It still is a delicate pasta, try it you won't be dissappointed.

These are SO good!! I served them with my home made sauce and it was delish! The ONLY thing I added was 8 oz of cream cheese. It gave it a bit of a sweet taste. (This was in addition to the ricotta) SUPER YUMMY!

It was good, but if you didn't get them out quick enough the skins fell apart.  I read on the won ton wrapper to bake at 375 for 10-12 minutes or until brown.  I am going to try that way to finish up my mixture.

AMAZING! so easy and so tasty. i added a little sausage in mine with the beef. I then served them in beef broth like a soup kind of, very good.. I also would like to try these in a sauce of butter and sage. I think that would be very good.

Although the recipe didn't instruct to do so, I ran the cooked beef and onion mixture through my blender just to pulse it where it was not chunky. I also used fresh pasta dough and not the wonton wrapper. It didn't have enough flavor for me. I think using an Italian sausage would be amazing though.

This was absolutely fabulous.  My husband LOVED them, and he is a big fan of toasted raviolli so to get him to say "I will run to the store for stuff if you make more".. WOW!  My boys even helped with making these and loved the wonton wrappers.  Innovative, easy, and delish.  Can't ask for more than that!  ***ALSO, we fried ours in veggie oil and topped with spaghetti sauce.. cruchy perfection!!

Sounds awesome, but I agree with previous question. Do you cook the ravioli in boiling water or bake? Want to make it!

I tried something slight different. I used my own pasta and used this for the filing. my hubby is critical and honest when I try new recipes. When I asked him to rate this on a scale of 0-General Taos (his fav) he gave this an 8 and asked me to make it again! that was huge for him! he loved the flavors!

Loved this idea. I used portebella mushrooms instead of ground beef. It took longer to assemble than I thought. However now that I know what I am doing I'll do it again.

These were better than I expected.  I was not sure about the won ton wrappers but what a great idea!  I cannot wait to try some variations These took longer to prepare than indicated, but maybe I was just slower.  I served mine with a pesto sauce.  yummy!

Delicious! Leftover meat mixture is great as a sauce with some added marinara over pasta!  Boiled mine in a pot of water with EVOO until they floated.

I followed this recipe to a "T" as far as the filling goes, and that's what it's really about so I feel fair in rating.  I did not use wonton wrappers but instead made my own pasta dough for the ravioli as I make ravioli a lot.  This filling was so good and creamy!  I really liked the amount of garlic and the fresh parsley gave it a tiny bit of color and just a touch of sweetness.   The filling made a lot so I managed to freeze some for another time.  Easy and delicious!

I used one pound of hamburger instead of 1/2 pound but didn't change anything else. I got 28 ravioli & they were delicious. I boiled them & scooped the first batch out with a slotted spoon but this left too much water on the plate. The second batch I poured them into the strainer but most fell apart. I will try again.

These were really great!  The only change I made was adding more beef as one other reviewer suggested.  It did make more than 30 but that was just an added bonus :-)  Made homemade marinara sauce and had some sourdough bread on the side and it was a wonderful meal.

Made this entirely from scratch for dinner for my Hunny!!!  I did substitute Mozzarela cheese for the ricotta and seasoned the beef while browning off with a hodge podge of toasted spices in the warming oil.  Probably never be able to duplicate the seasoning, but the raviolis turned out perfect.  Just when you add them to the boiling water make sure to not overfill them or they will burst and dump their contents into your boil water.  Definitely a do again recipe from the thumbs up Hunny and my son both gave the results.  I used the site recipe for the dough too, so it was a complete scratch meal about 2 1/2 hors start to finish...

Delicious!! I had a little extra time so boiled and baked. My husband & I both agree baked is better. Changed to actually recipe were as follows: white pepper to taste, smoky salt to taste, used ground turkey instead of beef.
To bake, 350 for around 9 mins, just til the edges brown. Before baking I washed them with a light coating of canola oil, mainly because the wontons looked a little dry.
