A really good recipe  IF you adjust the  amount of black pepper.  My husband, the pepper fanatic, noted that there was way too much of it in this recipe.  Now I know to use less, I think this recipe will be a keeper. I may add a little more liquid too.

My husband & 4 boys all devoured it. It will definitely be going into rotation in my house. The only thing is that I may go just shy of a full tablespoon of black pepper. Otherwise, it was spot on & perfect!!

Made this yesterday to have while watching football. The only thing I did different was that I used a large flat iron steak. I was hoping for leftovers to have for lunch today. There weren't any. It was all eaten in a flash. I'll never make stroganoff any other way. Delicious!

I loved this recipe.  All in one pot, very few dishes.  I think the previous reviewer didn't use all of the mushrooms and didn't note that you have to add more liquid if you don't.    I had no liquid problems, but like she said the flavor is outstanding!    Must be the vermouth, so good.

Made a few changes but really like the end result. I left out the mushrooms as I don't care for them but added more beef & extra broth as someone recommended. Skipped vermouth as did not have any.

This recipe just did not work. The noodles were hard, not cooked. I think there is not enough liquid to cook the noodles. The dish had decent flavor. If I try this again, I will cook the noodles in boiling water serve the stroganoff over the noodles.

Substituted beef broth for chicken broth. And Worcestershire sauce for soy sauce. And tenderized my beef. This is the BEST thing I've made in my instant pot. Absolutely delish! Thanks so much for the recipe!

We wanted to love this recipe, but it had no flavor. The recipe was followed and all ingredients, except flour, pepper and salt were purchased fresh. After reading some reviews about it being thick, a little extra vermouth and beef broth were added because we wanted it to have a creamy texture. The noodles ended up too al dente. This was an expensive flop for us.

Flavor was good, but it was too dry. Not sure what went wrong.
