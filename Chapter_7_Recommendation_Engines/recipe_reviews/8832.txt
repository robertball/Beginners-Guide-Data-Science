Hubby doesn't like creamy sauces so when I sent him out with a grocery list that included heavy cream, he asked, "What's this for?"   After telling him I needed it for the sauce for this chicken dish, he rolled his eyes and said, "Oh no - please don't make a creamy sauce..."  ;-)  I made the dish and and he really liked it (and the sauce)!!  I enjoyed the flavor as well and was surprised as it's so easy to make!  I made one change: I browned the chicken before baking it with the sauce. I think that was better.  Will keep and use again for sure!

This has been a family favorite since I found it on this site over a year ago.  We've made it thighs and with boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  I prefer the thighs.  My hubby prefers the white meat.  My toddler loves both.  I serve it with rice and salad.  Spooning the sauce over the rice is mandatory.  Very yummy, and the house smells so incredible while it's in the oven.  Thanks for a wonderful family favorite

Very Good! Curry isn't one of our favorite spices but it was great in this recipe.  Chicken was tender and juicy.

I made this for guests, and left out the curry because they don't like curry.  It was scrumptious!!!!  I'd definitely make this one again!!

I was short on time last night, so I cooked this in the microwave.  I seasoned the chicken and put it the microwave at 60% power for 15 minutes. At the end of 15 minutes I had finished making the sauce.  I poured that over the chicken and microwaved (still at 60%) for another 25 minutes.  It was really good!  I served it with rice and peas.  It was a real hit!

Easy entree with delicious flavor.  I used boneless, skinless breats straight from the freezer.  I prefered to shred the chicken into bite size pieces to serve.

This is a very good and easy recipe.  I seasoned the chicken breasts before I browned them which made them just a little more tasty.  I will make this again.

This recipe was wonderful! So rich and yummy! We love curry and find that a lot of recipes are simply not very good when cooking with this unique spice. The chicken was not only delicious -it was moist and easy to prepare. The only reason that I gave it a low mark in the children friendly rating is because I do not know very many children who actually like curry (only my youngest likes it). Thank you for sharing this with us. We will be making it often.

My family LOVED this recipe! It's by far the best curry dish I've made. The curry flavor is tamed by the cream and apple, but is not masked. Super delicious. I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, cut into portion-sized pieces, and I seasoned and browned it before baking. I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, just because that's what I had. I will definitely be making this again. SO YUMMY!

This was just ok.  I ate it but wasn't wowed by it and my husband said the same thing.  I doubt I'll be making it again.  I'm thinking we are just not big fans of curry, so I don't think it's fair to rate this really low, so that's why I put it right in the middle.

Used 15% cream and 4 bone-in chicken breasts. I browned the chicken slightly. I baked for 1 hour.  It was good for a once-in-a-while type of recipe

This is a great dinner.  The apple and onion mixture is fabulous.  the apple takes out the strong onion flavor!!  My wife really enjoyed this meal.

Fantastic recipe!  We were a little skeptical at first due to the myriad of flavor combinations.  It turned out great.  We used only a pound of chicken breast since we were cooking for 2.  We had so much sauce that we decided it would be great over rice and lentils or naan bread.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I generally don't use curry powder as I prefer to mix my own spices, but I gave it a try, and the result was wonderful!  There was nothing left over.  I know this will be a regular in the lineup.

This recipe is just too good!  The sauce is awesome and is good over everything from rice to potatotes to vegetables!
I did not have the cream so used 1% milk and it was still great!  Will definitely make again.

This terrific recipe has become one of the dishes I like to make when we have company.  I add quite a bit more curry to it than the recipe calls for.  Makes a wonderful slightly sweet curried chicken.  I serve it with coconut rice.

This was a wonderful dish. Made exactly as written. I cut up chicken into bite size pieces before baking. I used chicken breast this time and the chicken was very juicy. I may try thighs next time just because I love dark meat. We put this over rice and it was a hit with everyone, including kids. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

We LOVED this! I used chicken breasts and halved the recipe. Instead of heavy cream, I used 1/2 C of 2% milk as I didn't have any heavy cream on hand. And instead of Cream of Mushroom soup, I used my own powdered "Cream of Something Soup Replacement Mix." I was worried this would be dry, so for the first half hour, I left the chicken covered with foil while baking. Then it went for 45 minutes uncovered. I also shredded the chicken in the dish, then let it cool completely and stored in the fridge until dinner time - it was rather soupy straight out of the oven but giving it all that time let it set up a bit. I can't believe how rich this was, especially considering the 2% milk replacement!!! Will make this again FOR SURE!!!
