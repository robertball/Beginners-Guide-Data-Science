I'm giving  this four stars because I thought the pumpkin to cool whip ratio was off. I added more pumpkin puree which turned these little treats into five stars.

These look lovely  in presentation and so easy to make.
I agree about the pumpkin to whipped cream ratio commented on earlier. A bit more pumpkin is perfect.
