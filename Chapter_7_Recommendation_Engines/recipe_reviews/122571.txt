Used over a rhubarb pie recipe from this website, and everyone ate it up! however, never time i might add some butter so that the topping is crunchier after baking (as opposed to still powdery in some areas)

What a clever idea to have stored away! I often make fruit crisps or baked fruit and it is quite convenient to have this stored away. I used this on my baked apples. I used some oil and some apple sauce instead of the suggested butter - and it got crispy and delicious!

I mixed up 1/5 of this recipe for a small fruit crisp and it was still 1/3 or so too much. Very easy and good though.  For the filling, I used 3 cups of frozen cherries and boiled them on the stove with 1/2 cup of sugar and 3 T cornstarch until thickened... I'm just not a fan of pie filling.

JUST served this at an office function, and it went over so well!  I made 1 with blackberries, raspberries and blueberries, and the other I added strawberries.  The one without strawberries I used a Vegan Butter Substitute, because the person it was for is allergic to animal products.  It was basically a shortening, and I couldn't taste any difference between that and the real butter.  After baking them last night, the crisps were in the fridge overnight and reheated in a toaster oven in the office to be heated up.  We served them with fresh Whipped Cream, and some had them with Vanilla ice cream.  They were a HUGE HIT!  And I've got plenty of topping left over to make more for a party this weekend, and for anytime I want something sweet!  
FYI on the combining dry ingredients: The bowl was large, and it's a lot of stuff, for first time-ers who might not be sure, just get in there and mix it with your hands.

Yummy!  This recipe is almost exactly the same as mine.  I also make up a large batch and store it in a plastic container.  It's soooo convenient!  When my kids started going off to college & had apartments of their own I'd give them a batch, along with instructions for adding the butter & baking instructions.  So simple and so good!  I've editted this review because I NEVER rate it soooooooo low...  I intended to rate it as a 5.  I'm new to this rating business, and somehow I messed up.  My bad...

This is so close to what I'm looking for! Does anyone know of a crisp mix that I can send my college-dorm bound daughter so that she could make crisp in a coffee mug in her microwave. I know that without the oven she will miss out on that wonderful texture and crispness but I'm betting the close appoximation of such a wonderful thing will be heaven to her!

Thank you so much! I'm a cook, not a baker, but my 4 young grandsons love baked desserts (ok, Nana loves them, too. Sue me.) I'll be making a crisp for them soon, and will have YOU to thank for their smiling faces. So simple, always on hand. What could be better?  You rock!

I reviewed this 4 yrs ago and I wanted to update my review. Since that time I have used this recipe w/wonderful results every time! I use 2 cups of the crumble mix w/about 2 TBL of Butter for a 13'9 inch pan. I have used it when it had been in the freezer for a year and a half and it was just as yummy as when it was fresh! I do scale down the amount that I make at a time to 31 so that I don't have to much for to long! I hate to waste! But it is so darn easy to put together! Like another reviewer said a 16 serving size is perfect for a cake pan and an 8 is perfect for a pie pan! All that ease and it is delicious, too! My family's favorite is the peach and apple crisps that I make all year long because I freeze when the fruit is in season! YUM!!

Love this! Added a little nutmeg. Delicious. Stored it in a mason jar. Perfect.
