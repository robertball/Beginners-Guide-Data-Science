Most excellent!  I must admit the first time I made this I nixed the "southwest flavors" (cilantro, chile powder, etc.) as I was after a more classic cioppino -- turned out great! I was truly impressed!  Second time I completely followed the recipe -- and it was brilliant! If the fish weren't so bloody expensive I'd make it more often...*grumbles*...

This is definately company-fare!  Try enhancing the southwest flavor by adding the juice of 2 limes to the broth.  I also "Atkins-it" by increasing the carrots and celery by half and eliminating the potatos.  I have also used canned whole baby clams when the fresh ones in the shells are too expensive.

Wow, what a knockout!!  the great thing about this recipe is that you can use whatever seafood is readily available. I used rockfish, scallops, shrimp, crab and clams. Increased the amount of tomato juice and white wine, added a cup of water and nixed the cilantro and chili powder (didn't want any tex-mex flavors) I threw in a can of progresso clam sauce just because it was sitting in my pantry forever! The 2 hour simmer time is way long and unnecessary, I did mine for 45" and it was just perfect! This makes a TON of soup and I could have eaten it all by myself...yummy!

Awesome soup! I used cans of diced cut tomatoes and Rotel Tomatoes and Green Chiles instead of the 28 oz. of crushed tomatoes.  I liked the added chunkiness, and the added spice of the Rotel tomatoes.  Excellent.

Tastes great, my changes were salmon instead of halibut, dried parsley, no shelled mussels or clams used shelled razorneck clams.  I think that you could use half of the seafood amounts and still have a great dish.  This isn't spicy, so you could increase the garlic and pepper.

Tried this recipe the first time back in February or March and thought it had too many ingredients. The funny thing is I followed the recipe to the letter and was not disappointed. The flavor is complex and many of the ingredients very subtle. We just made this recipe again recently for guests. They already liked my cooking but now they think I should "Go Pro". Thanks for sharing!!!

We are from Colorado where Cioppino is not familiar.  Our family had never had Cioppino and loved it.  Pricey, but great recipe!

Made this as a second main entree for our Thanksgiving dinner, and it was an ABSOLUTE DELIGHT!! :D  I added a little bit more red pepper, some paprika, and tomatoe juice (V8) for a more soupy broth, which went perfect. Honestly, it is HARD to go wrong with this recipe!  Very easy to prepare and Very easy to enjoy as well :)    Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for the recipe Becky. I have always wanted to make a Cioppino for my husband. We had family over and the Cioppino was a hit.

This is an excellent recipe. I did add an extra can of tomatoes, 4 cups of tomato juice and 4 bottles of clam juice only because we like more liquid. Very good recipe. Thanks

This is an excellent basic recipe, which I would assess at 4 1/2 stars, if I could. I cannot, however, give it a full five stars, because I found it to be rather blandly spiced. That surprised me, particularly as it's said to be inspired by the flavors of the southwest. No problem, though. After tasting the finished result (made according to recipe amounts), I just doubled the amounts of cayenne and chili, while also adding about a tsp. of our favorite seafood blackening spice mix, and a liberal grinding of black pepper. The result was terrific -- not over-the-top spicy, but it had that definite kick to it that my family loves. Over-all, this is certainly a "keeper" recipe and we all look forward to savoring it again.

Excellent of course given the ingredients!  Two most important tips I can think of are use only the freshest seafood and DON"T overcook it!!! I added red/grn bell pepper to onion/garlic.  I also doubled the amount of seafood and added fresh dungeness crab.  served w/ good crispy french bread and passed on the salad (and I'm a big salad eater!!!).  just didn't want to waste the space on greens.  AWESOME!  In fact making again this weekend.....

This is an absolutely phenomenal recipe.  It is expensive to make, but it's certainly worth it.  I did not use any chili powder or crab.  I put in a small lobster tail and cod (instead of halibut), used only 1/2 pounds of clams and mussels to save a bit of money.  Finally, I doubled the cayenne - we really like our Ciopinno to have a nice KICK!  I served it up with sourdough bread and brut champagne.  It was awesome!  10 STARS!

I'm sure this will be frowned at but I add a couple of tablespoons of butter and about a half a cup of 1/2 &1/2 at the end of cooking to help cut the acidity.  Insanely good.

I followed the recipe pretty well. I omitted the potatoes and cut back on the heat. I added Orzo and had some snow peas that needed a home. Both were nice additions. I think a strength of this is the flexibility it allows

Made this recipe last night and just loved it! Super easy and super good taste. No real changes from the original recipe. Looking forward to making this again.

I halve the recipe and have made it many times. The only things I've added was roasted Hatch chilies when in season because I just couldn't help myself. (I add Hatch chilies to pretty much everything when they're available.) This is a great recipe, vetted by a friend from SoCal.
