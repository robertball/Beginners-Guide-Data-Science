This was absolutely scumptious!!! I made a couple of changes, however. I used brown rice and used more rice than the recipe called for. I did not use jalepenos because I didn't have any. I added some garlic as another reviewer suggested, and also 1/4 tsp white pepper for a little kick. I also added about half a cup of jullienned carrots, which I sauteed with the onions. They were delicious! I topped it with bread crumbs, too. And I actually omitted the cheese entirely, but the good news is I didn't miss it AT ALL - if you're trying to cut back on calories, don't be afraid to leave out the cheese! It's the kind of recipe you can really play with to suit your tastes - wonderful, I will be making it again and again!

This was wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly only substituting real shredded cheddar for the processed cheese. I also covered the top in shredded cheese. Wow! we loved it. I am sure this dish could also be made without the hot peppers and still be delicious for those who don't like their food with a kick. Thanks for this delicious recipe!

This dish was amazing!  I'm not a big spinach fan, but I absolutely loved this!  I used fresh spinach sauteed with garlic & olive oil and cream of mushroom soup.  i have made it a few times now and everyone raves about it.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

I thought this was an excellent dish.  I did not have the peppers so I added a  little garlic, however, I did feel that it would have been better with some kind of topping on it...maybe some buttered bread crumbs. I will make it again.  Everyone in my family liked it.

Until I learn how to edit my own recipes I will write a review.  I usually use 1 cup of uncooked rice.  If I don't have fresh jalapeno, I add jar jalapeno to my liking.  More milk may be added.  I am a "taste as you go" cook, so it's hard to get the measurements right.   Hope you all enjoy!

This was very good, Creamy and it had a lot of flavor.  I used cream of mushroom soup, since I didn't have the cream of chicken on hand.  I also added about a cup of cooked lentles left over from dinner the night before.  It gave the rice a nice richness with the spinach. Even my husband liked it and he doesn't care for spinach much at all.

Delicious!  I used creole seasoning instead of jalepeno peppers.  Tasty, cheesy, and delicious.

This was awesome!  Super creamy and flavorful.  I made quite a few changes, based on what I had in the kitchen.  Subbed cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken.  Subbed brown rice for the white- followed the cooking recipe on the bag, and used a full cup of uncooked rice.  I had fresh spinach that needed to be used, so I chopped it and added it to the onions until it wilted.  I used about 6 cups of fresh spinach instead of the frozen.  I also used a shredded combo of cheddar/jack instead of the processed cheese.  Yummy!

Delicious!  I used chicken broth instead of water. Instead of cubing the cheese I  cut it in thin slices and put half the spinach mixture in the dish, then layered it with the cheese and then topped it with more mixture ( this method gives it a more gooey cheese taste and looks nice).  I also took the advice form another reviewer and added carrots, topped with bread crumbs and additional cheese. Turned out great and everyone really loved it.

It was good, but it took to long to prepare and make. I feel like just cooking the rice and adding spinach and cream of chicken would have been just as good in the end.

YUM!! I didn't have any jalapeno's so omitted them. I took the advice of one poster and sauteed some carrots in with the onions. Added a nice color. I also used fresh spiniach and real cheddar, cubed. I tossed that in just as it went into the oven. Super easy and so yummy! Will definately make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

At first, I wasn't too sure about the jalapeno but the heat turned out to be very subtle and this dish tasted delicious.

One of the best! Added a bit more milk as I thought it was a little too thick.  Tried to be easy on the cheese - used one slice of processed chopped up and grated a bit of brick to mix in as well.  The jalapenos were perfect. Only had 1/2 pkg of frozen spinach so also cooked up and used a pkg of fresh.  Put everything together the night before, covered with foil ready to pop into the oven the next day, took foil off half way. Wonderful!  Thank you.

This was super good. I like HOT food so I left the seeds in the Jalapenos, which I would not recommend unless you can handle the heat.

I have nvr had anything like this b4 but I had some fresh spinach I needed to use so I found this recipe. I just cooked it in a microwave vegetable steamer and spread it out to dry on a towel while the rice cooked. I used garlic in place of onion since my husband hates onion. I also used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken b/c I am vegetarian. And brown rice instead of white and real cheese shredded as per suggestions here. delicious!

REALLY REALLY good; we frequent restaurants which serve a similar baked cheesy spinach/rice dish; this would rival any of those. I would highly recommend using real shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and topping with panko breadcrumbs before baking.

WOW! This was amazing! I did tweak it a little for our tastes. I used fresh spinach and added it to the onion half way to tender, added a tablespoon of minced garlic and halved the cheese with shredded cheddar and Monterrey Jack, then sprinkled some cheese on top to brown. My husband will not eat spinach and this was a great way to get some in him. He loved it. I will make this often!

Because I have little ones, I couldn't use the jalapenos.  Per the suggestion of others, I substituted them with garlic.  I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen.

Everyone enjoyed it.  There weren't even any leftovers.

Even though I had to use what was available in the kitchen this is a great combo of ingredients and I will have to get the peppers for the next meal. I used fresh spinach, wild rice, cream of mushroom, white onions and gouda cheese. Thanks it went well with the roasted chicken!

I made this today, but made so much modification based on the other reviewers.  The star 2 is based on the original, as it would have been 2-star had I made this without modification, this is why: I would definitely increase the amount of rice to 1 cup for 6 servings (1/3 cup is simply not enough for 6). I would also increase the milk to 1/2 cup, not 1/4 cup for more smooth texture. And then, modify the amount of salt accordingly based on the liking.  1/2 tea spoons of salt for 1/3 cup rice mixture is way too salty and unhealthy to me, considering the fact that salt is already in the soup and cheese on top.  Also I think 1 can of soup mix (10.75 oz) and 4 oz cheese for 1/3 cup rise is not the right proportion, need more rice.

Delicious!  I made a few small changes to suit my family.  I used 1 cup of rice instead of 1/3.  I also didn't bother to add the rice to the skillet.  I cooked the soup mixture and spinach in a pot on the stove.  I then poured this mixture over the rice in the baking dish and mixed in some mushrooms.  I then topped it with mozzarella cheese (instead of the processed), and Italian bread crumbs.  I will definitely be making this again

I followed this recipe exactly, except I used about 4 cups of fresh spinach and topped the baked dish with Mexican Cojita white cheese crumbles. The one thing that I would change is that I would cut way back on the salt, or leave it out altogether. Otherwise it was a great dish.

This was very good. Made this last night, and my husband cleaned his plate. Made w/fresh spinach and mushrooms as well as cream of mushroom soup and wild rice medley. Wilted the spinach while I sauteed the mushrooms and onions. Delicious!

Wow, this is great! I made a couple changes to accomodate for the ingredients I had on hand. I used cream of celery soup, used green bell pepper and hot red pepper flakes instead of jalapeno's and a tablespoon of cream cheese instead of the processed cheese. Very flavourful and rich!

Loved this dish!  I made minor changes though - I added garlic - feta cheese and used cream of mushroom soup (that's all I had)to the mixture.  My husband loved this and my son ate all his portion even though he was sick.  It's a keeper.
Thanks

Very yummy and spicy.  I cut back on the amount of jalapeños and it was still pretty spicy.  Loved it!

This was very good.  I love spinach so I am always on the lookout for great ways to prepare it. Next time I might simplify it by using the Mexican Velveeta and leaving out the jalapenos.  Loved the spicy flavor with the spinach, I was pleasantly surprised.

Awesome. I used jarred and drained jalapenos... and I would definitely use less next time or fresh jalapenos.

Except for omitting the jalapeno peppers, adding 2 small cloves of garlic, and a bit of milk before baking (because I mixed it the day before and much of the liquid had been absorbed) I prepared this for a Thanksgiving get together. Some people thought it was a casserole...Others thought it was a dip.  Everyone loved it.  Received several requests for the recipe.

ELI3LEG thank you!!!

I made with fresh spinach and more rice.  I also only had pickled jalapenos which worked ok, but could have been left out if you don't want spice.

This recipe turns any spinach hater to a spinach lover.  I've made this dish as stated and it was awesome.  It is even better with cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken.  You can even make it kid friendly by omitting the jalapenos (we like this the best).  This is a great Holiday recipe for the entire family.  Thank you so much for sharing.

It was great and easy. I used fresh spinach and added it to the onion at the end of cooking. I also added a couple of small carrots. I would suggest mixing the soup, milk, and peppers in the skillet with the veggies to reduce the amount of dishes. It worked just fine.

Used fresh spinach, cream of mushroom soup, brown rice, maybe 1/8 cup of "jalapeno salsa", no salt, no cheese, no real jalapenos.

Loved it!!

Super good!  Used jasmine rice because that's what I had, and for the same reason used shredded cheddar. Used Tabasco jalapeno sauce because I didn't have peppers. Served this with Mexican fish and black beans. Both recipes from this site. Better than any Mexican restaurant!

This is good! I omitted jalapeno's as I don't like them and used 1 cup brown rice (cooked in 2 cups water for about 30 minutes before adding to everything else). I had about 9 oz of fresh spinach that I pureed in my Vitamix and mixed it into the rice mixture and used shredded cheddar instead of cubed cheese. I really like this and think it's a great way to get in some extra veggies to my families diet! I would omit the salt next time, with the cheese and soup it really isn't needed and tastes a little salty to me. Since I used brown rice it wasn't fully cooked even after the baking time, so next time I'd just make sure my rice was fully cooked before mixing together and baking. :) My son who "hates" spinach said it's "awesome". Yay! :)

This recipe is so great! I made a few changes- skipping the onion sautéing and just addinginced onions with rice. I mixed everything right in the baking dish as well. I doubled it and jut used a 16 oz bag of spinach. I also used cheddar instead of velveeta, as we prefer the cheddar. Very creamy and delicious- my spinach hating husband even approved! Thanks!

After having this awesome meal at my sister-in-law's I took it home to show the fiance. I learnt from her dish to half the blcok of frozen spinach (I froze the rest for a second meal). I also doubled the rice, but used a wild rice medley instead. I used grated swiss cheese to complement the chicken cordon bleu II recipe on the site that we were having for the main dish. When the cook time was over, I added a thin layer of swiss and cheddar cheese on top and broiled it until the cheese browned. It was absolutely fantastic!

We picked this for dinner tonight only because we were missing one ingredient for the recipe we'd originally planned (found the 2yr old dumping an entire container of parmesan onto the kitchen floor this morning!).  Pleasant surprise - it was great!  We omitted the jalepenos but used about 1 Tbsp of diced green chilis as our family doesn't like much spice.  Used sour cream instead of milk, and topped the baking dish with crushed Ritz crackers & a sprinkling of poppy seeds instead of butter.  Served with broiled chicken and it was GREAT, even the 2yr old ate well.

Yummy! The only things I did different was I doubled the amount of rice and I used brown instead of white. This got my 8 year old (and myself) to actually eat our spinach! The 4 year old was skeptical but she ate some. DH absolutely loved it. I will be making this again I am sure.

This recipe was a hit in my house.  I used canned jalapenos and tend to have a heavy hand with anything spicy but everyone ranted and raved.  I followed the recipe for the most part and only modified a few things.  I did add a can of quartered artichokes that I diced and tossed in.  I also just used shredded cheddar but thought it would be a nice addition to put shredded parmesan in as well.  I only did a small amount of the parmesan in the mix, but did spread a good amount on top of the dish right before baking!  It came out so wonderful and I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe, but used about 3 cups cooked rice (Zatarain's), 3/4th's of a bag (9 oz.) of fresh spinach, 1/2 small green pepper (don't like jalapenos and didn't have any green chilies), and added 1/2 cup julienned carrots and used garlic powder. I cooked the carrots and green pepper with the onions and spinach separately. I sprinkled the top with cheese instead of adding it to the mix. It was delicious. This recipe is so versatile. A real keeper. Thanks!

Great recipe! Simple ingredients, quick & easy - a nice change from basic rice. I followed the recipe but didn’t have jalapeño so I used pepper jack cheese to substitute for the peppers and processed cheese. Really good with just a little bit of kick! Will make it again and again.

I used orzo instead of rice (its what was in the pantry), also used fresh chopped spinach, shredded cheddar cheese (don't buy processed cheese). No jalepenos because it was for a family get together, but did top it with crunchy breaded onion pieces. and sour cream instead of the canned soup. It was a five star hit with everyone!!! vegetarians, those with chewing problems and healthy eaters! will make it again and again.

I pretty much followed the recipe but I did have to make a couple modifications. I didn't have any jalapenos so I added a can of diced chiles. I used maybe 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese (processed, ugh) which I didn't really think it needed. I had a zucchini I had to use up so I added that which my husband commented that it gave the dish more texture. Next time I'll add some other veggie. Maybe broccoli; and I added fresh spinach.
It was a little on the bland side so when I make it again I will have to do something a little different.
But overall, not bad.

Loved this, but made the following changes based on preference and ingredients on hand. Added mushrooms that were sautéed with the onions and garlic, used shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and added panko breadcrumbs as the topper.  Was very hearty and easy to play with.  The second time I went to make this my toaster oven blew on me before I was ready to pop it in the oven, so I simmered on low, stirred frequently to prevent burning (15-20 minutes or so), and it turned out great, the only thing missing was the breadcrumbs!

I made this last night...instead of the cream of chicken I made a roux and added 2 cups of milk and a cup of sour cream. I didn't put in the oven to cook. I thickened it on the stove top in my cast iron. I also used a jar of jalapenos...about 4 slices. Kids loved it!!

Very nice! Everyone enjoyed this. If you have some peas in you freezer, I recommend adding adding some when you add the spinach-  very tasty addition to a lovely recipe.

This recipe is easy to make and it is delicious.   I added sautéed fresh herbs, and more rice.   The family loved it.  I will be making this again for sure.

This is a great recipe, and very quick. I doubled it and used barley instead of rice. Instead of jalapenos I just put in a chopped bell pepper and put in some cayenne. I used real grated cheese. Turned out delicious!

I had leftover rice from the Chinese takeout, I used that.  I had about 1/3 of a bag of baby spinach which I sautéed with the onions and about 1/3 of a package of Velveeta cheese which I cut into cubes.  It came out perfect and I used many of the ingredients I had leftover.  I will definitely make it again.  Maybe using different leftovers.  I'll let you know.

This was really good.  I cooked the rice in chicken broth for a little flavor, added garlic at the end of cooking the onions and added shredded cheddar rather than the processed cheese. I removed the jalapenos as I'm not a fan of hot spice.

This is an easy recipe to adapt to suit your taste, groceries on hand, cooking skill and/or laziness factor (lol). I used 2 C cooked rice, one can Cream of chicken soup, one can of cheddar cheese soup, and one can of evaporated milk. Very yummy.

I followed this recipe and I recommend omitting the salt because of the chicken soup, cheese and pepper makes this dish good. My husband liked this dish as well as myself and we both agree it was too salty. I also used fresh spinach in it instead of frozen and that's what made it good. I am giving the recipe 3 stars because of the salt added in without the salt I would give this recipe 4 stars

My family and I love this meal. We make it over and over again. I cube cheddar or Colby Monterey Jack cheese. I also eliminate the jalapeño pepper and onion and replace with a chopped red pepper. Even the kids love it. Quick and easy.

I make this regularly now without the jalapeños. I use 1 cup rice and 2 cups chicken broth instead of water. I also use marble cheese. I've tried it with cream of mushroom soup as well. Very tasty!

This was delicious.  I was surprised that my picky family loved it.  I read thru some of the reviews and read where the submitter of the recipe actually uses 1 cup of uncooked rice so thats what I did too. I used one cup and adjusted the amount of liquid.  It made just enough without having any leftover.

To be honest, I didn't think much of this dish as I was making it but I have to admit, I was delighted with the results. Pretty tasty! I omitted the cheese and used fresh spinach but, other than that, I made this recipe to specs. I'll throw in some garlic next time for more flavor. 4.5 stars/will make again. Thank you for sharing!

Pretty good. Used about 2-3 cups cooked rice. I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, diced chicken and on top I sprinkled bread crumbs. I also did about 1 cup onions

This was extremely good but as most commenters said, I did alter the recipe. I substituted some garlic for the jalapeño and used cream of onion soup instead because that's what I had in the house. I also left out the cheese which was a good choice because as much as I love cheese, you really don't miss it at all. Very easy to make and really yummy.

I used one cup of cooked minute rice, about 4 oz sharp cheddar, 2 oz parmesan, 1 t crushed garlic, minced onion, cream of mushroom soup (these were things I had on hand). i also skipped the skillet part since I did not use fresh onion.  Delicious side dish!

This was a lot of work, and it was a little disappointing. You end up using a lot of dishes too. Made exactly as recipe says and as i was making it realized it was a ton of chicken soup and velveeta for the amount of rice. I love creamy dishes but this is just too much.

Creamy, cheesy, and spicy!  What more could you ask for?  I made this almost exactly as is, but added an extra cup of rice and topped it with shredded cheddar cheese before baking.  I also only added the chopped jalapenos to half of the casserole so my little ones could eat it, too.  Next time I'd like to try it with garlic like others suggested, but overall, delicious!  Thank you!

This was ok.  I had leftover cooked rice so I used 2 cups of that.  Even so, there was too much spinach for this recipe.  Maybe half?  And I don't think the processed cheese did anything for this recipe.  If using, make sure to stir it about half way thru baking. If I were to make this recipe again I would leave it out.

This recipe is a keeper. Like most, I took advice and changed it. But with spices, mine came out to taste just like Uncle Ben's Original Wild Rice-- which my family loves! So I feel very grateful to the person who posted this, and I got the spices from another place on line. This is what I used: 
•	1 1/2 cup uncooked long grain wild rice 
•	½ cup of regular white rice
•	2/3 cup water 
•	1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted (or any kind of creamed soup)
•	1/4 cup milk 
•	2 tablespoons butter 
•	1/2 cup chopped yellow onion or green onions
•	1 (12 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach 
•	1 teaspoon dry chopped onion flakes 
•	1/2 teaspoon dry parsley flakes 
•	1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 
•	1/4 teaspoon onion powder 
•	1 teaspoon ground turmeric 
•	1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
•	1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 
•	1/2 teaspoon black pepper 
•	1/2 teaspoon salt 
•	2 cups chicken stock 
Cooked it according to wild rice package directions.
Man that was great rice!

This recipe was really great.  I made a few substitutions:  I used Campbell's Cream of Chicken Mushroom soup.  Added an entire container of sliced mushrooms (sautéed with the onion), omitted the jalapeño, and since I'm not a fan of processed cheese, I topped everything with a layer of breadcrumbs and shredded sharp cheddar.  Delicious!

I made it as directed and it was just OK. It's too cheesy and not enough rice for me.  I used canned diced jalapeno and fresh spinach.  I think I'll stick with just sauteing it with garlic.

Made this for Easter because we like spicy food.  It was very good we did add more rice like the other reviewers did.  We avoided the cheese and used a bread crumb topping. Very good, thanks for sharing this recipe

Delicious! I made it with a whole cup of brown rice instead of white, and I substituted shredded cheddar cheese. Since I didn't have any jalapeños, I substituted about a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper - it had just the right amount of kick!

Super easy! I wanted to hide some spinach in my bf's lunch, so I whipped this up before work one morning. Subbed mushroom soup, vegetable stock for water, cream cheese for cubed, and added some paprika, chili powder and what turned out to be too much red pepper flakes (half a pinch is enough!). Also added grated carrot and diced zucchini with the spinach just before the onions were done sauteeing. Definitely crumble something crunchy on top! I used crushed rice crackers because it's what we had, but literally anything works - Doritos are insane.

I love, love, love this recipe!!! I make it with original laughing cow cheese instead of the orange stuff since I don't keep that on hand. I too add more rice and love to throw some chicken or turkey in it from time to time! If you're into happy eating this is definitely worth a try.

I loved this recipe! Here are the changes I made for a hearty and scrumptious meal: 1) cooked the onion in butter and 1/2 inch of water, added chicken sausage until cooked through; 2) used shredded colby/jack cheese combo and added the cheese to the skillet mixture just before baking; 3) used 1/4 teaspoon cayenne and 1/4 teaspoon ancho chili pepper powders instead of jalapenos. This recipe turned out great and I will be nibbling on it all week! Thank you!!

This is a keeper!  Just delicious.  Only changes I made were using 1 jalapeno pepper instead of 2 and substituting shredded cheddar for the processed cheese.  Tastes vary, but we found that 1 jalapeno pepper gave it plenty enough of a kick.

This recipe was good considering that I don't cook too often. I added some beef (cut up into bite size pieces). Tasted Great!

This is a great dish..it reminds me of broccoli and rice casserole..I used Minute brown rice instead of white rice and for the cheese I just add veelveta. My husband and I loved it.

I didn't have a can of soup so I added a combination of plain yogurt and sour cream.  I spiced it up with a little garlic salt, parsely, celery salt and dry mustard.  I also added some garlic to the onions. Also used cheddar instead of processed cheese. Delicious and my husband loved it.

Awesome and delicious! My husband commented several times about how good it was, saying it was the best spinach he'd ever had. No processed cheese food in the house, so used medium Cheddar.

I had a lot of rice and a lot of spinach, so I decide to give this a try. I didn't have any peppers, so I just used more seasonings. It came out pretty good, although a little to cheesy for me. But I think with some garlic bread this would be a great treat!!

It was good, but no one else in the family wanted it again. Not picky eaters.  I will make it for myself again though.  Thanks

i made this as a main dish with cheddar instead of processed cheese, and about 1 1/2 cups of leftover rotisserie chicken, shredded, and the whole family loved it.  I have 3 kids, ages 10, 6, and 3, and these people are not easy to please!  I will do this again, with more rice next time because it did just seem like a side dish with chicken added.

I made a variation on this the other night and WOW did it go over well.  Even my notoriously picky brother practically inhaled it.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and cooked with olive oil instead of butter. I omitted the jalapenos, but added chicken, artichoke hearts, and mushrooms.  I also topped it with crushed up cheese garlic croutons.  Fantastic!  Making it again tonight!

I found this recipe delicious, I didn't add the cheese and used brown rice instead of white. It's healthier, and still delicious.

Insanely delicious! I was really surprised how well this came out! I used sunflower oil instead of butter for less calories. I followed everything else, but instead of frying the rice on a pan before hand, I used use some already cooked left over white rice. Came out great! My whole family loves it!

This was amazing!  I tweaked it a little to suit.... I used 100gms of rice and cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  I used about 2 teaspoons of finely chopped pickled jalepenos and added 4 sliced mushrooms, 2 crushed garlic cloves and a dash of cayenne.  For the cheese I mixed in grated mozerrella and then put a thin layer of mozzarella over the top, which came out nicely browned.  I served it with lemon wedges and my partner and I loved it! I may try it with some crumbled feta added next time.

Loved this! The flavor was amazing, enough said. Next time I'll use less jalapenos for those in the family who can't handle the spicy. Will make again!

We really liked this recipe. The end result was very good but I changed some ingredients to fit what I had in the pantry. I used basmati rice I recommend this over plain white, then I doubled the rice amount because it just wasn't enough for my family, I also doubled the milk but still used one can of soup. I added mushrooms , garlic and some green onion that I sauteed. I used regular cheddar cheese instead of processed. It was scrumptious! I will make this one often.

This was ok. It wasn't as tasty as I thought it was going to be, but it was a nice healthy side dish for the chicken we made.

I doubled this recipe, but NOT the spinach.  It was perfect.  I also used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of chicken.
Will definately make again.

Excellent.  I used a bunch of fresh spinach rinsed and pulsed in the food processor.  I used 1/4 cup mozzarella and baked for 40 minutes.  
Will make again, often.

Very, very good. I changed the recipe a bit. I sauteed fresh spinach and onions first. I didn't have any peppers, so I used pepper jack velveta cheese.  My 6 year old loved it!

This was a very nice dish.  We all enjoyed it.  I took a shortcut, and used minute rice.  Also, used mexican velveeta cheese.  Turned out just fine.  Very spicy.  Thanks for the post.

This was an excellent dish which my husband really enjoyed. We used fresh spinach from the garden and vegetable stock water instead of chicken broth and it was still very yummy.

We had to use jalapenos from brine since we were unable to obtain any fresh ones and I think we may have used a bit too many as it was quite hot/spicy after it was baked!

You could change this recipe in many ways and it would still be very yummy. Next time I'm trying mushrooms instead of jalapenos.
