Made this as a whole "Taco Pie" and the family loved it!  I also used beef instead of turkey, cuz that's what I had, and served it with taco toppings on the side!  Great recipe!  Plan on making the "mini" ones for the Super Bowl tomorrow!

My family loved these.   Sometimes I use ground beef with taco seasoning if I dont have any turkey on hand.
