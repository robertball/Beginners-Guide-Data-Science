My husband said this is the best tuna melt he has EVER had. And I don't know anyone who likes tuna melts as much as him, so I was impressed! The best advice in the recipe was to broil the bread both sides and then take out and top with tuna, cheese, tomatoes, etc. In the past we've always had problems with the bottom of the bread being too soft. So thank you for that hint! Also, I love the idea of layering cheese, tomatoes, cheese. It tasted so good (even though the tomato made it a bit juicy to eat - it was worth it) Now, the only addition I have to your recipe is to put a little bit of fresh chopped garlic in--it enhances the flavor to perfection!

YUMMO!! I've lived in Jersey all my life and being that our state has more diners than any other in the nation, I've eaten in many, anywhere from Bergen County down to Cape May County. I order these great open faced sandwiches all the time. The thought of adding vinegar to the tuna never occured to me and I must say that it was a great addition. I skipped the salt (tuna alone has tons) added red onion and much more mayo. I'm not crazy about melted swiss, so I used my favorite Vermont cheddar. I'm a tuna nutcase, so this was the PERFECT lunch for me today! So good Linda and thanks!!

I'm a New Englander, so I've never had a Jersey-style tuna melt before.  This was amazing!  I will definitely add raw onion and wine vinegar to my tuna from now on.  I recommend to everyone out there to keep the vinegar.  I had to use sharp cheddar instead of Swiss, but it was still fantastic.  Thanks for a great recipe!

One of the best tuna melts my husband and I have ever had - we love it! I use whole grain bread instead of rye bread and american cheese instead of swiss. Tastes delicious! I've made this recipe 3 times in the past 2 weeks already! Great with chips and fresh carrots and celery.

Good use of red wine vinegar to avoid dry tuna as opposed to adding more mayo, which can taste terrible.  I liked this.  Didn't use rye though...used Italian rolls (toasted insides on a griddle) and baked in a low-temp pre-heated oven for a few minutes to melt cheese.  Very good.

This is the Best Tuna Melt!  The red wine vinegar definitely makes the tuna salad.  I didn't have rye bread or swiss cheese so I used a whole grain bread and cheddar cheese combo.  Simply delicious!

This tuna melt was AMAZING!!! The tuna salad had perfect flavor. I was nervous about onion in tuna but it was delicious. We used both Swiss and cheddar cheese and it tasted just like the sandwiches served right here at diners in the Garden State (I am from NJ)! Serve it up with chips and a dill pickle for a super-tasty meal. The tuna salad is delicious enough to be eaten by itself!

Man were these fantastic! I loved the upscale taste of this twist on an old classic. I didn't have red wine vinegar so just used balsamic and it was just fine. I also hate tomatoes so left them out without a problem. My only suggestion...make as much as you can!!

These were very good.  I used different cheeses to each family member's taste.  I also used Texas toast bread, since I didn't have any Rye on hand.

As a tuna melt lover, had been looking for a good recipe - and this is it!!  After tasting original recipe, I felt the mixture was a little dry so increased mayo to 3/8 cup.  Also, the flavor "needed a little something" so added 1/4 t Old Bay seasoning.  With these 2 tweaks, the sandwich was diner "blue plate" quality.

Extremely tasty. Make sure that you toast both sides of the bread before adding the tuna, tomato, and cheese. Also, feel free to use any other cheese/bread. It will be delicious! Vinegar is a nice addition that I wasn't used to.

This was my first time to make a tuna melt!!!!!! and decided to prepare it for friends for lunch.  Everyone loved it and definitely the Red Wine vinegar makes a big difference.  Also rye bread enhances the flavor.  Even my husband like it and he really isn t keen on canned tuna.

So delicious! Believe it or not this was my first attempt at making a tuna melt [I'm a new cook :-)] and it was so easy! The key ingredient was the red wine vinegar, so yes, do not leave it out! I served this for my boyfriend with sweet potato fries, which we both agreed was a great accompaniment.

I made these last night.  They were good but having read the reviews I was expecting much more.  I followed the recipe but didn't have celery, just omitted it since we don't care for it any way.  Tasted like a good tuna sandwich but nothing more.  I won't go to the trouble of using the broiler again for a tuna sandwich.  I normally put mine on toast with a slice of tomato, which I would say is equal in taste to this recipe.

Struck with late night beer munchies, I surveyed the kitchen and thought a tuna melt sounded good- but mayhap, I thought, the interweb could show me something more exciting than the grilled cheese with tuna that I was contemplating.  Which landed me here. I didn't have everything on hand to do the exact recipe- no tomato, winged it with Tillamook cheddar and a 12 grain bread- but it was really good and I look forward to doing it again with rye and swiss. There is an excellent depth of flavor with the vinegar and aromatics dancing around the hearty, earthy tuna/toast/cheese. More than the sum of its parts- really nice recipe, thanks for sharing.

Adding the vinegar to the tuna salad is fabulous. I wasn't sure about it, but took away that slight off flavor of canned tuna. Simple, tasty, quick and inexpensive.

Wow!!! I never thought of using red wine viniger for a tune salad - I'm SO hooked! This came out delicious, and I didn't even have the celery, and had to use dry parsley.
My oven has a Hi and Lo broiler setting, I used the hi. Broiled the bread for one minute on each side as someone suggested, and did one slice with provolone and one with baby Swiss - the Swiss won hands down. On the hi broiler setting 3 minutes was the perfect time to cook this.

The red wine vinigar, onions and celery really made the tuna salad delish! I used Texas garlic cheese toast instead of rye. Topped with the tuna, tomato and swiss after baking the bread.

Growing up, a tuna melt was a hamburger bun half topped with tuna mixed with a little mayo and a slice of american cheese which would be placed in the oven for a few minutes until the processed cheese melted. This recipe looks like royalty by comparison and I can't wait to try it. Will upgrade to five stars if it tastes anything like it looks.

This was amazingly delicious.   I used Muenster cheese instead but OMG great, especially cause I used really red fresh tomatoes, etc.  WOW.    The only thing I disagree with in reviews in that NJ diners are the best. I say they are 2nd best...to New York diners.  Growing up in Brooklyn, had tuna melts like this with french fries with brown gravy on the side...ohhhhhhh wowwwww.  I am hungry, want another sandwich.

This IS the tuna salad sandwich that I eat at a deli and crave at home.  If anything, I have been enlightened to the benefit of red wine vinegar added to a tuna salad recipe.  If you like sweet pickle relish in your tuna salad, it will still work here....I've done it!  

I do believe rye is the very best bread for a traditional tuna melt.  But, I have experimented with other cheeses like cheddar and dill havarti with wonderful results.   I also have to say that caramelized onions takes this sandwich to a crazy good level!

Definetly Delish! Preheating the oven is really important, otherwise cheese melts tuna stays cold. Also next time i think i will be sure and toast both sides of the bread. I did put cheese on bread then tuna then tomato then cheese. Had it with Baked Potatoe Soup, super filing for "Soup & Sand" dinner.

One of the best tuna salads I've ever had.  I opted to forgo the tomatoes and it was still terrific.  One note, when you are using tuna the pouch variety that is solid (not chunk, light) is the best quality and you will certainly taste the difference.  The solid tuna is from the loin section and is far better than what you would get with the rest.  The pouch is superior because it allows preservation at lower "canning" temperatures than traditional cans.  This results in better flavor and texture.  Alton Brown has a lot to say about the subject if you're ever curious.

These are addictive and soo easy.  I find myself making them all the time.  I put my bread in the toaster while the broiler is heating up.  I find that it's an easier method for crisp bread.

Yummy tuna. I did not heat it and it was still really good. I do not know if I have ever had vinegar in my tuna, but it added nice flavor- not overwhelming.

Very very good!! I didn't have rye bread so I just used whole wheat! Great, quick sandwich on a chilly night! Loved the crunch of the celery.

Delish! Instead of using rye bread, we used 12-grain we had on hand. We also didn't include tomato, as both my fiance and I don't like it. We used pepperjack instead of swiss too. Def the best tuna salad ever! It will become my staple recipe for sure!

lovely recipe, I've had melt sandwiches before but never made one at home, this was a great one.  I left off the tomato since I didn't have any and switched out the rye bread for a sandwich thin and swiss for provelone.   nex time I'll definitely try adding some tomato since it sounds nice.

I loved it!  The only change I made was one of necessity...Provolone slices instead of  Swiss.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  The tuna itself was so good I'll never make tuna salad any other way.  Thanks for sharing.

I made the tuna tonight.  I'm leaving it in the fridge overnight to let the flavors - esp the red wine vinegar - soak up.  I got 3 5oz cans and adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly.  I'm a garlic gal also so I added some minced garlic like some of the other reviewers.  from what I tasted it's pretty darn good.  I like that you can actually taste the other components without all of the mayo of the store bought versions and I'm a mayo freak so that means a lot!  Thx for the recipe!

The absolulte best tuna melt I have ever had - at home or anywhere else!! Followed recipe exactly, except broiled the bread on both sides before topping with the tuna mixture. Can't believe I've been making these on a griddle for all these years with ho hum results. Wow, such an amazing improvement. Thank you!!! *Update* Since my original review, this has become my regular tuna salad recipe - for melts and cold sandwiches. Markets now carry pre-toasted bread, so I make a batch of this salad and take it to work for fast tuna sandwiches a few times a month. I've shared with many thankful co-workers - most now have the recipe!

I liked the tuna base, but it was better cold than warm. I didn't have rye or gyuvere so I just used wheat bread with american singles the first time, then sharp (stinky) cheddar the second time. I found that the stinkier cheese made a much better sandwich; it covered the fishier taste. This was easy to make in the good ol sandwich maker.

This was so good, and my husband said it was the best tuna melt he had ever had. I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: added 1 clove of garlic to the tuna, used low fat mayo, used 1 teaspoon of dried parsley instead of 1 tablespoon of fresh, and used provolone cheese instead of swiss. Also, I had made Jo's Rosemary Bread (from this website) earlier in the week in my breadmaker. Used that bread for these sandwiches instead of rye. 

I also followed another reviewers suggestion and broiled the bread on both sides for 1-2 min before adding the tuna and stuff. Wonderful. Will make many times again.

Mmm!  I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, so mine was made without celery, on sourdough, and with american "cheese" but it was SUPER yummy, easy, and totally hit the spot!  Will make again for sure (hopefully with the actual ingredients)!  I see this being my fall-back tuna melt.

This was okay, but I wouldn't make it again. Not the melt I was looking for.  But the tuna salad was good by itself for just a plain sandwich on white bread.

Good tuna, although I did change the recipe a bit.  I added eggs.  Two of them to be exact.  I did not use any celery.  I did more of a traditional sandwich...no tomato or swiss cheese and I used whole wheat bread

I really liked this, my husband didn't. I really liked it with canned chicken instead of tuna since I'm not a big tuna fan. and I forgot to get swiss cheese so i had to use cheddar, but i still enjoyed it a lot.

Best tuna melt I've ever had/made!  I put the rye in the toaster until slightly toasted first then topped it and put under the broiler to melt the cheese.  Outstanding!

Made exactly as specified, only used wheat bread. Thanks to you, cookingirllj, what was going to be a boring tuna salad for lunch today turned out to be a crunchy, moist and flavor-packed treat. Hubby had never had tuna melt before, and this was a great first taste!

It was good, no doubt, but it wasn't great. I would make it again though, but would make with bread and butter pickles rather than tomato.

Perfection! I did add a few tablespoons of diced red bell pepper to the mix, but it would be great without that, too. Love this for an easy weeknight dinner.

Although these were good Tuna Melts, they were rather ordinary and did not live up to all the spectacular reviews I read. The best tip I have is to be sure to toast the bread in your broiler about 2 minutes on each side. Then when you top it with the tuna salad, cheese and tomatoes, the bread does not get soggy. ALL in all, I thought this was nothing too special; just an everyday, plain old sandwich.

This is the best tuna sandwich I have ever had. It has changed the way I make tuna sandwiches for good. No longer do I ever load up on the mayo- the vinegar makes it so much better! I'm making it again tonight :)

Excellent! Easy. Started by toasting bread, adding ingredients one by one about every 2 minutes under broiler so everything got toasty. Also put two layers of cheese to melt the tomato etc. into place keep it from sliding off.

I am not a big fan of tuna fish (it's actually the closest thing to seafood that I'll eat), but since it got such great reviews, I thought that I would try it. I loved it! I used whole wheat bread, since I don't like rye, and didn't use tomato. I thought that the swiss cheese might over power the sandwich, but it didn't, and actually added a really good flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

I not a huge tuna fan, but I really enjoyed this dish.  The swiss cheese cut the taste of the tuna.  Next time I think I'll brown both sides of the bread and slice the cheese thinner.

My husband actually commented after he took a few bites that this was like restaurant quality! I added a tiny bit more onion to ours and used homemade sourdough bread from our breadmaker since neither of us are a fan of rye but otherwise followed the directions. After seeing some reviewers say the tomato made it soggy i pressed our slices between some paper towels to get the juices out before putting on the sandwich. Next time I'll try to use fresh parsley but the dried worked ok for us. Great recipe! Thanks!

Very bland & dry.  Kids HATED it, husband thought it was decent & healthy (which it is).  UPDATE: My review was edited to remove my recommended changes..."Could benefit from more mayo, addition of olives to mix & put slice of bacon under tomato b4 topping with second layer of cheese".  Hopefully this edit will not be cut as my other review was cut ;-(

This was so very tasty! I will definitely be making this again and again. I made one small tweek. I roasted the celery and a sweet vidalia onion for about 10 minutes before chopping them so they wouldn't be quite so crunchy in the sandwich. They still had a bit of crunch but were not overpowering the tuna.

This is a really good tuna salad recipe, I didn't make the melt sandwich yet. I love having another good recipe for tuna salad as an option. I don't think I would have thought to add the red wine vinegar on my own, but what a great addition. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I never had a tuna melt before and always heard about them, i usually just make regular tuna sandwhiches toasted. This wasn't to far from the norm, but it is really good.

Great meatless dinner item.  Only things I did diff is I had some hamburger buns to use up and also realized I did not have red wine vinegar, so I used apple cider in its place.  I toasted the buns in the toaster before I put the tuna, tomato and cheese on. I really am glad I did that because everything tasted as if it was grilled correctly and that way the top didn't get too brown waiting for the base to toast up. Next time I will try w/ the rye bread as I think that would be really good!  Husband said to make these again! Really good recipe, glad someone pointed me in this direction.  Had some leftover mac & cheese which is what we had with it for a good Friday Lenten dinner!!

It was very good as is, but I had to California it up the next time I made it!  I added a scoop of sweet pickle relish to the tuna and put a layer of alfalfa sprouts under the tomato slice to add a hint of bitter greens to balance the sweet relish..YUM!

This is a really good tuna salad recipe. I toast it on English muffins with a slice of cheddar cheese. Mmmmm. I think the red wine vinegar really adds to the flavor.

5 Stars, nothing less.  Looking for something to try and came upon this recipie.  Didn't have rye bread or Swiss cheese (used white bread and provolone cheese) and the family couldn't stop raving about it.  Even the Tuna haters in the house came back for seconds and thirds.  This was an excellent recipie!

I used Pumpernickel bread otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My wife was blown away and has asked me to "cater" this for her next girls lunch party. She loves a Tuna Melt and could not believe that the best she has ever had came out of her own kitchen!.

We loved this!  I made with Bumble Bee tuna, no onion, just a splash of vinegar, & added garlic, parlsey & paprika.  I made Jerry's on Country White & mine on whole wheat. Broiled 1 slice with cheese & other slice with tuna, then put them together. Use a little less mayo.

This was awesome!  I used lite mayo and added a bit more vinegar (to my taste).  I also used cheddar since that's what I had on hand.  Excellent!

I was amazed by how much I liked this recipe. My boyfriend asked for a tuna melt with swiss on rye, and I nearly gagged, but found this recipe which was exactly what he asked for. I hate tuna melts, I hate swiss, and I hate rye bread. Never eat 'em. Still, as requested, I made this recipe almost totally by the book (somehow lost the tomatoes on the way home from the grocery store!), and it was fantastic. The red wine vinegar and onion made the tuna much less bland than what I was used to from homemade tuna, and the swiss and rye were a great combination. This recipe has completely changed my outlook on tuna melts and expanded my taste buds - and it's so simple! If you don't like tomato, this sandwich is still terrific without it - but I will definitely make it again (and again!) and actually bring the tomatoes home next time. This is a fantastic, EASY, and CHEAP lunch.

I whipped these together tonight for dinner and was very impressed.  My husband loved them!  We did swiss cheese and american cheese, and the swiss was far better.   I don't care much for tuna, especially the thought of it being warm, but these were very tasty and I had no problem finishing mine.   Very good recipe... I will definately make these again.

Absolutely delicious! I omitted the red wine vinegar and parsley because I didn't have any. I used a slice of Swiss and a slice of extra-sharp Cheddar, and made mine with regular brown bread and Husband's with rye. Really really tasty! Thanks, Linda!

I’m shocked that so many people rated this recipe so highly. It was bland, I thought the parsley was a bad addition, and the Swiss cheese was oily. In my opinion it was not good, I couldn’t even finish it which is rare for me.

As a Jersey girl, I give this 5 stars!!!  It is yummy:)  I had to use different bread, because I just cant eat rye, lol.  Otherwise perfecto.  My poor family only gets Rye bread if we go to a diner, lol.  Loved it!  Made it for light summer dinner with a salad on the side.

This brought me back home to NY. This is exactly the sandwich you would find in the BEST Deli’s and Diners of  NYC and NJ. This was easy, inexpensive and a satisfying meal. Especially during Lent. Carnegie, Stage, Katz’s,Second Ave Diner, Kiev..... OMG I miss every one. Btw, making  the tuna the night before to allow the flavors to fix  definitely makes a huge difference.

Absolutely love this! The recipe for the tuna salad itself is perfect - great consistency, the onion & celery Give it a nice crunch.  I used the tops of a whole wheat hamburger bun because that was all I had, toasted it first in the toaster oven & then removed, added the rest of the ingredients on top & put under the broiler of my oven.  Also used American cheese because that's what I had on hand & prefer.  Soooo good!

A great recipe, and a real easy meal for the family.  One slight change I made is to add a little cayenne pepper powder into the tuna, it really gives it a nice little kick.

Love this recipe!  However,  I did make some changes to suit my taste (no tomato, cheddar cheese, buttermilk bread and made on my griddle by buttering the bread).

Excellent tip to flip and broil the bread! I switched a few ingredients according to what was in the house. Surprise-it was great! I mixed Albacore tuna, sour cream, celery, red onion, black olives and ready for this? Sauerkraut-leftover from Reuben meal. I put the mixture on french bread and topped it all with sliced Roma tomatoes and extra sharp cheddar cheese. Broiled. Weird but good.

I have a special place in my heart for New Jersey-style tuna melt sandwiches. My husband, daughter and I really enjoyed this tuna melt! I just made this recipe this evening and the first bite immediately brought me back to my childhood in NJ! DELICIOUS! I will be making this again very soon! Also, I love the addition of vinegar, which I have never added to a classic tuna salad previously; I enjoyed the vinegar flavor so much I doubled its quantity in the recipe. Thank you CookinGirlLJ!

As a poor college student exhausted after classes, this melt saved me from the imminent hunger that would have ensued. As I dragged myself into the kitchen, I started to reach for the old staple insta ramen. And then, I saw it: the huge can of tuna I had completely forgotten about for the past few weeks. But I didn't want just normal mayo-tuna infused slop on wet mushy bread. No, I was gonna fancy it up. This recipe made even a hopeless cook feel good, and the melt was fantastic. The red wine vinegar seriously makes the melt, and the Swiss cheese kinda cements it together in this gooey, crunchy, crispy combo that I absolutely adore. I'd give it more than just 5 stars if I could.

These were very good, but I think I'll add pickles & more onion to the mix next time, and put dijon on the bread, as I thought they were a little bland as is. I served them with "Dill Pickle Soup" & it was an easy, tasty dinner! Thanks for posting.

Excellent light meal for a hot night here in Pensacola!  I did use some ciabatta bread that I had on hand.  I broiled that until toasty and then topped with the tuna (made exactly as stated) and then the cheese, tomato, and cheese.  Baked that for about 10 minutes at 425.  The tuna was juicy enough, I was afraid it might be too dry.  I'll make this again for a easy meal on a hot night.

My favorite tuna melt thus far. The red wine vinegar makes it pop. The tuna stayed moist. I do use a different type of bread and cheese as I am not a fan of rye or Swiss, but that's a matter of personal preference and doesn't affect the overall flavor of the tuna. My husband and I always use this recipe when making tuna melts at home now.

The name says it all!  Loved this!  I've been stuck on the old boiled egg, mayo & sweet relish for years!  How refreshing to have a "light" tuna salad with a great taste.  Loved the addition of the red wine vinegar.  Thanks soooo much!

I took faith in the name "Best Tuna Melt" and had to try even though I didn't see any pickles in the ingredients.  I am so so glad I did try.  I love the addition of the vinegar.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic and it is still wonderful.  I can't wait to try with red wine.  I don't miss the pickles at all.  I made into a toasted sandwich with provolone as I didn't have any swiss. So good.  Thank you.

The 5 starts is for the recipe "AS-IS". It's amazingly tasty! I've made this several times after and personalized it. Here are my suggestions. 1] Add finely chopped cornichons, small French pickles 2] Add 1 tsp. HOT German mustard (like Löwensenf). 3] Replace salt with Seasoned salt. I put the tuna mixture on German Rye bread and alternated finely sliced tomatoes with Swiss Cheese. My mom adapted it and adds finely chopped green peppers too. BEST Tuna melt per friends and family. Thank you Cookinggirllj!!!

Wonderful.  I did lower the calorie load by using mostly Greek Yogurt mixed with a little light mayo and reduced fat cheese.  I am sure we couldn't tell the difference from the full-fat one.

This was amazing. I had already mixed up most of these ingredients earlier, as per my usual recipe (tuna, mayo, relish, onions & celery plus pepper, paprika and hard boiled eggs). But after taste-testing it about 30 minutes ago, found it bland and missing something. So I came here, searched through the various tuna melt recipes and found this one. I would never have thought to add vinegar. But I did, according to this recipe, and the difference was instantaneous. It's so much better that I have to resist going back and eating more! Thank you!

I am happy to say that I am somewhat responsible for creating the tuna melt in NJ many years. It was at the Rustic Mill Diner in Cranford, NJ. It wound up on the menu as the Happy Waitress Special and evolved to the tuna melt which can be found everywhere.

This is one awesome tuna melt.  My grandson gobbled it up, grandpa loved it too.  This is going to become a regular at our house.  We'll be trying the garlic addition and making a 1 1/2 recipe to make sure we have enough.

The recipe for the tuna salad makes a great tuna melt sandwich, but we didn't follow the open-face directions.  Instead, we pan grilled buttermilk cheese bread slices (recipe on allrecipescom), with the tuna and american cheese.  Mmmm.

I am not even a big fan of rye bread or tomatoes, but this recipe is amazing. I did not use the parsley, but followed the recipe exactly on everything else and it is a perfect blend of flavors!

I used regular white vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar, homemade white bread instead of rye bread, extra sharp cheddar cheese (shredded) instead of the swiss cheese and I didn't bother with the paprika at all. I also made it with solid white tuna and reg chunk light tuna and both work well. great recipe.

This was the most delicious tuna I have ever had! My husband doesn't like celery so I replaced that with chopped almonds but both would have been yummy.

I made one half of my sandwich per the recipe, and I added mustard, cucumber slices, and sprouts to the other half. Both variations were good. I recommend making the tuna salad the night before so the flavors can mix.

Best Tuna Melts Ever should be the name of this recipe. My family loves these and requests them for lunch on weekends. I use this recipe whenever I make cold tuna salad sandwiches too. During the week I triple the ingredients and make a big batch, but that still doesn't last long in my house. Thanks for sharing!

This is my go-to tuna salad recipe. I grew up on tuna, mayo, and sweet relish, so this is miles better. The only change I made was using white wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar because I didn't have the other on hand.

Very tasty and beautiful in appearance. I used whole grain walnut bread. I didnt have all of the ingredients (no celery, used dried parsley). I also added about 4 dashes of Tabasco and 1/2 tsp of cayenne for kick. Great idea on the layers.

Very good tuna melt, one of my husband's favorites.  The only thing I changed was the sliced tomatoes to grape tomatoes cut in half.  This is the second time I've made this recipe.  I had forgot how good it was and we were in the mood for tuna melts.  We always use Costco's albacore tuna packed in water.  We think it's the best.

I haven't made this as an open-faced sandwich yet - but it makes a great panini!  I used a small amount of chopped green onion instead of regular onion.  Brushed a bit of olive oil on the outside of the bread before placing the sandwich in the panini maker for a nice "grilled" look.  Easy and delicious.

Very good! We loved this for an easy dinner one night. But if you are feeding more than 1 or 2 people you need more tuna! I used 3 cans for 2 adults and 3 toddlers and it was all gone. I think next time I will ad pickles to.

The first time I made this recipe I followed the directions exactly and found it good, but not outstanding. The second time I made it I used 1 tablespoon of white wine because I didn't have vinegar. Instead of using fresh tomatoes I spread 1 1/2 teaspoons of tomato paste on each bread and then put the tuna mixture on top as described. This added a nice additional flavor to it that made the taste rounder and more interesting to me. I also like Munster Cheese better on it. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I just made these for lunch and my son and husband loved them.  I didn't have rye bread so I substituted whole wheat, chedder for swiss cheese and apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar.  Overall, I think it turned out really good.  I'm giving it a 4 star because I didn't try the recipe as written, but mine was really good, fast and simple.  All things I had at home on hand.

For a tuna melt, this is great, but it is just a tuna melt. Nothing new or spectacular with this recipe. I've made tuna melts since I was a young child. Usually on English muffins. They hold up really well on top of that type of bread.

This was great for a quick meal when my child brought an unexpected guest home with her for lunch. I had to make it a little more kid friendly - no onion and no tomatoes. Didn't have red wine vinegar so replaced with cider vineger - an no rie bread so used my homeade honey wheat - recipe from AR. They ate it up and there were no leftovers!

I'd give it 4.5 but my girlfriend gives it four.  I personally have never had a tuna melt, as I'm not a huge fan of tuna, but this was awesome.  I substituted jalepeno jack cheese and used hoagies instead.  Also added more onion and more cucumber.  Melts in my mouth.  Good recipe.  Maybe if I go to Jersey I'll have a real one.

My new favorite tuna melt. I always thought dill was the best, but I love this one even better.  The vinegar really makes it, that was new to me. I used low fat mayo, sharp cheddar (half of what recipe called for since it is so rich and full flavored) and served open face on whole grain english muffins.

I must confess, I never got around to making the melt part of this recipe.  My husband and I ended up eating the whole batch with saltines before we could.  What an amazingly simple and delicious tuna salad.  I can't wait to try it as a melt!

This was great! The bread had a good firmness and the vinegar in the tuna added a really nice touch. I will probably buy a very high-quality swiss next time I intend to make this, though.

So, so good. I've never had a tuna melt before, but today I had a craving for one. (I'm 8 months pregnant.) It was so delicious! I left out the celery by accident, and I used sharp Cheddar and Gouda and fresh French bread because that's what I had on hand. I also chopped up a dill pickle and put it in with the tuna (hubby and I always make our tuna salad this way.) I love it when the cheese gets slightly past melted and the top gets a little crispy and caramelized. The only thing I would change is to toast BOTH sides of the bread, as mine got a bit soft on the bottom, but that didn't make it any less delicious! Y-U-M.

I live in Jersey but i dont think this tastes like the diners' version.  I love the idea of red wine vinegar, i'll definitely use that tip from now on, but WAY too much Parsley for me.  It was overwhelming, and i love parsley!  Im always looking for new ideas for bringing lunch to work.  I made the tuna for lunch and brought wheat thins to go with it.  (the melt would be soggy by the time i got to eat it)

Wonderful recipe for a quick lunch or even a dinner. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so used balsamic vinegar instead. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe and it turned out GREAT! Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic recipe. This tuna melt was just what I was looking for. I used sourdough instead of rye and it was still perfect. I followed the recipe other than the bread.

Good basic tuna melt. Next time I will add a little more salt and about 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper.

The Tuna Melt turned out great. My Hubby liked it a lot! 

But I did add a twist to the ingredients. I added a bit of Dijon Mustard. :)

Very good! My daughter & boyfriend - although they "like" tuna - they really enjoyed this! I did add 2pc of crisped bacon per slice (under the first pc of cheese) - and layered the rest per instructions.  I will make this again!

I'm not a huge fan of tuna, but this was VERY yummy and my toddler loved it too! I made it last minute and didn't have celery, so I used celery seed instead, just a dab of mayo, wheat bread and sharp cheddar cheese. Tasty! I'm glad I omitted the salt, because I think the saltier cheddar made up for it and it was just right.

Instead of Celery I used 1 teaspoon of celery salt! 
And I don't have a broiler so I put it in the oven on 350* for 10 minutes. Open faced. LOVED it!

It was just alright. I made the tuna salad according to the recipe and it came out pretty bland. The final product tasted okay, but I think it was mostly the combination of cheese, tomatoes and bread. I hardly noticed the tuna at all. But I might try it again mess around with some ingredients to give it a little more spunk.

This might sound crazy, but this is the first time in my life that I have had tuna salad. It always freaked me out as a kid, but I decided I needed to try it now as an adult. It was delicious! I followed the recipe with a few exceptions: I used solid white albacore tuna fillets, half a clove of minced garlic, and red onion (and a little more than 1/4 cup.) I got a loaf of uncut white bread with a hard crust from the bakery that went just perfectly. My first experience with tuna was good, thanks to this recipe, and my boyfriend was impressed! ;)

I thought this was just ordinary. I followed the recipe closely except for adding some chopped, seeded cucumber to the salad mixture. I liked the idea of the vinegar, but I really couldn't taste it much in the finished dish. I guess I missed the sweet pickle relish, hardboiled egg and seasonings I usually put in my tuna salad.  Thanks for the recipe, but I think I'll stick with my old standard for future tuna melts.

I'm a long time tuna melt fanatic, and a Jersey diner addict.  This recipe is the first I've found outside of 24hr Greek diner that lives up to my standards and exceeds them.  Brilliantly done.  As a personal taste, I use a little bit less mayo.  Great work!

Excellent!  Everyone in my family loved it, including picky eater grandmom.  I doubled the celery (try to sneak in as many veggies as possible for my 5 year old) and used cilantro instead of parsley since we have some growing in the yard.  I also followed another reviewers advice and added 1 tsp Dijon mustard.

This was great for a busy weeknight. I had everything in my pantry and needed to use up some rye bread and swiss cheese left from patty melts. I modified the cooking method and buttered the bread and put them down on a stovetop grill and then placed cheese on each side. I heated the tuna mixture in the microwave and spread it over one side, topping with the other cheese toast. (I didn't add the tomato.) Then I turned the sandwich several times to grill it. Tasted great again the second time a few nights later. Makes 5 generous sandwiches.

I gave it 4 stars because I modified it to our tastes.  Added 1 Tbsp. sweet relish and used jalapeno monterey jack cheese on italian loaf bread.  Then I grilled it in my cast iron pan.

Everyone enjoyed it. It was dry when when mixing but resisted adding extra mayo as advised by a previous reviewer and was glad I did. It was plenty moist. 
I only had sliced munster cheese. It was good but I wouldn't use it again. The swiss sounded better. Even cheddar would have been a better choice. Will make this one again.

I thought these were good.  The vinegar seemed to cut out some of the fishiness of the tuna so that was a plus.

I follow this recipe to the T, except for adding a spoonful of relish and broiling for a minute or 2 longer at the end- the cheese melts, but the tuna doesn't get warm which makes for an odd sensation when biting into! the cheese mades the melts a little greasy, but my fiance really liked! I did use both  swiss and aged cheddar. Yum! Will make again.

Wonderful tuna melt recipe.  I always get these in diners, but never made one myself.  I have to say, it was just as good as the ones I have paid for.  Thanks for sharing!

A little dry, I thought it needed just a bit more mayonnaise. The vinegar is a really good addition. You can grill it in a skillet like grilled cheese sandwiches too.

This is a delicious recipe and as good as, if not better than, any tuna melt I've ever had in a deli. My husband loved it too. We used swiss and cheddar but I'd keep the recipe as it. Yummy!

Yum! I made these for a quick pre-holiday  dinner the other night with oven fries and cole slaw. I sat down looked over and both my husband and teenage son were halfway through their melts before I even started! There were lots of complements to the chef that night. It really is a great twist on the usual soggy tuna melt. The rye, Swiss and tomato make it special. Thanks so much for the recipe.

living in Virginia but being from NJ this brings back memories! If I may add, this recipe can be done on small scale and bread can be toasted in the toaster oven and also finished off in the toaster oven!!

Made this just as directed, and it was a wonderful, easy dish to make. I used home made rye bread from a recipe on this site.
My wife, daughter and I thought this was great, and I will make it again.

It was good, but lemon juice makes more sense to me, with anything from the ocean.  I make these all the time, but use lightly toasted Oatmeal Bread & Boston Lettuce.  It's always a treat, served w/fries or onion rings.

i started out to make a cucumber and tomato salad recipe i found elsewhere, but i didn't have cucumber (i'd just used the last one to make a spicy Korean cucumber salad), so i used thinly sliced celery; the salad dressing was simple: mayo, red wine vinegar, a splash of cream to thin it out, and some salt and pepper.  then, i thought, Why not turn this into a tuna salad?  so i mixed in a can of tuna (in oil, well-drained). and THEN, i thought, Why not turn this tuna salad into a Tuna Melt?  so, using this recipe as a base, i toasted an onion roll (hey, it's what i had) on both sides, then spread the bottom with (more!) mayo -- Kewpie mayonnaise from Japan, the BEST mayo on earth! -- then the tuna salad, then a slice of red onion, then a slice of swiss cheese, set it under the broiler to melt the cheese, then topped with the other slice of bread (no mayo on the top).  served with Kettle salt & vinegar chips.  WHAT A DIVINE MEAL!  i grew up in NY and South Jersey, and this is as good as it gets.

I swapped the rye bread for a thick cut of crusty, sourdough bread and the results were delicious! This is one recipe that fills my hungry guy in one serving. It's pretty affordable for a young couple too. We are making it again this week. It's a comforting food for the cold months.

Super good!! I used Muenster on one and Sharp White Cheddar on the other. My husband had Pepper Jack. I was tempted to leave out the onions because we are not huge fans of raw onions. But I left them in and chopped them very small - and I’m so glad I did!

My family loved this.  Made one deletion of the vinegar for my picky eater.  Used swirled rye/pumpernickel bread because that's what we had.  Some sandwiches we topped with Swiss cheese and some with sharp cheddar.  Very good, will be making again.

I made this with light tuna. Next time, I'll use white. Good recipe - liked all the additions to the tuna, as well as putting the cheese both under and on top of the tomato slices.  I'll make this again.

I have eaten in dozens of New Jersey diners, and the tuna melts are not like this. The vinegar in the salad is unnecessary and too sour, and the cheese under the tomato remains stone cold. To make a real NJ diner tuna melt, mix 2 cans chunk light tuna in water, very well drained, with 1/4 cup mayo, 2 Tablespoons each of minced onion and celery, and salt and pepper to taste, spread it on rye toast, top with thinly sliced tomato, if desired, and top with Swiss or American cheese. Broil for few minutes, just until the cheese melts and starts to turn golden brown, and that's it.

I made this in the form of a wrap, spreading the tuna mix on a tortilla, then adding the swiss cheese, tomato slices and finally sprinkling with paprika, before folding in the sides and rolling into a wrap. As I didn't have any parsley, I subbed cilantro and added a little cayenne pepper.
This I put this in my air fryer at 300ºF for 5 minutes.

I omitted the celery as it's just personal taste. 
It was fulfilling and savory in a delicious way. It was actually a tad bland to me but that might just mean I need more S&P in the mix. 
It's definitely worth trying!

I haven't made a tuna melt in quite a while, so I needed a basic recipe to refresh my memory.   This did the trick.  I wasn't “wowed” by the results, but it was good.  I thought the chopped parsley was a nice touch, but the recipe seemed to need more diced onion for flavor.  Also, I found the wine vinegar a little overpowering.   In the future, I would probably forego the wine vinegar and add a little pickle relish or minced dill spear instead.  Overall, this is a nice recipe, however.

I actually first made these 11/8/2008 and accidentally reviewed a different recipe. These were  really, really good! Everyone loved them. Will make again, without a doubt!

Easy to make and really good.  Only advice would be to turn bread over the first time you put it into the oven.  One side was slightly more toasted than the other.

Fast, easy, delicious!! I made this as is except for the rye, only because I didn't have any on hand. But I'm sure it would have only made this better!! I used hamburger buns instead. Experimented with cheese types, used a provolone, garlic jack, and plain ole American slices for my unadventurous husband. All good. Other reviewers suggested minced garlic and red onion...I think I'll try those next time...this recipe is a winner, can't wait to make it again.

This is good. I was doubtful about the red wine vinegar but it was tasty and kept the tuna moist. I didn't have a fresh onion so I used onion powder instead. Will definitely make this again.

This turned out great. I have never been to NJ or even ordered a tuna melt at a diner before so I wasn't sure what to expect. But it was tasty! I was a little skeptical of the tomatoes but they added the exact right amount of moisture. The only changes I made are: sourdough instead of rye (not a fav in my household) and I omitted the salt.

We enjoyed the recipe as is. We loved it even more  turning into a sandwich, grilled cheese style with provolone on sliced sourdough. On the outside before grilling,  I butter the bread, sprinkle on some garlic powder and fresh grated parmesan, then cook in the pan until golden brown. A bit of a twist but tastes awesome.

Thank you for the recipe. I added relish, cumin, and dill. Next time, I'm going to add green chile or jalapeño to add a bit of a kick. The Swiss and tomato was a nice addition.

I hadn't ever had a tuna melt until I made this! love the red wine vinegar, and also the tomato on top! so cute(: I did add some chopped hard boiled eggs, that's just the way I roll.  
Only thing is, I felt there was too much cheese. Maybe I should have used more tuna?
Great recipe though and I'll definitely make again(:

Made this for lunch today and it's a keeper. I used cheddar cheese because that's my preference. The only other change I made was I used dried minced onion instead of fresh, but I'm sure it would taste even better with fresh. This was so easy, quick, and delicious!!

I was hoping for big things with this recipe, but we found it just ok.   More than likely the recipe is good, but it just doesn't fit our tastes.   Easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Need to make double the tuna mix next time for 4 slices of bread but otherwise, this was excellent served on pumpernickle bread. Added to favorites. I used green onions instead of regular cooking onion but that's just personal preference.  Otherwise didn't change anything else.

Best  tuna sandwich E V E R! Use more onion, parsley. I've used dill stacker pickles and thick slices tomatoes. You can't go wrong either way. I really like Slap yo Mama seasoning too.

Loved it enjoyed as a latennight snack quick and simple. I didn't use rye bread I used wheat instead. Swiss cheese accompanied  the red wihne vinegar knocks this tuna melt out the park. Great recipe for the whole family.

GREAT recipe!  As others mentioned, this makes me re-think the idea of tuna sandwich the classic way (tuna, mayo, slice of american cheese).  The vinegar is key.

Just made this about 20 minutes ago for a late lunch.  My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it!  At first I wasn't going to add in the red wine vinegar because I didn't have any at home, but I decided to run to the store and get some.  I would highly recommend not throwing out the vinegar!  It was so delicious.

I love this! I added olives and sweet relish (something I've seen my mom do when she makes tuna sandwiches) and lessened the mayo. This is absolutely delish!

I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar. I also put dill weed in and used American cheese. It came out so good. I would definitely make this again.

My 10 and 5 year olds did almost all the work... I think I chopped everything and did the oven work. Yet, they looked like something fresh out off a gourmet lunch menu. Took no time and was fun with my girls. We also used extra red wine vinegar (because they dared me to :). Added a little sour cream. Replaced the rye with  sour dough and it was "EPIC!!!"

This is a delicious recipe. I liked the fact that you use only 1 slice of bread since I'm supposed to be on a low carb diet.

I needed a quick "fish" go to lunch since Lent just began here. I was reading through the reviews while eating the tuna melt and I gotta say as an experienced cook... this was simple and good and filling and quick.  That's the type of meal it is.  I substituted whole wheat for rye and cheddar for swiss (what I had on hand).  If you're a garlic lover I would definitely add some minced for a nice extra pop.  Don't forget the paprika, I think it added a nice taste.  LOVED IT!! 5 stars!! Great quick go to.

This sandwich is so delicious. I didn't have any onion so I used onion powder instead and it still tasted great! This is definitely a keeper that will be used again. Thank you for sharing.

Great Recipe! I use French Bread instead of Rye and Provolone instead of Swiss and I get rave reviews. This recipe makes the best tuna melt!

I like the flavor of this tuna salad much better than the traditional recipe I've always used (pickle relish, mayo, celery)  I used whole wheat bread and it tasted great.  The fresh parsley really made the flavor profile.

Oh man this was one of the best tuna melts I've ever had. I never liked tuna too much until recently. I used english muffin's because I didn't have rye. I also forgot the paprika but added just a little more onion. Tasted delicious!

Very tasty! I add a half of a cap of lemon juice to give it some zing. I also found that two full slices of cheese is a bit much- I put just one slice over the top only, otherwise the cheese takes over everything. I also just put my bread in the toaster first for about 45 seconds, then assemble the sandwiches, then finish under the broiler. Don't worry if the tuna seems a little dry- with the tomatoes and cheese, these sandwiches are plenty moist.

I made this for my husband and he LOVED it! I'd already made my tuna and I didn't add celery because I didn't have any. I added 1 tsp of pickle relish with the rest of the listed ingredients then broiled as directed. Needless to say, no leftovers! Perfect lunch. Thank you CookingirlLJ. :)

Not a huge tuna eater typically, but this was really good.  Only change I made is an English muffin instead of rye bread and I scaled it down to one serving.   It was really good.

Not bad. While I prolly won't make this again (I prefer my personal recipe a *tad* better), I'm glad to have given this a try nonetheless. My husband is not a tuna salad fan and even he commented that this is the best he's ever had so this can't be THAT bad lol. :) Although decent, I felt this was a tad dry for my liking. I had to add more mayo to achieve the texture I wanted. I also had to add more vinegar to get the tang I was looking for (it was barely noticeable, IMHO). Pumpernickel bread was a perfect choice for our sandwiches. Milk shakes (compliments of Steak 'n Shake!), fries, coleslaw and pickle spears rounded out our meal and made us feel like we were eating at an actual diner - NJ style. :-) Thanks for sharing your recipe with the AR community, COOKINGIRLLJ!

This was pretty good. I don't like rye bread, so I substituted some of the Kings Hawaiian sandwich rolls, and I also don't really like Swiss, so I instead used some American cheese slices. And I don't use red wine vinegar, so I substituted rice vinegar, which seemed to work pretty well. Next time, I would probably reduce the amount of parsley (I used 1 tsp. dry) and maybe add in a little Mrs. Dash to give the tuna a bit more flavor.

Okay, I'm not a huge rye bread fan, so I substited sourdough.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and my tuna melts turned out amazing.  I have made them several times now, and they are sooo good.

Made this last night...first tuna melt I have ever eaten so I can't compare it to others but I must say it was FANTASTIC!  It did taste "fishy" which surprised me, not much like tuna salad but it was a good "fishy" taste.  I felt like I was eating at a nice seafood restaurant.  I used Brownberry whole wheat bread since that is all I had.  This will certainly go into my favorite recipe book that I keep.  Thank you!

Very good! I made a couple slight changes due to what i had: i didnt use tomato as i dont like it, used cheddar because i didnt have swiss and i added a small amount of chopped pickled jalapeno to give it a little kick. The red wine vinegar really adds a lot to this! Do not skip it! I really enjoyed this easy lunch!

I just made a very different version of this- but it was amazing. My dad, who can be a  very harsh critic LOVED it. I didnt have celery or parsley, so I substituted that with fresh cilantro, put in a green chilli  ( deseed it if you find that too hot) a pinch if cayenne pepper. Here's the trick- instead of mayo - put a garlic cream spread. And I topped it with Kraft cheddar cheese. I then used sesame buns and toasted it till it got crunchy and perfect. Everyone loved it. Try this out, you won't regret it :) It didnt get soggy and the Tuna wasnt dry. And It wasn't too cheesy either.

This is a great tuna melt recipe. I didn't change anything except for using cider vinegar because that's all I had on hand. Definately will be making this again.

First time I've had a T melt and it was delish! Vinegar adds a depth to flavor. Note: Toast/ broil both sides of bread.
I do mine in my George Forman grill.

This is a gourmet tuna melt for sure!!  I followed the recipe exactly and just added 1/2 clove of garlic.  It literally is melt in your mouth good.  My hubby and I had this and ate 2 halves a piece.  I will make this again.

Used 1/3 cup of mayo and 1 tsp minced garlic.  Added a couple splashes more of red wine vinegar.  So good! I'll double the recipe next time and eat it for lunch the next day!

My kids are very picky.  I made your version of the tuna melt and everyone LOVED it!  They even like it served cold without cheese on crusty buns.  Thanks for a tastier alternative to plain mayo and pickles!

This recipe was very good and really easy to put together.  We will make again, but instead of rye bread we'll use something else.  Also, I think that cheddar cheese would add some flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great tuna melts!!   We will definitely be making this again.  The only changes I made was I added a whole small onion chopped (that was an accident but it tasted great if you like onion), dried parsley, and white american cheese instead of swiss.

You cannot go wrong with this sandwich! The proportions are PERFECT, though I sometimes add more celery and I always use whole wheat thin buns. I prefer to use organic cherry tomatoes, slicing them in to little rounds. They don't seem as juicy as big tomatoes and have a MUCH better flavor. Try this, don't add or take away, and you wont be disappointed!

I make these all the time and absolutely love them! I sometimes just use my standard tuna salad recipe and it still is great. I love the addition of cheese and tomato on the rye. What a great combination.

I'm vegetarian so I swapped the tuna fish for mashed garbanzo beans.  I also added a dash of relish and left out the tomato.  This was a great tasting sandwich that paired well with tomato soup.

Delish!  Even my fish hating husband likes it! This is a great way to jazz up tuna into something fancy for a quick and easy dinner (especially if you are only cooking for two).  Any bread will do, but as a rye fan, using rye bread was the tops and most flavorful.

I'm not from Nu Jurzee so I can't compare to any standard, but this was a great recipe. I followed the recipe for 8 servings, fed 4 with the open face sandwhich and my wife ate an excellent tuna salad for lunch most of the work week. Thanks for sharing!

This was a cheap and very tasty meal. We used red onion and added garlic, pickles, lemon juice and dill which made the flavours pop. We also substituted Swiss for Jalapeno Havarti and goat feta on separate sandwiches.

Great recipe!  The red wine vinegar worked surprisingly well.  I did make one alteration and used portobello mushroom caps instead of the rye bread - delicious!  Just brush the caps with olive oil and place them under the broiler for about 10 minutes - be sure to turn them halfway through.

My husband and I both thought this was a great tuna melt!  The only change I made was to use sweet relish instead of celery, as I'm not a big celery fan.  They were super yummy and made for a really quick meal after a long day at work!

The Tuna Melt was outstanding!! I used Swiss and Cheeder and it gave it a nice kick.  I too reduced the amount of Mayo.  It would have drowned the Tuna had I followed the recipe.  Maybe that is why it is called diner Tuna Melt LOL!!

I don't think I've ever had a proper tuna melt.  They aren't really served much where I'm from.  So maybe I don't get it.  This recipe looks okay and tastes okay, but I was expecting to be blown away after reading others' reviews and I really wasn't.  It tasted pretty much like every tuna sandwich I've eaten.  Which isn't bad!  Just maybe not 'best.'

Very nice, tasty...but lacking OOOmph.  I loved the presentation, and how well it handled for eating, but the flavor was lacking.  It might be that I had only a tomato from Mexico, and being here in Alaska...our tomatoes have NO flavor.  I'll have to experiment with this to make up for the lack of an awesome NJ tomato.  (having lived in NJ, I KNOW what an awesome tomato is like - and this ain't it).  Ideas are welcome...will look back and maybe find some. -LJ

I'm sorry, but I found this recipe to be very plain. I think there might be a curse on recipes labeled "Best". The only change I made was using sharp white cheddar and provolone instead of Swiss, and even with the stronger cheeses, I didn't get much out of it besides being a tuna sandwich. On the bright side, for a regular tuna sandwich, it was pretty good, not too far from what I make myself. I'll possibly try this again with more sharp cheese to accent the sandwich. Thanks for the recipe.

You couldn't make a tuna melt any better!  Great combination of flavors; we tried it with American and with Swiss and agreed that the Swiss cheese combines with the other flavors much better.  Even my 2 year old liked these and she doesn't usually eat tuna!  I did add more mayo and a clove of minced garlic.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Errr, I hate to give it 3 stars but thats how it was received in my house.  My husband is a HUGE tuna melt fan so I decided to try another recipe other than mine, because frankly my tuna melts are average, and this fell to that category.  Im rating the tuna in the sandwich which is the biggest part of the whole thing.

This recipe makes truly the best tuna melt ever!  I've made them twice now, just varying the type of cheese (colby was awesome on it!) and bread (DH likes french bread).  Served with salad it makes a very hearty dinner.

Being from the South we tend to over do it with tuna and chicken salad.  I always threw in relish, bioled eggs, onion, etc etc.  When I saw this I was skeptical but I love a tuna melt so I decided to try it.  WOW!  Its a really great recipe and one I have made 3 times now.  Its the perfect sandwich on those hurried days, and toasting the bread is key a lil toast then the tuna helps keep it crisp!  GREAT RECIPE!

excellent. I founde that I had to broil the bread longer than the recipe to get it toasted.  I used pumpernickel as I am not a fan of rye and it was great.  rave review from boyfriend who loves sandwiches.

I am sorry to say this was not a hit at my house.  We all love Tuna melts so when I saw this recipe I could hardly wait to give it a try.  I actually think the vinegar made it taste too "fishy".  For some I think this might be a good thing for us-not so much.

Surprisingly delicious for such a simple recipe!!  Never thought adding tomato slices would make such a difference.  Will make again!

I'm not a huge fan of tuna sandwiches, but this was awesome!  I was a little hesitant on using celery since I don't love it, but it gave the tuna suck great flavor.  I think I'd add a little more mayo and red win vinegar next time, but that's just my preference.  Thanks!

I know you're supposed to follow a recipe to the tee, but this looked so inviting I decided to try it anyway.  I substituted packaged Italian bread and American cheese (this is what we had in the house at the time) but I followed the recipe exactly for the tuna and it turned out to be delicious.  The next time, I will make it my business to have rye bread and Swiss cheese on hand because I think they will not only enhance the flavor but make a delicious sandwich even better.  Thanks for sharing.

Perfect.  I lived in Jersey for 2 years 12 years ago, and have tried many times to get my melts to taste like this.  Its the vinager.  Thats what makes it just like a Jersey diner.  Thank you soooooo much.  PS I did add a little granulated garlic to the mix.  It enhances the flavor of the tuna.  :) Thank you again

Loved this recipe. I remember reading this and thinking it's a tuna melt, what's the big deal? I think the addition of vinegar to the mix is what makes it a stand out. Now whenever I make tuna I always add vinegar! Yummy!

I made this but omitted the celery and tomato as I did not have them.  I toasted the bread and then put the tuna on it and topped with colby jack cheese that I had on hand.  This was excellent, and I don't care for tuna that much normally.  Will definitely keep in menu rotation.

I made this exactly as the recipe says, except I left out the celery as I'm not a big fan... It was really, really good! It's not some fancy fabulous gourmet meal, but as far as tuna melts go, it's the best I've ever had.

If I could give this more stars I probably would.  Everyone loved them..my kids don't like swiss or rye bread and they loved them.  I added pepper, seasoning salt and onion to the tuna!  Very tasty!

The red wine vinegar was a GREAT idea for reducing the mayo content and enhancing the flavor of the tuna.  However, the amount of cheese (2 per slice of toast!) overwhelmed all the other flavors.  Next time I'm just putting one slice on top, it should still hold ok if you don't turn it upside down.

Oh my gosh, this was so delicious!  I made a few changes; substituted onion powder for raw onions, threw in some minced garlic, and didn't use any celery (I didn't have any).  I also used low fat mayo and fat free Swiss, but you honestly couldn't tell; that's how great this sandwich was!  I also followed other reviewers' tip of toasting both sides of the bread.  Whatever you do, do NOT omit the vinegar--it's what makes this sandwich so special! This was seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.

This is our new way to make tuna melts! We love it! We aren't fan of celery so we skipped that... and because we didn't have the fancy bread, we used regular whole wheat... still turned out very good!  This was a keeper!

This tuna melt was truely the best ever. The taste was incredible and the display was impressive. Definitely a family favorite. If you like tuna you've got to try this one. Also great with pumpernickel bread in which I used and it turned out great.

This was extremely easy to make, and tasted great. I'm not a huge fan of tuna, but the other half absolutely loves it; the little vinegar tang made that little difference for me, personally. Our bread got a little dark (not burnt), but I was using a basic whole grain instead of rye, so there may have been a difference in moisture content. Definitely will be using this one again.

I used red onions instead of yellow ones - I find if the onions are raw I like the red onions best.  Followed the recipe as is though otherwise.  Will make it again.

Wonderful- and I don't even like Tuna Melts! I made these because my husband likes tuna and I was really surprised how much I liked these, too. I used white wine vinegar because I didn't have the red and it was perfect. I probably used extra mayo to make the tuna salad really moist. I plan to make these again this week. Thanks!

Mmmmm!  I am not a sandwich/melt person and hate cheese on my bread; but, this was fabulous!  Always looking for new ways to fix fish and this is a keeper.

Yumm!! I added one minced garlic for extra flavor as someone recommended. I toasted a half bagel topped it with the tuna added sliced red onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese, and crisp bacon. Then put it under the broiler in the toaster oven for a few minutes until the cheese melts. So good!

Great!  I used homemade italian bread rather than the rye, and shredded mozerella cheese, only because I already had these in the house.  Good recipe and nice and easy!

I am giving this 4 stars only because I made changes per family preferance. I used sourdough bread and added dill to the tuna and we loved it. Nice and easy and didn't heat the kitchen up to much.

We don't care for raw onion, so I left that out. I thought the tuna could have been a little more flavorful. 72M, 62F, and 31M thought they were "real good," 28F & 13F thought they were OK+, 10F didn't like at all. Overall, pretty good and fast!

These came together really quickly, but weren't anything special to us.  I didn't think the flavors came together, very heavy tuna taste, and mine were salty for some reason.  If I were to make again, I would omit the pinch of salt, but I probably won't make again as my toddler wouldn't even touch it.  He normally devours all things tuna.  Thanks for the new experience though.

I do not eat any kind of salads made with mayo, but these were good. My husband really liked them. I will make them again. I toasted both sides of the bread and they turned out perfect.

I made this tonight as a last minute meal with things that I already had around the house - we paired it with some apples and it was so good that it reminded us of what we have in the restaurant!  We didn't use the onion though because we didn't have any but I think I like it better that way.  I also just used plain chunk tuna in water instead of the white albacore and it was still delicious.

This was a pathetic version of a tuna melt.  I was so excited because it got such rave reviews, but it was sooo bland.
I like my version better. Look for Awesome Tuna Sandwiches.

I had never heard of a tuna melt until I read this recipe.  I had to make a few minor changes to suit the ingredients on hand, but was it ever good.  We'll be eating these a lot from now on, I'm sure.

I made this tonight with the golden potato soup from this site. Very simple and tasty. I made quite a few changes. Instead of red wine vinegar, i used white vinegar (i didnt have any red). I used french bread and mozarella cheese inplace of swiss and rye bread. Very good, a keeper.

I've never been too fond of tuna sandwiches but this has changed my thinking. It will go into my favorites file. The only negative thing I could come up with would be that it is messy, but well worth it!

This was good. I served it with Tomato and Cheddar Soup also from this site for a nice comforting meal for my husband and I. I'll be using this recipe again for sure.

This was good.  I enjoyed the swiss cheese and tomato on it.  I've not used those on tuna melts before.  I used sourdough bread instead of rye.

I made these using regular bread and left them open-faced.  My boyfriend now goes crazy whenever I make these for him. It's definitely a keeper!

Very good - even my kids loved it - as with the other reviewers the red wine vinegar is a must to make this a standout from other tuna melts - thanks so much!

So good!! I used red onion and it was great with the swiss cheese. I really like the subtle unique flavor the red wine vinegar brings.

These are great!  I followed the recipe exactly and now I find myself craving these about once a week.
