This was super yummy! I used pine nuts and regular crumbled goat cheese when I made it, and used less olive oil (about 1.5 TBS), and more spinach (about 1 cup).  I will however next time making this use less cheese as I thought it was too rich and somewhat over powering the other flavors.  Also, to make the prep easier with the quinoa, just add 1/2 cup water to the 1/4 cup quinoa, bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer for 15mins.  This way, the liquid absorbs on its own, and you don't have to drain it if you don't have a fine mesh strainer, much easier and quicker to do.

Oh my gosh!  If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!  This is my new favorite quinoa recipe.  Just a note, this recipe is for ONE serving.  I QUADRUPLED it to make about 4 – 5 servings.  I use pre-rinsed quinoa, so I followed the cooking directions on the box for 1 cup (dry) of quinoa.  I used pine nuts (which I’m crazy about) and parmesan cheese.  Next time I will add the nuts with the garlic and cook for only 2 minutes because I was afraid of the nuts getting too brown.  I did not quadruple the olive oil and lemon juice, though.  I still used only 3 Tbsp. olive oil and about 1 Tbsp. lemon juice.  And I used 2 large garlic cloves.  Thank you, thank you for this amazing recipe!!

What a great recipe! So easy to make and very nutritious. I used parmesan cheese and served with grilled halibut and steamed brocoli, it was delicious.

TEN STARS!! This recipe could easily be served in a fine dining restaurant! I doubled the recipe for hubby and I and it's a very generous serving each. Such simple ingredients turn into an amazing dish that I would eat as a main course not just a side dish. I used half the olive oil and half the cheese called for (grated parmesan romano blend) to save quite a few calories and still get the same flavor. Because I cut out half of the salty cheese, I ground sea salt and fresh pepper to add just before I mixed in the spinach. Do Not leave out the lemon juice! It really sets of the flavors of this dish. Also, I used pine nuts since so many people recommended it and I'm so happy I did. I could eat this once a week for years to come and hubby agrees!

Such a great, easy recipe!  It definitely has a nice nutty flavor that would go great w/fish.  My husband thought it was perfect just by itself.  I tripled the serving b/c I have a big family & it worked well for us, no leftovers.  I only doubled the olive oil & cheese though.  Im excited to make this again!

Amazing recipe, I already plan to make it again soon! How could you go wrong with quinoa, spinach and cheese?  I used pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds. To be honest, I don't know if I would have liked it that much if i had used seeds. Then again, I'm nuts on pine nuts!

Very easy and healthy! I used frozen spinach and red pre-washed quinoa. I steamed the quinoa, so I didn't have to rinse and drain it after. I also added some sesame seeds, walnuts, and black pepper.

I made this tonight for dinner and we loved it!! It was fast and also nice and easy. I used shredded Parmesan and that worked fine, but I'd be curious to try it with the gouda. The toasted sunflower seeds was a scrumptious and unexpected touch that added a delicious crunch. The cheese made things nice and creamy. I highly recommend at least doubling the recipe to get enough. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you for sharing!!

Great recipe, I've been looking for a good quinoa recipe for a while and I made this after yoga class tonight and it was quick, easy and just what I needed. I used a mix of sunflower, pumpkin and sesame seeds which added some extra crunch and used parmesan instead of the gouda and it worked out great. I also used pak choi (Chinese spinach) as the store was out of normal spinach and I think next time I might add a few baby or sundried tomatoes. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful recipe. , but can be simplified  in following steps: to 1/4 c Quinoa add 3/4 c water, cover and cook for  only 10 minutes, turn off heat, cover and let sit for 5-7 min. The longer the Quinoa sits the softer it becomes. I only let it sit for 4-5 minutes because I like it chewier.

By the way one can render the Quinoa into flour by using one's coffee grinder! That way it is easy to sneak it into foods, the kids will never know   (Smoothies)and they will receive all the complete animo acids that one finds in meat. A complete protein! Thank God for this super food!

This was ok.  We couldn't taste the garlic, spinach, or cheese....just the quinoa.  I'll try it again but with more garlic and cheese.  It has potential.

Outstanding! I quadrupled the recipe so my husband and I could have a little leftover. I used organic pre washed quinoa so no need to rinse. Per the other comments I reduced the oil.  Do not skip the lemon juice. The sunflower seeds gave it a perfect crunch and I will try pine nuts the next time. I used parmesan cheese but will try feta as well.Thanks for a great recipe!

The recipe is supposed to serve three? As a small side, I guess. In my opinion it's more like two decent sides, or one generous main serving for vegetarians, with a side of lentils or something. The flavors are excellent, though I used plain old chopped pecans and colby jack cheese. Something about the toasted nuts with the quinoa is very good. I toasted my quinoa in a dry skillet before cooking it, and I like to cook it in broth for more flavor. When it was cooked, I didn't cool it off just to heat it up again. I'm not sure what purpose that step serves. I started the nuts right before the quinoa was cooked and put it in hot. As a low-carber, next time I would add a LOT more spinach and maybe up the amount of cheese to go along with that. Because it was just cheese and not cheese sauce, the texture of this dish was very sticky, but I still liked it a lot.

This was excellent.  The flavors were a perfect blend, nothing overpowered the dish.  I substituted pine nuts for sunflower seeds, and otherwise just seasoned with salt and pepper.  Delicious, light and filling dish.  I quadrupled the recipe to make 4 servings.  Some idiot said it was 700 calories; that is for 11.5 c yield.  I did the math, it's a little over 200 cal/serving.  I will definitely make again.

I think I messed ip and used roasted sunflowers seeds rather than raw, which means frying caused them to be double toasted and put the flavour off a bit for me. This is an interesting, definitely gourmet way of cooking quinoa, but a bit bland. I used asiago cheese and topped with sriratcha sauce which really kicked it up a knotch.

Really tasty. I had pine nuts and they tasted so rich after being toasted in the olive oil. I also only had parmesan and it was good, but next time I will try the gouda to have a really special flavor. This stood alone as a fantastic main dish as the quinoa is very filling and full of protein. Thanks for a great recipe!

The sunflower seeds should be cooked for less time on a lower heat. I would also use less garlic and less cheese and a little more spinach.

I thought 3 T. of olive oil would be overkill so I used 1 T. instead.  Because it was for one serving, I only used 1 clove of garlic, and 1/4 cup of Parmesan because I didn't have any gouda.  I enjoyed the flavor a lot, but will use only 1 tsp. lemon juice next time.  It seemed a little overpowering with 2.

This is really good! A friend recommended I try quinoa as a replacement for rice as part of my slow journey on the path to healthier eating and this fit the bill as I already knew I liked the rest of the ingredients. The changes I made were to sub sliced almonds for the sunflower seeds, mozzarella for the gouda (I used a little more cheese than called for) and extra spinach. I'd saved the flaavoured oil from a jar of sun-dried tomatoes and used that to cook this. Very flavourful, and nothing over powered the other. Downside is how much the dish makes; at least triple the recipe for a family of 4.

Maybe this requires an acquired taste but the misture of goat cheese and lemon juice was not tasty. Another meal that also seems to require more salt for taste.

used roasted/salted sunflower seeds + parmesian/romano mix cheese; can easily double the spinach next time.  Very healthy and tasty!

Thanks, this was nice and so easy!. I read other reviews and added some walnuts and sesame seeds and strips of sundried tomato. I had a lot of leftover quinoa in my fridge which had been made with veggie and chicken stock, so added more  spinach leaves. Had no goat or gouda but had shredded Asiago which worked nicely. I would love to try the gouda next time. This recipe really lends itself to improvisation and playing around with amounts to your own taste.

My husband said it was average with three stars but the kids and I liked it a lot.  I did use frozen spinach and so that may have been my fault.

Yum.  I made the recipe exactly as it is and it was perfect.  Because I like spinach so much, I may up the amount of spinach in the dish (or lessen the amount of quinoa), but regardless it's delicious and deserves 5 stars!

We liked this recipe a lot.  I used parmesan because that's what I had.  I really liked the combination of the quinoa & spinach.  The sunflower seeds were a nice addition too.  I think I would use less lemon juice or maybe try it without.  Overall, it was easy, yummy & healthy.

I bucked my usual trend and made this recipe for the first time almost exactly as written. Regular gouda because I couldn't find goat gouda, and I added onion in with the garlic step. I also couldn't find raw sunflower seeds (life is hard at the ghetto grocery store), so I tossed the roasted ones in as the garlic and onion were finishing. I tripled the recipe, three of us ate it as a light meal, and I had two good sized servings left. We all were extremely pleased with the flavor, and I definitely will be making this again. A 5 oz. package of fresh baby spinach was just perfect for the triple recipe. Interestingly, I liked the flavor just as much when I sampled it cold as I was putting it away. I'm taking it for lunch tomorrow, and I'm going to try eating it without reheating to see how it is. If it works as a leftover at room temperature, I'll have to bump my 5 stars up to 10! Thanks very much for posting this recipe. I needed a fresh take on quinoa; I was tired of the several recipes I've been using for years.

This was absolutely delicious!!  The nuttiness of the seeds, the tangy lemon juice... we used kale instead of spinach because we like it better and used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil.  Used sunflower seeds as recommended, but cheaped out on the gouda as goat's gouda was quite a bit more expensive than plain gouda - it was still terrific!  We've definitely added this to our regular rotation.

This is really good, fresh tasting... the goat gouda is what makes it, as it is not super salty like most dishes Americans are used to. We doubled the garlic and added some extra lemon juice - a little salt to bring out the flavor and this is awesome stuff!

It was a bit hit with all the family. I used sliced almonds and smoked gouda and it was fabulous. The lemon really does make the dish - don't skip it if possible!

Deeelish. Made this as a main dish and doubled the portions, but it still wasn't anywhere near enough for 3 people; next time I'll triple (or quadruple) the recipe. Used parmesan instead and that worked really well. Served with a sweet potato soup and it was a heart & stomach warming experience. Don't leave out the lemon juice, it really adds to the recipe!

I'm not a sunflower or lemon fan, so we didn't add those. We also added mushrooms, asparagus and onion. It was delicious, the goat gouda is what made this dish.

This was my first time making quinoa and I'll be using this recipe again! I used pine nuts & parmesan cheese than I had left over from a batch of pesto.
So yummy and super easy! Great recipe!

Yum! I amended this a bit, using frozen spinach (I'd like to try again with fresh spinach), ricotta cheese and smoked gouda. I opted for the full amount (if not more) of lemon juice and garlic. I toasted the sunflower seeds in sesame oil for an added boost to that flavour. This was a mistake in the end, as the sesame taste was too overwhelming. The ricotta made it much creamier than the original recipe appears in the photo... more like "comfort food".  I'll do this again, probably with another combination!

Great flavors! Its very rich tasting. I used less oil. I also used gouda and parm instead of goat (I'm not a big fan). I enjoyed the sunflower seeds in this recipe and I used more spinach. Very satisfying side dish.

Wow--so easy and with such great texture. Quinoa and toasted sunflower seeds were made for each other! I doubled the spinach and used only 2 tablespoons olive oil. The dish was nonetheless rich and balanced. (And 1/2 teaspoon cracked red pepper gives it just a little kick.)

Made with pine nuts and Parmesan cheese but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This was very good, though next time I'll use more spinach.  Served it at a party and some ate it on tortilla chips.  Yum!

This was absolutely delicious. The spinach and the sunflower seeds made it. I used the red quinoa and it gave it a really nice earthy flavour. I used parmasan cheese because that's what I had around and I just eyeballed it. I highly recommend doubling the batch, you'll want seconds!

I am always looking for new and creative quinoa and couscous recipes to try and this was a great inspiration, which is why I am giving it five stars despite the fact that I didn't necessarily follow the recipe.  I used less olive oil, more spinach, no lemon juice(which I would have liked to use if I had it on hand), plain goat cheese and pine nuts.  It was really delicious.  The toasted pine nuts flavored the whole dish with a unique and tasty nutty flavor.  I am looking forward to trying the original recipe and some more variations.

After reading the review dated April 15, I decided I needed to alter the recipe a little bit.  The original had way too many grams of fat (good fats, but fats nonetheless)!  I only used 1 Tablespoon of olive oil- I figured I could add more if I needed to, but that amount ended up being fine.  The other thing I did was omit the sunflower seeds. By this change and deletion, I figured I left out over 35 grams of fat!    The only other change I made was use feta cheese instead because that was what I had on hand.  The result?  It was delicious!  I served it with grilled corn on the cob and grilled chicken. I will definitely make it again, although it seems that pine nuts would be a great addition, as another reviewer suggested.

I have had this in my recipe box for awhile now and finally tried it tonight!  I ADORE QUINOA - and this was scrumptious!  My only complaint is that I didn't have the required nuts for the recipe, so mine did without (LOL, sigh)!  It was still fantastic, doubled the recipe, cooking 1/2 cup quinoa in 1 cup of chicken broth (much more simple than having to drain).  I used fresh parm as that was all I had.  Didn't use quite as much cheese or olive oil as called for to save on some calories.  Wonderful dish...can only imagine eating it with either the sunflower seeds or pine nuts as so many suggested...MMMMM!

this was very tasty. I did mess up because i thought the recipe said goat cheese but then I saw it said goat cheese gouda. Dont know if that would make a difference or not. This was very good and easy to make. I would double or tripple the recipes. The servings were kinda small :)

I liked it, but didn't love it.   I feel it's a good starting point, but lacks pizazz in the flavor department.   More garlic, more cheese, more spinach and definitely needed some salt.   Recipe also makes a very small amount, so I you need to double it for more than 2 people.   I like the base idea and will doctor it up as needed next time.   Pine nuts were an good alternative to the sunflower seeds since I had them on hand.

This was a great side dish. I did use pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds and was happy how they melded with these flavors. I also added some onions when with the garlic. Next time I would add more onion and double (at least) the spinach. I love goat cheese so I would also add more of that. I also followed previous reviewers instructions and cooked the quinoa 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup water and let liquid absorb. It was super easy.

I tweaked it a bit based on other reviews.  Mixed goat cheese with a gouda/parm variety and used toasted pine nuts.  I quadrupled it for a dinner party for 10.  It was great and very well received as a pairing with baked salmon.

Wow!. I was just expecting an average quinoa side dish but this is amazing! I had to do couple changes due to what I had in the fridge (chopped pistachios instead of sunflower seeds and feta instead of goat cheese)I will love to try parmesan, but I'm sure the original recipe is just as good! Thanks for sharing your recipe alliecat3!

Excellent recipe! We used sunflower seeds as instructed (rather than pine nuts as many have suggested) and grated parmesan with fantastic results. Also, we quadrupled the recipe (to make 4 servings) and added 1 lb baked chicken breast slices (spiced with rosemary, salt, pepper). We are always looking for delicious, healthy, and simple recipes, and this one will definitely be added prominently to our rotation.

Very yummy! Even my 2 year old loved it! Left out the nuts, added some minced onion with the garlic and only doubled the recipe. Wanted to make more, but I was out of quinoa. Might try it with brown rice, either way it's a keeper.  :)

mmm delicious.  I did make a few changes though.  I tripled the spinach and tore it before cooking, doubled the garlic and used feta instead of gouda since that's what I had.  The flavours went together soooo well! Note that this recipe only makes about one meal sized serving.

This had a great flavour. I sautéd a minced shallot with the garlic, used pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds and feta because I love it with the spinach and lemon. I was disappointed that it didn't have the pilaf texture I expected. Next time I think I'll use traditional pilaf technique to get a better separation of grains/seeds.

We loved this recipe!  Tried it with crumbled goat cheese, pine nuts and fresh lemon.  My husband took leftovers to work for lunch.  He called and asked if I can make it again for dinner tonight. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good! I didn't have any nuts, so mine was nutless and I used a parm mix. My husband scarfed it down and he usually does not like quinoa at all! Yum!

Loved this recipe. So quick and easy to make. Could eat as a meal or a side dish. Great nutty taste and creamy. Delish.

I'm not much of a cook. I have no experience, but this was easy. I didn't have everything so I substituted almonds for the sunflower seeds and lime juice for the lemon juice. Since I dislike gouda, I also used feta instead. It turned out good though!

Doubled the recipe to make 2 servings, used grated romano, and omitted the seeds. Tastes great, will probably add even more spinach next time.

Used parmesan cheese and 4x'd the ingredients. It was good, but is not a dish that I will make again without making some adjustments in flavoring. It just did not impress my family nor myself that much.

Used WAY less olive oil and cheese than recipe called for and it was still fantastic. Also used almonds and parmesan rather than sunflower and goat/gouda.

I served this for dinner tonight with a Grilled Lemon Garlic Mahi Mahi. It was delicious! I used 1/2 regular goat cheese and 1/2 shredded parm. I think I will try adding some sauteed mushrooms to it next time.

This was Great... I Quadrupled the Recipe. Changes: Pinenuts,  2.5 ounces of Goat Cheese, 2.5 ounces Parmesan. I cooked the quinoa with a chicken bouillon cube. I Added: a pinch of kosher salt, red pepper and black pepper to the lemon juice.

I doubled the spinach so it was more spinach that Quinoa but that was still ok. Didn't have nuts so didn't use them but this still tuned out great. Wonderful healthy recipe

easy, nutritious, and delicious! this dish is so simple yet so tasty and filling. it seems like you can make substitutions where youd like - i subbed grated parmigiano cheese for the gouda, added some chopped fresh onions at the garlic simmering stage, and just about doubled the spinach. i also used approx the recommended amount of olive oil but used about 3/4 as directed in the beginning and saved the rest to drizzle on top of the spinach and quinoa once i mixed it in. seriously great, and so good for you!

This was delicious. I think i added mroe spinach because I always add more veggies and I used laughing cow garlic and herb cheese wedges because that is what was in the fridge. This was very easy and I loved the way the sunflower seeds tasted in this.. I'll def make this again and again

I didn't actually have quinoa, but I did make this recipe using Barley (I know, I know, different family and everything).  I also used frozen spinach rather than fresh, which worked just fine.  It was very delicious, and I'm looking forward to trying it with Quinoa soon!  The sunflowers made it nutty and the gouda made it smoky.  Yum!

Fantastic. We used pine nuts and they were good but for the price, we will use sunflower seeds next time. We only had edam cheese in the house and it turned out fantastic. Thanks for a great quinoa recipe!

this was very good the way  I made it and I  am sure it would be just as good if I had  all the ingredients called for in the recipe. Didn't have sunflower seeds or gouda cheese so I used
chopped pecans and Swiss instead. chopped up spinach (about 1/2 bag!) instead of a mere 1/2 cup.  My husband liked it alot and so did I!

Enjoyed this a lot however I did need to increase proportions in order to accommodate my husband and I. I also used lime juice as my husband hates lemon. I also  added a bit of salt. I used a combo of goat and Gouda cheese.

This is good on flatbread or crackers.

I added basil and cayenne, diced jalapenos and onion, as well as tripled the garlic.

For the process, my recommendation is to reverse the mixing. Saute the mix-ins shortly before draining the quinoa, then add them to the pot rather than the other way around. The flavors pop a little better and you don't risk burning anything. :)

I don't know if I did something wrong, but this dish was somewhat bitter and overall bland. I rinsed the quinoa very well too, so not sure what caused the bitterness.

I added goat cheese and freshly shredded gouda  instead of goat gouda, and added baby kale to the spinach that the recipe calls for. I also added a diced, sautéed onion. It is delicious!

I tripled the recipe so I could use it more as a main for my husband and me.  The original definitely would not serve 3 as it states unless you each want a very small portion of quinoa as a side, I suppose.  

I used half goat cheese and half parmesan, and for some reason the dish came out super cheesy in my opinion.  Maybe because the goat cheese that I used was packed and not grated?  I don't know.  I guess with a title like cheesy, it should be expected.

Still tastes good but I would up the spinach next time.

I honestly found it very bland. I am disappointed that I did not like it because I read all of the great reviews. I made it exactly as the recipe called for except I substituted pine nuts for sunflower seeds, as many reviews suggested. I am a huge fan of gouda and pine nuts normally but I felt that you could not really taste any of the flavors of gouda, pine nuts or spinach. We are NOT picky eaters at all but my boyfriend and I actually had to add a crunchy salad mix and poppyseed dressing in order to give it any flavor at all.

Delicious.  I used regular goat cheese and pine nuts (because I love them) and I couldn't get enough.  I also used more spinach.  I'm planning to make it again for dinner with company tonight!

I found the goat gouda at a specialty Italian market but it could be make with another similar cheese. It was delicious! I doubled the recipe but next time I make a double recipe, I am not going to double the olive oil.

Added more garlic and like others, I used toasted Pine nuts. I added a can of black beans and some frozen corn as well, added it to a whole wheat wrap and baked it in my sauce of choice. Don't forget the Parmesan and cheddar...or whatever.

This was delicious and I plan to incorporate it into my rotating dinner menu!  Next time I'm going to add some black beans or chick peas and serve it as the main course.  I was dubious about the sunflower seeds but their flavor (and the lemon) really contributes to the dish.

Really good. I also used pine nuts (which I love) and a little crumbled goat cheese on top instead of mixing it in, in order to keep it healthier. I also used frozen spinach which I defrosted prior to using in the recipe. Serve with extra lemon wedges to squeeze over top. Would make this again and again!

Oh my gosh! If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would! This is my new favorite quinoa recipe. Just a note, this recipe is for ONE serving. I QUADRUPLED it to make about 4 – 5 servings. I use pre-rinsed quinoa, so I followed the cooking directions on the box for 1 cup (dry) of quinoa. I used pine nuts (which I’m crazy about) and parmesan cheese. Next time I will add the nuts with the garlic and cook for only 2 minutes because I was afraid of the nuts getting too brown. I did not quadruple the olive oil and lemon juice, though. I still used only 3 Tbsp. olive oil and about 1 Tbsp. lemon juice. And I used 2 large garlic cloves. Thank you, thank you for this amazing recipe!!

I have made this for lunch for myself three days running. It is absolutely delicious. It's filling and satisfying AND nutritious. I can't wait to try different cheeses with it. I've been eating it as a vegetarian main course, with a little more spinach and a side of haricot vert. I seriously can't stop eating it.

One of my favorite weeknight recipes for a filling, healthy and easy side dish.  I've tried a few combinations as other reviewers have suggested... My favorite is sunflower seeds and parmigiana cheese.  I always use a little extra spinach as well.  Great recipe!

After reading other's reviews, I tripled the recipe and am glad I did as it would not have been near enough to satisfy my appetite (this was my entire dinner).  I was out of sunflower seeds, so I used slivered almonds and Parmesan cheese was all I had on hand. It was fantastic!
I've fixed quinoa many different ways and this is definitely one of my favorites.

I thought this was surprisingly delicious.  I'm not fond of cheesy vegetarian dishes, and this was tasty without being heavy.  My children both pronounced it as "disgusting" (as they usually do), but once they tasted it gave it two thumbs up.  Used parmesan cheese and pine nuts because that is what I had.  In my recipe box to make again.

This recipe has lots of my favorite things and I was a little disappointed. I felt it was a little too greasy, so I would reduce the amount of oil next time. My sunflower seeds and garlic turned out too brown and I couldn't taste the garlic even though I used twice as much as called for (I love garlic). I used regular goat cheese and it was creamy and tasted great with the quinoa. I'll try it again, but modify the recipe just a little.

I was completely amazed at this recipe.  I added more cheese and sunflower seeds.  It's definitely a keeper!

This was just okay. I made double for 2 people and there was plenty. But it had a tart flavor-I think the pine nuts and the lemon juice combined to make it a weird flavor. Also, I stuffed that cup with spinach and it was definitely not enough. I was expecting (stupidly, I guess) something like the picture above...with the quinoa kind of hidden by the other tasty ingredients. But it was just quinoa and cheese (I used Parmesan) with a tiny bit of spinach and that super tart taste. Not great.

I used a mixture of cream cheese and parmesan instead of goat cheese and turned out great!

Yo, I bought some goat gouda from the organic market. Hit up the ingredient search option here and this was the one and only recipie featuring goat gouda. I had everything on hand so I made it right, never measured anything and it turned out great.
No doubt this is one of the best I've tried from the site. 5 stars.

This was my first try at cooking quinoa, and this made for a tasty, if small, dish. 

I omitted the sunflower seeds and used a mix of chèvre and drunken goat (gouda wasn't available); also used frozen spinach, so I'm sure the texture was a bit different.

I also upped the quantity of quinoa to 1/3 cup. Maybe I cooked it wrong as the volume of quinoa did not expand greatly. I'm glad instinct told me to use more, as I ended up with two decent-sized portions rather than one giant one. Overall I'd recommend doubling the recipe for the average family.

Super yummy!  We used pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds and an Italian cheese blend instead of the goat gouda.  Will definitely make again!

This was a great recipe. I used 1 tbs of truffle olive oil and 2 tbs of regular olive oil which gave it a great extra flavor. I would use about half the amount of olive oil in the future.

My first time cooking quinoa, and it was delicious!  Also easy to make substitutions.  Like other reviewers, I used what I had on hand, so parmesan cheese and pine nuts instead of the gouda and sunflower.  A new favorite.  :)

I modified this quite a bit to use what I had on hand. I did not have sunflower seeds or gouda so I subbed flax seeds and mozzarella. Also cubed a leftover grilled chicken breast and added that along with a pinch of lemon pepper seasoning. It was very good. I would like to try this again with the gouda, I'm sure it would be even better.

I found this to be very good.  I had to sub pine nuts for sunflower seeds and parmesan for the goat cheese.  The lemon juice adds a little extra flavor that shouldn't be skipped.

Very good and very easy.  Here are some substitutions which I also find work wonderfully, depending on what I have on hand any given day: toasted pine nuts for the sunflower seeds; regular goat cheese and grated monterey jack for the goat gouda; and couscous for the quinoa.

A really nice side. We didn't have the goat cheese so used pepper-jack instead. We also didn't have the lemon juice so I ended up having to use some balsamic vinegar, some Greek seasoning and pepper. I also added some red pepper flakes, which made all the difference for me.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly and everybody loved it...even my kids and husband, who questions anything with spinach in it. Fixed it with pesto salmon, and it was wonderful. Will definitely make this again soon. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.
