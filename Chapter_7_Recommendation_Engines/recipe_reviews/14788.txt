I usually make something similar to this with Cream of Mushroom soup.  I think I prefer the Cream of Celery. Very good.

Yummy-licious!!!!!!!!!  Will fix this again!!!  I made a few changes:  I used evaporated milk, instead of regular milk.  Also, I added 1 heaping teaspoon of Sylvia's Soul Food Seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic pepper.  Next time I will double the sauce mixture - chop up a pork fillet and cook in the slow cooker - and serve in crusty bread bowls!!!!!  Thanks - dinner was fabulous - great recipe!

A very simple throw together meal. I had cooked about 8 chops, I used 1 can cream of celery soup and 1 can cream of chicken soup then used 1 cup of milk. I also added 1 packet of onion soup mix that was suggested by another reviewer. It made a really nice gravy that we all had plenty of to pour over our mashed potatoes. You cant get much easier that this for supper! Thanks for sharing.

I had high hopes for this recipe.  It went together in no time, but it didn't turn out how I expected.  The taste was a bit bland, and I even seasoned the chops with lemon-pepper seasoning first.  The gravy was very unappealing.  It stayed really soupy and didn't thicken at all.

If you follow the recipe as written it's going to be extremely bland. I decided to use some sliced butter, onions and sliced mushrooms as well as some Greek seasoning. I saut√©ed the onions and mushrooms in butter in my instant pot. I placed the pork chops on top of the onion mixture and then sprinkled Greek seasoning over the pork chops. I then poured the soup and milk mixture over the pork chops and cooked it on high pressure for 20 minutes followed by a five-minute natural release and then a quick release. Very tender, and delicious. Served with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach I recipe from AR.

We switched out celery soup and used mushroom soup.  Delicious!  Served it over rice.  Will make this again and highly recommend it.  Took 40 minutes.

i added the lipton onion soup mix and garlic pepper as suggested and the sauce turned out so salty we could not eat it.  my husband raked off the sauce and ate the chops plain.  i will not make this again.
