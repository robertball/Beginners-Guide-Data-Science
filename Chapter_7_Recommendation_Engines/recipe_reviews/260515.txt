These instruction on how to cook in the instant pot or any other EPC are bad! You shouldn’t add your food to a cold pot and then turn on sauté. The amount of cook time is way off too,
Your zucchini will be mush after all that cooking 
5 minutes HP with about 5 minutes natural release is enough time to cook the chicken 
Then add the zucchini and beans close the lid and let the soup sit for about 5 minutes

I'm always looking for healthy meals to make in my pressure cooker and glad I tried this one.  Only thing different was I used breasts instead of thighs and added corn.  Whole family loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

I used chicken breast and I have to say that it was one of the best chicken tortilla soups that I have tried.  The chicken was very tender and the mixture of the soup was very tasty.  My family even ate the leftovers and THAT says a lot!

I made several substitutions to use up things I had and avoid a trip to the grocery store and it turned out amazing! I love recipes that turn out good even with substitutions!

I also added a small package of sweet frozen corn with the black beans and lime. It was amazing.

This was very good. Was a little not like I have made in the past but I lost that recipe. We enjoyed this and the grand kids liked it as well. Had just enough left to freeze 6 cups in two cup servings for lunches at a later time. I will be making  this again.

Used a third poblano pepper. Will likely make again. I think it was more than 8 servings

This soup turned out AWESOME, just exactly as written. I like it with lots of lime juice, fresh cilantro, and a little dollop of sour cream on top. I will definitely make this again! Even the kids liked it.
