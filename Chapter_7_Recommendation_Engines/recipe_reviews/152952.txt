This was my first time making biscotti and these were delicious!  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand- I used salted butter instead of unsalted butter, 2 tsps instant coffee since I couldn't find instant espresso, 1/4 tsp. orange extract instead of the zest, and 3 1/8 cup all purpose flour. I drizzled the biscotti with melted white chocolate and chocolate when they were cool. I really liked the combination of flavors in this recipe.

This is definitely a favorite! It was hard to not eat the dough and the cookie after the 1st baking! The combination of dried cranberries, almonds, and chocolate is wonderful! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I found I needed to tweak it. The dough was too dry & crumbly, so I added a splash of milk so I could manage the dough. Also, I couldn't taste the coffee, so I would increase that. I do think the chocolate brings out the coffee flavor a bit. This is a real keeper!

Very Good! An acquaintance asked me if I made these biscotti to sell because if I did she wanted to buy some!

Made this again recently, this is still one of my favorite biscotti recipes. Instead of "stirring" in the toppings (chocolate, almonds, etc) I put the dough on a cutting board/clean surface and knead the toppings in slowly to help control where everything is going.

[[12/24/2012]]
Perfection! I always get rave reviews when I make these biscotti. They are very easy to make, and the dough isn't as sticky as some other biscotti recipes I've tried -- makes it easier to knead the dough. The only tweaks I make is to double up on the espresso, skip the dried apricots and add a 1/4 cup more of each of the chocolate, almonds and cranberries (personal preference). When forming the logs, I like to angle the top and bottom edges of the dough so that when you cut them diagonally, you don't waste too much of the cookie. After it is twice baked and cooled, I like to dip some of the cookies in ganache chocolate (See Chocolate Ganache Recipe).

I doubled the espresso as suggested, but still don't really taste it. That being said these are very good. I also left out the apricots and chocolate chips and dipped in chocolate instead. The dough is pretty stiff and difficult to mix all the goodies into so I just dumped it on the counter and kneaded them in. Also, I wish I would have flattened the logs even more so they would be long thin slices. I thought I went to about an inch, but I was a little over and it does rise.

I thought this was a good recipe. I used it in some mailed cookie boxes for Christmas. I like how there is so much going on flavor wise. The orange zest flavor is pretty dominant and I liked that. The colors arent so vibrant like on the marichino cherry ones. I actually labeled what was in them, on the gift packages, because its hard to tell. Only change I made was halving the fruit and chopping it up. I also just chopped whole almonds. For the coffee I used starbucks instant Christmas blend grind. Lastly, I used cake flour and salted butter. The 2" width, on the shaping, seemed small. I went with approximately 2.5." I suggest that, because they dont puff up much larger after the first bake. They still are a smaller biscotti. I had no issues with cutting them which was nice. I hope the food gift is liked.

There are a lot of flavors going on but they complement each other very well.  I drizzled mine with melted chocolate.

This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review about anything, But felt it needful to share my  experience.  Followed this recipe exactly.  Espresso flavor is good.  Orange undetectable.  Product is extremely dry and very crumbly when cut.  Would strongly advise just following your own favorite biscotti recipe adding expresso flavoring.

This recipe is wonderful with a cup of coffee.  Itâ€™s not sweet and the combination of fruit and chocolate work well.  I added in some left-over dried cherries in addition to the cranberries and apricots which added additional fruitiness.   I used all-purpose flour which worked out fine.  To add a little extra sweetness and prettiness, I laced the biscotti with a confection sugar icing.

Turned out great though doubling the batch gave my mixer a tough time. Omitted nuts due to allergies used mini chips and some extra cranberries

Very good recipe! I agree with some others that a little less all-purpose flour is better (I don't have pastry four), otherwise the cookies crumble while cutting, and a bit more regular instant coffee works too. I like this recipe also because it is easy to add or remove ingredients as needed - I will use this without the almonds for someone who cannot eat nuts.

I've never made biscotti before so I didn't know what to expect when mixing the dough but 3-1/4 cups flour is way too much!  I could barely mix it in the bowl and it came out of the oven dry and crumbly after the minimum baking time.

Made it exactly as written.  Found it to be somewhat bland, amazingly enough.  Not all that thrilled with it and likely will not make it again.
