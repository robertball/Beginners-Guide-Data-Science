This was very easy--a lot of can-opening! My husband loved it; my kids not so much. I cooked it longer than the recipe stated which just made for softer meat.

Very delicious stew. My fiance wasn't too enthused about the spinach but when finished you can barely taste it. I would advise cutting down from 4 cups of water to about 3-3 1/2 depending on how thick you want your stew. If you would like it thicker and to have a richer flavor use the margarine from cooking the meat and a little flour to make a quick gravy to add in.

I did make some substitutions: instead of using canned vegetables I used fresh vegetables - I added in about 3/4 cup of water to make up for the liquid missing from the canned vegetables. I also did not use margarine I used butter. I did not have any hope for this recipe at all but I'm surprised it turned out delicious!

I made some modifications to this, but it's amazing and it's my go to recipe for stew now.
