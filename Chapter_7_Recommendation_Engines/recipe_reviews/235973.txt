I really liked this cake. Easy to mix up and very tasty; I do like my cakes a lot more chocolate so I may have to use more cocoa next time.

I had a cup of buttermilk to use up so I made some cupcakes shortening the baking time to 15 - 20 minutes. They were moist and tasty and the only change I will make next time is to increase the amount of cocoa.

This cake is very moist and delicious. We really enjoyed it. I made it in layers and had one layer topped with strawberries and saved the other in the freezer for another time. It was a great recipe to use up the buttermilk I had. I'll most definitely be making it again. Thanks for sharing!

I made this cake today because yesterday I bought buttermilk for the herb biscuits recipe I made from allrecipes and didn't have anything else to do with it. this cake is super easy to make. however even after adding a touch more chocolate as per another reviewers comments it was still probably one of the blandest cakes I have ever made. it was nearly tasteless. it had an awesome rise in the oven and I had to cook it for the full 40 mins because my pan was 8 11 instead of the 9 12 stated here. next time if I make it again I think I would add maybe some cinnamon and cloves to turn it into a spice cake instead.
