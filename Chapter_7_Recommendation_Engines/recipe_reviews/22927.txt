I made a few changes, served with homemade bread and my husband declared it to be "the best thing he ever ate." I pureed the potatoes with my hand blender, used 1/2 the bacon called for, added 2 very large cloves of garlic to the leeks and used 1% milk in place of the cream. I used canned chicken broth and next time will use reduced sodium as I did think it too salty- even with no added salt. Definitely a keeper!

I also looked at this recipe and thought.. "5 ingredients? No kidding!"

But i'll be damned if this isn't the best Potato and Leek soup i've ever had!
It was so simple and easy to make and took no time at all. I think it's the "basicness" of this recipe that is most appealing. Not much to mess up and the results are wonderful.
I left the ingredients exactly as stated and didn't change anything. I was left with a sensationally robust chunky and very flavoursome soup. 
The only thing i MAY try next time is instead of cutting up all the bacon i'll just grab bacon bits. But it may detract from the presentation of the soup at the end. It's nice to see all those chunks of potato and bacon in it. My family AND neighbours loved it and i'll definately be making it again.

A really excellent combination of tastes, with no additional seasonings needed.  I modified the recipe somewhat by mixing in one-third of the sauteed leeks with the cooked potatoes, then blending about two-thirds of the resulting soup into a puree before mixing it back in with the rest of the potatoes and adding the remaining leeks and cream.  It's a very rich soup and Half and Half cream seems to sustain the flavor while reducing the calories and fat content somewhat.

A very delicous soup. Easy to follow instructions.  It felt sinful to eat because of it's high fat content.  A lower fat alternative I have tried to the bacon is smoked ham and milk instead of heavy cream. Sauteing the leeks is key to good flavor.

Wow! I was at the store and noticed the fresh leeks and bought them on a whim, then came home and looked up a recipe - i'm so glad I picked this one! I am literally eating the soup as we speak and it is phenomenal. After reading other's reviews and seeing what I had on hand, I used 5 cups of chicken broth instead of 4 (5 cups of water seasoned with chicken buillion cubes); used half a pound of bacon and half a pound of cubed pancetta (I live in Italy now and we have to use what we can find!); sauteed 4 chopped garlic cloves with the 2 whole leeks; after the potatoes were tender I took out approximately 1/4 of the batch and mashed them easily by hand with a masher. This recipe is delicious. A good way to clean leeks for those of us who dont cook with them often is as follows:
1. Rinse the outsides, cut off the bulb/root.
2. remove any outside leaves that are spotty or extra dark green, trim the ends of the green top of the leek.
3. cut the leek lengthwise down the middle, and chop according to recipe.
4. Place leeks in bowl of warm water and swirl around to remove excess dirt.
5. scoop out leeks and place in colandar, rinse. 
It seems like alot of work, but really its not that hard and it is worth it to not have dirt in your recipe. 

Thanks for the delicious soup - will most definitely make again!

Seriously good soup!!  I've made it lots of different ways and it always turns out perfect.  I've substituted onions for leeks and ham for the bacon.  I always use milk to make it more healthy.  To make up for it, and to make the soup thicker, I stir in about 1/4 cup of potato flour - this makes it perfect - almost like a thick stew.  I get compliments everytime I make this recipe - and that's quite often!!

Delicious with or without the cream (for dieters)!
Even better if you throw everything but the cream in right away to boil into the soup!
Mash it all before you add the cream for a thick smooth soup!

This recipe was good, but the directions were vague.  I did not know what kind of potato to use, so I used large russett potatoes.  I only needed 4.  Also, the leeks were huge.  I only needed one.  I did use a hand blender to cream the potatoes before I added the other ingredients.  I also used half and half instead of heaving whipping cream.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

What a delicious soup.  I used low sodium chicken broth, since I figured the bacon would lend enough salt to the recipe.  I used half fat cream, and I think I could have easily used milk instead.  I also used a hand blender to pur√©e the potatoes, which made it thick and creamy.  Served it with some homemade bread and it made for a wonderful rainy night supper.

Wonderful flavor - the bacon (or some other similar seasoned meat) adds a lot of flavor.  I added 2 tablespoons butter and pureed about 1 cup of the cooked potatoes to add to the texture.

flavorful!  I followed directions as written.  There is no need to doctor this recipe up! keep it simple! stay true to the recipe.  My tips: cook bacon and saute leeks before you boil the potatoes. Add cooked leeks, bacon and cream as soon as potatoes are soft. After combining all ingredients, leave the soup on the stove for 30 minutes on low to let flavors blend....it will turn out creamy and full of flavor!  My potatoes were perfect, careful not to overcook them.   I used unpeeled red potatoes -  I was not sure about "sliced" leeks, I thought it might turn out best "diced" - but,   I made very thin slices- most of them opened up after I sauteed them.  You could cut slices in half if you want to.  It was an awesome and unique textured soup. I don't agree with the others who said to puree potatoes?? No way, I like my soup chunky.  I garnished with shredded cheddar. Yum.

Great soup, and it allows for ample tinkering (as proven by the fact I printed this recipe and then forgot the sheet at the office and ended up doubling the proportion of leeks and broth of the original recipe). The only "conscious" changes I made were sauteeing the leeks with a little white wine (as opposed to frying them) and substituting the cream for milk. Will definitely make it again!

This was fabulous.  I kept the skins on the potatoes.  Next time I'll cut back a bit on the bacon and use either milk or light cream to cut back on the fat.  I doubled the recipe and it's gone already!

Absolutely killer soup. I made some very minor changes. You HAVE to watch the video if you're to get the proportion of potatoes to liquid right. This is cooking (art), not baking (science). I used russets, but have a large bag of them on hand and they were restaurant style in size, so even picking the smallest ones I could required twice the broth. You have to cover the potatoes with liquid otherwise you'll end up with soupy mashed potatoes. So I ended up with 8 Cups of broth.

I saute√©d the leeks in one stick of butter - excellent choice. When cooking the leeks, taste them before adding to the soup. Salt and pepper to taste.

A note on heavy cream - not all creams are created equal. Choose one with 6g of fat per serving. It will result in a much better flavor and mouth feel than the 4.5 g of fat per serving whipping cream (that's why they call it heavy cream).

One other minor change I made was to use about 6 baby new red potatoes, diced the same size as the rest. Russets will break down, which makes for a great thicker soup, especially on day two, but the new potatoes hold their shape well and don't break down. It makes for a very nice texture.

A note to "health conscious" folks changing the recipe. If you want healthy, don't eat potatoes. This is a comfort food. Changing heavy cream to milk or half and half? No wonder why some reviewers complained of it being bland. 

Changes for next time: instead of three leeks, I will use four due to their mild flavor.

I like that this soup is easy to whip up and has so few ingredients( plus the bacon flavor really stood out).  I did add carrots just because I like them in my potato leek soup. I also added a couple tablespoons of butter and about a teaspoon of salt and a dash of black pepper. I had to add extra cream because I pureed it and it was very thick. Overall with some tweaking this is a great recipe! I'll be making it again for sure.

This was scrumptious, although I did add kielbasa to mine and did not make the bacon, i bought already cooked bacon and added. I sauteed my leeks in olive oil and also added garlic. mmm mmm good... I also pureed half of the potato mixture to make it a bit thicker and creamier. My boyfried devours it every time and I served it as a special lunch to my grandfather with sandwhiches. i recommend this recipe! excellente!

I loved this. It's so easy. The hardest part was peeling the potatoes. I mashed up the potatoes a bit to make it thicker. It would be nice with ham.

This quickly became a family favorite after the first time I made it.  The recipe is outstanding as is, though I have to make a double batch for my large family!  The people calling it bland.... well, their tastebuds must work differently than mine do, because there is nothing bland about this soup.  Smoky bacon (key: get good bacon), hearty potato (standard russet is the best!), the yummy oniony flavor of the leeks....how is that bland?  Plus, the salt from the bacon and broth means you do not need to season this at all!  Perhaps some might like some black pepper.  I do always mash most of the potatoes, as we like this creamy, but that is the only change I make.  You could make this lighter with 1/2 and 1/2.  But personally, I think any recipe that starts with bacon and ends with cream HAS to be a winner! ;-)

This was a great recipe! It took no time to prepare and make. The only changes I made were: 6 medium yellow potatoes, 2 medium leeks, 2 cups of milk in addition to the 4c of chicken stock, and I partially mashed the potatoes so that the potatoes and liquids was creamy. Other then that I highly recommend this recipe.

My picky husband really thought I outdid myself with this one! I put it in the blender and blended it until it was smooth and creamy. It was so smooth and creamy that I didn't remember till half of it was already eaten that I had forgotten to add the cream! If it was that great without the cream (healthier too), I can't imagine how much better it would be with the cream!

Simple and delicious recipe.  I tweeked it a little bit to suit my taste.  I added a bit of steamed cauliflower I had kicking around in the fridge, which made it even healthier (it's always nice to "hide" some extra veggies in a potato soup to make it a bit less carb rich).  I also omitted the heavy cream and used a bit of whole powdered milk, which added creaminess w/o making it any runnier (we live in Africa, where cooking with powdered milk is common).  Finally, I put 3/4 of the soup in the blender to make it smooth and more appealing to my 3 year old - she might have resisted a soup full of chunks of leeks, no matter how flavorful they were.  Oh, and I used bacon bits instead of cooking my own bacon.  Thanks for a simple and quick recipe!

Great basic recipe for this kind of soup. I went ahead like some of the other reviews and used lowfat milk instead of heavy cream and used 1/2 the amount of bacon. I love garlic and added that too.  Quite delicious! My husband helped himself to 3 bowls!

I followed recipe exactly as stated and this soup was AMAZING!!  Next time I would put more bacon in it though.  I did garnish with some shredded pepper jack cheese and scallions just for looks.  A+++

I did make a few alterations, but all in all this recipe was delicious!

I was worried about all the bacon, I thought the bacon flavor might be overwhelimg.  But the soup was just delcious.  Here are the few changes I made that were really successful!

I cut the bacon into little pieces.  Then in a huge stockpot, I cooked the bacon on medium heat.  When it was cooked through I added the leeks.  When they were thoroughly sauteed and cooked down (5-8 min) I added flour a tablespoon at a time until a majority of the grease from the bacon was absorbed.  Next, I added the potatoes and the chicken stock.  I simmered it on low till the potatoes were cooked through.  I used 2% milk instead of cream, and I let it simmer low until we were ready to eat.  I did add, pepper and garlic, but it was delicious without it too.

This recipe came out very bland and tasteless.  I used whole milk instead of cream, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Won't make this again!

Execllent Soup!!!  I made a few changes.  I used 5 and 1/2 cups of water instead of 4.  It was too thick.  Also I didn't have bacon on hand so I fried the leeks in about 1 teaspoon of butter.  Also added some pepper to it.

My family loved this soup!  I used 7 medium potatoes and added 1 garlic clove, 1 stock of celery, some green pepper to the ingredients.  I used 3/4cup milk and 1/4 cup half and half cream.  I did not puree the potatoes as I wanted it to remain a "clear" soup.  Delicious!

When I saw this recipe, I thought, "C'mon. It's only 5 ingredients. How amazing can it be? What's with all the 5 star reviews?" Let me tell you: it IS that good. 

My Changes: 1) Used half and half instead of heavy cream. 2) Mashed the potatos around a bit with the bottom of my ladle just before adding the bacon, leeks and half & half. 3) Used half a pound of bacon.

For the next time I make this (which will probably be very soon): When I saute the leeks, I'll add a half ladle or so of the chicken stock from the boiling potatos to the pan to deglaze the bottom of the pan.

My boyfriend likes simple food (he cringes when I say things like "maple soy glaze", "kale" and "polenta gratin") and he LOVED this.

I thought this looked excellent and gave it a try.  I used 2 leeks and 1/2 lb bacon, about a tablespoon of chopped shallot, 1 clove garlic and 1 tsp thyme as well as salt and pepper.  Delicious!
Even better today!  I also added a tablespoon of sherry to a bowl today.  Yummy.

Fantastic!! This has to be the easiest soup you could make and also the BEST! Since I have to have cheese with everything I eat,the only addition I made was some shredded Vermont white cheddar on top so it could slowly melt in. Once you make this soup, you are sure to be hooked.

This is a terrific soup. It is easy, the ingredients are readily available, and it tastes like heaven. I did not quite have enough cream, made up the difference with milk. I think I'll try this again with just milk and see how it turns out. I think if you mashed some of the potato and used milk you would get that creamy effect without the insane calorie count from the cream. Did I mention this soup also looks great? The chunks of potato, green leek and bacon look super. If you reserve a few leek circles when you are chopping, it makes a great garnish. Thanks!

This recipe was great. You don't need to add cream for it to taste creamy- milk does the job perfectly. Also, I would always recommend using a food processor as this allows you to choose the thickness/chunkiness of the soup. As my mother is vegetarian I did not add any meat and it tasted lovely. Thanks for the tip about garlic as this really does give it something extra.

This recipe was pretty good.  I added a roux(1/2 butter, 1/2 flour[i used 2tsp each]), just to make it a little more thick.  The butter tasted good as well.  And I didn't have any bacon, so I added mushroom which turned out pretty good.  I didn't have anything to purree my vegetables in which I wish I had as I didn't really like the chunks of potatos.  Next time I will have a food processor and add some bacon-and add butter!!
tres bien!

After reading other reviews, I chose to make this Potato Leek soup recipe. We loved the taste, and creaminess of it too. My family & I feel like one pound of bacon was a bit too much. I will definitely cut back on the bacon next time. I also liked the fact of not having to slave over a pot of soup all day.  The quick prep and cooking time was very appealing.  Like other reviews stated, I too would double the recipe to have more to go around.

An awesome rich and creamy soup!  SOOOOO flavorful!!  I served this to a family friend who is VERY picky and really figured he wouldn't eat it.  I gave him a tiny bit in a bowl to try first.  He ended up eating a huge bowl of it!  My picky 12-year-old son also gobbled it up!  This one is a big winner!!

Holy cow, was this ever good!  I only had 2 leeks but it was still so flavourful due to the bacon.  After I took the soup off the heating element, I blended it a little with my Braun handheld and the texture is so fantastic, it's like a meal in itself!  From now on, this will be one of my main comfort foods...especially now that winter is upon us! :D

Absolutely delish!  Had only two leeks, but it worked out really well.  Followed all the directions except I seasoned the leeks while they were cooking with salt & fresh ground pepper.  To decrease fat/calories (especially after using real bacon) I used evaporated skim milk instead of the heavy cream and added a couple of sprinkles of ground nutmeg.  I also pureed the soup mixture with my immersion blender and topped each bowl with the browned bacon rather than mixing in with the soup.  Yummy, thank you for the recipe!

I cooked a version of this today, making some minor changes to the ingredients (as I live in Thailand so it's not always easy to get fresh Leeks and decent spuds)

But all in all a very tasty soup - I added some chilli as well to give it a little bit of a kick at the end.

This is the easiest potato leek soup I've ever made, and just as good as any other I've tried! I followed the directions exactly, except that I thought it was a bit too thick so I added an extra cup or so of water. Delicious!

Very good recipe!  I made a few changes: used half cream and half 1% milk, added about 2 cloves of garlic, also (albeit tidious) I don't like the texture of the bacon when it is cooked in the soup - the fatty parts are just gross to me - so I try to cut off as much of the fat as possible and only use the meaty parts of the bacon.  I also use my homemade chicked stock which has no added salt, which I think makes it better since the bacon is already pretty salty.  My boyfriend demands this almost weekly after the first time I made it!

I pretty well followed the recipe, except for adding a couple of diced kohlrabi that we had on hand and wanted to try out.  We loved it...even my 10-month-old daughter gobbled it up!  We add the bacon as a garnish after we ladle it up, because we don't like it soggy.  Also, I smushed some of the mixture up with a masher so that the soup thickened without having to add all the cream.  Perfect for winter in Ohio!

I followed the recipe exactly (except I pureed 3/4 of the mixture as many of the reviews recommended)....it was very tasty in my opinion but came out like mashed potatoes instead of soup :(  Don't know what I did wrong ?

Can't go wrong here!  Super quick and easy.  I though 1 pound of bacon was too much but it was the perfect amount.  YUM, one of the best things that I've eaten in a while was a piping hot bowl of this stuff!!

Delicious, with very few ingredients.  I found that my potatoes absorbed all 4 cups of broth, so I had to add another 2 cups of broth and heat through at the end.  Also, I didn't have cream on hand, so I used regular whole milk and made a roux to thicken it a bit.  Thanks for easy recipe.

OMG! Delicious! Make this easy recipe for your family once and you will have to make it again and again because they won't stop bugging you for it. And if you make it for a party they will keep asking you for the recipe. Keep it a secret and make them think you are some sort of superchef. P.S. If you can't get leeks use scallions.

very nice! i'm a vegetarian and made some changes to the recipe: 

- used vegetable broth instead of chicken
- substituted red potatoes (kept the skins on) for the regular ones
- sauteed some minced garlic in oil before sauteeing the leeks
- tossed in some bite-size pieces of fried tofu right before serving

i also found myself a little broth-less, so i added a cup of hot (but not boiling) water and a dash of garlic powder, salt, and pepper for taste.

Very good recipe!  We made some adjustments based on what we had at home... no bacon, but we had prosciutto, so we went with that.  We sauteed the prosciutto in a bit of olive oil, as it doesn't have nearly as much fat as bacon.  We also replaced the whole cream with a combo of 1% and half-and-half (didn't have enough half-and-half).  Finally, I took an immersion blender in the end and pureed about 1/2 of it (including prosciutto).  It was very nice that way... the flecks of red from the prosciutto were very pretty.  I also added a bay leaf that I took out before blending.  Next time, I would add a bit of spice - garlic, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper or something.  It's just missing a bit of a kick for me.  However, it was still very good... especially with some nicely toasted bread!

This should be renamed "salty bacon soup with leeks and potatoes".  I've made potato leek soup in the past but couldn't find the recipe, so I used this one after seeing the 5-star rating.  I disagree and think the balance is way off.  
I only had 2 very small leeks versus the 3 the recipe called for (but that was sufficient), only 12 oz of bacon instead of 16 oz., and after cutting up 4 medium-large potatoes, I decided that was enough.  We found the soup to have not enough liquid, too much bacon, and WAY too much salt.  
I'd fix this recipe by using only 8 oz. of bacon, using reduced sodium chicken broth, and using more than the 4 cups it calls for.
Potato leek soup is a pretty simple thing, and this recipe just failed in my opinion.

This is a good meal for my fiance and I to make together, as he does all the frying and I chop everything and assemble the soup. We've made this several times, and it's very filling and tasty. Unless you're using very small potatoes, you won't need eight of them, we've used between 4 and 6, and blending about 1/2 the potatoes with a bit of the chicken stock. We also use milk instead of heavy cream and find it rich enough that way, adding cheddar cheese grated over each bowl.

I made this soup using 10% cream instead of heavy cream.  I added a scant 1/2 tsp of tapioca starch to the cream before stirring it into the soup just to give it a little extra body. 

Before adding the bacon, I used a stick blender to mash just a small amount of the potatoes--I don't know if the potatoes were supposed to break down or not--but mine didn't seem to want to---so I helped them along a little bit.  My whole family really enjoyed the soup and found it both hearty and filling.  I certainly appreciated the simplicity.

This was great, I did make some changes however.  Omitted the bacon and added carrots and great northern beans instead.  I like bacon, I was just out of it and didn't feel like running to the store.

This is the Best Homemade Potato Soup I have made yet...so simple, yet TASTY!. Instead of bacon I used Turkey Bacon, and fried two stalks of cut up celery with the Leek and added some pepper. I also cut corn off two husks and used 1 1/2 cups of 2% milk instead of cream. I then used Yukon potatos for a more creamier taste and a little bit of garlic salt. It was a family hit!!

This soup is once again an example how something very simple can be very good. I found it to be exceptionally flavourful, considering how quickly it can be made and how few ingredients it requires. Fortunately, I have the convenience of living only a 5-minute walk away from one of the world's best markets, so instead of regular bacon I used thicker cut double-smoked Dutch bacon, organic free range chicken broth, and organic Yukon gold potatoes. I also added freshly ground pink, green, and black peppercorns at the end, and instead of using heavy cream (which is 36-40% milk fat) I used 18% m.f. cream, which still has 5 times the fat content of whole milk. In addition, I found that adding an extra cup of broth helps with the consistency of the soup, which would otherwise be way too thick.
The result was outstanding! I highly recommend this soup.

I made this soup yesterday with a few minor changes - I used turkey bacon, left the skin on the potatos, added garlic and onion when cooking the leeks, hand-mashed some of the potatos, and added half-n-half only to our individual bowls upon serving.  My husband ate two bowls without any half-n-half and I added less than 1/8 cup to mine.  This was definitely the easiest potato-leek soup I ever made and I appreciated that it used ingredients (other than the leeks) I had in the house.  Served with homemade bread it was a wonderful way to forget about the spring snowstorm outside!

I used this recipe and made my own additions.  I sauteed the sliced leeks with 1 chopped onion, minced garlic, and 12 strips of chopped turkey bacon in avocado oil while I boiled the potatoes in 6 cups of chicken broth.  I also seasoned both the potatoes in the broth and the sauteed leeks, onions, and turkey bacon with sea salt, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder.  I also added some white pepper and a hint of turmeric to the potatoes after they were done boiling and before I added everything else.  Once I added the sauteed leeks, onion, and turkey bacon, I added some parsley flakes and let it simmer on low for a few minutes.  The texture was perfect without having to add any cream and I added an additional cup of chicken broth and it was absolutely delicious.  The basic recipe lacked seasoning, so this is really one that you can make your own.

As written, not so much. 
Revised with 4 slices of bacon for crumble on top, NOT IN the soup. 
Pour off all but 2 Tsp of the fat. 
Three mid sized leeks ... NEVER brown leeks, always saut√© low and slow in reserved bacon fat, more than enough for flavor.
Half and half sufficed. 
I used 2 Large yukon gold potatoes and hand blended 1/2 with the leeks, added the other half back cubed. 
This made it a 4.

I've never used leeks before but I heard they make a great soup. I found this recipe and because of the ratings decided to try it. I used baby reds and a few gold potatoes (since that is what I had on hand), 8 cups chicken broth, 2 bay leaves, and a pinch or so of thyme, parsley, rosemary and dill seed. I fried half the bacon suggested to a nice crisp. I rinsed three medium size leeks and used part of the white bulb and most of the green leaves, chopped thinly and used the bacon grease to saut√© the leeks til tender. And as others suggested, I added 2 chopped garlic cloves with the leeks. Then I used half and half and 2% milk. A little pepper, didn't add any salt, and this is delicious. Next time I'll add chopped celery and carrots with the leeks.  This is definitely a keeper.

Definitely saving this to favorites!  I used red-skinned potatoes and left the skins on; baked the bacon for 15 minutes at 400* because I don't like getting spattered with hot grease when it's fried; added 4 rough-chopped cloves of garlic when sauteing the leeks; and used a full pint of cream.  I only had 2 leeks but the balance seemed good, and honestly, the two of them sliced pretty much filled my skillet -- if I'd had a third I would have needed another skillet going!  End result: the pink of the potato skins and bacon looked vibrant next to the green of the leeks.  Fantastic comfort food for a chilly night; my wife and 5-year-old both loved it as well!

I would call this Loaded Baked Potato Soup!  I'm usually not a fan of bacon, but am so glad I gave this recipe a try.  I used my immersion blender to puree the potato/bacon mixture before adding the leeks.  I seasoned the bacon and leeks with freshly cracked black pepper and added garlic salt before serving.

I rated this as 4 stars because the recipe itself is a starting point, but I had to make some alterations because it was bland. With my alterations (seasoning, garlic, another 4 cups of stock, spices), it is a 5 star recipe.

I made this today and have mixed feelings on it.  I did change a few things to make it healthier (milk instead of cream, and 1/2 the amount of bacon).  I only used 4 medium sized russet potatoes and even now I wonder if that was too many.  After making it I felt it lacked something and was a little too thick for my liking, especially considering I wanted to let it simmer longer and there was barely any liquid left.  I added another 1cup of skim milk and got the consistency I wanted.  I didn't mind the flavour but my husband thought it was a bit bland.  I added a dash of marjarom and about 1/2 tsp of thyme as well as some sea salt and pepper to taste and let it simmer for an hour.  This made the soup have a wonderful flavour and a great consistency!

I changed only one thing.  I added a few minced garlic cloves in with the leeks while they were sauteing.  I also didn't measure the cream or broth.  My boyfriend has decided that he is buying leeks anytime he sees them now so I can make this really easy and really tasty soup.

Yummy! I kept all the bacon grease in for flavour. And I used milk instead of cream. I think I would like this better if I blended everything and then added the bacon. Very warm and hearty. Perfect for a cold day.

Darn tasty. I like the addition of bacon to the recipe -- bacon makes everything better. I used turkey stock instead of chicken broth (because I made some after Thanksgiving), and it worked fine. I added salt and pepper to the recipe, but that was probably only necessary because I didn't use enough of those seasonings when I made the stock. Live and learn. :-)

This soup was fantastic! I did make some small changes however. Instead of heavy cream, I used fat free half & half and instead of regular bacon, I used turkey bacon which I cooked in the microwave. I also boiled chopped onions and carrots with the potatoes and pureed it. This is great basic recipe that you can play around with in my opinion. My husband had 3 bowls for dinner and is now begging me to make it again. Thanks Anabana!

This soup was delicious! I was a bit nervous to make it since I've never had leeks before, but my partner and I both found it wonderful! It was also really easy to make.
I made a few changes. I used milk instead of the cream, chopped two cloves garlic and added to the potatoes, and substituted one sausage since my partner and I don't eat bacon. I mashed the potatoes a bit before adding the leeks and sausage, and then let it simmer a bit longer to thicken slightly. When I was cutting and frying the leeks, it did seem like a lot, but don't worry, cos the soup tasted just fine and was quite flavourful.

This is the best soup for a snowy day.  I added some garlic too.  The sublte flavor of the leeks went really well with the bacon & potates.  This is going onto my favorites list.

Good recipe! Except I would recommend using more chicken broth, since mine got almost all evaporated and I didn't have any more, so I ended up with more of a chowder than a soup. Also, substituted the bacon for ham, since I didn't have bacon, and I think I might have overdone it (I still have difficulty calculating portions). Since the ham did not have much grease, I sauteed the leeks in butter, and I have to say, it turned out really nice in the end! With some homemade bread it's definitely a keeper.

Yummy!  Only change I made was low fat half and half instead of heavy cream, and doubled it so we'd have plenty for leftovers.  My blender's on the fritz, so I just smashed the potatoes down with my hand masher so they weren't big lumps.  A smoother texture might have been better, but the flavor was wonderful.  Will be making this one again!

This is my first time making this soup and it turned out amazingly well!!  Very simple, quick and easy and the results are truly phenomenal.  I made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it!  Everyone went for seconds and possibly third if there was enough =)  I added some celery and onions to the leek and used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I also added a bit of celery salt for taste - without salt, i found it a little bland.  This one is a keeper!

This was delicious! I added a little extra cream to finish off the container and put in about an extra cup and a half of chicken broth. I also added 4 chicken boillon cubes to add a little more flavor. Delicious and would definitely make again.

this is so a very kid friendly soup. Its cheap to make and quick! I used smoked black pepper bacon from my deli counter at the grocery store. My kids don't even realize they are eating leeks. Only thing that would make it easier is if the recipe called for cups of sliced leeks.. they come in various sizes so its a guess if she means small ones or large ones.

Oh.....My....Gosh!!!  If I could rate this higher, I definitely would.  My husband and I had never tried leeks before, and tried this since I had heard so much about them, and I picked yours due to the great ratings...now, officially one of our favs! And hubby isn't much for soups.  He even took the leftovers to the fire station the next day & 2 of them asked me to give the recipe to their wives!!! Thanks so much for an awesome recipe Anabana...You rock!

This is one of my new favorite soup recipes. This is also the first time I cooked, and served, a recipe with leeks as one of the ingredients.  Wow, they are good!  I made this recipe exactly as written and it was outstanding!  Thanks so much for posting it!

This is a great basic potato leek soup recipe.  It definitely lends itself to additions and alterations but is great as is. I sauteed celery and garlic  with the leeks and added scallions at the end, as well as a bit of pepper. My husband loved it! I will definitely serve this to family and friends.

I really wanted to love this recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand and followed the recipe.  Too bland.  Needed some help.  Maybe some Thyme?

This is a easy and delicious recipe. I omitted the bacon and sauteed the leeks in olive oil. The flavor of this soup is so wonderfully simple. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

This is a keeper.  I just realized I bought half-and-half for this, but forgot to put it in!  It was still great.  I reserved half the fried leeks, pureed everything with an immersion blender, then added the leeks and bacon.  Also, i used turkey bacon.

I can see how some people would call this recipe "bland." After adding one clove of pressed garlic, 1 tsp. savoury, and pepper to taste, the flavor of this soup was still very mild and delicate. I found that it was very important to let the soup cool somewhat before eating it. When it was hot, the flavors were overpowered by the heat. Overall though, I thought that the flavors in this recipe worked together well, although it will not likely become a family favorite.

Good soup. I did use fat free half and half rather than cream though... If I make again I may add a can of corn to make it more chowdery??

My family really likes this soup.  Tastes better warm, but is fine even cooled off for a nice summer soup and salad dinner.  
I add a bit of garlic salt, since we love garlic.  Lemon thyme or basil also enhances the flavor when we serve it room-temp.  This also seems to be a recipe you can easily add to or alter.  I've also made it by replacing the cream with 1/2 sour cream or plain yogurt, half regular or soy milk and it works great.  Adding in leftovers like corn, peas, chicken, even pasta all work well with this great recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

This was truly awesome!  I made a couple changes because I didn't have heavy cream and my husband wanted me to put in some cubed turkey ham.  I referred to my cookbook for substitutions and used 2/3 cup of whole milk and 1/3 cup of milk for the heavy cream.  I also added maybe a 1/4 cup of half and half.  I added the ham at the end just to warm it up. I will definitely make this again!  It tasted even better the next day.

This is an absolutely delicious soup!  I made it according to directions, with no alterations.  It seems like it wouldn't be tasty because there are no spices added, but I wouldn't change a thing.

I liked the simplicity of this recipe, however, I did add some garlic, pepper and a touch of nutmeg.  I found it too thick like some of the others did so I thinned it with both milk and extra chicken broth.  Overall it was good.

Good basic recipe - to the leeks, I added ground black pepper, 2 cloves of garlic, a dash of marjoram, savory, celery salt, onion powder, thyme, and bay leaf. I used light cream instead of heavy cream, would probably be fine with just milk. Also pureed a couple cups of the potatoes for texture. Great soup.

This soup was delicious, and the leftovers were even better the next day.  I used half the bacon (turkey bacon) and mashed some of the potatoes like someone suggested to make it a little thicker.  I also used milk instead of cream.  The flavors are very  light and subtle.  A little salt, pepper, and a dash of garlic powder also add a nice touch.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe just as it is written but my husband thought it was too rich. I made it a second time and used whole milk instead of the cream which made the soup thinner but he raved about it then! Great soup either way.

This was excellent. I didn't quite have a pound of bacon, so I threw in some cubed ham. I also like my soups pureed. I pureed it, but it came out very thick, so I added a little more broth and cream (probably about a cup or so). This is excellent soup!

This was good. I tweeked it a little by adding minced garlic to the bacon and leeks, and a lot of cracked pepper. I also mashed up the patatoes in the chicken broth and added a little extra broth. It just kicked it up a notch, and it came out awsome. My kids and their friends loved it on a cold snowy day!

Very good on a cold winter's night...or any time else for that matter. Modified it a bit by using only half the bacon, and using a food processor on the potatoes (once cooked) to give a thicker, smoother consistency. Also, sauteed 3 good size cloves of garlic with the leeks. It's a keeper!

Quite Delicious soup, but I did make a few modifications.  I fried four cloves of garlic in with the leeks, and blended about a third of the soup in the blender to help thicken the soup. I was quite a hit with everyone!

Mmmmmmm!
Really good, and looks quite nice. I might try to puree the leeks next time, just for change. Very yummy!

I really, really liked this soup.  It's kind of a cross between the traditional potato leek soup and baked potato soup.  After the potatoes were tender I threw them in my artisan mixer to mash them up, then I threw them back into the broth and mixed until soft and creamy.  I also sauteed a garlic clove with the leeks.  This really was a fabulously decadent soup.

Delicious soup!!! I read the reviews and decided to go with only 1/2 lb bacon which was plenty, and I used a hand blender and potato masher to cream the potatoes. Also, I substituted the heavy cream with about 3/4 bar of cream cheese. It turned out great, and the kids liked it too. Will definitely make this again!

Great recipe!  I doubled this as my husband and I like to have lots of soup on hand for lunches, etc, and it turned out really well.  The only thing I did differently was add a couple cloves of garlic in the fry pan with the leek.

This was my first time trying Potato and leek soup. It is very good. Definitely a family keeper. I did not use the recommened amount of bacon drippings. I used Pam spray with 1/2 of the drippings to saute leeks. Also, the liquid dryed up very fast. I enjoyed the favors very much.

I'm sorry, we just didn't like it.  Too much bacon, otherwise sort of bland.

I think this recipe is really great. I really loved this recipe, and unlike others, I thought the chunkiness was nice.  I think that 3 sliced leeks was too much for me, because even after they were cooked, they seemed stringy and tough. I added the amount of maybe 1 1/2 or 2 leeks, because after I sliced them, there seemed to be a lot! But, maybe I just had extra large leeks.  The recipe is delicious and I plan to make it again, when it gets colder here.

Easy to make and yummy to eat especially on those cold winter days.  Only extra thing I did was to blend 3/4 of the potato and 1/2 the leek together and mix them back into the soup.

Fabulously rich but fabulous taste -- the two so often go hand in hand, don't they?  Next time I will use 1/4 lb. bacon and substitute half and half for the heavy cream.  I used my giraffe to half blend the potatoes before adding the remaining ingredients.

They should call this "the soup that eats like a meal"!  Yummy and thick -- perfect for a Canadian winter night!  I used table cream (18% m.f.) and also added 1/4 tsp of salt and pepper while blending.  Honestly though?  I could do without the bacon in it.  An excellent way to break-in my new food processor!

Will definitely make again.  Added asparagus, chopped carrots (2) and 4 cloves garlic plus a roux to thicken. Also substituted butter for the bacon.  Chopped everything into small pieces so each spoonful held all flavors. Did not peel the potatoes. Garnished with shredded parmesan cheese.

As written it is bland. It needs something to spice it up.  Second time I made it, I added a couple cloves of garlic, salt and white pepper, and some fresh rosemary.  That made it a better soup.  Of course that also made it a completely different soup.

A little bland as is. I added a little garlic and crushed red pepper as well as pepper. Also, thickened it with a couple tablespoons of instant mashed potatoes. Delicious with the adjustments

This soup was devoured by my coworkers, but in its original state, it was a little bland.  I normally don't use much garlic powder, but I had to leave and get this to a potluck so I added garlic powder and some dill and the flavor was much improved.  I agree with some of the reviewers that it is just too much bacon.  I think if I made this again I'd saute the leeks with garlic and dill or some other herb in the drippings from one or two strips of bacon that I'd then discard (or eat!).   All those chopped up fried bacon strips just turned into lumps of fatty gristle in the soup, but I might add some Canadian bacon or chopped ham instead.

Very good soup!  I used mashed potatoes that I had left over as well as some diced ham that was also left over.  I added a little prepared mustard for fun, about a teaspoon.  Will definitely make this again.

So yummy!  I just ate two bowls and it was so simple, but the best potato soup I've ever had.  I did use half and half instead of cream and I wasn't in the mood for bacon so left it out.  I did use a little bacon grease to flavor the leeks.  I loved the chicken broth instead of water to cook the potatoes in, it made it flavorful without extra richness.  I'm sure making it exactly by the recipe would be wonderful, I just made to suit me.  Thanks!

meh.. not my favorite. I would call this potato and lots of bacon soup. I made as the recipe called except substituting whole milk for cream. I found it bland. It tasted like boiled potatoes with lots of bacon. So many different variables though, type and size of potatoes, bacon and use of chicken stock. I used high quality bacon and homemade chicken stock and medium yellow potatoes. I was able to save it adding additional seasoning. Consistency was good.

I don't know how anyone could think this recipe is bland! It's so tasty because of the bacon. I add garlic because I add garlic to almost everything. Using lower fat milk does not detract from the taste at all, if you're worried about calories. I usually use coffee cream. My kids love this soup. I make it at least once a month!

This is the soup you make on a cold,snowy,rainy day/night-I usually have all the ingredients for this soup in the house which makes it a win win Friday night dinner with a panini sandwich-All I add is some grated sharp white cheddar to the serving bowls and it's a party in your mouth-No need to go to the high priced soup and sandwich restaurants when you can make this in your own kitchen for 1/4 the price-Yummy!

This soup is fast, easy and great.  And don't skimp and us regular milk and then complain that it is bland.  I grow leek so it is a perfect fall soup for my family. The only thing I added was freshly ground pepper

This is my autumn tradition, and our whole family looks forward to it.  It's heavy alright...do not make this if you're dieting!  But it's oh, so yummy when made with fresh, local veggies!

This was really simple and absolutely delicious! I used Yukon Gold potatoes and they held up really well, I think that's important. I slightly mashed them, broke them up a bit really before adding the leeks and cream. Also, a note about the amount of potatoes: I used up the potatoes I had, which was 9 medium potatoes, but I had a lot to trim off, so it worked out to about 8 cups diced. At first I only used the 4 cups chicken broth, cooked the potatoes while frying bacon and leeks. But my leeks were so huge, I knew I wouldn't have enough broth, so I added about another 2 cups vegetable broth (I was out of chicken) and heated it up. I increased the cream accordingly. Other additions I threw in were: 1 large carrot, diced, for color really. 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped. And once all these were cooked with the leeks, I added 1 can of creamed corn and some cracked pepper. 

I think you could add whatever vegetables you want to the sauteeing leeks,I might even try mushrooms sometime. Half and half worked very well, I don't think I would go heavier. Also, for the broth, quality matters! If you don't make your own, I've found that Pacific Foods Organic broth is wonderful, I don't bother making my own now.

Thanks for this recipe, I will make often as it was sooo easy and sooo good!! Kids loved it topped with a little shredded cheddar and a breadstick. YUM!

Great recipe--you can totally fudge the amount of ingredients and it still comes out great. You MUST saute the leeks in the bacon grease!  Adds so much flavor! Like other readers, I pulled out some potatoes and mashed them for texture. Great soup!

Delicious!  I used only one leek (plus a chopped yellow onion) and half and half rather than heavy cream because it was what I had on hand but it still turned out wonderfully.  I did add thyme, nutmeg, salt and freshly ground pepper to taste, and then pureed it with an immersion blender because I like that texture.  Thank for a great recipe.  I can see this having many different flavor combinations and ingredient variations!

Made this tonight and everyone devoured it!  Great, quick, and easy meal on a cool fall evening!  I always tend to make a few changes to all recipes I use and adjust by taste mostly as I am cooking.  I added some cubed chicken breast to it as well as a few extra spices and chicken bouillon cubes.  My husband is not a fan of thin soups so I always thicken the broth just a tad as well, this time I used just a touch of poultry gravy mix I had in the cabinet.  Yummy!

This soup is perfect! I made it exactly to the recipe and it came out excellent. I added some salt to taste right after I finished it but I should have waited a little longer. I think if I had let it sit for a few minutes then the salty bacon would have added all the salt I needed. Anyhow it was so delicious and easy! Thank you!

This is a great easy, quick, and relatively healthy meal.  I'd never cooked with leeks before, and wow yummy!  I changed just a few things because of the ingredients I had on hand.  I sauted the leeks in 4T butter then added previously cooked sausage and about a 1/4c flour for future thickening.  Then I poured the cooked potatoes into that broth and all.  I just added 1c regular milk since I didn't have any heavy cream.  Still great!  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this, and it was great!  I halved the recipe because I had only about 8 red potatoes.  I used low sodium chicken broth and then added a small amount of salt to taste at the table.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream. It was very tasty and rich, although I think you could use low fat milk and it would still taste great.  Follow the recipe as written as much as possible; definitely saut√© the leeks before adding to the soup.  YUM!!

This recipe is awesome! My entire family loves it! First time I made it, I made it according to the recipe, fantastic! Afterwards, since 
I like leaving my soup to sit overnight, I dont put in the potoatos until later. I add a little flour to thicken the soup. If I have a turkey or chicken carcass , I boil that for a few hours with some chicken broth. I remove the bones and add the chicken to the soup. Its amazing and makes it very hearty. I usually only go for about 1/2-3/4 of the bacon the recipe calls for, I find too much bacon can sometimes take over.

Great soup! I left out the bacon and used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. After the potatoes were tender I pureed them in a blender to make a smooth soup, poured it back into the pot, then added the rest of the ingrediants. Since I didn't use any bacon I sauteed the leeks in a 1/2 stick of butter and added lots of salt and pepper to season the soup. I did find that I ended up needing about 2 cups more of broth to make it the perfect soup consistency. Me and my husband topped this delcious soup off with shredded cheddar cheese and fried onions. Thanks for the great recipe!

I make soup every week for our local food pantry. I'm always looking for a soup that is easily duplicated and increased. This was just wonderful! I made 16 quarts and was asked for this to be a regular. Tweeked it a bit just for cost sake. Left out the bacon and used butter. Used vegetable broth so everyone could enjoy and added an 8th cup of white wine per quart from what I'd read in another recipe. Thank you for what will be a staple at our pantry.

What I love most about this recipe is that it is so simple and basic, it is just as great whether you follow it step by step or whether you add your own love. I like to add onions and fresh garlic and if I really want to make it hearty I will add cubed ham on top of the bacon.

This was a super simply and yummy soup.  I did take the advise of another reviewer and added pepper.  Even still, it was a bit bland, so I added some shredded cheddar (only a few tablespoons) and it was perfect.

For a self proclaimed soup-a-holic this soup is incredible...both my husband and I ate WAAAAY too much.  I followed the directions exactly -- used heavy cream.  Next time I might try to use 1/2 & 1/2 but other than that AMAZING!

great soup... nothing better than good soup on a rainy afternoon!  I made a couple of changes... first I added 3 cups of broth and one cup of white wine (because when you cook with it you can drink it) I also added 3 sprays of rosemary to the leeks when I browned them and removed before adding to the soup!  Also pepper is  must in the recipe which it does not call for.  I also only had regular milk 2% on hand and it worked wonders!  All in all a keeper.

Great recipe! Decided to try cooking with leeks for the first time and this recipe was perfect.  Very easy to make.  I only used about 6 slices of bacon.  Instead of mixing the bacon into the soup, I sprinkled it on top before serving.  Better presentation that way.  Note that one of the other recipes called for onions - - I didn't use that recipe b/c the onions would overpower the mild flavor of the leeks.

I used nonfat milk & turkey bacon for this soup. It's a lot healthier this way. It's still very thick like a chowder.  It's my new signature soup everyone loves this soup.  * If you are going to use the turkey drippings to fry the leeks add a little olive oil because the turkey bacon isn't that greasy.

This really was wonderful just the way it was originally written.  We used half turkey bacon and half regular, and half red, half Yukon Gold potatoes.  Tried the suggestion of fat-free half and half and it tasted great.  Will certainly make this again!

I may have overcooked this slightly, which resulted in the potatoes disintegrating.  I wound up with something closer to mashed potatoes than soup!  Still, nobody was complaining.  Delicious and simple.  Am wondering if it could be made simpler by cooking the bacon and leek in the soup pot, then adding the potatoes, broth, etc to stew.  Hmmmm

Wow! I made this with leeks and potatoes from my garden and it was awesome. The perfect comfort meal on a chilly fall day. I actually didn't change a thing with this recipe and it was fantastic. A hit with my wife and kids as well.

Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Didn't add a single seasoning and followed the recipe EXCEPT: I pureed the potatoes once tender with an immersion blender. You should make the bacon and saute the leeks well ahead; it slowed me up and the potatoes got a little gluey. But it was unbelievably delish! VERY hearty. Soooo good.

This is a very easy and versatile soup. For the best flavor while at the grocery store, pick leeks that have more of the white/ light green parts, and don't use the dark green leaves. To make a healthier version leave out the bacon and use milk instead of the cream. Vegetarians can also enjoy the soup, leaving out the bacon and substituting vegetable broth instead of chicken. Even with the lower fat substitutions, you can end up with a thick and delicious soup. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I used skim milk instead of the heavy cream to make it healthier and then used a little cornstarch and water mixture to make it thicker.  Overall though it is a very tasty recipe.  I wish that I added more salt and pepper.  I really didn't add any during cooking and waited for individuals to add their own.

I couldn't believe you could make such a delicious soup with so few ingredients. AMAZING!

This is such an easy and really tasty potato soup!  yum! everyone loved it! To make it healthier, I used low fat milk instead of heavy cream, and used half a package of bacon instead of the whole package.  I also used an onion instead of leeks and sauteed about 2-3 cloves of garlic along with the onion.  Sprinkled shredded chedder cheese on top and it was sooo delicious! Will definitely be making this again, soon!

This was pretty good. I used 1 cup of light cream instead of heavy cream, 2 Wegmann's bags of pre-cut and cleaned leeks (16 oz), half the bacon called for, and 5 cups of low-sodium chicken broth. I think I needed a lot more broth... the result was more like mashed potatoes than a soup--delicious mashed potatoes, but mashed potatoes nonetheless. I added a bit of broth each time I re-heated the soup, and then the consistency was better. Next time I'll use the full amount of bacon and more broth.

It's good, but definitely still needs to be seasoned with salt and pepper in the end. I did like some others and didn't blend all of the bacon, leeks or potatoes to get some texture in there.

Modified in this way, Used a package of Knorr"s leek recipe mix and added it to the broth with the potatoes and used regular milk Vitamin D. Great taste, easy to do

Loved it !! Did it exactly to the recipe and it was great. Next time I'd blend the potatoes before adding the rest of the ingredients. (An easy trick to the bacon prep is to cut the bacon before frying it.)

I only used 6 potatoes, light cream, added a small crown of broccoli and pureed the soup just before serving.  Next time I will omit the bacon as it did nothing for the soup.

Yum!!  This is so good.  Instead of canned broth, I just boil some veggies (celery, carrots, onions) in water and add a bit of powdered chicken stock for flavour.  Once it's done cooking, I blend in a food processor (everything except for the bacon) to make it smooth and creamy - I add the bacon after and it's such a nice warm comforting soup.

Super Delicious!! I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon and used 3 tbls of smart balance butter b/c I didn't have grease from bacon.  This turned out one of the best soups I ever made.  My kids loved it!

I made this according to the recipe and really enjoyed it!  I did take some suggestions and scooped out about half of the potatoes, mashed them roughly and put them back in so it was thicker.

This is SOOOOO GOOD.  I used real bacon bits.  I added a stalk of chopped celery to the leeks and bacon and used 3 Tbs. of unsalted butter (didn't have bacon grease) to saute.  This is the best soup I've had in a long time.

Yummy comfort food.  I use milk instead of cream unless it's a very special, decadent, yummy occasion.  In that case I also add Parmesan.

This soup is absolutely wonderful!  I had a 12 oz. pkg of bacon and that amount was plenty. The only thing I added was a sprinkling of black pepper.  I had never cooked with leeks before. Will definitely make this again and again.  It's a five-star recipe!!

WONDERFUL!  Added black pepper.  Thinned the leftovers with 2% milk the next day.  Next time, I'll try to make it with less fat items and see how well it compares.

This was good but a little rich because of the heavy cream and was not bursting with flavor. The next time I made this I used whole milk and it was very tasty for a healthier version. I did prefer being very liberal with the leeks too. Half and Half works well too.

this was wonderfully tasty but we couldn't help ourselves from putting half the leeks in with the potatoes during the cooking process. Served inside a bread bowl from the french bread recipe from this site. I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful Soup! Indiana is having a cold spell and snow, this soup was great to curl up with on the couch and watch the snow come down. I did add m own touches though. I added 1 bunch of green onions, 4 celery stalks, 4 cloves of garlic. I used half and half instead of cream and also added about a cup of Oliver Winery soft white wine. Absolutely Fabulous!

I made this tonight, and the flavor is very good.  If you're going to puree the potatoes, you'll need to add more broth or water (I added 2 cups more), otherwise you'll have fancy mashed potatoes.  I reserved the bacon crumbles for a topping instead of adding to soup.  It warmed me up after shoveling snow on my driveway.  Thanks for the recipe!

The bacon is what makes this. (and saute-ing the leeks really brings their flavor out) Not at all bland like some potato leek recipes. Everyone loved it. All I had on hand was an 8oz package of Applegate Bacon which is only half of what it calls for but it was perfect. I only had 2 % milk but i also used my immersion blender and pureed it so the soup was still creamy. I will make this again (although maybe not every time I make potato leek soup )

Excellant recipe; I did add a couple of things. I used habanero pork sausage instead of bacon since I didn't have any on hand. I also added (according to other reviews) a teaspoon of garlic powder and coarse ground black pepper to taste. It was a bit thin, so I added a little bit of whole wheat flour until it was sufficiently thickened. Thumbs up from hubby and roommate.

Super easy and quick to make!  The only change I made was to add half the sauted leeks to the potatoes and popped it into the blender to make a cream soup.  Then I threw in the rest of the leeks and bacon into the mixture, garnished with grated cheese and chopped green onions - WOW!  The whole family gobbled it up, even the fussy DH said it was excellent!

Sorry, didn't care for this one.One reason may be because the size of the potatoes was not specified. I used 8 medium sized red, but that was way too much potato. Also, used half & half. Not so sure that was the problem though.On the other hand,the Potato Leek soup III was very good. I used half the butter and substituted half & half for heavy cream =)

This was my first time making a leek soup, and this was a great base recipe!  I added some things: celery, mushrooms, and leftover rotisserie chicken.  I also used half heavy cream and half skim milk.  I like the way it turned out an will be using this recipe again! Thanks!

So. Easy. Its. Ridiculous! It took like a half hour to make this recipe. I followed suggestions and made the following alterations: Used 2 leeks instead of 3. Used low sodium chicken broth. Used a half a pound of bacon. Added garlic to leeks while they were frying. Used 1% milk instead of cream. It was soooo delicious, everyone loved it and I actually can't wait to make another batch!

I should have reviewed this months ago--it's a fantastic soup! I've cut back on the bacon and used milk rather than cream and it's still good, but not as good as the full fat version. It's almost worth the calories for an occasional treat. Delicious!

This recipe was wonderful. I didn't use bacon, just half and half olive oil and butter to make up for the grease. I also added beet greens to the saute pan and they added wonderful color and more depth. I used chicken stock not broth. It was easy and delicious. I will be making it again. Also potato cubes should be about an inch to make cooking time right.

Wow.  Perfect.  I have made this 4 times, and every time is wonderful.  I do tweak it just a little to my taste, by reducing the bacon by 1/2.  I don't want to overpower the taste of the fried leeks.  So delicious!  Oh, and be sure to rinse your leeks VERY well.  I made the mistake of giving them a quick rinse and got sand all in my fried leeks.  I had to rinse them and wash off all the bacon-y goodness. =[

Super good! I followed someone else. I only use 4 large russets and put 6 cups of stock. That way it wasn't so thick when reheated. I also pureed half of the potatoes with the 1/2 & 1/2.

Awesome, delicious soup.  I pureed some of the potaotes in a blender when well cooked and added them back to the soup pot. Made a nice creamy, thick texture. Also added some garlic to the leeks when cooking them. I used turkey bacon and FF half and half, turned out great!

This is delicious, but a bit too fatty. I used milk instead of cream, and just a few of slices of bacon which flavored it nicely. Also I took out a third of the potatoes and mashed them up, then put them back into the pot. Hearty and filling.

This recipe was sensational.  I did everything exactly how you said..EXCEPT I blended most of the potatoes..and left some big chunks in there to give it some texture.  

Also, I bought "Real bacon".  The product sort of like bacon bits but is actually bacon that has been precooked, shredded up into fine pieces, and sealed tight.

It was so good!  

I made my mom taste it and she took a sip and said "Oh my God.."..LOL

DELICIOUS.  

The only thing I would change is adding a little water to it b/c it may be a little too salty for some!

A+++

I made a few changes. Used a package of cream cheese instead of heavy cream. Also put the mixture through the blender, but left out a handful of bacon and leeks to add in at the end. I added some chopped green onions, pepper, and a hint of cayenne. It tastes great!

Very good recipe.  I used half and half instead of cream and 1/3 lb. of bacon. I thought it was too salty.  So I pureed the potato and added 1/2 cup of water.  I also used some cracked black pepper.  I will make this again.

Added salt & pepper to taste and topped with grated cheddar cheese.  Still needed just a bit more to make it special.

Sooo good! I have never had Leek and found this recipe last night. It was so good and even better the next day. I added about a 1/2 more chicken broth and 1/2 cup LESS cream. I boiled potatoes, added half the sauteed leek and used a hand blender on low and pureed about half. I left some chunks. It was perfect. I added a tad bit of salt and pepper. Oh I also sprinkled hot pepper flakes into the leek as I was sauteing it. So good.

This is a very simple, hearty, comfort-type of soup.  We have made this several times.  The only change we make is using ham insead of bacon.  It is an excellent soup for using leftover holiday ham.  Otherwise, we use the exact recipe and it is simply delicious!!

I used 6 cups of chick broth, quartered red skin potatoes with skins on, only 6 slices of bacon, and pured part of the soup as some suggested.  Rather than add the cream to the whole pot, I added a splash of cream  to each bowl before serving.  I think leftovers will re-heat better without the cream.  

The first couple bites I'd rate 4-stars, but after I had a chance to savor the flavors, it was a 5-star recipe to be sure!  Very easy and hard to stop eating.  My two year old even enjoyed it!

I cut down the amounts of some of the ingredients and it turned out great. I used only 1/2 the bacon, 6 potatoes and one big leek.  I think 1lb of bacon would have been way too much.  I also mashed up some potato chunks to make the soup a little bit thicker. I'll be making this again!

this soup was delicious. next time i will omit the bacon entirely or at least use much less than suggested. i think increasing the amount of leeks would also help this recipe.

This is the best potato soup I've ever had.  What makes it taste even better, is the fact that there are so few ingredients creating such a marvelous flavor.

My kids were very skeptical when they saw the leeks...  They loved it!  No leftovers they were practically licking the pot.  They asked if I would make it again next week.

Wow...so rich and wonderful!  I cut the bacon to 3/4 lb., didn't peel the potatoes and partially mashed them with the broth.  The flavors are wonderful, especially with romano and fresh pepper on top.  Due to the calorie and fat content, this will be an occasional treat, but what a treat!  I made Irish Soda Bread to accompany.

This soup is great!  Like others, I added some garlic and celery to the leeks, other than that, kept it as is.  SO GOOD.  Thank you!

Add pepper to leeks as they saute in bacon fat. Use Yukon Gold potatoes for a creamier & yellow soup.

delicious! I also added a bit more water as I like soups more runny. I suggest making this soup when leeks are in season. Paid over $5 for a few crummy stalks. Thanks for the recipe!

Good but not perfect...We followed the recipe exactly and used a hand held mixer for a smoother consistency and added an extra can of broth.  It seemed to lack seasoning?  Strange with all that bacon and sodium in the broth? What did we do wrong?  I added an extra bouillon cube for flavor but still don't think it's worth the calories... Sorry.

GREAT SOUP!!  I made a few SIMPLE changes.  I used 12 small yukon gold potatoes, only 2 large leeks, 1 extra can (14.5 oz) of chicken broth and only 1/2 lb. of bacon, which was plenty!  I simply mashed the potatoes, with a big spoon, in the pot so they were still slightly chunky when I added the leeks and bacon.  Last, I added a mix of 2 tbsp. corn starch mixed with 2tbsp. cold water which thickened the soup perfectly.  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!  Thanks Anna!!

i used only 1/4 lb of bacon and milk instead of cream and it worked out wonerfully. i was afraid that the bacon would mask the other flavors, but it worked out great.

I followed Crabapple's recommendation to throw in a bunch of garlic, and use only half the bacon. I decided to blend about 3/4 of the potatoes and  leeks, and all the garlic and cream in the blender, and despite the fact that I used an extra cup of chicken broth because 4 cups didn't quite cover the potatoes when I was boiling them, it turned out more like mashed potatoes than soup.  In fact, I could stand a wooden spoon up in the "soup." That being said, it was delicious, and I'll absolutely make it again.

Added diced carrots, broccoli and celery.  Used the potato masher to release the starch in the potatoes at the end and never bothered to add the cream....wasn‚Äôt necessary.

This recipe needed some tweaking....first I highly recommend pureeing 1/3 to 1/2 of the boiled potatoes and adding it to the soup! Also reduce the amount of leek by half, and finely chop (instead of slice). Reduce bacon to 2/3 a pound. Add a half a tablespoon of dried thyme, and a bay leaf or two.

I roasted a tri-tip roast (coated the roast with dried onion soup mix in an oven roasting bag) and added the finished drippings to this Creamy Potato Leek Soup.  It was outstanding.

This one is a definite keeper!

Great recipe.  Will make again but next time less bacon and smaller cuts.   Very easy and delicious.  Even my 7 year old loved it and she is a picky one!

This was pretty good, but kind of bland. I used 5 russet gold potatoes instead of 8, and just used the entire package of bacon, and it STILL needs salt to really bring out the best flavor. I just sprinkle a little on each bowl (cracked rough from a grinder) and it perks right up. Also, the broth seemed a little thin, so the next time I make it, I'll add a couple tablespoons of corn starch to thicken it up.

I used hot dogs sliced both long and short for small bits instead of bacon, but used bacon drippings from another time. I added cauliflower steamed in my pressure cooker at the end. It was GREAT.

I used German Butterball potatoes.  Once I added the cooked leeks to the potato/broth mixture I used a stick blender to partially blend the soup.  Then I added the diced bacon and stirred in half and half rather than heavy cream.  Rich, hearty and delicious.  A perfect Fall weather soup to serve with crusty French bread and a green salad.

I used russet potatoes, that were not particularly large,  when I boiled them with the stock they mashed them selves a bit as they cooked and when it was done it was like very thick mashed potatoes with cubes.[ also it stuck to the bottom of the pot and nearly burnt]    I didn't measure the amount of half and half i used but it was probably double (aka 2 cups)the recipe called for  heavy cream, to get this to more of a soup consistency.    I took an  easy way and used pre cooked crumbled bacon (1 cup) and that was plenty of bacon.  good simple recipe, I did end up adding a keg of salt and a fair amount of pepper. Initially I did top it with shredded cheddar, but it actually seemed to mask the good flavor a bit. also my leeks were fairly small as far as leeks go.   I would double the recipe next time as we were having it for dinner and it was only about 4 medium
(20 oz)  bowls full.
up date 5/22/18: so i did double everything; volume wise ......but  8 med-large russets which was probably a bit more than double the smaller ones (closer in size to most other potatoes)   still had the same issue with sticking/nearly burning mashed potatoes(until I added the extra liquid) . THINGS I CHANGED : This time around I did add an additional full quart of chicken stock(so 3 all together), and  it didn't need  quite that much   so it came out more liquidity than a typical potato soup.  I did use heavy cream  in the prescribed amount, but the soup was less white and flavorful, because of the

I made this soup exactly like it said, except I used a bag of frozen potatoes obrien, and instead of the cream a can of evaporated milk with about 2 oz of sour cream, 3 cups of broth instead of four and 2 leeks instead of 3, Canadian bacon instead of the other bacon and of course that meant I had to saute the leeks in butter instead of bacon fat. Also I added fresh ground pepper, cayenne and chili pepper and himalayan sea salt. Other wise - it was exactly the same. Yummy.

I pur√©ed the soup with an immersion blender before adding the bacon because I did not want to see the potato pieces or leeks.  I used 1800 ml of chicken stock and cut down to 3/4 cup of half and half.  When I cooked the leeks, I added two chopped celery stocks for some extra veggies.  It was delicious!

This is the perfect soup for a cold winter's evening. It doesn't take long to make and has simple, rich flavors. Most recently, I tried a dairy-free version in which I substituted whole coconut milk for the cream. It tasted exactly the same to me... delicious!

THis soup is bland and watery.   Apparently it omits a crucial step in the instructions:   puree the cooked potatoes.   That would, however, still leave it quite bland so add various spices to taste.   Personally, i am not using this recipe again because it is so poorly written.   I am very surprised at all recipes for accepting it.

This soup turns out pretty thick, so I use light cream or half and half. Why spend the calories if not necessary? I also always have extra chicken broth on hand to get it to the right consistency. I love creamy soup, but I do prefer it less thick than most. Any potato is good, but I thought red were the best. That may attribute to different consistencies. A little shredded cheese and green onion to garnish is good too.

Really enjoyed it.  Great recipe.  Smart to saute the leaks in the bacon fat first.  I used Genoa salami instead of bacon and added tumeric  seasoning to brighten it up. WOW.

We were looking for a potato leek soup with summer sausage so we substituted summer sausage. We found the soup bland with this substitution so we added 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp thyme and a few pats of butter. Doesn't quite taste like the recipient we lost but good enough to make again.

Turned out great! I used sour cream in place of the heavy cream  and just "country mashed" the potatoes.

Great cold weather soup.   The soup was a little thick so just added a little more chicken broth .  Tasted better the next day.

A versatile recipe - I simplified and used one pot to cook a few strips of bacon. Removed excess fat, then sauteed some onions and garlic (because, well, onions and garlic), then added the leeks. Added 1/4 cup flour to thicken, then the stock and potatoes  until cooked.  Finished with 2% milk and s&p.  Kids love this soup - thanks!

I'm rating 3 stars because it's a great base, but it's the comment suggestions that make it even better! I only had red potatoes- so I adjusted for that, plus divided it all in half. I did add garlic to the veggies when I sauteed them, I used 4 asparagus with my leek, and I pureed everything like one user suggested. A little salt and pepper is all you need to make it awesome. Oh, and it's AMAZING with a slice of sourdough, tomato, and cottage cheese on the side!

Great basic recipe. I included garlic (how does any dish survive without garlic???), used half the bacon (I find it overpowers the flavour of the veggies)  and used white pepper instead of black  when adding the S & P.  I also did as another suggested and took out about 1/4 of the soup and used my immersion blender on it, then added back in. Gives a nice consistency and needs less cream at the end. I have frozen some.

Soup is awesome! We needed to add about 1.5 cups extra liquid because it got too thick. Simple to make and yummy all around. Add grated cheese to finish it off!

I cut the amount of bacon in half, added onions, garlic, and used lowfat milk, then hit it with an immersion blender. It could use a little seasoning, but other than that, I would definitely make this again.

Made it with turkey bacon instead, and half of the amount called for. So when sauteing the leeks, I added a Tbsp. of butter. Otherwise followed the recipe. Didn't add salt or pepper. It was delicious! Next time I will puree the potatoes for a creamy take.

This is a great comfort food recipe. I converted it for the instant pot: I saut√©ed the leeks and a small, minced garlic clove in bacon grease in the IP. Then added the potatoes and broth. I let it cook at high pressure for 7 minutes and let it sit for a couple of minutes then quick released the remaining pressure. I set the pot back to saut√© and added the cream, and just a little cornstarch for thickening. I cooked the bacon on the stovetop while the rest of the soup was under pressure. I garnished with the bacon, green onion and shredded cheddar. Sooooo good.

It is an okay base i suppose but i made it entirely different.
First i got my a couple cut up strips of bacon in the soup pot once those were cooked i added the leeks til fragrant and soft. Added celery and grated carrot (as its one less thing to mash up and adds nice bits of colour) into the cooking leeks and bacon. added bay leaf, oregano, pepper and cooked til veggies were soft. Added taters and stock and cooked until they were tender. in a separate pot i melted 5 tbsp of butter, added 5 tbsp of flour to form a roux, added 2 cups of milk ( now its basically ready and you are not waiting 20 minutes for a large batch to thicken) and cooked until it  it thickened and then added to soup pot  for a few minutes them mashed  just enough to get creamy and leave a few chunks.
breaking everything down in separate pots you rob yourself of the flavour from the veg. let your potatoes cook in the stock and sauted veg in order to have some taste. I can see why one would feel  it lacked flavour.

If you think this recipe is missing something, you are wrong. Other steps could be added, but its unnecessary. Classic needs no explanation. 

I do use a homemade broth together with canned broth. This helps give more complex flavor to the base. I do not use s&p until the end. I make smaller batches, making sure to not oversalt before the bacon is added.  Can be a great potato soup,  asparagus, chowder etc.  Hubby (chef) loves it. 

Perfectly simple with sourdough rolls and butter.

I made this recipe for my wife, as potato leek is her favorite kind of soup. It was a big hit and, every time we have it, she says it's the best she's ever had. My only criticism would be that, if you have leftovers, then by the next day it becomes more like mashed potatoes, but it still tastes great. We make it exactly as the recipe says, and it's great.

Omg, only 5 ingredients and this soup is delicious!  I've made this recipe twice now. I followed the recipe, except used leftover ham instead of bacon, and milk instead of cream (lower in fat).  Some people are commenting about how to make the liquid thicker (mashing some of the potatoes, adding potato powder, etc). I found, the easiest way, is, while chopping some of the potatoes, make some of them smaller pieces.  When you boil the potatoes, the small ones disintegrate, making the liquid thicker. When I run out of ham, I look forward to trying it with the bacon. I imagine it will be even better! This recipe will definitely be added to my permanent recipe box!

Make a large pot of soup once a week and this is a new one on our love this list!  Super easy and 1" thick sliced bacon is the way to go.  We had the full cream so cheese wasn't desired.  VERY FILLING!  Perfect soup and salad meal.

i made this today. I did not use bacon but substituted  a few tablespoons of butter.  When it was done I took out some potato cubes and used my hand blender to pur√©e what was left. Then I added the potaoes back in. It is a very simple soup base for a creamy soup. Add broccoli and cheddar, corn or bacon to make different soups.  I love it as plain potao leek soup.

Such a delicious soup! We made soup bowls to go with it and it was amazing!
We did part cream and part milk because we didn't have enough cream for the full 1 cup. It was fantastic. We also don't love bacon so we used some chicken sausage. It didn't leave enough grease to saute the leeks so we cooked those in olive oil. Honestly, it was fabulous. We will make this again for sure!

Excellent, simple recipe! It was far more filling than I anticipated. I substituted whole milk for the cream and blended it with a hand blender. This will be lovely on cold winter nights!

Heads up, if you use baking size russets, only use 4- 5. I used 7 and ended up with delish mashed potatoes. Nothing more milk didn't fix. Sprinkle with chive or paprika, something, for color.

I took the liberty of frying garlic with the leeks. Also used about half of the bacon called for. Garnished with shredded cheddar and tsp. of sour cream. Texture was like a chowder.  Very hearty and filling. Needed recipe for leeks pulled out of garden. Very nice!

This is an excellent recipe. Really good with thick bacon and parmesan cheese. Can sub milk for cream but cream is best!  I've had it in my regular rotation for a few years now and my family loves it! Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

Wow!  My co worker gave me some leeks from his garden.  I had no clue what to do with them, but this was so good I'm planting leeks in my garden next year!

A family favorite. I use turkey bacon, half and half and butter milk. Leeks are simmered with potatoes.

I didn't have enough potatoes to make the recipe as written, however I went ahead since I had too many leeks!  I used turkey bacon and 1% milk to cut down on calories/fat and it turned out really well.  I left the peels on my potatoes as well, just as a personal preference.  I'll make this again with my changes!

AWESOME!!!  I have made this soup 4 times now and even make it for company.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and definitely good, but the leeks turned my soup bright green, which I didn't love.  The next time I followed the recipe exactly, except used a whole chopped sweet onion, cooked down in butter and garnished it with green onions and a bit of crumbled bacon.  The third time I settled on my favorite version, which was using the onions instead of leaks (and garnishing with green onions) and only using 3 strips of bacon and using a couple tablespoons of ham base (Better than Boullion ham base) and 2% milk.  This is a healthier version yet still incredibly flavorful!  Puree'ing the potatoes will make it perfectly thick without all of the bacon and cream.

Loved this recipe!  I added cheddar cheese and a little bit of pepper to it, and then put it through the blender to make a smooth, creamy soup.  Everyone who has tried it loves it!  Even my two year old asks for more!

This was a really good cream of potato and leek soup, but I did make a few modifications. I used a third of the recommended bacon (1 pound is way too much) and cut the strips into 1/4" pieces instead of 1". I used 6 cups of chicken broth, two large leeks, 2 cloves of minced garlic and 6 medium potatoes. As others suggested, I mixed together the sauteed leeks and garlic with the broth and potatoes and then pureed 2/3 of this soup in a blender. I then mixed the puree, remaining broth & potatoes, bacon and 1 cup 18% table cream (I didn't have heavy cream) and added pepper to taste. I was really pleased with the end result. It definitely reminded me of my grandma's recipe that I ate all the time as a kid. I will probably use 3 cloves of garlic and 3 leeks next time I make it.

Very easy and lots of flavor for such simplicity.  I used only a quarter pack of bacon because that's all I had plus watching fat content.  It still had great bacon flavor, added 3 cloves chopped garlic to leeks at last minutes of saut√©.  Substituted half can of evaporated 2% milk and regular milk Instead of cream.  Partially mashed everything with hand potatoe masher.  Turned out chunky, thick and delicious. Everyone, including picky kids enjoyed it.  Will be a 'keeper' for easy light dinners.

I loved this recipe - it was very simple, and tasted delicious! I had some leftover bacon that I heated up the skillet, so I ended up just cooking the leeks in a bit of butter and canola oil. Super tasty! Thanks for a great recipe!

Good, but mine needed more liquid.   I did decide to follow anothers advise and mash, ut it turned out more like mashed potatoes until I added more cream and a little more broth.  But the taste was good.

I added garlic and used half-and-half, as recommended by other reviewers.  Note:  This can be made ahead, too.  I cooked the potatoes, added the leeks, and then used a stick blender just to make it slightly smoother.  I refrigerated it (I kept the bacon separate) and then before serving I re-heated the mixture.  When it was hot I added the bacon and the half-and-half.  That worked fine.  It was nice to be able to get the messy part done and the kitchen cleaned before the guests arrived. It only got four stars because we found it a bit bland, but it did have a nice taste and would be a good base for adding in other ingredients.

Love it!  My whole family including 3 kids age 8, 6 & 5 love it.  My daughter doesn't do dairy so we just scoop hers out before adding the cream.  I typically substitute half&half because I always have it on hand.  I have also subsituted left over ham for the bacon and it is ALWAYS a huge hit!

Simple and perfect!  I made it just as the recipe is written, except I used 5 cups of broth with my 8 potatoes.  Maybe my potatoes were were larger?  Also I didn't peel my potatoes.  I served it with a fresh grind of pepper on top and it was fantastic!

Great, easy recipe.  Followed the advice of a couple reviewers and added 2 cloves of garlic to the leeks while sauteing.  We love spicy foods, so I chopped up a red jalapeno and sauteed that as well!  Using a potato masher right in the pan, I lightly mashed the potatoes - loved the consistency.    When we reheated this for left overs, we added some diced chicken to it -- WOW!  A meal in a bowl.  This is a very flexible recipe!

This was delicious. I ended up using two pieces of bacon and four leeks. I used half Yukon potatoes and half red potatoes. I used one cup heavy cream and 5 cups of water. I separated the green leek parts and boiled them with the potatoes. Then I fished out the green sections out later and added the cut up white parts. I mashed everything after I stopped the boil. It was quite good. I will use this for my Thanksgiving meal, substituting it for the usual mashed potatoes.

Followed the recipe to a 'T' ----- plus blended over half of it in blender for a smooth soup --- only thing I would do different next time is DOUBLE everything as it was the most delicious, easiest, wonderful, flavorful soup EVER and was SO great had to share -- so there were no seconds :(

This is fantastic!!  I used the ingredients as they were listed.  I did add 1 cup of hot water so that I could use my immersion blender to smooth it out my kids don't like lumpy soup. Will definitely make this again :)

I have made an easier or more tastier Leek & Potatoe soup.  The only modification made was to partially puree it with 3/4 of the bacon, then stiring in the remainder before serving it and topping it with a old cheddar cheese.  My family loved it!

This was a really good, basic potato leek soup.  I used nearly a whole 5 pound bag of Yukon Gold potatoes, 4 smallish leeks, chicken stock and half and half.  Make sure you slice and clean the leeks properly, slicing them the long way and then again in half-moons.  Rinse them in a bowl of cold, clean water to wash away all the silt.  I accidentally burned about 2/3 of my bacon, but it was all for the best because I think a whole pound might have made this too decadent for us.  We thought the soup needed salt, but maybe that was because we didn't use all the bacon.  I also ran a hand blender through the soup, making it mostly pureed but still a little chunky.  It was rich with the half and half, but I'm sure heavy cream really does the trick.  The was a good, hearty fall soup and I will definitely make it again.

Delicious flavor and texture.  A good simple recipe with only 5 ingredients.  I did rate it a 4 instead of a 5 because I did have to alter the proportions.  I used 6 cups chx broth and 6 medium sized RED potatoes with skin intact, half the bacon and half the 1/2 n 1/2, and I added garlic.  I wanted a more soupy than stewy texture.  It STILL turned out with a gravy/stew-like consistency.  Not a tragedy.  But I could not imagine the consistency of the recipe as written.  My 15 yr old loved it, my 9 yr old liked it (its hard to knock his socks off at this age!).  I quite liked it as did my husband, and I will probably make it again.

This soup is AMAZING!!! I did add one ingredient, I added about 3 cloves of minced garlic to the bacon grease before adding the leeks. I also substituted 18% cream for the heavy cream to help lighten this up a bit. Serve with some shredded cheddar on top and this is an amazing, hearty dinner!!

This was delicious and will now be my go to potato soup recipe.   I did change a few things. I only used 6 potatoes , only 1 leek, and 5 strips of bacon.  I also cooked the leeks in all of the bacon renderings but then added about 1 1/2 TBSP of flour to the leeks. I cooked it for a minute or two, added my milk and half and half combo (I did a half cup of each) to the leeks, let it thicken up a little, then added it to the soup. I topped it with cheddar cheese and the bacon pieces and it was delicious. My boys LOVED it, too!

This recipe is amazing! I didn't have any leeks on hand, so I just used a large sweet onion in place of the leek and it was fabulous!!! Aside from that I followed the recipe exactly as written. Some people said they blended the potatoes, but I thought that chopping the potatoes small and being a little rough with them when I stirred them broke them up and gave the desired texture. This is such an easy recipe, and it is scrumptious. I will make this again and again!!!

This was my first adventure cooking with leeks, and I thought that the flavor of this soup was delicious. However, I really prefer a very thick potato soup and no matter what I tried (slightly mashing the potatoes and adding a cornstarch slurry) I couldn't get this to the thickness I like.  I'll probably stick with my old standby recipe for potato soup, but add leeks.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good! My husband ate it up and said it was the best potato soup I every made. I only had two leeks and instead of cream used equal parts of half n' half and 1/2% milk. Didn't matter, yum!

So good!  I had to use 2% milk because that's all I had, but if I used heavy cream it certainly wouldn't decrease the rating : )

Amazing! And very simple to make. My boyfriend and I use this recipe when he's making dinner. He's followed directions to a tee, twice -- and it's turned out excellent both times. We warm up some fresh Italian bread from the store as a side.

Very good.  Cooked as stated except ended up adding more chicken stock (it was way too thick) and used 2% evap milk vs cream (to try to lighten it up a bit).  I'd make it again, but maybe add some celery.  Oh, I also used an immersion blender b/c my kids won't eat anything green (had to hide the leeks!).

Great recipe. I didn't have any broth so just used water, didn't have and cream so used evaporated milk and only used 3 pieces of bacon.Turned out really good. Will make it again using broth to see if it makes a differnce. Also tossed in a little white pepper. My family loved it!Thanks!

We've made this soup lots of times now.  I've discovered a few enhancements that work.  We use bacon that we have trimmed the fat off and browned in a tablespoon of Rice Bran oil.  We set aside the bacon, puree the soup and add the bacon bits later on.  DEFINITELY use salt reduced chicken stock...or better still -  home-made chicken stock.  We felt guilty using heavy cream so substituted full-cream milk instead, but if you do this, use a starchy potato like a large Russett or Desiree.  It doesn't detract from the flavor at all.  We prefer this soup pureed but it really tastes nice with some pepper added and chopped chives stirred in at the end.  If you aren't worried about fat content....try stirring a tablespoon of cream cheese in at the end.  Heat the soup gently while stirring in the cheese..then add the bacon and chives.

This soup is very tasty and very hearty.  In order to make it healthier, I didn't peel the potatoes, subbed 1 lb of canadian bacon for 1 lb of bacon, and 1 cup of fat free milk instead of heavy cream.  A serving was approximately 2 cups and sufficiently filling.

This is one satisfying soup!  I just put in 1/2 of the bacon it asked for.  And you have to have some garlic flavour in there, whether it's a bit of powder in the stock or sauteed with the leeks.

I LOVE simple recipes that require only a few steps.  This was DELICIOUS!  I used only 8 oz. of bacon instead of the recommended 1 lb.  I also used only 1/2 c cream, pouring it in at the very last, when the pot was off the heat.  It really did not need any other seasoning; PERFECT!

Throw in a handfull of chopped fresh dill right at the end, and you have exactly a traditional Irish recipe that my Great Aunt Eileen brought over after WWII.  One of my favorites.  Goes well with salmon baked in cream

I use 5-6 large russet potatoes, 2-3 cloves of garlic crushed and cooked in with the leeks, one extra cup of broth, and a half a cup more of heavy cream.    I've made this 4-5 times and just love it!!!  It seems like a lot of leeks, but comes out beautiful.    There is a place in Chicago called Pizza Capri, with potato leek soup that is the best I've ever had...this soup rivals that one.  I've tried a lot of potato soup recipes trying to match the Chicago recipe (because I can't live without it), and this is it!!!  A lot of the negative reviews seem to say the recipe is vague or the soup too thick.  Soup can be tricky.  You have to taste as you go and add things to taste.  This recipe with the adjustments I listed above, is the way I like it ...and is EXCELLENT!!!

I really thought this soup was delicious.  I used 6 medium russett potatoes and by the time I finished cutting up the bacon and frying it, the broth had boiled down so I added a little extra broth. Very easy to make and very tasty!

This was my first attempt at making soup (other than  warming it straight from the can), and while the instructions are unclear, the soup itself was good enough for five stars.  I used sliced red potatoes, just enough for the whole four cups of broth to cover.  I replaced the bacon with ham and used low sodium ingredients.  It has a delicious, mellow flavour and is more stew than soup.  I served it with shredded cheddar and fresh pepper.

I found it bland and disappointing.  Wish I had read beyond the first page of reviews before spending the time and ingredients to make this.  Maybe I did something wrong, but then the directions are pretty vague.  Trying to make it more palatable, I added some grated swiss and gruyere cheese and a spoonful of sour cream.  Still so-so.  Maybe the leftovers will be better tomorrow or maybe I'll have an epiphany about the right spices to liven up the flavor.  This soup just didn't do it for me, especially considering all the calories and fat!

This soup took me almost an hour to make and it did not turn out good. The bacon I spent lots of time frying to crispness, but once it was in the soup it tasted all chewy and slippery. Ew. I wont ever make this again!

This was pretty good, but even with some additions, I found it to be a little bland. I added 2 cloves of garlic and salt and pepper. I used half and half to cut down on the fat and also used only 1/2 lb. of bacon and drained most of the fat off before cooking the leeks. I served this with sour cream, grated sharp cheddar and the crumbled bacon.

Really fantastic! I used half & half, which added the perfect flavor/consistency, and blended 1/3 to 1/2 of cooked potatoes in some of the broth for better texture. I didn't have bacon on hand so used leftover sausage & ham. Super yummy!

I've been craving potato leek soup for months, and this hit the spot. I halved the portions since it's just me and my boyfriend, and didn't find it to be bland or boring at all. I only added a teaspoon or so of black pepper for seasoning, and that was more than enough. Yum!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written....On advice of others, I added garlic, used 1/2 as much bacon and used only 6 medium potatoes.  I still think it was too many potatoes and will try this recipe again with 4 potatoes. Oh, and because of so many potatoes, the soup was quite thick so I did add water.  I pureed the whole thing (saved some bacon bits for topping) and then added 2% milk instead of cream.      The taste was good! (but a little heavy on the potato).  The bacon was a nice touch.  Will try adding parmesan topping next time.  Definitely a keeper recipe and I will be making again.  Everyone liked it at my house.

So simple yet so very good.  Took the suggestion of another review and topped with finely grated Parmesan.  Truly the finishing touch.  This will definitely become a winter regular in our house.

This soup is the best! So tasty and even great for heating up later. I think next time I may use milk just to be a little healthier but with the cream it is delicious! Will be making this many times again

SOrry to kill the party, but this was SO boring and bland.  Just average....if you like plain this is for you.  But there was NOTHING robust or interesting about the flavor of this soup.  My KIDS loved it, but my husband wouldn't even finish a bowl.

My family asks for this on a regular basis. Use fresh leeks for the best flavor ! Fabulous!

I agree with other reviewers'--the recipe doesn't specify what KIND of potatoes.  I ended up using 4 medium-sized Russet and, the soup turned out OK.  Little too thick for my taste.  But, I added garam masala (well-known Indian spice), and that made all the difference!

Love this soup!  I replaced the bacon with fresh pepper bacon and I also add in some parmesan cheese.

I followed everything exactly as written with the exception that I used half and half. It was some of the best potato soup, I've ever eaten. I will be making it again and I'll use regular milk. I don't think the flavor will suffer at all by lightening up the milk. I was skeptical when I read that it only had 5 ingredients but I'm a believer now. Make this soup, you won't be sorry!

Don't be put off by the amount of leeks in calls for...it turns out perfect!  I only made slight changes according to what I had without a trip to the store.  I used half & half and only 1/2 lb. bacon.  I also sauted 2 celery, 6 mushrooms and half a sweet onion (to get rid of them).  It was wonderful!

This recipe is super easy and yields tasty and flavorful results. I was on the couch slurping it within 45 minutes. The potatoes I had on hand were a mix of gold Yukon and purple Yukon. The purple potatoes made the soup look funny in color, but the sneaky anti-oxidants make up for it. Like other raters, I subbed milk for cream to cut back on the fat. I will make this again and again.

Good but was better after I put some seasoning in it.  This is a lot like my clam chowder recipe but without clams.  Fish or chicken could be added to this very easily. I mashed some of the potatoes while in the broth before adding other ingredients.  It isn't as pretty as using a blender but was fine for me.

Very easy and delicious. It does need a bit of salt and pepper at the end. I also cooked the potatoes in a bit of the bacon grease before simmering in the chicken stock.

This recipe was awesome and easy. I used only one leek, just because it was my first time working with leeks, and it was delicious. Next time I will probably use two, since three might be a bit much. Instead of heavy cream, since I wanted to avoid extra fat due to the bacon, I substituted 1/2 cup fat free evaporated milk and 1/2 cup 1% milk. Also, before adding all the ingredients, I took out about 1.5 cups of soft potatoes and pureed them with the immersion blender and added them back in. It made the soup thicker and more creamy. It was SO good. I plan to freeze it and enjoy it later on as well.

This was my first attempt at making potato soup. It was good  but a little too many leeks. I did follow the recipe except for adding reindeer sausage instead of the bacon and used skim milk in place of the cream.  I tasted it when it was done and wanted to make some changes.  I added minced garlic and 1 tablespoon of dijon mustard. The mustard was really good with the sausage.  I did need to add extra water too but i dont like thick soup.  Also I do think that next time i make this i will cut my leeks to maybe only 1 or 2.  This soup is good comfort food but I still think it needs some spice added to it a little plain for me.

Really enjoyed this.  I use a medium sized brown baking potato and scale the recipe down for two servings.  Would recommend bringing potatoes and broth to a boil over medium-high heat and then reducing it to medium heat to continue cooking until the potatoes are tender and the broth reduces and thickens (takes about 20 minutes total).

This soup is so good!  I like mine really thick so I mashed some of the extra potatoes I put in!  I also added some carrots, celery and mushrooms while using only half the bacon (1 pound would have dwarfed the other flavors).  I didn't have cream so I used half and half and it came out great.... Had to add a little corn starch at the end to make it extra thick and creamy.  YUM!

This was so good, and just what I was looking for.  I didn't use bacon, though.  Only bacon drippings which I had preserved from a breakfast of bacon and eggs.  I used about 7 potatoes, and might use less next time, because it is rather thick.  I used half cream and half 2% milk.  The potatoes already thicken the soup enough.  Using only milk wouldn't be too bad either.  I blended everything to make it smooth.

This soup seems to have the right general idea but I found it a bit bland. I did alter the orignal recipe to keep from having a heart attack while eating the darn stuff. So I don't feel like I can honestly give it less than 4 stars. I used half the amount of bacon and replaced the heavy cream with equal parts of half and half and skim milk.  I used about 1.5 pounds of yukon gold potatoes. I blended about half of the broth and potato mixture to thicken it up a bit. My soup loving daughter (that I made it for) said it was okay, just nothing special. I may give this one more try.

This soup is really good! I didn't give it 5 stars b/c I made a few alterations so that it's healthier. Instead of using ham, I used turkey ham. Also I used 2% milk instead of heavy cream and skipped the grated cheese garnish.  As I love garlic, I thru in 2 cloves into the leek saute.

i made this nearly exactly the way it was written (used fingerling potatoes sliced length-wise and half & half instead of cream) and it tasted good, but not great. i really wanted to fawn over this recipe, but it just lacked body and imho, needed a bit of acidity to balance it all out. so i took the advice of some other reviewers and blended a third of the soup so i could leave the integrity of most of the fingerlings intact and mixed the blended portion back in. then, i stirred in a tablespoon of worcestershire. and what once was good became great. even still, thanks for such an easy-to-prepare and versatile recipe!

It was okay. Good enough to finish the soup but it definitely needed cheese and  bacon sprinkled when it was done.

Delicious soup! I followed the recipe except added water instead of heavy cream, for us lactose intolerant people. I also blended it all together, which made it a lovely green. Very flavorful, I will make this again!

I only gave it 4 stars since I didn't do it exactly as the recipe states.  I omitted the bacon, added more leek, and more potatoes.  I also added salt and pepper to taste.  I loved it though and it's a wonderful soup for cold winter days.  I'll be making this for a long time to come.

Great soup!  I made no changes, other than to use less bacon.  Thick and scrumptious.

Used milk instead of cream and left out bacon but it still came out very thick.  I needed to add more broth to make it more like soup than mashed potatoes.  Still very tasty.

I changed two ingredients to cut fat, for the bacon I used turkey bacon and for heavy cream I used half and half. I also used my pressure cooker to cut cooking time. I first cooked the bacon in the cooker, removed and then saut√©ed the leeks in the grease. I threw the bacon, chicken broth, and Yukon potatoes in with the leeks. I closed the cooker and got up to pressure and timed it eight minutes. Then released the pressure immediately and took a small portion of soup and puree it to thicken the soup. I put in the half and half and simmered for five minutes. WOW, it was delicious

Great base recipe! I had different ingredients laying around so I used it more as a guideline. I also halved the recipe. I used the following ingredients:
2 cups beef broth
2 cups water
4 baking potatoes
1/2 lb turkey bacon
3 tbs. veg oil (for cooking turkey bacon faster)
1 tbs. butter (for sauteeing leek and onion)
1 leek
1/4 a white onion
1/2 cup heavy cream

I sauteed the onion with the leeks, and added the water to the broth and just cooked it higher so that the potatoes had enough water to cook in, but so the soup wasn't so liquidy.

So, I basically used the same recipe, just different ingredients. :)

Kaiser rolls made a great side bread for dipping!

This was phenomenal! I was very impressed, being that this was my first time cooking with leeks, that these few ingredients could come together so nicely! I used less bacon and sauteed the leeks for about 7 minutes. I also added some butter to the potatoes and had to add a little milk at the end. I will be making this often throughout the winter! Thanks :)

This soup was a meal in itself! Rich and creamy. I can't believe the flavour with only 5 ingredients (not counting the cheese topping). I pureed some of the potato, stock and leeks before adding the cooked bacon for extra creaminess.

Very easy and tasty.  I substituted skim milk for half and half, and used Canadian bacon to cut down on the calories.  Yummy!

I used smoked sausage links which I sauteed and sliced before adding in lieu of bacon.  I sauteed the leek in the sausage dripping, used half and half and add'l broth rather than heavy cream and I did add white pepper and nutmeg which I really think added to the flavor of this soup. It turned out delicious. Maybe I would also like it just as well if I made it letter to letter per the recipe but I'm afraid the mad scientist in me took over.

This was so easy, and was very tasty, my potatoes were to big for my pot and I had to remove quite a few of them to fit the other ingredients, so make sure to use a really big pot.

This was a very tasty soup. The only complaint I had was that the bacon ended up being soggy and soft. I like my bacon to be crisp, so next time I will just garnish the soup with crumbled bacon rather than blend it into the soup.

A very good, hearty soup. I added 2 large cloves of garlic (minced) to the leeks (sauteed them together) and used 1/2 pound bacon, as other reviewers had suggested. Next time, I might trying to substitute cream for milk, so that I won't have to worry as much about all the fat I am consuming. Will definitely make it again!

Excellent.  I lightened it up with 2% milk.  1/2 lb Low salt bacon and about 1 cup of cubed lean ham.  This basic recipe easily accepts variations.

This is a very good recipe and the only reason I don't give it a 5 is because I used several of the suggestions from other reviews.

We try to make healthier meals for everyday dinners. This is what I did and it worked out wonderfully.

1.used 1/2 the recommended bacon and used turkey bacon WONDERFUL
2. used 6 potatos
3. used 6-8 cups of chicken broth to make it to my taste otherwise WAY TOO thick
4. when cooking the leeks I added salt, pepper, 1 shallot and garlic salt.
5. pureed half the soup and lightly mashed the rest of the potatoes so they weren't so big.

Well, unfortunately we didn't really enjoy this soup much at all.  I tweaked the recipe a little to accommodate our personal  preferences.  I added 3 medium cloves of garlic to the leeks; I used whole milk instead of cream and I added 2 packs of chicken bouillon while the potatoes were boiling (for added flavor).  I also pureed the soup using my hand blender.  The end result was a very rich soup which I ended up having to add another can of chicken broth to as the finished product was still really thick.  The flavor of the bacon overpowered the flavor of everything else.  So while the soup is very quick and easy to prepare, we probably won't make it again.

It's really good,  very filling, but although i put it in more than twice the chicken broth, it didn't resemble soup.  it was more just like creamy potatoes.

Was very good.  I used an extra cup of chicken broth, only 5 strips of bacon, only 1/2 cup of skim milk (wanted to reduce fat), and added some salt, pepper and cayenne pepper.  Like other's suggested, I blended about half of the soup and added it back in - this helped to thicken the soup a bit.  Very good!

I had pretty big potatoes so I only used 6 and most of the liquid had cooked into the potatoes so I had to add about a cup and a half more of water.  I only used 2 leeks and boy was I glad as there was plenty of leek flavor.  We reallly liked this soup it was different from anything we had ever had.  My husband liked it because he thought the leeks tasted a little like cabbage.  We don't eat pork, so I used Turkey Bacon and cooked it in butter to get it nice and crispy (takes a few extra minutes). I served it in a small bread bowl and put in a couple of 1 inch cubes of monterey jack cheese in each - delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum!  I used half and half cream instead of  heavy and used WAY less bacon than called for.  I used reduce salt bacon and reduced sodium chicken stock.  My boyfriend rated it a 10 (for a potato leek soup), even that is saying something!

This was really good! Thank you. I used milk instead of heavy cream, and it still turned out great. I also used leaner bacon, so there wasn't much grease and none left in which to sautee the leeks, so I added a little Smart Balance canola oil to sautee the leeks. Very filling. We enjoyed this.

I thought it was just okay.  It would be better with a different kind of pork.  Maybe salt pork or ham hock instead of bacon?  I don't know.  A little bland and uninteresting.

A very satisfying soup. Maybe not exciting... but it feels good.

This just didn't do it for me.  I really like leeks, but not this recipe.  I too tried to cut out some of the fat by using half and half and less bacon.  My mom, however, liked it so I gave her the recipe.

This soup is great!  I used only 6 small potatoes and 1 cup of half and half instead of heavy cream, both of which were good alterations.

This recipe was easy and very quick to make.  It also tasted great.  My kids loved it and it was gone fast so I don't know how it tastes the next day.  A keeper for sure!

Very easy and yummy, will definitely make again  Tweaked it a bit to our tastes.  After the potatoes were soft, we mashed them in the chicken broth (to make it into a smooth, thicker soup).  Had to add more chicken broth to thin it out a little bit.  We also added lots of pepper, some salt, and some garlic powder.

A very easy recipe to follow and also makes great leftovers. I am not particularily fond of bacon however I still rate it 5 Stars as my bf loves bacon and thought this recipe was fabulous. When I reheated it the following day I sprinkled the soup with grated cheddar - a great addition. My 5 year old picked out the bacon but loved the flavor of the broth, potatoes and leeks. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing!

This was so scrumptous! My two year old loved it too! I changed the serving size to 3 since my husband won't eat it.  I did add some pepper, salt and garlic powder for more flavor.

I really like this soup! I used WAY too many potaoes though and it was almost mashed potatoes but it was still really tasty (added a bit of water to thin it out).  I did add a bit of salt & pepper as well. I gave half of of the batch to my parents and they called me right after eating it and RAVED about it!  However, my boyfriend wasn't too fond of it, he admitted to me, he would have liked it if it was more greasy.  I strongly dissagree!  :)

This is a realy great recipe!  I did what some of the other reviewers said and used less than the full pound of bacon.  I'm going to try replacing half or all of the chicken broth with vegetable broth the next time I make this.  I think it will add some more depth to the flavor.

AWESOME!!!  My whole family loved it, & it was so easy & quick to make!!  I did substitute the bacon with bulk italian sausage & sauteed the leeks in those drippings. I also added about 1 tbsp garlic powder & 1 tbsp black pepper. I served it with crusty french rolls & a salad,it makes a great Fall dinner when it's cold outside.I Will definitely make again, I think I may try adding fresh sliced mushrooms next time...YUM!!!
