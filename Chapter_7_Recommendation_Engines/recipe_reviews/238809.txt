I never would have thought of using my ice cream machine to make a party-size batch of grown-up slushies. I made sure everything was really cold before I put it in the ice cream machine, and I cut back on the sugar just a bit. Really love this idea and I'm definitely doing it again. (I only wish my machine weren't so noisy!) Ah well, a little slushie soothes ragged nerves, right?

These are great - super easy and refreshing. I made sure I chilled all the ingredients really well. They took about 20 minutes to churn into a slush texture. Some people thought it was too sweet, so you could maybe use a less sweet wine and maybe less sugar.
