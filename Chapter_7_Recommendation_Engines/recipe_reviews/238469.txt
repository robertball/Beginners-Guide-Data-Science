Love this recipe!  I used Granny Smith apples - left the peeling on for fiber, flavor, texture and color. I also used fat free Cool Whip and sugar-free instant butterscotch pudding mix.  I was also careful to use Libby's Skinnyfruit no sugar added pineapple. I'm on Weight Watcher's right now and 1 cup is only 3 delicious Smartpoints!

This turned out great, and everyone at my potluck loved it. I peeled the apples and used 1 granny smith and 1 honeycrisp. I used pineapple tidbits with all the juice because I accidentally bought that instead of crushed. It worked fine. I've made this salad before, and instead of peanuts, I use a cup of chopped up Snickers bars. The butterscotch pudding and pineapple really make this recipe better than other similar salads. *update-I just realized that the recipe only calls for an 8 oz can of pineapple, and I have always used a 20 oz can, and it comes out perfectly the way we like it. Also, I use about 12 fun size Snicker bars.

We liked it, but want to try making with fresh pineapple instead of canned.

I thought this salad was very tasty and not overly sweet.  I used some salted caramel coated peanuts with a bit of leftover toffee bits for a bit more texture.  I needed a vegan and gluten-free option for a potluck but this didn't seem to have been a very popular choice.

I left out the peanuts due to so many allergies when I took this to a neighborhood block party.  very pretty and delicious salad.  I also doubled the number of apples (used four) to make it a little healthier.
