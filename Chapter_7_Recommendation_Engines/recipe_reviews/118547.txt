I used corn starch to coat the meat, fresh ginger and garlic, fresh pineapple, and fresh bean sprouts.  I omitted the Worcestershire sauce and used oriental sweet chili sauce.  Added sliced mushrooms, more green pepper.  It was very easy and very tasty.

I tried this recipe recently and thought it was fairly good. I found the "sauce" a little too thick, maybe reduce the flour in the liquid mix. Also, the addition of red pepper chili flakes helped round out the sweetness. Over all I was pleased with the dish and will be making it again.

I already had some pork so I did not do step #1. I just shredded the pork and sauted it in some olive oil before proceeding to step #2. My husband loved this recipie. It really revived my dry cooked pork. I recommend it.

I used less than half the sugar, and I still think it's plenty sweet. But yummy! Reminds me of my mom's sweet and sour pork. I dredged my pork in the 2 T of flour and still had some flour leftover (I think I ended up using less than 1 pound of pork), so I used the remaining to thicken the sauce. Just stirfried the pork, added the green peppers, then added the remaining flour until the pork and peppers were coated. Then I added the liquid and the rest of the veggies. It's easier than removing the pork from the skillet and then adding it back in. Just make sure to only partially cook the pork before putting in the other ingredients, otherwise you'll end up overcooking it. Thanks for the recipe! (By the way, I think this serves more than 4 people, what with all the veggies.)

Followed the basic recipe but added green bell pepper, broccoli, and onion. It was very good, and we'll be making it again.

Very good!  Used some leftover porkchops from the grill.  Also used fresh, chopped pineapple, so I substituted OJ for the reserved liquid.

Used chicken instead of pork. It was great. We will be having this often.

it was okay, I thought it had too many ingredients and steps, with a final result just okay. I will probably never make this again.
