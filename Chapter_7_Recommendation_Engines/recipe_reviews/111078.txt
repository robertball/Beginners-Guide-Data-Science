Really good!  I only used 1 cup of sugar & the bread was still really sweet.  You can definitely taste the honey.  TIP: if you use a dark pan reduce the oven temp to 325.  At 350 for 1 hour, I used one glass (came out perfect) & one metal (burned!) so adjust accordingly.

This is a delicious, moist zucchini bread. I halved the recipe and made four small loaves. I removed half of the batter before adding the nuts and coconut. I added mini chocolate chips to the other half. My mini loaves baked in about 30 minutes. This is definitely worth making again! Thanks for sharing

This recipe produces a very rich, tasty bread which is different from the typical zucchini bread, it was a big hit.  I did reduce the sugar by 1/3 cup because the honey and coconut make it quite sweet.

The bread was super moist but I think it needs more cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also cut back a little of the sugar and substituted applesauce for the oil.

I made this AS WRITTEN-no substitutes or omissions.  Very rich and moist, not too sweet, and I like the fact that it has honey in it.  A great way to use up all that summer zucchini.

Wonderful recipe. It was the best zucchini bread we had ever had.   I grated two 8" zucchini's, so I estimated that part. I only used a1 1/2 cup sugar -- which was good. I added a little extra honey to compensate -- which was completely unnecessary. I chose not to use coconut because it seemed too dry & am happy with that decision. I substituted pumpkin pie spice for nutmeg & it was pleanty good. I probobly heaped my spice spoons.   The other really interesting thing is the walnuts. I grated them in a food processer instead of chopping them. They ended up powdery with the occasional crunchy bit & the nutty taste was mixed in all the bread. I was really happy with this.

good. I didn't have self rising flour so I used the recipe for it on this site.

VERY good!!  I put in half the amount of butter and half the amount of vanilla as the amounts just seemed excessive - skipped the nuts - love this recipe! ALSO - agree that a dark pan should cook at 325 as mine were at the edge of burning after 55 min.  Happy Baking!

I followed the recipe almost exactly - I put less sugar like a lot of the other reviewers, just 1 cup, but put 1 cup honey and 1 cup shredded coconut. It came out wonderfully moist and golden brown at the edges in just about 55 minutes at 180 C. Will definitely make again.

Very good base recipe.  I liked the light base flavors and the rich vanilla.  I used a substitute recipe for self-rising flour and found that there was too much salt in the recipe.  Next time I will cut the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons total, including what should be in the flour.

This is the only recipe I use, have been making it for 3 years now and it flies off the plate every time I take it somewhere. I prefer using the larger zucchini vice small ones , they seem to make a moister bread.

I didn't use quite as much honey or vanilla because I didn't have the full amounts, I used a tad bit more nutmeg & cinnamon. The flavor, moistness, and overall taste was great.
