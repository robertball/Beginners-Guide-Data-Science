I'm happy to be the first reviewer of this cake, and it is very good! I think of pound cakes as being more dense and heavy, but this was on the lighter side. My oven runs hot, and it's good that I checked because it was ready at 35 min. I'm planning to give one loaf to a neighbor, so I had to taste-test it first....with some vanilla ice cream, of course!

I made this cake but added Hershey's baking chips to give it a little more chocolate flavor. Came out great

I tried the batter and it was delicious!  Unfortunately, after making it twice I found it to be very dry and not moist at all.  I"m not sure but think cooking less than 60 minutes would make it better.
