I was unsure at first when reading this recipe, but after making it and trying it, it was very yummy.  The carrots tasted like candy.  Yummy recipe and will make again.  Just to note, my kids wouldn't eat them, but they barely tried them!  (Ages 6, 3 & 3)

Great recipe and so easy.  I leave out the almond extract as often as I add it.

For this past Thanksgiving, everything went well with the Almond Carrots (as directed above). However, I would suggest using only one and half teaspoon of almond extract. Yes, the almond flavoring does go a long way. Overall, this is a great, quick and easy recipe for a vegetable dish.

I didn't care for this too much. It seemed like it would be tasty because I love carrots and almonds but the almond extract was too bold. It may have been because I used imitation almond extract instead of pure. The onions and almond extract is a poor combination. I didn't much taste the oregano in this recipe and if I had left it out, it probably would have tasted the same. I won't be making this again.

I made this recipe for my daughters wedding and it was a hit.  The greatest part is that you can do it the night before so you're not so frantic on the day of the wedding trying to prepare all the last minute food.  I also sprinkled on some toasted slivered almonds as they were served on the plate for a beautiful presentation.

It's a special taste.  I'm not crazy about it but my husband loved it.  Make sure you cook the carrots JUST RIGHT (not to hard or soft) or it doesn't come out right.

We really enjoyed these carrots.  I used honey in place of the white sugar, perhaps 2 tbs.  That was my only change.  I seriously doubt I could keep them in the fridge for 24 hours I was picking at them because I couldn't wait 8 hours.  Thanks Ladyem, we will have these often.

Wasnt sure what to expect but the flavours and the crunchiness of the veggies were great together.  Will be trying this with other veggies often.

Interesting.  The taste was unique, not in bad way, but I can't say that it is something that I would make again.

This was a great recipe. I used red bell peppers instead of green, just because that's what I had at hand. Next time I will use 1/2 onion.

Yummy. For Adriana, the lady who didn't like the oregano/almond combination, it might be because you were suppose to use dried BASIL not oregano. Try it again with the right ingredients, you might like it.

This was so delicious, we couldn't wait for it to chill and ate it as a warm side dish with grilled chicken breast rubbed with Carne Asada. Definitely a keeper!

It's really refreshing, i made it for our family easter get together, and i wanted to make a dish that was a little different than the normal cooked carrots recipe, something that would almost be a light refreshing break from the rest of the heavy foods on the plate, and though easter is tomorrow, and i have yet to hear how it went over, my mom and i REALLY like it a lot. i love the sweetness of the almond extract but the kick of the vinegar, and onions, i think everything pairs really well together! will definitely be making it again!

I made this for lunch for a large group.  i quadrupled the amount of carrots & similarly increased the onions and peppers.  I doubled the liquid ingredients & the ratio of liquid to vegetables was just right.  I used only one teaspoon of almond flavoring.  I think I used only 1/2 cup sugar -- because I didn't want it to be too sweet.  I will make it again.
