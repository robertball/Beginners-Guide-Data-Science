These are sooo good!  I made them into bars the first time, but they were hard to cut without crumbling.  Now, I make them as cookies instead.  I roll the dough into 1" balls, then indent with my thumb.  Bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, then fill the indents with jam.  Then I bake for anther 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.  Delicious!

OMG! These cookies are by far some of the best looking and some of the best tasting! They're buttery, "melt in your mouth", sweet little treats that you'll be proud to serve to anyone becasue they look like they came straight out of a bakery! My only change to the recipe was to use almond extract in place of the vanilla as I love the raspberry and almond combination. I also used regular milk instead of evaporated. I baked the loaves on parchment paper and be sure to let the loaves cool completely before cutting so they don't crumble. I had no trouble with cutting. I used a long knife - it's just like cutting biscotti if you've ever done it. My only regret is that I didn't find these at Christmas, but now that I found them I'm definitely going to make them next year and I just might make these for my nieces for Valentines's Day. I would love to try a strawberry jam and vanilla extract combination. I think you could easily substitute a lot of flavor combinations here.... Great cookie!

A very tasty cookie.  My family just loves these.  They are easy to make.  I recommend cooling them for longer than 2 minutes before removing them from the pan to cut.  I would wait 4-6 minutes to do this to prevent breakage because the cookies are still to hot & fragile within 2 minutes.

Learn from my mistakes! Make shorter loaves, because if they are too long, they will break as you move them to a cutting board. Don't be tempted to use more jam, as the weight makes the cookie more prone to breaking in the middle. Now that I've struggled through a batch, I would recommend making 2 inch by 6 inch loaves, as the loaves spread in width while baking. As noted by several others, don't be tempted to make the jam indentation too deep as the individual cookies will break.   The cookies taste great, they just need a bit of finesse before baking. I used seedless raspberry and cherry jams, both were excellent with the almond flavored icing drizzle.  Note - if storing, use waxed paper between layers.

These are very yummy cookies.  My suggestion after making them once is to be sure to line your pan with foil.  The jam can drip a little, and the foil makes clean-up a breeze.  Also, bake on a regular cookie sheet.  I used an air bake sheet the first time and the bottoms didn't get brown and crispy enough.  I did make a batch where I substutited "I can't believe it's not butter" for the regular butter, and used regualr milk rather than evaporated milk and they turned out fine.  Wonderful recipe.  My family and friends rave about them.

Good, buttery cookie with raspberry filling. The icing on top is neccessary as the butter cookie base is not very sweet. The results are both beautiful and tasty. I used this recipe to make raspberry thumbprint cookies rather than the bar shape suggested. As a result, I ddin't have any trouble with the cookies breaking. I also discovered that any flavor jam works well.

This is a pretty simple recipe.  One thing I would suggest is that you use jam or jelly and not a low sugar spread. Low sugar spreads do not have enough sweetness to them and the flavor vanishes into the cookies (at least mine did).  I also tried  to top with an icing with almond flavoring.  This could work, as there are raspberry almond thumbprints on this site that use it.  But I found it was a little over powering, so next time I will stick with the recommended vanilla.

I made these with homemade raspberry jam for the holidays. Lovely light flavor. I did them as thumbprints, but next time I want to do them as the "ribbons" to see how they come out.

Subbed cherry preserves for the raspberry otherwise no changes.  I used a pizza cutter to cut these while still warm and did not have crumbling problems.

I thought these were a lot bigger in person. They came out a little smaller than I thought, but they are still very good cookies! I did follow the recipe as stated and took the advice of a previous reviewer about heating the jam in the microwave for a better consistency for spreading. I also don't know why reviewers stated that cutting was difficult, I didn't have a problem at all. I waited exactly 2 minutes and transferred to a cutting board with two spatulas to prevent breakage and used a very thin knife to cut through these cookies and they cut pretty easily. They taste exquisite! Very soft and crunchy and the jam tops it off! I can't wait to entertain my guests what an attractive dessert!

Wonderful! My boyfriend loved these! I made them into thumbprint cookies like everyone suggested with strawberry jam. To add a little nice touch already to this wonderful treat, i chopped up some almonds fine and dipped the cookie in eggwhite then in the almonds. excellent. thanks

Delicious - I was really afraid to make a log, so I made thumbprint cookies. They're delicious but my batch was not so pretty - the glaze was very wet, wetter than I realized so it was out of control trying to get it on the cookies - I should have added a little more conf.sugar but didn't realize the trouble until it was too late - but the taste is fantastic in spite of that :)

I have a batch of these baking now, my third batch this holiday season!... my husband is going nuts!  They smell simply out of this world.  I followed the directions to a "T" and they turned out nearly perfect, although I have struggled with the cookies spreading as they bake.  I quickly re-shaped and re-formed my well for the jam while they were still hot and before the jam went on.  I salvaged them nicely that way.  The second and third time, I refrigerated the shaped logs for 15 minutes before baking them.  Like Sugar Cookies, these can lose their shape and flatten out if the butter is not chilled again.  Otherwise, they are perfect every time.. so easy to put together.  Thanks you for sharing, Patsy!  They are now an intricate part of my cookie platters during the holidays!  BTW, for those who are having trouble with the cookies breaking, its because you are making your well TOO DEEP.  I keep my cookies exactly 2 inches wide and only make my well about half as deep as the thickness of the cookie.  YUMMO!

These are delicious! We made them for my cousin's wedding and they were a huge hit. We did some with raspberry, some strawberry and some apricot. I think for Christmas I'm gonna try pineapple and orange marmalade. This will be a new cookie staple! Thanks for posting. :)

I loved these. I would suggest trying them as ribbons (per the recipe), rather than round cookies (as suggested in some reviews), as they really look lovely on a plate. I used a sharp knife and didn't have any problem cutting them. They were a hit at our holiday cookie exchange. And delicious - shortbread, jam, and just a touch of icing. yum!

I made these tonight and they are wonderful!  I made logs but didn't make the valley in the middle too deep.  I didn't make them as wide either.  That prevents the cookies from breaking when they are done.  The other thing I did was roll the logs in sliced almonds.  What a difference in the presentation!  I'll try to add a picture. That really dressed them up.  I used seedless raspberry preserves and popped it in the microwave to soften it a little before adding it to the cookies so it was easier to spread.  Basically these are very easy to make and as taste as good as they look!  Definately a keeper!

These cookies are absolutely delicious and easy to make.  When you shape the dough into rolls and make the trench it's the easiest with completely clean slightly wet hands - otherwise you end up sticking to everything.  I used blueberry jam instead of raspberry as it's what I had in the fridge.  I'll definitely be making these again!!!

I took these for a test run last night and am happy to report that they'll definitely be on my cookie plates this year.  They came together in no time - dough is great to work with and shape into logs.  I formed them into 2" X 8" logs; I wouldn't want to go any longer than that. Very festive looking with the raspberry jam down the center.  Very tasty too!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were ok.  I like other raspberry bars better.  Probably won't make again.

Great and Real Easy!! I used a chopstick and rolled it down in the dough to make depression (be sure to really make an almost seems too deep o an impression...the dough expands enough in the first bout of cooking that you need a good impression), also used real milk instead of evaporated and was still great!

Seriously, I can't give this recipe enough stars! By far, my favorite cookie that I made this year! I had none of the problems that other reviewers were mentioning - everything turned out perfectly. The cookies were light and flaky, fruit filling was bursting with flavor and the glaze was just the perfect kicker. LOVE it.

Made these cookies tonight and they have a great taste to them. The cookies were hard to move around without breaking so I would recommend making them into thumbprint cookies instead of ribbons. I chose not to make the icing and am glad I didn't, I think the glaze would have been overkill. Overall the recipe is a great base but not very practical as is. With a little customizing I will certainly keep it and make again. Thanks :)

We've been making these for years, but we call them "Split Seconds". The only difference is that instead of vanilla we use almond extract, which in my opinion tastes better. Of course, that's how I've always had them! Oh, yeah, as far as them falling apart easily what we do is butter the baking sheet really well before putting the dough on, and allow the cookies to cool for a good 5 minutes before cutting them on the cookie sheet, then transferring them to the cooling rack.

Very good! I rolled them into balls and made the indents with my thumbs like previously suggested and they worked really well. I brought these to a meeting and everyone loved them - I didn't have any left to bring home!

made this for Christmas this year too.  My 7 yr old daughter & I made them in 1 inch balls, then made thumb print in them after reading the reviews on how the bars would break.  They turned out great and everyone loves them.

This was a good recipe.  I made them as cookies rather than bars.  I would suggest putting the glaze in a plastic bag and snipping a small hole in one corner so it pours evenly.  I used a spoon and had some too much glaze on some cookies and had a hard time controlling how much and placement of the glaze.

Have made this recipe for a few years now.  Got the recipe from the Taste of Home magazine.  Yummy cookies!  Fun and easy to make, and you can make double and triple batches if you need a cookie to share for an exchange.  I put the cut cookies on a cooling rack over the sink and drizzle the frosting to keep clean up to a minimum.  Love this cookie.

I made my logs a little narrower, made the little finger trough, and I was thrilled the way they turned out. Tasted great and just have wonderful appeal to the eye. Very easy, yet looks elegant! Thanks, Patsy!

These were very simple to make.  I used Smart Balance Buttery Sticks which worked well,  almond extract instead of the vanilla...and raspberry preserves.  I made MANY of these for a formal cocktail party.  For my mass production, I created a system.  After baking the rolls 4 minutes on my seasoned baking stone on parchment paper, I used the back of a butter knife to make a shallow, 1/2 " wide groove and piped in the preserves.  When the preserves were bubbling a little, but the bars were JUST STARTING to brown on the edges indicating that they were browned on the bottom (10 more minutes in my oven), I transferred by sliding the parchment paper onto a cool, flat, hard cutting surface.  When still warm to the touch I piped on the glaze with a #1 Wilton tip (fine) in an even zigzag pattern (BEAUTIFUL)!  I used a very sharp large knife to cut through two rolls at once.  Everyone was pleased with the taste and the professional looks!

I have made these 5x now and have some tips. First of all I always double the batch. They go quick because they are so good! I roll 4 balls of dough and then use parchment paper to roll them into logs. I can cook 4 per tray. I use a tray with no lip so they slide off when they are warm. I do move the cooked log around a bit so it doesn't stick at all. About 2-3 minutes after they come out of the over, I cut them straight down using a big knife. I separate the cut cookies by just a bit. I wait another 10 minutes and then ice them. If you icing melts that is okay too, just drizzle some more on when they are cooler. My newest trick is to put the jam in a ziplock bag, mush it around so there are no lumps, snip the corner of the bag and the jam goes on smooth!! These are great cookies for a cookie exchange as they are beautiful and taste great too!

These are excellent, and super easy.  They're going to look beautiful on the Christmas Cookie trays!  One thing I found, when making the 1/2" indentation down the middle.  I didn't know if this meant 1/2" wide, or 1/2" deep, so I did both.  I recommend you be careful on how deep you make it.  If this area doesn't have a thick enough cookie base left, it will be a weak spot in your finished cookie, which means prone to breaking.  Otherwise, this is perfect the way it is.

Very good recipe!  When I took the pan out of the oven after 10 minutes, I realized I forgot to make the depression down the center.  I did it then and filled it with jam, put it back in the oven and it came out great!  I was able to control the depth better that way.  That's my new method from now on.  Enjoy!

Fantastic! My family loves these so much that it became an addition to our list of Christmas cookies we bake annually! I like the raspberry preserves the best, but I've made them with any and every type of jam and jelly we've had available. Feel free to experiment!

Very tasty - very difficult to do with the bars so I did what other people did and make cookies.  Be careful how much jam you use though - it'll run when you bake it if you aren't careful.  This will get added to my list of cookie standards though.

This is the easiest dessert to whip up quickly! I used a drum stick to roll the little dips into the slabs of dough...and instead of the glaze, I drizzled dark chocolate. I made them for Christmas, but they disappeared before Santa even came to our house...

Awesome cookie! The only problem I had, was I needed to add a bit more flour then called for, I dont have a mixer, so I had to use my beater to cream the sugar butter eggs and vanilla. I had to knead the dough to get the dough perfect.  These cookies are super easy and taste sooooo good.

These just might be the new favorite Christmas cookie at my house!  Easy and delicious.  I will double the recipe next time.  I added almond extract to the glaze as suggested in other reviews, and it was delicious.  I used a chopping blade to cut them while still a little warm, and did't have a problem with crumbling.

Unbelievable flavor. So light and flaky, you won't get that heavy feeling in your stomach after eating SEVERAL. I made this for my hubby who likes jellied treats, but I do not. These are so good that even I can't stop eating them.

These are some of my favorites that I like to make during the holidays. I have changed it a bit by forming them into tablespoon size cookies with a dip for the filling. I guess you could say I turn them into Thumbprint cookies.

I just made these- they are sooooo good! I also substituted the evaporated milk for regular milk and the glaze is delicious. I had no trouble with crumbling when I cut the cookies. I found it easy with a sharp knife 2 minutes after they came out of the oven. I will make these again!!!!

Good flavor, but impossible to cut without breaking the cookies.  I tried different knives, when they were warm, right out of the oven, cold, etc.  If I did manage to cut them, when they were picked up, then the broke!  I didn't make my indentations for the jam very deep either.  They might be fine as a jam thumbprint cookie, but I liked the ribbon look.  It just didn't work out for me, so for a Christmas cookie standard, it won't make my list.

Very good cookie and very quick to make the dough. The cookie tastes more like a shortbread and as many viewers have said, a little tricky to cut up. I let mine cool for a while (15-20 min) before cutting them, and as long as you cut straight down (and not on  an angle), they cut fine. This recipe is a keeper.

I made one batch just as the recipe is written. They turned out yummy.  But I would agree with other posts that  I wouldn't make the the "logs" so long and wide.  They can break easily at those dimensions, even if you let them sit longer to cool.  I decided to make them for a cookie exchange  to yield 100.  The ingredients were converted but the dough was too light to hold the log formation, even at a smaller size.  I reverted to making balls, flattening them and them indented the center with a pastry tool.  These were the best out of all of them.  My family loved them!

I made these and they were incredible! I have never made shortbread before and I've been told that these are basically the same. The only problem I had was with the dough. It was flaky and didn't form to anything. So I got my hands in there, the butter melted and then formed in to a ball. I think I will try them as thumb prints like someone else suggested. These will be my standard Christmas bake exchange cookie!

I've been making  this cookie for 35 years, and it is always one of my top 5 list.  Wish I knew the origin of the original recipe.

Yum!  So easy, and yet so delicious.  I love these types of cookies--jam with shortbread, always my favorite!  I didn't bother with the glaze, and I used margarine instead of butter and was completely fine.  Do be careful with the amount of jam/jelly you use--I was, and some still boiled over onto the side of the cookie.  Still, easy, relatively quick, and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

These tasted great, will def be saving this in my cookie recipe box! The only trouble I has was that if I made the cookie any wider than about a fig newton, no matter what I did, it was pretty unstable...but no worries there all I had to do was before serving cut the cookie in half. They still looked nice and people could grab them without them breaking.

AMAZING!!!!  Everyone told me they were better than bakery bought and I agree!  These will be my "signature" cookie for the holidays.  Err on the side of caution - make the indentation shallow.  When it is time to put the jam on, you can always make the indentation deeper at that time with no problem.

These cookies are wonderful! they have a great buttery taste, a coupled with the jam, they taste even butter! I like to make a thinner layer of jam, so that when it bakes the jam is thicker and stickier P:  as others have mentioned, make the indention about 2/3s to half way down. they break easily!

Family loved this new addition to the cookie tray and these are probably the easiest as well.  I always use parchment paper for baking and I did use wax paper between layers when storing. I also used half and half for the frosting.  My husband has sugar issues so I tried using splenda blend for sugar and half canola oil instead of all butter.  I also used low sugar spread for the jam.  Someone else posted that the low sugar didn't do much for the flavor so I did stir in a bit more splenda into the preserves before I put them on the cookies.  It really wasn't that bad, certainly not as good as originally written but not bad if you need to watch the sugar.  Low sugar spread tend to "leak" off the loaves also so keep that in mind when applying the spread to the loaves.  I also made a few like thumbprints instead of the loaf and they were great also. I will make these again both as written and with changes for my husband.

these completed my Christmas cookie tray making number 10.  easy, quick and pretty.  best probably made the day of or one day ahead of needed event as they can get kind of soft and break apart.  i made with blackberry jam and raspberry jam.

The funniest thing happened with these cookies.  I tasted them warm out of the oven and didn't think they were very good.  However, the next day when they had thoroughly cooled, they were AWESOME!!  Everyone at my Christmas party raved about them.  They're going to be a holiday standard in my house.  Made them a few days in advance, and they kept very well in a plastic container.  Also, I put the glaze in a quart-sized food storage bag then snipped the corner off and piped the glaze over top of the cookies.  They looked as pretty as the picture.

This recipe is a great find!  Something different than the traditional cookie/square and it doesn't take a lot of time or fuss to make.  Lining the pan with tinfoil is good advice because I simply removed the four logs from the baking pan by lifting the tinfoil, without any problem of them breaking.  I cut them on the tinfoil as well.  I did have one small blunder though.  When making the glaze it turned out an unappealing beige/light brown color because neither the vanilla or evap milk I used was while.  So I added some green food coloring for an added Xmas touch and dusted it all with icing sugar.   I'm very pleased.

This is a nice change of pace and it does look pretty on the plate. I substituted strawberry jam and drizzled chocolate syrup instead of the white glaze. This is a versatile cookie that can be adapted to lots of different flavors. Delicious.

Very simple and lovely cookie. Looks like the picture! I took many of the tips offered by others (do not make long logs, do not make the indent too deep, do not move them too soon, etc.). I sliced them on the diagonal, and they turned out very pretty and had nice flavour. I used seedless raspberry jam. I know my family will come home and devour them tonight!!

I love these cookies! They look beautiful on a cookie tray. The first time I made them, they broke easily. I tend to like my cookies brown, so I inadvertently over baked them. Now I'm more careful and they come out perfect. Do not use all fruit, or light preserves, they are too thin. I use all preserves, or 1/2 jam and 1/2 preserves. Any flavor works wonderfully!

So delicious!  I make as directed, but might consider making them into individual cookies.  Everyone loves them.  Use parchment paper to bake them on and put the dough down and mold to size as directed in the recipe.

I tried this recipe and I used the tip to make shorter and narrower rolls so that they would be easier to cut and transfer  and it worked pretty well.  The cookies are very delicate though so next time I will make thumbprint cookies .  My whole family loved these and I will absolutely make them again!  I also used blueberry jam and they turned out great.

These were so easy to make, and were beautiful on a holiday dessert table.  I added 1/4tsp almond extract along with the vanilla extract and used cherry jam.  I filled one log with nutella, it tasted fine, but didn't look quite as pretty.  Will make again!

The first time I made these, I didn't make the depressions wide enough, so I couldn't fit much jam in them, but they were still delicious! I now make them in the form of tiny round cookies, because that's how my family likes it. I recommend cutting them while they are still warm, but not hot out of the oven, as it tends to crack when cut after it has cooled and hardened.

My husband can't keep his hands off of these! They came out just adorable and were very yummy. I would recommend making it a little wider then the recommended (2.5 inches) because they tend to look like bricks once you slice them. Otherwise, I was very pleased with these. I think I may try using some melted chocolate in place of the glaze.... raspberry and chocolate...mmmmm. :-) Thank you!

These are fantastic!  Not only delicious, but also very pretty!  My hubby suggested drizzling them with melted white chcolate instead of the glaze, which sounds yommy - maybe next time, I'll try that.

These are very tasty.  I can never get them to look like the picture but they're still good.
