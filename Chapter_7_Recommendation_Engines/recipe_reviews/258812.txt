It smells awesome.  Peeling and coring the fruits took me the most time to do. Everything else was simple.  
The changes I made;
I omitted the peaches entirely and just used nectarines because I have a huge box of them to get through. 
In the crumble I halved the flour and added rolled oats instead, to add more of a crunch. 
All in all it was easy to make

I didn't have nectarines but did have a ton of peaches so I just used those. I did one and a half times the recipe to put it in a 9x13. Outside of that I left it just as it was and it turned out fantastic. My family loves it and using 9 cups of peaches was awesome!

Skip Dinner.  Seriously.
Modifications:  1/2 c oats, 1/2 c flour, did not boil produce just skinned the ripe fruit.  Added 1 tsp lemon zest, 1/4 t ground ginger and 1/8th t ground nutmeg.   Sooooooooo delicious.  Who needs dinner.  This feeds the soul.  Mmmmmmmm!
