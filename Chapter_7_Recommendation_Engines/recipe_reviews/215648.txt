My grandmother made these for me when I was just a pup.  When I went into the Army, she'd make them for me special when I was home on leave.  That's been almost 50 years ago and I still can taste her dumpling when I close my eyes.  Juanita's recipe is as close to my grandmother's as I've had in years.  Thanks Juanita.  They're fabulous.

I didn't have blackberries, so I used frozen blueberries and because I like thicker sauces, I also added some cornstarch, but otherwise everything else I left the same. We loved it, but it was a  bit too sweet, so next time I make it, I will add less sugar. Thank-you Charlo and Charlo's Mom  for the great recipe!!

I make this every summer we have fresh blackberries but you can also use frozen.  To save time I make the recipe for dumplings on the Bisquick box.  Much faster and tastes very good.  Try it served with vanilla ice cream.  It's a great treat.

Juanita my grandmother was also from So. Mo. and she made these all the time. I think it was a regional recipe as the only people I find that have heard of them are from that area. These are just like grandma used to make!  Thank You!

I chose this based on the rave reviews. It's good, but like eating chunks of pie crust in syrup, not like a fluffy dumpling. All that shortening equals a heavy taste. Good, very filling, and easier to make and serve than a blackberry pie, but if you're thinking light and fluffy, move on.  Also, I used fresh berries that were on the sour side, and 1.75C of sugar was still a little too much, as was a whole 1t of salt. Definitely follow the instructions to add sugar "to taste."

I lost my mother's recipe years ago and this is exactly like the ones she use to make! She cut strips or squares instead of the round balls of dough. Thank you Juanita! This sure brought back some great memories!

I'm SO glad to see a 'generational' recipe.  True Treasures!  My Father, used to make something very similar, using black cherries in it's juice, [I don't know how he preserved the cherries to make the juice] and he made dough with flour,salt,water, rolled out, and cut into strips about 2'' long/1" wide.  Somthing he made when a young man in Ukraine.  My Fathers' Mother passed away when he was 2 years old, and he and his siblings also had to be very creative to feed the family!  I love these kinds of recipes.  God Bless them all! Thank you Charlo, for posting your Mothers' recipe!

My Grandmother was from Missouri as well and she made the best dumplings ever. Same as your recipe with few small changes. She made regular pie dough, no egg yolk or milk and salt was optional and sugar to taste. she never measured her ingredients, somehow she just knew. Try 1 cup butter flavored crisco and 1/3 cup (COLD) water and adding water by tblspns until a nice doughy texture.  Then knead thouroughly. roll dough into strips and drop into berries. Thank you Juantia.

Wonderful to find this! A dear family friend whose roots were in Eastern KY coal mining country, made these for my sons 40 plus years ago. Great recipe for a quick dessert. Any fruit could be used, but blackberries that we had and have plenty of in W. TN, are best. Mrs. Powell made without egg or cinnamon.   Yummm....

The blackberry sauce was great, but could have used less sugar.  The dumplings were way too thick, not fluffy.

I, too, am from SEMO & my mother used to make Blackberry dumplings for me because when she did make a cobbler, I always liked the "bottom" crust the best!

Just made this with a few alterations and it's delicious! I used a mixed berry (raspberry, blackberry, and blueberry) blend, with a half cup more of sugar a tablespoon of honey and about 2 tablespoons of vanilla.  I left out the cinnamon because I don't really care for it.  That turned out wonderful... I did find that I needed quite a bit more milk than the recipe called for for the dough but it all turned out and I'm very happy with the results.

I was thoroughly disappointed with the outcome, especially since the recipe had been rated so highly.  I heeded the advice of others and only used 1 cup of sugar, which was sufficient.  I added a little lemon juice and a pinch of nutmeg to the berries.  I also added 2 tablespoons of corn starch, because the berries never thickened.  The dumplings call for no leavening agent and they tasted doughy and never quite done, although I covered and cooked them an extra 10 mins.  I think Iâ€™ll pick them out and try some Bisquick dumplings to try to save the dish.  Will not be using this recipe again.

this is just what I have been looking for over the past 15 yrs.These are what my granny made.Ihad got the berries right but never got her dumpling stripes right. These are it!!!! Yeah,my granny was from Missouri and Illinois Area too. When the one review here said heavy dumpling I knew I had found the right one. The dumpling are like a cross between the pie dough and biscuits type dumplings which is what my granny's was likeso I'm so happy to have found it.

This is typically the way we make any kind of dish with dumplings.  ALWAYS, dough dropped into a boiling pot.  My mothers name was Juanita and I loved her fruit dumplings.  We lived in NC and she canned all the fruits and veggies she could.  On a cold morning, she would add a pot of fruit dumplings and I loved them.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a winner.

These sound delicious Juanita. We were from the southern WV coalfields and my mother made something similar. For the longest time, I thought that was what people called cobbler. When I retired, I wanted to do some cooking and  started looking for a "cobbler" recipe but as you can imagine, they were radically different. But I tried them too!

It was then I saw people refer to what I was calling cobbler as dumplings. Some guys are just slow huh?
But thanks again for the recipe, I'm gonna try it!

My dad kept talking about blackberry dumplings. He hadn't eaten any since he was a kid. 

I saw blackberries on special at the local supermarket and picked some up and made these.

He said they hit the spot just right. We had them with a little canned evaporated milk poured onto them like he had them as a kid and they were great!

This is not regional, or even America specific, or blackberry specific, or a poverty dish. This is a centuries old breakfast/dessert. Any seasonal fruit will do but I use less sugar, especially for a breakfast. I'm glad to see it has been shared, everyone deserves the joy of Blackberry (Raspberry is Spectacular!) Dumplings. Thank you for sharing!

I grew up in south eastern Ky and we had this every summer during the blackberry season and had it often as the wild blackberries are abundant there. They were always so sweet and delicious. I now have blackberries in my yard that are nice and plump and very sour..yuck...not sure how this is going to turn out but going to try my dumplings with these awful blackberries. However we basically just used a pie crust, biscuit dough dumpling which always turned out fluffy and light. JUst flour, buttermilk, lard or shortening, we used lard then, and rolled out in 2x3 and I/2 inch thick in flour and dropped into the boiling liquid and berries. If the berries didn't thicken we used corn starch or flour to thicken. Thanks for the memories.

It reminded me of my Grand Father's.  He died when I was 12 and I was too young to know I should ask for the recipe.  No one in the family knew how and I've been wanting them for over 39 years.  I decided to try this today and it bought back childhood memories.  I now know why I clean as I cook because my grand dad did and he would fuss at my grand mother to get out of the kitchen while he was cooking because she was a messy cooker, dishes in the sink and on the counters.  He would wash and I would dry. He was a GREAT cook!

My dumplings were too long so I will shorten next time and I will use less sugar too sweet for me now that I've cut it out of my daily diet. 

Overall, EXCELLENT, simple and easy to follow recipe. Thank you!

Can''t wait to make these for my little one! I'm hoping these are something like the ones my I enjoyed made by both of my grandmothers when I was a child. (It's apparently not just a regional recipe as both of my grandmas were from eastern ky and one of them probably never traveled out of state in her life :) )
