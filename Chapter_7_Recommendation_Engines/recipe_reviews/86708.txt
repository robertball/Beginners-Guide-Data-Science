EXCELLENT recipe! I combined 2 tablespoons of butter (melted) and one table spoon of brown sugar and drizzled it on top of the coconut crust during the last 6 minutes of baking and it created a delicious sugar coating which added a ton of flavor!  Everyone loved it--even my husband who isn't a big fan of salmon.

This recipe has potential, but needs a little work.  I would marinate the salmon in the lime juice for a while before coating it in the panko and coconut.  I found that when I cooked it at the reccommended temp, the coconut burned before the fish was cooked.  By covering the fish during cooking, then uncovering and broiling at the end to brown and crisp coating, I think that problem could be solved.  I served it with caribbean rice (from Zattarain's) and a salad.  The rice and salmon go well together!!!

I tried this recipe last night and loved it.  My husband cooked it for our 34th Anniversary dinner, with my help, and it was delicious.  We did bake it covered with aluminum foil, and at the last 5 or 6 minutes we uncovered and drizzeled salmon with melted butter and brown sugar, and just baked it under the broiler till crispy.  We both loved it.  Thanks for the recipe and tips.

Has potential. I used more lemon juice to add additional flavor and cooked it a little longer at a lower temperature to keep it from drying out. I also baked it wrapped in foil and then broiled it for a few minutes at the end to prevent burning the bread/coconut mixture.

Well, I'm giving this a one star rating for it's ease.  I cannot say anything good about the way it tastes.  My DH and I love salmon, and this was such a big disappointment.  I will not be making this again.  Ever.

I made this today and it turned out better than expected, I did change it a little though:   -I toasted the coconut beforehand.   -I didn't have any Panko breadcrumbs so I used rice crispies as a substitute. I also dipped the salmon in egg whites before the breadcrumb mix to make it stick better.   -I followed a recommendation from a comment below and dripped a mix of 1 tsp brown sugar and 2 tsp melted butter on top of the fish, the last six minutes of bake time and it was great!   I used two tbs of canola oil instead of the non stick spray and I thought 425 was too hot so I cooked the fish at 395 and flipped it over halfway through!   I'm sure its excellent with the panko breadcrumbs so I need to try that next time!

I used grouper for this recipe which turned out to be a good choice.  I also added olive oil, sesame oil, and ginger to the lime juice and marinated the fish for 3 hours.  The flavor was great - and the coconut adds an interesting touch.

Sorry, I just don't like this recipe.  The coconut doesn't do a thing for the salmon.  I gave it three stars because it wasn't unpleasant to eat and if you're curious, go ahead, you wouldn't be ruining good salmon or anything.  The next time I want salmon without the work of grilling/sauteeing it, I'll make  Baked Dijon Salmon; that's a fantastic baked salmon recipe.

Added curry to the panko and coconut.  Served with jasmine saffron rice and a side of ginger sauce.  Everyone went back for seconds.

This is an easy, delicious way to prepare salmon!  I made it on the first night of summer because it seemed like a great meal to celebrate summer!  Keep checking the salmon, when it's in the oven.  I left it in a minute too long and some of the coconut blackened.  (It was still yummy, but it didn't look as nice!)  I served it with another recipe from allrecipes, pineapple-lime rice.  It was a great side dish for this recipe.  I will make this dish again and again!

Very simple recipe to follow.  My girlfriend made this and it was excellent with good flavor and texture. With the addition of Thai spices it can be prepared with a little kick.  A bit of fresh Ginger also complements the coconut very well.

This one certainly was...different, and I have my reasons in regards to the coconut 'crust' for giving this three stars. Most of the coconut didn't stick to the fish, so in the end I was left with breadcrumb-coated salmon, and the coconut ended up being too sweet anyways.

This was gobbled up so well by the kids, that us parents hardly got enough.  Tempted to just give it 4 stars, though, as the coconut was getting burned before the panko bread crumbs even browned.  Next time I think I will save the coconut to near the end of the cooking, and maybe broil at that time.  It was not bland as some said and I did not do the brown sugar/butter topping that others recommended.  Do not omit the salt and pepper to taste with the bread crumbs as the recipe states.  I also salted the salmon after the lime juice.

This was good. I used lime juice(more than recipe called for) and added a little brown sugar to the mix of bread crumbs  and coconut. I covered the fish with foil when the coconut started to brown and let it finish cooking.

This is an awesome recipe! I did add 2 T brown sugar and 2 T melted butter to top before popping in oven. Also put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to brown the coconut. Very flavorful and elegant style fish recipe..thank you!

This turned out o be a very yummy dish, like most reviews I did cover the fish for most of the cook time and uncovered it for the last 5 minutes or so. We served it with melted pineapple preserves (just nuked them) and wow was it great.

Came together quickly and easily.  Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect:  Nice and tender, not dry, and loved the hint of sweetness and crunch from the crust.  

Follow the directions, and you'll also give it five stars!

It was pretty good. Different, good for people who are not big fish people, because the sweetness overpowers the saltiness of the fish, I liked it. I love the salmon taste better with other flavorings, not so much sweet stuff. It was a big hit at our dinner. I followed the brown sugar and butter with it as well.

I REALLLLY wanted this recipe to be good, because I love any combination of sweet and suculent, I love coconut and I love salmon... that being said, it was not amazing... the combination really left much to be desired, it was like something was missing... it just did not mesh well together. Bummer.

It is an easy, elegant meal. I do add 2T. of real butter to the mixture and the panko makes it extra light and fluffy topping verses regular bread crumbs.

I made this last night and it was alright. Not my favorite. Should have read some reviews for suggestions because the coconut didn't stick to the fish. If I were to try it again, maybe bread it with egg rather than lemon/lime juice.

This is the best fish I ever ate! My roommate actually made it. We also bought a different kind of fish, a white one, because it was on sale. She also used a ton more lemon juice. Not only are we going to have this again, but we're going to try it with shrimp next because we have so much coconut leftover. And then of course, salmon, because it's on sale at the store this week.

I made this last night. It's great!! I also  combined 2 tablespoons of butter (melted) and one table spoon of brown sugar and drizzled it on top of the coconut crust during the last 6 minutes of baking. It really brought out the coconut. It's a great and filling dish!

This recipe was alright. I did what the other commenter said and added the butter brown sugar on top. It was good, but im not a big fan of salmon to begin with.

VERY GOOD - Has exceptional flavor.  I used tilapia but sure any fish would taste equally tasty made this way.  I also added the brown sugar and butter as others suggested and that gave it that added touch.   A KEEPER recipe.  Thanks.

The coconut crust came out great and the salmon came out great, but I don't think that coconut and salmon go very well together. On the other hand, my husband LOVED it.

I didn't have bread crumbs or panko so I pulsed 1/4 c of Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds.  It was delicious, quick and easy!

I had no problems with this recipe. I liked it, and my husband loved it...in fact it gave him shivers, as he put it. 

NOTE: I followed one's suggestion and wrapped it in tinfoil to bake for 12 minutes, and broiled it for the remaining 3. and the crust came out great. The meat itself could have been a little flakier though...next time I may reduce the temp and cook longer. All in all, YUMMY!

This is just delicious and different!After reading the other reviews, I marinaded the salmon in lime juice and organic pina colada juice (I did it for 45 minutes, but next time, I would soak it longer in the pina colada juice and add the lime juice sometime after that because it did get dry and lime has a tendency to "cook" the fish).  I also added dark sesame oil and crushed red pepper to the marinade.

This is a great idea but lacks in flavor.  1st time I used the recipe verbatim...was pretty bland but had promise.

Second time,  I marinated 1/2 hour in lime juice AND a sprinkling of five-spice powder on both sides.   I also used the previous cooks' suggestions of adding the brown sugar and butter streusel.  It turned out wonderfully the second time.

For people who don't normally eat salmon we enjoyed this meal.  I marinated the salmon in lime for a bit longer.  Also, next time I would make sure the filet is thinner, because I found that the fish was a little overpowering if the salmon was too thick.

This was super easy and delicious. Think that I might use a bit more lime juice before dredging with panko/coconut.
Served withwedges of lime, asparagus and Basmati rice with sauted mushrooms. Yum!

This is a really good recipe although I made some adjustments from the 1st time I made it and did it ever improve it.  I decided after the 1st time that the coconut needed a little toasting before adding to the fish.  I also made a honey paste with lime zest, salt and pepper.  I put that on the fish and then pressed the toasted coconut into the paste.  Cover it or your coconut will burn.  Also, I'm not sure if my filets are just that much thicker but, it takes mine a good 45 min. to get done.  Highly recommend!!

Totally fantastic when made using other reviewer's suggestions of a butter/brown sugar glaze.  In Mark's words,"Kim, I think this is my new favourite way to have salmon!"  A hit.

I really wanted to like this one. I had great hopes. My husband liked it, my daughter thought it was okay, but I did not care for it. I think this is one that you have to try because you might like it. I just didn't like it.....I am giving it 3 stars to average out the ratings in my household (2 to 4 stars).

I have made this dish twice now. The first time I followed the directions exactly and it was good. The second time I made some adjustments and it was FANTASTIC! Here's what I did: I let the fillets marinate in the salmon for about 1 hour and 45 minutes while they were thawing out. Then, after dredging them with the coconut breading on both sides I put the remaining breading on the top and followed the rest of the directions exactly. I think next time I won't put so much salt in the coconut mix because the lime it didn't go well with the lime on the fillet. Otherwise...PERFECT!

This is really delicious. There's no words that can describe this dish.  All I can say is "Mmmmmm." Changed the ingredients by using few of the reviewers suggestions. I sprinkled a little bit of flour on top. I substituted lime with 2 tbsp. butter, used seasoned crumbs instead and mixed the butter and brown sugar together. I poured it on top of the fish before putting it in the oven. It turned out great! Definitely will make it again. I'll rate this recipe a BIG 10!

This was just excellent.  And very easy - although I simplified the recipe even further.  I soaked the fish as per directions, salted it, and sprinkled a little flour over the fish (so the margarine would stick); then spread margarine (could easily be butter) over the fish and then simply sprinkled the panko/coconut mixture over that.  I also drizzled a mix of melted butter and brown sugar over that.  I baked it in a heavy pan in the BBQ, no cover or tin foil over the dish.  It baked perfectly.  I will indeed make this again. Not a single crumb left on any of the 8 plates at dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.  I served it with red parley potatoes and Rainbow Pasta Salad from this site.

Delicious recipe! A few changes I made: First, I didn't have any lemon juice so instead I melted two tablespoons of butter. Then instead of dredging the fillets in the mixture I mixed 1-2 tablespoons (depending on the size of the fillet) of coconut flakes and 1/2-1 (again depending on the size) tablespoon of seasoned breadcrumbs and put them into a small bowl. I then seasoned with sea salt and pepper to taste, mixed it by hand and after I brushed one fillet with the melted butter I put the coconut/breadcrumb mixture on top of it. I repeated the process until all the fillets had topping and then put them in the oven on the suggested setting (I chose to have them in the whole fifteen minutes) and they turned out beautifully! One thing I will do differently next time is to put aluminum foil on the bottom of the pan. I forgot all about it and the juices from the fish and butter burnt to the bottom of the pan and made it hard to clean. so just use aluminum foil and it'll work:) I will definitely make this recipe again!

Really easy, quick, light and wonderful.  The only thing it could use is a sauce, and maybe a soy-based sauce would be good.  I made it with a little thicker salmon, and it took about 17min, but was fantastic.  Breading is delicious!  This recipe will definitely go into the rotation.

I took the other user's advise and covered the salmon in foil, uncovering for the last 5-7 minutes to brown the coconut. Additionally, I drizzled some brown sugar & butter over the top at the same time that I took the foil off. With these modifications, husband said it was great!

Wonderful, easy recipe. I even used frozen salmon and it was good. Definitely take others' advice and do the butter/brown sugar and broil it at the end.

This was a great recipe but I would have preferred this crust on chicken. Also the salmon did not cook in 15 minutes I had to cook it at 425* for almost 25 minutes, which made the crust burn. Don’t get me wrong the taste was excellent but the cooking temp and time is off. Also I mixed up coconut milk, olive oil, ginger, and lime and marinated the salmon in it for about one hour before putting the crust on.

This was good. I changed the recipe a lot though- I marinated the salmon with lemon zest for a few hrs, sprinkled salt and pepper onto the filets after marinating, then melted 1 tbsp margarine and 1 tbsp honey together and brushed these onto the filets, and sprinkled on the coconut. (I omitted the bread crumbs, since it might give a grainy texture) Baked for 10mins, drizzled on more margarine + honey mixture, broiled for 4mins. Next time, I'll bake for less time and broil longer. The family loved how flavorful it was with these changes.

This recipe was delicious. I do recommend allowing the salmon to marinate in the lime juice for at least 10-15 minutes before dredging it in the crumb and coconut mixture. I increased the lime juice to two tablespoons (the juice of one lime.) In addition I covered the salmon for the first 6 minutes of baking. I then melted one tablespoon of butter and stirred in one tablespoon of brown sugar, drizzled this over the top of the salmon and then added an additional teaspoon or so of coconut to the top of the salmon before returning it to bake for another 6 minutes. It was delicious. Even my 14 month old asked for more.

I've had coconut crusted fish in restaurants but only had chicken on hand so I tried it. EXCELLENT recipe for chicken!!!! The only thing that would have made it a little better is some kind of fruit salsa. This will become a new favorite. PS: I used bread crumbs.

This was certainly easy to make. I dont give it a 5 because the side dish I chose with it threw off the taste of the sweet fish. I would serve this with either plain pasta next time or carrots.

Really tasty!  I agree that marinating in lime juice adds flavor, and next time I’ll pulse the coconut in the food processor to create a finer crust but that’s just preference.  I’ve made this for my family (8 & 13 year olds) and we all love it!

I added the juice of half a lemon (for 2 servings) to the bread crumbs and coconut mixture.  Makes it stick together nicely then patted it a top the salmon.  Overall not very flavorful...maybe more salt and pepper?  But it was super simple and quick and my husband liked it.  Served it with corn chowder and a cucumber salad.

Excellent recipe! After reading some of the other reviews...I did cover it for the 8 minutes....then dried a little melted butter over it when I uncovered it for the last 10 min.    We love salmon and this was a delicious change !!!

I was very pleased with this dish, but made a few alterations, and it turned out delicious! First, I marinated my salmon in lime juice for about an hour. I also lined my baking pan with foil in order to eliminate any juice residue in my pan after the baking. I dipped the fish in egg whites before the panko and coconut mixture, which made the mixture stick easier to the fish. I covered the salmon with foil for the first 10 minutes of baking, then drizzled 2 tbs butter mixed with 1 tbs brown sugar on the top, and let it finish cooking, uncovered in the oven. I bought a pineapple/coconut curry sauce and simmered that while the fish was cooking, and served it on top of a side of basmati rice, and my husband also put some of the curry on top of the salmon, which made it even more delicious. Bon appetit!

A quick simple recipe that all my guests enjoyed. My husband even texted my Mom to let her know how good it was, which I don't think has ever happened before. Serving it with a mild sweet chilli sauce seemed to really up the appeal, as it would be a little dry without a topping of some sort. A fruit salsa would also work well.

It came out wonderful with a few tweeks of course.  I used lemon pepper and seasoning salt on fish directly then used fresh lime juice mixed with coconut milk marinated for 30 min. Did the brown suger and butter but added a lil coconut milk yumny

Awesome! Stumbled across this recipe right before making it so I did not have time to marinade but wanted to make it anyway. Instead of marinating I just massaged the mixture into the skin and also just stuck it in a casserole disk with foil over top, so I could spoon the mixture back on throughout cooking and it was wonderful! I can't imagine how much better it could be if I had time to marinade!

this was so good!  i did add the brown sugar/butter sauce to the top as suggested by other reviewers and the result was fantastic.  my husband who at first was not enthusiastic about trying this recipe (he said maybe if i left out the cocount, which i refused!) decided that this is now his favorite meal and he "wants this every week"!!!  thanks for a great recipe!

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  It was too plain and needs some sort of sauce.  There are better ways to prepare salmon.  I did like the texture of the crust, though.

My husband really liked this recipe. I changed a few things, I dipped the salmon filets in pineapple juice then into bread crumbs, after all the filets had been covered  in the bread crumbs and placed in a baking dish I poured remaining juice over the filets and sprinkled coconut on top. I baked for about 30 minutes I then removed the foil and cooked under the broiler a few minutes to crisp up. I really really enjoyed the crust part and wished for a sweeter fish, maybe I will let set in the juice longer. As my husband said "IT'S A KEEPER" and he asked when I was going to make it again!

Like I always share ..I'm a novice cook and this was soo easy and tasty. I added the drizzle shared by other reviewers. THe only down side was my Mom (whom I was cooking for) never told me she didn't like sweet fish recipes... (sigh) all other reviews were thumbs up!

Deeeelicious! I used frozen salmon and it was wonderful! We both loved it! The salmon was so rich and full of flavor and the coconut crust was the perfect compliment, not too strong, just a little crunchy and sweet!

Good, but needed a few alterations. Marinated in lime juice, salt, pepper, and a citrus basil seasoning for about an hour. Baked covered for about 8 minutes. Then drizzled butter/brown sugar mixture over fish and broiled for 5 minutes. Turned out pretty good!

The salmon tasted good, but I wasn't thrilled with the texture. It was too much bread crumb and not enough coconut and it didn't stick very well to the fish. I'll lay off the bread crumbs next time.

This was an easy recipe and tasted good but needed something extra...maybe some more seasoning...not quite sure.

Wasn't super impressed with this Salmon recipe. Thought it was a little dry & needed something to put on top.

I thought it was delicious. My husband is not a big fan of coconut. I did find it a little dry and had to serve it with a garlic mayo sauce that I whipped up.

Simple and delicious.  Docked it a star only because I followed another reviewer's advice on baking time instead of the recipes and it came out much better the second time I tried it!

This was soooo delish....I took some of the other reviewers recommendations....Soak the Salmon in Lemon Juice for at least 20 mins or more....I also used a little bit or butter and brown sugar and poured it over the salmon right before i put it in the oven...It was great...will def. use again...

fantastic! we tweaked the recipe a little by marinating the fish in lemon juice for 10 min then used crushed 'Captain Crunch' cereal with the bread-crumbs, and then added the brown-sugar & butter (with maple syrup) drizzle when toasting the coconut crust!
we had a nice salad with poppy-seed dressing and parisienne potatoes with parsley & butter and pan seared zuchinni with herbs.
(thinking an herb/dill would have been nice with the potatoes... but we're really interested to know what other sides go well with this delicious fish dish!)

I also added a butter/brown sugar crust in the last 6 minutes of cooking. I actually used spray butter instead of real butter, which worked (surprisingly) very well, tasted amazing, and cut calories.

I made this salmon for supper last night and I followed the recipe exactly...but I did make the glaze of brown sugar/butter as others suggested.  The end result was pretty good, although the vast majority of the flavour did come from the glaze.  If I hadn't used this, I think the dish would have been pretty bland.

This recipe was good, but could have been a little better. It needed a little more flavor, and could have been more spicey, but overall, it was good.

super good salmon!  My family's tastebuds were so happy with this great recipe!  Instead of lemon juice from a bottle, i used about half a real lemon on one side of my 3 filets, and then half a lime on the other side.  It really did make a difference and added a lot of flavor!

I cooked the salmon as directed, but added brown sugar and butter on top like some people suggested. It was good, but still very salmon-y because the coconut and panko mix didn't stay on the fish very well. Next time I might try using some more lemon juice and marinating the fish longer, and adding more coconut, brown sugar and butter.

Salmon is, by far, our favorite fish to  eat .eat it. The sweet of the coconut gives it a nice flavor. Make sure to continually check the fish and not over cook or the fish will get rubbery

my first time cooking salmon was a hit!  even my roommate ate this up-and she is not a fan of fish.  i was a little unsure of the doneness of the fish, but even when i put it in for another 10 minutes, it was still juicy.

I just didn't like this very much.  It had almost no flavor and the topping did absolutely nothing for the salmon.  I agree with "lisaonthepiano".  There are much better recipes out there.
