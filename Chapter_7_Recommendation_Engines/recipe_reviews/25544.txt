These have been sitting in the fridge so long, I forgot I made them! I'd been buying expensive pickled garlic cloves at Meijer for a good while when I saw this recipe, so I thought I'd give it a go. I love them! I used mustard seeds instead of dry mustard, because a)that's what I had on hand and b)that's what the Meijer garlics have too. I like slicing them up in salads. Thanks so much, Brenda!

Very tasty with no garlic breath. A variation could substitute the pepper with a red chili pepper. Asd fresh dill,and red pepper instead of mustard.

These little gems are absolutely fabulous!  I left out the mustard and celery seeds.  I let mine sit for about 2 weeks and they only get better with time.  I sent a batch to my grandmother for Christmas and she loved them.  They are very addictive.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe!  We added lots of peppers and used apple cider vinegar instead of regular vinegar.  It gave it a sweeter taste.

If you blanch the garlic for 3-4 minutes you don't have to wait a month for them to pickle.

My family adored this. It's so good over a curry flavored soup like Mulligatawny, which is what I had it over, as the flavors contrast very nicely. I made half the recipe( wish I hadn't) but it was perfectly pickled after 2 weeks. Also no celery seed, just used mustard seed, but no spice bag either...I just dumped it in the mix and kept it there...that's how my mom has always pickled. Also, next time I'll make the full recipe, but use the halved sugar amount...think it will be better a little less sweet.

Good recipe! But I think the garlic was too soft.  I would simmer brine for 5 min and then add garlic and cook for 2 min max. For a crisp garlic clove.

Fantastic way to eat garlic. I add soy sauce to taste and reduce salt.

I modified this recipe. I added 1/3 cuo sliced jalapeno, 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/4 teaspoon fresh sage and 1/4 teaspoon fresh oregano. I also processed sealed jars in boiling water bath for 10 minutes so that refrigeration isn't necessary and the finished product will last much longer. Great flavor and will definitely do these another time. By the way purchasing peeled garlic cloves makes the job much easier.

My friend Toni, had my husband and I sample some pickled garlic...that was just fabulous! I came in search for a recipe. And tried this 1st. Decent recipe, however I double it and I felt I had more red bell pepper then needed after the fact. I made it to a T, so when it said large...that's what I had. But the bell pepper had a wonderful tanginess flavor to it and the garlic is nice it's not as tangy as the bell peppers. I'd see making this again. And if I double it, I'm going to not double the bell pepper in the recipe. But it does have that nice zing affect in the peppers and sauce. It's not like the recipe she had, but this is fairly nice.

This is a very interesting way to eat garlic. All the benefits of eating garlic without the harsh bitterness of a un-pickled clove!
I used 1.5lbs of garlic and doubled everything else. It made 3 (1/2 pint jars) with leftover liquid.

My 3 weeks are finally up.   I really liked this and will make nice munchy food for me.   I do not own a spice bag so just dumped them in and that seemed to work ok.   I also added in some jalepenos.   I liked them in there, but would probably put in more next time.  I did the full 5 minuted boil and I think the texture was about right.  The color was a little green, but that was ok by me.   I expected it to be more tart.   I would probably use cider vinegar next time.

Great recipe! Like practically everyone else, I changed the ingredients and put my own spin on it, so it's not really the recipe listed, but still, it turned out great and this recipe was a good outline to give me something to tinker with!

This was super simple. Tasty too!
I did a regular batch, but then I did a spicy batch (Dave's Insanity Sauce). SO good!
