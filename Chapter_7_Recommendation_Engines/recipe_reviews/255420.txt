Does dining in get any more easy without losing flavor? This was absolutely a company worthy entree. Aside from using chicken breasts I didn't change any ingredients. Make sure you use a quality wine, I used a Chardonnay. Delicious!

I love sun-dried tomatoes, so, I thought I would give this a try.  The sauce is wonderful!  You taste a hint of the wine in the background and the sun-dried tomatoes give it a rich flavor.   I used chicken breast cut into strips and it was tender and full of flavor.  I think I over salted my chicken, so, the sauce was a little salty for our taste, so, next time I would cut back on the salt.   It was a wonderful dish and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious and company worthy. I did use real mashed potatoes though...I do not like the box kind. Also, I used fresh boneless chicken breasts and thighs. I used a Riesling wine and did not add the sugar. Next time I would add fresh sliced mushrooms to the onion and sun dried tomato mixture. I will definitely make this again!

A very easy weeknight dinner that is full of flavor. I did thin the sauce slightly with some chicken broth since it was a little to thick for us.  Other then that we loved it as is and are looking forward to having this dish again in the near future.

I really liked this recipe. I used 2 large chicken breasts that I cut into strips. Great flavor, and so good over the mashed potatoes. In reading the other reviews, I just realized I forgot to add the flour. It still tasted great without it, and wasn't too liquidy.  I did cook it down a couple more minutes than stated, and a little flour probably would have helped with the consistency. I just shook on a few red pepper flakes. I will definitely make this again.

I loved the flavors in this dish. The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of the wine. I would cut back on the salt a little next time for my own personal preference but otherwise this is a delicious easy dinner for any occasion.  The Idahoan Signature Russets Mashed Potatoes were a great addition to the meal.

I will definitely make this again. My husband and I loved it, but my kids didn't like it because of the wine taste. Next time I will use more chicken stock and less wine. I also put this over pasta because I didn't have any potato's. I'm sure it's good with the potato's, but I'm a pasta girl.

This was very delicious and full of flavor. My boyfriend was very pleased with this dish. I used chicken broth instead of wine, I also used chicken breast filleted and made homemade mash potatoes. I think next time I'll put it over spaghetti noodles instead of mash potatoes. I feel it would taste better over noodles.

I have made this at least five times. I love it! Last time I made it I didn't have a yellow onion so I used a red one. It was great. I now have a package of frozen ""Tenders" in my freezer so I can crank this out often!

this definitely made it to the "do it again" list! I used Chicken Tenders, and for the sauce I didn't have any milk (!) so I used some coconut milk, omitted the sugar and used wine and some additional chicken broth for the sauce, it was questionable in my mind but turned out delicious! Can't wait to try it again made as the recipes state... per other comments I used a bit less sugar and additional sun-dried tomatoes because I love them. This is a must try!

Excellent Dish!!  Had my 2 adult daughters over for dinner tonight and made this for the first time ~ Everyone Loved IT!  Made as written using thin cut chicken breasts and a dash of salt instead of the full teaspoon.  Was fast and easy enough for a week night dinner, but tasted like a nice restaurant meal.  I eat a lot of chicken in my diet and have a difficult time coming up with variations that are savory.  I Will Definitely make again and again and again!  Thanks so much for sharing this lovely dish!!

Sans the mashed potatoes, made per directions--and WOW!!--Italian restaurant taste with the second bite; paired beautifully with angel hair pasta!!  Seriously pains my outspoken wife to compliment my fine cooking--so imagine my shock when she went on how wonderful this dish was made!! I see some add on possibilities, but for now--savoring Italian restaurant tasting victory with this beautifully crafted dish.

Excellent flavor.  My family loved it and the only change was using 2 chicken breasts cut into strips.  Made it twice and will definitely make this wonderful recipe again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is edible.  It's not really good though.  All in all, it would have been easier and just as tasty to just eat the tenders and mashed potatoes with a white gravy.

I used leftover mashed potatoes and next time will use leftover chicken or turkey meat. The frozen chicken fingers have absolutely no taste.  It is an easy recipe to make though and goes together rapidly so have everything prepped first.  It was tasty enough for me to cook again.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner and what a hit. This goes into the pile of favorites for company or just any time you want a simple tasty meal. I did use boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of tenders but the rest I prepared as written. What a great rich flavor combination. Thanks for this wonderful dinner. Will be making again soon.

SO GOOD This is a must make again. I made my
mashed potatoes in slow cooker. I used chicken breasts.
I only had dried  sundried tomatoes so soaked in boiling water and let sit in olive oil for  a while.  Served with Mushy peas 
from this site, minus the vinegar. Iloveit

I made this according to directions, and though it was ok, not anything really special.  It lacked something, but not sure what.
For more stars I need some "WOW" factor that this was lacking.

This is definitely a restaurant quality dinner.
The creamy chicken is absolutely delicious and the sun dried tomato wine sauce made it all come together and sing! The potatoes were perfect; buttery and creamy. Exactly what you want in a dish such as this one.
Thank you, Korikiss for the recipe that will be made often in our house!

Yum, yum, yum!! This was so good! I didn't make a ton of changes either. I did use fresh chicken tenders and I mixed all of the seasonings with the chicken before browning. I cooked the chicken about 5-6 minutes flipping it once half way through. I used some leftover shallots instead of onion because I wanted to use it up and I added a little half and half with the milk because I again had some to use up. I also garnished it with a little chopped parsley for color. I also used the Idahoan Roasted Garlic instant potatoes instead of just plain. This was soooo good! I would even make this for company. I can't believe how fast and easy the potatoes were to make and they tasted great. Definitely look forward to trying out some more of Idahoan's recipes!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used fresh instead of frozen chicken tenders and it turned out great.  The Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes were a perfect side.  In the future I would leave out the  red pepper flakes.  Otherwise it was a great recipe and will be making it again in the future.

You had me at just the title of this recipe! It was so simple to make and tasted wonderful with the mashed potatoes. Super easy weeknight meal! The sauce was a little too thick, in my opinion, so I would cut down on the flour and/or add more liquid.  Overall a great dish!

This was easy to put together and tasted divine! This meal can dress up with a nice salad or green side just as easily as it can be a quick dinner for one (with tasty leftovers for lunch throughout the week).
