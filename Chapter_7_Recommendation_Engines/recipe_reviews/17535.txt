This is the recipe that needs eggs.  Even though they tasted great they came out looking like hockey pucks!  There is nothing in this recipe that makes the muffins cakey or rise.

This comment is for PAM62; of course this recipe does not have eggs in it, it is a VEGAN recipe. That means the strictes type of vegetarians that do not eat: meat, eggs or dairy.

I really like these muffins! Mine came out moist, flavorful and not at all like hockey pucks. I'll enjoy playing around with the recipe and trying variations.

This is probably the worst recipe I have ever made. I thought it was odd that there weren't any eggs in it, and the end result proved it needed them. How can I give this a "0 star" rating?

Great Flavor especially with big chunks of chopped apple! Thought batter had too much liquid so added 1/2 cup of all purpose flour and used 1 1/4 c wheat flour instead of the all purpose in the recipe. For the cereal I used raisin bran.  Also used paper baking cups and they did stick to them a little too much but my margarine was soft not melted so will keep trying. They don't rise much at all so fill those cups!

These muffins were pretty good for low fat - but they didn't have much taste.  You may need to spread some jelly or butter on them.

I had to change a few things.  I did add one egg and I have alot of apple butter so I used that mixed w/ water in place of the apple juice.  I left the skins on the macintosh apple and grated it instead of the directed way. It was good.  THX

These were very delicious for healthy muffins!  They had a great texture.  I made several changes: used all whole wheat flour (soft white), reduced sugar by a few Ts, increased cinnamon to 1 T (and will add even more next time), used cider instead of juice, though it didn't seem to alter the flavor much, used butter, added 1/3 c flax meal, 1/3 c. yogurt, 3/4 c. quick oats, and 1/3 c. walnuts.  We loved them!

After the first batch of muffins which were just okay, I added 1 egg, peeled and diced 2 apples, and added 1/2 cup white sugar. The family loved them!!!

I'm giving this 4 stars because, although it didn't turn out, I did make several changes that were probably responsible for it not turning out.  For those who are thinking of using a more concentrated apple juice instead of the brown sugar, substituting applesauce for the margarine, adding 2 eggs to make it rise, adding 1/2c extra of bran flakes to make up for the liquid in the eggs, and baking it in a loaf pan at 350 for 60 minutes... DON'T DO IT!!  It doesn't bake all the way (the outside burns before the center gets done).  Even with all my changes the flavor was still very mild (and I added 1/2t nutmeg and 1/2t allspice) -- it could be the lack of sugar with my changes.  But if you are looking for more of an apple spice muffin or bread, this is not your recipe.  Next time I know better... follow the recipe exactly as it says!! * SIGH*

Perfect! Maybe a little more sugar to taste. Use lots of apple chunks! Delicious!
made 'em again and they are just not dry and fluffy enough for our tastes.

These were pretty good just b/c they were made with ALL BRAN BUDS (which have a blan cardboard taste to them) BUT...are good for me and HIGH in fiber (the reason I made them to begin with.)

These are pretty good.  I made 18 mini muffines.  I didn't have cinnamon so I used all spice, turned out good. I sprinkled powder sugar on top for my four year old and she like them.

Excellent muffin! Great with mid-morning tea. I added 1/2 cup extra flour to stiffen the batter a bit, but the flavour is delicious.

Pretty good, I added a 1/4 flax meal. Never made began muffins before so I was apprehensive about how wet the batter was. They did cook all the way and were delightful.

An ok breakfast muffin. Delicious flavour (I substituted the apple ingredients with a pear and pear juice) but the muffins didn't rise very well and were too doughy for my taste. I might add an egg next time.

These muffins are fantastic -- they're perfect for an energizing but light breakfast.  I find that the muffins really stick to the pan, so I started using paper muffin cups.

I tried this recipe out on my parents last night (since we are trying to eat healthier) and it went down so well! The muffins have so much flavour, but I used stoneground wholewheat flour instead of all purpouse flour and nutmeg instead of cinnamon.  Well done! 5 stars from me!

These are slight on the tough/spongy side, but that comes with the lack of eggs.  My little guy is allergic to eggs, so I bake without eggs a lot, and considering they're eggless, these are not bad at all.  In fact, my olders son said these are his favorite muffins.

Followed recipe exactly - YUM! Docked 1 star because muffins were fantastic the day I made them and the day after, but something strange happened after that. Tasted different, and texture changed. These are GREAT fresh, but don't make a large batch and plan on having them around for a week or so - they'll be yucky by day 3!

Quite liked this recipe. It's not too sweet and it definitely does not last long once baked, especially when they are warm from the oven. I sometimes substitute pineapple juice for the apple juice, and I usually grater the peeled apple instead of cored, but both work fine for me.

I am not sure what the 18 people that rated these good think is a muffin but it isn't what MOST people would consider a muffin. These are terrible. The flavor isnt that bad but they are just little bricks. They are rubbery and just just awful. There is really nothing more to say.

I didn't have apple juice to hand but I did have applesauce. I used a cup of that instead of the 1 1/4 cups of juice, and increased the bran flakes by about 1/4 cup to absorb the extra moisture. Alas, while these smelled delicious and actually have a nice, not too sweet flavor, they came out underdone inside with an almost TOO chewy outside. (I baked them per the recommended time.)

All this said, I chalk this up to my inexperience as a baker rather than the recipe itself. Next time I will follow recipe exactly and see how they come out.

I loved the base recipe and was excited that it was so simple. We amped up the fiber and substituted 1/2 the flour for pulverized Fiber One Cereal. Also substituted the 1/4 c oil for the same amount of mashed banana. All we could find was raisin bran and just left the raisins  in. Over all they taste awesome. Thanks for sharing. I did try to use paper cups and they stick ... Will definitely do the buttered tins next time.

I thought this was great for a bran muffin. I used all bran, and didn't change anything else. These are not too sweet, if you like them sweet, you can always eat them with jam. They were very moist and even one day later still are moist and delicious. I will be making them again and possibly experimenting with some other ingredients.

I used milk because I didn't have juice and oil instead of margarine. They turned out great. A more solid muffin but not hard or to dense. Enloyed and will probabley use this recipe again ty.
