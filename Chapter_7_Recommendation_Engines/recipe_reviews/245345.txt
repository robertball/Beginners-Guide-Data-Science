This is amazingly good.  Really the only difference from the recipe was that I bought the pomegranate seeds already done in the plastic container (so much easier, but a little pricey).  Other than that, everything else was the same.  You can use this salsa for so many different things.  It's definitely a keeper!

LOVE this recipe, especially when pomegranate seeds are available at my local food club.  Though delicious as  presented, I add chopped mango in addition to the mandarin oranges.  Toying with the idea of serving at Thanksgiving, and adding, in addition the mango, ruby red grapefruit.  Such a  versatile, fresh and vivacious reincarnation of an apropos salute to the season!

Guests loved this, a nice change from traditional salsa. Very easy to put together, and I love the potential versatility of it. Made it as reco'd but will try it with other fruit like Mango vs. Mandarins next time.

Was a big hit. A nice alternative to the regular tomato-based salsas.

Really fresh tasting and good. I wasn't sure about the mandarin oranges, but they were a good addition.
