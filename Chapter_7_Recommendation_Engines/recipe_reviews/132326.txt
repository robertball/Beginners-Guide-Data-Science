Wow, this was great, but I did make the following changes.  I made a pound of penne, I used only sweet italian sausage (though I think it would be great with the combo too).  I used an entire onion.  The sun-dried tomatoes that I used said packed with olive oil and HERBS as well as my diced canned tomatoes so I did not need to add any additional italian herbs.  I drained most of the liquid out of the tomatoes (recipes doesn't indicate either way) and I skipped the cherry tomatoes.  Because I skipped the cherry tomatoes I cut back a bit on the cream so the sauce wouldn't be too thin.  I think next time I will simmer the sauce a little longer before adding the cream because my husband felt the sun-dried tomatoes were still a little firm.  I will definitely make this one again.

I love this recipe! I made it again tonight and my guests gave it a 10/10. I used mild Italian sausage and added cajun seasoning. Delicious!

This was absolutely delicious - my husband loved it too.  Next time I'll use 2/3 or half as much sausage.  I also mixed in the cherry tomatoes while the pan was still simmering so they could soften.

This is a nice change from a regular spaghetti sauce. I did make one change. I skipped the meat and then added a chopped green pepper along with the onion and garlic. Turned out wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it!  I doubled the onion, garlic, diced tomatoes and cream (used 1/2 and 1/2 and added some cornstarch) and made a pound of pasta.  My daughter ate it for four meals!

This was really good.  I ended up using a 1lb. of Italian Ground Turkey which I had on hand.  Half & Half instead of cream.  No additional italian seasonings.  With these changes it still came out very good & I would imagine if the recipe was followed as written, it would even be better!  So easy to put together too for a quick meal.

This was excellent - as a healthier option I used Turkey Sausage and Sour Cream to replace the cream.  Once the sauce was finished we added the penne pasta directly to the sauce and served.  Everyone loved it!!

Needed a way to use our overabundance of cherry tomatoes and I was also looking for a go to pasta sauce recipe. This recipe was perfect, much better than the one I used last year! Anyway, I made it as is the first time around to please my meat-eating husband, but the 2nd time I made a vegan version. I have to say both ways were great. To the vegan version, I added celery and carrots to saute along with the onions and garlic. Thank you Wallace Clan for posting this versital recipe!

My test is usually "if this had been served to me in a restaurant would I be impressed?".  Absolutely, without a doubt, yes!  We found it made eight servings.

This was an excellent recipe!! We have made it a few times and the kids love it too. I made a couple minor changes the 2nd time. I used a whole onion, sliced the sausages after it was cooked and I could not find cherry tomatoes so I used plum and sliced them. This will be a regular in my home.

This recipe is phenomenal. The heavy whipping cream really makes it! I used four large, fresh tomatoes in place of the canned tomatoes and, since we didn't have Italian sausage, I just used seasoned ground beef. I served it over zoodles (zuchinni noodles). You will want a great crusty Italian bread to sop up the decadent sauce with! Definately a keeper!
