absolutely fabulous. Very easy, very tasty and not too sweet. I used Nescafe light roast instant coffee. It is milder in taste, for those who like mild coffee. Came out perfect! I used it to frost the whipped cream II cake from this site, and it came out perfect. Had some leftover, so I gave them to my mom who loves to make mochaccinos, which would be perfect topped with this cream~
thanks for sharing!

This is a more grown up taste.  I had to add more sugar to mine because the coffee flavor was a little too strong for my liking.  Good for coffee lovers!!

Very rich and so delicious!  Spreads well and looks great on cakes or cupcakes.  Can be used on white, yellow or chocolate flavoured cakes.  I've used this frosting many times and it continues to be one of my favourites.

Great starter recipe for icing...I added some cocoa powder and a little more sugar, iced a cake, then added some chocolate covered espresso beans on the top of the cake!  Very grown up way to serve cake! I also had a little left over, so I am thinking of ways to use it up in other desserts...it's very versatile!

Brilliant recipe. I wanted to use up my whipping cream, and decided to make this to frost my whipped cream cake II. The frosting was fluffy and light, and the coffee taste was just right in offsetting the cake's sweetness. I would use this frosting on non chocolatey/ mocha flavored cakes. Thank you for posting.

This whipped cream was awesome!  I am a coffee fanatic so this was perfect!  I used it as a cake filling and frosting, then also used it to pipe words and designs on top of the cake.  I had left overs and used it for on top of my coffee (I love coffee) and also hot chocolate.  This was sooo easy and quick.  I will be using this recipe a lot.  Thanks so much for the yummy posting!

Added just a touch more sugar to this, and it was perfect for frosting my chocolate cake.  Very pronounced coffee flavor. Thanks!

The mocha flavor is just perfect!  I used the mocha cream to ice my chocolate cupcake and brought them to a potluck, and everyone loved it!  I am gonna use it to fill my cream puffs today.

Loved it on the Black Magic Cake, but coffee is my favorite flavor and this was strong. If you love coffee, you'll use this recipe often.

This is an excellent recipe and could easily fill a 9 inch 2 layer cake.  I needed to add more sugar to counteract the coffee flavor. Even still, it is an awesome mocha cream recipe.

I made this as a filling and icing for some GF chocolate cupcakes.  The only thing I changed was used strong brewed French vanilla coffee rather than making the instant coffee.  It did not have a strong coffee flavor but there was just enough to notice it was not just plain whipped cream. Next time I might try to add some espresso powder for a little stronger coffee flavor.

This was AMAZING!! I personally thought it wasn't sweet enough, so i added sugar to it, but of course my dad likes bitter coffee so he thought  it was good! Job well done! It is a good recipe because you can always alter it to your likings, thanks for posting this!!
