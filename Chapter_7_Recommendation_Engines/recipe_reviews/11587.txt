If light corn syrup is not available, you can substitute a sugar syrup made with 1-1/4 cups sugar and 1/3 cup water, boiled together until syrupy.

Absolutely fabulous sugar cookie icing!  This icing recipe is the "Holy Grail" of icing.  I have been searching for an icing recipe that allows me to bake cookies that look like they were purchased from a designer cookie shop. Thanks to this recipe, my search is over! I've made this icing several times and it has never let me down!  The icing sets up shiny and beautiful and the colors are so bright and glossy.  I use the paste food colorings--that you can purchase at any craft store.  The icing appears "wet", but it sets up nicely and you are able to stack the cookies.  However, the icing isn't too hard.  It's perfect.  I've used this icing to make decorated butterfly cookies that most people thought I purchased at a bakery.  I also made heart cookies for Valentine's day.  I packaged them in individual cellophane bags and tied with a ribbon--a cute, inexpensive treat for friends and my children's friends.  This icing's consistency is wonderful, too.  I spoon it on cookies and work it around the shape.  I use a paintbrush to add details, and the end of the paintbrush to add dots.  And yes, I do add additional milk--a 1/2 tsp at a time.  It's not a problem though.  I add small amounts of milk until I get the right constistency.  I can't say enough about this icing and how it has helped me to make gorgeous, professional-looking cookies for all occassions!

This worked great for me! I put the 1 cup of confectioner's sugar in the bowl, added 4 tsp of milk all at once and stirred it until evenly mixed. Then I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract (I know it only calls for 1/4 tsp, but you can never use too much vanilla extract) and stirred again until all mixed. Then I added a tablespoon of corn syrup and stirred until evenly mixed. At that point it was the perfect consistency for spreading and drizzling, and perfectly smooth. I tried using gel color to color it and that worked really well, but with another batch I just used regular food coloring and that worked just fine too.

It dried very quickly, within 20 minutes I was able to add a second drizzle coat (of another color) without it sinking into the first coat. It took about 90 minutes to dry hard. I had no problem, using a single batch of this icing recipe,  covering a 40-cookie batch of sugar cookies (average size 2" by 1.5") with a solid coat and a drizzle coat, and there was still some icing left over. 

Will be using this one again and again! :)

This icing is the best! I used lemon flavoring and it tasted great. The trick that worked for me in making this icing was add the 2 tsp. of milk to a bowl and then slowly stir in the powdered sugar a little at a time. It will come out smooth like the recipe says. You just have to be patient. Then add your corn syrup, flavoring and color.

You have to  play around with the milk and corn syrup pretty much, but it's best to start with what the recipe calls for and add to desired consistency.  This recipe was great.  The glaze does take time to dry - overnight is best.  But the colors don't fade and the icing dries shiny, but not too hard.  I made this icing using both almond and lemon extract with superb results for both.  The icing adds that big of extra flavor to boring old sugar cookie recipes but the flavor isn't overbearing.  Cookies come out stackable and easy to transport after drying.  

This was my first time ever making decorated cookies and the person who received my cookie gifts asked me if I'd purchased them at a bakery!  So I was very pleased with this recipe and will probably use it forever!

** 5 STARS! ** FABULOUS! I used this icing on my gingerbread men instead of Royal Icing because it requires egg whites.  I added vanilla extract instead of almond extract. Placed it in sandwich bags, snip the corner, & piped it on the gingerbread men.  NICE!!

It's easy and makes for a nice professional shiny and smooth finish. It's a very sweet icing but aren't they all?  I did have to add a bit more milk and corn syrup to make it into a spreadable consistancy.  Make sure you don't add too much of either ... otherwise it gets too runny. I used the almond extract as suggested but have also substituted it with clear vanilla and lemon extract. I think any extract will work. It takes a few of hours to harden and is stackable after that. I used a thin layer of this icing with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies Recipe.  This made a thick professional looking cookie.

Great basic recipe for  beautiful, colorful, glossy frosting.  I have to work at it each time to get the right consistency.  Tip: add a little more milk to make it thinner and easier to brush onto the cookies (if you are getting artistic, like I do).  Adding more syrup will not allow it to dry and it will stay gooey until you eat them!    I use frosting food colors from the cake decorating section of my craft store, they work great.

I adjusted the recipe with the amount of milk and corn syrup to get it to the consistency I liked (about 3 tsp of milk and 3 tsp of corn syrup).  The icing tasted and looked good and was pretty easy to work with.  I used this on the Soft Christmas Cookies by Georgie Bowers.  I will use this again.

Great for traditional iced cookies.  Icing takes a good 6-8 hours to completely dry.

I agree that this is the "holy grail" of sugar cookie icing recipes, same for petite fours.  This is the same icing I've seen others refer to as "paint brush cookie" icing.  I too had to add some milk and corn syrup.  Keep in mind bakers, the more corn syrup you use, the longer it will take to dry.  In exchange, you will have a nice shiny cookie icing.  If the shine doesn't matter, just increase the milk little by little and don't increase the corn syrup.  Also, I'm not a fan of an overpowing almond flavor (so little goes very far) so I use my old standby of 1 tsp butter flavoring and 1 tsp vanilla flavoring for every 1/4 tsp of almond flavoring.  This is sheer perfection to my family's palates.  The ratio of those three flavors is same flavor as buttercream wedding cake icing.  Also, I felt the recipe as it is (serving for 12) did not make enough to provide nice coverage of 12 cookies so for 1 dozen cookies, I increased the servings in this recipes(to change the ingredient amounts) to 24 and was stretching the icing at that.  I dipped mine and laid on the rack to dry.  Also, make sure they are thoroughly dry before stacking.  Mine took about 16 hours; that was with the additional corn syrup to make it the perfect consistency.  With the necessary changes as stated by other other bakers (adding milk/corn syrup), you are going to love this recipe.  The bakeries back in the 60s and 70s used this recipe on their sugar cookies making them much sought after. Addictive!

EXCELLENT recipe! Unusual for me to tweak to such an extent BUT I make mine as per another reviewer with 1 c powdered sugar, 4 t milk, 1 t extract, 1 T corn syrup. I found out that if you substitute 4 t heavy cream instead of milk, you get the PERFECT consistency for bordering/lettering - it's stiff enough to hold it's shape but not difficult in any way to work with & will squeeze through a # 2 icing tip with the greatest of ease!   Use milk if you are making flood icing and keep adding milk by 1/2 teaspoonful increments until you achieve the consistency you want.  This is the ONLY recipe I use to decorate my cookies - it is AWESOME!!! (Check out my photos of the cookies I have decorated using this tweaked recipe!)

This is a nice icing recipe, I agree, but one thing is missing - a pinch or two of salt.  I don't suggest the icing should be SALTY - not a all - but salt is a flavor enhancer and the ingredient that keeps things (especially sweet things) from being bland.  If, for example, you've ever left the salt out of a batch of chocolate chip cookies, you'll know what I mean.  A fair number of folks who've reviewed this recipe have described it as overly sweet and/or bland, and this is because it lacks a a little salt.  Whether you use vanilla, almond or any other extract, it won't taste right without a little salt to balance the flavor and sweetness - trust me.  I added a scant 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt to the recipe - perfect.

This lovely sugar cookie icing works well even for people like me who are lazy and don't have the patience to frost and decorate elaborate cookies.  I just spread it with a pastry brush onto simple, round sugar cookies.  Maybe not the most impressive looking, but they sure did taste good!  I did have to play around with the measurements of the milk and the corn syrup,needing to add more of both to thin it out, but in the end it was a nice, glossy, easily spreadable glaze; just what I was after.

This, as one reviewer noted, is the holy grail of icing recipes... it should be, it's been around for a long time. Some reviews wrote that the icing didn't totally dry, and some said that it wasn't shinny enough. The secret is in the mixing of the syrup and milk. Use whole milk and light syrup in a 50/50 ratio. It takes a bit of practice. If you add too much milk you will lose some of the shine, and too much syrup will keep it from hardening. Once you get it right, you'll never use another icing... FYI: Using lemon extract in place of the almond, as suggested gives the icing a light taste that balances quite well against a typical sugar cookie.

Ok - so after 3 failed attempts at this icing... i finally figured out the "tricks".  here's what i discovered:
1. 2 tsp milk is NOT enough!  and you can't just dump the sugar in and then pour in the milk as in other icing recipes.
2. Increase the milk to 4 tsp.
3. put the milk in your bowl FIRST. and THEN add the powdered sugar
4. add the powdered sugar 1/4 cup at a time!!!  it has to be added VERY gradually to the milk.  whisking continuously to keep the smooth creamy texture.
5. you DEFINITELY need a "paint brush" to apply this icing.  it's very drippy and running.
6. as others have mentioned - if you get it right - the icing is GREAT.  very glossy and sets up quickly (if you put on a thin coat applied with a brush).

hope this helps others! :)

I've used this recipe so many times and the result is always fabulous! This icing sets up hard enough to stack cookies (I let them dry overnight first). The colors stay vibrant. For a professional look, I pipe icing around the edges, let dry a while, then flood the cookie with thinned icing to cover it. If you allow the icing to dry slightly between colors, it's simple to add details without the colors bleeding. This icing makes it possible to make cookies that look like they came from a bakery. It is necessary to add additional milk during step one to get it to a smooth consistency, but the outcome makes this a 5 star recipe!

This icing was so easy to make and made my cookies absolutely beautiful.  I had to add additional corn syrup, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Definitely use gel food coloring. *UPDATE* Now that I have used this several times, I have developed a system.  First add the milk (I use about 3 Tbsp.) Then slowly whisk in the powdered sugar.  Lastly, add the corn syrup & flavoring (I use vanilla extract), then food coloring.  I don't recommend using more corn syrup than required because the icing will not dry properly.  However, the more milk you use, the less glossy it will be.

I do love this icing but a word of WARNING! The first several times I made it, I made the adjustment that everyone seemed to be making - using 2 TABLEspoons of milk instead of teaspoons. If you do you will end up with decent icing but you will NOT end up with the gorgeous glossy colors you see in some of these photos. You will get a matte finish. The up side is that it dries much faster - about 4-5 hours. It also covers 30-35 3" cookies with no problem. When you make it with the 2 teaspoons you'll get glossy but it does take 8-9 hours to dry and it will only cover about 20-23 cookies. It doesn't look like it will - I stared at it thinking "You've got to be kidding me!" but I put mine on with a small craft paint brush using three colors and it did.

for those asking for suggestions...I put the icing into small plastic bottles (find them in the candy-making aisle at craft stores).  Tint the frostings and then funnel them into the squeeze bottles.  When you ice the cookies, outline the cookie and then squeeze a bit more icing into the center.  Use a metal spatula to "fill in".  Also, I've used the plastic paint brushes (the kind found in water color kits)...takes more time but offers more control.    Now that I've been painting cookies for years, I can get the same effect just using a metal spatula (and it's quicker).  Let cookies dry on rack before stacking on plate...

LOVE this icing! Absolutely use colored paste, especially for intense colors. Liquid food coloring will make the icing runny & you will need to add more sugar. I divided the icing while it was a bit firm and added a tiny bit more milk to one batch, which I used to paint the main color. A firm craft paint brush worked great. It dried perfectly smooth and shiny. I used the slightly firmer batch for piping the fine lines, etc.  Thin the icing with additional milk - not corn syrup, or your icing will not dry properly.  Substitute vanilla for a milder flavor. It is available in clear, if you need your icing to remain pure white. There are dozens more iced cookies in my future. Thanks for a tasty, easy to use recipe!

I read the past reviews and added more milk to thin the icing a little.  I thought it turned out great and after the icing dried, I could stack the cookies with no problems.  It works well with the "Best Rolled Sugar Cookie" on the site, too.

Definitely add the sugar to the milk not the milk to the sugar!!  It is very hard to mix if you add the milk to the sugar all at once. Great taste though. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I love this icing. It looks so pretty when it dries! The colors stay bright and shiny. Update: I use this recipe everytime I make sugar cookies, but I have found that if it is too thick, DO NOT add more corn syrup. Add more milk instead. If you add more corn syrup, it does not harden, it stays very sticky.

Used this icing to decorate Halloween cookies with my 4 and 8 year old great nieces and it is the best I've tried!  I used orange extract for pumpkins, almond for bats and vanilla for ghosts and all were tasty.  Put this icing with the Cut Out Cookies In a Flower Pot recipe on this web site and you have a perfect "bakery quality" cookie.  I'm anxious to make Christmas cookies with this recipe and decorate gingerbread boys!  Thank you for sharing!

So good w/ almond extract - and it leaves the icing pure white.  (Tried it w/ vanilla, and it gave it almost a cream-colored tint.)  Double the recipe for a full batch of Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site.  Perfect for Christmas baking!

For anyone who has issues with the icing consistency, the way I make this is to start with 1/2 cup of powdered sugar. Add the milk, stir together. Then add the corn syrup and almond extract. Whisk it together with a wire whisk. Then slowly add the other half a cup of powdered sugar, whisking all the while. I found it far easier to get the icing the consistency I wanted this way. :)

Wonderful icing to use for decorating cookies.  I used clear vanilla vs. almond extract - just what I was looking for!

This was great.  Much easier to use than royal icing.  Just add a little more icing sugar for stiffer piping, and a little more milk for a glazed look.

This icing is delicious!  It is just like a local bakery makes.  I used a sugar cookie recipe from this site as well and they turned out delicious.  I can't wait to make Christmas cookies.  With the recommendation of others I did use 1 tsp. more of milk and 1 tsp. more of light corn syrup.  I also used other extracts to change the taste slightly.  Although the extra liquid in the icing was great for covering the entire cookie.  I think next time I will try the original recipe for piping details on the cookies.

This is the first time I made my own icing for cookies. I had a cookie decorating party at my house for myself and 3 other ladies. I have to tell you I am impressed. The icing set up beautifully! I did not use almond flavoring I used some butter flavoring and some vanilla extract. We used paintbrushes to paint the icing on. The cookies dried very fast and by the end of the party we were able to stack the cookies into our containers so the girls could take theirs home. On a side note: I used tablespoons instead of teaspoons for the milk and corn syrup. Perfect!

DEFINITELY double the recipe for a whole batch of cookies. Also, I normally wouldn't 5-star a recipe we had to tweak but I think consistency depends so much on humidity, etc, in this recipe that you have to expect it. Overall - the base recipe was great. After doubling the milk and Karo - well, our cookies look great - so 5 stars!

Excellent!  I am not an expert cookie baker and I LOVED this recipe!  Everyone raved!  You do need to add more milk and karo to get the right consistency.  I had no problem with drying time -I think those that are having problems are adding too much karo syrup rather than milk.  BEAUTIFUL!!

I love this icing!  I use lemon flavor and it is absolutely the best.  I have been having trouble with the icing getting spotty and cloudy.  I put them in the fridge and it happened.  I thought it was the moisture...so I left them out overnight to dry, sometimes it happens, sometimes not.  Occasionally I sell these cookies for events, like baby showers or birthdays and it breaks my heart when I get up in the morning and the cookies are spotty.  Would ANYONE have any ideas on how to help me.  This is the best tasting icing recipe and I want to continue to use it.   Thanks

QUESTIONS: 1. Whole milk used? and is it room temp or from fridge? 2. Do you sift the powdered sugar? I read somewhere it is to prevent the white splotches in the following days.

I've used this recipe a lot and it's pretty much fool-proof.  It's very easy and always hardens well.  I've used both almond and vanilla extract and they both result in very impressive sugar cookies...try it!

This turned out perfect for us.  It makes a manageable amount and I wanted something without egg whites.  Our icing dried silky and was easy to pipe as well as flood.  I used clear vanilla extract in place of the almond.  Will be using this recipe again.

LOVE THIS icing, used the thick cookie dough, colored them in yellow, they were vibrant and really nice. Usually glazes are hard to see this was nice and easy and quick and held up well. Took a long time to dry. The blue I made came out thinner and more like a glaze, but I thinned with milk and not the corn syrup, which the recipe says to do. The yellow which came out vibrant and thick I used the corn syrup to thin.  Think its great.

This was a nice icing suprise.  I have glazed my sugar cookies for 40 years with powdered sugar, water, vanilla & color.  The corn syrup completely changed the process in a good way.  I did have to add more corn syrup and milk, but the outcome was very good.

Not only does this icing look fantastic, but it is super easy to work with and tastes great!  I will definitely use it from now on for cookies that look and taste great!  I needed and extra teaspoon of milk, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as stated.  I also tried it with vanilla and it is good that way, too.  What I love is that you can spread this on the cookie with a knife, and after you let it set, it smoothes out and looks shiny and perfect.  Highly, highly recommend this recipe!

THIS IS IT! You will never need another icing recipe for cookie decorating after this one! Very easy to make and looks very professional. I added a 1/2 tsp of milk at a time past the two tsp in the recipe until I reached the desired consistency. I was able to add a second color of icing about 20 minutes after the first  color without any bleeding of colors.

I agree that the proportions are off (thanks to prior reviewers for the advice), but when you get the right consistency, the icing is very good!    Got rave reviews from people at work!
I followed the recipe except I used 2T milk, and then added an extra 1/4 c. of powdered sugar after it turned out too thin for my liking.  After the adjustments, I was able to spread the icing on the cookies with a knife and it didn't run off the sides.  Still dried hard and shiny, but make sure to let them dry completely... it takes a bit to set hard enough to stack them or plate them.
I used with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe, and this amount frosted approx. 20 basic cookie cutter cookies...  I had to make another batch to finish the rest of my cookies. Whenever I bake sugar cookies in the future, I'll use this or the Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe depending on the kind of decorating I'm doing on the cookie.  This is better for detail work.

PERFECT ICING! I started out using only 1 tsp milk because I live in humid Texas, and ended up adding the other tsp to make a stiff icing. I used it to pipe my edges, then added an additional 1 tsp to the leftover icing to make it "flooding" consistency. My first try ever and my cookies look professional! I tried one batch with lemon juice instead of milk and vanilla instead of almond, and it was KILLER! thank you so much! love this recipe!

I must have done something wrong because the icing came out horrible.  I threw it away!  First of all...2 t. of milk and corn syrup for 1 cup of confectioners sugar?!?!?  I kept adding more and more of each and it just was not good at all!!  I thought it would come out better based on the reviews but it did not.  Disappointed! ;-(

I have used this recipe time and time again and it never fails! I too add extra milk and corn syrup to thin it out a bit. I use the Wilton gel food colors and the color is always vibrant and doesn't fade! One decorating tip (not sure if this has been posted in another review, if so I apologize) is to allow the icing to dry completely. Then to add decorative sugars/candies, I warm some corn syrup in a bowl, paint my design on the cookie with the corn syrup and sprinkle the sugars over it. The decorations stick to the cookie without sinking into the icing!

This was exactly what I was looking for. I took another reviewer's suggestion and added the milk to the bowl first, then gradually whisked in the powdered sugar. Once smooth, I added the corn syrup and extract. It colored really well with liquid food coloring and made exactly enough for a half batch of the Best Rolled Cookies from this site. I used brushes to paint it on. My cookies turned out so pretty and professional looking and tasted delicious!  FYI: As I was decorating, the icing started to set up in my bowls. I just added a little water with my paint brush (like I was using watercolor) to thin it back out, and it worked like a charm.

I LOVE this icing!  I used it on shamrock cut outs this year for St Patricks Day (I used "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie" recipe here).  The cookie itself is very plain which is perfect for this very sweet icing :)  Like other reviewers, I used 4 tsp of milk, 4 tsp of corn syrup, and 2 tsp of vanilla.  The consistency wasn't too runny and dried in a couple of hours.  The color was beautiful and shiny; they truly looked professional and tasted great.  I will never use anything else!

I have had trouble with two batches of this icing.  The icing is grainy and doesn't stay shiny but goes matt.  Any suggestions.  I have followed the recipe exactly (using vanilla)...I can't figure it out since everyone else is having great success...any suggestions?  Tastes good though.

Good,  I used vanilla extract since I don't like almond.  Set really nice on cookies but dries very fast in bowl so have to be quick.

I haven't tried this one out. But I am really considering it for my twenty thousand (exaggerating slightly) Christmas cookies. The only thing I am unsure about... some pictures show the frosting at such a perfect edge and others look like a two year old frosted them. How in the world do I get them to look so professional and not like I let my toddlers loose in the kitchen??? Any help is much appreciated!!!

This icing MADE my cookies!  I've always been unimpressed with sugar cookies before but that is now history.  I think now sugar cookies are going to be a staple item in our cookie jar now.   I was a little discouraged with the frosting at first because I needed WAY more milk and corn syrup than the recipe states, but I stuck with it because another reviewer said that she also had to play with it to get the right consistency.  And she was right. I did use whipping cream instead of milk (which may or may not have contributed to the problem with the consistency)  and I used Lemon extract for flavor which I believe I wil always use now because the lemon made these SO addicting!  I also dipped some of my cookies in chocolate and the resulting Lemon/chocolate combination was just plain AWESOME!  I simply love this recipe!

The ingredient amounts don't work as listed.  More milk has to be added.  I found that 2 Tbs was too much.  Next time I'll try less.

I'm giving 5 stars with the variations suggested by other reviewers. I used 1 heaping tbsp. of milk and 1 tbsp of corn syrup and the icing turned out beautiful. It was very easy to spread with a knife. To add extra embelishments I used a ziplock baggie as a piping bag and just snipped a small piece of the corner off. Edit: I tried this recipe again last night with the "Best Ever Chocolate Cutout Cookies" recipe from this site and substituted the almond with pepermint extract - WONDERFUL!

I increased the teaspoon measurements to tablespoon measurements like everyone said and ended up having to add more sugar because my icing ran over the sides of my cookies. If you want thick, spreadable icing that stays in place only add 1 Tbsp of milk. I also used 1/4 tsp vanilla instead of almond extract.

The icing tastes horrible wet, but once it dries it tastes really wonderful. I used the icing with the Soft Sugar Cookies V recipe on this site by Eileen Sieger. I highly recommend using that recipe along with this icing. A real winning combo.

There is no way these proportions are correct - the sugar was mostly dry after trying to mix in the wet ingredients...did anyone find a better combination of ingredients? I tried adding "a bit" more corn syrup but it was still like wet sand...

I needed to update this poor review I gave two years ago, because it wasn't clear to me that I needed to use a hand mixer or mixer to get the right consistency. I used a similar recipe for my cookies this year using a hand mixer and it was great. My family loved them. Thanks!

Amazing. I live in Europe and have trouble making frostings. This is the first one in 8 years that turned out perfectly! I had no corn syrup so substituted 4 teaspoons golden syrup. I had no almond extract so added 1/4 tsp citrus extract and 1 tsp vanilla. I separated into five bowls and added food coloring, covered with tin foil, baked the cookies and spread on with a knife and decorated with sprinkles etc... Someone else said it took a long time to harden, but within 15 minutes the icing hardened. They are delicious! Thank you so much for your recipe, so simple and perfect!

Great Base.  You will need to play around with the amount of milk & corn syrup to get it to the consistancy you need.  Dries beautiful & glossy.  As with any sugar cookie icing, allow several hours for drying time.  You can't make at 5 and take at 6.

The more corn syrup you add then the longer it takes to dry, sometimes as long as 10 hours. This recipe makes enough for about 12 cookies.

This icing makes beautiful, professional-looking cookies.  I used vanilla instead of almond extract and doubled the milk and corn syrup.  The consistency was perfect and if it started to thicken up I just added a few drops of corn syrup.  The icing was shiny, the colors looked great, and they hardened up nicely.  I will look no further for cookie icing recipes.

Very good base. For some reason I had to add about 4 teaspoons of milk to have the desired consistency...I couldn't even mix it with 2. The flavour and they way it stayed shiny was great though!

Substituted light corn syrup for sugar syrup, as was suggested by another user. This recipe made enough icing for about two dozen cookies, and I especially liked how it dried and hardened fairly quickly. It also tasted really good, not too sweet.

I wish that this had worked out better for me. After all the glowing reviews, I thought it was the best recipe to try, but the flavor is off and it's time consuming to use. I was hoping for a more opaque icing, but it was rather transparent...probably a side effect of my adding more milk than it called for. It tastes like powdered sugar with almond extract in it.

Love the way this turned out. However, do NOT add more corn syrup. Add more milk a little at a time to get the desired consistency. NOT corn syrup!

This is getting a 5 for the flavor, tasted so good and added just the right touch to my sugar cookies. As far as preparing the recipe, I had a little bit of trouble with my first batch because there was just not enough milk. The recipe says to add more corn syrup if it is too thick, but that really didn't help. The second batch I made, I added about 3 tsp. of milk & 3 tsp. corn syrup. It was the perfect consistancy for decorating my cookies!!!

This is the BEST icing recipe I have found for the "shiny-smooth" look on a cookie.  The icing doesn't mottle like the other recipes I've found that use egg white as an ingredient and no need for constant stirring.  The icings dry beautifuly and true to color.  **NOTE: As suggested by another reviewer, add the sugar a bit at a time to the milk, mixing thoroughly between addition.  Add a little milk to thin the icing if needed.  The corn syrup amount of 2 tsp. should stay the same.

This icing made pretty, shiny cookies.  It dried fairly fast which made decorating nice. My only complaint is the amount of liquid in this recipe is WAY off.  There is no way the amount of milk it called for would have allowed me to make a smooth icing.  I added a bit more milk and corn syrup until I got a consistency that I could work with.

I added a little extra milk and used vanilla instead of almond extract as a matter of personal preference. The icing set up perfectly and had the shiny finish I'd hoped for. I'll use this recipe for all my sugar cookies! I highly recommend this one to anyone looking for an easy cookie icing that holds its color and gives you a wonderful finished product.

This icing is shiny and definitely hardens like it states, but it's very difficult to use in a piping bag to write words because it's too thick (even after "thinning" it lots with the syrup).

This was good, but the milk and corn syrup was off. I had to add several more teaspoons of milk and corn syrup to be able to use it.. but it's pretty easy to do.. I used this on sugar cookies that I was making for Chanukah so I needed to make it white and blue.. I used clear vanilla extract that I found at wal-mart so that the color wouldn't affect the white.. It looks nice and tastes good when it dries. Good recipe with some modifications, and it's a good base to add whatever extract you like!

I used about 5 tsp of milk and an additional squeeze of corn syrup. I added the milk 1 tsp at a time until it reached the consistency I liked. I used this to decorate gingerbread cookies and it dries in about 40 minutes and remains glossy. Will make again!

This frosting works so well.  I've made it a couple of times now and with great success.  I do have to add a little more milk (usually double it).  You can use vanilla instead of almond extract.  I like either.  It's a great icing for "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe from this site.

I don't understand how this is getting such high ratings, the ingredients are listed in the wrong amounts, if you mix them exactly as stated, you end up with a powdery lumpy sticky mess.  This recipe needs 3tbsp milk and about 5 tbsp corn syrup.

Awesome Recipe!   I've never made a sugar cookie glaze before...but this was easy, quick & tasty.  I added about 4tsp. of milk though.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!  I was looking for something to use for Wedding Cookie Favors & I think I found it!

This is great, I always wondered how the pro's got the icing so smooth? I did have to use a little more milk then stated and I used extra almond flavoring and a little vanilla. And it's best to sift the powdered sugar first. I used the tall skinny keptchup and mustard tubes/containers to put the icing on the cookies, the little holes worked great. I outlined the cookies and if I wanted to cover the cookie in icing I drizzled it all over the cookie and used a knife to spead it around. it's best if you want to accent or layer the cookies to let the bottom coat dry for a few minutes then put your accents on, otherwise the icing "melts" into the other. Thanks for sharing!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe! Paired it up with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe and they were awesome! This icing is wonderful because you can basically do with it what you want! I made it a little thicker at first, then piped the outline, then thinned it out and filled the outline in. PERFECT- I will use it every time I make sugar cookie! Thanks!

I finally found a good recipe i can use to frost my cookies!! The only change i did make was using honey instead of corn syrup.  As a substitute, you are supposed to use boil equal parts distilled water and honey....i boiled 2 tbsp of honey with 2 tbsp of water (i boiled extra just in case i needed to make more icing) and used the 2 tsp of this mixture to replace the 2 tsp of corn syrup.  Its a healthy replacement. The icing still kept its shine and im pretty positive it did not change the taste either!!

This tasted great, and was a nice creamy white color. I used whipping cream instead of milk, and put it on some of our 'Best Ever Chocolate Cutout Cookies' from this site. Great combination. This was one of the easier icing recipes out there, but didn't taste like pure powdered sugar (like so many of them do!). The only change I made was subbing vanilla for the almond extract.

I used this recipe for the first time and was a little disappointed.  I probably didn't make it thick enough, but I found it too runny and not fast-drying as a lot of reviews had said.  I have always previously used basically the same recipe except with butter instead of corn syrup and thought I'd try this because of the reviews.  The corn syrup does make it shinier, and I like that.  The tastes are the same to me.  I'll have to play around with the consistency.

Excellent. I've tried several recipes for icing here and this worked out the best for what I was looking for in terms of flavor and glossy finish. You will probably need to add a little more milk, but start with the quantity it calls for and determine for yourself. Look no further, this is the one!

I make this icing more like a glaze and it dries hard so you can stack the cookies easily.  It is the tastiest icing I have ever eaten, and no raw egg makes it particularly appealing to me.

When I decorate sugar cookies with this icing I have recieved rave reviews from all.  Wonderful!

This is absolutely the best cookie icing I've ever had!  It looks beautiful on the cookies, it really does stay shiny, and the designs look sharp and professional.  And it tastes great!  I didn't add extra milk, but I did have to add quite a bit more corn syrup and it worked out fine.  I tried adding cocoa powder for a chocolate flavor, but I don't recommend it - the flavor was faint, and the color was pretty ugly!

Love this recipe! I often use lemon juice or some other extract in place of the almond and it's just as good. I do add a pinch of salt too, and I find that really sets the taste off.

Awesome!  I used this to make pumpkin cookies for a Halloween party at work.  I love the shine and the flavor.  However, one batch didn't make enough...glad I doubled it to start with.  I always use Martha Stewart's sugar cookie recipe as it's the BEST.

I've not been making cookies & icing but for a few months.  I STILL HAVE MAJOR DIFFICULTY GETTING THE ICING CONSISTENCY CORRECT.  Mine is almost always too thin & runs.  I'm still trying :)  And this icing is SUPER SUPER SWEET to me.

This icing worked out awesome!  However, I only gave it four stars because I think the amounts of ingredients is a little off, and the recipe made virtually no icing.  (I had to make 5 batches just to cover my cookies)  I had to add way more milk and corn syrup than the recipe called for just to be able to blend the ingredients together.  The end product after the tweaking though, was outstanding.  This will be my go to sugar cookie icing from now on.

EXCELLENT!!  This is just the recipe I was looking for, and do not need to search for anything else.  Dries up beautifully, with a very pretty shine!  I had to use 2T. of milk to get just the right consistency, and then was able to use a pastry brush to frost my cookies.  I was only able to frost 12 fairly large cookies per batch.  I wouldn't recommend doubling the batch though, just make as you need, as it does dry fairly quickly.  You will no doubt have beautiful cookies with this recipe!

I always use Wilton's Buttercream Frosting for my cookies, but decided to try this, too. WOW! The combination of the two on The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site is amazing. I used Simple Syrup (get from any liquor store) in place of corn syrup and just plain water...but needed more than 2 tsp. Start with two and work your way from there to desired consistency. We used paintbrushes and the toddlers LOVED it. Almond extract is the best, too...yum, yum, yum.

Perfect! But only when you add more milk; 2 tsp of milk is not enough. You'll probably need 4-5. If it called for more milk, 5 stars!

Something is terribly wrong with this recipe. I needed 2 T of milk and corn syrup to get the right consistency. But then it didn't dry quickly enough. I was hoping this was the one I used to use and it was perfect. Nope.

I love this recipe!  It does thicken as it sits, so don't make it too thick to begin.  I like to make it plain with vanilla instead of the almond, or if I make it with almond then I substitute honey for corn syrup.

How funny!  I was just browsing the web site and came across this recipe.  I work at a bakery as the cake decorator...which also includes the job of icing and decorating all the sugar cookies and cupcakes, etc.  This is the exact recipe we use to frost our sugar cookies.  The bakery itself has been open for over 20 years and people love the cookies there and most of them say it is because of the icing.  The secret to it is the almond extract.  It is runny at first but once you let it dry you can decorate and make your cookies look great.

The thicker the better. I made a really thin batch and it ran off the cookies so i had to throw it out. When you make it, add the liquids then add the powdered sugar GRADUALLY! I didnt do that the first time and it wouldnt mix in, so I added more milk. That was obviously not the right thing to do.

The first batch I made was a total disaster - of course, I didn't read any reviews and couldn't figure out why my icing resembled crumbled white cake.  I kept adding corn syrup as the recipe states, but soon figured out that it's milk that needs to be added also.    I'll try again, kids had a blast "painting" our Easter egg cookies!

I paired this recipe with The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies, also found on AllRecipes.  Fabulous.  Once dried, the icing maintains glossy vibrant color, and is easy to work with.  This will definitely be my go-to sugar cookie icing recipe.

If you're like me and realized too late that you don't have food coloring, there's a tasty sub. KOOL-AID! I used a sprinkle of strawberry-passion fruit, not only was it a pretty pink, but it tasted awsome. I'm using KOOL-AID from now on.

This was my first time making icing for cookies.  I did not have corn syrup, so I used pancake syrup and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I thought it was very easy to make and turned out great.  I will definitely make again!

DING DING DING, WE HAVE A WINNER!

This was GREAT.  Worked perfectly with regular food coloring.  I used some of the other suggestions (slightly more Corn Syrup and Milk) when brushing on the 1st coat of icing.  And it is MUCH easier to use a small paint brush for this.  I realized that some of the colors were mottled, but I thickened up with sugar just a tad and it was perfect.  I used the original recipe as worded for the detail work.  Divided into 5 sandwich baggies, added coloring to each, snipped a teeny-tiny hole into the corner, and away I went!  After 4 hours or so of drying, they still stuck a little bit in transport, but nothing serious.  I received Ooohs and Aaahs galore at our bakesale.  I can't wait to try different extracts!  

Yes, this is a sweet icing.  But when used with 'The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies' on this site, it is PERFECT.

I used this with my seven year old son and had great success with this recipe. I did take the advice of another reviewer and used 4 tsps of milk and 1 tbs of corn syrup and the consistency was perfect. I must admit I did not have corn syrup so I looked up a recipe online and tried to make it, but failed, so I resorted to using maple syrup (the imitation kind) because I knew it was made up of mostly corn syrup. The slight maple flavor combined with vanilla (I did not use the almond extract) tasted great. I agree with the other reviewers this dries nicely and has a great shine making it look just like a cookie you would buy in a bakery, thanks for the great tips.

I did not have any light corn syrup on-hand (neither did my neighbors) so I ended up skipping that ingredient and using more milk instead.  I was afraid the icing wouldn't be shiny, but it turned out just fine!  Next time I'll try it with the corn syrup, to see if it makes a difference, but it's nice to know it still works without it.  I was using the recipe to ice cookies large enough to put on a stick, and it was enough for just over a dozen of them.

Very easy and quick recipe.  The color and consistency was perfect.  Very easy to double and you can use almost any flavor you would like.  I used almond, lemon, and vanilla.

It was a bit runny, not good for detailed cookies unless you add more sugar.  Love how glossey it dried.  If you are going to use vanilla instead of almond extract, i would use the clear and not the brown.

This icing was great. I mixed together every ingredient listed in the recipe thoroughly, then added extra milk by the 1/2 tsp, stirring until I got an ideal consistency. I piped a thicker icing outline along the silhouette of my sugar cookies, then once it dried slightly, filled in the outline with a slightly runnier/thinner consistency icing, & smoothed the centre out with the tip of a toothpick. After several hours once it dried completely they were stackable. The cookies looked professionally done & were beautifully smooth, tasty too.

Loved the icing.  Confused with those who said adjustments were off, recipe incomplete , if you watched the video it says to add more corn syrup or milk little by little to the consistency you desire, thick or thin..  The instructions are there., the video gives you an idea of how thick the icing is, but at some point it's up to you as the baker to decide how thick you want the icing to be.  When I get a recipe for a frosting to frost a cake, it doesn't say how thick to frost my cake or cupcakes, the decision is mine. I don't care for almond flavoring, so I used vanilla, taste is an individual thing. Shouldn't be a bad review if instructions were not completely reviewed. Thank you for the honey and lemon suggestions.

I have used it for many years, and it's great except that when it says to add more corn syrup it consistently needs 3 times as much as the recipe says. Do not make a larger batch because it will start to dry in the bowl before you can use it up.  Just repeat the easy recipe if you have more cookies.  In recent years I have quit using corn syrup and instead make a clear syrup using 3 Tbsp granulated sugar and 3 Tbsp water cooked together for 2 and 1/2 min. in my 1250W microwave.  I can't tell any difference and it saves the bother of having light corn syrup around with no other purpose than this recipe.

I am giving this four stars because it was a good starter recipe.  The amounts needed were off.  I probably used double the amount needed for both the milk and corn syrup because as listed you could cut it with a knife.  Once adjusted it does retain color and flavor.  Be prepared to adjust as you go.  I will still use this again.

The perfect icing for sugar cookies!  It is easy to work with, dries beautiful & shiny, and best of all - it tastes DELICIOUS!  The only change I make is to use vanilla instead, I'm not a fan of almond extract.

I had to use about 4 teaspoons of milk to even get this to mix together. Was worried that this change would prevent it from drying hard, but it didn't. The almond extract is awesome, but I think the amount needs to be doubled too.

Don't add too much almond extract or it tastes not to my liking. Couldn't get it to the right consistency, as the only solid thing was the powdered sugar, and it tasted wayyyyy too sweet. Fun to dip though, but not goo dfor making shapes or tube icing.

This is my favorite sugar cookie icing—I've used it so much, I have it memorized! I've tried it with almond extract as it suggests, but also vanilla extract and once with a teaspoon of lemon juice AND vanilla. You can alternate it any way you'd like with extracts and it will still taste great. It goes on pretty wet and drippy but dries quickly once on the cookies. Be sure that your sugar cookies are completely cooled before you put on this icing, though. If you're looking for a quick, easy, delicious icing recipe, I recommend you go with this one.

This is a wonderful recipe that fully deserves all the great reviews. I've made it a few times now and it works well for me every time. I love the ease of preparation and the fact that the cookies can be stacked without sticking to each other or harming the design of each cookie. I learned that the recipe, if need be, can be thinned with milk (instead of additional corn syrup) with good results. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I love this icing recipe! I ended up using this to decorate my sugar cookies for the holidays!

I did have to adjust the recipe to add about 2-3 tablespoons of additional milk, but otherwise, it set beautifullly and with a goregous shine!

I even made a sparkly white icing by adding edible silver dust to the mixture. This allowed me to outline and decorate the cookies with an added sparkle!

This icing was easy to make.  I used this icing with the Soft Ginger Cutouts recipe on this website, and they were so good!  I substituted vanilla for the almond in some of them.  I had to work with the ingredient amounts to get it to the desired thickness.  Also, I used equal amounts of red, green, and blue gel food colorings plus a little of the yellow gel food coloring to make black icing for the pebbles on the snowman's face.  I didn't have time to ice all of the cookies before work, so I just left the icing covered on the counter, and realized that I could use it still after work, by just stirring it hard several times.  I will definitely use this icing for cookies from now on...

I read A LOT of the reviews and I just don't get how people say the receipt didn't work.  It was perfect.  You just had to adjust the thickness w/small amounts of milk or corn syrup and blend really well each time you added extra until you got your desired thickness.  As for the taste, it was fabulous! If you don't like almond extract you can't say the cookies tasted bad, you should say they weren't a flavor you cared for.  I took them to my school's teacher lounge and they were complimented up and down.  I will never use another receipts...O and they were totally stackable in a container.  I frosted at 8 pm and by 7 am they were perfectly dried and ready to go...DELISH

Beautiful, shiny, and easy to apply. I followed everyone's suggestion to add light corn syrup when it dried up. I also added vanilla instead of almond extract since I prefer that. It was delicious!

I haven't tried the recipe yet, but after browsing the photos and seeing all of the creations it has inspired, it has to be good. All of the decorations are spectacular. What a fun recipe.

This is a great recipe for frosting cookies. You can smooth it on with a spatula or use a piping bag to make decorations.  If you are doing alot of cookies, however, make more than one batch.  I frosted 3 dozen when I doubled this recipe and I scraped the bowl clean to do all 3 dozen.

This is the BEST icing I have ever used! It's such a great base to start with- I've used just about every kind of flavored extract (my favorite is lemon) and it is wonderful each time. When I want it to spread more easily, I just add a few drops of milk to get the right consistency. I always make sure to add the food coloring before I adjust the consistency. Even a small amount of gel coloring will thin this icing out. This icing works well for piping, too.

Great recipe, but I just wanted to note that if you plan on using this as a white icing, you will have to add a little more milk, I recommend 1 tsp. Makes a very nice clean white icing.

I never knew making my own cookies could be so easy! I need about 75 cookies for a Christmas party and my local bakery charges about $2 each. I decided to expirement with a batch using rolled sugar cookies with this icing. Had to use a little more milk than called for and heat the bowl in the microwave for about 7 seconds every 3rd cookie but they look great and taste awesome!

This icing was very easy to work with, and took colors beautifully.  I tried it on a batch of sugar cookies flavored with almond extract, and everyone loved them after Thanksgiving dinner.  I am going to be using it a lot this holiday season.

I made this exactly like the recipe says and ended up with VERY hard icing.  I added another 1/2 teaspoon of milk and 1/2 teaspoon of corn syrup and it was fine for the border of the cookies.  I had to add more milk and syrup to get it thin enough to flood the interior of the cookies.  I would definitely make this again but add more milk and syrup like I did today.

As advertised, this recipe works great.  I did add 1-2 extra tsp. of milk which made it the perfect consistency.  I was only able to coat 2 dozen cookies, with the recipe as written, so I do suggest you double it to start so you don't run out.

Easy, delicious, and beautiful!  The color stays really vivid, and has just a bit of a sheen to it.  It makes the cookies look like the kind you get at a gourmet bakery!  Dries nicely so that I can stack my cookies without all of them getting icing smeared everywhere.  Great recipe!

The first reviewer who called this icing the Holy Grail is not kidding.  This icing dries shiny, the cookies are stackable.  I played around with the consistency of the icing and made multiple batches with one bottle for piping and one bottle for flooding for each color.  Fantastic recipe and I really like that there's not meringue powder/egg whites of shortening!  Thank you for sharing!!

I always use this icing for sugar cookies including cookie lollipops/bouquets, and it is perfect!  I substitute butter extract or clear lemon extract for the almond.  It tastes great and dries hard and shiny (sometimes I microwave it for about 10 seconds to make it extra shiny).

The perfect icing for cut out cookies! Thanks JBS! Beautiful finish and easy to work with. 

I like a thin dipping glaze, so increased the milk and corn syrup to about a TBS plus 1 tsp each. Substituted lemon extract for the almond and added 2 packets of Tru-Lemon crystals.  HEAVEN over lemon cookies (any basic cut out cookie recipe) but add zest from 2 lemons, lemon extract instead of vanilla, and 4 packets of Tru-Lemon crystals to the dough.  Left-over icing was great over a loaf of banana bread.

I bet that's 2 Tablespoons of milk instead of 2 t. Water works well too.  Only three stars because of the error.

I tried this recipe because of all the great reviews...but I didn't think the icing was that great and either did my family.  I'm not sure if it was the corn syrup or the almond extract but it just had an overwhelming flavor and smell...and I followed the recipe exactly.  It seems after a couple of days though it wasn't as strong but I will be again searching for that perfect sugar cookie icing recipe!

Food Colors stay saturated with this recipe. I didn't have corn syrop; substituted with Trader Joes Blue Agave Sweetener once and later with honey. I think any syrupy liquid would probably work. I also used soy milk once instead of milk. Probably any tiny quantity of liquid would work. I never measured either; I used a large proportion of confectioner's sugar, to a few 'squirts' of syrup, and then I added a very small quantity of milk to approximate the recipe's indicated proportions. If the mixture was too thick I might ad a drop of milk. Results were great.

PERFECT!!!!  Just make sure you read the directions.  I didn't read the first time, I just thew it all together...that won't work.  The icing, when done properly, is perfect.

Liked the icing, didn't like the almond flavor.  I would make this again, but with vanilla extract.  Like some others, I used more milk than was called for. Also, I needed three batches of this icing to ice one batch of cookies.

Delicious icing! The almond flavoring really makes this recipe fantastic. I have also tried lemon extract, and it is equally delicious. You want this icing to be a nice paintable consistency, not too thick not too runny.  Keep adding milk and corn syrup until it is a consistency you feel comfortable working with. I gave this four stars because I feel like the measurements are off a bit. For me, the best consistency was to increase both the milk and corn syrup to 3 teaspoons each and to increase the extract to 1/2 teaspoon. Hope that helps!

Like many others, I had to tweak this recipe a little bit, to satisfy my own ideas of what kind of consistency it should have.  Otherwise, though, it was great with a yummy, unique taste.  It's important to note that this is an ICING or glaze, not a frosting.  I think some of the negative reviews may have come from people expecting a frosting-like consistency.

EXCELLENT! It's not too soft that you can't stack the cookies and it's not so hard that you bust a tooth eating it. I added just a bit more milk to smooth it out but it was great! This is my goto recipe for cookie frosting from now on!

Excellent frosting. I doubled the ingredients and used them to frost the borders of 40 three-inch gingerbread men. There was just enough left over. It dried nice and firm.

I used this as a 'base coat' for my cookies, and did more detailed decorating with traditional royal icing. i did have to play around to get the consistency i desired, but you should start with what the recipe calls for and go from there.

Nothing against almond but I only had vanilla.  The taste is good and the icing is nice and shiny.  Only rated a 3 star because the measurements didnt work for me.  I had to add more milk.  This is great icing for piping but doesnt work well for kids to paint with.

First of all, the directions are completely off!  Putting 2 tsp of milk into 1 cup of powdered/confectioners sugar and expecting it to become smooth is a joke!!!  I ended up adding 2 TBSP of milk to get a very THICK, but smooth consistency and then added 1/2 TSP of vanilla (as I have a child allergic to nuts).  I then added the corn syrup 1 TSP at a time for a total of 8 TSP!  The icing did not taste that bad, but not that great either.  Because of the excess corn syrup it does leave an after taste.  It took the coloring very well, I just used generic food coloring, but it did not harden that well at all, I had to let it sit overnight before the frosting became hard.  Overall, I had enough icing to put one thin layer of frosting on 32 cookies, cut into x-mas shapes.  I do not recommend this recipe and I will not be using it again.

I loved this icing recipe! Most sugar cookie icing recipes I have tried end up too runny or too thick, but this came out great. I did have to add one extra scant teaspoon of milk. Once dry, the icing set up hard and shiny. The almond extract is a really nice flavor.

I have used this for awhile now but my cookies do not look near as pretty as the pictures you see of decorated sugar cookies. Can someone share some tips on how to get that look - is it spread or piped on while in a very thin consistency?

I've just finished using this recipe and it was great. Now, to address the consistency issue I've seen on here. It's very critical that you start with all wet ingredients first. Add powdered sugar last. And even then, just add enough to get the consistency you are looking for. I've made 3 batches of this tonight, due to the size of the cookies I'm decorating, and each batch came out great.    Also, the reason for the corn syrup, it gives the icing a nice glossy appearance.

I'm honestly not sure how this recipe has received such good ratings. Isn't one of the main factors in determining a good recipe accurate measurements? I don't know how it is possible for ANYONE to make a smooth frosting with only two tsp. of milk. I did not care for the almond extract flavor. After adding more milk and using vanilla in place of the almond extract, did I find this recipe to be tolerable. I give this recipe one star only because I was able to use a few of the ingredients. It's not a good recipe if it has to be revamped.

As if this recipe needs any more reviews...but it is so good, that I have to comment. I had all but given up on iced sugar cookies bc they took so much time and never looked as nice as I imagined they would. This icing recipe has inspired me. Seriously life changing. 2/14/11 Update: I used this icing several times with really good results- the colors are bright and it dries hard and shiny. My only complaint was that it was super sweet- sometimes overpowering the cookie. So this time, I followed the recipe except for only using 1 tsp of corn syrup. For my taste, this was a great adjustment. Still get the shiny, hard icing, but a bit less sweet.

I had to double the amount of milk (used skim) and the amount of almond extract.  The icing was really shiny at first, but not so much after a few days.  Insanely delicious!!!

I followed the recipe to a T and the two teaspoons of milk wasn't NEARLY enough to make the 1 cup of powdered sugar "smooth". It was a clumpy mess, so I had to add more milk, and more corn syrup then stated. It never completely hardened. I don't understand why this recipe has such high reviews!

Very easy to make.  Shiny and Smooth.  I used gel food coloring and added the extra 2T of milk. One tip: Do not double this recipe!  I tried that with my first batch and ended up throwing half of it away because it was too hard to work with.

5 star recipe! The icing dries smooth and clear. I guess the corn syrup is the secret ingredient. Just make sure you read the directions! I tried adding everything in at the same time and the corn syrup kinda clumped up; another tsp of milk and 1/2 cup sugar fixed it though.

I do cookie bouquets and this is a great icing that holds up well on the cookies.  I always get lots of compliments on the flavor. I do add a bit of vanilla extract along with the almond extract. If you are doing decorating and are doing another color or outlining the cookie, you MUST let the first layer dry completely before doing the additional decorating. If not, the outline or other colors will simply "melt" into the first.

I've never had luck with icing hardening up enough to stack the cookies until this recipe. It came out perfect and delicious. I like the fact there is no raw eggs like royal icing so it's safe for little ones. I used vanilla instead of almond extract, brushed it on the cookies with a foam brush and sprinkled colored sugar before it dried. The kids loved it!

This is very good and turns out shiny and hard.  You need to play with the measurements a bit to get the consistency you are looking for.  I replace the almond extract with clear vanilla extract because I don't like the flavor of the almond.

It is absolutly amazing and when teamed up with the "Rolled Cookie" recipe you will have a match made in heaven. I highly recommend purchasing the paste colors from the Craft stores over the liquid colorings from the grocery store. Keep the consistancy thicker for non-messy spreading. I used a squeeze bottle for easy control and a paint brush (also from Michaels). :) Good luck...use this for all occasions. :) Keep the cookies 1/2 inch for softer cookies!

easy to follow, i had to add a lot more corn syrup than called for, but it was fine. my only issue was the almond extract, yech!! next time i will use vanilla, i didn't realize the almond extract would give such a strong flavor with such a small amount.

Very hard sticky consitency. Did not spread well at all, and I even added more milk and corn syrup as suggested by others. Makes a very small amount- maybe enough for 5 cookies at most.

Really does dry nice and hard!  I was fooled for a moment as I was mixing up the ingredients...it got a bit tough to mix together, but turned out great when you pipe them.  I used vanilla extract instead and it was still delicious.

I just made this, and am so excited!  This reminds me of the icing on the sugar cookies at a bakery when I was growing up.  It smooths out and dries beautifully.  The only negative is it doesn't make much, so double the recipe.
I made it the first time and had to add an additional 1 tsp of corn syrup.  I ran out, and quickly made another batch.  This time I didn't have any extract, so I substituted 1 tsp of fresh lemon juice.  The consistency and taste of the second batch was the best.

This recipe worked out for me - but it took a while. As written, there is not nearly enough liquid. I just kept adding milk and corn syrup until I had the consistency I was looking for. Dried nice and shiny - and tasted fine - but as it happens, I'm not very good at decorating. Thanks!

Excellent constancy!  I’ve used it a couple of times and found, as many mentioned, I needed a bit more milk, but got a nicer finish if I didn’t thin too much.  Additionally, when I added too much syrup, it cracked a little when dry.  When I used both milk and syrup to thin the end result was flawless!

I LOVE this recipe , I hate royal icing because of the raw egg and this is the perfect substitute .  The colors stay shiny and bright and the texture is perfect . 

I like to switch up the flavor of the icing  varying from almond, amaretto , vanilla or even anise. Lemon would be great too .. :)

This icing works really well and I always thought it was understood that you should play with the liquid/dry ratio a little because depending on your climate and altitude everything was subject to change so I am not sure why so many people are complaining about the liquids being off. BUT I just wanted to rate this recipe because I had never thought of adding in karo syurp and I ended up with such a glossy and professional finish to the cookies... its fantastic! I also used vanilla instead of almond just because I don't like almond extract.

Excellent icing recipe!!  I only added 1 teaspoon of milk (to make three) and found the consistency perfect for painting on the icing.  I used 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extract instead of almond, and I found it a tad too lemony, so will reduce it slightly next time, or try vanilla.  The icing dried with a nice shiny finish, and didn't dent when stacked. I don't think I'll ever try another icing recipe!

This was great, easy-to-use, super shiny icing. I used vanilla extract, but I'll likely try lemon extract next time. The vanilla allowed a bit too much of that "pure sugar" taste to come through. I don't like corn syrup, so I used agave nectar instead. (Agave nectar is a very low glycemic index sweetener that doesn't impart any flavor; it's the same consistency and color as corn syrup.) My boyfriend, his son and I decorated Christmas cookies tonight,and the icing was really easy to work with. Two teaspoons of the milk was enough; I let it mix for about a minute, though.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I cannot stress enough-LEAVE OUT THE ALMOND EXTRACT. It just gives the icing a twang and is not very good. Next time I will use a little vanilla extract.  But everything else was perfect. This stuff dries nicely and will enable you to stack the cookies.   I just hate I used the almond extract.  But to each thier own.  This was perfect in every other way!

THE BEST ICING FOR ROLL-OUT SUGAR COOKIES!  It ends up being shiny and forming a hard top - DIVINE!  I always have to multiply the recipe quite a few times, because it always ends up taking way more than you would think.  I used this recipe with the recipe for Soft Christmas Cookies and made a really cute cookie boquet.  :)

I had to add a good bit of extra corn syrup to make it dippable, but the icing dried smooth and bright.  A note to future users: because the powdered sugar has corn starch in it, the icing resists pressure when stirred.  If your icing seems stiff, try stirring it more gently and it should "behave."

Great recipe if you're looking for icing that dries hard.  Like others have said it needs more liquids.  My tip is to put it into baggies and cut off the tip.  Even if you're going to spread it out, it keeps it much cleaner and easier to work with.  It also doesn't dry out while you're working with it that way.

I agree with the other reviewers that some of the ratios are off.  I made small batches and halfed the recipe because I was using a lot of different colours.  I added a tablespoon of milk, but halfed all the other ingredients and it was the perfect consistancy for piping.  To make it more spreadable I added a little more milk and corn syrup.

The colours were amazing, and the icing dried really nice and shiny. I will use this again

I love this for cookies it dries hard and shiny and can be dyed any vibrant color. The only change i made was adding vanilla extract instead of almond...just because i do not particularly enjoy almond extract.

This icing was originally very stiff and hard to stir but I added more milk and it was much more pliable. Very tasty - I love how it stays nice and shiny. The almond flavor was a nice touch, too. I wouldn't try to decorate with this icing, however, since it spreads and doesn't hold its shape. Overall, a keeper.

This recipe definitely only needs 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar or you'll need to add more milk.  I didn't like the almond flavor so I left it out (can substitute for vanilla extract as other suggest).  But the gloss it gives is fantastic.  People thought they were from a bakery.

This is the best tasting sugar glaze for sugar cookies I have ever tasted. It is very versatile and flavourful. I love the almond flavour but next time I will try using lemon flavour.

This frosting was SO easy to make and work with! Even my 2-yr-old twins could use it! It also dried beautifully and firmed up nicely but didn't get rock hard like royal icing. I substituted lemon juice for some of the milk to contrast with the sweetness.

Truly, I think this recipe needs more milk added to the mix to get the right consistency. Corn syrup would have taken forever. It might work if you're working in a hot kitchen, but I was working in a cool place. Once you have that figured out, it works quite well. The almond extract is brilliant in this simple glaze and really enhances the flavor of simple sugar cookies. The glaze is nice and hard and maintains a beautiful sheen. I have used a variation of this recipe for three years now. It's a hit.

This recipe was pretty bad, there was so much extra sugar that it didn't even make one solid ball or anything! never mind a paste! even after adding more corn syrup like it recommended, it was still not proper icing texture.

This recipe was perfect for Christmas cookies. Dried nice and hard- it did take a bit to try though the way my kids put it on. I also watered it down a bit (with mostly water and a little milk) so that they could paint it on with toothpicks. I will definatly use this one again as I've tried just powdered sugar and water with food coloring and it tasted like paste- this has a great flavor and dries so much nicer.

I absolutely loved this icing recipe!!!! It looks so nice! I used yellow food color and used lemon extract to ice the lemon butter cookies from this site. I had to add a little more milk and corn syrup. Make sure you let them dry completely before stacking though.The top seems dry but it takes a while to dry completely. I will use this all the time!!! Thanks a million Janice!

While I loved how shiny this turned out, I thought it was a bit too sweet.  It also became hard very, very quickly making it a bit difficult to work with.  I think I'll stick to my grandmother's icing recipe.

My daughter and I made sugar cookies this past Christmas (2014) and used this recipe AS IS - no alterations.  And it came out beautifully.  I won't search for another. This one's a keeper.  Dried/hardened to a nice soft shell, glossy finish that we could touch without ruining.  Lovely even after transport and easy to use.  We just used plastic zip sandwich baggies with the tiniest portion of the tips cut off to decorate from start to finish.  Thank you to the contributor

first- you need to double the amount of milk. I tried 3 times to make it thinking what am I doing wrong. It was clumpy. I added milk until it was a good consistency then worried it wouldn't set. Tried it on a cookie and it set perfectly! I made batches to color and put them in zip lock bags. They stayed moist. Very easy to frost everything. Dried to a beautiful shine and does taste delicious. SO- don't worry about the 2 teaspoons of milk- it is not enough but the frosting will work!!!!

This icing is very good.  However, after the icing dries after a few hours, it does not stay shiny.  It seems to fade.  Does anyone have any tips?  Ginger

Worked great for me! As other reviewers have mentioned, I had to play with the milk/corn syrup amounts. 2 tsp of milk was laughable. I'm wondering if I need to add more corn syrup though next time b/c one batch was shinier than the other :-)  I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of butter nut flavoring too- everyone loved it! Great recipe that just needs some tweaking. Prepare for it to take a few hours for it to dry before they are stackable.

I use this recipe all the time and get very positive comments.  I did not give the recipe 5 stars because as written it comes out way too thick.  It needs at least double the amount of milk.

Fabulous. Followed recipe to start then adjusted as needed using more milk to thin. I used just a small splash of vanilla as I didn't have almond and the taste was excellent. Do one small batch as written at a time, use it, then make another as it will start to harden if you try to do more. It is very easy to use and very forgiving. If you start using it and it seems a little thin, just throw a little conf sugar in and mix up. I used Wilton gel colors. I heavily flooded 4" cookies completely covered with red and had to let dry about 4 hours before I could move on to the next color. If you are just doing a light outline, the drying time is about and hour or so. I did a ton of cookies and nothing faded and no colors ran. No more Royal Icing ever here. Thanks for the great recipe.

It's just a preference, but I prefer the butter cream recipe on the cookies.  Plus, this frosting stuck to the wax paper when I layered the cookies.

AMAZING!!!
I used water instead of milk and agave instead of light corn syrup. The icing still hardens quickly and is shiny.

To make it thinner I added extra water (1 tsp at a time) so that I could more easily pipe onto cookies. I used disposable bags for the different colors to pipe on cookies. 

Please make sure to mix in order using beaters, this prevents lumps from being in icing and again makes it easier for piping.

This is a great icing recipe.  I always have to add more milk than what the recipe calls for, usually closer to 4t.  After icing I put the cookies in the fridge for about an hour to speed up the drying process.  After that they are good to go and can be stacked and stored easily.

this icing turned out really nice, and the almond flavor worked really well with sugar cookies. But if you are making a lot of cookies, I would make a LOT more of this icing, as this recipe does not yield a lot of icing. I would say if you want to make icing in different colors, make this amount for EACH color. I made about 4-5 dozen cookies to bring to work with me at Christmas and needed triple the amount of icing that I got from following this recipe.

This leaves a very shiny icing that sets quickly after frosted.  It needed more milk, it was nearly enough as other reviews had stated.  I just mixed in milk slowly until I had the desired consistency!

I didn't sift the sugar, so my icing was a thick, clumpy paste.  I added more corn syrup, but it didn't help.  Then, I added a bunch of milk and perfection.  The icing was great, but took some work getting there.

I subbed the almond extract with vanilla.  Great for painting onto cookies!  My only real issue with this recipe is that I think the milk amount should have been closer to 2 Tablespoons as the 2 teaspoons as listed didn't even get the icing sugar to even start to liquify.

I quadrupled the recipe to ice 6 dozen cookies. I am used to a thicker frosting and this tasted a little too much like confectioners sugar for me. I prepared the recipe as directed in the large quantity as mentioned above then added 1/4 cup butter, 4 additional tablespoons corn syrup, and  1/2 cup powdered sugar. It then tasted awesome..very sweet! It iced easily, maintained the shiny appearance, and dried well.

Once I adjusted the recipe I would give it 5 stars, but there was simply not enough liquid in it as written. I used 4 tsp of milk rather than 2, that is the only thing I changed and it turned out perfectly. I also had to double the recipe to cover a whole batch of cookies. If you add a little more powdered sugar to thicken up the icing than it pipes nicely for edging or more elaborate decorating.

Very easy to work with although I needed about 2 extra tsp of milk to make it spreadable.  So shiny and profesional looking.  Thank you JBS BOX for this simple recipe.

At first I thought this icing would remain sticky and tacky, but after time it did harden up.  I too needed to add a bit more milk/corn syrup. So give it time, a few hours at least and they will harden.  I used different food colorings and b/c it was allergen free (I used soy milk), it was safe to use with my granddaughter who is allergic.

Good basic recipe.  I fiddled with the amounts, but it still turned out well.  I also used dye and the color didn't fade too much.

I use this every time my kids and I make cookies, sooo easy and looks perfect when dried. I try to make it a little runny with double the milk so my kids can paint rather than ice the cookies. I usually quadruple the recipe to have enough for the 3 dozen cookies I make.

If your icing turns out splotchy, you need to stir your icing more to dissolve the powdered sugar more.  This recipe tasted good, but for better artistic ability, I think I will use royal icing next time.  Edit 2013 used this again for Christmas cookies and turned out much better.  Make sure to follow directions and I had to use a lot more milk, but the icing was easy to use, dried well, and tasted great.

I'll never use egg whites again. I'm so glad I found this recipe. I love it. The only thing is that I needed more milk than the recipe called for. I've used almond extract and orange. I like them both. I'm sure vanilla would taste great also.

This is a great EDIBLE icing recipe. As with all "royal icings" its very finicky about exact measurements along with temp and humidity levels where you're making it.  I like that it tasted good even after drying.

This was a decent icing recipe, but I found it needed a bit more liquid.   Also, the icing discolored after a few hours - i'm not too sure why??  I've never really had that happen before so i'm a bit puzzled.  I used butter flavoring in stead of almond (which was nice!). probably wont be using this recipe again.

I've used this recipe several times and it has turned out great.  I think it is very versatile and can handle variations by adding whatever is your favorite flavoring (ie. vanilla, almond, lemon or whatever).  It works best when consistency is fairly thick, slowly runs off spoon, then you can just use a small cake spatula to spread on cookies.  Bring the frosting right to edges of cookie and then go around edge of cookie with spatula to clean up corners, they look great!  Plus it dries pretty quick so you can stack them...if I frost them late in the evening they are perfectly dry by morning to stack into containers.  Thanks for the useful recipe :)

Really nice. The dough is so easy to work with that I re-rolled it a few times.  The flavour is nice, though I'd use lemon oil the next time, but that's just my preference.

My icing went on gorgeous but dried a bit 'spotty' with cloudy sections. Not sure what I've done wrong? FYI, the icing itself is delicious and dries beautifully, when it's not cloudy and spotty.

As is I give it a three. Just a little too loose even though I used gel instead of liquid food coloring. Cut down the liquid, add some almond extract and you got a perfect coating.

Great recipe, I had to add more milk to get it to the right consistency for dipping the cookies. I also substituted agave nectar for the corn syrup. It was perfectly fine and tastes great with the rolled sugar cookies!

This turned out very well in the end for me, but it was a toss up in the beginning whether it actually would or not. I ended up needing generous amounts of additional liquid to get it even to mix together. As directed, I kept adding corn syrup rather than more milk. It did end up very glossy and dried nice and firm.

Very easy to make, and loved how I could just brush on the icing. The icing hardened up, so I was able to stack the cookies and store them away.

Used with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" and everyone loved them.  Even the "office bake" asked for the recipe.

This was great icing, it did clump up while I was stirring in the sugar, but I just added a tsp more of milk and it was perfect.  Very easy and I love the glossy finish.

Wonderful!  Easy to tint and easy to work with.  I used a spoon instead of a brush and it was just fine.  I love the glossy look and the way the icing stays put on the cookie!

If you like a hard shiny icing, this is perfect! We used it for a cookie decorating party and it was great so the kids could stack their cookies to take them home and it didn't mess up their artwork!!

It tasted fine, but wasn't easy to use. The icing ended up very thick, I had to thin it out a lot to get it to a usable consistency. Even then, I don't see how people could "paint" with it. I was still gloppy and messy, even after adding a LOT of extra liquid.

This is my go-to holiday cut out icing now. Sometimes it can be tricky to get the right consistency - making a larger batch to begin with is easier than a small batch. Sets up beautifully and allows you to stack cookies for storage without damaging decoration. Good flavor too, though definitely an icing - this is not frosting.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I've tried a few recipes in the past, but have never had great success.  This one works so well!  I didn't try it with coloring--the kids wanted white icing.  It was the perfect consistency.  I did need to thin it out a little; instead of using more syrup though, I used a little more milk.

The amounts don't make a lot of frosting, so I had to double it for frosting cookies. I divided up the white frosting into small glass bowls and added food coloring to make various colors. Fun! But I will say - set aside some time to decorate the cookies. Takes about 30 minutes to fully dry before they are stackable. People like the almond taste!

Wonderful recipe! We adjusted it to 3 teaspoons of milk and 3 teaspoons of light corn syrup to start with, then after mixing had to add a bit more milk to some of them (we mixed all the colors separately). Make it thicker if you want to drizzle it on, wetter if you want to paint it on with a brush like a glaze.

I, too, must have missed something or just didn't take the time to play around with it like others did (silly me for thinking a recipe shouldn't need major adjustments!).    I'm a pretty experienced cook as well as my DH who has taken many cooking/baking classes and is amazing in the kitchen. Neither of us could make anything edible out of this.   There is NO way that small amount of milk mixed with that much confectioners sugar gets "smooth".  It never even came close so we added more milk (which I see many others had to as well) and when we finally got a "smooth" consistency (about 4 tbsp minimum) we added the corn syrup and almond extract.  I went with a different recipe.

Excellent recipe. I have used this many times. I rate it 4 instead of 5, because I recommend sifting the sugar first and using light cream instead of milk (tastes better).

Hard to argue with the slew of glowing reviews and gorgeous cookie photographs on this recipe! I made this icing exactly as written and used it for base color on Christmas cookies, and as they dried (quick, shiny, glossy, beautiful!), I painted additional colors on, as well as piped the thick "Butter Icing for Sugar Cookies" recipe on in delicious sugary decoration. Verdict? Well, all that remains is crumbs.

I've been looking for the perfect icing for my Christmas Cookies and used this recipe for the first time last year for my family cookie boxes that I ship.  The feedback was surprising.  The sugar cookies with this icing were the RAVE!   Also, I use Lemon Extract instead of Almond to give the icing a bit of zing!!!

I love this recipe because it hardens quickly (and completely) and it tastes good too.  I've used clear vanilla as well as lemon extract to flavor it. You may have to adjust the amount of milk you use, depending on you thick you want it, but if it gets to thick, try warming it.   You can buy cookie icing and it's so expensive. This tastes better and it works well.    I put the icing in a squeeze bottle and warm it up in the microwave.  It's so easy to work with.

Thank you for this recipe!! It was easy to use and my girls loved decorating sugar cookie pumpkins for Thanksgiving. I added extra milk and corn syrup but it was no biggie. Just added until consistency looked right to me.

Using the comments for others, this is an easy and awesome recipe! As is, not so much because adding more corn syrup makes the icing too sticky so that it never hardens so using milk instead to get a thinner consistency is better. I had a lot of fun decorating cookies with this and it tastes great with lemon extract!

Great sugar cookie icing. Used a little more milk and a little more corn syrup. Used my kitchenaid mixer to mix it all up. Worked really nice. Used a baby spoon to spread icing on cookie. Thanks for a nice recipe :)

Fantastic cookie icing!  I used vanilla instead of almond extract because of my little boy's allergies.  And I added an extra tsp of milk to make the icing thinner.  It worked great to ice the cookies with color flow technique.  The cookies were beautiful and tasted great.  I got lots of compliments!

A great recipe.  Hardens up quite nicely and holds color well.  I prefer icing recipes that don't use eggs white due to the smell, so this one is nice.

2 tsp of milk was way too little, I ended up mixing in 3 additional tsp.  This was definitely an easy icing, just adjust the amounts for the consistency you want. I didn't have almond extract (and don't like it, anyway) so I just used vanilla.  This is my first time making this, and it definitely tastes bad while it's still wet. After it dries on the cookie, though, it's very good. My cookies became cloudy the day after, though I'm not sure whether it's because I'm new to this and didn't mix it thoroughly enough, or just something in the recipe.

This turned out really well.  I used vanilla extract instead of the almond, and added an additional 1-2 tsps milk while frosting the cookies as it did get a bit thick.  Before completely drying, I had added some colored sugars to make them even fancier!

Taste wise this recipe is 5 stars..Getting the texture right was frustrating for me. I have made icing for cakes and cookies before so I'm not 100 percent novice when it comes to icing but this was difficult for me.

I used this icing on "the best rolled sugar cookie" recipe.  It was easy to make, dried quickly, stayed shiny and the colors did stay nice and bright.  I used 1/2 tsp lemon extract to flavor.  I will use this again for sugar cookies.

This is a great base recipe and the only one I will use for icing sugar cookies. It is super easy in adapting to your liking (add more confectioners' sugar for piping thicker icing, add more milk/corn syrup for flooding and thinning). I hate the taste of royal icing (blech) and have found that this is an excellent substitute for decorating detailed sugar cookies. I use vanilla extract instead of almond and pair it with “The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies” recipe from this site!

I wanted an icing that would dry nicely and stay shiny, like the kind you find in bakeries. This recipe did the trick! I frosted cut-outs to look like baseballs for my daughter's t-ball team. They looked so professional and the kids were thrilled! This icing was easy to work with. I wrote the kids' names and numbers on the cookies and the icing stayed right where I put it and didn't bleed. I've had that problem before with other recipes. Note: For those of you who don't like almond flavoring, be sure to use a clear vanilla if you are substituting. Otherwise you will not get a bright white icing, which is exactly what I needed for my baseballs.

Perfect icing.  It was very easy to prepare and separate into small bowls to add different colors.  You just have to stir for a few minutes before it is ready.  Used on "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" from this site.

Nice and easy but mine did not keep it's sheen, after a hour the icing was dry but dull. It covered a lot of cookies.  I used gel food color maybe this is why they were dull.??????

Love this!  I used it at Christmas and Valentines day.  One group like it with almond and the others liked it with vanilla.  Really pretty when it dries and keeps the shine.  I've always had to add more milk to make it the right consistency. Can spread with a spoon, use a brush, or a knife/spatula.  Works great!

This recipe is wonderful on sugar cookies. However, I have played around with it and can't get the perfect consistency for piping.  It always seems to run, taking away from the intricate details I am trying to accomplish.  The solution I have found is to use this icing to give my "background color" on the cookies and then make Decorator Frosting (also from this site) to pipe on details.  The two together give me exactly the look I am going for!

I only gave 4 stars b/c the flavor is very delish; however, there's just no way that I can get the liquid amounts to get to desired consistency. I had to add at least 1 tsp of additional milk. This was my 2nd batch, the first I ended up mixing everythign together at once and it only worked b/c I added water at the end to get it to liquify a little. The 2nd batch I followed one advice by putting milk in bowl & slowly adding sugar. It def helped but not enough. So I would recommend 3 tsp of milk at a minimum. It's a beautiful finish. I will def keep this recipe w/ modifications. :)

I guess I should have read some reviews before making this frosting.  The picture looks so pretty, that I just followed the directions.  Mine was thick and hard to spread, next time I will add the extra milk and see if that helps.  It did dry shiny, but my cookies looked nothing like the picture.  I had such a little amount of frosting I do not know how you would divide into bowls and color them.  I went wrong somewhere and just did not have the time to re-try.  Maybe for Valentine's Day.

As other said, liquid amounts can't be right. Tried adding more syrup/milk to get it to a useable consistiency and it was just to hard to work with and tasted way too sweet on the cookies.

As written, the liquid amounts are off, as many other reviewers noted as well.  But, once you play around with the amounts, it turns out just as promised.  Hence, the reason I'm giving this 5 stars.  The almond extract was okay, but I'm going to take the recommendations of others who suggested lemon, orange, or peppermint extract.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I had to add more milk and corn syrup to make it not goopy enough to put on the cookies.  Once I did that, it turned out great.  I added peppermint flavoring rather than almond, and I really liked it this way.

Doing my holiday baking I was looking for a new icing recipe.  There is NO WAY that this icing can get creamy without adding much more milk and corn syrup.  Triple the milk and double the corn syrup, blend and then it is ready for "painting" or dipping on cookies.  I noticed if you add too much milk it takes much longer for icing to set.

This was a good sugar cookie icing to work with. I tried one before it dried (I'm super impatient) and it tasted weird but once it dried, the flavor was ok. I don't like almond extract so I used vanilla so that could be why. I'm going to try peppermint or lemon next time. Thanks!

Good base recipe.  You'll need to adjust for the consistency you want.  The kids loved painting the cookies but my husband didn't care for the almond flavor.  Will try vanilla next time.

as others have noted, some adjustments need to be made to get the right consistency. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Very nice icing. We tried adding lemon juice and it was wonderful! We also tried peppermint and that, too was good. Vanilla is bland. Highly recommend flavoring it.  I will use this again!

This recipe is great for someone new to baking.  I made three different colors of icing and they were just beautiful, they were very shiny and very vibrant.  It was easy for even a novice like me to get the right consistency by adding a little more milk to the mixture.  I used soy milk and the icing set up with out a problem.

Great recipe. Used 3 teaspoons (that's 1 Tablespoon) of milk instead of 2, and used vanilla instead of almond extract. Edit: After about 12 hours, the cookies started getting light-colored spots on them. By two days, they were all blotchy. I'll try Royal icing next time instead to see if that's any better.

Love the way it is hard and glossy after it dries.  Proportions of recipe are way off though.  I needed about a tablespoon of milk and corn syrup to get a frosting consistency.

This is a pretty good recipe, and the only reason I´m giving it 4 stars is because it takes a really long time to dry. About 7 hours. I think you should make a note of it in the info, because I was making them for a party and the icing never hardened, so I couldn´t pack them without making a mess. Still, I would make this again, the day before my event now that I know how it works.

I also needed to add more milk (not corn syrup - they won't dry properly) My sugar cookies turned out just perfect. I didn't add any almond or vanilla extract.

AWESOME! I did have to add extra milk, but otherwise it is perfect. I added a little extra almond extract and it made my cookies have a wonderful almond taste -- definitely recommended.

I gave this five stars, but I started with 2 Tablespoons of milk, then followed the rest of the directions. It seemed to be much easier to mix up. You can always add more powdered sugar. I always sift it so there are no lumps.

This is the best icing!! I used it plain white to decorate my gingerbread, and it turned out GREAT! The outside set quite quickly, (while we were still decorating the other gingerbread,) but still stayed soft on the inside for four days sitting out uncovered. I did have to add more milk because it was too dry at first, and changed it to vanilla extract instead of almond because my boyfriend prefers vanilla. I will definitely use this recipe again. And again. And again! ;)

This recipe is amazing, but definitely additional milk is necessary. Just add 1 teaspoon at a time until it reaches desired consistency.  Other than that it tastes great and looks amazing once it's set.

Great Recipe!  The part I liked most about this, besides the glossy finish which is hard to achieve with other recipes, and the fast drying icing, was the size of the recipe as posted here, is the perfect size for multiple batches in different colors.  You won't end up with too much icing in one color.  I used lemon extract instead of vanilla -- and can't recommend this. I stopped the lemon after 1 batch; it was way too strong. At this point I was out of vanilla extract so actually did not add any extract to the rest of the batches and it was still great.  Now, if someone can just tell me how to do the creative icing part with eyes and words without making the character look very silly, I am all set!

I have tried MANY different icings/glazes for cookies and cakes. This one is perfect! I used vanilla extract rather than the almond, and had to add more milk, still it came out perfect. Also, I loved the glossy look and it dried quickly. THANK YOU!

absolutely delcious, gave off a pretty shine, but took around 4-5 hours to dry completely (i.e. after 5 hours it was ok to stack cookies without sticking).

I'm sure this recipe works for others, but I couldn't get it to work for me.  Maybe it's my decorating skills that aren't up to par, but I'm going back to my recipe with butter in it.

Super great.  My whole family agreed that this was the best icing that they had had.  So easy to work with.  After awhile it gets a little thick but a tiny bit of milk or karo syrup brought it back to perfection.  My cookies looked super shiny and tasted awesome.

This icing was very pretty but did not taste good at all.  I tried the vanilla which was better but the almond was just bad.  The icing was way to sweet and had a wierd taste to it.  I thought it would taste different when I put it on the cookies but nope it was still bad.  I do admit it was very easy to work with however I am looking for good taste and looks and this just was not for me.

I almost gave it 4 stars, just because I'm not sure how the amount of milk would ever be enough.  I added an extra teaspoon.  That being said....this sets up great, and made for pretty cookies.  I love the hint of almond extract.  I will definitely be using this recipe again....just with extra milk!

Perfection!  Easy and delicious.  Use a little milk to make the icing thinner - works better than the corn syrup.

I have been looking for the perfect icing recipe, and this is IT!  I have never gotten just the right consistancy, but going with some of the reviews, I found using 3 tsp. milk, and 3 tsps. cornsyrup was just right!  This is a keeper! Thank you.

This is by far the best sugar cookie icing I have ever used! I did double the milk and replace the almond flavoring with vanilla. I also used the back of a spoon to ice the cookies; it was much easier with the spoon. Everyone wanted the recipe! This is a keeper!

So easy and it tastes as good as it looks. This dries to a beautiful glossy finish and is fool-proof! Used this on Valentine cookies and again on shamrock cookies yesterday. The shamrocks went to a bake sale today and many comments were made about the gorgeous icing. Just make the recipe as directed and then it doesn't seem to matter how much more confectioner's sugar or milk you add to get the consistency you like, it still turns out lovely. I used 1/2 tsp. vanilla instead of the almond extract. Thanks for posting the perfect cookie icing!

Awesome! I make this whenever i make sugar cookies (i use the 'best sugar cookies' recipe) It always turns out great! You can spread, drizzle, paint, or do just about anything with this icing. I like adding coloured sugars and sprinkles. Tip: if your icing dries too quickly and you still want to add sprinkles, just hold the iced cookie over a bow or mug of steaming hot water for  a few seconds until it softens back up then decorate as you planned.

This recipe is very easy, and comes out great for sugar cookies. Dries fast, and looks very nice. I have used it many times...I gave it 4 stars because even though it looks great and is easy to work with- it doesn't always taste great....

I make sugar cookies for almost every occassion. This is the only icing recipe I use. I always add more milk, until it's pretty smooth. You can paint this on, and not see any paint strokes at all. It all smooths out, dries hard, and is beautiful! The *best* icing recipe by far!

I substituted the milk with water, because I didn't like the idea of keeping milk at room temperature for days. The recipe still worked great--I even used pancake syrup instead of corn syrup (because the supermarket was sold out). Just play with the amount of sugar to achieve the desired consistency.

This is a good recipe but as others have mentioned, the measurements are way off. For me, I put in 6 tsp of milk with the sugar and then mixed until smooth. Then I added the 2 tsp corn syrup. I nixed the extract. I tried peppermint extract in the first batch but it tasted like eating toothpaste, so the next batch, I just didn't add any extract. Next time I might add vanilla. The icing dries nice and smooth on the cookie. With 2 batches of icing, I had enough to decorate about 64 sugar cookies.

I "times-ed" this by 6, I think, and absolutely had to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk because it was sludge!  Delicious, pretty icing!

These were a huge hit at my job's chritmas party, as well as at home with the kids! I used this icing on the "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe from this site... worked great together.

I had a bit of a problem getting he icing the right consistancy. I also reccommend using vanilla extract. I'm not fond of the almond extract flavor. It does dry hard, but it was difficult to spread. You have to add a lot more corn syrup then stated.

Very good recipe.  I did have to add almost double the amount of corn syrup to get a smooth consistency, but otherwise it was perfect.  It dries hard and shiny, just like the icing on expensive store-bought decorated sugar cookies!

As others suggested, I increase the milk gradually, then I increased the light corn syrup. I use 1 tsp. vanilla extract. After you are done icing the cookies, place them in the refridge for several minutes so that the icing dries faster (then you can stack the cookies).

I doubled the recipe and only needed to add a fifth teaspoon to the mixing.  (Doubling calls for 4 tsps, hence the 5th).  From there when the mix was still too thick to stir and apply, I added teaspoons of the corn syrup and that did the trick.  Hardens to a glossy, smooth finish.  No need to work out wrinkles in the applications, it sets smooth and perfect.

Great flavor, but I had to add quite a bit more of both milk and corn syrup to get an "icing" texture rather than a very stiff frosting.  I made two batches (it doesn't make much) - the first time I followed the recipe directions and struggled to mix the stiff concoction.  The second time, I started with the milk and added the conf. sugar a heaping tablespoon at a time until too stiff, then added the corn syrup to get the right texture (and then the almond).

Thank you so much for this easy recipe.  I had a kids christmas party today and I did sugar cookie decorating as a craft for them using this icing.  The icing was perfect, easy to paint on with pastry brushes, and stayed glossy after.  Beautiful!  They had such a blast and were so proud of their creations.  Thanks again!

Absolutely fabulous!!!  I colored my icing and had the different colors in pastry bags and with a tip #5 (which could vary depending on how big the cookie is) I piped the icing onto each cookie...as long as your consistency is  tacky-like, you can pipe just near the edges without it overflowing down the sides.  Produces very professional looking cut-outs.  You do need a good few hours for it to set up enough to stack cookies.

Excellent and very tasty, I did add extra milk and powdered sugar to get the consistency that I desired.  I also used lemon extract too, I used this on the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site.  My girls and I iced the cookies on Thanksgiving morning while we watched the parade.  I plan on making this a Thanksgiving Day tradition using this icing recipe.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I added an extra teaspoon of milk and corn syrup to get the ideal spreading/drizzling consistency, and I think next time I'd just add milk, not corn syrup, so it sets up a little better. But the cookies looked fantastic and I love the way the icing levels out on its own and looks glossy and bright. A very easy way to get professional looking cookies!

Used this recipe on 1/2 of my Halloween cookies.  It was easy to make and use although I did need to add more milk and corn syrup than the recipe calls for.  The icing looks great and dries shiny at first, the next day they still looked great but weren't shiny (it may have been the balance of milk and corn syrup in mine)  On the cookie it tastes good, but out of the bowl it tastes like pure sugar.  Overall it's a good icing that looks great and is easy to make but I liked the taste and consistency of the other sugar cookie frosting better, although it doesn't look quite as polished.

I would highly recommend this recipe for professional looking decorated cookies!  The icing dries enough to stack them easily, but it's not rock hard like some. When adjusting for consistency, I increase the milk only.  I've learned that adding more corn syrup makes it gooey and it won't dry.  Also, it's important to note that, if you're adding sprinkles or other decorations that you want to stick to the cookies, you should add after icing a few cookies at a time because the icing dries very quickly.  If you wait until you've iced the whole batch, your sprinkles will just slide right off.  My only change is to use vanilla instead of almond extract. This is the only icing I use, and I'm the designated cookie mom for all my kids' class parties. Perfect Recipe!

This icing works marvelously; I took the almond extract out because I hate the flavour, and just replaced it with water. works great, hardens great, colours great, tastes great.

Thanks this is a keeper.

What a great recipe! This will be my primary cookie icing recipe from now on. The frosting finishes smooth and glossy, and the flavor is great. When fully dried, the frosting is durable enough to stack and not worry about, but it won't break your teeth when you bite into it, either....it's surprisingly soft in texture to eat. I used liquid food coloring in my last batch and it turned out just right and not runny at all. The colors were vivid and beautiful, and were easily mixed into the frosting. For professional-looking (and tasting) cookies, use this recipe. Experiment with different extracts and flavorings, such as berry and mint, as well. Perfect!

Fantastic recipe!!! My daughter wanted sugar cookies as the favors for guests at her recent wedding reception.  I wanted an icing recipe that had a glossy look like those you see in bakeries and came to Allrecipes hoping to find one.  This exceeded my expectations.  Delicious and so easy!!! My sister who is a semi-professional cake maker helped me decorate the cookies and now she is sold on this recipe.  Thank you so much!!!

You know I have to give it up to this website, it's a great way to get anyone into cooking.  This icing was exactly what I was looking for.  I loved iced oatmeal cookies and this was the icing to use.  I did alter this recipe, I added 4 tea. of milk (not 2 teas), I added 1/4 teas. more corn syrup to the recipe.  It spread so easily and the consistency was perfect.  No need to find any other icing recipe.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!

Like everyone has already said, the recipe calls for more milk, but overall it gave my cookies an awesome look. I used a fine paint brush to decorate them and the consistency stayed the same throughout the whole decorating process, which took me about an hour and a half. Love this recipe ohh and the vanilla extract is much better :D

Love how it stays shiny and sets firmly. But didn't really like the taste the almond extract gave it. I ended up adding vanilla extract to try to tone it down!

Tasty! I made two batches, one with milk, the other substituting water for milk (for kids in my son's class with milk allergies) and both worked just great. And I used regular vanilla with lots of red food coloring to cover the brown.Worked no problems!

I really liked this icing.  I had to add more milk and corn syrup as it was a bit thick for easy use at first, but once I got that consistency right, it spread easily.  It hardens nicely so you can layer the cookies without messing up the design and it tastes really good. I'm not so great at cookie decorating but this recipe made it easier.  I just bought the decorating pens and after it had hardened a little I was able to paint on elaborate snowmen and Christmas scenery and it stayed beautifully.

The best icing I have ever used! I did have to add more milk and corn syrup, but the colors did stay bright and shiny. I used a spoon to spread the icing on the cookies, worked out well. Will ues again. Oh, used this recipe to ice the "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" from this site - fantastic.

This recipe is excellent for piping the cookies. I used 1c. confectionars sugar to 4 tsp of milk; and it worked very well. I used the icing on The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies, but I had to make the icing twice to cover all of my cookies. This is by far the best homemade icing that I have ever made!!!

This is a really great recipe. :) I agree with other reviews and used vanilla extract instead of almond extract...but, other than that, this icing lived up to its description. It did dry very nicely and was very easy to make. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I just used this recipe and loved it. I've never been a fan of almond, though, so I did replace it with lemon extract, and it tastes great! For my batch of cookies, I had to triple the recipe and still ran out. But it's beautiful and delicious. :)

This icing is amazing! You can really do whatever you want with it. You can make it thick or thin to ice or decorate, you can change up the flavors, and make the color as light or dark as you want. There is so much control here. It tastes great, looks great, and is all around wonderful!

Easy and great.  I however must have done something wrong because it came out too thick and lumpy.  But, I just added a little more corn syrup to get it perfect and it was great.  My kids loved it so much I had to promise to make them Halloween cookies for school with the same icing.  I will ALWAYS use this on my sugar cookies from now on.  Thanks.

Yummy!  With a little food coloring, the icing dries beautifully. 

Next time I'll add more milk and syrup as others had suggested.  As is, it was difficult to work with.  

Overall the icing is great!  No one touched the cookies without the yummy icing.

This recipe had a great taste. I have used it twice to ice cookies. You must follow the directions explicitly. One time I made the icing it did not get as hard as the previous time. Follow teh directions and you will not be disapointed. Everyone commented on how good the icing was. And how shiny too!

I followed the recipe except I used 1 tsp. extract for each batch of icing (5 batches-5 different colors) My 10 year old niece and I had a ball adding different extracts to the seperate icing colors. We did lemon, orange, vanilla, coconut, and almond. When the icing is dry it's a good idea to keep them from humidity. DH absentmindedly placed a wet kitchen towel over a couple of them and the icing turned into a sticky mess. It does take awhile for the first layer of icing to dry enough to put a seperate color onto it without problems. We waited almost 2 hours to put different colors on top! Will make again. P.S. We decorated round cookies with the facial expressions of emoticons. [:),:o,:/,:x,:p,ect]. Niece called them AIM Cookies.

Here's a suggestion: use lemon extract rather than almond. While the almond is good, lemon is zingy and flavorful. Like other reviewers, I had to add extra milk (about 1T) and corn syrup to get the proper consistency, but it's pretty and easy to work with. We paint on the icing to get the best look.

This is the only icing recipe that has turned out exactly the way I pictured it!! I gave it a rating of 4 stars instead of 5 because I did end up having to add a bit more milk to get it just right, but otherwise I'm very pleased and will used this again!

This turned out very stiff. I had to keep adding equal parts of milk and corn syrup, and ended up tripling the amounts of those ingredients to make it workable. Getting to that point was tedious and time consuming.

The taste is good, and I like the shiny glaze. I'd lost a recipe that called for corn syrup, so I was happy to find this. 

I'll make it again, tripling the milk and corn syrup. The almond extract amount was fine.

The best icing recipe ever! I took the advice of another review and used peppermint and it was oh so YUMMY. I do suggest you use less peppermint and just add to taste because it was a bit overpowering.

Great!  I added a little melted butter for flavor and to thin it out a little.  I did not have almond extract, so I used a little vanilla.  I suck at making frosting, but this turned out great!  It did not dry out as others have stated, but this coud be due to the butter.  It also took longer than expected to set up.  From the reviwes it sounded like it was super fast.  All areound great recipe!

This recipe definitely needs to be adjusted. 2 teaspoons of milk was not nearly enough - I probably used close to 2 tablespoons. I also used a little more corn syrup than called for until the consistency was thin enough to spread with a knife. Once I got it right, I added green food coloring and used a knife to drizzle it over the cookies. It was prettier than I expected and hardened up nicely.

I had to give it a 4 because the recipe HAS to be adjusted. 2 TBS of milk instead of tsp, and it is a great icing. Your cookies will be sweet, but oh so pretty! One problem- I stacked mine after they dries, and the cookies stuck-won't do that again!

This icing is awesome!  Adjust both teaspoon measures to tablespoon measures.  I piped mine onto the cookies with a #2 tip, then spread it around with a knife.  My kids then used sprinkles, and they look beautiful!

Although the taste is good- the measurements on this recipe are very wrong.  Definitely change the tsp to TBSP and you should be allset.  A good basic icing.

WOW! I LOVE this icing! I used a squeeze bottle to decorate my sugar cookies with the icing and made a thicker consistency for the details that went on top. Everyone said the cookies were the best they had EVER tasted. I think it's because of the almond flavoring. I won't ever use another sugar cookie icing recipe! EVER!

This icing served its purpose well but I did have to add 2 tbs. of milk to the final product like other reviewers because it was waaay to thick. My 4 yr. old and I used it to "paint" Fourth of July cookies (White Velvet Cutouts from this site) and the colors came out beautiful and shiny. Thanxs for a fun recipe!

This recipe did not disappoint.  My valentine cookies were bright red with a shiny gloss! They defnitely looked store-bought.  The taste was also wonderful.  I may try the other tips left by others to try 1/4 t of lemon, vanilla and almond....but truthfully, the recipe was wonderful "as-is"

This icing is perfect!  It turns out hard and shiny, just like the ones in the pictures do!  Don't be put off by the thickness of it, give it a few whips every 5 minutes to keep it moist, this is how good icing should be!

Although the icing eventually did dry very shiny the milk quantity is off. Might need to be 2 Tablespoons not tsp. Only for that reason is it rated at 3 stars. Recipes should be submitted correctly.

I LIKE THIS RECIPE BECAUSE THE COLORS STAY BRIGHT.  HOWEVER,  YOU HAVE TO PLAY WITH IT TO GET THE RIGHT CONSISTANCY.  I MIXED THE 1 CUP 10X SUGAR AND 4 TSP MILK UNTIL BLENDED.  I LET IT SIT FOR 2 MINUTES (CHECKING ON THE KIDS) CAME BACK AND ADDED 1/4 TSP EXTRACT (I USE  PURE ANISE) AND BLENDED.  THEN I ADDED 1 TBSP LIGHT CORN SYRUP AND MIXED THOROUGHLY.  LAST I ADDED THE COLORING.  DRIED WITHIN A FEW MINUTES.  IF YOU WANT YOUR COOKIES TO LOOK LIKE THE PHOTO TAKE A BAKING/ART CLASS!:)

This recipe works well enough by adding more corn syrup or milk AND by putting the container of icing in a larger container with very warm tap water.

I tried this icing a second time and had to revise my previous review. The first time I made this, I did not add enough corn syrup and the icing hardened before it could be spread on cookies. This time, I was very generous with the corn syrup it turned out really well! I made it with kids who insisted that it looked like shiny bakery icing!

I like this icing on my tea cookies that I make.  My icing doesn't get as shiny as I thought it would be.  I also added more milk and extra almond flavor because it tasted too much powdered sugar.

This icing was perfect - dried to a beautiful firm finish.  I never made this type of cookie icing before and was amazed how easy it was to make and use! I followed others' suggestions and doubled the milk and added a dab more corn syrup and used vanilla instead of almond extract.  Of course its sweet, its sugar with a little liquid added!  
P.S.  They DO take awhile to harden.

I too made this icing for "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies"  It reminded me a lot of the ever so famous "Smiley Cookie"!!  VERY GOOD!!!  The cookies do have to be COMPLETELY cool, slightest bit of warmth will make icing runny!  I followed the recipe to the T!  My daughter LOVED decorating with this icing!  Would make an excellent school project, icing will be hard for transport home!!!!!

After reading these reviews I was nervous, so taking them all into account, I put 3 cups of confectioner's sugar in my kitchen aid bowl and added enough milk to blend to smooth.  I added a few globs on cornsyrup until it looked glossy.  Perfect.  I think the trick is getting enough milk to get the lumps out of the sugar first.

And now we don't have to wait for someone to send us a c**kie bouquet! We found it a little bit too stiff, so added an extra tsp of milk. Couple this up with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" elsewhere on this site and you'll fall in love!

The icing turned out wonderful even though I did have to add a little extra corn syrup and milk.  I took dinosaur shaped sugar cookies to my son's preschool class as they were talking about dinosaurs that week and the teachers raved about the wonderful icing and asked for the recipe.  They do dry so nice and shiny!  Loved it!

Very good!  Loved how shinny the cookies were and it spread so nice!!!  I did have to use more milk though- it wouldn't even turn into a paste for me until I added more milk.  We also used Vanilla extract instead of Almond.  YUM YUM!!!!

This was the kind of icing I have been looking for.  It does dry enough so you can stack them and not worry about getting the icing all over.  I will use this recipe from now on. Colors and shine are great too!

THIS WAS AWESOME ON OUR HALLOWEEN COOKIES! THE COLORS ARE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.  I TOO HAD TO ADD A LITTLE MORE MILK AND CORN SYRUP, BUT IT WAS VERY EASY TO MAKE, AND VERY EASY TO WORK WITH. INSTEAD OF ALMOND I USED VANILLA.  THANKS!

This was an excellent frosting. Cookies were bright and shiny.  The icing dried hard and made it easy to stack cookies.  I did have to add a little extra milk though and I used vanilla instead of almond extract. Good flavor.  Made with Delilah's Frosted Cut-Out Sugar Cookies.  Great combo.

I have been searching for a great sugar cookie icing for the longest time!!  I loved this recipe.  I will use this always!!  I used vanilla instead of almond since I didn't have any almond and it was delicious!!  I had to add a bit more milk since I couldn't get it smooth with 2 tsp.

This recipe is extremely easy to make.  I had to add another teaspoon of corn syrup and added an extra teaspoon of milk, and it made a great consistency.  The colors are vibrant and the icing stiffens really well.

Easy, and shiny, hard finish without using egg whites or other fussy ingredients. I used golden corn syrup, since I was adding colours anyway, and it was great.

An easy and quick substitute for royal icing.  Not caring for almond, we used vanilla as our flavoring. For precision decorating, this seemed to spread a lot more for fine lines and details than royal icing, so for some projects it will not work.  Many of the same decorating techniques carry over, though, and our cookies were cute. This recipe wins lots of points from me for being super quick to make and requiring simple ingredients.

This icing was exactly what I was looking for to decorate cookies for a wedding shower. Worked perfectly. I did have to thin it out with a little more milk than called for, but that wasn't an issue.

My grandgirl and I wanted to use the icing to squeeze out of squeeze bottles. This recipe was extremely thick. I had to use an another tsp of milk (one 1/4 tsp at a time) in order to thin it enough to use. But delicious flavor and hardened quickly. Loved it!

The proportions for this are way off.  I had to add water which worked out fine, It allowed me to make different consistencies for flooding and piping.  Didn't care for taste so I added juice of a half lemon (which many other recipes call for) *I did double recipe to start*,  added 1 tsp pure vanilla and 1/4 tsp pure almond extract and a pinch of salt to cut the sweet.   Can adjust flavoring..but I found we liked it w/more lemon, then vanilla and a touch of almond.  Do not use lemon flavoring. Use real lemon juice from a fresh squeezed lemon. (not even the one already squeezed from store, the real thing makes a huge difference).  I'd use this recipe again with these changes.  It worked out great.  Had a nice gloss, dried hard but not like royal icing , just hard w/ a nice bite.  I could stack w/out any damage, although I always use wax paper in between too.  Used it to make these pinterest cookies and really liked the glaze vs. royal icing.

I absolutely loved it! As is, this recipe made a lightly flavored sweet icing that was perfect for spreading. I also made a 2nd batch for more of a glaze or drizzle using : 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar, 2 TBSP milk, 2 TBSP light corn syrup, 1 tsp pure lemon extract, 13 drops yellow food coloring and a dash of salt. Thanks for the recipe!!

I don't understand how this recipe got so many good reviews.  The proportions are way off, you need almost double the milk to make it spreadable.  It taste like pure powdered sugar, way too sweet.  It does look pretty after you tweak it to get it spreadable but it does not taste good at all.  I just ruined half a batch of cut out cookies that I spent a couple hours baking. Also, if you try to stack them, the icing melts and they all stick together even if you put waxed paper between them.

I wanted to make those adorable melted snowman cookies. This icing worked well for that. You can certainly taste the almond extract which was a nice added flavor to the sugar cookie.

This was my first experience with icing sugar cookies :)  The recipe was very easy to make, and tasted good. It was a little hard to apply to the cookies (I didn't have a new, clean paint brush, so I used my pastry brush.) It did harden nicely, and I was able to stack my cookies. However, I think my house may have been too cold, because the glaze got some kind of white spots on some of them. I used vanilla extract instead of almond, lemon would be good, too.

I made these to top some sugar cookies and I loved how the icing hardened. I felt the taste could have been improved but the fact I finally found a sugar cookie icing that hardens yet stays pliable means this will be used again! Thank you.

Fantastic! I thinned it with milk, not syrup, working 1 tsp at a time until I got the consistency I wanted. Also, I didn't happen to have any corn syrup around, so I used golden syrup instead, and it worked just fine. I'm now tempted to try this with a little maple flavoring and maple syrup for maple cookies. 

One thing about this recipe, though - once you make it, use it immediately, it dries fast!

I am not a "baker" but this recipe was easy to follow, is (currently)drying nicely, and didn't take much time to make.  Use a mixer, don't try to do it by hand, and if you're using food coloring it's OK to use regular vanilla extract. 

I had to make over 100 cookies, so I used a pastry brush to apply the icing before I put sprinkles on.  I "quintupled" the recipe, and ended up with enough for nearly 8 dozen, not 5 dozen cookies that had opaque even icing.  No sugar grains in the texture, and with a mixer the color was even.  All in all, a great recipe.  I think this will be a classic at my house

My only hints?  You have to adjust the milk and corn syrup, almost double them, to make the icing spreadable.  I wouldn't advise using sugar crystals for decoration as they tend to melt into the icing if you apply when it's wet, or won't stick if you apply when it's dry.  No problems with regular sprinkles.  And it seems that it takes a while to dry with the corn syrup adjustment. But the color, texture, and taste is GREAT (I like sweet frosting on barely sweet cookies) and best of all, NO GRAINY SUGAR in the frosting.

I have been using this icing for several years and love it.  You can thin it with milk to make a glaze, or reduce the milk for piping. I use it with the Cream Cheese Sugar Cookie Recipe on this site, and makes cookies that look and taste like they came from a bakery.  Several request for the recipe, and it's so easy.

Consistency is smooth, looks awesome on the cookies (especially as a base-coat before adding details with, say, some buttercream), and the almond extract adds a nice touch on top of sugar cookies that can sometimes be bland.

love this recipe... I wish I would not have altered with the additional milk and corn syrup, they would have been shinier.  Made cookie bouquet centerpieces for my daughter's baby shower and guests thought that I purchased them!!! This was my first attempt, I can't wait for the next opportunity to use this with the sugar cookie recipe here!

I made some cookies for mother's day so my daughter could decorate them and give them to grandma as a gift. This icing was soooo good, except I didn't not like the almond taste at all, hence the 4 star rating, so I used clear vanilla extract instead and it was so good and so easy to make.

I am so impressed with this sugar cookie icing recipe. It was very easy to make and deal with, and it does dry nice and hard so you can stack them easily, but the icing is not hard enough to crunch when you bit into it. It is solid and smooth and just delicious. I took the advice of another reviewer and allowed the icing to set for several hours (overnight) before I stacked them, and they were perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

I had to tweak this a bit to get the consistency right.  Just added a little more milk as needed and kept the icing from drying out by covering the bowl with a damp kitchen towel.  When I first made the icing, I used the thicker version to pipe an outline with a Wilton round tip #4.  Then I thinned it out and spooned it in.  Used a toothpick to spread it out into all corners.  Let it dry thoroughly and then decorated.  The leftover icing had thickened a tad, which was good for piping on the details. This isn't the best icing for a lot of detail or writing names.  It spreads out slightly before drying.  Took hours to dry. Had to let the cookies set overnight before I could stack them.  I tried after 5 hours and they were still a little tacky.  Nice shine to them and the almond oil is delicious. That's what makes a tasty icing, in my opinion. I would use this again but the next time I will try one with merengue powder to see which I like best.

I kind of played with this recipe a little to get the icing to the right consistency, added a little more sugar to compensate for the food coloring and I also used vanilla extract instead of almond.

This icing is Phenomentabulous!  I had always used Royal for icing decorated cut-outs but didn't like that it was made with raw egg so when I found this recipe I crossed my fingers based on the reviews and WOW...the results are absolutely perfect.  The cookies set up with a nice shiny gloss and it is so easy to work with.  I used this recipe to decorate my St.Patrick shamrock cookies and my flower cookies for Easter and everyone thought they were from the bakery!   Thank you for another fabulous home-run recipe!!!

Really love this icing.  It is very reliable and easy to work with.  Once the cookies have been decorated, I put them in a cool dark pantry to set the icing befor putting them in a tin.  Works a treat!  The only thing I change is adding more liquid and adding 1 tsp flavouring, I.e. Vanilla, Rose, lemon zest etc., to give it a bit of pizazze!  Cookies look beautiful every time!

This recipe has seen me through a full year of holidays.  I live in a very humid area and have had problems with other sugar cookie icings not setting up properly.  This one is easy and flawless.  it has worked EVERY time with beautiful results.  It handles color evenly and dries shiny.  I make several small bowls at a time and that allows me to have different colors when I need them.  Love this recipe and use it all the time.

Love this icing. Perfect almond taste. Used 'soft Christmas cookie' recipe from this site. Had to use way more milk than the recipe called for, I couldn't tell you how much, I just poured. Maybe an eighth of a cup. An extra teaspoon of corn syrup too.

This icing not only looked great on my cookies, it tasted amazing too! I had a lot of compliments on it. I did not use them for sugar cookies though. I baked shortbread and decorated them with the icing and they were great.

Excellent recipe.  I added more milk until I got the desired consistency.  I applied the icing with a paintbrush. Used icing sugar to dust the cookies once painted.

I only gave this 4 stars because more milk was needed, I ended with a about 4 teaspoons instead of 2, adding only 1 teaspoon of milk at a time until it was a good icing consistency and I switched out the almond extract for vanilla because I dont care for the almond taste, otherwise it was a great recipe that dries hard and shiny

I didn't read the reviews before hand, and I wish I had. The amount needed of milk/corn syrup were way off...  I'm giving it a 4 only because now I know better and will use it again, but only as a starting point.

This was awesome! I've never made icing before and was a little worried, but it came out great! It was easy to spread, didn't dry too quickly so I didn't have to work fast, but once I was done they dried out just right! Definitely a keeper!

Dries hard and shiny. I had to add additional milk so that it wasn't the consistency of fondant. I used vanilla instead of almond extract because I was out...I'm sure I prefer the almond extract as the recipe requests. This will be the go to sugar cookie icing!

SO good! For ease of mixing, mix the extract and milk and then add in the powdered sugar. You may need a tiny bit more milk - it will be a smooth paste-like consistency. Then add the corn syrup and you are good to go! Liquid food coloring will thin it out quite a bit, but it thickens as it stands. If it gets too thick, just add a few drops more milk.

This Icing is fantastic.  Follow the directions to add the milk a tiny bit at a time. Patience is the key to good icing and this worked perfectly for me.

This stuff truly is like magic! My 11-year-old assembled the icing, and it was exactly as advertised - hard and not at all sticky after it dried, amazing. We really enjoyed icing cookies for Santa with this (and about 7lb of sprinkles, of course). One note: we did have to almost double the milk, so just see how yours acts before you put the milk away. Also, the almond flavor is VERY strong; next time I'll start with half the quantity, or just buy clear vanilla and use that instead. Already plotting Valentine's cookies using this icing!

I really like this icing for decorating. Its great for piping out decorations on cookies (i used it for gingerbread men). My suggestion is that the more you put on a cookie the longer it will take to dry. And sometimes I thought the icing was dry and I stacked the cookies and they ended up sticking together. Let them dry!

This icing was very simple to make and did a great job of coating my sugar cookies and keeping decorations/sprinkles on them. I didn't use food coloring so I can speak to how well it holds color, but it definitely did stay shiny as other reviewer's have stated. It is very sweet, though. Maybe next time I'll cut down the amount of corn syrup.

first time trying it and it was perfect.  it made more than enough for several dozen cookies, perhaps my cookies were smaller (less than 2")  we had to keep stirring it so it would stay loose.  Did half with almond extract and half with mint.

I loved this Icing.  The amounts of milk and corn syrup were off a bit, but with a little adjustment, they were perfect.  Great flavor, looked great.  They do dry quite quickly, so if you plan on sprinkling anything on the frosting, don't wait too long or it will just roll right off.  This IS a keeper.

This was our first time using this kind of glaze and it came out great.  I used Vanilla extract instead of almond only because we used vanilla in the cookies.  This frosting is very sweet but it works well with the blue ribbon sugar cookies on this site. Will definitely make again but will try the almond extract.

Really lovely icing recipe!  I was looking for one which would dry hard, and this one does, but it took an awfully long time-- almost 24 hours until they were stackable-- and that was a bit of a pain. 5 dozen cookies laid out flat takes up a lot of counter space, you know!!  :)  That said, in the end it did make a shiny, fantastic finish on the cookies, and I will definitely use again for special occasions.  I used this icing on the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site, and the combo is really tasty.

The only reason I didn't give this icing recipe 5 stars is because the quantity of milk was not enough to achieve the desired consistency - but this recipe is lovely aside from that! I honestly just eyeballed how much milk to add after I discovered that the recommended measure wasn't going to be enough. Used this on sugar cookies for Christmas and it was super easy to apply -I used mini spatulas and a pastry brush - but I want to try actual paint brushes b/c I think I could get some really nice detail going. Thanks for the great recipe!

Thank heaven I found this recipe.  It makes it so easy to put a smooth, professional-looking colorful layer of GOOD-TASTING icing on cookies.  I made it exactly as stated in the recipe and applied it with a new, clean broad-bristled artist paintbrush.  I used this icing for a solid, base color on the entire cookie, and then made some colored buttercream to pipe designs.  My Christmas cookies have never looked (and tasted!) so wonderful :-)

This frosting is just like the frosting my mom used to make ... I love how it dries on the cookie so they are stackable.  I think next time I will try lemon or vanilla extract since the almond flavor was a little strong for my taste, although the kids gobbled them up without complaint.  It is definitely a little more difficult to spread than a buttercream type frosting, especially for the kids, but the end result is worth the effort.

This icing was delicious and really beautiful, but I give it only 4 stars because it is extremely difficult to work with. I ended up using my fingers to spread this on my cookies because it is super thick.  On my second batch I added another 2 tsp of milk and it made it much easier to work with, even though it was less "glossier" than the first batch.

This frosting was perfect on my Christmas cookies. I took the advice of other reviewers and added a little extra milk/corn syrup. This recipe does not make very much so it's best to double or triple especially if you plan to make some different colors. I will definitely make this again and again.

I thought this icing was great.  I love how it dried and was very shiny so not only did it look pretty, I was able to stack them into gift boxes.  I thought it was very sweet but I made it with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie" recipe from this site which aren't as sweet as other recipes so the combination was great!

I struggled to get the right consistency with this recipe and never did get it quite right.  I also didn't think it had very good flavor, but then again it could have gotten messed up with me adjusting it so much when trying to get the consistency correct.  Sorry, but I found this recipe to be too difficult to work with.

This is a very bland tasting icing. The consistency was a little odd when tasted and the icing did not harden even after setting up over night. It didn't leave a fingerprint on top of the icing when touched but I brought 6 cookies into work stacked one on top of the other and the cookies all stuck together. This was after they had "dried" overnight. I would not recommend this recipe for any cookies that may be stacked.

I thought this was not a good flavor. Is there such a thing as bad confectioners sugar? It wasn't an old package but the taste was pretty awful. That and there is no way 2 tsps of milk was enough. Had to double to 4 to get any kind of liquid going. I'll give it two stars only because it did get hard but still looked wet. I added little designs to my chocolate covered sugar cookies. This alone on the cookie would not have been good.

I didn't like it at all... If I would have used vanilla extract instead of almond, I may have liked it. But what I made had a horrible flavor to it.

Excellent recipe. I had to add a little more liquid than stated in the recipe, but it is VERY dry where I live. Didn't use almond extrazct, I used vanilla instead (in case of nut allergies). Very shiny and dries hard and quick. The icing has a firm layer on top once it hardens and the icing underneath is soft. A keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

I really liked this icing recipe, it was easy to make although the amount of milk given I thought was not enough I added about 2-3 more teaspoons.  I used vanilla extract instead of almond and it still tasted great.

Fantastic icing recipe - used it with 'The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies' from AR which I have made a few times before.  I made ghost cut out cookies for my one of my son's classes.  I kept my icing simple due to lack of time.  I did need to add a bit more milk and the icing does need some time to dry before being able to stack the cookies (mine dried overnight).  Excellent, a repeat for sure :)

The BEST icing I've ever made!  This recipe is perfect for icing/decorating cookies!  The only problem is, I had to make this recipe 3 times to ice all the cookies I made with "the best sugar cookie" recipe!  This icing is very tasty and pairs perfectly with the above mentioned cookie recipe.  I made orange pumpkins with a green top and outlined the eyes, nose and mouth of a carved pumpkin.  The icing dries to a nice hard/shiny finish!  They dry quickly but not too quick as you have to worry about the icing drying out before you get your cookies iced.

This icing made my cookies look pretty, but the icing tasted horrible. 2 tsp of milk is not enough to make the sugar "smooth" so I had to add more corn syrup. The icing ended up tasting like straight corn syrup. It kinda tasted like paste. I ended up going back to my old powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla recipe.

Perfect! Easy to make, held color very well, and took longer to dry than royal icing so no mad rush to ice everything as quickly as possible! Dried perfectly and tasted great!
I did have to add some more of the ingredients listed to get the thick consistency that I was looking for, so be sure to have just a little extra of the ingredients on hand.

Perfect sugar cookie icing.  I like to add in almond flavoring but it's delicious with just vanilla as well.  I will experiment with other flavorings now too like orange or lemon, etc.  Dries hard and makes it easy to stack up cookies for a pretty presentation.

Such a great gluey icing to paint and design with! Even my preschool-aged kids were easily able to paint their cookies.  Like everyone else, I had to add more milk to get the consistency right.

I use this recipe all the time but I find I have to tweak the liquids to get it the right consistency.  I usually have to add a bit more milk and corn syrup.  It's easy for the kids to use to decorate our sugar cookies.  Our favourite sugar cookie recipe to use is "Soft Christmas Cookies" from allrecipes.  We use Wilton colours to make the colours intense.  The icing dries bright and shiny.  The effect is always stunning and they get rave reviews when we share our cookies with our friends.

Very good and easy cookie icing. I used vanilla instead of almond and it seemed a tad thin so I added another 1/4 cup of sugar. Had more than enough to decorate 12 cookies.

LOVE this recipe. I get compliments every time I use it. If you're familiar with Busken cookies it's a very similar taste. Use with The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie recipe for a winning combination!

Not much too add on top of +1000 reviews. So, short and to the point: I doubled the milk, and used vanilla extract (my family's not a huge fan of almond extract). Used to ice The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site. Everyone loved my Valentine's themed cookies, they looked good and tasted even better!

I loved the look of this and it wasn't too strong. When I colored the frosting, I ended up adding cinnamon to the red and lemon zest to the green & yellow. It gave it some unexpected flavor and some nice texture... especially when I made xmas tree cookies.

4 Stars...because I felt that recipe measurment were incorrect, I used other sugar cookie glaze to help me with this one because I preferred milk over water. When used with correct amount (measurement) it is awesome glaze. Not so sweet and it hardens perfectly and is easily stacked once it hardens.

The best cookie decorating frosting ever!  And it tastes good, too!  Colors stay vibrant and are easy to work with.  Like other reviewers I found I had to add an additional 2 tsp of milk.  Also used vanilla extract instead of almond but that's just a personal preference. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this icing to go on the recipe on here called "the best rolled sugar cookies" for christmas this year... the plate was cleared in no time.. and I can't tell you how many compliments I got on the flavor of the icing- I also thought it was better and "lighter" tasting than any other cut out cookie glaze i've tried. A keeper!

My first time decorating sugar cookies and they turned out great. I had a cookie party for some preschoolers and even they were able to make cute cookies with this. Just add milk/sugar to change the consitancy for flooding vs piping

Best icing ever; easy; was a little drippy, but we put the icing in sandwich bags with small tip cut off for the kids to decorate. Ended up putting some icing on a plate and my 5 yr dipped his cookies, 8yr used the bag. Read the recipe and just added more icing sugar to make thicker. Dried perfectly...Tasted great!

Oh man, this recipe helped me make the most gorgeous cookies!  I used this as a kind of glaze for sugar cookies, and completed the decorations with butter cream.  Everyone loved!

I made sugar cookies and used this icing. It was just what I was looking for. It dries hard. It was thick so I added a little milk to thin it a bit. I just wish I had a brush to put it on with. I ended up using the back of a spoon, but it still came out nice. It was shiny and with the sprinkles we added on top...they were pretty Christmas cookies.

Great recipe! Wwhat makes the cookies so gorgeous is the lovely sheen that comes out of the corn syrup!   Tips:   1) I would say though that the measurements are key-too little milk and it is way too sticky, too much milk, and the icing falls off the sides of the cookie.   2)If you are putting any sort of sprinkles or decorations, put them on immediately after icing each cookie, not after icing all of them; the dry time is super fast. Not sure where they came up with 6 hours, becuase they dried in under 10 mins and then it became difficult to put sprinkes on top.  3) I was not a fan of the almond extract. I tried vanilla extract on 1/2 the batch, that was great, or try lemon, like some others suggested.   Overall, great recipe, very professional looking and easy!

Ok. There is no way that you can stir 1 c of confectioners sugar with 2 t of milk "until smooth". That's just not enough liquid. I tried this twice, exactly as written, and it was a disaster both times. The first time I thought I misread something. Nope. Ended up just mixing powdered sugar with enough milk to make it the consistancy I wanted, and then added cream of tartar about a 1/4 t. at a time until there was enough to cut the sweet taste of the sugar. An old standby recipe from grandma that saved the day again!

Fabulous! Leaves a shinny, glossy look to the cookies and the almond extract really adds a nice touch. Easy to adjust depending if you want a thinner or thicker constancy.

I had to use 5 tsp. of milk and it was still thick but just what I needed.However, the combination of ingredients is just right and it seems to be setting up fine.

This is definitely my new go-to recipe for sugar cookie icing.  I love how well it sets up and shines.  I needed to put more powdered sugar in when trying to decorate in details (needed to, didn't bother, regretted it later)  You can really make cookies look amazing with this icing.

Quite simply the best.  Only thing to note is that I find it takes a bit more milk to get it to the right consistency.

I really loved this recipe. I did however add more milk 1/2 tsp at a time because it was to thick.  It ended up being more like 4 tsp rather than 2 tsp. I used it to make the melted snowman cookies and the frosting hardened really well.  Although the frosting is really sugary it makes for a beautiful glossy finish!!!  I will defiantly be using this one again and again!!

The perfect sugar cookie icing! I've always used a buttercream frosting and been disappointed with the results. It's difficult for a novice like myself to work with and it's far too heavy/rich for my tastes.  This icing is wonderful- it's thin and applies easily and results in a really nice, glossy finish. It doesn't set too quickly and leaves plenty of time for decorating. It sets nicely- it's firm enough that you can stack cookies on top of each other yet not so firm that it gets crunchy and changes the texture of the cookies.  You'll definitely have to manipulate the amount of milk/corn syrup used- 2 teaspoons of each is not nearly enough.

Used the water/sugar mixture suggested by another recipe user which worked but it should be noted not to try and make this in advance, it congeals quite quickly. The icing itself rocks, nice smooth finish.

Exactly what I wanted! Shiny, opaque finish, standard pantry ingredients (did not want buy meringue powder as some similar recipes required). We used it for rice-crispy "Santa houses", a toddler-friendly version of gingerbread houses (made house-shaped flat rice-crispy cakes,a bout 8x5", then decorate with candy). It looks great and acted as the perfect glue for the candy. I would make again for sugar and gingerbread cookies.

Debated a LONG time about using this or a royal icing. I'm thrilled I decided on this one! Like another reviewer, first time I have enjoyed decorating sugar cookies.  Mixed up smooth and stood up to two 8-years old and after baking all weekend - ONE frazzled mommy.  That makes it a keeper at this house!

Loved this icing! I used it last year to make some beautiful blue snowflake cookies and they looked like something from an upscale bakery. If you are looking to do detailed cookie decorating this is a great recipe. I tried frosting our Christmas cookies this year for a change and while they tasted good and were quite classic, they were not as pretty as the ones with this icing.

This icing is good if you make it right, biut the recipe is wrong.  2 teaspoons of milk leaves you with lumpy powdered sugar.  After reviewing other recipes I guessed that the author meant 2 TABLESPOONS milk; kept everything else the same and it worked out pretty well.

I tried this icing for the first time this past week.  One change I made was I used about 3 tsp. of water in place of the milk and used 1 tsp vanilla extract in place of almond.  I loved the shiny look it gave and the colors didn't bleed (my cookie "frosting" always did).  It was exactly what I wanted and even my boss at work made the comment "she could sell thesel".

The icing was good, the colors great (I couldn't find paste colors, so I used gel).  I needed to triple the recipe for 30 3" pumpkin shaped cookies.  Then I made another batch for the decorations on top of the base color.  Like what others said, you have to mess around with the milk/syrup combo to get the right consistency.  I made the mistake of making the cookies a few days ahead of time, thinking they'd be fine.  Turns out the brown facial expressions of the pumpkin cookies I piped on gradually "rusted."  It looked like it dried out, then one of them started leaking syrup! I didn't know if I mixed it right or if after time the syrup separates.  I was mortified! Though they still tasted good.  Sooo...if you're going to make them ahead of time, make sure it's only a day or two (not 5 like me!).

Doubled this recipe and definitely needed tweaking. Added quite a bit more milk and corn syrup than posted, impossible to work with that little amount of liquid! I realized well into the recipe I had no extracts of any kind! And since this was going to my son's daycare I opted aganist liquor! The flavor was a little off and I truly believe the extract would have delish!

Yum!! This was delicious and fun! The icing was easy to apply and dried hard (not too hard) and shiny! My sugar cookies looked like they came from a professional bakery! I did have to add about a teaspoon of extra corn syrup/milk for piping and about 2 extra teaspoons for flooding, but other than that, this recipe was perfect! So happy to have found a substitute for royal icing, as raw egg whites creep me out. Thanks!

I've been looking for a good sugar cookie recipe that's soft like my sisters who uses a 16oz bag of powdered sugar. This one hit the spot! Before I rolled them out I chilled them for a few hours to make them easier to roll and shape. I didn't put them in a ball and smush them like they say. They held their form very easily and were very easy to work with on a heavily floured surface, they didn't fall apart when I put them on the pan. I rolled them out to half of a centimeter or a little less.  They baked for 9 minutes, once you can see the tan on the edges, they're already overcooked. I used "Soft Sugar Cookies IV" by Laura Stearns. They came out like store bought sugar cookies, except better! Delectable! The Icing has a slightly hard texture once it sits kind of like a thick glaze. I had to had quite a bit of water to it, like 2 tablespoons, cause it was sooo dry. It was perfect. The almond flavoring sets off the vanilla flavoring in the cookies brilliantly. This is my go to sugar cookie recipe from now on.

There is nothing special about this frosting. I personally do not like the flavor as the powdered sugar gives it a funky taste. However, the kids love it and it does work really well for sugar cookies.

I'd never made cookie icing before and this was really easy.  I made 5 batches at once and it turned out great.  I sifted the powdered sugar to be sure I didn't have any lumps in it.  When I colored it I ended up with DAYGLO colors but it was because I added too much color.  I'm still used to tinting frosting.  When it dried it was beautiful and tasted great!  Some I dipped and some I used a piping bag and squiggled lines on the cookies.  This is versitile icing for sure!

This is my go-to recipe for icing sugar cookies. I've used it for weddings, birthdays, and holidays for a professional look. It's no-fail -- just add a tad more milk and corn syrup slowly, if the texture is too dry.

I am not sure how that little milk is supposed to make a spreadable icing.  I doubled the recipe; therefore, using 4 teaspoons of milk, and all I got was a crumbly mess.  I added a little more corn syrup and then a little more milk and finally got it to the right consistency.  It does go on smooth an dry hard, but I prefer the taste of a buttercream icing.

I really liked this icing a lot.  I usually buy it in the squeeze tube at the store, but it can get expensive.  I have not had much luck making my own icing, but this recipe was easy and I was very impressed at how well it turned out; easy to spread, dried hard and shiny, and looked great.  The only thing I changed was instead of almond extract, I used french vanilla.  I will definitely use this from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe.  I have been looking for a recipe like this.  The icing dries firm and shiny.  Since I had to travel with these cookies it was nice to be able to stack them up and not have them stick together.  My only problem and it was not much of a problem at all was combining the confectioner's sugar with the milk until smooth.  The mixture was too thick to get smooth so I added a touch more milk and then I had a nice smooth mixture to work with before I added the corn syrup.  I will be using this recipe over and over again.

This icing is FANTASTIC - the almond extract is absolutely delicious. I did have to adjust the consistency by adding a bit more corn syrup as the directions suggested because it was too thick. But it was not too thick and not too thin, incredibly easy to apply to the cookies!

Super easy to make, and it did come out shiny. I didn't have corn syrup so I made some by boiling 1/3 c. water with 1 1/4 c. sugar. I don't think I'll do that again, it tasted a little "interesting." I only used a little bit more milk (probably 1 tbsp), and it spread really well. I used coconut extract in lieu of almond and it was wonderful- just a hint of flavor.

Wow-the holy grail of icings. Hard on top, soft on the bottom. Definitely had to adjust the liquids and I will try other flavorings. May add a a little salt as well Made these with the "Best Rolled Sugar Cookie" from Allrecipes.

Oh, recipe, where have you been all my life!  I could never get my royal frosting to look shiny.  This recipe solved my problem and tastes great as well.  I substitute peppermint extract for the almond and my kids have gone from icing haters to icing lovers.  Easy and fun to work with and yummy, too!

This icing is fantastic!  I did find that I had to add a little extra milk, a little bit at a time, to get the right consistency for me, but my cookies turned out beautifully - very professional-looking! I substituted vanilla extract for the almond because I didn't have any on hand, but I'm sure that it would be every bit as good with the almond or with lemon extract, as another reviewer suggested. I used this icing both on sugar cookies and on gingerbread men and it was great on both.

I LOVED this icing!  It worked great for icing Christmas cookies.  I had no trouble making it at all, and it is true to its' description...it dries hard and shiny with bright colors!  I used gel food coloring and it turned out wonderfully.  The kids made a mess (what was I thinking making 8 colors, including black?).  But they had a blast and I think that it was really easy for them to use.  We used a multitude of "tools"...skewers for detail, spoons for large areas, and plastic knives for spreading.  They had a blast!

This was a great recipe, but I found that I like it with clear vanilla a lot better than the almond extract.  I did like how it set well and was nice and shiny.  Thank you for a new icing favorite of mine!

PERFECT-PERFECT-PERFECT!  I did add a bit more corn syrup & confectioners sugar because I wanted to kids to be able to spread it on the cookies w/ a knife instead of having it too thin.  We used "the best rolled sugar cookies" by Jill and they were absolutely PERFECT!!!

Just what I was looking for!  Dries fairly quick, so I frosted a cookie then decorated it with sprinkles immediately before moving on to the next one.  I didn't have clear extract nor do I like to use food coloring, and the icing color was just fine (a creamy off-white).  Doubled the batch for a roll of sugar cookies (easy sugar cookies from this site.  I make a batch of dough and roll it in a tube then freeze it.  I just slice cookies and bake them for simple circles).  Got great remarks from everyone who ate them!  Note: Allowed the iced cookies to solidify for an hour and a half before stacking for storage.

I needed a recipe to ice my holiday butter cookies. This was my first time making icing from scratch so I started out following the recipe to a tee. I ended up adding slightly more milk to get the consistency that I preferred. The flavor was exquisite and the texture was perfect. I got rave reviews from my family. I will make this again & again in the future but will try to get creative with other flavors & colors. Thank you!

Fabulous icing.  Sets up beautifully and look forward to decorating lots of holiday cookies throughout the year with this recipe!!  Does need more milk than called for.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and added 1/2 tsp at a time to get the right consistency.

This is truly an excellent icing for decorated sugar cookies.  To make it even better, I added 1 teaspoon of Wilton's butter flavoring and a little salt.  It gave the icing a wonderful buttery taste.  I use the cream cheese sugar cookie recipe.  I colored the icing and spread the icing over the cookies.  It only took a 1/2 hour to set up.  Then I used butter cream icing to add accent decorations to the cookies.  They were beautiful and looked very professional.

Beautiful frosting for sugar cookies!  Once you figure out the right consistency, it goes on easily and dries to a bright, shiny finish.  Use a few teaspoons of milk to thin the frosting until it is the consistency you like.  I will definitely be making cut-out sugar cookies more often now, since the finished product looks bakery perfect!

Delicious!! I had to add more milk, but as blueprints go, this could not be any better. I used the food processor to get rid of all the hard bits in the confectioner's sugar, then added the liquids. I separated some parts with green, pink and left some plain white. Left to dry on cool cookies for 20 minutes then froze for 20 minutes and placed into air tight container. The kids had so much fun with this recipe and I used honey instead of corn syrup.

This was absolutely perfect! I love the almond flavor in this icing! I made this recipe as written except I didn't use the corn syrup but it still worked perfectly! This was my first time making and using icing but it won't be my last! :)

Wonderful recipe that will become a staple in our home.  If you're not that fond of almond flavoring, don't add it or reduce the amount.  I feel it complimented the baked cookie recipe I used.  I added extra milk, about a tsp. at a time as well as a little bit more corn syrup.  until it was the a good consistency, enough to spoon and paint onto the cookies.  my kids had a great time with it, we added jelly beans, sprinkles and colored granulated sugar as well as mini m&m's to the cookies.  we also used food coloring markers to paint them as well.

I was very disappointed with this icing.  I reviewed the recipe MANY times because I thought I had to have made a mistake with all of the great reviews it got.  There is NO way this icing can be used for dipping or painting with 4 teaspoons of "liquid".  It was a paste at that point.  I had to add much more corn syrup to get the right consistency and it didn't dry "hard and shiny".  Looks like I'm going back to searching for a recipe I'll like.

Exactly what I was looking for, I love the shine!  I do use vanilla instead of almond extract.  If the consistency isn't what you wanted, experiment!  Always go light on liquids at first-it's easier to make it thinner later.

This recipe was very easy to use, but my icing was a little runny for decorating (painting was fine though) with a frosting bag. I don't really like the strong almond extra flavor in it, so next time i will cut down on almond extract or not use it at all.

Very, very simple to make and tasted great.  I have only used it once so far, which was my first time ever decorating sugar cookies, so I had no clue what I was doing!  I wasn't sure what consistency to make it, how to apply it to the cookies, etc - so I just kept adding corn syrup little by little till I thought it would work, and apparently it did.  Got rave reviews!  Painted it on with  a paint brush.  Now I have more experience and pastry bags and tips, so I will try it again with some experience under my belt.  Definitely tastier than royal icing!!

i was shocked at the naturaly beautiful edges that formed! i decorated gingerbread christmas trees with this icing and painted it on with a brush. it was easy and just fantastic to work with. i can't wait to play around with different extracts (as i used vanilla.. the only thing i had) and i plan on attempting some very fun designs with this icing. i will probably use it for life! i am sure you have to play around with the moist ingredients everytime. that's just the way it goes with some things!

This icing is great;  I will never use another.  In past years I used other icings and my cookies looked just OK.  This icing allowed me the control I needed but also was easy to spread if needed.  My cookies look so good...I am shocked!  I mixed up the colors and put the icing in individual freezer bags, cut a tiny bit from the tip of the bag and spread it on the cookie, taking care around the edges.  Then used a small brush to push the icing around and fill in.  It dried shiny, I love it.  I did have to add some extra milk...added until the icing was the consistancy of sour cream (thick but still a bit fluid).  I used the icing on Emily's Famous Chocolate Shortbead Cookies (recipe on this site) the contrast of the dark cookie with the icing looks great and the taste combination turned out yummy!

Loved the way this dries. I was out of light corn syrup so I used half dark corn syrup and half honey. Worked fine. Of course my white wasn't as white as it could have been, but thats my fault.

Aside from being easy and tasty this icing makes a beautiful cookie!  Instead of almond extract I used lemon and it was a nice change from the normal cookie icing.

Loved it but I didn't find the measurements very accurate to description.  I added more corn syrup for the higher gloss.  The prettiest icing I've used and it tasted great!

AMAZING!! I've done this recipe now for both a family reunion, and our harvest party, and will be doing it again for Thanksgiving. I got rave reviews from my family. Made it by the recipe, with the accident of spilling the almond extract...I think I had maybe a full teaspoon or more go in... But it turned out SOO good just the same! Family LOVED it! (and as long as you're using more than one color frosting per cookie, if one of the frostings is over-almond-ed, it doesn't matter) My husband and I had a blast painting our cookies! This is a new family classic. THANK YOU!!!

I must not have made this right, but the taste of this icing is gritty. I like the cream fluffy icing on my cut out cookies. Maybe next time I'll try it again but try to substitute something for the corn syrup.

What a great icing recipe. I'm dairy free, so I subbed (vanilla flavor) coconut milk for the cow's milk. I also added extra almond extract, just because it smelled so good! I tried spooning the icing on some cookies, but it worked much better to dip them as the recipe stated.

This is EXACTLY the kind of icing I've been looking for!  I used vanilla extract instead of almond because that's what I had on hand.  I did have to use more milk & corn syrup - with the amounts in the original recipe, it was a lump of dough.  With the extra liquids, this covers great, dries shiney and hard, but not crunchy.  Looks impressive and tastes great.  Thank you!

This is the first time I have ever made icing at home for sugar cookies and it tuned out great. The confections sugar and milk seemed a little thick at first, and like it wasn't mixing, so I added another tsp milk and it blended perfectly. Maybe I had more than a cup of confections sugar. Love the shine the cookies have and the taste is excellent. Will be making this for all my future sugar cookies!

Finally!  A sugar cookie icing that actually dries hard and holds brilliant color well!  Thank you.  We used it to paint Christmas cookies and used gel color instead of food coloring for full color.

This icing is the BEST!! I used a little extra milk and syrup the first time, and replaced the almond with lemon extract. The icing was shiny and hard, but not crunchy. Totally perfect!

Just wonderful! I had to use 3tsp of milk. I used this icing with "the best rolled sugar cookies" recipe from this site. I made a bunch of the sugar cookies, and I loved this icing so much I LITERALLY spent ten hours in the kitchen yesterday decorating all of my Halloween cookies! I can't wait to make more before Halloween comes, and I'm already thinking of reasons to make more before Thanksgiving and Christmas! Thank you for this great recipe. This is the first time I have ever enjoyed baking and decorating sugar cookies! :) I would recommend using Wilton icing colors, and Wilton decorator/candy maker bottles.

My search for the perfect sugar cookie icing is finally over! This is it! I love how shiny it looks and how it hardens. I've never been able to stack my sugar cookies, but now I can. YEA! I made a few changes. I used 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract instead of the almond extract. I also needed to add 2 more tsps of milk.

A great icing to go with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe from this site. I found I always need more milk to get the right consistency. One batch of icing frosts about 22 cookies that are 3-4 inchs and dries in a couple of hours. Using applesauce cups, I divide the batch into thirds and make three different colors. The pictures on this site provide a lot of inspiration!

I've been looking for this recipe for a while and finally found it.  It's perfect for decorating and tastes good too!  What fun, I just used regular food coloring from the supermarket, a bread knife and a plastic baggie with the tip cut off a tiny bit and look what I made!  For the next occasion, I'll use a proper piping bag and some good gel or paste color and see what I can come up with....

I really needed an icing recipe like this! The only thing was that I had to add alot more corn syrup that the recipe called for, but it could be because of numerous reasons. Other than that it was PERFECT!!! I doubled the recipe and was able to frost 3 dozen cookies w/ a little frosting leftover. They are so shiny and beautiful...I'm so happy :) Thanks for posting :)

Definitely the Holy Grail of Cookie Icing!  I searched for almost a week online at Icing recipes that's easy and leaves a nice finish. This is it! It was my first time decorating cookies and they came so pretty! The thing about this recipe is it gives you the base ingredients and you start to think of other things you can add to create a flavor and color... you can get very creative once you have the basic ingredients. :-)

Perfectly simple and taste great. Try an alternative taste by substituting real vanilla extract for the almond, or even mint!

Perfect icing!  Just like the local bakery.  Only complain I had was I had to add more milk and syrup to get a spreadable consistency.  What's listed is a nice base to start with.. then add until your happy.  Sent a batch of sugar cookies to school with my 5 yr old with this frosting and the kids devourerd them

A great recipe to use for decorating sugar cookies! I used vanilla extract because I forgot to pick up almond extract. It is fine, but I think I'd prefer the almond extract more. I let the frosting set over night and they were stackable by morning. **It seemed thick, but it spread fine. I was surprised how much it continued to "run" after it was on the cookie for as thick as it was. Overall, a great icing recipe.

5 teaspoons of milk was perfect consistency for me. One batch of this decorated about 2 dozen medium sized cookies. I dipped the tops of the cookies and let the excess drip off, and they came out beautiful. Very easy. Put sprinkles/decorations on right away because the frosting starts to dry pretty quickly. (Though it took overnight to harden completely). Very shiny, pretty frosting.

I found this icing extremely hard to work with. Very stiff, would not pipe onto cookies very well, and definitely too hard for my three year old son to help with. Maybe I did something wrong? Not sure. Sorry.

This recipe is fabulous. Yes- it need a touch more milk, but then again, I think it really depends on how you are using it. If you are piping the icing, then it needs to be a little thicker, if you want a thin glazed look then you should make it thinner. The point is, it is shiny, pro looking, and it actually TASTES good! It doesn't get all hard and grainy, its kind of soft and pliable  and the extract makes it delicious. I can't wait to try lemon extract!

this was great!  I had to add a little bit (1/2 to 1 tsp) more milk than it called for, and a little extra corn syrup.  It really helps to paint it on with a flat paint brush!!!

Very tasty! Used with the sugar cookie recipe titled "Easy Sugar Cookies", found on this site. I recommend waiting until your cookies have cooled a bit and that you chill your icing in the fridge for some time, otherwise it will become too runny and drip down the sides of your cookie. Thank you for sharing!

This recipe worked out pretty well. Like others, I had to tinker with it a bit to get the consistency just right. Putting the milk in first and then adding the powdered sugar little by little did help a lot with the mixing. If I do end up using this again, I will probably purchase a brush to apply it with. I liked the sheen that the icing got, but applying it with a spoon was a bit messier than I would have liked.

This is really sweet if you taste it by itself, but frost sugar cookies with it and it's the best!

The corn syrup is the key to the glossiness I was always missing. I did have to thin it out with more milk than called for, but otherwise was easy to work with.

This was a very easy recipe!  I did have to add an extra teaspoon of milk for it to have the right consistency but it was fine.   I used this for a cookie exchange party and made individual icing colors in zippered sandwich bags (took the place of pastry bags).  The cookies turned out gorgeous and I will definitely use again. Also didn't make the cookie too sweet!

I find it a little confusing when recipes are given 5 stars but reviewers have to add a bunch of different instructions to make it work. I wish I read the tips first because this really didn't work well for me.  I prefer the sugar cookie glaze recipe for its easiness and accuracy.  I might try it another time using the tips from readers FIRST!

This was perfect for the smiley face cookies I had to make for a first birthday party!!  It dried quickly and stayed glossy.  I gave it a 4 only because I had to add more liquid than the recipe stated.

Very good.  It's a little thin but that can be adjusted by adding less milk... but for my cookies I luked the consistancy.

This recipe is amazing!  It tastes very "powder sugary" until it dries, then it is perfection!  I did have to add more milk!  I would suggest making a couple batches if you have more than a dozen cookies.  My cookie recipe makes 24, and I doubled the icing and still ran out! (Of course, mine could have been too thick, I wasn't sure how "thin" it was supposed to be.)

I have been searching for a recipe that is similar to the bakery at our local grocery store, this one is close. I added more flavoring to it (1/2 tsp of almond extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla) I also used a bit more corn syrup and milk to get it to the consistency that I wanted. I poured it into a flat bowl after it was mixed and just dipped my cookies into the icing. if your icing gets a bit hard before you are done with it, you can put it into the microwave for a few seconds. I will use this recipe again (unless I find out the secret at the bakery!)

very forgiving icing and worked a treat. I flavoured it with lemon extract which gave a nice offset to the sweetness of sugar cookies. Nice one!

This recipe worked very nicely for me.  I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons extra of milk to make the icing spread well. I put on sprinkles and other decorations while the icing was wet, and then it dried so that I could stack the cookies in gift boxes.  I used 1/4 teaspoon of orange extract for flavor, and that went over very well.  This recipe is a keeper.

This icing was perfect..the texture the shine to it once it dried PERFECT.  Thx so much for the recipe.  
I followed the directions to a tee, however I did increased the vanilla to 3/4 tsp.  I used the icing on Ice skate cookies (which I used a seven upside down)I used mini candy canes for the blades, and piped the laces.  Way too cute.

This recipe was easy work with and made beautiful cookies. I followed the recipe to the letter. I had to add a little extra corn syrup because I walked away from decorating a little longer then expected. I only gave it 4 stars is taste. It is just sweet, which it should be. I think I just prefer butter cream type frosting.
*** update*** this frosting tastes much better dried on the cookie then from the bowl****

Great icing recipe! This is my first time using this type of icing, and I found it to be very easy to mix and 'paint' on each sugar cookie. It also was easy to work with in a pastry bag. Held it's form even through drying, and didn't run with other colors. I will be using this recipe in the future.

Love this recipe! However, I had to use 4+ tsp of milk in order to get it smooth. At first after using 2 tsp of milk (having not read others reviews) I was stuck with a huge lump of sugar! It was pretty awful, but once I made the adjustments- it was perfect. While I added extra milk, I didn't add extra corn syrup. This gave my cookies a dull look instead of the brilliant gloss I had hoped for. So definitely add equal parts of milk & corn syrup. Next time I'll try 3tsp of each! Great smooth look, easy to work with... I'm so happy I found this recipe!

This is my second time using this icing. The first time I used the Almond extract as stated and none of the "men" in my house liked the taste. I loved it but I was definitely in the minority. It is, however, a perfect icing for cookies...it does dry hard and shiny so you can stack your cookies. So I made it again today for New Year's Eve cookies and this time I used Vanilla Extract instead...everyone loves it :) Will use as my icing for cut-outs from now on!!!

This is a great icing. I've used it many many times. Sometimes I use vanilla extract instead.
I am finding that the icing on my cookies will crystalize or have 'snowflakes' on the icing if they are below room temperature though.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Is there anything I can do to prevent this? I can't store my cookies in the fridge or anywhere cool.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for! I'm so glad I found it in time for Christmas cookies. I gave it a trial run for thanksgiving cookies, and everyone loved them. The glossy finish makes you want to pick up the cookie and try it, and the icing melts in your mouth when you do. I was able to do multiple colors on one cookie and I was able to get a "semi-pro" look to serve my guests. I will be using this recipe as my go-to from now on.

At first when I was looking at all the photos submitted for this recipe, I was a little nervous about trying it out. They all looked very pretty and I thought mine would turn out a mess... but I'm glad I tried it! It was easy to make and although tasted very sweet by itself, complimented my sugar cookies nicely. I substituted Vanilla for the Almond extract, though. It was also very easy to put on and decorate with. The glossy shine made it look professionally done. I'm in love with this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I like the recipe better substituting vanilla extract vs. the almond extract, but I'm sure that's a matter of personal taste.  Overall, worked well, had a nice shell on top so I could stack cookies or pack individually in baggies.

Great icing recipe!!  Easy to work with and easy to color - and the important part - it tastes really good!!  Only thing is it does not make a lot.  I made 45 3" cookies and I had to quadruple the recipe.

I was amazed by how easy this recipe was.  I was blown away with the shiny color, and oh wow, that almond flavoring really put it over the top!!  I will be keeping this recipe forever!!  Thank you.

OMG, I have been searching for YEARS for this recipe!! The icing was absolutely perfect for decorating cookies. It was shiny and dried so cookies could be stacked or put in cellophane wrap for gift giving. Like the other reviews posted though, it does take some tweaking. The milk/corn syrup mixture is a bit off and I just simply added a bit of both until it had a good consistency. I added lemon extract, but after making it, my family tells me they prefer vanilla or almond flavoring, so I will try that next time. Awesome, awesome cookie decorating recipe. I am done with fall/Halloween cookies and already looking forward to decorating Christmas cookies!! (I used Wilton concentrated gel for different colored icing. It was bright and true to color.)

Great base icing. Dried very shiny. You have to play with the consistency... make sure it is not runny because it easily slides off the cookie. 

The darker, richer food coloring works better for the primary "base" of the icing... the deep pink and blue I used were perfect for the bases. The neon green and lilac? Not so much. You could see the cookie with the latter colors. So I will use darker colors for the primary coat from now on.

I will also cut down the almond extract... and maybe add some vanilla. To me the almond extract icing tasted like something very old grandmother's would munch on with tea.

I used this icing on "the best rolled sugar cookies" from this website and the result was a professionally decorated looking cookie.  I brought them into work and people wanted to know what bakery I went to!  I did try out different extracts and found that lemon extract also produced great results (made for a nice, light tasting icing).  My coworkers are wondering when I'm bringing in cookies again and keep requesting them!  Thanks for sharing!!

I had so much fun painting cookies and this icing was easy to make and fun to tint. I wish it had dried shinier. I'll keep trying with it because I see in others picturs it can dry shiny.

I really like the taste of this icing - I was a bit leary of it because I didn't want anything with a strong powdered sugar taste.  It turns out that I like the taste, but I need to get used to the consistancy.  It's runny - and I don't think I had it too runny, it that's just the way it is.  I find it harder to work with than a butter based frosting, but the taste and look after it dries is really nice.

Easy and very good. I put it on with a brush.  It took mine about 2 hours to dry, so I could stack them.  I used this on top of "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" on this site.  I got a lot of request for the recipes.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because it was a little tricky getting the right consistency (I followed other reviewers' advice of adding more milk).  Once I finally did, it worked great.  I ended up dipping my cookies face down into the icing and then used the back of a spoon to smooth out the surface and get rid of any bubbles.  I also made a thicker batch for piping, which I will have to continue tinkering and practicing with.

This is THE sugar cookie icing recipe - look no further!  It is great for piping and flooding, sets up quickly, stays shiny, and the colors don't bleed.  A small batch goes a long way if you thin it down for flooding.  Definitely the best icing recipe I have ever used.

Wow! Best cookie icing I've ever made! It was a bit thick at first and even though I added more syrup as the recipe suggested it didn't thin out. I add a bit more milk and that did the trick. Stayed nice & shiny!

Great recipe! I made a double batch for a double batch of cookies. I started out with a half cup of milk and mixed the sugar into that, then slowly added more milk to get a very creamy consistency. Was able to stack cookies in 45 minutes! Thanks for the perfect icing!

I found this recipe to be satisfactory. I used a spoon to apply the icing rather than dipping the cookie or using a brush. When using the converter, I set it to 48 cookies worth. I had plenty of confectioners sugar, but I needed to add way more milk/corn syrup than the converter indicated.

I made many, many batches of this icing this weekend for Christmas sugar cookies. It is the best I've ever tried! After reading the reviews I used a strong Mexican vanilla in place of the almond and the taste was very good. This icing is very versatile, I used to dip cookies, thinned it a bit and used it as a cookie paint, used it to pipe with round tips and thickened it to create rosettes. I iced both sugar cookies and gingerbread and it tastes wonderful on both,,,,this is my new 'go to' icing!

I have played with this recipe several times over the past few days and love it. I do agree that the liquid amount is off but I also agree that is has to do with the climate in which you live. I had to more than double the corn syrup and milk to make it work for my cookies, but it came out tasting great and easy to work with. I also adjusted this recipe to make so that I can put it in a pastry bag to decorate with. I used a cup of confectionary sugar and 2 1/2 tsp of milk and it was perfect. Thanks for this recipe. Its a keeper

Perfect!  I used 1/2 t. cinnamon oil rather than the almond and reduced the milk accordingly for a crispy, spicy crunchy topping on the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies (big candy canes on a stick).  I still cant figure out if this is candy or a cookie!!

I made royal frosting last year and it tasted horrible. I was scared to try again because making the cookies is so much work to just have to throw them out after gross icing is put on them. This recipe was delicious and so easy. My three kids all under ten worked with it and my kitchen didnt end up looking like an art room. You must try.

I loved this recipe!!! I had been looking for an icing like this for a long time to go with my great-grandmother's sugar cookie recipe, and this was perfect! It only needed more moisture so i substituted soy for the milk, and added about three times as much... this made it look more like water colors, but the color was still bright.

I followed this recipe to a "T" the first time.  It did not turn out.  I played around with the amounts a little and ended up making it too runny.  I did frost my cookies with it, it does taste good, but it was very messy.  Oh well.  I do believe that if I play around with the amounts that this will be a great recipe.  But as it is... Bad!  Maybe when I figure it out I'll come back and share the amounts that have worked for me as I was not the only one who had problems with this recipe.

This is a great icing although I'm only rating 4 stars because the measurements were off for me.  I had to add quite a bit more milk and an extra tsp. of corn syrup to get to the right consistency.  The good thing is you can't really mess it up, just keep adding liquids till it seems right and the end result will be great.  I like it with vanilla or almond extract.

all these years of making  basic sugar cookie icing, and I never thought to use corn syrup to help  it stay " glossy"!  I  used clear vanilla  to keep the white icing that nice pure white. ( It's a Wilton product and can be found with other baking products where Wilton is sold,  like big craft stores).. also helped keep the other colors nice and pure!

Definitely better on the next day. I had to add a few drops of light corn syrup to make it more spreadable, but the taste is outstanding!

I used this recipe for my easter holiday this year.. and LOVED it.  I read all the reviews about adding more milk but the original recipe worked perfect for me.  The drying time before using a 2nd color wasn't a long wait. I will definitley be using this more often!!

Perfect for sugar cookies!!!  Nice consistency, holds colour well, tastes great.  I like peppermint icing on sugar cookies, and it was fine.  If you want to decorate over the base colour, let the base set for 30 mins or so, otherwise they will mix together.

Very good.  I used a little more milk becuase I wanted it to be thin and harden on the cookies.  Will use again.

I like this recipe, very simple and looks very professional. Good for cookies that need to travel. I made mine a little too runny next time I'll go for a thicker consistancy

This icing is easy to make and easy to use.  I was very happy with the results.  I added a little more almond extract and it really brought out the flavor of my sugar cookies.  It's so easy add several colors to the same cookie.  You just have to wait for the icing to set a little.  The icing sets fully within a couple of hours.  Best to let dry over night, though.

This icing is great! I added a little more like the recipe said I could and it was perfect! The icing is as glossy as the kind at my local bakery. Next time I think I might add a little bit of peppermint extract for a fun flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm so glad I found this!  It was a little thick to start with, but I added corn syrup until I liked it.  When it set, it was bright and beautiful!  
I found that when I halfed the recipe the consistency was fine.

This is the recipe I've been searching for! I didn't have almond flavouring, but other than that, followed it exactly. I didn't find it needed to be altered, mine came out a perfect consistency. Dipped the shortbread, used a knife to spread it right to the edges, and a paintbrush for the details. As another reviewer said, it definitely goes further than you think it will. This is my staple icing recipe from now on, 5 stars all the way!

Made just as the recipe stated; we got the low quantity of liquid in the recipe to work; just took a little extra muscle/time!  Tasted good with the Cream Cheese Sugar Cookies recipe from this site.  Thanks for the recipe, Janice!

This is similar to the icing I used except the light corn syrup.  I guess it adds sheen.  I won't use this again only because mine has less ingredients and I'm looking for a more designer icing.  Mine uses powder sugar, cream and vanilla.  Not a bad icing at all and do not add more light corn syrup to thin but more milk if you need to.

Very good icing and fun to paint on the cookies. Dries very quickly, so if you plan on icing it and doing add-ons like sprinkles, do it right away. 

I did change it up and added a splash of vanilla extract to the mix. I think I will try peppermint extract next time! Also, I did double the milk in the recipe.

I too had trouble with consistency...I think maybe next time I'll stick with the 2 tsp. milk and 1 TBLP of the corn syrup. It was very yummy icing..I used peppermint instead of almond and it was great!

I have made this several times. If I gently spoon the powdered sugar into the measuring cup I do not need to add extra liquid. The first day the icing has a beatuiful shine but seems to dull the second day. Still, a good flavor and easy to use.

I used this recipe for "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" for Easter cut-outs. I had to add more milk and corn syrup because it was too thick. This had really good flavor and was really easy to frost cookies with - I made five different pastel colors and had beautiful cookies! The frosting dried nicely and looked shiny. Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a glaze that would not steal the spotlight from the most delicious cookie I made into Valentine's Day hearts("Anise Seed Borrachio Cookies" by Ruben Jerez) here on Allrecipes.  This certainly fit the bill.  I agree, as written, it takes 2 more tsp. of milk to make it stirrable.  The stated recipe was almost a dough-like substance but I kept adding milk 1/2 tsp. at a time until I got the right consistency.  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the glaze specifically for this cookie and it complimented it very nicely.  It left a wonderful sheen and set up very quickly.  Great recipe to use if one doesn't want to overpower the taste of a wonderful cookie.  MUST add more milk to make it spreadable though.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was the best icing for my sugar cookies I've ever used.  They stay glossy and have a nice taste.  I used vanilla flavoriing instead of almond, but I plan to try lemon in the future.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

This is a good recipe especially if you aren't keen on using Royal Icing which contains uncooked egg whites, not an option for me since I have a toddler. You will have to change the amount of milk, I added a tsp at a time until it looked right, I also doubled the amount of corn syrup called for.

This recipe is great because it doesn't contain egg whites.  However, the amount of milk is totally wrong.  I used evaporated milk until I got the consistency I needed to ice the cookies. Otherwise, fine!  Corn syrup is brilliant.

Okay, there are 2 problems I had with this recipe...First, it is very hard to work with...you need an art degree to get cookies to resemble anything close to the ones pictured!  Second, it really didn't taste very good.  I wasn't won over by this one.  I kept re-heating the icing in the microwave to keep it smooth...and I left it white to use on my Christmas cookies and sprinkled red and Green sprinkles over it.  It does dry nice, though.  You can stack cookies without a problem, but even with an arsenal of supplies, don't attempt fancy decorating unless you have skills and lots of time on your hands!!  As a previous poster commented, adding more corn syrup does not make the icing thinner, it makes it stickier!!!!

This worked perfectly for what I used it for!  It was simple to make and simple to use and the colors were wonderful! I put mine in squeeze bottles and decorated that way rather than "paint" it was great and the flavor wasn't so overpowering that you lost the taste of the cookies.

I searched for the perfect sugar cookie icing and this was it. I was able to get exactly the colors I wanted. It hardened perfectly so that I could stack cookies on top of each other to take to my daughter's school. The students and the teachers loved it!

Thanks for posting recipe. Such a simple recipe but easy forgotten. I used vanilla extract as well instead of almond. Wonderful icing and tast good on "scarlett's best ever sugar cookies" which that recipe I highly recommend. Thank you again.

I really wish I had read other reviewer's suggestions before making this one. It didn't work at all. It was too stiff and like another reviewer, no matter what I did, it didn't seem to work. I ended up throwing it out. I'm not sure what I did wrong but other icing recipes listed have worked so much better. I would definitely suggest using something else if your not specifically looking for "shiny" icing, and if you are, read other people's suggestions for this one first.

Like everyone else, I used more milk and used vanilla instead of the almond.  Easily doubled the recipe Cookies dried in an hour and a half with a nice sheen.  Beautiful!

Every time I make sugar cookies I get requests for this recipe.  I too add extra milk and just a little extra corn syrup.  I would recommend adding less almond extract - perhaps 1/8 tsp.  I have made this chocolate flavored by using a couple of tablespoons less powder and a couple of tablespoons of powdered cocoa (to taste).

I'm giving this a 3 because I see so many peopled like this one... I'm not sure what I did wrong, I followed the directions to the letter.  The icing was so gooey, it was nearly impossible to spread on the cookies.  Just a disaster.  We ended up only icing a few, it was just too much work... I added more syrup, I added more milk, trying to get it to work, but it was just too gooey to work with.

This recipe was GREAT! Very easy to make with little ones. I did have to add a little more milk but that was it. Your cookies come out shiny and very tasty. This one is definately a keeper.

Awesome!!! Finally a hard drying icing to stack bright, beautiful cookies into containers.  I did have to play a little with the measurements to get a creamy icing, but perfect to paint on / a little thick to dip.  Sprinkle right away, they bounce off after a few minutes.  And icing is hard in a few hours. 5 Stars!  Georgeous Cookies!!!  (I used Vanilla extract instead too)

I had to adjust the liquid as others did...almost doubled the milk.  It turned out great and was so easy to work with that even my 3, 5, and 7 yr olds helped.  This will be used often on our sugar cookies!

It does take a little experimentation to get the right amount of liquids to make the icing a good consistency, but other than that this recipee is perfect for icing sugar cookies. When the icing dried it was hard and shiny, and they looked amazing. Definitly a recipee to try out.

This was a great icing for decorating. Easy to make and tasty. Dried hard so I could stack the cookies.
Revised 2009 - I also had to add more milk - flavor is a little raw.

This turned out soooooooo yummy!  It didn't dry all that shiny like I thought it would, but it definitely gave the cookies the professional look I was going for!  I had so much fun painting this icing on!  I used vanilla extract because I did not have any almond extract and it turned out great!

I also put this on the Soft Christmas Cookies recipe and they were so delicious!

This is a spectacular icing - so glossy and hard!  I live in Australia and had to hunt around for the corn syrup (found it in the fourth supermarket) but it was well worth the trip.  So easy but such great results.

This was the first icing recipie that I have found that dries hard.  I was able to stack the cookies.  It had a good taste, although very sweet (but not sickening).  I found that I had to add more milk than recommended to get it smooth and I also substituted the almond extract with vanilla.

This is the icing I'll be using with my sugar cookies from now on!  It was super easy to make and dried shiny and smooth.  I was able to stack the cookies and the icing stayed nice.  I did add about 1/2 tsp more milk than it called for and substituded vanilla for the almond extract.  It is quite sweet but you don't need to put a whole lot on each cookie.  The recipe said it would ice 12 cookies but I did double that.  Everyone loved my cookies and they really looked great.  My 3 year old helped put the icing on and even though hers looked pretty messy, they still tasted good :)

I needed to add quite a bit more milk than the recipe called for in order to get the icing to a spreadable consistency.  My 2 1/2 year old nephew did not like the icing at all.

The amount of milk listed isn't enough to stir until smooth..had to keep adding more. Corn syrup makes frosting shiny and gives cookies a nice appearance.

This is not a perfect recipe BUT it's a perfect starting point for  Sugar Cookie Icing WITHOUT meringue powder (which is hard to find). Just know you'll be adding more milk and water. I've made this several times and it's extremely thick as is. 

I automatically add 2 additional teaspoons of milk for each batch following this recipe. Then I use a spray bottle of water to change the consistency.  

(Don't add more corn syrup to this to make it thinner! Doing this makes it way too sweet and sticky. I just add milk and water)
 This recipe makes a small amount- enough for each color. So make a big batch if you want and then seperate to bowls for adding color or to make your different consistencies. 

Changes: add 1/2 teaspoon of Vanilla & 1/2 teaspoon of Almond Extract and a dash of Salt.
When you want a very bold color -add 1 teaspoon of Cream of Tartar.  When you what a bright solid white outlining batch of icing, don't add Vanilla Extract ( the brown color will make the icing cream colored). Instead, just do that batch with (clear) Almond Extract and the 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar. 

If it's the first time making total icing for decorating, watch some YouTube videos to learn the consistencies you want before hand!

This is such an easy recipe and it set FAST, which allowed for more colors/layers. I also doubled the milk and used vanilla instead of almond extract and the kids love it!

... I'm so confused and I wonder if I've lost my marbles.  I tried making this but got stuck on the first instruction.  2 tsp of milk simply disappeared into 1 c of confectioners sugar.  That was enough liquid to barely moisten a little bit of the sugar, but how could anyone get "smooth" from that?  I had to add so much more milk, and then I didn't know how much corn syrup to add, so I just guessed until the consistency was right.  The icing was delicious and went on the cookies smoothly, but it never hardened (probably because my ratios were all off).  No one else seems to have had this problem (with the very first step), so I'm very confused.

This is tasty. I was frosting 8 cookies, so I halved the recipe EXCEPT I needed 2 tsp of milk. I also substituted vanilla for almond extract (none in my cabinet). 

The consistency of the batch I made was a bit thicker than described and was still smooth enough put on the sugar cookies. 

I would make this recipe again.

This is my favorite icing recipe. It dries slightly hard and stays glossy. I have had to add quite a bit more light corn syrup for the "10 second settle" I was looking for but the flavor was still fantastic. I use it for cut out sugar cookies.

After reading other reviews, I substituted ginger-flavored simple sugar syrup for the corn syrup.  The flavoring was very delicate. Icing was easy to make, easy to spread, and dried hard and glossy.

Perfect icing and stackable in an hour (results may vary based on heat and humidity in your baking area). You can, of course, substitute other flavors for almond. I prefer anise. Ignore the drama Queens and their comments about measuring over the bowl; do what works for you! Also, I use a paint brush to apply the icing base coat, because it provides better coverage than a knife or spoon.

I made  this recipe x16.  I filled Ziploc snack bags and had three classes of 20+ student use it to decorate Day of the Dead cookies.  I made the recipe on a Monday night and refrigerated the icing until Wednesday. I tried out the icing on Monday and then again Wednesday.   The icing was much smoother on Wednesday. It was grainy on Monday.  I also thought it tasted better on Wednesday. I let my cookies sit and the icing harden as did some of my students.  Many of them devoured their cookies  moments after having  decorated them.  I will definitely use the recipe again!

Wonderful, easy, tasty and it makes beautiful cookies.   This receipe takes only minutes to make.  My grand daughter made roll out cookies and frosted them with this glaze.  Her comment was they are beautiful and look just like the picture.  I took the advice of one of the comment and put the liquids in the bowl and added the sugar two tablespoons at a time.   Worked great.  I used my silicone pastry brush to frost them.  Worked great.

I always wondered how people were able to make the icing on sugar cookies so pretty and decorative and found out that this must be the recipe they use! I have been using this recipe for years every time I make sugar cookies. We paint it on using artist paint brushes that we keep specifically for this purpose. The icing dries hard on the cookie but it's not crunchy or flaky at all. It always looks so pretty. The only thing I do differently is substitute vanilla extract for the almond just because we like the vanilla taste better.

I wouldn't change a thing!  I read a lot of other reviews that said this recipe needed more sugar.  I totally disagree.  I think more sugar might be ok if you are eating them plain, but if you are icing these cookies, this recipe is perfect as is.  that said, I admit I did use powdered sugar instead of flour when rolling them out, so that added a small amount.  I used a thin coat of painted-on icing made of about 2 cups powdered sugar with 1/4 tsp vanilla and just enough half n half to make it the viscosity I needed to paint it on the cookies.  Since it has the baking powder in it I rolled them thinner too, closer to 1/8" thick. The first batch I made I rolled 1/4" and they puffed up to a finished cookie almost 1/2" thick with a consistency I didn't care for.  Throw some powdered sugar down on parchment paper, then use powdered sugar on top to prevent rolling pin from sticking.  The thinner roll gave a slightly crisp cookie that held up well to the icing and gave a delicate snap when you bite it.  Just like the wonderful sugar cookies my aunt JoAnn used to make me when I was a kid in the 60's.

I used Maple Syrup as a sub. for light corn syrup, and it worked perfectly. Icing still hardened; no maple flavor detectable. The icing is sweet but not at all too sweet. Just perfect. When I tried to make a sugar syrup with water and sugar, the syrup hardened and crystallized after it cooled. I'll just use maple syrup in the future. I think Agave Syrup would work, too.

Per recipe, my icing was so thin! It just dripped off the cookies. My mom suggested added half and half instead of milk, and it did the trick. Icing came out perfect, cookies came out even better. Everyone loved them!

As others have said : The proportions are absolutely WRONG. This recipe gets ZERO Stars - why all of those other ratings of more - must be a BOT doing that .. think about 2 Teaspoons of Milk to 1 CUP of Confectioners Sugar .. Thick Brick in a small portion. I would say 4 to 5  teaspoons of milk .. 1 Tbl Spoon of the Syrup.

I would give this 5 stars EXCEPT the recipe is wrong. It's more like  2 TABLESPOONS of milk, if not 3.  Besides that, it's good and finishes nicely.

This was the perfect icing for my sugar cookies! The only thing I didn't have was the light corn syrup so I substitute it with honey. So easy to make and  turned out great with my cookies, everybody loved it! Thank you for sharing!

I substituted raw honey for the corn syrup and it still came out perfectly. It was shiny, still hardened perfectly and looked beautiful! Just thought I'd let everyone know in case they try to avoid corn syrup. :)

This was easy to work with. As others have said, you may have to adjust the liquid. It definitely works well to add the 2 tsp milk into a bowl and gradually stir in the sugar then the corn syrup.  Then add additional milk as needed. I added 1/8 tsp clear vanilla and 1/8 tsp almond extracts. It really made it tasty.

This icing reminds me of a cookie bakery called "Eileen's." Very popular with all children and adults. It is really really rich and very sweet. One will conquer any sweet tooth. My 10 yo couldn't eat them!! Great for Birthday parties! I used them with the cracked sugar cookie recipe. If you r looking for something sweet, this does the trick, but if you r looking for something more old fashioned, then not. Very good. The only changes I made with the second batch was not adding the original amount of icing, just a thin layer. Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent icing. Has flavor and beauty. I used cream instead of milk so I needed to add more cream for the right consistency. I didn't need to make a separate frosting for the border so I'm very happy!

Nice icing recipe! I made a full recipe for half a batch of the Soft Christmas cookies from this site. Just had to play around with it, adding more corn syrup, until I got the consistency I wanted. Also used vanilla extract in place of the almond, but I'm sure that would have been good, too.

I love this icing! Adds a nice almond flavor to rolled sugar cookies. Not too sweet and sets up nicely. I do use more extract milk and corn syrup until I get the right consistency. I make larger batches and the amounts listed aren't enough.

This recipe is great, and is definitely my go-to recipe. I used vanilla extract instead of almond (because that's all I had) and it worked out great. I also used regular corn syrup instead of light (again, because that's all I had) and it worked great. Wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was great. I live in Israel and have no access to corn syrup so I used maple syrup instead (since it's made mostly of corn syrup here). I gave my kids new paint brushes and put the different colored icing in different cups and they painted it on. The icing hardened quickly. I will definitely use this again!

This recipe is fool proof! It does need to be thinned out so I use 2 or 3 teaspoons of milk to 1 teaspoon of corn syrup until I get the consistency of glue or shampoo. This recipe also "softens" a hard sugar cookie...cookie soaks up moisture. The painting method was tedious and sloppy so I use two methods. Dip the face of cookie into prepared bowl of icing. Let it dry on cooling rack. Excess icing will drip off cookie. Make sure you put paper towels under rack. Second method takes more time but a neater, more professional looking cookie. Wilton icing bottles or sandwich baggies with tiny bit of corner cut off. Line the edges of cookie, let dry. Fill in using stripes of frosting, spread to fill space with toothpick or small icing spatula. We all LOVE the almond flavoring. Buy really good quality extract. It makes a difference. Also I have only used this with gel concentrate food colorings. Wilson's gel colorings are wonderful!

Great! My sister and I had so much fun making these cookies and the icing finished off in a very pretty shiny glaze. It dries hard and it doesn't taste bad. I would recommend this recipe to anyone

This recipe works like magic. It's the first time for me making icing and I couldn't figure out how so much sugar and so little fluid could turn into a glossy white sugar icing. But it was like magic- one minute I'm stirring clumpy white sugar, and in a second the sugar turns into a glossy, gel like bowl of icing. Fun! I set the quantity to 24 cookies and I had enough icing to decorate 42 gingerbread stars, so a little goes a long way.

Great icing recipe.  I think I used more milk than called for but it turned out great.  I didn't have almond and sub vanilla but that worked out too.  I realized I really need work on my cookie decorating but the problem was me not the icing.  Thanks for the recipe!!:-)

I made this with almond milk instead of regular milk as we are dairy free. Worked and tasted great. Dried fast. Also did not use the corn syrup as we are corn sensitive as well. Did not seem to make a difference.

Is it just me... Am I missing something?  The proportions looked fishy but I tried it anyway.  WAY OFF!  2 teaspoons of milk?  Shouldn't it be 2 TABLESPOONS?  WOW!  It was just wet powdered sugar!

Ive never been able to successfully ice my cookies but this icing is a definite 10. It's easy and it's very versatile. Just changing out the extract flavor I can easily make many flavors and colors for the kids to ice creatively.
Very nice and tastes great too!!

I made three batches today for Valentine Day cookies and with each batch I learned a new tip.  The number one tip that made a huge difference is to be absolutely sure you use a deep narrow bowl if possible.  This makes it so much easier for the thick mixture to blend.  I also used 3 tsp milk and 3 tsp corn syrup, but like others say, it depends on your preference.  And lastly, I made the mistake of leaving the powder sugar and milk sit for over an hour without stirring...big mistake.  I think you need to work it immediately or you'll be working with rocks, like I was.  Nice consistently and it spreads beautifully.

A very sweet icing but it has a lovely finish.  As others have said, you have to adjust the milk and corn syrup to get the right thickness.

My 14-year-old granddaughter and I used this to glaze a batch of sugar cookies.  We split it  into four bowls and added a few drops of grocery store food color to each bowl and it worked perfectly,  I found 2 tsp. of milk to be far too little to get this to a spreadable consistency, but I kept adding and stirring a little at a time until I got it the way I wanted.  We used small craft brushes and painted it on.  It went on smoothly and dried hard.  My granddaughter, who is a very picky eater, LOVED the flavor.  A big win all the way around.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Professional looking results - and I'm not a baker. I added slightly more corn syrup, about a half teaspoon and a half teaspoon milk - this worked for me.  The icing hardened up nicely and the cookies did not stick together even when stacked. I filled a quart size plastic freezer bag with the icing, snipped the corner and was able to pipe letters with no problem.

Hardens Beautifully!  This recipe will need a bit more milk to get to the right consistency, but don't overdo.  Add a little at a time.  I separated into small individual 'chocolate mold' for ease of decorating.

This recipe makes a nice thin icing to decorate an entire cookie, make it thicker for piping. It dries quickly so you have to be ready for other decor or have some help before they dry. Easy to flavor and color.

I like this recipe, and so does my family. As many times as I've made it, I've never been able to get it to the correct consistency until about 4 teaspoons of milk. I used 1/2 teaspoon of clear vanilla extract and piped using a disposable piping bag with no tip (just snip the end) I would recommend this method of application for both piping details and covering the whole cookie(just snip a little larger opening if covering the whole cookie). Turned out great :)

This was visually a beautiful icing. Colored with gel colors. The icing set up beautifully in a short time and made the cookies stackable. However, it is not tasty. Very artificial tasting probably because of the corn syrup. I tried it with the almond extract and substituting fresh lemon juice. You also need to add quite a bit more milk to get a spreadable consistency. You can mix it in a stand mixer which was helpful time wise. I will continue to search for a good icing recipe so the cookies will taste as good as they look.

All those reviews and I never tried until this year. EXCELLENT!  Did anyone say this recipe is great? I will ALWAYS use this recipe for frosted cookies in the future. I made a double batch and then made another double batch of another color. I used 1/2 and 1/2 milk and about doubled the amount to get the consistency right. GREAT RECIPE!

Fool Proof! I have never done anything like this before, so I was really worried. Somehow I completely mis-measured things, and then I was just adding liquids or sugar to get whatever consistency I thought was right.  Then I ended up leaving it for a bit (covered) and it dried out, so I just added a little milk thinking this was never going to work out. But despite all my mistakes it was absolutely great! It dries pretty fast, but it's not so hard that it breaks your teeth. I added a little peppermint oil and it was great on my ginger bread.

This worked as described. I added a tsp extra milk to make it a little thinner since I used gel colours instead of liquid colour.  I can't give it 5 stars because it doesn't taste like anything except icing sugar, not very appetizing but it looks beautiful and packs well.

Quick and easy! Be careful when you add the milk. Too much milk, and the icing gets drippy. Nice flavor with almond extract. I'll use this recipe again.

Love this icing recipe!! If you do a more watery consistency the icing goes on super smooth and will harden just like professional bought cookies.

This recipe has completely changed my outlook on sugar cookies. Now they are my absolute favorite to decorate and take to places to share. People rave about them all the time and kids LOVE them (especially cookie pops on a stick!) Looks fantastic, tastes delicious, and is SO easy!

this is a great icing that is close to royal icing in finish but is soft and has a better flavour.  I added butter flavouring as well as vanilla. for the best consistency to put in a piping bag I added approximately 1 more cup of icing sugar and a bit more water so it was thick but still flowed. you will have to play with it a bit until you get the desired finish.

This is a 5 star! In the last two nights I painted 6 batches of cookies with ease. I do agree with the lady about the almond flavoring. I usually like it, but I didn't in the icing. So I switched to lemon and was very pleased. Great recipe!

It does make for a very pretty cookie but the taste is mediocre at best. I will stick with a butter icing and deal with the fact that I can't stack them the way I could with this icing, but I would rather have pretty AND delicious and deal with not being able to stack them than have pretty, stackable cookies that have icing that isn't very palatable.

Very sweet icing that pairs well with a biscuit style cookie. I was really happy with how the icing kept its shape and it was too easy to make, thats a plus during the holidays.

This is my new favorite icing recipe. It dries quickly and leaves a glossy finish. Beautiful! The only thing I did different was to use lemon extract. But everyone has their favorite flavorings.

I love this icing, my search for the perfect icing stops here. I did have to thin it out a bit more. Instead of milk I used pomegranate syrup (the kind used for drinks) and it worked great.

been using this recipe for Christmas cookies for about 5-6 years now - people request these cookies every year!  I make the "best Rolled Sugar Cookies" from this site & top them with this icing and they are just amazing.  Sometimes I use vanilla instead of almond extract to change it up a bit.

Wonderful icing.  Middled aged lady finally finds the icing recipe she's been looking for all her life!  Just made tulip sugar cookies and used this icing to color them alternatly red and yellow.  Light sheen, drys nicely and was able to paint green (stem) frosting over the dried red or yellow "petals" and the color covered nicely.

I live overseas and was really excited to use this recipe for my daughters birthday celebration cookies at pre-school.  I used the ingredients that I found in my local economy.  This recipe did NOT work.  I was really disappointed.  If you are living somewhere where the quality of your ingredients are not not similar to the USA this recipe will probably not work well for you.

Yummy and really great for decorating sugar cookies.  Spread a base color on with the back of a spoon, then pipe on details.  Sometimes a little more milk was needed also.  Best if made right before decorating, as it starts to get thick and harden a bit on top as it sits.  Wait to stack cookies until fully dry to the touch.

Fabulous! I second that this is the "Holy Grail of icing." You will have to add more milk, but do so at the end. Add a little at a time until you get the desired consistency. I didn't have corn syrup so I made simple syrup (1/2 cup sugar, 1/8 cup water will make enough for 2 teaspoons). This will probably also be great with vanilla extract. I am going to try it with lemon extract and yellow food coloring on shortbread cookies. Yum!

Made as instructed but had to add more milk. Turned out great! Love that you can control consistency to either dip or spread but doesn't have the yucky aftertaste like royal icing or using egg whites.

Look no further - this is the only cookie icing recipe you will ever need!  Applying the icing takes some practice, but they are quite beautiful when done properly!  I always use vanilla extract as we don't care for almond.

Go slowly adding anything wet to check on consistency as you go. Loved the taste and spread of this professional looking icing. I used my Pampered Chef decorating tubes/tips. Let dry for a few hours for sure wether indiv. wrapping or stacking. Wonderful.

Great for icing cookies.  Spreads nicely.  The corn syrup or milk may need to be adjusted to get the correct spreadability.  It works better if it's a little runny.  It acts like Royal Icing if you get the consitency right.  I suggest making and icing your cookies a day before you need them to give the icing time to dry.  The day of is not long enough if made a floodable consitency. if you want the icing to harden.   Maybe if made in the morning they would be hard by evening.  They dry to a soft hard, not crispy hard.  From my experience, several days later they still taste great and are not stale at all.

I did not think the amounts in the recipe were correct.  I had to add way more milk and corn syrup.  The end result was good but it was a big guessing game to get the correct consistency.

This was a good recipe, it just didn't work for me very well. The consistency was always either too drippy or too stiff, but over-all my cookies turned out looking okay.

As the recipe is written, it didn't work out very well for me because it was way too thick and difficult to spread.  However, as a base recipe with a few tweaks to the measurements, it was very good - it tasted pretty good and dried very shiny. I used 1 cup confectioners sugar, 2/3 TBSP light corn syrup, 2 1/2 TBSP unsweetened vanilla almond breeze almond milk, and 1/8 tsp vanilla extract.

The recipe is great! I added a bit more milk for the smooth consistency and made my own simple syrup instead of light corn syrup because there was none at my local grocery store. It dries smooth and shiny, and will definetly be my go to cookie icing recipe :)

Agree this is the "holy grail" of icing! I've made it many times now with almond, lemon, or vanilla extract depending on party menu. Also, when using multiple colors I let the background color set for about 5 minutes before going back to add other color decorations with a paint brush or toothpick... initially I had issues with different colors of frosting bleeding together. After the cookies sit for a couple of hours, then I can bag them and tie a ribbon around them for easy presentation as gifts or serve in a basket at a baby shower.

Better than royal icing - easy to pipe on or flow in. Nice shine when dry. Easy to work with.

Great recipe. However, I took the advice of others and adjusted the milk and corn syrup based on the consistency. I probably used about 5 tsp of milk and 3 tsp of corn syrup. Don't let this icing fool you--a little goes a long way! I doubled the recipe, worried I wouldn't have enough, but ended up with a lot left over! I'd definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe is easy, tastes good if you add a little salt, and is beautiful. I wanted to write a review to warn people that although it dries hard and beautiful, if you wrap them in plastic it weeps and becomes soft again, sticking all over the wrapper. I hope they freeze ok because the rest went into the freezer. Next year I go back to butter cream and royal icing for my cookies.

This icing dries pretty and is amazingly easy to work with.I did have to add more corn syrup and a little milk. I doubled the recipe and iced 4 dozen cookies with 4 different colors using a spoon to ice large areas and a paintbrush to add different colors once the icing had set. I also used colored sugar sprinkles on some...very pretty and tastes great!

This is a great recipe for beginners who want to make attractive sugar cookies. I switch out the milk and almond extract and use various flavored coffee creams for easy and great flavors.

I have made up this recipe countless times and realized today that I've never reviewed it!  Depending on the project that I have going, it could take a little more milk or a little more corn syrup to get the right consistency, but that's always such an easy fix.  I am trying to compare the results of this with the results of the Sugar Cookie Glaze (milk vs water), and next I'll have to compare the results side by side.  This is easy to work with and always produces a wonderful result!

This was amazing icing!! I made this icing for sugar cookies for my sons football team but was scared a kid would have a nut allergy so I used orange extract instead of almond and have to say they were pretty good :)Will use this icing again and again .

The only thing I did different from the directions is I used 4 tsp of milk instead of just 2 tsp and used vanilla extract. Otherwise I followed exactly and it came out awesome. It is very sweet, but duh it's all sugar.

This icing was fabulous: it was easy to put together, and tasted delicious. I used lemon flavoring instad of almond, and instead used a sugar syrup in place of corn syrup. I ended up making many batches of the icing, as the original recipe could not cover all of the cookies.

A great recipe to get a nice even glaze without it running add more corn syrup about a 1/2 cup instead of the water. Make sure to hold the cookie over the bowl until the cookie stops dripping.

I love the taste - the almond extract makes it interesting.  I probably needed to use more food coloring, but I had to use two coats to really get the color to pop because it's a little thin.  This is my new go-to recipe when decorating cookies.

This is perfect! I do use vanilla extract because I dislike almond extract. You can vary the thickness to do piping and designs on wax paper, then transfer them to the cookies. Just fantastic!

Delicious! Perfect frosting for cookies once I tweaked the amounts a little. I found the exact recipe to not be the best consistency so I added more milk & corn syrup. I also used vanilla instead of almond.

This is excelent and delivers exactly what the submitter claims...shiny, bright, hard icing. And it tastes good too. Especially on sugar cookies that have some almond extract in them as well.

Awesome. A little runny going on the cookies which I could probably solve with a little tweaking - just made it hard for small details. But it dried beautifully and tasted great! Everyone loved it.

I have only used this recipe once this valentines day and its not bad! i see alot of complaints about the preparation so i saved myself some time and headache and blended it all in a mini food processor. it worked like a dream! i added just one drop of red food coloring and came out with a nice rosy pink. i only frosted about half my batch fully then added about a tablespoon (generous) of milk, whipped it in the processor a few more seconds and glazed the rest of my cookies with a brush.

I have been using this recipe for my sugar ccokies  (see cookie recipe in my reviews) the past three years for my office holiday cookie exchange except not this year.  A lot of work; but everyone just loves to receive them at the office & they were disappointed I did not bake them. Also I use a almond extract instead of vanilla.  Just like the cook I paint the icing on, not a pastry brush just a $1 household paint brush.

I just made this the other day and found the same thing as the reviewer before me - I needed about twice as much milk than was called for, about 4 tsp. Otherwise recipe worked well.

Way too runny!!  I had to add a bunch of extra sugar to thicken it up and it's still running off of my cooled cookies.  Not to mention, it doesn't taste all that great.

Great recipe, super easy to make. I used this icing on Chewy Sugar Cookies on this site and they came out beautifully. I let the icing "set" for a few hours before stacking, much to the dismay of the kids ;-). This is now my go-to cookie icing recipe. Thanks!

I used this icing to decorate rice crispy treats and it worked perfectly!  Would highly recommend.  I had to add extra milk to get the right consistancy but that was the only change I made.  I put the icing in a small zip lock bag and piped with it.  enjoy!

Perfect!  The almond flavoring makes it.  It does harden fairly quickly, but you can make Betty Crocker sugar cookies from the package and use this icing and they taste like they're from a bakery!

Simple and tasty icing. The recipe as is is pretty thin so it's good for just a light base coat. If you want to get detailed and add borders, shapes, letters, etc just add more sugar until you get the desired thickness so you're able to pipe it without running. Allow each color to dry before adding details or it will all run together.

Good with chewy sugar cookies. Otherwise, if your cookies turn out crisp, opt for a more traditional frosting.

Super easy to make & tasted great.  The kids and I made this in just a few minutes.  It is easy to spread & I like that you can adjust the thickness to suit.  It makes making and decorating sugar cookies a lot less of a production & much more fun.

This turned out really well for us.  I did need to add another splash of milk (I used organic half and half) to get it smooth before adding the corn syrup - and an extra squirt of corn syrup and a bit more half and half to make it spreadable.  I used all organic ingredients, I especially worry about the corn syrup since it contains GMOs, so I only use organic corn syrup and would strongly recommend that to others.  I also used the all natural food based food colorings, and the colors turned out very nice, without the worries over unsafe artificial dyes.  The children enjoyed helping me "paint" the cookies and I got so many compliments on our christmas cookies.  Thank you!

Sets beautifully!  Although I had to add extra milk to get it to a spreadable consistency.  The amount of corn corn syrup and milk called for gave it the consistency of a pretty dense dough.  Once I thinned it out, it was perfect!

I have never made iced sugar cookies, because I didn't think I'd find the icing I had tasted before. Looking at all the pictures has inspired me to try.  Wish me luck!

This frosting was not only insane easy but looks and tastes awesome, especially with the sugar cookie cutout recipe on here. I did add the extra milk, thus only the 4 stars but this was great!! Time allowing, I will never have another store bought decorated sugar cookie cross my threshold or be brought to a party.

This sounds absolutely wonderful, it's the recipe I've been searching for for years. Does anyone have a specific sugar cookie recipe that they suggest for this? Thank you

Awesome recipe for sugar cookies! I did not have almond extract, so I added a little extra milk to thin the icing, and it worked just fine!

Yummy! Just like my mom used to make.  Make as close to frosting your cookies as possible, it hardens pretty fast.

This is the best!  By increasing the quantities I can make as many colors as I need and store them in small individual containers until its time to decorate.

This gave me the results I wanted for my cut out sugar cookies. Dried hard and turned out so beautiful!  I had to add about 2 extra tsp of milk to make it smooth but that was not a big deal.  I also used almond extract in one batch and vanilla in the other.  Painting the cookies was great fun for my 2 and 4 year old!

Great frosting! Really made for vibrant colors and dried beautifully! Used powdered coloring as opposed to liquid and still came out perfect. Taste is good too. We'll definitely be using this recipe again and again for our holiday cookie decorating! Thanks!

I followed the recipe and it turned out to be powder sugar with hardly any wet ingredients. I will never use this recipe for icing again.

Terrible to work with, came out very thick and sticky, but still was running off the edges of my cookies.  Taste was great but consistency was terrible.  Very disappointing :(

Loved the icing! I did use heavy cream instead of the milk, because I had a little left over from something else and I hate waste. It worked great! I really like the almond flavor! My new icing recipe! Thanks!

The best cookie icing ever!  I flavor mine with almond and it spreads thin and glossy, but does dry to be stackable but not hard like royal icing.

This icing had perfect texture and a glossy finish, it was easily shaped and spread on the cookie, but the flavor was awful, it was so sickly sweet I couldn't stand to eat one. They looked great, but looks were very deceiving.

Extremely easy! I use this instead of royal icing. To reach the right consistency, add more milk, not corn syrup. This icing is very sugary.

I did not care for the taste of the almond extract at all. The icing did come out nice and shiny with great color though. Next time I will use vanilla extract.

It did retain the color and hardened after more than 24 hrs (in our cool kitchen) , but is a little too "bitter-sweet" with the almond extract. Instead I used some of the almond and added vanilla on top of it...with much, much better results!

Very good! Mine came out a little too liquidy because I added too much milk, but otherwise perfect. I split the batch in half and colored half green and added peppermint to those and then I dyed the other half pink and added vanilla. They're great and one batch was enough to ice about 25 cookies.

Delicious! I added 1 tsp of almond flavoring because I love a lot of almond flavor. I also added a little more corn syrup because the icing wasn't workable with the amount suggested. Loved this recipe!

I didn't have sugar cookies so I used the icing on gingerbread cookies. Icing turned out great. I added extra milk and corn syrup to desired consistency. Almond extract gave it a nice flavor, but next time I might try vanilla or lemon. My two year old had a great time "painting"  her cookies.

Great recipe. Sets up very well, high gloss, good color retention. Definitely will be using again, although I skip the almond extract & use vanilla instead (my family is not a fan of nut flavors).

This frosting tasted delicious and set up PERFECTLY.  It was easy to make (after a few batches I just did it by eye) and worked well in the little squirt bottles I used.  My little sister and I had a wonderful time decorating the cookies!  There were no leftovers at the party!

This is just what I was looking for, and it turned out perfect.  I used this on nutmeg sugar cookies so I didn't need the almond flavoring this time.  I also wasn't sure if I should sift the powdered sugar; I didn't sift it and had to add another tsp of milk to get it the right consistency. Easy to work with and hardens so you can stack the cookies.

Easy to prepare, easy to spread, looks great and tastes good. (Had no almond extract, but I can't tell that it would make a difference) Best of all, the kids can do it on their own.

I used this recipe for the first time last night, my son had a bake food sale and needed to take something, and he wanted to take sugar cookies.  It worked great, I did have to adjust the milk a little, and I used vanilla instead of almond extract.  I liked that it hardened and I could stack them so he could carry them with him.  Very nice.

I will give this recipe 4 stars, b/c I think the recipe does need tweeking.  With just 2 tsp of milk it was a clumpy mess.  So I added 3 more tsp of milk and it was perfect!  Would have given a 5 star if the recipe did not need the adjustment with the milk.  Looked and tasted great on the cookies!  Will use this from now on with change in milk measurement.

This is a great icing recipe. Easy to make and work with. I did have to add a bit more milk and corn syrup though as my icing was way to thick with the stated amount. Not even icing really, more of a paste. Anyway, with the extra liquid it turned out great. Dried nice and hard so cookies were easy to stack for storage. I used the "soft christmas cookies" recipe from this site and was happy with both recipes. They work well together as the cookie wasn't that sweet and the icing was sweet. A good balance. I will use this recipe again.

Brilliant! My search for the perfect decorating icing has ended with the discovery of this recipe!  My cookies were so beautiful even I was impressed with how they looked and tasted. This will be my go-to recipe for years to come. I don't hand out the stars too easily, but this one truly deserves 5 stars.

This recipe was great! I used almond milk instead of cow's milk, and it worked perfectly. The frosting dried within 30 minutes and has a nice, glossy look.

Great! This was my first time making icing, and it turned out wonderfully! I did need to add a couple more teaspoons of milk to the sugar and then a little more corn syrup than the 2 teaspoons. Then I just used a butter knife and a spatula to spread the icing on the cookies.

Perfect icing for sugar cookies; dries hard and shiny and the colours stay bright (just as the description claims).  It might seem a bit stiff or thick at first (I usually end up adding a little bit more milk) but if you're using dyes, don't mess around with it too much, as the food colouring will thin it out, as well.   Our kids enjoy a tradition of baking and decorating Christmas cookies, then giving them as gifts to their grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc., so this icing is perfect. It take a while for the icing to dry but once it is dry, the cookies can be jumbled together in a clear cellophane bag, tied up with a ribbon and taken to Grandma's house without the icing smearing or rubbing off.

I see that when you view this recipe only the 5 star and 4 star ratings show on the front page. This should rate a zero! I was excited to use this recipe on some sugar butter cookies I made for Christmas. The icing was easy to make and was easy to use, but the taste changed the whole flavor of the cookie. After making maybe 7 cookies we decided to just melt some butter and brush it on the cookies and add sprinkles. This was much better. I don't know why anyone would use this recipe other than to make decoration cookies, ones not to be eaten. I would give this ZERO stars, but it won't let me.

I think the amounts of milk and corn syrup called for is wrong, cause I actually needed double the amount of each for it to work... once I did that it was just fine... because it did turn out alright after tweaking it I gave it a 3... I don't like giving negative reviews, but felt I needed to express the slight annoyance of the wrong amounts.

We were very disappointed in this recipe.  I followed the directions and the icing was very pretty and glossy.  However, it smelled and tasted overwhelmingly of almond extract.  I re-checked to be sure that I had added the correct amount and I had.  I didn't taste the icing before adding flavoring, so if I try it again, I will be sure to add very small amounts (drops) of extract and taste before adding more.

I think there must be a typo in the quantity of milk because there just isn't enough liquid to stir until smooth.  My husband misread the recipe and put in 2 tablespoons of milk and it worked a lot better than when I followed the recipe as written.

I have used this same recipe for many years on my cut-out sugar cookies. I have read that it hardens or stiffins before you can spread it all.  I mix this up and put the frosting in a smaller bowl and some very hot water in a bigger bowl. Set the small bowl of frosting in the bowl with the hot water.  It keeps the frosting the consistency of a glaze the whole time you are frosting.  I just sprinkle colored sugars and decorations into the wet glaze.

Great! Use your own judgement and add a little extra milk & corn syrup if your mixture is still too thick. Can't mess this up! I decorated gingerbread cookies with this icing and it hardened beautifully!

This is a great recipe! I used it to ice sugar cookies and they turned out great. I scooped the icing on with a paint brush and then used the bristles to spread it out.

I love, love, love this recipe! I don't normally like icing and I really enjoyed this. I doubled the ingredients and added a little extra almond extract. I iced gingerbread cookies and it was a very wonderful addition. Thanks for the recipe!

Wish I could give 4.5. Made Sugar cookie gifts for teachers from my sons school last year. Added Almond extract to both the cookie batter and icing. Excellent! If you need these to dry as fast as possible. Put your cookies in the freezer while making the icing. then put your completed tray in the freezer when done. I was able to walk out the door in 1 hours from the time of making the frosting to stacking them in the contianers. (also my frosting was not real thick)

Perfect icing for Sugar Cookies. I took advice from other reviews and played around with milk and corn syrup to get the consistency I wanted.

Great recipe! As with some of the other ratings, add more milk, I would say at least 2 tablespoons milk. The good thing is that you can add milk/sugar until you get the consistency you like, sort of like school glue, then add the rest. And, go a little heavy on the almond extract if you would like.   Dries hard with a nice satin finish. I don't use food coloring, but the flavor is fantastic!

I made this icing without the corn syrup, and it still tastes wonderful and set up great! The only complaint I have is that it was a little thin and hard to work with, but that's probably my fault. My husband loves this icing, and it's one we will continue to use and perfect!

Good, but the directions should have been a little more detailed.  I just threw in powdered sugar and milk and mixed like it said, but it was not smooth at any point.  I added the corn syrup and that made it like a big ball of frosting, not spreadable at all.  I solved the problem by adding more milk until it was smooth and spreadable.  Maybe it would work better to start with milk and slowly add powd. sugar to that until it's the right consistency?  It did, however, have a nice glossy look and dried shiny.  My kids had a lot of fun painting this on with paint brushes.

Tasted yummy, but the measurements are off. I worked with it, and it worked, but I was in a hurry so it was a little frustrating. They dried nicely, but weren't as glossy as I expected. Taste was very good!!

Great consistency, good tasting icing. I used heavy cream instead of milk and it worked just fine. I drizzed it over warm sugar cookies for a quick upgrade on some refrigerator cookie dough.

My new favorite cookie icing recipe!  I grew up using my mom's powdered sugar, milk, and almond version.  But I much prefer the shine and hard coating of this recipe.  Makes them easier to stack and store.

This is the best sugar cookie icing I've found yet!.  It is so easy to make and tastes and looks great.  Stacking cookies is a cinch after they've had time to dry.

This worked really well, but I had to thin it a bit with mork milk and syrup. Only had one issue. When some of the cookies dried the frosting developed splotches, like the ingredients were seperating or something. Any ideas? You can kinda see what I'm talking about in the pics I posted.

This is a great icing for those who want to get away from royal icing in which raw egg whites are used.  I don't use high fructose corn syrup, and the suggested substitution of simple syrup (boil 1 1/4 C sugar to 1/3 C water) worked well (next time I'll make half that much so I don't have so much waste). I made 24 large pumpkin-shaped sugar cookies for Halloween and needed to double the amount of icing.  I used a bit of green icing for stems, orange icing for pumpkins, chocolate chips for eyes and slivers of orange jellies for mouths.  When the icing became hard to spread I stirred in a bit more syrup or milk and it worked just fine. Even the less-than-perfectly-shaped cookies looked great with this icing and I made them at 2:00 AM!

This was a good, easy recipe.  I plan to try it with lemon juice instead of almond extract.  I had never iced sugar cookies before and was not sure what to use to spread the icing.  I bought little paint brushes but that did not work.  I ended up using popsicle sticks to spread and a toothpick for the detail work.

The recipe was way too thick and having never iced sugar cookies before I added extra corn syrup as instructed. The icing never dried.

The icing has a great flavor but the whole thing didn't work for me. I followed the measurements exactly and they yielded a very thick frosting consistency so I had to add more of the milk and corn syrup. However I never did get the "right" consistency. Might have to tweek it a few times to get it right.

Great cookie icing.  I personally didn't care for the sweetness, but the taste got rave reviews.  Dries quickly.  I needed to double the milk in order to get it smooth enough to spoon onto the cookies.

This icing is the best!  I used milk instead of corn syrup to thin it out.  Dried hard, shiny and sweet.  Loved it!  Our Halloween cookies look so pretty!!  I made two batches for about 60 cookies.

This recipe is PERFECT for icing cookies and achieving the professional look AND stacking them!  It looks good and tastes great.  My only reason for giving 4 starts instead of 5 is because when I tried to refrigerate the iced cookies, the icing crystalized a bit on top... which obviously ruined their perfectly polished appearance.  Oh well... I guess I know for next time that this particular recipe cannot be refrigerated!

I didn't have almond extract and I didn't use corn syrup but instead used vanilla extract and added water to thin as needed.  This tasted pretty good on top of my sugar cookies but I think I made it too thin because it turned out more like a glaze.  Regardless I would definitely use this again and would use it for glazing donuts as well.

Made my cookies pretty! I used vanilla extract because that's what I had. I had no problems what so ever getting it smooth. I did, however use too much food coloring (I wanted bright colors!) so my icing was a little bitter.

This icing is awesome...as good or better than the expensive store-bought kind and you can make gorgeous colors based on what you need. The icing sets up shiny and firm, no complaints. This is now my go-to icing recipe for my sugar cookies!

I do have a question.... can you refrigerate this icing?  I have some left and don't want to throw it away as I have more cookies to ice.    Love this icing much better than what you can purchase or make.  But it doesn't make much.

Perfect!!! I made this recipe "exactly" as written... except for accidentally using vanilla essence instead of almond (not sure what happened there - chalk it up to being pregnant with two small kids underfoot). I had to add a whole lot more coloring to hide the brown staining the vanilla caused, but DESPITE all that, this icing turned out absolutely perfectly. I iced some cookies same day and then used the rest the next day - no difference. PERFECT texture both days.

this recipe makes for super easy glacee icing! I use vanilla extract instead of almond, since I use vanilla extract, not almond, in my sugar cookies. sometimes i have to add more milk or more corn syrup to make it the right consistency (dripping easily off the whisk) but it goes onto the cookies perfectly and dries shiny and hard. perfect for cookies that need to be transported.

I've tried others and will use this from now on whenever I make sugar cookies. My daughter took the "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" iced with this icing for her birthday treat and even her teacher asked for the recipes :). One minor change was that I substituted vanilla for the almond extract (due to a tree nut allergy in her class) and probably will never go back to almond extract. Vanilla was wonderful!

Delicious and easy icing recipe. The cookies look and taste professional. Due to the thickness of the icing your cookie really should about 1/4 inch thick. Like other reviewers, I did use a little more milk and corn syrup. I made two batches, one with vanilla and one with almond extract. The almond was Much better. I will try lemon extract next time. Thanks for sharing.

This was a really easy icing to make up. Needed a lot for all the colors we used. I bought standard paint brushes and the kids were able to create their own pieces of art. Icing was very shiny once dry, and didn't tale long to dry at all.

This icing is the best I've ever had! I tripled the recipe because I had more cookies. I needed to add 2 more teaspoons of milk to thin out the icing. It was worth it though!!!

This was the best! I used it to decorate Rice Crispy Wands for my 4 year old's princess party.  colors beautifully and dries with a nice shine.  I used both almond extract and vanilla and preferred the almond... the vanilla blended too well with the sugar. .used 1t and it still tasted like powdered sugar.  Almond extract gave it a nice flavor.  The amount of milk needed is definitely subjective... I started out with 2 tsp and added anywhere from a few drops to a whole tsp more each time I made a batch.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe for sugar cookie icing!

This icing was superb! I made a bowl of it and then divided the mixture into smaller bowls and added a different food coloring to each bowl for a variety of colors. It was a bit too thin so added just a little more corn syrup.  It still was thin, but workable.  I spread it on the cookies using a child's paint brush for some, and a teaspoon for others.  In both cases the glaze went on easily and seemed it would be runny...but after a while it dried up just perfectly and shiny.  Of course sprinkles were added before they dried and that made them look even prettier!

I highly disliked this icing. I made a recipe for 96 servings, and it was all clumpy. I double checked, and all the proportions of ingredients were correct.

This worked great, thank you. The only thing I did different was use honey in place of the corn syrup. I decorated cookies  to send to my niece for Valentines Day, they loved them and she  thought I'd bought them at a fancy bakery!

Very easy. If the consistency doesn't seem right to you, add more sugar or milk as necessary -- if you thin it with more milk, it makes an excellent almond glaze (which I prefer to vanilla flavored ones) for use on cookies or cakes. Thanks for the recipe!

This is now my go to icing for sugar cookies, instead of vanilla I tried lemon extract and it was delicious I think that you can use any flavor extract for this, have fun experimenting:-) it dried so beautiful and shiny and when you bite into the cookie it doesn't break your teeth, it's perfect!!

Excellent icing recipe!!!  Had the kids in my Foods and Nutrition classes make cutout cookies for Christmas. They used this recipe for frosting, and it is very kid-friendly.  Their cookies were adorable.  I would suggest using paste colors rather than food coloring for a more vibrant appearance.  You could easily substitute vanilla flavoring if you are not an almond fan.  Recipe is highly recommended.

This recipe was ok...AFTER I added what I thought was the correct amount of milk--1 1/2 tablespoons.  I left all of the other ingredient measurements as is.  So, after adding more milk, this was a wonderful recipe for sugar cookies.  I dipped my cookies face-down and they dried beautifully.  I also used strawberry extract rather than almond...we made Valentine's Day cookies.  It was a great subtle flavor and added a nice slight pink color to the icing.

Take the hint from others and get the powdered food coloring I wish I did. I just could get the right colors with the liquid.  The icing itself was fine, I had to use almost a tbl spoon of milk to get to the right consistancy.

Excellent.  I gave this four stars, however, as I had to add about twice as much corn syrup as the recipe calls for.  Also, it doesn't make very much at all.  I had about three dozen cookies so I quadrupled the recipe and that was just right.

I've never made icing for cookies before, and this was very easy.  I brushed it on the cookies and added colored sugar while it was still wet.  They were great!  I made 3.5" star-shaped cookies and had enough icing for 2 dozen cookies.

Good! Using milk in this icing makes for a great recipe, but it might be a good idea to use white syrup if possible. Corn syrup adds a tinge of yellow and makes it hard to colour. Also, investing in a few gel colours might not be a bad idea -- I used the cheaper liquid food colouring and the colours didn't turn out as nicely as I hoped, partly because you can only go so far with balancing colour and corn syrup tint. Icing, when dried, is great -- it's not too sweet even if you glop on a lot. Thank you for the recipe =)

This really is the queen of icing recipes!   As other reviewers have suggested, I poured the tsp of milk into the bowl first, slowly adding the confectioner's sugar, while stirring, and adding more milk, as needed (don't add too much milk, or the icing will become too runny, esp with the food coloring added to it later).  It really does turn out smooth and shiny and simply wonderful!

Definitely lives up to it's reputation! This makes a nice shiny glaze that is the perfect consistency, and looks so professional. I let mine harden overnight. Very pleased with this recipe, thank you for sharing.

This recipe is fabulous.  I used a paint brush to "paint" the icing on the cookies and they came out professional looking and trust me I'm far from a pro.  I also iced the back side of the cookies which was much easier because it is perfectly flat and has a nice edge.

Perfect icing for sugar cookies.  Dries hard so you can stack the cookies.  Super fast and easy.

AWESOME ICING!!!!!!!!!!!! I have been searching for a long, long time for a sugar cookie icing recipe like this! Buttercream icing looks messy and gets messy when taking cookies anywhere...and Royal icing with Meringue powder is tasteless and hard. This recipe is WONDERFUL!!!! It sets well enough to transport the cookies...yes stays soft on the cookie...while glossing up for a gorgeous look and the taste is perfect~ the almond extract tasted perfect! I let these dry for about an hour before stacking between layers of waxed paper. Thanks so much for this recipe!

I used this icing to decorate sugar cookies for Christmas, and everyone was very impressed.  I had to add more milk to get the icing to a workable consistency (it took a bit of trial and error).  I used a piping bag with #2 or #3 tip to pipe outlines, and then I thinned the icing even more and spread it with a spoon to fill in the outlines.  The icing dries enough after about 10-15 minutes to pipe details in a different color on top.  You could probably use just about any flavor extract you want (I used vanilla).

Best icing ever!  Everytime I mixed a new color I tried a new flavor.  We did almond extract, vanilla extra, and lemon extract.  Lemon by far was my favorite.  That little touch of citrus just did it for me.

This icing tastes as good as it looks! Almond taste was a bit strong as is though, I will be cutting back on it just a bit for next time.

The icing did dry nice and shiny. I used vanilla instead of almond extract. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was a little but too thick for me.  I added just a tad more milk and it was fine.  All in all, a very good icing recipe.

I have used this icing many times now, adjusting the recipe to 2 Tbsp Milk, and all else the same. Recently, while using this recipe however, I am noticing my icing turning "splotchy" as it dries.  It used to stay smooth and bright and shiny.. now I am getting splotches in the icing.

An easy icing to work with!  It dried nice and colourful - I just mine had been nice and shiny!  The lack of lustre is probably due to using "golden syrup" instead of corn syrup, as I haven't been able to find corn syrup here in the UK, and golden syrup was what I had on hand.

This was a good icing, nice and shiny but if you follow it exact than it will be super super thick. You MUST add more milk if you want to be able to dip or spread it nicely on cookies, thats why I am giving it 4 stars but other than that it was fine.

Loved this more then any other sugar cookie icing I've used. I omitted the almond extract just out of preference. It worked wonderfully! Keeps its shape very well.  Found it could dry out some as you work with it, but I just kept adding a few drops of milk to keep it a workable consistency. Will use it again for sure!

I substituted honey for corn syrup and it worked just fine!  I also did not add any coloring and just added sprinkles on top-- a very elegant look!  I had to add the sprinkles immediately as the icing starts to harden as soon as it is applied.  I used the Soft Sugar Cookie recipe.  I squeezed the white icing out with a Ziploc bag that had the corner barely cut off, then added red and green sprinkles.  Very pretty!

I love this recipe. I doubled the almond extract, as suggested by another reviewer and it was just the right amount. I'll be using this icing for my sugar cookies from now on. It sets up hard and shiny and isn't hard to work with at all.

Great icing, works well and has a great almondy taste which was a very nice surprise. it gave my sugar cookies a nutty taste, making them taste exactly like the almond cookies sold at Marks & Spencer. also very pretty and glossy. the only thing is the measurements for the corn syrup are a little off, you definately need to add more than the recipe calls for, to make it spreadable.

very simple.  I didn't measure anything i just added more milk or more sugar so i got the consistency i liked.  I mixed it all up and put it in pastry bags for 2 seven years olds and 3 year old to decorate cookies.  They had a lot of fun and it was easy.

I, personally, am not into cookies with frosting/icing, but my husband is.  So last night I made him some sugar cookies with this icing (I don't like sugar cookies, either!).  He liked the results.  I feel like I need to work with this a bit to find a consistency that I like.  I haven't yet tried one of the cookies, but later I will, and I'm sure I'll use this recipe again.  Thanks!

Very easy to make and spread and the almond taste is nice.  Not sure how you could follow the original recipe and make it spreadable.  I added more milk instead of more corn syrup.  I make the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe on this site and needed a quadruple recipe of icing.

This is the best stuff.  It is easy to make and easy to use.  We don't like almond extract so we use real vanilla.  Dipping the cookies is easy enough that my three-year-old helped. Just let drip/swirl some of the extra off and let them dry on a rack.  Wax paper underneath really helps with the clean up, especially if you put spirinkles on too.

This was perfect for decorating my sugar cookies!  The corn syrup was the answer for keeping the frosting from running at all after spreading it on the cookie. It stayed right where I spread it and dried with a nice shiny top that was hard to the touch.  I even added some cocoa to one batch to make a chocolate icing and drizzled melted choc. over that.  The taste is yummy too!

I debated between a 4 or a 5 on this because while my end product was great, 2 teaspoons of each liquid was not NEARLY enough, it didn't even incorporate all of the sugar and could not possibly be put even thickly onto a cookie. Humidity varies widely in homes though and the extract made this AMAZING, so a 5 it is. My first time with cutout cookies and icing went perfectly with this recipe, thanks so much for sharing :)

I had a really hard time with this recipe.  You have to put in a lot more corn syrup to get this to work.  I couldn't get it to frosting consistency.  I don't know what I did wrong.  Maybe I will try again!

I forgot to pick up light corn syrup from the store so I used honey and it worked perfect. Dried smooth and hard. I prefer honey to corn syrup, so I'll stick with that. My son said it tasted just like the iced cookies from the local bakery, so maybe I found their secret.

This icing is great!!! I love the shine that it has too it.  OK, this may be a silly question, but since the icing has milk it, do the cookies have to stay refigerated once you have decorated them?    Thanks

This icing tastes great! But it makes very little.  It does not spread onto the cookie to well either. It turns out very thin.

Great tasting and great for detailed decorating if you have the time. Takes a bit to get it all down as far as how runny. I also wasn't sure if it would work in a piping bag and no one had mentioned it but it does if it's not as runny. Works well actually. I made some a bit more runny and painted that on the cookies then let them dry completely. Make the thicker stuff and was able to pipe on top of the dried icing and it stuck great. Just leave time for figuring it out.

This is a really good icing recipe.  I made 2 lbs of confectioner's sugar for about 7dozen cutouts...some pretty large trees and santas (So, this recipe only covered 1 dozen for me--2 lbs is roughly 7.5 cups).  Instead of vanilla, I used almond 1/4 tsp and orange 1/8 tsp extracts.  This jazzed up the regular sugar cookies.  The icing took the colors well--both gel and liq.

This icing is beautiful - even when slopped atop my first-time sugar cookies it looked great! I hope to do it better justice during the upcoming holiday baking season!

I LOVED this recipe. I made sugar cookies for my boyfriend when he went off for Thanksgiving to his grandmothers, and I used this for the icing. The only thing I don't agree with was the measurements, because mine turned out too thick. I had to add alot more milk and extract. But if you just do it to your own taste, it turns out wonderful. The colors stayed bright, and it dried nice so I could stack them easy. Definitely a keeper.

At first I thought I had done something wrong. I took a look at other reviews, and added more milk. My kids had such fun decorating their Thanksgiving cookies! For the acorns, we tinted some of the icing brown, and some gray. For the pumpkins we did orange, and the leaves we did red, yellow and orange. The icing was easy to work with and made the cookies look great! Thanks for sharing.

At first I did not think I had done this correctly, but the end result was fantastic!  I had to add 2 TBLS. milk to get a good consistency, I don't know if that had to do with our high elevation or not.

This was great once I got it to the right consistency.  I quadrupled this recipe because I had to ice 60 cookies.  However, I had to add A LOT more corn syrup and milk to get this to a spreadable consistency.  Don't know how much I added total but  it ended up being over 1/4 cup of each.  Worked great once I figured it out though.

The recipe was a little too thick to begin with, I had to add a couple extra teaspoons of milk in order to achieve the correct consistency. Once that was done however, the icing came out beautiful. My Husband LOVED the icing, I wasnt too crazy about the almond extract taste though. I will definitely be making it again though, it made my cookies look great!

Easy recipe. Dries hard but, soft and tasty when you eat it. I rated it 4 stars because I made a couple of batches. The first was exactly as followed, when I came to decorate the pumpkins' faces the icing ran a little so, I had to add more sugar.The corn syrup gives the icing the nice glossy color and makes it easy to spreadbut, you have to be careful because it can make it runny and ruin your design so, you could cut it down a little.

This icing is perfect!!  I dipped my the tops of my cookies in a small bowl of the icing and brushed off the excess.  The icing settled and smoothed out wonderfully.  My cookies look very shiny and very professional.

Had to add more milk than needed then it went too far and couldn't get the texture back.  I also didn't like the almond flavoring...would've been better without and makes some lemon flavor/vanilla instead.

Great recipe!  You do have to play around with the corn syrup and milk amounts to get the right consistency, and if the icing sets a while it tends to become dry, but it’s nothing a little extra liquid can’t fix.  I’m looking forward to decorating Christmas cookies in a few months!

Used this recipe (tripled) along with Sour Cream Sugar Cookies III submitted by Brenda Bailey. The icing glided on perfectly and dried beautifully; no cracks! I used powder food coloring because liquids/gels always change the consistency of recipes.    I will absolutely use again!

I finally learned the secret to glazed looking icing - light corn syrup!  Definitely added vanilla extract, and needed about 3x this recipe to frost all the cookies.

Considering my review, I must have done something wrong. I used almond extract but immediately wished I had used vanilla instead. I didn't even bother putting it on the cookies because it tasted so awful (sorry!)  I may try again, but I hate wasting ingredients!

Excellent Icing!  Add more milk/corn syrup as needed to get the right consistency.  For me, I followed directions exactly and it was perfect.  Also tastes good with vanilla extract versus almond extract.  Cannot go wrong with this one!

Perfect icing.  Depending on the humidity of your house you might or might not need to add more milk.  I had to add about 1 tsp more and this produced the perfect consistency for piping and spreading using a spatula.  Worked like a charm.

I almost hesitate to give a bad review among all these high ones. I agree with some of the negative reviews. It seems that the proportions just don't work. 2 teaspoons of milk in a cup of confectioner's sugar don't turn out smoothly.  Instead, I used 1 T butter at room temperature instead of the corn syrup, 1 cup conf. sugar, 2 t milk, and 1/4 almond extract.  I think this combination was much tastier and easier to mix.

Stop!!! Dont look anywhere else for an Icing recipe!  You've found the absolute best one!!!!!!!!!  I've used this recipe for years and will NEVER try another one again!  So easy to work with and looks so professional!  I always increase the milk and corn syrup just a little.  And I never use almond extract.....always vanilla!  Try this recipe...you will love it!!!

This recipe is easy to make and easy to adjust according to what you wanna do - pipe or flood fill inside the piping. And it's yummy, especially on cookie cutter cookies that need an extra bit of sweetness! It spreads evenly and dries smooth and glossy, like professional cookies, I will definitely be using this when I want this type of cookie/icing pairing again!

Perfect icing to decorate over.  It hardens nicely but not too hard that it becomes crunchy.  Will definitely use again.

Tasty and dried great! However- you need to add a lot more powdered sugar to get to a "pipe-able" consistency. Also- like others said- the 2 tsp is a typo- it's definitely 2 tbsp! I also used vanilla extract instead of almond, but that's a personal preference and doesn't effect the icings consistency. Will definitely keep this in my recipe box!

This icing came out very thick and I had trouble spreading it. I was trying to get very detailed work done and discovered a great way to spread the icing. Dip a paint brush in milk and then spread the icing easily. Very tasty and sweet!

I made this frosting for The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe, also from this site. My husband isn't a fan of almond, so I used the same measurement of vanilla instead. Also, as per other reviewers' suggestions, I added a little extra milk to get a more fluid consistency. Tasted great, and what a shine these had when the icing had stiffened a bit! I am new to icing, so I tested three different applications: piping, brushing and spreading. I've found using a brush to be both easier and neater! Be sure not to take too long, or your icing will harden. I suggest if you are baking a large batch of cookies, to do your icing one serving at a time. Will be making this cookie/frosting combination again often!

This is misprint, I think. If you substitute two TABLESPOONS of milk, the recipe comes out perfect. This is a very sweet concoction, so if you have a cookie with much flavor, keep in mind this icing will dilute it substantially.

PERFECT SUGAR COOKIE ICING!  Used this for my BFF's baby shower and it dried smooth & shiny.  Colors stayed vibrant.  A definite keeper!  I tried doubling the batch but it changed the consistentcy and was a little harder to work with.  Also added 1 additional tsp of milk and it was MUCH easier to work with.

This is a wonderful icing recipe. I did have to play around (like some other reviewers mentioned) with the amount of milk and powdered sugar, but got the consistency I was looking for and my Easter cookies turned out beautiful!!! And not to mention yummy.  :)

Smooth, shiny and sets perfectly. No need to pull out the mixer for these. The ingredients come together easily with a fork and some vigorous stirring.

I would give this a 5 star, except that I had to add about 1-2 extra teaspoons of corn syrup. Otherwise, it was great! After I decorated the cookies with it, the icing dried perfect. I hate when you can't stack cookies because of sticky icing, and this was perfect because it ended up firm enough on the cookies, and delicous. After reading the reviews, seems like you can either add syrup in the end like I did, or if you read the reviews before hand, you can just use more milk and less/no corn syrup. Almost Perfect Recipe! Once changes are made it is truly awesome!

This recipe was great! I've used it three times to ice the "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" (also on AllRecipes). I've made Spring themed cookies - easter eggs, tulips and butterflies. Blending the sugar and milk before adding the corn syrup is what I found to the best way to get the right consistency.   Also, after dividing the icing and dropping food coloring in it, I spooned some into a ziploc bag, cut off the tip and use the bag as a makeshift piping bag. This recipe works great for drawing patterns as well.   I have gotten lots of compliments on how the icing compliments the cookie.

Tried this with the best rolled sugar cookies from the site.  First time I've made "icing" instead of frosting. Added extra milk little by little and just kept stiring.  Turned out fine.  My son was tickled with how shiny the icing was and kept showing everyone.  Taste was good. I doubled the recipe and it was more than enough for 30 cookies. Thanks for the post!

Used this for sime Easter Sugar Cookies and I really liked it.  It was easy and it tasted pretty darned good.  The kids really enjoyed it.  I thinned out with a bit of extra milk and it worked like a charm.

I don't have a rating, but a question. Since this recipe calls for milk, wouldn't you have to store these cookies in the refrigerator? I always substitute water for milk in icings I do not intend to refrigerate. Just doesn't seem safe from all I have read.

This icing was easy to work with, and it was so Shinny and that is what we were looking for and we loved how it hardened very quickly.  WE did not have light corn syrup so we used regular and it tasted really good.

I'm in love!  I can't believe how professional this icing looks!  A more traditional frosting (butter-based), which is what I used to use before I found this, is perhaps a little bit tastier, but this icing is certainly plenty delicious and more than makes up the difference in appearance and practicality (it's invaluable that these stack so well--no sticking together, no waiting years for them to finally dry).  People were really impressed by these, and this will be my sugar cookie icing from now on.  Like others, I had to add more milk, but that's no problem.  The recipe is a good starting place, and it's easy enough to add milk a little at a time until it reaches the desired consistency.  I think I added about 3-4 more tablespoons when it was all said and done.

This icing was great, made the cookies look fantastic once they dried!!!  It dried really fast in the bowl, but took many hours to dry on the cookies.  Tasted great too!

This icing is quick and easy to mix up, however I found I needed almost double the milk.  I also added a bit more corn syrup and still didn't come up with a batch of icing big enough to ice quite all the cookies.  I was hoping for an icing that I could pipe, but this would have been difficult.    Definitely a good recipe if you want something easy and tasty you can mix up by hand.

No complaints about this recipe. It's what sugar cookie icing should be. I did find that it needed a LOT more liquid to thin to the right consistency. I used half and half.

The only thing I changed about this recipe was I used vanilla (clear) instead of almond flavoring.  Don't be put off by how sweet it is. I used it to frost The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe on this site and together they were perfect!  The frosting sets up nice and hard and shiny!  I "dipped" the cookies and shook off the excess and than layed them flat to harden. They looked so professional even I was impressed! Definitely a keeper! Thank you!

I've been using this great formula since 2004--even since before I joined AR.  Might've been the reason I joined--can't remember now.  Corn syrup is the key to hard, shiny icing.

I am not giving this "5" because you have to make adjustments to work with the consistancy as everyone has commented.  The taste is great and the results are beautiful. I made this the first time and got it a little too runny with milk, and it lost it shine.  I made it again and mixed the powder into the liquid and when I needed more moisture, I added = parts of corn syrup and milk in small increments.  This time it was the perfect consistancy,very easy to work with, and still SHINY!  I would say to anyone working on the consistancy that you need to spread it on a cookie and try it before adding more wet ingred. - looks are deceiving and that is how I got it too runny the first time.  Great recipe!

A really good icing.  Love how easy it is to make and the fact that it hardens.  I used this recipe with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie" recipe from this site although I had to double the amount of icing to ice all of the cookies.  I used vanilla instead of the almond extract due to a nut allergy and I had to increase the amount of corn syrup to make the appropriate texture.  I also used Wilton food colouring to tint the icing pink for Valentine hearts.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Holy Cats! This icing made my cookies look like rainbow sprinkled pieces of heaven!  I added almost triple the milk to get the icing to the right consistancy. I added 4 teaspons of milk to get the icing sugar smooth before adding the corn syrup and almond extract - and then added another 2 teaspoons of milk to get an easily spreadable icing. I had enough icing for approximately 30 heart shaped cookies. It took about 2 hours for the icing to set so I could stack my cookies on top of each other.  Definately will be using this icing again!

For professional looking cookies, this is the best icing hands down! It dries fast and is wondefully easy to work with. I added pure vanilla extract instead of the almond. I will use this for all my cookie decorating from now on! Thank you!

We used this at Christmas this year on our cutouts.  The cookies do turn out beautiful with this icing and they taste pretty good.  My mom adored this recipe, and I thought it was pretty good (although I like a thicker fluffier frosting on cutouts.)

The icing tasted good, but it was very hard to spread over the cookies. I put the icing in little plastic baggies and cut a hole in the tip of the bag and squeezed the icing out onto the cookies this way, which worked better than trying to spread it.

Don't know what happened!  Read the reviews and this recipe sure sounded like a winner, but it didn't come through for me.  I took other reviewers advice wwith changes, but it work.  They never got hard!  I prepared these the day before a birthday party, knowing I wouldneed time for them to harden, but they never did.  Stuck them in the fridge, then freezer, still no luck.  Icing was gooey and messy.  I tried to make a pink icing but it was clear with only  hint of pink.  In the bowl it was the color I wanted, but didn't end up that way. Very disappointed, sorry.

This is a really good icing. I didn't find it excessively sweet. I used food colouring paste instead of liquid food colour. I like that the recipe makes a smaller amount at a time: easier to work with.

GREAT recipe.  I have never iced my sugar cookies before, but thought I would give this a try.  The icing was delicious and it did dry up quickly and was very shiny and vibrant.  I was nervous that the icing would be too sweet, but it was PERFECT.  This was the first cookie of the Christmas cookies to be completely gone.  They didn't last long.  Everyone raved about the icing. 
Work quickly though, because it does thicken rather quickly.

Excellent icing.  I used it to trim my supersized gingerbread men and it works like a charm.  The recipe is quite forgiving; I needed additional milk to get the desired consistency for easy piping and I kept adding it in small drops, mixing and testing small amounts until I found what I wanted.  I swapped out the almond flavoring for vanilla.  Corn syrup gives it a nice gloss and helps to harden it.

Loved these.  I recommend using a convection oven at 390°. I also love the suggestion to roll out on parchment paper, then cutting the cookies and peel away the scraps, and move the parchment paper (cookies and all) to the cookie sheet for baking.  As to the problem of the parchment paper sliding on the counter as you roll, just spray a bit of non-stick cooking spray on the counter to make it stick.  I use the silicone baking mats as an alternative to the parchment.

I loved how the colors stay true. I made teal and yellow ying yangs on a 3 1/2 inch cookie. After they dried my step daughter was able to use a food marker and write on the icing. They were a big hit.

Great Tasting and Very Easy to Use recipe.  I used lemon extract in place of the almond and just eyeballed the milk and syrup (I actually used less syrup I would say).  It worked great and my cookies look so adorable.  Thanks for the fun recipe.

Taste = *****, directions = **, Appearance = *****.  I used powdered sugar, whole milk, corn syrup and vanilla extract.  Played around till I got the right consistency.  No where near the measurements given in the recipe.  But the resulting icing was better than any I have ever used.  I loved the shiny appearance when they dried.  Also, I usually don't care for icing on cookies, but this actually accentuated the taste of the sugar cookies and gingerbread cookies I used it on.

I can't really say I followed this recipe, but I did 'use' it and had very good results.  I dumped some powdered sugar in a bowl, added a little milk and white syrup to desired consistancy.  Tasted very good on sugar cookies, and also dried so I could stack the cookies.  
When I ran out of cookies, I used the rest between graham crackers.

First off, look at the serving size...it's only for 12 so don't make the mistake I did and only make 1 batch!  I made 3 batches and it covered (and decorated) my cut outs (I used the recipe from this site called THE BEST ROLLED SUGAR COOKIES).  IMO this was VERY hard to work with and was very sticky.  I had to keep adding corn syrup to make it thin enough.  It would be best to add some extra milk before adding the corn syrup...  I tried 'painting' on the icing with a brush, smearing on with a spatula, tried my fingers, tried dipping...  Even after thinning several times with the syrup, it's still very thick  I will say it dries very nicely and is nice to decorate with.  Not sure if I'll use this one again...

I have been looking for the perfect sugar cookie icing recipe, and this is it.  I needed about 4 teaspoons of milk, but that is the only modification I would suggest.  I added a little extra almond extract, but I think the 1/4 teaspoon is adequate.  Love it!

I felt that the recipe as listed made a too thick frosting that was very difficult to work with.  I had to add more milk in order to use it.  On that note- it dries beautiful and shiny, tastes great and ended up being very fun to decorate with!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I piped it on gingerbread men, it was perfect. It does take a bit more corn syrup and milk, as other reviewers stated. It is very forgiving.

fabulous!  works exactly as described.  we don't use high fructose corn syrup, and it's hard if not impossible to find corn syrup that does not contain HFCS, so I substituted light agave nectar with no ill effects.  I agree with other reviewers that you can change the flavoring based on what kind of cookie you're frosting, for example vanilla

I have to give this recipe 5 stars because I don't think I have ever made cookie icing this good and handy!  I made cookies with my 5 year old and we liked drizzling one color on top of a base color.  I didn't realize either that a little goes a long way with this stuff.

This worked well, nice taste and dried to a smooth, shiny finish.  However, as other reviewers mentioned, I also had to add more milk to get the desired consistency.  Note of caution, the recipe says that it is enough for one dozen cookies.  This recipe is enough to accomodate icing several dozen cookies.  I made the mistake of quadrupling this recipe to accomodate the 6 dozen sugar cookies I made.  I could've doubled the recipe and still had more than enough icing for the 6 dozen cookies I made.  I will definitely use this recipe again, I just won't feel the need to make quite so much.  : )

Much better than other frosting recipes. I like the thinness of this frosting and how it dries nice and glossy. The only thing I did change is in addition to the almond extract I added the same amount of vanilla extract. The nutty flavor was a little too much for my liking. I will use this frosting from now on.

This is absolutely the best icing ever!
The corn syrup in it does the trick.
It stores well, firms nicely while it stays soft. The perfect icing-now all I need is the perfect cookie:-)

After reading all the rave reviews, this recipe was a big disappointment. I needed to use MUCH more milk than called for in the recipe, and even with the added milk, the icing was way too sweet (I did use vanilla instead of almond extract--maybe I will use almond or lemon flavoring if I try it again). The only good thing about this was that it dried nicely so I could stack my cookies.

This is a fantastic recipe for use with plain old sugar cookies.  It tastes fabulous and sets up beautifully.  I do add a little more milk & corn syrup because it a little hard as written to mix.  I tried it with both vanilla and almond flavoring and prefer the almond.

This is the best icing ever! The almond extract makes it taste so good! Yes, add milk a teaspoonfull at a time until it has an icing consistency. Any food coloring works.  To make in large quantities we drizzled white, red, and green icing over the cookies for an artsy, beautiful look.

Used this recipe for Halloween and I will be using it again for Christmas cookies.  I loved that they dried shiny and hard.  Beautiful!

Icing has a beautiful finish, like nail polish.  So easy to spread- I love it!  I always add a tad of vanilla as well as almond.

This icing was pretty good, and worked well, but my family didn't really enjoy it. I guess we prefer buttercream on our cookies. This recipe reminded me a little of the icing that is on the cookies from the store. It did work well, but I had to add extra corn syrup so that the consistency would be right. Altogether, this glaze worked well on the fire truck cookies I made for my brother's birthday, but was not spectacular. Thanks anyway!

This tasted SOOOO good on the Best Rolled Sugar cookies on this site.  I used 4 tsp of milk and 4 tsp of corn syrup. Instead of almond extract, I used 2 tsp of vanilla. YUMMY!  The first batch I made was a little thin, but even it hardened eventually and was a perfect texture for icing.

Nice to work with and looks great. Extremely sweet though. I add about 1/8 of a tsp of salt to balance out the flavor a bit.

I've made this recipe three or 4 times now with Aunt Zula's Christmas Cutouts recipe from this site (highly recommend that no-chill sugar cookie recipe too).  I usually have to add an additional one teaspoon or so of milk (I use rice milk due to family dairy allergies).  I also substitute either lemon or orange extract for the almond.  Yummy and so pretty!

This was a 5 star recipe EXCEPT i had to add just one more teaspoon of milk. That's why it gets 4. Aside from that this was AMAZINGGGGGGGGG. I did not have to wait long for it to dry and it set up with a perfect shine! Even with the extra teaspoon of milk it was too thick to just dip the cookies into it (one of the more delicate shapes broke when i tried to pull it away) but it was SO easy to just spread on with a knife. I found that the thicker consistency gave me more control in where i applied it to the cookie anyway. I used this with the "Soft Sugar Cookies IV" recipe on this site.

I'M IN LOVE.

Perfect icing that stayed soft for quite a long time.  The icing hardened over night and the cookies didn't even stick together when stacked the next morning!  The almond extract really makes it nice.  Perfect!

I would have given this 5 stars but it definitely needs some tweeking - I found it needed more milk and corn syrup.  But, once the consistency was right, it worked great!  (side note, I like vanilla flavoring much better than the almond)

You are my hero! I am the family baker and have tried every icing recipe I could find! None of them worked. Some would not dry. Some were too runny. Some were too sticky. This is the PERFECT recipe! It worked so well that my husband actually helped decorate cookies for our grandchildren for Halloween. They turned out darling. The only problem I had is that we had to make about 6 batches to ice all the cookies. Thanks again for the wonderful recipe! Happy Holidays!

This is the BEST icing recipe EVER!  I was decorating the cookies with my kids and was worried it might set up or thicken too much before we made it through them all.  NOPE!  It stayed the same consistency for about an hour for us.  Thanks a bunch, this is a definite keeper!

This is a great and tasty recipe for icing. I'm giving it 4 stars as written because I had to add more milk and corn syrup to get the correct mixture. I made it as written and it was too thick to do anything with - but adding the extra milk and corn syrup worked out perfectly.

I was looking for an icing that dried hard and this recipe is perfect.  Next time I will try lemon extract to add a little more flavor.  On a bland sugar cookie the almond extract did not add quite enough flavor.

Followed instructions and came out too thick. With my adjustments I give this a 5. I needed to add equal portions (approx 1/2 to 1 tsp) of milk and corn syrup to get the consistency needed.  It dried shiny and just the right hardness.  Will use again.

Ratio between corn syrup and milk is way off.  It took 2 days for the cookies to dry, but otherwise it was good.

I made this icing for the best rolled sugar cookies. It was a little sweet for my taste, but my dad said the cookies were not sweet enough alone, so this balanced them out nicely.
I made 1 1/2 batches, 3 colors, but for 2 colors, I accidentally put way too much almond extract... so I only used the 1/2 that turned out the right way. 
I usually like fluffy icing, but this is good if you're going to put them in a jar or a basket because the icing doesn't get  smushy.

I have been looking for a great cookie icing, and now I've found it!  

This definitely dries to a hard finish, which is what I wanted.  The cookies are still stackable as long as the icing has sufficiently dried.  This icing floods well, and if you add just a bit more confectioners sugar it pipes well too.

It tastes great; adds just enough sweetness without being too much. 

Wonderful recipe, will be using again and again!!!  Thanks for sharing!

With a 4 1/2 star rating I thought I was picking a winner, but I ended up having some BIG problems. The recipe doesn't call for enough liquid-it was too stiff to get smooth after adding just the 2tsp milk- got all that fixed and thought I was good. I was able to professionally decorate my cookies, the icing hardened just as it should. I left the cookies to harden completely then packaged them in a single layer between wax paper- within 12 hours the icing was sticky and the cookies were ruined. I don't know if the cookies were too moist and the icing took on some of that or if the evil Midwest's humidity is to blame, but obviously not being able to make ahead makes this recipe a no way for me.

I was a little skeptical that this recipe was as good as everyone claimed - but it is. Helped to make my cookies look beautiful and professional. I had 3 compliments just bringing them into my sons room for their Easter party. THANKS JBS for posting! This one is definitely a keeper.

This icing, with a few minor modifiations, is WONDERFUL! I followed the advice of some other reviews and used 4 tsp milk and 4 tsp corn syrup. I then added almond extract ad lib until it got rid of the powdered sugar taste. My cookies looked and tasted great...took a good couple hours for cookies to dry. After they dried I was able to draw on them with edible markers. Very pleased with the results!

I had to add a lot more wet ingredients to make it a decent consistency. I didn't have  corn syrup so I used a simple sugar syrup. It turned out quite good, if there wasn't such a huge liquid difference it would have had a 5/5. Thanks

2 t milk wasn't enough so I followed another's suggestion and put in a total of 4 t milk and I used 1 1/2 t vanilla instead of using almond extract.  Turned out great

Tasted great and hardened nicely, however recipe is inaccurate with the liquid ingredients as others have mentioned. I had to add more milk and corn syrup but I would definitely make this again. I found the icing a little tricky to work with, I used a spatula to ice the cookies, next time though I will use a piping bag.

This turned out great with a little tweaking.  I added 5 tsp of milk and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract b/c it was too thick. (I didn't have almond.)  It tasted great and turned out very smooth and shiny!

I thought this was pretty good but did not stay shiny as guaranteed.  I doubled the recipe, adding 2 extra tsp of milk and corn syrup (previous reviews were right that the liquid measurements are off).  Doubling this recipe frosted only 32 cookies.  I just used the packaged sugar cookie dough and sliced it so about 3" round?  I tried this recipe with different extracts - vanilla, almond and lemon.  Loved the vanilla and almond - can't say much for the lemon.  Used paste food coloring but after 5 days, the color started to dull.  Good taste however.

Incredibly simple.  Flavor was great.  If you plan on using plain white icing I suggest using clear vanilla extract, instead of the traditional brown, since it turns the frosting a bit more off-white.  It is a bit thin, so, if you prefer your icing a bit thicker I suggest adding a bit more powdered sugar.

I wish I had mine with vanilla extract instead of almond. I don't know that the kids enjoyed that part so well. It does take color well, but I had to definitely do some adjusting to get it thin enough. I probably doubled the milk and corn syrup, then you must be quick or it will start thickening up and you will have to thin it more. I did not relish that part as I was trying to put great details on the cookies and I had to keep stopping to thin it. Also, I had to make 2 batches, as it didn't go all that far. I like it in general, but may keep looking for a different icing for my cookies.

I had to add a little more milk to this as it was really thick. It did set up very nicely and ice cookies well. We chaged some of the batched and added peppermint extract to some and it was delicious!

This looked so professional on my sugar cookies! I followed the directions, but I found that I had to add more milk/corn syrup here and there to get it to the right consistancy.  It definitely doesn't make enough frosting, so if you want enough to completely frost your batch of cookies, I suggest doubling or tripling it. It tasted fine for frosting, definitely for decorating rather than taste though.

This was great.  My daughter had a cookie decorating party last night, and we used this recipe (pretty much, I think I added a little bit more milk).  The cookies are beautiful.  They dried quickly, so the girls could take them all home in a little gift bag, without worrying about messing them up.

I love this icing because it is not too thick and dries hard enough that you can stack the cookies.  It is the best with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookie.  People like these better than our local bakery's that is "famous" for their cookies.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This worked amazingly!  It needed a tad more milk than the recipe calls for, but I just added it 1/2 tsp at a time until it was right.  It hardens really well (something I have been looking for in an icing recipe!!!) and the colors stay soooo bright.  We made some really pretty cookies tonight, thank you!

This needed one more tsp of milk to make the powdered sugar smooth.  After I added that, it turned out well.  A good recipe.  Not the perfect one I was looking for, b/c it didn't harded up as quickly as I needed.  Trying some royal icing and hope I can find one that isn't cement!

My girlfriend and I made Christmas cookies last night and we were both thoroughly impressed with this icing recipe.  Like the description says, it dries hard and holds bright colors very well.  I have no complaints, just a couple notes...
I had to add a little more milk than the recipe said, maybe because I was using 2%.
If the icing starts to dry out and get stiff as you're decorating, just add a little more corn syrup to loosen it up.

I didn't have any light corn syrup so I used dark corn syrup but it still came out delicious!  I made one batch with almond extract and another with vanilla.  I prefered the almond extract, but both were delicious and made my cookies very festive!

I have to agree with the other reviews here. The gloss and smoothness was excellent. Very impressed. I experimented with different flavors like orange, lemon, coconut & etc. The icing was very sweet so I simply added pinches of salt until it balance out a bit, the same way you add salt to your buttercream recipe.  Used colors from pastels to neon, absolutely great holding of the colors.  Just always remember to use a good quality powdered sugar!!

I love this sugar cookie icing. It's delicious and easy to make! And tastes yummy! I used regular (liquid form) Coffee creamer for the cream. Wonderful! The only thing I did have to do was to warm up the icing over steaming water if it got too hard to spread. I would definitely use this recipe again.

This really is one of the best icings I've used for my sugar cookies. The almond extract gave the cookies a great taste. This icing is rather thick, so I make about half of it and outline the cookies to make a "border". Once it is dry, I then make the other half a little thinner and color in the borders. Thanks for a great recipe.

Followed Robin F's recommendations of 1c powdered sugar, 4t milk, 1t vanilla, and 1T corn syrup.  Painted the cookies with paint brushes.  Only problem was the icing dried (in the bowls) before I was done decorating, but not a big deal.

This is my very first review! The icing turned out fab! I made three batches because my kids were helping and they used too much, but they had fun. I also used more milk than the recipe stated, which made it easier to work with. Thanks for the recipe. I'll be using it again.

Dries very shiny and smooth. Tried the original recipe w/almond and my kids didn't care for it.  Did it again w/vanilla extract and tastes much better. Great for decorating cookies.

This is great frosting and great to work with! It was a little too almondy for my taste so, next time I will cut the almond extract in half. Thanks!

I had this recipe sitting in my "Recipe Box" for about 4 years.  I finally tried it earlier this year and it was a hit!  I won't use any other recipe.  This recipe gives you the "designer" finish that you on professional cookies.  I searched long and hard for this, and i had it in my pocket all along.  lol

I made this icing to go on top of the Soft Christmas Cookies for Thanksgiving cookies, and I had to promise the in-laws more for Christmas!  My only change was I used vanilla instead of almond flavoring.  A winner!

Easy and taste good.  You just have to work with the right combination of liquid and dry to get the consistancy you want.  Then color away.

This was a very good icing recipe.  Note: It does need more milk and corn syrup than the recipe calls for.  Other wise they turned out beautifully.

this is a great sugar cookie icing because it has a wonderful finish. I just did the cookie into the icing and it dried perfectly. However, I do have to note that it requires more than 2 tsp milk( i had to add 1 more tsp of milk and 1/2 tbsp of extra corn syrup) I didn't use food coloring because i wanted to ice it with chocalate after but next time I would definitely do it!!

Perfect decorator icing for cookies. Dried wonderfully and stayed shiny. Kids had a great time painting the cookies with brushes.  We made turkey and pumpkin cutout cookies for thanksgiving using the best rolled sugar cookies recipe from this site and they were perfect.  Could not have tasted better!!

I liked the recipe but I wasn't real wild about the almond extract. I think I'll try clear vanilla extract next go around. But the glaze does dry nice and shiny!

This is good frosting and I love how the corn syrup adds sheen to the frosting.  However you will have to add more liquid to get a good spreadable frosting.
I think the almond extract was just the right amount and it would be fun to try different flavors for the frosting.  A great versatile frosting recipe.

This recipe is pretty easy to make.  I did have to add extra milk to make it go very far.  I felt the almond flavoring was a little strong.  After adding the extra milk, it was easy to spread, looked nice, and dried very quickly.  If I make it again I will probably cut back the almond extract.

Ok, so the measurements for this recipe are way off.  Just keep adding milk, vanilla, and corn syrup until you get a desirable consistancy.  This icing is so shiny and looks professional.  People have been commenting on it all week!

Great icing!!  I did not have to change the recipe at all.  I mixed the sugar and milk first, then the corn syrup and flavoring.  You need to really mix it but it works as written.

GREAT, GREAT icing! In the past, I have just used confectioner's sugar and milk, but once hardened, the icing was still prone to indentation. This one is perfect, drying to a hard, smooth, even finish.  Thank you!

Amazing frosting recipe.  It was easy to mix together, and spread.  Then it hardened in about 15 minutes so I could stack the cookies.  None of the cookies smeared or dented!  And the decorating sugars I sprinkled on top stuck really well.   The almond extract was better than I thought it would be, and I'm glad I tried it instead of going with vanilla.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Was disappointed in this recipe.  As written, it's impossible to mix the ingredients; the icing is way too dry.  I had to add a considerable amount of milk and corn syrup.  Also, I felt the almond extract was overpowering and ended up making a second batch without it.

This icing held up very well, especially since I put the cookies in individual cellophane bags.  The design did not smear at all.  I made two batches, one with the almond flavouring and one without.  Definately prefer the taste without it, but that's just my taste.

I searched everywhere for a royal icing recipe, and all called for meringue powder (i could not find it anywhere) or egg whites (bacteria possibility). I finally found this recipe, which is an amazing substitute for royal icing because it tries very hard! This recipe is great, the icing dries fairly quickly.

An improvement on my traditional milk-and-powdered sugar icing, which I didn't even know could be altered much! I liked how thick it was and that it didn't run off the cookies like some do, but I did find that I needed a tiny bit more milk to bring the icing together.  I didn't use the almond extract, but I love the addition of corn syrup to this quick icing.

This came out pretty well. I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla extract instead. It came out pretty well. It had a beautiful glossy color, and didn't take too long to harden.

Thanks for a good recipe! The icing turned out very nice at first then did crack and dull after drying all the way. I followed the recipe to specifications, I am wondering if it is the brands I used of cornsyrup/sugar. It was a nice recipe though and I probably will use again. I will try it and see if it turns out better for me next time around! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great. I did find that I needed to add a little more milk as was suggested if the icing was too thick. But it did dry very quickly, the recipe was quick, easy, and the icing dried nice and shiny. This recipe is definitely been added to my recipe box!! Thank-You

This was perfect!  I was looking for an icing that would "act" like royal icing but not be too hard and this was it.  It goes further than it looks like it will also.  I tripled the recipe thinking I would run out but we had extra!  I took the advice of others and added extra milk and corn syrup a bit at a time until it was the right consistency.  We frosted both gingerbread men and sugar cookies and it worked perfectly!

Great sugar cookie icing. Had to substitute vanilla extract (about 1 t.) for the almond because I did't have any. Used regular food coloring and the colors were nice and bright. Dried shiny and pretty hard. Great icing for stacking cookies. Thanks. Next time will make it to drizzle over oatmeal cookies.

Great recipe!  I substituted 1 tablespoon of milk and corn syrup as other reviewers suggested and it was great and easy for the kids to decorate our sugar cookies.  The icing didn't taste so great until it dried, then it was wonderful!

First let me say this tastes great. We do not like frosting and this was perfect as far as taste. I substituted pure lemon extract for the almond and came out yummy. Dries quickly.I had to give this 3 stars because you do have to keep adding more milk. I added in tsp increments. Also we had to make several batches to glaze all the sugar cookies we made and the icing kept drying out. This could be due to the dry climate I live in.

I just got done using this recipe and thankfully to others before me, I too added a bit more milk.  for 40 basic size sugar cookies, I doubled the powdered sugar, 3 Tablespoons milk (for drizzle, little less if want to spread), did not double the corn syrup & used vanilla vs. almond extract.  taste and looks great/shiny & used sparkly sprinkles right after i drizzled out of my piping as it does dry quickly

Following other reviewers' suggestions, I used a heaping tablespoon of milk and 1 tablespoon of corn syrup.  I also found that I only needed 1/8 teaspoon of vanilla or almond extract for flavor.  The almond extract did keep the icing nice and white.  I was very pleased with the results.

Per other reviewers, I first used 2T and found that it was way too liquid-y. I think the 2 tsp was just right or maybe just a tiny bit more. I added vanilla 1/4 tsp and I recommend paste food coloring only as this recipe is pretty runny as is. Not so good for detail work, but tasty and pretty!

I used this as piping on my gingerbread men. I put it in a baggie and cut the corner off.  It was awesome.  I used gel food coloring and got vibrant results for the first time ever this one is a winner!!! Thanks for making my cookies look even better!

Great recipe, the measurements are off but they are easy to adjust, just add more or less milk or corn syrup until you get it right.  Tastes great, I don't know what that person is talking about when they say it tastes worse than glue(?)  I have used this recipe for the past two year and everybody loves it.

Was a good recipe after tweeking by adding more milk & corn syrup.  Tried it with the almond and think I will cut back on that next time.

This is a great icing.  I agree that the measurements are off, but when you make the suggested adjustments it works out great. I added lemon flavoring and iced gingerbread cookies.  They tasted great.

After decades of making sugar cookie icing and never being completely happy with any of the recipes I used, this one is the perfect one for me. It dries to a shiny finish that is hard without being hard to eat so, you can transport the cookies easily if needed.

This recipe turned out great in taste. But you said to add more corn syrup if it was too thick. I did and it got thicker. I ended up adding more milk to get it to the spreadable stage. It was in a big ball at first, but when I added the milk it turned out great.

Too bad the proportions are a bit off because when you find the right consistency, this is a really good icing recipe. Tastes a lot better than royal icing!

This icing smells as wonderful as its tastes.  One minor problem mixing this together:  2 teaspoons milk and corn syrup was not near enough to make even a paste... it was more like a big lumpy pile, so I adjusted the recipe to tablespoon measurements and got the workable consistency I was looking for.  I used this icing on Sugar Cookies V from this site and my cookies turned out to be the best I have ever had.

This was good. Can't imagine only using the amount of milk that it calls for. I think I doubled the milk using 4 tsp. It has a nice flavor.

Tasted pretty good, but the consistency was kind of hard to work with... It was too thick at first but after I added a little bit of milk, it got really runny, and so forth. I'll try it again, but hopefully I won't mess up next time :)

My sister and I used this recipe to make favors for a birthday party.  We had to make a lot of icing, and were looking for an easy recipe.  This worked very well.  We used lemon extract instead of almond, and added extra milk and corn syrup.  The cookies are really pretty and the icing tastes great! (We made one batch of icing with vanilla soy milk, and it turned out well).

This was really easy and I liked not having to use egg whites. I used other reviewers suggestions and added 2 Tbsp of milk-I think this was a little much -my icing was runny and ran into the dents in my cookies. Next time I will do maybe 1 TBsp and go from there. Overall it was easy and tasty.

I LOVE this icing! I really do think this is the best icing to use on sugar cookies and recieved tonnes of comments about how glossy it looks. Although, I am glad I read the reviews before making this recipe the first time because you really DO need to use more milk. This recipe is full proof!

This is the best icing I have ever used, hands down.  The colours are brilliant, and it tastes betterthan most icings.  All 4 of my kids loved it!

I did play with the amounts of milk and sugar to get the consistency I wanted.
A keeper!

I squeezed mine out onto gingerbread cookies.  I changed the almond to vanilla.  I had to add a little more corn syrup to get a nice consistency.  And I was pleased with how quickly they harden for stacking.  It dried nice and shiny.  Great!

Absolutely wonderful.  I don't care for almond extract so I substituted it with vanilla.  I would definately recommend this recipe to anyone.

As listed, the recipe didn't call for enough milk, but that was easy to tweak.  Once made, the icing was very easy to work with and got rave reviews.  I added some heart-shaped sprinkles to the cookies before the icing dried and not a single one fell off!

Fantastic icing! The colors were bright and the flavor was perfect. The only thing I have to say is that the amount called for makes a lot more than 12 servings.  I doubled the recipe for my batch of 45 cookies and I still had a ton left over. Also, you need to add more milk than the recipe calls for.

Great recipe!!! The icing held the bright colors well and tasted better than most recipes I've tried.  I added a bit more milk as it was realllly thick as written, but it adapted well.  I used 4 or 5 squeeze bottles to make applying several different colors quick and easy.

Excellent icing.  I too added more milk and corn syrup to get it to spreading consistency, about 1-2 tsp. each.  Love the shiny hard finish!

This is a good icing, a little sweet, but I like how it dries. I needed to add more than 2 tsp of milk, more like 4 or 5 to make it spreadable. I used this on the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site.

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  I started with the original recipe, but knew right away that the 2 tsp. milk would not be enough liquid to get the 1 c. confectioner's sugar "smooth".  So I checked the other reviews, and decided to add an extra tsp. of milk.  Still far from "smooth".  Afraid of adding too much milk before the corn syrup was added, I went ahead and added the corn syrup.  It was a gloppy mess.  I added a bit more corn syrup, then a bit more milk, and it was still a gluey mess, and I decided to trash it.

Simple, easy and attractive.  I did add a bit more milk to make it flow while piping a bit easier.  Makes a small amount.  Held up well on cookies packed and layered and taken to school for Christmas treats.  Thanks Janice...a permanent addition to my recipes.

What a great icing recipe!  It dries into a beautiful icing and it is tasty as well.  I used vanilla extract instead of almond and did what some others suggested by increasing the amount of milk and corn syrup by one teaspoon and it turned out perfect.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!! :)

After reading the reviews, I decided to give this one a try. The icing texture and appearance was great, and it was easy to apply to the cookies, however it did not taste good.

It tasted okay on the cookies, but when I tried it by itself, it was not tasty.  (I did use the vanilla instead of almond, so that may have made the difference. )I would suggest not adding too much icing to your cookies, so the flavor of the cookies stands out more.

Good icing for Christmas sugar cookies. Takes forever to dry so plan your cookie baking time with this in mind.  I added extra syrup and milk and had to double the recipe. My cookies looked great and I plan to use this recipe every Christmas!

This recipe is almost exactly like the one my mom uses for her sugar cookie icing, but she uses vanilla instead of almond extract. It took me a little bit to get used to the flavor, but either almond or vanilla is good for flavor.

This was beautiful frosting, may need to be doubled for any more than 1 dozen! Be sure to let it dry completely. After sending these to preschool for Valentine's, I now have the reputation of making great desserts!

Fun to make and paint.  I added the extract (I used orange) to the icing and it added a yummy flavor that blended wonderful with the cinnamon.  It was wonderful with the Snow Flake Sugar Cookie recipe found here.

This was soooo easy! And the colors were bright and shiney! I, too, had to add a little more syrup. Not only does it dry hard and make the cookies stackable, but I could wrap the cookies individually and they'll last as long as it takes for my husband to eat them.

Oh!  This was so fun.  I love the idea to paint the frosting on.  We did just that with my three little boys.  It colors very well and the cookies turn out soooo cute!  We will surely do this again.  However, next time, my 18 month old will only get the white frosting. He was red for the rest of the evening.

Excellent recipe!  I use this to frost sugar cookies using the Easy Valentine Sandwich Cookies from this site.  Those sugar cookies are incredibly good for a cut-out recipe.  Paired with this icing, my cut-out cookies look and taste terrific.  Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipe-ones like these are hard to come by!

This icing was small in quantity and I had to add quite a bit of milk and corn syrup to make it a workable consistancy which made it very runny.  Color was good and taste even better.

sure sometimes the milk or corn syrup needs to be adjusted- but this icing is SO EASY, super tasty and dries to a magazine-quality finish! I seriously took photos of my first batch using it.  sometimes i use lemon extract instead, but really anything will work.

This icing is VERY sweet.  It doesn't take much icing per cookie.  It does dry to look very nice though.

Very easy to work with, dries nice and firm so you can stack cookies.  While it is sweet, you only need a thin layer on the cookie.

I had to use a little more milk and would probably add more vanilla next time (I substituted vanilla for almond extract.)  Overall, the frosting was very sweet but was exactly what I was looking for to top my sugar cookies!

I really liked this recipe.  The colors were so pretty after they dried.  It is very sweet, but I like it that way.   I had to add a bit more corn syrup to make it spreadable.

I made a double batch to have enough to ice 70 cookies.I followed the recipe exactly and the icing was so stiff I could not work with it.So I had to triple the amount of milk and corn syrup called for to make it spreadable enough to paint my cookies.I wonder if teaspoon should not be tablespoon instead.

This is the only icing I use for my sugar cookies. I use a teaspoon of almond extract, and everyone loves this icing! They say they are all spoiled now and won't eat "real" royal icing. It's great for flooding, but still manageable.

This recipe did not work for me.  There’s not nearly enough milk to get a smooth consistency.  And the taste was really not good—made the cookies almost inedible.  I made some royal icing with pasteurized egg whites the next time instead, and it was way better.

This is an excellent frosting for sugar cookies. I did make a few changes and also suggest one I’ll be making for next time. It says 2 teaspoons of milk, I needed about 4, 2 wasn’t even close. I would also only add 1/2 of the almond extract. It’s overpowering and a little too sweet. But the consistency of the frosting is spot on, it doesn’t get hard like a lot of others and it’s easy to apply.

The recipe is versatile as other reviewers have suggested by adding a different flavor instead of the almond. I liked the suggestion of another reviewer about adding the powdered sugar into the milk. I did the opposite and didn’t think it would turn out by the way it was clumped up. It wasn’t until I added the extract and corn syrup that it smoothed out. It was very flavorful and I love the glossy finished look. I ended up making another batch because it didn’t look like one would be enough.

A winner!  Best sugar cookie icing I've tasted.  One word to the wise: if you use  vanilla extract (or any dark extract), your icing won't be white white. I omit it and still all works well.

I really wish I could give this 5 stars but I can’t. I followed the recipe and it was beautiful. Exactly as I hoped it would look. The taste was not! Made this in multiple colors for a cookie decorating party. One kid said it taste like medicine, another said it wasn’t good. I finally decided to taste it and I didn’t like it either. Not sure if it was the almond extract or something else. Many cookies thrown away.

It was okay. I started making it, and even after I put all the ingredients in, it was chunky and wouldn't blend. I added more corn syrup, and it didn't do a thing! I ended up adding at least 4 more teaspoons of milk and it finally turned into usable icing. 
Wouldn't really recommend it, but maybe I just did something wrong because of the very brief and undetailed instructions.

Turned out perfect! Easy to make, apply and hardened is a good amount out time so I could pack away the cookies! This was the first time I made this type of icing. One small change was I used 1/8 tsp almond extract and 1/8 tsp vanilla extract ( just because I'm not a big fan of almond extract) I recommend trying this recipe.

I made this and it does everything all of the above reviews says. Goes on easy, glossy, hardens in 10 mins. allowing stacking. My only problem was the overwhelming taste of powdered sugar instead of vanilla. I did not want the lemon taste and I am not a fan of almond  that's why I used vanilla. Oh well, you live, learn and try again. Any new suggestions welcome...

Love it!  I did add more milk/corn syrup in rotation of one another because 4 tsp (combined) just wasn't enough liquid.  The icing was beautiful, and not too sweet!  Perfect!

You'll need a little more milk than it says. And if you don't like almond you can use vanilla or whatever other extract you prefer.

Very tasty!  We added vanilla extract instead of almond.  I also ended up using an extra teaspoon of milk because it was too stiff, and I felt the corn syrup was too thick.  It doesn't make as much as I thought it would.  We had barely enough to cover one large gingerbread man (about 5" x 3").  The icing dried very well.

I had to add a tiny bit extra of the milk and another teaspoon of the syrup. It was very dry until then. I also used vanilla extract. But it turned out great! Very tasty and light.

This is just what I was looking for— simple to make, not overbearingly sweet, and the cookies are totally stackable once they’re dry. Perfect for the gingerbread cookies I’m mailing to my family.

The one thing I will suggest to people trying this recipe is that if you’re trying to make it a bit thinner, definitely add more milk instead of corn syrup (and you’ll likely need to, I know two teaspoons wasn’t even close to enough for me)!

I have used this the past 2 years to decorate my gingerbread boys.   It's certainly cheaper to make than buying the pre-made stuff and I like the glossy look when they dry.  But measuring out the Karo syrup and powdered sugar always makes such a mess!

I have struggled quite a bit with this recipe.  I can not, for the life of me, get 1 cup of confectioner's sugar and 2 teaspoons of milk to make a smooth paste.   I always end up with sugar crumbs.   I have made this recipe several times and I always have to add 4  tsps of milk to get the sugar/milk mixture to become a liquid.  Adding 2 tsp of light corn syrup after that helps to give it a nice consistency.   Once I get the icing made, it is great on cookies.  I've used the almond extract and the vanilla.   I prefer the vanilla but the almond extract is very nice also.  The icing dries nice and shiny and hard and looks great.  It's also makes it nice for stacking the cookies in a container to bring them into work.

My icing was too dry so I added another teaspoon milk to thin it out. The corn syrup makes it sticky so if you want it easy to work with, then make a double batch or triple batch of icing & spoon into zip lock baggies after adding food coloring and cut off tip at end of one corner to squeeze this icing onto the mostly cooled sugar cookie.  Don’t take too long. This icing firms up fast!

I was looking for a cookie icing that did not use raw egg whites or the meringue powder (which causes a "strange" taste to the icing).  Walla, I came across this recipe and it is now my go to icing for cookies.  This icing not only hardens when it dries but due to the Karo syrup, it also has a nice shine to it.  I make the recipe exactly as written, at times (probably because I get too generous with the powdered sugar) I do have to add a skosh of Karo or milk if it's still too "dry".  This icing is also excellent for piping decorations on the cookie's!!  Happy Baking!!

This works well but does take a day to dry hard so it doesn't stick to other cookies.  Once it does, though, it's perfect and what I was looking for.  I did have to add more milk to get it to spreading consistency.

I've been making this one since I first ran across it a few years ago.  Like others have mentioned, I substituted vanilla for almond extract, as I'm not a huge fan of almond extract and find it overwhelms the subtle sweetness of sugar cookies.  I did have to play with the corn syrup amounts.  The icing hardened nicely and looked great.  I will be using it again this year for my Christmas sugar cookies, which I always make with my old fashioned tin handled cookie cutters that my mother used to use back in the 1950s and 1960s.

I have been searching for an easy yet tasty cookie icing recipe and I've found it! 
I added one more tspn of milk for the consistency I preferred and used both vanilla and lemon (a little goes a long way) extract instead of almond extract and it tastes amazing!! The icing gave that shiny, glossy look on the cookies and didn't take too long to harden. I will definitely be using this recipe from now on!

This was the first time I made an icing to decorate cookies. I was looking for an easy recipe that would taste yummy and would be easy to work with. I baked about 12 large cookies (about 4 inches wide) and four small drop cookies. I basically ended up doubling the recipe as I went. I wasn't sure how much I needed at first but it became clear very quickly that the amount I originally made would not be near enough. I also used vanilla extract, rather than almond cause that's what my husband prefers but I'm excited to try almond. The icing is beautiful and tasty and shiny and dried very well! For my first attempt at cookie decorating, I was thrilled!! Easy and scrumptious!

If you're looking for a quick and reliable sugar cooking icing that dries quickly and looks good...you've found it! If it's too thick add a little more milk, too thin/runny add a pinch more confec. sugar!

I have been intimidated by the premise of a royal type icing for so long.  Well, my grandson's second birthday comes along and it's a Baby Shark theme and I am making Baby Shark cut-out cookies....I researched recipe after recipe.  I was baking many other things and didn't have hours to have the cookies dry before stacking them for transport, plus I was concerned about all those recipes for royal icing that people said didn't taste that great but looked great.  Enter this recipe - IT'S EASY AND IT TASTES GOOD!!!!  I can see why so many people call this recipe their Holy Grail icing recipe, as it is certainly mine now, too.  I found I had to add a bit more milk to make mine the consistency I needed (I painted my icing on - next time I may try to pipe it on).  It dries FAST - my cookies were ready to put in containers stacked between layers of parchment in about 90 min. or less.  It dried nice and even and shiny - for my first attempt they looked great.  I also had other cookies and three types of cupcakes going, too, plus my bathroom was being ripped apart for a leaking shower so I had access to water on and off (another story for another day).  My point is if the cookies turned out so well with all THAT going on, I can only imagine what I could do with peace and quiet and time to spend on them.  Thank you for a great recipe that I will undoubtedly use again and again.

Fantastic! I followed the other comments with 1 cup powdered sugar, 4 tsp milk, 1 tsp almond extract, and 1 tbsp corn syrup. I used this for piping and then thinned down the remaining frosting with another tsp of milk and used it for flooding. My first time ever frosting cookies this way and I loved how they turned out!

This recipe definitely needs some vanilla! I followed this recipe as stated and the result was not what was promised. Luckily I was able to save it by adding much more milk & adding vanilla for better flavor.

I tripled the recipe to ice about 3 dozen cookies and used creamer instead of milk.  Substituted vanilla for the almond extract, and ended up adding A bit of water to thin it out.  It came out beautifully shiny and took the colors (gel color) well.  I let it dry about 8 hours before putting them into bags.

My go to icing for cookies now! I had to add a lot more milk then what it called for, and if you want it more glossy/shiny, add more corn syrup. Also, it took some work to discover a technique for border versus spread/filling consistency but it dries quickly and looks great. The almond flavoring really gave it a nice change from the normal blah icing taste.

Great icing!  I added half the Karo than milk and it still ended up glossy. After I outlined them, I added a little more milk to each color so that I could fill in the outline easier (and use a little less icing to reduce the sugar content of each cookie).  Worked out great.  Next time, I’ll try a different extract for a different flavor. This time I used vanilla on my cream cheese cut out cookies and they’re awesome. Thanks!

This is the only sugar cookie icing I will ever need. This only change I make is that I use clear vanilla instead of almond extract, mainly because that's what I have in my cabinet.

I’ve made this three times and the ingredients as listed never make a useable icing. I have to increase the milk and corn syrup.  Once I do that it works great and tastes great if you like almond flavouring.

I absolutely love this recipe. I made and decorated cookies for the first time as a trial for my sons birthday. They turned out AMAZING!!! I was able to bag them within 30 minutes. The icing is tasty, dries fast, and easy to make.

I like this icing  and use it quite often, but does this dry blotchy for anyone else?  I have this problem with this and other similar recipes. I’ve tried thick and thin consistsancy but can’t seem to get it quite right. I’m sure it’s just something I’m missing.

Easy to squirt from a bag to decorate. Dries hard. My flavoring was a bit yellow so when I tried to tint it blue it came out greenish.

I loved this recipe. I made it to decorate cookies with grandchildren. We used pastry paint brushes and added extra corn syrup to each color as needed to thin out.  The icing dried to a beautiful shine. Will definitely keep using this recipe. I especially loved not having to use egg whites or expensive meringue powder.

Easy to make and apply to the cookies. It made normal sugar cookie icing. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp of butter to it to give it a better taste.

This recipe is horrible! Not enough liquid and it came out as a giant dry ball of  sugar. Even after I followed the recipe exactly twice. After I added more milk it came to the right consistency, but tasted really bad.

I added some fresh squeezed orange juice to it. It didn’t affect the shine or consistency and added a nice scent-though it didn’t change the flavor. 
It was easy to make, but it dries fairly quickly if you are painting with it. You have to keep stirring to make sure it doesn’t dry up. Next time I will pipe it rather than paint it. 
Leaves a nice shine.

This is a fantastic recipe!!! Icing is perfect not too hard but hard enough to stack them. The colors stay well, it has a shine even after drying and it isn't runny. The only thing I changed was I had to add a little more milk in the beginning or else it just looked like Styrofoam balls instead or creamy. But other than that perfect!!

Had to double the milk for the right consistency... but I didn’t care for the taste of the milk- tasted too much like powdered sugar but LOVED using half & half (doubled that as well). It was PERFECTION!!!

When I make it again I will use van extract. The almond to me gave it a strange aftertaste.   I had to use much more milk and corn syrup to make it work but they turned out very pretty.

I agree with another reviewer in that the icing looks really great on the cookies but the taste is not good at all.  I’d rather have the taste and forgo the presentation if it comes to that.

This icing is perfect! I am no baker and a novice cook all around. I was nervous when I was invited to a Christmas cookie party and volunteered to bring the icing and decorations. This recipe saved me! I followed it to a tee (at first) and then started getting less accurate with the measuring (I made about 12 different colors of icing and re-made this recipe many times). It was perfect despite the slight variations. I did find I needed a bit more milk to get the confectioners' sugar smooth, but the other ingredients were right on the mark. It looked great in various colors and tastes phenomenal. This will be my go-to icing recipe! Thanks!

Perfect sugar cooking icing that gets nice and shiny, spreads easily and tastes amazing. And when icing dries, cookies are stack-able to store or gift.

Much better and easier to work with than royal icing although I found it takes a bit longer to harden.  This will be my go-to cookie icing going forward.

Good recipe. I love the way it dried into a hard shell. The only thing I found wrong with this recipe was that it took way more corn syrup and milk than what it originally called for.

A little difficult to get right. I added a bit more milk to smooth out, and skipped the almond extract (in my opinion gave a bit of a bitter taste - perhaps add less if you still want the flavor). One recipe only yields about a half-cup of icing, so if you want to add colors, 1 drop is fairly sautated. I made several batches to get the colors lighter, and just kept stirring in more milk and corn syrup until I got the consistency I was looking for!

Excellent for sugar cookies!  Can make it a touch thicker for piping or add a few more drops of milk for flooding.  Works great for both techniques.  Firms up nicely for stacking or storing - but stays soft enough for a nice tender bite.  If you're looking for gingerbread icing -- this is not the one  :)

This icing was perfect! The almond extract was an unexpected pleasure. I was really hesitant in adding it but I’m so glad I did. I received so many compliments on the al of flavor. I wouldn’t change a thing!

I used honey to substitute the light corn syrup and vanilla extract instead of almond. It was a good consistency and tasted very sweet. To make it a lighter consistency, I added 1/2 teaspoon more milk to create a drizzle effect.

Great recipe, but had to at least triple the recipe to get enough. I also eventually just started dumping the powdered sugar in the bowl and adding a little milk and corn syrup until it was the thickness and taste i wanted. I DID NOT however add anymore almond extract as it is very strong. cookies turned out amazing tho but i wouldn't follow it exactly.

I've used this for a few years now and couldn't believe I hadn't rated it yet. I love the way it holds up on the cookie. I love the taste of it, I also love the taste of a bit of flavoring in it, however I discovered my grand children did not like the flavoring, especially if it was almond. Just letting you know my experience. Today I use it on my gingerbread men for our family Christmas party (no flavoring in it).

Loved finding an easy frosting recipe that came together easily and looks like the pro’s make it. I used milk in one batch and vanilla soy in another (for the non-dairy option), and both came out beautifully.  I found I had to double the batch in order to have enough to frost all the cookies from the sugar cookie recipe I used.  I did not measure the milk - I poured until I had the consistency I wanted.  I also do not have frosting supplies, so used sandwich bags and cut VERY small holes in them to squeeze the frosting out of.  Worked perfectly!

I substituted vanilla extract for almond extract and added milk a little extra milk as others suggested. This came out great. Great flavor, simple, foolproof. This will be my new go to recipe for cookie icing. It seems pretty solid and easy to tweak for different consistencies and flavors.

I have to make a quadruple batch for my cookie recipe but oh so good. I make it a little runnier so the icing coats the whole cookie and isn't too thick and gooey.  The compliments are well worth the time it takes to make these.

Love! I skipped the corn syrup and instead made my own sugar syrup by boiling 1 1/4 C sugar and 3/4 C water, stirring until smooth and letting it cool while I made the rest.

It worked great with my two year old granddaughter. She had fun making a mess decorating cookies. I will definitely use it again and hopefully she will be able do a neater job next time.

These cookies were easy to roll out and handle. They tasted great just plain and were easier than recipes I have done in the past. I made the dough the night before to have fun rolling, cutting, and frosting.

Tried this tonight,  perhaps I'm not a fan of icing because I found this to be way too sweet.  My family did not care for the almond flavor either.  I guess it worked well for the point of decorating cookies.

My first successful cookie icing! I always seem to fail st this, but this recipe turned out perfect! Don’t be afraid to add more milk, etc if your consistency doesn’t match the video. I did have to add more than required but it turned out great by just watching the video and trying to match their finished consistency.

added a little extra cornstarch and milk because it was a little too thick. Once I did that it was awesome. A great alternative to Royal Icing for kids!

This icing is so good. It is thick and delicious. I substituted the milk for almond milk and didn't add the almond extract. You could not taste the difference. #BestIcingEver

This was a good frosting!  I had to add extra milk and one batch didn't make much, but that's no big deal.  it really made the cookies look nice and my picky daughter liked it!  I think I found my new go to cookie frosting!  Than you for sharing!

Great icing recipe, but I don't like the smell or flavor of almond extract... for me, it brings back bad memories of an occasion when I drank too much amaretto... LOL... I did use almond, as suggested. Everyone else enjoyed the flavor, so I guess it really was just me. 
I think I will try another extract for flavor next time. I think lemon or vanilla would be fabulous. I love the consistency, and the way the icing dries so shiny. This is a great recipes, and it will become my standard for decorating cookies. Thank you!!

Not a huge fan of iced cookies, but needed something to perk up some cut-outs.  This is super easy and very tasty!  Able to spread immediately after making (added a little extra milk to get to desired consistency), and didn't harden rock-solid.  Thanks for sharing!

Just made this icing to frost cookies! I had to add a bit more milk but this icing hardened very quickly similar to royal icing and much easier to make!  Spread the icing with a very thin offset spatula and it worked beautifully!

Looked great on my gingerbread cookies and tasted great! Do NOT leave it for any amount of time. Keep stirring. I screwed up my first batch because I left the milk in the sugar without stirring it while I opened the corn syrup. After I figured that out, it worked great!

This is a great simple and fast recipe. I thought the flavor was fine. I think I will experiment with some different flavors though. I used vanilla instead of almond extract on the first batch. I did have to add more milk a little bit at a time to get it to mix to the right consistency. I was able to both flood using a knife and pipe with a bottle. It did start to harden up on me after doing about a dozen. You just need to add a few drops of liquid to loosen. I really enjoyed the bright shiny smooth look I achieved with this recipe. This will be a keeper for me.

It’s a good base recipe. I live in high desert (5,000 ft elevation), and I really had to fiddle with the thickness to get the correct consistency. Add more powdered sugar to thicken, more milk to thin. I also swapped out vanilla extract for almond, since my kiddo is allergic. The taste is wonderful, much better than egg-white based royal icing.

I used this recipe twice. Once I used almon extract and the other I used vanilla. I prefer the vanilla. The icing worked and hardened perfectly.

Works perfectly ONLY IF you spoon and level your powdered sugar. The old scooping technique compacts the sugar and would lead to you needing more milk/corn syrup to loosen. Go ahead and add the milk and corn syrup at the same time, it will come together easy for you!

Great recipe! It dried nice and had a beautiful shine.  I doubled the recipe exactly as shown... then made another singular recipe to tint black for hats and buttons.. had enough icing to do about 80 snowmen.  I made it a little thinner with syrup and milk on the doubled batch in order to be able to dip all the cookies before decorating. Definitely a keeper! Must say the icing doesn't have a spectacular taste when licking the spoon, but is perfect for a sugar cookie.

This was very easy. I needed a little extra milk to get the right consistency, but other than that it worked great. I spread it around on the cookie with a child's paint brush. It dried within an hour, but it depends on how much you put on. From now on I will always use this glaze to ice my cutout cookies.

I use this recipe every year and it is perfect. I can even freeze it. I will say that I do add more milk then the recipe calls for. Not quite double but almost.

This icing was easy and good. It dried just hard enough. I substituted honey for the corn syrup. It worked well.

I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup. Came out nice, but it was not enough to ice all of my cookies, so next time I'll have to tripple it or make 3 batches. Don't let it sit for too long, it will start to dry up on you.

I wanted to home make icing because My friends kids love to cook and they love cook! But when we made cookies, cakes and cupcakes or muffins they could not do much so when we made stuff they where very sad. But when I showed them this they where so happy!!! Thank you so much!

I used a standard egg-white royal icing for edging and lines, so I don't know how this one compares for piping.  I used this one for flooding, and it worked very well.  Royal icing goes matte when it dries, but this stays shiny.  I used some cointreau instead of milk to thin it, which worked well (makes it dairy-free).  The drying time was very long.  They took overnight to fully harden, so plan accordingly.  I'm glad other reviewers mentioned this.

This is a wonderful icing! It has just the right amount of sweetness. I put mine in squeeze bottles, meant for candy making, and they worked wonderfully to decorate with. The icing sets up quite quickly, as well.

Will definitely make again. We piped them from bags instead of a paint brush. It’s very thick and was difficult to pipe but worth the cramped hands. To smooth out the cookies we tapped the icing with damp fingers, they looked amazing. I gave it 4 stars because it’s very thick, even after adding more syrup and milk it was more like an outlining icing. Dries shiny and tasted great with the almond extract. If you watch the video she put a lot more liquid in than the recipe stated, her measuring was very generous, I think that’s why the video version was more fluid than mine. I won’t go back to merengue powder again.

There is something incredibly wrong this recipe. It was more  like brick mortar than frosting. I believe the milk should be 2 tablespoons not teaspoons. Luckily I was able save it. But there's a big difference between a teaspoon and a tablespoon.

I used about 4 teaspoons of milk and it really wasn't liquidy. I tried adding more corn syrup when it was too thick, but that didn't help, so milk worked. I recommend working fast because the icing starts to harden and form a shell if you use it too slowly. I ended up making a triple batch to ice all my cookies

Usually I just use a can of pre-made icing for sugar cookies - -but found this recipe and hoped it would make piling cookies up work better.  It was great.  Icing is very shiny, and dries hard enough on surface to carefully pile them up.  Love the almond flavor.  Going to pass this recipe to all in my family!

I liked the flavor as long as I remembered to use vanilla extract instead of almond.  I found that I had to adjust the amount of syrup as well as milk in order to get it to a smoother and more flowing consistency, otherwise it was extremely hard to put it into the pastry bags and use.  I blamer this on the climate I live in ... North Texas is very dry this time of year.  Otherwise, a great recipe.

Followed this recipe exactly. Perfect for decorating cookies. The almond extract could be replaced with another flavor or vanilla, but almond extract gave it a pleasant taste. As I worked with it, it started to harden up so I mixed in an additional drop or 2 of milk to keep it at my preferred consistency. The icing on the cookies hardened up in about 60-90 minutes so they could be stacked without destroying the artwork on the cookie.

I made this, I would recommend doubling the recipe though to have enough icing for all the cookies. I added more milk and corn syrup to get the right texture, and used vanilla extract instead of almond. It turned out really good!

I prefer this icing to royal icing with meringue powder when it comes to flooding sugar cookies. It tastes good, is easy to use and dries evenly and with a nice shine. It's no good for the royal icing decorations since it always flattens out, so I usually use both kinds of my sugar cookies. Thanks so much for sharing!

I had never made this kind of icing before, so it was disconcerting when the proportions in the recipe gave me powdered sugar crumbles, not a smooth icing.  After reading the reviews, it seems 2 teaspoons of milk is good for some people but not others. I increased the milk a half teaspoon at a time until I got a consistency that could be easily spread in a thin layer, ending up with about 4 teaspoons. Icings and frostings are always a balancing act, so I don't think this is a fault in the recipe.  I would NOT recommend increasing the corn syrup like the recipe suggests unless you want chewy icing that takes forever to harden. Mine took about 90 minutes to harden enough to be  stackable. I love the almond flavor, and two batches of icing did about 60 3" pumpkin shaped cookies. I also needed black frosting for bats and cats.  Instead of trying to achieve this with food color, I added a tablespoon of dark cocoa powder and an additional half teaspoon of milk for a dark brown chocolate icing. Tasted a little cocoa-y, but it looked great and hardened well.

Super easy, especially in a mixer. I used Vanilla instead of Almond extract.  It's a wee bit thin when applying to cookies , so I just drizzled it on after coloring it.  Takes a couple hours to become hard on the cookies and tastes better the day after, but this will be my go to recipe when I need icing not frosting for cookies. I used this on the soft sugar cookie recipe, together they are wonderful and don't last long. ;)

Great icing! I was hesitant at first because they did not look very good but the icing set up nicely. I had to add more milk than written, no biggie. Add the milk a little at a time to get the consistency you prefer. I used almond extract this time but I've used vanilla, rum, lemon & mint in the past and all work just as well. . Use any  flavoring you prefer, this recipe is versatile. . I also use gel food coloring and the colors came out beautifully! Great recipe! Thank you!!

Great recipe. I replaced the almond extract for vanilla bc I didn’t really care for the almond flavor. I also used gel flavoring for my bright white icing bc the vanilla extract turns the icing to a bit of a beige color.

I had to add a little extra milk to make it into the smooth consistency it stated it should have before adding the corn syrup.  But it hardened VERY nicely, and my cookies look amazing, and taste GREAT!  :)  I multiplied the recipe by 7, two separate times, as I was making cookies for my daughter's grad party.  The 2nd time I ran out of corn syrup, so I made the simple syrup as others suggested - 1 1/4 c. sugar and 1/3 c. water boiled, and added that to the corn syrup I had left.  (I did not need all of the syrup I made...)  They still turned out great!

This icing is the BEST icing for Sugar cookies. It makes beautiful cookies if piping the icing on. However, it is not an icing that quickly dries.  I leave my cookies air dry for 10 hours or so before storing them away in the freezer (the icing will stick to other cookies if it is not fully dry if you are stacking them away).

This icing looked nice and had added a nice flavor to my sugar cookies.  The icing hardened making storage a breeze. I used vanilla extract instead of almond due to a nut allergy in my household.

I think the recipe should have read 2 Tbsp each of Karo syrup and milk! However, after that change it turned out fine. Add more powdered sugar as needed to thicken if you are going to pipe the icing.

I like the shine and the taste but when doubling the recipe I do not also double the almond extract because it is already such a strong flavor that you will still feel it's flavor. I have tried substituting vanilla extract out of curiosity but honestly didn't like how it tasted in comparison to the almond. Personally I found it a little too thick to work with and so I usually have to play around with the amount of milk and corn syrup I use. It does dry down but if you are going to put these in a ziplock or a container just be aware the warmth can make the cookies stick a bit ruining your decoration but if it's just for sitting in a plate at home it's great.

I love this icing! I did what another user suggested, instead of corn syrup, boil together sugar and water. I used 1 1/4 cup water and 1/3 cup sugar in the raw. And added about two tablespoons of honey. I definitely used more than two tablespoons of the syrup for my icing though to make it smooth.

Great base recipe, though I had to add quite a bit more milk - over double the suggested amount. I also substituted vanilla for the almond extract. The result is always gorgeous though once you get the right consistency - dries nicely with a beautiful sheen, hard enough to stack after about a day, but not at all too hard. Always gets great reviews!

I do like this recipe, but I find that 2 teaspoons of milk is way-hay-hay too little! It barely gets the icing sugar wet! I have to jig around with the recipe every time I make it. When I manage to get it right, it's like magic how easy it is to paint on and how it stays put just right.

This icing recipe turned out great! I tweaked it only slightly to change the consistency so I could create a border and then subsequently 'flood' the center. I also left out the almond extract, just for personal taste preference. I will use this recipe over and over again!

Perfect icing. I didn't realize I was out of corn syrup so I used maple syrup. I can't get enough of this icing. The almond extract makes them irresistible.

First time using this icing, it worked fine for the project I was doing. I added orange flavoring,almond flavoring & used almond milk. It was a really good combo my family loved the taste with the cookies I made. I will be using it again to make football cookies for the super bowl! You many have to add more liquid depending on the constiency you need.

The almond extract I have is red so I couldn't change the color of my icing. I used vanilla for the second batch and was able to use multiple colors. We personally like the flavor of the vanilla better. Definitely a keeper.

I doubled the recipe.  With that said, I still increased  the corn syrup and almond extract per batch.  It hardened nicely and quickly.  Storing the iced cookies was great. They did not stick together.
This was an excellent recipe. I will definitely use it again

My 10-year-old used this icing recipe to top the "Cracked Sugar Cookies 1" she made. The addition of the almond extract made such a difference. This was her first time baking and decorating cookies solo. The combination of the cookie and icing recipes were a hit.

I have used this recipe a few times.  As others have pointed out, you will need to add more milk than it calls for.  I end up adding a little milk and a little syrup until the consistency is right.  I love the hard glossy finish and the almond flavor.  It is probably really good with lemon too.

I made ten pounds of this icing in all colors for a cookie making session with 10 teens.  I tripled the batches and I bought squeeze bottles  for 1.00 each and loaded them up.  The icing was easy to work with and the kids made 400 beautiful cutouts for the homeless.  Icing dried quickly, was easy to make , and the flavor is good.

I found that the ratios were off - maybe it was because I was using the dough hook in a stand mixer. The icing was way too thick until I added more corn syrup and milk. Once it was thin enough to spread, though, it tasted fine and hardened quickly.

Great recipe! We had to use a little extra milk, but it was great! Would make again.

I don't know if it was because of the weather, but I added an extra tsp of syrup to get the consistency I thought I needed.  It worked out great.  I will use this recipe every time.

2 teaspoons of milk and 2 teaspoons of light corn syrup is NOT enough liquid for a full cup of powdered sugar. 2 tablespoons worked well, though. I tried it with vanilla extract and eggnog instead of milk and almond extract, and it was quite tasty!

Nice shine on the icing. I had to add quite a bit of extra milk and corn syrup to get to a spreadable consistency. I found I had to work very quickly to add sprinkles or the icing was too set and they simply rolled off. HOWEVER, they take several hours to harden to a stackable finish.

* I did NOT make changes to this recipe* 
I let butter come to room temp, I never microwave it ( texture is too different)
I use the Kitchen-Aid to cream the butter and sugar until "fluffy" 
States 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness, I did 1/2 and they backed nice and large. I also use the head space/air remover stick that comes in a canning kit to check that they were correct thickness and even. 
Icing was also easy and turned out great. 
These were made for us and of course Santa....Happy Cooking!

I wanted to love this recipe, but it was overly powder-y tasting and it didn't dry as well as I'd hoped. That glossy finish I was expecting turned crystallized, but didn't harden. I did like the almond flavor though.

This recipe went really well with the sugar cookies that I prepared but you have to frost them in advance. Otherwise you can't eat the cookies without spilling frosting all over the place! But if you frost the cookies about 20 minutes beforehand the frosting is wonderful!!! Also, one thing that I did was use vanilla extract which worked amazing, if you don't like almond flavor or don't have any almond extract, then you can use any extract! Overall, I really liked this recipe and I'm glad that I found it.

This is okay, the only thing I didn't use was the almond extract I did not have any so I used vanilla extract.  I feel it was too tick because of that it was hard to spread on the cookies.

This may be a good recipe but what is needed for this recipe is some tips on method for those of us that are very beginning entry level bakers.  I asked a friend who gave me some tips.  It is a temperamental process to get it just right to work with.  The first run was really powdery and the second run was too stiff.

It tasted good but the recipe made a very small amount...maybe 1/2 cup? I was hosting a cookie decorating party so I ended up in the kitchen making several batches of this frosting. The icing consistently was good for piping and took the food dye well. Spread easily, too. I would make it again but really increase the ingredients in order to decorate several dozen cookies with various colored icings.

Taste was fine, I switched almond with vanilla extract. Texture works best for spreading; it's too thick for piping, and if you try to pipe with normal plastic bags you may end up bursting holes in the bags. I probably won't use this recipe again; I prefer a lighter icing, most likely something with whipped egg whites would be more the texture I'm looking for.

Perfect, delicious, shiny icing. I read reviews and made sure to add milk first, and gradually add in sugar. I increased the milk by 1 tsp to thin it out a bit more. I didn't find that the icing got hard as I worked. I had multiple bowls of icing out for at least an hour, and I just needed to stir them periodically. This is my new go to icing.

The icing was easy enough for me and my granddaughters (5&2) to make together. I found with small children, it was easier to use like " finger paint". They enjoyed more it and it looked better than the ones they did using a brush.

I made this Icing it definitely needed a lil bit more milk so I did 4tsp milk and a lil more light corn syrup. It was a good texture after that and was able to paint the cookies added desired food coloring. Cookies had a nice shine . Gave it a 3 cause the measurements don't work.

This was beautiful and delicious. I loved the almond flavor. I'm a novice when it comes to making icing and this was easy for me. I needed 4 tsp of corn syrup to get the thickness correct. I used a silicone basting brush to paint it on the sugar cookies which was perfect. My only critique is that I only ended up with enough icing for 20 small sugar cookies with only one application. Some could have used two applications ( ie, white color)

I didn't think I could actually make sugar cookie icing, but this recipe was easy and great, even for someone who's never made it before. This tasted good and looked beautiful. I was worried because I didn't have any kind of brush to brush this on, but the back of a spoon worked just fine. Great recipe!

Excellent cookies.  Do add 2 tsp of vanilla and extra sugar and flour as others indicated and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and you will have no problems.  I used flour for the rolling process.  there is a lot of good advice in reviews so not sure how anyone would make a recipe without reading them. Will definitely make again. I used regular cake frosting and they turned out super yummy

I made the first batch as it directed.... it turned out way too thick and no matter how many times I kept adding more Karo syrup it still was too thick... I gave up and just used it as the icing... I thought I did something wrong so because it didn't make much at all I made another batch.. same thing.. it was at night I gave up and thought I'd look for a different recipe tomorrow.. after searching they were pretty much all the same recipes so I came back to this one decided to read the reviews I did what someone said and it turned out amazing ! I will go to this this icing everytime now..... what I did was add 4tablespoons of milk (into a cup cuz I noticed it needs to be a quick process cuz the milk disappears quickly, so as I had the mixer ready and in hand I poured the milk in and immediately beat it on low, after I put 1 table spoon of vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of light Karo syrup and blended that on low... it was perfect!! Thank you!

The icing turned out nice but you have to play around with the corn syrup and milk amount to get the consistency you desire.

These were some of the most simple yet most delicious sugar cookies I have made.  I let the dough chill for at least 4-5 hours.  I sectioned of pieces and kept the rest of the dough in the fridge until needed.  I also cut the sugar by 1/2 a cup.  The dough was so easy to roll out and they were perfect.  I will definitely be using this recipe from now on.

This is an excellent icing for cookies.  The icing hardened nicely so that I could stack them and was shiny.
I changed the almond extract to vanilla and added just a little more, because I love vanilla flavoring.
For those that do not like the taste, I would follow the suggestion of another reviewer, and make a sugar/water syrup.
Finally, didn't mind adding more milk than the recipe calls for, because I could add milk to get the icing to the consistency that I want depending on how I am decorating.
I will definitely save this recipe and use it again.

Best gingerbread house icing ever!!!   I usually do three batches of this each year whenever we get all the kids together for decorating the houses I do vanilla, almond and lemon, that are all fabulous and  I just use regular corn syrup too.

12 1 16 http://allrecipes.com/recipe/11587/sugar-cookie-icing/ ... I'm sure I made this & pretty sure I reviewed it; but it isn't showing.  I happen to stumble upon it while searching in "The Buzz" ... 
BOOKMARKER 1.58K Rep. 1 year Ago... Marie suggested these cookies from King Arthur; Nanny, this icing. Separately, I wasn’t so sure we had a hit tastewise; together, oh my! I used marshmallow slices then blue M & Ms, then black gel for pupils (& eyelashes). Pretty cute. Thank you both very much! :)

If I could give this recipe a negative amount of stars, I most certainly would give this one a negative billion number of stars.  This recipe is a ridiculous joke...the wet ingredients could never under any real or imagined circumstances EVER get the amount of confectioner sugar in this recipe to any spreadable consistency!  Such an aggravating waste of time, ingredients & energy making this icing.  I cannot believe that allrecipes would even let this recipe be on this site...YES, it is THAT bad, that COMPLETELY destined for failure with endless tweaking to try and salvage it.  Do yourself a favor and RUN (don't walk) away from this recipe...it is a ridiculous, untested, non-working COMPLETE disaster that WILL happen if you follow the ingredients and directions as listed!  :-{

I did exactly what the recipe said, and it came out perfect. The second time I used this, I made it but couldn't ice the same day. It kept well in the fridge and thawing the next day made it the right consistency again... looove this and will definitely be using again and again!

I used this along with the Allrecipes The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie recipe and they were perfect! I did have to add a bit more milk. It does start to harden fast and it is faster with a partner to help. But I iced my cookies at 7:30pm and by 11pm they were firm enough to stack. Kids loves them this is a saved and repeat recipe. I'd also like to add that I did use vanilla instead of almond.

There's NO way you would be able to "dip" or "brush" on this icing using the exact measurements listed. though so I'll definitely be giving this recipe another try...just with added milk.

This photo of cookies you have here is a little misleading. Those cookies have at least two different kinds of glaze/icing and also appear to have been airbrushed. Don't get me wrong, they're beautiful cookies, but a photo is needed that shows the icing for this recipe so that we can get an idea of what the finished product will look like in the real world. Thanks!

If you want it thinned I added a little more milk instead of corn syrup so would not be overly sweet.

Perfect consistency of what I was looking for! The recipe call for simple ingredients. I love this frosting and I can put whatever extract I want. Even pumpkin extract for my pumpkin cookies!

This was amazing. It was my first time dealing with royal icing.  I used it for cake decoration and I loved the ease of the recipe.  I did not have cream of tartar and I did not want to use egg whites.  I am so glad this recipe worked out.  I cannot wait to try it on cookies.

I don't use corn syrup. I used tart cherry juice from trader joe's instead. It turned a lovely light pink and tasted great.

The icing was very thick. If you want to get the most from this recipe, be prepared to add a little milk until it is the desired consistency. I was actually able to get great icing by just eyeballing it with the ingredients.

You wont find a better recipe for glossy, hard, colourful sugar cookie icing. I skip the almond extract but do add 1 tsp of vanilla - except when I want White-colored icing, then I don't add any extract as it will discolour it. You may also need to add extra milk (add 1 tsp at a time) until you have the desired consistency. I use this with my kids whenever they need sugar cookies for a school event because they dry firm and will be stackable/transportable without comprimising our artistic work! Not the best tasting, but definitely the best for decorating with. Icing dries fast so be sure to add sprinkles quickly after application.

Instead of almond extract I used 2x the amount of vanilla extract. I also used 4 teaspoons of milk instead of 2. When you get proportions right, it's a good recipie.

I could not smooth out 1 cup of confectioner's sugar with 2 tsp of milk. Adding the corn syrup to the confectioner's sugar mix left me with lumpy icing. Won't make again.

Soooo easy to make and the finished product is amazing!  The icing dries to a nice hard shiny glaze.  You can stack your finished cookies and they don't stick!   I use a rolled sugar cookie recipe that is not overly sweet so this icing provides the perfect balance!

Awesome!! Made my icing slightly a bit thinner and dipped the tops of the sugar cookie into them. I then decorated with sprinkles and let them set up. Will def use this again, every year, with my sugar cookies. Neat thing is, you change the flavor you add to change them up a bit (almond, peppermint, lemon, etc). I left mine white since I was adding colored christmas sprinkles but adding food coloring would be nice too.

The first time, following the recipe exactly, the icing was extremely viscous. The second time, I increased the amounts of both milk and corn syrup by around 75%, which was a little too much, and the icing was quite runny. The flavour both times was excellent, giving it a slight almond flavor. Pairing it with plain sugar cookies went quite well.

I made a huge batch. Maybe 10 cups of sugar. Came out awesome! Even the sloppiest spreading job comes out beautifully smooth and shiny. And dries nicely, not crunchy.

I have made this many times and I personally like the flavor and so does my family.  I would however make a slight change to this recipe, I would make the milk 2-3 teaspoons because the 2 teaspoons of milk the recipe calls for doesn't get the mixture to be a smooth consistency.  One other change I would make would be that you can use vanilla extract or almond extract, I have tried them both and they both taste great.  Other than those small things this recipe is very good and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a sugar cookie icing recipe.  I will defiantly be using this recipe again.

I don't normally rate things, but this needed it.  Following the directions exactly, it tasted like straight Powdered Sugar.  And it was hard enough I would only use it as glue for a Gingerbread house..   I needed something a little thinner than my go-to buttercream, but in the end I just ended up adding more milk to my trusted buttercream recipe rather than use this disaster of a cookie frosting.

This was my first time making the icing. I added two more teaspoons of milk and got the right consistency I needed. I did not get fancy with the icing, I just spread it on with a knife and added sprinkles. I would use the recipe again!

I didn't have the syrup so I used honey. It was so simple to make & yummy! My children decorated sugar cookies. This batch was for 12 cookies, but my boys decorated 24 cookies with it.

This icing recipe is frustrating and amazing! You make it and think .. "Well that's hardly any frosting at all!" So then you go and double it and it must thicken or something because I had around 50 large sugar cookies and I only used maybe HALF of the icing I made! The recipe is frustrating because it's SO thick, even when more corn syrup is added. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's painting the icing on that's difficult. It looks kind of gross when painted on and all brush-strokey but when it sets and dries, it's smooth and pretty! So it's a really deceiving icing when first- you think there's not enough and then second- it goes on streaky but it's a great recipe when you want icing that will STAY the way you paint it on. Plus and minuses while creating and using it but finished product gets an A+

Levels out and stays shiny.  I made this a dozen times and now cut the almond  extract to 1/8th TSP so there is a hint of almond without overpowering the cookie.  I NEVER got a cup of powdered sugar to beat smooth with only 2 tspn's of milk,  and use 3 tspn milk with 2-3 tspn corn syrup.

I live in a fairly high altitude and dry place (aka Alberta Canada) and I made this during the dry season. The recipe worked after adding extra milk and syrup until it was the right consistency.

My go-to recipe for cookie icing. It tastes amazing and is easy to decorate with (and I love how it dries smooth and shiny). Use it on cookies that aren't super sweet for a perfect balance. My Christmas cookies are always a huge hit at work potlucks and family get togethers and I always have to share this recipe with a few people at every event. I will never use another recipe for icing. Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  I made this for the first time while making Christmas cookie gifts. I wanted a pretty, tasty and stack-able icing to decorate with and this one fits the order perfectly.  I read several reviews and did add about 1/2 tsp more milk and 1/2 each of almond extract and vanilla extract.  It tastes great and dries quickly.  If you are doing layers this works well when adding additional colors.

This tastes terrible.  Followed the recipe and it was so thick.  Didn't even worry about thinning it with a little more milk.  I don't care what it has the potential to look like, if it's gross what is the point of putting it on cookies.

Am I missing something? I followed this recipe TO A TEE and it came out looking nothing like icing. I added the corn syrup to loosen it up but it didn't work. So I added some more milk- almost two more teaspoons- and finally got it to the right consistency.

What a wonderful icing recipe! You can flavor the icing with any extract flavor including the unusual ones found at the baking supply stores.  I did find out that I had to thin the consistency out a bit with a little bit of additional milk & Karo syrup which can be added 1 teaspoon each at a  time  until you find the consistency you like.  

As a quickie tip: you can load the icing into small zip lock baggies and cut a tiny hole in the corner to pipe on your frosting. No mess and you can toss out the bag when you're done!

If you're adding sprinkles, they need to be added after Icing each cookie as the icing dries fairly quickly.

 Thank you very much to the creator of this recipe!

I have used this recipe for several years now.  I would never use anything else.  I did have to add a little more milk and corn syrup to make it spreadable.  I didn't have any trouble coloring it.  I even got a red red with liquid food coloring!

The frosting was too stiff and not spreadable.  I changed it a bit and it came out perfect.  I used 3 tsp milk and 3 tsp corn syrup instead of two.  And I added 1/2 tsp vanilla instead of the almond flavoring since I don't like almond.  With these modifications it was great.  I will definitely use this again.  Dried nicely so I could stack the cookies, colors were very bright with the liquid food coloring I used.

The icing was very VERY thick. Almost too thick to spoon. You absolutely need to add extra milk a tablespoon at a time. It did dry quicker than I expected but the taste wasn't to my liking. It was very sweet.

I didn't realize I was out of corn syrup, so I substituted honey and it turned out amazing!  I also only had vanilla extract, no almond.  I just stirred the ingredients all together and had great results.  Super excited with this simple recipe!

Great recipe but I put the required amount of milk and it was definitely not enough. I had to put a bit more milk in. And I found it hard to colour. Maybe because of the corn syrup which colours it a little yellowy. I had to add a lot of red to get the right shade of red. It is a nice icing on the cookies.

I used vanilla extract as I don't really care for the taste of almond extract and the flavor was so good.  I always sift the powdered sugar for this kind of icing to eliminate any chance of lumps.  What I like is how this icing dries hard but not like brick hard.  It's just right.  It's nice and smooth without being watery and goes through the icing bag perfectly.  Keeper recipe, thank you!

This is a good glaze recipe. Reading how others complained about no taste, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and reduced the milk by that amount. It worked. Tasted great.

The recipe says 1 tsp of milk added to 1 cup of confectioner sugar and mix until smooth.  One tsp of milk does not even come close to combining with one cup of icing sugar!  It took 4 tsp like one other person posted.  Being the first step in a recipe I wish that the steps would be accurate so that they don't have to be adjusted right off the hop.

After thorough mixing, 2 teaspoons each of milk and corn syrup and one cup of powdered sugar resulted in a bowl full of lumpy powdered sugar. I had to add another teaspoon each of the milk and syrup before it suddenly became icing. I used skim milk - maybe that was the difference? It turned out great in the end, though!

Other than adding fresh lemon juice to thin it out and make it more flavourful, I wouldn't change a thing. The icing dried quickly and was very easy to work with. Use fresh powdered sugar to avoid an off taste in your icing.

My only issue is that the recommendation is to add corn syrop if icing is too thick. You should add milk to thin, as adding the syrop is counterproductive. The syrop is just providing that high gloss finish. 
Other than that I use this recipe on my iced cookies.

Ok - I absolutely love this icing. However, I've only giving it 3 stars because the 2 tsp. of milk listed in the recipe is not nearly enough. Just continue to add until you get the right consistency. Otherwise, this is fantastic icing. It isn't too sweet, and it looks great once it dries.

I love this! I took the advice of another user and used 4 teaspoons of milk. I used almond extract but I want to try vanilla next time. I didn't have food coloring so I decided to put rainbow sprinkles while the icing was still wet. I'm so thrilled with how they turned out!

Great recipe. For those who detest almond flavoring (it tastes nothing like almonds, have no idea why it has that name)-- use vanilla or, like me this time, peppermint extract (Seasonal.)

I love this icing and have used it for years.  Looks great and gets lot's of compliments when I take cookies to a gathering.  The only thing I do differently is to add 1 tbs of soft butter, 1/4 tsp of vanilla, as well as the almond extract to give it more flavor. Thin with milk as needed.

This is a great classic recipe. Whenever I've needed a quick icing before, I've used powdered sugar and milk. The vanilla gives it a nice flavor and the corn syrup really does give it a beautiful gloss. I do find that I need to add little more milk than the recipe calls for.  My daughter loves mixing in the food coloring to make different colors and then decorating the cookies.

I used this recipe to decorate Halloween cookies. Everyone thought the cookies were store bought! 
I did have to add more milk than called for; it took a bit of experimenting, by adding milk to thin or more sugar to thicken, to get the right consistency so it was easy to dip the cookies and not have it drip down the sides. I used snack size ziploc bags (cut a tiny corner off for the tip) for the decorating on top of the first layer, i.e.-eyes, skull faces, pumpkin stems.
I used regular food coloring and almond extract for chocolate icing on bats and cats, vanilla for the white icing on ghosts and skulls, and orange extract for the icing on the pumpkins. I already had all of these in my cupboard so had fun trying different things.  I might try lemon next time, bet that would be good.

Loved this recipe. So easy to make and work with. My 5 year had no problem icing his cookies he made. Almond extract really adds to the overall flavor to bring the cookie to the next level. Definitely using this recipe again.

first of all, one batch does NOT cover a dozen cookies.  i quadrupled the recipe and it barely did 20 of them, and that was after thinning the icing.  which brings me to my next point.  when i make it following the directions exactly, no matter if it is a single batch or enough for 100 cookies, it starts out as a ball, like it looks like a ball of cookie dough, and i have to keep adding more mild and syrup until it gets thin enough to make a solid covering with.  it does dry beautifully (if you are only using a single color anyways.  more than one color and you have to wait hours if you dont want them to bleed) and that is the only reason i keep coming back to it.

I like the recipe but if I decorate my cookies too far in advance, the icing dries out too much and it discolors.  If not for that, I'd give it 5 stars. Anyone else have this issue?  I make the recipe as written but using vanilla extract.  I don't like almond.

Added a little more milk for a more runny consistency so my two year old could easily paint the cookies. We had fun!

FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD ONE THAT ACTUALLY HARDENED!  I have been making cookies with Royal Icing for years, mostly for my kids to draw on with edible markers.  This is the first time I have had frosting that actually hardened and did not allow the markers to poke through AT ALL.  FYI - the first time I made it, I did not have corn syrup on hand, so I used maple syrup.  I also could not use almond extract because it was for school (no nuts) so I substituted vanilla extract instead.  That batch DID NOT harden all the way for 24 hours.  I did use corn syrup for the second and third batches (again with vanilla instead of almond extract) and those hardened within hours.  The kids loved the taste on our sugar cookies (as did the adults in the group)!  This one is a keeper.

This is a wonderful recipe,  especially when paired with the top rated sugar cookie recipe.  Absolutely amazing!  You can tweak the ingredients to make it as thick or thin as you want for all you icing and piping needs!  Excellent recipe!

I like to never got the icing to look like real icing.  It was so stiff and difficult to stir.  I was pretty frustrated.  There has to be something i did wrong.  Tasted good and spreads well finally.

Excellent! Used several times now on the Sugar Cookie Cutouts recipe on this site by GLJCAT and the two compliment one another beautifully, producing an attractive and tasty cookie that is not too sweet. Is now my go-to recipe.

Really like this.  We used mint extract as an option to almond or vanilla.  I did find the icing a bit stiff and hard to spread, but heating it up for a few seconds in the microwave made it spreadable - yet still able to harden.  Works well (even w/o heating) when using decorating syringe for details.  Best is the icing is hard enough to stack cookies, but not too hard to eat! yum!

This icing recipe results in crisp icing with an intermediary thickness, a nice sheen and a good, neutral flavor, if the following adjustments are made: measure the milk by sight, checking the consistency of the mixture (aiming to get it just out of the gluey stage) because two teaspoons simply will not be enough. And, to avoid conflicts with flavors of other cookies, if you are using these for cookies other than sugar cookies: omit the almond extract.

I didn't have corn syrup so I ised honey as a substitute. It made it extra sweet but it still set up nicely. This is simple, hardens beautifully and takes very well to food color. I use the paste but be sure to use very little! Thanks!

I used vanilla extract instead of almond extract. I had to double the milk and it was still thicker than I wanted it to be. All in all, a good base recipe, and with a bit of tweaking it was very good.

Excellent frosting recipe! Reminds me of my childhood and parents christmas cookies. I made a triple batch for a double batch of cut out cookies. We had just enough and the frosting held together really well while my kids took their time frosting the cookies. I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe.

I am in love with this recipe. We have made it several times. It shines up beautifully but hardens slightly. If it hardens too much for you just add a few more drops of corn syrup. We all loved the almond flavor. Five stars!

I used this on a sugar cookie recipe from all recipes and also on Martha Stewart's Gingerbread Snowflake. Worked like a charm. I started with the amounts from the recipe, but substituted the almond extract (allergic) for vanilla. Almost forgot to add in the extract, because the frosting tasted pretty good without it anyway! 
The consistency seemed too thick so i added about half teaspoon of milk and half teaspoon of corn syrup, stirred, then let it sit for about a minute and that was about right for me. If the frosting gets too runny, add about a teaspoon of icing sugar and keep stirring. The best part about this recipe is that the icing sugar dissolved really fast and there were no eggs! Totally kid and mum safe. 
I made one batch thicker than another batch so I could make lining (is that what its called?) icing and filling icing..

I did not think there was enough milk- wondering if it is truly 2 teaspoons. Ended up adding about double that and some vanilla extract  as well to help boost the flavor. This spread nicely on my Christmas cookies. I love the flavor and consistency and will use this in place of my old stand by.

The end result of this was great, but the recipe wasn't right. It required a lot more milk than called for. It looked nice and I enjoyed the flavour, but 3 stars because the milk was off by so much.

I'm rating this low, as I had to double the milk (increase it to 4 tsp) to have a workable icing.  As written, the recipe is way to dry to work with - so crumbly, that it required additional liquid.  With the increase in milk, it was perfect.  It dried shiny and smooth, and tasted great.

I couldn't blend the milk and sugar. I started out with milk and slowly adding the sugar. But still the more sugar I added, the drier it became and also, harder and harder to stir.

The taste is not that great. I couldn't get it on the cookies fast enough before it hardened.

This is a really great icing. It stuck to the cookie and the sprinkles stuck to it. Dried in about an hour and the sprinkles didn't fall off. If using a piping bag to apply, I would recommend leaving the icing on the thick side or else it comes out too fast.

I followed the recipe exactly and had to add 2 extra Tablespoons of milk for it to be a frosting consistency. The end product hardened up nice to be able to stack the cookies. Before we frosted the cookies I almost threw it away because we didn't like the taste, but it tasted pretty good on the cookies when they were done.

I had to add a little more milk than the recipe suggests but it turned out great! We had to double the recipe and then make another patch in order to cover all the cookies, though.

Made and iced sugar cookies for the first time, this glaze is great for decorating as it's adaptable to different consistencies for outlining and flooding. It dries very quickly, sets up nicely so that you can stack cookies, but doesn't turn your chewy sugar cookies to rock, if you know what I mean!

This frosting did not work at all.  Once the liquid was added to the 1 cup confect. sugar I had just 1/3 cup of frosting which was too stiff to spread.  Warming it made it spreadable but all the small lumps would not smooth out.

I had to add about 1-2Tbsp more of milk, but I love this recipe for cookies.  It doesn't separate like the recipes that include Crisco and milk.  Looks awesome on cookies, just like the photo shows!  Dries shiny.  I put our cookies into a ziplock bag and on the counter... I should've put them into the refrigerator because the frosting started to stick to the plastic.  Also, this frosting tastes really really good.

This recipe is great! I added an extra tsp of milk and corn syrup. The consistency was perfect.  My two year had a great time decorating her own cookies!(I thought the flavor was a little strong but it added a nice amount of flavor to boring sugar cookies.)

Great recipe!! I did have to mess around with the quantities of milk to corn syrup. Too much syrup gives it a weird fake flavor. I used heavy cream as one reviewer said and it worked out great. It was really thick when i followed the recipe so I did need more heavy cream to thin it out. I actually had the same cookie cutters from this recipe so it must have been a sign to use this. And it was! This recipe is a keeper!

I liked this recipe, though it was a little too sweet. (okay that's an understatement, it's way too sweet.) It looked pretty, but I doubt you could eat more than one cookie without gagging on all the sugar. Less sugar, and they would be awesome! (by the way, if you don't have powdered sugar, just put regular sugar in the blender for about 30- 60 seconds and you will have powdered sugar! but remember to sift it!) Maybe instead of almond extract you could put lemon extract and then it would balance out the sugar

I absolutely love this frosting! It dries in half of an hour and it still looks glossy. I haven't tried piping with it but I'm sure it would work as well. One suggestion is to add a little extra milk since it is really hard to mix all of the sugar with the amount listed.

The recipe is great in that it dries and isn't sticky to deal with, but for my personal taste the almond extract is way to strong and covers up the whole taste of the cookie. Maybe half as much next time or less.

It didn't mix (not enough liquid for the sugar) and I tried again today. Mixing up the sugar with the 2tsp milk, all I managed to do was send sugar flying around the kitchen - took way more to get it to mix.

My first time to make this icing.  I always made buttercream frosting for sugar cookies.  This was very easy and the almond extract gave the cookies some added flavor.  I did need to add extra milk to make it spreadable.  This makes a very shiny and delicious icing.  I will be making this again.  Thank you JBS BOX for sharing this recipe.

I had to make about 50 cookies for a class project, and I had to keep making more frosting even AFTER I adjusted the 'serving size'. In my opinion, it needs more vanilla to the powdered sugar to make it taste better. I ended up just making my own version which included agave nectar instead of corn syrup and milk with vanilla. They still came out shiny, and I personally think they taste a little better.

I think it's too sweet. The icing LOOKS fantastic but it is too sweet and has not a lot of flavor. Please improve this recipe because I'm planning to make it for my family and they don't like supersweet stuff.

The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the steps to make it didn't seem quite right, and I was initially worried I was going to have to scrap the whole batch.  I ended up with a super-thick paste and didn't want to add any more corn syrup after I felt like I had added a bunch, so I started thinning it out with water, instead, and that worked perfectly.  I found that dipping the cookies in or applying it to them with a spook worked great.

Perhaps I just did it wrong but I couldn't get the icing to work with SO much sugar and such little milk and corn syrup. Ending up adding heavy cream, a dash of salt, and making it that way. Turned out fine, not very glossy, but after drying it looked just as cute as I would've wanted.

No matter how hard I try, I never get icing that hardens to the point where I can stack them. I have tried this one and many others.  I put them in the fridge, the freezer....to no avail. As soon as I touch the surface, squish!  What am I doing wrong?

The proportions are definitely off.  There is no way to mix those amounts of milk and sugar until it's smooth - no way.  I doubled the milk (at least) and finally got it smooth.  It was great for decorating.  This was my first time really decorating cookies and I found it easy to work with (I'm a total beginner).  It also set up nicely.  It was pretty and a bit shiny and hardened (without getting hard if that makes sense) so that I was able to stack the cookies without any problems.  My big problem with it (besides having to seriously tinker with the amounts) was the taste.  The almond extract was overbearing and almost disgusting.  I hated it. Maybe if I had substituted something else or used less, I would have liked it.  I will never try this again (at least not with the almond extract - yuck!).

I followed recipe exactly and I did not care for the taste of this AT ALL!! I thought with all the reviews it would be really good however, it was inedible. It taste like pure powdered sugar. I think maybe the reason it has high reviews is because of the way it absorbs the food coloring and how it looks aesthetically. To me however, i think the taste is more important then look.

Some people also critiqued that it was hard to spread and wouldn't become smooth. That happened to me the first time i made the icing, because I added all the ingredients together INSTEAD of following the directions and stirring the sugar with the milk BEFORE you put the other ingredients in. That made all the difference in making a smooth icing.

Great recipe - the dough was too sticky for me, but I threw in an extra 30 minutes in the freezer and it worked well.  I did use flour to dust the surface and covert the roller pin to avoid breaking the dough.
I like the cookies crispy - at 1/4 in they're crispier, and at 1/2 they may become doughy-cake texture

I had issues with this recipe the first couple of times I tried it. I trouble shot this recipe by reading others suggestions, and it is very important to gradually stir in the powdered sugar, and I used double the milk. We didn't have any almond extract so used vanilla in one and lemon in another batch. The lemon extract was delicious and a favorite at the Christmas party I took them to. It sets up super shiny and hard. Very tasty.

The icing was a little thicker than I liked, so I added a little bit extra milk to think it out.  Very shiny and I was able to stack the cookies without messing up the decorations.

This is a great icing. Like they say, it drys "wet" looking, but really works well. I had to add a little more milk 1/4 tsp at a time, but the result was great. I wasn't a great fan of the flavour, but then I'm never a fan of almond extract)so next time I will use vanilla or rum butter. Note:for a 5 cup flour batch of sugar cookies I needed to make 4x this recipe.

Easy and did the trick.  Had a bunch of toddlers 'painting' onto sugar cookies and it wasn't too drippy or sloppy.  It dried nicely and the colors stay very vivid when dyed.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really didn't like this.  It didn't taste very good, and I had to add more milk, because the measurements were off.  I know that this type of icing is more for looks then taste, but I was really disappointing.  And I've been baking for years, so it's not like I was making a mistake with the recipe.  I've made lots of types of icings.

Loved this icing recipe! I made two batches for my kids' class cookies, one with vanilla extract and one with lemon extract. We had so much fun painting our cookies! The icing hardened perfectly overnight - not so hard you can't bite the cookie, but firm enough for safe transport on a bouncy school bus. :) It has a beautiful gloss, and really holds the food coloring well. I may dip the cookies next time for a different look. :D  Can't wait to use this recipe again!

Best sugar cookie recipe I have ever find. I was a bit concerned after I mixed things up and it was pretty thick. The reviews saved me: add more milk. Not a lot, but maybe another 1/2 - 1 teaspoon. This recipe makes for a VERY pretty cookie. Thanks!

It tastes great, but the measurements are way off. 2 teaspoons of milk to 1 cup of powdered sugar? Wow. That's not even enough to get the sugar wet. I had to add a lot more milk, and it was still very thick and hard to work with. It was my first time making icing, so I had no feel for how thick it was supposed to be, so for the recipe to be so far off on the measurements was frustrating and unhelpful. But I eventually figured it out, and it does taste good and looks good on the cookie.

Looks beautiful and is super easy. One word of warning, do not freeze this icing. The colors dulled and turned blotchy.  Just let the icing dry then store cookies in an airtight container.

I've been searching for a recipe like this!!    Love the sheen it puts on the cookies.   I didn't have time to do another layer this time around but will "budget" my time the next go round so I can play a bit more to see what results I can get by adding more dimension to the decorating process.    I did mess up by adding all ingredients at once but added a bit more milk to enable thorough mixing.  Turned out great.

This icing is delicious and easy to work with.  My 2-5 year old grandkids used paint brushes to paint it on the cookies.  The toppings stick great and as it states it dries perfectly so cookies can be stacked!

The amount of milk and corn syrup the recipe says you need makes a thick unspreadable paste. Not something you can ice cookies with. Had to add double what the recipe called for just to make it smooth and easily drizzled or spreadable.

I tried this recipe last night on some Christmas Tree sugar cookies. I was skeptical about all the rave reviews (could my cookies realy look like store bought?). But, to my surprise, they are BEAUTIFUL. I doubled the recipe as I had TONs to frost. One note, if the frosting is getting dry while working with it, you can add a few drops of Corn Syrup and it's like new. I love this recipe. I do agree that the tast is not quite as good as my "butter" icing recipe. I'll work on that next....

This is perfect for topping my MIL's famous sugar cookies! I used 2 T. of milk and substituted vanilla for the almond flavoring.

Due to a milk allergy and not having corn syrup on  hand, I had to adapt this recipe and used coconut milk and I made a simple sugar syrup. Usually I don't have a problem substituting plain coconut milk for milk but it didn't have enough liquid and it's still dry icing sugar and didn't resemble anything like icing. I had to add another 3tsp of coconut milk and 1 tsp of sugar syrup to get the constancy needed. In the end it was great and something I'll use for future sugar cookies.

Just found this recipe the other day and decided to try it on my Christmas sugar cookies. It is so easy to make and my cookies came out beautiful. I did have to add more corn syrup as stated in the directions. I was able to pipe the icing on and use a brush without any problems. The icing dries nicely so that I could store them easily all together in one container. I decided to use vanilla in place of the almond flavor and it turned out great. I will have to experiment with other flavors next time I make it. Thanks so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

It works ok but drying time is long - a tablespoon of meringue powder will cut down on drying time - and is safer than real egg white.

Perfect! I don't have almond extract (actually don't like the flavor) and used lemon juice instead. The flavor is amazing and the icing is perfect for sugar cookies.

Followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I didn't have to adjust at all. It's very sweet but that is to be expected. Good spreadable frosting for cookies.

The recipe worked well, but way too sweet.  I added extra almond and vanilla and corn syrup then painted it onto the cookies.  It did harden and was able to store the cookies stacked in the container.  All in all, good recipe and will use again only with my additions.

I thought this recipe was pretty good but very sweet and just needed a little something extra, so I threw in a 1/4 c of shortening to give it a little more body and it cut the sweetness too. It still sat up well on the cookies and I had several compliments on the icing, especially the almond flavoring. I will use this base recipe again.

While this did not make a lot I had to make a triple batch for my cookies, it has nice flavor.  I piped it on as I was frosting crosses.  It did take a lot longer than 20 min to dry although the piping was a little thicker.  I will make this again due to the versility in the flavors.

I like this recipe a lot because it hardens very nice however I always need to add more milk or corn syrup to reach the desired consistency to ice the cookies.  Also, I use vanilla instead of almond extract but have to increase the amount in order for the icing to not taste like powdered sugar.

excellent frosting! I did end up using more milk than called for in the recipe, and also added lemon extract instead of vanilla. The results were awesome - My almost 3-year-old niece was able to easily spread this frosting onto the sugar cookies with silicone brushes, and decorating squeeze bottles.  We made an amazing array of Easter Cookies with this wonderful icing!

I loved this recipe! The only change I made was turning 2 TSP to 2 TBS of milk. Otherwise it covered smoothly. I just had to make it about 3 times to cover and decorate 80 cookies, I over did it with certain colors. Ha, but lots of fun. Saving it for sure.

Followed the recipe as stated but needed toad just a little it more milk in order to create the right consistency. Excellent. The cookies turned out awesome. I used a paint brush and painted my egg cookies. The possibilities are endless. Will be using this icing recipe. Simple, quick and tasty. Not too sweet. Thanks!

Perfect!  It dried nicely and did not make a mess on the other sugar cookies!  For those that had trouble mixing it, you have to add very little powdered sugar at a time - you can't just throw all the ingredients in at once!  I did have to add a little extra milk b/c I got lazy at the end and wanted to add more powdered sugar at a time.  For those that do not like the flavor, try butter flavoring.  I also am not a fan of almond, so I substituted.

Wonderful!!! Feel slightly guilty about getting compliments on cookies where I've used this icing because it is so easy.  I added an extra teaspoon of milk as another reviewer suggested and painted on the icing without a hitch.  Icing does hold the colors extremely well, shiny, and a lovely "self leveling" property that makes cookies come out flawless.  I'm going to try this as a base for royal icing accents on some more heavily decorated cookies.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!
Kid friendly too, turned my 4 year old loose with a paint brush and he could actually do it (not so much with buttercream or royal)

There was no way that 2tsp of milk was doing what it needed to do in the powdered sugar.  Using only 2 left me with clumpy powdered sugar.  I didn't get anything smooth unless I used 4tsp.  I misread and used 2tbsp of corn syrup instead of 2 tsp, but it turned out that I needed that much anyway, and the 1/4 extract was an accurate amount (I used vanilla).  Once I got my second batch to a decent consistency for dipping the cookies, I could start to see the appeal of the frosting, but I was so frustrated at that point that it was hard to see the positives. I'm just hoping my cookies dry looking better than they do now, and hoping that the nice packaging I have will distract from the icing job.  I used this for my daughter's 1st birthday cookies and I'm almost too embarrassed to use them (but I still will because I don't have anything else).  It's upsetting that something I was so happy about came out so terribly.  I MIGHT try this icing again with a less-pressure occasion, but it was still a disappointing first experience.

This is so easy to work with. I did add more corn syrup; you need to play around with it until you get the right consistency. This icing flattens out to get a nice smooth surface and hardened quickly to do another layer with a different color, or you can add in another color while it is still wet and it will sink in. Make sure you actually let it dry over night before stacking or putting in bags though, because even if it feels dry it will smudge. It hardened great because it doesn't smudge, but it still tastes creamy and smooth when you bite into it. Don't be alarmed if when you taste the icing before you frost your cookies, it doesn't taste very good...Once it is completely hardened and iced onto the sugar cookies, it tastes wonderful--not to sweet, and it's a great addition to sugar cookies. I used them on the Soft Christmas Cookies Recipe on this site. They were gone in one day!

Delicious! It was so easy to make. I made them for Valentines Day. I didn't have any almond extract, so I used vanilla flavoring instead, and the cookies came out so good! Next time I will definitely use almond extract.

This icing was great! I had to adjust the recipe by adding a little more milk, but overall my family loved them! The icing was glossy and stayed firm which gave the cookies a neat appearance. I am definintely saving this recipe!

Love it! I kind of played around with the powdered sugar and milk amounts until it looked like the consistency I wanted. Loved the addition of the almond extract. :)

Really liked this icing. I had to add about one more tsp milk to get the right consistency but then it sets so shiny and pretty. Love it. And the almond flavor is actually really nice but you could add any extract you want

This icing dries shiny and is good for homemade cookies. It's definitely not the same as the hard royal icing you see on professional cookies if that's what you're looking for. I removed two stars because I found I had to add quite a bit more milk. I also added 1 tsp Boyajian lemon oil for flavour...good choice because everybody loved the hint of lemon!

This recipe makes GORGEOUS shiny glazed cookie frosting!  I used it on my favorite thumbprint cookies for my sister's-in-law baby shower and can't believe how beautiful they are!  My old standard recipe (which did not include corn syrup) gives a much more matte finish.  (I did have to add a few more teaspoons of liquid, but the recipe did say I might have to.)  Thanks for such a easy recipe for such a beautiful result!!!

For the first batch of icing, I followed the recipe exactly.  It ended up a little thicker than I wanted, so added more milk until it reached a good consistency.  I thought the icing was easy to work with and looked beautiful, but the almond flavor was a little strong.  The next time I made it, I used clear vanilla instead of almond.  I will probably continue to experiment with the flavoring, but I thought this was an excellent recipe for a first-time sugar cookie baker!

This looks lovely on the cookies, but the flavor is lacking. Next time I'll add some flavor oils to it to get rid of that powdered sugar flavor. Still, it was easy to work with and my cookies look great, so I won't complain too much!

It wouldn't dry so I could stack my cookies!  I even left out the cookies overnight and then stacked them to transport and they all stuck together and broke! UGH!  If you don't need to stack then it was fine and was very pretty.

Best Recipe to use for sugar cookie icing, it's basic and you have to adjust depending on the consistancy you recieve. add a little milk at a time until you recieve the right texture. I add lemon extract sometimes too in place of the almond just to change it up. The icing dries nicely (fully dry and stackable cookies in about in hour) Thew cookies come out glossy and tasty!

Very nice icing to work with.  A little on the thick side at first but after adding more corn syrup, the icing thined out to a great spreading consistancy.  This icing sets up great and has a wonderful taste.

Too sticky to dry. If you are going to do a single layer of cookies they are good, but you can't expect them to dry so you can stack them. Was a sticky mess..

This was very good.  Have used a similar one in the past that didn't have Karo syrup.  The syrup really did harden-up the icing which made the cookies easier to store.

This icing is perfect. Grand daughter had a blast "painting" the cookies and decorating. Icing tasted good and was vibrant and beautiful using the Walton icing coloring.

I was looking for a frosting that would travel well, because we wanted to take frosted cookies to a family gathering and didn't want to arrive with a bunch of smooshed and smeared cookies. This frosting worked great! I also wanted to share that I did not have light corn syrup, and because I did not have time to run to the store, I used dark. The color still came out great.

I'm not a royal icing fan, but have a hard time packaging cookies frosted in buttercream.
This recipe is the best of both worlds and the colors are shiny and vivid.
My kids had a blast painting the cookies!

I was so excited to try something different and make some beautiful cookies, but boy was I disappointed...it kept thickening up and I'd add more corn syrup and the taste became terrible. So wished it would have worked!! Disappointed.

Was easy to whip up. Did need more milk than stated to get initial smooth texture. Applied and dried easy too. Loved how it shinned. May sub as royal icing because it did hold the M&M's on the gingerbread men for eyes and buttons. Will use it again for decorating cookies, it's a keeper!!

Great icing! I tripled the amount to 36 servings, but it was enough for all 6 dozen! I also used vanilla extract instead of almond. Very good flavor. It reminded me of the icing my mom made when i was little. Better though, because it hardened up so i could stack the cookies.

While it set up nice and made for pretty looking cookies the taste was not for me.  Usually sugar cookies are devoured at my house.  I will stick with a cream cheese based frosting.  It does not finish as nicely but it tastes much better.

Finally, a way to ice my sugar cookies! I was amazed at how easy this was and how well it set up on the cookies. I did the dipping thing (no paintbrushes to use just yet). It was amazing. Followed it step by step and it turned out perfectly.

Very nice icing.  Hardens and is shiny as stated.  I did find I needed to add more milk than called for to get it to become "smooth".  Was liberal with the almond flavoring as we love it.  Will use this again when I make cut outs!  Thanks for a great recipe!

The ultimate test was using this for a holiday party with 16 children attending and decorating cookies.  Needless to say, I needed quite a bit of icing!  I found the flavor to be decent.  The set up (drying) was rather quick which was great when you had kids who needed to take their cookies home.  They had a beautiful shiny sheen, loved it!  However, I did have to use much more liquid than the recipe indicated.  I did not measure, so as other reviewers suggested, be patient and add liquid one teaspoon at a time (alternate milk/corn syrup to not mess up the ratios) until it hits the right consistency.  Good basic cookie icing without egg white!

This was not as good as I expected...it hardly made enough for six cookies. As for the flavor, I found it a little sweet for my taste, however, it got good reviews from my tasters. Overall, I probably would no consider making it again. It stuck like glue to the bowl and spoon I was using, and made for a not so nice clean up...

I use this recipe all the time when I decorate sugar cookies. Very versitile. You can 'paint' it on with a paint brush or add more powdered sugar and pipe it out. I use a toothpick or kabob skewers to make small details or letters. I love how it dries hard and you dont have to worry about how to package them without pulling off all the icing.

Just wanted to add to the reviews that for those with a dairy allergy, we substituted potato milk for the cow's milk called for in the recipe and it still turned out delicious and set like the normal recipe stated.  And of course, it was so delicious we couldn't stop eating it while frosting the cookies!

Absolutely fantastic! I did try with the almond extract first because I just love almond flavor and it was perfect! I will be trying lemon, vanilla and any flavor I can think up. My sugar cookies look so wonderful this year! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

It was very easy to make and use.  It was really fun to use.  And It really dressed up my gingerbread men cookies beautiful.   However, if you have a great cookie recipe then i would stick to very small decorating detail.   It's probably me, but I thinkk icing (any icing.. not just this recipe) is for looks, not for taste.

I did not care for this recipe. Mine ended up a paste (as many others have commented) that I couldn't even stir- added a tiny bit of milk and corn syrup so I could actually spread it on the cookies.  But, it was WAY too sweet and just had a weird taste.  Guess I'll keep searching for the perfect recipe to ice my sugar cookies.

I've never really cared for this extremely thick frosting but of course my 9 year old daughter sure does. And moreso she loves making them with elaborate decorations. I found the above recipe to be way too dry even after doubling the milk and corn syrup. I added in some JIF chocolate flavored hazlenut spread. Might not set up right away but they taste like amaretto. yum.

excellent icing! The icing was more than enough for the batch of cookies if you paint it on. The colors stayed vibrant and was shiny and nice. I did increase the milk by a teaspoon or two to get a thinner icing. i also used vanilla extract instead of almond just becuse thats what i had on hand.

I made it and followed every1s advice and it  was hard to make. I did some with almond extract & som with raspberry extract, 4 som reason vanilla extra & all that sugar tastes horrible.  i finally got the right consistency and I put it in sandwich zip lock bags & it was easy after that. I made 7 different colors, iced the cookies And  after a whole day of refrigeration the icing was set. But I had a party outside it was 77*degrees out and the cookies started 2 melt. So I would like 2 know from any1 if I did something wrong or am I suppose 2 refrigerate it for more than 24 hours or does the icing just melt when it's not in fridge/inside my house. Please help, tell me help please. Cookies looked beautiful but the whole melty part was sad. Classicfeatures@yahho.com  I don't know if I can put my email up but please help me.

I have tried many sugar cookie icings and they have never turned out.  In fact, haven't made sugar cookies in years because of my repeated failures.  Saw this the other day & decided to give it a go and the kids & I set out to make cookies for Halloween.  

I had to add a bit more milk (I used Almond Milk) than what the recipe called for, but that aside, it turned out perfectly. Also used gel icing colors that I got from the craft store and the results were amazing!  Now the kids & I are looking forward to getting started on Christmas cookies :-)  Thank you for sharing!!

I made this recipe for a kids fall festival event. It is amazing! It dries just like the cookies at the bakery. I substituted half and half for the milk and had to add just a bit more. It also takes a little longer than an hour to dry. A little icing goes a long way. We used spreaders to frost the cookies which worked famously. I can't wait to make Christmas cookies now! The cookie recipe I used (also from allrecipes.com)is called The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies. They were also easy and yummy!

I never have made icing before, and this recipe made it a breeze!  I added about 4 teaspoons of milk, instead of the 2 recommended, and the icing was a perfect consistency!  It dried hard and shiny, and was easy to put on the cookie.  I just dipped the cookie in it, and swiped it against the bowl to wipe off the excess.  I love this recipe and will definitely be using it again and again!

Amazing!  I made numerous batches, and this icing turned out great every time.  I used the recipe exactly as written for every batch except one; in one batch, I outlined the shape I wanted on the cookie, then added 1 extra tsp of milk to the remaining icing to "flood" the cookie.  The flooding technique works great, but, as other reviewers have stated, if you add more milk, the shine in the cookie disappears, leaving a dull icing.  I preferred the shiny icing and had no problem with drying time.  I used a "paint" brush, though I would have liked a finer tip (mine was almost a 1/2 inch wide, so made the fine details difficult - I ended up piping the outline and also using my finger to spread the icing around).  I was also able to go back to the cookies and add details on top of the first colour within an the hour and had no problem with colours bleeding into each other.  I then let my cookies dry for 7-8 hours (but they didn't need this long) and stacked them without the icing squishing or getting stuck to the layer above (I used parchment paper to divide each stacked row of cookies).  Great recipe!

Just made these cookies, and they were amazing. I'm usually a box cookie person, but decided to make good cut-out cookies. I chilled the dough for an hour or two. It was nice and hard, and using flour kept it from sticking too bad, as it warmed up. I made pumpkin cookies, and they kept their shape. I used the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe. I didn't add more sugar, but maybe a little more vanilla, and with the icing, I thought they tasted great!!

I will agree that this was a "pretty" frosting for cut out cookies, however I did not care for the flavor. It was also a little on the runny side - it looked like it was set up nicely but it all ran off of the cookies and on to the plate.

I made a batch of sugar cookies and they turned out a little on the bland side, so I decided to makes some frosting. I opted against buttercream (my usual choice) and made this frosting! AH! It was great! The cookies don't need much because this icing is REALLY sweet! They just need a light coating for flavor.

I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla, and it turned out great!

This icing turns out SO beautifully! The more milk you add, I find, the less glossy, so try to keep cling wrap on them when you are not using them. I usually make a few colours and keep them all covered, uncovering them only as I use them, the re covering them as I move through the colours. I also found that liquid food coloring can make it a tad runny depending on how rich of a colour you are trying to achieve. If you are going for deep, rich hues... go with gel food colouring so you don't water down your icing. They are SUPER concentrated.

This recipe would not set up for me as written, I had to play around with the milk and corn syrup to get it to spreadable, but once I did it was fantastic. It looked very pretty on my cookies and recieved many complements.

I thought the flavor was very good but this icing was terrible to work with- I had to add quite a bit more corn syrup. The instructions suggest you "dip or paint it on"- impossible. Piping it into the basic shape of the cookie and attempting to spread it around worked to a degree and the cookies ended up looking and tasting decent but not for the amount of time and frustration involved.

This is the best icing ever, I love the almond flavor and the glossiness of the icing. My sugar cookies always disappear with this icing I highly recommend this recipe.

Great icing recipe, always looks pretty. I generally add more milk and corn syrup than it calls for.

Don't get me wrong, the frosting tastes amazing. I did have to add about another TBSP of milk. What I didn't like, is that the frosting is incredibly hard to frost on cookies. It did not want to stick to the sugar cookies. I ended up putting the frosting in frosting bags and just squeezing it onto the cookies (this was still a little tricky in getting it to stick). It's also very sweet.

I did this recipe, and added a lil more milk to try and make more, but turned out horribly!!! Very runny, and vanilla extract was very strong in flavor. Not sure what I did wrong here, but was not good at all!!!

Great icing recipe! My 2 1/2 year old son and I painted cutout fall cookies. They came out so colorful and shiny! As other reviewers mentions that the icing dries nicely. cookies are stackable. The only thing is that the mixture is kind of dry, it is mentioned to add more corn syrup. I just added about 4 teaspoons of milk and got the right consistency for painting the cookies! I used vanilla extract instead of almond! Great Recipe! A keeper!!!!!

This is the best cookie icing I have ever made.  I found that using more milk and syrup made the consistency easier to work with.  I made two batches, the first with almond extract and the second with lemon extract.  The lemon was amazing!!  I did use more than 1/4 teaspoon of extract, addng more until it tasted perfect!  I recommend this to everyone!

Yummy. Mine was rather thick though and I couldnt seem to thin it out. I had to make 3 batches to yield about a dozen cookies. Tasted much better after the icing had hardened on the cookies. Will use this recipe from now on.

It was good and tasted good.  But after being on the cookie for a day and a half, I ended up with little white splotches on the colored icing.

This took the gel coloring really well.  The colors were very bright.  I recommend making the amount shown in the recipe, then making more if you need it.  This amount started to harden before we could get it all on the cookies.  Great taste and easy to work with!

I must be missing something. I know how to cook, bake, improvise and follow recipes. And all I got was a lumpy mass of white confectioners' sugar. I "stirred" sugar and milk and there was no "smooth". I then beat in the corn syrup and again, just more clumps of sugar.

i used this icing when i made chocolate cutout cookies also on this site. instead of almond extract i used peppermint extract. the taste combination from the cookie and icing is amazing! i gave this recipe 4 stars because when i first started mixing this icing it broke the rubber scraper i was using. it was really thick and needed thinned down quite a bit.

definitely a good recipe, but the corn syrup was not the taste I was going for, I substituted the corn syrup with cream cheese and added small amounts of milk as needed and it came out more to my liking.  This recipe is definitely a good start.

Good frosting! 2 teaspoons of milk is definately not enought. I first made a sugar ball then added more milk as needed and it really came out great! I also used vanilla extract vs. almond.

Trying to add milk to the sugar is wrong and an impossible task to accomplish if you are trying to get a smooth consistency.  It is better to add the sugar slowly to the milk.  I ended up using 4 tsp of milk instead of 2.  I made a couple of batches in order to get a workable consistency.

This icing was nice and thick, and is probably better for piping than painting on.  We thinned it a little so that the kids could paint with it, and it was great.  We also used vanilla rather than almond extract.  Great for Christmas cookies!  Can't wait to try it sans children, for more intricate designs! :)

I love this recipe.  Once I got down to add the milk, then the sugar bit by bit I was a-ok!  This recipe is a hit not just at Christmas but anytime in our home.  You can make some truly professional cookies with it that look great in gift baskets or waiting for Santa ;)

I made a shortbreadish-gingerbreadish cookie recipe I kinda made up, and this icing was perfect! I thought it might be too sweet so I didnt put it on all the cookies, but I'll have to make more now, because it is perfect. it sweetens the cookie up perfectly, and looks really nice. Very glossy, I thoght it was still wet. I even forgot to put the corn syrup in the white icing, but it worked fine. I remembered to put it in the red, and it does look nicer. Very vibrant colour. Thanks so much!!! This is just the easy, yummy recipe I needed.

Mine came out much too thick, and I was only able to pipe icing onto 3-4 cookies. I increased milk or corn syrup to thin it out and will double the batch next time.

This recipe was wonderful. I decorated leaf cookies and they were beautiful and had a wonderful flavor. The icing was dried by the time I finished decorating and I was able to box them up to keep them fresher. My 7 year old commented on how wonderful it made the house smell. I can hardly wait to do christmas cookies.

This is a great sugar cookie icing.  I made it according to recipe - no changes.  It is easy to adjust the consistency for your decorating needs, and the almond flavor nicely complements the cookie flavor.  It's easy to make, easy to use, and gives great results!

Great recipe - I had some trouble getting the right consistency - the recipe says 2 tablespoons, but I needed 3.  Just keeping stirring, you will get the silky icing eventually.  Also when decorating be sure to wait a while before doing a second color - since it's runny you might get a mess.

my 12 yo daughter made this and said the flavor was not very good
EDIT  I just made this last night to use on my cutout cookies I'm making for Christmas gifts at work.  This worded PERFECT and the flavor was not bad at all.  It had such a nice shine to it when it dried.  I thinned mine a bit and painted on my cookies.  FOR SURE will make again when I do this type of cookie.

I use this recipe to top rolled sugar cookies for all the holidays throughout the year.  Making Halloween ones right now!  They always turn out fabulous!  I substitute different extracts to adjust the flavor of different colors of icing.  Raspberry, orange, lemon, vanilla and almond.  All the cookies tasted great with the different flavored extracts.

Very delicious and professional looking.  Great for stacking once dry.  I played around with the flavorings and did a touch of vanilla, almond, and butter.

yummy!!! I listened to others and added more milk which made it too thin. I had to add more sugar. Next time I will just follow the recipe. I did 1/2 batch almond and 1/2 batch orange flavoring.

Super easy to make. I needed to add just a little more milk and next time I will add more flavored extract. Set up nice and shiney and the color is bright. It looks wet but it's not. Will make this again. Looking forward to Christmas cookies.

GREAT icing! I used it to decorate some cookies for a college tailgate party.  Everyone said they tasted like the infamous  "Smiley face cookie" from Savage's bakery in Birmingham, AL (which is AWESOME!).

This was OK, but I had to add a LOT of extra milk to make it thin enough, and I was only able to ice 21 cookies.

this frosting was awesome! i added a bit more milk to thin it out to make it easier to spread. it also toned down the sweetness a little bit.

Swapped vanilla for the almond extract. There certainly needs to be more liquid, so just add more milk, no more corn syrup is needed. Dried smooth and shiny. Yes this icing is very sweet which is why it is great when paired with a plain cookie.

This was a good recipe to start with, but I'm not sure I liked the corn syrup.  Also I played around with extracts and happen to like the lemon extract the best because it brought a different flavor to the cookies.  Overall, this is a good base to work off on.

Very good, easy to work with, and tasted great!  My daughter LOVED this type of glaze-like icing.  She doesn't like the heavy buttercream type, but she was licking the spoon of this!

Good icing to use for decorating, as it dries firm but doesn't get brittle.  Will need a lot more than one batch to ice most batches of cookies.

this frosting was pretty good but hard (very stiff) to work with the glaze look didn't come with the exact directions so I added 1 teaspoon milk and 1 teaspoon corn syrup plus I dipped my frosing spatula in milk to smooth out the frosting. The almond extract was powerful and so the next batch I left it out. Also I was only able to frost about 8 cookies with this recipie. I would use this recipie with the changes.

This cookie icing is the best! I use to be a firm believer in royal icing. But there was so many quirks with that (air bubbles, quick drying, clumped easily). This icing is great. Not only does it color better than royal icing, but I've never had a problem with air bubbles or clumps; no clogged tips! It's consistency is great too. Easy to adjust and alot better to work with than royal icing. It's easier, will set up in more humid weather and looks nicer, in my opinion. This icing is simply the best!!

This icing was simply amazing. It dried within 4 hours in the middle of a tropical summer, when all other icings just dripped! And the best part is that it tasted amazing. One watchpoint: be careful that the cookies don't have too much sugar, as the icing is very sweet.

"Smooth" that still makes me laugh! "If icing is too thick, add more corn syrup" Yeah, like the whole bottle! Someone in my All Recipes World must be playing a joke on me!  I'm all for pretty cookies, but my tastebuds don't have eyes and they were not happy!

I had never really worked with homemade frosting before so this was a bit challenging for me to work with...sticky mess, but it looked so pretty on the cookies and got RAVE reviews!  Really left a professional look to them.  I dipped the cookies in the frosting, which was something someone else suggested and it worked nice for the most part but I did break a few cookies that way lifting them from the frosting.  Took a very long time to firm up is my only real complaint.

This is my new go-to recipe for decorating sugar cookies. It's hard and glossy and sets up wonderfully. I have done both white (for ghosts at Hallowe'en) and with food colouring and it always turns out great.

I LOVED this icing! I made it for my son's school play and all the little kids were licking the icing off the cookies. Will use again!

I recently started decorating sugar cookies and this is my favorite recipe by far! Smooths out to such a beautiful and professional-looking surface.  I have a question though...if anyone knows the answer, I would surely appreciate it!  When I use this icing to pipe decorations or words, when the icing dries...there are many, many tiny craters all over the place. Similar to what a popped bubble would look like.  I do all the tips for preventing bubbles...stir with a spatula, let icing sit 30 minutes after making it, pop any visible bubbles on cookie with a toothpick etc.  Anyone know why I'm having all the tiny craters? I LOVE using this icing and am so frustrated that I can't use it for piping.  Any tips would be wonderful - thanks!

Easy, messy, for quick decorating I found it looked like children's stained glass cookies vs a work of art from the bakery.

I loved this icing!  I did have to add extra milk and corn syrup to get it the right consistancy.  It was too dry as written.  Very easy to make and looks great on the cookies.

This is excellent.  I love the shiny finish.  *Update*  I  still love this icing, but it always gets cloudy for me after it dries completely.  Because of that there is a tiny window between "dry enough to stack" and "cloudy".  Maybe I use too much milk?

Delicious, easy and flexible for adjusting if you want thicker or thinner icing.  The almond extract really adds a nice flavor.

I didn't have any corn syrup so instead I used softened butter.  The cookies turned out awesome.  Its really a buttercream frosting when you use butter, but by using these measurements it's note quite as thick as it would be on a cake or cupcake.

I made this recipe to the T and I found it a bit difficult to work with.  I do plan to give it another shot!  I think a part of my struggle was my lack of experience at icing cookies.  My cookies did turn out cute though, for a beginner!  Ha ha!

This icing is a little tricky to work with. It seems to spread... We found that dipping worked best. After two days we got the white spots that others have mentioned but it's rare to have cookies sit around that long here!

I am a total novice at using this type of icing.  It was super easy to make.  Just add drops of milk until you get the consistency you like.  I used gel coloring and the colors are outstanding and the icing didn't get thinned by it.  I dipped some cookies and used a small paint brush to ice others.  I used vanilla instead of almond extract.  The icing is perfectly sweet and tastes awesome.  I hope to get brave enough to do some piping with it soon.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Perfect!! I had to add a bit more milk and a bit more corn syrup (a tsp at a time) but it came out simply PERFECT. I love the high gloss!! The only down side is that if you want sprinkles you better do them quickly!! The icing soft sets in less than 10 minutes after putting it on a cookie and hard sets in about an hour and a half. I can not wait to show these off to friends and family!!  I used Wilton's gel food coloring for my colors and they came out nicely. Thanks so much for sharing this!!!

I just made this tonight.  I thought it was GREAT since i've never made icing before.  I'll use it all the time.  It hardened faily quickly.  I did kind of adjust the milk portion but I adjust with many recipes so that didn't bother me.

Very delicious. It took about 4 or so hours to dry. It was kind of runny. So when I tried to make fine lines around the edeges it crept off. Maybe I should adjust the consistency.

I doubled to ice 8 dozen sugar cookies and gingerbread, used water for milk, needed to double water to 8 tsps, used vanilla extract for almond for allergy reasons, nice to work with.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. The icing is fairly easy to work with and dries firm, but not hard. Makes transporting and packaging them easier, imho. Definitely a good recipe if you want to make really detailed iced sugar cookies.

Dries and hardens to a perfect consistency. Had to add a bit more milk so it would mix well. A great cookie icing.

I have never found an icing I actually liked for sugar cookie decorating, this one is great!!  It does dry shiny and the colors lasted until they were ALL eaten!!  This recipe will stay with us for all Christmases now!

It was so sweet it made my teeth hurt.  On the other hand, it was easy to work with and dried quickly - took another readers suggestion to add a little more milk (in exchange for losing some shine), but that then your cookies would dry faster.  Mine were dry in two hours and looked great.  However, the next day, the icing had developed white spots!!  If anyone has any ideas on that I sure would like to know.  This icing did make for a beautiful cookie, and I will more than likely use it again.  Just really, really, disappointed by the white spots.

Good flavor and consistency for dipping cookies and getting a smooth cover.  It would need more sugar to allow for piping, but I just had a bowl of this that my 2-year old dipped the cookies in then sprinkled with sugar and decorations.  Perfect for that, and it couldn;t be easier or faster to make.

Based on the reviews,I thought this would be a great recipe. I followed this to the T and found I needed to add LOTS more corn syrup-- to the point where the mere thought of ingesting it made me ill. I think I'll stick to my usual recipe,which is more work, but worth it.

This Icing is fantastic.  I decorated 3 dozen Christmas cookies.  It dries hard, and fast.  I did use vanilla instead of almond extract.  I did find it easier to mix the sugar into the milk and not the other way around.  It's easier to control the thickness.  When applied in a thick coat to cooled sugar cookies, this icing is bright and quite impressive.  Really brightened up my cookie boxes.

Good base recipe. Had to adjust amounts to get consistency I wanted. Allowing drying time is a must - pretty, shiny cookies are worth it.

i had to add almost twice as much milk to make this work, but it did indeed work very well. i used vanilla extract instead of almond because it was what i had on hand. next time i'll  try lemon - i think the tartness would balance well with the sweetness of the icing and cookies together. tastes absolutely delicious and dries shiny and hard. let it dry as long as possible otherwise you lose a bit of shine. undyed, it dries to a beautiful pearly white which was perfect for the candy cane shaped cookies i made.

This was great! Used this to decorate Gingerbread Men this year and pass out. It was so easy to make. I just dump all the ingredients together and whisk, my fault for not not reading the directions. But it worked just fine. Added more milk to get it a little thinner - a little bit at a time. Then put some gel food coloring in a ziploc bag and added some of the icing. Snipped the tip and my 6yo was ready to decorate. Dried up nicely, stayed pretty true to color, and had a nice shine to it. Will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

For looks, ease and consistency I give this a 5, however for taste I give it a 2 at best. It tastes like powdered sugar flavored with almond. It has no richness to it, no complexity of flavor, just a very flat almond and powdered sugar taste. Yuk! My cookies looked pretty, though, so at least that can be said for it.

Love this icing!!! It took 1 tbsp of milk to get mine at the right consistency. I love the almond flavor in sugar cookie icing, so I added 1/2 tsp almond extract. It came out perfect and was used to ice many batches of cookies this Christmas season.

Produced a beautiful and delicious result.  I decorate cookies and was looking for an alternative to using Meringue powder ((costly)).  I loved the results of this recipe.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

AMAZING! I love them I'm using it on Soft Christmas Cookies tonight for a Christmas Eve dessert. I rated the Soft Christmas Cookies 4 stars, but now I would rate them 5 stars with this icing. My family loves them as much as I do. I recommend this to anyone who wants to make their sugar cookies a little more delicious and unique.

These proportions seem off to me. I followed the recipe exactly and the "icing" came out in a very think, non workable ball. I added more corn syrup like suggested and that didn't help at all. So I finally used my old recipe.

I would have given it 5 stars, but each time I made it (and I made it 4 times for four different batches of cookies) I had to add an extra 1-2 . milk.  Fantastic recipe though!!  I never have powdered egg whites, and don't want to purchase them to make icing infrequently.  The colors were so pretty and everyone just raved about how beautiful the cookies turned out.  Thank you!

Fantastic frosting, nice & shiny, this set up beautifully. I used lemon extract & found it to be a mild, almost subtle flavor. I'll try orange extract next time. Definitely add 1/2 t milk a little at a time until you reach desired consistency (for me it was 4 to 4-1/2 t total). Don't add this all at once because it will make the hand mixer beaters gum up--add a little liquid at a time. I did not add extra corn syrup because I didn't want to have trouble with it drying. I had good luck doubling the recipe. I used the paste coloring & mixed it in with a small amount of frosting before adding it back into the rest of the frosting.  It worked beautifully in a piping bag & and a parchment bag (finer line).  The colors were bright & the frosting hardened within a few hours (about 3-4). Lovely frosting, easy to work with. Thanks!

I have used this recipe for over 5 years and it is easy to make, easy to use and goes on your cookies beautifully, drying shiny and just hard enough to make storing the cookies a breeze.  If you have used Royal Icing before but hate how hard it is to eat this is your substitute!  Love the almond extract but it that isn't your cup of tea substitute the flavoring of your choice.

This truly is a perfect sugar cookie icing. Used recipe exactly as is and it was perfect! Hard on the outside, soft on the inside, shiny glossy. I have never decorated cookies before so I wasn't the best in terms of a steady hand, but I still think they came out looking pretty okay since the incing was so awesome.

I am a first time iceing maker and this recipe made me look like a pro. Awesome and super easy! We made it a family project and used paint brushes. Super easy to work with, great for creative little ones, and a beautiful glazed look. I will keep recipe close on hand.

Followed recipe exactly and ended up with a powdery substance. Had to add a lot of milk to make it spreadable with paint brush. Was fun to use but end result was not as thick or colorful as I had hoped. I could not find any advice on getting the right consistency other than to tweak it as needed. I would have appreciated better directions for how to get the right consistency in the recipe. Not sure how other people had it work perfectly their first time making it!

the icing tastes great but i found only two teaspoons of milk a little difficult to mix into the sugar, so I increased it to three.

This icing is great!! I ended up using a bit more corn sypup than it called for so that it would be easier to spread. I ended up doubling the recipe so that i could frost all of the cookies. With a thin layer of frosting it dried in less than an hour. My sugar cookies turned out great this year!!

This icing is incredible.  It's my go-to recipe for my sugar cookies and is now considered one of my "secret recipes" that my family assumes only I can make.  If you have a consistency problem try adding a little more corn syrup and milk.

This icing was the perfect sweetness for the sugar cookies I made.  It dried quickly and looked pretty.  I did have to use a lot more milk than the recipe calls for.  I continued to put in teaspoons until it was the right consistancy.  Don't try to make it without a mixer!

Like some of the other reciews I had to play with the milk and corn syrup amounts but it was worth it. This was the best cookie icing I've ever used.    Note: I tripled this for a double batch of sugar cookies and had just enough, I kept some white and split some into 4 different bowls and colored the icing

This receipe has to be played around with to get the right consistency that you want depending on the decorating that you are wanting to do, but the flavor is very good.

I was looking for a recipe that I could tweak and it still be delicious. I have children with 8 food allergies and even after replacing all the dairy ingredients with water, it still turned out great. I have gotten rave reviews. I even mastered a recipe for sugar cookies that are safe for my children. Just made 6 dozen last night and will be making more this week for the holidays.

It was the first time I tried to make icing and it worked perfectly! A great and simple recipe. As other stated I added a little bit of extra milk, no more than half to one teaspoon. I only had dark corn syrup and the icing still came out very white. I was able to use it as is on gingerbread cookies.

This recipe is amazing. It takes a bit to dry but does dr hard and shiny. Mixes well with food coloring. Tastes AWESOME! I will enjoy passing this one down to my kids when they are old enough ;) I did actually use Vanilla Extract because my hubby grabbed the wrong thing from the store, it was fine, but instead of a pretty white, I got a pretty off white :) Didn't effect the food coloring though.

This recipe was really good.  I can't get corn syrup here, so I tried the suggestion to make sugar syrup from another reviewer, and that was a disaster.  The proportion of water and sugar must have been off, because I ended up with candy so hard I couldn't even get it out of the pan without alot of work.     But, the recipe turned out fine without any syrup.  I made it quite a bit thinner so I could brush it on with a pastry brush.

So simple even a moron like me made perfect looking cookies. I used simple syrup instead of corn so a friend with corn-allergies could enjoy them too! I definitely decorated more than a dozen cookies with this recipe as well.

Awesome taste and easy to use. The recipe makes it seem like the powder sugar and milk with form a smooth mixture, but it doesn't. Once you get it mostly combine add the corn syrup and extract. Make sure to beat it in. It comes out purfect. If it is too thick add extra corn syrup not milk. The extra milk makes it too runny.

Don't follow this recipe.... Please.... I tried making it today and there is NO WAY that only 4 table spoons, especially 2 (you have to mix milk and powdered sugar together until creamy) is going to actually make the powdered sugar 'liquify'. I wound up using about 1/4 cup of milk.

This icing turned out flavorless and disgusting. I was completely unable to work with it and tossed out a double batch. Total waste of ingredients!

Perfect! I used this to make christmas cookie gifts for my neighbors and the icing is beautiful. I am in Japan so I had a hard time finding light corn syrup so I used shiromitsu instead. Someone told me to try mizuame which is a syrupy clear and sweet substance but this turned out too sticky and wouldn't dry.   I tried this the second time with shiromitsu and it was perfect!

This icing was quick easy & delicious.  We did use more milk, we ended up using 5 teaspoons instead of 2.  This is the first time I've ever made homemade cookies.  I used the soft sugar cookie IV recipe.  Everyone loved them.

I've been looking for an icing that was tasty, but would harden and not be crunchy.  FOUND IT!!!  Basic ingredients that you typically have in your kitchen and you don't need a blender. (so you can make more in the middle of the night and not wake your family) The frosting is so glossy that I was afraid to touch them thinking they were still wet. They are just that pretty.  I did add an extra tsp of milk both batches because it didn't seem to be "smoothing" out like it should.  It might only need an extra 1/2 tsp.  I'll try less next time.  THANK YOU for this super easy, nice tasting and GREAT looking icing recipe!

this is by far, the most fantastic cookie icing I have EVER found! Though, I find it takes 4 tsp of milk, rather then two.. but dries perfectly and is a definite win with everyone

Very easy recipe for nice icing.  I gave it 4 stars b/c the proportions are a bit off.  With only 2 teaspoons of milk it was very sticky - took more like 4-5 teaspoons of milk before it was smooth.  Having said that, it was easy to keep adding the liquids until the right consistency.  Kids had a fun time painting the icing on, and it dries very professional looking (if not eaten right away!)

Used this on my favorite sugar cookie recipe and they turned out beautiful.  From now on this will be the icing recipe that i use.  I had to thin a bit more to make the icing spreadable.  These dried fast to a great glossy shine!  I doubled the amount of flavoring and it had a great flavor.

Exellent recipe for sugar cookie icing!  I did have to double it and it was very hard to mix.  Doubled, the recipe called for 2 tbsp of corn syrup, but I ended up having to put in much more to get the consistency, as well as a little more milk than called for.  In the end though, it was a perfect icing, easily spreadable!  Thanks!

Perfect, perfect. You may need to add extra liquid (I did)- but this is the perfect alternative to royal icing, should you not want to use raw egg whites (and/or don't have meringue powder on hand). It's so inexpensive and couldn't be easier with great, glossy results. Yahoo! :-)

Super easy and turned out great!  I had to add a tad more milk, but other than that did everything as written.  Also, this is great with other extracts (vanilla, maple, peppermint, etc.).  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is one of the best icing for rolled sugar cookies. It's very tasty and VERY easy to work with. It dries silky smooth and glossy. I'm looking forward to using it again on my Christmas cookies.

I have made this recipe twice now, however I do not keep corn syrup on hand, so I have substituted shortening and it worked just fine.  I was like some of the other reviewers and had to add a tad more milk than the recipe called for.  The first time, I spent over 1/2 hour trying to get the consistenancy correct, but the 2nd time it was much better!  Thanks for sharing

Absolutely the best icing I've used! I tried it when I first mixed it and it seemed a little too sweet but when it dries on the cookies it's perfect! They dried enough where I can stack them but not too hard to eat. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Excellent! Never know though what consistency you want your icing, too thin it runs off the cookies and too thick it is hard to pipe.

This recipe worked great for me! I didn't have any corn syrup so I used some pure maple syrup and it worked great, and didn't alter the flavor at all.  I piped it onto cookies, and it was very easy to work with, the perfect consistency, and dried beautifully! This is my new go to icing recipe!

This is the recipe I have been looking for forever!! When my cookies are frosted with this icing, they always look professional. I always get compliments, and even feel bad eating them when they look so beautiful! I don't change a thing. I use liquid food coloring without a problem as well. My only icing recipe! Christmas cookies will never be the same! ( I use "The best rolled sugar cookies" recipe with this.)

This icing worked out really well,  It was a bit thick so i added just a spash more of milk and it spread nice and dried really smooth but shiny.  It look very professional.  I used Wilton icing color to color mine and it make beautiful vibrant colors.

The taste was good, and the consistency was perfect! Honey works in place of corn syrup, but yields a different shade of color. It dries so fast and wonderfully! Awesome!

GREAT GREAT!  I used this on the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site.  I doubled the recipe to cover all of my cookies.  I only had vanilla extract, so I used it.  And I also was out of corn syrup, so I used honey.  These changes turned out just fine.  Everyone loved these cookies with this icing and so did I! :)

This is the best cookie icing. It's so shiney and sets up perfectly. I had to add extra milk but then I added to much milk so I had to add more powdered sugar to fix it. It all turned out and my cookies were a hit.

Great recipe.  I decorated cookies for a baby shower and they looked adorable.  The icing spread easily and it worked well for piping, too.  The recipe doesn't make much so I made about 5 batches.  Looked and tasted good!

I love love love this recipe! I tried out a few recipes trying to find one that would help me make cookies that look like they came from a swanky bakery and this recipe is it!! It turns out perfect every time. I have made cookie favors for several weddings and showers and I make a cute cutout cookie (busia's cutout cookies from this website is #1!) then I decorate them with this icing, drop them in a favor bag and tie them with ribbon and they are gorgeous!

Fantastic! I used this to make personalized cookies for my daughters baptism.  They looked like I've been doing this for years.  You may have to play with the consistency a bit but it comes out glossy and shiny.  One tip - don't freeze them.  That was my only mistake - it ruins the look.

This icing came out really really really yummy but I do not recommend using corn syrup just because its not that good for you. I used some not a lot of light olive oil/ water.  Then I just decided just to use a little of water like 1/4 tsp of it and it came out perfect.  If 1/4 tsp isn't enough water just keep using little by little until you get a good consistency of the icing. I had funny decorating my sugar cookies with this. =)

I *love* this icing! The results are similar to those huge shaped cookies they sell at grocery stores and coffee shops. If you have a sweet tooth like mine, try dipping the iced cookies in sparkling sugar before they dry. Yum!

Very nice and easy to work with.  I added another tsp of milk to stretch the icing further, but I liked the consistency of the recipe as is.  It dried very quickly, after about an hour, and allowed me to stack the cookies nicely.

Great icing! It does take some time to completely dry, but the end results are fantastic. I used to clear vanilla extract so my white was white and not cream. Thanks for sharing!

Great decorating icing.  I don't like a lot of icing on cookies so I thinned it out a bit and used a pastry brush to "paint" on the icing. After it dries you can go back and pipe additional details.  Makes a beautiful cookie.

I had to add a touch more milk, but it still turned out beautifully.  Used orange extract instead of almond and loved it!

This recipe is great for cookie bouquets and for making a glossy finish. I am not so crazy about the taste however sometimes it more about how good it looks rather than how good it tastes.

Beautiful icing.  Nice shiney hard icing perfect for sugar cookies.  Woks well if you need to stack cookies for storage, just wait til frosting had dried.

This was my first attempt at icing such as this.  My cookies looked professional... though I need to learn about tools to better apply the icing.  It was tasty, pretty, and very easy to make and use.  Loved it.

Loved this recipe.  Looking for something easier than buttercream frosting and this certainly does the trick.  You will need to add more milk that the recipe states - but as others have said - you can not screw this up.  I love the almond flavor also!!!

Great frosting! You have to play with the amount of milk to get your desired consistency, but it really turns out great either way. It dries pretty quick too. Love it!

I used to use a butter cream icing on my cookies, but since coming across this recipe it's all I use. It tastes great and hardens up nicely. A great compliment to any sugar cookie.

I followed the instructions for this recipe several times and it never worked. I finally just did my own measurements with all the same ingredients and finally got it to work. The ingredients are good but the amounts did not work for me. I also used vanilla extract instead of almond and they tasted really good.

I needed at least double the liquid to get the right consistency.  I used lemon extract instead of almond due to allergy issues - it was good - added a nice, fresh taste! Dried shiny and firm.  Looked great!

Another corn syrup substitution: I used cheap pancake syrup, since it's basically corn syrup anyway. I also used soy milk instead of regular. It still worked (I needed about 5 tsp of milk total, still just 2 tsp of syrup - and the syrup had enough flavor I skipped the extract). I am very pleased - the icing makes up for my abysmal decorating skills...

Just what i was looking for... i had to add more milk to get a more liquid form.  i just dipped the top of the cookie in and let it drip for a second and then placed on the counter to dry.

Perfect consistency and beautiful sheen!  We dipped the top of the cookies then, after that partly dried, piped the edges to get that "perfect" shape.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that I think the flavor could be improved with a little work.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This icing is so much fun to work with and it is so easy!! I added a bit more milk, as per the advice of others, and I was so impressed with how the cookies turned out. I look forward to making cookies now for every holiday and season.

This is a wonderful icing recipe! I have had problems in the past with icing being to thick, pastey or gooey. This recipe was perfect!

wonderful compliment to sugar cookies. I added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract for extra flavor. Turned out wonderful!

This Icing was tasty and beautiful. I had to add more milk,I tried to add a lil confectioners sugar at a time to the 2 tsp of milk, like a  reviewer suggested. I am not that talented! Loved this icing. It was awsome.

Very easy recipe.  I used lemon extract instead of almond and just for fun added 2T of cream cheese, turned out great.  I did have to adjust the other ingredients to get the right consistency.  Tasted great and held up well for staking.  I will definitely make this my go to recipe.

This icing is super delicious.....Easy to make but next time i will go and buy corn syrup instead of making it.  The sugar/crystal mess is super hard to clean up.  Way too much effort to make it.

YUM!!!  Warning:  This icing makes cookies even more addictive than they originally were.  Very easy to make.  I did need more milk than called for.  I don't know how long it would take the icing to harden because they were gone before they got a chance!

I have made many batches of royal icing but have never quite found one that was "forgiving" enough for me-I am not an expert decorator.  This one fit the bill.  I decorated about 3 dozen cookies with a double batch in white and a single batch tinted pink.  It was a thick enough consistency for for me to be able to dip the tops/fronts of the cookies into the icing and let it drip off a bit, this gave me a smooth beautiful finish.  I had no problem swirling other colors in or getting colored sugars and sprinkles to stick.    The icing is hardening up quite nicely.  This recipe is a keeper for me.

Excellent.  I love how it smoothes itself out after you spread it, and yet it doesn't run where you don't want it to go.  Will make this my go-to recipe for sugar cookie icing, thank you!

Awesome icing!  I only added one extra tsp of corn syrup & my cookies came out great with a nice sheen when they dried.  Oh & I didn't have any almond extract around, so used vanilla & it tasted great.

For my first time decorating cookies, I was nervous about how this would turn out.  It was easy to use and decorated beautifully!  I added extra corn syrup to get the consistency I needed.  I did have to double this recipe to have enough icing for Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from the site.  Loved this recipe, thanks!

This is a very nice icing.  I did have to double the recipe to have enough, for a half recipe of the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site.  I did add more milk and a little more corn syrup to get the right consistancy. These have a very nice gloss.  I would use this recipe again.

i used honey instead of corn syrup, and vanilla instead of almond (like others), and it tasted great. you couldn't taste the honey at all (my friends were surprised it had honey in it), but it made it dry, shiny, and hard like others say this icing does. and i used sprinkles, but just had to push them in a little bit so they'd stick before the icing set.  it was pretty thick, though, so i added some more milk and honey and it was fine.  i also doubled the recipe, because this doesn't make that much, and i like lots of icing on my cookies!

I used this icing on my Christmas sugar cookies.  This is the first time I've used this type of icing and I found it very easy to work with - it mixed up nicely and I applied it with a small silicone basting brush.  It dried very quickly, in fact, I learned I had to sprinkle on the sparkling sugars I was using right away or it got too dry to stick.  I'll use this recipe again

Great icing!  I used on a sugar cookie store bought mix and they looked great!  I added a touch more milk to the recipe to make it easier for my niece to fill in the outline I made for her.  Will always use this recipe!

I loved this recipe. I was easy and you can change the consistancy to suit my needs. I little sweet by itself, but excellent on the sugar cookies.

Wonderful!!! I've searched for years for a good icing recipe to top holiday sugar cookies with and I've finally found it. The icing isn't overly sweet and it dries hard and very pretty.

I loved the way this icing turned out.  Altough I did have to add more milk and more vanilla to get the right consistency and flavor.  This icing has a much nicer looking finish than regular old frosting.

Great recipe for sugar cookies! And any flavor extract works very well with it. I made 2 batches, one with lemon and one with mango extract and they both came out awesome. I did however add extra milk to get the right consistency. Thanks for a great "keeper" recipe!

Very good consistency once dried, but had to add lots of extra corn syrup and milk to make it spread easily with a paintbrush.  As someone mentioned earlier, you have to move quickly because it does thicken; I just added more milk, and problem solved.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used orange extract and had to add more milk than it called for, but you always have to fluctuate the milk in icing recipes I think.  Add to consistency of desirability!  Ha.  Very nice icing!!

First of all, this icing tastes much bett on th cookie than it does on your finger..or spoon. Something happens when it hits that cookies and sets. I needed ot make 4 batches of this for different colors for the sugar cookies. One batch I kept white and used maple extract in and a little cinnamon for maple flavored icing. So good! I did need a little more milk than called for, but it's really a personal preference on desired consistency.

I used this recipe with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies." The icing was definatly better than the cookie. It tasted fine - a good basic cookie icing. I'm not sure if I would say they come out any more shiny than an icing made without Corn Syrup, and it does take awhile to harden - but a good icing.

This is an awesome icing recipe.  My cookies were picture perfect!  I made teddy bears and tinted the icing tan and decorated with craisin buttons and noses  and raisins for eyes and mouths.  It took all night to dry but they went into the cookie jar the next day and the decorations stayed put.  Thanks for posting.

Great icing!  Lots of oohs and aahs from the family at Christmas when they saw the cookies iced with this.  I used peppermint extract instead of almond, and made for a nice subtle peppermint flavor to the cookies.  Don't be a boob like me and misread "teaspoon" for tablespoon.   But once we got the consistency right, it was great, really easy to use.

I was looking for a icing recipe and when I came across this one I decided to try it. I made cookies from this site also (best rolled sugar cookies) when I made the cookies they were bland but when my kids decorated the cookies with this icing they turned out awesome. Purfect blend and the almond really stands out. I did have to add a little bit more milk because it was too thick. If I make any type of sugar cookies again next year I will definitely use this again.

I followed a review to add double milk, and that worked good for me. Although, I was making Christmas cookies so I had lots of food coloring, enough to make it runny so I think next time I will take into account how much the foodcoloring will also "thin" out my recipe. I didnt have a brush, I used a butterknife. I put it in a plastic bag so I could smoosh out all the lumps, and cutting a little hole in the corner makes it easy to draw. I used this with "The Best Rolled Sugar Recipes" and rolled those out with powdered sugar instead of flour. I will be using this again and again!

this frosting is beautiful, although i did run into trouble not having any corn syrup so i took some advice of another reviewer and made  a simple syrup to take it's place. I did have some worries 1st mixing it i just have a big ball of slime so i had to add about 1/4 cup of milk to get it to a managable consistency. it worked very nice but it takes maybe about 6 hours to dry completely. Very tasty though i must say

Not bad but I like the one I normally use better.  I will say that I would choose this icing before I would choose canned frosting. I guess to each his own.

I didn't like this icing...I've never been a fan of homemade icings, they always taste like powdered sugar. This one was very powdered sugary tasting, so I opted for canned frosting instead. I will say that it hardened and glossed up beautifully, though. But taste wise, just not for me!

Good Recipe. I doubled the recipe and it still came out good. My husband was eating just like that! Although I didnt like that it takes HOURS before you can actually stack your cookies. Appearance was nice and glossy!

Very good recipe, I like the almond extract for flavor (I've used lemon juice in the past). I give it four stars instead of five because it did need a little more milk to thin it out for easier spreading/piping (I added a little less than a tsp. and that helped). This made enough to completely cover 6 larger gingerbread boy cookies (about 5 inches tall).

Perfect!! I had to let them dry overnight but they are shiny and hard now. So easy and fast to do, though I did have to quadruple the recipe to make enough for 4 colors and all of the cookies I decorated(with a little left over). I'm using this from now on!

This icing tastes very good.  I agree, it is a little bit strong.  I also did have some problems finding a good method to get it onto the cookies.  I solved both of these problems by thinning the recipe out with extra milk and putting it into baggies and drizzling it onto the cookies.  It gave it a nice organized mess.

As other reviewers said, this recipe is not accurate as listed.  I followed their advice and used 3T of milk and 1.5T of corn syrup (I only had dark, but it turned out fine).  I also substituted vanilla extract.  The cookies turned out as beautiful as everyone said.  But as far as dry time, mine were already drying by the time we finished icing them.

I tried this with vanilla, lemon, and almond extract for flavoring. It's fantastic, very easy to work with. My cookies look and taste like bakery-made treats.

Great basic recipe!! It does require some tweeking: more milk and cornsyrup depending on how you want to decorate the cookies (piping, dipping, or brushing). This recipe is however very forgiving and dries perfectly. I found using a small whisk was a big help in getting all the lumps out.  Will be using this recipe again, I might try adding some cinnamon or allspice extract next.

Easiest icing ever!  Used this at church for the kids to decorate cookies and used paint brushes.  Worked great!  No finger licking!!!  I also used it to decorate some beautiful cookies.  Very easy to work with.  This is my new recipe for frosting!

I wasn't too sure about this recipe while I was making it but the reviews it received about being terrific were right! I did double the vanilla flavoring and I even made some with peppermint extract(if you use peppermint you will onlt need 1/4tsp unless you want them tasting like toothpaste lol) My candy cane cookies were to die for! The regular ones were AMAZING too! Cookies were gone in 2 days! I love how fast this icing dries & the fact that it still has a nice soft icing consistancy under the top dry later. Just perfect! This recipe with a good sugar cookie recipe will have you eyeing weight watchers closely after you're done indulgin ;) It's awesome!

This is a very good recipe and produces shiny, hard icing just as promised. It is a bit tempermental, but after working with it for a while I finally got ahold of how much corn syrup to add to get it to the right consistency. This was my first time icing cookies, so I could definitely use some practice, but this icing sets up very nicely. Thanks :)

Love this icing!  However, I do add a little bit more milk and corn syrup as the recipe seems too thick.  I use this icing with the "best rolled sugar cookie" recipe from this site and they are so yummy!  Will use these two recipes from here on out!

I doubled the recipe and found I had to add a lot more corn syrup and milk to get the consistency where I wanted it.  The glaze effect is beautiful... wish I was a better decorator to justify how nice the frosting looks!  Recommend adding a little more almond extract when doubling the recipe as well.  Good luck!

This was pretty good, but my husband (who loves sugar frosted cookies) thought they were too sweet. I think maybe the almond extract was a bit too much if you don't want that super sweet flavor. Other wise the consistancy was great! (had to add 1 tsp more milk, was too think at first)

Made as is the icing was way too thick. I added additional milk and corn syrup in very small imcrements.  It was very shiny and smooth.  While it did harden, after stacking the cookies, they were a bit messsy when taking them apart.  Will probably make again

Great recipe. I too had to add more milk but this was easily done to get it to the consistency I wanted. I loved that it spreads so easily and with a little more milk can be painted on. 

I tried a batch with imitation clear vanilla extract (to keep the white white) and another with the almond. I preferred the vanilla others preferred the almond. I may try lemon next. 

This recipe pairs perfectly with Jill Saunders "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies."

I have no idea what I did wrong.  This recipe definitely needs more liquid than is called for!  I had a very hard time getting the right consistency.  I ended up giving up and using the goo I ended up with after having had to add to thin it, then add more confectioner's sugar to thicken because it was too thin, and so on...I ended up with about 10 cups worth of this stuff!

It has a great flavor, but I found it extremely difficult to work with.  It ended up as globs running all over my cookies and looking like I just poured it on without any thought to it.

Wow! this recipe is amazingly delicious, shiny, and simple. I have made it twice now for two seperate batches of gingerbread men. The first time, I prepared the recipe as written. The second time, I used clear vanilla extract and added a pinch of ginger and cinnamon to give it a special kick. 
I love how you really don't have to formally measure the ingredients, just keep mixing and add the milk little by little until you get the consistency right.
The icing sets so beautiful! Glossy, firm, and stays that way.
Awesome recipe!

Very good recipe that dries to the shiny finish you're looking for.  It definitely needed more liquid in order to get the right consistency.  It was dry crumbles when I followed the recipe.  I just kept adding more extract, milk and syrup in order to work.  The taste improved after it went on and dried on the cookies.

I had baked up a batch of sugar cookies and was really excited to use this icing.  I was so excited, that I forgot I didn't have almond extract and only had Karo's Brown Sugar Dark Corn Syrup only!  It still went on very well and hardened up nicely!  I did have to add a little more milk to the mix, but a bit of caution...DON'T add too much, like I did! LOL. Would LOVE to try it with almond extract next time =-)

End result is awesome and won the taste test between this recipe and another on this site for sugar cookie icing by my five year old.  However, this was VERY sticky and thick - I also had to add extra milk and syrup like other reviewers.  I made the simple syrup another reviewer suggested since I didn't have corn syrup.  It seemed to work just fine, but it hardened up on me before I could even crank out my third batch of frosting :(  Had to switch to another recipe that didn't call for corn syrup - tasted good but didn't harden like this one.

Followed other suggestions and added extra milk and corn syrup- overall, I wasn't impressed- it did not hold up well to sprinkles...Sorry- won't be using again...

I have made a lot of icing types and this was not that great.  I made it for my kids to use and they had a really hard time spreading it around.  On the plus side it did set up nicely... it was firm, but not hard.

I had to add much more milk than the recipe called for to achieve a spreadable icing consistency. The icing must dry for several hours before the cookies can be stacked. The colors remained bright, and the icing flavor is decent. I didn't think there was anything particularly special about this recipe.

This icing makes beautiful cookies! I made some with lemon flavoring instead of the almond and they turned out wonderful also. For Christmas I'm going to experiment with peppermint extract! The icing layers well for elaborate designs and was the right consistency so that one is able to work with it to brush it on but it does not run and smudge the cookie.

This was so much fun! I made Christmas trees and snowmen cookies and then made some of your sugar cookie icing in all sorts of colors and handed it over to the three kids to decorate all of them.  This  had the perfect amount of sweetness, not overpowering (thank goodness because my two year old really liked to glop it on!)And it dried to a beautiful shine within 2 hours.

I had to add (as others have said) much more milk and corn syrup. The recipe is not right as written. I gave it 3 stars only because the ingredients are good. As written the recipe itself would be one star. Only after you alter the amounts to get the right consistency does the recipe become useable. At that point the frosting is beautiful.

This is a great recipe. The cookies look like they came from a bakery. I used vanilla infused, organic light corn syrup so did not add any extract. It worked great and tasted very good.

For a person that has never baked before this recipe was soooo easy to follow and make it work! I was so happy and thrilled because I've always bought sugar cookies at the stores just because they had this type of icing! It was great! I didn't have any corn syrup so I had to use a substitute but it still worked heavenly! The taste was great! Thank you so much!!!! I loved it!

Great recipe!  I had to a little extra milk to the recipe to thin it out for how I wanted it to work and I also took the suggestion of one of the reviewer's below and added lemon extract (in addition to the almond).  The extra taste was perfect!

Added extra milk and corn syrup like everyone else, but it turned out so pretty and glossy that I didn't care that I had to add a bit extra! It tastes great. I added vanilla instead of almond due to personal preference, and I'll have to practice getting the icing onto the cookie perfectly, but it turned out beautiful, and that's from someone who can't ice cookies to save her life!

Produced icing of a great consistency and nice flavor. I actually had to substitute pancake syrup (what I had on hand) for the corn syrup, and it turned out OK.

Very good recipe to go with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookie off of Allrecipes. I'm not a baker so it took some time for me to finally get it to a nice paintable texture. Also, I had a problem with the icing not being glossy. 1/2 of them were but the other 1/2 was kind of dull. Not sure why. Maybe more icing? Double layer icing? Like I said, I'm not a baker.

I tried this recipe and well it was too sweet and i wasnt very fond of the over powering almond extract. It was very sticky and took a long while to dry so my family got a little upset when they had to wait a while i would suggest using vallila extract insted of almond and maybe adding a lil more milk.

I tried this recipe instead of my usual butter one this year (I usually use the 'Decorator Frosting' from this site).  We really like this frosting--the colors definitely were more vivid, and you can still decorate with sprinkles and such.   I did have to add a little more milk.  Also, I had to 2 and 1/2 the recipe to cover the 'Best Rolled Sugar Cookies' from this site (I was also frosting with kids so they probably use more than they needed!).  They are definitely good-looking and good-tasting cookies!  And, they will still look that way when I transport them because the frosting hardens--no smudges!

The icing was exactly as described and it had a very nice glossy finish which the professional bakers have.  Becareful if you are changing the serving size as some of the ingredient did not change to reflect a larger serving.

SOoo easy! and very good!  My kids (ages 11 and 13) make this themselves and decorated the cookies.  My son experimented a little by adding peppermint and lemon extracts in place of the almond.  They both turned out good.  They did need to add a little more milk to achieve the right consistency.

This recipe makes great icing! I have looked and looked and looked some more for icing that yields professional looking results. My search is over,this is it! I do recommend adding more milk than what the recipe calls for. Add it in small amounts until the right consistancy is reached. I put the icing in sandwich bags, snipped off the end and piped it on the cookies. It worked great!

Thanks for a winning recipe~

This recipe was really tasty and hit the spot for what I was looking for.  In an attempt to make it *slightly* healthier, I used 3 C of all purpose flour mixed w/ 2 C whole wheat flour.  The mix was a little sticky, but baked up beautifully and were a hit w/ everyone!

This was a shiny and professional looking icing. I liked the fact that it didn't contain meringue powder because I don't use it. I substituted a homemade sugar syrup and it worked just great.

I had a little trouble getting the icing to cooperate but this was my first time making iced cookies!  It is a good base recipe that you can cartainly play around with it.  I adding as much as 1 tsp more of milk and corn syrup for certain batches and it always dried beautifully with just the right amount of shine.  Try substituting butterscotch for almond extract, it is delicious!

These LOOKED so great -- the frosting held really nice, bright colors!

Tasted yummy too, but I think I'll actually try them with vanilla extract next time.

this worked great.  set up nice.  i had to triple the recipe and added more milk and corn starch to get it the right consistency.  i also subbed vanilla instead of almond flavoring.

Makes a nice drizzling glaze for cookies.  I used this on "Big, Soft Ginger Cookies" from this site.  Replaced the almond extract with vanilla, used food coloring to make the icing orange, and had to add in a little more milk and sugar.  Just add a little of each until you get the consitency you want.  Makes a very pretty shine on the cookies!

Good icing but I had to add more milk and corn syrup to be able to dip them otherwise there was way too much on each cookie...But it tastes good and dries nice and overall I will use it again!

Ok. That's all this icing was. It was ok. I didn't think it had an amazing flavor. I would only use it again for cut out cookies that I wanted to look nice, but not taste amazing. I had to play around with the consistency, too, because using the recipe exactly did not work for me at all. It wasn't horrible, just, I would've liked it to taste better.

A wonderful, wonderful icing, just perfect for sugar cookies. I usually use vanilla instead of almond, and I've used both liquid and the more gel-like colourings with no problems. I used oil-based Wilton candy colouring today and it was great (I happened to have Halloween colours in it!). So good... But for me one batch makes more than 12 cookies' worth. I always forget and double it, and have tons leftover. I use this icing on "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" by Jill... Try them together! Thanks for sharing, JBS BOX!!

A gorgeous icing that dries perfectly on the cookies. Shiny, flavorful and hard. I feel bad giving it only four stars but it is amazingly sweet, which is more a problem with my taste buds than with the recipe. Maybe if I made it thinner?? But then I think it would slide off the cookie so maybe I should stick with unfrosted cookies :-)

I am giving this four stars as written because I had to increase the amounts of corn syrup and milk to get the right consistency.

This is very easy to make, however, and it looks nice and shiny when it dries. I subbed vanilla for the almond extract and it worked out fine.

I plan on using this for gingerbread men during the holidays.

This is very yummy icing and dries perfect! I had to add extra milk (1/2 tsp at a time) to get to right consistency. I had to make 2 batches of icing to cover the cookies initially.I also tried using both vanilla and almond extract - the vanilla tastes better (in my opinion). Be sure to add your food coloring while trying to get the right consistency of your icing - my red turned out too thin by the time I put enough drops in it. I also used a icing bag with piping tip to decorate (worked great). Be sure to allow plenty of time for icing to dry - may still be wet inside even though looks dry on outside! Cookies will smear otherwise.

This icing is so pretty!  Everyone was so impressed with how professional the cookies looked!  The only problem I had with this was the amount of milk, but once i upped the amount to 3-4 tablespoons it was great!  I'll use it again!

Very nice icing once dry, but it can take awhile to set up.  I used gel food coloring, so as not to thin out the icing too much.

I used this to ice "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" on this site.  I did have to double it several times (I had a bunch of cookies to frost).  I kept the corn syrup on the scant side and it turned out perfectly.  I got so many complements on the cookies AND the frosting.  Next time I might try vanilla in place of the almond extract.

Excellent and easy. I seem to have to add more milk and corn syrup to the recipe, but it still hardens to a shine. This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe.  I was looking for an icing that would dry hard and still taste yummy and look great, this was the one.  I was able to make good looking sugar cookies for my childrens classrooms.  The children loved them.

This is a great recipe for decorating sugar cookies. I used slightly more milk than called for in order to get the right consistency. Just add the extra milk a few drops at a time until you get the spreadability you need. The icing turns out shiny and really dresses up your cookies.

This will be my new decorated cookie icing.  I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the almond extract.  The cookies looked awesome and it was so easy to decorate with.  Since the cookies looked so good I was leary about how the frosting would actually taste, it was delicious.  It looked like it would taste hard and dry but it didn't at all and was the perfect amount of sweetness.

Very good but salty.  I would decrease the salt to 1/2 teas next time.  Used a very basic butter icing--yummy!

This recipe is fabulous!  I found that I needed a little more milk than it called for to make the icing workable.  When it dries, this icing is nice and hard, makes the cookies very easy to pack!

Awesome icing to pair with the best rolled sugar cookies.  I added cocoa powder and used vanilla extract instead.  This is a recipe I will use again and again since sugar cookies are my son's favorite.

This recipe is fabulous! It really is easy to work with. It stays where you put it, dries fast and looks amazing. I will submit a picture from my daughters sweet sixteen. I covered them with pink and piped letter L's on them for "Lydia".
I mixed this with 4tsp of milk. Two were not enough.

I made this today and it worked great, but I had a couple of problems that were probably my fault :). The glaze was a bit too runny and more ran off the cookie than I would have liked, and as it dried it had more of a mottled look. that's ok though, they're not perfect but close to it!

I love the texture, the shine and the ease of making this icing. Its prefect for decorating. However, I think the taste is a little sugary - but that's my palate. I still use this recipe over any other as the look is so wonderful. I add a little extra flavoring to alter the taste.

This icing was alright.. the consistency was really really thick at first (definitely needs more milk than it calls for, I doubled what it said) and afterwards thought I should probably double the almond extract too. For me, the end result was an icing that had too much almond flavor. My boyfriend liked the icing, though, but it was a little too much almond for me. It does dry nicely. I think that next time I use this recipe I will use vanilla extract instead of almond, and double what it calls for in milk.

Upped the almond extract amount a tiny bit and added plenty of food coloring, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as specified. Turned out beautifully, spread easily, tasted great (everyone commented on the almond flavoring) and the icing dried nice and shiny and hard, just as I wanted it too. Not sure about people who needed more liquids - turned out fine for me.

This came out delicious, but like other reviewers, I had to add A LOT of corn syrup and a little milk to thin it out.  It dried smooth and glossy, though.

i do have to say that i loved the look of this icing, but i didnt like that it tasted like pure powdered sugar (which it is, i know).  maybe adding a touch more almond would help.  but it was extremely easy to make and spread.  and did taste like true christmas cookie icing.  i used 3 tsp of milk in order to get the right consistency.  hard to go wrong with this recipe.  thank you!

I made sugar cookies with this icing for Christmas and they were INCREDIBLE! The icing dries so quickly and nicely, unlike other icings i have used. 5 stars! Will be using every year! Maybe next year i will use vanilla instead of almond extract for a different flavor. But either way, it was a huge hit!

I was extremely pleased with this icing! Turned out just the way I wanted it to. I didn't have any light corn syrup, so i used a simple syrup instead and it seemed to work fine. Also, I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla.

Makes really nice professional looking cookies,and the icing hardens nicely.  I did notice the flavor of the icing was best 1-2 days after making.  Will use again! Thanks!

This is so beautiful, I doubled it to use with one batch of cookies, but I didn't have a paint brush and think I wasted quite a bit. It's beautiful even after it dries.

Great Recipe.  This was my first Christmas using real icing, instead of just sprinkles.  I used 1/2 teaspoon  creme bouquet (icing flavoring) and 1/2 teap of vanilla.  I can't stop eating them.  YUM

Wonderful!  The only change I made was some extra milk and cornstarch to make it the right consistency for spreading and painting.  First I spread it with either white, red, blue, or yellow icing and then the kids (ages 4 and 3) and I went to town painting them!  This is going to be a new tradition in our house and will give us many holiday memories throughout the years!  Thank you!

This icing is great. My cookies turned out beautiful. I have never been able to put so much detail into a cookie until I came across this icing. I used clear vanilla extract instead of the almond.

This tasted really good.  It was nice and shiny and my kids raved over it.  The only reason I gave it a 4 was because I had to adjust the recipe when I made it to serve 48.  Very good.

All it need was just a little more liquid to make it easy enough for my 5 year old to work with. He made some wonderful cookies for Santa this year! The only issue I had was that it definitely did not make enough for 12 LARGE cookies, I had to double the recipe. The taste however was awesome!

By following the instructions the icing was so thick it was ridiculous. I did need to add quite abit more milk and corn syrup. When I got the consistency right it did spread nicely though semi-transparent. I was hoping for alittle more bold color. Well, I'll keep tweaking I'm only half way done with my sugar cookies!

I didn't care for this icing. It looks alright and all, but it doesn't taste all that great and it dries out quickly. I'll save my ingredients for something easier to work with...

The frosting tasted good and was shiny. I am very new to baking so I very well could have done something wrong but when I made it, the frosting didn't make nearly enough. I had to triple the recipe and then make some more later. Also, I added a touch of lemon extract and then the rest vanilla and it tasted very good.  I ended up with a mess and frosting that kept drying out. My cookies definitely looked like a beginner made them!

The icing is delicious but definitely not something I could "paint" on. I ended up adding double, if not more, the amount of corn syrup the recipe stated to get to a spreadable consistency. Even then, it was still really difficult to spread. I ended up drizzling the icing over my cookies for a graffiti-like effect. Despite it being harder to work with, it tasted delicious and looked beautiful.

Was not a big fan of this recipe.  Needed more milk added and didn't really like the almond extract.  I will try it again but will use vanilla.

A good start to an icing, but I nearly tripled the milk to make it a good consistency. I doubled it and it covered aobut 45 cookies.

This was very easy, although I agree with others that almond extract has no place here!  Loved it with lemon.  Very easy to work with, although our cookies took a long time to dry - I did play around with measurements to get right consistency, so I might have made it too thin.  We didn't do anything fancy - just spread the icing and let our 2 1/2 year old decorate with various sprinkles and colored sugars.  Which reminds me, I was a bit worried about clean-up, but despite the food coloring everything (and everyBODY!) cleaned up in a snap!

As written, this was way to thick for dipping. painting or drizzling as is suggested in the recipe.  I had to add at least another tablespoon of corn syrup (perhaps a little more, start with a teaspoon or two, beat and add more if you need to).  In the end, it worked beautifully and I am quite happy with the results.  Very worth the small effort to make.  I'm only sorry that I didn't check my food coloring supply -- only had orange and black!  Not good for my pretty Christmas stars, so white looks very nice with edible glitter sprinkled on them.

First, I doubled the recipe--it doesn't make very much. Like previous reviews, I had to add more liquid, but once I got it thin enough it was perfect! (The second time, I started by doubling the corn syrup and milk--that was close, but still not enough.) The dressing dried hard with a wonderfully glossy finish. I liked the almond flavoring too. Thanks for a recipe I will use over and over. (I've already used it twice.)

I thought this was good. I substituted vanilla extract instead of almond extract.  It took a couple of tries before I actually got the consistency of what I wanted.  The color was great, easy to use once I got to where I wanted to be.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is what ive been looking for! i cant believe i found it!
It is sort of bland
I cut the recipie in half but left the milk alone. At first i was reluctant to add milk then i saw that i had to and added total of 2 tsp with my halved recipie. and from what ive read from others most have doubled thier milk.

An icing that leaves your cookies exceptionally shiny and boldly colored.  However, the taste left a lot to be desired, very bland.  And I was looking for a thick glaze to pour over my cookies.  I needed to add a lot more corn syrup to make this pourable (or even paintable) and when the icing dried it wasn't thick at all - I could still see the cookie through the icing.  I'll keep looking.  Just depends on what you're looking for.

I doubled the recipe for 36 pumpkin cut out cookies.  I also added more milk & a little more corn syrup.  I added vanilla flavoring & omitted the almond extract.
Frosting sets up great!

It's a good recipe, but I had to add about a teaspoon more milk in the beginning to even get the confectioner's sugar to trn smooth. Then I had to had a half of a teaspoon of cornsyrup to make it less thick. I might add more before I add it to my cookies, which I haven't done yet. Maybe it will get more stars after I ice the cookies and see how it turned out. But as for the amount of ingredients I definitely felt like it need more.

I like the concept of this recipe, but need to make it again to do some tweaking.  When I made the icing, I felt like I just kept adding and adding and adding the corn syrup and milk because it was so dry.  If you have the same experience I did, make sure to adjust the almond extract accordingly, if you like almond flavor.  I did end up adding more, but it wasn't nearly enough.  My icing never really completely dried all the way through, but maybe it was too liquidy?  The outside did dry though and the result was, as other reviews have said, beautiful, shiny  and colorful cookies.  Will definitely keep working with the recipe to make it work.

Excellent on "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies", just needs a little more milk. (Add sugar to milk). I liked the flavor much better on the second day.

I use this recipe with the "Sugar Cookies with Buttercream Frosting" recipe on this site.  Have made the icing several times, and love it.  Like other reviewers, I add more milk to make the icing spreadable, but it dries beautifully and holds color well.  Have used vanilla, almond, and lemon extract -- find that they all seem to taste better the next day. Will try peppermint next.  Thanks!

I fully agree with the other reviews of this recipe. It is fabulous, but you definitely have to "play" around with the milk and corn syrup amounts to arrive at the desired consistency. While I am not a huge lemon fan, either vanilla or almond extract can be used with an equally delicious result. I also agree on the drying time- to get the best finish, I allow the cookies to dry overnight. I have had nothing but rave reviews!

As with other reviewers I had a tough time with the consistency so I worked with small batches and frequently warmed icing up in the microwave for 5 seconds or so just to resofen it.  It worked great for me, loved the look and taste on my cookies.

I thought the taste of the recipe was great, but I had to add about 3-4 times more corn syrup! The frosting was way too thick without it. Also, the frosting became harder and harder to spread over time because it started to dry and became thick. I will try this recipe again, but I will probably make some changes to see if I can improve consistency.

Very good on top of the Cream Cheese Sugar Cookie recipe from the site.  The only thing is the icing doesnt really set up or harden.  So if you was to set cookies on top of each other the icing would get messed up.  It stays nice and soft but it makes it taste nice and creamy that way!

This recipe is fantastic!! I had to add another teaspoon of milk after it was all mixed but other then that its perfect.  I did change one thing instead of almond extract I added a 1/2 teaspoon of rum and 1/2 teaspon pure vanilla and they flew off the plate.

This was the best cookie icing I have ever worked with.  I enjoy adding coconut extract for a different flavor that we all enjoy.  Thanks for sharing a new favorite for our family.

Easy to make, easy to spead, and looked beautiful.  What's more, it tasted good, too!  It was a little dry as I was mixing it, but I just added a little more cornsyrup as the recipe directs.

I did alter this a bit. I added a bit more milk and corn syrup. I prefer to dip the cookies rather than ice them and this allowed a better consistency for doing such. I also used vanilla rather than the almond extract it calls for. My crew prefers the almond flovoring.

This recipe worked out great.  I added more milk and corn syrup like another reviewer said and it worked great.  We had a lot of new little paint brushes and my boys and I had a blast painting our sugar cookie.

This is an outstanding icing....professional looking and tasty.  I will not use any other one now that I found this one.  You do have to add a tad more milk to make it spreadable but it is so worth it!

Prepared according to the recipe this icing was way to think! I added a splash of milk to thin it out so I could apply is nicely to the cookies. Other than that it turned out great.

The recipe requires more milk than indicated..about two tsp. more milk. 
Here's my story..I used the Wilton's Icing (In the glue container like applicator...which give so much great control!) and I ran out..and I needed to refill the container. So..I wanted a recipe with no funky egg white..for cookies (and one that would harden and be shiny and yummy). So..I used this one and I was pleased. I used orange extract (instead of vanilla) and it turned out really nice tasting! Others on here tried lemon..and I would like to try that too. It might even be yummy to use an orange flavored frosing over a chocolate sugar cookie. Anyway...this recipe is great!

Make sure you use sturdy sugar cookies for this recipe,because if you use real thin sugar cookies while spreading the glaze the cookie will crumble apart. I had to add some extra corn syrup to make it more creamy. Also I would not advise dipping your cookies into the glaze but spreading the glaze with a butter knife. I did not add almond extract because most people don't know it has alcohol in it and I am allergic to alcohol. SO PAY ATTENTION THIS HOLIDAY SEASON WHEN EATING OTHER PEOPLES BAKED GOODS.

Good recipe, but extra milk and corn syrup will need to be added, because the recipe as stated will make the consistency TOO thick.

This icing was just "ehhh". It tasted too much like confectioner's sugar to me, no matter what I did. It does dry very nicely, however.

Thought this was very easy and tasted good.  However, I did double the milk but not the corn syrup.  Without more mile it would have been way too thick.

I needed a frosting that would harden so I could use the food color markers, but in the end the taste was too sugary, and bland. Not worth cool looking cookies.

Overall a decent recipe cause I liked not having to use raw egg whites.  However the ratios are off.  I needed more milk to make the icing less stiff and easier to stir.  All the ingredients are there...just keep playing with it to make it the right consistency.  Also, the flavor was only ok in my opinion...might be better with more extract?

Wonderful recipe!  As others  have   noted, you have to adjust to get the consistency you desire, but it is SUPER easy and tastes delicious.  I use a pastry brush to paint the cookies.   Wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!

Being a bread pudding newbie, I have no basis for comparison.  This was my first experiment with and experience with Bread Pudding and I must say that I really like it.  This was delicious.  I hesitate to give it 5 stars only because I've never had any other bread pudding.  Very Good!

Every bit as good as it says - icing can be thinned for piping or left thicker for spreading. I found the original recipe rather too thick, so I thinned it out and  dipped cookies in it. Tastes wonderful!

This was a good recipe.  The almond flavor was a nice touch.  I decorated my Easter cookies with this icing and luster dust.  My only complaint is that it took a while to dry which kind of slowed down the whole operation.  I'll use it again though.

This is looks and tastes excelent if you can get the right consistency. It is way to dry so I added about 1/2 cup more milk but then it was too wet and kept dripping off the cookies. It is really shiny and pretty though.

Used this recipe to decorate cookies made from The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie.  Icing is simple and easy to make -- didn't have to lug out the mixer (again).  Colors stayed vibrant and glossy once dried.  Will use again and again.  Thanks!

This is exactely what I was looking for in that it was shiny and good color but I was dissapointed with the flavor. I like a more flavorful buttercream type icing on my cookies, but if you are after good decorating quality this would be it.

This is everything that cookie icing should be. It's delicious and pretty. I followed someone else's suggestion on here and added lemon and butter flavors along with the almond extract. So good!

This Icing was great! It hardened wonderfully, and spread on perfect!
I did make 2 changes, (1 I put in 4 tsp. of milk instead of 2 (I could barely stir it it was so thick)
(2 I used Orange extract instead of almond, it was great that way!
I will use this again!

Wasn't quite as easy to use as I was hoping, but was still good for our Christmas cookies. I used clean paint brushes and let the kids go at it.

worked great! Just like everyone said! Happy to find one without eggs as well! I too add the extra milk. Instead of just the almond, I added half almond and half lemon extract. Normally I also add some vanilla as well--the three combos are awesome together, my Mom has always done professional cake decorating icing with all 3 together, I ran out of clear vanilla this time though. Thanks for the simple recipe! Merry Christmas!

Good recipe, but I agree with earlier review that Janice must have meant 2 Tablespoons of milk--not 2 teaspoons.  I also added a little warm water as I like a very thin glaze on my sugar cookies so it's not quite so sweet.  Also, I will half the amount of almond extract in the future as I found it a little strong.

This recipe is the best I have tried a lot of them on this site and you have gotten it down!  Thank you so very much.  They are easy to write on with the betty crocker pens and the kids have a great time decorating them. All the teachers and kids get so excited when I tell them I am bringing in Hunybe's Sugar Cookies... Thank you again.
Hunybe's Mommy.

I must have used cheap paint brushes, first of all, because I found little hairs in the surface of cookies. Also, the consistency was a runny and looked opaque. Will try again to see if I did something wrong.

This did hold color well, but the taste wasn't great to me.  I used lemon juice instead to add flavor.  Also, it was a bit too runny for detailed decorations.

great recipe! (used the suggestion of doubling the milk).  had my 2 1/2 year old helping with the frosting of the cookies...got a bit messy at times...but in the end after the icing dried, the cookies all looked perfect!  will definitely use for future holiday cookies!

I followed other suggestions and added more milk and corn syrup.  I forgot the vanilla in a couple of batches and it still tasted fine!  It dried nice and shiny and stacks great.

This was a very easy, quick recipe. I let my kids used (new) paintbrushes with the frosting to paint their cookies. The frosting was a great consistency, not too runny, not too stiff. The frosting set up wonderfully, perfect for stacking in a tin for gift-giving.

I have used this recipe several times and love it!  I cook the "Best Rolled Cookies" and ice them with this icing.  This icing is really great for a marbling effect - put one color icing on the cookie, then another (and another...) and swirl with a toothpick or the back of a spoon.  Dries perfectly after several hours!  Thanks for sharing such a terrific recipe!

What an excellent recipe!  So easy to adjust the thickness with an extra drop of liquid or another spoonful of sugar.  Dries hard and shiny everytime...what a hit!

Flexible recipe!  I didn't really pay attention to the amount of ingredients because I wanted a certain consistancy.  I was able to add more powdered sugar and corn syrup to make a thicker paste-like icing.  Also, when I used food coloring I found that I had to add more powdered sugar to regain thick consistancy.  My cookies turned out beautiful!  I also used Vanilla instead of Almond Extract.  I will definitely use again!

Yummy! After reading the other reviews, I sifted the confectioners' sugar before mixing it, and it turned out perrrfect!  Turned out glossy and dried hard just like expected.

I substituted vanilla for the almond extract and also added extra milk and corn syrup.  The icing decorated the cookies beautifully.  My problem is the flavor -- it tastes strongly like confectioners sugar.  I'll have to get more opinions from others who sample the cookies - -maybe it's just me.  Either way, the cookies look so nice I'll probably use this recipe again anyway.

This is the best recipe for shiny, colorful sugar cookie icing if you follow the advice of the other reviewers and fiddle with the ratio of dry to wet ingredients. I also only use vanilla extract -- for some reason, the almond extract was really yucky the one time I tried it.

This was awesome icing. Had to play with the liquid measurements a bit. I just made Halloween cookies - orange pumpkins with green stems and vines, and white ghosts with purple faces.  I used a toothpick to do detail work. They looked so professional! I can't wait to try the icing using other extracts. By the way, my kids and their friends couldn't keep their fingers out of the icing bowls!
