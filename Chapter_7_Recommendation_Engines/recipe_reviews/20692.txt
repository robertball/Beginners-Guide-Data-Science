I did not try her receipe but I do make one very similiar. 
I butter the pieces of breadtop and bottom; instead of melting the butter and then pouring it over the mixture.
I would never use a processd cheese though, I usually mix a bag of shredded cheese in with the egg mixture and some chopped onion and dump that over the bread.  I don't add anything but a little salt and pepper.
This receipe is very easy and can be so easily altered with different cheeses or meats.  It is my Easter brunch receipe, I make two of these the night before stick them in the fridge and in the morning pop them in the oven.  So easy.
Very good tasting.

I really had to work on this recipe and finally got it to where my family absolutly loves it.  I slice a loaf of french bread, use 6 eggs, 3 cups of milk and 2 cups of grated sharp cheddar, 1 lb of sausage (cooked and drained), 2 tabls. of fresh parsley, 1/2 teas. salt and 3/4 teas dry mustard.  I buttered 9x13 dish and cover bottom with bread.  Add cheese, sausage and parsley.  Combine eggs, milk, salt and dry mustard. Pour over mixture. I let my sit over night in frig and bake in the morning for 1 hour. You can also add dill, onion and a few more eggs.  This is a great left over dish too.

My kids said they liked this but I don't expect them to ask me to make it again.  I didn't think it tasted bad, but it tasted just like the ingredients - mushy bread, ham, and processed cheese.  Except for the fact that it was held in a square the eggs were undetectable (and I even added an extra one by mistake). This is not something I would serve to company.  It sort of reminded me of something you would get in a school cafeteria.

I doubt I will try this again.  If I do I will make several changes.  First, I would use a sturdier bread (french as opposed to the wheat that I used), I would substitute real cheese for processed (probably a combination of cheddar and something else), I would cut back on the milk and butter too.

My sister in law made this one and she did shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese and added Special K to the top just before she baked it.  It was great, enjoyed by all.

OUTSTANDING!!!  After reading reviews, made a few changes.  Made homemade bread (in bread maker), buttered both sides, used shredded cheddar more eggs and milk....yum.  Made it for some friends at a garage raising and it was a hit, super easy.  Great with Salsa on the side!

I only made one change and that was using 8 ounces shredded sharp cheddar cheese as I did not have processed cheese slices. We tried to like this but it just wasn't for us. We had to eat it because that was really all we had. It was very mushy in texture and really didn't have much flavor. I could see how this could be good, I suppose--maybe if you used more bread or maybe toasted it before you used it to dry it out a bit? Maybe it was the bread I used. I'm not sure. I won't be trying it again to find out.

So easy.  I had all the ingredients on hand for unexpected lunch guests.  I also buttered the bread on both sides as a replacement for the melted butter.  I also added pepper to taste.  I only had time to refrigerate for an hour but that was long enough.  Great recipe and I wouldn't hesitate to make again for guests.  There were four of us eating and the whole pan was gone.  I would make two pans if you have more than four guests.  Thank you for this gem!

I copied a bunch of these casseroles to try and this has been my first so far. It was so good. My husband ate most of it on us though so I have to make it again. I only used one cup of milk and I chopped up sausage instead of the ham because I didn't have any on hand. Even my son ate it and he is extremely picky.

The taste was good but the texture wasn't. I used 6 white bread slices...which were mushy no matter how long I baked it.  Long after the eggs had "set," the bottom was still mush.  In addition to the ham, I sauted some broccoli, mushrooms and onions and sprinkled it with the ham. Also,I added som onion and garlic powder to the egg mixrure. We ate this one but I doubt I'd make again, which is too bad b/c this was a very easy brunch recipe.

My husband proclaimed this "the best egg bake thing" he ever ate. I made two changes to the recipe: the first was to butter both sides of the bread instead of melting the butter, and the second was to add some diced sweet red bell pepper. Otherwise I followed the recipe, possibly adding a few minutes to the baking time (forgot to set the timer - oops!) The bread toasted up nicely on the bottom.

I wanted to make this but had no bread, so I rolled out some refrigerator biscuits and lined the bottom of the dish.  Bake the biscuits about halfway then layer on other ingredients. Also I used sausage, instead of ham, and added red pepper and onion with the meat layer. Yumm!

I make this with six eggs and no butter and add 1 TBL dried minced onion to the egg mixture. Also add s & p.The last 10 min. I sprinkle cheddar cheese on top. If yours is mushy you didn't bake it long enough. If I don't make this every Easter morning, I'll be locked out of the house!

I substituted cheddar for the processed cheese, and changed the ratios of the ingredients per slice of bread as follows: 1 slice (about 3/4 oz) cheese, 4 Tbsp diced ham, 1 tsp butter, 1 egg, 1/4 cup milk, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp dry mustard.  Instead of pouring melted butter over the ham, I started by buttering one side of the bread and placing it buttered-side down in an ungreased pan.  I then added the cheese, ham, and egg mixture.  I baked at 350F for around 45 minutes.  My modified version of the recipe has half as much milk per egg as in the original recipe, and this set nicely without the mushiness some other reviewers have commented on.

I changed this recipe a little. Instead of using ham I used sliced sausage links and instead of american cheese I used provolone cheese. I put garlic powder, onion powder, and italian seasonings with the eggs. It came out really good and the cheese melted better than the american cheese.

I don't know if it's because the ham I used was left over maple falvoured or if it was the mustard, but there was a dominant flavour I didn't like.  I followed as close as possible using the processed cheese but reduced the milk a little as we were out.  

Also I was unsure if you cook it covered or uncovered. 

I guess it depends on what you like in your house.  I served it with baked beans which helped.  I won't make it again.

I used real shredded cheese and added some cream into the eggmixture - about a half a cup. I put in some green onions and covered the top with shredded cheese, cover with foil and cooked for 45mins then uncovered and cooked another 20mins until browned.

I really did a lot of changes on this one but it was delicious.  There is only hubby and I and there was still more than half left (only because I'm trying to lose weight!)  I made it in an 8 x 8 glass dish, sprayed with Pam.  I used 9 cocktail rounds for the bread, which fit pefectly.  I doubled the cheese to 2 c.  I layered that on top, then half a green pepper chopped, and half an onion, chopped, then sprinkled Bacos on top of that.  I eliminated the butter entirely.  I mixed the 4 eggs with only 1 c. of milk, adding 1/4 t. salt, 1/4 t. pepper and 1 t. dry mustard.  I still baked it for an hour but maybe this was my mistake.  The recipe said to cover and refrig overnight.  I did not do this but it never said to uncover it to bake, so I left the foil on which made it a little soupy.  The taste was all there though.  I will try this again definitely but this time leaving it uncovered and see how it goes.  With the changes I made, a definite keeper.  Thanks Shari for putting me in the direction of getting this great casserole together!

Great dish, but the directions were not complete.  Ingredient lists melted butter, but the directions don't tell what to do with it.  I'm not good at 'guessing' about recipes, but had to in this case.  It turned out great but i'd love to know what the creator intended.  Really easy and delicious.

Extremely easy, but not my favorite.  I added bacon the second time around, which improved it in my opinion, a great deal.

Super easy and yummy! After reading reviews, I also buttered the bottom of the bread slices and added onion to the eggs. Everyone loved it! I'll definitely be making this again!

Made for the children for breakfast for a change.  2 out of 3 kids loved it.  The egg was light and fluffy.  Next time I will use grated cheese and add some leek or onion and capsicum or even try diced chicken.  I enjoyed it too.

This turned out really tasty when we first made it but the leftovers did not hold up quite as well.  I used the Ironkids Crustless bread (1 WW point for 2 slices) and muenster cheese.

This is basically French toast with cheese. To save some time and make it less soggy, fry in a pan and throw some cheese on it.

Didn't hold together all that well. Only use bacon on it, as the meats all together give it a greasy taste.

I think using shredded cheese would have a definite advantage as not so salty as cheese slices, used Velveeta and no salt.  Threw in 1/2 cup of chopped green onions and took the crusts of the bread.  Not bad.

I do not make this the night before. Make it in the morning and bake it same day, that will make the mushy part go away. I do not use as much milk when baking the same day. Just enough with your eggs to cover your bread and tear your bread in pieces. It is really yummy this way, I do not like mushy...

Very good recipe, you can omit the ham and have a nice vegetarian alternative too.

I made this once before and knew it was lacking something, but couldn't put my finger on it. This time, I poured syrup over each individual hot serving! To die for! Everyone loved it!

I made this for New Year's Day breakfast.  I used grated cheddar instead of processed slices and threw in all the leftover ham.  It was lovely and rich and filling.  The next time I try it I think I'll add some mushrooms and green peppers as well.

After seeing reviews of adaptions, I used 6 large eggs, buttered the bread on both sides, and sprinkled sharp cheddar on top (used sliced Colby jack for the original) It was yummy! I would like for it to have been a tad firmer but the taste is great!
