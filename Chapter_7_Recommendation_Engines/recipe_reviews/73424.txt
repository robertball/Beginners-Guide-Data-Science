this recipe was great! i didnt have terriaki sauce so i made my own ( 1/2 cup soy sauce, one half cup sherry, and 2/3 of a cup of japanese rice wine, 2 tablespoons of sugar. let it boil first, then simmer at medium- low heat for about 15 minutes or until its reduced to 3/4 cup.) i also used WAY less butter, and about half of the amount of cashews. i made it into a meal by adding terriaki steak, and it was awesome! my parents also loved it.

Wow, this was delicious and SO easy!  :)  i fried up some chicken with it, since it was our main course, used WAY less butter to fry up the cashews (and used about half the amount of cashews), and added some garlic powder and black pepper to the teriyaki sauce, which gave it a nice kick!  I served it with steamed brocoli.  My husband raved about it, and we will be having it again!  :)

Wonderful Flavors! I used brown rice instead of linguine. Used about 3tbs of butter total and a splash of olive oil. Added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to sauteing cashews. I'll definitely make this again. The cashews were wonderful!

I doubled this, only I used a package of coleslaw mix instead of more pasta.I did not double the nuts, as I chopped the cashews in my Pampered Chef hand chopper, which I sprinkled over the linguini. I also added fresh diced garlic in the "sauce". Awesome dish. And very simple. My whole family loved it.

I made this today and I made some changes but still thought it deserved a perfect rating. I added the garlic like one review stated. I also used less cashewsand less butter, added mushrooms and temphe. Very good recipe!

We really enjoyed this as a meatless dinner.  I added some snow peas for more vegetables.  It is a great one pot meal (plus a colander).  I did add just  half of the butter that was called for and used whole wheat pasta to make it healthier. This is a keeper for a quick and easy weeknight meal! Thanks!

This is a great recipe, and you can add veggies and chicken to it to make a whole meal.  I think next time I will cut down on the butter and I'll add some garlic.  This is also really easy to throw together, and on a Monday night (or any weeknight) that counts for a lot!

Excellent as a side dish. I started by using a Tblsp. or two of olive oil,instead of butter,sauteed 2 cloves of minced garlic and a couple of tsps. fresh ginger. Then added about 3/4 c. cashew pieces. Tossed in the rest just to heat. Delicious!

Very yummy and easy to make. I used way less cashews and butter and it turned out great. I would recommend a low sodium teriyaki sauce because it was quite salty for my taste. Does that even exist?

I thought this was pretty good, but my husband didn't like it at all. Probably won't make again.

This is a very nice base recipe that is quite versatile.  I used sesame oil instead of butter,  about 5 oz cashews, & added broccoli, snow peas, baby bellas, water chestnuts! Next time I will add garlic when browning the cashews.
