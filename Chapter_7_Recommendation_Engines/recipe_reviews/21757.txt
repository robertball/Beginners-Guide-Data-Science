I didn't use the amaretto (it was for a baby shower, why even go near alcohol!) and just the pudding/coolwhip combo was excellent!!

This is great - have made it for years, substitute Kahlua for the Ammeretto.  Someone else mentioned that it makes too much... FREEZE IT - let thaw for 30 minutes and instant hit!
I usually put half of dip back into coolwhip container and freeze right away.

This was great: it was delicious and EASY. Brought it to a party and served with pineapple, strawberries, canteloupe, poundcake and vanilla wafer cookies. I used Lite whipped topping and skim milk - it was delicious. It was a hit; so easy to make and transport to a party- many asked for the recipe. I tried the "Carla's Fruit Dip" recipe on this site, also - and it was good - but this one is better.

Delicious! Try serving this with some fruit kabobs. I alternated layers of store bought angel food cake and sliced strawberries on skewers and served them with this dip and chocolate dip. It was the hit of the party. It is so attractive and everyone kept telling me what a neat idea it was.

Wonderful dip--very light.  I halfed the recipe (it still made 4 cups) and used 1/2tsp of almond extract in place of the amaretto liqueur.  I also used extra creamy cool whip.  My guest loved it and the bowl was clean by the end of the night.  I will keep this recipe at the front of my recipe box!!!  Easy and good

So easy and very good.  Don't chill for more than an hour though or the texture isn't as nice.

I used half of this recipe and there was plenty for a large mixed fruit bowl. It was really delicious and would even consider using it as a frosting for cakes instead of just Cool Whip. The only thing is, for half a recipe even 1/4 cup amaretto was a little overpowering. I would try 1/8 cup next time or 1/4 cup for the full recipe.

Good recipe. Makes a large amount so you might want to cut all ingredients in half. Its great as is, but if you want variety, try using RAZZMATAZZ (a raspberry liquer) in place of the amaretto. Thanks for a wonderful fruit and dessert dip Carolyn.

This dip was an absolute hit!  I made mine with Chambord berry liquer in place of the amaretto.  It was so good that some of my guests added a scoop of it on top of their pound cake too.  Super easy and tasty!

This dip was wonderful. I served it with fresh pineapple, honeydew, cantaloupe, grapes, apples, plums and strawberries. I added 5 drops of red food coloring to the dip to complement the strawberries. It turned out a pale pink. The apples weren't well received but the rest of the fruit went fast. My husband loved it. I'll make it again for my next party.

I made this for a girls night and it was amazing! The measurements were off but i worked it out. I used one container of fat free cool whip, 2 shots (not a 1/2 cup..to much) of amaretto, 1/2 cup of 2% milk, and 1 small box of vanilla pudding. Made a good amount too! I will make this again and again

Very good!  Instead of the amaretto liquer I added a tsp of almond extract and it gave the dip a very nice cherry flavor.  Thanks for sharing!!

I am sooo glad someone else, besides myself, could not get this to work with the measurements posted!!  I had to add wayyyy more milk just like the person direcly below me.  After I played with it for a very long time, it finally came together.  The taste was good, but believe me, it was to much work & tweaking for me to ever make this again.  The measurements are off.

Excellent! Everyone loved it. The second time I made it I used chocolate pudding, It was good but not as good as the vanilla.

I would give this one more than 5 stars if I could also!  This is wonderful!  I recently hosted a Party-Lite party, and made it ~ everyone LOVED it!  They were all joking that it was good enough to eat alone.  It did make quite a bit though, but I will do what someone else said, freeze half of it!  I'm hosting a baby shower this weekend, and plan to make it for that too!

This was great - with AND without the fruit!!!  I didn't have enough Cool Whip, so I added a bit of whipped cream, and that turned out well too!  Love it!

This dip was a big hit at my party; very delicious.  The only problem is that it makes WAY too much.  Half would have been fine.

This is very good as written, though it makes a huge amount.  I usually halve the recipe.   I also use fat free/sugar free white chocolate with white chocolate Godiva liquer too.  YUM!!

Family really enjoyed this dip...very creamy.  I had to make it kid friendly so I left out the amaretto but replaced it with milk.  I also halved the recipe and still had a lot of dip leftover.  Served with fresh strawberries and banana slices.

I took this dip to a pool party with fresh cut fruit and it was really enjoyed.  I modified this dip slightly and it was still excellent.  I used fat free white chocolate instant pudding, ultra low fat cool whip (or Cool Whip Free in the USA), skim milk and one teaspoon of almond extact instead of amaretto.  Everyone thought it was GREAT.  I will make it again in smaller portins to snack on at home or as a dessert.  I may not add the amaretto next time, it adds a little something but it was quite good without it too!

This has become my favorite fruit dip.  I have used all kinds of fruit with it, including apples, berries, bananas, pineapple, cherries, oranges, tangerines, and others, and all are wonderful.  Everyone loves it.  Thank you for the recipe, Carolyn!

Something new that everyone LOVED!  While I had second thoughts about letting the kids have it none of them had any ill effects from the liquor.  It helped that I only had 1/4 of amaretto, but it still tasted great.  Thanks!

Made a half recipe and love, Loved, LOVED it. I use it as a topping, instead of a dip.  

I cut up peaches, strawberries, mixed with raspberries and blueberries and served in a bowl with a generous serving of dip and a couple of little ameretti cookies...everyone raved about it!

I made this dip for an upscale Black & White party at a friend's house.  I used 1 box of vanilla pudding an 1 box of Pistachio pudding instead of the 2 boxes of Vanilla.  I served in a huge Margarhita glass with a tray of fruit kabobs, poundcakes cubes and biscotti. 
It was the party rave and all gobbled up.  Every part that some of the mutual people are also attending all tell me I have to bring this again.  With the addition of the pistachio dip, it was great at our ST. Paddy's party.

The amaretto flavor is pretty strong, but delicious. I would recommend using Jello brand pudding mix. A generic brand was used for mine and I personally didn't think it tasted as good as it could have. Everyone else still raved about it though.

Awesome!!!  Everyone loves this wherever I take it.  I did substitute 3/4 t. almond extract for the liquor.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good. Next time I may add more milk or use an electric beater to make it creamier. I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 tsp. of almond extract instead of the amaretto.

Had to improvise since I didn't have 2 boxes of vanilla pudding on hand.  I substituted one box of white chocolate and one box of cheesecake flavored instant puddings.  Also substituted almond extract for the amaretto as children would be enjoying it as well.  It was a hit!!

If there were more than 5 stars, I'd go higher.  This was SO easy & quick.  The only thing to worry about is if you have guests who should be aware of the alcohol content.  Everyone at my Pampered Chef party LOVED this!

very light and fluffy...great with strawberries and pineapple. Not so good with watermelon or any melon. I would hold off on alittle of the amarreto. It's a smidget strong! You can 1/2 this recipe if your making just enough for a fruit platter. But I made it all and froze half to use later. It froze fine! I also used 1 pckg. vanilla pudding, 1pckg. french vanilla pudding. The french vanilla gave it a rich flavor.

Did not have liqueur and but it did not matter.  I just added a few teaspoons of vanilla extract.  Served with pineapple, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberries, kiwi and mango!  The fresh mango was the best with the dip!

This was a great recipe! I used orange juice instead of the amaretto. Just add it after you have incorporated the milk into the pudding. It was delicious with strawberries, bananas, and pears.

This stuff is addictive.  I serve this at almost every office function with pinapple, strawberries, and other assorted fruits and it is always a big hit.  It's very quick, easy, and inexpensive to make as well.  Usually, my co-workers end up slathering it on everything - cookies, cakes, etc.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Five stars for its taste, ease of preparation and use of on-hand ingredients. I make this with lowfat or sugar free cool whip and sugar free pudding, and it gets raves every time. I like to serve it with just strawberries -- the biggest, most beautiful ones you can find, mound them on a platter, with the dip in the center. Looks beautiful. Each time I've brought it somewhere, I've had to give out the recipe, too.

This dip is sooooo good! I love it with kiwis also. I've made a more low-cal version with sugar-free pudding and fat free cool whip also. You can't really tell the difference, plus I allow myself to eat more of it! :)

This is really good if you use 1 box of instant vanilla pudding and 1 box of instant pistacho pudding, cut the amaretto in half, and serve with cinnamon graham crackers.

I served this at a party recently and it received rave reviews.  I used 1 tsp almond extract in place of the amaretto as there were children in the group.  Be sure to transfer the fluff to the serving bowl before chilling for a prettier presentation as it mounds better right after mixing.

This is excellent! I substituted amaretto syrup for the liqueur without any problems. It does make quite a bit, but I had no trouble getting rid of the leftovers!

This was excellent!  Took it to a party with 35 women, every one of them asked for the recipe and is making it for the holiday.  Makes ALOT!  I will cut it in half for the family.  Worked with all the fruit from pears to kiwi & mango.  And it is SO easy.

Great recipe!  Holiday parites are very stressful because I never know what to take.  Took 10 minutes to make!  Was the first thing gone at the party.  Came home with an empty plate and have given out many copies of the recipe! Used with apples, strawberries and pineapple.  Delicious -Thanks!!!

This was a big hit at soup and salad night. Since it was a small group, I did half the recipe using a cup of milk, but no amaretto. That gave me the right consistency. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipes.

I added 3 oz of cream cheese (softened) to firm it up, only used a 1 oz package of sugar free pudding, 3 oz of milk, skipped the liqueur and added cinnamon and nutmeg and mixed with a 16 oz container of whipped topping

Awesome change of pace for pitch-ins and cookouts. I used sugar-free pudding mix and only made 1/2 the recipe as it made a TON!

I have made this several times now, and it is always a big hit at my house and at parties.  I do use only about 1/4 cup of alcohol instead of the 1/2 cup called for.  This does make a lot, but as another reviewer noted, just put half back in the cool whip container and freeze it for later.

delish! i do have to point out that it is rather thick - i made it without the amaretto & compensated with an extra half-cup of milk, but it still was too heavy to dip cake in without it crumbling, even with extra milk...still good though, especially on strawberries!

Great recipe!  I added a tbsp of almond extract in place of the Amaretto and it was delicious.  I served it with fruit and a sur cream pound cake and it was a huge hit!

Excellent! I tried it with and without Kahlua. MUCH better with the Kahlua! I echo what others have said. I cut this recipe in half, and it is still a LOT.

I have several favorite recipes from Allrecipes, but this is the first one for which I've felt compelled to leave a review.  Not only is this delicious, it is easy & foolproof.  I say foolproof because I was worried that 1/2 cup of amaretto might be too much (I needn't have been), so I started out just using 1/4 cup.  After I added the whipped topping, I realized that 1/2 cup of amaretto would not be too much, so at that time I added the other 1/4 cup.  Also, I had forgotten to take the whipped topping out to thaw & didn't have time to wait, so I just stirred it up & added it a little at a time & it was fine.  Then...after I thought I was all done, I realized I had only used one box of pudding!  I added the second box a little at a time & it was still fine!  I served it with strawberries, fresh pineapple, bananas & grapes & everyone loved it.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this at my most recent party, served it with bananas, grapes, and raspberries, and everyone couldn't stop raving about it! I followed an early reviewer's suggestion and used 3/4 tsp. of almond extract instead of the amaretto.  Thanks for a great recipe I will be using again!!

This is the best. I really loved how nice it came out. I used the almond extract, I also used almond milk instead of regular milk. I used almond milk because it was all I had on had. I took this with 6 pounds of strawberries to a meeting for 48 people. This was gone in 45 min. Thank you for the recipe

This is absolutely WONDERFUL!  Everyone at the party loved it.  Glad I made alot .. it was the first thing to go!  It does make a good amount.  If you don't want much cut the recipe in half.  I doubled the recipe and it was enough for 30+ people.

This recipe is AMAZINGLY delicious!  Everyone I have fed it to raves about it.  I am so addicted that sometimes I'm tempted to eat it straight out of the tub with a spoon!  So far I have tried it with apples and bananas.  It is especially good on waffles with some sliced fruit on top.  This is quite possibly the best recipe I have ever tasted from Allrecipes.com.  I only give it 5 stars because I can't give it more!

Excellent recipe! I wouldn't change a thing. This makes a huge amount though, so I halve or even quarter this recipe unless I am making it for a big crowd. I like it with fruit salsa and cinnamon tortilla chips (Annie's Fruit Salsa recipe found on this site also). Yum!

It has a good flavor. You can certainly taste the amaretto. This recipe makes a lot. If you are planning on eating it by yourself you might consider cutting the recipe in half.

I used chocolate pudding instead and left out the liquer.  With the smaller amount of liquid overall, mine turned out to taste like chocolate mousse (it was a bit thick).  People left the apples and bananas and were just eating the dip!

So easy and great tasting.  I wasn't sure I could use the sugar free/fat free kind of instant pudding since it is only a 1 oz pkg and the recipe says to use a 3 oz pkg which is the full sugar/fat version.  Used the 1 oz pkg afterall with light cool whip and a little almond extract (didn;t have any amaretto).  Turned out really good- sat in the fridge fine for a couple days.  Will make again.  Would probably be best with the full fat version of pudding but for just us the 'lighter' version worked great.  We liked it best with strawberries but bananas and apples were a close second.

This was a great dip for my fruit tray, and soooo simple to make :) I chose to forego the liquer, but instead flavored half of the recipe with some unsweetened cocoa powder. We had vanilla & chocolate to choose from. It was very yummy, thanks for sharing this recipe!

Not impressed. Made it for a BBQ, it was hardly touched and no one commented on it which i take as a polite way of saying it wasnt so good. Followed recipe exactly. It was very sweet and while the amaretto sounded like a great idea i couldnt even taste it over the sweetness of the whipped topping. Will not make again.

I made this for two separate company events and I had plenty leftover.  It was so great!  I made it with orange juice instead of the amaretto and it was very flavorful and good!  I will definitely make again!

Delicious!  I took the advice of many of the other reviewers and halved the recipe.  It still made enough for me to serve to a small dinner party of 10 with tons left over!!!

Maybe it was my mistake of using French Vanilla pudding.  Next time, I'll stick with regular.  My friends loved it with Frangelica.  I'm not an amaretto fan so I don't have it on hand.

This is so so so good!  Just warning, this recipe does make a lot.  If its a small gathering, you may want to bring half and save half for yourself.

AMAZING !!!  Looks like butter tastes like heaven. Let it sit over night and if its too thick for your liking just add some milk or in my case amaretto. This will be a party staple from now on.  ~N~

I've just attempted to make this for a dinner party and right now, I'm looking at something that looks like it will do a fantastic job keeping wallpaper secured for life to a wall.  Not to mention it's super super sweet.  I attempted to half the recipe, as I cannot find 3 oz boxes of instant pudding anywhere in my stores (it's 1.34 oz or 4.67 oz), so I used a few of the 1.34 oz ones, but ended up having to use over a cup and a half of milk just to make it less thick and still a full 16 oz of whipped topping.  This doesn't seem like a complicated recipe, and believe me, I've turned out full meals that were fantastic, so anyone know what I might have done wrong?  PS:  Used almond extract instead of the amaretto - didn't have that on hand.

It was GREAT!!! I made half the recipe qty, but instead of amaretto I used Flangelico. I have also used in the past 1/2 tsp of almond extract instead of liquor. Simply wonderful!!!

Made this dip exactly as called for.  It was a hit, light in flavor and went well with any fruit.  

I chilled in the fridge for a few hours and the texture was perfect.

I think I made some errors that caused me to only rate it a three. I used sugar free pudding and used the electric mixer to blend it together. It was a thick, gummy,gooey mess. Our family said it was good but I didn't think so, I just couldn't get over the texture. I added some raspberry swirl chocolate chips and served with strawberries, angel food cake, and whipped cream. pretty good.

Based on all the outstanding reviews, I expected great things from this simple recipe, but I was sorely disappointed.  Per the suggestion of other reviewers, I cut the recipe in half and, boy, was I glad I did.  This was way too sweet and didn't go over very well.  My guests gobbled up the fruit, but left the dip!  Wasn't necessarily bad, but wasn't memorable either.  I'll try a different recipe next time.  Sorry!

Update:  I served the leftover dip the next night at my husband's poker party and it still wasn't eaten.  Keep in mind these guys will usually eat ANYTHING!

Thanks for the best fruit dip I have ever had, Carolyn.  I made the full recipe and froze half of it in the Cool Whip container.  Took the container to the granddaughter's "U" graduation and snacked through the long ceremony with the family.  Great!

This was the HIT of the Party!  It even upstaged the guest of honor!  Be careful when you serve it; your guests wont want to eat anything else!  Everyone seemed to like it best with bananas or strawberries.  (yes, we caught some eating it straight from the bowl!)  You have to try it-- super easy.

Wow! This is almost good enough to eat with a spoon straight from the serving bowl (just don't get caught). I made eight servings for five guests and it wasn't nearly enough. Next time I'll make three times as much as I think I will need.

Tried this for Easter dinner at in-laws. Modified recipe using cream cheese flavor pudding instead of vanilla. I thought it was pretty good, but it didn't fly off the table. 
Might try again using almond extract- I thought the aftertaste of the Amaretto was a bit much. I do like MUCH better than marshmallow based dips and agree with previous posts that this would make a great frosting for cake or cupcakes. I'm going to experiment with this one.

I think it could have used a bit more amaretto.  My guests loved it though.  I placed mine in a small bowl on a platter surrounded by fresh fruit.  It looked like a huge bowl of, well, fluff. If I were to make it again, I'd serve it in a smaller, more shallow bowl & simply re-fill as needed.

I can't even tell you how many people asked for this recipe! It was fabulous! I halved it and still added the 1/2 c amaretto. It wasn't runny at all and was very flavorful. LOVED IT and will make again.

I took this to a Bunco group and it was an INSTANT hit!  I substituted almond flavoring for the Amaretto and it was fabulous.  A recommendation for a low calorie/low fat version is to use sugar-free pudding, fat-free milk, and fat-free cool whip.  YUM!

Excellent.  Love this.  Used Bailey's Irish Cream instead and prefer it.  Also used large package of vanilla pudding mix instead of 2 - 3 oz. pkgs.

For a fruit dip (I am not usually a fan) this is fantastic! My hubby kept asking for more more more! And our guests all enjoyed as well.

I served this dip w/strawberries at a grad pty and it was truly a hit!  Friends of all ages really loved it!  Many asked for the recipe! That alone is a compliment! It will forever remain in our personal recipe box!  The consistency of the mix kept well over several hours and was a breeze to whip up quickly before hand.  My kind of recipe!

I cut the recipe in half using two 1-1/2 oz. packages of instant pudding, 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup Amaretto and 8 oz. Cool Whip.  I ended up with a very stiff, grainy and rather bland underwhelming result. I was suspect of the original recipe of two 3 oz. packages of pudding along with the liquid to dry ratio being off and I was right. I think what the author meant was two 1-1/2 oz. packages of instant pudding (?). ?Anyway, it ended up in the trash.

I use it as filling in fruit creeps. I was awesome.

This is so good .  Please don't substitute the Amaretto, this is the secret ingredient that makes it sooo good . Let's face it .. the fruit is just a vehicle to get this in your mouth .

Awesome recipe.  I did not use the Amaretto simply because I forgot to ask my mom for some.  I would eat fruit all the time if I had this yummy stuff to go with it.

Been making this for years and everyone LOVES IT!!! Even switched the liquid ingredients to 1 cup amaretto and 1/2 cup milk for little extra, :-),  and froze half for later. Every time people ask me for the recipe. Regarding the error on measurements...never had any issues. The key is you have to mix the pudding mix with the liquids FIRST until fully blended, then FOLD IN THE WHIP, put back in the container and freezer until you need it.

We really liked this dip.  Served with sliced bananas, kiwi, grapes, and fresh pineapple (found out that sliced strawberries tend to leave red streaks in the dip!).  Did not use the liquer, but made up for it by adding 1/2 cup more milk than what the receipe states so there was enough liquid for correct consistency.  Will be making this again!

It was quite qood, but it doesn't  need the amaretto. We found it overpowering.  Very nice & "light" on fresh summer fruit.

I never made anything like this before. My daughter signed me up to bring fruit to her classroom for a potluck but being a "baker" I couldn't bring just fruit. I found this recipe a decided to give it a try. I used vanilla and almond in place of amaretto and everyone loved it. Word of caution: this makes a massive amount of dip. Unless your taking this to a huge party you will likely only need to make half.

Yummy and very rich.  This recipe makes a TON of dip, so make it for a party or be prepared for lots of left overs.  I ended up adding a bit more amaretto to give it more flavor.

Made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it!  It goes especially well with strawberries.  It was a shower for 12 people, and I should have cut the recipe in half--it makes a lot of dip!

Absolutely hands down the best dip ever.  I have made this for every party and by far rated #1 with the Guest.  I have also made this for several kids birthday parties, I only use half of the Ammareto with no problems........

Very, very yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and took it to a Summer Den Leader/Committee Meeting for Cub Scouts.  When all the fruit was gone (and it went quickly) people were eating it with their fingers.  I served the fluff with strawberries, pineapple and bananas.  Excellent - this one will be written in the recipe book and used for years to come.  Thank you for sharing!

Excellent, though if you don't like alchol, cut back or substitute as the taste was strong.

I thought this was okay.  I made it for work.  I originally added the liquor, but it didn't add enough flavor.  I had to put a couple dashes of almond extract.  I used fat free cool whip and fat free pudding.  Was great!

Very good.  I accidentally only used 1/2 the whipped topping (the Cool Whip package I usually buy is only 8 oz, and the recipe calls for 16 oz package, but I didn't notice until I was already mixing it up), and it still turned out yummy.  I liked how it tasted & didn't think it tasted too much like alcohol.  Very yummy with strawberries, and it makes a ton.  I forgot 8 oz of whipped topping & I'm pretty sure it make more than 4 cups anyway.

Tasty! And very simple to prepare. Used a bit more amaretto. Pretty color. The kids liked it as well. I wonder if this is what the new French Vanilla Cool Whip tastes like. I think this would be great as a topping for pies, etc.

Fabulous fruit dip!  It is refreshing, easy to make and delicious.  Might want to decrease the amount of amaretto - just a bit too strong.  This will definitely become a favorite and a must for parties!

Excellent fruit dip recipe!  The liqueur adds a definite twist.  I have had so many people ask for this recipe.  I have made with both Amaretto and Kahlua and both tasted wonderful.  It makes a ton though - so be prepared!

This was pretty good. I only had 1/4 cup amaretto and couldn't taste it at all. Make sure you have enough of that to be able to taste it. Mine was good but didn't really have enough flavor.

All I can say is to double the recipe and keep half for yourself, because you're NOT going to want to share this!  AWESOME!!!

This dip recipe was out of this world delicious for fruit!! I served it at my daughters grsduation party and everyone made a special comment to me on just how delicious it was. Only thing is, I STILL had leftovers after serving a party of 25. And everyone got plenty of it. But its inexpensive (if you have the Amaretto on hand) to make so no big deal! Will totally make again!

This is the best!  Wonderful!  Everyone at my party loved it and wanted the recipe.  I made it with Kahlua.  Can't wait to try it with Amaretto.  I also made it once with Irish Cream and did not like it as well.

This was so good and so easy to make. I've never tasted a fruit dip quite like this. The amaretto is such a nice flavor with strawberries. I will definitely be adding this to the list of things I make on a regular basis. Thanks!

The best fruit dip I have ever had! I like to use this with Annie's Fruit Salsa recipe from this site. This makes a LOT, you may want to scale it down.

This is great-the little bit of Amaretto really makes a difference!  Serve with grapes and strawberries.
