I DOUBLED this recipe. To cut the assembly time in half, I used eight individual string cheese. What I did was cut each of the string cheese in half, put a half in the middle of the crescent roll on top of the pepperoni slices and roll it up into the crescent. I didn't need to worry about shredding cheese and there was more cheese in the middle of the crescent which we all liked. I served these with a homemade pizza sauce. Huge hit.

I'm the manager of a sports team and brought this in. Out of everything I brought, everyone loved this the most! It's like a delish pizza roll up! Major props

I made this for a Halloween party and everyone loved them! So easy, quick & yummy. Next time I might mix Parmesan cheese and garlic powder together & sprinkle on top.

5 stars for ease and taste!  If you want some extra flavor without the pizza sauce, sprinkle some parmesan cheese over the top before baking.  : )

Very Yummy. I also added pizza sauce (just a little) to the Crescents before I baked them.  I used Garlic Crescents too.

perfect and fun to make with the kids. I used Ragu 3 cheese sauce instead for flavor and reduced fat crescent rolls...it was yummy! Will make again.

I served these to the kids for lunch and they liked them.  I gave them a small dish with pizza sauce to dip them in.  My only complaint is the crescents are a little sweet for my liking.

This was great for a really quick weeknight meal. It's very easy, and just takes a few minutes to get everything ready for the oven. Both of my kids loved it, and my four year old said he wants these again soon. Thanks for the recipe!

Kids loved them.  We also used string cheese (cut in half) instead of shredded. Next time I will add more garlic powder and parmesan cheese for added flavor.

I doubled this recipe and took a another reviewer's suggestion and used string cheese to make it easier to assemble. We ate these for a football game night and my husband and son loved them!

Made these today for the kids along with pizza for lunch. I just happened to have all the ingredients. I tried one and didn't care for it...I thought it was kind of bland. The kids went crazy over these though. They are already asking me to make them again. I followed recipe EXACTLY, but maybe some melted garlic butter, Parmesan cheese, or sesame seeds sprinkled on top would make it more appealing to me, personally:)

I used cubes of mozzarella cheese instead of shredded because I had a block of cheese to use.  I think some garlic salt or powder inside the crescent would bump up the flavor.  These are a quick and easy lunch time or snack treat.  Thanks.

My boys, ages 5 & 7, made these themselves for lunch today. (I put them in and took them out of the oven of course!)
Instead of using shredded mozzarella cheese, we used 4 pieces of string cheese, cut in half. They ate 3 of these each and really enjoyed dipping them. Will definitely be making again.

These are an easy snack or meal that everyone will like. We dip ours in pizza sauce. The youth at our church love these, what kid wouldn't? :)
