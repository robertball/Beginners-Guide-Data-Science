I can't imagine why this recipe doesn't have more positive ratings!!! Firstly my local grocery store didn't have garam masala so I made my own : 2 cinnamon sticks 3 dried bay leaves 3 tbsp cumin seeds 2 tbsp coriander seeds 4 cardamom pods, crushed 1 tbsp cloves 1 tsp black peppercorns 1 tbsp ground mace Dry roast the ingredients, let cool and grind to a fine powder(you can use spice mill or coffee grinder). Store in the pantry for up to 1 month and in the refrigerator for up to 3 months. I also didn't have any creme fraiche so I used heavy whipping cream and one word for this : YUMMY!!!My boyfriend and I could not get enough of this!!  Please try this you will not regret it!!!!

This is a good recipe--and with a few changes it is amazing.  I like a little more sauce with a little more flavor, so I doubled everything except the meat and garam masala.  Keep the meat quantity as it is and quadruple the garam masala (2 tsp. total).  With those tweaks, this recipe was very much like the curries I used to eat in England!

OMG!  This is so good, but only after adding additional seasoning.  I prepared it as directed in the recipe using cubed chicken thighs and tasted it half way through.  There wasn't a whole lot of flavor, at least not as robust as what we get at our local Indian restaurant.  So, I added an additional 1/2 t. garam masala, 1/2 t. chili powder and 1 T. tomato paste.  Made all the difference!  Also, I couldn't find creme fraiche so I substituted 1/4 c. cream and 1/4 c. sour cream.  If you like Indian food, you'll love this.

This recipe is amazing! I've made it twice so far - first time with pork, second time with chicken - and loved it! Next time I make it with pork, I'll reduce the cooking time, since the pork turned out a little dry - but the sauce made up for it, no worries. The chicken turned out perfect - I can't wait to make it with lamb! I also doubled the amount of tomato paste. Instead of water and creme fresh I only used one glass of 1% fat milk. The taste is just as great! I also used more of the spices for taste and added about one teaspoon coriander powder. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, it's a keeper!

This was good, but not outanding.  I would recommend doubling the spices for sure.  I did not have creme fraiche, so I used 1/4c. sour cream and 1/4 C half & half instead.  After browing the lamb, I drained off all but 2T of the fat, but then as it cooked, there wasn't enough liquid.  I added more cream to compensate.  After tasting about 1/2 way through, I added salt, another Tbsp of tomato paste.  It definitely improved after adding the honey, cream & cilantro to finish.  Don't leave any of those out.  The end product was tasty, but I'll tweak it with add'l spice next time and maybe use chicken or shrimp.

Very good! I made my own American-girl creme fraiche with sour cream and heavy cream. I added quite a bit more spice to this - as written it's good, but a little bland. Thanks for the recipe!

It's a keeper! Double the spices as others suggested. Can also use more tomatoe paste. Instead of creme fraiche used some milk and greek yogurt. came out awesome.

We liked this a lot.  It's a great dish because it has good flavor in minimal time, and would work with any meat.  I will definitely make this again. It tasted great in the pot, but seemed a little bland when served over rice, so for our tastes we will triple the spices (I already doubled them).  I made this on a whim and had to sub plain yogurt for the creme fraiche and skip the cilantro, so I can't wait to try it as the author intended.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great. Have made with lamb and chicken... actually prefered the chicken. Also baked a light fish in the 'gravy' and was fantastic (tried talapia).

This was a hit tonight!  I did stray from the original recipe though.  Here are my changes:  I used chicken instead of lamb; canola oil instead of butter; 3/4 to 1 tsp. turmeric, ground ginger (since i didn't have fresh ginger to grate), and minced garlic; NSA tomato sauce instead of tomato paste; 1% milk instead of the creme fraiche; and completely forgot about the honey!  After all those changes the recipe still turned out fantastic!  When I have all the ingredients I would love to try this recipe again (especially with lamb!) as I am sure it is even more delicious!  As it turned out, though, I will definitely make it again with my changes!

This was delicious!  My husband was practically licking the pan it was made in after his 3 servings!!!  I used beef instead of lamb and I dont like my food very spicy--so I kept the original amounts of seasonings but you could always add more to your liking.  I could not find creme fraiche, so I just substiuted heavy whipping cream---it worked well and the honey is a must!  YUMMY YUM!!

This is a decent recipe, but it isn't as flavorful as I expected. Next, time I will use chicken broth instead of water and maybe add more salt.

Very good. Flavors were nice, mild, and a good use of lamb when its on sale. It was a bit more trouble than I'd prefer to cube the lamb from the bone in shoulder peice so I'll be looking for a boneless option next time.

I normally make first-time recipes exactly per the instructions, but after reading several reviews I decided to play with the spice amounts a bit. I ended up using 4x the garam masala just to coat the lamb and doubled all the other spices that went into the dish as well as doubling the liquids for added gravy. I thought it turned out pretty decent, but still just a bit bland. I served it over basmati rice and had a side of garlic naan from my local ethnic grocer. I would probably make it again if lamb weren't so expensive ($10/lb) and I hadn't already found a similar chicken recipe. Overall, it was still pretty good and easy to make. Definitely worth a try, just make sure you add some spices.

I thought this was just ok ... doubled the sauce,  quadrupled the garam masala, and used chicken stock instead of water.  Still thought it was bland though and could use a little more kick.  It gets points for ease and quickness though ... I'll probably make again, but play with it.  Golden raisins could be a good addition.

Simply delicious.  I made this two Sundays ago and my family, especially my husband, just loved it.  When my husband left work today he bought some lamb so that I prepare the same dish on Easter Friday.  It's the first time he has ever asked that I prepare a dish again.  He is a very good cook himself so the lamb must have been special.  I don't like ginger while he does not like honey, so I skipped those. Thanks for the recipe.

Never cooked this kind of food before. Followed the recipe exactly. This turned out great! I was worried about it being too thin of a sauce so I cooked it a little longer on medium after adding cream. The sauce thickened nice after cooling a bit. It has a fair amount of heat but well balanced. I trimmed the lamb of all the fat I could and it was still tender. Just make sure to remove with just a brown and dont try and cook it done at the beginning. Served with basmati rice. Simple enough to throw together on a workday. Highly recommend!!

7/15/16 Update - made this using 2 lbs of cremini and baby bella mushrooms in place of the lamb.  This butter gravy sauce is so good.  I am not a huge vegetarian dish lover so would ultimately still prefer the lamb over mushrooms but my wife loved the veggie dinner. I can't wait to try this on other meats!

This recipe is amazing!!  I left out the cayenne pepper so my family would eat it, and they loved it!!  
I took the lamb and put it in a covered bowl with a thickly chopped onion, and some sea salt.  Then I put it in the fridge for three days stirring twice a day.  Lamb was so tender!
Like I said, recipe is so good that I'll never eat butter anything in a restaurant ever again!
Thanks!! :)

SO glad to have found this recipe. My family fell in love with this recipe outside our house, now I can make it home for them!  :-) If you don't have creme fraiche...yoghurt or sour cream will work perfectly fine as well.

Most pleasant.  Quick and easy to prepare.  I had stewing lamb meat and was looking for something different.  I saw this one, and just let it simmer longer for the meat to become tender.  I used chillies instead of powder.  I was extremely wary of the amount of honey.  For my taste, I found 1/2 tbsp. quite enough.  But that is like salt and pepper - a personal taste.

I am one who likes herbs and spices and my husband is more of a plain eating kinda guy; however after I made this meal, HE was the one who came up to me and said it was bland and can I add more spices to it. I did so to the remaining gravy, but I couldn't make it better. While this dish has a good idea, it is VERY bland. Overall, I was disappointed. I am sure it could be improved with a lot more spice to it.(I even doubled all the spices and that didn't work)

I made this with leftover roast lamb.  I added  some potato and peas because that's how I like my curries.  Served it over steamed rice.  Very tasty.

The flavor is good though I did have to add some salt to my portion.  When I make this again, I shall do it in the slow cooker though as the meat stayed pretty chewy after only 20 minutes of simmering.

Loved the recipe. Had to make it the second time. The first time I cooked it I followed the recipe and it didn’t come out nice. I was using leg of lamb cubes and they were hard and chewy. I doubled up all the spices and even water this time around. Cooked the leg of lamb on low heat for 3hrs. Absolute perfection

I will make it again!! I found cheap lamb curry pieces at the markets, my family aren't so keen on lamb, but this time it all disappeared before I could remind any of the kids to eat their dinner! Threw everything in the slow cooker, let it stew all day, added the cream 30 min before dinner time, mmm mmm, delish!!

This was so good. I didn't have all the ingredients at hand but I used it as a base and made it anyway. It was amazing. Hopefully, next time I'll make it as written. If you're wondering, here is what I did using ingredients I have at hand:  I used beef, 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of coconut milk. I used 1/2 tsp of ground ginger since I didn't have fresh. I increased the masala to 1tsp. Served it with rice and peas and carrots.

My family and I enjoyed this dish!  I did work a little off book though.  I doubled the masala seasoning, seared the lamb in infused garlic olive oil instead of butter, added red/orange/yellow bell peppers along with the onions, used tomato sauce instead of paste (but only because I didn't have any at home), used half & half instead of heavy cream (but only because I didn't have any at home).  Then once the lamb was done simmering, I took out the lamb, added some more masala seasoning and boiled the bones in the broth to thicken it.  Once it thickened, I added the lamb cubes back in and sprinkled cilantro and green/red onions over the dish.  I have already passed this recipe along 3 times since I cooked it last night.

Very easy and so good. I made a garam masala substitute (Just a blend of spices) and otherwise followed the recipe. It was great and the leftovers tasted even better next day. Next time, I think I will add a little cornstarch, to thicken the gravy a little before adding the cream.

This dish as per the recipe is very bland. So on my second attempt I made a few changes: 1. I added 1 tbs of ginger and garlic which I pounded together in a mortar; 3 green cardamoms; 3 tbs  tomato paste; 1 green chilli sliced; double the Garam masala (which I made myself, minus the nutmeg); the suggested amount of turmeric; 1/4 cup whipping cream; and no honey; salt to taste  2.  After I browned the meat, I removed it from the pot, then  sautéed the ginger garlic and green cardamom together until the garlic was light brown in 1tbs butter and 1 tbs oil. 3. I added the meat back to the pot and cooked as per the recipe. 4. I also added 1tbs butter when I added the cream. The flavours were a lot more robust and my family loved it.

Made it pretty much as written and found it tasty but a bit on the mild side. It takes considerably longer than 20 min. To tenderize lamb shoulder

I increased by 2x's most of the spices (3 tbsp of GM), increased the butter to 3 tbsp, used 3/4 cups of water. 

Used left over lamb shoulder from a roast. (it was a big roast).

With the changes I made it gets a 4. 

I enjoyed it, my 9 year old son loved it and had seconds. The others wished it wasn't lamb ;)

Out of garam masala--made my own from "Easy Garam Masala" on this site.  This is easy and relatively quick.  I was worried about the honey but it added just the right amount of "sweet" the lamb needed.

I wanted to try using tumeric and found this recipe.  I followed the recipe with these changes: pork instead of lamb, spinach instead of cilantro, 1/3 cup diced stewed tomatoes in juice instead of paste, sour cream, and about 1/4 cup of my homemade chicken broth.  I also bumped up the spices a little, but not much since I never used tumeric before.  I think I'd feel comfortable bumping it up a bit more next time.  Served it over my homemade pasta.  This is a nice way to introduce more aromatic spices to our mild-mannered cuisine.  Thanks for the ideas.

Love this recipe, easy to make and very tasteful...There is a sweet aftertaste after the " spicy" I guess it's because of the honey,, Next time I'll omit that ingredient and see how it turns out as I am more into spicy then sweet... Besides this, I will also double the sauce to get more as it doesnt make that much. Served on rice it's delicious!!

I loved this recipe so much I counted stop eating it! I did a few variations because I didn't have heavy cream and I used sour cream. Also I cooked it in a cast iron skillet and placed it in the oven on a slow bake of 275 for about an hour. Delish!!!

I hate to rate recipes that I made changes on, but the changes were made out of necessity and I know the original recipe would be very good.  I used beef because 2lbs of lamb is expensive.  I didn't have garam masala, so I used curry because I figured it would work in this dish.  The sauce was awesome and you could add any veggie you'd want in it.  I did add a cornstarch mixture to give it a more gravy like texture.

I don't eat red meat but cooked this for my husband and brother in law. He enjoyed it and felt it was very flavorful. For me, I had to cook this for way longer than 20min. My dish was very watery and looked nothing like the picture. I ended up cooking for about an hour or so and added a bit of flour to thicken up the gravy. 

As per the other recommendations, I also went a bit heavy handed on the salt and other spices. there was lots of flavor in the dish. Will make again one day.

Added potatoes as well and went less on the spicy so my daughter can eat it but it was still tasty first time cooking lamb besides grilling this was good. And pretty easy to make!

The blend of flavors in this dish is quite good.  And, as others have said, it needs more.  I more than tripled the seasonings and found that to be more suited to our tastes.  The speed and ease with which the dish comes together make it a good choice for a quicker meal, particularly if you cut and season the meat and toss it into a baggie in the morning and can just dump it into the skillet in the evening.  For that reason, with the seasoning adjustments, its a good recipe to have in your files.

We doubled the spices specified (enough for 12 people!). We (the two of us) though it had just the right amount of spice and gravy. Yum!
