I make this during the holidays, too! What I do differently is I use a whole pound of bacon, use "light" cream cheese and I add a couple good shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. It's pretty much good with any cheese you want to use, you don't have to just stick with parmesan. If you want this a little easier to spread, you can also use whipped cream cheese and fold the other ingredients into the cream cheese. This is a good base for pinwheels, too. Just spread it on your tortillas and add your fillings, roll up, and cut into "wheels". HUGE hit with everyone because, come on, who DOSEN'T like bacon?

This recipe disappeared off my table at a recent fundraiser for our local Children's Hospital.  I had 4 other dips but this was the one gone in no time!  Only thing I did different was double the amount of bacon - everything is better with more bacon you know!

This was great. I did add more bacon - can never have enough! I seasoned with salt-free garlic herb.

I used this in a brain-shaped mold for a Halloween party. Everyone loved it. I used pre-cooked bacon pieces and added garlic powder to kick up the flavor. I also used grated Pecorino Romano instead of freshly shredded cheese just because I always have that on hand in my fridge.

Delicious blend of flavors. I added some garlic powder as others suggested, and also wrapped the ball in plastic wrap for easier molding after chilling.

It is a wonderful base recipe to put various things in it. I added more bacon as we know 1/2 lb. is never enough so I did a little more than one pound because I wanted more inside and outside. Added at least six drops of Sriracha Sauce or to taste for a little kick. Also when you put the cheese spread in the frig scoop it onto saran wrap it makes it easer to mold into a ball without a mess. I did add some garlic powder as well.
