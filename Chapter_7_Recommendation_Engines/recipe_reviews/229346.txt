This was very good!  I had a lot of fun making this dish and it went well with my other dishes!!  My family thoroughly enjoyed it too, which makes it that much better.  Plus, there is bacon!  haha

I tried this recipe idea, but tweaked it in a few ways: 1) I used diced onion rather than onion powder; 2) I omitted the salt and pepper; 3) I added a couple tbsps of tomato sauce; 4) I baked the large meatballs on a rack over my baking pan for 30 minutes, then turned them over and continued baking to evenly cook the bacon.  They were delicious and we will be having them again soon ;)

Amazing meatball recipe. I used diced onion instead of powder. I also used more bacon as each meatball required (in my opinion) an entire slice.
I often make giant meatballs, but didn't think to wrap them in bacon. Genius! I use a muffin tin to hold the meatballs in shape.

Tried this a couple of days ago.  Was a huge hit..!! Made a few changes, chopped walla walla onions instead of onion powder,  used 2 lbs of hamburger and 1lb of sausage also used the rings of walla walla onions to wrap the outside of the meatball then wrapped with bacon. Another item I added was milk, I believe 1 cup. I saw this in another recipe and decided to try it. It was a great addition along with some Worcester Sauce and bar b que sauce(Sweet Baby Rays) 1 cup. We have friends over every Wednesday and they have requested these meatballs again and they want to come over early to help make them.

This was fantastic.  We placed a stick in the meatballs and poured bbq sauce over them.  The meatballs were very flavorful.   The bacon was not very crispy even though I baked in a convection oven. I recommend increasing the temperature to 425 for the last 5 - 10 minutes to crisp up the bacon.

The meatballs were a big hit! These are practically a main course by themselves, though, very large and filling. Next time I might cut the size down a bit.

Delicious. So much better than the traditional meatballs in sauce. Made as recipe called for. Will be making these again.

Exceptionally flavorful. My Twist: I rolled panko on the outside of the meatball  b4 wrapping it in bacon. They were crispy on the outside and soft and delicious inside.  Also - I didn't have any bread so I used a package of generic "Stove Top"  as a substitute where it is called for in the original recipe. If you are worried about the bacon making them too greasy tasting - don't.  The baking method sucks the grease away from the meat and keeps it on the paper.  Far less greasy tasting than the pan fry type.  Plus the paper kept the pan clean. I mean super clean.

Good recipe.  I made smaller meatballs (I think I ended with 18) and used 1 pound ground turkey with 2 pounds ground beef  because that is what I had on hand.  I used 2 different types of bacon because I  bought the cheap, thin type and had part of a package of thick cut already open.  The thin cut crisped up quickly and was much more crunchy than the thick cut - which never crisped up much even with longer cooking.   I love this as a basic recipe that I can adapt and change according to what I have on hand.

These are very tasty.. the family really enjoyed them.. two things though.. it's basically a 1/4 lbs bacon wrapped gourmet burgers worth of meat in a ball.. which nobody in my house could eat more than one in a sitting.. and two, you're going to have a few extras being the recipe uses 3lbs of meat.. but again, tastey.. so if you're not feeding a few teenagers or just have a house full of meat lovers, you'll be having leftovers for a couple days..

I made these and they were delicious! A little time consuming creating the bacon wrapping, but oh so worth it!

These were easy to make but a little bland for me. Next time I probably will spice them up a bit or throw some barbecue sauce into the mix or glaze them with it before I cook them.

Great recipe! But I found it a bit easier to cook the bacon crisp and put bacon right into the seasoned ground beef

Yes - I made these meatballs for a birthday party - 18 of them and everyone loved them so much they are asking me to bring them into the office so they can purchase them for $3.00 each.  One of the fellows said "I could eat a dozen of those myself" . . . so this might be a good sign that they enjoyed them so much they are willing to pay $$'s for them.  A new business sideline . . . while working at the university.  I'm not sure that $3.00 will cover the cost plus labor.
