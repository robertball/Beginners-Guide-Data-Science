The recipe is excellent but can be streamlined considerably:

(1) Heat water for pasta.

(2) Prep your raw and canned ingredients. Substitute 6 oz. canned sliced mushrooms – drained and rinsed. Drain and rinse canned artichoke hearts and cut into pieces (or use hearts of palm, which have a milder, more lemony flavor.) Slice the bacon strips into 1-inch pieces. Keep everything in separate prep bowls and set aside.

(3) Cook sauce exactly as directed to keep it creamy. Once the last pat of butter is mixed in, immediately remove the pan from heat and keep warm (or place on a very low heat and stir occasionally.) Do not keep or reheat on medium or high heat as the cream sauce will separate and become greasy. 

(4) Slice the raw chicken breasts with the grain into ½ inch strips. Cook in one layer in a non-stick pan on medium heat with 1 Tbs. olive oil, until the edges are cooked; then flip the strips and cook for about 2 more minutes, until no longer pink and cooked through. Immediately remove from heat, place in a bowl and cover with foil to keep the strips warm and tender – do not leave them on the burner as overcooking will make the chicken tough and rubbery. 

(5) While the pasta cooks, cook bacon a bit over medium heat; add mushrooms and cook 3-5 minutes; add the artichokes or hearts of palm last, heating through about 2 minutes, to preserve their soft texture and keep them from becoming mushy.

(6) Return chicken strips to the skillet and continue as directed.

I have a love/hate relationship with this recipe. It has so many delicious ingredients and the final product, after significant recipe alteration, is yummy, but let me start by saying no way is this recipe ready after 30 minutes. No. Way. Impossible. Second, the recipe does not specify whether the bacon should be cooked when you put it in or raw. I opted for mostly cooked in my microwave before I dumped it in the pan-- thank goodness, or either it would have been raw or everything else would be toast. Third, if you make it as the recipe describes, it will be ridiculously greasy. I used about half of the butter and one less T of cream and drained and wiped out the pan not only after cooking the chicken, but after cooking the mushroom mixture as well, but it was STILL greasy! I can only imagine what it would have been like. After all that, it was good, much like the restaurant recipe I think it's trying to replicate (despite the story about the old lady)... It wasn't any harder to make than it sounded, but I could tell it was not a half-hour recipe. Well... I hope that this long recipe review was helpful. The end product was good, but the recipe needs major revisions for it to be tasty and/or match the cooking time.

This is a "to die for" recipe but with these ingredients that could be literal.  LOL.  I followed the recipe verbatim and it was one of the BEST things I have ever tasted. And my dinner guests agreed. I salivate just thinking of it.  It is well worth the effort and I did everything in the early afternoon except boiling the farfalle. So when my guests arrived I just added the chicken to the mushrooms, etc. and tossed it until it warmed up.  Reheated the lemon butter sauce.  and boiled the noodles.  Served it with a light, leafy salad with italian dressing and a hot loaf of french bread.  It doesn't get better than this in any ***** restaurant. Thank you for sharing it with us.  And may the wonderful italian woman rest in peace knowing she left a delicious legacy.

Let me first say this...Lemon Butter Chicken...The name say's it all.If you don't like lemon and butter pass on this recipe.I think the sauce is key here having said that make it last. I followed the recipe exactly and by the time the pasta and chicken was done the sauce had seperated and you are left with alot of butter un-incorperated with the cream.It's much easier to keep the chicken warm then the sauce.The longer the sauce sits the more it breaks down.You can add alot of things to the final dish ie. tomatoes,parmesan cheese or what ever you like.

This dish was heavenly!  I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the heavy cream and light margarine instead of the butter, and it was delicious! I'm sure the sauce would have been thicker had I used the original ingredients, but it was definitely worth cutting some fat. We will definitely be making this again.

This was outstanding! I am still getting requests for the recipe. I cooked this for a group of 20 people. I cooked the chicken the night before and purchased chicken tenders to make it easier for prep. I sliced the chicken and bagged it. I cooked the bacon after that and bagged it with paper towels to keep it crisp and reserved some bacon grease for the following day. The next day, I cooked the sauce in one pot and cooked the remaining ingredients together and added some bacon grease to the mixture for a little more flavor. I combined the ingredients with the chicken until the chicken was heated through. Before I put the chicken in a chafing dish, I added the sauce to the mixture and tossed. It was absolutely delicious! 
I think if I made it again, I would try using procuitto. But this is fabulous! A+ And GREAT for a buffet!

This recipe turned out delicious! My husband said it was better than a restaurant dish. I changed the proportions for the sauce. I mixed 1/4 cup of wine and half 1/4 cup of lemon juice and let reduce. Then I melted a half stick of butter in the sauce and stirred until it melt completely. Then I added 1 cup of heavy cream and a bunch of fresh parsley. I read on another site a trick to keep the sauce from separating is to keep it on low heat and whisk for a long time after adding cream (6-8 min).It came out perfect. Also the dish tastes great with some sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top.

This recipe got a "please make this one again" from my family. I omitted the mushrooms, used flour instead of heavy cream, doubled the artichokes, and only used half the butter. It was delicious and I would definitely make it again!

This is a wonderful recipe that everyone in my family loved. I doubled the recipe but tripled the liquids in the sauce. I used several lemons because we all love the flavor and subbed with fat free half and half which worked out very well. Rigatoni with the ridges held the sauce nicely. Thank you so much for a great Sunday evening dinner!

Too greasy. It was good, but it really isn't something that I think we will make again following the recipe the way that it is written. Follow other reviewers' advice and reduce the amount of fat in the pan, and make your sauce last so that it doesn't separate. It could be great, but as written it is just ok. Thanks for the post.

The ingredients are great but the time estimate is WAY off and I find that I need to prepare it a bit differently. First of all I fry up the bacon in a pan, while doing that I dredge the chicken in the flour and prep my other ingredients including getting a pot of water on the stove for the pasta. I brown the chicken in the bacon grease with a little bit of butter (as needed). Once the chicken is browned I place it on a cookie sheet and stick it in the oven at 300 to cook through and stay warm while I make the sauce. I start by adding more butter to pick up the browned chicken bits and cook the mushrooms down. I like them seriously cooked down. Once they are totally cooked down I add the white wine and cook down again. Once everything is totally cooked down I brown the artichoke hearts in the pan until they get a little crispy around the edges, then I add a clove of garlic and then as soon as it starts to brown i add the lemon juice and more wine. I also add a bit of chicken broth to make it saucier. I then add the capers, butter (no need for nearly that much butter), cream and some thyme and whisk it in well. I take the chicken out of the oven and finish it in the pan. Then I serve with pasta. I prefer linguine with this and I toss it with a bit of butter and spoon the sauce over it. Top with freshly grated parmesan cheese. Yum!

I made this recipe based on the fact it has all my favorite ingredients.  It has chicken, mushrooms, wine, lemon etc.  First I have to say it takes WAY longer than 30 min to make this.  Second it is a very heavy dish.  I don't know if I was full from the pasta or the heaviness of the butter, bacon and pasta combined.  Either way, you hit a brick wall after eating this and actually get sick at a certain point.  My kids hated it btw.  I am an expert chef and should you still want to make this I would highly recommend the following steps to make it successful:
1.  Make your chicken first, either by grilling it or just cooking it the night before, whatever works.  2,  Put your bacon in the pan BEFORE the mushrooms.  Logic will tell you mushrooms cook faster than bacon.  
3.  Add your chicken back to the pan and let it just sit with the cover on it while you make the sauce and boil the pasta.  
4.  You MUST watch the sauce like a hawk.  DO NOT add more than a TBSP of butter at a time.  You will separate the sauce, and give yourself AT LEAST 20 - 25 min to SLOWLY incorporate the butter.  Do not rush this step.  
5.  Then just mix it all and serve with fresh parsley.  

I do not recommend this meal based on the enormous amount of butter and fat.  However, should you still choose to make it, if you incorporate the above changes you should be just fine.

I had a first generation Italian-American (parents "right off the boat" in his words) try this one. He says its exactly what his grandmother used to make all the time. Awesome recipe! May I suggest a Pinot Grigio to go along with it.

This recipe is worth a try (or two). Excellent taste, but the fat content could be trimmed a bit.  My teen son and husband who typically eat to live agreed that "amazing " was a good description. As suggestion by others, I substituted 3 oz. prosciutto, cut in strips, for the bacon, and used baby portabello mushrooms. The slightly different flavors were very compatible with the rest of the ingredients. The lemon sauce requires patience to prevent separation after mixing it with the chicken.  The next time I make this I will decrease the butter, use half&half instead of the cream, and perhaps considering binding the fat with a little flour. Make sure you have enough time for preparation. I would suggest allowing 60 minutes for preparation unless you have helpers.

I'm giving it 5 stars because my 3 and 6 year old loved it, and my husband said it was better than any Italian or pasta dish he ever ate in ANY restaurant.  That said, it was time consuming and extremely greasy/oily.  I cooked an entire pound of bacon separately very crisp.  I used half of it in the dish and saved the other half for breakfast.  For the mushrooms, I used baby portobellos roasting them in the oven for 20 minutes with some olive oil, bacon drippings and salt.  My husband said I should double the mushrooms next time.  Then I threw the capers, artichokes, and bacon in the oven with the roasted mushrooms to blend the flavors.  For the sauce i added extra lemon and wine.  I also added some fresh garlic sauteed in olive oil and it turned BRIGHT green.  My husband said it must be garlic ready to grow and it had alot of chlorophyll in it!  Luckily, it didn't affect the taste.  Lastly, instead of pounded chicken breasts I used tenderloins and didn't bother with the pounding. I like them a lot better and their less work.  Will make again, but on the weekend!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I made some slight revisions, but this was an amazing meal.  I left out the butter, bacon and cream (I didn't have butter, and I didn't think it needed bacon or cream, although I'm sure it's wonderful with it).  I sauteed the mushrooms with minced garlic in garlic&parsley-infused olive oil (I looooove garlic).  I took out the mushrooms and cooked chicken tenders (dredged in seasoning and flour) in more garlic-infused oil.  Then I added in about 1/2-1 cup of white wine and squeezed in a whole lemon and let it reduce over a simmer (letting the chicken finish cooking in the sauce).  I added in the artichokes and capers to heat up, put the mushrooms back in, and stirred it all together with some linguine (and yes, a few more passes wtih the garlic-infused oil to finish it off).  IT WAS EXCELLENT and really not difficult to make.  A definite keeper!

Very good!!  After a few nights of failed meals, this recipe redeemed me!  Way too much butter, I cut back to 2T and substituted chicken broth for the wine and started out by marinating the chicken breast with lemon juice and herbs.  Will make again - THANK YOU!!

I am so sorry but my gosh - this was awful!  Even though I read the other reviews about the butter separating, I though - hey, I can do this?  Well, I was wrong!  It looked good as long as I was cooking it, but low and behold, as soon as I poured it over the pasta, it separated and was a buttery mess - yuck!  Between the overly lemon flavor and the pasta literally swimming in butter and oil, it was a disaster, to say the least.  I MUST start believing everyone's reviews!  My guests looked at me like I was crazy and the leftovers were promptly thrown in the garbage.  Sorry - but will never make again!

This was fantastic. The kids and the hubby are still raving about it.

I fried the chicken in the leftover bacon fat - and found that 3 breasts were more than enough. 

Be sure to watch the oil/bacon fat/butter when sauteing the mushrooms. Instead of adding fat, keep them on lower heat so they release more moisture and simmer them in thier juices instead.

This recipe is awesome. Soo flavorful. My husband loved it so much, he barely talked while eating it except to say how good it was. Capers are so good with the chicken. I will make this over and over again.

This was so incredibly delicious.  So good, I submitted a photo--hope it works (first time).  I was surprised how very fast this recipe all came together.  I had planned on making a salad but never had the time.  The only subsititution I made was to use Italian Bacon (Pancetta) which worked beautifully because you can find it in perfect 4-oz packages in the gourmet section of your deli.  I rolled it up and sliced it thinly in seconds, and the edges stayed somewhat crispy in the sauce.  It went so fast that sometimes I was using two hands--one to flip the chicken breasts and one to stir in the butter of my sauce.  Pounding the full breast before browning makes for such a tender chicken.  I like that you brown it whole and cut it up only at the end.  Yummy and thanks Urbanchick for a nicely written recipe.

Amazing, just like the title says! I just made this. The only changes were that I used double the amount of chicken and 1/2 the amount of butter listed. I added all the sauce to the chicken mixture and it was just enough to coat it. I thought the taste was delicious. I did not need to add any additional seasonings (neither salt nor pepper). The capers, bacon, lemon and artichokes give it a variety of flavors. I love it! I definitely plan to make it again, and for company next time.

This is really delicious, but for those having problems with the sauce, the trick is to turn the temperature WAY down after the liquid is reduced before adding the cream and butter. Whisk in the butter in at a very, very low temperature (I turned the heat off and just let it sit on the warm burner while adding the butter) to avoid any separation. Set aside. After cooking the mushrooms and adding the chicken strips, turn that temp down to very low also, before adding the sauce.  I then let the mixture come up to a very, very light simmer before immediately serving. If you simmer too fast or boil the sauce it can separate. If you have to reheat any leftovers (I did, but I tripled the recipe for my family) do it very gently, or again, the chicken and pasta will be just floating in greasy lemony melted butter. Sure the sauce IS just melted butter and cream. But while it is still creamy, we can at least pretend it isn't as bad for you as it really is :)

I don't understand all the high ratings for this recipe.  It was visually unappealing, oily and bland (except for the capers which overpowered everything).  Not worth the effort it took to make.

UrbanChick, I can't tell you how great this one is and how much I appreciate your posting it! I followed the recipe to the letter - It was quick and easy to assemble and it came out just wonderful! It's got enough chicken meat for a carnivore like me, yet lots of other goodies for some of the others here at the ranch. Thanks!

This was different than I expected. I made the lemon sauce first and thought the recipe was going to be a disaster as it was very, very tart. I omitted the artichokes and added half a diced onion to the mushroom mix. Once the sauce & mushroom/chicken were combined the tartness was not too overpowering. I served with an Italian Rice as I didn't feel there was enough sauce for pasta. Overall it was a very tasty meal.

Absolutely delicious recipe. My husband and I loved this dish. I used penne instead of bowtie pasta and also topped with fresh shredded Parmesan. I also added some fresh minced garlic because you cannot have an Italian dish without it. The sauce was very gentle when mixed with everything else. The only downside to this dish was it was more time consuming than I was led to believe -- Easily double your cooking time. One way to cut down the cooking time might be to go ahead and cut the breasts up into chunks.

this dish was good, but not the "amazing" i was expecting from the reviews and the description.  i wished the sauce was a little thicker and had a bit more depth of flavor, but it was a nice change from red sauce.

I thought this was delicious. That being said, I did make changes to the Lemon Butter Sauce. I doubled all the ingredients except for the butter, which I only used 1/4 cup. When I tasted it I thought it was just way too lemony and strong so I added 1 can of chicken broth and a little flour to make it thicken. After making those changes I thought it was delicious. My family does not  like Italian food. *GASP!* I know, they are weird! So I probably wont be making this again any time soon even though I enjoyed it very much.

To keep the butter from seperating add some flour to the white wine and cream before it is hot, you won't have to reduce it as much and the flour will make the sauce thick. Basically you're using a roux to thicken the sauce.

SO, SO , SO GOOD!  I made this the other night with my husband for dinner and although we did not have the exact ingredients on hand, it turned out great.  I did not have wine or capers so I used chicken broth and peas.  I would have definitely preferred the capers, but the peas worked well too.  My husband was a little concerned with the amount of butter, but it turned out perfectly!  I can’t wait to make it again with the wine and capers, thanks so much!

I hated this recipe.  It was a horrible, greasy mess!  There is far too much butter in this and the sauce seperates as soon as you combine it with the pasta.  The lemon is really overwhelming.  Also, the recipe instructs to add the bacon with the other ingredients in the pan after cooking the chicken.  As a result my bacon wasn't crisp while all of the other ingredients were done.  I will never make this again.  If you decide to brave the grease and lemon definitely follow Barefooting's advice.

I made this last night, following the recipe as written (except for one small thing, I cooked the bacon first, drained most of the fat, then added the mushrooms, artichokes, and capers.)  It was really great.  Everyone but my super picky son ate it and really liked it.

This was very good, but not as great as I expected from the reviews and the prep time.  It seemed like it was missing something and if I make it again I'll add some shallots to the wine reduction.  The sauce is tricky, almost like making a buerre blanc, but take your time with adding the butter and you'll be fine.

If fixed as is, this comes out really greasy and fatty to the point of coating your mouth.  I now fix the recipe making the following changes to cut the grease:  I cut the amount of butter in the sauce in 1/2, only used olive oil in preparing the chicken, dropping the butter out completely because there was plenty in the sauce, trimmed the fat off the bacon and drained off in accumlated grease.  I garnish with lemon wedges and Parmesan cheese. I prefer linguini pasta over bowtie because it cooks more evenly.

I followed this recipe exactly and there was way to much lemon.  We had 3 people over for dinner last night and not one person liked it! It was not even just a little lemon.  The chicken tasted good but once the sauce was on it, it ruined the whole thing.  I actually made a creamy cheese sauce to try and eliminate the horrible flavor but even having double the amount of the half of the lemon sauce could not completly mask it.  I will never make this again.

WAY too much butter.  It stays in a creamy form while cooking in the sauce pan, but seperates and turn to grease when you pour it in the pasta.  Make a alferdo sauce instead.

OMG, this was, as the title says, AMAZING! My DH is not a lemon person, so I used 3T. lemon juice for the sauce, and seasoned where indicated for pepper with lemon pepper instead. Used proscuitto instead of bacon, may use less next time. When pouring the sauce over, did not use all of it, was fine with about 3/4 of what was made. DH loved it, and I don't even know if he noticed there was lemon in it! ^_^

This was insanely delicious! I took boneless chicken breasts and cut them into bite size pieces before cooking. I put the flour in a large bag and shook the chicken in it.  I also cut 6 pieces of bacon into small pieces before cooking with the capers and artichoke hearts.  I was leery of all the butter but do not skimp!! This is one of the best recipes I have tried on here and it makes alot!!

This tasted fantastic!  I did make quite a few revisions since I had neither the time nor the ingredients to make as written.  For the sauce, I used Pinot Grigio wine which worked great.  I cut the butter in half since it tasted good at 1/2 cup and a whole cup seemed excessive.  I added about a tablespoon of fresh rosemary and oregano and let it sit in the warm cream sauce while I finished the dish. 

I heat a tablespoon of olive oil and sauteed some sliced, salted mushrooms with an 1/8th of a tsp of anchovy paste and a splash of pinot grigio.  I sauteed until the mushrooms were darkened and the liquid was gone.  I dumped in some pre-cooked bacon bits and mixed them with the mushrooms just until they were warm and fragrant.

I tossed some cooked bowtie pasta with the mushroom/bacon mixture, and the cream sauce and topped with liberal amounts of parmesan cheese.  It was super fast and really tasty!  The cream sauce separated a little after the pasta sat for ten minutes or so, but it wasn't too bad.  Everyone wanted seconds except my picky little three year old.  He did eat almost all of his serving though, which he hasn't done for weeks.  He said he liked it.  This one is a keeper at my house!

This was DELISH. Savory, yet delicately blended. I added garlic and onions, because I love both. My husband doesn't care for capers, artichokes, or mushrooms. However, he did not pick out a single item. He had thirds each time we ate it until it was all gone. I will be making this a lot in the future. YUM

Be VERY careful with the sauce. If you heat it too fast the oils do separate and your noodles will taste oily instead of buttery and delicious. I've done this recipe with farfalle, penne, and linguine. All worked very well.

This lived up to it's name.  It is amazing.  I followed other suggestions.  I made the chicken first, as directed.  Then, I made the pasta (I used Penne).  I made the other additives next, but I used kalamata olives instead of capers.  I made the sauce last and doubled it, which was totally unnecessary.  The sauce does, however need to be made last.  It turned out better than restaurant quality.  Great dish!

I went back and forth between giving this recipe a 3 or a four because while the flavor was great it was too greasy for our tastes. I did cook the bacon on its own and drain it and I'm glad I did. I will be making this again but with much less butter. I didn't use the capers as my husband can't stand them but used marinated artichoke hearts to get back some of the tang that the capers would have added. Next time I want to try adding asparagus to the recipe, I think it would be really good with it. When sauteing the mushrooms I also added half a finely chopped white onion and 3 large cloves of minced garlic.

I am torn about giving this only 3 stars because it really did taste amazing. The problem is the directions in the recipe itself. I consider myself a decent cook and have made intricate meals, however if you're not familiar with cooking cream and butter sauces you can & will mess this up. I did not have time to read through all the reviews so, like I said before I'm a decent cook, so I thought it would be no problem. Unfortunately my sauce did separate. I was watching it closely but only a minute of getting distracted & voila...a greasy separated mess. I still used it because I wasn't going to waste all of that food and it still had an awesome flavor but it was definitely too greasy and I could tell it just wasn't right. I wish the directions were more clear with tips on how to prevent the separation. I will now read through the reviews and try it again probably with modifications.....that was a whole lot of butter!!!

Ok, so it isn't exactly the healthiest meal....It still has great flavor and is easy to make. I did double up on the artichoke hearts and left out the capers, but that was just personal taste. The servings say 6, but it fed 6 and there was still more left over. I recommend adding the butter to the sauce in smaller chunks than 1 tbs at a time to help keep the sauce from breaking.

This tasted really good. I used half the amount of butter called for in the sauce - I'm really glad I did because another 1/2 c. would have been too much for us.

I cut the butter sauce in half - just seemed  like way too much butter for this old body.  With all of these flavors together, I really think it should have been 5 stars - but mine didn't make it.  May have to re-rate when I make again - ...maybe I left something out?  More salt?  Who knows - will def make again!

Waaaayyyy too lemony!  My children would not even eat it.  I had such high hopes for this meal and it is sitting in the middle of the table largly untouched.  I like everything else about it, so I will cut the lemon by 2/3 and see how that goes - I can always add more.

I have never had so more failure than I did with this sauce.  I can only assume I did something wrong, since the reviews all raved about it, but I followed the instructions exactly and by the time I was halfway through adding the second stick of butter, my sauce was completely separated.  I tasted it at that point to see if it would still be edible, even if it didn't look appetizing. My only guess is that I either had the sauce over too high heat (even though I had it on the lowest heat setting possible on my stove, and it was still simmering) or I took too long to make it, as I didn't add the next pat of butter exactly when the last one melted each and every time.  In either case, I consider this to need far too much work and attention to make, if it is going to be so delicate that it will fall apart if not made precisely.  Very disappointing.

This is awesome! I sliced the chicken in to bite-sized slices then dredged in the flour, salt and pepper. In addition , I added Mrs. Dash lemon pepper salt free seasoning. I did have to triple the sauce as another reviewer suggested. The flavor was outstanding and I got compliments from everyone. I will make this one again for sure.

I only used the Lemon Butter sauce recipe, and it was great. Breaded some pounded chicken breasts and served on a bed of angel hair pasta covered with this sauce. It was great, tangy and creamy.

This is an INCREDIBLE recipe.  It's easy, and SO delicious... it's very similar to the Chicken Scallopine served at a popular italian chain restaurant.  It's very easy to make minor adjustments to suit your individual taste.  I personally like more lemon flavor, so I added a couple of extra Tbsp of lemon juice, and about 1/2 tsp of lemon zest... I also had pancetta available that I used instead of regular bacon.  I think it added a slightly more authentic italian flavor, but would be excellent with the regualr bacon as well.  NOM!!!

I didn't include the capers and used refrigerated fetticine noodles because I couldn't find any farfalle. Sure is a lot of butter! My family liked it a lot, but I think it was mostly because they really like the marinated artichokes in it. It's definately tasty but I don't think I'd go through all that work again. I didn't have a problem with the sauce separating but followed someone's advice and cooked it VERY slowly AND I made the sauce last.

YUM! This is fabulous. Only thing I would change? Cook the bacon first--then use the bacon grease to cook the mushrooms, artichokes etc...otherwise follow the recipe. I will make this more than once!

This recipe was a cross between two different dinners that two different friends had made me so I tried it.    It did turn out delicious, however, I started out following the sauce recipe to the letter.  (I omitted the bacon and for veggies I used artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, and baby spinach)  When I started to get to the end of the sauce making process, it was much much too lemony for me, so I ended up pouring in a whole half pint of cream into it to try and save it.  I was very concerned at that point about the amount of fat in the recipe.  So what I did was, add the chicken and veggies into the saute pan, and pour in a cup of chicken broth, and let it heat up.  I also added some garlic powder.  I was then able to use less of the cream sauce.    This recipe was a wonderful jumping off point, and we all really liked the meal, however, in the future, I will drastically reduce the amount of lemon, cut the sauce recipe in half with chicken broth, and add some fresh garlic.  It did remind me of the two meals made for me by loved ones and that was what I was looking for.    Thank you!

I starting making this recipe thinking it was going to be wonderful. Luckily, I tasted the sauce before I finished my chicken. The Lemon Butter sauce was extremely sour tasting. I do not think I will every try this recipe ever again. :(

I really had high hopes for this dish, but 3 stars is about the best I can do.  The sauce was SO lemony, that's all I could taste, so I had to do a lot of tweaking to get it to a point I'd feel comfortable serving.  I added some chicken broth, milk, a little flour, and about a teaspoon of sugar to the wine/lemon juice and butter mixture.  I did like the combination of bacon, capers, artichokes and mushrooms over the chicken, and after all my adjustments to the sauce, my husband really liked it.  Bottom line, it was entirely edible, but not something I'd make again.

Thanks for submitting the recipe.

My family gobbled down this recipe in record time. It was a huge hit with no leftovers. I would say that the instructions need to be modified a bit to include cooking the bacon and crumbling it before doing anything with it later in the recipe. My sauce never seemed to thicken but it worked just fine as it was once I tossed everything together. Also next time I would cut up the chicken, toss with flour and then cook. I think it would be easier to handle this way and would cook a lot faster. I would honestly say I was in the kitchen for at least an hour preparing the meal but it was very worth the time and effort. I think some of it could be done ahead of time to save time in the long run. All and all for a first attempt we loved the recipe and were willing to ignore the calories because it was fabulous! Thanks, Grandma for the inspiration!

The recipe's core ingredients great idea, the combination of those ingredients horrible! A few changes to reduce the grease: Cook bacon with mushrooms, the grease from the bacon is really all the grease you need for the chicken portion. My household is big pasta, so I doubled the pasta and doubled the sauce. However do not double butter, in fact take down to a 1/2 c of butter, could probably even go to 1/4 c of butter and add a cup of chicken broth. Make a roux with a little of the sauce to thicken up the overall sauce. Use about 3 - 4 T of sauce and add a few T of flour depending on how thick you want it, mix in small bowl and then pour back into sauce and allow to boil slightly to thicken. I did not fry the chicken but cooked directly in mushroom/bacon mixture when I added the sauce. Before pouring out pasta water reserve some just in case your sauce comes out too thick. Mix the pasta and chicken combination in pasta pan and let sit for a few minutes to allow the pasta to soak up some of the sauce. Depending on how you like pasta add some of the reserved water and sprinkle with Parmesan before serving.

Anything my boyfriend tries for the first time and goes for seconds gets 5-stars. When I first brought it out in a bowl and the BF saw it was a white sauce, he made a face. I told him to try it and that he could have plain chicken if he didn't like it. He took a couple of bites, cocked his head to the side and said "OK so far." After the full bowl he got seconds and said "It's growing on me." High praise from the pickiest eater I know. This recipe took longer than 30 minutes (around 45-50min by my clock) and I only used about half the butter for the sauce. Also, I used asparagus spears instead of mushrooms, steaming them first and adding them to the pan when it calls to add the sauce. But this was absolutely delicious. I just decided not to look at the nutrition facts.

Ok, this is very good. However, I am giving it 4 stars because the prep and cooking time is WAY off. I'd like to know who can prepare this from start to finish in 30 minutes! Also, how do you cook the bacon? (I stuck mine in the microwave). The sauce takes a really long time, and I don't know if all that butter is needed. I was cursing myself for choosing this, but when I tasted it, I was quite impressed. My husband said this was the best pasta he's ever eaten. I would say that it's worth the effort. Just be weary of the cooking times!

This was pretty good, although the sauce was very greasy.  And I even cut out some of the butter.  Make sure not to cook the sauce too hot.  Mine congealed.  Also, to cut down on the fat content, I used turkey bacon, which worked wonderfully.  I also added peas instead of capers and it was good.  Overall, good but cruising for a heart attack.

Sorry, but our family did not like this dish.  WAY too much butter and too lemony.  I wish I had read the reviews before making, as I would have at least tried using less butter.  This is probably one of the least healthy recipes I have ever seen.  Just check out the nutrition information on it.  It has 35.3 g of saturated fat!  That's 177% of the daily value.  This was not worth all the fat and calories.

This taste absolutely fantastic as made by following the recipe.  The problem is the amount of FAT in the recipe.  We used the amount of oil and butter suggested but, really became concerned when we were to saute the mushroom, artichoke and caper mixture with the bacon. We opted to cook the bacon ahead of time reserving 1 TBSP of bacon fat which we addesd to the skillet with the remaining olive oil and butter prior to cooking the mushroom mixture.

We also waited until the mushroom mixture had completed cooking to make the lemon butter sauce.  We found that if you make it in advance, the sauce ingredients begins to separate and you have to reheat and whisk the sauce to combine; we also had to add additional heavy cream at this time; so much for cutting down on the bacon fat but YUM!!

We also suggest that you really do not need any additional salt in this recipe.

So, if you are on a diet, this is not the dish for you.  But, if you want to cheat on that diet.. THIS IS THE WAY TO GO.

Thank you for a GREAT recipe.

Very good. Only used 1/2 cup butter for the sauce & I made the sauce close to the end instead of first. We aren't a fan of bacon, so I left it out. Otherwise, I kept the recipe intact. Yummy!

My husband and I thought that this was a very tasty recipe.  I made very few changes to this recipe.  The lemon butter sauce calls for 1 cup of butter, but I used about 3/4 of a cup.  I also cleaned out my pan after frying the chicken and replaced it with one tablespoon each of olive oil and butter.  My teenage boys and toddler girls LOVED it (minus what my 4-year-old daughter refers to as "the weird things" i.e. capers, mushrooms and artichokes!).  I definitely will be making this again.

Tasted great.  Substituted Fat-Free Half and Half and the lemon juice in the sauce did not react with it well.  I would use cornstarch to thicken it next time and omit the cream all together.

I would not recommend this recipe to beginners like myself. My boyfriend and I prepared this together and it was a bit overwhelming.  We ended up with a passable meal, but we couldn't really taste any lemon flavor (just butter).

I might try to make this recipe again because it has a lot of potential. I would  use less butter and a bit more lemon. I would also cut the chicken and bacon before starting any of the other steps in this recipe.

This recipe is just as delicious and won't leave you guilt ridden if you omit the bacon and cream, only add 3 TBS of butter and 2 TBS olive oil, and use chicken broth and a bit of cornstarch to thicken. I add basil and parmesan for extra flavor.

Excellent dish with a few modifications!!  Started sauce by melting 1 T. of butter & adding fresh garlic.  Then followed remainder of sauce recipe - except at end I also added about 1/2 C. of parmesan to the sauce.  Also, cut up chicken before cooking & coated w/ bread crumb mixture that had garlic salt & parmesan.  Used rotini pasta instead to really grab the sauce!  Will definitely prepare again.  Served with steamed asparagus (I even topped the asparagus with a little of the sauce -- yummy!)  Didn't think this took too long since I cooked the sauce, pasta, chicken, & veggies at the same time (when chicken was done, I just added the already cooked veggies to chicken pan then added sauce to that same pan).

This is fantastic. Greasy, but fantastic. I cut up the chicken before frying it and it worked well. I didn't have lemons so used lemon juice from concentrate. I used prosciutto instead of bacon. Next time I will try adding garlic and parmesan, but it has a nice flavor without them. I poured all the butter sauce in at the end and it was a little too much--too greasy. Only use as much sauce as you need to coat it.  But once again... fantastic!

Amazing dish!  Felt guilty eating it but the taste was unbelievable.  My whole family loved.  Next time I might cut down on the butter a little and I did use a little more cream, but other than that, followed directions.  Thanks for the great recipe!

As can happen, I made changes based on what I had. Used orzo instead of farfalle & added grape tomatoes because I had them & thought it would taste great & add color. Only used 1/2 cup butter because, 1 cup is insane. I'm sure1 cup is delicious, but my waistline & heart can't afford that luxury.  Next time I will add more artichokes & capers because I love them both so much.

I substituted asparagus for mushrooms due to allergies.  Found it to be lacking in seasoning.  In fact, I thought the asparagus was the best part of the recipe.  I love all the components...chicken, wine, butter, lemon, capers and bacon...but in this recipe they just didn't seem to come together properly.  It's edible but I'm continuing to search for a more flavorful version.

I didn't exactly follow the measurements for the sauce and while my family loved the flavors, they wanted more sauce.  It was a complicated process though, would have rather taken an hour rather than shoot for 30 minutes.

My family loved this recipe, but I used way less fat than the recipe called for. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream. It didn't thicken as much as it should until the butter was added.  I used the suggestions from other reviews and used half the butter called for in 2 places in the recipe. I used olive oil instead of regular oil. I cooked the pasta and sauce at the same time to save time.
Next time I would probably do the chicken early also.

The recipe didn't make a lot of sauce, which I worried about, but as lemony/tangy it was, it was fine.
I also used real bacon pieces that are sold as salad toppings (Hormel or store brand), and only used 2 oz. That way the bacon didn't overpower the dish. 

Finally I used fresh-grated parmesan as I plated it, which I thought added a nice flavor.

Overall, a keeper recipe. Hubby and 3 teenagers loved it.

this really was amazing! It took me a little over an hour, and I took quite a few shortcuts as mentioned in other reviews. I started with 3 thighs and cut them in chunks, then broiled them on high for 15 minutes or so. I made the sauce with a chardonnay, and only used 8T of butter. I had no issues with it separating, though I had a low and steady heat. I didn't have artichokes, and I made the bacon in the microwave and then crumbled it before adding it to the mushrooms (which I cooked in some butter). I poured half the sauce on the mushroom-chicken-bacon mix, and half on the farfalle after it was in the bowl. I stirred them separately and then together. I really thought the sauce was great, and I liked the dish, but it just took forever. Hubby liked it, but it's a little heavy so not a regular rotation for us. will make it for company in the winter, though!

I tried this recipe  and found the lemon sauce was so acidic that it was nearly inedible. I suggest 2/3 tablespoons of lemon juice is more reasonable. As I was expecting guests I saved the sauce by adding 250mls of cream and 3 sugar lumps

I made this dish tonight and while I thought it tasted quite good I found that there simply way to much butter and fat in this dish. I fallowed the recipe although I added less butter and even so I found that after dinner the noodles and chicken swimming in oil/fat. I think that for our house this is a one time dish. I would give it a 4.5 out of 10, I would give it a 3 but the flavour gave it those extra points.

oh my gosh this was so good!  the kids didnt like it by any means (7yrs and under), but hubby and i were thrilled.  i only used 1/2 cup of butter and after it was melted, i continued to simmer and stir until the very end.  i cut up the chicken (only needed 2 large chicken breasts), floured it, and added it to a pan of olive oil.  took that out, and cooked the bacon and then added canned mushrooms for a few minutes and then the artichokes for a few minutes.  I didnt add capers.  while the bacon was cooking i started the pasta.  after the bacon/mushroom /artichoke mix was done, i added the chicken to it along with half the sauce.  after that was mixed together i added it to the pasta and then added the rest of the sauce.  the sauce amount was perfect.  served with a gewurtztraminer, which is what i used in the recipe too.  delicious!  thank you!!!

what a delicious and easy dinner.  I made the recipe as written except for using milk and less butter.  the milk curdled a little but in the final sauce you couldn't tell.  I added a bit of starch to thicken it up.  The only caution is when tasting the sauce alone it seems way too sour but when the whole meal is combined it was great!

Love this! Just add peas. Omitted the capers. Diced the chicken from the start. Shook the pieces in a plastic bag to coat with flour- easy! Will HAVE to have again!

I made this dish tonight for my fiancé - he loved it! It was one of the best dishes I've ever made. This is definitely a keeper!

I made some changes, I used baby portobello mushrooms and pancetta instead of regular bacon. I also added about 1 tablespoon of flour to the sauce because it wasn't thickening for me. Another change I made was cutting the chicken in bite size pieces then frying, instead of the way the original recipe states. 

This was soo good!

This has become one of our favorite pasta dishes. I make it with penne rigate pasta, and without the artichoke hearts. I also found it easier to cook the chicken first and then the sauce last, like others suggested.

Amazing dish!! I added flour to the sauce to make it thicker. I also didnt use that much butter, it was way too much. I added oregano and thyme and left out the chicked since I am a vegetarian. It will definitely be a staple dish!

This is very similar to a recipe I got from one of those copy cat recipe books. It's a dish from Romano's macaroni bar & grill, very delicious. Make sure you make enough sauce so that the pasta is not dry. Trust me it's so delicious you'll wish you had made more. Instead of bacon the copy cat recipe calls for prosciutto and try angel hair pasta. Enjoy.

This was delicious, but I'm glad I read the reviews!  I used a bit over half the butter that was called for, and even so it was really quite buttery ... I might cut the butter further if I make it again.  I doubled the mushrooms (used baby bellas) and was glad I did.  Went heavy on the capers, since we love them.  The sauce was great (used fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 to cut calories); I increased the sauce by 50%, partly because of the extra mushrooms, and it worked out well.  I'd like to try this again but use either grilled or baked or lightly sauteed chicken, to cut the calories a bit ... as written, it's nicely decadent and rich, but I think a lighter version for everyday use would get cooked more often!

My family of 7 loved this recipe. I followed the directions almost exactly as directed.  Yum Yum . Next time I will make more sauce! Although it is pretty stout...just add a little more cream and a little more lemon juice...good stuff! Oh and I use white pepper.

Rich and so good! I used a little more wine, cream and lemon to the sauce. I  also added a little flour, just to help it bind and thicken it up. Very good.

my kids love this dish.  most of the time I only do the lemon butter sauce, pasta, and chicken and omit everything else.  I also changed the amount of butter to 1/2 cup.  you could also grill the chicken instead of pan frying.

The taste was great but was not a particularly healthy dish.  If I make this again I will look for a different lemon sauce that doesn't have an entire stick of butter in it!

This is not for the faint hearted. It is strong in flavor. My husband liked it, I thought it was ok, our 7 year old wouldn't eat it. My husband said he'd eat it once a week, so I may have to see how well it freezes.

I really enjoyed this recipe but I modified it substantially.  I added a red bell pepper to the caper, artichoke mix.  I used much less of the lemon butter cream sauce because it is very tart and creamy.  But once put together it was quite delicious.

I liked the flavor alot. I was a bit worried about the amount of butter so I only put 3/4 cup of butter. It was very lemony. I'll make this recipe again. :)

This is the recipe I have been searching for...with some of the suggested changes.  I had no problem making it in 30 minutes, but it does require one to work on different parts of the dish at the same time (ie: cooking the chicken while the sauce cooks.  For the sauce I cut the lemon to 4 TBSP and the butter to a 1/2 cup (which was plenty)!  I used 6 slices of bacon and would only use 4 the next time I make this as the bacon flavor was really pronounced.  I think the intention is just to add a smoky flavor to the other ingredients.   The only other thing I changed was to serve the chicken breasts, pasta, artichoke mix and sauce all separate to accommodate the pickier eaters at our dinner party.  Everyone raved and requested the recipe!

I gave this a 4 star only because it is so incredibly fattening. I made this one as a treat on a weekend night and yes it was yummy, but it was so heavy from all the butter that my stomach was a little upset after. I don't think I will make this again without trying to eliminate some butter. Way too fattening, but it was tasty of course!

This was very tasty and definitely company worthy dinner fare.  I did all the prep work in the afternoon, so all I had to do was cook everything and this came together in 20 minutes or so.  Although I followed the recipe ingredients for the most part, I did reduce the amount of chicken to 2 breasts (1 lb) and I butterflied them (instead of pounding) and then sliced into strips.  I also omitted the capers because I couldn't find any in my grocery store.  So the first thing I did was render my bacon so it was crispy and removed it from the pan. Then I floured and cooked the chicken and removed that and added the mushrooms and artichoke hearts (would also be very good with hearts of palm).  At the end of the cooking time, I added some chopped, fresh Italian parsley.  Meanwhile, I prepared the sauce and cooked the pasta; I didn't want to make the sauce too much in advance as I didn't want it to break.  Once everything was cooked, I added it all back to the pan along with the pasta, put it in a serving bowl and topped with more parsley.  The end result was really delicious - we'll most certainly make it again.

WOW!  This recipe is superb!!  I used purchased bacon bits and used a little chopped sun-dried tomatoes for an extra punch, and it is absolutely fabulous!  Tastes like eating out and is well worth the effort for an extra-special meal!  Thanks for a great recipe!

For two adults and a baby with leftovers, I halved the chicken and the butter (I am not a halve the butter type of gal, but the whole amount seemed insane) and it was awesome.  I tripled the capers, but hey, I like me some capers!

Very Good with some changes. I cut back the lemon juice and heavy cream to 4 tbsps and used about 3/4 a stick of butter instead of two sticks. I think you could easily cut back the butter to a 1/4 cup without compromising the flavor. Even with cutting way back on the butter, this dish was still a little greasy. I did not have cappers or artichoke hearts, so they were not used. I used cooked bacon and cut back the amount of chicken to three breasts. I really liked the lemon flavor and the butter still shined through in this dish. I would make this again but try it with only 1/4 cup butter. It definitly had a restaurant flair about it.

Overall, the taste was ok (too lemony for me) but I just didn't like how it all curdled up and it was, as others have stated, a greasy mess.  I used half and half, maybe that's why it curdled?  I don't know but I will not use this recipe again.  Sorry.

This was just ok for us... I would say that it's too lemony, as its rather sour.  It's also very greasy, even though I reduced the butter by 1/3.  The sauce began to break about halfway through dinner and towards the end we were left with a greasy mess.  It didnt taste terrible, it just wasnt as good as I was hoping it to be.. definitely not delicious or something i'd be willing to repeat in the future.

Way more work than you think.  And it turns out I don't like artichoke hearts.  The sauce didn't work for me either.  I will not be making this again.

I am a huge butter fan, but this recipe calls for FAR too much.  The dish really is very good, so I'm not going to fault it too much for the butter...I'm just going to make it next time with either less butter, or a totally different sauce altogether.

Took forever, but so very worth it! Allow a lot of extra time. I enjoyed cooking this, we weren't in a hurry to eat (thank goodness). I added a bit of garlic (we love garlic).

This was tasty but we did make several adjustments based on previous reviews and preference.  We used 1 Tbsp lemon juice, 6 Tbsp butter and more cream and a little flour to thicken the sauce and we cooked the bacon before adding it.

Because I am disabled, I am always looking for recipes with a minimum of ingredients and not to much pre-prep. At my house we also rate recipes: 1). UGH, who thought of putting this mess together !?!?!? 2). Easy... not too bad...good enough for my husband and me. 3). KEEPER!!!! Think of a reason to host a party!!!! This recipe deserves 10 stars, my compliments.

This is so awesome! One of the best I have tried! The flavor was just packed! Very comforting. I didn't have plain black pepper (believe it or not), so I used ground white pepper and it was perfect! SO GOOD! Thanks, Urbanchick!

Loved the recipe . . . only complaint is that it has got to be HORRIBLE for you.  I'm going to try it again and cut way back on the butter, cream, bacon, and oil.  I'll repost the results.

I think this was good.  My husband thought the sauce was a little tart, but both my boys ate it up with no issues.  I will definately make again.  I did cut back to 1/2 cup of butter and I think it came out fine.

I love this recipe!  To cut the fat I used light table cream in place of the heavy cream and added a little flour to thicken the sauce.  I doubled the recipe and still only used a half stick of butter and it came out great!

i used the baked garlic chicken recipe for the chicken but the lemon sauce with artichokes and bacon was really like a meal I'd get at a restaurant. It was time consuming but I felt worth the effort.

Very yummy!! I did make a couple of changes. I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and grilled them instead of frying them. I also pre-cooked my bacon in the oven (475 degrees for 20 min) Used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of light margarine (ok probably didn't make a lot of difference but I felt a little less guilty when I ate it) And I didn't have any mushrooms.  I will definitely make it again!

Delicious-Yes!  30 minute, easy-to-make meal-No! While the end result was yummy, this is not an easy mid-week recipe.  I found another poster's suggestion useful in streamlining the recipe by multitasking (having the pasta going while sauce is being made, etc.).  I also took the suggestion of others and cut the butter in half.  At one point my sauce began to separate, but I just added more wine and more cream and it came out just fine.  Also, if you are one who does not like your dishes to be tart, you may want to cut back not just on the lemon juice, but also on the artichokes and capers.  Overall a great dish!

This was awesome. It was creamy, and buttery, but without being heavy.  The mixture of the tart lemon, briney capers, and smokey bacon really complimented each other well.  This is definitely a new family favorite.

I guess I'm rating the sauce more than anything, since I changed everything else about this dish!  But I'll share anyway just to give you ideas if you'd like them.  I grilled chicken breasts in my grill pan to cut down on the fat a little.   I seasoned them with salt, pepper, garlic, and a little Italian seasoning.  I then set them aside until serving time. I made the sauce, just following the suggestions made and using just the juice from half a large lemon and 1/2 cup butter.  I chopped the artichoke hearts into smaller pieces, then sauteed them in a little olive oil with the pre-cooked bacon and capers.  I didn't use mushrooms because my family doesn't like them.  I served the dish plate-by-plate so I could make them up like I wanted to...a pile of angel hair pasta, the sliced chicken breast on top, then covered with sauce and the bacon mixture.  I wish I would have made more sauce...I had to use it sparingly to serve my family of five.  Next time I'll double it.  The sauce is really delicious...very rich and buttery.  Tastes gourmet, and I got great reviews from everyone.

We loved this!  It takes some work and it's important to keep the lemon butter sauce warm so it doesn't congeal.  I placed mine in a larger bowl of hot water while I made the pasta and chicken.  I also did not have any bacon, so I mixed in 4 tablespoons of real bacon pieces when I added the cooked chicken strips back to the sauteed mushroom and artichoke mixture.  This is a delicious and elegant dish.

I wish I read the reviews before I made this dish. I usually do but was in a rush to make dinner. Big mistake. First problem: Didn't know what to do with the bacon-add to the pan raw or cooked? I added raw and realized it would be way too greasy and 1/2 way thru drained the fat, aand finished the bacon in the microwave. Bacon should definitely be added cooked.  Wayyyy too much butter, separated,  and made for a gloppy mess. I followed the recipe except I didn't have the capers.  I think there is a good dish underneath this somewhere, so I will try again with modifications. Definitely less butter- like 1/2.

Great Dish. I do agree to cut back on the lemon. My two 9 year olds went back for seconds, so it's a keeper in my book!

Seriously, you really need to like lemon (like the puckering lemon taste) to enjoy this dish.  Our family of four could not eat it.  Had to make somthing else.

Although this dish created a lot of dishes and was very rich, it was very flavorful and well worth the effort. However, I made several changes.   I followed other reviewers advice and only put 1/2 cup butter into the sauce (1 cup is too much!) and next time I might just even limit it to 1/4 cup butter.  Also I only added 2 tablespoons lemon juice and increased the white wine to 1/2 cup.  In addition, I cooked the bacon before putting it in the skillet with the vegetables and capers.  I would not make this every week as it took about two hours to prepare, but I will definitely put this recipe into my keeper file.

What's the point of the white wine? Didn't taste it. A little too much butter. Otherwise, good.

I've had this dish or something similar to it in nearly every Italian restaurant.  I typed in the words "Lemon, chicken, artichokes, and capers" and found this.  It's an excellent rendition of a nameless classic!  The only things I did different was to use Angel Hair pasta, pre-cook the bacon to about 3/4 done, and separate the sauce from the pasta and chicken/vegatable mixture to allow people to decide for themselves how much of each to use.  2 out of 3 of us liked it, one said it was too lemony, and we all agreed that it was way too greasy.   I'll have to play around with it to change that.  Another thing - "10 minutes prep time"!!!  Yeah, right...it took me 20 minutes just to prepare and slice the chicken.  More like 30 minutes to an hour prep time, depending on experience.  All in all, a wonderful dish that needs a lot of tweaking here and there.

I made this on Saturday and let me tell you, my family thought it was wonderful.  I loved the lemony flavor, it was nice because you didn't have to use alot of sauce hence the butter was not a big issue.  My sixteen year old thought it was fabulous.  I will definately make this again and keep it on the list of recipes to use when I have company, very delicious.

WOW!  This recipe turned out to be very similar to one at Maccaroni Grill.  I didn't have enough butter, so I tried margarine in small amounts.  It made the consistency to runny, so I added cornstarch....turned out perfect. Also, I mixed everything together at the end.  This is a keeper, thanks!

This was good.  I sauteed all the vegetables together in olive oil (I snuck in chopped red onion)..then I decided I didn't need two whole sticks of butter in the lemon sauce, so I only used one...that was enough for our arteries tonight.  Didn't have capers...who cares! Something about browning the chicken first really made a difference.  Good.

Light and flavorful. I made only half of the sauce, and used pancetta rather than bacon.  Every bite was delicious.

Excellent flavor.  I would suggest leaving out the bacon, as the dish is rich enough.  I just crumbled some up and served it on the side.  Time consuming recipe (because of the frying) but well worth it!!

This is an awesome recipe!  We loved it and I'm planning to serve it to guests.    As others have mentioned, I too found that it is better to cut the chicken up before frying it.  Then it's all ready and has a crispy coating all around.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as stated and thought it was great!

If you have the feeling that you don't get enough butter and fat in your diet, this recipe is for you.  It is delicious and was actually quite fun to make, but I have to say the predominate flavor was butter.  Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but I was expecting a more well-rounded sauce with the wine and lemon juice.  Honestly this recipe was just too over the top with fat to feel good about making again, but I have to say it was a yummy stick-to-your ribs meal.

I am giving this the full five stars because it is a totally fantastic meal! Soooo tasty (albeit rich =^.^=).  I made a couple of modifications and highly recommend them.  I should also say, that this recipe took much longer than the said 30 minutes (between prep and cooking), but it's worth it. I diced up the bacon and cooked it up before adding to the other ingredients (who likes droopy bacon??).  I cut the chicken up into thin strips after cooking  it; it's nice to have the soft, moist white meat of the chicken (vs. cutting the chicken prior to frying ~ gets the crispiness all the way around).  Also, please don't skimp on the butter..it's really a big part of this dish!

This was absolutely delicious! 
It could easily be made as a vegetarian dish as well. This would make it even easier to make too. Just leave out the chicken and use "fake" bacon instead. I'd toss in some extra artichokes and mushrooms instead.

My husband and I agree this recipe is flavorful. We give it only 2 stars, though, because it took an hour to prepare and it was very greasy. For us, it was not worth the time or the calories.

Soooo good. I didn't have butter or cream, so I used margerine instead. Instead of the veggies listed I used broccoli and spinach. Still turned out to be amazing! Tossed in with some parmesean cheese. Loved it. I was afraid after tasting sauce it would be too lemony, but it was just right! Oh, also used bottled lemon juice instead of fresh.

Since I have a Meyer lemon tree, I have been searching for ways to use up all the lemons. For the last few months, I have been using Weight Watchers to lose a few pounds, and lemon sweets recipes have far too many points, so I have been trying various savory recipes. This recipe is a great choice, because it has a lot of vegetables. I altered the recipe to make it more diet friendly. I sauteed the chicken in 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon butter. I cut 2 ounces of  bacon into 1/4 inch pieces with a sharp kitchen scissors. After cooking the bacon for a bit, I added 2 packages of sliced mushrooms, one white and one crimini. Instead of artichoke hearts, I used a can of artichoke bottoms; they do not have any tough leaves to deal with, and they slice easily. For the sauce, I used Marsala wine; it was the only white wine in the house. I used a very generous 5 tablespoons of lemon juice. To this sauce I added only 2 tablespoons of butter. I melted an additional tablespoon of butter and added 1 tablespoon of flour, and I used that to thicken the sauce. There is never any cream in my house, and it seems silly to purchase a whole container of cream to get only 5 tablespoons. And 1 tablespoon of flour is 1 point, whereas 5 tablespoons of cream is 12 points. I used only 6 ounces of mini-farfalle. This was delicious comfort food and only 7 Weight Watcher points per 1 cup serving. The recipe made 8 servings using about 18 1/2 ounces of chicken. Next time, I think I would add a bit

Okay...amazing. One thing, I break sauces like some people break dishes. So my secret is to make roux to bind my sauce and then add the ingredients. A little thicker sauce, but definitely will not break. Sun dried tomatoes are a nice addition and if you want to cut the carbs and up the protein, this recipe is wonderful with quinoa instead of pasta!!!

I love this recipe - very rich - something different to throw in your rotation. Most of the kids aren't a huge fan because it's got a very lemon-y taste, but I love it. The only things I do differently are use less butter (the amount called for is really not needed, but that might be because I'm cooking for a large group and have to double or triple the recipe) and I don't use the capers because I forgot to add them the first time I made this. Not sure what exactly they taste like or if we're missing out by not adding them, but I think it tastes great without, so I've never bothered adding them. :)  Oh and I also boil the chicken instead of frying it. Just boil it and then shred it and add it to the mixture when it tells you to.

Excellent! To cut fat, I omitted the butter in the skillet, used 1/4 cup butter in the sauce, and used lean baked ham instead of bacon.  I will make this again.

Great recipe. Left out mushrooms (we don't like them) and added 2 cloves of chopped garlic when sauteeing the artichokes, capers & bacon. Doubled the sauce but used 1/2 & 1/s instead of cream. DELICIOUS!

Pre-cooked slivers of bacon, then cooked chicken in bacon fat.  Last-minute added artichokes and diced red peppers.  Doubled the artichokes, didn't add capers or mushrooms.  Added the lemon butter slowly to make sure I didn't get it too greasy as reviewers mentioned.  I ended up using 2/3 of the lemon butter.

Oh my goodness.  This should have been a smash hit.  Pasta!  Chicken!  Artichokes!  Bacon!  Mushrooms!  Capers!  Lemon!  Butter!  Silly me, though, I didn't read through the quantities, I just eyeballed all those delicious ingredients.  A FULL cup of butter?  5 tablespoons lemon?  It was oily, too buttery, too lemony and yet bland.  No one in the family liked it, including my child who generally only likes "white" food (like this visually dull dish), especially lemon grilled chicken.

I only made the sauce. I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and only 4 tablespoons of margarine. I would have liked more lemon. It was very, very rich and very good.

Wish I had read some of the reviews and tips before I tried this for the first time last night.  I spent around an hour and a half making it, but I think slightly pre-cooking the bacon and pre-slicing the chicken would move it along faster.  The only modification I made was using tri-color pasta.  Love the idea of adding tomatoes and parmesan.  The sauce was not as creamy as I would have liked, so I might add more cream next time.  Amazing to have an Italian dish with no garlic, but it was so flavorful, never missed it.

I opted not to pour the sauce over, but to serve it separately. The family liked the chicken and pasta mixture, but did not like the sauce at all.

I must confess, I made this recipe for the first time YEARS ago, right after I first found this website, and I have never reviewed it.  I have to say, this is honestly one of the best recipes I have ever made or eaten.  It is super-rich, but worth the time and calories.  If you want to seriously impress someone, you should make this dish.  The only thing I would note is that it does not reheat very well if you have any left over.  If being the operative word. :)

This is a very good recipe, and I am docking a star because of the same criticisms that others have mentioned -- the prep time is completely inaccurate and I agree that there is too much butter.   I ended up making the sauce as directed other than using only 1/2 the butter.  I did not have any problems with separation in the sauce - it was smooth and lemony.  I ended up making this quasi-vegetarian, so I left out both the bacon and the chicken though I did saute the mushrooms and artichokes in a little bit of bacon grease instead of olive oil for the flavor boost.  I also used an 8 oz. package of baby bellas and a 14 oz can of artichoke hearts.  I didn't have capers so didn't use them either.  I did sprinkle the finished product with some freshly shredded parmesan which was a nice addition.  Served with a cold glass of a good chardonnay (that I used in the sauce) this ended up being simple and very satisfying.  It's a lovely dish full of summery flavor!

Amazing is an understatement! I made a couple of months ago and have been waiting for another opportunity to make it. I followed the recipe pretty close to as written and it was fantastic!

I decreased the recipe to make less, and also left out the artichokes, since I didn't have any. I didn't realize how much butter it called for until later, and it called for ALOT. I only used about 80% of what it called for, but still turned out good.

This was REALLY good! The capers add a wonderful flavor to the dish and it requires little seasoning or enhancements. I followed the recipe almost exactly. The thought of adding a cup of butter really made me sick, so I instead doubled the white wine (actually, I substituted this for chicken stock) and increased the heavy cream a bit and then only used 4 tablespoons of butter for the sauce. I really enjoyed the flavors and all of the ingredients in the pasta. It made great leftovers too!

Excellent flavor. I poured all the lemon butter sauce in. Next time I think I will increase servings to 8 but use same amount of sauce. It was too greasy. But I loved the capers and artichokes!

I had such high hopes for this recipe, and had been waiting for a special occasion to make it...So, had my family over and made this dish for 8 of us (adjusted recipe to increase quantities).  Despite the fact that I made a mess of my kitchen and dirtied many pots and pans making this, it fell short in satisfying my family.  Four people after tasting, refused to eat another bite, and I thought it was way too rich (too much butter) and not complex.  The bacon does help balance out the tartness of the lemon, artichokes and capers, but it REALLY needs Onion and/or garlic!  That was the resounding call around the table.  All around, everyone was suggesting "it might be better if..."  So, thanks anyway, but I won't bother making this again.  The timing for the recipe is way off as well...it took me an hour of prep and cooking (just crisping the bacon alone took about 15 minutes).  Bottom line, it was way too much work and mess for a dish that no one even liked!  I had to toss all the leftovers as no one would eat it, and we hate wasting food!

This was very good. I added 2 tbs of Romano cheese to the flour for the chicken and cut it strips before cooking. I also added chopped green onions when the mushrooms were almost done.  I will make again but only on rare occasions.

The sauce was my inspiration.  I made it first and added 1/2 the cream and a tsp. of whole grain mustard.  The bacon seemed too greasy with all that cream in the sauce so I just sauteed flour-dusted chicken tenders in olive oil.  When they were done, I took out the chicken and added spinach to the saute pan and cooked it.  Served all with the sauce - great method for making a quick and delicious sauce.

I made this for dinner last night and it was amazing. I try not to change the original recipe but my family refuse to eat capers and artichokes so I substituted frozen peas that I steamed in the microwave. I always marinate my chicken and I cut the chicken into strips before marinating. The chicken absorbs the delicious sauce brilliantly. I also used real bacon crumbles that I lightly cooked with olive oil along with the steamed peas to save time.

Wow! What a impressive dish! I only gave 4 stars because of all the butter. I tried to cut back and use only 3/4 c butter which seemed to work fine taste wise, but hen I wanted more sauce so I added 1/2 jar of Trader Joe's Alfredo sauce, which caused me some separation problems in sauce. The taste was divine, but turned very oily. Also cut chicken up before frying. I'll try again and do as written. Thanks!

This is still a family favorite at my house!  I do add garlic powder, basil, onion powder, and oregano to my flour mixture for more flavor.  I also cut down the butter a small amount.  I begin cooking the chicken first (step 3)...

I am eating low-carb and was looking for something new.  This recipe was delicious.  Bursting with yummy flavos.  I doubled the sauce recipe with the exception of the butter (kept that at the single recipe amt.) just because that was all the butter I had on hand but it really was fine that way.  And also used chicken broth in lieu of wine (carbs).  Otherwise kept it all the same recipe. Loved the lemony-butteryness of this with the tang of capers and artichokes and the smoke of bacon!  Put it on low-carb spaghetti pasta with a salad. Picky (but skinny) husband liked it too This will be a new favorite!

I found the lemon and butter content of the dish to be fine, if you use salted butter, and if you let the sauce boil with the cream until it thickens, you should not have trouble with it separating. What I would do is use more pasta and vegetables and less chicken.

I would recommend decreasing the amount of lemon juice and be very specific about the wine you use in the sauce as it makes the dish.

I would also up the preparation to serving time to 60 minutes.

Finally I added some tomato, garlic, basil based pasta sauce to the mix if you like that type of thing. Really enhanced the sauce.

This was a huge hit! I made a couple small  changes to make it a little bit healthier: omitted the bacon, used skim milk with low-fat butter for the  sauce, thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch since I didn't have cream. It came out wonderful!

Very good, will make again!! Used only 1/2 the amount of butter and added onions....next time will probably use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream....Kids loved it too, asked for the leftover for lunch the next day!

Do yourself a favor and brown the bacon before adding the fresh mushrooms and canned artichoke hearts.  I ended up with cooked, yet flimsy and fatty bacon pieces.

made it twice now, and it is awsome good.  Does not have to be so fatty.  I used fat free half and half for the cream, and light margarine for the butter.  Used fresh lemons including the pulp for a very lemony flavor.  I agree with the previous comment to add double the artichoke hearts, and I even added some chopped zucchini and yellow squash for more veggies.  Used some bacon bits instead of the regular bacon, and whole wheat pasta.  My family loves this, will make over and over!!

This came out just "ok" to me. My husband and kids loved it, but the lemon flavor was too strong and adding the parsley made it even worse. Too much of a bitter taste for my liking. Maybe next time I will half the lemon juice and omit the parsley.

Made this wonderful meal for my wife this past weekend.  I did make one major change and that was to remove the Lemon from it and replace it with Garlic and left off the capers.  It came out very, very good and must say I will be making this again in the future!

Very tasty and appealing-looking.  I used chicken tenders which I cut smaller and the new wheat pasta.  My only problem was that the cream sauce did not thicken, but why would it when it was only added to wine and lemon juice?  I cooked it down a bit and it was fine.  Don't brown the bacon in MORE butter; there is plenty of grease to saute the artichoke hearts, etc.  I'd use more capers the next time.  Makes 6 GENEROUS servings.

very delicious!  like others, I modified considerably to reduce fat and calories.  I used 5 T milk instead of the cream and only 3 T butter.  I also added the flour from the chicken coating to thicken it up a bit.

I made a big alteration to this recipe by eliminating the chicken and doubling the artichokes.  It turned out great.  Not diet food by any means, but very tasty.

This dish was amazing, reminded me of the jerk chicken pasta they serve in Bahama Breeze minus the jerk. It tasted great and was very simple to make. Will most definitely make it again! I added asparagus instead of mushrooms and it came out amazing! thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Ugh. This was a disaster, and a sad waste of ingredients. The sauce was a miserable, oily, seperated and unedible disaster. I ended up having to toss it out and quickly whip up a white cheese sauce in order to save the rest of the dish. (goodbye to an entire package of butter....)

This dish was alright.  Despite the fact that I loved all of the ingredients and am definitely a fan of butter and lemon anything, the sauce did nothing for this dish.  I didn't have a problem with the greasiness others did, but the sauce just didn't pack the flavor it seemed to promise.  It wasn't flavorless, just nothing to write home about and more work than it was worth in my family's opinion.

This was one of the best chicken recipes I've ever made - only thing I did differently was fry the bacon ahead and sauteed the mushrooms in the  drippings and cut down on the butter by 4T.  - reminds me of a dish I was served in an Italian restaurant in Caesar's Palace and always wanted to duplicate.... :)

Pretty good - but I didn't think it was really worth the effort. We enjoyed the flavors, though, so I think I'll figure out a way to modify the recipe so that the same flavors are there. I did use about 1/3 the butter, and it was plenty rich. I also substituted half and half for the cream. The sauce was delicious, I must admit.

Mmmmm all the flavors went so well together; I do think they need to add "Pasta" in the name to be more accurate.  I changed a few things in the way I prepared it.  I didn't mix the chicken into the sauce but saved the sauce to pour over the pasta after plating.  I also cut up my chicken before frying and pre-cooked the bacon because I like bacon crisp.  I didn't use capers since I didn't have any but will next time; so good and hubby loved it! :)

This seems to be about 3 different dishes all rolled into one.  And not in a good way.  There are too many flavors going on.  All the flavors seperately are good , but ALL mixed together, it's a miss.  I think the chicken and artichokes would be great with the lemon butter sauce.  Or the chicken, mushrooms and lemon butter sauce.  The bacon was compleltely lost here.  And in lost I mean it just did not belong. IT overpowered the delicate flavors of the artichokes.  Then you add another salty dimension with capers.  I followed the advice of others and made the lemon butter sauce at the end so it wouldn't seperate.  It didn't but this dish is a heart attack on a plate and it's not worth it. Sorry.

I didn't find this sauce worth all the calories. I agree with other reviewers here- you definitely need to make the sauce last so it doesn't separate, but I still found it too greasy.

I would have given the star a 3, however my wife would have given it a 5. This is an acquired taste I assume. Personally I found the lemon to have way too much presence in the sauce, and the whole dish tasted way too tart. The bites with bacon were fine, but otherwise it was like a kick in the mouth. My wife didn't have the same complaint, so its a matter of how much you like tartness in your dinner.   For reference I absolutely love lemons.

This was a unique recipe. I loved it. My boyfriend didn't. If you like sour things then this recipe is for you. I put less butter and more cream. Thanks for this recipe I will make this one again for my sister when she comes to visit b/c she loves this kind of food.

What can I say, "I love this dish." It is so great, it is work, it is not very healthy, and it is incredible! I have made this dish with less butter, less cream, wheat pasta, more capers, more artichokes, no mushrooms, etc. No matter what I do to it it is still by far one of my all time favorites. Bless you URBANCHICK and the 'Dear Italian Woman' who created this dish. This dish will be in my family from now on. ;-p

This was a very good recipe. I will say that i usually always make the recipe exactly like it states to give it a try. My advice is to cut back on the capers! they do overwhelm the flavor of everything else.

Excellent recipe!  It was easy to double for a larger crowd.  We cut the butter back since we doubled the recipe and the flavor was great.  I would also recommend making the sauce last.  I prepared the chicken with an egg wash and bread crumbs since I had to do it earlier in the afternoon.  We served it with the angel hair pasta we had on hand.  I'll make this one again and again.

I loved it. I didn't add the bacon, capers, artichoke, or mushrooms since I was usuing this recipe to use what I had on hand. Though I'm sure it would of been even more delicious with all of those things. I also used some chicken I barbequed the night before instead of the recipe so I guess I'm rating the sauce. Definitely make this.

My husband liked it as is, but I think the flavor of the capers was a bit strong so next time I'm going to decrease the amount of capers to probably 2oz and add 1 or 2 diced roma tomatoes to add a little color and counter the caper flavor.  Otherwise this was an excellent recipe.

This is a delicious recipe.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is so fattening.  Next time I will reduce the butter and use fat free 1/2 n 1/2.  MY picky father in law loved it.

This dish was delicious.  I tried to use healthier ingredients, by using Smart Balance butter and half and half for the sauce.  The sauce tasted by itself was overpowering with lemon, but when added to the chicken mixture, it blends in really well.  I didn't ladle the sauce onto the pasta, just used what clinged to the meat mixture, so half the sauce was still in the pan when we were done eating and I didn't feel like we ate a ton of butter.  The bacon really adds to the flavor and I didn't have capers, but love them so they would have been a great addition.

Very good.  The recipe seemed a bit overly-complicated, so I streamlined it.  It was still very good.  I was leary of the lemon, but (for those who might feel the same as I did) I wanted to reassure you that the lemon manages to accent the bacon's flavor... making it tangier than usual, but not so much noticable as lemon.

This is almost exactly like the chicken scallopine that Macaroni Grill makes... which I love.  I had found and made this recipe a couple years ago, then I miss placed my copy and have been searching everywhere.  I read review to more chicken recipes than I can explain... but found the review that I had seen a couple of years ago and new this was it!  AWESOME!

I've made this a few times now, and really love it. I left out the bacon and added artichoke hearts. It's not the best for left overs (gets pretty oily when re-heated) - but it so yummy when fresh.

This dish is just like the chicken scallopine at Macaroni grill.  It was awesome.  I recommend to double artichokes and bacon.  Also add a little corn starch to sauce to thicken a bit(after you pour half onto chicken.)After I cooked the bacon and set aside I cooked the chicken in half the bacon grease instead of 2T of oil.  It gives it great flavor but be sure to let the chicken brown, it's important.Great recipe!!!

Yummy!  This was delicious!  I used a lot less butter though; 1/2 stick instead of 2 sticks.  I also put a little garlic powder in at the end and put in about a third cup of chicken stock I needed to use up.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

My family and I loved this pasta. Instead of artichokes, I used broccoli and I omitted the capers (dont like) and bacon (didnt have any) and added some grated parmesan to the sauce... but followed the directions for everything else. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Very good, but make sure you taste the sauce as you add the lemon juice. Once it gets thicker, it gets much more tangy.

This recipe is FABULOUS! I followed all the directions except I omitted the mushrooms. Also, you really don't need to use quite that much butter in the sauce...you can decrease it by about a stick and it still comes out fine. This is definitely not something you want to eat if you're watching calories though!

We all loved this recipe! I cut the butter to 3/4 cup and left everything else the same. (We didn't have artichoke). I used precooked bacon. I browned the chicken first and then browned the mushrooms while the chicken cooled enough to cut it up. I put the chicken and mushrooms in a separate plate and made the lemon butter sauce. I put the bacon and capers into the sauce, then added the warm chicken and mushroom mix. We chose to put it on top of the noodles at the table instead of tossing together.  I used curly noodles because that was what I had on hand. (they cooked while I was doing all of the fussy stuff.) I think the whole thing took about 45 minutes from start to table.

Wonderful dish - however I made a couple of variations to give it a fuller flavor.  First I browned the chicken in the butter, adding a couple tablespoons of Olive oil to prevent burning, and then completed the sauce adding to those drippings. I also added 1 tbsp of chicken broth base to the sauce.  I BIG hit with all!  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

This is a fabulous recipe and I absolutely love it, but I gave it three stars because it is quite greasy as is.  I used half and half in place of cream and omitted much of the oil that it asks for.  I also chose to use a reduced fat bacon that is precooked for convenience.  I found that my tweakings did not reduce the flavor in any way.  This is an amazing recipe and my family devoured it.  I will make this again and again.

We saved on the calories and fat by using fake bacon or real bacon bits.  We also saved on fat/cal by puree-ing artichoke crowns and adding them to the sauce to thicken it.  We then reduced the butter and cream.  Flavor was still great.

Lastly, we like the chicken better when it's cut into small bites instead of strips.  It has more flavor and is easier to eat.  Cook at LOW HEAT to keep the chicken moist.  I seem to screw that part up and dry it out!

Yum...I didn't really follow the directions.  Sauteed garlic in bit of butter and olive oil.Added wine and 1TBS lemon juice. Brought to boil.  Used Purdue pre cut chicken tenders.  Dredged them in flour.  Browned them in the butter/oil/garlic sauce.  Only had canned mushrooms.  Used two cans mushroom slices...added these and the artichokes and continued to saute. Only had Canadian Bacon...cut it up in tiny pieces and added.   After several minutes added capers and 1/2 & 1/2.  Only had Penne pasta.  But...it was awesome.  Highly recommend.

This was very good.  I used a tricolor orecchiette and bacon bits.  The lemon sauce is tart, but when added to taste at the end of cooking, it is a great complement.  I served it with a salad and rolls

I was looking for just a lemon butter sauce to go over some chicken ravioli, and I found this recipe.  I think the next time I make it, either the wine or the lemon needs to go, and it was really geasy.  It has great flavor and I will use it again, but will probably make a few adjustments.

Okay, this dish is outstanding! It is rich, and I usually use less butter, and have used less lemon juice.  It can be a little powerful on the lemon side, but if you like lemon--go with it.  I have made this dish for friends, and just my husband and I, and it gets rave reviews each and every time.  Try it!

Amazing pretty much sums it up! I just realized that I didn't use the butter it called for and it was still superb.
I added about 5 cloves of garlic because we love it and grated some parm on top. Thank you for this recipe!!!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe, but the last reviewer is correct, it did take me about an hour to prepare, I don't know how anyone could pull it off in 30 minutes.  I made a slightly more lowfat version. For the sauce I used 1/2 cup of white wine, 6 tablespoons of lemon juice, 6 tablespoons of soy milk, and 10 tablespoons of butter.  I used 1 and 1/2 pounds of 98% lean chicken breast meat and cooked 8 slices of bacon until crispy in the microwave before adding it to the pan.  It was enough for 4 servings and tasted even better the 2nd day.

I had mixed reactions to this recipe. I thought the taste was great, but the prep and ingredients just didn't fly like the way it was supposed to and I had to modify. First of all, way too much chicken for the sauce. You need to double it or make 1/2 the chicken. The fat & calories overwhelmed me and there really is no way to make it lighter. Anyone got any ideas? I tried chicken boullion, but way too salty as the sauce is quite delicate. Also, I just had to put garlic in it because I didn't like the taste without it. I also added some basil and rosemary. I changed bacon to prosciutto as suggested and that was a good thing. I think bacon would have been much too greasy. I ended up serving this over herbed rice and it was good. With the lack of sauce, pasta would have been much too dry. Not a bad recipe, just not accurate.

Used 1/2 the butter and 4 tbl of cream and found it not greasy.  Lightly lemony which was nice but something was missing.  Chives or parmesean or something.  Not sure yet-will work on tweaking it but it was a nice base to start from.  Thanks for the ideas!

I didn't have all the ingredients but felt that the basics of the recipe sounded good.  First I cut the recipe in half since there are only 2 of us.  I didn't have the wine (we don't drink), artichokes, mushrooms or enough lemons.  First I fried the bacon and set it aside.  In another pan I put a little water, the juice of 1 lemon and 3 limes, simmered it and just added slices of butter every now and then to let them melt.  I fried the bacon and set it aside.  Sprinkled the chicken breasts with flour, salt, pepper and Paul Prudhommes meat seasoning and fried it. Set it aside.  Drained most of the oil from the pan and fried the capers.  Added back the bacon, chicken and lemon, lime, cream, butter mixture and served over spiral macaroni.  It was really good.

This was OK. I cut back on the lemon but the lemon flavor was still very strong. I also cut back on the butter by half. I don't think the end result was worth the effort or amount of fat in this recipe. I don't think I will make this again.

Amazing! I followed some suggestions and cut the amount of butter in half (at least) and doubled the amount of sauce. I also used pre-cooked bacon (it tasted great!). Highly recommended! Thank you very much for such a good recipe!

I used 1 tbsp. fresh lemon and can not imagine using more. I also halved the butter and used A LOT more cream (I like my sauces white and creamy). I did not use capers (didn't have them on hand). My whole family really liked it. I served it on top of heart shaped pasta for valentines day.  :)

I think that this recipe could be better with some work. I should have followed the reviewer's advice that suggested adding more cream. There is way too much lemon for my taste. I used the called for amount of butter and it was too much. I didnt use bacon or capers. The chicken and mushrooms turned out great though. I think if I reduce the butter and lemon and make the sauce a little creamier it would be much better.

As many others have reviewed, the butter/fat content can be reduced and still have a great outcome.  Just be sure to drain your capers well or else the dish will be REALLY salty.

This is, absolutely, my favorite dish on this site!  I used angel hair pasta, and didn't pound the chicken, but other than that I didn't change a thing.  The sauce can "break" if you're not careful, but if you can make hollandaise you'll be fine.

This was okay... I probably would have loved this if I put all the butter in... but I didn't want to put in 1 cup of butter when one TBS is 100 calories... So I probably won't make this again.

Great flavor, I will make again with less butter - it was greasy.  It is definately not a 30 minute meal - unless maybe you are on a cooking show and everything is already cooked, chopped and measured, etc :)

Wow, this was better than some pasta entrees I'v had in restaurants.  I did cut the butter in half, it was still very flavorful.  Don't sub other ingredients.  If you want light, pick a different recipe.  This is worth the extra artery clogging calories!

This had a wonderful flavor with the lemon and the cream sauce. It took a while to make the sauce adding all that butter one T at a time. (eek!... a CUP of butter?!!!!) I used unsalted butter, a jar of sliced mushrooms and a can of artichoke hearts. I didn't have capers. The only complaint I have is my sauce was perfect in the saucepan, but after I added it to the chicken the butter and cream separated. This made a hearty meal served with a tossed salad and warm crescent rolls. We all thought it was okay, but none of us wanted it again.

This is the BEST!!  I just made this today and it came out wonderful.  This tastes almost just like a certain chicken in white wine sauce dish made by a popular Italian restaurant chain.  If you want to make this recipe go a little farther, double the pasta to 1lb, add one or two more chicken breasts, and double the ingredients to make the sauce.  Again, this is WONDERFUL!

I loved this since I love chicken, lemon, mushrooms, capers and butter.

I didn't actually make it myself yet.  I had our Pakistani cook make it while I was deployed so he had to make some substitutions (no bacon since it's pork).  It was good every time he made it except for the one time he tried to substitute the white wine with white wine vinegar.  He didn't know the difference.

I do agree with lessening the butter though.

This is the first recipe I used off Allrecipes.com and it is fantastic, my family askes me to make it for them at least twice a week. WE have yet to get tired off it! We love it! The only thing I don't use is the bacon, it makes the dish far to greasy.

I also halved the butter in the sauce. My family will tell you that I absolutely love butter (more-so than is healthy, surely), but I can't imagine an entire cup in this! The one stick used was perfect... the flavor of butter did not take over. I also used white cooking wine with lemon (what I had on hand) and some lemon pepper as well... turned out very well. The sauce ended up separating on me in the end-- I must not have kept it warm enough (in oven at 170), but all the flavors were there. I doubt I'll be making this every week, but it is a keeper!

This recipe is great- very rich with a wonderful lemon aftertaste.  The lemon also gives the sauce a little zip.  When I try new recipes, I always ask my husband "is this one a keeper?" meaning should I put this into my monthly rotation? And he replied "this is a I'd-like-to-eat-it-once-a-week keeper!"  Next time I make it, I will cut down on the sauce.  The recipe yields too much of the lemon butter sauce and leaves too much of a buttery residue at the bottom of the pan.

This recipe is so so tasty...and a hearty dish. Make sure you use unsalted butter! I just used what I had and it came out too salty. Suggest a revision to include "unsalted" where the ingredients mention butter.

This tastes just like one of my favorite recipes at a frequented Italian chain.  My grandmother hadn't heard of capers and had only had artichokes a handful of times and raved about this recipe.  I added a hint of sugar to blend the lemon.

I made this as the recipe states, but only used artichokes and no other vegetables, and I cut the chicken first and tossed it in a bag with flour. It was soooo delicious. I suppose you could reduce the butter, but I didn't and I thought it was fine. I believe it is impossible to make this in a half an hour though, especially if you have children. You really need to be uninterrupted to make this recipe because there are too many things going on in the pots at once.

This is unbelievable! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out amazing. My husband said this is his new favorite dish I make! I am an intermediate cook and it wasn't hard at all to make! I follwed others advice and cut the chicken into bite size peices first and put them in a ziploc bag and tossed around in the flour. I also cooked the bacon in the microwave then chopped up.
2 thumbs WAY up!

Great flavor- bowl full of grease at the end of cooking it. I had to "drain" pasta before it was served because of the butter and oil. I doubled the sauce which was way too much for butter for me. I should have thought about the amount of butter before I cooked with so much. I was just not able to get passed all the liquid butter to enjoy it. All I could think about was eating that. I did not use artichoke hearts because I did not like them and the pasta was just covered in grease. We will not be having this again.

There is so much to rave about, where to start? The most outstanding asset of the dish is the sauce: so delicate with subtle wine and butter flavours. I may have used a little less butter (didn't measure by the cup) but it certainly didn't turn out too greasy nor did it overpower the flavours. I also added all the lemon juice called for - when I tasted the sauce I thought it had a pleasant citrus flavour but mixed with the pasta and chicken in the end I thought it could deal with EVEN MORE lemon for a nice summery dish. So don't be scared of it, it's very nice! I also loved the crispiness of the chicken and it was a great trick to fry the mushrooms and bacon in the drippings! Everything came out golden brown and flavourful! I left out the artichokes and capres simply because we don't like them, but it didn't seem to miss anything. All in all it was fantastic!

As I was cooking this dish I was blown away at how much butter it called for.  I pressed on and followed the recipie to the letter.  My wife loved it. 
I thought it was good, but I reserve 5 stars for only the best of the best.  I will make this again.

MyMy dh and girls give this recipe 4 stars, I was a little disappointed. After making the sauce, I discovered it had an extreme lemon flavor.  I highly suggest starting off with 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice and then adjusting from there.  I only added 4 tablespoons of this sauce to the whole dish.  Dh added more to his bc he liked the strong lemon flavor.  I went back and made another mixture with wine, butter and cream and added that as well.  I will make this dish again just with less lemon.

This had fantastic flavor but way too much butter/oil. I am the youngest cook in my fam (21) and was judged harshly for the high fat content of this chicken. My extra sause separated for some reason and had small brown balls floating at the bottom (!?) it may have been too hot! Overall I enjoyed the flavor, but the guilt was too much to make this often!

I enjoyed the flavor however, like others, too much butter, next time I will cut it in half.  I believe I will also add some red, green and orange bell peppers to give it more color.

This just didn't come together for me.  I thought it was way too rich and I didn't like the lemon flavor.

Too lemony! Next time I will reduce the amount of lemon juice that I add to the sauce. Also, I did not use 2 sticks of butter like the recipe called for. I topped it off with paremsan cheese, which was a nice touch. I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh for convenience, and they were good. I might cut the artichokes up smaller next time (they were quartered).

Delicious! I modified it somewhat to suit my husband's and my dietary restrictions. First, we omitted the pasta entirely, so I only made half the amount of sauce called for. I used Smart Balance in place of real butter in the sauce and it still tasted decadently wonderful and held together well. I couldn't particularly taste the lemon, though, so next time will add more of that. I also used turkey bacon in place of real bacon, and instead of coating the chicken in flour, I used grated parmesan cheese and oat bran. I cut the chicken before cooking it, placed it in a large bag with the coating, and shook it up to coat, then cooked it in two batches. I served this with peas, which tasted great mixed in. Next time, I will just cook the peas with it. And there will definitely be a next time, because despite how time consuming this recipe is it is delicious!

Made this for dinner last night and it was a HUGE hit!  I used prosciutto instead of bacon.  I also will add a little chopped garlic next time.  Sprinkled with parm just before serving.  I found it a little time-consuming, but well worth it!

I made this for dinner last night and it was wonderful!  I used canned mushrooms, added some garlic to the chicken, and diced the chicken in the beginning to save time.  Next time I make this, I will double the lemon sauce, though I used 1/3 the butter called for.  It was excellent! I mixed egg noodles in chicken instead of bow tie noodles.

This was my first time making a butter sauce, and it was a disaster! I followed the recipe exactly, but the sauce separated on me.. after two attempts I just added the flavored butter to the chicken mixture. It tasted great, but was a bit greasy.

I used ham instead of bacon, reduced the amount of butter and oil by a third and used low fat cream and this was still delicious.  Quite a surprising taste so would not be a regular on the table but will certainly make again.

LOVED this. I used a bit more artichoke and mushroom than called for and my husband said a bit less lemon next time for his taste. One tip that I think is important is to cook the bacon completely before adding other ingredients to pan. Otherwise, the bacon will never brown or crisp. I could have licked my plate it was so good.

We liked this dish, but it was too greasy and the bacon wasn't cooked by the time the mushrooms were. Next time we'd cook the bacon ahead of time and would also reduce the amount of butter in the dish; it's like it was sitting in oil. We thought it would make more of a creamy sauce. Liked the addition of the fresh parsley as that cuts some of the heaviness. Overall it had a very good flavor and with the changes, it would be five stars from us. It took us an hour to make so be sure to allow plenty of time. Also think it would be excellent with grilled chicken.

Made this dish for a date night, and it was fantastic! The flavors are light and citrusy, with a perfect touch of salt from the Artichoke and seasoning. Molto Bene! Great dish for a great night!

I agree that the directions are kindof all over the place with timing...but just use your best judgment with that. The sauce  was really full of lemon and buttery goodness and the BF was thrilled with the outcome!  I did double the artichoke and capers for his benefit and had to add just a bit of minced garlic. Wish I had fresh parsley...next time! Thank you for sharing!

I have never written a review on here.  this was to die for delicious. However, I agree do not make it in the order on the recipe. I cooked the bacon (made a little extra!) , then cooked the mushrooms, capers & artichokes in the bacon grease. Set that aside & cooked the chicken in much less oil. After that cooled a bit I sliced it & added it to the other ingredients & set it aside. I also cooked up & added some asparagus cut in one inch pieces because I thought it would go well with the lemon & it did. THEN I made the sauce (because I squeezed about one extra tablespoon of lemon I used it all). Even my husband who mostly prefers really spicy food really liked it!

This is an amazing dish.  I always at least double the sauce part.  And I don't use artichokes.  I also put in quite a bit of Italian seasoning just for a little more flavor.  This is probably my favorite chicken recipe right now.  If you do double the sauce, do NOT double the lemon juice.  Sometimes I don't even use the 5 tablespoons it calls for.  But if you do use too much lemon, you can add sugar and it will make it less lemony.  After you make it a couple of times, season it as you like.  It really is delicious!

My family and I thought this was delicious. I used chicken tenderloins, no artichokes, cut the butter for the sauce down to 1 stick and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream. The other ingredients I kept the same. I made the sauce at the end while the chicken was finishing cooking. I put the cooked chicken in the oven on keep warm. I cooked the bacon, capers, and a can of mushrooms together in the same pan I cooked the chicken tenderloins in. Then threw the cooked chicken tenderloins back in the pan once the bacon was crisped. I served by placing the chicken tenderloins over bow tie pasta  then pouring the sauce over top.Thank you for the fabulous recipe:)

The sauce was a bit more complicated for me.  Perhaps I rushed the steps a bit.  For the taste preferences of my family, I skipped the bacon, mushrooms, capers, etc.  I would also pound out the chicken to facilitate the frying.

Loved this recipe!  I agree with other reviews that the sauce needs to be made last or it will separate.  Lots of ingredients, but not difficult to make and my family devoured it!

Followed the recipe as written and it was a disaster!
If anyone can eat this dish with 5 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and 1 cup of butter for the sauce, I feel sorry for their taste buds.  If these ingredients are satisfactory to everyone that reads this review, I apologize.  I suspect the numbers are wrong, or no one used this recipe as written.  I rate it at "0"

This was delicious but very rich and, yeah, a bit greasy as some reviewers complained about. But it's butter! Yum! It's something to eat once in awhile, or with zucchini noodles if you're following a high fat low carb diet. You definitely need a light salad to balance it out. 

The recipe could be written a bit better. It calls for 4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves. In the US boneless skinless chicken breasts are sold split (which is half a chicken breast). However, chicken breasts here also tend to be gargantuan. I think 2 large breasts would be plenty. I basically cooked twice as much chicken as I needed. Not a big deal because who doesn't love lightly breaded chicken cooked in butter? I'm sure the kids will eat it or we'll have it over salad. Anyway this is why I prefer recipes that use weight based measurement. No room for misinterpretation. 

The steps could be simplified as well, as another reviewer pointed out. My biggest issue with the order the steps are written in is that I really feel you should cook the chicken first and keep it warm so that the sauce doesn't break. 

Overall, this is a great recipe that could be even better with a little tweaking to the steps and listed ingredients. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing UrbanChick.

I made this tonight for dinner. It took a lot longer to prep this meal than the stated 10 minutes. There are mistakes in the recipe directions and also incomplete directions.
In spite of this, it was good. If I make this again, I would only use 1/2 the amount of butter. Way to buttery!

Yum! I used what vegetables I had on hand (spinach, mushrooms and peas) but otherwise kept this recipe as written. Love the ease of the sauce, and the whole family enjoyed the finished product.

This recipe is AMAZING!  First prep as much as you can before starting. Slice the butter into pats, cut bacon into pieces, pound and cut chicken into strips before cooking, prep the flour mix and add Italian seasonings, measure out capers, drain and dice artichokes, drain canned mushroom slices, cut up parsley, heat the water for the pasta but don't cook the pasta until chicken is cooked.  use crisco and butter to cook the chicken.  cook the bacon half way before adding other ingredients.  Keep the sauce warm so it does not separate.  mix it all together at the end and serve over the pasta. Drizzle with sauce and sprinkle with shredded parmesan cheese

I substituted red peppers instead of mushrooms and it gave the dish more color with great flavor.  I would suggest making the sauce last instead of first because it separates and gets greasy instead of creamy.  Everybody loved it.

Outstanding recipes. Since we were doubling the recipe we baked boneless chicken thighs instead of sautéing chicken breasts.  Other qUantities  were all good.

We loved it! Will make it again.
Prep time was definitely longer than ten minutes. But, the recipe is laid out very logically. 
Took me almost an hour from start to finish.

My family loved this.  I added tons of mushrooms because we all like them.  I would make this again in a heart beat.  It does take awhile to make, though (about an hour) so I could not make this on a week night.  All in all, a delicious meal!

The results of this recipe was very good, but it is much too labor intensive for my schedule. The only ingredients I changed were the butter which I reduced to one stick instead of two, and the cream that I increased to 1/2 cup. I sous vide cooked the chicken breast and cut it into pieces the night before and also cooked the bacon. The night I made it, I heated 2 4 oz. cans of mushrooms for a couple of minutes, then added the artichoke hearts and the cutup chicken on a low heat. While this was heating, I cooked the noodles and made the sauce. Then I drained the noodles and poured them and the sauce into the pan with the chicken mix. It was good, but not fantastic. Sprinkling grated Romano cheese on it added a lot to the flavor. If I make this again, I will have to streamline the prep so it takes less time and less pans.

Made exactly as written and inspite of more favorable reviews by many others, I  thought it was just okay.  With that said, I will make it again and plan to replace the bacon w/proscuitto and may add sun dried tomatoes and asparagus for color and a little bit of "crunch".

I'm a new cook, a retired hubby who foolishly agreed to take on cooking three dinners a week.  I have been trying lots of recipes from All Recipes, with mixed success, do partially to my inexperience with cooking techniques.  But this one was a big hit with my discriminating spouse.  We both loved it.  Lotsa butter, but huge amounts of flavor.  Excellent dinner!

Made this the first time last night. Only reason I gave it a five is because of the number of pots and pans used. The dish turned out amazing. Delicious two women, sad to admit, ate almost half. Today for lunch it was just as good.  I may reduce the butter and increase the lemon flavor for the sauce. Add some fresh Parmesan on top and a baguette even better. Another idea is the offer it as a side dish. Put everything together minus the chicken. You can then offer the chicken separate or another meat.

Oh my goodness how do I give something 10 STARS because this recipe blew me and my husbands brains away! It's succulent, decadent and besides the butter it's healthy! Basically just browned chicken with a lemon-cream sauce topped with artichokes and capers!

this was an amazing recipe I didn 't use the vegggies and I cut the butter down a bit but so tasty . A good tip is to deglaze the pan the chicken  was cooked in to add to the flavor.Now I am going to add some pepper flakes for the next time

Love this!! I skipped out on the mushrooms and artichokes but did use the capers. My only suggestion is to make the lemon butter sauce last while chicken is cooking that way it doesn't seperate and get greasy.

Oh wow! I was so impressed by this recipe.  It was so flavorful. I took the advice to cut the chicken into strips before cooking, saved time and the chicken turned out just right.  I think I would try it with a little less butter next time. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This was ok.  It was way too lemony!  The sauce was very thin & I feel it made too much.  If I were to make it again, I would make a different sauce.

Love this! And I made some alterations. I doubled the pasta and used whole wheat penne. I also doubled the chicken, and sliced it instead of flattening it - cooked it in a pan with some olive oil and kept warm. I used turkey bacon and cooked it a bit before adding the other ingredients. As far as the sauce went, I used only one stick of butter and 3T cream + 3T fat free half and half, with the 5T of lemon and 1/4 C. wine. Fancy enough for important guests, but my family loves it, too.

This is a great recipe.  It did take longer than 30 minutes to prepare and I switched the order of the preparation to make it easier for me.  I made the sauce last.  I cooked the pasta, chicken (and put it in the oven to keep warm), then the vegetables, and then the sauce.  I placed the pasta in a large serving dish, cut up the chicken and placed it on the pasta, poured the veggies on all of that and then the sauce when it was finished.  I let it all sit for a few minutes, gave it a little stir, and then served.  The sauce was easy to make and came together nicely.  For my taste, there was too much lemon and the wine that I had on hand was on the sweeter side.  Next time I will reduce the amount of lemon and be sure to have a drier wine.  I will definitely make this again.

Oh wow, amazing is right! It took about 45 minutes total and next time I'll remember to start the pasta later to improve timing. Don't feel compelled to use all the sauce, because though it's delicious, it's RICH - like, artery clogging rich. Perfect meal on a cool evening.

Great recipe. We have a local Italian rest. that had a dish I just had to try to replicate. So my version was boneless skinless chicken thighs thinly sliced. Capers, sliced banana peppers, sliced baby Bella mushrooms, diced vidala onion, over whole grain rotini. The sauce was perfect! Just about dead on.

This is great!  Hard to find different ways of serving things that my hubby will eat, and he's asked for it again.   I even made the sauce with bacon bits and capers and used it over Swai fish (fried like this recipe)... hubby loves that too!!  So now I have 2 dishes from the same recipe.  
I'm one happy camper!!   :o)

This was great. At first i thought it would be too lemon-y... but it went well. It was a pain to measure fresh squeezed lemon juice... however i would not use lemon juice from concentrate. Next time i will leave out the bacon and add  more artichoke for personal prefference. The bacon after a while seemed soggy and fatty so i ended up picking the bacon out of each bowl i had.

I think it wa OK, a little sour for my tastes.  I had to add some more mild and some romano/parmesan cheese to tone it down.  It was nice to try, but not sure it will be going into my recipe rotation.

We thought it was very good. I used only half the butter as that was a lot and it was just fine.  I also made the sauce last, keeping the chicken warm in the oven.

Excellent!  I skipped the mushrooms because we don't eat them and I didn't have capers so I substituted a black olive bruschetta I had in the pantry. I will be making this many more times!

This was really good. I cooked the chicken first and kept it warm in the oven while I made the sauce. I followed the recipe except that I left out mushrooms and capers because I don't like them and added spinach which I thought was a nice addition.

Made this for friends.  I doubled the recipe as one of my friends is a big eater and it doubled just fine!  The tangy lemon and creamy butter flavour is a delightful combination.  Served with a bread-dip app and some baby spinach salad and delicious pinot grigio for a fabulous evening together :)

This was amazing! I doubled the sauce and added extra lemon and garlic to the recipe (and extra heavy cream). The next time Im going to use less butter and try broth instead for a slightly healthier version! I saved time by microwaving the bacon on a plate between paper towels for 2-3 minutes. The chicken was the most time consuming part but I felt like this would be a great dish without the chicken as well. I didnt measure the capers, mushrooms or artichokes, just put in alot. My man loved it so Im making it again this weekend.

I made only the sauce from this recipe and sauteed chicken and served the sauce over the chicken, steamed green beans, and brown rice. My husband loved it! It didn't thicken as much as I would have hoped, but I think that was my fault. It was delicious though!

OH MY HOLY COW!!!!! I am in a dinner coma. It was that good. I highly recomend this dish. My whole family LOVED it. My husband gave it a 4 and a half stars. Which is very high for him. I will be making this often. I did add a little extra cream and no cappers because I didn't have any.

Used chicken tenders, canned mushrooms and smoked bacon.  I cut the butter in half and used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and it still is way too greasy.  Luckily, I was just serving this to the immediate family because the seperation of the sauce is not appetizing.  I reduce the lemon to 3 tablespoons and still had complaints that it was too "lemony". Too speed up time I cooked the bacon in the microwave, which I am glad I did because that also helped cut back on the grease. I personally thought it had good flavor but would not make again because it is not worth the time.

Great taste but needs more sauce.  

To lighten the sauce I used 6 Tbsp. white wine, 6 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice with zest from 1 lemon, 6 Tbsp. evaporated milk in place of heavy cream, 4-5 Tbsp. light whipped butter in place of 1 cup butter.  Afraid it would be too runny with less fat, I used cornstarch in place of flour and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and Greek seasoning.  May also have contributed to no sauce.

Loving my veggies, I added 2 cups torn fresh spinach, 1/2 can diced hearts of palm and 8 sundried tomatos at the end with the cooked mushrooms and capers,  

Wonderful flavor, but will double the wine, lemon juicfe, evaporated milk (in place of cream) and whipped butter for a more saucy dish. Thanks for sharing.  Great with a green salad and hot fresh bread.

This was a really good recipe. Tasted good. My husband loved it. I only gave it 3 stars because this was the greasiest meal I've ever put on the table. It was so greasy I couldn't stomach but a small portion. If I make it again I will omit the extra olive oil to sautee the mushroom/artichoke/caper/bacon mixture because the bacon produces enough grease, no extra should be necessary. I would also probably put about half of the bacon it calls for. Other than that it was good, the sauce was perfect.

Really, really delicious, but a lot of work. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding some lemon zest to sauce. The bacon should have been cut before cooked, but i got in the pan with a scissors to cut it up. When I added the sauce to the pan it totally separated and was no longer the creamy looking sauce in the sauce pan. Was it worth the unbelievable amount of fat? Maybe on special occassions, but there has to be a way to reduce it.

MUCH longer than thirty minutes, very greasy, and much more "lemony" than I had hoped for. Also The timing around this thing was very difficult and confusing. Do not plan on making this again. Do not recommend this to anyone.

Very Good!!  I would definitely double the sauce though... and do use fresh lemon juice. I forgot the buy lemons so I used some from the jar and I dont think it turned out as good as it would have. Oh and I omitted the bacon, already a lot of flavors going on in this dish.

Made half recipe and needed more sauce and more oil for cooking chicken. Should have cooked bacon alittle first and used that oil. Didn't have capers, mushrooms, or artichokes I did use green onion but not enough. Anyway truned out great next time I'd get the veggies and make more sauce.

oh em gee!! This is SOOOO good. I didn't have any wine, so I omitted that but even then...holy ! Everyone LOVES it. My husband rated it a 10! He wanted me to make it the next night! Ingredients are kind of expensive where I'm at:( Oh well, it's too good not to make regularly. Thank God for P90X otherwise this would make me HUGE. :)

As the other reviews stated, the final product is very greasy. It is VERY difficult to keep the sauce from separating before you serve it. This trait also makes the dish no good as leftovers (it looks like straight butter/oil and noodles). With that said, it was good; I'm just not sure if the taste is worth all the calories and fat grams!

The dish without all the sauce was well put together but the sauce was WAY too buttery. I loved the combo of ingredients without the sauce. Next time, I'm going to try and make some sort of lemony cheese sauce and not use so much butter. I felt so greasy and sick after eating this as is....Heart attack waiting to happen, definatly not a healthy sauce.

Really good!  My husband also liked it.  The kids didn't care for it, but they have very limited palates.  This is a lot of work and needs attention to details to streamline.  Experimenting is recommended.  Try during wknd where time is more flexible.  I would make the following changes:  pound chkn  (coating with flour may not be necessary) cook  (2) chicken breasts and keep warm boil water use leftover bacon from a wknd breakfast Lemon Sauce: Use 1/2 lemon  reduce butter to a total of 1 stick Veggies: Try cooking in butter instead of oil or chkn broth. Add garlic Use an entire box of pasta so kids can have noodles plain

Yum!!  Used frozen artichoke hearts which were fantastic in this dish.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Next time might add a few more capers.  I usually don't like capers, but they were fantastic in this dish.  I think it would be good to add a little diced tomato right before serving :)

Pretty good! I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted a bit too lemon-y for my taste, so next time I will scale back on the lemon juice. I'll also probably use grilled chicken next time as well.

My husband saw this featured and asked me to make it for him.  After reading the reviews, I followed suggestions and cooked the chicken and bacon first.  When I started with the sauce, I could tell it wouldn't be enough as we were using linguine instead of bowtie pasta and my hubby likes a lot of sauce so I doubled ingredients (didn't measure, just poured) and poured the half not used on chicken, etc into the linguine pot.  Man!  Was this ever flavorful and delicious!  Will make again and again when I have an hour and half to spare for cooking this dish.  It definitely takes longer to prepare than stated, but well worth the time and effort

Delish!  Cut the butter in half and grilled the chicken with lemon pepper instead of pan frying for a healthier version.

Yum!  Lemon, butter, cream, artichoke hearts...how can you go wrong?  Those are a few of my favorite things!  Used leftover roast chicken that had been sitting in the fridge. instead of frying, also cut back the butter a bit when making the sauce.  Served with a fresh loaf of no-knead bread.  Very tasty!

This was a wonderful recipe and was easier to make than the directions seemed.  I cooked the chicken and the sauce at the same time so the sauce would not separate.  I halved the butter called for in the sauce, but when I do this recipe again, I will do 3/4 cup of butter.  I also made a little bit more pasta than it called for.  Very yummy and I will make again.

This recipe was delicious, but I have to agree was way too greasy!!  I can bet you can cut the butter out almost altogether and still be delicious. Thanks for a good recipe though!

This recipe was just okay in my opinion, but my family didn't like it at all. They said it was too tangy, and they are big lemon fans.  I left the sauce, chicken mixture, & noodles all seperate until serving.  My youngest loved the chicken, alone, without the sauce.  I only used 1/4 of the butter it called for and the sauce did not seperate.

This was super good, should be said though to keep the sauce separate until the very last second before serving.  I comibined and kept on low heat to keep warm while company arrived and the sauce broke and tuned to straight butter, ended up pretty greasy instead of creamy.  Added lots more lemon juice and zest than called for (really like lemon!)  Still a great recipe!

Loved this recipe.  I used half and half to lighten up the sauce a bit and I would suggest a little less lemon.  This is a fabulous recipe to tweak to your personal preferences.

This is a very tasty recepy, however it is very greasy! I cup of butter for the sauce is way too much as well as 5tbs of cream. I made it exatly as the recepie said and my family loved it. But next time I will make it less greasy using only half a cup of smart balance butter and fat free heavy cream.

I listened to a few other people and cut the butter in half.  I also added garlic because we love garlic in almost everything!  My boyfriend had 3 helpings, and he normally would never have a "creamy" pasta.  This made so much food as well!

I made the sauce, and it was DIVINE! I cut the amount of butter to less than half to make it less rich and fattening. Worked and tasted just as great. Also, add garlic for fuller flavor!  I skipped the complicated ingredients and steps like flouring chicken, adding bacon, etc. Just make the sauce and use it on top of ANY fresh sauteed veggies and diced, sauteed chicken, and pasta. Use whole wheat pasta for an even healthier option. So yummy.

The butter is a lot so i did cut the sauce in half the second go around.  Never could find capers so we just left them out.  I don't think the flavors were too much i thought they tasted well together.  Very different from anything i've tasted before.

Delicious! Fattening though! I may do again and see if I can take some other reviewers suggestions for a lower fat version. But this was VERY good as is!!!

This review is for the sauce only.  I made it to top some chicken and mashed potatoes.  It was just OK...not good enough for me to spend the time or calories again.

This was delicious, but time consuming! Definitely not a weeknight meal. I did not use the artichoke hearts or capers. I used more heavy cream than called for. I mixed the chicken, mushrooms, bacon and butter sauce all together and tossed it with the pasta. Very good stuff. Not too sour or lemony, just right. Great for a special occasion meal. I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top once the servings were on the plates. I served this with garlic bread. FYI: This does NOT reheat well. It just becomes a greasy mess the next day, so be sure to finish it off when it's fresh!

I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and it was delicious!!  I would definitely make this one again.  In case you are confused about the bacon, I cut it up and then put it in the pan cooked it and then added the mushrooms.  The flavor was amazing and I can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow!

This was great! I only used 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter in the sauce, because a whole cup grossed me out. Instead of 1/4 cup of flour, I used about 1 cup and I only used 3 chicken breasts, then let them sit in the fridge for a couple hours. I added the whole jar of artichokes (12 oz) and 8 oz of fresh mushrooms. I've never had capers before; they were interesting, but good in the dish. I mixed everything together (including the bowties) at the end, and it was a little dry so I added some half-and-half to moisten it up a bit. We topped this with fresh Parmesan cheese and no parsley.

I have one word for this recipe...WOWZA! Made it for my husband for our anniversary and received many compliments. I was nervous that there would not be enough flavor, but there was plenty. Chicken tasted wonderful and was so tender. Will definitely make again!

One of our favorite pasta dishes ever.  I make it with just the chicken and the pasta, no artichokes, mushrooms or capers and it is perfect every single time.  The only thing I add is some garlic powder to the coating for the chicken, I've made it with and without the powder and my husband and I definitely prefer it with.  This is a go to dish to impress company with, thank you!

I really liked this one!  As other members have said, if you don't like butter and/or lemon - pass on this but otherwise I followed it to a "T" sans Artichokes and everyone loved it!

My family had mixed reviews on this dish.  I personally did not care for I found the flavors overpowering, but two of the guys thought it was wonderful.  I will not make again but their wifes now have the recipe.  Thanks for the post.

This is a fantastic dish but, as others have said, it takes a lot of work.  Plan this for a night when you have some time and you won't be disappointed.

OMG -- Amazing!  I was skeptical as I tasted the lemon butter sauce while it was cooking and thought Yuck!  However, when blended together with the other ingredients -- absolutely fabulous.  I was so impressed and so was my 11 year old daughter who really does dislike pretty much all food!  She absolutely loved this!  While it uses alot of pots and pans and bowls -- so well worth it!  I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make this again and again (the fat content is well worth the delectable taste)!!!  Thank you for this recipe!

Really good recipe, although I did doctor it up.  I followed previous advice and cut the chicken into pieces before flouring them and cooking them.  I reduced my butter by only 2 tbsps, and I used whole milk instead of cream.  I also cooked my bacon before adding it in.  I thought the recipe had great flavor, it wasn't greasy at all, and we really enjoyed it.  I'll definitely be making it again!

Delicious recipe. One to save for company. It was a little oily at the bottom of the bowl so I will use less butter next time.

Good recipe. Although I didn't have lemon juice so what I did was cook the butter in one table spood of lemon pepper spice. Then I drained out the butter from the spice and used that. It tasted alright, but I probably should have used the lemon juice. the chicken was excellent.

A varied response... our guests loved it and raved endlessly, but my boyfriend thought it was just okay... For me, it was good but far too rich to eat much of.  
It took longer to make than the recipe says-- and I still had to cook it down at the end because the sauce was too runny.
Might make again, but won't fry the chicken for it--- no benefit for the extra time.
