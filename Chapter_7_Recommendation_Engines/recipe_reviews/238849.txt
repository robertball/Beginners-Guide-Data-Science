I made exactly as written (substituted half and half for the heavy whipping cream as recipe submitter mentioned) and this turned out better than any cheese dip I have ever made with Velveeta. The roasted peppers is what sets this one apart from other cheese dips so I recommend not skipping this step. I think any combo of hot peppers you prefer or had on hand would work just fine. This one is a keeper and one I will make often during football season!

I used this to make my first queso dip as my husband loves all things hot and we had purchased a wonderful queso at a great Mexican restaurant just a few nights prior.  This turned out wonderfully.  I used some of the other commenter's advice: roasted the peppers (low broil for about 20 minutes) WITH the seeds, sauteed the onions in butter until translucent and kept the seeds from all the peppers to add to the dip.  I skipped the cumin and used 2% milk in a smaller portion to thin it out ever so slightly.  I cooked it on low in a dutch overlow heat for 30 mins rather than in a slow cooker.  

It has a great kick to it -- the kind that warms the back of your throat right down to you chest.  I loved it and what drew me to it was the addition of fresh peppers.  Many other versions require only a can of tomatoes and Velveeta -- I thought this was far superior.  It makes a large portion and I was surprised to see the next day how it refrigerated so well -- same consistency, no hard film on top and easy to just heat and serve.  I think I'll be bringing this to my next pot luck.  Thank you!!

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  The only difference was that I sauteed the onions and used jalapeno, Anaheim, and Serrano peppers because that was what was available at the store.  It was surprising mild in flavor. Next time I might add some seeds from peppers as suggested by others for a little spicier taste. Make sure to wear gloves when removing seeds and skin from the peppers.  My fingers burned for hours afterwards.  We served with soft pretzels and tortilla chips.

The roasted peppers and the onions made this irresistibly tasty! I sauteed my onions out of personal preference.  Followed the directions about the roasted peppers, but the skins didn't peel off easily.  However, I pulled off as much skin as possible (only about 1/4 came off each pepper), then chopped finely and the remaining skin was not noticed nor a factor in the dip. I cheated a little and instead of dicing the tomatoes, just added 1 can of Rotel Mild tomatoes and chilies. Used FF half and half, too. The dip was very mild - really no kick, but wonderful flavor.  So you could add some hot sauce or more jalapenos to boost the heat.My guests and I could not get enough of this delicious dip. Along with the other reviewers, I'll use this queso recipe whenever I want to impress guests.  My son prefers the simpler version (Velveeta and Rotel only).  Thanks for sharing this recipe Shrimpbait.

This was great recipe. However next time I will leave the seeds in the jalapeno. Very mild. Will for sure make again. My kids loved it.

Nice, tasty and quick to assemble recipe.  I will probably add less cumin in the next batch, but still quite nice all around.  Followed the original recipe 100% the first time, make changes later as needed.

This was a lovely dip!  I almost followed the exact recipe except I took a minute and deseeded the tomatoes, sweated off the onions as suggested by another reviewer and I did go easy on the hot peppers - some of my guests were not so fond of spicy food.  I will totally make this again!  I highly recommend, if possible, making it a day ahead.  The flavours come out better and it reheats beautifully.

Great taste but cut the tomatoes very small, onions too.  Makes the dip easier to dip.

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Everyone loved it.  My grocery store had poblano chiles labeled as pasilla so if you can't find poblano, it's probably there,  just labeled wrong.  I made it the day before and re-heated.  I served it in my Hamilton Beach Cast Iron Party Crock which was the perfect size.  This is my go-to queso from now on.

I have made this several times and it's always fantastic.  Try it with seeded peppers though for an extra kick.  Also give it several hours in a crockpot.

I have experimented with different queso recipes over the years. This one is by far my family's favorite. My wife and kids couldn't get enough of it. It tastes better than the queso from our favorite restaurant. I highly recommend it.

Very bland and the cumin was way too strong.
